Modifications\nin the equations of Regge trajectories are shown for mesonic as well as\nbaryonic systems. For mesonic systems, the Regge trajectories get modified, but\nstill remain linear. Contrary to the mesonic case, the Regge trajectories for\nbaryonic systems indicate non-linearity. It is shown that in low mass and\nangular momentum region two hadrons with different quark compositions can have\nsame mass and angular momentum.\n", "  We extend the study of \\emph{melonic} quartic tensor models to models with\narbitrary quartic interactions. This extension requires a new version of the\nloop vertex expansion using several species of intermediate fields and iterated\nCauchy-Schwarz inequalities. Borel summability is proven, uniformly as the\ntensor size $N$ becomes large. Every cumulant is written as a sum of explicitly\ncalculated terms plus a remainder, suppressed in $1/N$. Together with the\nexistence of the large $N$ limit of the second cumulant, this proves that the\ncorresponding sequence of probability measures is uniformly bounded and obeys\nthe tensorial universality theorem.\n", "  The chiral U(1) anomalies associated with a fermion of spin 1/2 interacting\nwith nonabelian vector and axial-vector fields in four- and six-dimensional\ncurved space are given in tensorial form.\n", "  Transport of colloid particles through narrow channels is ubiquitous in cell\nbiology as well as becoming increasingly important for microfluidic\napplications or targeted drug delivery. Membrane channels in cells are useful\nmodels for artificial designs because of their high efficiency, selectivity and\nrobustness to external fluctuations. Here we model the passive channels that\nlet cargo simply diffuse through them, affected by a potential profile along\nthe way. Passive transporters achieve high levels of efficiency and specificity\nfrom binding interactions with the cargo inside the channel. This however leads\nto a paradox: why should channels which are so narrow that they are blocked by\ntheir cargo evolve to have binding regions for their cargo if that will\neffectively block them? Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that\ndifferent potentials, notably symmetric, increase the flux through narrow\npassive channels -- and investigate how shape and depth of potentials influence\nthe flux. We find that there exist optimal depths for certain potential shapes\nand that it is most efficient to apply a small force over an extended region of\nthe channel. On the other hand, having several spatially discrete binding\npockets will not alter the flux significantly. We also explore the role of\nmany-particle effects arising from pairwise particle interactions with their\nneighbours and demonstrate that the relative changes in flux can be accounted\nfor by the kinetics of the absorption reaction at the end of the channel.\n", "  Generation of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase has achieved a state-of-the-art in\nmesoscopic systems with manipulation and control of the AB effect. The\npossibility of transfer information enconded in such systems to non-classical\nstates of light increases the possible scenarios where the information can be\nmanipulated and transfered. In this paper we propose a quantum transfer of the\nAB phase generated in a spintronic device, a topological spin transistor (TST),\nto an quantum optical device, a coherent state superposition in high-Q cavity\nand discuss optical and spin-optical superpositions in the presence of an AB\nphase. We demonstrate that the AB phase generated in the TST can be transfered\nto the coherent state superposition, considering the interaction with the spin\nstate and the quantum optical manipulation of the coherent state superposition.\nWe show that these cases provide examples of two-qubit states modulated by AB\neffect and that the phase parameter can be used to control the degree of\nrotation of the qubit state. We also show under a measurement on the spin\nbasis, an optical one-qubit state that can be modulated by the AB effect. In\nthese cases, we consider a dispesive interaction between a coherent state and a\nspin state with an acquired AB phase and also discuss a dissipative case where\na given Lindblad equation is achieved and solved. Keywords: Quantum transfer;\nAharonov-Bohm phase; Spintronics; Quantum Optical Devices.\n", "  We consider the simplest extension of the standard model, where torsion\ncouples to spinor as well as to scalar fields, and in which the cosmological\nconstant problem is solved.\n", "  Recently, there had been a great deal of interest in obtaining and describing\nof all kinds of knots in links in hydrodynamics, electrodynamics, non Abelian\ngauge field theories and gravity. Although knots and links are observables of\nthe Chern-Simons (C-S) functional, the dynamical conditions for their\ngeneration lie outside of the scope of the C-S theory. The nontriviality of\ndynamical generation of knotted structures is caused by the fact that the\ncomplements of all knots/links, say, in S^3 are 3-manifolds which have\npositive, negative or zero curvature. The ability to curve the ambient space\nthus far is attributed to masses. The mass theorem of general relativity\nrequires the ambient 3-manifolds to be of non negative curvature. Recently, we\nestablished that, in the absence of boundaries, complements of dynamically\ngenerated knots/links are represented by 3-manifolds of non negative curvature.\nThis fact opens the possibility to discuss masses in terms of dynamically\ngenerated knotted/ linked structures. The key tool is the notion of knot/link\nconcordance. The concept of concordance is an adaptation of the concept of\ncobordism to knots and links. The logic of implementation of the concordance\nconcept to physical masses results in new interpretation of Casson's surgery\nformula in terms of the Regge trajectories. The latest thoroughly examined\nChew-Frautschi (C-F) plots associated with these trajectories demonstrate that\nthe hadron mass spectrum for both mesons and baryons is nicely described by the\ndata on the corresponding C-F plots. The physics behind Casson's surgery\nformula is similar but not identical to that described purely\nphenomenologically by Keith Moffatt in 1990. The developed topological\ntreatment is fully consistent with available rigorous mathematical and\nexperimentally observed results related to physics of hadrons\n", "  We consider a dominance order on positive vectors induced by the elementary\nsymmetric polynomials. Under this dominance order we provide conditions that\nyield simple proofs of several monotonicity questions. Notably, our approach\nyields a quick (4 line) proof of the so-called\n\\emph{\"sum-of-squared-logarithms\"} inequality conjectured in (P.~Neff,\nB.~Eidel, F.~Osterbrink, and R.~Martin, \\emph{Applied Math. \\& Mechanics.,\n2013}; P.~Neff, Y.~Nakatsukasa, and A.~Fischle; \\emph{SIMAX, 35, 2014}). This\ninequality has been the subject of several recent articles, and only recently\nit received a full proof, albeit via a more elaborate complex-analytic\napproach. We provide an elementary proof, which moreover extends to yield\nsimple proofs of both old and new inequalities for R\\'enyi entropy, subentropy,\nand quantum R\\'enyi entropy.\n", "  We present a sparse sensing framework based on Dynamic Mode Decomposition\n(DMD) to identify flow regimes and bifurcations in large-scale thermo-fluid\nsystems. Motivated by real-time sensing and control of thermal-fluid flows in\nbuildings and equipment, we apply this method to a Direct Numerical Simulation\n(DNS) data set of a 2D laterally heated cavity. The resulting flow solutions\ncan be divided into several regimes, ranging from steady to chaotic flow. The\nDMD modes and eigenvalues capture the main temporal and spatial scales in the\ndynamics belonging to different regimes. Our proposed classification method is\ndata-driven, robust w.r.t measurement noise, and exploits the dynamics\nextracted from the DMD method. Namely, we construct an augmented DMD basis,\nwith \"built-in\" dynamics, given by the DMD eigenvalues. This allows us to\nemploy a short time-series of data from sensors, to more robustly classify flow\nregimes, particularly in the presence of measurement noise. We also exploit the\nincoherence exhibited among the data generated by different regimes, which\npersists even if the number of measurements is small compared to the dimension\nof the DNS data. The data-driven regime identification algorithm can enable\nrobust low-order modeling of flows for state estimation and control.\n", "  Two different four component Camassa-Holm (4CH) systems with cubic\nnonlinearity are proposed. The Lax pair and Hamiltonian structure are defined\nfor both (CH) systems. The first (4CH) system include as a special case the\n(3CH) system considered by Xia, Zhou and Qiao, while the second contains the\ntwo-component generalization of Novikov system considered by Geng and Xiu.\n", "  Despite the finiteness of stress tensor for a scalar field on the\nfour-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole in the Israel-Hartle-Hawking vacuum,\nthe Tolman temperature in thermal equilibrium is certainly divergent on the\nhorizon due to the infinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature. The origin of\nthis conflict is due to the fact that the conventional Tolman temperature was\nbased on the assumption of a traceless stress tensor, which is, however,\nincompatible with the presence of the trace anomaly responsible for the Hawking\nradiation. Here, we present an effective Tolman temperature which is compatible\nwith the presence of the trace anomaly by using the modified Stefan-Boltzmann\nlaw. Eventually, the effective Tolman temperature turns out to be finite\neverywhere outside the horizon, and so there does not appear infinite blueshift\nof the Hawking temperature at the event horizon any more. In particular, it is\nvanishing on the horizon, so that the equivalence principle is exactly\nrecovered at the horizon.\n", "  The stationary distribution of a fully chaotic system typically exhibits a\nfractal structure, which dramatically changes if the dynamical equations are\neven slightly modified. Perturbative techniques are not expected to work in\nthis situation. In contrast, the presence of additive noise smooths out the\nstationary distribution, and perturbation theory becomes applicable. We show\nthat a perturbation expansion for the Fokker-Planck evolution operator yields\nsurprisingly accurate estimates of long-time averages in an otherwise unlikely\nscenario.\n", "  We analyze propagation equations for the polar modes of gravitational waves\nin cosmological space-times. We prove that polar gravitational waves must\nperturb the density and non-azimuthal components of the velocity of material\nmedium of the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Axial\ngravitational waves can influence only the azimuthal velocity, leading to local\ncosmological rotation. The whole gravitational dynamics reduces to the single\n\"master equation\" that has the same form for polar and axial modes. That allows\nus to conclude that the status of the Huygens principle is the same for axial\nand polar gravitational waves. In particular, this principle is valid exactly\nin radiation spacetimes with the vanishing cosmological constant, and it is\nbroken otherwise.\n", "  We study the effects of asymmetry in entanglement thermodynamics of the CFT\nsubsystems. It is found that `boosted' $p$-branes backgrounds give rise to the\nfirst law of the entanglement thermodynamics where the CFT pressure plays\ndecisive role in the entanglement. Two different strip like subsystems, one\nparallel to the boost and the other perpendicular, are studied in the\nperturbative regime, where $T_{thermal}\\ll T_E$. We also discuss the AdS-wave\nbackgrounds where some universal bounds can be obtained.\n", "  For calculation of the single-channel nucleon-nucleon scattering a\nphase-functions method has been proposed. Using a phase-functions method the\nfollowing phase shifts of np- scattering numerically for 1S0-, 1P1-, 3P0-,\n3P1-, 1D2-, 3D2-, 1F3-, 3F3-, 1G4-, 3G4- states are calculated. The\ncalculations has been performed using realistic nucleon-nucleon Reid68 and\nReid93 potentials. Obtained phase shifts for energy up to 350 MeV are in good\nagreement with the results obtained in the framework of other methods. Using\nthe obtained phase shifts we have calculated the full cross-section np-\nscattering.\n", "  In this paper we apply the frequency transfer function (FTF) formalism to\nanalyze the red, green and blue (RGB) phase-shifting fringe-projection\nprofilometry technique. The phase-shifted fringe patterns in RGB fringe\nprojection are typically corrupted by crosstalk because the sensitivity curves\nof most projection-recording systems overlap. Crosstalk distortion needs to be\ncompensated in order to obtain high quality measurements. We study\nphase-demodulation methods for null/mild, moderate, and severe levels of RGB\ncrosstalk. For null/mild crosstalk, we can estimate the searched phase-map\nusing Bruning's 3-step phase-shifting algorithm (PSA). For moderate crosstalk,\nthe RGB recorded data is usually preprocessed before feeding it into Bruning's\nPSA; alternatively, in this paper we propose a computationally more efficient\napproach, which combines crosstalk compensation and phase-demodulation into a\nsingle process. For severe RGB crosstalk, we expect non-sinusoidal fringes'\nprofiles (distorting harmonics) and significant uncertainties on the crosstalk\ncalibration (which produces pseudo-detuning error). Analyzing these distorting\nphenomena, we conclude that squeezing interferometry is the most robust\ndemodulation method for RGB fringe-projection techniques. We support our\nconclusions with numerical simulations and experimental results.\n", "  We present a holographic perspective on momentum transport in strongly\ncoupled, anisotropic non-Abelian plasmas in the presence of strong magnetic\nfields. We compute the anisotropic heavy quark drag forces and Langevin\ndiffusion coefficients and also the anisotropic shear viscosities for two\ndifferent holographic models, namely, a top-down deformation of strongly\ncoupled $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory triggered by an\nexternal Abelian magnetic field, and a bottom-up Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD)\nmodel which is able to provide a quantitative description of lattice QCD\nthermodynamics with $(2+1)$-flavors at both zero and nonzero magnetic fields.\nWe find that, in general, energy loss and momentum diffusion through strongly\ncoupled anisotropic plasmas are enhanced by a magnetic field being larger in\ntransverse directions than in the direction parallel to the magnetic field.\nMoreover, the anisotropic shear viscosity coefficient is smaller in the\ndirection of the magnetic field than in the plane perpendicular to the field,\nwhich indicates that strongly coupled anisotropic plasmas become closer to the\nperfect fluid limit along the magnetic field. We also present, in the context\nof the EMD model, holographic predictions for the entropy density and the\ncrossover critical temperature in a wider region of the $(T,B)$ phase diagram\nthat has not yet been covered by lattice simulations. Our results for the\ntransport coefficients in the phenomenologically realistic magnetic EMD model\ncould be readily used as inputs in numerical codes for magnetohydrodynamics.\n", "  We present an analytical modal description of the rich physics involved in\nhybrid plasmonic-photonic devices that is confirmed by full dipole solutions of\nMaxwell's equations. Strong frequency-dependence for the spontaneous emission\ndecay rate of a quantum dipole emitter coupled to these hybrid structures is\npredicted. In particular, it is shown that the Fano-type resonances reported\nexperimentally in hybrid plasmonic systems, arise from a very large\ninterference between dominant quasinormal modes of the systems in the frequency\nrange of interest. The presented model forms an efficient basis for modelling\nquantum light-matter interactions in these complex hybrid systems and also\nenables the quantitativ prediction and understanding of non-radiative coupling\nlosses.\n", "  I describe how real quantum annealers may be used to perform local (in state\nspace) searches around specified states, rather than the global searches\ntraditionally implemented in the quantum annealing algorithm. Such protocols\nwill have numerous advantages over simple quantum annealing. By using such\nsearches the effect of problem mis-specification can be reduced, as only energy\ndifferences between the searched states will be relevant. The quantum annealing\nalgorithm is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical numerical\ntechnique which has now been superseded. Hence, I explore two strategies to use\nan annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization\nalgorithms. Specifically, I show how sequential calls to quantum annealers can\nbe used to construct analogues of population annealing and parallel tempering\nwhich use quantum searches as subroutines. The techniques given here can be\napplied not only to optimization, but also to sampling. I examine the\nfeasibility of these protocols on real devices and note that implementing such\nprotocols should require minimal if any change to the current design of the\nflux qubit-based annealers by D-Wave Systems Inc. I further provide\nproof-of-principle numerical experiments based on quantum Monte Carlo that\ndemonstrate simple examples of the discussed techniques.\n", "  Bridging between descriptions involving few large and many small quantum\nnumbers is the main open problem in loop quantum gravity. In other words, one\nwould like to be able to represent the same physical system in terms of a few\n\"coarse\"' quantum numbers, while the effective dynamics at the coarse level\nshould agree with the one induced by a description involving many small quantum\nnumbers. Efforts to understand this relationship face the problem of the\nenormous computational complexity involved in evolving a generic state\ncontaining many quanta. In a cosmological context however, certain symmetry\nassumptions on the quantum states allow to simplify the problem. In this paper,\nwe will show how quantum states describing a spatially flat homogeneous and\nisotropic universe can be refined and coarse grained. Invariance of the\ndynamics of the coarse observables is shown to require a certain scaling\nproperty (familiar from loop quantum cosmology) of the quantum states if no\nrunning of parameters is taken into account. The involved states are solutions\nto the Hamiltonian constraint when terms coming from spatial derivatives are\nneglected, i.e. one works in the approximation of non-interacting FRW patches.\nThe technical means to arrive at this result are a version of loop quantum\ngravity based on variables inspired by loop quantum cosmology, as well as an\nexact solution to the quantum dynamics of loop quantum cosmology which extends\nto the full theory in the chosen approximation.\n", "  We introduce a functional covariant differential as a tool for studying field\nspace geometry in a manifestly covariant way. We then touch upon its role in\ngauge theories and general relativity over bounded regions, and in BRST\nsymmetry. Due to the Gribov problem, we argue that our formalism ---allowing\nfor a non-vanishing functional curvature---is necessary for a global treatment\nof gauge-invariance in field space. We conclude by suggesting that the\nstructures we introduce satisfactorily implement the notion of a\n(non-asymptotic) observer in gauge theories and general relativity.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a counter-example to the ER=EPR conjecture. In an\nanti-de Sitter space, we construct a pair of maximally entangled but separated\nblack holes. Due to the vacuum decay of the anti-de Sitter background toward a\ndeeper vacuum, these two parts can be trapped by bubbles. If these bubbles are\nreasonably large, then within the scrambling time, there should appear an\nEinstein-Rosen bridge between the two black holes. Now by tracing more details\non the bubble dynamics, one can identify parameters such that one of the two\nbubbles either monotonically shrinks or expands. Because of the change of\nvacuum energy, one side of the black hole would evaporate completely. Due to\nthe shrinking of the apparent horizon, a signal of one side of the\nEinstein-Rosen bridge can be viewed from the opposite side. We analytically and\nnumerically demonstrate that within a reasonable semi-classical parameter\nregime, such process can happen. Bubbles are a non-perturbative effect, which\nis the crucial reason that allows the transmission of information between the\ntwo black holes through the Einstein-Rosen bridge, even though the probability\nis highly suppressed. Therefore, the ER=EPR conjecture cannot be generic in its\npresent form and its validity maybe restricted.\n", "  The delocalized non-ergodic phase existing in some random $N \\times N$ matrix\nmodels is analyzed via the Wigner-Weisskopf approximation for the dynamics from\nan initial site $j_0$. The main output of this approach is the inverse\n$\\Gamma_{j_0}(N)$ of the characteristic time to leave the state $j_0$ that\nprovides some broadening $\\Gamma_{j_0}(N) $ for the weights of the\neigenvectors. In this framework, the localized phase corresponds to the region\nwhere the broadening $\\Gamma_{j_0}(N) $ is smaller in scaling than the level\nspacing $\\Delta_{j_0}(N) \\propto \\frac{1}{N}$, while the delocalized\nnon-ergodic phase corresponds to the region where the broadening\n$\\Gamma_{j_0}(N) $ decays with $N$ but is bigger in scaling than the level\nspacing $\\Delta_{j_0}(N) $. Then the number\n$\\frac{\\Gamma_{j_0}(N)}{\\Delta_{j_0}(N)} $ of resonances grows only\nsub-extensively in $N$. This approach allows to recover the multifractal\nspectrum of the Generalized-Rosenzweig-Potter (GRP) Matrix model [V.E.\nKravtsov, I.M. Khaymovich, E. Cuevas and M. Amini, New. J. Phys. 17, 122002\n(2015)]. We then consider the L\\'evy generalization of the GRP Matrix model,\nwhere the off-diagonal matrix elements are drawn with an heavy-tailed\ndistribution of L\\'evy index $1<\\mu<2$ : the dynamics is then governed by a\nstretched exponential of exponent $\\beta=\\frac{2 (\\mu-1)}{\\mu}$ and the\nmultifractal properties of eigenstates are explicitly computed.\n", "  The multitude of excitations of the fractional quantum Hall state are very\naccurately understood, microscopically, as excitations of composite fermions\nacross their Landau-like $\\Lambda$ levels. In particular, the dispersion of the\ncomposite fermion exciton, which is the lowest energy spin conserving neutral\nexcitation, displays filling-factor-specific minima called \"magnetoroton\"\nminima. Simon and Halperin employed the Chern-Simons field theory of composite\nfermions [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 48}, 17368 (1993)] to predict the magnetoroton\nminima positions. Recently, Golkar \\emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 117},\n216403 (2016)] have modeled the neutral excitations as deformations of the\ncomposite fermion Fermi sea, which results in a prediction for the positions of\nthe magnetoroton minima. Using methods of the microscopic composite fermion\ntheory we calculate the positions of the roton minima for filling factors up to\n5/11 along the sequence $s/(2s+1)$ and find them to be in reasonably good\nagreement with both the Chern-Simons field theory of composite fermions and\nGolkar \\emph{et al.}'s theory. We also find that the positions of the roton\nminima are insensitive to the microscopic interaction in agreement with Golkar\n\\emph{et al.}'s theory. As a byproduct of our calculations, we obtain the\ncharge and neutral gaps for the fully spin polarized states along the sequence\n$s/(2s\\pm 1)$ in the lowest Landau level and the $n=1$ Landau level of\ngraphene.\n", "  The triumph of heat engines is their ability to convert the disordered energy\nof thermal sources into useful mechanical motion. In recent years, much effort\nhas been devoted to generalizing thermodynamic notions to the quantum regime,\npartly motivated by the promise of surpassing classical heat engines. Here, we\ninstead adopt a bottom-up approach: we propose a realistic autonomous heat\nengine that can serve as a testbed for quantum effects in the context of\nthermodynamics. Our model draws inspiration from actual piston engines and is\nbuilt from closed-system Hamiltonians and weak bath coupling terms. We\nanalytically derive the performance of the engine in the classical regime via a\nset of nonlinear Langevin equations. In the quantum case, we perform numerical\nsimulations of the master equation. Finally, we perform a dynamic and\nthermodynamic analysis of the engine's behaviour for several parameter regimes\nin both the classical and quantum case, and find that the latter exhibits a\nconsistently lower efficiency due to additional noise.\n", "  We consider the problem of characterizing the set of input-output\ncorrelations that can be generated by an arbitrarily given quantum measurement.\nOur main result is to provide a closed-form, full characterization of such a\nset for any qubit measurement, and to discuss its geometrical interpretation.\nAs applications, we further specify our results to the cases of real and\ncomplex symmetric, informationally complete measurements and mutually unbiased\nbases of a qubit, in the presence of isotropic noise. Our results provide the\noptimal device-independent tests of quantum measurements.\n", "  It is first shown that the Dirac's equation in a relativistic frame could be\nmodified to allow discrete time, in agreement to a recently published upper\nbound. Next, an exact self-adjoint $4\\times 4$ relativistic time operator for\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles is found and the time eigenstates for the\nnon-relativistic case are obtained and discussed. Results confirm the quantum\nmechanical speculation that particles can indeed occupy negative energy levels\nwith vanishingly small but non-zero probablity, contrary to the general\nexpectation from classical physics. Hence, Wolfgang Pauli's objection regarding\nthe existence of a self-adjoint time operator is fully resolved. It is shown\nthat using the time operator, a bosonic field referred here to as energons may\nbe created, whose number state representations in non-relativistic momentum\nspace can be explicitly found.\n", "  We explore the effects of finite temperature on the dynamics of Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) after it is released from the confining potential. In\naddition, we examine the variation in the expansion dynamics of the BECs as the\nconfining potential is transformed from a multiply to a simply connected\ngeometry. To include the effects of finite temperatures we use the frozen\nthermal cloud approximation, and observe unique features of the condensate\ndensity distribution when released from the confining potential. We find that\nat $T\\neq 0$, during the initial stages of expansion, the multiply connected\ncondensate has more pronounced interference rings compared to the case of zero\ntemperature. Such difference in the dynamical evolution is also evident for\nsimply connected condensates.\n", "  We study the class of vacuum (Ricci flat) six-dimensional spacetimes\nadmitting a non-degenerate multiple Weyl aligned null direction l, thus being\nof Weyl type II or more special. Subject to an additional assumption on the\nasymptotic fall-off of the Weyl tensor, we prove that these spacetimes can be\ncompletely classified in terms of the two eigenvalues of the (asymptotic) twist\nmatrix of l and of a discrete parameter $U^0=\\pm 1/2, 0$. All solutions turn\nout to be Kerr-Schild spacetimes of type D and reduce to a family of\n\"generalized\" Myers-Perry metrics (which include limits and analytic\ncontinuations of the original Myers-Perry black hole metric, such as certain\nNUT spacetimes). A special subcase corresponds to twisting solutions with zero\nshear. In passing, limits connecting various branches of solutions are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  The small-$x$ gluon in global fits of parton distributions is affected by\nlarge uncertainties from the lack of direct experimental constraints. In this\nwork we provide a precision determination of the small-$x$ gluon from the\nexploitation of forward charm production data provided by LHCb for three\ndifferent centre-of-mass (CoM) energies: 5~TeV, 7~TeV and 13~TeV. The LHCb\nmeasurements are included in the PDF fit by means of normalized distributions\nand cross-section ratios between data taken at different CoM values, $R_{13/7}$\nand $R_{13/5}$. We demonstrate that forward charm production leads to a\nreduction of the PDF uncertainties of the gluon down to $x\\simeq 10^{-6}$ by up\nto an order of magnitude, with implications for high-energy colliders, cosmic\nray physics and neutrino astronomy.\n", "  Recently, several studies have discovered a strong discrepancy between the\nlarge-scale clustering biases of two subsamples of galaxy clusters at the same\nhalo mass, split by their average projected membership distances\n$R_{\\mathrm{mem}}$. The level of this discrepancy significantly exceeds the\nmaximum halo assembly bias signal predicted by LCDM. In this study, we explore\nwhether some of the clustering bias differences could be caused by biases in\n$R_{\\mathrm{mem}}$ due to projection effects from other systems along the\nline-of-sight. We thoroughly investigate the halo assembly bias of the\nphotometrically-detected redMaPPer clusters in SDSS, by defining a new variant\nof the average membership distance estimator $\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$ that is\nmore robust against projection effects in the cluster membership\nidentification. Using the angular mark correlation functions of clusters, we\nshow that the large-scale bias differences when splitting by $R_{\\mathrm{mem}}$\ncan be largely attributed to such projection effects. After splitting by\n$\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$, the anomalously large signal is reduced, giving a\nratio of $1.02\\pm0.14$ between the two clustering biases as measured from weak\nlensing. Using a realistic mock cluster catalog, we predict that the bias ratio\nbetween two $\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$-split subsamples should be $<1.10$,\nwhich is at least 60% weaker than the maximum halo assembly bias signal (1.24)\nwhen split by halo concentration. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the\nlevel of halo assembly bias exhibited by redMaPPer clusters in SDSS is\nconsistent with the LCDM prediction. With a ten-fold increase in cluster\nnumbers, deeper ongoing surveys will enable a more robust detection of halo\nassembly bias. Our findings also have important implications for how projection\neffects and their impact on cluster cosmology can be quantified in photometric\ncluster catalogs.\n", "  We introduce a category $\\mathcal O$ of representations of the elliptic\nquantum group associated with $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ with well-behaved $q$-character\ntheory. We derive separation of variables relations for asymptotic\nrepresentations in the Grothendieck ring of this category. Baxter $Q$-operators\nare obtained as transfer matrices for asymptotic representations and obey\n$TQ$-relations as a consequence of the relations in $K_0(\\mathcal O)$.\n", "  The \"dynamical mismatch\" observed in quantum systems in the semiclassical\nregime challenge the Pilot wave model. Indeed the dynamics and properties of\nsuch systems depend on the trajectories of the classically equivalent system,\nwhereas the de Broglie-Bohm trajectories are generically non-classical.\\ In\nthis work we examine the situation for the model favoured by de Broglie, the\ntheory of the Double Solution (DS). We will see that the original DS model\napplied to semiclassical systems is also prone to the dynamical mismatch.\\\nHowever we will argue that the DS theory can be modified in order to yield\npropagation of the singularity in accord with the underlying classical dynamics\nof semiclassical systems.\n", "  Multilayer van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructures assembled by diverse\natomically thin layers have demonstrated a wide range of fascinating phenomena\nand novel applications. Understanding the interlayer coupling and its\ncorrelation effect is paramount for designing novel vdWs heterostructures with\ndesirable physical properties. Using a detailed theoretical study of 2D\nMoS2-graphene (GR)-based heterostructures based on state-of-the-art hybrid\ndensity functional theory, we reveal that for 2D few-layer heterostructures,\nvdWs forces between neighboring layers depend on the number of layers. Compared\nto that in bilayer, the interlayer coupling in trilayer vdW heterostructures\ncan significantly be enhanced by stacking the third layer, directly supported\nby short interlayer separations and more interfacial charge transfer. The\ntrilayer shows strong light absorption over a wide range (<700 nm), making it\nvery potential for solar energy harvesting and conversion. Moreover, the Dirac\npoint of GR and band gaps of each layer and trilayer can be readily tuned by\nexternal electric field, verifying multilayer vdWs heterostructures with unqiue\noptoelectronic properties found by experiments. These results suggest that\ntuning the vdWs interaction, as a new design parameter, would be an effective\nstrategy for devising particular 2D multilayer vdWs heterostructures to meet\nthe demands in various applications.\n", "  We show theoretically that a thermoelectric heat engine, operating\nexclusively due to quantum-mechanical interference, can reach optimal\nlinear-response performance. A chiral edge state implementation of a\nclose-to-optimal heat engine is proposed in an electronic Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer with a mesoscopic capacitor coupled to one arm. We demonstrate\nthat the maximum power and corresponding efficiency can reach 90\\% and 83\\%,\nrespectively, of the theoretical maximum. The proposed heat engine can be\nrealized with existing experimental techniques and has a performance robust\nagainst moderate dephasing.\n", "  The efficiency of a free-electron laser can be enhanced by sustaining the\ngrowth of the radiation power beyond the initial saturation. One notable method\nis undulator tapering, which involves the variation of the gap height and/or\nthe period along the undulator. Another method is the introduction of phase\njumps, using phase-shifting chicanes in the drift sections separating the\nundulator segments. In this article, we develop a physics model of this phase\njump method, and verify it with numerical simulations. The model elucidates the\nenergy extraction process in the longitudinal phase space. The main ingredient\nis the microbunch deceleration cycle, which enables the microbunched electron\nbeam to decelerate and radiate coherently beyond the initial saturation. The\nponderomotive bucket is stationary, and energy can even be extracted from\nelectrons outside the bucket. The model addresses the selection criteria for\nthe phase jump values, and the requirement on the undulator segment length. It\nalso describes the mechanism of the final saturation. In addition, we discuss\nthe similarities and differences between the phase jump method and undulator\ntapering, by comparing our phase jump model to the classic\nKroll-Morton-Rosenbluth model.\n", "  The superconducting LHC magnets are coupled with an electronic monitoring\nsystem which records and analyses voltage time series reflecting their\nperformance. A currently used system is based on a range of preprogrammed\ntriggers which launches protection procedures when a misbehavior of the magnets\nis detected. All the procedures used in the protection equipment were designed\nand implemented according to known working scenarios of the system and are\nupdated and monitored by human operators.\n  This paper proposes a novel approach to monitoring and fault protection of\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) superconducting magnets which employs\nstate-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms. Consequently, the authors of the\npaper decided to examine the performance of LSTM recurrent neural networks for\nmodeling of voltage time series of the magnets. In order to address this\nchallenging task different network architectures and hyper-parameters were used\nto achieve the best possible performance of the solution. The regression\nresults were measured in terms of RMSE for different number of future steps and\nhistory length taken into account for the prediction. The best result of\nRMSE=0.00104 was obtained for a network of 128 LSTM cells within the internal\nlayer and 16 steps history buffer.\n", "  We investigate the prospects of controlling charge-exchange in ultracold\ncollisions of heteroisotopic combinations of atoms and ions of the same\nelement. The treatment, readily applicable to alkali or alkanine-earth metals,\nis illustrated in the process $^9$Be$^{+}$ + $^{10}$Be $\\leftrightarrow$\n$^{9}$Be + $^{10}$Be$^{+}$, which exhibits favorable electronic, nuclear, and\nhyperfine structure. Feshbach resonances are obtained from quantum scattering\ncalculations in a standard coupled-channel formalism with non-BO terms\noriginating from the nuclear kinetic operator. Near a narrow resonance\npredicted at 322 G, we find the charge-exchange rate coefficient to rise from\npractically zero to values larger than $10^{-12}$ cm$^3$/s. Our results suggest\ncontrollable charge-exchange reactions between different isotopes of suitable\natom-ion pairs with potential applications to quantum systems engineered to\nstudy charge diffusion in trapped cold atom-ion mixtures and emulate many-body\nphysics.\n", "  We investigate the switching of the coherent emission mode of a bimodal\nmicrocavity device, occurring when the pump power is varied. We compare\nexperimental data to theoretical results and identify the underlying mechanism\nto be based on the competition between the effective gain on the one hand and\nthe intermode kinetics on the other. When the pumping is ramped up, above a\nthreshold the mode with the largest effective gain starts to emit coherent\nlight, corresponding to lasing. In contrast, in the limit of strong pumping it\nis the intermode kinetics that determines which mode acquires a large\noccupation and shows coherent emission. We point out that this latter mechanism\nis akin to the equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of massive bosons. Thus,\nthe mode switching in our microcavity device can be viewed as a minimal\ninstance of Bose-Einstein condensation of photons. We, moreover, show that the\nswitching from one cavity mode to the other occurs always via an intermediate\nphase where both modes are emitting coherent light and that it is associated\nwith both superthermal intensity fluctuations and strong anticorrelations\nbetween both modes.\n", "  A measurement of electroweak-induced production of W gamma and two jets is\nperformed, where the W boson decays leptonically. The data used in the analysis\ncorrespond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns collected by\nthe CMS experiment in sqrt(s) = 8 TeV proton-proton collisions produced at the\nLHC. Candidate events are selected with exactly one muon or electron, missing\ntransverse momentum, one photon, and two jets with large rapidity separation.\nAn excess over the hypothesis of the standard model without electroweak\nproduction of W gamma with two jets is observed with a significance of 2.7\nstandard deviations. The cross section measured in the fiducial region is 10.8\n+/- 4.1 (stat) +/- 3.4 (syst) +/- 0.3 (lumi) fb, which is consistent with the\nstandard model electroweak predictions. The total cross section for W gamma\nproduction in association with 2 jets in the same fiducial region is measured\nto be 23.2 +/- 4.3 (stat) +/- 1.7 (syst) +/- 0.6 (lumi) fb, which is consistent\nwith the standard model prediction from the combination of electroweak- and\nquantum chromodynamics-induced processes. No deviations are observed from the\nstandard model predictions and experimental limits on anomalous quartic gauge\ncouplings f[M, 0-7] / Lambda^4, f[T, 0-2] / Lambda^4, and f[T, 5-7] / Lambda^4\nare set at 95% confidence level.\n", "  We consider co-rotational wave maps from the $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski\nspace into the $d$-sphere for $d\\geq 3$ odd. This is an energy-supercritical\nmodel which is known to exhibit finite-time blowup via self-similar solutions.\nBased on a method developed by the second author and Sch\\\"orkhuber, we prove\nthe asymptotic nonlinear stability of the \"ground-state\" self-similar solution.\n", "  The LIGO-VIRGO collaboration has detected directly on Earth the gravitational\nwave signals generated by the collision and the merger of two massive black\nholes at astronomical distance. This major discovery opens up the way to\nGravitational Astronomy, which should revolutionize our comprehension of the\nstructure of the Universe at large scales, with notably the mechanisms of\nformation of black holes and their role in the evolution of the Universe, the\nlikely emergence of a multi-messenger astronomy joint with electromagnetic\nradiation, and a better appraisal of the status of general relativity with\nrespect to other fundamental interactions. The theoretical and numerical works\non the two-body problem in general relativity play a very important role when\ndeciphering and interpreting the gravitational wave signals.\n", "  We report a new kagome quantum spin liquid candidate Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$FBr,\nwhich does not experience any phase transition down to 50 mK, more than three\norders lower than the antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature ($\\sim$ 200 K).\nA clear gap opening at low temperature is observed in the uniform spin\nsusceptibility obtained from $^{19}$F nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.\nWe observe the characteristic magnetic field dependence of the gap as expected\nfor fractionalized spin-1/2 spinon excitations. Our experimental results\nprovide firm evidence for spin fractionalization in a topologically ordered\nspin system, resembling charge fractionalization in the fractional quantum Hall\nstate.\n", "  We reformulate differential equations (DEs) for Feynman integrals to avoid\ndoubled propagators in intermediate steps. External momentum derivatives are\ndressed with loop momentum derivatives to form tangent vectors to unitarity cut\nsurfaces, in a way inspired by unitarity-compatible IBP reduction. For the\none-loop box, our method directly produces the final DEs without any\nintegration-by-parts reduction. We further illustrate the method by deriving\nmaximal-cut level differential equations for two-loop nonplanar five-point\nintegrals, whose exact expressions are yet unknown. We speed up the computation\nusing finite field techniques and rational function reconstruction.\n", "  Carbon nanotubes provide a rare access point into the plasmon physics of\none-dimensional electronic systems. By assembling purified nanotubes into\nuniformly sized arrays, we show that they support coherent plasmon resonances,\nthat these plasmons enhance and hybridize with phonons, and that the\nphonon-plasmon resonances have quality factors as high as 10. Because coherent\nnanotube plasmonics can strengthen light-matter interactions, it provides a\ncompelling platform for surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy and tunable,\nhigh-performance optical devices at the nanometer scale.\n", "  Technological civilizations may rely upon large-scale photovoltaic arrays to\nharness energy from their host star. Photovoltaic materials, such as silicon,\npossess distinctive spectral features, including an \"artificial edge\" that is\ncharacteristically shifted in wavelength shortwards of the \"red edge\" of\nvegetation. Future observations of reflected light from exoplanets would be\nable to detect both natural and artificial edges photometrically, if a\nsignificant fraction of the planet's surface is covered by vegetation or\nphotovoltaic arrays respectively. The stellar energy thus tapped can be\nutilized for terraforming activities by transferring heat and light from the\nday side to the night side on tidally locked exoplanets, thereby producing\ndetectable artifacts.\n", "  We present a self-consistent quantum optics approach to calculating the\nsurface enhanced Raman spectrum of molecules coupled to arbitrarily shaped\nplasmonic systems. Our treatment is intuitive to use and provides fresh\nanalytical insight into the physics of the Raman scattering near metallic\nsurfaces and can be applied to a wide range of geometries including resonators,\nwaveguides, as well as hybrid photonic-plasmonic systems. Our general theory\ndemonstrates that the detected Raman spectrum originates from an interplay\nbetween nonlinear light generation and propagation. Counter intuitively, at the\nnonlinear generation stage, we show that the Stokes (anti-Stokes) signal at the\nmolecule location depends on the plasmonic enhancements, through the local\ndensity of photon states (LDOS), at the anti-Stokes (Stokes) frequency.\nHowever, when propagating from the vibrating molecule to the far field, the\nStokes (anti-Stokes) emission experiences a plasmonic enhancement at the Stokes\n(anti-Stokes) frequency, as expected. We identify the limits of the commonly\nknown E^4 electric-field rule for Raman signal enhancement near plasmonic\nsurfaces at low pump powers, as well as a different E^8 rule at high pump\npowers, and we clarify the role of the LDOS. Our theory uses a generalized\nquantum master equation where the plasmonic system is treated as an\nenvironmental bath that is described through the photonic Green function of the\nmedium. Therefore, any electrodynamics related physics, such as quenching and\npropagation, are self-consistently included in the model. The presented\nformalism is also capable of spatially describing the full Raman response in a\nsimple analytical way, which is typically not possible using simpler coupled\nmode theories, even if one adopts a quantum picture.\n", "  Quasicrystals are frequently encountered in condensed matter. They are\nimportant candidates for equilibrium phases from the atomic scale to the\nnanoscale. Here, we investigate the computational self-assembly of four\nquasicrystals in a single model system of identical particles interacting with\na tunable isotropic pair potential. We reproduce a known icosahedral\nquasicrystal and report a decagonal quasicrystal, a dodecagonal quasicrystal,\nand an octagonal quasicrystal. The quasicrystals have low coordination number\nor occur in systems with mesoscale density variations. We also report a network\ngel phase.\n", "  A non-singular cosmological bounce in the Einstein frame can only take place\nif the Null Energy Condition (NEC) is violated. We explore situations where a\nsingle scalar field drives the NEC violation and derive the constraints imposed\nby demanding tree level unitarity on a cosmological background. We then focus\non the explicit constraints that arise in P(X) theories and show that\nconstraints from perturbative unitarity make it impossible for the NEC\nviolation to occur within the region of validity of the effective field theory\nwithout also involving irrelevant operators that arise at a higher scale that\nwould enter from integrating out more massive degrees of freedom. Within the\ncontext of P(X) theories we show that including such operators allows for a\nbounce that does not manifestly violate tree level unitarity, but at the price\nof either imposing a shift symmetry or involving technically unnatural small\noperator coefficients within the low-energy effective field theory.\n", "  Silicon vacancy (SiV) centers in diamonds have emerged as a very promising\ncandidate for quantum emitter due to their narrow emission line resulting in\ntheir indistinguishability. While many different quantum emitters have already\nbeen used for excitation of various propagating plasmonic modes, the\ncorresponding exploitation of SiV centers remained so far uncharted territory.\nHere, we report on excitation of surface plasmon modes supported by silver\nnanowires using SiV centers in nanodiamonds. The coupling of SiV center\nfluorescence to surface plasmons is observed, when a nanodiamond situated close\nto a nanowire is illuminated by the pump, as radiated emission from the distal\nnanowire end. The effect of coupling is also seen as a change in the SiV center\nlifetime. Finally, we discuss possible avenues for strengthening the SiV center\ncoupling to surface plasmon modes.\n", "  We present the first results from the ongoing LAGER project (Lyman Alpha\nGalaxies in the Epoch of Reionization), which is the largest narrowband survey\nfor $z \\sim$ 7 galaxies to date. Using a specially built narrowband filter\nNB964 for the superb large-area Dark-Energy Camera (DECam) on the NOAO/CTIO 4m\nBlanco telescope, LAGER has collected 34 hours NB964 narrowband imaging data in\nthe 3 deg$^2$ COSMOS field. We have identified 23 Lyman Alpha Emitter (LAE)\ncandidates at $z$ = 6.9 in the central 2-deg$^2$ region, where DECam and public\nCOSMOS multi-band images exist. The resulting luminosity function can be\ndescribed as a Schechter function modified by a significant excess at the\nbright end (4 galaxies with $L_{Ly\\alpha} \\sim $ 10$^{43.4\\pm0.2}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$). The number density at $L_{Ly\\alpha}\\sim$ 10$^{43.4\\pm0.2}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ is little changed from z= 6.6, while at fainter $L_{Ly\\alpha}$ it is\nsubstantially reduced. Overall, we see a fourfold reduction in Ly$\\alpha$\nluminosity density from $z$ = 5.7 to 6.9. Combined with a more modest evolution\nof the continuum UV luminosity density, this suggests a factor of $\\sim 3$\nsuppression of Ly$\\alpha$ by radiative transfer through the $z \\sim$ 7\nintergalactic medium (IGM). It indicates an IGM neutral fraction $x_{HI}$\n$\\sim$ 0.4--0.6 (assuming Ly$\\alpha$ velocity offsets of 100-200 km s$^{-1}$).\nThe changing shape of the Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity function between $z\\lesssim\n6.6$ and $z=6.9$ supports the hypothesis of ionized bubbles in a patchy\nreionization at $z\\sim$ 7.\n", "  We investigate the generation of magnonic thermal spin currents and their\nmode selective spin transport across interfaces in insulating, compensated\nferrimagnet/normal metal bilayer systems. The spin Seebeck effect signal\nexhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence with two sign changes of the\ndetected voltage signals. Using different ferrimagnetic garnets, we demonstrate\nthe universality of the observed complex temperature dependence of the spin\nSeebeck effect. To understand its origin, we systematically vary the interface\nbetween the ferrimagnetic garnet and the metallic layer, and by using different\nmetal layers we establish that interface effects play a dominating role. They\ndo not only modify the magnitude of the spin Seebeck effect signal but in\nparticular also alter its temperature dependence. By varying the temperature,\nwe can select the dominating magnon mode and we analyze our results to reveal\nthe mode selective interface transmission probabilities for different magnon\nmodes and interfaces. The comparison of selected systems reveals\nsemi-quantitative details of the interfacial coupling depending on the\nmaterials involved, supported by the obtained field dependence of the signal.\n", "  We investigate the Anderson localization in non-Hermitian\nAubry-Andr\\'e-Harper (AAH) models with imaginary potentials added to lattice\nsites to represent the physical gain and loss during the interacting processes\nbetween the system and environment. By checking the mean inverse participation\nratio (MIPR) of the system, we find that different configurations of physical\ngain and loss have very different impacts on the localization phase transition\nin the system. In the case with balanced physical gain and loss added in an\nalternate way to the lattice sites, the critical region (in the case with\np-wave superconducting pairing) and the critical value (both in the situations\nwith and without p-wave pairing) for the Anderson localization phase transition\nwill be significantly reduced, which implies an enhancement of the localization\nprocess. However, if the system is divided into two parts with one of them\ncoupled to physical gain and the other coupled to the corresponding physical\nloss, the transition process will be impacted only in a very mild way. Besides,\nwe also discuss the situations with imbalanced physical gain and loss and find\nthat the existence of random imaginary potentials in the system will also\naffect the localization process while constant imaginary potentials will not.\n", "  We explore the effects of asymmetry of hopping parameters between double\nparallel quantum dots and the leads on the conductance and a possibility of\nlocal magnetic moment formation in this system using functional renormalization\ngroup approach with the counterterm. We demonstrate a possibility of a quantum\nphase transition to a local moment regime (so called singular Fermi liquid\n(SFL) state) for various types of hopping asymmetries and discuss respective\ngate voltage dependences of the conductance. It is shown, that depending on the\ntype of the asymmetry, the system can demonstrate either a first order quantum\nphase transition to SFL state, accompanied by a discontinuous change of the\nconductance, similarly to the symmetric case, or the second order quantum phase\ntransition, in which the conductance is continuous and exhibits Fano-type\nasymmetric resonance near the transition point. A semi-analytical explanation\nof these different types of conductance behavior is presented.\n", "  This Letter presents a search for new physics manifested as anomalous triple\ngauge boson couplings in WW and WZ diboson production in proton-proton\ncollisions. The search is performed using events containing a W boson that\ndecays leptonically and a W or Z boson whose decay products are merged into a\nsingle reconstructed jet. The data, collected at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19 inverse\nfemtobarns. No evidence for anomalous triple gauge couplings is found and the\nfollowing 95% confidence level limits are set on their values: lambda ([-0.011,\n0.011]), Delta kappa[gamma] ([-0.044, 0.063]), and Delta g[1,Z] ([-0.0087,\n0.024]). These limits are also translated into their effective field theory\nequivalents: c[WWW] / Lambda^2 ([-2.7, 2.7] TeV^{-2}), c[B] / Lambda^2 ([-14,\n17] TeV^{-2}), and c[W] / Lambda^2 ([-2.0, 5.7] TeV^{-2}).\n", "  The KATRIN experiment aims to determine the absolute neutrino mass by\nmeasuring the endpoint region of the tritium $\\beta$ spectrum. As a large-scale\nexperiment with a sharp energy resolution, high source luminosity and low\nbackground it may also be capable of testing certain theories of neutrino\ninteractions beyond the standard model (SM). An example of a non-SM interaction\nare right-handed currents mediated by right-handed W bosons in the left-right\nsymmetric model (LRSM). In this extension of the SM, an additional\nSU(2)$_\\mathrm R$ symmetry in the high-energy limit is introduced, which\nnaturally includes sterile neutrinos and predicts the seesaw mechanism. In\ntritium $\\beta$ decay, this leads to an additional term from interference\nbetween left- and right-handed interactions, which enhances or suppresses\ncertain regions near the endpoint of the beta spectrum. In this work, the\nsensitivity of KATRIN to right-handed currents is estimated for the scenario of\na light sterile neutrino with a mass of some eV. This has been performed with a\nBayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The simulations show\nthat in principle KATRIN is able to set sterile neutrino mass-dependent limits\non the interference strength. Thereby, the sensitivity is significantly\nincreased if the $Q$ value of the $\\beta$ decay can be sufficiently\nconstrained. However, the sensitivity is not high enough to improve current\nupper limits from right-handed W boson searches at the LHC.\n", "  We present the results of a calculation of recombination coefficients for\nO^{2+} + e^- using an intermediate coupling treatment that fully accounts for\nthe dependence of the distribution of population among the ground levels of\nO^{2+} on electron density and temperature. The calculation is extended down to\nlow electron temperatures where dielectronic recombination arising from Rydberg\nstates converging on the O^{2+} ground levels is an important process. The\ndata, which consist of emission coefficients for 8889 recombination lines and\nrecombination coefficients for the ground and metastable states of O^+ are in\nCases A, B and C, and are organised as a function of the electron temperature\nand number density, as well as wavelength. An interactive fortran 77 data\nserver is also provided as an accessory for mining the line emission\ncoefficients and obtaining Lagrange interpolated values for any choice of the\ntwo variables between the explicitly provided values for any set of\nwavelengths. Some illustrations of the application of the new data to nebular\nobservations are also provided.\n", "  We present the first results of the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey of\nthe interacting galaxy system, NGC4631 and NGC4656. From the maps of resolved\nstellar populations, we identify 11 dwarf galaxies (including already-known\ndwarfs) in the outer region of NGC4631 and the two tidal stellar streams around\nNGC4631, named Stream SE and Stream NW, respectively. This paper describes the\nfundamental properties of these tidal streams. Based on the tip of red giant\nbranch method and the Bayesian statistics, we find that StreamSE (7.10 Mpc in\nExpected a posteriori, EAP, with the 90% credible intervals of [6.22, 7.29]\nMpc) and StreamNW (7.91 Mpc in EAP with the 90% credible intervals of [6.44,\n7.97] Mpc) are located in front of and behind NGC4631, respectively. We also\ncalculate the metallicity distribution of stellar streams by comparing the\nmember stars with theoretical isochrones on the color-magnitude diagram. We\nfind that both streams have the same stellar population based on the Bayesian\nmodel selection method, suggesting that they originated from a tidal\ninteraction between NGC4631 and a single dwarf satellite. The expected\nprogenitor has a positively skewed metallicity distribution function with\n[M/H]_EAP=-0.92 with the 90% credible intervals of [-1.46, -0.51]. The stellar\nmass of the progenitor is estimated as 3.7 x 10e+8 Msun with the 90% credible\nintervals of [5.8 x 10e+6, 8.6 x 10e+9] Msun based on the mass-metallicity\nrelation for Local group dwarf galaxies. This is in good agreement with an\ninitial stellar mass of the progenitor presumed in the previous N-body\nsimulation.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the singular isothermal sphere lensing model that\nhas a spherically symmetric power-law mass distribution $\\rho_{tot}(r)\\sim\nr^{-\\gamma}$. We investigate whether the mass density power-law index $\\gamma$\nis cosmologically evolutionary by using the strong gravitational lensing (SGL)\nobservation, in combination with other cosmological observations. We also check\nwhether the constraint result of $\\gamma$ is affected by the cosmological\nmodel, by considering several simple dynamical dark energy models. We find that\nthe constraint on $\\gamma$ is mainly decided by the SGL observation and\nindependent of the cosmological model, and we find no evidence for the\nevolution of $\\gamma$ from the SGL observation.\n", "  This theoretical proposal investigates how resonant interactions occurring\nwhen a harmonic oscillator is fed with a stream of entangled qubits allow us to\nstabilize squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator. We show that the\nproperties of the squeezed state stabilized by this engineered reservoir,\nincluding the squeezing strength, can be tuned at will through the parameters\nof the \"input\" qubits, albeit in tradeoff with the convergence rate. We also\ndiscuss the influence of the type of entanglement in the input, from a pairwise\ncase to a more widely distributed case. This paper can be read in two ways:\neither as a proposal to stabilize squeezed states, or as a step towards\ntreating quantum systems with time-entangled reservoir inputs.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the mixed-field orientation of molecules\nwithout rotational symmetry. The time-dependent one-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional orientation of a thermal ensemble of\n6-chloropyridazine-3-carbonitrile molecules in combined linearly or\nelliptically polarized laser fields and tilted dc electric fields is computed.\nThe results are in good agreement with recent experimental results of\none-dimensional orientation for weak dc electric fields [J. Chem. Phys. 139,\n234313 (2013)]. Moreover, they predict that using elliptically polarized laser\nfields or strong dc fields three-dimensional orientation is obtained. The\nfield-dressed dynamics of excited rotational states is characterized by highly\nnon-adiabatic effects. We analyze the sources of these non-adiabatic effects\nand investigate their impact on the mixed-field orientation for different field\nconfigurations in mixed-field-orientation experiments.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the propagation of three-dimensional\nextremely short electromagnetic pulses (a.k.a. light bullets) through a Bragg\nmedium containing an immersed array of carbon nanotubes. We demonstrate the\npossible stable propagation of such light bullets. In particular, our results\nsuggest these light bullets can carry information about the Bragg medium\nitself.\n", "  We study the magnetic properties of cylindrical ferromagnetic core -\nantiferromagnetic shell nanowires using Monte Carlo simulations and a classical\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian in order to elucidate the impact of the oxidized shell\non the magnetic properties and the magnetization reversal mechanism. We find\nthat the coupling to the antiferromagnetic shell leads to suppression of the\ncoercivity and emergence of a weak exchange bias effect. Comparison of the\nmagnetization reversal mechanism in the bare and the surface-oxidized nanowire\nreveals that the domain wall propagation and annihilation remains the dominant\nreversal mechanism in surface oxidized nanowires as in their ferromagnetic\ncounterparts. However, the interface exchange coupling introduces a secondary\nreversal mechanism activated in the central part of the wire with\ncharacteristics of coherent rotation, which acts in synergy to wall propagation\nleading to enhancement of the wall mobility. This effect is more pronounced in\nnanowires with large exchange bias values and is attributed to the\nuncompensated interface moments that act as nucleation centers for\nmagnetization reversal. Our results are in good agreement with recent\nmeasurements in Co and Co/CoO nanowires.\n", "  Aims. Due to the fundamental importance of vortices on the photosphere, in\nthis work we aim to fully automate the process of intensity vortex\nidentification to facilitate a more robust statistical analysis of their\nproperties. Methods. Using on-disk observational data of the Fe I continuum,\nthe process of vortex identification is fully automated, for the first time in\nsolar physics, with the help of an established method from hydrodynamics\ninitially employed for the study of eddies in turbulent flows (Graftieaux et\nal. 2001). Results. We find that the expected lifetime of intensity vortices is\nmuch shorter (~ 17s) compared with previously observed magnetic bright point\nswirls. Our findings suggest that at any time there are 1.4e6 such small-scale\nintensity vortices covering about 2.8% of the total surface of the solar\nphotosphere.\n", "  The modelling of minimum bias interactions is a crucial ingredient to learn\nabout the description of soft QCD processes. It has also a significant\nrelevance for the simulation of the environment at the LHC with many concurrent\npp interactions (pileup). The ATLAS collaboration has provided new measurements\nof the inclusive charged-particle multiplicity and its dependence on transverse\nmomentum and pseudorapidity in special data sets with low LHC beam currents,\nrecorded at center of mass energies of 8 TeV and 13 TeV. The measurements use\ncharged-particle selections with minimum transverse momentum of both 100 MeV\nand 500 MeV, and various phase-space regions characterized by low and high\ncharged-particle multiplicities.\n", "  DGRAV News:\n  We hear that ....\n  DGRAV student travel grants\n  Research Briefs:\n  The Discovery of GW170104\n  Obituary:\n  Remembering Vishu\n  Remembering Cecile DeWitt-Morette\n  Remembering Larry Shepley\n  Remembering Marcus Ansorg\n  Conference Reports:\n  EGM20\n", "  Bursts in human and natural activities are highly clustered in time,\nsuggesting that these activities are influenced by previous events within the\nsocial or natural system. Bursty behavior in the real world conveys information\nof underlying diffusion processes, which have been the focus of diverse\nscientific communities from online social media to criminology and\nepidemiology. However, universal components of real-world diffusion dynamics\nthat cut across disciplines remain unexplored. Here, we introduce a wide range\nof diffusion processes across disciplines and propose universal components of\ndiffusion frameworks. We apply these components to diffusion-based studies of\nhuman disease spread, through a case study of the vector-borne disease dengue.\nThe proposed universality of diffusion can motivate transdisciplinary research\nand provide a fundamental framework for diffusion models.\n", "  An intense laser field in the high-frequency regime drives carriers in\ngraphene nanoribbons (GNRs) out of equilibrium and creates\ntopologically-protected edge states. Using Floquet theory on driven GNRs, we\ncalculate the time evolution of local excitations of these edge states and show\nthat they exhibit a robust dynamics also in the presence of very localized\nlattice defects (atomic vacancies), which is characteristic of topologically\nnon-trivial behavior. We show how it is possible to control them by a modulated\nelectrostatic potential: They can be fully transmitted on the same edge,\nreflected on the opposite one, or can be split between the two edges, in\nanalogy with Hall edge states, making them promising candidates for\nflying-qubit architectures.\n", "  Electron correlations produce a rich phase diagram in the iron pnictides.\nEarlier theoretical studies on the correlation effect demonstrated how quantum\nfluctuations weaken and concurrently suppress a $C_2$-symmetric single-Q\nantiferromagnetic order and a nematic order. Here we examine the emergent\nphases near the quantum phase transition. For a $C_4$-symmetric collinear\ndouble-Q antiferromagnetic order, we show that it is accompanied by both a\ncharge order and an enhanced nematic susceptibility. Our results provide\nunderstanding for several intriguing recent experiments in hole-doped iron\narsenides, and bring out common physics that underlies the different magnetic\nphases of various iron-based superconductors.\n", "  We present new calculations of the CAT3D clumpy torus models, which now\ninclude a more physical dust sublimation model as well as AGN anisotropic\nemission. These new models allow graphite grains to persist at temperatures\nhigher than the silicate dust sublimation temperature. This produces stronger\nnear-infrared emission and bluer mid-infrared (MIR) spectral slopes. We make a\nstatistical comparison of the CAT3D model MIR predictions with a compilation of\nsub-arcsecond resolution ground-based MIR spectroscopy of 52 nearby Seyfert\ngalaxies (median distance of 36 Mpc) and 10 quasars. We focus on the AGN MIR\nspectral index $\\alpha_{MIR}$ and the strength of the 9.7 $\\mu$m silicate\nfeature $S_{Sil}$. As with other clumpy torus models, the new CAT3D models do\nnot reproduce the Seyfert galaxies with deep silicate absorption\n($S_{Sil}<-1$). Excluding those, we conclude that the new CAT3D models are in\nbetter agreement with the observed $\\alpha_{MIR}$ and $S_{Sil}$ of Seyfert\ngalaxies and quasars. We find that Seyfert 2 are reproduced with models with\nlow photon escape probabilities, while the quasars and the Seyfert 1-1.5\nrequire generally models with higher photon escape probabilities. Quasars and\nSeyfert 1-1.5 tend to show steeper radial cloud distributions and fewer clouds\nalong an equatorial line-of-sight than Seyfert 2. Introducing AGN anisotropic\nemission besides the more physical dust sublimation models alleviates the\nproblem of requiring inverted radial cloud distributions (i.e., more clouds\ntowards the outer parts of the torus) to explain the MIR spectral indices of\ntype 2 Seyferts.\n", "  Physical implementations of quantum computation must be scrutinized about\ntheir reliability under real conditions, in order to be considered as viable\ncandidates. Among the proposed models, those based on adiabatic quantum\ndynamics have shown great potential for solving specific tasks and have already\nbeen successfully implemented using superconducting devices. In this context,\nwe address the issue of how the fabrication variations are expected to affect\non average the computation results, when only dynamical effects occur. By\nsimulating the dynamics of small-scale systems, it is found a considerable\nrobustness for the computation when analyzing results obtained from ensembles\nof such machines. In addition, it is also addressed whether conditions for\nadiabaticity could be taken as quantitative measures of it. From the analysis\nof four known conditions, it is obtained that none could have such an use.\n", "  In a comment published several years ago in this Journal [J. Math. Phys. 50,\n042502 (2009)] Mitra has claimed to prove that a neutral point particle in\ngeneral relativity as described by the Schwarzschild metric must have zero\ngravitational mass, i.e. the mass parameter $M_{0}$ of a Schwarzschild black\nhole necessarily vanishes. It is shown that the purported proof is incorrect.\nThe error stems from a basic misunderstanding of the mathematical description\nof coordinate volume element in a differentiable manifold.\n", "  We provide a pedagogical approach to the problem of avoided crossings between\nelectronic molecular curves and to diabatic and adiabatic transitions when the\nnuclei of a diatomic molecule move according to classical mechanics. For\nsimplicity we restrict the analysis to only two electronic states.\n", "  The structure of the $^9$Be low-lying spectrum is studied within the cluster\nmodel $\\alpha+\\alpha+n$. In the model the total orbital momentum is fixed for\neach energy level. Thus each level is determined as a member of the spin-flip\ndoublet corresponding to the total orbital momentum ($L^\\pi=0^+, 2^+,4^+, 1^-,\n2^-,3^-, 4^-$) of the system. The Ali-Bodmer potential (model E) is applied for\nthe $\\alpha\\alpha$ interaction. We employ a local $\\alpha n$ potential which\nwas constructed to reproduce the $\\alpha-n$ scattering data. The Pauli blocking\nis simulated by the repulsive core of the $s$-wave components of these\npotentials. Configuration space Faddeev equations are used to calculate the\nenergy of the bound state ($E_{cal.}$=-1.493 MeV v.s. $E_{exp.}$=-1.5735 MeV)\nand resonances. A variant of the method of analytical continuation in the\ncoupling constant is applied to calculate the energies of low-lying levels.\nAvailable $^9$Be spectral data are satisfactorily reproduced by the proposed\nmodel.\n", "  The collisional and sticking properties of sub-mm-sized aggregates composed\nof protoplanetary dust analogue material are measured, including the\nstatistical threshold velocity between sticking and bouncing, their surface\nenergy and tensile strength within aggregate clusters. We performed an\nexperiment on the REXUS 12 suborbital rocket. The protoplanetary dust analogue\nmaterials were micrometre-sized monodisperse and polydisperse SiO2 particles\nprepared into aggregates with sizes around 120 $\\mu$m and 330 $\\mu$m,\nrespectively and volume filling factors around 0.37. During the experimental\nrun of 150 s under reduced gravity conditions, the sticking of aggregates and\nthe formation and fragmentation of clusters of up to a few millimetres in size\nwas observed. The sticking probability of the sub-mm-sized dust aggregates\ncould be derived for velocities decreasing from 22 to 3 cm/s. The transition\nfrom bouncing to sticking collisions happened at 12.7 cm/s for the smaller\naggregates composed of monodisperse particles and at 11.5 and 11.7 cm/s for the\nlarger aggregates composed of mono- and polydisperse dust particles,\nrespectively. Using the pull-off force of sub-mm-sized dust aggregates from the\nclusters, the surface energy of the aggregates composed of monodisperse dust\nwas derived to be 1.6x10-5 J/m2, which can be scaled down to 1.7x10-2 J/m2 for\nthe micrometre-sized monomer particles and is in good agreement with previous\nmeasurements for silica particles. The tensile strengths of these aggregates\nwithin the clusters were derived to be 1.9 Pa and 1.6 Pa for the small and\nlarge dust aggregates, respectively. These values are in good agreement with\nrecent tensile strength measurements for mm-sized silica aggregates. Using our\ndata on the sticking-bouncing threshold, estimates of the maximum aggregate\nsize can be given. For a minimum mass solar nebula model, aggregates can reach\nsizes of 1 cm.\n", "  We analyzed the response of NaI(Tl) to low energy nuclear recoils in the\nexperiment that is reported on here. Such detectors have been used recently to\nsearch for evidence of dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive\nparticles (WIMPs). Understanding the response of these detectors to low energy\nnuclear recoils is crucial in these searches. We have measured nuclear recoils\nand associated quenching factors (QF) for sodium recoils in the energy range of\n8 keV - 48 keV. The results are characterized by a decrease in QF as the recoil\nenergy decreases. The measured values are significantly lower than those\nreported by DAMA, but are similar to results from recent measurements. We\npresent the details of our experiment, including the neutron beam calibration,\nshielding optimization, and the experimental design and setup. The DAMA/LIBRA\ncombined modulation signal is used with the new QF values to illustrate the\nchanges to the dark matter interpretation resulting from this improved\ncharacterization of these NaI(Tl) detectors.\n", "  Kinetic equations play a major rule in modeling large systems of interacting\nparticles. Recently the legacy of classical kinetic theory found novel\napplications in socio-economic and life sciences, where processes characterized\nby large groups of agents exhibit spontaneous emergence of social structures.\nWell-known examples are the formation of clusters in opinion dynamics, the\nappearance of inequalities in wealth distributions, flocking and milling\nbehaviors in swarming models, synchronization phenomena in biological systems\nand lane formation in pedestrian traffic. The construction of kinetic models\ndescribing the above processes, however, has to face the difficulty of the lack\nof fundamental principles since physical forces are replaced by empirical\nsocial forces. These empirical forces are typically constructed with the aim to\nreproduce qualitatively the observed system behaviors, like the emergence of\nsocial structures, and are at best known in terms of statistical information of\nthe modeling parameters. For this reason the presence of random inputs\ncharacterizing the parameters uncertainty should be considered as an essential\nfeature in the modeling process. In this survey we introduce several examples\nof such kinetic models, that are mathematically described by nonlinear Vlasov\nand Fokker--Planck equations, and present different numerical approaches for\nuncertainty quantification which preserve the main features of the kinetic\nsolution.\n", "  The experiments presented aim to measure the outcome of collisions between\nsub-mm sized protoplanetary dust aggregate analogues. We also observed the\nclusters formed from these aggregates and their collision behaviour. The\nexperiments were performed at the drop tower in Bremen. The protoplanetary dust\nanalogue materials were micrometre-sized monodisperse and polydisperse SiO$_2$\nparticles prepared into aggregates with sizes between 120~$\\mu$m and\n250~$\\mu$m. One of the dust samples contained aggregates that were previously\ncompacted through repeated bouncing. During three flights of 9~s of\nmicrogravity each, individual collisions between aggregates and the formation\nof clusters of up to a few millimetres in size were observed. In addition, the\ncollisions of clusters with the experiment cell walls leading to compaction or\nfragmentation were recorded. We observed collisions amongst dust aggregates and\ncollisions between dust clusters and the cell aluminium walls at speeds ranging\nfrom about 0.1 cm/s to 20 cm/s. The velocities at which sticking occurred\nranged from 0.18 to 5.0 cm/s for aggregates composed of monodisperse dust, with\nan average value of 2.1 cm/s for reduced masses ranging from 1.2x10-6 to\n1.8x10-3 g with an average value of 2.2x10-4 g. From the restructuring and\nfragmentation of clusters composed of dust aggregates colliding with the\naluminium cell walls, we derived a collision recipe for dust aggregates\n($\\sim$100 $\\mu$m) following the model of Dominik \\& Thielens (1997) developed\nfor microscopic particles. We measured a critical rolling energy of 1.8x10-13 J\nand a critical breaking energy of 3.5x10-13 J for 100 $\\mu$m-sized\nnon-compacted aggregates.\n", "  Modeling the spread of infections on networks is a well-studied and important\nfield of research. Most infection and diffusion models require a real value or\nprobability on the edges of the network as an input, but this is rarely\navailable in real-life applications. Our goal in this paper is to develop a\ngeneral framework for this task. The general model works with the most widely\nused infection models and is able to handle an arbitrary number of observations\non such processes. The model is defined as a general optimization task and a\nParticle Swarm heuristic is proposed to solve it. We evaluate the accuracy and\nspeed of the proposed method on a high variety of realistic infection\nscenarios.\n", "  In this study, micro-droplets are placed on thin, glassy, free-standing films\nwhere the Laplace pressure of the droplet deforms the free-standing film,\ncreating a bulge. The film's tension is modulated by changing temperature\ncontinuously from well below the glass transition into the melt state of the\nfilm. The contact angle of the liquid droplet with the planar film as well as\nthe angle of the bulge with the film are measured and found to be consistent\nwith the contact angles predicted by a force balance at the contact line.\n", "  Using a scanning microwave microscope, we imaged in water aluminum\ninterconnect lines buried in aluminum and silicon oxides fabricated through a\nstate-of-the-art 0.13 um SiGe BiCMOS process. The results were compared with\nthat obtained by using atomic force microscopy both in air and water. It was\nfound the images in water was degraded by only approximately 60% from that in\nair.\n", "  We successfully synthesize single crystals of the verdazyl radical\n$\\alpha$-2,3,5-Cl$_3$-V. $Ab$ $initio$ molecular orbital calculations indicate\nthat the two dominant antiferromagnetic interactions, $J_{\\rm{1}}$ and\n$J_{\\rm{2}}$ ($\\alpha =J_{\\rm{2}}/J_{\\rm{1}}\\simeq 0.56$), form an $S$ = 1/2\ndistorted square lattice. We explain the magnetic properties based on the $S$ =\n1/2 square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet using the quantum Monte Carlo\nmethod, and examine the effects of the lattice distortion and the interplane\ninteraction contribution. In the low-temperature regions below 6.4 K, we\nobserve anisotropic magnetic behavior accompanied by a phase transition to a\nmagnetically ordered state. The electron spin resonance signals exhibit\nanisotropic behavior in the temperature dependence of the resonance field and\nthe linewidth. We explain the frequency dependence of the resonance fields in\nthe ordered phase using a mean-field approximation with out-of-plane easy-axis\nanisotropy, which causes a spin-flop phase transition at approximately 0.4 T\nfor the field perpendicular to the plane. Furthermore, the anisotropic dipole\nfield provides supporting information regarding the presence of the easy-axis\nanisotropy. These results demonstrate that the lattice distortion, anisotropy,\nand interplane interaction of this model are sufficiently small that they do\nnot affect the intrinsic behavior of the $S$ = 1 / 2 square lattice Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet.\n", "  The low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) IGR J17480-2446 is an 11 Hz accreting pulsar\nlocated in the core of the globular cluster Terzan 5. This is a mildly recycled\naccreting pulsar with a peculiar evolutionary history since its total age has\nbeen suggested to be less than a few hundred Myr, despite the very old age of\nTerzan 5 (~12 Gyr). Solving the origin of this age discrepancy might be very\nvaluable because it can reveal why systems like IGR J17480-2446 are so rare in\nour Galaxy. We have performed numerical simulations (dynamical and binary\nevolution) to constrain the evolutionary history of IGR J17480-2446 . We find\nthat the binary has a high probability to be the result of close encounters,\nwith a formation mechanism compatible with the tidal capture of the donor star.\nThe result reinforces the hypothesis that IGR J17480-2446 is a binary that\nstarted mass transfer in an exceptionally recent time. We also show that\nprimordial interacting binaries in the core of Terzan 5 are strongly affected\nby a few hundred close encounters (fly-by) during their lifetime. This effect\nmight delay, accelerate or even interrupt the Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) phase.\nOur calculations show that systems of this kind can form exclusively in dense\nenvironments like globular clusters.\n", "  Magnetic moments in an ultra-thin Pt film on a ferrimagnetic insulator\nY$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) have been investigated at high magnetic fields and\nlow temperatures by means of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We\nobserved an XMCD signal due to the magnetic moments in a Pt film at the Pt\n$L_{3}$- and $L_{2}$-edges. By means of the element-specific magnetometry, we\nfound that the XMCD signal at the Pt $L_{3}$-edge gradually increases with\nincreasing the magnetic field even when the field is much greater than the\nsaturation field of YIG. Importantly, the observed XMCD intensity was found to\nbe much greater than the intensity expected from the Pauli paramagnetism of Pt\nwhen the Pt film is attached to YIG. These results imply the emergence of\ninduced paramagnetic moments in Pt on YIG and explain the characteristics of\nthe unconventional Hall effect in Pt/YIG systems.\n", "  Frequency conversion processes, such as second- and third-harmonic\ngeneration, are one of the most common effects in nonlinear optics which offer\nmany opportunities for photonics, chemistry, material science,\ncharacterization, and biosensing. Given the inherently weak nonlinear response\nof natural materials, one typically relies on optically large samples and\ncomplex phase-matching techniques to achieve nonlinear effects. A direct\ntranslation of these approaches to small dimensions, however, is extremely\nchallenging, because nonlinear effects locally comparable to the linear\nresponse cannot be induced without reaching extremely high light intensities\nleading to the material breakdown. For this reason, the quest to synthesize\nnovel materials with enhanced optical nonlinearities at moderate input\nintensities is very active nowadays. In the last decade, several approaches to\nengineering the nonlinear properties of artificial materials, metamaterials,\nand metasurfaces have been introduced. Here, we review the current state of the\nart in the field of small-scale nonlinear optics, with special emphasis on\nhigh-harmonic generation from ultrathin metasurfaces, including those based on\nplasmonic and high-index dielectric resonators, as well as semiconductor-loaded\nplasmonic metasurfaces. We discuss the role of specific electromagnetic field\nconfigurations for efficient harmonic generation, including magnetic dipole,\nFano resonance, and anapole ones. We also discuss the most recent advances in\ncontrolling the phase front profiles of generated nonlinear waves enabled by\nnonlinear metasurfaces consisting of nanoresonators with judiciously tailored\nshapes. Finally, we compare viable approaches to enhance nonlinearities without\nphase matching constraints in ultrathin metasurfaces, and offer a perspective\nand outlook on the future development of this exciting field.\n", "  Efficient collection of fluorescence from nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in\ndiamond underlies the spin-dependent optical read-out that is necessary for\nquantum information processing and enhanced sensing applications. The optical\ncollection efficiency from NVs within diamond substrates is limited primarily\ndue to the high refractive index of diamond and the non-directional dipole\nemission. Here we introduce a light collection strategy based on chirped,\ncircular dielectric gratings that can be fabricated on a bulk diamond substrate\nto redirect an emitter's far-field radiation pattern. Using a genetic\noptimization algorithm, these grating designs achieve 98.9% collection\nefficiency for the NV zero-phonon emission line, collected from the back\nsurface of the diamond with an objective of aperture 0.9. Across the broadband\nemission spectrum of the NV (600-800 nm), the chirped grating achieves 82.2%\ncollection efficiency into a numerical aperture of 1.42, corresponding to an\noil immersion objective again on the back side of the diamond. Our proposed\nbulk-dielectric grating structures are applicable to other optically active\nsolid state quantum emitters in high index host materials.\n", "  Higher security and lower failure probability have always been people's\npursuits in quantum-oblivious-key-transfer-based private query (QOKT-PQ)\nprotocols since Jacobi \\emph{et al}. [Phys. Rev. A 83, 022301 (2011)] proposed\nthe first protocol of this kind. However, higher database security generally\nhas to be obtained at the cost of a higher failure probability, and vice versa.\nRecently, based on a round-robin differential-phase-shift quantum key\ndistribution protocol, Liu \\emph{et al}. [Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron.58,\n100301 (2015)] presented a private query protocol (RRDPS-PQ protocol) utilizing\nideal single-photon signal which realizes both ideal database security and zero\nfailure probability. However, ideal single-photon source is not available\ntoday, and for large database the required pulse train is too long to\nimplement. Here, we reexamine the security of RRDPS-PQ protocol under imperfect\nsource and present an improved protocol using a special \"low-shift and\naddition\" (LSA) technique, which not only can be used to query from large\ndatabase but also retains the features of \"ideal database security\" and\n\"zero-failure\" even under weak coherent source. Finally, we generalize the LSA\ntechnique and establish a generic QOKT-PQ model in which both \"ideal database\nsecurity\" and \"zero failure\" are achieved via acceptable communications.\n", "  Dynamical interactions that take place between objects in dense stellar\nsystems lead to frequent formation of exotic stellar objects, unusual binaries,\nand systems of higher multiplicity. They are most important for the formation\nof binaries with neutron stars and black holes, which are usually\nobservationally revealed in mass-transferring binaries. Here we review the\ncurrent understanding of compact object's retention, of the metallicity\ndependence on the formation of low-mass X-ray binaries with neutron stars, and\nhow mass-transferring binaries with a black hole and a white dwarf can be\nformed. We discuss as well one old unsolved puzzle and two new puzzles posed by\nrecent observations: what descendants do ultra-compact X-ray binaries produce,\nhow are very compact triples formed, and how can black hole low-mass X-ray\nbinaries acquire non-degenerate companions?\n", "  We review the fundamentals and the recent developments in understanding of\ncommon envelope physics. We report specifically on the progress that was made\nby the consideration of the recombination energy. This energy is found to be\nresponsible for the complete envelope ejection in the case of a prompt binary\nformation, for the delayed dynamical ejections in the case of a self-regulated\nspiral-in, and for the steady recombination outflows during the transition\nbetween the plunge-in and the self-regulated spiral-in. Due to different ways\nhow the recombination affects the common envelope during fast and slow\nspiral-ins, the apparent efficiency of the orbital energy use can be different\nbetween the two types of spiral-ins by a factor of ten. We also discuss the\nobservational signatures of the common envelope events, their link a new class\nof astronomical transients, Luminous Red Novae, and to a plausible class of\nvery luminous irregular variables.\n", "  We present an improved formalism for quantum Monte Carlo calculations of\nenergy derivatives and properties (e.g. the interatomic forces), with a\nmultideterminant Jastrow-Slater function. As a function of the number $N_e$ of\nSlater determinants, the numerical scaling of $O(N_e)$ per derivative we have\nrecently reported is here lowered to $O(N_e)$ for the entire set of\nderivatives. As a function of the number of electrons $N$, the scaling to\noptimize the wave function and the geometry of a molecular system is lowered to\n$O(N^3)+O(N N_e)$, the same as computing the energy alone in the sampling\nprocess. The scaling is demonstrated on linear polyenes up to C$_{60}$H$_{62}$\nand the efficiency of the method is illustrated with the structural\noptimization of butadiene and octatetraene with Jastrow-Slater wave functions\ncomprising as many as 200000 determinants and 60000 parameters.\n", "  Wet etching is an essential and complex step in semiconductor device\nprocessing. Metal-Assisted Chemical Etching (MacEtch) is fundamentally a wet\nbut anisotropic etching method. In the MacEtch technique, there are still a\nnumber of unresolved challenges preventing the optimal fabrication of\nhigh-aspect-ratio semiconductor micro- and nanostructures, such as undesired\netching, uncontrolled catalyst movement, non-uniformity and micro-porosity in\nthe metal-free areas. Here, an optimized MacEtch process using with a\nnanostructured Au catalyst is proposed for fabrication of Si high aspect ratio\nmicrostructures. The addition of isopropanol as surfactant in the HF-H2O2 water\nsolution improves the uniformity and the control of the H2 gas release. An\nadditional KOH etching removes eventually the unwanted nanowires left by the\nMacEtch through the nanoporous catalyst film. We demonstrate the benefits of\nthe isopropanol addition for reducing the etching rate and the nanoporosity of\netched structures with a monothonical decrease as a function of the isopropanol\nconcentration.\n", "  The superconducting film of (Li1-xFex)OHFeSe is reported for the first time.\nThe thin film exhibits a small in-plane crystal mosaic of 0.22 deg, in terms of\nthe FWHM (full-width-at-half-maximum) of x-ray rocking curve, and an excellent\nout-of-plane orientation by x-ray phi-scan. Its bulk superconducting transition\ntemperature (Tc) of 42.4 K is characterized by both zero electrical resistance\nand diamagnetization measurements. The upper critical field (Hc2) is estimated\nto be 79.5 T and 443 T, respectively, for the magnetic field perpendicular and\nparallel to the ab plane. Moreover, a large critical current density (Jc) of a\nvalue over 0.5 MA/cm2 is achieved at ~20 K. Such a (Li1-xFex)OHFeSe film is\ntherefore not only important to the fundamental research for understanding the\nhigh-Tc mechanism, but also promising in the field of high-Tc superconductivity\napplication, especially in high-performance electronic devices and large\nscientific facilities such as superconducting accelerator.\n", "  Metal microstructured optical elements for grating-based X-ray phase-contrast\ninterferometry were fabricated by using an innovative approach of microcasting:\nhot embossing technology with low melting temperature (280{\\deg}C) metal alloy\nfoils and silicon etched templates. A gold-tin alloy (80w%Au / 20w%Sn) was used\nto cast micro-gratings with pitch sizes in the range of 2 to 20 micrometers and\ndepth of the structures up to 80 micrometers. The metal filling of the silicon\ntemplate strongly depends on the wetting properties of the liquid metal on the\ngroove surface. A thin metal wetting layer (20 nm of Ir or Au) was deposited\nbefore the casting in order to turn the template surface into hydrophilic with\nrespect of the melted metal alloy. Temperature and pressure of the hot\nembossing process were optimized for a complete filling of the cavities in a\nlow viscosity regime of the liquid metal, and for minimizing the shear force\nthat might damage the silicon structures for small pitch grating. The new\nmethod has relevant advantages, such as being a low cost technique, fast and\neasily scalable to large area fabrication.\n", "  We report growth of single crystals of the non-magnetic metallic delafossite\nPdRhO_{2}, comparing the results from three different methods. Complete\ncrystallographic data were obtained from single crystal X-ray diffraction, and\nelectronic structure calculations made using the refined structural parameters.\nFocused-ion beam microstructuring was used to prepare a sample for measurements\nof the in- and out-of-plane electrical resistivity, and the large observed\nanisotropy is qualitatively consistent with the cylindrical Fermi surface\npredicted by the calculations.\n", "  We estimate the extent of overshooting inwards from the bottom of the\nintershell convective zone in thermal pulses in (S)AGB stars. We find that the\nbuoyancy is so strong that any overshooting should be negligible. The\ntemperature inversion at the bottom of the convective zone adds to the\nstability of the region. Any mixing that occurs in this region is highly\nunlikely to be due to convective overshooting, and so must be due to another\nprocess.\n", "  The evolution from superconducting LiTi2O4-delta to insulating Li4Ti5O12 thin\nfilms has been studied by precisely adjusting the oxygen pressure during the\nsample fabrication process. In the superconducting LiTi2O4-delta films, with\nthe increase of oxygen pressure, the oxygen vacancies are filled, and the\nc-axis lattice constant decreases gradually. With the increase of the oxygen\npressure to a certain critical value, the c-axis lattice constant becomes\nstable, which implies that the Li4Ti5O12 phase comes into being. The process of\noxygen filling is manifested by the angular bright-field images of the scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy techniques. The temperature of\nmagnetoresistance changed from positive and negative shows a non-monotonous\nbehavior with the increase of oxygen pressure. The theoretical explanation of\nthe oxygen effects on the structure and superconductivity of LiTi2O4-delta has\nalso been discussed in this work.\n", "  We consider the Schroedinger equation with a subcritical focusing power\nnonlinearity on a noncompact metric graph, and prove that for every finite edge\nthere exists a threshold value of the mass, beyond which there exists a\npositive bound state achieving its maximum on that edge only. This bound state\nis characterized as a minimizer of the energy functional associated to the NLS\nequation, with an additional constraint (besides the mass prescription): this\nrequires particular care in proving that the minimizer satisfies the\nEuler--Lagrange equation. As a consequence, for a sufficiently large mass every\nfinite edge of the graph hosts at least one positive bound state that, owing to\nits minimality property, is orbitally stable.\n", "  In this chapter we explore a few examples of physics opportunities using the\nexisting chain of accelerators at CERN, including potential upgrades. In this\ncontext the LHC ring is also considered as a part of the injector system. The\nobjective is to find examples that constitute sensitive probes of New Physics\nthat ideally cannot be done elsewhere or can be done significantly better at\ntheCERN accelerator complex. Some of these physics opportunities may require a\nmore flexible injector complex with additional functionality than that just\nneeded to inject protons into the FCC-hh at the right energy, intensity and\nbunch structure. Therefore it is timely to discuss these options concurrently\nwith the conceptual design of the FCC-hh injector system.\n", "  The electromagnetic form factors are fundamental observables that parametrise\nthe electric and magnetic structure of hadrons and provide a key to the strong\ninteraction. The Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII) is located at the Beijng\nElectron Positron Collider (BEPCII), a symmetric $e^+e^-$ collider running at\ncenter-of-mass energies between 2.0 and 4.6 GeV. This wide energy range allows\nthe measurement of electromagnetic form factors both from direct $e^+e^-$\nannihilation and from initial-state radiation processes. Based on\n$157~\\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$ of data collected at center-of-mass energies between\n2.23 and 3.67 GeV, BESIII published results on the channel $e^+e^-\\rightarrow\np\\bar{p}$. More recently, preliminary results from the analysis of the\ninitial-state radiation process $e^+e^- \\rightarrow p\\bar{p}\\gamma$ based on\n7.41 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data have also been released. Besides nucleons, all\nhyperons in the SU(3) spin 1/2 octet and spin 3/2 decuplet are energetically\naccessible at BESIII. Preliminary results from the $e^+e^-\\rightarrow\n\\Lambda\\bar{\\Lambda}$ channel and the $e^+e^- \\rightarrow \\Lambda_c\n\\bar{\\Lambda}_c$ channel from the charmed sector are already available.\nFurthermore, a world-leading data sample for precision measurements of baryon\nform factors was collected in 2015. This data will enable the measurement of\nbaryon electromagnetic form factors with unprecedented accuracy.\n", "  A novel method utilizing Fast Neutron Resonance Transmission Radiography is\nproposed for rapid, non-destructive and quantitative determination of the\nweight fractions of oil and water in cores taken from subterranean or\nunderwater geological formations. Its ability to distinguish water from oil\nstems from the unambiguously-specific energy-dependence of the neutron\ncross-sections for the principal elemental constituents. Furthermore, the fluid\nweight fractions permit determining core porosity and oil and water\nsaturations. In this article we show results of experimental determination of\noil and water weight fractions in 10 cm thick samples of Berea Sandstone and\nIndiana Limestone formations, followed by calculation of their porosity and\nfluid saturations. The technique may ultimately permit rapid, accurate and\nnon-destructive evaluation of relevant petro-physical properties in thick\nintact cores. It is suitable for all types of formations including tight\nshales, clays and oil sands.\n", "  In this paper, we study the semi-classical behavior of distorted plane waves,\non manifolds that are Euclidean near infinity or hyperbolic near infinity, and\nof non-positive curvature. Assuming that there is a strip without resonances\nbelow the real axis, we show that distorted plane waves are bounded in\n$L^2_{loc}$ independently of $h$, that they admit a unique semiclassical\nmeasure, and we prove bounds on their $L^p_{loc}$ norms.\n", "  This work demonstrates nanoscale magnetic imaging using bright circularly\npolarized high-harmonic radiation. We utilize the magneto-optical contrast of\nworm-like magnetic domains in a Co/Pd multilayer structure, obtaining\nquantitative amplitude and phase maps by lensless imaging. A\ndiffraction-limited spatial resolution of 49 nm is achieved with iterative\nphase reconstruction enhanced by a holographic mask. Harnessing the unique\ncoherence of high harmonics, this approach will facilitate quantitative,\nelement-specific and spatially-resolved studies of ultrafast magnetization\ndynamics, advancing both fundamental and applied aspects of nanoscale\nmagnetism.\n", "  Tensor models are measures for random tensors. They generalise matrix models\nand were developed to study random geometry in arbitrary dimension. Moreover,\nthey are strongly connected to quantum gravity theories as additionally to the\nstandard bare-bones models, they encompass the field theoretical approach to\nloop quantum gravity known as group field theory.\n  In the present thesis, we focus on the restricted case of quartic tensor\nmodels, for which a far greater number of rigorous mathematical results have\nbeen proven. Quartic models can be re-written as multi-matrix models using the\nintermediate field representation, and their perturbative expansions can be\nwritten as series expansions over combinatorial maps.\n  Using a variety of map expansions, we prove analyticity results and useful\nbounds for the cumulants of various tensor models : the most general standard\nquartic model at any rank and the simplest renormalisable tensor field theory\nat rank 3. Then, we introduce a new class of models, the enhanced models, which\nperturbative expansions display new behaviour, different to the so called\nmelonic behaviour that characterise most known tensor models so far.\n", "  In numerical simulations, artificial terms are applied to the evolution\nequations for stability. To prove their validity, these terms are thoroughly\ntested in test problems where the results are well known. However, they are\nseldom tested in production-quality simulations at high resolution where they\ninteract with a plethora of physical and numerical algorithms. We test three\nartificial resistivities in both the Orszag-Tang vortex and in a star formation\nsimulation. From the Orszag-Tang vortex, the Price et. al. (2017) artificial\nresistivity is the least dissipative thus captures the density and magnetic\nfeatures; in the star formation algorithm, each artificial resistivity\nalgorithm interacts differently with the sink particle to produce various\nresults, including gas bubbles, dense discs, and migrating sink particles. The\nstar formation simulations suggest that it is important to rely upon physical\nresistivity rather than artificial resistivity for convergence.\n", "  Active fluids are a class of non-equilibrium systems where energy is injected\ninto the system continuously by the constituent particles themselves. Many\nexamples, such as bacterial suspensions and actomyosin networks, are\nintrinsically chiral at a local scale, so that their activity involves torque\ndipoles alongside the force dipoles usually considered. Although many aspects\nof active fluids have been studied, the effects of chirality on them are much\nless known. Here we study by computer simulation the dynamics of an\nunstructured droplet of chiral active fluid in three dimensions. Our model only\nconsiders the simplest possible combination of chiral and achiral active\nstresses, yet this leads to an unprecedented range of complex motilities,\nincluding oscillatory swimming, helical swimming, and run-and-tumble motion.\nStrikingly, while the chirality of helical swimming is the same as the\nmicroscopic chirality of torque dipoles in one regime, the two are opposite in\nanother. Some of the features of these motility modes resemble those of some\nsingle-celled protozoa, suggesting that underlying mechanisms may be shared by\nsome biological systems and synthetic active droplets.\n", "  We consider the conformal flow model derived by Bizo\\'n, Craps, Evnin, Hunik,\nLuyten, and Maliborski [Commun. Math. Phys. 353 (2017) 1179-1199] as a normal\nform for the conformally invariant cubic wave equation on $\\mathbb{S}^3$. We\nprove that the energy attains a global constrained maximum at a family of\nparticular stationary solutions which we call the ground state family. Using\nthis fact and spectral properties of the linearized flow (which are interesting\non their own due to a supersymmetric structure) we prove nonlinear orbital\nstability of the ground state family. The main difficulty in the proof is due\nto the degeneracy of the ground state family as a constrained maximizer of the\nenergy.\n", "  Context. Generating a synthetic dataset of meteoroid orbits is a crucial step\nin analysing the probabilities of random grouping of meteoroid orbits in\nautomated meteor shower surveys. Recent works have shown the importance of\nchoosing a low similarity threshold value of meteoroid orbits, some pointing\nout that the recent meteor shower surveys produced false positives due to\nsimilarity thresholds which were too high. On the other hand, the methods of\nsynthetic meteoroid orbit generation introduce additional biases into the data,\nthus making the final decision on an appropriate threshold value uncertain.\n  Aims. As a part of the ongoing effort to determine the nature of meteor\nshowers and improve automated methods, it was decided to tackle the problem of\nsynthetic meteoroid orbit generation, the main goal being to reproduce the\nunderlying structure and the statistics of the observed data in the synthetic\norbits.\n  Methods. A new method of generating synthetic meteoroid orbits using the\nKernel Density Estimation method is presented. Several types of approaches are\nrecommended, depending on whether one strives to preserve the data structure,\nthe data statistics or to have a compromise between the two.\n  Results. The improvements over the existing methods of synthetic orbit\ngeneration are demonstrated. The comparison between the previous and newly\ndeveloped methods are given, as well as the visualization tools one can use to\nestimate the influence of different input parameters on the final data.\n", "  The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) class is a paradigmatic example of universality\nin nonequilibrium phenomena, but clear experimental evidences of asymptotic\n2D-KPZ statistics are still very rare, and far less understanding stems from\nits short-time behavior. We tackle such issues by analyzing surface\nfluctuations of CdTe films deposited on polymeric substrates, based on a huge\nspatio-temporal surface sampling acquired through atomic force microscopy. A\n\\textit{pseudo}-steady state (where average surface roughness and spatial\ncorrelations stay constant in time) is observed at initial times, persisting up\nto deposition of $\\sim 10^{4}$ monolayers. This state results from a fine\nbalance between roughening and smoothening, as supported by a phenomenological\ngrowth model. KPZ statistics arises at long times, thoroughly verified by\nuniversal exponents, spatial covariance and several distributions. Recent\ntheoretical generalizations of the Family-Vicsek scaling and the emergence of\nlog-normal distributions during interface growth are experimentally confirmed.\nThese results confirm that high vacuum vapor deposition of CdTe constitutes a\ngenuine 2D-KPZ system, and expand our knowledge about possible\nsubstrate-induced short-time behaviors.\n", "  Recent studies have shown that many results published in peer-reviewed\nscientific journals are not reproducible. This raises the following question:\nwhy is it so easy to fool myself into believing that a result is reliable when\nin fact it is not? Using Brownian motion as a toy model, we show how this can\nhappen if ergodicity is assumed where it is unwarranted. A measured value can\nappear stable when judged over time, although it is not stable across the\nensemble: a different result will be obtained each time the experiment is run.\n", "  In a single-particle detection experiment, a wavefront impinges on a detector\nbut observers only see a point response. The extent of the wavefront becomes\nevident only in statistical accumulation of many independent detections, with\nprobability given by the Born rule. Drawing on concepts from quantum optics, we\nanalyze a simple model to reverse-engineer how this behavior can come about in\nterms of wave mechanics alone without a measurement axiom. The model detector\nconsists of many molecules, each of which can be resonantly excited by the\nincoming particle and then emit a detection signature (e.g., localized flash of\nlight). Different molecules have different resonant energies because local\nconditions (proximity of other molecules, Doppler shifts, etc.) vary. The\ndetector is thus a quasi-continuum, and the incoming particle preferentially\nexcites the molecule that it matches most closely in energy. (In actuality,\nmolecules can be so numerous that many could closely match the incoming\nparticle in energy; but in that case only one will be the first, and there will\nbe nothing left for the others by the time the first match resonates and then\nemits. The model does not explicitly take into account the temporal advance of\nthe particle wave packet through the detector medium.) The excited molecule can\nemit a detection signature, but that process competes with fluctuation-driven\ndephasing. We estimate the probability that a given molecule is resonantly\nexcited, and we also estimate the probability that a detection signature is\nproduced before being overwhelmed by fluctuations in the detector medium. The\nproduct of these two probabilities is proportional to the absolute-square of\nthe incoming wavefunction at the molecule in question, i.e. the Born rule. We\ndiscuss ways to probe these mechanisms experimentally, and check the model with\nnumbers from a neutron interference experiment.\n", "  Isotropic bonded magnets with a high loading fraction of 70 vol.% Nd-Fe-B are\nfabricated via an extrusion-based additive manufacturing, or 3D printing system\nthat enables rapid production of large parts for the first time. The density of\nthe printed magnet is 5.15 g/cm3. The room temperature magnetic properties are:\nintrinsic coercivity Hci = 8.9 kOe (708.2 kA/m), remanence Br = 5.8 kG (0.58\nTesla), and energy product (BH)max = 7.3 MGOe (58.1 kJ/m3). The as-printed\nmagnets are then coated with two types of polymers, both of which improve the\nthermal stability at 127 {\\deg}C as revealed by flux aging loss measurements.\nTensile tests performed at 25 {\\deg}C and 100 {\\deg}C show that the ultimate\ntensile stress (UTS) increases with increasing loading fraction of the magnet\npowder, and decreases with increasing temperature. AC magnetic susceptibility\nand resistivity measurements show that the 3D printed Nd-Fe-B bonded magnets\nexhibit extremely low eddy current loss and high resistivity. Finally, we show\nthat through back electromotive force measurements that motors installed with\n3D printed Nd-Fe-B magnets exhibit similar performance as compared to those\ninstalled with sintered ferrites.\n", "  Kinematic Simulations of turbulent pair diffusion in planar turbulence with a\n-5/3 energy spectrum reproduce the results of the laboratory measurements of\nJullien Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 2872 (1999), in particular the stretched\nexponential form of the PDF of pair separations and their correlation\nfunctions. The root mean square separation is found to be strongly dependent on\ninitial conditions for very long stretches of times. This dependence is\nconsistent with the topological picture of turbulent pair diffusion where pairs\ninitially close enough travel together for long stretches of time and separate\nviolently when they meet straining regions around hyperbolic points. A new\nargument based on the divergence of accelerations is given to support this\npicture.\n"]}
