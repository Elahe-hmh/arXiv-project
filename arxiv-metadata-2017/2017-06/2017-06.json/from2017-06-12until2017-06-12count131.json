Considering a new source function\n$\\nu(r)$ we find out a set of solutions which is physically well behaved and\nrepresent compact stellar models. A detailed study specifically shows that the\nmodels actually correspond to strange stars in terms of their mass and radius.\nIn this connection we investigate about several physical properties like energy\nconditions, stability, mass-radius ratio, electric charge content, anisotropic\nnature and surface redshift through graphical plots and mathematical\ncalculations. All the features from these studies are in excellent agreement\nwith the already available evidences in theory as well as observations.\n", "  The abelian Higgs model and its phase structure are discussed from the\nperspective that the gauge and scalar fields admit a dual description in terms\nof fermion variables. The results which indicate the presence of three main\nphases: Coulomb, Higgs and confinement agree well with those in the literature\nalthough a nonstandard order parameter is employed.\n", "  The toe pads of frogs consist of soft hexagonal structures and a viscous\nliquid contained between and within the hexagonal structures. It has been\nhypothesized that this configuration creates adhesion by allowing for long\nrange capillary forces, or alternatively, by allowing for exit of the liquid\nand thus improving contact of the toe pad. In this work we suggest interaction\nbetween viscosity and elasticity as a mechanism to create temporary adhesion,\neven in the absence of capillary effects or van der Waals forces. We initially\nillustrate this concept experimentally by a simplified configuration consisting\nof two surfaces connected by a liquid bridge and elastic springs. We then\nutilize poroelastic mixture theory and model frog's toe pads as an elastic\nporous medium, immersed within a viscous liquid and pressed against a rigid\nrough surface. The flow between the surface and the toe pad is modeled by the\nlubrication approximation. Inertia is neglected and analysis of the\nelastic-viscous dynamics yields a governing partial differential equation\ndescribing the flow and stress within the porous medium. Several solutions of\nthe governing equation are presented and show a temporary adhesion due to\nstress created at the contact surface between the solids. This work thus may\nexplain how some frogs (such as the torrent frog) maintain adhesion underwater\nand the reason for the periodic repositioning of frogs' toe pads during\nadhesion to surfaces.\n", "  We propose a new approach to near-infrared molecular spectroscopy, harnessing\nadvanced concepts of optical telecommunications and supercontinuum photonics.\nWe generate, without mode-locked lasers, two frequency combs of slightly\ndifferent repetition frequencies and moderate, but rapidly tunable, spectral\nspan. The output of a frequency-agile continuous wave laser is split and sent\ninto two electro-optic intensity modulators. Flat-top low-noise frequency combs\nare produced by wave-breaking in a nonlinear optical fiber of normal\ndispersion. With a dual-comb spectrometer, we record Doppler-limited spectra\nspanning 60 GHz within 13 microseconds and 80-kHz refresh rate, at a tuning\nspeed of 10 nm.s^(-1). The sensitivity for weak absorption is enhanced by a\nlong gas-filled hollow-core fiber.\n", "  Many natural, complex systems are remarkably stable thanks to an absence of\nfeedback acting on their elements. When described as networks, these exhibit\nfew or no cycles, and associated matrices have small leading eigenvalues. It\nhas been suggested that this architecture can confer advantages to the system\nas a whole, such as `qualitative stability', but this observation does not in\nitself explain how a loopless structure might arise. We show here that the\nnumber of feedback loops in a network, as well as the eigenvalues of associated\nmatrices, are determined by a structural property called trophic coherence, a\nmeasure of how neatly nodes fall into distinct levels. Our theory correctly\nclassifies a variety of networks -- including those derived from genes,\nmetabolites, species, neurons, words, computers and trading nations -- into two\ndistinct regimes of high and low feedback, and provides a null model to gauge\nthe significance of related magnitudes. Since trophic coherence suppresses\nfeedback, whereas an absence of feedback alone does not lead to coherence, our\nwork suggests that the reasons for `looplessness' in nature should be sought in\ncoherence-inducing mechanisms.\n", "  We present a solution to the naturalness problem of the electroweak scale\nbased on a change of variable in the Fourier space of non supersymmetric nature\nthat transforms a boson into a fermion and viceversa. This is exemplified for\nthat part of the standard model Lagrangian that contains a Dirac fermion\ncoupled with the Higgs field. The full Lagrangian which contains both the\ninitial particles and the partners obtained through this method is invariant\nunder the symmetry associated to this change of variables and is free of\nquadratic divergences to the scalar particles present in the Lagrangian. The\npartners appear mostly as \"off-shell\" states thus explaining their experimental\nabsence at any particle accelerators.\n", "  We introduce the notion of discrete cusp for a weighted graph. In this\ncontext, we provethat the form-domain of the magnetic Laplacian and that of\nthenon-magnetic Laplacian can be different. We establish the emptiness of the\nessential spectrum and compute theasymptotic of eigenvalues for the magnetic\nLaplacian.\n", "  We perform a systematic investigation on the ground state of an asymmetric\ntwo-leg spin ladder (where exchange couplings of the legs are unequal) with\nferromagnetic (FM) nearest-neighbor interaction and diagonal anti-ferromagnetic\nfrustration using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method. When\nthe ladder is strongly asymmetric with moderate frustration, a magnetic canted\nstate is observed between a FM state and a singlet dimerized state. The phase\nboundaries are dependent on the asymmetric strength $\\alpha_{a}$. On the other\nhand, when the asymmetric strength is intermediate, a so-called spin-stripe\nstate (spins align parallel on same legs, but antiparallel on rungs) is\ndiscovered, and the system experiences a first-order phase transition from the\nFM state to the spin-stripe state upon increasing frustration. We present\nnumerical evidence to interpret the phase diagram in terms of frustration and\nthe asymmetric strength.\n", "  We study the robustness of quantum key distribution protocols using discrete\nor continuous variables to the channel noise. We introduce the model of such\nnoise based on coupling of the signal to a thermal reservoir, typical for\ncontinuous-variable quantum key distribution, to the discrete-variable case.\nThen we perform a comparison of the bounds on the tolerable channel noise\nbetween these two kinds of protocols using the same noise parametrization, in\nthe case of implementation which is perfect otherwise. Obtained results show\nthat continuous-variable protocols can exhibit similar robustness to the\nchannel noise when the transmittance of the channel is relatively high.\nHowever, for strong loss discrete-variable protocols are superior and can\novercome even the infinite-squeezing continuous-variable protocol while using\nlimited nonclassical resources. The requirement on the probability of a\nsingle-photon production which would have to be fulfilled by a practical source\nof photons in order to demonstrate such superiority is feasible thanks to the\nrecent rapid development in this field.\n", "  In quantum field theory, the vacuum is a fluctuating medium which behaves as\na nonlinear polarizable material. In this article, we perform the first\nrigorous derivation of the magnetic Euler-Heisenberg effective energy, a\nnonlinear functional that describes the effective fluctuations of the quantum\nvacuum in a classical magnetic field. We start from a classical magnetic field\nin interaction with a quan-tized Dirac field in its ground state, and we study\na limit in which the classical magnetic field is slowly varying. After a change\nof scales, this is equivalent to a semi-classical limit $\\hbar\\to0$, with a\nstrong magnetic field of order $1/\\hbar$. In this regime, we prove that the\nenergy of Dirac's polarized vacuum converges to the Euler-Heisenberg\nfunctional. The model has ultraviolet divergences, which we regularize using\nthe Pauli-Villars method. We also discuss how to remove the regularization of\nthe Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian, using charge renormaliza-tion,\nperturbatively to any order of the coupling constant.\n", "  We study the properties of a class of quantum field theories endowed with an\nequal number of anti commuting and commuting field variables, the most common\nexample being the supersymmetric models. Based on the scaling properties of the\npartition function we find that these theories have the quantum energy momentum\ntensor associated to dilatations and thus the vacuum energy equal to zero.\n", "  The melting condition for two-dimensional Wigner solid ( P.M. Platzman,\nH.Fukuyama, 1974) is shown to contain an error of a factor of $\\pi$. The\nanalysis of experimental data for apparent 2D metal-to-insulator transition\nshows that the Wigner solidification (B.Tanatar, D.M.Ceperley, 1989) has been\nnever achieved. Within routine Fermi gas model both the metallic and insulating\nbehavior of different 2D system for actual range of carrier densities and\ntemperatures is explained.\n", "  We compare several common sub-grid implementations of AGN feedback, focusing\non the effects of different triggering mechanisms and the differences between\nthermal and kinetic feedback. Our main result is that pure thermal feedback\nthat is centrally injected behaves differently from feedback with even a small\nkinetic component. Specifically, pure thermal feedback results in excessive\ncondensation and smothering of the AGN by cold gas because the feedback energy\ndoes not propagate to large enough radii. We do not see large differences\nbetween implementations of different triggering mechanisms, as long as the\nspatial resolution is sufficiently high, probably because all of the\nimplementations tested here trigger strong AGN feedback under similar\nconditions. In order to assess the role of resolution, we vary the size of the\n\"accretion zone\" in which properties are measured to determine the AGN\naccretion rate and resulting feedback power. We find that a larger accretion\nzone results in steadier jets but can also allow too much cold-gas condensation\nin simulations with a Bondi-like triggering algorithm. We also vary the opening\nangle of jet precession and find that a larger precession angle causes more of\nthe jet energy to thermalize closer to the AGN, thereby producing results\nsimilar to pure thermal feedback. Our simulations confirm that AGN can regulate\nthe thermal state of cool-core galaxy clusters and maintain the core in a state\nthat is marginally susceptable to thermal instability and precipitation.\n", "  In this paper, a way of generalizing the tensor renormalization group(TRG) is\nproposed. Mathematically, the connection between patterns of tensor\nrenormalization group and the concept of truncation sequence in polytope\ngeometry is discovered. A theoretical contraction framework is therefore\nproposed. Furthermore, the canonical polyadic decomposition is introduced to\ntensor network theory. A lowest order numerical verification of this method on\nthe 3-D Ising model is carried out.\n", "  We exploit scanning probe controlled domain patterning in a ferroelectric top\nlayer to induce nonvolatile modulation of the conduction characteristic of\nmonolayer MoS$_2$ between a transistor and a junction state. In the presence of\na domain wall, MoS$_2$ exhibits rectified I-V that is well described by the\nthermionic emission model. The induced Schottky barrier height varies from 0.38\neV to 0.57 eV and is tunabe by a SiO$_2$ global back-gate, while the tuning\nrange of depends sensitively on the conduction band tail trapping states. Our\nwork points to a new route to achieving programmable functionalities in van der\nWaals materials and sheds light on the critical performance limiting factors in\nthese hybrid systems.\n", "  We prove the topological expansion for the cubic log-gas partition function\n\\[ Z_N(t)= \\int_\\Gamma\\cdots\\int_\\Gamma\\prod_{1\\leq j<k\\leq N}(z_j-z_k)^2\n\\prod_{k=1}^Ne^{-N\\left(-\\frac{z^3}{3}+tz\\right)}\\mathrm dz_1\\cdots \\mathrm\ndz_N, \\] where $t$ is a complex parameter and $\\Gamma$ is an unbounded contour\non the complex plane extending from $e^{\\pi \\mathrm i}\\infty$ to $e^{\\pi\n\\mathrm i/3}\\infty$. The complex cubic log-gas model exhibits two phase regions\non the complex $t$-plane, with one cut and two cuts, separated by analytic\ncritical arcs of the two types of phase transition: split of a cut and birth of\na cut. The common point of the critical arcs is a tricritical point of the\nPainlev\\'e I type. In the present paper we prove the topological expansion for\n$\\log Z_N(t)$ in the one-cut phase region. The proof is based on the\nRiemann--Hilbert approach to semiclassical asymptotic expansions for the\nassociated orthogonal polynomials and the theory of $S$-curves and quadratic\ndifferentials.\n", "  Multiphase flow in porous media occurs in several disciplines including\npetroleum reservoir engineering, petroleum systems' analysis, and CO$_2$\nsequestration. While simulations often use a fully implicit discretization to\nincrease the time step size, restrictions on the time step often exist due to\nnon-convergence of the nonlinear solver (e.g. Newton's method). Here this\nproblem is addressed for the Buckley-Leverett equations, which model\nincompressible, immiscible, two-phase flow with no capillary potential. The\nequations are recast as a gradient flow using the phase-field method, and a\nconvex energy splitting scheme is applied to enable large timesteps, even for\nhigh degrees of heterogeneity in permeability and viscosity. By using the\nphase-field formulation as a homotopy map, the underlying hyperbolic flow\nequations can be solved with large timesteps. For a heterogeneous test problem,\nthe new homotopy method allows the timestep to be increased by more than six\norders of magnitude relative to the unmodified equations while maintaining\nconvergence.\n", "  We study the scaling of the (basis dependent) Shannon entropy for\ntwo-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets with N\\'eel long-range order. We use a\nmassless free-field description of the gapless spin wave modes and phase space\narguments to treat the fact that the finite-size ground state is rotationally\nsymmetric, while there are degenerate physical ground states which break the\nsymmetry. Our results show that the Shannon entropy (and its R\\'enyi\ngeneralizations) possesses some universal logarithmic term proportional to the\nnumber $N_\\text{NG}$ of Nambu-Goldstone modes. In the case of a torus, we show\nthat $S_{n>1} \\simeq {\\rm const.} N+ \\frac{N_\\text{NG}}{4}\\frac{n}{n-1} \\ln{N}$\nand $S_1 \\simeq {\\rm const.} N - \\frac{N_\\text{NG}}{4} \\ln{N}$, where $N$ is\nthe total number of sites and $n$ the R\\'enyi index. The result for $n>1$ is in\nreasonable agreement with the quantum Monte Carlo results of Luitz et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 057203 (2014)], and qualitatively similar to those\nobtained previously for the entanglement entropy. The Shannon entropy of a line\nsubsystem (embedded in the two-dimensional system) is also considered. Finally,\nwe present some density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations for a\nspin$\\frac{1}{2}$ XY model on the square lattice in a cylinder geometry. These\nnumerical data confirm our findings for logarithmic terms in the $n=\\infty$\nR\\'enyi entropy (also called $-\\ln{p_{\\rm max}}$). They also reveal some\nuniversal dependence on the cylinder aspect ratio, in good agreement with the\nfact that, in that case, $p_{\\rm max}$ is related to a non-compact free-boson\npartition function in dimension 1+1.\n", "  Studies of superconductivity in multiband correlated electronic systems has\nbecome one of the central topics in condensed matter/materials physics. In this\npaper, we present the results of thermodynamic measurements on the\nsuperconducting filled skutterudite system Pr$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$Pt$_4$Ge$_{12}$ ($ 0\n\\leq x \\leq 0.2$) to investigate how substitution of Ce at Pr sites affects\nsuperconductivity. We find that an increase in Ce concentration leads to a\nsuppression of the superconducting transition temperature from $T_{c}\\sim 7.9$\nK for $x=0$ to $T_c\\sim 0.6$ K for $x=0.14$. Our analysis of the specific heat\ndata for $x\\leq 0.07$ reveals that superconductivity must develop in at least\ntwo bands: the superconducting order parameter has nodes on one Fermi pocket\nand remains fully gapped on the other. Both the nodal and nodeless gap values\ndecrease, with the nodal gap being suppressed more strongly, with Ce\nsubstitution. Ultimately, the higher Ce concentration samples ($x>0.07$)\ndisplay a nodeless gap only.\n", "  Observed CMB anisotropies are lensed, and the lensed power spectra can be\ncalculated accurately assuming the lensing deflections are Gaussian. However,\nthe lensing deflections are actually slightly non-Gaussian due to both\nnon-linear large-scale structure growth and post-Born corrections. We calculate\nthe leading correction to the lensed CMB power spectra from the\nnon-Gaussianity, which is determined by the lensing bispectrum. The\nlowest-order result gives $\\sim 0.3\\%$ corrections to the BB and EE\npolarization spectra on small-scales, however we show that the effect on EE is\nreduced by about a factor of two by higher-order Gaussian lensing smoothing,\nrendering the total effect safely negligible for the foreseeable future. We\ngive a simple analytic model for the signal expected from skewness of the\nlarge-scale lensing field; the effect is similar to a net demagnification and\nhence a small change in acoustic scale (and therefore out of phase with the\ndominant lensing smoothing that predominantly affects the peaks and troughs of\nthe power spectrum).\n", "  Group theoretical methods and ${\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf p}$ theory are combined to\ndetermine spin-dependent contributions to the effective conduction band\nHamiltonian. To obtain the constants in the effective Hamiltonian, in general\nall invariants of the Hamiltonian have to be determined. Hence, we present a\nsystematic approach to keep track of all possible invariants and apply it to\nthe ${\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf p}$ Hamiltonian of crystals with zinc-blende symmetry, in\norder to obtain all possible contributions to effective quantities such as\neffective mass, g-factor and Dresselhaus constant. Further spin-dependent\ncontributions to the effective Hamiltonian arise in the presence of strain. In\nparticular, with regard to the constants $C_3$ and $D$ which describe\nspin-splitting linear in the components of ${\\bf k}$ and\n${\\boldsymbol\\varepsilon}$, considering all possible terms allowed by symmetry\nis crucial.\n", "  We consider the problem of detecting entanglement and nonlocality in\none-dimensional (1D) infinite, translation-invariant (TI) systems when just\nnear-neighbor information is available. This issue is deeper than one might\nthink a priori, since, as we show, there exist instances of local separable\nstates (classical boxes) which admit only entangled (nonclassical) TI\nextensions. We provide a simple characterization of the set of local states of\nmultiseparable TI spin chains and construct a family of linear witnesses which\ncan detect entanglement in infinite TI states from the nearest-neighbor reduced\ndensity matrix. Similarly, we prove that the set of classical TI boxes forms a\npolytope and devise a general procedure to generate all Bell inequalities which\ncharacterize it. Using an algorithm based on matrix product states, we show how\nsome of them can be violated by distant parties conducting identical\nmeasurements on an infinite TI quantum state. All our results can be easily\nadapted to detect entanglement and nonlocality in large (finite, not TI) 1D\ncondensed matter systems.\n", "  Berry phase plays an important role in many non-trivial phenomena over a\nbroad range of many-body systems. In this thesis we focus on the Berry phase\ndue to the change of the particles' momenta, and study its effects in free and\ninteracting fermionic systems. We start with reviewing the semi-classical\nkinetic theory with Berry phase for a non-interacting ensemble of fermions -- a\nBerry Fermi gas -- which might be far-from-equilibrium. We particularly review\nthe famous Berry phase contribution to the anomalous Hall current. We then\nprovide a concrete and general path integral derivation for the semi-classical\ntheory. Then we turn to the specific example of Weyl fermion, which exhibits\nthe profound quantum phenomenon of chiral anomaly; we review how this quantum\neffect, and its closely related chiral magnetic effect and chiral vortical\neffect, arise from Berry phase in the semi-classical kinetic theory. We also\ndiscuss how Lorentz symmetry in the kinetic theory of Weyl fermion, seemly\nviolated by the Berry phase term, is realized non-trivially; we provide a\nphysical interpretation for this non-trivial realization, and discuss its\nmathematical foundation in Wigner translation. Next, we turn towards\ninteracting fermionic systems. We consider Fermi liquid near equilibrium, and\npropose the Berry Fermi liquid theory -- the extension to Landau Fermi liquid\ntheory incorporating Berry phase (and other) effects. In our proposed Berry\nFermi liquid theory, we can show the Berry phase is a Fermi surface property,\nqualitatively unmodified by interactions. But there also arise new effects from\ninteractions, most notably the emergent electric dipole moment which\ncontributes to the anomalous Hall current in addition to the usual Berry phase\ncontribution. We prove our proposed Berry Fermi liquid theory from quantum\nfield theory to all orders in Feynman diagram expansion under very general\nassumptions.\n", "  The Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) theorem deals with the realism of the quantum\nstates. It establishes that every pure quantum state is real, in the context of\nquantum ontological models. Specifically, by guaranteeing the property of\nnot-Post-Peierls ($\\neg$PP) compatibility (or antidistinguishability) for a\nparticular set of states $P$, together with the ad hoc postulate known as\nPreparation Independence Postulate (PIP), the theorem establishes that these\ntwo properties imply the $\\psi$-onticity (realism) of the set of all pure\nstates. This PBR result has triggered two particular lines of research: On the\none hand, it has been possible to derive similar results without the use of the\nPIP, although at the expense of implying weaker properties than\n$\\psi$-onticity. On the other hand, it has also been proven that the property\nof $\\neg$PP compatibility alone is an explicit witness of usefulness for the\ntask known as conclusive exclusion of states. In this work, we explore the\n$\\neg$PP compatibility of the set of states $P$, when $P$ is under the\ninteraction of some noisy channels, which would consequently let us identify\nsome noisy scenarios where it is still possible to perform the task of\nconclusive exclusion of states. Specifically, we consider the set $P$ of\n$n$-qubit states in interaction with an environment by means of i) individual\nand ii) collective couplings. In both cases, we analytically show that the\nphenomenon of achieving $\\neg$PP compatibility, although reduced, it is still\npresent. Searching for an optimisation of this phenomenon, we report numerical\nexperiments up to $n=4$ qubits.\n", "  Quantum matter provides an effective vacuum out of which arise emergent\nparticles not corresponding to any experimentally detected elementary particle.\nTopological quantum materials in particular have become a focus of intense\nresearch in part because of the remarkable possibility to realize Majorana\nfermions, with their potential for new, decoherence-free quantum computing\narchitectures. In this paper we undertake a study on high-quality single\ncrystal of $\\alpha-RuCl_3$ which has been identified as a material realizing a\nproximate Kitaev state, a topological quantum state with magnetic Majorana\nfermions. Four-dimensional tomographic reconstruction of dynamical correlations\nmeasured using neutrons is uniquely powerful for probing such magnetic states.\nWe discover unusual signals, including an unprecedented column of scattering\nover a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center which is\nremarkably stable with temperature. This is straightforwardly accounted for in\nterms of the Majorana excitations present in Kitaev's topological quantum spin\nliquid. Other, more delicate, features in the scattering can be transparently\nassociated with perturbations to an ideal model. This opens a window on\nemergent magnetic Majorana fermions in correlated materials.\n", "  Ensemble inequivalence has been previously displayed only for long-range\ninteracting systems with non-extensive energy. In order to perform the\nthermodynamic limit, such systems require an unphysical, so-called, Kac\nrescaling of the coupling constant. We here study models defined on long-range\nrandom networks, which avoid such a rescaling. The proposed models have an\nextensive energy, which is however non-additive. For such long-range random\nnetworks, pairs of sites are coupled with a probability decaying with the\ndistance $r$ as $1/r^\\delta$. In one dimension and with $0 \\leq \\delta <1$,\nsurface energy scales linearly with the network size, while for $\\delta >1$ it\nis $O(1)$. By performing numerical simulations, we show that a negative\nspecific heat region is present in the microcanonical ensemble of a Blume-Capel\nmodel, in correspondence with a first-order phase transition in the canonical\none. This proves that ensemble inequivalence is a consequence of\n$non$-$additivity$ rather than $non$-$extensivity$. Moreover, since a\nmean-field coupling is absent in such networks, relaxation to equilibrium takes\nplace on an intensive time scale and quasi-stationary states are absent.\n", "  We analyze the statistics of charge and energy currents and spin torque in a\nmetallic nanomagnet coupled to a large magnetic metal via a tunnel contact. We\nderive a Keldysh action for the tunnel barrier, describing the stochastic\ncurrents in the presence of a magnetization precessing with the rate $\\Omega$.\nIn contrast to some earlier approaches, we include the geometric phases that\naffect the counting statistics. We illustrate the use of the action by deriving\nspintronic fluctuation relations, the quantum limit of pumped current noise,\nand consider the fluctuations in two specific cases: the situation with a\nstable precession of magnetization driven by spin transfer torque, and the\ntorque-induced switching between the minima of a magnetic anisotropy. The\nquantum corrections are relevant when the precession rate exceeds the\ntemperature $T$, i.e., for $\\hbar \\Omega \\gtrsim k_B T$.\n", "  We propose the definitions of many-body topological invariants to detect\nsymmetry-protected topological phases protected by point group symmetry, using\npartial point group transformations on a given short-range entangled quantum\nground state. Partial point group transformations $g_D$ are defined by point\ngroup transformations restricted to a spatial subregion $D$, which is closed\nunder the point group transformations and sufficiently larger than the bulk\ncorrelation length $\\xi$. By analytical and numerical calculations,we find that\nthe ground state expectation value of the partial point group transformations\nbehaves generically as $\\langle GS | g_D | GS \\rangle \\sim \\exp \\Big[ i \\theta+\n\\gamma - \\alpha \\frac{{\\rm Area}(\\partial D)}{\\xi^{d-1}} \\Big]$. Here, ${\\rm\nArea}(\\partial D)$ is the area of the boundary of the subregion $D$, and\n$\\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant. The complex phase of the expectation\nvalue $\\theta$ is quantized and serves as the topological invariant, and\n$\\gamma$ is a scale-independent topological contribution to the amplitude. The\nexamples we consider include the $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_{16}$\ninvariants of topological superconductors protected by inversion symmetry in\n$(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$ dimensions, respectively, and the lens space topological\ninvariants in $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic topological phases. Connections to\ntopological quantum field theories and cobordism classification of\nsymmetry-protected topological phases are discussed.\n", "  We study the pseudo-spin density response of a disordered two-dimensional\nspin-polarized Bose gas of exciton polaritons to weak alternating magnetic\nfield, assuming that one of the spin states of the doublet is macroscopically\noccupied and Bose-condensed while the occupation of the other state remains\nmuch smaller. We calculate spatial and temporal dispersions of spin\nsusceptibility of the gas taking into account spin-flip processes due to the\ntransverse-longitudinal splitting. Further, we use the Bogoliubov theory of\nweakly-interacting gases and show that the time-dependent magnetic field power\nabsorption exhibits double resonance structure corresponding to two particle\nspin states (contrast to paramagnetic resonance in regular spin-polarized\nelectron gas). We analyze the widths of these resonances caused by scattering\non the disorder and show that, in contrast with the ballistic regime, in the\npresence of impurities, the polariton scattering on them is twofold: scattering\non the impurity potential directly and scattering on the spatially fluctuating\ncondensate density caused by the disorder. As a result, the width of the\nresonance associated with the Bose-condensed spin state can be surprizingly\nnarrow in comparison with the width of the resonance associated with the\nnon-condensed state.\n", "  The article is a short opinionated review of the quantum treatment of\nelectromagnetic circuits, with no pretension to exhaustiveness. This review,\nwhich is an updated and modernized version of a previous set of Les Houches\nSchool lecture notes, has 3 main parts. The first part describes how to\nconstruct a Hamiltonian for a general circuit, which can include dissipative\nelements. The second part describes the quantization of the circuit, with an\nemphasis on the quantum treatment of dissipation. The final part focuses on the\nJosephson non-linear element and the main linear building blocks from which\nsuperconducting circuits are assembled. It also includes a brief review of the\nmain types of superconducting artificial atoms, elementary multi-level quantum\nsystems made from basic circuit elements.\n", "  We consider exciton-photon coupling in semiconductor microcavities in which\nseparate periodic potentials have been embedded for excitons and photons. We\nshow theoretically that this system supports degenerate ground-states appearing\nat non-zero in-plane momenta, corresponding to multiple valleys in reciprocal\nspace, which are further separated in polarization corresponding to a\npolarization-valley coupling in the system. Aside forming a basis for\nvalleytronics, the multivalley dispersion is predicted to allow for spontaneous\nmomentum symmetry breaking and two-mode squeezing under non-resonant and\nresonant excitation, respectively.\n", "  Quantum state transfer within a quantum computer can be achieved by using a\nnetwork of qubits, and such a network can be modelled mathematically by a\ngraph. Here, we focus on the corresponding Laplacian matrix, and those graphs\nfor which the Laplacian can be diagonalized by a Hadamard matrix. We give a\nsimple eigenvalue characterization for when such a graph has perfect state\ntransfer at time $\\pi /2$; this characterization allows one to choose the\ncorrect eigenvalues to build graphs having perfect state transfer. We\ncharacterize the graphs that are diagonalizable by the standard Hadamard\nmatrix, showing a direct relationship to cubelike graphs. We then give a number\nof constructions producing a wide variety of new graphs that exhibit perfect\nstate transfer, and we consider several corollaries in the settings of both\nweighted and unweighted graphs, as well as how our results relate to the notion\nof pretty good state transfer. Finally, we give an optimality result, showing\nthat among regular graphs of degree at most $4$, the hypercube is the sparsest\nHadamard diagonalizable connected unweighted graph with perfect state transfer.\n", "  We report on a scanning confocal Raman spectroscopy study investigating the\nstrain-uniformity and the overall strain and doping of high-quality chemical\nvapour deposited (CVD) graphene-based heterostuctures on a large number of\ndifferent substrate materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (hBN),\ntransition metal dichalcogenides, silicon, different oxides and nitrides, as\nwell as polymers. By applying a hBN-assisted, contamination free, dry transfer\nprocess for CVD graphene, high-quality heterostructures with low doping\ndensities and low strain variations are assembled. The Raman spectra of these\npristine heterostructures are sensitive to substrate-induced doping and strain\nvariations and are thus used to probe the suitability of the substrate material\nfor potential high-quality graphene devices. We find that the flatness of the\nsubstrate material is a key figure for gaining, or preserving high-quality\ngraphene.\n", "  Synthetic nonconservative systems with parity-time (PT) symmetric gain-loss\nstructures can exhibit unusual spontaneous symmetry breaking that accompanies\nspectral singularity. Recent studies on PT symmetry in optics and weakly\ninteracting open quantum systems have revealed intriguing physical properties,\nyet many-body correlations still play no role. Here by extending the idea of PT\nsymmetry to strongly correlated many-body systems, we report that a combination\nof spectral singularity and quantum criticality yields an exotic universality\nclass which has no counterpart in known critical phenomena. Moreover, we find\nunconventional low-dimensional quantum criticality, where superfluid\ncorrelation is anomalously enhanced owing to non-monotonic renormalization\ngroup flows in a PT-symmetry-broken quantum critical phase, in stark contrast\nto the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless paradigm. Our findings can be\nexperimentally tested in ultracold atoms and predict critical phenomena beyond\nthe Hermitian paradigm of quantum many-body physics.\n", "  Pairwise entanglement, calculated separately for charge and spin degrees of\nfreedom, is proposed as a ground-state signature of the Mott transition in\ncorrelated nanoscopic systems. Utilizing the exact diagonalization - ab initio\nmethod (EDABI), for chains containing $N\\leqslant{}16$ hydrogenic-like atoms\n(at the half filling), we find that the vanishing of the nearest-neighbor\ncharge concurrence indicates the crossover from a partly-localized quantum\nliquid to the Mott insulator. Spin concurrence remains nonzero at the\ninsulating phase, showing that the decopling of spin and charge degrees of\nfreedom may manifest itself by wavefunctions entangled in spin, but separable\nin charge coordinates. At the quarter filling, the analysis for\n$N\\leqslant{}20$ shows that spin concurrence vanishes immediately when the\ncharge-energy gap obtained from the scaling with $1/N\\rightarrow{}0$ vanishes,\nconstituting a finite-system version of the Mott transition. Analytic\nderivations of the formulas expressing either charge or spin concurrence in\nterms of ground-state correlation functions are also provided.\n", "  We extend the technique of multiplex coherent Raman spectroscopy with two\nfemtosecond mode-locked lasers to oscillators of a pulse repetition frequency\nof 1 GHz. We demonstrate spectra of liquids, which span 1100 cm$^{-1}$ of Raman\nshifts. At a resolution of 6 cm$^{-1}$, their measurement time may be as short\nas 5 microseconds for a refresh rate of 2 kHz. The waiting period between\nacquisitions is improved ten-fold compared to previous experiments with two\nlasers of 100-MHz repetition frequencies.\n", "  Elastic structures loaded by nonconservative positional forces are prone to\ninstabilities induced by dissipation: it is well-known in fact that internal\nviscous damping destabilizes the marginally stable Ziegler's pendulum and\nPfluger column (of which the Beck's column is a special case), two structures\nloaded by a tangential follower force. The result is the so-called\n'destabilization paradox', where the critical force for flutter instability\ndecreases by an order of magnitude when the coefficient of internal damping\nbecomes infinitesimally small. Until now external damping, such as that related\nto air drag, is believed to provide only a stabilizing effect, as one would\nintuitively expect. Contrary to this belief, it will be shown that the effect\nof external damping is qualitatively the same as the effect of internal\ndamping, yielding a pronounced destabilization paradox. Previous results\nrelative to destabilization by external damping of the Ziegler's and Pfluger's\nelastic structures are corrected in a definitive way leading to a new\nunderstanding of the destabilizating role played by viscous terms.\n", "  Organometallic clusters based on transition metal atoms are interesting\nbecause possible applications in spintronics and quantum information. In\naddition to the enhanced magnetism at the nanoscale, the organic ligands may\nprovide a natural shield again unwanted magnetic interactions with the matrices\nrequired for applications. Here we show that the organic ligands may lead to\nnon-collinear magnetic order as well as the expected quenching of the magnetic\nmoments. We use different density functional theory (DFT) methods to study the\nexperimentally relevant three cobalt atoms surrounded by benzene rings\n(Co$_3$Bz$_3$). We found that the benzene rings induce a ground state with\nnon-collinear magnetization, with the magnetic moments localized on the cobalt\ncenters and lying on the plane formed by the three cobalt atoms. We further\nanalyze the magnetism of such a cluster using an anisotropic Heisenberg model\nwhere the involved parameters are obtained by a comparison with the DFT\nresults. These results may also explain the recent observation of null magnetic\nmoment of Co$_3$Bz$_3^+$. Moreover, we propose an additional experimental\nverification based on electron paramagnetic resonance.\n", "  We formulate a Hamiltonian description of the orbital motion of a point\nparticle in Kerr spacetime for generic (eccentric, inclined) orbits, which\naccounts for the effects of the conservative part of the gravitational\nself-force. This formulation relies on a description of the particle's motion\nas geodesic in a certain smooth effective spacetime, in terms of (generalized)\naction-angle variables. Clarifying the role played by the gauge freedom in the\nHamiltonian dynamics, we extract the gauge-invariant information contained in\nthe conservative self-force. We also propose a possible gauge choice for which\nthe orbital dynamics can be described by an effective Hamiltonian, written\nsolely in terms of the action variables. As an application of our Hamiltonian\nformulation in this gauge, we derive the conservative self-force correction to\nthe orbital frequencies of Kerr innermost stable spherical (inclined or\ncircular) orbits. This gauge choice also allows us to establish a \"first law of\nmechanics\" for black-hole-particle binary systems, at leading order beyond the\ntest-mass approximation.\n", "  A mathematical conjecture is successfully identified, which is used for\nrelativistic analysis of dielectric Einstein-box thought experiment in a Letter\n(Ramos, Rubilar, and Obukhov, Phys. Lett. A 375, 1703 (2011)), where the\nauthors conjecture (without any citations) that, the symmetry and\ndivergence-less property of a Lorentz 4-tensor is a sufficient condition for\nthe time-column space integrals to constitute a Lorentz 4-vector. This\nmathematical conjecture has been thought to be \"a mathematical fact the\nvalidity of which was shown well\" in textbooks. However in this paper, we\nindicate that this conjecture has never been proved mathematically. By\nenumerating a counterexample, we find that this mathematical conjecture is\nflawed, and it is not persuasive to use a flawed mathematical conjecture as a\nstarting point to resolve Abraham-Minkowski controversy over light momentum in\na dielectric medium. We also indicate that this flawed mathematical conjecture\nis actually a widely-accepted conjecture in the dynamics of relativity in\ntextbooks for many decades. To eliminate a misunderstanding of this flawed\nconjecture in the community, we provide a detailed elucidation of why\nM{\\o}ller's mathematical statement, also called \"M{\\o}ller's version of von\nLaue's theorem\", only defines a trivial zero 4-vector for an electromagnetic\nstress-energy Lorentz 4-tensor.\n", "  We consider $N$ non-interacting fermions in an isotropic $d$-dimensional\nharmonic trap. We compute analytically the cumulative distribution of the\nmaximal radial distance of the fermions from the trap center at zero\ntemperature. While in $d=1$ the limiting distribution (in the large $N$ limit),\nproperly centered and scaled, converges to the squared Tracy-Widom distribution\nof the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble in Random Matrix Theory, we show that for all\n$d>1$, the limiting distribution converges to the Gumbel law. These limiting\nforms turn out to be universal, i.e., independent of the details of the\ntrapping potential for a large class of isotropic trapping potentials. We also\nstudy the position of the right-most fermion in a given direction in $d$\ndimensions and, in the case of a harmonic trap, the maximum momentum, and show\nthat they obey similar Gumbel statistics. Finally, we generalize these results\nto low but finite temperature.\n", "  Satellite-based quantum terminals are a feasible way to extend the reach of\nquantum communication protocols such as quantum key distribution (QKD) to the\nglobal scale. To that end, prior demonstrations have shown QKD transmissions\nfrom airborne platforms to receivers on ground, but none have shown QKD\ntransmissions from ground to a moving aircraft, the latter scenario having\nsimplicity and flexibility advantages for a hypothetical satellite. Here, we\ndemonstrate QKD from a ground transmitter to a receiver prototype mounted on an\nairplane in flight. We have specifically designed our receiver prototype to\nconsist of many components that are compatible with the environment and\nresource constraints of a satellite. Coupled with our relocatable ground\nstation system, optical links with distances of 3-10 km were maintained and\nquantum signals transmitted while traversing angular rates similar to those\nobserved of low-Earth-orbit satellites. For some passes of the aircraft over\nthe ground station, links were established within 10 s of position data\ntransmission, and with link times of a few minutes and received quantum bit\nerror rates typically 3-5%, we generated secure keys up to 868 kb in length. By\nsuccessfully generating secure keys over several different pass configurations,\nwe demonstrate the viability of technology that constitutes a quantum receiver\nsatellite payload and provide a blueprint for future satellite missions to\nbuild upon.\n", "  We propose a new method to optically levitate a macroscopic mirror with two\nvertical Fabry-P{\\'e}rot cavities linearly aligned. This configuration gives\nthe simplest possible optical levitation in which the number of laser beams\nused is the minimum of two. We demonstrate that reaching the standard quantum\nlimit (SQL) of a displacement measurement with our system is feasible with\ncurrent technology. The cavity geometry and the levitated mirror parameters are\ndesigned to ensure that the Brownian vibration of the mirror surface is smaller\nthan the SQL. Our scheme provides a promising tool for testing macroscopic\nquantum mechanics.\n", "  Fisher's geometric model was originally introduced to argue that complex\nadaptations must occur in small steps because of pleiotropic constraints. When\nsupplemented with the assumption of additivity of mutational effects on\nphenotypic traits, it provides a simple mechanism for the emergence of\ngenotypic epistasis from the nonlinear mapping of phenotypes to fitness. Of\nparticular interest is the occurrence of reciprocal sign epistasis, which is a\nnecessary condition for multipeaked genotypic fitness landscapes. Here we\ncompute the probability that a pair of randomly chosen mutations interacts sign\nepistatically, which is found to decrease with increasing phenotypic dimension\n$n$, and varies nonmonotonically with the distance from the phenotypic optimum.\nWe then derive expressions for the mean number of fitness maxima in genotypic\nlandscapes comprised of all combinations of $L$ random mutations. This number\nincreases exponentially with $L$, and the corresponding growth rate is used as\na measure of the complexity of the landscape. The dependence of the complexity\non the model parameters is found to be surprisingly rich, and three distinct\nphases characterized by different landscape structures are identified. Our\nanalysis shows that the phenotypic dimension, which is often referred to as\nphenotypic complexity, does not generally correlate with the complexity of\nfitness landscapes and that even organisms with a single phenotypic trait can\nhave complex landscapes. Our results further inform the interpretation of\nexperiments where the parameters of Fisher's model have been inferred from\ndata, and help to elucidate which features of empirical fitness landscapes can\nbe described by this model.\n", "  We present here the results of the first part of the VLBI Ecliptic Plane\nSurvey (VEPS) program. The goal of the program is to find all compact sources\nwithin $7.5^\\circ$ of the ecliptic plane which are suitable as calibrators for\nanticipated phase referencing observations of spacecraft and determine their\npositions with accuracy at the 1.5~nrad level. We run the program in two modes:\nthe search mode and the refining mode. In the search mode, a complete sample of\nall sources brighter than 50 mJy at 5 GHz listed in the Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN)\nand Green Bank 6~cm (GB6) catalogs, except those previously detected with VLBI,\nis observed. In the refining mode, the positions of all ecliptic plane sources,\nincluding those found in the search mode, are improved. By October 2016,\nthirteen 24-hr sessions that targeted all sources brighter than 100~mJy have\nbeen observed and analyzed. Among 3320 observed target sources, 555 objects\nhave been detected. We also conducted a number of follow-up VLBI experiments in\nthe refining mode and improved the positions of 249 ecliptic plane sources.\n", "  We study the quantum Zeno effect (QZE) and quantum anti-Zeno effect (QAZE) of\na two-level system interacting with an environment of harmonic oscillators, the\nspin-boson model. By applying a numerically exact method based on matrix\nproduct states, the previously obtained picture on the influence of\ncounter-rotating terms has to be modified: For physical bath initial states,\nthe transition from QZE to QAZE with increasing measurement interval is only\nabsent at weak coupling, while present at strong coupling. Furthermore, we find\nthat the transition occurs always for the widely used bare bath initial state.\nWithin a more realistic measurement scheme where only the qubit is projectively\nmeasured, the above scenario for the bare bath initial state remains\nqualitatively unchanged, apart from accelerated decay for intermediate\nmeasurement intervals.\n", "  We present a new method for calculation of the gravitational self-force (GSF)\nin Kerr geometry, based on a time-domain reconstruction of the metric\nperturbation from curvature scalars. In this approach, the GSF is computed\ndirectly from a certain scalar-like self-potential that satisfies the\ntime-domain Teukolsky equation on the Kerr background. The approach is\ncomputationally much cheaper than existing time-domain methods, which rely on a\ndirect integration of the linearized Einstein's equations and are impaired by\nmode instabilities. At the same time, it retains the utility and flexibility of\na time-domain treatment, allowing calculations for any type of orbit (including\nhighly eccentric or unbound ones) and the possibility of self-consistently\nevolving the orbit under the effect of the GSF. Here we formulate our method,\nand present a first numerical application, for circular geodesic orbits in\nSchwarzschild geometry. We discuss further applications.\n", "  The most probable state of an infinite self-gravitating gas in the dynamical\nequilibrium is defined by `gravitational haziness', a parameter representing\nmany-body effects and formally like the temperature in the case of thermal\nequilibrium. A kinetic equation is constructed using a concept of statistical\nequipartition of the virial among subsystems of the self-gravitating gas. A\nclosed equation for the gravitational potential is conjectured as a special\nproperty of the kinetic equation. An equilibrium particle distribution function\nin the phase space, an analog of the Maxwell-Boltzmann weight, and a galaxy\nequation of state are found for all `gravitational haziness'. The first law of\na `hazydynamics' (thermodynamics) states that the total mass of an astronomical\nstellar collection is the sum of the Archimedes displaced mass and an excess\n`gobbled' mass determined by the `gravitational haziness' and history.\n", "  Wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics allows for a halo bound state\nwhose spatial extension far exceeds a range of the interaction potential. What\nis even more striking is that such quantum halos can be arbitrarily large on\nspecial occasions. The two examples known so far are the Efimov effect and the\nsuper Efimov effect, which predict that spatial extensions of higher excited\nstates grow exponentially and double exponentially, respectively. Here, we\nestablish yet another new class of arbitrarily large quantum halos formed by\nspinless bosons with short-range interactions in two dimensions. When the\ntwo-body interaction is absent but the three-body interaction is resonant, four\nbosons exhibit an infinite tower of bound states whose spatial extensions scale\nas $R_n\\sim e^{(\\pi n)^2/27}$ for a large $n$. The emergent scaling law is\nuniversal and is termed a semisuper Efimov effect, which together with the\nEfimov and super Efimov effects constitutes a trio of few-body universality\nclasses allowing for arbitrarily large quantum halos.\n", "  Photosynthesis is the basic process used by plants to convert light energy in\nreaction centers into chemical energy. The high efficiency of this process is\nnot yet understood today. Using the formalism for the description of open\nquantum systems by means of a non-Hermitian Hamilton operator, we consider\ninitially the interplay of gain (acceptor) and loss (donor). Near singular\npoints it causes fluctuations of the cross section which appear without any\nexcitation of internal degrees of freedom of the system. This process occurs\ntherefore very quickly and with high efficiency. We then consider the\nexcitation of resonance states of the system by means of these fluctuations.\nThis second step of the whole process takes place much slower than the first\none, because it involves the excitation of internal degrees of freedom of the\nsystem. The two-step process as a whole is highly efficient and the decay is\nbi-exponential. We provide, if possible, the results of analytical studies,\notherwise characteristic numerical results. The similarities of the obtained\nresults to light harvesting in photosynthetic organisms are discussed.\n", "  The crystallographic stacking order in multilayer graphene plays an important\nrole in determining its electronic structure. In trilayer graphene,\nrhombohedral stacking (ABC) is particularly intriguing, exhibiting a flat band\nwith an electric-field tunable band gap. Such electronic structure is distinct\nfrom simple hexagonal stacking (AAA) or typical Bernal stacking (ABA), and is\npromising for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics applications. So far clean\nexperimental electronic spectra on the first two stackings are missing because\nthe samples are usually too small in size (um or nm scale) to be resolved by\nconventional angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here by using\nARPES with nanospot beam size (NanoARPES), we provide direct experimental\nevidence for the coexistence of three different stackings of trilayer graphene\nand reveal their distinctive electronic structures directly. By fitting the\nexperimental data, we provide important experimental band parameters for\ndescribing the electronic structure of trilayer graphene with different\nstackings.\n", "  A 30-g xenon bubble chamber, operated at Northwestern University in June and\nNovember 2016, has for the first time observed simultaneous bubble nucleation\nand scintillation by nuclear recoils in a superheated liquid. This chamber is\ninstrumented with a CCD camera for near-IR bubble imaging, a solar-blind\nphotomultiplier tube to detect 175-nm xenon scintillation light, and a\npiezoelectric acoustic transducer to detect the ultrasonic emission from a\ngrowing bubble. The time of nucleation determined from the acoustic signal is\nused to correlate specific scintillation pulses with bubble-nucleating events.\nWe report on data from this chamber for thermodynamic \"Seitz\" thresholds from\n4.2 to 15.0 keV. The observed single- and multiple-bubble rates when exposed to\na $^{252}$Cf neutron source indicate that, for an 8.3-keV thermodynamic\nthreshold, the minimum nuclear recoil energy required to nucleate a bubble is\n$19\\pm6$ keV (1$\\sigma$ uncertainty). This is consistent with the observed\nscintillation spectrum for bubble-nucleating events. We see no evidence for\nbubble nucleation by gamma rays at any of the thresholds studied, setting a 90%\nC.L. upper limit of $6.3\\times10^{-7}$ bubbles per gamma interaction at a\n4.2-keV thermodynamic threshold. This indicates stronger gamma discrimination\nthan in CF$_3$I bubble chambers, supporting the hypothesis that scintillation\nproduction suppresses bubble nucleation by electron recoils while nuclear\nrecoils nucleate bubbles as usual. These measurements establish the\nnoble-liquid bubble chamber as a promising new technology for the detection of\nweakly interacting massive particle dark matter and coherent elastic\nneutrino-nucleus scattering.\n", "  For TOF positron emission tomography (TOF PET) detectors, time-to-digital\nconverters (TDCs) are essential to resolve the coincidence time of the photon\npairs. Recently, an efficient TDC structure called ring-oscillator-based\n(RO-based) Vernier TDC using carry chains was reported by our team. The method\nis very promising due to its low linearity error and low resource cost.\nHowever, the implementation complexity is rather high especially when moving to\nmulti-channels TDC designs, since this method calls for a manual intervention\nto the initial fitting results of the compilation software. In this paper, we\nelaborate the key points toward implementing high performance multi-channels\nTDCs of this kind while keeping the least implementation complexity.\nFurthermore, we propose an efficient fine time interpolator construction method\ncalled the period difference recording which only needs at most 31 adjustment\ntrials to obtain a targeted TDC resolution. To validate the techniques proposed\nin this paper, we built a 32-channels TDC on a Stratix III FPGA chip and fully\nevaluated its performance. Code density tests show that the obtained resolution\nresults lie in the range of (23 ps ~ 37 ps), the differential nonlinearity\n(DNL) results lie in the range of (-0.4 LSB ~ 0.4 LSB) and the integral\nnonlinearity (INL) results lie in the range of (-0.7 LSB ~ 0.7 LSB) for each of\nthe 32 TDC channels. This paper greatly eases the designing difficulty of the\ncarry chain RO-based TDCs and can significantly propel their development in\npractical use.\n", "  Using evolutionary crystal structure prediction algorithm USPEX, we identify\nthe compositions and crystal structures of stable compounds in the Fe-S system\nat pressures in the range 100-400 GPa. We find that at pressures of the Earth's\nsolid inner core (330-364 GPa) two compounds are stable - Fe2S and FeS. In\nequilibrium with iron, only Fe2S can exist in the inner core. Using the\nequation of state of Fe2S, we find that in order to reproduce the density of\nthe inner core by adding sulfur alone, 10.6-13.7 mol.% (6.4-8.4 wt.%) sulfur is\nneeded. Analogous calculation for silicon (where the only stable compound at\ninner core pressures is FeSi) reproduces the density of the inner core with\n9.0-11.8 mol.% (4.8-6.3 wt.%) silicon. In both cases, a virtually identical\nmean atomic mass M in the range 52.6-53.3 results for in the inner core, which\nis much higher than M = 49.3 determined for the inner core from Birch's law.\nFor oxygen (where the relevant stable oxide at conditions of the inner core is\nFe2O) we find the matching concentration in the range 13.2-17.2 mol.% (4.2-5.6\nwt.%), which corresponds to M in the range 49.0-50.6. Combining our results and\nprevious works, we find that inner core density and M can be explained by only\nfour models (in atomic %): (a) 86%(Fe+Ni) + 14%C, (b) 84%(Fe+Ni) + 16%O, (c)\n84%(Fe+Ni) + 7%S + 9%H, (d) 85%(Fe+Ni) + 6%Si + 9%H, and some of their linear\ncombinations (primarly, models (c) and (d)).\n", "  One of the key assumptions of the Standard Model of fundamental particles is\nthat the interactions of the charged leptons, namely electrons, muons, and\ntaus, differ only because of their different masses. While precision tests\ncomparing processes involving electrons and muons have not revealed any\nsignificant violation of this assumption, recent studies involving the\nhigher-mass tau lepton have resulted in observations that challenge lepton\nuniversality at the level of four standard deviations. A confirmation of these\nresults would point to new particles or interactions, and could have profound\nimplications for our understanding of particle physics.\n", "  Among Heusler compounds, the ones being magnetic semiconductors (also known\nas spin-filter materials) are widely studied as they offer novel\nfunctionalities in spintronic/magnetoelectronic devices. The spin-gapless\nsemiconductors are a special case. They possess a zero or almost-zero energy\ngap in one of the two spin channels. We employ the $GW$ approximation, which\nallows an elaborate treatment of the electronic correlations, to simulate the\nelectronic band structure of these materials. Our results suggest that in most\ncases the use of $GW$ self energy instead of the usual density functionals is\nimportant to accurately determine the electronic properties of magnetic\nsemiconductors.\n", "  It is well-established that many physical properties of DNA at sufficiently\nlong length scales can be understood by means of simple polymer models. One of\nthe most widely used elasticity models for DNA is the twistable worm-like chain\n(TWLC), which describes the double helix as a continuous elastic rod with\nbending and torsional stiffness. An extension of the TWLC, which has recently\nreceived some attention, is the model by Marko and Siggia, who introduced an\nadditional twist-bend coupling, expected to arise from the groove asymmetry. By\nperforming computer simulations of two available versions of oxDNA, a\ncoarse-grained model of nucleic acids, we investigate the microscopic origin of\ntwist-bend coupling. We show that this interaction is negligible in the oxDNA\nversion with symmetric grooves, while it appears in the oxDNA version with\nasymmetric grooves. Our analysis is based on the calculation of the covariance\nmatrix of equilibrium deformations, from which the stiffness parameters are\nobtained. The estimated twist-bend coupling coefficient from oxDNA simulations\nis $G=30\\pm1$~nm. The groove asymmetry induces a novel twist length scale and\nan associated renormalized twist stiffness $\\kappa_{\\rm t} \\approx 80$~nm,\nwhich is different from the intrinsic torsional stiffness $C \\approx 110$~nm.\nThis naturally explains the large variations on experimental estimates of the\nintrinsic stiffness performed in the past.\n", "  Since their discovery single-layer semiconducting transition metal\ndichalcogenides have attracted much attention thanks to their outstanding\noptical and mechanical properties. Strain engineering in these two-dimensional\nmaterials aims to tune their bandgap energy and to modify their optoelectronic\nproperties by the application of external strain. In this paper we demonstrate\nthat biaxial strain, both tensile and compressive, can be applied and released\nin a timescale of a few seconds in a reproducible way on transition metal\ndichalcogenides monolayers deposited on polymeric substrates. We can control\nthe amount of biaxial strain applied by letting the substrate expand or\ncompress. To do this we change the substrate temperature and choose materials\nwith a large thermal expansion coefficient. After the investigation of the\nsubstrate-dependent strain transfer, we performed micro-differential\nspectroscopy of four transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers (MoS2, MoSe2,\nWS2, WSe2) under the application of biaxial strain and measured their optical\nproperties. For tensile strain we observe a redshift of the bandgap that\nreaches a value as large as 95 meV/% in the case of single-layer WS2 deposited\non polypropylene. The observed bandgap shifts as a function of substrate\nextension/compression follow the order MoSe2 < MoS2 < WSe2 < WS2. Theoretical\ncalculations of these four materials under biaxial strain predict the same\ntrend for the material-dependent rates of the shift and reproduce well the\nfeatures observed in the measured reflectance spectra.\n", "  Kontsevich and Soibelman reformulated and slightly generalised the\ntopological recursion of math-ph/0702045, seeing it as a quantization of\ncertain quadratic Lagrangians in $T^*V$ for some vector space $V$. KS\ntopological recursion is a procedure which takes as initial data a quantum Airy\nstructure -- a family of at most quadratic differential operators on $V$\nsatisfying some axioms -- and gives as outcome a formal series of functions in\n$V$ (the partition function) simultaneously annihilated by these operators.\nFinding and classifying quantum Airy structures modulo gauge group action, is\nby itself an interesting problem which we study here. We provide some\nelementary, Lie-algebraic tools to address this problem, and give some elements\nof classification for ${\\rm dim}\\,V = 2$. We also describe four more\ninteresting classes of quantum Airy structures, coming from respectively\nFrobenius algebras (here we retrieve the 2d TQFT partition function as a\nspecial case), non-commutative Frobenius algebras, loop spaces of Frobenius\nalgebras and a $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-invariant version of the latter. This\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-invariant version in the case of a semi-simple Frobenius\nalgebra corresponds to the topological recursion of math-ph/0702045.\n", "  Most people simultaneously belong to several distinct social networks, in\nwhich their relations can be different. They have opinions about certain\ntopics, which they share and spread on these networks, and are influenced by\nthe opinions of other persons. In this paper, we build upon this observation to\npropose a new nodal centrality measure for multiplex networks. Our measure,\ncalled Opinion centrality, is based on a stochastic model representing opinion\npropagation dynamics in such a network. We formulate an optimization problem\nconsisting in maximizing the opinion of the whole network when controlling an\nexternal influence able to affect each node individually. We find a\nmathematical closed form of this problem, and use its solution to derive our\ncentrality measure. According to the opinion centrality, the more a node is\nworth investing external influence, and the more it is central. We perform an\nempirical study of the proposed centrality over a toy network, as well as a\ncollection of real-world networks. Our measure is generally negatively\ncorrelated with existing multiplex centrality measures, and highlights\ndifferent types of nodes, accordingly to its definition.\n", "  We study emerging notions of quantum correlations in compound systems. Based\non different definitions of quantumness in individual subsystems, we\ninvestigate how they extend to the joint description of a composite system.\nEspecially, we study the bipartite case and the connection of two typically\napplied and distinctively different concepts of nonclassicality in quantum\noptics and quantum information. Our investigation includes the representation\nof correlated states in terms of quasiprobability matrices, a comparative study\nof joint and conditional quantum correlations, and an entanglement\ncharacterization. It is, for example, shown that our composition approach\nalways includes entanglement as one form of quantum correlations. Yet, other\nforms of quantum correlations can also occur without entanglement. Finally, we\ngive an outlook towards multimode systems and temporal correlations.\n", "  We study the effect of brane polarization on the supersymmetry\ntransformations of probe anti-D3-branes at the tip of a Klebanov-Strassler\nthroat geometry. As is well known, the probe branes can polarize into\nNS5-branes and decay to a supersymmetric state by brane-flux annihilation. The\neffective potential has a metastable minimum as long as the number of\nanti-D3-branes is small compared to the number of flux quanta. We study the\nreduced four-dimensional effective NS5-brane theory and show that in the\nmetastable minimum supersymmetry is non-linearly realized to leading order, as\nexpected for spontaneously broken supersymmetry. However, a strict decoupling\nlimit of the higher order corrections in terms of a standard nilpotent\nsuperfield does not seem to exist. We comment on the possible implications of\nthese results for more general low-energy effective descriptions of inflation\nor de Sitter vacua.\n", "  We study the dynamical response to small distortions of a lattice about its\nuniform state, drifting through a dissipative medium due to an external force,\nand show, analytically and numerically, that the fluctuations, both transverse\nand longitudinal to the direction of the drift, exhibit spatiotemporal scaling\nbelonging to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Further, we predict\nthat a colloidal crystal drifting in a constant electric field is linearly\nstable against distortions and the distortions propagate as underdamped waves.\n", "  LRS (Locally Rotationally symmetric) Bianchi type-I magnetized strange quark\nmatter cosmological model have been studied based on $f(R,T)$ gravity. The\nexact solutions of the field equations are derived with linearly time varying\ndeceleration parameter which is consistent with observational data (from SNIa,\nBAO and CMB) of standard cosmology. It is observed that the model start with\nbig bang and ends with a Big Rip. The transition of deceleration parameter from\ndecelerating phase to accelerating phase with respect to redshift obtained in\nour model fits with the recent observational data obtained by Farook et al. in\n2017. The well known Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and distance modulus $\\mu(z)$ are\ndiscussed with redshift.\n", "  The recently discovered topological Dirac semimetal represents a new exotic\nquantum state of matter. Topological Dirac semimetals can be viewed as three\ndimensional analogues of graphene, in which the Dirac nodes are protected by\ncrystalline symmetry. It has been found that quantum confinement effect can gap\nout Dirac nodes and convert Dirac semimetal to a band insulator. The band\ninsulator is either normal insulator or quantum spin Hall insulator depending\non the thin film thickness. We present the study of disorder effects in thin\nfilm of Dirac semimetals. It is found that moderate Anderson disorder strength\ncan drive a topological phase transition from normal band insulator to\ntopological Anderson insulator in Dirac semimetal thin film. The numerical\ncalculation based on the model parameters of Dirac semimetal Na$_{3}$Bi shows\nthat in the topological Anderson insulator phase a quantized conductance\nplateau occurs in the bulk gap of band insulator, and the distributions of\nlocal currents further confirm that the quantized conductance plateau arises\nfrom the helical edge states induced by disorder. Finally, an effective medium\ntheory based on Born approximation fits the numerical data.\n", "  Recent experiments have triggered a debate about the ability of protons to\ntransfer through individual layers of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride\n(h-BN). However, calculations have shown that the barriers to proton\npenetration can, at more than 3 eV, be excessively high. Here, on the basis of\nfirst principles calculations, we show that the barrier for proton penetration\nis significantly reduced, to less than 1 eV, upon hydrogenation even in the\nabsence of pinholes in the lattice. Analysis reveals that the barrier is\nreduced because hydrogenation destabilises the initial state (a deep-lying\nchemisorption state) and expands the honeycomb lattice through which the\nprotons penetrate. This study offers a rationalization of the fast proton\ntransfer observed in experiments, and highlights the ability of proton\ntransport through single-layer materials in hydrogen rich solutions.\n", "  TRAPPIST-1 is a nearby ultra-cool dwarf that is host to a remarkable\nplanetary system consisting of seven transiting planets. The orbital properties\nand radii of the planets have been well-constrained, and recently the masses of\nthe inner six planets have been measured with additional ground and space-based\nphotometric observations. Large uncertainties in these mass measurements have\nprevented a robust analysis of the planetary compositions. Here we perform many\nthousands of N-body dynamical simulations with planet properties perturbed from\nthe observed values and identify those that are stable for millions of years.\nThis allows us to identify self-consistent orbital solutions that can be used\nin future studies. From our range of dynamical masses, we find that most of the\nplanets are consistent with an Earth-like composition, where TRAPPIST-1f is\nlikely to have a volatile-rich envelope.\n", "  In this article, we study a class of non-selfadjoint Schr{\\\"o}dinger\noperators H which are perturbation of some model operator H 0 satisfying a\nweighted coercive assumption. For the model operator H 0 , we prove that the\nderivatives of the resolvent satisfy some Gevrey estimates at threshold zero.\nAs application, we establish large time expansions of semigroups e --tH and e\n--itH for t > 0 with subexponential time-decay estimates on the remainder,\nincluding possible presence of zero eigenvalue and real resonances.\n", "  Starting from the end of the past century, the importance has been recognized\nof the effect of isotopic composition on some of the temperature fixed points\nfor the most accurate realizations of the ITS-90. In the original definition of\nthe latter, dating back to 1990, only a generic reference was made to natural\ncomposition of the substances used for the realization of the fixed points,\nexcept for helium. The definition of a reference isotopic composition for three\nfixed points, e-H2, Ne and H2O, while eliminating the non-uniqueness of the\nScale in this respect, induced detectable differences in the present and future\nrealizations of the Scale, at the highest accuracy level, with respect to the\nprevious realizations, when they affected the results of past key comparisons,\nnamely the K1 and K1.1, and K2 and K2.1 to K2.5 and the related regional and\nsupplementary ones. The paper provides evidence of the extent of this effect by\nusing the results of the relevant key comparisons for Neon archived in the BIPM\nKCDB, and of other comparisons existing in the literature: 1979-1984, 2007-2012\nand 2009-2010 sealed cell comparisons; and discusses the meaning and the\noutcomes of this evaluation.\n", "  We study supersymmetric (SUSY) models in which the muon $g-2$ discrepancy and\nthe dark matter relic abundance are simultaneously explained. The muon $g-2$\ndiscrepancy, or a 3$\\sigma$ deviation between the experimental and theoretical\nresults of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, can be resolved by SUSY models,\nwhich implies at least three SUSY multiplets have masses of\n$\\mathop{\\mathcal{O}}(100)\\, \\mathrm{GeV}$. In particular, models with the\nbino, higgsino and slepton having $\\mathop{\\mathcal{O}}(100)\\, \\mathrm{GeV}$\nmasses are not only capable to explain the muon $g-2$ discrepancy but naturally\ncontains the neutralino dark matter with the observed relic abundance. We study\nconstraints and future prospects of such models; in particular, we find that\nthe LHC search for events with two hadronic taus and missing transverse\nmomentum can probe this scenario through chargino/neutralino production. It is\nshown that almost all the parameter space of the scenario can be probed at the\nhigh-luminosity LHC, and a large part can also be tested at the XENON1T\nexperiment as well as at the ILC.\n", "  We study generalised calibrations described by Exceptional Sasaki-Einstein\nstructures on AdS backgrounds in type IIB and M-theory, placing the focus on\nthe generalised Reeb vectors. The inequalities for the energy bound are derived\nby decomposing a $\\kappa$-symmetry condition and equivalently, bispinors in\ncalibration conditions from existing literature. We explain how the closure of\nthe calibration forms is related to the integrability conditions of the\nExceptional Sasaki-Einstein structure, in particular for AdS space-filling or\npoint-like branes. Doing so, we show that the form parts of the twisted vector\nstructure in M-theory provides generalised calibrations, reproducing the result\nconjectured in a recent paper. The IIB case yields analogous results. Finally,\nwe discuss briefly the extension of the conjecture to hypermultiplet structures\nand other brane configurations.\n", "  We present measurements of the frequency transfer stability and analysis of\nthe noise characteristics of an optical signal propagating over aerial\nsuspended fiber links up to 153.6 km in length. The measured frequency transfer\nstability over these links is on the order of 10^-11 at an integration time of\none second dropping to 10^-12 for integration times longer than 100 s. We show\nthat wind-loading of the cable spans is the dominant source of short-timescale\nnoise on the fiber links. We also report an attempt to stabilize the optical\nfrequency transfer over these aerial links.\n", "  We present a stabilized microwave-frequency transfer technique that is based\non optical phase-sensing and optical phase-actuation. This technique shares\nseveral attributes with optical-frequency transfer and therefore exhibits\nseveral advantages over other microwave-frequency transfer techniques. We\ndemonstrated stabilized transfer of an 8,000 MHz microwave-frequency signal\nover a 166 km metropolitan optical fiber network, achieving a fractional\nfrequency stability of 6.8x10^-14 Hz/Hz at 1 s integration, and 5.0x10^-16\nHz/Hz at 1.6x10^4 s. This technique is being considered for use on the Square\nKilometre Array SKA1-mid radio telescope.\n", "  Using a multi-layered printed circuit board, we propose a 3D architecture\nsuitable for packaging supercon- ducting chips, especially chips that contain\ntwo-dimensional qubit arrays. In our proposed architecture, the center strips\nof the buried coplanar waveguides protrude from the surface of a dielectric\nlayer as contacts. Since the contacts extend beyond the surface of the\ndielectric layer, chips can simply be flip-chip packaged with on-chip\nreceptacles clinging to the contacts. Using this scheme, we packaged a\nmulti-qubit chip and per- formed single-qubit and two-qubit quantum gate\noperations. The results indicate that this 3D architecture provides a promising\nscheme for scalable quantum computing.\n", "  In this paper, we consider spatially flat FLRW cosmological models in two\ncontexts in an attempt to derive a set of conditions that characterize when\nsuch models exhibit oscillatory behaviour. In the first case, we consider a\nspatially flat FLRW model with only a minimally-coupled scalar field, described\nby a nonnegative scalar field potential. In the second case, we extended this\nmodel to include barotropic matter. We show that for the case of a positive\ncosmological constant, spatial flatness, and barotropic matter, oscillatory\nsolutions are certainly possible. However, these solutions do not oscillate\nindefinitely, they decay over time. Interestingly, it is shown that all such\nsolutions oscillate and decay towards the de Sitter equilibrium point, which\nrepresents an inflationary epoch in such models. This implies that for certain\nfamilies of scalar field potentials, the universe may have undergone several\noscillations \\emph{before} entering an inflationary epoch.\n", "  Recent investigations on the Hamiltonian of excitons by F. Schweiner et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 046401 (2017)] revealed that the combined presence of a\ncubic band structure and external fields breaks all antiunitary symmetries. The\nnearest neighbor spacing distribution of magnetoexcitons can exhibit Poissonian\nstatistics, the statistics of a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) or a\nGaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) depending on the system parameters. Hence,\nmagnetoexcitons are an ideal system to investigate the transitions between\nthese statistics. Here we investigate the transitions between GOE and GUE\nstatistics and between Poissonian and GUE statistics by changing the angle of\nthe magnetic field with respect to the crystal lattice and by changing the\nscaled energy known from the hydrogen atom in external fields. Comparing our\nresults with analytical formulae for these transitions derived with random\nmatrix theory, we obtain a very good agreement and thus confirm the Wigner\nsurmise for the exciton system.\n", "  3C 400.2 belongs to the mixed morphology supernova remnant class, showing\ncenter-filled X-ray and shell-like radio morphology. We present a study of 3C\n400.2 with archival Suzaku and Fermi-LAT observations. We find recombining\nplasma (RP) in the Suzaku spectra of north-east and south-east regions. The\nspectra of these regions are well described by two-component thermal plasma\nmodels: The hard component is in RP, while the soft component is in collisional\nionization equilibrium (CIE) conditions. The RP has enhanced abundances\nindicating that the X-ray emission has an ejecta origin, while the CIE has\nsolar abundances associated with the interstellar material. The X-ray spectra\nof north-west and south-west regions are best fitted by a two-component thermal\nplasma model: an ionizing and a CIE plasma. We have detected GeV gamma-ray\nemission from 3C 400.2 at the level of $\\sim$5$\\sigma$ assuming a point-like\nsource model with a power-law (PL) type spectrum. We have also detected a new\nGeV source at the level of $\\sim$13$\\sigma$ assuming a Gaussian extension model\nwith a PL type spectrum in the neighborhood of the SNR. We report the analysis\nresults of 3C 400.2 and the new extended gamma-ray source and discuss the\nnature of gamma-ray emission of 3C 400.2 in the context of existing NANTEN CO\ndata, DRAO HI data, and the Suzaku X-ray analysis results.\n", "  In this study, an alloy phase-field model is used to simulate solidification\nmicrostructures at different locations within a solidified molten pool. The\ntemperature gradient $G$ and the solidification velocity $V$ are obtained from\na macroscopic heat transfer finite element simulation and provided as input to\nthe phase-field model. The effects of laser beam speed and the location within\nthe melt pool on the primary arm spacing and on the extent of Nb partitioning\nat the cell tips are investigated. Simulated steady-state primary spacings are\ncompared with power law and geometrical models. Cell tip compositions are\ncompared to a dendrite growth model. The extent of non-equilibrium interface\npartitioning of the phase-field model is investigated. Although the phase-field\nmodel has an anti-trapping solute flux term meant to maintain local interface\nequilibrium, we have found that during simulations it was insufficient at\nmaintaining equilibrium. This is due to the fact that the additive\nmanufacturing solidification conditions fall well outside the allowed limits of\nthis flux term.\n", "  We provide comprehensive investigations for the mass spectrum of exotic\nopen-flavor charmed/bottom $sq\\bar q\\bar c$, $qq\\bar q\\bar c$, $sq\\bar q\\bar\nb$, $qq\\bar q\\bar b$ tetraquark states with various spin-parity assignments\n$J^P=0^+, 1^+, 2^+$ and $0^-, 1^-$ in the framework of QCD sum rules. In the\ndiquark configuration, we construct the diquark-antidiquark interpolating\ntetraquark currents using the color-antisymmetric scalar and axial-vector\ndiquark fields. The stable mass sum rules are established in reasonable\nparameter working ranges, which are used to give reliable mass predictions for\nthese tetraquark states. We obtain the mass spectra for the open-flavor\ncharmed/bottom $sq\\bar q\\bar c$, $qq\\bar q\\bar c$, $sq\\bar q\\bar b$, $qq\\bar\nq\\bar b$ tetraquark states with various spin-parity quantum numbers. In\naddition, we suggest searching for exotic doubly-charged tetraquarks, such as\n$[sd][\\bar u\\bar c]\\to D_s^{(\\ast)-}\\pi^-$ in future experiments at facilities\nsuch as BESIII, BelleII, PANDA, LHCb and CMS, etc.\n", "  Networks provide an informative, yet non-redundant description of complex\nsystems only if links represent truly dyadic relationships that cannot be\ndirectly traced back to node-specific properties such as size, importance, or\ncoordinates in some embedding space. In any real-world network, some links may\nbe reducible, and others irreducible, to such local properties. This dichotomy\npersists despite the steady increase in data availability and resolution, which\nactually determines an even stronger need for filtering techniques aimed at\ndiscerning essential links from non-essential ones. Here we introduce a\nrigorous method that, for any desired level of statistical significance,\noutputs the network backbone that is irreducible to the local properties of\nnodes, i.e. their degrees and strengths. Unlike previous approaches, our method\nemploys an exact maximum-entropy formulation guaranteeing that the filtered\nnetwork encodes only the links that cannot be inferred from local information.\nExtensive empirical analysis confirms that this approach uncovers essential\nbackbones that are otherwise hidden amidst many redundant relationships and\ninaccessible to other methods. For instance, we retrieve the hub-and-spoke\nskeleton of the US airport network and many specialised patterns of\ninternational trade. Being irreducible to local transportation and economic\nconstraints of supply and demand, these backbones single out genuinely\nhigher-order wiring principles.\n", "  We have used mesoscale simulations to study the effect of immobile particles\non microstructure formation during spinodal decomposition in ternary mixtures\nsuch as polymer blends. Specifically, we have explored a regime of\ninterparticle spacings (which are a few times the characteristic spinodal\nlength scale) in which we might expect interesting new effects arising from\ninteractions among wetting, spinodal decomposition and coarsening. In this\npaper, we report three new effects for systems in which the particle phase has\na strong preference for being wetted by one of the components (say, A). In the\npresence of particles, microstructures are not bicontinuous in a symmetric\nmixture. An asymmetric mixture, on the other hand, first forms a\nnon-bicontinuous microstructure which then evolves into a bicontinuous one at\nintermediate times. Moreover, while wetting of the particle phase by the\npreferred component (A) creates alternating A-rich and B-rich layers around the\nparticles, curvature-driven coarsening leads to shrinking and disappearance of\nthe first A-rich layer, leaving a layer of the non-preferred component in\ncontact with the particle. At late simulation times, domains of the matrix\ncomponents coarsen following the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner law, $R_1(t) \\sim\nt^{1/3}$.\n", "  Deep connections between invariant theory and entanglement have been known\nfor some time and been the object of intense study. This includes the study of\nlocal unitary equivalence of density operators as well as entanglement that can\nbe observed in stochastic local operations assisted by classical communication\n(SLOCC). An important aspect of both of these areas is the computation of\ncomplete sets of invariants polynomials. For local unitary equivalence as well\nas $n$-qubit SLOCC invariants, complete descriptions of these invariants exist.\nHowever, these descriptions give infinite sets; of great interest is finding\ngenerating sets of invariants. In this regard, degree bounds are highly sought\nafter to limit the possible sizes of such generating sets. In this paper we\ngive new upper bounds on the degrees of the invariants, both for a certain\ncomplete set of local unitary invariants as well as the $n$-qubit SLOCC\ninvariants. We show that there exists a complete set of local unitary\ninvariants of density operators in a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$, of dimension\n$d$, which are generated by invariants of degree at most $d^4$. This in turn\nallows us to show that the $n$-qubit SLOCC invariants are generated by\ninvariants of degree at most $2^{4n}$.\n", "  It is now about 30 years ago that photometric and spectroscopic surveys of\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) uncovered\nthe first examples of truly massive (> 3-4 M_s) O-rich AGB stars experiencing\nhot bottom burning (HBB). Massive (Li-rich) HBB AGB stars were later identified\nin our own Galaxy and they pertain to the Galactic population of obscured OH/IR\nstars. High-resolution optical spectroscopic surveys have revealed the massive\nGalactic AGB stars to be strongly enriched in Rb compared to other nearby\ns-process elements like Zr, confirming that Ne22 is the dominant neutron source\nin these stars. Similar surveys of OH/IR stars in the MCs disclosed their\nRb-rich low-metallicity counterparts, showing that these stars are usually\nbrighter (because of HBB flux excess) than the standard adopted luminosity\nlimit for AGB stars (Mbol~-7.1) and that they might have stellar masses of at\nleast ~6-7 M_s. The chemical composition and photometric variability are\nefficient separating the massive AGB stars from massive red supergiants (RSG)\nbut the main difficulty is to distinguish between massive AGB and super-AGB\nstars because the present theoretical nucleosynthesis models predict both stars\nto be chemically identical. Here I review the available multiwavelength (from\nthe optical to the far-IR) observations on massive AGB and super-AGB stars as\nwell as the current caveats and limitations in our undestanding of these stars.\nFinally, I underline the expected observations on massive AGB and super-AGB\nstars from on-going massive surveys like Gaia and SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2 and future\nfacilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope.\n", "  Using combined low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic\nforce microscopy (AFM), we demonstrate hydrogen passivation of individual,\nselected dangling bonds (DBs) on a hydrogen-passivated Si(100)-2$\\times$1\nsurface (H-Si) by atom manipulation. This method allows erasing of DBs and thus\nprovides an error-correction scheme for hydrogen lithography. Si-terminated\ntips (Si tips) for hydrogen desorption and H-terminated tips (H tips) for\nhydrogen passivation are both created by deliberate contact to the H-Si surface\nand are assigned by their characteristic contrast in AFM. DB passivation is\nachieved by transferring the H atom that is at the apex of an H tip to the DB,\nreestablishing a locally defect-free H-Si surface.\n", "  I report on recent results obtained within the Hamiltonian approach to QCD in\nCoulomb gauge. Furthermore this approach is compared to recent lattice data,\nwhich were obtained by an alternative gauge fixing method and which show an\nimproved agreement with the continuum results. By relating the Gribov\nconfinement scenario to the center vortex picture of confinement it is shown\nthat the Coulomb string tension is tied to the spatial string tension. For the\nquark sector a vacuum wave functional is used which explicitly contains the\ncoupling of the quarks to the transverse gluons and which results in\nvariational equations which are free of ultraviolet divergences. The\nvariational approach is extended to finite temperatures by compactifying a\nspatial dimension. The effective potential of the Polyakov loop is evaluated\nfrom the zero-temperature variational solution. For pure Yang--Mills theory,\nthe deconfinement phase transition is found to be second order for SU(2) and\nfirst order for SU(3), in agreement with the lattice results. The corresponding\ncritical temperatures are found to be $275 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$ and $280 \\,\n\\mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. When quarks are included, the deconfinement\ntransition turns into a cross-over. From the dual and chiral quark condensate\none finds pseudo-critical temperatures of $198 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$ and $170 \\,\n\\mathrm{MeV}$, respectively, for the deconfinement and chiral transition.\n", "  The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method has been successfully applied\nto obtain energies and wave functions for two electrons in a quantum dot\nmodeled by a three dimensional harmonic potential. The FDTD method uses the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) in imaginary time. The TDSE is\nnumerically solved with an initial random wave function and after enough\nsimulation time, the wave function converges to the ground state wave function.\nThe excited states are determined by using the same procedure for the ground\nstate with additional constraints that the wave function must be orthogonal\nwith all lower energy wave functions. The numerical results for energies and\nwave functions for different parameters of confinement potentials are given and\ncompared with published results using other numerical methods. It is shown that\nthe FDTD method gives accurate energies and wave functions.\n", "  We present a synthesis framework to map logic networks into quantum circuits\nfor quantum computing. The synthesis framework is based on LUT networks\n(lookup-table networks), which play a key role in conventional logic synthesis.\nEstablishing a connection between LUTs in a LUT network and reversible\nsingle-target gates in a reversible network allows us to bridge conventional\nlogic synthesis with logic synthesis for quantum computing, despite several\nfundamental differences. We call our synthesis framework LUT-based Hierarchical\nReversible Logic Synthesis (LHRS). Input to LHRS is a classical logic network;\noutput is a quantum network (realized in terms of Clifford+$T$ gates). The\nframework offers to trade-off the number of qubits for the number of quantum\ngates. In a first step, an initial network is derived that only consists of\nsingle-target gates and already completely determines the number of qubits in\nthe final quantum network. Different methods are then used to map each\nsingle-target gate into Clifford+$T$ gates, while aiming at optimally using\navailable resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in\nautomatically synthesizing IEEE compliant floating point networks up to double\nprecision. As many quantum algorithms target scientific simulation\napplications, they can make rich use of floating point arithmetic components.\nBut due to the lack of quantum circuit descriptions for those components, it\ncan be difficult to find a realistic cost estimation for the algorithms. Our\nsynthesized benchmarks provide cost estimates that allow quantum algorithm\ndesigners to provide the first complete cost estimates for a host of quantum\nalgorithms. Thus, the benchmarks and, more generally, the LHRS framework are an\nessential step towards the goal of understanding which quantum algorithms will\nbe practical in the first generations of quantum computers.\n", "  We analyze classical and quantum chiral ring relations of four dimensional\n${\\cal N} = 1$ adjoint SQCD with superpotential turned on for the adjoint\nfield. In particular, for the mass deformed theory we obtain the complete on\nshell vacuum expectation value for various gauge invariant chiral operators and\nfind non-trivial gaugino condensations. When approaching to massless limit\nnontrivial flat directions in the moduli space of vacua appear, where the\nCoulomb branch can be naturally classified and the Higgs branch receives\nquantum corrections. We argue that the solution of the chiral ring is in\none-to-one correspondence with supersymmetric vacua, provided that an\nadditional Konishi anomaly equation is included.\n", "  The next generation Very Large Array project (ngVLA) would represent a major\nstep forward in sensitivity and resolution for radio astronomy, with ability to\nachieve 2 milli-arcsec resolution at 100 GHz (assuming a maximum baseline of\n300 km). For science on spatial scales of >~ 1 arcsec, the ngVLA project should\nconsider the use of a large single dish telescope to provide short-spacing\ndata. Large single-dish telescopes are complementary to interferometers and are\ncrucial to providing sensitivity to spatial scales lost by interferometry.\nAssuming the current vision of the ngVLA (300 18m dishes) and by studying\npossible array configurations, I argue that a single dish with a diameter of >=\n45m with approximately 20 element receiver systems would be well matched to the\nngVLA for mapping observations.\n", "  We are at an interesting juncture in cosmology. With new methods and\ntechnology, the accuracy in measurement of the Hubble constant has vastly\nimproved, but a recent tension has arisen that is either signaling new physics\nor as-yet unrecognized uncertainties.\n", "  We investigate the stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) between the\nstellar mass and the integrated gas velocity dispersion, quantified by the\nkinematic estimator S_0.5 measured from strong emission lines in spectra of\ngalaxies at 0<z<5. We combine luminosity-selected galaxies (`high-luminosity\nsample') with galaxies selected in other ways (`low-luminosity sample') to\ncover a range in stellar mass that spans almost five orders of magnitude: 7.0 <\nlog M* < 11.5. We find that the logarithmic power-law slope and normalisation\nof the TFR are independent of redshift out to z~3. The scatter in the TFR is\n<0.5 dex such that the gas velocity dispersion can be used as a proxy for the\nstellar mass of a galaxy independently of its redshift. At z>3 the scatter\nincreases and the existence of a correlation is not obvious. The\nhigh-luminosity sample exhibits a flatter slope of 1.5$\\pm$0.2 at z<3 compared\nto the low-luminosity sample slope of 2.9$\\pm$0.3, suggesting a turnover in the\nTFR. The combined sample is well fit with a break in the TFR at a\ncharacteristic stellar mass scale of M*~10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, with no\nsignificant evolution out to z~3. We demonstrate that a break in the TFR with a\nsteeper slope at the low-mass end is a natural consequence of galaxy models\nwith a mass-dependent stellar to halo-mass ratio.\n", "  The science investigation teams (SITs) for the WFIRST coronagraphic\ninstrument have begun studying the capabilities of the instrument to directly\nimage reflected light off from exoplanets at contrasts down to contrasts of\n~10^-9 with respect to the stellar flux. Detection of point sources at these\nhigh contrasts requires yield estimates and detailed modeling of the image of\nthe planetary system as it propagates through the telescope optics. While the\nSITs might generate custom astrophysical scenes, the integrated model,\npropagated through the internal speckle field, is typically done at JPL. In\nthis white paper, we present a standard file format to ensure a single\ndistribution system between those who produce the raw astrophysical scenes, and\nJPL modelers who incorporate those scenes into their optical modeling. At its\ncore, our custom file format uses FITS files, and incorporates standards on\npackaging astrophysical scenes. This includes spectral and astrometric\ninformation for planetary and stellar point sources, zodiacal light and\nextragalactic sources that may appear as contaminants. Adhering to such a\nuniform data distribution format is necessary, as it ensures seamless work flow\nbetween the SITs and modelers at JPL for the goals of understanding limits of\nthe WFIRST coronagraphic instrument.\n", "  This paper presents a set of validation metrics for transmission network\nparameters that is applicable in both creation of synthetic power system test\ncases and validation of existing models. Using actual data from two real-world\npower grids, statistical analyses are performed to extract some useful\nstatistics on transformers and transmission lines electrical parameters\nincluding per unit reactance, MVA rating, and their X/R ratio. It is found that\nconversion of per unit reactance calculated on system common base to\ntransformer own power base will significantly stabilize its range and remove\nthe correlation between per unit X and MVA rating. This is fairly consistent\nfor transformers with different voltage levels and sizes and can be utilized as\na strong validation metric for synthetic models. It is found that transmission\nlines exhibit different statistical properties than transformers with different\ndistribution and range for the parameters. In addition, statistical analysis\nshows that the empirical PDF of transmission network electrical parameters can\nbe approximated with mathematical distribution functions which would help\nappropriately characterize them in synthetic power networks. Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence is used as a measure for goodness of fit for approximated\ndistributions.\n", "  Increasing penetration level of photovoltaic (PV) distributed generation (DG)\ninto distribution networks will have many impacts on nominal circuit operating\nconditions including voltage quality and reverse power flow issues. In U.S.\nmost studies on PVDG impacts on distribution networks are performed for west\ncoast and central states. The objective of this paper is to study the impacts\nof PVDG integration on local distribution network based on real-world settings\nfor network parameters and time-series analysis. PVDG penetration level is\nconsidered to find the hosting capacity of the network without having major\nissues in terms of voltage quality and reverse power flow. Time-series analyses\nshow that distributed installation of PVDGs on commercial buses has the maximum\nnetwork energy loss reduction and larger penetration ratios for them.\nAdditionally, the penetration ratio thresholds for which there will be no power\nquality and reverse power flow issues and optimal allocation of PVDG and\npenetration levels are identified for different installation scenarios.\n", "  Remarkable penetration of renewable energy in electric networks, despite its\nvaluable opportunities, such as power loss reduction and loadability\nimprovements, has raised concerns for system operators. Such huge penetration\ncan lead to a violation of the grid requirements, such as voltage and current\nlimits and reverse power flow. Optimal placement and sizing of Distributed\nGeneration (DG) are one of the best ways to strengthen the efficiency of the\npower systems. This paper builds a simulation model for the local distribution\nnetwork based on obtained load profiles, GIS information, solar insolation,\nfeeder and voltage settings, and define the optimization problem of solar PVDG\ninstallation to determine the optimal siting and sizing for different\npenetration levels with different objective functions. The objective functions\ninclude voltage profile improvement and energy loss minimization and the\nconsidered constraints include the physical distribution network constraints\n(AC power flow), the PV capacity constraint, and the voltage and reverse power\nflow constraints.\n", "  We have determined the solar modulation potential, phi, vs. time that is\nobserved at Voyager 1 and 2 from measurements of the H and He nuclei\nintensities at a common energy of 250 MeVnuc. The H nuclei have a rigidity 0.7\nGV, the He nuclei 1.4 GV. These measurements cover a 40 year time period, which\nincludes almost 4 cycles of solar 11 year sunspot variations, throughout the\ninner heliosphere out to the HTS at distances of 95 AU and 85 AU, respectively\nat V1 and V2, and then beyond in the heliosheath. Inside the HTS the modulation\npotential vs. time curves at V1 and V2 show a very similar temporal structure\nto those observed at the Earth. During a later period of maximum solar\nmodulation from 2000.0 to 2005.0 when V1 and V2 are in the outer heliosphere\nbetween 60-94 AU, the main temporal features of the modulation potential curves\nat all 3 locations match up with appropriate time delays at V1 and V2 if it is\nassumed that spatially coherent structures are moving outward past V1 and V2,\nwith outward speeds of up to 700 Kms negative 1. After 2004.0 V1 and V2 are at\nlatitudes of positive 35 and negative 30 respectively, placing lower limits on\nthe latitude extent of these structures. Beyond the HTS in the heliosheath the\nmodulation potential slowly decreases at both spacecraft with only a weak\nevidence of the unusual modulation minimum observed at the Earth in 2009, for\nexample. A sudden decrease of the modulation potential 50 MV for both H and He\nnuclei occurs at V1 just before the heliopause crossing at about 122 AU. This\ndecrease has not yet been observed at V2, which is now at 113 AU and still\nobserving a modulation potential 60 MV.\n", "  Because of their loosely bound electrons, electrides offer physical\nproperties useful in chemical synthesis and electronics. For these applications\nand others, nano-sized electrides offer advantages, but to-date no electride\nhas been synthesized as a nanomaterial. We demonstrate experimentally that\nCa$_2$N, a layered electride in which layers of atoms are separated by layers\nof a 2D electron gas (2DEG), can be exfoliated into two-dimensional (2D)\nnanosheets using liquid exfoliation. The 2D flakes are stable in a nitrogen\natmosphere or in select organic solvents for at least one month. Electron\nmicroscopy and elemental analysis reveal that the 2D flakes retain the crystal\nstructure and stoichiometry of the parent 3D Ca$_2$N. In addition, the 2D\nflakes exhibit metallic character and an optical response that agrees with DFT\ncalculations. Together these findings suggest that the 2DEG is preserved in the\n2D material. With this work, we bring electrides into the nano-regime and\nexperimentally demonstrate a 2D electride, Ca$_2$N.\n", "  A new laboratory-generated chemical compound made from photodissociated\nammonia (NH3) molecules reacting with acetylene (C2H2) was suggested as a\npossible coloring agent for Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) by Carlson et al.\n(2016, Icarus 274, 106-115). Baines et al. (2016, Icarus, submitted) showed\nthat the GRS spectrum measured by the visual channels of the Cassini VIMS\ninstrument in 2000 could be accurately fit by a cloud model in which the\nchromophore appeared as a physically thin layer of small particles immediately\nabove the main cloud layer of the GRS. Here we show that the same chromophore\nand same layer location can also provide close matches to the short wave\nspectra of many other cloud features on Jupiter, suggesting this material may\nbe a nearly universal chromophore that could explain the various degrees of red\ncoloration on Jupiter. This is a robust conclusion, even for 12% changes in\nVIMS calibration and large uncertainties in the refractive index of the main\ncloud layer due to uncertain fractions of NH4SH and NH3 in its cloud particles.\nThe chromophore layer can account for color variations among north and south\nequatorial belts, equatorial zone, and the Great Red Spot, by varying particle\nsize from 0.12 microns to 0.29 microns and 1-micron optical depth from 0.06 to\n0.76. The total mass of the chromophore layer is much less variable, ranging\nfrom 18 to 30 micrograms/cm^2, except in the equatorial zone, where it is only\n10-13 micrograms/cm^2. We also found a depression of the ammonia volume mixing\nratio in the two belt regions, which averaged 0.4-0.5 X 10^{-4} immediately\nbelow the ammonia condensation level, while the other regions averaged twice\nthat value.\n", "  In principle a minimal extension of the standard model of Particle Physics,\nthe two Higgs doublet model, can be invoked to explain the scalar field\nresponsible of dark energy. The two doublets are in general mixed. After\ndiagonalization, the lightest CP-even Higgs and CP-odd Higgs are jointly taken\nto be the dark energy candidate. The dark energy obtained from Higgs fields in\nthis case is indistinguishable from the cosmological constant.\n", "  We comment on the relation between string theory and empirical science,\ngrounding our discussion in cosmology, a subject with increasingly precise data\nin which this connection operates at several levels. It is important to take\ninto account the phenomenon of dangerous irrelevance: over long times or large\nfield ranges, physics can become sensitive to higher scales than the input\nenergies. This pertains in inflationary cosmology (and possibly other aspects\nof horizon physics). String theory also contributes to our understanding of\nobservational constraints and search strategies at the level of low energy\nfield theory. We illustrate this with a current example concerning a new form\nof non-Gaussianity generated by very massive degrees of freedom coupling to the\ninflaton. New constraints on such fields and couplings can be obtained from\nexisting data, increasing our empirical knowledge of the universe. This builds\nin part from the development of the string landscape, which is neither random\nnor an abdication of science as has sometimes been suggested. {\\it Invited\ncontribution to the proceedings of the conference `Why trust a theory'.}\n", "  In this article we make a case for a systematic application of complex\nnetwork science to study art market history and more general collection\ndynamics. We reveal social, temporal, spatial, and conceptual network\ndimensions, i.e. network node and link types, previously implicit in the Getty\nProvenance Index (GPI). As a pioneering art history database active since the\n1980s, the GPI provides online access to source material relevant for research\nin the history of collecting and art markets. Based on a subset of the GPI, we\ncharacterize an aggregate of more than 267,000 sales transactions connected to\nroughly 22,000 actors in four countries over 20 years at daily resolution from\n1801 to 1820. Striving towards a deeper understanding on multiple levels we\ndisambiguate social dynamics of buying, brokering, and selling, while observing\na general broadening of the market, where large collections are split into\nsmaller lots. Temporally, we find annual market cycles that are shifted by\ncountry and obviously favor international exchange. Spatially, we differentiate\nnear-monopolies from regions driven by competing sub-centers, while uncovering\nasymmetries of international market flux. Conceptually, we track dynamics of\nartist attribution that clearly behave like product categories in a very slow\nsupermarket. Taken together, we introduce a number of meaningful network\nperspectives dealing with historical art auction data, beyond the analysis of\nsocial networks within a single market region. The results presented here have\ninspired a Linked Open Data conversion of the GPI, which is currently in\nprocess and will allow further analysis by a broad set of researchers.\n", "  This work summarizes recent development in the filed of nanocrystal and their\nuse for optoelectronics. After the introduction on nanocrystals and their\ntransport properties, the manuscript is splitted in three parts : (i) narrow\nabnd gap materials, (ii) 2D colloidal material and (iii) van der waals\nheterostrctures\n", "  The phase shift's influence of two strong pulsed laser waves on effective\ninteraction of electrons was studied. Considerable amplification of electrons\nrepulsion in the certain range of phase shifts and waves intensities is shown.\nThat leads to electrons scatter on greater distances than without an external\nfield. The value of the distance can be greater on 2-3 order of magnitude. Also\nconsiderable influence of the phase shift of pulses of waves on the possibility\nof effective attraction of electrons is shown.\n", "  Resistive drift wave turbulence is a multipurpose paradigm that can be used\nto understand transport at the edge of fusion devices. The Hasegawa-Wakatani\nmodel captures the essential physics of drift turbulence while retaining the\nsimplicity needed to gain a qualitative understanding of this process. We\nprovide a theoretical interpretation of numerically generated probability\ndensity functions (PDFs) of intermittent events in Hasegawa-Wakatani turbulence\nwith enforced equipartition of energy in large scale zonal flows and small\nscale drift turbulence. We find that for a wide range of adiabatic index values\nthe stochastic component representing the small scale turbulent eddies of the\nflow, obtained from the ARIMA model, exhibits super-diffusive statistics,\nconsistent with intermittent transport. The PDFs of large events (above one\nstandard deviation) are well approximated by the Laplace distribution, while\nsmall events often exhibit a Gaussian character. Furthermore there exist a\nstrong influence of zonal flows for example, via shearing and then viscous\ndissipation maintaining a sub-diffusive character of the fluxes.\n", "  Graphene displays properties which make it appealing for neuroregenerative\nmedicine, yet its interaction with peripheral neurons has been scarcely\ninvestigated. Here, we culture on graphene two established models for\nperipheral neurons: PC12 cells and DRG primary neurons. We perform a\nnano-resolved analysis of polymeric coatings on graphene and combine optical\nmicroscopy and viability assays to assess the material cytocompatibility and\ninfluence on differentiation. We find that differentiated PC12 cells display a\nremarkably increased neurite length on graphene (up to 35%) with respect to\ncontrols. DRG primary neurons survive both on bare and coated graphene and\npresent dense axonal networks.\n", "  We investigate the current-current correlations in a four-terminal Al-AlOx-Al\ntunnel junction where shot noise dominates. We demonstrate that\ncross-correlations in the presence of two biasing sources of the Hanbury-Brown\nand Twiss type are much stronger (approximately twice) than an incoherent sum\nof correlations generated by single sources. The difference is due to voltage\nfluctuations of the central island that give rise to current-current\ncorrelations in the four contacts of the junction. Our measurements are in\nclose agreement with results obtained using a simple theoretical model based on\nthe theory of shot noise in multi-terminal conductors, generalized here to\narbitrary contacts.\n", "  We report on the isotope shift between ${}^{88}$Sr and ${}^{87}$Sr on the\n${}^1S_0 - {}^3P_0$ clock transitions. The interleaved operation of an optical\nlattice clock with two isotopes allows the canceling out of common\nperturbations, such as the quadratic Zeeman shift, the clock-light shift, and\nthe blackbody radiation shift. The isotope shift is determined to be 62 188\n134.004(10) Hz, where the major uncertainty is introduced by the collisional\nshift that is distinct for each isotope. Our result allows us to determine the\nfrequency of $^{88}$Sr-$^{87}$Sr optical lattice clocks with a fractional\nuncertainty of $2\\times 10^{-17}$. The scheme is generally applicable for\nmeasuring the isotope shift with significantly reduced uncertainty.\n", "  Hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of hot accretion flow have\nindicated that there is an inward decreasing of mass accretion rate with\ndecreasing radius. Consequently, we have a flatter density profile ($\\rho\n\\propto r^{-p}$ with $p\\propto 1.5-s$ in the case of $\\dot{M}\\propto r^{s}$, $0\n\\leq s<1$) compared to the case of a constant accretion rate (($\\rho \\propto\nr^{-\\frac{3}{2}}$). In order to describe this behavior two models have been\nproposed: inflow-outflow solution and convection-dominated accretion flows. We\nhave studied the properties of a hot accretion flow in the presence of\nconvection, large scale magnetic field and outflow. We consider an axisymmetric\nviscous flow in the steady state. We used the self-similar solutions to solve\nthe 1.5 dimensional inflow-outflow equations. We have assumed that the\nconvection as a free parameter in our model for simplicity. We have considered\ntwo components of magnetic field (toroidal and vertical) in this paper. We have\nshown that the strong convection makes the inflow accretes and rotates slower\nwhile it becomes hotter and thicker. We have found that the thickness of the\ndisc deviates from non-convective solutions obviously. We have represented that\ntwo components of magnetic field have the opposite effects on the thickness of\nthe disc and similar effects on the radial and angular velocities of the flow.\n", "  We present resonant x-ray emission spectroscopic (RXES) data from the uranium\nintermetallics UPd$_3$, USb, USn$_3$ and URu$_2$Si$_2$, at the U $M_{4,5}$\nedges and compare the data to those from the well-localized $5f^2$\nsemiconductor UO$_2$. The technique is especially sensitive to any oxidation of\nthe surface, and this was found on the USb sample, thus preventing a good\ncomparison with a material known to be $5f^3$. We have found a small energy\nshift between UO$_2$ and UPd$_3$, both known to have localized $5f^2$\nconfigurations, which we ascribe to the effect of conduction electrons in\nUPd$_3$. The spectra from UPd$_3$ and URu$_2$Si$_2$,are similar, strongly\nsuggesting a predominant $5f^2$ configuration for URu$_2$Si$_2$. The\nvalence-band resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) provides information on\nthe U $P_3$ transitions (at about $18$~eV) between the U $5f$ and U $6p$\nstates, as well as transitions of between $3$ and $7$~eV from the valence band\ninto the unoccupied $5f$ states. These transitions are primarily involving\nmixed ligand states (O $2p$ or Pd, Ru $4d$) and U $5f$ states. Calculations are\nable to reproduce both these low-energy transitions reasonably well.\n", "  Water is the most important liquid in the Universe. At the same time it is\nthe most anomalous liquid. It demonstrates several dozens of anomalies, among\nwhich are density anomaly, diffusion anomaly etc. Anomalous behavior of water\nis a topic numerous publications. However, most of the publications investigate\nthe anomalous behavior of water in the vicinity of critical points: the\nliquid-gas critical point and the second hypothetical critical point in\nsupercooled region. Here we analyze experimental data on such properties of\nwater as heat capacity, speed of sound, dynamic viscosity and thermal\nconductivity. We show that these properties demonstrate anomalous maxima and\nminima in a region which is far from both critical points. Therefore, we find a\nnovel region of anomalous properties of water (anomalous triangle) which cannot\nbe related to critical fluctuations. We also perform a molecular dynamics\nsimulations of this region with two common water models - SPC/E and TIP4P - and\nshow that these models fail to describe the novel anomalous region.\n", "  The main objective of this paper is to present a generic modelling framework,\nfor the diffusive mass transport through the turbulent, reactive boundary layer\nof multi-component fluid mixtures that precipitate on the wall. The modelling\nis based on Maxwell-Stefan diffusion in multi-component mixtures, the\nrelaxation to chemical equilibrium model, and the single-phase Navier-Stokes\nequations. Final-ly, turbulence is introduced by Reynolds-averaging. The\ngoverning equations are simplified in accordance with common assumptions of\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD), and based on the assumption that the\nover-all bulk flow is parallel to the wall, 1-dimensional equations for the\nspecies and heat transport perpendicular to the wall have been formulated. The\nequations are solved on a fine grid in order to fully resolve the boundary\nlayer, and the effect of allowing/disallowing deposition and chemical reactions\nwas investigated for a simplified test-case (4-component ideal mixture of\nperfect gasses capable of chemical reaction and sublimation fouling).\n  The developed framework can be employed as a sub-grid model for direct\nprecipitation/crystallization/solidifica-tion fouling in coarse grid CFD\nmodels.\n", "  We identify the scaling limit of the backbone of the high-dimensional\nincipient infinite cluster (IIC), both in the finite-range and the long-range\nsetting. In the finite-range setting, this scaling limit is Brownian motion, in\nthe long-range setting, it is a stable motion. The proof relies on a novel lace\nexpansion that keeps track of the number of pivotal bonds.\n", "  One of the most fundamental problems in optomechanical cooling is how small\nthe thermal phonon number of a mechanical oscillator can be achieved under the\nradiation pressure of a proper cavity field. Different from previous\ntheoretical predictions, which were based on an optomechanical system's\ntime-independent steady states, we treat such cooling as a dynamical process of\ndriving the mechanical oscillator from its initial thermal state, due to its\nthermal equilibrium with the environment, to a stabilized quantum state of\nhigher purity. We find that the stabilized thermal phonon number left in the\nend actually depends on how fast the cooling process could be. The cooling\nspeed is decided by an effective optomechanical coupling intensity, which\nconstitutes an essential parameter for cooling, in addition to the sideband\nresolution parameter that has been considered in other theoretical studies. The\nlimiting thermal phonon number that any cooling process cannot surpass exhibits\na discontinuous jump across a certain value of the parameter.\n", "  We propose a renormalization process of a two phase WKB solution, which is\nbased on an appropriate surgery of local uniform asymptotic approximations of\nthe Wigner transform of the WKB solution. We explain in details how this\nprocess provides the correct spatial variation and frequency scales of the wave\nfield on the caustics where WKB method fails. The analysis has been thoroughly\npresented in the case of a fundamental problem, that is the semiclassical Airy\nequation, which arises from the model problem of acoustic propagation in a\nlayer with linear variation of the sound speed.\n", "  The thermal history of the Universe is included in the Debye Gravitational\nTheory (DGT) to describe the speed of rotation of the galaxies. The DGT\nincorporate the temperature of Debye in the entropic gravitational theory.\nAccording to the DGT, the expression of the rotation of the galaxies is not a\ncontinuous function of the redshift, there is a discontinuity at $\\sim 0.77$.\nAccording to their redshift, the galaxies form two groups. (a) Those with\nredshift above 0.77 with declining rotation curves like $R^{\\beta}$ with $\\beta\n\\leq -0.5$ (Newtonian regime). (b) Those with redshift below 0.77 with rising\nrotation curves like $R^{\\beta}$ with $\\beta \\geq 0$ (Mondian regime). At\n$z\\sim 0.77 $ an extra boost (Dirac delta-like twisting force) led the galaxies\nto spin very fast.This scenario is consistent with a mysterious entity such as\nthe dark energy and that at $z\\sim 0.77 $, in addition to accelerating the\nexpansion, boosted the rotation of the galaxies again, inducing a transition\nbetween the Newtonian regime to the Mondian regime. It is possible to check\nthat the characteristics on galaxy rotations provided by the DGT for a broad\nrange of redshift from $z\\sim 4$ to $z=0$ are in agreement with the\nobservations. We believe that the change in the form of rotation of galaxies at\n$z\\sim 0.77$ is new evidence for the hypothesis of dark energy.\n", "  The two-band $s^{\\pm}$-wave state is currently considered to be the most\npromising candidate for newly discovered iron-based high-$T_c$ superconductors.\nIn this work we study theoretically the ultrasound attenuation in\n$s^{\\pm}$-wave two-band superconductors. The impurity effect is calculated\nwithin the $\\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation. In particular, our theory\npredict that, when the sizes of two order parameter are comparable, a\nHebel-Slichter peak may show up in the ultrasound attenuation versus\ntemperature curves. Our calculations also confirmed the presence of the\nresonant impurity scattering at low temperature, observed previously by other\nauthors in the calculation of the NMR relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$.\n", "  Autoignition experiments of stoichiometric mixtures of s-, t-, and i-butanol\nin air have been performed using a heated rapid compression machine (RCM). At\ncompressed pressures of 15 and 30 bar and for compressed temperatures in the\nrange of 715-910 K, no evidence of a negative temperature coefficient region in\nterms of ignition delay response is found. The present experimental results are\nalso compared with previously reported RCM data of n-butanol in air. The order\nof reactivity of the butanols is\nn-butanol>s-butanol$\\approx$i-butanol>t-butanol at the lower pressure, but\nchanges to n-butanol>t-butanol>s-butanol>i-butanol at higher pressure. In\naddition, t-butanol shows pre-ignition heat release behavior, which is\nespecially evident at higher pressures. To help identify the controlling\nchemistry leading to this pre-ignition heat release, off-stoichiometric\nexperiments are further performed at 30 bar compressed pressure, for t-butanol\nat $\\phi$ = 0.5 and $\\phi$ = 2.0 in air. For these experiments, higher fuel\nloading (i.e. $\\phi$ = 2.0) causes greater pre-ignition heat release (as\nindicated by greater pressure rise) than the stoichiometric or $\\phi$ = 0.5\ncases. Comparison of the experimental ignition delays with the simulated\nresults using two literature kinetic mechanisms shows generally good agreement,\nand one mechanism is further used to explore and compare the fuel decomposition\npathways of the butanol isomers. Using this mechanism, the importance of peroxy\nchemistry in the autoignition of the butanol isomers is highlighted and\ndiscussed.\n", "  Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation in decoherence-free subspaces has\nattracted increasing attention recently, as it allows for high-speed\nimplementation and combines both the robustness of holonomic gates and the\ncoherence stabilization of decoherence-free subspaces. Since the first protocol\nof nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation in decoherence-free subspaces, a\nnumber of schemes for its physical implementation have been put forward.\nHowever, all previous schemes require two noncommuting gates to realize an\narbitrary one-qubit gate, which doubles the exposure time of gates to error\nsources as well as the resource expenditure. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative protocol for nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation in\ndecoherence-free subspaces, in which an arbitrary one-qubit gate in\ndecoherence-free subspaces is realized by a single-shot implementation. The\npresent protocol not only maintains the merits of the original protocol, but\nalso avoids the extra work of combining two gates to implement an arbitrary\none-qubit gate and thereby reduces the exposure time to various error sources.\n", "  Recent work on developing novel integral equation formulations has involved\nusing potentials as opposed to fields. This is a consequence of the additional\nflexibility offered by using potentials to develop well conditioned systems.\nMost of the work in this arena has wrestled with developing this formulation\nfor perfectly conducting objects (Vico et al., 2014 and Liu et al., 2015), with\nrecent effort made to addressing similar problems for dielectrics (Li et al.,\n2017). In this paper, we present well-conditioned decoupled potential integral\nequation (DPIE) formulated for electromagnetic scattering from homogeneous\ndielectric objects, a fully developed version of that presented in the\nconference communication (Li et al., 2017). The formulation is based on\nboundary conditions derived for decoupled boundary conditions on the scalar and\nvector potentials. The resulting DPIE is the second kind integral equation, and\ndoes not suffer from either low frequency or dense mesh breakdown. Analytical\nproperties of the DPIE are studied. Results on the sphere analysis are provided\nto demonstrate the conditioning and spectrum of the resulting linear system.\n", "  We show that the considered in previous paper \\cite{BurGrBag} lepton bag\nmodel, generating the external gravitational and electromagnetic fields of the\nKerr-Newman (KN) solution is supersymmetric and represents a BPS-saturated\nsoliton, interpolating between internal vacuum state and external KN solution.\nWe obtain Bogomolnyi equations for this phase transition, and show that\nBogomolnyi bound determines all important features of this bag model, including\nits stable shape.\n  In particular, for stationary KN solution the BPS-bound provides stability of\nthe ellipsoidal form of the bag and formation of the ring-string structure at\nits border, while for the periodic electromagnetic excitations of the KN\nsolution, the BPS-bound controls deformation of the surface of the bag,\nreproducing the known flexibility of bag models.\n", "  The idea that black hole spin is instrumental in the generation of powerful\njets in active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries is arguably the most\ncontentious claim in black hole astrophysics. Because jets are thought to\noriginate in the context of electromagnetism, and the modeling of Maxwell\nfields in curved spacetime around black holes is challenging, various\napproximations are made in numerical simulations that fall under the guise of\n'ideal magnetohydrodynamics'. But the simplifications of this framework may\nstruggle to capture relevant details of real astrophysical environments near\nblack holes. In this work, we highlight tension between analytic and numerical\nresults, specifically between the analytically derived conserved Noether\ncurrents for rotating black hole spacetimes and the results of general\nrelativistic numerical simulations (GRMHD). While we cannot definitively\nattribute the issue to any specific approximation used in the numerical\nschemes, there seem to be natural candidates, which we explore. GRMHD\nnotwithstanding, if electromagnetic fields around rotating black holes are\nbrought to the hole by accretion, we show from first principles that prograde\naccreting disks likely experience weaker large-scale black hole-threading\nfields, implying weaker jets than in retrograde configurations.\n", "  First-principles calculations have been carried out to study the InVO4\ncompound under pressure. In this work, total energy calculations were performed\nin order to analyze the structural behavior of the experimentally known\npolymorphs of InVO4: a-MnMoO4-type (I), CrVO4-type (III), and wolframite (V).\nIn addition, in this paper we present our results about the stability of this\ncompound beyond the pressures reached by experiments. We propose some new\nhigh-pressure phases on the basis of the study of 13 possible candidates. The\nquasi-harmonic approximation has been used to calculate the sequence of phase\ntransitions at 300 K: CrVO4-type, III (the transition pressure is given in\nparentheses) -> wolframite, V (4.4 GPa) -> raspite, VI (28.1 GPa) ->\nAgMnO4-type, VII (44 GPa). Equations of state and phonon frequencies as a\nfunction of pressure have been calculated for the studied phases. In order to\ndetermine the stability of each phase, we also report the phonon dispersion\nalong the Brillouin zone and the phonon density of states for the most stable\npolymorphs. Finally, the electronic band structure for the low- and\nhigh-pressure phases for the studied polymorphs is presented as well as the\npressure evolution of the band gap by using the HSE06 hybrid functional.\n", "  New experimental data are collected for methyl-cyclohexane (MCH) autoignition\nin a heated rapid compression machine (RCM). Three mixtures of MCH/O2/N2/Ar at\nequivalence ratios of $\\phi$=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 are studied and the ignition\ndelays are measured at compressed pressure of 50 bar and for compressed\ntemperatures in the range of 690-900 K. By keeping the fuel mole fraction in\nthe mixture constant, the order of reactivity, in terms of inverse ignition\ndelay, is measured to be $\\phi$=0.5 > $\\phi$=1.0 > $\\phi$=1.5, demonstrating\nthe dependence of the ignition delay on oxygen concentration. In addition, an\nexisting model for the combustion of MCH is updated with new reaction rates and\npathways, including substantial updates to the low-temperature chemistry. The\nnew model shows good agreement with the overall ignition delays measured in\nthis study, as well as the ignition delays measured previously in the\nliterature using RCMs and shock tubes. This model therefore represents a strong\nimprovement compared to the previous version, which uniformly over-predicted\nthe ignition delays. Chemical kinetic analyses of the updated mechanism are\nalso conducted to help understand the fuel decomposition pathways and the\nreactions controlling the ignition. Combined, these results and analyses\nsuggest that further investigation of several of the low-temperature fuel\ndecomposition pathways is required.\n", "  Autoignition delay experiments were performed for n-butanol in a heated rapid\ncompression machine. Experiments were performed at pressures of 15 and 30 bar,\nin the temperature range 650-900 K, and for equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and\n2.0. Additionally, the initial fuel mole fraction and initial oxygen mole\nfraction were varied independently to determine the influence of each on\nignition delay. Over the conditions studied, it was found that the reactivity\nof the mixture increased as equivalence ratio, initial fuel mole fraction or\ninitial oxygen mole fraction increased. A non-linear correlation to the\nexperimental data was performed and showed nearly second order dependence on\nthe initial oxygen mole fraction and nearly first order dependence on initial\nfuel mole fraction and compressed pressure. This was the first study of the\nignition of n-butanol in this temperature and pressure range, and contributes\nto a better understanding of the chemistry of this fuel under the conditions\nrelevant to practical devices. Experimentally measured ignition delays were\ncompared against the ignition delay computed from several reaction mechanisms\nin the literature. The agreement between experiments and simulations was found\nto be unsatisfactory. Sensitivity analysis was performed and indicated that the\nuncertainties of the rate constants of parent fuel decomposition reactions play\na major role in causing the poor agreement. Further path analysis of the fuel\ndecomposition reactions supported this conclusion and highlighted the\nparticular importance of certain pathways. Based on these results, it was\nconcluded that further investigation of the fuel decomposition, including\nspeciation measurements, will be required.\n", "  Cooperation is ubiquitous in every level of living organisms. It is known\nthat spatial (network) structure is a viable mechanism for cooperation to\nevolve. Until recently, it has been difficult to predict whether cooperation\ncan evolve at a network (population) level. To address this problem, Pinheiro\net al. proposed a numerical metric, called Average Gradient of Selection (AGoS)\nin 2012. AGoS can characterize and forecast the evolutionary fate of\ncooperation at a population level. However, stochastic mutation of strategies\nwas not considered in the analysis of AGoS. Here we analyzed the evolution of\ncooperation using AGoS where mutation may occur to strategies of individuals in\nnetworks. Our analyses revealed that mutation always has a negative effect on\nthe evolution of cooperation regardless of the fraction of cooperators and\nnetwork structures. Moreover, we found that mutation affects the fitness of\ncooperation differently on different social network structures.\n", "  A recent zero-field (ZF) and longitudinal-field (LF) muon spin relaxation\n($\\mu$SR) study of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ [Jian~Zhang {\\it et al.},\narXiv:1709.06799] claims to have detected critical slowing down of magnetic\nfluctuations near the pseudogap temperature $T^*$, and attribute this to the\nonset of slow fluctuating domains of intra-unit-cell magnetic order. Here it is\nargued that the relaxation data displayed in this study are misleading due to\nan improper account of the nuclear dipole contribution and a failure to\nacknowledge the occurrence of muon diffusion.\n", "  The Giornata Sesta about the Force of Percussion is a relatively less known\nChapter from the Galileo's masterpiece \"Discourse about Two New Sciences\". It\nwas first published lately (1718), long after the first edition of the Two New\nSciences (1638) and Galileo's death (1642). The Giornata Sesta focuses on how\nto quantify the percussion force caused by a body in movement, and describes a\nvery interesting experiment known as \"the two-bucket experiment\". In this\npaper, we review this experiment reported by Galileo, develop a steady-state\ntheoretical model, and solve its transient form numerically; additionally, we\nreport the results from one real simplified analogous experiment. Finally, we\ndiscuss the conclusions drawn by Galileo -- correct, despite a probably\nunnoticeable imbalance --, showing that he did not report the thrust force\ncomponent in his setup -- which would be fundamental for the correct\ncalculation of the percussion force.\n", "  Electric field-induced magnetization switching in multiferroics is intriguing\nfor both fundamental studies and potential technological applications. Here, we\nreview the recent developments on electric field-induced magnetization\nswitching in multiferroic heterostructures. Particularly, we study the dynamics\nof magnetization switching between the two stable states in a shape-anisotropic\nsingle-domain nanomagnet using stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)\nequation in the presence of thermal fluctuations. For magnetostrictive\nnanomagnets in strain-coupled multiferroic composites, such study of\nmagnetization dynamics, contrary to steady-state scenario, revealed intriguing\nnew phenomena on binary switching mechanism. While the traditional method of\nbinary switching requires to tilt the potential profile to the desired state of\nswitching, we show that no such tilting is necessary to switch successfully\nsince the magnetization's excursion out of magnet's plane can generate a\nbuilt-in asymmetry during switching. We also study the switching dynamics in\nmultiferroic heterostructures having magnetoelectric coupling at the interface\nand magnetic exchange coupling that can facilitate to maintain the direction of\nswitching with the polarity of the applied electric field. We calculate the\nperformance metrics like switching delay and energy dissipation during\nswitching while simulating LLG dynamics. The performance metrics turn out to be\nvery encouraging for potential technological applications.\n", "  Thiol-ene photo-click hydrogels were prepared via step-growth polymerisation\nusing thiol-functionalised type-I collagen and 8-arm poly(ethylene glycol)\nnorbornene terminated (PEG-NB), as a potential injectable regenerative device.\nType-I collagen was thiol-functionalised by a ring opening reaction with\n2-iminothiolane (2IT), whereby up to 80 Abs% functionalisation and 90 RPN%\ntriple helical preservation were recorded via 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic\nacid (TNBS) colorimetric assay and circular dichroism (CD). Type, i.e.\n2-Hydroxy-1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-2-methyl-1-propanone (I2959) or lithium\nphenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP), and concentration of\nphotoinitiator were varied to ensure minimal photoinitiator-induced\ncytotoxicity and to enable thiol-ene network formation of collagen-PEG\nmixtures. The viability of G292 cells following 24 h culture in\nphotoinitiator-supplemented media was largely affected by the photoinitiator\nconcentration, with I2959-supplemented media observed to induce higher toxic\nresponse compared to LAP-supplemented media. In line with the in vitro study,\nselected photoinitiator concentrations were used to prepare thiol-ene\nphoto-click hydrogels. Gelation kinetics proved to be largely affected by the\nspecific photoinitiator, with LAP-containing thiol-ene mixtures leading to\nsignificantly reduced complete gelation time with respect to I2959-containing\nmixtures. Other than the specific photoinitiator, the photoinitiator\nconcentration was key to adjust hydrogel storage modulus (G'), whereby 15-fold\nG' increase was observed in samples prepared with 0.5% (w/v) compared to 0.1%\n(w/v) LAP. The photoinitiator-gelation-cytotoxicity relationships established\nin this study will be instrumental to the design of orthogonal collagen-based\nniches for regenerative medicine.\n", "  We describe here the latest results of calculations with FlexPDE code of\nwake-fields induced by the bunch in micro-structures. These structures,\nilluminated by swept laser bust, serve for acceleration of charged particles.\nThe basis of the scheme is a fast sweeping device for the laser bunch. After\nsweeping, the laser bunch has a slope ~45o with respect to the direction of\npropagation. So the every cell of the microstructure becomes excited locally\nonly for the moment when the particles are there. Self-consistent parameters of\ncollider based on this idea allow consideration this type of collider as a\ncandidate for the near-future accelerator era.\n"]}
