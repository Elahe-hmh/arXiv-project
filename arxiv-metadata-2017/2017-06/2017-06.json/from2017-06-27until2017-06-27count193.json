This action is considered as the action for tachyon and embedding\ncoupled to the brane gravity. We derive the slow roll parameters from this\nmodel.\n", "  We construct a set of post-Newtonian reference frames for a comprehensive\nstudy of the orbital dynamics and rotational motion of the Moon and Earth by\nmeans of lunar laser ranging (LLR) with the precision of one millimeter. We\nalso derive the post-Newtonian coordinate transformations between the frames\nand analyze the residual gauge freedom, which is used for removing spurious\npost-Newtonian effects from the equations of motion of the solar system bodies.\n", "  The evolution of a probe D-brane in the p-brane background has been\nconsidered. The anisotropic evolution of the world-volume of the D-brane with a\ngiven topology of a world-volume in a form of a direct product of a\nn-dimensional flat space and (3-n)-dimensional sphere has been obtained. In\nthis case the anisotropy is described with the aid of two parameters (Hubble\nparameters). The special case of this evolution, namely the isotropic evolution\ncorresponds to equality of these two parameters. In the latter case the masses\nand charges of the background p-branes have been derived.\n", "  The large scale pattern in the arrival directions of extragalactic cosmic\nrays that reach the Earth is different from that of the flux arriving to the\nhalo of the Galaxy as a result of the propagation through the galactic magnetic\nfield. Two different effects are relevant in this process: deflections of\ntrajectories and (de)acceleration by the electric field component due to the\ngalactic rotation. The deflection of the cosmic ray trajectories makes the flux\nintensity arriving to the halo from some direction to appear reaching the Earth\nfrom another direction. This applies to any intrinsic anisotropy in the\nextragalactic distribution or, even in the absence of intrinsic anisotropies,\nto the dipolar Compton-Getting anisotropy induced when the observer is moving\nwith respect to the cosmic rays rest frame. For an observer moving with the\nsolar system, cosmic rays traveling through far away regions of the Galaxy also\nexperience an electric force coming from the relative motion (due to the\nrotation of the Galaxy) of the local system in which the field can be\nconsidered as being purely magnetic. This produces small changes in the\nparticles momentum that can originate large scale anisotropies even for an\nisotropic extragalactic flux.\n", "  In this paper we present a fast and accurate numerical algorithm for the\ncomputation of hyperspherical Bessel functions of large order and real\narguments. For the hyperspherical Bessel functions of closed type, no stable\nalgorithm existed so far due to the lack of a backwards recurrence. We solved\nthis problem by establishing a relation to Gegenbauer polynomials. All our\nalgorithms are written in C and are publicly available at Github\n[https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public]. A Python wrapper is available upon\nrequest.\n", "  Circularly-polarized extreme UV and X-ray radiation provides valuable access\nto the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of materials. To date,\nthis capability was available only at large-scale X-ray facilities such as\nsynchrotrons. Here we demonstrate the first bright, phase-matched, extreme UV\ncircularly-polarized high harmonics and use this new light source for magnetic\ncircular dichroism measurements at the M-shell absorption edges of Co. We show\nthat phase matching of circularly-polarized harmonics is unique and robust,\nproducing a photon flux comparable to the linearly polarized high harmonic\nsources that have been used very successfully for ultrafast element-selective\nmagneto-optic experiments. This work thus represents a critical advance that\nmakes possible element-specific imaging and spectroscopy of multiple elements\nsimultaneously in magnetic and other chiral media with very high spatial and\ntemporal resolution, using tabletop-scale setups.\n", "  We explicitly show that the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson color-kinematic duality\nholds at tree level through at least eight points in\nAharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory with gauge group SU(N) x SU(N). At\nsix points we give the explicit form of numerators in terms of amplitudes,\ndisplaying the generalized gauge freedom that leads to amplitude relations.\nHowever, at eight points no amplitude relations follow from the duality, so the\ndiagram numerators are fixed unique functions of partial amplitudes. We provide\nthe explicit amplitude-numerator decomposition and the numerator relations for\neight-point amplitudes.\n", "  The hydrogen Ly-{\\alpha} line has a dominant influence in photo-ionization\nprocesses in the unperturbed terrestrial ionospheric D region. In this paper,\nwe present a procedure of calculating the rate of photo-ionization induced by\nLy-{\\alpha} photons based on relaxation of electron density after intensive\nperturbations like those caused by solar X flares. This theory is applied to\nthe ends of relaxation periods following three cases of solar X flares from May\n5, 2010, February 18, 2011 and March 24, 2011. The necessary data on low\nionospheric plasma parameters were collected by the very low frequency (VLF)\nradio-wave technics. The electron concentration is calculated from the\namplitude and phase of the VLF signal emitted by the DHO transmitter in Germany\nand recorded by a receiver located in Serbia.\n", "  Understanding over-limiting current (faster than diffusion) is a\nlong-standing challenge in electrochemistry with applications in desalination\nand energy storage. Known mechanisms involve either chemical or hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in unconfined electrolytes. Here, it is shown that over-limiting\ncurrent can be sustained by surface conduction in nano pores, without any such\ninstabilities, and used to control dendritic growth during electrodeposition.\nCopper electrode posits are grown in anodized aluminum oxide membranes with\npolyelectrolyte coatings to modify the surface charge. At low currents, uniform\nelectroplating occurs, unaffected by surface modification due to thin electric\ndouble layers, but the morphology changes dramatically above the limiting\ncurrent. With negative surface charge, growth is enhanced along the nanopore\nsurfaces, forming surface dendrites and nanotubes behind a deionization shock.\nWith positive surface charge, dendrites avoid the surfaces and are either\nguided along the nanopore centers or blocked from penetrating the membrane.\n", "  The existence of a static lengthscale that grows in accordance with the\ndramatic slowing down observed at the glass transition is a subject of intense\ninterest. A recent publication compared two proposals for this length scale,\none based on the point-to-set correlation technique and the other on the scale\nwhere the lowest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix becomes sensitive to\ndisorder. The conclusion was that both approaches lead to the same lengthscale,\nbut the former is easier to measure at higher temperatures and the latter at\nlower temperatures. But even after using both methods together, the range of\nincrease in the observed lengthscales was limited by the relaxation times\nreachable by standard molecular dynamics techniques (i.e. about 4-5 orders of\nmagnitude). In this paper we therefore attempt to explore the typical scale at\neven lower temperatures, testing for this purpose two approaches, one based on\nthe idea of vapor deposition and the other on a swap Monte Carlo technique. We\nconclude that the first approach does not help in getting to lower\ntemperatures, but the second one does so quite effectively. We can reach a\ntypical lengthscale that grows in accordance with at least $15$ orders of\nmagnitude increase in the relaxation time, competing with the best experimental\nconditions. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the observed\nlengthscale and various models of the relaxation time.\n", "  QCD axions are a well-motivated candidate for cold dark matter. Cold axions\nare produced in the early universe by vacuum realignment, axion string decay\nand axion domain wall decay. We show that cold axions thermalize via their\ngravitational self-interactions, and form a Bose-Einstein condensate. As a\nresult, axion dark matter behaves differently from the other proposed forms of\ndark matter. The differences are observable.\n", "  Many biological systems are appropriately viewed as passive inclusions\nimmersed in an active bath: from proteins on active membranes to microscopic\nswimmers confined by boundaries. The non-equilibrium forces exerted by the\nactive bath on the inclusions or boundaries often regulate function, and such\nforces may also be exploited in artificial active materials. Nonetheless, the\ngeneral phenomenology of these active forces remains elusive. We show that the\nfluctuation spectrum of the active medium, the partitioning of energy as a\nfunction of wavenumber, controls the phenomenology of force generation. We find\nthat for a narrow, unimodal spectrum, the force exerted by a non-equilibrium\nsystem on two embedded walls depends on the width and the position of the peak\nin the fluctuation spectrum, and oscillates between repulsion and attraction as\na function of wall separation. We examine two apparently disparate examples:\nthe Maritime Casimir effect and recent simulations of active Brownian\nparticles. A key implication of our work is that important non-equilibrium\ninteractions are encoded within the fluctuation spectrum. In this sense the\nnoise becomes the signal.\n", "  We present physics results from simulations of QCD using $N_f = 2$ dynamical\nWilson twisted mass fermions at the physical value of the pion mass. These\nsimulations were enabled by the addition of the clover term to the twisted mass\nquark action. We show evidence that compared to previous simulations without\nthis term, the pion mass splitting due to isospin breaking is almost completely\neliminated. Using this new action, we compute the masses and decay constants of\npseudoscalar mesons involving the dynamical up and down as well as valence\nstrange and charm quarks at one value of the lattice spacing, $a \\approx 0.09$\nfm. Further, we determine renormalized quark masses as well as their\nscale-independent ratios, in excellent agreement with other lattice\ndeterminations in the continuum limit. In the baryon sector, we show that the\nnucleon mass is compatible with its physical value and that the masses of the\n$\\Delta$ baryons do not show any sign of isospin breaking. Finally, we compute\nthe electron, muon and tau lepton anomalous magnetic moments and show the\nresults to be consistent with extrapolations of older ETMC data to the\ncontinuum and physical pion mass limits. We mostly find remarkably good\nagreement with phenomenology, even though we cannot take the continuum and\nthermodynamic limits.\n", "  The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated\nsystem is almost always increasing. We propose combinatorial formalizations of\nthe second law and explore their conditions of possibilities.\n", "  While the linear behavior of gravity in braneworld models is well understood,\nmuch less is known about full non-linear gravitational effects. Even when they\nagree at the linear level, these could be expected to distinguish braneworlds\nfrom a lower-dimensional theory with no brane. Black holes are a good testing\nground for such studies, as they are nonlinear solutions that would be expected\nto reflect the background geometry. In particular, we assess the role of black\nhole quasinormal modes in gravitational experiments devised to be sensitive to\nthe existence of the brane, in a lower-dimensional setting where we have\nanalytical control. We compute quasinormal modes of brane-localized black holes\nand find that they follow the entropy of the corresponding black hole. This\nobservation allows us to conclude that, surprisingly, the scattering problem we\nconsider, at least in some regimes, does not distinguish between non-linear\ngravitational effects of black holes in AdS space with a brane and black holes\nin a spacetime of one lower dimension.\n", "  When a new product or technology is introduced, potential consumers can learn\nits quality by trying the product, at a risk, or by letting others try it and\nfree-riding on the information that they generate. We propose a dynamic game to\nstudy the adoption of technologies of uncertain value, when agents are\nconnected by a network and a monopolist seller chooses a policy to maximize\nprofits. Consumers with low degree (few friends) have incentives to adopt\nearly, while consumers with high degree have incentives to free ride. The\nseller can induce high-degree consumers to adopt early by offering referral\nincentives - rewards to early adopters whose friends buy in the second period.\nReferral incentives thus lead to a `double-threshold strategy' by which low and\nhigh-degree agents adopt the product early while middle-degree agents wait. We\nshow that referral incentives are optimal on certain networks while\ninter-temporal price discrimination (i.e., a first-period price discount) is\noptimal on others, and discuss welfare implications.\n", "  In the present work, we have interpreted recently available experimental data\nfor high-spin states of the near-spherical nuclei $^{91,92}$Zr, using the\nshell-model calculations within the full $f_{5/2}$, $p_{3/2}$, $p_{1/2}$,\n$g_{9/2}$ model space for protons and valence neutrons in $g_{9/2}$, $g_{7/2}$,\n$d_{5/2}$ orbits. We have employed a truncation for the neutrons due to huge\nmatrix dimensions, by allowing one neutron excitation from $g_{9/2}$ orbital to\n$d_{5/2}$ and $g_{7/2}$ orbitals. Results are in good agreement with the\navailable experimental data. Thus, theoretically, we have identified the\nstructure of many high-spin states, which were tentatively assigned in the\nrecent experimental work. The $^{91}$Zr $21/2^+$ isomer lies at low-energy\nregion due to fully aligned spins of two $g_{9/2}$ protons and one $d_{5/2}$\nneutron.\n", "  We develop and generalize the theory of extreme value for non-stationary\nstochastic processes, mostly by weakening the uniform mixing condition that was\npreviously used in this setting. We apply our results to non-autonomous\ndynamical systems, in particular to {\\em sequential dynamical systems}, given\nby uniformly expanding maps, and to a few classes of random dynamical systems.\nSome examples are presented and worked out in detail.\n", "  We show that the problem of deciding membership in the moment polytope\nassociated with a finite-dimensional unitary representation of a compact,\nconnected Lie group is in NP and coNP. This is the first non-trivial result on\nthe computational complexity of this problem, which naively amounts to a\nquadratically-constrained program. Our result applies in particular to the\nKronecker polytopes, and therefore to the problem of deciding positivity of the\nstretched Kronecker coefficients. In contrast, it has recently been shown that\ndeciding positivity of a single Kronecker coefficient is NP-hard in general\n[Ikenmeyer, Mulmuley and Walter, arXiv:1507.02955]. We discuss the consequences\nof our work in the context of complexity theory and the quantum marginal\nproblem.\n", "  We study the decay of high-Reynolds number Taylor-Couette turbulence, i.e.\nthe turbulent flow between two coaxial rotating cylinders. To do so, the\nrotation of the inner cylinder (Re$_i=2 \\times 10^6$, the outer cylinder is at\nrest) is stopped within 12 s, thus fully removing the energy input to the\nsystem. Using a combination of laser Doppler anemometry and particle image\nvelocimetry measurements, six decay decades of the kinetic energy could be\ncaptured. First, in the absence of cylinder rotation, the flow-velocity during\nthe decay does not develop any height dependence in contrast to the well-known\nTaylor vortex state. Second, the radial profile of the azimuthal velocity is\nfound to be self-similar. Nonetheless, the decay of this wall-bounded\ninhomogeneous turbulent flow does not follow a strict power law as for decaying\nturbulent homogeneous isotropic flows, but it is faster, due to the strong\nviscous drag applied by the bounding walls. We theoretically describe the decay\nin a quantitative way by taking the effects of additional friction at the walls\ninto account.\n", "  We describe a scheme of quantum computation with magic states on qubits for\nwhich contextuality is a necessary resource possessed by the magic states. More\ngenerally, we establish contextuality as a necessary resource for all schemes\nof quantum computation with magic states on qubits that satisfy three simple\npostulates. Furthermore, we identify stringent consistency conditions on such\ncomputational schemes, revealing the general structure by which negativity of\nWigner functions, hardness of classical simulation of the computation, and\ncontextuality are connected.\n", "  Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides entwine interaction,\nspin-orbit coupling, and topology. Hole-doped systems lack spin degeneracy:\nstates are indexed with spin and valley specificity. This unique structure\noffers new possibilities for correlated phases and phenomena. We realize an\nunconventional superconducting pairing phase which is an equal mixture of a\nspin singlet and the $m = 0$ spin triplet. It is stable against large in-plane\nmagnetic fields, and its topology allows quasiparticle excitations of net\nnonzero Berry curvature via pair-breaking circularly polarized light.\n", "  Adaptive techniques have important potential for wide applications in\nenhancing precision of quantum parameter estimation. We present a recursively\nadaptive quantum state tomography (RAQST) protocol for finite dimensional\nquantum systems and experimentally implement the adaptive tomography protocol\non two-qubit systems. In this RAQST protocol, an adaptive measurement strategy\nand a recursive linear regression estimation algorithm are performed. Numerical\nresults show that our RAQST protocol can outperform the tomography protocols\nusing mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and the two-stage MUB adaptive strategy\neven with the simplest product measurements. When nonlocal measurements are\navailable, our RAQST can beat the Gill-Massar bound for a wide range of quantum\nstates with a modest number of copies. We use only the simplest product\nmeasurements to implement two-qubit tomography experiments. In the experiments,\nwe use error-compensation techniques to tackle systematic error due to\nmisalignments and imperfection of wave plates, and achieve about 100-fold\nreduction of the systematic error. The experimental results demonstrate that\nthe improvement of RAQST over nonadaptive tomography is significant for states\nwith a high level of purity. Our results also show that this recursively\nadaptive tomography method is particularly effective for the reconstruction of\nmaximally entangled states, which are important resources in quantum\ninformation.\n", "  The one-parameter scaling theory of localization predicts that all states in\na disordered two-dimensional system with broken time reversal symmetry are\nlocalized even in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. While at constant\nstrong magnetic fields this paradigm fails (recall quantum Hall effect), it is\nbelieved to hold at weak magnetic fields. Here we explore the nature of quantum\nstates at weak magnetic field and strongly fluctuating spin-orbit coupling,\nemploying highly accurate numerical procedure based on level spacing\ndistribution and transfer matrix technique combined with finite-size\none-parameter scaling hypothesis. Remarkably, the metallic phase, (known to\nexist at zero magnetic field), persists also at finite (albeit weak) magnetic\nfields, and eventually crosses over into a critical phase, which has already\nbeen confirmed at high magnetic fields. A schematic phase diagram drawn in the\nenergy-magnetic field plane elucidates the occurrence of localized, metallic\nand critical phases. In addition, it is shown that nearest-level statistics is\ndetermined solely by the symmetry parameter $\\beta$ and follows the Wigner\nsurmise irrespective of whether states are metallic or critical.\n", "  We prove perturbative renormalizability of projectable Horava gravity. The\nkey element of the argument is the choice of a gauge which ensures the correct\nanisotropic scaling of the propagators and their uniform falloff at large\nfrequencies and momenta. This guarantees that the counterterms required to\nabsorb the loop divergences are local and marginal or relevant with respect to\nthe anisotropic scaling. Gauge invariance of the counterterms is achieved by\nmaking use of the background-covariant formalism. We also comment on the\ndifficulties of this approach when addressing the renormalizability of the\nnon-projectable model.\n", "  In this paper we develop the foundations for microlocal analysis on\nsupermanifolds. Making use of pseudodifferential operators on supermanifolds as\nintroduced by Rempel and Schmitt, we define a suitable notion of super\nwavefront set for superdistributions which generalizes Dencker's polarization\nsets for vector-valued distributions to supergeometry. In particular, our super\nwavefront sets detect polarization information of the singularities of\nsuperdistributions. We prove a refined pullback theorem for superdistributions\nalong supermanifold morphisms, which as a special case establishes criteria\nwhen two superdistributions may be multiplied. As an application of our\nframework, we study the singularities of distributional solutions of a\nsupersymmetric field theory.\n", "  In the Entropic Dynamics (ED) derivation of the Schroedinger equation the\nphysical input is introduced through constraints that are implemented using\nLagrange multipliers. There is one constraint involving a \"drift\" potential\nthat correlates the motions of different particles and is ultimately\nresponsible for entanglement. The purpose of this work is to deepen our\nunderstanding of the corresponding multiplier. Its main effect is to control\nthe strength of the drift relative to the fluctuations. We show that ED\nexhibits a symmetry: models with different values of the multiplier can lead to\nthe same Schroedinger equation; different \"microscopic\" or sub-quantum models\nlead to the same \"macroscopic\" or quantum behavior. As the multiplier tends to\ninfinity the drift prevails over the fluctuations and the particles tend to\nmove along the smooth probability flow lines. Thus ED includes the causal or\nBohmian form of quantum mechanics as a special limiting case.\n", "  The square root law (SRL) is the fundamental limit of covert communication\nover classical memoryless channels (with a classical adversary) and quantum\nlossy-noisy bosonic channels (with a quantum-powerful adversary). The SRL\nstates that $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ covert bits, but no more, can be reliably\ntransmitted in $n$ channel uses with $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ bits of secret\npre-shared between the communicating parties. Here we investigate covert\ncommunication over general memoryless classical-quantum (cq) channels with\nfixed finite-size input alphabets, and show that the SRL governs covert\ncommunications in typical scenarios. %This demonstrates that the SRL is\nachievable over any quantum communications channel using a product-state\ntransmission strategy, where the transmitted symbols in every channel use are\ndrawn from a fixed finite-size alphabet. We characterize the optimal constants\nin front of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the reliably communicated covert bits, as well as\nfor the number of the pre-shared secret bits consumed. We assume a\nquantum-powerful adversary that can perform an arbitrary joint (entangling)\nmeasurement on all $n$ channel uses. However, we analyze the legitimate\nreceiver that is able to employ a joint measurement as well as one that is\nrestricted to performing a sequence of measurements on each of $n$ channel uses\n(product measurement). We also evaluate the scenarios where covert\ncommunication is not governed by the SRL.\n", "  We report the first measurement of the total MUON flux underground at the\nDavis Campus of the Sanford Underground Research Facility at the 4850 ft level.\nMeasurements were done with the Majorana Demonstrator veto system arranged in\ntwo different configurations. The measured total flux is (5.31+/-0.17) x 10^-9\nmuons/s/cm^2.\n", "  Localized unitary operators are basic probes of locality and causality in\nquantum systems: localized unitary operators create localized excitations in\nentangled states. Working with an explicit form, we explore the properties of\nthese operators in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. We show that,\nunlike unitary operators, local non-unitary operators generically create\nnon-local excitations. We present a local picture for quantum systems in which\nlocalized experimentalists can only act through localized Hamiltonian\ndeformations, and therefore localized unitary operators. We demonstrate that\nlocalized unitary operators model certain quantum quenches exactly. We show how\nthe Reeh-Schlieder theorem follows intuitively from basic properties of\nentanglement, non-unitary operators, and the local picture. We show that a\nrecent quasi-particle picture for excited-state entanglement entropy in\nconformal field theories is not universal for all local operators. We prove a\ncausality relation for entanglement entropy and connect our results to the\nAdS/CFT correspondence.\n", "  Human flourishing is often severely limited by persistent violence.\nQuantitative conflict research has found common temporal and other statistical\npatterns in warfare, but very little is understood about its general spatial\npatterns. While the importance of topology in geostrategy has long been\nrecognised, the role of spatial patterns of cities in determining a region's\nvulnerability to conflict has gone unexplored. Here, we show that global\npatterns in war and peace are closely related to the relative position of\ncities in a global interaction network. We find that regions with betweenness\ncentrality above a certain threshold are often engulfed in entrenched conflict,\nwhile a high degree correlates with peace. In fact, betweenness accounts for\nover 80% of the variance in number of attacks. This metric is also a good\npredictor of the distance to a conflict zone and can estimate the risk of\nconflict. We conjecture that a high betweenness identifies areas with fuzzy\ncultural boundaries, whereas high degree cities are in cores where peace is\nmore easily maintained. This is supported by a simple agent-based model in\nwhich cities influence their neighbours, which exhibits the same threshold\nbehaviour with betweenness as seen in conflict data. These findings not only\nshed new light on the causes of violence, but could be used to estimate the\nrisk associated with actions such as the merging of cities, construction of\ntransportation infrastructure, or interventions in trade or migration patterns.\n", "  When metallic (or plasmonic) nanospheres are nearly touching, strong\nconcentration of light can occur in the narrow gap regions. This phenomenon has\na potential application in nanophotonics, biosensing and spectroscopy. The\nunderstanding of the strong interaction between the plasmonic spheres turns out\nto be quite challenging. Indeed, an extremely high computational cost is\nrequired to compute the electromagnetic field. Also, the classical method of\nimage charges, which is effective for dielectric spheres system, is not valid\nfor plasmonic spheres because of their negative permittivities. Here we develop\nnew analytical and numerical methods for the plasmonic spheres system by\nclarifying the connection between transformation optics and the method of image\ncharges. We derive fully analytic solutions valid for two plasmonic spheres. We\nthen develop a hybrid numerical scheme for computing the field distribution\nproduced by an arbitrary number of spheres. Our method is highly efficient and\naccurate even in the nearly touching case and is valid for plasmonic spheres.\n", "  We construct noncommutative principal bundles deforming principal bundles\nwith a Drinfeld twist (2-cocycle). If the twist is associated with the\nstructure group then we have a deformation of the fibers. If the twist is\nassociated with the automorphism group of the principal bundle, then we obtain\nnoncommutative deformations of the base space as well. Combining the two twist\ndeformations we obtain noncommutative principal bundles with both\nnoncommutative fibers and base space. More in general, the natural isomorphisms\nproving the equivalence of a closed monoidal category of modules and its twist\nrelated one are used to obtain new Hopf-Galois extensions as twists of\nHopf-Galois extensions. A sheaf approach is also considered, and examples\npresented.\n", "  We present Walklets, a novel approach for learning multiscale representations\nof vertices in a network. In contrast to previous works, these representations\nexplicitly encode multiscale vertex relationships in a way that is analytically\nderivable.\n  Walklets generates these multiscale relationships by subsampling short random\nwalks on the vertices of a graph. By `skipping' over steps in each random walk,\nour method generates a corpus of vertex pairs which are reachable via paths of\na fixed length. This corpus can then be used to learn a series of latent\nrepresentations, each of which captures successively higher order relationships\nfrom the adjacency matrix.\n  We demonstrate the efficacy of Walklets's latent representations on several\nmulti-label network classification tasks for social networks such as\nBlogCatalog, DBLP, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that Walklets\noutperforms new methods based on neural matrix factorization. Specifically, we\noutperform DeepWalk by up to 10% and LINE by 58% Micro-F1 on challenging\nmulti-label classification tasks. Finally, Walklets is an online algorithm, and\ncan easily scale to graphs with millions of vertices and edges.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the vacuum Bianchi IX model with timelike\nsingularity and compare it with the dynamics of the Bianchi IX model with\ncosmological singularity. We show that differences in the signs of some terms\nin the set of equations specifying the dynamics of both spacetimes lead to\nsignificant differences in their properties.\n", "  We studied chiral phase transitions in the Tsallis nonextensive statistics\nwhich has two parameters, the temperature $T$ and entropic parameter $q$. The\nlinear sigma model was used in this study. The critical temperature,\ncondensate, masses, and energy density were calculated under the massless free\nparticle approximation. The critical temperature decreases as $q$ increases.\nThe condensate at $q>1$ is smaller than that at $q=1$. The sigma mass at $q>1$\nis heavier than the mass at $q=1$ at high temperature, while the sigma mass at\n$q>1$ is lighter than the mass at $q=1$ at low temperature. The pion mass at\n$q>1$ is heavier than the mass at $q=1$. The energy density increases\nremarkably as $q$ increases. The $q$ dependence in the case of the\n$q$-expectation value is weaker than that in the case of the conventional\nexpectation value with a Tsallis distribution. The parameter $q$ should be\nsmaller than $4/3$ from energetic point of view. The validity of the Tsallis\nstatistics can be determined by the difference in $q$ of the restriction for\n$5/4 < q < 4/3$ when the interaction is weak, because the parameter $q$ is\nsmaller than $5/4$ in the case of the conventional expectation value with a\nTsallis distribution.\n", "  In the maritime industry, the injection of air bubbles into the turbulent\nboundary layer under the ship hull is seen as one of the most promising\ntechniques to reduce the overall fuel consumption. However, the exact mechanism\nbehind bubble drag reduction is unknown. Here we show that bubble drag\nreduction in turbulent flow dramatically depends on the bubble size. By adding\nminute concentrations (6 ppm) of the surfactant Triton X-100 into otherwise\ncompletely unchanged strongly turbulent Taylor-Couette flow containing bubbles,\nwe dramatically reduce the drag reduction from more than 40% to about 4%,\ncorresponding to the trivial effect of the bubbles on the density and viscosity\nof the liquid. The reason for this striking behavior is that the addition of\nsurfactants prevents bubble coalescence, leading to much smaller bubbles. Our\nresult demonstrates that bubble deformability is crucial for bubble drag\nreduction in turbulent flow and opens the door for an optimization of the\nprocess.\n", "  We prove that Kitaev's lattice model for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf\nalgebra H is equivalent to the combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons\ntheory for the Drinfeld double D(H). This shows that Kitaev models are a\nspecial case of the older and more general combinatorial models. This\nequivalence is an analogue of the relation between Turaev-Viro and\nReshetikhin-Turaev TQFTs and relates them to the quantisation of moduli spaces\nof flat connections.\n  We show that the topological invariants of the two models, the algebra of\noperators acting on the protected space of the Kitaev model and the quantum\nmoduli algebra from the combinatorial quantisation formalism, are isomorphic.\nThis is established in a gauge theoretical picture, in which both models appear\nas Hopf algebra valued lattice gauge theories.\n  We first prove that the triangle operators of a Kitaev model form a module\nalgebra over a Hopf algebra of gauge transformations and that this module\nalgebra is isomorphic to the lattice algebra in the combinatorial formalism.\nBoth algebras can be viewed as the algebra of functions on gauge fields in a\nHopf algebra gauge theory. The isomorphism between them induces an algebra\nisomorphism between their subalgebras of invariants, which are interpreted as\ngauge invariant functions or observables. It also relates the curvatures in the\ntwo models, which are given as holonomies around the faces of the lattice. This\nyields an isomorphism between the subalgebras obtained by projecting out\ncurvatures, which can be viewed as the algebras of functions on flat gauge\nfields and are the topological invariants of the two models.\n", "  A hidden sector with a mass gap undergoes an epoch of cannibalism if number\nchanging interactions are active when the temperature drops below the mass of\nthe lightest hidden particle. During cannibalism, the hidden sector temperature\ndecreases only logarithmically with the scale factor. We consider the\npossibility that dark matter resides in a hidden sector that underwent\ncannibalism, and has relic density set by the freeze-out of two-to-two\nannihilations. We identify three novel phases, depending on the behavior of the\nhidden sector when dark matter freezes out. During the cannibal phase, dark\nmatter annihilations decouple while the hidden sector is cannibalizing. During\nthe chemical phase, only two-to-two interactions are active and the total\nnumber of hidden particles is conserved. During the one way phase, the dark\nmatter annihilation products decay out of equilibrium, suppressing the\nproduction of dark matter from inverse annihilations. We map out the distinct\nphenomenology of each phase, which includes a boosted dark matter annihilation\nrate, new relativistic degrees of freedom, warm dark matter, and observable\ndistortions to the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.\n", "  We study current fluctuations in tunnel junctions driven by a voltage source.\nThe voltage is applied to the tunneling element via an impedance providing an\nelectromagnetic environment of the junction. We use circuit theory to relate\nthe fluctuations of the current flowing in the leads of the junction with the\nvoltage fluctuations generated by the environmental impedance and the\nfluctuations of the tunneling current. The spectrum of current fluctuations is\nfound to consist of three parts: a term arising from the environmental\nJohnson-Nyquist noise, a term due to the shot noise of the tunneling current\nand a third term describing the cross-correlation between these two noise\nsources. Our phenomenological theory reproduces previous results based on the\nHamiltonian model for the dynamical Coulomb blockade and provides a simple\nunderstanding of the current fluctuation spectrum in terms of circuit theory\nand properties of the average current. Specific results are given for a tunnel\njunction driven through a resonator.\n", "  The motive of this work is to understand the complex spatial characteristics\nof finite-amplitude elastic wave propagation in periodic structures and\nleverage the unique opportunities offered by nonlinearity to activate\ncomplementary functionalities and design adaptive spatial wave manipulators.\nThe underlying assumption is that the magnitude of wave propagation is small\nwith respect to the length scale of the structure under consideration, albeit\nlarge enough to elicit the effects of finite-deformation. We demonstrate that\nthe interplay of dispersion, nonlinearity and modal complexity involved in the\ngeneration and propagation of higher harmonics gives rise to secondary wave\npackets that feature multiple characteristics, one of which conforms to the\ndispersion relation of the corresponding linear structure. This provides an\nopportunity to engineer desired wave characteristics through a geometric and\ntopological design of the unit cell, and results in the ability to activate\ncomplementary functionalities, typical of high frequency regimes, while\noperating at low frequencies of excitation - an effect seldom observed in\nlinear periodic structures. The ability to design adaptive switches is\ndemonstrated here using lattice configurations whose response is characterized\nby geometric and/or material nonlinearities.\n", "  We construct an expansion of the solutions of the bi-confluent Heun equation\nin terms of the Hermite functions. The series is governed by a three-term\nrecurrence relation between successive coefficients of the expansion. We\nexamine the restrictions that are imposed on the involved parameters in order\nthat the series terminates thus resulting in closed-form finite-sum solutions\nof the bi-confluent Heun equation. A physical application of the closed-form\nsolutions is discussed. We present the five six-parametric potentials for which\nthe general solution of the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation is written\nin terms of the bi-confluent Heun functions and further identify a particular\nconditionally integrable potential for which the involved bi-confluent Heun\nfunction admits a four-term finite-sum expansion in terms of the Hermite\nfunctions. This is an infinite well defined on a half-axis. We present the\nexplicit solution of the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation for this\npotential and discuss the bound states supported by the potential. We derive\nthe exact equation for the energy spectrum and construct an accurate\napproximation for the bound-state energy levels.\n", "  We analyze the temperature dependence of the electron spin resonance\nlinewidth above the critical region in exchange-coupled magnetic insulators.\nThe focus is on separating the contributions to the linewidth from spin-spin\ninteractions, spin-one-phonon interactions and spin-two-phonon interactions at\ntemperatures where the spin-spin term is constant and the one- and two-phonon\nterms vary as T and T^2, respectively. Taking Co3O4 as an example, we use a\nleast squares fit over the temperature range 50 K < T < 500 K to obtain values\nof the three components. It is found that the spin-spin mechanism is dominant\nbelow 100 K, while the two-phonon mechanism is most important above 250 K. In\nthe intermediate region, all three mechanisms make significant contributions.\n", "  Amorphous media at finite temperatures, be them liquids, colloids or glasses,\nare made of interacting particles that move chaotically due to thermal energy,\ncolliding and scattering continuously off each other. When the average\nconfiguration in these systems relaxes only at long times, one can introduce\n{\\em effective interactions} that keep the {\\em mean positions} in mechanical\nequilibrium. We introduce a new framework to determine these effective\nforce-laws that define an effective Hessian that can be employed to discuss\nstability properties and density of states of the amorphous system. We\nexemplify the approach with a thermal glass of hard spheres; these feel zero\nforces when not in contact and infinite forces when they touch. The present\napproach recaptures the effective interactions which for sufficiently dense\nspheres at temperature $T$ depends on the gap $h$ between spheres as $T/h$ [C.\nBrito and M. Wyart, Europhys. Lett. 76 149 (2006)]. In systems at lower\ndensities or with longer microscopic interaction (say like Lennard-Jones), the\nemergent force laws will include ternary, quaternary and generally higher order\nmany-body terms, even if the microscopic interactions are strictly binary.\n", "  Tensor network states, and in particular projected entangled pair states,\nplay an important role in the description of strongly correlated quantum\nlattice systems. They do not only serve as variational states in numerical\nsimulation methods, but also provide a framework for classifying phases of\nquantum matter and capture notions of topological order in a stringent and\nrigorous language. The rapid development in this field for spin models and\nbosonic systems has not yet been mirrored by an analogous development for\nfermionic models. In this work, we introduce a framework of tensor networks\nhaving a fermionic component capable of capturing notions of topological order.\nAt the heart of the formalism are axioms of fermionic matrix product operator\ninjectivity, stable under concatenation. Building upon that, we formulate a\nGrassmann number tensor network ansatz for the ground state of fermionic\ntwisted quantum double models. A specific focus is put on the paradigmatic\nexample of the fermionic toric code. This work shows that the program of\ndescribing topologically ordered systems using tensor networks carries over to\nfermionic models.\n", "  Terrestrial exoplanets in the canonical habitable zone may have a variety of\ninitial water fractions due to random volatile delivery by planetesimals. If\nthe total planetary water complement is high, the entire surface may be covered\nin water, forming a \"waterworld.\" On a planet with active tectonics, competing\nmechanisms act to regulate the abundance of water on the surface by determining\nthe partitioning of water between interior and surface. Here we explore how the\nincorporation of different mechanisms for the degassing and regassing of water\nchanges the volatile evolution of a planet. For all of the models considered,\nvolatile cycling reaches an approximate steady-state after $\\sim 2 \\\n\\mathrm{Gyr}$. Using these steady-states, we find that if volatile cycling is\neither solely dependent on temperature or seafloor pressure, exoplanets require\na high abundance ($\\gtrsim 0.3\\%$ of total mass) of water to have fully\ninundated surfaces. However, if degassing is more dependent on seafloor\npressure and regassing mainly dependent on mantle temperature, the degassing\nrate is relatively large at late times and a steady-state between degassing and\nregassing is reached with a substantial surface water fraction. If this hybrid\nmodel is physical, super-Earths with a total water fraction similar to that of\nthe Earth can become waterworlds. As a result, further understanding of the\nprocesses that drive volatile cycling on terrestrial planets is needed to\ndetermine the water fraction at which they are likely to become waterworlds.\n", "  We show that high energy measurements of Drell-Yan at the LHC can serve as\nelectroweak precision tests. Dimension-6 operators, from the Standard Model\nEffective Field Theory, modify the high energy behavior of electroweak gauge\nboson propagators. Existing measurements of the dilepton invariant mass\nspectrum, from neutral current Drell-Yan at 8 TeV, have comparable sensitivity\nto LEP. We propose measuring the transverse mass spectrum of charged current\nDrell-Yan, which can surpass LEP already with 8 TeV data. The 13 TeV LHC will\nelevate electroweak tests to a new precision frontier.\n", "  We design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which studies correlation\nbetween discretized inverse temperature and spin configuration of 2D Ising\nmodel and show that it can find a feature of the phase transition without\nteaching any a priori information for it. We also define a new order parameter\nvia the CNN and show that it provides well approximated critical inverse\ntemperature. In addition, we compare the activation functions for convolution\nlayer and find that the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is important to detect the\nphase transition of 2D Ising model.\n", "  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides an efficient means to exchange\ninformation in an unconditionally secure way. Historically, QKD protocols have\nbeen based on binary signal formats, such as two polarisation states, and the\ntransmitted information efficiency of the quantum key is intrinsically limited\nto 1 bit/photon. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate, for the first\ntime, a high-dimensional QKD protocol based on space division multiplexing in\nmulticore fiber using silicon photonic integrated lightwave circuits. We\nsuccessfully realized three mutually unbiased bases in a four-dimensional\nHilbert space, and achieved low and stable quantum bit error rate well below\nboth coherent attack and individual attack limits. Compared to previous\ndemonstrations, the use of a multicore fiber in our protocol provides a much\nmore efficient way to create high-dimensional quantum states, and enables\nbreaking the information efficiency limit of traditional QKD protocols. In\naddition, the silicon photonic circuits used in our work integrate variable\noptical attenuators, highly efficient multicore fiber couplers, and\nMach-Zehnder interferometers, enabling manipulating high-dimensional quantum\nstates in a compact and stable means. Our demonstration pave the way to utilize\nstate-of-the-art multicore fibers for long distance high-dimensional QKD, and\nboost silicon photonics for high information efficiency quantum communications.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenology of Composite 2-Higgs Doublet Models (C2HDMs)\nof various Yukawa types based on the global symmetry breaking $SO(6)\\to\nSO(4)\\times SO(2)$. The kinetic term and the Yukawa Lagrangian are constructed\nin terms of the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone Boson (pNGB) matrix and a 6-plet of\nfermions under $SO(6)$. The scalar potential is assumed to be the same as that\nof the Elementary 2-Higgs Doublet Model (E2HDM) with a softly-broken discrete\n$Z_2$ symmetry. We then discuss the phenomenological differences between the\nE2HDM and C2HDM by focusing on the deviations from Standard Model (SM)\ncouplings of the discovered Higgs state ($h$) as well as on the production\ncross sections and Branching Ratios (BRs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of\nextra Higgs bosons. We find that, even if the same deviation in the $hVV$\n($V=W,Z$) coupling is assumed in both scenarios, there appear significant\ndifferences between E2HDM and C2HDM from the structure of the Yukawa couplings,\nso that production and decay features of extra Higgs bosons can be used to\ndistinguish between the two scenarios.\n", "  Graphics processing units have been extensively used to accelerate classical\nmolecular dynamics simulations. However, there is much less progress on the\nacceleration of force evaluations for many-body potentials compared to pairwise\nones. In the conventional force evaluation algorithm for many-body potentials,\nthe force, virial stress, and heat current for a given atom are accumulated\nwithin different loops, which could result in write conflict between different\nthreads in a CUDA kernel. In this work, we provide a new force evaluation\nalgorithm, which is based on an explicit pairwise force expression for\nmany-body potentials derived recently [Phys. Rev. B 92 (2015) 094301]. In our\nalgorithm, the force, virial stress, and heat current for a given atom can be\naccumulated within a single thread and is free of write conflicts. We discuss\nthe formulations and algorithms and evaluate their performance. A new\nopen-source code, GPUMD, is developed based on the proposed formulations. For\nthe Tersoff many-body potential, the double precision performance of GPUMD\nusing a Tesla K40 card is equivalent to that of the LAMMPS (Large-scale\nAtomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) molecular dynamics code running\nwith about 100 CPU cores (Intel Xeon CPU X5670 @ 2.93 GHz).\n", "  The full-phase infrared light curves of low-eccentricity hot Jupiters show a\ntrend of increasing fractional dayside-nightside brightness temperature\ndifference with increasing incident stellar flux, both averaged across the\ninfrared and in each individual wavelength band. The analytic theory of Komacek\n& Showman (2016) shows that this trend is due to the decreasing ability with\nincreasing incident stellar flux of waves to propagate from day to night and\nerase temperature differences. Here, we compare the predictions of this theory\nto observations, showing that it explains well the shape of the trend of\nincreasing dayside-nightside temperature difference with increasing equilibrium\ntemperature. Applied to individual planets, the theory matches well with\nobservations at high equilibrium temperatures but, for a fixed photosphere\npressure of $100 \\ \\mathrm{mbar}$, systematically under-predicts the\ndayside-nightside brightness temperature differences at equilibrium\ntemperatures less than $2000 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. We interpret this as due to as the\neffects of a process that moves the infrared photospheres of these cooler hot\nJupiters to lower pressures. We also utilize general circulation modeling with\ndouble-grey radiative transfer to explore how the circulation changes with\nequilibrium temperature and drag strengths. As expected from our theory, the\ndayside-nightside temperature differences from our numerical simulations\nincrease with increasing incident stellar flux and drag strengths. We calculate\nmodel phase curves using our general circulation models, from which we compare\nthe broadband infrared offset from the substellar point and dayside-nightside\nbrightness temperature differences against observations, finding that strong\ndrag or additional effects (e.g. clouds and/or supersolar metallicities) are\nnecessary to explain many observed phase curves.\n", "  A hidden sector with pure non-abelian gauge symmetry is an elegant and just\nabout the simplest model of dark matter. In this model the dark matter\ncandidate is the lightest bound state made of the confined gauge fields, the\ndark glueball. In spite of its simplicity, the model has been shown to have\nseveral interesting non-standard implications in cosmology. In this work, we\nexplore the gravitational waves from binary boson stars made of\nself-gravitating dark glueball fields as a natural and important consequence.\nWe derive the dark SU($N$) star mass and radius as functions of the only two\nfundamental parameters in the model, the glueball mass $m$ and the number of\ncolors $N$, and identify the regions that could be probed by the LIGO and\nfuture gravitational wave observatories.\n", "  Non-associative algebras appear in some quantum-mechanical systems, for\ninstance if a charged particle in a distribution of magnetic monopoles is\nconsidered. Using methods of deformation quantization it is shown here, that\nalgebras for such systems cannot be alternative, i.e. their associator cannot\nbe completely anti-symmetric.\n", "  The theory of quantum optomechanics is reconstructed from first principles by\nfinding a Lagrangian from light's equation of motion and then proceeding to the\nHamiltonian. The nonlinear terms, including the quadratic and higher-order\ninteractions, do not vanish under any possible choice of canonical parameters,\nand lead to coupling of momentum and field. The existence of quadratic\nmechanical parametric interaction is then demonstrated rigorously, which has\nbeen so far assumed phenomenologically in previous studies. Corrections to the\nquadratic terms are particularly significant when the mechanical frequency is\nof the same order or larger than the electromagnetic frequency. Further\ndiscussions on the squeezing as well as relativistic corrections are presented.\n", "  We investigate the Polyakov loop effects on the QCD phase diagram by using\nthe strong-coupling (1/g^2) expansion of the lattice QCD (SC-LQCD) with one\nspecies of unrooted staggered quark, including O}(1/g^4) effects. We take\naccount of the effects of Polyakov loop fluctuations in Weiss mean-field\napproximation (MFA), and compare the results with those in the Haar-measure MFA\n(no fluctuation from the mean-field). The Polyakov loops strongly suppress the\nchiral transition temperature in the second-order/crossover region at small\nchemical potential, while they give a minor modification of the first-order\nphase boundary at larger chemical potential. The Polyakov loops also account\nfor a drastic increase of the interaction measure near the chiral phase\ntransition. The chiral and Polyakov loop susceptibilities have their peaks\nclose to each other in the second-order/crossover region. In particular in\nWeiss MFA, there is no indication of the separated deconfinement transition\nboundary from the chiral phase boundary at any chemical potential. We discuss\nthe interplay between the chiral and deconfinement dynamics via the bare quark\nmass dependence of susceptibilities.\n", "  In this letter, we experimentally investigate the directional characteristics\nof propagating, finite-amplitude wave packets in lattice materials, with an\nemphasis on the functionality enhancement due to the nonlinearly-generated\nhigher harmonics. To this end, we subject a thin, periodically perforated sheet\nto out-of-plane harmonic excitations, and we design a systematic measurement\nand data processing routine that leverages the full-wavefield reconstruction\ncapabilities of a laser vibrometer to precisely delineate the effects of\nnonlinearity. We demonstrate experimentally that the interplay of dispersion,\nnonlinearity, and modal complexity which is involved in the generation and\npropagation of higher harmonics gives rise to secondary wave packets with\ncharacteristics that conform to the dispersion relation of the corresponding\nlinear structure. Furthermore, these nonlinearly generated wave features\ndisplay modal and directional characteristics that are complementary to those\nexhibited by the fundamental harmonic, thus resulting in an augmentation of the\nfunctionality landscape of the lattice. These results provide proof of concept\nfor the possibility to engineer the nonlinear wave response of mechanical\nmetamaterials through a geometric and topological design of the unit cell.\n", "  We introduce the first multiorbital effective tight-binding model to describe\nthe effect of electron-electron interactions in this system. Upon fixing all\nthe effective hopping parameters in the normal state against an ab initio band\nstructure, and with only the overall scale of the interactions as the sole\nadjustable parameter, we find that a self-consistent Hartree-Fock solution\nreproduces extremely well the experimental behavior of the charge density wave\n(CDW) order parameter in the full range $0<T<T_{\\text{c}}$, as well as the\nprecise reciprocal space locations of the partial gap opening and Fermi arc\ndevelopment. The interaction strengths extracted from fitting to the\nexperimental CDW gap are consistent with those derived from an independent\nStoner-type analysis.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are hailed as a potential technology for data storage and\nother data processing devices. However, their stability against thermal\nfluctuations is an open question that must be answered before skyrmion-based\ndevices can be designed. In this work, we study paths in the energy landscape\nvia which the transition between the skyrmion and the uniform state can occur\nin interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya finite-sized systems. We find three\nmechanisms the system can take in the process of skyrmion nucleation or\ndestruction and identify that the transition facilitated by the boundary has a\nsignificantly lower energy barrier than the other energy paths. This clearly\ndemonstrates the lack of the skyrmion topological protection in finite-sized\nmagnetic systems. Overall, the energy barriers of the system under\ninvestigation are too small for storage applications at room temperature, but\nresearch into device materials, geometry and design may be able to address\nthis.\n", "  Locally resonant metamaterials are characterized by bandgaps at wavelengths\nthat are much larger than the lattice size, enabling low-frequency vibration\nattenuation. Typically, bandgap analyses and predictions rely on the assumption\nof traveling waves in an infinite medium, and do not take advantage of modal\nrepresentations typically used for the analysis of the dynamic behavior of\nfinite structures. Recently, we developed a method for understanding the\nlocally resonant bandgap in uniform finite metamaterial beams using modal\nanalysis. Here we extend that framework to general locally resonant\nmetastructures with specified boundary conditions using a general operator\nformulation. Using this approach, along with the assumption of an infinite\nnumber of resonators tuned to the same frequency, the frequency range of the\nlocally resonant bandgap is easily derived in closed form. Furthermore, the\nbandgap expression is shown to be the same regardless of the type of vibration\nproblem under consideration, depending only on the added mass ratio and target\nfrequency. It is shown that the number of resonators required for the bandgap\nto appear increases with the target frequency range, i.e. respective modal\nneighborhood. Furthermore, it is observed that there is an optimal, finite\nnumber of resonators which gives a bandgap that is wider than the\ninfinite-absorber bandgap, and that the optimal number of resonators increases\nwith target frequency and added mass ratio. As the number of resonators becomes\nsufficiently large, the bandgap converges to the derived infinite-absorber\nbandgap. The derived bandgap edge frequencies are shown to agree with results\nfrom dispersion analysis using the plane wave expansion method. Numerical and\nexperimental investigations are performed regarding the effects of mass ratio,\nnon-uniform spacing of resonators, and parameter variations among the\nresonators.\n", "  It is believed that nanostructuring is an effective way to achieve excellent\nthermoelectric performance. In the work, by combining the first-principles\ncalculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate the\nthermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer BiTeBr including both the\nelectron and phonon transports. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)\nplus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is employed for the electron part, and GGA for\nthe phonon part. It is found that SOC has important effects on electronic\ntransport coefficients because of SOC-induced obvious influences on energy band\nstructures. In p-type doping, monolayer has larger Seebeck coefficient than\nbulk in wide doping range, which is beneficial to excellent thermoelectric\nperformance. The calculated average lattice thermal conductivity of bulk is\n1.71 $\\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ at room temperature, which is close to\nexperimental value 1.3 $\\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$. Calculated results show that\nmonolayer has better $ZT_e$ and lower lattice thermal conductivity than bulk,\nwhich suggests that monolayer has better thermoelectric performance than bulk.\nThe lower lattice thermal conductivity in monolayer than bulk is due to shorter\nphonon lifetimes. By comparing the experimental electrical conductivity of bulk\nwith calculated value, the scattering time is determined for 3.3 $\\times$\n$10^{-14}$ s. Based on electron and phonon transport coefficients, the\nthermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ of bulk and monolayer are calculated. It is\nfound that monolayer has higher peak $ZT$ than bulk, and the peak $ZT$ of\nmonolayer can be as high as 0.55 in n-type doping and 0.75 in p-type doping at\nroom temperature. These results imply that monolayer BiTeBr may be a potential\ntwo-dimensional (2D) thermoelectric material, which can stimulate further\nexperimental works to synthesize monolayer BiTeBr.\n", "  This paper discusses the noisy phase retrieval problem: recovering a complex\nimage signal with independent noise from quadratic measurements. Inspired by\nthe dark fringes shown in the measured images of the array detector, a novel\nphase retrieval approach is proposed and demonstrated both theoretically and\nexperimentally to recognize the dark fringes and bypass the invalid fringes. A\nmore accurate relative phase ratio between arbitrary two pixels is achieved by\ncalculating the multiplicative ratios (or the sum of phase difference) on the\npath between them. Then the object phase image can be reconstructed precisely.\nOur approach is a good choice for retrieving high-quality phase images from\nnoisy signals and has many potential applications in the fields such as X-ray\ncrystallography, diffractive imaging, and so on.\n", "  Holographic model is originated from Holographic principle. The equation of\nstate in Holographic model and Einstein's gravity with particle horizon can be\nobtained as wD>-1/3 and cannot justify the expansion acceleration of the\nUniverse. But, by using the event horizon, this model can result in the\naccelerating expansion in Einstein's gravity and Brans-Dicke cosmology. In this\ncontext, we study the holographic model with apparent horizon satisfying the\nacceleration expansion. We shall see, in the presence of interaction, phase\nchange and transition from decelerated state to accelerated state is possible.\nThis shows the sign of deceleration parameter.\n", "  We consider multi-flavor massless $(1+1)$-dimensional QED with chemical\npotentials at finite spatial length and the zero-temperature limit. Its sign\nproblem is solved using the mean-field calculation with complex saddle points.\n", "  Two-dimensional materials have unusual phonon structures due to the presence\nof flexural (out-of-plane) modes. Although molecular dynamics simulations have\nbeen extensively used to study heat transport in such materials, conventional\nformalisms treat the phonon dynamics isotropically. Here, we decompose the\nmicroscopic heat current in atomistic simulations into in-plane and\nout-of-plane components, corresponding to the in-plane and out-of-plane phonon\ndynamics, respectively. This decomposition allows for direct computation of the\ncorresponding thermal conductivity components in two-dimensional materials. We\napply this decomposition to study heat transport in suspended graphene, using\nboth equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We show\nthat the flexural component is responsible for about two thirds of the total\nthermal conductivity in unstrained graphene, and the acoustic flexural\ncomponent is responsible for the logarithmic divergence of the conductivity\nwhen a sufficiently large tensile strain is applied.\n", "  The weak equivalence principle is studied in a space with noncommutativity of\ncoordinates and noncommutativity of momenta. We find conditions on the\nparameters of noncommutativity which give the possibility to recover the\nequivalence principle in noncommutative phase space. It is also shown that in\nthe case when these conditions are satisfied the motion of the center-of-mass\nof a composite system in noncommutative phase space and the relative motion are\nindependent, the kinetic energy of composite system has additivity property and\nis independent on the systems composition. So, we propose conditions on the\nparameters of noncommutativity which give the possibility to solve the list of\nproblems in noncommutative phase space.\n", "  Quantum phase transitions of three-dimensional (3D) Weyl semimetals (WSMs)\nsubject to uncorrelated on-site disorder are investigated through quantum\nconductance calculations and finite-size scaling of localization length.\nContrary to previous claims that a direct transition from a WSM to a diffusive\nmetal (DM) occurs, an intermediate phase of Chern insulator (CI) between the\ntwo distinct metallic phases should exist due to internode scattering that is\ncomparable to intranode scattering. The critical exponent of localization\nlength is $\\nu\\simeq 1.3$ for both the WSM-CI and CI-DM transitions, in the\nsame universality class of 3D Gaussian unitary ensemble of the Anderson\nlocalization transition. The CI phase is confirmed by quantized nonzero Hall\nconductances in the bulk insulating phase established by localization length\ncalculations. The disorder-induced various plateau-plateau transitions in both\nthe WSM and CI phases are observed and explained by the self-consistent Born\napproximation. Furthermore, we clarify that the occurrence of zero density of\nstates at Weyl nodes is not a good criterion for the disordered WSM, and there\nis no fundamental principle to support the hypothesis of divergence of\nlocalization length at the WSM-DM transition.\n", "  We review the basic properties of effective actions of families of theories\n(i.e., the actions depending on additional non-perturbative moduli along with\nperturbative couplings), and their description in terms of operators (called\ncheck-operators), which act on the moduli space. It is this approach that led\nto constructing the (quantum) spectral curves and what is now nicknamed the\nEO/AMM topological recursion. We explain how the non-commutative algebra of\ncheck-operators is related to the modular kernels and how symplectic (special)\ngeometry emerges from it in the classical (Seiberg-Witten) limit, where the\nquantum integrable structures turn into the well studied classical\nintegrability. As time goes, these results turn applicable to more and more\ntheories of physical importance, supporting the old idea that many universality\nclasses of low-energy effective theories contain matrix model\n", "  The resilience of a complex interconnected system concerns the size of the\nmacroscopic functioning node clusters after external perturbations based on a\nrandom or designed scheme. For a representation of the interconnected systems\nwith directional or asymmetrical interactions among constituents, the directed\nnetwork is a convenient choice. Yet how the interaction directions affect the\nnetwork resilience still lacks thorough exploration. Here, we study the\nresilience of directed networks with a generalized $k$-core pruning process as\na simple failure procedure based on both the in- and out-degrees of nodes, in\nwhich any node with an in-degree $< k_{in}$ or an out-degree $< k_{ou}$ is\nremoved iteratively. With an explicitly analytical framework, we can predict\nthe relative sizes of residual node clusters on uncorrelated directed random\ngraphs. We show that the discontinuous transitions rise for cases with $k_{in}\n\\geq 2$ or $k_{ou} \\geq 2$, and the unidirectional interactions among nodes\ndrive the networks more vulnerable against perturbations based on in- and\nout-degrees separately.\n", "  Eutectic related reaction is a special chemical/physical reaction involving\nmultiple phases, solid and liquid. Visualization of phase reaction of composite\nnanomaterials with high spatial and temporal resolution provides a key\nunderstanding of alloy growth with important industrial applications. However,\nit has been a rather challenging task. Here we report the direct imaging and\ncontrol of the phase reaction dynamics of a single, as-grown free-standing\ngallium arsenide nanowire encapped with a gold nanoparticle, free from\nenvironmental confinement or disturbance, using four-dimensional electron\nmicroscopy. The non-destructive preparation of as-grown free-standing nanowires\nwithout supporting films allows us to study their anisotropic properties in\ntheir native environment with better statistical character. A laser heating\npulse initiates the eutectic related reaction at a temperature much lower than\nthe melting points of the composite materials, followed by a precisely\ntime-delayed electron pulse to visualize the irreversible transient states of\nnucleation, growth and solidification of the complex. Combined with theoretical\nmodeling, useful thermodynamic parameters of the newly formed alloy phases and\ntheir crystal structures could be determined. This technique of dynamical\ncontrol and 4D imaging of phase reaction processes on the nanometer-ultrafast\ntime scale open new venues for engineering various reactions in a wide variety\nof other systems.\n", "  In a recent paper [15], Giardin{\\`a}, Giberti, Hofstad, Prioriello have\nproved a law of large number and a central limit theorem with respect to the\nannealed measure for the magnetization of the Ising model on some random graphs\nincluding the random 2-regular graph. We present a new proof of their results,\nwhich applies to all random regular graphs. In addition, we prove the existence\nof annealed pressure in the case of configuration model random graphs.\n", "  Many intercalation compounds possess layered structures or inter-penetrating\nlattices that enable phase separation into three or more stable phases, or\n\"stages,\" driven by competing intra-layer and inter-layer forces. While these\nstructures are often well characterized in equilibrium, their effects on\nintercalation kinetics and transport far from equilibrium are typically\nneglected or approximated by empirical solid solution models. Here, we\nformulate a general phase-field model with thermodynamically consistent\nreaction kinetics and cooperative transport to capture the dynamics of\nintercalation in layered materials. As an important case for Li-ion batteries,\nwe model single particles of lithium intercalated graphite as having a periodic\ntwo-layer structure with three stable phases, corresponding to zero, one, or\ntwo layers full of lithium. The electrochemical intercalation reaction is\ndescribed by a generalized Butler-Volmer equation with thermodynamic factors to\naccount for the flexible structure of the graphene planes. The model naturally\ncaptures the \"voltage staircase\" discharge curves as a result of staging\ndynamics with internal \"checkerboard\" domains, which cannot be described by\nsolid-solution models based on Fickian diffusion. On the other hand, the\ntwo-layer model is computationally expensive and excludes low-density stable\nphases with longer-range periodicity, so we also present a reduced model for\ngraphite, which captures the high-density stages while fitting the low-density\nvoltage profile as an effective solid solution. The two models illustrate the\ngeneral tradeoff between the explicit modeling of periodic layers or lattices\nand the needs for computational efficiency and accurate fitting of experimental\ndata.\n", "  We investigate core-collapse supernova (CCSN) nucleosynthesis with\nself-consistent, axisymmetric (2D) simulations performed using the\nradiation-hydrodynamics code Chimera. Computational costs have traditionally\nconstrained the evolution of the nuclear composition within multidimensional\nCCSN models to, at best, a 14-species $\\alpha$-network capable of tracking only\n$(\\alpha,\\gamma)$ reactions from $^{4}$He to $^{60}$Zn. Such a simplified\nnetwork limits the ability to accurately evolve detailed composition and\nneutronization or calculate the nuclear energy generation rate. Lagrangian\ntracer particles are commonly used to extend the nuclear network evolution by\nincorporating more realistic networks in post-processing nucleosynthesis\ncalculations. However, limitations such as poor spatial resolution of the\ntracer particles, inconsistent thermodynamic evolution, including misestimation\nof expansion timescales, and uncertain determination of the multidimensional\nmass-cut at the end of the simulation impose uncertainties inherent to this\napproach. We present a detailed analysis of the impact of such uncertainties\nfor four self-consistent axisymmetric CCSN models initiated from stellar\nmetallicity, non-rotating progenitors of 12 $M_\\odot$, 15 $M_\\odot$, 20\n$M_\\odot$, and 25 $M_\\odot$ and evolved with the smaller $\\alpha$-network to\nmore than 1 s after the launch of an explosion.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the effect of supersymmetry on the symmetry\nclassification of random matrix theory ensembles. We mainly consider the random\nmatrix behaviors in the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric generalization of\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, a toy model for two-dimensional quantum black\nhole with supersymmetric constraint. Some analytical arguments and numerical\nresults are given to show that the statistics of the supersymmetric SYK model\ncould be interpreted as random matrix theory ensembles, with a different\neight-fold classification from the original SYK model and some new features.\nThe time-dependent evolution of the spectral form factor is also investigated,\nwhere predictions from random matrix theory are governing the late time\nbehavior of the chaotic hamiltonian with supersymmetry.\n", "  The ZX-Calculus is a powerful graphical language for quantum mechanics and\nquantum information processing. The completeness of the language -- i.e. the\nability to derive any true equation -- is a crucial question. In the quest of a\ncomplete ZX-calculus, supplementarity has been recently proved to be necessary\nfor quantum diagram reasoning (MFCS 2016). Roughly speaking, supplementarity\nconsists in merging two subdiagrams when they are parameterized by antipodal\nangles. We introduce a generalised supplementarity -- called cyclotomic\nsupplementarity -- which consists in merging n subdiagrams at once, when the n\nangles divide the circle into equal parts. We show that when n is an odd prime\nnumber, the cyclotomic supplementarity cannot be derived, leading to a\ncountable family of new axioms for diagrammatic quantum reasoning.We exhibit\nanother new simple axiom that cannot be derived from the existing rules of the\nZX-Calculus, implying in particular the incompleteness of the language for the\nso-called Clifford+T quantum mechanics. We end up with a new axiomatisation of\nan extended ZX-Calculus, including an axiom schema for the cyclotomic\nsupplementarity.\n", "  We present a search for a light sterile neutrino using three years of\natmospheric neutrino data from the DeepCore detector in the energy range of\napproximately $10-60~$GeV. DeepCore is the low-energy sub-array of the IceCube\nNeutrino Observatory. The standard three-neutrino paradigm can be probed by\nadding an additional light ($\\Delta m_{41}^2 \\sim 1 \\mathrm{\\ eV^2}$) sterile\nneutrino. Sterile neutrinos do not interact through the standard weak\ninteraction, and therefore cannot be directly detected. However, their mixing\nwith the three active neutrino states leaves an imprint on the standard\natmospheric neutrino oscillations for energies below 100 GeV. A search for such\nmixing via muon neutrino disappearance is presented here. The data are found to\nbe consistent with the standard three neutrino hypothesis. Therefore we derive\nlimits on the mixing matrix elements at the level of $|U_{\\mu4}|^2 < 0.11 $ and\n$|U_{\\tau4}|^2 < 0.15 $ (90% C.L.) for the sterile neutrino mass splitting\n$\\Delta m_{41}^2 = 1.0$ eV$^2$.\n", "  Deep learning has been proven to yield reliably generalizable answers to\nnumerous classification and decision tasks. Here, we demonstrate for the first\ntime, to our knowledge, that deep neural networks (DNNs) can be trained to\nsolve inverse problems in computational imaging. We experimentally demonstrate\na lens-less imaging system where a DNN was trained to recover a phase object\ngiven a raw intensity image recorded some distance away.\n", "  According to electronic structure theory, bilayer graphene is expected to\nhave anomalous electronic properties when it has long-period moir\\'e patterns\nproduced by small misalignments between its individual layer honeycomb\nlattices. We have realized bilayer graphene moir\\'e crystals with accurately\ncontrolled twist angles smaller than 1 degree and studied their properties\nusing scanning probe microscopy and electron transport. We observe conductivity\nminima at charge neutrality, satellite gaps that appear at anomalous carrier\ndensities for twist angles smaller than 1 degree, and tunneling\ndensities-of-states that are strongly dependent on carrier density. These\nfeatures are robust up to large transverse electric fields. In perpendicular\nmagnetic fields, we observe the emergence of a Hofstadter butterfly in the\nenergy spectrum, with four-fold degenerate Landau levels, and broken symmetry\nquantum Hall states at filling factors 1, 2, 3. These observations demonstrate\nthat at small twist angles, the electronic properties of bilayer graphene\nmoir\\'e crystals are strongly altered by electron-electron interactions.\n", "  In this paper, we study the single top and Higgs associated production $\\rm\ne^- p\\rightarrow \\nu_e \\bar{t} \\rightarrow \\nu_e h \\bar{q}(h\\rightarrow\nb\\bar{b})$ in the top-Higgs FCNC couplings at the LHeC with the electron beam\nenergy of $E_{e}$ = 60 GeV and $E_{e}$ = 120 GeV, combination of a 7 TeV and 50\nTeV proton beam. With the possibility of e-beam polarization ($p_{e}$ = 0,\n$\\pm0.6$), we distinct the Cut-based method and the Multivariate Analysis (MVA)\nbased method, and compare with the current experimental and theoretical limits.\nIt is shown that the branching ratio Br $\\rm(t\\to uh)$ can be probed to 0.113\n(0.093) $\\%$, 0.071 (0.057) $\\%$, 0.030 (0.022) $\\%$ and 0.024 (0.019) $\\%$\nwith the Cut-based (MVA-based) analysis at ($E_{p}$, $E_{e}$) = (7 TeV, 60\nGeV), ($E_{p}$, $E_{e}$) = (7 TeV, 120 GeV), ($E_{p}$, $E_{e}$) = (50 TeV, 60\nGeV) and ($E_{p}$, $E_{e}$) = (50 TeV, 120 GeV) beam energy and 1$\\sigma$\nlevel. With the possibility of e-beam polarization, the expected limits can be\nprobed down to 0.090 (0.073) $\\%$, 0.056 (0.045) $\\%$, 0.024 (0.018) $\\%$ and\n0.019 (0.015) $\\%$, respectively.\n", "  We develop a theory of weakly interacting fermionic atoms in shaken optical\nlattices based on the orbital mixing in the presence of time-periodic\nmodulations. Specifically, we focus on fermionic atoms in circularly shaken\nsquare lattice with near resonance frequencies, i.e., tuned close to the energy\nseparation between $s$-band and the $p$-bands. First, we derive a\ntime-independent four-band effective Hamiltonian in the non-interacting limit.\nDiagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian yields a quasi-energy spectrum\nconsistent with the full numerical Floquet solution that includes all higher\nbands. In particular, we find that the hybridized $s$-band develops multiple\nminima and therefore non-trivial Fermi surfaces at different fillings. We then\nobtain the effective interactions for atoms in the hybridized $s$-band\nanalytically and show that they acquire momentum dependence on the Fermi\nsurface even though the bare interaction is contact-like. We apply the theory\nto find the phase diagram of fermions with weak attractive interactions and\ndemonstrate that the pairing symmetry is $s+d$-wave. Our theory is valid for a\nrange of shaking frequencies near resonance, and it can be generalized to other\nphases of interacting fermions in shaken lattices.\n", "  The mechanisms by which organs acquire their functional structure and realize\nits maintenance (or homeostasis) over time are still largely unknown. In this\npaper, we investigate this question on adipose tissue. Adipose tissue can\nrepresent 20 to 50% of the body weight. Its investigation is key to overcome a\nlarge array of metabolic disorders that heavily strike populations worldwide.\nAdipose tissue consists of lobular clusters of adipocytes surrounded by an\norganized collagen fiber network. By supplying substrates needed for\nadipogenesis, vasculature was believed to induce the regroupment of adipocytes\nnear capillary extremities. This paper shows that the emergence of these\nstructures could be explained by simple mechanical interactions between the\nadipocytes and the collagen fibers. Our assumption is that the fiber network\nresists the pressure induced by the growing adipocytes and forces them to\nregroup into clusters. Reciprocally, cell clusters force the fibers to merge\ninto a well-organized network. We validate this hypothesis by means of a\ntwo-dimensional Individual Based Model (IBM) of interacting adipocytes and\nextra-cellular-matrix fiber elements. The model produces structures that\ncompare quantitatively well to the experimental observations. Our model seems\nto indicate that cell clusters could spontaneously emerge as a result of simple\nmechanical interactions between cells and fibers and surprisingly, vasculature\nis not directly needed for these structures to emerge.\n", "  We report the result of a search for sterile neutrinos with the latest\ncosmological observations. Both cases of massless and massive sterile neutrinos\nare considered in the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The cosmological observations\nused in this work include the Planck 2015 temperature and polarization data,\nthe baryon acoustic oscillation data, the Hubble constant direct measurement\ndata, the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich cluster counts data, the Planck lensing\ndata, and the cosmic shear data. We find that the current observational data\ngive a hint of the existence of massless sterile neutrino (as dark radiation)\nat the 1.44$\\sigma$ level, and the consideration of an extra massless sterile\nneutrino can indeed relieve the tension between observations and improve the\ncosmological fit. For the case of massive sterile neutrino, the observations\ngive a rather tight upper limit on the mass, which implies that actually a\nmassless sterile neutrino is more favored. Our result is consistent with the\nrecent result of neutrino oscillation experiment done by the Daya Bay and MINOS\ncollaborations, as well as the recent result of cosmic ray experiment done by\nthe IceCube collaboration.\n", "  Different interpretations of narrow structures at $W\\sim 1.68$ and $W\\sim\n1.72$ GeV observed in several reactions are discussed. It is questionable\nwhether interference phenomena could explain the whole complex of experimental\nfindings. More probable hypotheses would be the existence of one or two narrow\nresonances $N(1685)$ and $N(1726)$ and/or the sub-threshold virtual $K\\Sigma$\nand $\\omega p$ production (cusps).\n", "  The probabilities of tunnel ionization of particles confined by\none-dimensional power-law and logarithmic potentials are calculated for\nconstant and low-frequency electric fields.\n", "  Detailed analysis of the system of four interacting ultra-cold fermions\nconfined in a one-dimensional harmonic trap is performed. The analysis is done\nin the framework of a simple variational ansatz for the many-body ground state\nand its predictions are confronted with the results of numerically exact\ndiagonalization of the many-body Hamiltonian. Short discussion on the role of\nthe quantum statistics, i.e. Bose-Bose and Bose-Fermi mixtures is also\npresented. It is concluded that the variational ansatz, although seemed to be\noversimplified, gives surprisingly good predictions of many different\nquantities for mixtures of equal as well as different mass systems. The result\nmay have some experimental importance since it gives quite simple and validated\nmethod for describing experimental outputs.\n", "  The naturalness of electroweak scale in the models of type-I seesaw mechanism\nwith ${\\cal O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings requires TeV scale masses for the fermion\nsinglets. In this case, the tiny neutrino masses have to arise from the\ncancellations within the seesaw formula which are arranged by fine-tuned\ncorrelations between the Yukawa couplings and the masses of fermion singlets.\nWe motivate such correlations through the framework of discrete symmetries. In\nthe case of three Majorana fermion singlets, it is shown that the exact\ncancellation arranged by the discrete symmetries in seesaw formula necessarily\nleads to two mass degenerate fermion singlets. The remaining fermion singlet\ndecouples completely from the standard model. We provide two candidate models\nbased on the groups $A_4$ and $\\Sigma(81)$ and discuss the generic\nperturbations to this approach which can lead to the viable neutrino masses.\n", "  We construct a Markov-chain representation of the surface-ocean Lagrangian\ndynamics in a region occupied by the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and adjacent portions\nof the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic using satellite-tracked drifter\ntrajectory data, the largest collection so far considered. From the analysis of\nthe eigenvectors of the transition matrix associated with the chain, we\nidentify almost-invariant attracting sets and their basins of attraction. With\nthis information we decompose the GoM's geography into weakly dynamically\ninteracting provinces, which constrain the connectivity between distant\nlocations within the GoM. Offshore oil exploration, oil spill contingency\nplanning, and fish larval connectivity assessment are among the many activities\nthat can benefit from the dynamical information carried in the geography\nconstructed here.\n", "  Using the Floquet formalism we study transport through an AC-driven impurity\nin a tight binding chain. The results obtained are exact and valid for all\nfrequencies and barrier amplitudes. At frequencies comparable to the bulk\nbandwidth we observe a breakdown of the transmission $T=0$ which is related to\nthe phenomenon of Fano resonances associated to AC-driven bound states in the\ncontinuum. We also demonstrate that the location and width of these resonances\ncan be modified by tuning the frequency and amplitude of the driving field. At\nhigh frequencies there is a close relation between the resonances and the\nphenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling. As the frequency is lowered no\nmore resonances are possible below a critical value and the results approach a\nsimple time average of the static transmission.\n", "  Here we discuss blackbody radiation within the context of classical theory.\nWe note that nonrelativistic classical mechanics and relativistic classical\nelectrodynamics have contrasting scaling symmetries which influence the\nscattering of radiation. Also, nonrelativistic mechanical systems can be\naccurately combined with relativistic electromagnetic radiation only provided\nthe nonrelativistic mechanical systems are the low-velocity limits of fully\nrelativistic systems. Application of the no-interaction theorem for\nrelativistic systems limits the scattering mechanical systems for thermal\nradiation to relativistic classical electrodynamic systems, which involve the\nCoulomb potential. Whereas the naive use of nonrelativistic scatterers or\nnonrelativistic classical statistical mechanics leads to the Rayleigh-Jeans\nspectrum, the use of fully relativistic scatterers leads to the Planck spectrum\nfor blackbody radiation within classical physics.\n", "  Ferrogels consist of magnetic colloidal particles embedded in an elastic\npolymer matrix. As a consequence, their structural and rheological properties\nare governed by a competition between magnetic particle-particle interactions\nand mechanical matrix elasticity. Typically, the particles are permanently\nfixed within the matrix, which makes them distinguishable by their positions.\nOver time, particle neighbors do not change due to the fixation by the matrix.\nHere we present a classical density functional approach for such ferrogels. We\nmap the elastic matrix-induced interactions between neighboring colloidal\nparticles distinguishable by their positions onto effective pairwise\ninteractions between indistinguishable particles similar to a \"pairwise\npseudopotential\". Using Monte-Carlo computer simulations, we demonstrate for\none-dimensional dipole-spring models of ferrogels that this mapping is\njustified. We then use the pseudopotential as an input into classical density\nfunctional theory of inhomogeneous fluids and predict the bulk elastic modulus\nof the ferrogel under various conditions. In addition, we propose the use of an\n\"external pseudopotential\" when one switches from the viewpoint of a\none-dimensional dipole-spring object to a one-dimensional chain embedded in an\ninfinitely extended bulk matrix. Our mapping approach paves the way to describe\nvarious inhomogeneous situations of ferrogels using classical density\nfunctional concepts of inhomogeneous fluids.\n", "  Three-body decay of charmed baryons $\\Lambda^*_c(2595)$ and\n$\\Lambda^*_c(2625)$ into $\\Lambda_c \\pi \\pi$ are studied with effective\nLagrangians in which the coupling constants are extracted from the\nnon-relativistic quark model. We take into account sequential processes going\nthrough $\\Sigma_c (2455)$ and $\\Sigma^*_c (2520)$ in intermediate states. The\ntotal decay widths are sensitive to the coupling of $\\Lambda^*_c$ with\n$\\Sigma_c \\pi$ open channel and to $\\Sigma^*_c \\pi$ closed channel. We find\nthat $\\Lambda_c^*(2595)$ and $\\Lambda_c^*(2625)$ with $\\lambda$ mode assignment\ncan explain nicely the experimental data. We also show invariant mass\ndistributions of $\\Lambda_c^*(2595)$ and $\\Lambda_c^*(2625)$ decays which are\nsignificantly different for various quark configurations.\n", "  We study the elliptic genera of two-dimensional orbifold CFTs, where the\norbifolding procedure introduces du Val surface singularities on the target\nspace. The N=4 character decompositions of the elliptic genus contributions\nfrom the twisted sectors at the singularities obey a consistent scaling\nproperty, and contain information about the arrangement of exceptional rational\ncurves in the resolution. We also discuss how these twisted sector elliptic\ngenera are related to twining genera and Hodge elliptic genera for sigma models\nwith K3 target space.\n", "  The region around the Galactic center (GC) is now well established to be\nbrighter at energies of a few GeV than expected from conventional models of\ndiffuse gamma-ray emission and catalogs of known gamma-ray sources. We study\nthe GeV excess using 6.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. We\ncharacterize the uncertainty of the GC excess spectrum and morphology due to\nuncertainties in cosmic-ray source distributions and propagation, uncertainties\nin the distribution of interstellar gas in the Milky Way, and uncertainties due\nto a potential contribution from the Fermi bubbles. We also evaluate\nuncertainties in the excess properties due to resolved point sources of gamma\nrays. The Galactic center is of particular interest as it would be expected to\nhave the brightest signal from annihilation of weakly interacting massive dark\nmatter particles. However, control regions along the Galactic plane, where a\ndark-matter signal is not expected, show excesses of similar amplitude relative\nto the local background. Based on the magnitude of the systematic\nuncertainties, we conservatively report upper limits for the annihilation cross\nsection as function of particle mass and annihilation channel.\n", "  We study quantum algorithms on search trees of unknown structure, in a model\nwhere the tree can be discovered by local exploration. That is, we are given\nthe root of the tree and access to a black box which, given a vertex $v$,\noutputs the children of $v$.\n  We construct a quantum algorithm which, given such access to a search tree of\ndepth at most $n$, estimates the size of the tree $T$ within a factor of $1\\pm\n\\delta$ in $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{nT})$ steps. More generally, the same algorithm can\nbe used to estimate size of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in a similar model.\n  We then show two applications of this result:\n  a) We show how to transform a classical backtracking search algorithm which\nexamines $T$ nodes of a search tree into an $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T}n^{3/2})$ time\nquantum algorithm, improving over an earlier quantum backtracking algorithm of\nMontanaro (arXiv:1509.02374).\n  b) We give a quantum algorithm for evaluating AND-OR formulas in a model\nwhere the formula can be discovered by local exploration (modeling position\ntrees in 2-player games). We show that, in this setting, formulas of size $T$\nand depth $T^{o(1)}$ can be evaluated in quantum time $O(T^{1/2+o(1)})$. Thus,\nthe quantum speedup is essentially the same as in the case when the formula is\nknown in advance.\n", "  To explore the static properties of the one-dimensional anyon-Hubbard model\nfor a mean density of one particle per site, we apply perturbation theory with\nrespect to the ratio between kinetic energy and interaction energy in the Mott\ninsulating phase. The strong-coupling results for the ground-state energy, the\nsingle-particle excitation energies, and the momentum distribution functions up\nto 6th order in hopping are benchmarked against the numerically exact\n(infinite) density-matrix renormalization group technique. Since these analytic\nexpressions are valid for any fractional phase $\\theta$ of anyons, they will be\nof great value for a sufficiently reliable analysis of future experiments,\navoiding extensive and costly numerical simulations.\n", "  We illustrate a counter-intuitive effect of an additive stochastic force,\nwhich acts independently on each element of an ensemble of globally coupled\noscillators. We show numerically and semi-analytically that a very small white\nnoise is able to stabilize an otherwise linearly unstable collective periodic\nregime. Microscopic simulations reveal two noise-induced bifurcations of\ndifferent nature towards self-consistent partial synchrony. We develop a\nmacroscopic treatment solving the corresponding nonlinear Fokker-Planck\nequation by means of a perturbative approach. The associated linear stability\nanalysis confirms the results anticipated by the numerics. We also argue about\nthe generality of the phenomenon.\n", "  We discuss possible vacuum structures of $SU(n)\\times SU(n)$ gauge theories\nwith bifundamental matters at finite $\\theta$ angles. In order to give a\nprecise constraint, a mixed 't Hooft anomaly is studied in detail by gauging\nthe center $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ one-form symmetry of the bifundamental gauge theory.\nWe propose phase diagrams that are consistent with the constraints, and also\ngive a heuristic explanation of the result based on the dual superconductor\nscenario of confinement.\n", "  We present experimental constraints on the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon\nelastic cross sections from the total 129.5 kg-year exposure acquired by the\nLarge Underground Xenon experiment (LUX), operating at the Sanford Underground\nResearch Facility in Lead, South Dakota (USA). A profile likelihood ratio\nanalysis allows 90% CL upper limits to be set on the WIMP-neutron (WIMP-proton)\ncross section of $\\sigma_n$ = 1.6$\\times 10^{-41}$ cm$^{2}$ ($\\sigma_p$ =\n5$\\times 10^{-40}$ cm$^{2}$) at 35 GeV$c^{-2}$, almost a sixfold improvement\nover the previous LUX spin-dependent results. The spin-dependent WIMP-neutron\nlimit is the most sensitive constraint to date.\n", "  We have performed magnetohydrodynamic simulations in general relativity of\nbinary neutron star and binary black hole-neutron star mergers, as well as the\nmagnetorotational collapse of supermassive stars. In many cases the outcome is\na spinnng black hole (BH) immersed in a magnetized disk, with a jet emanating\nfrom the poles of the BH. While their formation scenarios differ and their BH\nmasses, as well as their disk masses, densities, and magnetic field strengths,\nvary by orders of magnitude, these features conspire to generate jet Poynting\nluminosities that all lie in the same, narrow range of $\\sim 10^{52\\pm1}~{\\rm\nerg ~s^{-1}}$. A similar result applies to their BH accretion rates upon jet\nlaunch, which is $\\sim 0.1-10~{\\rm M_{\\odot}~s^{-1}}$. We provide a simple\nmodel that explains these unanticipated findings. Interestingly, these\nluminosities reside in the same narrow range characterizing the observed\nluminosity distributions of over 400 short and long GRBs with distances\ninferred from spectroscopic redshifts or host galaxies. This result, together\nwith the GRB lifetimes predicted by the model, supports the belief that a\ncompact binary merger is the progenitor of an SGRB, while a massive, stellar\nmagnetorotational collapse is the progenitor of an LGRB.\n", "  Recent experiments revealed that the plain $s$-wave state without any\nsign-reversal emerges in various metals near the magnetic criticality. To\nunderstand this counter-intuitive phenomenon, we study the gap equation for the\nmultiorbital Hubbard-Holstein model, by analyzing the vertex correction (VC)\ndue to the higher-order electron-correlation effects. We find that the\nphonon-mediated orbital fluctuations are magnified by the VC for the\nsusceptibility ($\\chi$-VC). In addition, the charge-channel attractive\ninteraction is enlarged by the VC for the coupling-constant ($U$-VC), which is\nsignificant when the interaction has prominent $q$-dependences so the Migdal\ntheorem fails. Due to both $\\chi$-VC and $U$-VC, the plain $s$-wave state is\ncaused by the small electron-phonon interaction near the magnetic criticality\nagainst the repulsive Coulomb interaction. We find that the direct Coulomb\nrepulsion for the plain $s$-wave Cooper pair is strongly reduced by the\n\"multiorbital screening effect\".\n", "  We present a combined observational and theoretical analysis to investigate\nthe nature of plasma turbulence at kinetic scales in the Earth's magnetosheath.\nIn the first decade of the kinetic range, just below the ion gyroscale, the\nturbulence was found to be similar to that in the upstream solar wind:\npredominantly anisotropic, low-frequency and kinetic Alfv\\'en in nature. A key\ndifference, however, is that the magnetosheath ions are typically much hotter\nthan the electrons, $T_\\mathrm{i}\\gg T_\\mathrm{e}$, which, together with\n$\\beta_\\mathrm{i}\\sim 1$, leads to a change in behaviour in the second decade,\nclose to electron scales. The turbulence here is characterised by an increased\nmagnetic compressibility, following a mode we term the inertial kinetic\nAlfv\\'en wave, and a steeper spectrum of magnetic fluctuations, consistent with\nthe prediction $E_B(k_\\perp)\\propto k_\\perp^{-11/3}$ that we obtain from a set\nof nonlinear equations. This regime of plasma turbulence may also be relevant\nfor other astrophysical environments with $T_\\mathrm{i}\\gg T_\\mathrm{e}$, such\nas the solar corona, hot accretion flows, and regions downstream of\ncollisionless shocks.\n", "  Two dimensional (2D) materials provide a unique platform for spintronics and\nvalleytronics due to the ability to combine vastly different functionalities\ninto one vertically-stacked heterostructure, where the strengths of each of the\nconstituent materials can compensate for the weaknesses of the others. Graphene\nhas been demonstrated to be an exceptional material for spin transport at room\ntemperature, however it lacks a coupling of the spin and optical degrees of\nfreedom. In contrast, spin/valley polarization can be efficiently generated in\nmonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) such as MoS2 via absorption of\ncircularly-polarized photons, but lateral spin or valley transport has not been\nrealized at room temperature. In this letter, we fabricate monolayer\nMoS2/few-layer graphene hybrid spin valves and demonstrate, for the first time,\nthe opto-valleytronic spin injection across a TMD/graphene interface. We\nobserve that the magnitude and direction of spin polarization is controlled by\nboth helicity and photon energy. In addition, Hanle spin precession\nmeasurements confirm optical spin injection, spin transport, and electrical\ndetection up to room temperature. Finally, analysis by a one-dimensional\ndrift-diffusion model quantifies the optically injected spin current and the\nspin transport parameters. Our results demonstrate a 2D spintronic/valleytronic\nsystem that achieves optical spin injection and lateral spin transport at room\ntemperature in a single device, which paves the way for multifunctional 2D\nspintronic devices for memory and logic applications.\n", "  In this work, we study the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology in which a\nChaplygin gas is coupled to a non-linear scalar field in the framework of the\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory. In writing the action of the matter part, we use\nthe Schutz's formalism so that the only degree of freedom of the Chaplygin gas\nplays the role of an evolutionary parameter. In a minisuperspace perspective,\nwe construct the Lagrangian for this model and show that in comparison with the\nusual Einstein-Hilbert gravity, there are some correction terms coming from the\nHo\\v{r}ava theory. In such a set-up and by using of some approximations the\nclassical dynamics of the model is investigated and some discussions about\ntheir possible singularities are presented. We then deal with the quantization\nof the model in the context of the Wheeler-DeWitt approach of quantum cosmology\nto find the cosmological wave function. We use the resulting wave functions to\ninvestigate the possibility of the avoidance of classical singularities due to\nquantum effects.\n", "  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle has recently led to general measurement\nuncertainty relations for quantum systems: incompatible observables can be\nmeasured jointly or in sequence only with some unavoidable approximation, which\ncan be quantified in various ways. The relative entropy is the natural\ntheoretical quantifier of the information loss when a `true' probability\ndistribution is replaced by an approximating one. In this paper, we provide a\nlower bound for the amount of information that is lost by replacing the\ndistributions of the sharp position and momentum observables, as they could be\nobtained with two separate experiments, by the marginals of any smeared joint\nmeasurement. The bound is obtained by introducing an entropic error function,\nand optimizing it over a suitable class of covariant approximate joint\nmeasurements. We fully exploit two cases of target observables: (1)\n$n$-dimensional position and momentum vectors; (2) two components of position\nand momentum along different directions. In (1), we connect the quantum bound\nto the dimension $n$; in (2), going from parallel to orthogonal directions, we\nshow the transition from highly incompatible observables to compatible ones.\nFor simplicity, we develop the theory only for Gaussian states and\nmeasurements.\n", "  We make the first measurement of the braking index $n$ of two putative\nmillisecond magnetars born in short gamma-ray bursts. We measure $n=2.9\\pm0.1$\nand $n=2.6\\pm0.1$ for millisecond magnetars born in GRB 130603B and GRB 140903A\nrespectively. The neutron star born in GRB 130603B has the only known braking\nindex consistent with the fiducial $n=3$ value. This value is ruled out with\n99.95\\% confidence for GRB 140903A. We discuss possible causes of $n<3$ braking\nindices in millisecond magnetars, showing that several models can account for\nthe measurement of the braking index in GRB 140903A, while it is more difficult\nto account for a braking index consistent with $n=3$.\n", "  By treating modulus and phase on equal footing, as prescribed by Dirac, local\nscale invariance can consistently accompany any Brans-Dicke $\\omega$-theory. We\nshow that in the presence of a soft scale symmetry breaking term, the classical\nsolution, if it exists, cannot be anything else but general relativistic. The\ndilaton modulus gets frozen up by the Weyl-Proca vector field, thereby\nconstituting a gravitational quasi-Higgs mechanism. Assigning all grand unified\nscalars as dilatons, they enjoy Weyl universality, and upon symmetry breaking,\nthe Planck (mass)$^2$ becomes the sum of all their individual (VEV)$^2$s. The\nemerging GUT/Planck (mass)$^2$ ratio is thus $\\sim \\omega g_{GUT}^2/4\\pi$.\n", "  The Szekeres metric is an inhomogeneous cosmological model without any\nsymmetries. The standard Riemann-type coordinates can be transformed into\nspherical-type coordinates, but the metric is no longer diagonal, and the\nconstant \"radius\" 2-spheres, 2-hyperboloids or 2-planes are known to be\n\"non-concentric\". Since the transformation into spherical-type coordinates is\n\"radius\" dependent, we question whether these coordinates have the same\norientation on each 2-surface. To answer this question, we set up an\northonormal tetrad (ONT), and investigate its variation. We find that a\nrelative rotation of the tetrad is generic, and it can increase systematically\nunder conditions that are not very restrictive. We search for paths along which\nthe tetrad is constant, and find they only exist under very restrictive\nconditions. In the process, we create a systematic method for defining an ONT\nwith chosen properties from a given metric.\n", "  The Georgi-Machacek (GM) model is one of many Beyond Standard Model scenarios\nwith an extended scalar sector which can group under the custodial $\\rm\nSU(2)_C$ symmetry into a fiveplet, a triplet, and two singlets. The heavy\ncharged custodial fiveplet Higgs $\\rm H_5^{\\pm}$ are typical particles in GM\nmodel which couple to the electroweak gauge bosons, therefore provide a good\ntesting ground for the detection of the $\\rm H^\\pm W^\\mp Z$ vertex. The neutral\ncustodial fiveplet Higgs $\\rm H_5^{0}$ in the GM model has the same mass with\n$\\rm H_5^{\\pm}$ and couples to the electroweak gauge bosons $\\rm W^+ W^-$ and\nZZ both. We study the discovery prospects of the exotic scalar bosons $\\rm\nH_5^{\\pm}$ and $\\rm H_5^{0}$ at the International Linear Collider(ILC) via the\nvector boson associated production processes, and discuss two different decay\nmodes for both charged and neutral scalars. The discovery potential is\ndiscussed. Testing the mass degeneracy of charged and neutral scalar bosons in\nthe GM model is also considered.\n", "  The operation of resistive and phase-change memory (RRAM and PCM) is\ncontrolled by highly localized self-heating effects, yet detailed studies of\ntheir temperature are rare due to challenges of nanoscale thermometry. Here we\nshow that the combination of Raman thermometry and scanning thermal microscopy\n(SThM) can enable such measurements with high spatial resolution. We report\ntemperature-dependent Raman spectra of HfO$_2$, TiO$_2$ and Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$\n(GST) films, and demonstrate direct measurements of temperature profiles in\nlateral PCM devices. Our measurements reveal that electrical and thermal\ninterfaces dominate the operation of such devices, uncovering a thermal\nboundary resistance of 30 m$^2$K$^{-1}$GW$^{-1}$ at GST-SiO$_2$ interfaces and\nan effective thermopower 350 $\\mu$V/K at GST-Pt interfaces. We also discuss\npossible pathways to apply Raman thermometry and SThM techniques to nanoscale\nand vertical resistive memory devices.\n", "  Maximum-entropy distributions are shown to appear in the probability calculus\nas approximations of a model by exchangeability or a model by sufficiency, the\nformer model being preferable. The implications of this fact are discussed,\ntogether with other questions: Prediction or retrodiction? How good is the\nmaximum-entropy approximation? Is this a \"derivation\" of maximum-entropy?\n", "  It is clearly demonstrated that numerical values of the $f^F, f^D$ and $f^S$\ncoupling constants in SU(3) invariant Lagrangian of the interaction of the\nvector-meson nonets with $1/2^+$ octet baryons do not depend on the chosen\nversion of the $\\omega-\\phi$ mixing.\n", "  The Auger effect from inner shells, which arises from resonance excitation of\nthe valence electron of an atom by a weak electromagnetic wave, is discussed.\n", "  A review of the replica symmetric solution of the classical and quantum,\ninfinite-range, Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass is presented.\n", "  Starting from covariant expressions, a gauge independent separation of\norbital and spin angular momentum for electrodynamics is presented. This\nresults from the non-symmetric canonical energy momentum tensor of the\nelectromagnetic field. The origin of the difficulty is discussed and a\ncovariant gauge invariant spin vector is derived. The paradox concerning the\nspin angular momentum of a plane wave finds a natural solution.\n", "  Regular intrinsic brightness variations observed in many stars are caused by\npulsations. These pulsations provide information on the global and structural\nparameters of the star. The pulsation periods range from seconds to years,\ndepending on the compactness of the star and properties of the matter that\nforms its outer layers. Here, we report the discovery of more than a dozen of\npreviously unknown short-period variable stars: blue large-amplitude pulsators.\nThese objects show very regular brightness variations with periods in the range\nof 20-40 min and amplitudes of 0.2-0.4 mag in the optical passbands. The phased\nlight curves have a characteristic sawtooth shape, similar to the shape of\nclassical Cepheids and RR Lyrae-type stars pulsating in the fundamental mode.\nThe objects are significantly bluer than main sequence stars observed in the\nsame fields, which indicates that all of them are hot stars. Follow-up\nspectroscopy confirms a high surface temperature of about 30,000 K. Temperature\nand colour changes over the cycle prove the pulsational nature of the\nvariables. However, large-amplitude pulsations at such short periods are not\nobserved in any known type of stars, including hot objects. Long-term\nphotometric observations show that the variable stars are very stable over\ntime. Derived rates of period change are of the order of 10^-7 per year and, in\nmost cases, they are positive. According to pulsation theory, such\nlarge-amplitude oscillations may occur in evolved low-mass stars that have\ninflated helium-enriched envelopes. The evolutionary path that could lead to\nsuch stellar configurations remains unknown.\n", "  Knowing the structure of an offline social network facilitates a variety of\nanalyses, including studying the rate at which infectious diseases may spread\nand identifying a subset of actors to immunize in order to reduce, as much as\npossible, the rate of spread. Offline social network topologies are typically\nestimated by surveying actors and asking them to list their neighbours. While\nidentifying close friends and family (i.e., strong ties) can typically be done\nreliably, listing all of one's acquaintances (i.e., weak ties) is subject to\nerror due to respondent fatigue. This issue is commonly circumvented through\nthe use of so-called \"fixed choice\" surveys where respondents are asked to name\na fixed, small number of their weak ties (e.g., two or ten). Of course, the\nresulting crude observed network will omit many ties, and using this crude\nnetwork to infer properties of the network, such as its degree distribution or\nclustering coefficient, will lead to biased estimates. This paper develops\nestimators, based on the method of moments, for a number of network\ncharacteristics including those related to the first and second moments of the\ndegree distribution as well as the network size, using fixed-choice survey\ndata. Experiments with simulated data illustrate that the proposed estimators\nperform well across a variety of network topologies and measurement scenarios,\nand the resulting estimates are significantly more accurate than those obtained\ndirectly using the crude observed network, which are commonly used in the\nliterature. We also describe a variation of the Jackknife procedure that can be\nused to obtain an estimate of the estimator variance.\n", "  We show that dispersive propagation of light followed by phase detection has\nproperties that can be exploited for extracting features from the waveforms.\nThis discovery is spearheading development of a new class of physics-inspired\nalgorithms for feature extraction from digital images with unique properties\nand superior dynamic range compared to conventional algorithms. In certain\ncases, these algorithms have the potential to be an energy efficient and\nscalable substitute to synthetically fashioned computational techniques in\npractice today.\n", "  Beyond the attractive strong potential needed for hadronic bound states,\nstrong interactions are predicted to provide repulsive forces depending on the\ncolor charges involved. The repulsive interactions could in principle serve for\nparticle acceleration with highest gradients in the order of GeV/fm. Indirect\nevidence for repulsive interactions have been reported in the context of heavy\nmeson production at colliders. In this contribution, we sketch a thought\nexperiment to directly investigate repulsive strong interactions. For this we\nprepare two quarks using two simultaneous deep inelastic scattering processes\noff an iron target. We discuss the principle setup of the experiment and\nestimate the number of electrons on target required to observe a repulsive\neffect between the quarks.\n", "  The stacking problem is approached by computational mechanics, using an Ising\nnext nearest neighbor model. Computational mechanics allows to treat the\nstacking arrangement as an information processing system in the light of a\nsymbol generating process. A general method for solving the stochastic matrix\nof the random Gibbs field is presented, and then applied to the problem at\nhand. The corresponding phase diagram is then discussed in terms of the\nunderlying $\\epsilon$-machine, or optimal finite state machine, describing\nstatistically the system. The occurrence of higher order polytypes at the\nborders of the phase diagram is also analyzed. Discussion of the applicability\nof the model to real system such as ZnS and Cobalt is done. The method derived\nis directly generalizable to any one dimensional model with finite range\ninteraction.\n", "  In this paper, we report the development of an intensity modulated fiber\noptic sensor for angular displacement measurement. This sensor was designed to\npresent high sensitivity, linear response, wide bandwidth and, furthermore, to\nbe simple and low cost. The sensor comprises two optical fibers, a positive\nlens, a reflective surface, an optical source, and a photodetector. A\nmathematical model was developed to determine and simulate the static\ncharacteristic curve of the sensor and to compare different sensor\nconfigurations regarding the core radii of the optical fibers. The simulation\nresults showed that the sensor configurations tested are highly sensitive to\nsmall angle variation (in the range of microradians) with nonlinearity less\nthan or equal to 1\\%. The normalized sensitivity ranges from $(0.25\\times\nV_{\\rm max})$ to $(2.40\\times V_{\\rm max})$ mV/$\\mu$rad (where $V_{\\rm max}$ is\nthe peak voltage of the static characteristic curve) and the linear range, from\n194 to 1840 $\\mu$rad. The unnormalized sensitivity for a reflective surface\nwith reflectivity of 100\\% was measured as 7.7 mV/$\\mu$rad. The simulations\nwere compared with experimental results to validate the mathematical model and\nto define the most suitable configuration for ultrasonic detection. The sensor\nwas tested on the characterization of a piezoelectric transducer and as part of\na laser ultrasonics setup. The velocity of the longitudinal, shear, and surface\nwaves were measured on aluminum samples as 6.43 mm/$\\mu$s, 3.17 mm/$\\mu$s, 2.96\nmm/$\\mu$s, respectively, with an error smaller than 1.3\\%. The sensor proved to\nbe suitable to detect ultrasonic waves and to perform time-of-flight\nmeasurements and nondestructive inspection, being an alternative to the\npiezoelectric or the interferometric detectors.\n", "  Numerical studies of the coupled Einstein-Klein-Gordon system have recently\nrevealed that confined scalar fields generically collapse to form caged black\nholes. In the light of this finding, we analytically study the characteristic\nresonance spectra of the confined scalar fields in rotating linear dilaton\nblack hole geometry. Confining mirrors (cage) are assumed to be placed in the\nnear-horizon region of a caged rotating linear dilaton black hole\n$\\frac{r_{m}-r_{2}}{r_{2}}\\ll 1$ ($r_{m}$ is the radius of the cage and $r_{2}$\nrepresents the event horizon). The radial part of the Klein-Gordon equation is\nwritten as a Schr\\\"{o}dinger-like wave equation, which reduces to a Bessel\ndifferential equation around the event horizon. Using analytical tools and\nproper boundary conditions, we obtain the boxed-quasinormal mode frequencies of\nthe caged rotating linear dilaton black hole. Finally, we employ Maggiore's\nmethod, which evaluates the transition frequency in the adiabatic invariant\nquantity from the highly damped quasinormal modes, in order to investigate the\nentropy/area spectra of the rotating linear dilaton black hole.\n", "  A scanning tunneling microscopy based potentiometry technique for the\nmeasurements of the local surface electric potential is presented and\nillustrated by experiments performed on current-carrying thin tungsten films.\nThe obtained results demonstrate a sub-millivolt resolution in the measured\nsurface potential. The application of this potentiometry technique to the local\nsensing of the spin Hall effect is outlined and some experimental results are\nreported.\n", "  Dynamical structural defects exist naturally in a wide variety of solids.\nThey fluctuate temporally, and hence can deteriorate the performance of many\nelectronic devices. Thus far, the entities of such dynamic objects have been\nidentified to be individual atoms. On the other hand, it is a long-standing\nquestion whether a nanocrystalline grain constituted of a large number of atoms\ncan switch, as a whole, reversibly like a dynamical atomic defect (i.e., a\ntwo-level system). This is an emergent issue considering the current\ndevelopment of nanodevices with ultralow electrical noise, qubits with long\nquantum coherence time, and nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) sensors with\nultrahigh resolution. Here we demonstrate experimental observations of dynamic\nnanocrystalline grains which repeatedly switch between two or more metastable\ncoordinate states. We study temporal resistance fluctuations in thin ruthenium\ndioxide (RuO2) metal nanowires and extract microscopic parameters including\nrelaxation time scales, mobile grain sizes, and the bonding strengths of\nnanograin boundaries. Such material parameters are not obtainable by other\nexperimental approaches. When combined with previous in-situ high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), our electrical method can be used to\ninfer rich information about the structural dynamics of a wide variety of\nnanodevices and new 2D materials.\n", "  We have searched for optical identifications for 39 Chandra X-ray sources\nthat lie within the 1.9 arcmin half-mass radius of the nearby (d = 4.0 kpc),\ncore-collapsed globular cluster, NGC 6752, using deep Hubble Space Telescope\nACS/WFC imaging in B435, R625, and H alpha. Photometry of these images allows\nus to classify candidate counterparts based primarily on color-magnitude and\ncolor-color diagram location. The color-color diagram is particularly useful\nfor quantifying the H alpha line equivalent width. In addition to recovering 11\npreviously detected optical counterparts, we propose 20 new optical IDs. In\ntotal, there are 16 likely or less certain cataclysmic variables (CVs), nine\nlikely or less certain chromospherically active binaries, three galaxies, and\nthree active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The latter three sources, which had been\nidentified as likely CVs by previous investigations, now appear to be\nextragalactic objects based on their proper motions. As we previously found for\nNGC 6397, the CV candidates in NGC 6752 fall into a bright group that is\ncentrally concentrated relative to the turnoff-mass stars and a faint group\nthat has a spatial distribution that is more similar to that of the\nturnoff-mass stars. This is consistent with an evolutionary scenario in which\nCVs are produced by dynamical interactions near the cluster center and diffuse\nto larger radius orbits as they age.\n", "  Reservoir Computing (RC) refers to a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\nframework, frequently used for sequence learning and time series prediction.\nThe RC system consists of a random fixed-weight RNN (the input-hidden reservoir\nlayer) and a classifier (the hidden-output readout layer). Here we focus on the\nsequence learning problem, and we explore a different approach to RC. More\nspecifically, we remove the non-linear neural activation function, and we\nconsider an orthogonal reservoir acting on normalized states on the unit\nhypersphere. Surprisingly, our numerical results show that the system's memory\ncapacity exceeds the dimensionality of the reservoir, which is the upper bound\nfor the typical RC approach based on Echo State Networks (ESNs). We also show\nhow the proposed system can be applied to symmetric cryptography problems, and\nwe include a numerical implementation.\n", "  Solving the atomic structure of metallic clusters is fundamental to\nunderstanding their optical, electronic, and chemical properties. We report the\nstructure of Au$_{\\text{146}}$(p-MBA)$_{\\text{57}}$ at subatomic resolution\n(0.85 {\\AA}) using electron diffraction (MicroED) and atomic resolution by\nX-ray diffraction. The 146 gold atoms may be decomposed into two constituent\nsets consisting of 119 core and 27 peripheral atoms. The core atoms are\norganized in a twinned FCC structure whereas the surface gold atoms follow a\nC$_{2}$ rotational symmetry about an axis bisecting the twinning plane. The\nprotective layer of 57 p-MBAs fully encloses the cluster and comprises\nbridging, monomeric, and dimeric staple motifs.\nAu$_{\\text{146}}$(p-MBA)$_{\\text{57}}$ is the largest cluster observed\nexhibiting a bulk-like FCC structure as well as the smallest gold particle\nexhibiting a stacking fault.\n", "  I consider a single-level quantum dot coupled to two reservoirs of spin waves\n(magnons). Such systems have been studied recently from the point of view of\npossible coupling between electronic and magnonic spin currents. However,\nusually weakly coupled systems were investigated. When coupling between the dot\nand reservoirs is not weak, then higher order processes play a role and have to\nbe included. Here I consider cotunneling of magnons through a spin-occupied\nquantum dot, which can be understood as a magnon (spin) leakage current in\nanalogy to leakage currents in charge-based electronics. Particular emphasis\nhas been put on investigating the effect of magnetic field and temperature\ndifference between the magnonic reservoirs.\n", "  The committee for the study of the extension of the Hadron Experimental\nFacility was formed under the Hadron Hall Users' Association in August, 2015.\nThis document is a summary of the discussions among the committee members, and\ndocumented by a part of the members listed below.\n", "  We demonstrate the first achievement of continuous-wave (CW) pumped second\nharmonic generation (SHG) in few- and mono-layer gallium selenide (GaSe)\nflakes, which are coated on silicon photonic crystal (PC) cavities. Because of\nultrahigh second order nonlinearity of the two-dimensional (2D) GaSe and\nlocalized resonant mode in the PC cavity, SHG's pump power is greatly reduced\nto microwatts. In a nine-layer GaSe coated PC cavity, while the optical power\ninside the GaSe flake is only 1.5 percent of that in the silicon PC slab, the\nSHG in GaSe is more than 650 times stronger than the third harmonic generation\nin silicon slab, indicating 2D GaSe's great potentials to strengthen nonlinear\nprocesses in silicon photonics. Our study opens up a new view to expand 2D\nmaterials' optoelectronic applications in nonlinear regime and chip-integrated\nactive devices.\n", "  The OPERA experiment was designed to search for $\\nu_{\\mu} \\rightarrow\n\\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillations in appearance mode through the direct observation of\ntau neutrinos in the CNGS neutrino beam. In this paper, we report a study of\nthe multiplicity of charged particles produced in charged-current neutrino\ninteractions in lead. We present charged hadron average multiplicities, their\ndispersion and investigate the KNO scaling in different kinematical regions.\nThe results are presented in detail in the form of tables that can be used in\nthe validation of Monte Carlo generators of neutrino-lead interactions.\n", "  The measurement of the production of single muons from heavy-flavour hadron\ndecays at forward rapidity in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} =\n5.02~{\\rm TeV}$ collected in 2015 is presented as a function of transverse\nmomentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) and collision centrality. A strong suppression of the\nyield is observed at high $p_{\\rm T}$ in the most central collisions compared\nto the binary-scaled expectation from pp collisions at the same energy. The\n$p_{\\rm T}$-integrated nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) as function\nof the number of participating nucleons indicates an increase of the\nsuppression from peripheral to central collisions. Comparisons with the results\nfor Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76~{\\rm TeV}$ and with\ntransport model predictions are shown. A similar suppression is measured at\nboth $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76~{\\rm TeV}$ and 5.02 TeV. The results available\nfrom $p_{\\rm T} =$7 GeV/$c$ up to $p_{\\rm T} =~$20 GeV/$c$, will provide new\nconstraints on transport model ingredients and new insights on the\nunderstanding of the evolution of the hot and dense matter formed in\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  To pursuit high electrochemical performance of supercapacitors based on\nFaradaic charge-transfer with redox reaction or absorption/desorption effect,\nthe intercalation efficiency of electrolyte ions into electrode materials is a\ncrucial prerequisite to surpass the pure surface capacity with extra bulk\ncontribution. Here we report layered barium transition metal fluorides, BaMF4\n(M = Mn, Co, Ni) to be a series of new electrode materials applied in standard\nthree-electrode configuration. Benefiting from the efficient immersing of\nelectrolyte ions, these materials own prominent specific capacitance.\nElectrochemical characterizations demonstrate that all the BaMF4 electrodes\nshow both capacitive behavior and Faradaic redox reactions in the cyclic\nvoltammograms, and ability of charge storage by charging-discharging cycling\nwith high cycling stability. Particularly, BaCoF4 shows the the highest\nspecific capacitance of 360 F g-1 at current density of 0.6 A g-1, even the\nparticle size is far beyond nanometer scale. In addition, first principles\ncalculations reveal the possible underlying mechanisms.\n", "  In this paper high resolution wave probe records are examined using wavelet\ntechniques with a view to determining the sources and relative contributions of\ncapillary wave energy along representative wind wave forms. Wavelets enable\ncomputations of conditional spectra and turn out to be powerful tools for the\nstudy of the development and propagation of capillary waves. They also enable\nthe detailed analyses of the relative contributions to the spectrum of the wave\npeaks and troughs.\n", "  A new method is proposed to generate nonlinear integrable systems by starting\nwith existing Lax pair and a new form of Kr\\\"onecker product. It is observed\nthat such equation can be generated with the help of a Hamiltonian structure.\nActually they are all bi-Hamiltonian. A few explicit form of such equations are\ngiven also\n", "  The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) that emerges under broken\ntime-reversal symmetry in topological insulators (TI) exhibits many fascinating\nphysical properties for potential applications in nano-electronics and\nspintronics. However, in transition-metal doped TI, the only experimentally\ndemonstrated QAHE system to date, the effect is lost at practically relevant\ntemperatures. This constraint is imposed by the relatively low Curie\ntemperature (Tc) and inherent spin disorder associated with the random magnetic\ndopants. Here we demonstrate drastically enhanced Tc by exchange coupling TI to\nTm3Fe5O12, a high-Tc magnetic insulator with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.\nSignatures that the TI surface states acquire robust ferromagnetism are\nrevealed by distinct squared anomalous Hall hysteresis loops at 400 K.\nPoint-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy confirms that the TI surface is\nindeed spin-polarized. The greatly enhanced Tc, absence of spin disorder, and\nperpendicular anisotropy are all essential to the occurrence of the QAHE at\nhigh temperatures.\n", "  Most information spreading models consider that all individuals are identical\npsychologically. They ignore, for instance, the curiosity level of people,\nwhich may indicate that they can be influenced to seek for information given\ntheir interest. For example, the game Pok\\'emon GO spread rapidly because of\nthe aroused curiosity among users. This paper proposes an information\npropagation model considering the curiosity level of each individual, which is\na dynamical parameter that evolves over time. We evaluate the efficiency of our\nmodel in contrast to traditional information propagation models, like SIR or\nIC, and perform analysis on different types of artificial and real-world\nnetworks, like Google+, Facebook, and the United States roads map. We present a\nmean-field approach that reproduces with a good accuracy the evolution of\nmacroscopic quantities, such as the density of stiflers, for the system's\nbehavior with the curiosity. We also obtain an analytical solution of the\nmean-field equations that allows to predicts a transition from a phase where\nthe information remains confined to a small number of users to a phase where it\nspreads over a large fraction of the population. The results indicate that the\ncuriosity increases the information spreading in all networks as compared with\nthe spreading without curiosity, and that this increase is larger in spatial\nnetworks than in social networks. When the curiosity is taken into account, the\nmaximum number of informed individuals is reached close to the transition\npoint. Since curious people are more open to a new product, concepts, and\nideas, this is an important factor to be considered in propagation modeling.\nOur results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between diffusion\nprocess and dynamical heterogeneous transmission in social networks.\n", "  We study exciton-plasmon coupling in two-dimensional semiconductors coupled\nwith Ag plasmonic lattices via angle-resolved reflectance spectroscopy and by\nsolving the equations of motion (EOMs) in a coupled oscillator model accounting\nfor all the resonances of the system. Five resonances are considered in the EOM\nmodel: semiconductor A and B excitons, localized surface plasmon resonances\n(LSPRs) of plasmonic nanostructures and the lattice diffraction modes of the\nplasmonic array. We investigated the exciton-plasmon coupling in different 2D\nsemiconductors and plasmonic lattice geometries, including monolayer MoS2 and\nWS2 coupled with Ag nanodisk and bowtie arrays, and examined the dispersion and\nlineshape evolution in the coupled systems via the EOM model with different\nexciton-plasmon coupling parameters. The EOM approach provides a unified\ndescription of the exciton-plasmon interaction in the weak, intermediate and\nstrong coupling cases with correctly explaining the dispersion and lineshapes\nof the complex system. This study provides a much deeper understanding of\nlight-matter interactions in multilevel systems in general and will be useful\nto instruct the design of novel two-dimensional exciton-plasmonic devices for a\nvariety of optoelectronic applications with precisely tailored responses.\n", "  We study the effect of asperity size on the adhesion properties of metal\ncontact using atomistic simulations. The simulated size effect of individual\nnanoscale asperityies is applied to macroscopic rough surfaces by introducing a\ncurvature radius distribution to a continuum-mechanics-based contact model. Our\nresults indicate that the contact adhesion can be optimized by changing the\ncurvature radius distribution of the asperity summits.\n", "  In models of anapole dark matter (DM), the DM candidate is a Majorana fermion\nwhose primary interaction with standard model (SM) particles is through an\nanapole coupling to off-shell photons. As such, at tree-level, anapole DM\nundergoes p-wave annihilation into SM charged fermions via a virtual photon.\nBut, generally, Majorana fermions are polarizable, coupling to two real\nphotons. This fact admits the possibility that anapole DM can annihilate into\ntwo photons in an s-wave process. Using an explicit model, we compute both the\ntree-level and diphoton contributions to the anapole DM annihilation cross\nsection. Depending on model parameters, the s-wave process can either rival or\nbe dwarfed by the p-wave contribution to the total annihilation cross section.\nSubjecting the model to astrophysical upper bounds on the s-wave annihilation\nmode, we rule out the model with large s-wave annihilation.\n", "  We demonstrate gate-tunable resonant tunneling and negative differential\nresistance between two rotationally aligned bilayer graphene sheets separated\nby bilayer WSe2. We observe large interlayer current densities of 2 uA/um2 and\n2.5 uA/um2, and peak-to-valley ratios approaching 4 and 6 at room temperature\nand 1.5 K, respectively, values that are comparable to epitaxially grown\nresonant tunneling heterostructures. An excellent agreement between theoretical\ncalculations using a Lorentzian spectral function for the two-dimensional (2D)\nquasiparticle states, and the experimental data indicates that the interlayer\ncurrent stems primarily from energy and in-plane momentum conserving 2D-2D\ntunneling, with minimal contributions from inelastic or non-momentum-conserving\ntunneling. We demonstrate narrow tunneling resonances with intrinsic\nhalf-widths of 4 and 6 meV at 1.5 K and 300 K, respectively.\n", "  We study a complex Ginzburg-Landau (GL) type model related to fluid\ninstabilities in the boundary of magnetized toroidal plasmas (called\nedge-localized modes) with a prescribed shear flow on the Neumann boundary\ncondition. We obtain the following universal results for the model in a\none-dimensional interval. First, if the shear is weak, there is a unique\nlinearly stable steady-state perturbed from the nonzero constant steady-state\ncorresponding to the zero shear case. Second, if the shear is strong, there is\nno plausible steady-state except the trivial zero solution in the interval.\nWith the help of these results and the existence of global attractors, we can\ndramatically reduce the number of cases for the long-time behavior of a\nsolution in the model.\n", "  We report optical enhancement in polarization and dielectric constant near\nroom temperature in Pb0.6Li0.2Bi0.2Zr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PLBZT) electro-ceramics; these\nare doubly substituted members of the most important commercial ferroelectric\nPbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT:20/80). Partial (40%) substitution of equal amounts of Li+1\nand Bi+3 in PZT: 20/80 retains the PZT tetragonal structure with space group\nP4mm. Under illumination of white light and weak 405-nm near-ultraviolet laser\nlight (30 mW), an unexpectedly large (200-300%) change in polarization and\ndisplacement current was observed. Light also changes the dc conduction current\ndensity by one to two orders of magnitude with a large switchable open circuit\nvoltage (Voc ~ 2 V) and short circuit current (Jsc ~ 5x10-8 A). The samples\nshow a photo-current ON/OFF ratio of order 6:1 under illumination of weak\nlight.\n", "  Quantum state preparation plays an equally important role with quantum\noperations and measurements in quantum information processing. The previous\nmethods of preparing initial state for bulk quantum computation all have\ninevitable disadvantages, such as, requiring multiple experiments, causing loss\nof signals, or requiring molecules with restrictive structure. In this work,\nthree kinds of quantum circuits are introduced to prepare the pseudo-pure\nstates of ($n-1$) qubits in the Hilbert space of $n$ coupled spins which merely\nneed the assist of one ancilla spin and two experiments independent of $n$.\nBeing without gradient fields effectively avoids the reduction of the signals.\nOur methods have no special requirements on the structure of the used\nmolecules. To test these methods more comprehensively, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the preparation of the labeled pseudo-pure states using\nheteronuclear 2-qubit and homonuclear 4-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance\nquantum information processor.\n", "  In previous implementations of adiabatic quantum algorithms using spin\nsystems, the average Hamiltonian method with Trotter's formula was\nconventionally adopted to generate an effective instantaneous Hamiltonian that\nsimulates an adiabatic passage. However, this approach had issues with the\nprecision of the effective Hamiltonian and with the adiabaticity of the\nevolution. In order to address these, we here propose and experimentally\ndemonstrate a novel scheme for adiabatic quantum computation by using the\nintrinsic Hamiltonian of a realistic spin system to represent the problem\nHamiltonian while adiabatically driving the system by an extrinsic Hamiltonian\ndirectly induced by electromagnetic pulses. In comparison to the conventional\nmethod, we observed two advantages of our approach: improved ease of\nimplementation and higher fidelity. As a showcase example of our approach, we\nexperimentally factor 291311, which is larger than any other quantum\nfactorization known.\n", "  In this chapter we review the field of radio-frequency dressed atom trapping.\nWe emphasise the role of adiabatic potentials and give simple, but generic\nmodels of electromagnetic fields that currently produce traps for atoms at\nmicrokelvin temperatures and below. The paper aims to be didactic and starts\nwith general descriptions of the essential ingredients of adiabaticity and\nmagnetic resonance. As examples of adiabatic potentials we pay attention to\nradio-frequency dressing in both the quadrupole trap and the Ioffe-Pritchard\ntrap. We include a description of the effect of different choices of\nradio-frequency polarisation and orientations or alignment. We describe how the\nadiabatic potentials, formed from radio-frequency fields, can themselves be\nprobed and manipulated with additional radio-frequency fields including\nmulti-photon-effects. We include a description of time-averaged adiabatic\npotentials. Practical issues for the construction of radio-frequency adiabatic\npotentials are addressed including noise, harmonics, and beyond rotating wave\napproximation effects.\n", "  Herein, we elucidate the impact of tubular confinement on the structure and\nrelaxation behaviour of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) and how these affect\nthe para-/ferroelectric behavior of this polymer. We use PVDF nanotubes that\nwere solidified in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates. Dielectric\nspectroscopy measurements evidence a bimodal relaxation process for PVDF\nnanotubes: besides the bulk-like -relaxation, we detect a notably slower\nrelaxation that is associated with the PVDF regions of restricted dynamics at\nthe interface with the AAO pore. Strickingly, both the bulk-like and the\ninterfacial relaxation tend to become temperature independent as the\ntemperature increases - a behavior that has been observed before in inorganic\nrelaxor ferroelectrics. In line with this, we observe that the real part of the\ndielectric permittivity of the PVDF nanotubes exhibits a broad maximum when\nplotted against the temperature, which is, again, a typical feature of relaxor\nferroelectrics. As such, we propose that in nanotubular PVDF,\nferroelectric-like nanodomains are formed in the amorphous phase regions\nadjacent to the AAO interface. These ferroelectric nanodomains may result from\nan anisotropic chain conformation and a preferred orientation of local dipoles\ndue to selective H-bond formation between the PVDF macromolecues and the AAO\nwalls. Such relaxor-ferroelectric-like behaviour has not been observed for\nnon-irradiated PVDF homopolymer; our findings thus may enable in the future\nalternative applications for this bulk commodity plastic, e.g., for the\nproduction of electrocaloric devices for solid-state refrigeration which\nbenefit from a relaxor-ferroelectric-like response.\n", "  Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) has long been regarded as an ideal\npiezoelectric plastic because it exhibits a large piezoelectric response and a\nhigh thermal stability. However, the realization of piezoelectric PVDF elements\nhas proven to be problematic, amongst others, due to the lack of\nindustrially-scalable methods to process PVDF into the appropriate polar\ncrystalline forms. Here, we show that fully piezoelectric PVDF films can be\nproduced via a single-step process that exploits the fact that PVDF can be\nmolded at temperatures below its melting temperature, i.e. via\nsolid-state-processing. We demonstrate that we thereby produce d_PVDF, the\npiezoelectric charge coefficient of which is comparable to that of biaxially\nstretched d_PVDF. We expect that the simplicity and scalability of solid-state\nprocessing combined with the excellent piezoelectric properties of our PVDF\nstructures will provide new opportunities for this commodity polymer and will\nopen a range of possibilities for future, large-scale, industrial production of\nplastic piezoelectric films\n", "  Polymers with the same chemical composition can provide different properties\nby reducing the dimension or simply by altering their nanostructure. Recent\nliterature works report hundreds of examples of advances methods in the\nfabrication of polymer nanostructures accomplished following different\napproaches, soft lithography, self-assembly routes, template assisted methods,\netc. Polymer nanostructures with modulated morphologies and properties can be\neasily achieved from anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) templates assisted methods.\nIn the last decade, fabrication of polymer nanostructures in the nanocavities\nof AAO has raised a great interest since allows the control and tailoring of\ndimension of a huge number of polymer and polymer-based composites materials.\nThe fact that polymer dimension can be adjusted allow the study of\nsize-dependency properties. Moreover, modulated polymer nanostructures can be\ndesigned for specific applications from AAO templates methods. Taking into\naccount the last considerations, this review present an overview of recent and\nnew insights in the fabrication methods of polymer nanostructures from hard\nporous Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) templates with emphasis on the study of\npolymer structure/property relationship at nanometric scale and stressing the\npotential interest in particular applications.\n", "  The effect of interfaces and confinement in polymer ferroelectric structured\nis discussed. Results on confinement under different geometries are presented\nand the comparison of all of them allows to evidence that the presence of an\ninterface in particular cases stabilizes a ferroelectric phase that is not\nspontaneously formed under normal bulk processing conditions\n", "  An oligomeric semiconductor containing three bisthiophenediketopyrrolopyrole\nunits (Tri-BTDPP) was synthesized and characterized. Tri-BTDPP has a HOMO level\nof -5.34 eV, a broad absorption close to the near infrared region and a low\nband gap of 1.33 eV. Additionally, a promising hole mobility of 1 x 10-3 cm V-1\ns-1 was achieved after thermal annealing at 150 C in organic field effect\ntransistors (OFET). Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells containing Tri-BTDPP and\nPC71BM as the donor/acceptor couple exhibited a power conversion efficiency\n(PCE) of 0.72%. Through an intensive study of the active layer using AFM, XRD,\nand DSC, it was found that Tri-BTDPP and PC71BM were unable to intermix\neffectively, resulting in oversized Tri-BTDPP crystalline phases and thus poor\ncharge separation. Strategies to improve the OPV performance were thus\nproposed.\n", "  A series of donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) structured small-molecule compounds,\nwith 3,3'-(ethane-1,2-diylidene)bis(indolin-2-one) (EBI) as a novel electron\nacceptor building block coupled with various electron donor end-capping\nmoieties (thiophene, bithiophene and benzofuran), were synthesized and\ncharacterized. When the fused-ring benzofuran is combined to EBI (EBI-BF), the\nmolecules displayed a perfectly planar conformation and afforded the best\ncharge tranport properties among these EBI compounds with a hole mobility of up\nto 0.021 cm2 V-1 s-1. All EBI-based small molecules were used as donor material\nalong with a PC61BM acceptor for the fabrication of solution-processed\nbulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The best performing photovoltaic devices\nare based on the EBI derivative using the bithiophene end-capping moiety\n(EBI-2T) with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.92%, owing to\nthe broad absorption spectra of EBI-2T and the appropriate morphology of the\nBHJ. With the aim of establishing a correlation between the molecular structure\nand the thin film morphology, differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force\nmicroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis were performed on neat and blend\nfilms of each material.\n", "  Solitons in nonlinear optics holds a special role both in theoretical and\nexperimental studies. Several types of evolution equations are seen to govern\ndifferent situation of physical relevance. One such is the existence of both\nresonant and nonresonant situation in optical fibre. The corresponding\nevolution equation was devised by Doktorov et. al., which consists of a forced\nNLS equation along with two other equations for population difference and\npolarization. Here, we have followed an earlier formulation of Neugebauer for\nDarboux-B\\\"acklund transformation for this coupled systems. This formalism has\nthe advantage that one can write the N-soliton solution altogether.An important\ndifference with the usual non-linear system is that all the field variables are\nnot present in both part of Lax operator. So we are to apply the DT to both\npart separately.\n", "  Typical device architectures in polymer-based optoelectronic devices, such as\nfield effect transistors organic light emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells\ninclude sub-100 nm semiconducting polymer thin-film active layers, whose\nmicrostructure is likely to be subject to finite-size effects. The aim of this\nstudy was to investigate effect of the two-dimensional spatial confinement on\nthe internal structure of the semiconducting polymer poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene)\n(PFO). PFO melts were confined inside the cylindrical nanopores of anodic\naluminium oxide (AAO) templates and crystallized via two crystallization\nstrategies, namely, in the presence or in the absence of a surface bulk\nreservoir located at the template surface. We show that highly textured\nsemiconducting nanowires with tuneable crystal orientation can be thus\nproduced. Moreover, our results indicate that employing the appropriate\ncrystallization conditions extended-chain crystals can be formed in\nconfinement. The results presented here demonstrate the simple fabrication and\ncrystal engineering of ordered arrays of PFO nanowires; a system with potential\napplications in devices where anisotropic optical properties are required, such\nas polarized electroluminescence, waveguiding, optical switching, lasing, etc.\n", "  The study of quantum channels is the fundamental field and promises wide\nrange of applications, because any physical process can be represented as a\nquantum channel transforming an initial state into a final state. Inspired by\nthe method performing non-unitary operator by the linear combination of unitary\noperations, we proposed a quantum algorithm for the simulation of universal\nsingle-qubit channel, described by a convex combination of 'quasiextreme'\nchannels corresponding to four Kraus operators, and is scalable to arbitrary\nhigher dimension. We demonstrate the whole algorithm experimentally using the\nuniversal IBM cloud quantum computer and study properties of different qubit\nquantum channels. We illustrate the quantum capacity of the general qubit\nquantum channels, which quantifies the amount of quantum information that can\nbe protected. The behaviour of quantum capacity in different channels reveal\nwhich types of noise processes can support information transmission, and which\ntypes are too destructive to protect information. There is a general agreement\nbetween the theoretical predictions and the experiments, which strongly\nsupported our method. By realizing arbitrary qubit channel, this work provides\na universal way to explore various properties of quantum channel and novel\nprospect of quantum communication.\n", "  The algebraic method of singular reduction is applied for non regular group\naction on manifolds which provides singular symplectic spaces. The problem of\ndeformation quantization of the singular surfaces is the focus. For some\nexamples of singular Poisson spaces the deformation quantization is explicitly\nconstructed. In is shown that for the flat phase space with the classical\nmoment map and the orthogonal group action the deformation quantization\nconverges for the entire arguments of exponential type.\n", "  We consider the problem of the nonlinear response of a Rayleigh beam to the\npassage of a train of forces moving with stochastic velocity. The Fourier\ntransform and the theory of residues is used to estimate the mean-square\namplitude of the beam, while the stochastic averaging method gives the\nstationary probability density function of the oscillations amplitude. The\nanalysis shows that the effect of the load random velocities is highly\nnonlinear, leading to a nonmonotonic behavior of the mean amplitude versus the\nintensity of the stochastic term and of the load weight. The analytic approach\nis also checked with numerical simulations. The effect of loads number on the\nsystem response is numerically investigated.\n", "  Acoustic neutrino detection is a promising approach to extend the energy\nrange of neutrino telescopes to energies beyond $10^{18}$\\,eV. Currently\noperational and planned water-Cherenkov neutrino telescopes, most notably\nKM3NeT, include acoustic sensors in addition to the optical ones. These\nacoustic sensors could be used as instruments for acoustic detection, while\ntheir main purpose is the position calibration of the detection units. In this\narticle, a Monte Carlo simulation chain for acoustic detectors will be\npresented, covering the initial interaction of the neutrino up to the signal\nclassification of recorded events. The ambient and transient background in the\nsimulation was implemented according to data recorded by the acoustic set-up\nAMADEUS inside the ANTARES detector. The effects of refraction on the neutrino\nsignature in the detector are studied, and a classification of the recorded\nevents is implemented. As bipolar waveforms similar to those of the expected\nneutrino signals are also emitted from other sound sources, additional features\nlike the geometrical shape of the propagation have to be considered for the\nsignal classification. This leads to a large improvement of the background\nsuppression by almost two orders of magnitude, since a flat cylindrical\n\"pancake\" propagation pattern is a distinctive feature of neutrino signals. An\noverview of the simulation chain and the signal classification will be\npresented and preliminary studies of the performance of the classification will\nbe discussed.\n", "  A subtle balance between competing interactions in strongly correlated\nsystems can be easily tipped by additional interfacial interactions in a\nheterostructure. This often induces exotic phases with unprecedented\nproperties, as recently exemplified by high-Tc superconductivity in FeSe\nmonolayer on the nonmagnetic SrTiO3. When the proximity-coupled layer is\nmagnetically active, even richer phase diagrams are expected in iron-based\nsuperconductors (FeSCs), which however has not been explored due to the lack of\na proper material system. One promising candidate is Sr2VO3FeAs, a\nnaturally-assembled heterostructure of a FeSC and a Mott-insulating vanadium\noxide. Here, using high-quality single crystals and high-accuracy 75As and 51V\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, we show that a novel electronic\nphase is emerging in the FeAs layer below T0 ~ 155 K without either static\nmagnetism or a crystal symmetry change, which has never been observed in other\nFeSCs. We find that frustration of the otherwise dominant Fe stripe and V Neel\nfluctuations via interfacial coupling induces a charge/orbital order with\nC4-symmetry in the FeAs layers, while suppressing the Neel antiferromagnetism\nin the SrVO3 layers. These findings demonstrate that the magnetic proximity\ncoupling is effective to stabilize a hidden order in FeSCs and, more generally,\nin strongly correlated heterostructures.\n", "  The variability response function (VRF) is generalized to statically\ndeterminate Euler Bernoulli beams with arbitrary stress-strain laws following\nCauchy elastic behavior. The VRF is a Green's function that maps the spectral\ndensity function (SDF) of a statistically homogeneous random field describing\nthe correlation structure of input uncertainty to the variance of a response\nquantity. The appeal of such Green's functions is that the variance can be\ndetermined for any correlation structure by a trivial computation of a\nconvolution integral. The method introduced in this work derives VRFs in closed\nform for arbitrary nonlinear Cauchy-elastic constitutive laws and is\ndemonstrated through three examples. It is shown why and how higher order\nspectra of the random field affect the response variance for nonlinear\nconstitutive laws. In the general sense, the VRF for a statically determinate\nbeam is found to be a matrix kernel whose inner product by a matrix of higher\norder SDFs and statistical moments is integrated to give the response variance.\nThe resulting VRF matrix is unique regardless of the random field's marginal\nprobability density function (PDF) and SDFs.\n", "  In this work we describe the implementation and analysis of different\noptimization algorithms used for finding the best set of parameters for a Fuzzy\nInference System intended to classify solar flares. The parameters will be\nidentified among a universe of possible solutions for the algorithms, and the\nsystem will be tested in the particular case of dealing with the aim of\nclassifying the solar flares.\n", "  The scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave from Young pinholes upon a\nquasi-homogeneous (QH) anisotropic medium is studied within the accuracy of the\nfirst-order Born approximation. By assuming that the diffractive wave from\npinholes are paraxial with respect to the propagation direction, it is shown\nthat the correlation of incident wave, anisotropic correlation statistics of\nthe medium, and the pinhole size configuration can influence the statistical\nproperties of the scattered field. In particular, the normalized spectral\ndensity, spectral degree of coherence, and spectral degree of polarization of\nthe scattered field are derived by analytic forms, respectively.\n", "  To describe two-place events, Alice-Bob systems have been established by\nmeans of the shifted parity and delayed time reversal in Ref. [1]. In this\npaper, we mainly study exact solutions of the integrable Alice-Bob modified\nKorteweg de-Vries (AB-mKdV) system. The general Nth Darboux transformation for\nthe AB-mKdV equation are constructed. By using the Darboux transformation, some\ntypes of shifted parity and time reversal symmetry breaking solutions including\none-soliton, two-soliton and rogue wave solutions are explicitly obtained. In\naddition to the similar solutions of the mKdV equation (group invariant\nsolutions), there are abundant new localized structures for the AB-mKdV\nsystems.\n", "  The strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of $L{\\rm1_0}$-ordered FePt has\nbeen the subject of extensive studies for a long time. However, it is not known\nwhich element, Fe or Pt, mainly contributes to the magnetic anisotropy energy\n(MAE). We have investigated the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moments of\nFe 3$d$ and Pt 5$d$ electrons in $L{\\rm1_0}$-ordered FePt thin films by Fe and\nPt $L_{2,3}$-edge x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements for\nsamples with various degrees of long-range chemical order $S$. Fe\n$L_{2,3}$-edge XMCD showed that the orbital magnetic moment was larger when the\nmagnetic field was applied perpendicular to the film than parallel to it, and\nthat the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment increased with $S$. Pt\n$L_{2,3}$-edge XMCD also showed that the orbital magnetic moment was smaller\nwhen the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the film than parallel to\nit, opposite to the Fe $L_{2,3}$-edge XMCD results although the anisotropy of\nthe orbital magnetic moment increases with $S$ like the Fe edge. These results\nare qualitatively consistent with the first-principles calculation by Solovyev\n${\\it et\\ al.}$ [Phys. Rev. B $\\bf{52}$, 13419 (1995).], which also predicts\nthe dominant contributions of Pt 5$d$ to the magnetic anisotropy energy rather\nthan Fe 3$d$ due to the strong spin-orbit coupling and the small spin splitting\nof the Pt 5$d$ bands in $L{\\rm1_0}$-ordered FePt.\n", "  The uniform director field obtained for the nematic ground state of the\nhard-rod model of liquid crystals in two dimensions reflects the high symmetry\nof the constituents of the liquid; It is a manifestation of the constituents'\nlocal tendency to avoid splaying and bending with respect to one another. In\ncontrast, bent-core (or banana shaped) liquid-crystal-forming-molecules locally\nfavor a state of zero splay and constant bend. However, such a structure cannot\nbe realized in the plane and the resulting liquid-crystalline phase is\nfrustrated and must exhibit some compromise of these two mutually contradicting\nlocal intrinsic tendencies. The generation of geometric frustration from the\nintrinsic geometry of the constituents of a material is not only natural and\nubiquitous but also leads to a striking variety of morphologies of ground\nstates and exotic response properties.\n  In this work we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for two\nscalar functions, $s$ and $b$ to describe the splay and bend of a director\nfield in the plane. We generalize these compatibility conditions for geometries\nwith non-vanishing constant Gaussian curvature, and provide a reconstruction\nformula for the director field depending only on the splay and bend fields and\ntheir derivatives. Last, we discuss optimal compromises for simple incompatible\ncases where the locally preferred values of the splay and bend cannot be\nglobally achieved.\n", "  Several technical issues and challenges are identified and investigated for\nthe planar tunneling spectroscopy of the topological Kondo insulator SmB$_6$.\nContrasting behaviors of the tunnel junctions prepared in two different ways\nare analyzed and explained in detail. The conventional approach based on an\nAlO$_\\text{x}$ tunnel barrier results in unsatisfactory results due to the\ninter-diffusion between SmB$_6$ and deposited Al. On the contrary, plasma\noxidation of SmB$_6$ crystals produces high-quality tunnel barriers on both\n(001) and (011) surfaces. Resultant conductance spectra are highly reproducible\nwith clear signatures for the predicted surface Dirac fermions and the bulk\nhybridization gap as well. The surface states are identified to reside on two\nor one {\\it distinguishable} Dirac cone(s) on the (001) and (011) surface,\nrespectively, in good agreement with the recent literature. However, their\ntopological protection is found to be limited within the low energy region due\nto their inevitable interaction with the bulk excitations, called spin\nexcitons, consistent with a recent theoretical prediction. Implications of our\nfindings on other physical properties in SmB$_6$ and also other correlated\ntopological materials are remarked.\n", "  This paper devotes to formulating several multiscale models to study the\neffect of pH-dependent ionic inhomogeneity on the electrical potential\ndistributions and the graded elastic properties of a nanoscale DNA film and the\nrelated bending deflections of a microcantilever biosensor. First, the Langmuir\nisotherm was used to improve the classical Poisson-Boltzmann equation for\npolyelectrolyte solutions by introducing a new solution parameters to consider\nthe effect of the inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen ions on the electrical\npotential. Second, inspired by the Parsegian's mesoscopic attraction potential\nfor cation condensed DNAs, the graded distribution properties of the particles\nwere taken in the construction of an alternative interaction potential for both\nattraction-dominated and repulsion-dominated films. The new model parameters\nwere obtained by curve fitting with the bending deflection experiments of a\nmicrocantilever done by Arroyo-Hernandez et al. Third, by the improved\ninteraction potential and the thought experiment about the compression of a DNA\nbar in the context of macroscopic continuum mechanics, we investigated the\ndiversity of elastic properties of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) films due to the\nself-adaptability of its microstructures and constituents to the pH value, salt\nconcentration and cation valence. Numerical results show that electronegative\nDNA could be overcharged with a positive electrical potential when the particle\ndistribution conforms with the condition that the sign of the new introduced\nsolution parameter is negative. There exists a transition from the pH-sensitive\ninterval to pH-insensitive one for bending signals and elastic moduli. Negative\nelastic modulus is first revealed in the attraction-dominated ssDNA film\nconstrained on the Au-layer of a microcantilever biosensor.\n", "  Stationary and slow light effects are of great interest for quantum\ninformation applications. Using laser-cooled Rb87 atoms we have performed side\nimaging of our atomic ensemble under slow and stationary light conditions,\nwhich allows direct comparison with numerical models. The polaritions were\ngenerated using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), with stationary\nlight generated using counter-propagating control fields. By controlling the\npower ratio of the two control fields we show fine control of the group\nvelocity of the stationary light. We also compare the dynamics of stationary\nlight using monochromatic and bichromatic control fields. Our results show\nnegligible difference between the two situations, in contrast to previous work\nin EIT based systems.\n", "  The majority of these machines fabricate from raw material in powder form\nusing a directed energy beam to create a local melt zone. Total hip replacement\nis recommended for people who have medical issues related to excessive wear of\nthe acetabular, osteoarthritis, accident or age. Researches have shown that\nlarge numbers of hip arthroplasties (where the articular surface of a\nmusculoskeletal joint is replaced), hip remodelling, or realignment are carried\nout annually and will increase in the next few decades. Manufacturing of\nacetabular shells by using AM is a promising and emerging method that has a\ngreat potential to improve public health. Lost wax casting or investment\ncasting is currently used to produce acetabular shells followed by lengthy and\ncomplex secondary processes such as machining and polishing. Living organs and\nmedical models have intricate 3D shapes that are challenging to identity in\nX-ray CT images. These images are used for preparing treatment plans to improve\nthe quality of the surgeries regarding waiting and surgery time per procedure\nand care regime. For instance, a limited number of hip replacement procedures\ncan be carried out on each acetabulum due to a decrease of bone thickness.\nRapid prototyping is a suitable treatment planning tool in complex cases to\nenhance the quality of surgical procedure and provide long-term stability that\ncan be used to customize the shape and size of the acetabular shell. In this\npaper, to analyse the manufacturing of a prosthetic acetabular shell, built-up\nlines resulting from a thermal stress flow and process stopping during the\nselective laser melting (SLM) AM process, with regarding Gibbs free energy,\ninterfacial energy, and equilibrium temperature will be discussed. Geometrical\nmeasurements showed 1.59% and 0.27% differences between the designed and\nmanufactured prototype for inside and outside diameter respectively.\n", "  In the light of the recently predicted isotopic composition of the kpc-scale\njet in Centaurus A, we re-investigate whether this source could be responsible\nfor some of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays detected by the Pierre Auger\nObservatory. We find that a nearby source like Centaurus A is well motivated by\nthe composition and spectral shape, and that such sources should start to\ndominate the flux above ~ 4 EeV. The best-fitting isotopes from our modelling,\nwith the maximum 56Fe energy fixed at 250 EeV, are of intermediate mass, 12C to\n16O, while the best-fitting particle index is 2.3.\n", "  The equations of fluid motions are considered in the case of internal energy\ndepending on mass density, volume entropy and their spatial derivatives. The\nmodel corresponds to domains with large density gradients in which the\ntemperature is not necessary uniform. In this new general representation writes\nin symmetric form with respect to the mass and entropy densities. For\nconservative motions of perfect thermocapillary fluids, Kelvin's circulation\ntheorems are always valid. Dissipative cases are also considered; we obtain the\nbalance of energy and we prove that equations are compatible with the second\nlaw of thermodynamics. The internal energy form allows to obtain a Legendre\ntransformation inducing a quasi-linear system of conservation laws which can be\nwritten in a divergence form and the stability near equilibrium positions can\nbe deduced. The result extends classical hyperbolicity theory for\ngoverning-equations' systems in hydrodynamics, but symmetric matrices are\nreplaced by Hermitian matrices.\n", "  GeTe wins the renewed research interest due to its giant bulk Rashba spin\norbit coupling (SOC), and becomes the father of a new multifunctional material,\ni.e., ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor. In the present work, we investigate\nRashba SOC at the interface of the ferroelectric semiconductor superlattice\nGeTe(111)/InP(111) by using the first principles calculation. Contribution of\nthe interface electric field and the ferroelectric field to Rashba SOC is\nrevealed. A large modulation to Rashba SOC and a reversal of the spin\npolarization is obtained by switching the ferroelectric polarization. Our\ninvestigation about GeTe(111)/InP(111) superlattice is of great importance in\nthe application of ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor in the spin field effect\ntransistor.\n", "  The James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) has been the world's most successful\nsingle dish telescope at submillimetre wavelengths since it began operations in\n1987. From the pioneering days of single-element photometers and mixers,\nthrough the first modest imaging arrays, leading to the state-of-the-art\nwidefield camera SCUBA-2 and the spectrometer array HARP, the JCMT has been\nassociated with a number of major scientific discoveries. Famous for the\ndiscovery of \"SCUBA\" galaxies, which are responsible for a large fraction of\nthe far-infrared background, to the first images of huge discs of cool debris\naround nearby stars, possibly giving us clues to the evolution of planetary\nsystems, the JCMT has pushed the sensitivity limits more than any other\nfacility in this most difficult of wavebands in which to observe. Now\napproaching the 30th anniversary of the first observations the telescope\ncontinues to carry out unique and innovative science. In this review article we\nlook back on just some of the scientific highlights from the past 30 years.\n", "  The design of efficient and robust pulse sequences is a fundamental\nrequirement in quantum control. Numerical methods can be used for this purpose,\nbut with relatively little insight into the control mechanism. Here, we show\nthat the free rotation of a classical rigid body plays a fundamental role in\nthe control of two-level quantum systems by means of external electromagnetic\npulses. For a state to state transfer, we derive a family of control fields\ndepending upon two free parameters, which allow us to adjust the efficiency,\nthe time and the robustness of the control process. As an illustrative example,\nwe consider the quantum analog of the tennis racket effect, which is a\ngeometric property of any classical rigid body. This effect is demonstrated\nexperimentally for the control of a spin 1/2 particle by using techniques of\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance. We also show that the dynamics of a rigid body can\nbe used to implement one-qubit quantum gates. In particular, non-adiabatic\ngeometric quantum phase gates can be realized based on the Montgomery phase of\na rigid body. The robustness issue of the gates is discussed.\n", "  Short electron pulses are demonstrated to trigger and control magnetic\nexcitations, even at low electron current densities.\n  We show that the tangential magnetic field surrounding a picosecond electron\npulse can imprint topologically protected magnetic textures such as skyrmions\nin a sample with a residual Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbital coupling.\nCharacteristics of the created excitations such as the topological charge can\nbe steered via the duration and the strength of the electron pulses. The study\npoints to a possible way for a spatio-temporally controlled generation of\nskyrmionic excitations.\n", "  Static parameters of the deuteron, obtained by the wave functions for various\npotential models, have been chronologically systematized. The presence or\nabsence of knots near the origin of coordinates for the radial wave function of\nthe deuteron have been shown. Analytical forms for the deuteron wave function\nin coordinate space have been reviewed. Both analytical forms and\nparameterizations of the deuteron wave function, which are necessary for\nfurther calculations of the characteristics of the processes involving the\ndeuteron, have been provided. In addition, the asymptotic behaviors of deuteron\nwave function near the origin of coordinates and for large values of distance\nhave been analyzed in the paper. Minimization of the number of numerically\ncalculated coefficients for new analytical forms as a product of exponential\nfunction r^n by the sum of the exponential terms Ai*exp(-ai*r^3) have been\ndone. The optimum is N=7-10.\n", "  We present an elementary approach to concentration of disordered\nHamiltonians. Assuming differentiability of the limiting free energy $F$ with\nrespect to the inverse temperature $\\beta$, we show that the Hamiltonian\nconcentrates around the energy level $F'(\\beta)$ under the free energy and\nGibbs average.\n", "  We report the observation of ubiquitous contamination of\npolymethylmethacrylate by organic molecules with optical activity in the\nvisible spectral range. Contamination sites of individual solvent-specific\nfluorophores in thin films of polymethylmethacrylate constitute fluorescence\nhot-spots with quantum emission statistics and quantum yields approaching 30%\nat cryogenic temperatures. Our findings not only resolve prevalent puzzles in\nthe assignment of spectral features to various nanoemitters in polymer\nmatrices, they also identify means for simple and cost-efficient realization of\nsingle-photon sources in the visible spectral range.\n", "  Biological sensory systems generally operate out of equilibrium, which often\nleads to their improved performance. Here, we study the sensitivity of ligand\nconcentration for a general receptor model, which is generally in the\nnon-equilibrium stationary state, in the framework of a stochastic diffusion\nequation. We derived a general formula of the maximum sensitivity.\nSpecifically, the sensitivity is limited universally by the Berg-Purcell limit\n[Biophys. J ., 1977], regardless of whether the receptor is in an equilibrium\nor non-equilibrium state.\n", "  If $\\Psi$ is a quaternionic wave function, then $i\\Psi\\neq \\Psi i$. Thus,\nthere are two versions of the quaternionic Schr\\\"odinger equation (QSE). In\nthis article, we present the second possibility for solving the QSE, following\non from a previous article. After developing the general methodology, we\npresent the quaternionic free particle solution and the scattering of the\nquaternionic particle through a scalar barrier.\n", "  Laser-induced adiabatic alignment and mixed-field orientation of\n2,6-difluoroiodobenzene (C6H3F2I) molecules are probed by Coulomb explosion\nimaging following either near-infrared strong-field ionization or\nextreme-ultraviolet multi-photon inner-shell ionization using free-electron\nlaser pulses. The resulting photoelectrons and fragment ions are captured by a\ndouble-sided velocity map imaging spectrometer and projected onto two\nposition-sensitive detectors. The ion side of the spectrometer is equipped with\nthe Pixel Imaging Mass Spectrometry (PImMS) camera, a time-stamping pixelated\ndetector that can record the hit positions and arrival times of up to four ions\nper pixel per acquisition cycle. Thus, the time-of-flight trace and ion\nmomentum distributions for all fragments can be recorded simultaneously. We\nshow that we can obtain a high degree of one- and three-dimensional alignment\nand mixed- field orientation, and compare the Coulomb explosion process induced\nat both wavelengths.\n", "  The formalism proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 078001 (2016) for\ndetermination of the normal and tangential inter-particle forces in frictional\ndisks from visual data was criticized in a comment to that paper. However the\ntheory developed in the original publication is aimed at finding the forces\nwhen provided with accurate measurements while the comment addresses a\ndifferent problem, being the statistics of forces in a configuration with\nuncertainty of the relevant parameters. We address this difference in\nperspectives and point out that even with experimental errors one can improve\nthe results using an iterative procedure proposed in Phys. Rev. E. Rapid\nCommunication, 93, 060601(R) (2016).\n", "  We present and enhance our previous statements (arXiv:0907.4736) on the\nnon-canonical interrelations between the solutions to the free Dirac equation\n(DE) and the Klein-Gordon equation (KGE). We demonstrate that all the solutions\nto the DE (singular ones among them) can be obtained via differentiation of a\npair of the KGE solutions for a doublet of scalar fields. In this way we obtain\na \"spinor analogue\" of the mesonic Yukawa potential and previously unknown\nchains of solutions to the DE and KGE. The pair of scalar \"potentials\" is\ndefined up to a gauge transformation under which the corresponding solution of\nthe DE is invariant. Under transformations of the Lorentz group, canonical\nspinor transformations form only a subclass of more general transformations of\nthe DE solutions, under these the generating scalar potentials undergo\ntransformations of internal symmetry intermixing their components. In\nparticular, under continuous rotation through one full revolution the\ntransforming solutions, as a rule, take their original values (\"spinor\ntwo-valuedness\" is absent). With an arbitrary solution of the DE one can\nassociate, apart from the standard one, a non-canonical set of conserved\nquantities, a positive definite \"energy\" density among others, and with any KGE\nsolution -- a positive definite \"probability density\", etc. Finally, we discuss\na generalization of the proposed procedure to the case when an external\nelectromagnetic field is present.\n", "  We show that a proposal which involves an effective radius derived from an\neffective potential that includes a linear extra-potential may solve both the\nproton and deuteron size puzzle. Moreover, this solution preserves the e-{\\mu}\nuniversality and helps to solve the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon too.\nStill, it is consistent with the rms magnetic radius of the proton and\ndeuteron, the rms charge radius of both the ordinary and muonic C12 as well as\nthe kaonic and pionic X-rays spectroscopy.\n", "  PURPOSE: To correct line-to-line delays and phase errors in echo-planar\nimaging (EPI). THEORY AND METHODS: EPI- trajectory auto-corrected image\nreconstruction (EPI-TrACR) is an iterative maximum-likelihood technique that\nexploits data redundancy provided by multiple receive coils between nearby\nlines of k-space to determine and correct line-to-line trajectory delays and\nphase errors that cause ghosting artifacts. EPI-TrACR was applied to in vivo\ndata acquired at 7 Tesla across acceleration and multishot factors, and in a\ndynamic time series. The method was efficiently implemented using a segmented\nFFT and compared to a conventional calibrated reconstruction. RESULTS: Compared\nto conventional calibrated reconstructions, EPI-TrACR reduced ghosting up to\nmoderate acceleration factors and across multishot factors. It also maintained\nlow ghosting in a dynamic time series. Averaged over all cases, EPI-TrACR\nreduced root-mean-square ghosted signal outside the brain by 27% compared to\ncalibrated reconstruction. CONCLUSION: EPI-TrACR is effective in automatically\ncorrecting line-to-line delays and phase errors in multishot, accelerated, and\ndynamic EPI. While the method benefits from additional calibration data, it is\nnot a requirement.\n", "  The variable star V1129 Cen is classified in the GCVS as being of $\\beta$ Lyr\ntype. Unusual for such stars, it exhibits outbursts roughly once a year,\nlasting for $\\sim$40 days. For this reason, a relationship to the dwarf novae\nhas been suspected. Here, for the first time a detailed analysis of the light\ncurve of the system is presented. Based on observations with high time\nresolution obtained at the Observat\\'orio do Pico dos Dias and on the long term\nASAS light curve the orbital variations of the system are studied. They are\ndominated by ellipsoidal variations and partial eclipses of a probably slightly\nevolved F2 star in a binary with an orbital period of $21^{\\rm h}$ $26^{\\rm\nm}$. Comparison with the characteristics of dwarf novae show that the\nobservational properties of V1129 Cen can be explained if it is just another\ndwarf novae, albeit with an unusually bright and early type mass donor which\noutshines the accretion disk and the mass gainer to a degree that many normal\nphotometric and spectroscopic hallmarks of cataclysmic variables remain\nundetected.\n", "  This paper presents a comparison about different ways to generate electricity\nin Colombia (mainly the operation of each method) with respect to a technique\nmade in Europe, focused in the develop of energy with biomass or solid waste,\ntaking into account that Colombia is a country with an economy based in\nagriculture processes. The article presents the advantages and disadvantages in\neach method with variables like Generation, investment, employment and\nenvironment aspects, and with these information a proposal is presented like\nthe best way to generate energy in the country.\n", "  Infrared spectroscopy in the spectral fingerprint region from 6-12 um\naccesses the largest molecular absorption cross-sections, permitting sensitive,\nquantitative and species-specific measurements. Here, we show how dual-comb\nspectroscopy--a form of high-speed Fourier-transform spectroscopy involving no\nmoving parts and capable of very high resolutions--can be extended to the 6-8um\nwavelength band using femtosecond optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). By\nacquiring dual-comb interferograms faster than the mutual decoherence time of\nthe OPO combs we implement line-shape-preserving averaging to obtain low-noise,\nhigh-fidelity spectra of H2O and CH4 at approximately 0.3 cm-1 resolutions from\n1285-1585 cm-1.\n", "  We access the edge of Gaussian beta ensembles with one spike by analyzing\nhigh powers of the associated tridiagonal matrix models. In the classical cases\nbeta=1, 2, 4, this corresponds to studying the fluctuations of the largest\neigenvalues of additive rank one perturbations of the GOE/GUE/GSE random\nmatrices. In the infinite-dimensional limit, we arrive at a one-parameter\nfamily of random Feynman-Kac type semigroups, which features the stochastic\nAiry semigroup of Gorin and Shkolnikov [13] as an extreme case. Our analysis\nalso provides Feynman-Kac formulas for the spiked stochastic Airy operators,\nintroduced by Bloemendal and Virag [6]. The Feynman-Kac formulas involve\nfunctionals of a reflected Brownian motion and its local times, thus, allowing\nto study the limiting operators by tools of stochastic analysis. We derive a\nfirst result in this direction by obtaining a new distributional identity for a\nreflected Brownian bridge conditioned on its local time at zero.\n", "  Understanding star formation rates (SFR) is a central goal of modern\nstar-formation models, which mainly involve gravity, turbulence and, in some\ncases, magnetic fields (B-fields). However, a connection between B-fields and\nSFR has never been observed. Here, a comparison between the surveys of SFR and\na study of cloud-field alignment - which revealed a bimodal (parallel or\nperpendicular) alignment - shows consistently lower SFR per solar mass for\nclouds almost perpendicular to the B-fields. This is evidence of B-fields being\na primary regulator of SFR. The perpendicular alignment possesses a\nsignificantly higher magnetic flux than the parallel alignment and thus a\nstronger support of the gas against self-gravity. This results in overall lower\nmasses of the fragmented components, which are in agreement with the lower SFR.\n", "  We present an all-dielectric metadevice platform realized by combining an\ninverse electromagnetic design computational method with additive\nmanufacturing. As opposed to conventional flat metasurface based devices that\nare composed of resonant building blocks resulting in narrow band operation,\nour design approach creates non-resonant, extremely broadband metadevices. We\npropose and demonstrate high-efficiency (transmission > 60%), using thin\nall-dielectric metadevices that are capable of polarization splitting, beam\nbending, and focusing. Experimental demonstrations are performed at\nmillimeter-wave frequencies using 3D-printed metadevices, however our proposed\nplatform can be readily applied to the design and fabrication of\nelectromagnetic and photonic metadevices spanning microwave to optical\nfrequencies.\n", "  We present experimental control of the magnetic anisotropy in a gadolinium\niron garnet (GdIG) thin film from in-plane to perpendicular anisotropy by\nsimply changing the sample temperature. The magnetic hysteresis loops obtained\nby SQUID magnetometry measurements unambiguously reveal a change of the\nmagnetically easy axis from out-of-plane to in-plane depending on the sample\ntemperature. Additionally, we confirm these findings by the use of temperature\ndependent broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy (FMR). In order to\ndetermine the effective magnetization, we utilize the intrinsic advantage of\nFMR spectroscopy which allows to determine the magnetic anisotropy independent\nof the paramagnetic substrate, while magnetometry determines the combined\nmagnetic moment from film and substrate. This enables us to quantitatively\nevaluate the anisotropy and the smooth transition from in-plane to\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, we derive the temperature\ndependent $g$-factor and the Gilbert damping of the GdIG thin film.\n", "  The RICH detector of the NA62 experiment at CERN SPS is required to suppress\n$\\mu^+$ contamination in $K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\nu \\bar\\nu$ candidate events by a\nfactor at least 100 between 15 and 35 GeV/c momentum, to measure the pion\narrival time with $\\sim 100$ ps resolution and to produce a trigger for a\ncharged track. It consists of a 17 m long tank filled with Neon gas at\natmospheric pressure. \\v{C}erenkov light is reflected by a mosaic of 20\nspherical mirrors placed at the downstream end of the vessel and is collected\nby 1952 photomultipliers placed at the upstream end. The construction of the\ndetector will be described and the performance reached during first runs will\nbe discussed.\n", "  Measurements of the Hall effect and the resistivity in twinned\nYBa2Cu3O7-delta thin films in magnetic fields B oriented parallel to the\ncrystallographic c-axis and to the twin boundaries reveal a double sign\nreversal of the Hall coefficient for B below 1 T. In high transport current\ndensities, or with B tilted off the twin boundaries by 5 degrees, the second\nsign reversal vanishes. The power-law scaling of the Hall conductivity to the\nlongitudinal conductivity in the mixed state is strongly modified in the regime\nof the second sign reversal. Our observations are interpreted as strong,\ndisorder-type dependent vortex pinning and confirm that the Hall conductivity\nin high temperature superconductors is not independent of pinning.\n"]}
