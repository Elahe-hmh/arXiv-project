The T2K near\nneutrino detector complex is located 280 meters from the pion production target\nand will measure both neutrino beam properties close to the production point\nand interaction cross sections. The main design features, test results and\nstatus of these detectors are presented.\n", "  Accuracy of throwing in games and sports is governed by how errors at\nprojectile release are propagated by flight dynamics. To address the question\nof what governs the choice of throwing strategy, we use a simple model of\nthrowing with an arm modelled as a hinged bar of fixed length that can release\na projectile at any angle and angular velocity. We show that the amplification\nof deviations in launch parameters from a one parameter family of solution\ncurves is quantified by the largest singular value of an appropriate Jacobian.\nThis allows us to predict a preferred throwing style in terms of this singular\nvalue, which itself depends on target location and the target shape. Our\nanalysis also allows us to characterize the trade-off between speed and\naccuracy despite not including any effects of signal-dependent noise. Using\nnonlinear calculations for propagating finite input-noise, we find that an\nunderarm throw to a target leads to an undershoot, but an overarm throw does\nnot. Finally, we consider the limit of the arm-length vanishing, i.e. shooting\na projectile, and find that the most accurate shooting angle bifurcates as the\nratio of the relative noisiness of the initial conditions crosses a threshold.\n", "  Phenomenological effective interactions like Skyrme forces are currently used\nin mean--field calculations in nuclear physics. Mean--field models have strong\nanalogies with the first order of the perturbative many--body problem and the\ncurrently used effective interactions are adjusted at the mean--field level. In\nthis work, we analyze the renormalizability of the nuclear many--body problem\nin the case where the effective Skyrme interaction is employed in its standard\nform and the perturbative problem is solved up to second order. We focus on\nsymmetric nuclear matter and its equation of state, which can be calculated\nanalytically at this order. It is shown that only by applying specific density\ndependence and constraints to the interaction parameters could\nrenormalizability be guaranteed in principle. This indicates that the standard\nSkyrme interaction does not in general lead to a renormalizable theory. For\nachieving renormalizability, other terms should be added to the interaction and\nemployed perturbatively only at first order.\n", "  We realize an open version of the Dicke model by coupling two hyperfine\nground states using two cavity-assisted Raman transitions. The interaction due\nto only one of the couplings is described by the Tavis-Cummings model and we\nobserve a normal mode splitting in the transmission around the dispersively\nshifted cavity. With both couplings present the dynamics are described by the\nDicke model and we measure the onset of superradiant scattering into the cavity\nabove a critical coupling strength.\n", "  Unitary $2$-designs are random unitaries simulating up to the second order\nstatistical moments of the uniformly distributed random unitaries, often\nreferred to as Haar random unitaries. They are used in a wide variety of\ntheoretical and practical quantum information protocols, and also have been\nused to model the dynamics in complex quantum many-body systems. Here, we show\nthat unitary $2$-designs can be approximately implemented by alternately\nrepeating random unitaries diagonal in the Pauli-$Z$ basis and that in the\nPauli-$X$ basis. We also provide a converse about the number of repetitions\nneeded to achieve unitary $2$-designs. These results imply that the process\nafter $\\ell$ repetitions achieves a $\\Theta(d^{-\\ell})$-approximate unitary\n$2$-design. Based on the construction, we further provide quantum circuits that\nefficiently implement approximate unitary $2$-designs. Although a more\nefficient implementation of unitary $2$-designs is known, our quantum circuit\nhas its own merit that it is divided into a constant number of commuting parts,\nwhich enables us to apply all commuting gates simultaneously and leads to a\npossible reduction of an actual execution time. We finally interpret the result\nin terms of the dynamics generated by time-dependent Hamiltonians and provide\nfor the first time a random disordered time-dependent Hamiltonian that\ngenerates a unitary $2$-design after switching interactions only a few times.\n", "  We study the effect of a nearby planar wall on the propulsion of a phoretic\nJanus micro-swimmer driven by asymmetric reactions on its surface which absorb\nreactants and generate products. We show that the behaviour of these swimmers\nnear a wall can be classified ${\\bf based \\ on \\ whether}$ the swimmers are\n${\\bf mainly}$ absorbing or producing reaction solutes ${\\bf and \\ whether}$\ntheir swimming directions are such that the inert or active face is at the\nfront. We find that the wall-induced solute gradients always promote swimmer\npropulsion along the wall while the effect of hydrodynamics leads to\nre-orientation of the swimming direction away from the wall.\n", "  How neurons process their inputs crucially determines the dynamics of\nbiological and artificial neural networks. In such neural and neural-like\nsystems, synaptic input is typically considered to be merely transmitted\nlinearly or sublinearly by the dendritic compartments. Yet, single-neuron\nexperiments report pronounced supralinear dendritic summation of sufficiently\nsynchronous and spatially close-by inputs. Here, we provide a statistical\nphysics approach to study the impact of such non-additive dendritic processing\non single neuron responses and the performance of associative memory tasks in\nartificial neural networks. First, we compute the effect of random input to a\nneuron incorporating nonlinear dendrites. This approach is independent of the\ndetails of the neuronal dynamics. Second, we use those results to study the\nimpact of dendritic nonlinearities on the network dynamics in a paradigmatic\nmodel for associative memory, both numerically and analytically. We find that\ndendritic nonlinearities maintain network convergence and increase the\nrobustness of memory performance against noise. Interestingly, an intermediate\nnumber of dendritic branches is optimal for memory functionality.\n", "  The actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are vital structures for cell growth\nand development across all species. While individual molecular mechanisms\nunderpinning actin and microtubule dynamics have been intensively studied,\nprinciples that govern the cytoskeleton organization remain largely unexplored.\nHere, we captured biologically relevant characteristics of the plant\ncytoskeleton through a network-driven imaging-based approach allowing to\nquantitatively assess dynamic features of the cytoskeleton. By introducing\nsuitable null models, we demonstrate that the plant cytoskeletal networks\nexhibit properties required for efficient transport, namely, short average path\nlengths and high robustness. We further show that these advantageous features\nare maintained during temporal cytoskeletal re-arrangements. Interestingly,\nman-made transportation networks exhibit similar properties, suggesting general\nlaws of network organization supporting diverse transport processes. The\nproposed network-driven analysis can be readily used to identify organizational\nprinciples of cytoskeletons in other organisms.\n", "  In view of the current interest in combining different observations to\nconstraint annihilating WIMP dark matter, we examine the relation between the\nSommerfeld effect at the recombination epoch and in the galactic halo. By\nconsidering an up-to-date collection of interpolations of cosmic rays lepton\ndata (AMS-02 2014, Fermi and PAMELA), as dark matter annihilation signals, we\nshow that current cosmic rays measurements and recent Planck 2015 constraints\nfrom CMB anisotropies almost overlap for dark matter masses of the order of few\n$TeV$, although great theoretical uncertainties afflict cosmic rays and dark\nmatter descriptions. Combining cosmic rays fits we obtain proper minimal\nregions allowed by CMB observations, especially for $\\mu$ and $\\tau$\nannihilation channels, once assumed viable values of the efficiency factor for\nenergy absorption at recombination: the results are consistent with those\nobtained by the Planck collaboration but allow a slightly larger overlap\nbetween Cosmic Rays constraints from the lepton sector and CMB. Incoming AMS-02\nmeasurements of cosmic rays antiprotons will help to clarify the conundrum.\n", "  The standard formulation of quantum theory assumes that events are ordered is\na background global causal structure. Recently in\nRef.[$\\href{http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n10/full/ncomms2076.html}{Nat.\nCommun. {\\bf3}, 1092 (2012)}$], the authors have developed a new formalism,\nnamely, the \\emph{process matrix} formalism, which is locally in agreement with\nquantum physics but assumes no global causal order. They have further shown\nthat there exist \\emph{non-causal} correlations originating from\n\\emph{inseparable} process matrices that violate a \\emph{causal inequality}\n(CI) derived under the assumption that events are ordered with respect to some\nglobal causal relation. This CI can be understood as a guessing game, where two\nseparate parties, say Alice and Bob, generate random bits (say input bit) in\ntheir respective local laboratories. Bob generates another random bit (say\ndecision bit) which determines their goal: whether Alice has to guess Bob's bit\nor vice-verse. Here we study this causal game but with biased bits and derive a\nbiased causal inequality (BCI). We then study the possibility of violation of\nthis BCI by inseparable process matrices. Interestingly, we show that there\nexist \\emph{inseparable} qubit process matrices that can be used to violate the\nBCI for an arbitrary bias in the decision bit. In such scenario, we also derive\nthe maximal violation of the BCI under local operations involving traceless\nbinary observables. However, for biased input bits, we find that there is a\nthreshold bias beyond which no valid qubit process matrix can be used to\nviolate the causal inequality under \\emph{measurement-repreparation} type\noperation.\n", "  We introduce exclusion models of two distinguishable species of hard rods\nwith their distinct sites of entry and exit under open boundary conditions. In\nthe first model both species of rods move in the same direction whereas in the\nother two models they move in the opposite direction. These models are\nmotivated by the biological phenomenon known as Transcriptional Interference.\nTherefore, the rules for the kinetics of the models, particularly the rules for\nthe outcome of the encounter of the rods, are also formulated to mimic those\nobserved in Transcriptional Interference. By a combination of mean-field theory\nand computer simulation of these models we demonstrate how the flux of one\nspecies of rods is completely switched off by the other. Exploring the\nparameter space of the model we also establish the conditions under which\nswitch-like regulation of two fluxes is possible; from the extensive analysis\nwe discover more than one possible mechanism of this phenomenon.\n", "  We prove that a positive-definite measure in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with uniformly\ndiscrete support and discrete closed spectrum, is representable as a finite\nlinear combination of Dirac combs, translated and modulated. This extends our\nrecent results where we proved this under the assumption that also the spectrum\nis uniformly discrete. As an application we obtain that Hof's quasicrystals\nwith uniformly discrete diffraction spectra must have a periodic diffraction\nstructure.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of TeV-scale scalars as low energy remnants\narising in the non-supersymmetric $\\mathrm{SO}(10)$ grand unification framework\nwhere the field content is minimal. We consider a scenario where the\n$\\mathrm{SO}(10)$ gauge symmetry is broken into the gauge symmetry of the\nStandard Model (SM) through multiple stages of symmetry breaking, and a colored\nand hypercharged scalar $\\chi$ picks a TeV-scale mass in the process. The last\nstage of the symmetry breaking occurs at the TeV scale where the left-right\nsymmetry, i.e. $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_L\\otimes \\mathrm{SU}(2)_R\\otimes\n\\mathrm{U}(1)_{B-L}\\otimes \\mathrm{SU}(3)_C$, is broken into that of the SM by\na singlet scalar field $\\mathcal{S}$ of mass $M_{\\mathcal{S}}\\sim 1$ TeV, which\nis a component of an $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$-triplet scalar field, acquiring a\nTeV-scale vacuum expectation value. For the LHC phenomenology, we consider a\nscenario where $\\mathcal{S}$ is produced via gluon-gluon fusion through loop\ninteractions with $\\chi$ and also decays to a pair of SM gauge bosons through\n$\\chi$ in the loop. We find that the parameter space is heavily constrained\nfrom the latest LHC data. We use a multivariate analysis to estimate the LHC\ndiscovery reach of $\\mathcal{S}$ into the diphoton channel.\n", "  Full general relativity is almost certainly 'chaotic'. We argue that this\nentails a notion of nonintegrability: a generic general relativistic model, at\nleast when coupled to cosmologically interesting matter, likely possesses\nneither differentiable Dirac observables nor a reduced phase space. It follows\nthat the standard notion of observable has to be extended to include\nnon-differentiable or even discontinuous generalized observables. These cannot\ncarry Poisson-algebraic structures and do not admit a standard quantization;\none thus faces a quantum representation problem of gravitational observables.\nThis has deep consequences for a quantum theory of gravity, which we\ninvestigate in a simple model for a system with Hamiltonian constraint that\nfails to be completely integrable. We show that basing the quantization on\nstandard topology precludes a semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any\nsolutions to the quantum constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is\nto refine topology such that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes\ncontinuous. In the toy model, it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type\ntopology, as e.g. used in loop gravity, is sufficient. Basing quantization of\nthe toy model on this finer topology, we find a complete set of quantum Dirac\nobservables and a suitable semiclassical limit. This strategy is applicable to\nrealistic candidate theories of quantum gravity and thereby suggests a solution\nto a long-standing problem which implies ramifications for the very concept of\nquantization. Our work reveals a qualitatively novel facet of chaos in physics\nand opens up a new avenue of research on chaos in gravity which hints at deep\ninsights into the structure of quantum gravity.\n", "  Recent magnetic tweezers experiments have reported systematic deviations of\nthe twist response of double-stranded DNA from the predictions of the twistable\nworm-like chain model. Here we show, by means of analytical results and\ncomputer simulations, that these discrepancies can be resolved if a coupling\nbetween twist and bend is introduced. We obtain an estimate of 40 $\\pm$ 10 nm\nfor the twist-bend coupling constant. Our simulations are in good agreement\nwith high-resolution, magnetic-tweezers torque data. Although the existence of\ntwist-bend coupling was predicted long ago (Marko and Siggia, Macromolecules\n27, 981 (1994)), its effects on the mechanical properties of DNA have been so\nfar largely unexplored. We expect that this coupling plays an important role in\nseveral aspects of DNA statics and dynamics.\n", "  The terahertz (THz) spectral domain offers a myriad of applications spanning\nchemical spectroscopy, medicine, security and imaging[1]. It has also recently\nbecome a playground for fundamental studies of light-matter interactions [2-6].\nTHz science and technology could benefit from optomechanical approaches, which\nharness the interaction of light with miniature mechanical resonators [7,8]. So\nfar, optomechanics has mostly focused on the optical and microwave domains,\nleading to new types of quantum experiments [9-11] and to the development of\noptical-microwave converters [12-14]. Here we demonstrate an integrated\nmeta-atom [15] THz resonator with a flexible part acting as a mechanical\noscillator. In this device free space THz photons are collected by the\nresonator and induce high frequency currents and charges that, in turn, couple\nto the mechanical degrees of freedom. The resulting mechanical motion is\nread-out optically, allowing our device to function as a compact and efficient\nterahertz detector at room temperature. Furthermore the device operates at high\nmodulation frequencies (>10MHz), well beyond the cut-off frequencies of Golay\ncells, pyroelectric detectors and cryogenic semiconductor bolometers [16,17].\nNotably, our experiments unambiguously reveal an instantaneous THz detection\nmechanism arising from a nano-scale Coulomb interaction, with a Noise\nEquivalent Power that is potentially frequency independent. Alongside this\neffect, our compact geometry allows for an uncooled bolometric detection [18]\nwith extremely short heat diffusion times (few microseconds) and high\ndetectivity.\n", "  Domain walls in ferromagnetic nanowires are potential building-blocks of\nfuture technologies such as racetrack memories, in which data encoded in the\ndomain walls are transported using spin-polarised currents. However, the\ndevelopment of energy-efficient devices has been hampered by the high current\ndensities needed to initiate domain wall motion. We show here that a remarkable\nreduction in the critical current density can be achieved for in-plane\nmagnetised coupled domain walls in CoFe/Ru/CoFe synthetic ferrimagnet tracks.\nThe antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the layers leads to simple\nN\\'{e}el wall structures, imaged using photoemission electron and Lorentz\ntransmission electron microscopy, with a width of only $\\sim 100$~nm. The\nmeasured critical current density to set these walls in motion, detected using\nmagnetotransport measurements, is $1.0 \\times 10^{11}$~Am$^{-2}$, almost an\norder of magnitude lower than in a ferromagnetically coupled control sample.\nTheoretical modelling indicates that this is due to nonadiabatic driving of\nanisotropically coupled walls, a mechanism that can be used to design efficient\ndomain-wall devices.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of quantum simulations of $(1+1)$-dimensional\nU(1) lattice gauge-Higgs models, which contain a compact U(1) gauge field and a\nHiggs matter field, by using ultra-cold bosonic gases on a one-dimensional\noptical lattice. Starting from the extended Bose-Hubbard model with on-site and\nnearest-neighbor interactions, we derive the U(1) lattice gauge-Higgs model as\na low-energy effective theory. The derived gauge-Higgs model exhibits\nnontrivial phase transitions between confinement and Higgs phases, and we\ndiscuss the relation with the phase transition in the extended Bose-Hubbard\nmodel. Finally, we study real-time dynamics of an electric flux by the\nGross-Pitaevskii equations and the truncated Wigner approximation. The dynamics\nis governed by a bosonic analog of the Schwinger mechanism, i.e., shielding of\nan electric flux by a condensation of Higgs fields, which occurs differently in\nthe Higgs and the confinement phase. These results, together with the obtained\nphase diagrams, shall guide experimentalists in designing quantum simulations\nof the gauge-Higgs models by cold gases.\n", "  We develop a stochastic model for the programmed frameshift of ribosomes\nsynthesizing a protein while moving along a mRNA template. Normally the reading\nframe of a ribosome decodes successive triplets of nucleotides on the mRNA in a\nstep-by-step manner. We focus on the programmed shift of the ribosomal reading\nframe, forward or backward, by only one nucleotide which results in a fusion\nprotein; it occurs when a ribosome temporarily loses its grip to its mRNA\ntrack. Special \"slippery\" sequences of nucleotides and also downstream\nsecondary structures of the mRNA strand are believed to play key roles in\nprogrammed frameshift. Here we explore the role of an hitherto neglected\nparameter in regulating -1 programmed frameshift. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat the frameshift frequency can be strongly regulated also by the density of\nthe ribosomes, all of which are engaged in simultaneous translation of the same\nmRNA, at and around the slippery sequence. Monte Carlo simulations support the\nanalytical predictions obtained from a mean-field analysis of the stochastic\ndynamics.\n", "  After a raindrop impacts on a granular bed, a crater is formed as both drop\nand target deform. After an initial, transient, phase in which the maximum\ncrater depth is reached, the crater broadens outwards until a final steady\nshape is attained. By varying the impact velocity of the drop and the packing\ndensity of the bed, we find that avalanches of grains are important in the\nsecond phase and hence, affect the final crater shape. In a previous paper, we\nintroduced an estimate of the impact energy going solely into sand deformation\nand here we show that both the transient and final crater diameter collapse\nwith this quantity for various packing densities. The aspect ratio of the\ntransient crater is however altered by changes in the packing fraction.\n", "  At low temperatures bosons typically condense to minimize their\nsingle-particle kinetic energy while interactions stabilize superfluidity.\nOptical lattices with artificial spin-orbit coupling challenge this paradigm\nbecause here kinetic energy can be quenched in an extreme regime where the\nsingle-particle band flattens. To probe the fate of superfluidity in the\nabsence of kinetics we construct and numerically solve interaction-only\ntight-binding models in flat bands. We find that novel superfluid states arise\nentirely from interactions operating in quenched kinetic energy bands, thus\nrevealing a distinct and unexpected condensation mechanism. Our results have\nimportant implications for the identification of quantum condensed phases of\nultracold bosons beyond conventional paradigms.\n", "  Domains of attraction are identified for the universality classes of\none-point asymptotic fluctuations for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation\nwith general initial data. The criterion is based on a large deviation rate\nfunction for the rescaled initial data, which arises naturally from the\nHopf-Cole transformation. This allows us, in particular, to distinguish the\ndomains of attraction of curved, flat, and Brownian initial data, and to\nidentify the boundary between the curved and flat domains of attraction, which\nturns out to correspond to square root initial data.\n  The distribution of the asymptotic one-point fluctuations is characterized by\nmeans of a variational formula written in terms of certain limiting processes\n(arising as subsequential limits of the spatial fluctuations of KPZ equation\nwith narrow wedge initial data, as shown in [CH16]) which are widely believed\nto coincide with the Airy$_2$ process. In order to identify these distributions\nfor general initial data, we extend earlier results on continuum statistics of\nthe Airy$_2$ process to probabilities involving the process on the entire line.\nIn particular, this allows us to write an explicit Fredholm determinant formula\nfor the case of square root initial data.\n", "  One of the most pressing issues in quantum key distribution (QKD) is the\nproblem of detector side- channel attacks. To overcome this problem,\nresearchers proposed an elegant \"time-reversal\" QKD protocol called\nmeasurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD), which is based on time-reversed\nentanglement swapping. However, MDI-QKD is more challenging to implement than\nstandard point- to-point QKD. Recently, an intermediary QKD protocol called\ndetector-device-independent QKD (DDI-QKD) has been proposed to overcome the\ndrawbacks of MDI-QKD, with the hope that it would eventually lead to a more\nefficient detector side-channel-free QKD system. Here, we analyze the security\nof DDI-QKD and elucidate its security assumptions. We find that DDI-QKD is not\nequivalent to MDI-QKD, but its security can be demonstrated with reasonable\nassumptions. On the more practical side, we consider the feasibility of DDI-QKD\nand present a fast experimental demonstration (clocked at 625 MHz), capable of\nsecret key exchange up to more than 90 km.\n", "  This is an introduction to Exactly Solved Models and Beyond, a special issue\ncollection of articles published in J. Phys. A in honour of R J Baxter's 75th\nbirthday.\n", "  How fish modulate their fin stiffness during locomotive manoeuvres remains\nunknown. We show that changing the fin's curvature modulates its stiffness.\nModelling the fin as bendable bony rays held together by a membrane, we deduce\nthat fin curvature is manifested as a misalignment of the principal bending\naxes between neighbouring rays. An external force causes neighbouring rays to\nbend and splay apart, and thus stretches the membrane. This coupling between\nbending the rays and stretching the membrane underlies the increase in\nstiffness. Using analysis of a 3D reconstruction of a Mackerel (Scomber\njaponicus) pectoral fin, we calculate the range of stiffnesses this fin is\nexpected to span by changing curvature. The 3D reconstruction shows that, even\nin its geometrically flat state, a functional curvature is embedded within the\nfin microstructure owing to the morphology of individual rays. Since the\nability of a propulsive surface to transmit force to the surrounding fluid is\nlimited by its stiffness, the fin curvature controls the coupling between the\nfish and its surrounding fluid. Thereby, our results provide mechanical\nunderpinnings and morphological predictions for the hypothesis that the spanned\nrange of fin stiffnesses correlates with the behaviour and the ecological niche\nof the fish.\n", "  Reaction prediction remains one of the major challenges for organic\nchemistry, and is a pre-requisite for efficient synthetic planning. It is\ndesirable to develop algorithms that, like humans, \"learn\" from being exposed\nto examples of the application of the rules of organic chemistry. We explore\nthe use of neural networks for predicting reaction types, using a new reaction\nfingerprinting method. We combine this predictor with SMARTS transformations to\nbuild a system which, given a set of reagents and re- actants, predicts the\nlikely products. We test this method on problems from a popular organic\nchemistry textbook.\n", "  We study the dynamics of isospectral granular chains that are highly tunable\ndue to the nonlinear Hertz contact law interaction between the granular\nparticles. The system dynamics can thus be tuned easily from being linear to\nstrongly nonlinear by adjusting the initial compression applied to the chain.\nIn particular, we introduce both discrete and continuous spectral\ntransformation schemes to generate a family of granular chains that are\nisospectral in their linear limit. Inspired by the principle of supersymmetry\nin quantum systems, we also introduce a methodology to add or remove certain\neigenfrequencies, and we demonstrate numerically that the corresponding\nphysical system can be constructed in the setting of one-dimensional granular\ncrystals. In the linear regime, we highlight the commonalities and differences\nin the elastic wave transmission characteristics of such isospectral systems,\nand emphasize that the presented mathematical framework allows one to suitably\ntailor the wave transmission through a general class of granular chains.\nMoreover, we show how the dynamic response of these structures deviates from\nits linear limit as we introduce Hertzian nonlinearity in the chain and how\nnonlinearity breaks the notion of linear isospectrality.\n", "  We selected approximately 10,500 Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) and Wide-Angle\nCamera (WAC) stereo images obtained by the MESSENGER spacecraft during its\norbital mission with average resolutions of 150 m/pixel to compute a Digital\nTerrain Model (DTM) for the so-called H6 quadrangle (Kuiper), extending between\n22.5{\\deg}S to 22.5{\\deg}N and 288.0{\\deg}E to 360.0{\\deg}E. Among the images,\nwe identified about 21,100 stereo image combinations with each combination\nconsisting of at least 3 images. We applied sparse multi-image matching to\nderive approximately 250,000 tie-points representing 50,000 ground points. We\nused the tie-points to carry out a photogrammetric block adjustment, which\nimproves the image pointing and the accuracy of (3D) ground points from about\n850 m to approximately 55 m. Subsequently, we applied high density\n(pixel-by-pixel) multi-image matching to derive about 45 billion tie-points.\nBenefitting from improved image pointing data, we compute about 6.3 billion\nsurface points. By interpolation, we generated a DEM with a lateral spacing of\n221.7 m/pixel (192 pixels per degree) and a vertical accuracy of about 30 m.\nThe comparison of the DEM with the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) tracks\nobtained over 4 years of MESSENGER operation reveals that the DEM is\ngeometrically very rigid. It may be used as a reference to identify MLA\noutliers (when MLA operating at ranging limit) or to map offsets of laser\naltimeter tracks, presumably caused by residual spacecraft orbit and attitude\nerrors. After the relevant outlier removal and corrections, MLA profiles show\nexcellent agreement with topographic profiles from H6 with root mean square\nheight difference of only 88 m.\n", "  We study the excitation energy transfer (EET) for a simple model in which a\nmassless scalar particle is exchanged between two molecules. We show that a\nfinite-size effect appears in EET by the interaction energy due to overlapping\nof the quantum waves in a short time interval. The effect generates finite-size\ncorrections to Fermi's golden rule and modifies EET probability from the\nstandard formula in the Forster mechanism. The correction terms come from\ntransition modes outside the resonance energy region and enhance EET\nprobability substantially.\n", "  Momentum-space curvature, which is expected in some approaches to the\nquantum-gravity problem, can produce dual redshift, a feature which introduces\nenergy dependence of the travel times of ultrarelativistic particles, and dual\nlensing, a feature which mainly affects the direction of observation of\nparticles. In our recent arXiv:1605.00496 we explored the possibility that dual\nredshift might be relevant in the analysis of IceCube neutrinos, obtaining\nresults which are preliminarily encouraging. Here we explore the possibility\nthat also dual lensing might play a role in the analysis of IceCube neutrinos.\nIn doing so we also investigate issues which are of broader interest, such as\nthe possibility of estimating the contribution by background neutrinos and some\nnoteworthy differences between candidate \"early neutrinos\" and candidate \"late\nneutrinos\".\n", "  In this paper, we revisit the gravitino dark matter scenario in the presence\nof the bilinear $R$-parity violating interaction. In particular, we discuss a\nconsistency with the thermal leptogenesis. For a high reheating temperature\nrequired for the thermal leptogenesis, the gravitino dark matter tends to be\noverproduced, which puts a severe upper limit on the gluino mass. As we will\nshow, a large portion of parameter space of the gravitino dark matter scenario\nhas been excluded by combining the constraints from the gravitino abundance and\nthe null results of the searches for the superparticles at the LHC experiments.\nIn particular, the models with the stau (and other charged slepton) NLSP has\nbeen almost excluded by the searches for the long-lived charged particles at\nthe LHC unless the required reheating temperature is somewhat lowered by\nassuming, for example, a degenerated right-handed neutrino mass spectrum.\n", "  The radially outward flow of fluid into a porous medium occurs in many\npractical problems, from transport across vascular walls to the pressurisation\nof boreholes. As the driving pressure becomes non-negligible relative to the\nstiffness of the solid structure, the poromechanical coupling between the fluid\nand the solid has an increasingly strong impact on the flow. For very large\npressures or very soft materials, as is the case for hydraulic fracturing and\narterial flows, this coupling can lead to large deformations and, hence, to\nstrong deviations from a classical, linear-poroelastic response. Here, we study\nthis problem by analysing the steady-state response of a poroelastic cylinder\nto fluid injection. We consider the qualitative and quantitative impacts of\nkinematic and constitutive nonlinearity, highlighting the strong impact of\ndeformation-dependent permeability. We show that the wall thickness (thick vs.\nthin) and the outer boundary condition (free vs. constrained) play a central\nrole in controlling the mechanics.\n", "  We have recently introduced Forman's discretization of Ricci curvature to the\nrealm of complex networks. Forman curvature is an edge-based measure whose\nmathematical definition elegantly encapsulates the weights of nodes and edges\nin a complex network. In this contribution, we perform a comparative analysis\nof Forman curvature with other edge-based measures such as edge betweenness,\nembeddedness and dispersion in diverse model and real networks. We find that\nForman curvature in comparison to embeddedness or dispersion is a better\nindicator of the importance of an edge for the large-scale connectivity of\ncomplex networks. Based on the definition of the Forman curvature of edges,\nthere are two natural ways to define the Forman curvature of nodes in a\nnetwork. In this contribution, we also examine these two possible definitions\nof Forman curvature of nodes in diverse model and real networks. Based on our\nempirical analysis, we find that in practice the unnormalized definition of the\nForman curvature of nodes with the choice of combinatorial node weights is a\nbetter indicator of the importance of nodes in complex networks.\n", "  In recent years, searches for the light and heavy charged Higgs bosons have\nbeen done by the ATLAS and the CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) in proton-proton collision. Nevertheless, a definitive search is a\nprogram that still has to be carried out at the LHC. The experimental\nobservation of charged Higgs bosons would indicate physics beyond the Standard\nModel. In the present work, we study the scaled-energy distribution of\nbottom-flavored mesons ($B$) inclusively produced in polarized top quark decays\ninto a light charged Higgs boson and a massless bottom quark at next-to-leading\norder in the two-Higgs-doublet model; $t(\\uparrow)\\to bH^+\\to BH^++X$. This\nspin-dependent energy distribution is studied in a specific helicity coordinate\nsystem where the polarization vector of the top quark is measured with respect\nto the direction of the Higgs momentum. The study of these energy distributions\ncould be considered as a new channel to search for the charged Higgs bosons at\nthe LHC. For our numerical analysis and phenomenological predictions, we\nrestrict ourselves to the unexcluded regions of the MSSM $m_{H^+}-\\tan\\beta$\nparameter space determined by the recent results of the CMS \\cite{CMS:2014cdp}\nand ATLAS \\cite{TheATLAScollaboration:2013wia} collaborations.\n", "  We present local optical measurements of thermal diffusivity in the $ab$\nplane of underdoped YBCO crystals. We find that the diffusivity anisotropy is\ncomparable to reported values of the electrical resistivity anisotropy,\nsuggesting that the anisotropies have the same origin. The anisotropy drops\nsharply below the charge order transition. We interpret our results through a\nstrong electron-phonon scattering picture and find that both electronic and\nphononic contributions to the diffusivity saturate a proposed bound. Our\nresults suggest that neither well-defined electron nor phonon quasiparticles\nare present in this material.\n", "  Quantum mechanics admits correlations that cannot be explained by local\nrealistic models. Those most studied are the standard local hidden variable\nmodels, which satisfy the well-known Bell inequalities. To date, most works\nhave focused on bipartite entangled systems. Here, we consider correlations\nbetween three parties connected via two independent entangled states. We\ninvestigate the new type of so-called \"bilocal\" models, which correspondingly\ninvolve two independent hidden variables. Such models describe scenarios that\nnaturally arise in quantum networks, where several independent entanglement\nsources are employed. Using photonic qubits, we build such a linear three-node\nquantum network and demonstrate non-bilocal correlations by violating a\nBell-like inequality tailored for bilocal models. Furthermore, we show that the\ndemonstration of non-bilocality is more noise-tolerant than that of standard\nBell non-locality in our three-party quantum network.\n", "  Strong decays of $X\\left( 3915\\right) $ are analyzed from two quark model\ndescriptions of $X\\left( 3915\\right) $, a conventional one in terms of the\nCornell potential and an unconventional one from a Generalized Screened\npotential. We conclude that the experimental suppression of the OZI allowed\ndecay $X\\left( 3915\\right) \\rightarrow D\\overline{D}$ might be explained in\nboth cases as due to the momentum dependence of the decay amplitude. However,\nthe experimental significance of the OZI forbidden decay $X\\left( 3915\\right)\n\\rightarrow\\omega J/\\psi$ could favor an unconventional description.\n", "  We perform two-dimensional (2D) implosion simulations using a Monte Carlo\nkinetic particle code. The paper is motivated by the importance of\nnon-equilibrium effects in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsule\nimplosions. These cannot be fully captured by hydrodynamic simulations while\nkinetic methods, as the one presented in this study, are able to describe\ncontinuum and rarefied regimes within one approach. In the past, our code has\nbeen verified via traditional shock wave and fluid instability simulations. In\nthe present work, we focus on setups that are closer to applications in ICF. We\nperform simple 2D disk implosion simulations using one particle species. The\nobtained results are compared to simulations using the hydrodynamics code RAGE.\nIn a first study, the implosions are powered by energy deposition in the outer\nlayers of the disk. We test the impact of the particle mean-free-path and find\nthat while the width of the implosion shock broadens, its location as a\nfunction of time remains very similar. In a second study, we focus on the\nformation of fluid instabilities from induced perturbations. We find good\nagreement with hydrodynamic studies regarding the location of the shock, the\nimplosion dynamics and the formation of imposed fluid instabilities.\nDifferences are due to the higher resolution of RAGE and statistical noise in\nthe kinetic simulations. The current studies represent proofs-of-principle and\nserve as a stepping stone for more sophisticated ICF simulations in the future.\n", "  When the multiplicities of particles produced in heavy-ion collisions are\nfitted to the hadron-resonance-gas model, excluded-volume effects play a\nsignificant role. In this work, we study the impact of such effects on the\nequation of state of pure Yang-Mills theory at low temperatures, comparing the\npredictions of the statistical model with lattice results. In particular, we\npresent a detailed analysis of the SU(2) and SU(3) Yang-Mills theories: we find\nthat, for both of them, the best fits to the equilibrium thermodynamic\nquantities are obtained when one assumes that the volume of different glueball\nstates is inversely proportional to their mass. The implications of these\nfindings for QCD are discussed.\n", "  The possibility of performing simultaneous measurements in quantum mechanics\nis investigated in the context of the Curie-Weiss model for a projective\nmeasurement. Concretely, we consider a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ system simultaneously\ninteracting with two magnets, which act as measuring apparatuses of two\ndifferent spin components. We work out the dynamics of this process and\ndetermine the final state of the measuring apparatuses, from which we can find\nthe probabilities of the four possible outcomes of the measurements. The\nmeasurement is found to be non-ideal, as (i) the joint statistics do not\ncoincide with the one obtained by separately measuring each spin component, and\n(ii) the density matrix of the spin does not collapse in either of the measured\nobservables. However, we give an operational interpretation of the process as a\ngeneralised quantum measurement, and show that it is fully informative: The\nexpected value of the measured spin components can be found with arbitrary\nprecision for sufficiently many runs of the experiment.\n", "  Although perturbative quantum field theory is highly successful, it possesses\na number of well-known analytic problems, from ultraviolet and infrared\ndivergencies to the divergence of the perturbative expansion itself. As a\nconsequence, it has been difficult, for example, to prove with full rigor that\nthe Legendre transform of the quantum effective action is the generating\nfunctional of connected graphs. Here, we give a rigorous proof of this central\nfact. To this end, we show that the Legendre transform can be re-defined purely\ncombinatorially and that it ultimately reduces to a simple homological\nrelation, the Euler characteristic for tree graphs. This result suggests that,\nsimilarly, also the quantum field theoretic path integral, being a Fourier\ntransform, may be reducible to an underlying purely algebraic structure.\n", "  We generalize the class of hypergraph states to multipartite systems of\nqudits, by means of constructions based on the d-dimensional Pauli group and\nits normalizer. For simple hypergraphs, the different equivalence classes under\nlocal operations are shown to be governed by a greatest common divisor\nhierarchy. Moreover, the special cases of three qutrits and three ququarts is\nanalysed in detail.\n", "  We study the effective Bloch-wave scattering of a spinless Fermi gas in\none-dimensional (1D) optical lattices. By tuning the odd-wave scattering\nlength, we find multiple resonances of Bloch-waves scattering at the bottom\n(and the top) of the lowest band, beyond which an attractive (and a repulsive)\ntwo-body bound state starts to emerge. These resonances exhibit comparable\nwidths in the deep lattice limit, and the finite interaction range plays an\nessential role in determining their locations. Based on the exact two-body\nsolutions, we construct an effective microscopic model for the low-energy\nscattering of fermions. The model can reproduce not only the scattering\namplitudes of Bloch-waves at the lowest band bottom/top, but also the\nattractive/repulsive bound states within a reasonably large energy range\nbelow/above the band. These results lay the foundation for quantum simulating\ntopological states in cold Fermi gases confined in 1D optical lattices.\n", "  An approach to quantum random number generation based on unambiguous quantum\nstate discrimination (USD) is developed. We consider a prepare-and-measure\nprotocol, where two non-orthogonal quantum states can be prepared, and a\nmeasurement device aims at unambiguously discriminating between them. Because\nthe states are non-orthogonal, this necessarily leads to a minimal rate of\ninconclusive events whose occurrence must be genuinely random and which provide\nthe randomness source that we exploit. Our protocol is semi-device-independent\nin the sense that the output entropy can be lower bounded based on experimental\ndata and few general assumptions about the setup alone. It is also practically\nrelevant, which we demonstrate by realising a simple optical implementation\nachieving rates of 16.5 Mbits/s. Combining ease of implementation, high rate,\nand real-time entropy estimation, our protocol represents a promising approach\nintermediate between fully device-independent protocols and commercial QRNGs.\n", "  We introduce an improved model that links the frequency shift of the\n$^{133}\\text{Cs}$ hyperfine Zeeman transitions $\\vert F = 3, m_F>\n\\longleftrightarrow \\vert F = 4, m_F >$ to the Lorentz-violating Standard-Model\nExtension (SME) coefficients of the proton and neutron. The new model uses\nLorentz transformations developed to second order in boost and additionally\ntakes the nuclear structure into account, beyond the simple Schmidt model used\npreviously in SME analyses, thereby providing access to both proton and neutron\nSME coefficients including the isotropic coefficient $\\tilde{c}_{TT}$. Using\nthis new model in a second analysis of the data delivered by the FO2 dual Cs/Rb\nfountain at Paris Observatory and previously analysed in\narXiv:hep-ph/0601024v1, we improve by up to 12 orders of magnitude the present\nmaximum sensitivities (see arXiv:0801.0287v9) on the $\\tilde{c}_{Q}$,\n$\\tilde{c}_{TJ}$ and $\\tilde{c}_{TT}$ coefficients for the neutron and on the\n$\\tilde{c}_{TT}$ coefficient for the proton, reaching respectively $10^{-20}$,\n$10^{-17}$, $10^{-13}$ and $10^{-15}$ GeV.\n", "  Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been employed in the problem of\nclassifying signal and background events with high accuracy in particle\nphysics. In this paper, we compare the performance of a widespread ML\ntechnique, namely, \\emph{stacked generalization}, against the results of two\nstate-of-art algorithms: (1) a deep neural network (DNN) in the task of\ndiscovering a new neutral Higgs boson and (2) a scalable machine learning\nsystem for tree boosting, in the Standard Model Higgs to tau leptons channel,\nboth at the 8 TeV LHC. In a cut-and-count analysis, \\emph{stacking} three\nalgorithms performed around 16\\% worse than DNN but demanding far less\ncomputation efforts, however, the same \\emph{stacking} outperforms boosted\ndecision trees. Using the stacked classifiers in a multivariate statistical\nanalysis (MVA), on the other hand, significantly enhances the statistical\nsignificance compared to cut-and-count in both Higgs processes, suggesting that\ncombining an ensemble of simpler and faster ML algorithms with MVA tools is a\nbetter approach than building a complex state-of-art algorithm for\ncut-and-count.\n", "  We study mass-imbalanced two-component Fermi mixtures, where one of the\ncomponents consists of dipolar fermions. We specifically study the mass\nimbalances corresponding to the atomic ${}^{163}$Dy-${}^{40}$K and\n${}^{53}$Cr-${}^{6}$Li mixtures. We study the onset of the $s$-wave superfluid\nphase, as a function of population imbalance and the dipolar interaction\nstrength. We find the critical temperature and the Fermi surface deformations\nat the transition to depend on the dipolar interaction strength, where the\ncritical temperature increases (decreases) with dipolar interaction strength\nfor a majority (minority) of dipolar atoms. We present momentum distributions\nof both components where the Fermi surface deformations are visible.\n", "  Many exotic phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems emerge from the\ninterplay between spin and motional degrees of freedom. For example, doping an\nantiferromagnet gives rise to interesting phases including pseudogap states and\nhigh-temperature superconductors. A promising route towards achieving a\ncomplete understanding of these materials begins with analytic and\ncomputational analysis of simplified models. Quantum simulation has recently\nemerged as a complementary approach towards understanding these models.\nUltracold fermions in optical lattices offer the potential to answer open\nquestions on the low-temperature regime of the doped Hubbard model, which is\nthought to capture essential aspects of the cuprate superconductor phase\ndiagram but is numerically intractable in that parameter regime. A new\nperspective is afforded by quantum gas microscopy of fermions, which allows\nreadout of magnetic correlations at the site-resolved level. Here we report the\nrealization of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a\n2D square lattice of approximately 80 sites. Using site-resolved imaging, we\ndetect (finite-size) antiferromagnetic long-range order (LRO) through the\ndevelopment of a peak in the spin structure factor and the divergence of the\ncorrelation length that reaches the size of the system. At our lowest\ntemperature of T/t = 0.25(2) we find strong order across the entire sample. Our\nexperimental platform enables doping away from half filling, where pseudogap\nstates and stripe ordering are expected, but theoretical methods become\nnumerically intractable. In this regime we find that the antiferromagnetic LRO\npersists to hole dopings of about 15%, providing a guideline for computational\nmethods. Our results demonstrate that quantum gas microscopy of ultracold\nfermions in optical lattices can now address open questions on the\nlow-temperature Hubbard model.\n", "  The observed classicality of primordial perturbations, despite their quantum\norigin during inflation, calls for a mechanism for quantum-to-classical\ntransition of these initial fluctuations. As literature suggests a number of\nplausible mechanisms which try to address this issue, it is of importance to\nseek for concrete observational signatures of these several approaches in order\nto have a better understanding of the early universe dynamics. Among these\nseveral approaches, it is the spontaneous collapse dynamics of Quantum\nMechanics which is most viable of leaving discrete observational signatures as\ncollapse mechanism inherently changes the generic Quantum dynamics. We observe\nin this study that the observables from the scalar sector, i.e. scalar tilt\n$n_s$, running of scalar tilt $\\alpha_s$ and running of running of scalar tilt\n$\\beta_s$, can not potentially distinguish a collapse modified inflationary\ndynamics in the realm of canonical scalar field and $k-$inflationary scenarios.\nThe only distinguishable imprint of collapse mechanism lies in the observables\nof tensor sector in the form of modified consistency relation and a blue-tilted\ntensor spectrum only when the collapse parameter $\\delta$ is non-zero and\npositive.\n", "  Within the factorization-assisted topological-amplitude approach, we studied\nthe 33 charmless $B_{(s)} \\to VV$ decays, where $V$ stands for a light vector\nmeson. According to the flavor flows, the amplitude of each process can be\ndecomposed into 8 different topologies. In contrast to the conventional flavor\ndiagrammatic approach, we further factorize each topological amplitude into\ndecay constant, form factors and unknown universal parameters. By $\\chi^2$\nfitting 46 experimental observables, we extracted 10 theoretical parameters\nwith $\\chi^2$ per degree of freedom around 2. Using the fitted parameters, we\ncalculated the branching fractions, polarization fractions, CP asymmetries and\nrelative phases between polarization amplitudes of each decay mode. The decay\nchannels dominated by tree diagram have large branching fractions and large\nlongitudinal polarization fraction. The branching fractions and longitudinal\npolarization fractions of color-suppressed decays become smaller. Current\nexperimental data of large transverse polarization fractions in the penguin\ndominant decay channels can be explained by only one transverse amplitude of\npenguin annihilation diagram. Our predictions of those not yet measured\nchannels can be tested in the ongoing LHCb experiment and the Belle-II\nexperiment in future.\n", "  Hamiltonians that are multivalued functions of momenta are of topical\ninterest since they correspond to the Lagrangians containing higher-degree time\nderivatives. Incidentally, such classes of branched Hamiltonians lead to\ncertain not too well understood ambiguities in the procedure of quantization.\nWithin this framework, we pick up a model that samples the latter ambiguities\nand simultaneously turns out to be amenable to a transparent analytic and\nperturbative treatment.\n", "  We consider a gaugino-mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario where in\naddition to the gauginos the Higgs fields couple directly to the field that\nbreaks supersymmetry. This yields non-vanishing trilinear scalar couplings in\ngeneral, which can lead to large mixing in the stop sector providing a\nsufficiently large Higgs mass. Using the most recent release of FeynHiggs, we\nshow the implications on the parameter space. Assuming a gravitino LSP, we find\nallowed points with a neutralino, sneutrino or stau NLSP. We test these points\nagainst the results of Run 1 of the LHC, considering in particular searches for\nheavy stable charged particles.\n", "  We study the interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and strong p-wave\ninteraction to the scattering property of spin-1/2 ultracold Fermi gases. Based\non a two-channel square-well potential generating p-wave resonance, we show\nthat the presence of an isotropic SOC, even for its length much longer than the\npotential range, can greatly modify the p-wave short-range boundary\ncondition(BC). As a result, the conventional p-wave BC cannot predict the\ninduced molecules near p-wave resonance, which can be fully destroyed to vanish\ndue to strong interference between s- and p-wave channels. By analyzing the\nintrinsic reasons for the breakdown of conventional BC, we propose a new p-wave\nBC that can excellently reproduce the exact molecule solutions and also equally\napply for a wide class of single-particle potentials besides SOC. This work\nreveals the significant effect of SOC to both the short- and long-range\nproperties of fermions near p-wave resonance, paving the way for future\nexploring interesting few- and many-body physics in such system.\n", "  The Raychaudhuri equation for null rays is a powerful tool for finding\nconsistent embeddings of cosmological bubbles into a background spacetime in a\nway that is largely independent of the matter content. We find that spatially\nflat or positively curved thin wall bubbles surrounded by a cosmological\nbackground must have a Hubble expansion that is either contracting or expanding\nslower than the background, which are more stringent constraints than those\nobtained by the usual Israel thin-wall formalism. Similarly, a cosmological\nbubble surrounded by Schwarzschild space, occasionally used as a simple \"swiss\ncheese\" model of inhomogenities in an expanding universe, must be contracting\n(for spatially flat and positively curved bubbles) and bounded in size by the\napparent horizon.\n", "  The potential behind the horizon of an eternal black hole in classical\ntheories is described in terms of data that is available to an external\nobserver -- the reflection coefficient of a wave that scatters on the black\nhole. In GR and perturbative string theory (in $\\alpha'$), the potential is\nregular at the horizon and it blows up at the singularity. The exact reflection\ncoefficient, that is known for the $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$ black hole and\nincludes non-perturbative $\\alpha'$ effects, seems however to imply that there\nis a highly non-trivial structure just behind the horizon.\n", "  Familiar factorized descriptions of classic QCD processes such as\ndeeply-inelastic scattering (DIS) apply in the limit of very large hard scales,\nmuch larger than nonperturbative mass scales and other nonperturbative physical\nproperties like intrinsic transverse momentum. Since many interesting DIS\nstudies occur at kinematic regions where the hard scale, $Q \\sim$ 1-2 GeV, is\nnot very much greater than the hadron masses involved, and the Bjorken scaling\nvariable $x_{bj}$ is large, $x_{bj} \\gtrsim 0.5$, it is important to examine\nthe boundaries of the most basic factorization assumptions and assess whether\nimproved starting points are needed. Using an idealized field-theoretic model\nthat contains most of the essential elements that a factorization derivation\nmust confront, we retrace the steps of factorization approximations and compare\nwith calculations that keep all kinematics exact. We examine the relative\nimportance of such quantities as the target mass, light quark masses, and\nintrinsic parton transverse momentum, and argue that a careful accounting of\nparton virtuality is essential for treating power corrections to collinear\nfactorization. We use our observations to motivate searches for new or enhanced\nfactorization theorems specifically designed to deal with moderately low-$Q$\nand large-$x_{bj}$ physics.\n", "  Recently a scheme has been proposed for generating the 2D Rashba-type\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) for ultracold atomic bosons in a bilayer geometry\n[S.-W. Su et al, Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{93}, 053630 (2016)]. Here we investigate\nthe superfluidity properties of a degenerate Fermi gas affected by the SOC in\nsuch a bilayer system. We demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov\n(FFLO) state appears in the regime of small to moderate atom-light coupling. In\ncontrast to the ordinary SOC, the FFLO state emerges in the bilayer system\nwithout adding any external fields or spin polarization. As the atom-light\ncoupling increases, the system can transit from the FFLO state to a topological\nsuperfluid state. These findings are also confirmed by the BdG simulations with\na weak harmonic trap added.\n", "  We perform Zeeman spectroscopy on a Rydberg electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) system in a room-temperature Cs vapor cell, in magnetic\nfields up to 50~Gauss and for several polarization configurations. The magnetic\ninteractions of the $\\vert 6S_{1/2}, F_g=4 \\rangle$ ground, $\\vert 6P_{3/2},\nF_e=5 \\rangle$ intermediate, and $\\vert 33S_{1/2} \\rangle$ Rydberg states that\nform the ladder-type EIT system are in the linear Zeeman, quadratic Zeeman, and\nthe deep hyperfine Paschen-Back regimes, respectively. Starting in magnetic\nfields of about 5~Gauss, the spectra develop an asymmetry that becomes\nparamount in fields $\\gtrsim40$~Gauss. We use a quantum Monte Carlo\nwave-function approach to quantitatively model the spectra. Simulated spectra\nare in good agreement with experimental data. The asymmetry in the spectra is,\nin part, due to level shifts caused by the quadratic Zeeman effect, but it also\nreflects the complicated interplay between optical pumping and EIT in the\nmagnetic field. Relevance to measurement applications is discussed. %The\nsimulations are also used to study optical pumping in the magnetic field and to\ninvestigate the interplay between optical pumping and EIT, which reduces photon\nscattering and optical pumping.\n", "  We study the conductance of a junction between the normal and superconducting\nsegments of a nanowire, both of which are subjected to spin-orbit coupling and\nan external magnetic field. We directly compare the transport properties of the\nnanowire assuming two different models for the superconducting segment: one\nwhere we put superconductivity by hand into the wire, and one where\nsuperconductivity is induced through a tunneling junction with a bulk s-wave\nsuperconductor. While these two models are equivalent at low energies and at\nweak coupling between the nanowire and the superconductor, we show that there\nare several interesting qualitative differences away from these two limits. In\nparticular, the tunneling model introduces an additional conductance peak at\nthe energy corresponding to the bulk gap of the parent superconductor. By\nemploying a combination of analytical methods at zero temperature and numerical\nmethods at finite temperature, we show that the tunneling model of the\nproximity effect reproduces many more of the qualitative features that are seen\nexperimentally in such a nanowire system.\n", "  We propose a new computational method of the Loschmidt amplitude in a generic\nspin system on the basis of the complex semiclassical analysis on the\nspin-coherent state path integral. We demonstrate how the dynamical transitions\nemerge in the time evolution of the Loschmidt amplitude for the infinite-range\ntransverse Ising model with a longitudinal field, exposed by a quantum quench\nof the transverse field $\\Gamma$ from $\\infty$ or $0$. For both initial\nconditions, we obtain the dynamical phase diagrams that show the presence or\nabsence of the dynamical transition in the plane of transverse field after a\nquantum quench and the longitudinal field. The results of semiclassical\nanalysis are verified by numerical experiments. Experimental observation of our\nfindings on the dynamical transition is also discussed.\n", "  We investigate the proximity effect in junctions between $N=3$\nsuperconductors under commensurate voltage bias. The bias is chosen to\nhighlight the role of transport processes that exchange multiple Cooper pairs\ncoherently between more than two superconductors. Such non-local processes can\nbe studied in the dc response, where local transport processes do not\ncontribute. We focus on the proximity-induced normal density of states that we\ninvestigate in a wide parameter space. We reveal the presence of deep and\nhighly tunable pseudogaps and other rich structures. These are due to a static\nproximity effect that is absent for $N=2$ and is sensitive to an emergent\nsuperconducting phase associated to non-local coherent transport. In comparison\nwith results for $N=2$, we find similarities in the signature peaks of multiple\nAndreev reflections. We discuss the effect of electron-hole decoherence and of\nvarious types of junction asymmetries. Our predictions can be investigated\nexperimentally using tunneling spectroscopy.\n", "  We propose a reformulation of quantum field theory (QFT) as a relativistic\nstatistical field theory. This rewriting embeds a collapse model within an\ninteracting QFT and thus provides a possible solution to the measurement\nproblem. Additionally, it relaxes structural constraints on standard QFTs and\nhence might open the way to future mathematically rigorous constructions as\nwell as new numerical methods. Finally, because it shows that collapse models\ncan be hidden within QFTs, this article calls for a reconsideration of the\ndynamical program, as a possible underpinning rather than as a modification of\nquantum theory.\n", "  During the accretion phase of a core-collapse supernovae, large amplitude\nturbulence is generated by the combination of the standing accretion shock\ninstability and convection driven by neutrino heating. The turbulence directly\naffects the dynamics of the explosion, but there is also the possibility of an\nadditional, indirect, feedback mechanism due to the effect turbulence can have\nupon neutrino flavor evolution and thus the neutrino heating. In this paper we\nconsider the effect of turbulence during the accretion phase upon neutrino\nevolution, both numerically and analytically. Adopting representative supernova\nprofiles taken from the accretion phase of a supernova simulation, we find the\nnumerical calculations exhibit no effect from turbulence. We explain this\nabsence using two analytic descriptions: the Stimulated Transition model and\nthe Distorted Phase Effect model. In the Stimulated Transition model turbulence\neffects depend upon six different lengthscales, and three criteria must be\nsatisfied between them if one is to observe a change in the flavor evolution\ndue to Stimulated Transition. We further demonstrate that the Distorted Phase\nEffect depends upon the presence of multiple semi-adiabatic MSW resonances or\ndiscontinuities that also can be expressed as a relationship between three of\nthe same lengthscales. When we examine the supernova profiles used in the\nnumerical calculations we find the three Stimulated Transition criteria cannot\nbe satisfied, independent of the form of the turbulence power spectrum, and\nthat the same supernova profiles lack the multiple semi-adiabatic MSW\nresonances or discontinuities necessary to produce a Distorted Phase Effect.\nThus we conclude that even though large amplitude turbulence is present in\nsupernova during the accretion phase, it has no effect upon neutrino flavor\nevolution.\n", "  The dynamics of interacting quantum vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional\nspatially inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, whose equilibrium density\nvanishes at two points of the plane with a possible presence of an immobile\nvortex with a few circulation quanta at each point, has been considered in a\nhydrodynamic approximation. A special class of density profiles has been\nchosen, so that it proves possible to calculate analytically the velocity field\nproduced by point vortices. The equations of motion have been given in a\nnoncanonical Hamiltonian form. The theory has been generalized to the case\nwhere the condensate forms a curved quasi-two-dimensional shell in the\nthree-dimensional space.\n", "  Colloidal particles, amphiphiles, and functionalized nanoparticles are\nexamples of systems that frequently exhibit short-range attractions coupled\nwith long-range repulsions. In this work, we observe striking differences in\nthe dynamics of self-assembled clusters that form in a simple isotropic model\nof such systems when the strength of attraction is varied. We find that while\nattraction-dominated particles self-assemble into compact clusters with\nproperties similar to micelles formed by amphiphilic molecules,\nrepulsion-dominated particles self-assemble into open clusters which have much\nshorter life-times. There is also a significantly different dependence of the\nsolution osmotic pressure versus composition: formation of compact clusters\ncauses a decrease in the pressure vs. density slope, while formation of open\nclusters does not effect the pressure. This thermodynamic quantity turns out to\nbe much more sensitive in picking out different clustering characteristics than\nthe overall aggregation curves or cluster shapes. Our results have significant\nimplications in developing design principles for stable cluster self-assembly\nand detection in both laboratory settings and in computer simulations.\n", "  The next generation of very-short-baseline reactor experiments will require\ncompact detectors operating at surface level and close to a nuclear reactor.\nThis paper presents a new detector concept based on a composite solid\nscintillator technology. The detector target uses cubes of polyvinyltoluene\ninterleaved with $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) phosphor screens to detect the products of the\ninverse beta decay reaction. A multi-tonne detector system built from these\nindividual cells can provide precise localisation of scintillation signals,\nmaking efficient use of the detector volume. Monte Carlo simulations indicate\nthat a neutron capture efficiency of over 70% is achievable with a sufficient\nnumber of $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screens per cube and that an appropriate segmentation\nenables a measurement of the positron energy which is not limited by gamma-ray\nleakage. First measurements of a single cell indicate that a very good\nneutron-gamma discrimination and high neutron detection efficiency can be\nobtained with adequate triggering techniques. The light yield from positron\nsignals has been measured, showing that an energy resolution of\n14%/$\\sqrt{E({\\mathrm{MeV}})}$ is achievable with high uniformity. A\npreliminary neutrino signal analysis has been developed, using selection\ncriteria for pulse shape, energy, time structure and energy spatial\ndistribution and showing that an antineutrino efficiency of 40% can be\nachieved. It also shows that the fine segmentation of the detector can be used\nto significantly decrease both correlated and accidental backgrounds.\n", "  A measurement of the top quark mass is reported in events containing a single\ntop quark produced via the electroweak t channel. The analysis is performed\nusing data from proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector at the\nLHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. Top quark candidates are reconstructed\nfrom their decay to a W boson and a b quark, with the W boson decaying\nleptonically to a muon and a neutrino. The final state signature and kinematic\nproperties of single top quark events in the t channel are used to enhance the\npurity of the sample, suppressing the contribution from top quark pair\nproduction. A fit to the invariant mass distribution of reconstructed top quark\ncandidates yields a value of the top quark mass of 172.95 +/- 0.77 (stat)\n+0.97/-0.93 (syst) GeV. This result is in agreement with the current world\naverage, and represents the first measurement of the top quark mass in event\ntopologies not dominated by top quark pair production, therefore contributing\nto future averages with partially uncorrelated systematic uncertainties and a\nlargely uncorrelated statistical uncertainty.\n", "  We show, under a very general set of assumptions, that pairs of identical\nparticle detectors in spacelike separation, such as atomic probes, can only\nharvest entanglement from the vacuum state of a quantum field when they have a\nnon-zero energy gap. Furthermore, we show that degenerate probes are strongly\nchallenged to become entangled through their interaction through scalar and\nelectromagnetic fields even in full light-contact. We relate these results to\nprevious literature on remote entanglement generation and entanglement\nharvesting, giving insight into the energy gap's protective role against local\nnoise, which prevents the detectors from getting entangled through the\ninteraction with the field.\n", "  We study the transport properties of strongly interacting matter in the\ncontext of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision experiments. We calculate the\ntransport coefficients viz. shear viscosity ($\\eta$) and electrical\nconductivity ($\\sigma_{\\rm{el}}$) of the quark-gluon plasma phase in the\npresence of momentum anisotropy arising from different expansion rates of the\nmedium in longitudinal and transverse direction. We solve the relativistic\nBoltzmann kinetic equation in relaxation time approximation to calculate the\nshear viscosity and electrical conductivity. The calculations are performed\nwithin the quasiparticle model to estimate these transport coefficients and\ndiscuss the connection between them. We also compare the electrical\nconductivity results calculated from the quasiparticle model with the ideal\ncase. We compare our results with the corresponding results obtained in the\ndifferent lattice as well as model calculations.\n", "  We report the magnetoresistance (MR), Hall effect, and de Haas-van Alphen\n(dHvA) effect studies of the single crystals of tungsten carbide, WC, which is\npredicted to be a new type of topological semimetal with triply degenerate\nnodes. With the magnetic field rotated in the plane perpendicular to the\ncurrent, WC shows field induced metal to insulator like transition and large\nnonsaturating quadratic MR at low temperature. As the magnetic field parallel\nto the current, a pronounced negative longitudinal MR only can be observed when\nthe current flows along the certain direction. Hall effect indicates WC is a\nperfect compensated semimetal, which may be related to the large nonsaturating\nquadratic MR. The analysis of dHvA oscillations reveals that WC is a multiband\nsystem with small cross-sectional areas of Fermi surface and light cyclotron\neffective masses. Our results indicate that WC is an ideal platform to study\nthe recently proposed New Fermions with triply degenerate crossing points.\n", "  The frustrated magnet SrDy$_2$O$_4$ exhibits a field-induced phase with a\nmagnetization plateau at $1/3$ of the saturation value for magnetic fields\napplied along the $b$-axis. We report here a neutron scattering study of the\nnature and symmetry of the magnetic order in this field-induced phase. Below\n$T\\approx 0.5$ K, there are strong hysteretic effects, and the order is short\nor long ranged for zero-field and field cooling, respectively. We find that the\nlong-range ordered magnetic structure within the zig-zag chains is identical to\nthat expected for the one-dimensional axial next-nearest neighbour Ising\n(ANNNI) model in longitudinal field. The long-range ordered structure in field\ncontrasts with the short-range order found at zero field, and is probably\nreached through enhanced quantum fluctuations with increasing fields.\n", "  In this paper we present the Weiberg-Salam-Glashow model of the electroweak\ninteractions. With a specific choice of parameters can be obtained massive Z\nand W$^{\\pm}$ bosons , while keeping the photon massless. These results are\nobtained by breaking the local gauge invariant SU(2)$_L \\times$ U(1)$_Y$\nsymmetry. The same Higgs doublet which generates W$^{\\pm}$ and Z masses is also\nsufficient to give masses to the leptons.\n", "  The recent experimental discovery of three-dimensional (3D) materials hosting\na strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling calls for the theoretical investigation of\ntheir transport properties. Here we study the zero temperature dc conductivity\nof a 3D Rashba metal in the presence of static diluted impurities. We show\nthat, at variance with the two-dimensional case, in 3D systems spin-orbit\ncoupling affects dc charge transport in all density regimes. We find in\nparticular that the effect of spin-orbit interaction strongly depends on the\ndirection of the current, and we show that this yields strongly anisotropic\ntransport characteristics. In the dominant spin-orbit coupling regime where\nonly the lowest band is occupied, the SO-induced conductivity anisotropy is\ngoverned entirely by the anomalous component of the renormalized current. We\npropose that measurements of the conductivity anisotropy in bulk Rashba metals\nmay give a direct experimental assessment of the spin-orbit strength.\n", "  The cuscuton was introduced in the context of cosmology as a field with\ninfinite speed of propagation. It has been claimed to resemble Ho\\v{r}ava\ngravity in a certain limit, and it is a good candidate for an ether theory in\nwhich a time-dependent cosmological constant appears naturally. The analysis of\nits properties is usually performed in the Lagrangian framework, which makes\nissues like the counting of its dynamical degrees of freedom less clear-cut.\nHere we perform a Hamiltonian analysis of the theory. We show that the\nhomogeneous limit with local degrees of freedom has singular behavior in the\nHamiltonian framework. In other frames, it has an extra scalar degree of\nfreedom. The homogeneous field has regular behavior only if defined a priori as\na spatially constant field in a CMC foliation and contributing with a single\nglobal degree of freedom. Lastly, we find conditions on the cuscuton potential\nfor the resulting lapse function to be non-zero throughout evolution.\n", "  In this paper, we study the $B \\to K^*$ transition form factors (TFFs) within\nthe QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSR) approach. Two correlators, i.e. the usual\none and the right-handed one, are adopted in the LCSR calculation. The\nresultant LCSRs for the $B \\to K^*$ TFFs are arranged according to the twist\nstructure of the $K^*$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), whose\ntwist-2, twist-3 and twist-4 terms behave quite differently by using different\ncorrelators. We observe that the twist-4 LCDAs, though generally small, shall\nhave sizable contributions to the TFFs $A_{1/2}$, $V$ and $T_1$, thus the\ntwist-4 terms should be kept for a sound prediction. We also observe that even\nthough different choices of the correlator lead to different LCSRs with\ndifferent twist contributions, the large correlation coefficients for most of\nthe TFFs indicate that the LCSRs for different correlators are close to each\norder, not only for their values at the large recoil point $q^2=0$ but also for\ntheir ascending trends in whole $q^2$-region. Such a high degree of correlation\nis confirmed by their application to the branching fraction of the\nsemi-leptonic decay $B \\to K^* \\mu^+ \\mu^-$. Thus, a proper choice of\ncorrelator may inversely provide a chance for probing uncertain LCDAs, i.e. the\ncontributions from those LCDAs can be amplified to a certain degree via a\nproper choice of correlator, thus amplifying the sensitivity of the TFFs, and\nhence their related observables, to those LCDAs.\n", "  Sensors based on single spins can enable magnetic field detection with very\nhigh sensitivity and spatial resolution. Previous work has concentrated on\nsensing of a constant magnetic field or a periodic signal. Here, we instead\ninvestigate the problem of estimating a field with non-periodic variation\ndescribed by a Wiener process. We propose and study, by numerical simulations,\nan adaptive tracking protocol based on Bayesian estimation. The tracking\nprotocol updates the probability distribution for the magnetic field, based on\nmeasurement outcomes, and adapts the choice of sensing time and phase in real\ntime. By taking the statistical properties of the signal into account, our\nprotocol strongly reduces the required measurement time. This leads to a\nreduction of the error in the estimation of a time-varying signal by up to a\nfactor 4 compared to protocols that do not take this information into account.\n", "  We consider the Kitaev chain model with finite and infinite range in the\nhopping and pairing parameters, looking in particular at the appearance of\nMajorana zero energy modes and massive edge modes. We study the system both in\nthe presence and in the absence of time reversal symmetry, by means of\ntopological invariants and exact diagonalization, disclosing very rich phase\ndiagrams. In particular, for extended hopping and pairing terms, we can get as\nmany Majorana modes at each end of the chain as the neighbors involved in the\ncouplings. Finally we generalize the transfer matrix approach useful to\ncalculate the zero-energy Majorana modes at the edges for a generic number of\ncoupled neighbors.\n", "  The vector charmoniumlike state $Y(4220)$ was reported recently in the cross\nsections of $e^+e^-\\to \\omega \\chi_{c0}$, $\\pi^+\\pi^-h_c$, $\\pi^+\\pi^- J/\\psi$,\nand $D^0 D^{*-}\\pi^+ + c.c.$ measured by the BESIII experiment. A combined fit\nis performed to the cross sections of these four final states to extract the\nresonant parameters of the $Y(4220)$. We determine a mass $M=(4219.6\\pm 3.3\\pm\n5.1)$~MeV/$c^2$ and a total width $\\Gamma=(56.0\\pm 3.6\\pm 6.9)$~MeV for the\n$Y(4220)$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones\nsystematic. Assuming the $Y(4220)$ decays dominantly to the above four modes\nand their isospin symmetric modes, we also estimate its leptonic decay width\nand decay branching fractions. These information is essential for the\nunderstanding of the nature of this state.\n", "  Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is a theoretically well-motivated\nalternative theory of gravity emerging as a low-energy 4-dimensional model from\nheterotic string theory. Its rotating black hole solutions are known\nnumerically and can have macroscopic deviations from the Kerr black holes of\nEinstein's gravity. Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity can thus be tested\nwith observations of astrophysical black holes. In the present paper, we\nsimulate observations of the reflection spectrum of thin accretion disks with\npresent and future X-ray facilities to understand whether X-ray reflection\nspectroscopy can distinguish the black holes in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity from those in Einstein's gravity. We find that this is definitively out\nof reach for present X-ray missions, but it may be achieved with the next\ngeneration of facilities.\n", "  The vector potential operator, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol A}$, is transformed and\nrewritten in terms of cosine and sine functions in order to get a clear picture\nof how the photon states relate to the $\\boldsymbol A$ field. The phase\noperator, defined by $\\hat E = \\exp(-i \\hat \\phi)$, is derived from this\npicture. The result has a close resemblance with the known Susskind-Glogower\n(SG) operator, which is given by $\\hat E_{SG}=(\\hat a_{\\boldsymbol k} \\hat\na_{\\boldsymbol k}^\\dagger)^{-1/2} \\hat a_{\\boldsymbol k}$. It will be shown\nthat $\\hat a_{\\boldsymbol k}$ should be replaced by $(\\hat a_{\\boldsymbol k} +\n\\hat a_{-\\boldsymbol k}^\\dagger)$ instead to yield $\\hat E = ((\\hat\na_{\\boldsymbol k} + \\hat a_{-\\boldsymbol k}^\\dagger ) (\\hat a_{\\boldsymbol\nk}^\\dagger + \\hat a_{-\\boldsymbol k}))^{-1/2} (\\hat a_{\\boldsymbol k} + \\hat\na_{-\\boldsymbol k}^\\dagger)$, which makes the operator unitary. $\\hat E$ will\nalso be analyzed when restricted to the space of only forward moving photons\nwith wave vector $\\boldsymbol k$. The resulting phase operator, $\\hat E_+$,\nwill turn out to resemble the SG operator as well, but with a small correction:\nWhereas $E_{SG}$ can be equivalently written as $\\hat E_{SG} =\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |n\\rangle \\langle n+1 |$, the operator, $\\hat E_+$, is\ninstead given by $\\hat E_+ = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n |n \\rangle \\langle n+1|$,\nwhere $a_n = (n+1/2)!/(n! \\sqrt{n+1})$. The sequence, $(a_n)_{n \\in \\lbrace 0,\n1, 2, \\ldots \\rbrace}$, converges to $1$ from below for $n$ going to infinity.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate the enhancement in the filtering\nquality (Q) factor of an integrated micro-ring resonator (MRR) by embedding it\nin an integrated Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity formed by cascaded Sagnac loop\nreflectors (SLRs). By utilizing coherent interference within the FP cavity to\nreshape the transmission spectrum of the MRR, both the Q factor and the\nextinction ratio (ER) can be significantly improved. The device is\ntheoretically analyzed, and practically fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator\n(SOI) wafer. Experimental results show that up to 11-times improvement in Q\nfactor, together with an 8-dB increase in ER, can be achieved via our proposed\nmethod. The impact of varying structural parameters on the device performance\nis also investigated and verified by the measured spectra of the fabricated\ndevices with different structural parameters.\n", "  Analyzing temperature dependent photoemission (PE) data of the ferromagnetic\nKondo-lattice (KL) system YbNiSn in the light of the Periodic Anderson model\n(PAM) we show that the KL behavior is not limited to temperatures below a\ntemperature T_K, defined empirically from resistivity and specificic heat\nmeasurements. As characteristic for weakly hybridized Ce and Yb systems, the PE\nspectra reveal a 4f-derived Fermi level peak, which reflects contributions from\nthe Kondo resonance and its crystal electric field (CEF) satellites. In YbNiSn\nthis peak has an unusual temperature dependence: With decreasing temperature a\nsteady linear increase of intensity is observed which extends over a large\ninterval ranging from 100 K down to 1 K without showing any peculiarities in\nthe region of T_K ~ TC= 5.6 K. In the light of the single-impurity Anderson\nmodel (SIAM) this intensity variation reflects a linear increase of 4f\noccupancy with decreasing temperature, indicating an onset of Kondo screening\nat temperatures above 100 K. Within the PAM this phenomenon could be described\nby a non-Fermi liquid like T- linear damping of the self-energy which accounts\nphenomenologically for the feedback from the closely spaced CEF-states.\n", "  Fully understanding a chemical reaction on the quantum level is a\nlong-standing goal in physics and chemistry. Experimental investigation of such\nstate-to-state chemistry requires both the preparation of the reactants and the\ndetection of the products in a quantum state resolved way, which has been a\nlong term challenge. Using the high level control in the ultracold domain, we\nprepare a few-body quantum state of reactants and demonstrate state-to-state\nchemistry with unprecedented resolution. We present measurements and\naccompanying theoretical analysis for the recombination of three spin-polarized\nultracold Rb atoms forming a weakly bound Rb$_2$ dimer. Detailed insights of\nthe reaction process are obtained that suggest propensity rules for the\ndistribution of reaction products. The scheme can readily be adapted to other\nspecies and opens a door to detailed investigations of inelastic or reactive\nprocesses in domains never before accessible.\n", "  We have developed a generalized electronic phase separation model of\nhigh-temperature cuprate superconductors that links the two distinct energy\nscales of the superconducting (SC) and pseudogap (PG) phases via a\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) state. We show that simulated electronic-density\nmodulations resembling the charge order (CO) modulations detected in cuprates\nintertwine the SC and charge orders by localizing charge and providing the\nenergy scale for a spatially periodic SC attractive potential. Bulk\nsuperconductivity is achieved with the inclusion of Josephson coupling between\nnanoscale domains of intertwined fluctuating CDW and SC orders, and local SC\nphase fluctuations give rise to the Fermi arcs along the nodal directions of\nthe SC gap. We demonstrate the validity of the model by reproducing the\nhole-doping dependence of the PG onset temperature $T^*$, and the SC transition\ntemperature $T_c$ of ${\\rm YBa_2Cu_3O_y}$ and ${\\rm\nBi_{2-y}Pb_ySr_{2-z}La_zCuO_{6+\\delta}}$. The results show that the periodicity\nof the CDW order is controlled by the PG energy scale, and the hole-doping\ndependence of the SC energy gap is controlled by the charge ordering free\nenergy.\n", "  AlGaN plays a vital role in hetero-structure high electron mobility\ntransistor by employing a two-dimensional electron gas and as electron blocking\nlayer in the multi quantum well light emitting diodes. Nevertheless, the\nincorporation of Al in GaN for the formation of AlGaN alloy is limited by the\ndiffusion barrier formed by instant nitridation of Al adatoms by reactive\natomic N. Incorporation of Al above the miscibility limit, however can be\nachieved by ion beam technique. The well known ion beam mixing (IBM) technique\nwas carried out with the help of Ar+ irradiation for different fluences. A\nnovel approach was also adopted for the synthesis of AlGaN by the process of\npost irradiation diffusion (PID) as a comparative study with the IBM technique.\nThe optical investigations of AlGaN nanowires, synthesized via two different\nmethods of ion beam processing are reported. The effect of irradiation fluence\nand post irradiation annealing temperature on the random alloy formation were\nstudied by the vibrational and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic studies.\nVibrational studies show one-mode phonon behavior corresponding to longitudinal\noptical (LO) mode of A1 symmetry (A1(LO)) for the wurtzite phase of AlGaN\nnanowires in the random alloy model. Maximum Al atomic percentage ~6.3-6.7% was\ncalculated with the help of band bowing formalism from the Raman spectral\nanalysis for samples synthesized in IBM and PID processes. PL studies show the\nextent of defects present in these samples.\n", "  In this paper we present the state of the art about the quarks: group SU(3),\nLie algebra, the electric charge and mass. The quarks masses are generated in\nthe same way as the lepton masses. It is constructed a term in the Lagrangian\nthat couples the Higgs doublet to the fermion fields.\n", "  The study of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase argon is relevant\nin the field of noble-gas liquid detectors for dark matter search and\nlow-energy neutrino experiments. In this work, we continued to study\nproportional electroluminescence (EL) in two-phase argon doped with a minor (9\nppm) admixture of nitrogen, in the VUV, UV and visible spectral ranges. We\nconfirmed the effect of enhancement of the EL yield, as well as the presence of\nnon-VUV component in addition to that of VUV, in proportional\nelectroluminescence in two-phase Ar. On the other hand, the contribution of\nnon-VUV component determined here within the model of N2 emission in the UV,\nturned out to be insufficient to explain the EL yield enhancement effect.\nAccordingly, the problem of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase Ar\nremains unresolved.\n", "  We investigate the transverse charge density in the longitudinally as well as\ntransversely polarized deuteron using the recent empirical description of the\ndeuteron electromagnetic form factors in the framework of holographic QCD. The\npredictions of the holographic QCD are compared with the results of a standard\nphenomenological parameterization. In addition, we evaluate GPDs and the\ngravitational form factors for the deuteron. The longitudinal momentum\ndensities are also investigated in the transverse plane.\n", "  In this work, a way starting from beta function is presented for obtaining\nwell-defined coupling constant in UV and IR region. In the approach presented\nhere, obvious singularity is removed, and asymptotic behaviour is reserved\nfully and manifestly. Also it's shown that the freezed coupling constant is\nindependent of dimensional parameters $\\Lambda$ and not sensitive to\nhigher-loop corrections and renormalization scheme adopted. A non-dimensional\nfunction of energy scale is introduced to play the role of \"fine tuning\".\n", "  To realize one desired nonadiabatic holonomic gate, various equivalent\nevolution paths can be chosen. However, in the presence of errors, these paths\nbecome inequivalent. In this paper, we investigate the difference of these\nevolution paths in the presence of systematic Rabi frequency errors and aim to\nfind paths with optimal robustness to realize one-qubit nonadiabatic holonomic\ngates. We focus on three types of evolution paths in the $\\Lambda$ system:\npaths belonging to the original two-loop scheme [New J. Phys. {\\bf 14}, 103035\n(2012)], the single-loop multiple-pulse scheme [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 94}, 052310\n(2016)], and the off-resonant single-shot scheme [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 92}, 052302\n(2015); Phys. Lett. A {\\bf 380}, 65 (2016)]. Whereas both the single-loop\nmultiple-pulse and single-shot schemes aim to improve the robustness of the\noriginal two-loop scheme by shortening the exposure to decoherence, we here\nfind that the two-loop scheme is more robust to systematic errors in the Rabi\nfrequencies. More importantly, we derive conditions under which the resilience\nto this kind of error can be optimized, thereby strengthening the robustness of\nnonadiabatic holonomic gates.\n", "  Lucus Planum, extending for a radius of approximately 500 km around 181{\\deg}\nE, 5{\\deg} S, is part of the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF), a set of several\ndiscontinuous deposits of fine-grained, friable material straddling across the\nMartian highland-lowland boundary. The MFF has been variously hypothesized to\nconsist of pyroclastic flows, pyroclastic airfall, paleopolar deposits, or\natmospherically-deposited icy dust driven by climate cycles. MARSIS, a\nlow-frequency subsurface-sounding radar carried by ESA's Mars Express, acquired\n238 radar swaths across Lucus Planum, providing sufficient coverage for the\nstudy of its internal structure and dielectric properties. Subsurface\nreflections were found only in three areas, marked by a distinctive surface\nmorphology, while the central part of Lucus Planum appears to be made of\nradar-attenuating material preventing the detection of basal echoes. The bulk\ndielectric properties of these areas were estimated and compared with those of\nvolcanic rocks and ice-dust mixtures. Previous interpretations that east Lucus\nPlanum and the deposits on the north-western flanks of Apollinaris Patera\nconsist of high-porosity pyroclastic material are strongly supported by the new\nresults. The north-western part of Lucus Planum is likely to be much less\nporous, although interpretations about the nature of the subsurface materials\nare not conclusive. The exact origin of the deposits cannot be constrained by\nradar data alone, but our results for east Lucus Planum are consistent with an\noverall pyroclastic origin, likely linked to Tharsis Hesperian and Amazonian\nactivity.\n", "  I give a pedagogical discussion of thermal dark matter (DM) within the\nclockwork mechanism. The clockwork mechanism, which is a natural way to\ngenerate small numbers starting from order-one couplings, allows to have a\nlong-lived, but unstable, DM particle that nevertheless has O(1) couplings with\nelectroweak- or TeV-scale states. Remarkably, DM decays on time scales much\nlonger than the age of the Universe and has at the same time sizeable couplings\nwith light states, which therefore allow to produce it thermally within the\nWIMP paradigm. These new particles with large couplings can be searched for at\ncurrent or future colliders. I also briefly comment on how this setup can\nminimally emerge from the deconstruction of an extra dimension in flat\nspacetime.\n", "  The interaction of two electrons and two positrons in the field of two strong\npulsed laser waves outside the framework of the dipole approximation (with an\naccuracy of relativistic corrections ) has been studied theoretically. The\npossibility of significant asymmetry in the interactions of particles and\nantiparticles in the external laser fields is shown. This asymmetry of\ninteractions essentially depends on the magnitude and sign of the phase shifts\nof the waves relative to each other, and also on the intensities of the waves.\nThe ranges of phase shifts and field intensities in which the interaction of\nelectrons and positrons have qualitatively different character from anomalous\nrepulsion to attraction are determined.\n", "  We present a model of contagion that unifies and generalizes existing models\nof the spread of social influences and micro-organismal infections. Our model\nincorporates individual memory of exposure to a contagious entity (e.g., a\nrumor or disease), variable magnitudes of exposure (dose sizes), and\nheterogeneity in the susceptibility of individuals. Through analysis and\nsimulation, we examine in detail the case where individuals may recover from an\ninfection and then immediately become susceptible again (analogous to the\nso-called SIS model). We identify three basic classes of contagion models which\nwe call \\textit{epidemic threshold}, \\textit{vanishing critical mass}, and\n\\textit{critical mass} classes, where each class of models corresponds to\ndifferent strategies for prevention or facilitation. We find that the\nconditions for a particular contagion model to belong to one of the these three\nclasses depend only on memory length and the probabilities of being infected by\none and two exposures respectively. These parameters are in principle\nmeasurable for real contagious influences or entities, thus yielding empirical\nimplications for our model. We also study the case where individuals attain\npermanent immunity once recovered, finding that epidemics inevitably die out\nbut may be surprisingly persistent when individuals possess memory.\n", "  Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) foams consist of monolayers of bubbles\nsqueezed between two narrowly spaced plates. These simplified foams have served\nsuccessfully in the past to shed light on numerous issues in foam physics. Here\nwe consider the electrical conductivity of such model foams. We compare\nexperiments to a model which we propose, and which successfully relates the\nstructural and the conductive properties of the foam over the full range of the\ninvestigated liquid content. We show in particular that in the case of quasi-2D\nfoams the liquid in the nodes needs to be taken into account even at low liquid\ncontent. We think that these results may provide different approaches for the\ncharacterization of foam properties and for the in situ characterization of the\nliquid content of foams in confining geometries, such as microfluidics\n", "  In a project aimed at measuring the optical Extragalactic Background Light\n(EBL) we are using the shadow of a dark cloud.We have performed, with the ESO\nVLT/FORS, spectrophotometry of the surface brightness towards the\nhigh-galactic-latitude dark cloud Lynds 1642. A spectrum representing the\ndifference between the opaque core of the cloud and several unobscured\npositions around the cloud was presented in Paper I (Mattila et al. 2017a). The\ntopic of the present paper is the separation of the scattered starlight from\nthe dark cloud itself which is the only remaining foreground component in this\ndifference. While the scattered starlight spectrum has the characteristic\nFraunhofer lines and the discontinuity at 400 nm, typical of integrated light\nof galaxies, the EBL spectrum is a smooth one without these features. As\ntemplate for the scattered starlight we make use of the spectra at two\nsemi-transparent positions. The resulting EBL intensity at 400 nm is $I_{\\rm\nEBL} = 2.9\\pm1.1$ $10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$\\AA$^{-1}$, or\n$11.6\\pm4.4$ nW m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$, which represents a 2.6$\\sigma$ detection;\nthe scaling uncertainty is +20%/-16%. At 520 nm we have set a 2$\\sigma$ upper\nlimit of $I_{\\rm EBL} \\le$4.5 $10^{-9}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$\\AA$^{-1}$ or $\\le$23.4 nW m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$\n+20%/-16%. Our EBL value at 400 nm is $\\ge 2$ times as high as the integrated\nlight of galaxies. No known diffuse light sources, such as light from Milky Way\nhalo, intra-cluster or intra-group stars appear capable of explaining the\nobserved EBL excess over the integrated light of galaxies.\n", "  We present the classification of 26 optical counterparts to X-ray sources\ndiscovered in the Galactic Bulge Survey. We use (time-resolved) photometric and\nspectroscopic observations to classify the X-ray sources based on their\nmulti-wavelength properties. We find a variety of source classes, spanning\ndifferent phases of stellar/binary evolution. We classify CX21 as a quiescent\ncataclysmic variable (CV) below the period gap, and CX118 as a high accretion\nrate (nova-like) CV. CXB12 displays excess UV emission, and could contain a\ncompact object with a giant star companion, making it a candidate symbiotic\nbinary or quiescent low mass X-ray binary (although other scenarios cannot be\nruled out). CXB34 is a magnetic CV (polar) that shows photometric evidence for\na change in accretion state. The magnetic classification is based on the\ndetection of X-ray pulsations with a period of 81 $\\pm$ 2 min. CXB42 is\nidentified as a young stellar object, namely a weak-lined T Tauri star\nexhibiting (to date unexplained) UX Ori-like photometric variability. The\noptical spectrum of CXB43 contains two (resolved) unidentified double-peaked\nemission lines. No known scenario, such as an AGN or symbiotic binary, can\neasily explain its characteristics. We additionally classify 20 objects as\nlikely active stars based on optical spectroscopy, their X-ray to optical flux\nratios and photometric variability. In 4 cases we identify the sources as\nbinary stars.\n", "  Motion of short-period stars orbiting the supermassive black hole in our\nGalactic Center has been monitored for more than 20 years. These observations\nare currently offering a new way to test the gravitational theory in an\nunexplored regime: in a strong gravitational field, around a supermassive black\nhole. In this proceeding, we present three results: (i) a constraint on a\nhypothetical fifth force obtained by using 19 years of observations of the two\nbest measured short-period stars S0-2 and S0-38 ; (ii) an upper limit on the\nsecular advance of the argument of the periastron for the star S0-2 ; (iii) a\nsensitivity analysis showing that the relativistic redshift of S0-2 will be\nmeasured after its closest approach to the black hole in 2018.\n", "  We present deep dual-band 5.0 and 8.4GHz European VLBI Network (EVN)\nobservations of NGC1614, a local luminous infrared galaxy with a powerful\ncircumnuclear starburst ring, and whose nuclear engine origin is still\ncontroversial. We aim at detecting and characterizing compact radio structures\nboth in the nuclear region and in the circumnuclear ring. We do not find any\ncompact source in the central 200pc region, setting a very tight 5 sigma upper\nlimit of $3.7\\times10^{36}$erg s$^{-1}$ and $5.8\\times10^{36}$erg s$^{-1}$, at\n5.0 and 8.4GHz, respectively. However, we report a clear detection at both\nfrequencies of a compact structure in the circumnuclear ring, 190pc to the\nnorth of the nucleus, whose luminosity and spectral index are compatible with a\ncore-collapse supernova, giving support to the high star formation rate in the\nring. Our result favors the pure starburst scenario, even for the nucleus of\nNGC1614, and shows the importance of radio VLBI observations when dealing with\nthe obscured environments of dusty galaxies.\n", "  Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) as one of major avoidable occupational\nrelated health issues has been studied for decades. To assess NIHL, the\nexcitation pattern (EP) has been considered as one of mechanisms to estimate\nmovements of basilar membrane (BM) in cochlea. In this study, two auditory\nfilters, dual resonance nonlinear (DRNL) filter and rounded-exponential (ROEX)\nfilter, have been applied to create two EPs, referring as the velocity EP and\nthe loudness EP, respectively. Two noise hazard metrics are also proposed based\non the developed EPs to evaluate hazardous levels caused by different types of\nnoise. Moreover, Gaussian noise and pure-tone noise have been simulated to\nevaluate performances of the developed EPs and noise metrics. The results show\nthat both developed EPs can reflect the responses of BM to different types of\nnoise. For Gaussian noise, there is a frequency shift between the velocity EP\nand the loudness EP. For pure-tone noise, both EPs can reflect the frequencies\nof input noise accurately. The results suggest that both EPs can be potentially\nused for assessment of NIHL.\n", "  We prove the orbifold version of Zvonkine's $r$-ELSV formula in two special\ncases: the case of $r=2$ (complete $3$-cycles) for any genus $g\\geq 0$ and the\ncase of any $r\\geq 1$ for genus $g=0$.\n", "  Recently, a proposal has been advanced to detect unconstitutional partisan\ngerrymandering with a simple formula called the efficiency gap. The efficiency\ngap is now working its way towards a possible landmark case in the Supreme\nCourt. This note explores some of its mathematical properties in light of the\nfact that it reduces to a straight proportional comparison of votes to seats.\nThough we offer several critiques, we assess that EG can still be a useful\ncomponent of a courtroom analysis. But a famous formula can take on a life of\nits own and this one will need to be watched closely.\n", "  The resolvent analysis of McKeon & Sharma (2010) recasts the Navier-Stokes\nequations into an input/output form in which the nonlinear term is treated as a\nforcing that acts upon the linear dynamics to yield a velocity response. The\nframework has shown promise with regards to producing low-dimensional\nrepresentations of exact coherent states. Previous work has focused on a\nprimitive variable output; here we show a velocity-vorticity formulation of the\ngoverning equations along with a Helmholtz decomposition of the nonlinear\nforcing term reveals a simplified input/output form in the resolvent analysis.\nThis approach leads to an improved method for compact representations of exact\ncoherent states for both forcing and response fields, with a significant\nreduction in degrees of freedom in comparison to the primitive variable\napproach.\n", "  Anomalous group velocity dispersion is a key parameter for generating bright\nsolitons, and thus wideband Kerr frequency combs. Extension of frequency combs\nto visible wavelength in conventional photonic materials and structures has\nbeen a major challenge due to strong normal material dispersion at the relevant\nfrequencies. Extension of frequency combs toward the normal dispersion region\nis possible via dispersive waves through soliton-induced Cherenkov radiation.\nHowever, this potentially powerful technique has not been used for extending\nfrequency combs to the visible spectrum. In this paper, we demonstrate a new\nmicroresonator structure formed by an over-etched silicon nitride waveguide\nthat enables the use of soliton-induced Cherenkov radiation to extend the\nbandwidth of the Kerr-combs. Furthermore, we show that by careful dispersion\nengineering in a coupled microring resonator structure we can optimize the\nproperties (e.g., wavelength, and amplitude) of the generated dispersive wave\nto further extend the Kerr frequency combs to the visible spectrum while\nincreasing the total Kerr-comb bandwidth as well.\n", "  Superconducting vortices and phase slips are primary mechanisms of\ndissipation in superconducting, superfluid, and cold atom systems. While the\ndynamics of vortices is fairly well described, phase slips occurring in\nquasi-one dimensional superconducting wires still elude understanding. The main\nreason is that phase slips are strongly non-linear time-dependent phenomena\nthat cannot be cast in terms of small perturbations of the superconducting\nstate. Here we study phase slips occurring in superconducting weak links.\nThanks to partial suppression of superconductivity in weak links, we employ a\nweakly nonlinear approximation for dynamic phase slips. This approximation is\nnot valid for homogeneous superconducting wires and slabs. Using the numerical\nsolution of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and bifurcation\nanalysis of stationary solutions, we show that the onset of phase slips occurs\nvia an infinite period bifurcation, which is manifested in a specific\nvoltage-current dependence. Our analytical results are in good agreement with\nsimulations.\n", "  From the early days of many-body physics, it was realized that the\nself-energy governs the relaxation or lifetime of the retarded Green$'$s\nfunction. So it seems reasonable to directly extend those results into the\nnonequilibrium domain. But experiments and calculations of the response of\nquantum materials to a pump show that the relationship between the relaxation\nand the self-energy only holds in special cases. Experimentally, the decay time\nfor a population to relax back to equilibrium and the linewidth measured in a\nlinear-response angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy differ by large\namounts. Theoretically, aside from the weak-coupling regime where the\nrelationship holds, one also finds deviations and additionally one sees\nviolations of Mathiessen$'$s rule. In this work, we examine whether looking at\nan effective transport relaxation time helps to analyze the decay times of\nexcited populations as they relax back to equilibrium. We conclude that it may\ndo a little better, but it has a fitting parameter for the overall scale which\nmust be determined.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate that tomographic measurements can be performed\nfor states of qubits before they are prepared. A variant of the quantum\nteleportation protocol is used as a channel between two instants in time,\nallowing measurements for polarisation states of photons to be implemented 88\nns before they are created. Measurement data taken at the early time and later\nunscrambled according to the results of the protocol's Bell measurements,\nproduces density matrices with an average fidelity of $0.90 \\pm 0.01$ against\nthe ideal states of photons created at the later time. Process tomography of\nthe time-reverse quantum channel finds an average process fidelity of $0.84 \\pm\n0.02$. While our proof-of-principle implementation necessitates some\npost-selection, the general protocol is deterministic and requires no\npost-selection to sift desired states and reject a larger ensemble.\n", "  We consider the inhomogeneous div-curl system (i.e.\\ to find a vector field\nwith prescribed div and curl) in a bounded star-shaped domain in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. An explicit general solution is given in terms of classical\nintegral operators, completing previously known results obtained under\nrestrictive conditions. This solution allows us to solve questions related to\nthe quaternionic main Vekua equation $DW=(Df/f)\\overline W$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$,\nsuch as finding the vector part when the scalar part is known. In addition,\nusing the general solution to the div-curl system and the known existence of\nthe solution of the inhomogeneous conductivity equation, we prove the existence\nof solutions of the inhomogeneous double curl equation, and give an explicit\nsolution for the case of static Maxwell's equations with only variable\npermeability.\n", "  This note supplements a Reply [1] to a Comment [2] which identified a\nfundamental symmetry error we made in the original experimental study of a\nphoton thermal diode [3]. For thermal specialists, here we provide some\nadditional details about the thermal estimate originally used to justify\nomitting the cold-side thermal collimator, and the reasons for its failure.\n  References\n  [1].

Families have different\nproperties such as age, size, taxonomy, collision severity and others, and\nunderstanding the effect of those properties on our observations of the\nsize-frequency distribution (SFD) of family fragments can give us important\ninsights into the hypervelocity collision processes at scales we cannot achieve\nin our laboratories. Here we take as an example the very young Datura family,\nwith a small 8-km parent body, and compare its size distribution to other\nfamilies, with both large and small parent bodies, and created by both\ncatastrophic and cratering formation events. We conclude that most likely\nexplanation for the shallower size distribution compared to larger families is\na more pronounced observational bias because of its small size. Its size\ndistribution is perfectly normal when its parent body size is taken into\naccount. We also discuss some other possibilities. In addition, we study\nanother common feature: an offset or \"bump\" in the distribution occurring for a\nfew of the larger elements. We hypothesize that it can be explained by a newly\ndescribed regime of cratering, \"spall cratering\", which controls the majority\nof impact craters on the surface of small asteroids like Datura.\n", "  We consider a class of one-dimensional compass models with staggered\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interactions in an external transverse magnetic\nfield. Based on the exact solution derived from Jordan-Wigner approach, we\nstudy the excitation gap, energy spectra, spin correlations and critical\nproperties at phase transitions. We explore mutual effects of the staggered\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the magnetic field on the energy spectra\nand the ground-state phase diagram. Thermodynamic quantities including the\nentropy and the specific heat are discussed, and their universal scalings at\nlow temperature are demonstrated.\n", "  A novel delay-time enlarged 3-dimensional gravitational wave (GW) detection\nsystem is presented. The operation principle is described. The basic\nspecification requirements for all the critical components are analyzed. The\nwhole system consists of three optical fibers along three axes, a narrow\nlinewidth ultra-stable laser, an ultra-stable radio frequency (RF) source,\nthree recirculating optical fiber loops, three phase monitoring/stabilizing\nunits, three phase detectors, and a computer based data analysis unit. With the\ngiven specifications of the critical components, the whole system may achieve\n10-22 phase sensitivity, and therefore can be used for the GW detection. This\nis the first time, to the best of our knowledge, one has implemented an optical\nfiber as the delay-time enlarged transmission medium for a self-delayed\ninterferometer and the first 3-dimensional self-delayed interferometer. Since\noptical fiber is used as the transmission medium and the recirculating optical\nfiber loop for increasing the phase sensitivity, the whole system can be built\nboth compactly and cost efficiently, allowing a 3-dimensional self-delayed\ninterferometer for GW detection to be created.\n", "  The catalogue of protoplanetary nebulae by Vickers et al. has been\nsupplemented with the line-of-sight velocities and proper motions of their\ncentral stars from the literature. Based on an exponential density\ndistribution, we have estimated the vertical scale height from objects with an\nage less than 3 Gyr belonging to the Galactic thin disk (luminosities higher\nthan 5000 Lo) to be h=146+/-15 pc, while from a sample of older objects\n(luminosities lower than 5000 Lo) it is h=568+/-42 pc. We have produced a list\nof 147 nebulae in which there are only the line-of-sight velocities for 55\nnebulae, only the proper motions for 25 nebulae, and both line-of-sight\nvelocities and proper motions for 67 nebulae. Based on this kinematic sample,\nwe have estimated the Galactic rotation parameters and the residual velocity\ndispersions of protoplanetary nebulae as a function of their age. We have\nestablished that there is a good correlation between the kinematic properties\nof nebulae and their separation in luminosity proposed by Vickers. Most of the\nnebulae are shown to be involved in the Galactic rotation, with the circular\nrotation velocity at the solar distance being V_0=227+/-23 km/s. The following\nprincipal semiaxes of the residual velocity dispersion ellipsoid have been\nfound: (sigma1, sigma2, sigma3) = (47, 41, 29) km/s from a sample of young\nprotoplanetary nebulae (with luminosities higher than 5000 Lo), (sigma1,\nsigma2, sigma3) = (50, 38, 28) km/s from a sample of older protoplanetary\nnebulae (with luminosities of 4000 Lo or 3500 Lo), and (sigma1, sigma_2,\nsigma3) = (91, 49, 36) km/s from a sample of halo nebulae (with luminosities of\n1700 Lo).\n", "  Problem of long-range sound propagation in the randomly-inhomogeneous deep\nocean is considered. We examine a novel approach for modeling of wave\npropagation, developed by K.C.Hegewisch and S.Tomsovic. This approach relies on\nconstruction of a wavefield propagator using the random matrix theory (RMT). We\nstudy the ability of the RMT-based propagator to reproduce properties of the\npropagator corresponding to direct numerical solution of the parabolic\nequation. It is shown that mode coupling described by the RMT-based propagator\nis basically consistent with the direct Monte-Carlo simulation. The agreement\nis worsened only for relatively short distances, when long-lasting cross-mode\ncorrelations are significant. It is shown that the RMT-based propagator with\nproperly chosen range step can reproduce some coherent features in spectral\nstatistics.\n", "  Nonlinear Bessel beams in self-defocusing media are found to be the natural,\nnon-diffracting background where vortex solitons can be nested, interact and\nsurvive for propagation distances that are one order of magnitude larger than\nin the usual Gaussian or super-Gaussian backgrounds. The dynamics of the vortex\nsolitons approaches that in the ideal, uniform background, preventing vortex\nspiraling and decay, which eases vortex steering for applications.\n", "  The continuum limit of loop quantum gravity is still an open problem. Indeed,\nno proper dynamics in known to start with and we still lack the mathematical\ntools to study its would-be continuum limit. In the present PhD dissertation,\nwe will investigate some coarse-graining methods that should become helpful in\nthis enterprise. We concentrate on two aspects of the theory's coarse-graining:\nfinding natural large scale observables on one hand and studying how the\ndynamics of varying graphs could be cast onto fixed graphs on the other hand.\n  To determine large scale observables, we study the case of hyperbolic\ntetrahedra and their natural description in a language close to loop quantum\ngravity. The surface holonomies in particular play an important role. This\nhighlights the structure of double spin networks, which consist in a graph and\nits dual, which seems to also appear in works from Freidel et al. To solve the\nproblem of varying graphs, we consider and define loopy spin networks. They\nencode the local curvature with loops around an effective vertex and allow to\ndescribe different graphs by hidding them in a coarse-graining process.\nMoreover, their definition gives a natural procedure for coarse-graining\nallowing to relate different scales.\n  Together, these two results constitute the foundation of a coarse-graining\nprogramme for diffeomorphism invariant theories.\n", "  Four types of discrete transforms of Weyl orbit functions on the finite point\nsets are developed. The point sets are formed by intersections of the dual-root\nlattices with the fundamental domains of the affine Weyl groups. The finite\nsets of weights, labelling the orbit functions, obey symmetries of the dual\nextended affine Weyl groups. Fundamental domains of the dual extended affine\nWeyl groups are detailed in full generality. Identical cardinality of the point\nand weight sets is proved and explicit counting formulas for these\ncardinalities are derived. Discrete orthogonality of complex-valued Weyl and\nreal-valued Hartley orbit functions over the point sets is established and the\ncorresponding discrete Fourier-Weyl and Hartley-Weyl transforms are formulated.\n", "  Lanthanum manganite, LaMnO (LMO) is the parent compound for a class of hole\ndoped(e.g. La1-xCaxMnO3, La1-xSrxMnO3) and electron doped (e.g. . La1-xCexMnO3,\nLa1-xSnxMnO3) perovskite complex oxide materials. Strong correlation between\nthe spin,lattice, charge and orbital degrees of freedom is a hallmark of these\nclass of materials (popularly known as manganites). Competition and interplay\nof these degrees of freedom lead to a wide range of interesting electronic\nbehavior including half-metallicity, colossal magneto-resistivity, etc.\nAlthough a lot of experimental research has been carried out on the hole doped\nand the electron doped counterparts, the parent system LMO remains less\ninvestigated. This could be attributed to the difficulty in making\nstoichiometric LMO (whether in bulk polycrystalline, single crystals or thin\nfilms). There exists phenomenon like double-exchange (DE) and\nanti-ferromagnetic super-exchange (SE) interactions which leads to\nferromagnetism in LMO thin films. This project work is aimed at the fabrication\nand characterization of thin films of stoichiometric LMO and their structural,\nmagnetic and electrical studies.\n", "  This paper reviews my personal inclinations and fascination with the area of\nunconventional computing. Computing can be perceived as an inscription in a\n\"Rosetta Stone,\" one category akin to physics, and therefore as a form of\ncomprehension of nature: at least from a purely syntactic perspective, to\nunderstand means to be able to algorithmically (re)produce. I also address the\nquestion of why there is computation, and sketch a research program based on\nprimordial chaos, out of which order and even self-referential perception\nemerges by way of evolution.\n", "  The Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) and the local Lorentz invariance (LLI)\nare two major assumptions of General Relativity (GR). The MICROSCOPE mission,\ncurrently operating, will perform a test of the WEP with a precision of\n$10^{-15}$. The data will also be analysed at SYRTE for the purposes of a LLI\ntest realised in collaboration with J. Tasson (Carleton College, Minnesota) and\nQ. Bailey (Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Arizona). This study will be\nperformed in a general framework, called the Standard Model Extension (SME),\ndescribing Lorentz violations that could appear at Planck scale ($10^{19}$\nGeV). The SME allows us to derive a Lorentz violating observable designed for\nthe MICROSCOPE experiment and to search for possible deviations from LLI in the\ndifferential acceleration of the test masses.\n", "  The present work carries out molecular dynamics simulations to compute the\nthermal conductivity of the borophene nanoribbon and the borophene nanotube\nusing the Muller-Plathe approach. We investigate the thermal conductivity of\nthe armchair and zigzag borophenes, and show the strong anisotropic thermal\nconductivity property of borophene. We compare the results of the borophene\nnanoribbon and the borophene nanotube, and find the thermal conductivity of the\nborophene is structure dependent.\n", "  Guided by critical systems found in nature we develop a novel mechanism\nconsisting of inhomogeneous polynomial regularisation via which we can induce\nscale invariance in deep learning systems. Technically, we map our deep\nlearning (DL) setup to a genuine field theory, on which we act with the\nRenormalisation Group (RG) in momentum space and produce the flow equations of\nthe couplings; those are translated to constraints and consequently interpreted\nas \"critical regularisation\" conditions in the optimiser; the resulting\nequations hence prove to be sufficient conditions for - and serve as an elegant\nand simple mechanism to induce scale invariance in any deep learning setup.\n", "  In this paper, the origin of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) in\nan $M$-dimensional theory with Lie-$N$-algebra is considered. This theory which\nwe name GLNA(Generalized Lie-$N$-Algebra)-theory can be reduced to $M$-theory\nwith $M=11$ and $N=3$. In this theory, at the beginning, two energies with\npositive and negative signs are created from nothing and produce two types of\nbranes with opposite quantum numbers and different numbers of timing\ndimensions. Coincidence with the birth of these branes, various derivatives of\nbosonic fields emerge in the action of the system which produce the $r$ GUP for\nbosons. These branes interact with each other, compact and various derivatives\nof spinor fields appear in the action of the system which leads to the creation\nof the GUP for fermions. The previous predicted entropy of branes in the GUP is\ncorrected as due to the emergence of higher orders of derivatives and different\nnumber of timing dimensions.\n", "  Light traveling through the vacuum interacts with virtual particles similarly\nto the way that light traveling through a dielectric interacts with ordinary\nmatter. And just as the permittivity of a dielectric can be calculated, the\npermittivity $\\epsilon_0$ of the vacuum can be calculated, yielding an equation\nfor the fine-structure constant $\\alpha$. The most important contributions to\nthe value of $\\alpha$ arise from interactions in the vacuum of photons with\nvirtual, bound states of charged lepton-antilepton pairs. Considering only\nthese contributions, the fully screened $\\alpha \\cong 1/(8^2\\sqrt{3\\pi/2})\n\\cong 1/139$.\n", "  Chapter 9 in High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) : Preliminary\nDesign Report.

In our previous work we found new explicit vacuum\nsolutions of QMAG, namely generalised pp-waves of parallel Ricci curvature with\npurely tensor torsion. Here we do not make any assumptions on the properties of\ntorsion and write down our field equations accordingly. We present a review of\nresearch done thus far by several authors in finding new solutions of QMAG and\ndifferent approaches in generalising pp-waves. We present two conjectures on\nthe new types of solutions of QMAG which the ansatz presented in this paper\nwill hopefully enable us to prove.\n", "  The field of plasma-based particle accelerators has seen tremendous progress\nover the past decade and experienced significant growth in the number of\nactivities. During this process, the involved scientific community has expanded\nfrom traditional university-based research and is now encompassing many large\nresearch laboratories worldwide, such as BNL, CERN, DESY, KEK, LBNL and SLAC.\nAs a consequence, there is a strong demand for a consolidated effort in\neducation at the intersection of accelerator, laser and plasma physics. The\nCERN Accelerator School on Plasma Wake Acceleration has been organized as a\nresult of this development. In this paper, we describe the interactive\ncomponent of this one-week school, which consisted of three case studies to be\nsolved in 11 working groups by the participants of the CERN Accelerator School.\n", "  We report the first observation of the decay $\\Lambda^+_{c}\\rightarrow\n\\Sigma^- \\pi^+\\pi^+\\pi^0$, based on data obtained in $e^+e^-$ annihilations\nwith an integrated luminosity of 567~pb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}=4.6$~GeV.

In addition, an improved\nmeasurement of $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda^+_{c}\\rightarrow\\Sigma^-\\pi^+\\pi^+)$ is\ndetermined as $(1.81\\pm0.17({\\rm stat.})\\pm0.09({\\rm syst.}))\\%$.\n", "  Layered semiconductors show promise as channel materials for field-effect\ntransistors (FETs). Usually, such devices incorporate solid back or top gate\ndielectrics. Here, we explore de-ionized (DI) water as a solution top gate for\nfield-effect switching of layered semiconductors including SnS2, MoS2, and\nblack phosphorus. The DI water gate is easily fabricated, can sustain rapid\nbias changes, and its efficient coupling to layered materials provides high\non-off current ratios, a near-ideal sub-threshold swing, and enhanced\nshortchannel behavior even for FETs with thick, bulk-like channels. Screening\nby the high-k solution gate eliminates hysteresis due to surface and interface\ntrap states and substantially enhances the field-effect mobility. The onset of\nwater electrolysis sets the ultimate limit to DI water gating at large negative\ngate bias. Measurements in this regime show promise for aqueous sensing,\ndemonstrated here by the amperometric detection of glucose in aqueous solution.\nDI water gating of layered semiconductors can be harnessed in research on novel\nmaterials and devices, and it may with further development find broad\napplications in microelectronics and sensing.\n", "  The phase of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the\nsystem's parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wavefunction may\nacquire a measurable phase difference called the Berry phase. Berry phases\ntypically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we\ndemonstrate an unusual Berry-phase-induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and\nlarge increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene\np-n junction resonators when a small critical magnetic field is reached. This\nbehavior results from turning on a $\\pi$-Berry phase associated with the\ntopological properties of Dirac fermions in graphene. The Berry phase can be\nswitched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 mT,\npotentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic graphene device applications.\n", "  We outline an unified introduction to the evolution equations of classical\nand quantum systems intended for a high school students audience. The attempt\nconsists in circumventing the lack of mathematical knowledge with the use of\nsimplified forms of numerical analysis. The aim is to allow students to\napproach theoretical features as well as computational aspects of the evolution\nequations. In particular, the possibility to compute and analyze approximate\nsolutions of the dynamical laws of classical, stochastic and quantum mechanics\nenables to highlight the distinctive role played by probability in different\ncontexts. As computer support for numerical analysis we selected the\nspreadsheet. It is a work environment usually presented in high school and it\nis an ideal tool for an intuitive approach to numerical computation through\nrecursive algorithms. The proposal was presented to an audience composed by\nstudents of the course of Didactics of Physics and of high school Science\nteachers.\n", "  We have been testing the theory used to calculate internal-conversion\ncoefficients (ICCs) by making a series of measurements of alpha_K values with\nprecision better than +/-2%. So far we have measured E3 transitions in three\nnuclei, 103Rh, 111Cd and 134Cs; and M4 transitions in six nuclei, 119Sn, 125Te,\n127Te, 137Ba, 193Ir and 197Pt. Together, these span a wide range of A and Z\nvalues. In all cases, the results strongly favor Dirac-Fock calculations in\nwhich the final-state electron wave function has been computed in an atomic\nfield that includes the vacancy created by the internal-conversion process.\n", "  Efficiently bounding large determinants is an essential step in\nnon-relativistic fermionic constructive quantum field theory to prove the\nabsolute convergence of the perturbation expansion of correlation functions in\nterms of powers of the strength $u\\in \\mathbb{R}$ of the interparticle\ninteraction. We provide, for large determinants of fermionic convariances,\nsharp bounds which hold for all (bounded and unbounded, the latter not being\nlimited to semibounded) one-particle Hamiltonians. We find the smallest\nuniversal determinant bound to be exactly $1$. In particular, the convergence\nof perturbation series at $u=0$ of any fermionic quantum field theory is\nensured if the matrix entries, with respect to some fixed orthonormal basis, of\nthe covariance and the interparticle interaction decay sufficiently fast. Our\nproofs use H\\\"older inequalities for general non-commutative $L^{p}$-spaces\nderived by Araki and Masuda.\n", "  The spectral analysis of a non-Hermitian unbounded operator appearing in\nquantum physics is our main concern. The properties of such an operator are\nessentially different from those of Hermitian Hamiltonians, namely due to\nspectral instabilities. We demonstrate that the considered operator and its\nadjoint can be diagonalized when expressed in terms of certain conveniently\nconstructed operators. We show that their eigenfunctions constitute complete\nsystems, but do not form Riesz bases. Attempts to overcome this difficulty in\nthe quantum mechanical set up are pointed out.\n", "  For higher derivative theories of gravity, it is possible to write the action\nin terms of auxiliary fields. In such case, one can show that the equations of\nmotion for both actions are equivalent and hence the actions themselves. In\nthis paper we show that one can obtain the Wald's entropy from the equivalent\naction. We use this useful approach to localise a non-local gravitational\naction and calculate its associated entropy.\n", "  Dark matter candidates such as weakly-interacting massive particles are\npredicted to annihilate or decay into Standard Model particles leaving behind\ndistinctive signatures in gamma rays, neutrinos, positrons, antiprotons, or\neven anti-nuclei. Indirect dark matter searches, and in particular those based\non gamma-ray observations and cosmic ray measurements could detect such\nsignatures. Here we review the strengths and limitations of this approach and\nlook into the future of indirect dark matter searches.\n", "  Working within the quasi-metric framework (QMF), it is examined if the\ngravitational field exterior to an isolated, spherically symmetric body is\nnecessarily metrically static; or equivalently, whether or not Birkhoff's\ntheorem holds for quasi-metric gravity. It is found that it does; however the\nproof is somewhat different from the general-relativistic case.\n", "  The extended Frank elastic energy density is used to investigate the\nexistence of a stable periodically modulate structure that appears as a ground\nstate exhibiting a twist-bend molecular arrangement. For an unbounded sample,\nwe show that the twist-bend nematic phase $N_{TB}$ is characterized by a\nheliconical structure with a pitch in the nano-metric range, in agreement with\nexperimental results. For a sample of finite thickness, we show that the wave\nvector of the stable periodic structure depends not only on the elastic\nparameters but also on the anchoring energy, easy axis direction, and the\nthickness of the sample.\n", "  Observations of distant gamma-ray sources are hindered by the presence of the\nextragalactic background light (EBL). In order to understand the physical\nprocesses that result in the observed spectrum of sources, it is imperative\nthat a good understanding of the EBL is included. In this work, an\ninvestigation into the imprint of the EBL on the observed spectra of high\nredshift Fermi-LAT AGN is presented. By fitting the spectrum below $\\sim$10\nGeV, an estimation of the un-absorbed intrinsic source spectrum is obtained; by\napplying this spectrum to data up to 300 GeV, it is then possible to derive a\nscaling factor for different EBL models. A second approach uses 5 sources (PKS\n0426-380, 4C +55.17, Ton 116, PG 1246+586 and RBS 1432) which were found to\nexhibit very high energy emission ($E_{\\gamma}>100$ GeV). Through Monte Carlo\nsimulations it is shown that the observation of VHE photons, despite the large\ndistances of these objects, is consistent with current EBL models. Many of\nthese sources would be observable with the upcoming ground based observatory\nthe Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), leading to a better understanding of the\nEBL.\n", "  In string theory, the traditional picture of a Universe that emerges from the\ninflation of a very small and highly curved space-time patch is a possibility,\nnot a necessity: quite different initial conditions are possible, and not\nnecessarily unlikely. In particular, the duality symmetries of string theory\nsuggest scenarios in which the Universe starts inflating from an initial state\ncharacterized by very small curvature and interactions. Such a state, being\ngravitationally unstable, will evolve towards higher curvature and coupling,\nuntil string-size effects and loop corrections make the Universe \"bounce\" into\na standard, decreasing-curvature regime. In such a context, the hot big bang of\nconventional cosmology is replaced by a \"hot big bounce\" in which the bouncing\nand heating mechanisms originate from the quantum production of particles in\nthe high-curvature, large-coupling pre-bounce phase. Here we briefly summarize\nthe main features of this inflationary scenario, proposed a quarter century\nago. In its simplest version (where it represents an alternative and not a\ncomplement to standard slow-roll inflation) it can produce a viable spectrum of\ndensity perturbations, together with a tensor component characterized by a\n\"blue\" spectral index with a peak in the GHz frequency range. That means,\nphenomenologically, a very small contribution to a primordial B-mode in the CMB\npolarization, and the possibility of a large enough stochastic background of\ngravitational waves to be measurable by present or future gravitational wave\ndetectors.\n"]}
