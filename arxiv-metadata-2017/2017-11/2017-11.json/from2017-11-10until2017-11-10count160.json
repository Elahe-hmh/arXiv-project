We denote the set of all quantum effects by ${\\cal E}(H)$. In\nthis paper we prove, Theorem 4.3, on the theory of sequential product on ${\\cal\nE}(H)$ which shows, in fact, that there are sequential products on ${\\cal\nE}(H)$ which are not of the generalized L\\\"{u}ders form. This result answers a\nGudder's open problem negatively.\n", "  Sequential effect algebra is an important model for studying quantum\nmeasurement theory. In 2005, Professor Gudder presented 25 open problems to\nmotivate its study. The 20th problem asked: In a sequential effect algebra, if\nthe square root of some element exists, is it unique ? We can strengthen the\nproblem as following: For each given positive integer $n>1$, is there a\nsequential effect algebra such that the n-th root of its some element $c$ is\nnot unique and the n-th root of $c$ is not the k-th root of $c$ ($k<n$) ?\nRecently, we answered the strengthened problem affirmatively.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce and study unified $(r,s)$-relative entropy and\nquantum unified $(r,s)$-relative entropy, in particular, our main results of\nquantum unified $(r,s)$-relative entropy are established on the separable\ncomplex Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the entanglement-measure of states due to the\nquantum unified $(r,s)$-relative entropy is considered, too. Our results\nimproved a uncorrect statement on the monotone property of entanglement-measure\nfunction.\n", "  We introduce a general, efficient method to completely describe the topology\nof individual grains, bubbles, and cells in three-dimensional polycrystals,\nfoams, and other multicellular microstructures. This approach is applied to a\npair of three-dimensional microstructures that are often regarded as close\nanalogues in the literature: one resulting from normal grain growth (mean\ncurvature flow) and another resulting from a random Poisson-Voronoi\ntessellation of space. Grain growth strongly favors particular grain\ntopologies, compared with the Poisson-Voronoi model. Moreover, the frequencies\nof highly symmetric grains are orders of magnitude higher in the the grain\ngrowth microstructure than they are in the Poisson-Voronoi one. Grain topology\nstatistics provide a strong, robust differentiator of different cellular\nmicrostructures and provide hints to the processes that drive different classes\nof microstructure evolution.\n", "  In this paper we consider construction of decoherence free subspaces for\ntwo--access random unitary channels. First, we concentrate on hermitian unitary\nnoise model $U$ for a bi--unitary channel and show that in this case a code\nexists if the space of Schmidt matrices of an eigensubspace of $U$ exhibits\ncertain properties of decomposability. Then, we show that our technique is also\napplicable in a generic case and consider its application two tri- (quatro-,\n...) unitary channels.\n", "  Using a variational formulation for partial differential equations (PDEs)\ncombined with numerical simulations on ordinary differential equations (ODEs),\nwe find two categories (pulses and snakes) of dissipative solitons, and analyze\nthe dependence of both their shape and stability on the physical parameters of\nthe cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE). In contrast to the regular\nsolitary waves investigated in numerous integrable and non-integrable systems\nover the last three decades, these dissipative solitons are not stationary in\ntime. Rather, they are spatially confined pulse-type structures whose envelopes\nexhibit complicated temporal dynamics. Numerical simulations reveal very\ninteresting bifurcations sequences as the parameters of the CGLE are varied.\nOur predictions on the variation of the soliton amplitude, width, position,\nspeed and phase of the solutions using the variational formulation agree with\nsimulation results.\n", "  We develop a fully three dimensional numerical code describing the diffusion\nof cosmic rays in the Milky Way. It includes the nuclear spallation chain up to\nOxygen, and allows the study of various cosmic ray properties, such as the CR\nage, grammage traversed, and the ratio between secondary and primary particles.\nThis code enables us to explore a model in which a large fraction of the cosmic\nray acceleration takes place in the vicinity of galactic spiral arms and that\nthese spiral arms are dynamic. We show that the effect of having dynamic spiral\narms is to limit the age of cosmic rays at low energies. This is because at low\nenergies the time since the last spiral arm passage governs the Cosmic Ray (CR)\nage, and not diffusion. Using the model, the observed spectral dependence of\nthe secondary to primary ratio is recovered without requiring any further\nassumptions such as a galactic wind, re-acceleration or various assumptions on\nthe diffusivity. In particular, we obtain a secondary to primary ratio which\nincreases with energy below about 1 GeV.\n", "  We present initial results from a wide-field (30,000 deg^2) search for L/T\ntransition brown dwarfs within 25 pc using the Pan-STARRS1 and WISE surveys.\nPrevious large-area searches have been incomplete for L/T transition dwarfs,\nbecause these objects are faint in optical bands and have near-infrared colors\nthat are difficult to distinguish from background stars. To overcome these\nobstacles, we have cross-matched the Pan-STARRS1 (optical) and WISE (mid-IR)\ncatalogs to produce a unique multi-wavelength database for finding ultracool\ndwarfs. As part of our initial discoveries, we have identified seven brown\ndwarfs in the L/T transition within 9-15 pc of the Sun. The L9.5 dwarf PSO\nJ140.2308+45.6487 and the T1.5 dwarf PSO J307.6784+07.8263 (both independently\ndiscovered by Mace et al. 2013) show possible spectroscopic variability at the\nY- and J-bands. Two more objects in our sample show evidence of photometric\nJ-band variability, and two others are candidate unresolved binaries based on\ntheir spectra. We expect our full search to yield a well-defined,\nvolume-limited sample of L/T transition dwarfs that will include many new\ntargets for study of this complex regime. PSO J307.6784+07.8263 in particular\nmay be an excellent candidate for in-depth study of variability, given its\nbrightness (J = 14.2 mag) and proximity (11 pc).\n", "  Codeposition of two molecular species [CuPc (donor) and PFP (acceptor)] on\nnoble metal (111) surfaces leads to the self-assembly of an ordered mixed layer\nwith maximized donor-acceptor contact area. The main driving force behind this\narrangement is assumed to be the intermolecular C-F...H-C hydrogen-bond\ninteractions. Such interactions would be maximized for a coplanar molecular\narrangement. However, precise measurement of molecule-substrate distances in\nthe molecular mixture reveals significantly larger adsorption heights for PFP\nthan for CuPc. Most surprisingly, instead of leveling to increase hydrogen bond\ninteractions, the height difference is enhanced in mixed layers as compared to\nthe heights found in single component CuPc and PFP layers, resulting in an\noverall reduced interaction with the underlying substrate. The influence of the\nincreased height of PFP on the interface dipole is investigated through work\nfunction measurements.\n", "  A highly comparative, feature-based approach to time series classification is\nintroduced that uses an extensive database of algorithms to extract thousands\nof interpretable features from time series. These features are derived from\nacross the scientific time-series analysis literature, and include summaries of\ntime series in terms of their correlation structure, distribution, entropy,\nstationarity, scaling properties, and fits to a range of time-series models.\nAfter computing thousands of features for each time series in a training set,\nthose that are most informative of the class structure are selected using\ngreedy forward feature selection with a linear classifier. The resulting\nfeature-based classifiers automatically learn the differences between classes\nusing a reduced number of time-series properties, and circumvent the need to\ncalculate distances between time series. Representing time series in this way\nresults in orders of magnitude of dimensionality reduction, allowing the method\nto perform well on very large datasets containing long time series or time\nseries of different lengths. For many of the datasets studied, classification\nperformance exceeded that of conventional instance-based classifiers, including\none nearest neighbor classifiers using Euclidean distances and dynamic time\nwarping and, most importantly, the features selected provide an understanding\nof the properties of the dataset, insight that can guide further scientific\ninvestigation.\n", "  Modularity maximization has been one of the most widely used approaches in\nthe last decade for discovering community structure in networks of practical\ninterest in biology, computing, social science, statistical mechanics, and\nmore. Modularity is a quality function that measures the difference between the\nnumber of edges found within clusters minus the number of edges one would\nstatistically expect to find based on random chance. We present a natural\ngeneralization of modularity based on the difference between the actual and\nexpected number of walks within clusters, which we call walk-modularity.\nWalk-modularity can be expressed in matrix form, and community detection can be\nperformed by finding leading eigenvectors of the walk-modularity matrix. We\ndemonstrate community detection on both synthetic and real-world networks and\nfind that walk-modularity maximization returns significantly improved results\ncompared to traditional modularity maximization.\n", "  I argue that quantum optical experiments that purport to refute Bohr's\nprinciple of complementarity (BPC) fail in their aim. Some of these experiments\ntry to refute complementarity by refuting the so called particle-wave duality\nrelations, which evolved from the Wootters-Zureck reformulation of BPC (WZPC).\nI therefore consider it important for my forgoing arguments to first recall the\nessential tenets of BPC, and to clearly separate BPC from WZPC, which I will\nargue is a direct contradiction of BPC. This leads to a need to consider the\nmeaning of particle-wave duality relations and to question their fundamental\nstatus. I further argue (albeit, in opposition to BPC) that particle and wave\ncomplementary concepts are on a different footing than other pairs of\ncomplementary concepts.\n", "  In this paper, we study the $\\phi^4$ kink scattering from a spatially\nlocalized $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric defect and the effect of the kink's internal\nmode (IM) is discussed. It is demonstrated that if a kink hits the defect from\nthe gain side, a noticeable IM is excited, while for the kink coming from the\nopposite direction the mode excitation is much weaker. This asymmetry is a\nprincipal finding of the present work. Similar to the case of the sine-Gordon\nkink studied earlier, it is found that the $\\phi^4$ kink approaching the defect\nfrom the gain side always passes through the defect, while in the opposite case\nit must have sufficiently large initial velocity, otherwise it is trapped by\nthe loss region. It is found that for the kink with IM the critical velocity is\nsmaller, meaning that the kink bearing IM can pass more easily through the loss\nregion. This feature, namely the \"increased transparency\" of the defect as\nregards the motion of the kink in the presence of IM is the second key finding\nof the present work. A two degree of freedom collective variable model offered\nrecently by one of the co-authors is shown to be capable of reproducing both\nprincipal findings of the present work. A simpler, analytically tractable\nsingle degree of freedom collective variable method is used to calculate\nanalytically the kink phase shift and the kink critical velocity sufficient to\npass through the defect. Comparison with the numerical results suggests that\nthe collective variable method is able to predict these parameters with a high\naccuracy.\n", "  The quantum discord was introduced by Ollivier, Zurek, Henderson and Vedral\nas an indicator of the degree of quantumness of mixed states. In this paper, we\ngive out the decomposition condition of quantum discords. Moreover, we show\nthat under the condition, the quantum correlations between the quantum systems\ncan be captured completely by the entanglement measure.\n", "  The first and second order form of gauge theories are classically equivalent;\nwe consider the consequence of quantizing the first order form using the\nFaddeev-Popov approach. Both the Yang-Mills and the Einstein-Hilbert actions\nare considered. An advantage of this approach is that the interaction vertices\nare quite simple, being independent of momenta. It is necessary however to\nconsider the propagator for two fields (including a mixed propagator). We\nderive the Feynman rules for both models and consider the one loop correction\nfor the thermal energy momentum tensor.\n", "  Background: Heavy-ion fusion reactions involving heavy nuclei at energies\naround the Coulomb barrier exhibit fusion hindrance, where the probability of\ncompound nucleus formation is strongly hindered compared with that in light-\nand medium-mass systems. The origin of this fusion hindrance has not been well\nunderstood from a microscopic point of view. Purpose: Analyze the fusion\ndynamics in heavy systems by a microscopic reaction model and understand the\norigin of the fusion hindrance. Method: We employ the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We extract nucleus--nucleus potential and energy\ndissipation by the method combining TDHF dynamics of the entrance channel of\nfusion reactions with one-dimensional Newton equation including a dissipation\nterm. Then, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance using the properties\nof the extracted potential and energy dissipation. Results: Extracted\npotentials show monotonic increase as the relative distance of two nuclei\ndecreases, which induces the disappearance of an ordinary barrier structure of\nthe potential. This is different from those in light- and medium-mass systems\nand from density-constraint TDHF calculations. Extracted friction coefficients\nshow sizable energy dependence and universal value of their magnitude, which\nare rather similar to those in light- and medium-mass systems. Using these\nproperties, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance and find that\ncontribution of the increase in potential to the extra-push energy is larger\nthan that of the accumulated dissipation energy in most systems studied in this\narticle. Conclusions: By the analysis of the origin of the fusion hindrance, we\nconclude that, as the system becomes heavier, the dynamical increase in\npotential at small relative distances plays a more important role than the\ndissipation during the fusion reaction for understanding the origin of the\nfusion hindrance.\n", "  We present an analysis of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for a three\ndimensional vacuous bubble in water. In the simplest case when the effects of\nsurface tension are neglected, the known parametric solutions for the radius\nand time evolution of the bubble in terms of a hypergeometric function are\nbriefly reviewed. By including the surface tension, we show the connection\nbetween the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and Abel's equation, and obtain the\nparametric rational Weierstrass periodic solutions following the Abel route. In\nthe same Abel approach, we also provide a discussion of the nonintegrable case\nof nonzero viscosity for which we perform a numerical integration\n", "  Speckle based imaging consists of forming a super-resolved reconstruction of\nan unknown sample from low-resolution images obtained under random\ninhomogeneous illuminations (speckles). In a blind context where the\nilluminations are unknown, we study the intrinsic capacity of speckle-based\nimagers to recover spatial frequencies outside the frequency support of the\ndata, with minimal assumptions about the sample. We demonstrate that, under\nphysically realistic conditions, the covariance of the data has a\nsuper-resolution power corresponding to the squared magnitude of the imager\npoint spread function. This theoretical result is important for many practical\nimaging systems such as acoustic and electromagnetic tomographs, fluorescence\nand photoacoustic microscopes, or synthetic aperture radar imaging. A numerical\nvalidation is presented in the case of fluorescence microscopy.\n", "  A correspondence between three-dimensional flat connections and constant\ncurvature four-dimensional simplices is used to give a novel quantization of\ngeometry via complex SL(2,C) Chern-Simons theory. The resulting quantum\ngeometrical states are hence represented by the 3d blocks of analytically\ncontinued Chern-Simons theory. In the semiclassical limit of this quantization\nthe three-dimensional Chern-Simons action, remarkably, becomes the discrete\nEinstein-Hilbert action of a 4-simplex, featuring the appropriate boundary\nterms as well as the essential cosmological term proportional to the simplex's\ncurved 4-volume. Both signs of the curvature and associated cosmological\nconstant are present in the class of flat connections that give rise to this\ncorrespondence. We provide a Wilson graph operator that picks out this class of\nconnections. We discuss how to promote these results to a model of Lorentzian\ncovariant quantum gravity encompassing both signs of the cosmological constant.\nThis paper presents the details for the results reported in reference [1]\n(arXiv:1509.00458).\n", "  In this article, for the first time in the context of TOP trap, the necessary\nand sufficient conditions for the adiabatic evolution of weak field seeking\nstates have been quantitatively examined. It has been well accepted since\ndecades that adiabaticity has to be obeyed by the atoms for successful magnetic\ntrapping. However, we show, on the contrary, that atoms can also be confined\nbeyond the adiabatic limit. Hence, our findings open new possibilities to relax\nthe restrictions of atom trapping in laboratories.\n", "  We study the problem of converting a product of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(GHZ) states shared by subsets of several parties in an arbitrary way into GHZ\nstates shared by every party. Our result is that if SLOCC transformations are\nallowed, then the best asymptotic rate is the minimum of bipartite log-ranks of\nthe initial state. This generalizes a result by Strassen on the asymptotic\nsubrank of the matrix multiplication tensor.\n", "  Micrometre sized colloidal particles can be viewed as large atoms with\ntailorable size, shape and interactions. These building blocks can assemble\ninto extremely rich structures and phases, in which the thermal motions of\nparticles can be directly imaged and tracked using optical microscopy. Hence,\ncolloidal particles are excellent model systems for studying phase transitions,\nespecially for poorly understood kinetic and nonequilibrium microscale\nprocesses. Advances in colloid fabrication, assembly and computer simulations\nhave opened up numerous possibilities for such research. In this Review, we\ndescribe recent progress in the study of colloidal crystals composed of tunable\nisotropic spheres, anisotropic particles and active particles. We focus on\nadvances in crystallization, melting and solid solid transitions, and highlight\nchallenges and future perspectives in phase transition studies within colloidal\ncrystals.\n", "  Dirac semimetals are three dimensional analog of graphene with massless Dirac\nfermions as low energy electronic excitations. In contrast to Weyl semimetals,\nthe point nodes in the bulk spectrum of topological Dirac semimetals have a\nvanishing Chern number, but can yet be stable due to the existence of\ncrystalline symmetries such as uniaxial (discrete) rotation symmetry. We\nconsider a model low-energy Hamiltonian appropriate for the recently discovered\ntopological Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$, and calculate the Nernst response\nwithin semiclassical Boltzmann dynamics in the relaxation time approximation.\nWe show that, for small chemical potentials near the Dirac points, the low\ntemperature, low magnetic field, Nernst response is dominated by\n\\textit{anomalous} Nernst effect, arising from a non-trivial profile of Berry\ncurvature on the Fermi surface. Although the Nernst coefficient (both anomalous\nas well as conventional) vanish in the limit of zero magnetic field, the low\ntemperature, low magnetic field, Nernst response, which has an almost step like\nprofile near $\\mathbf{B}=0$, serves as an effective experimental probe of\nanomalous Nernst effect in topological Dirac semimetals protected by\ncrystalline symmetries. Additionally, we also calculate the Nernst response for\na lattice model of an inversion asymmetric Weyl semimetal for which, in\ncontrast to the case of Dirac semimetal, we find that the conventional Nernst\nresponse dominates over the anomalous. Our calculations in this paper on Nernst\nresponse of Dirac semimetal and inversion broken Weyl semimetal are directly\nrelevant to recent experiments on Cd$_3$As$_2$ (Dirac semimetal) and NbP\n(inversion broken Weyl semimetal) respectively.\n", "  We have measured the differential conductance of a parallel carbon nanotube\n(CNT) double quantum dot (DQD) with strong inter-dot capacitance and inter-dot\ntunnel coupling. Nominally, the device consists of a single CNT with two\ncontacts. However, we identify two sets of Coulomb blockade (CB) diamonds that\ndo not block transport individually, which suggest that two quantum dots (QDs)\nare contacted in parallel. We find strong and periodic anti-crossings in the\ngate and bias dependence, which are only possible if the QDs have similar\ncharacteristics. We discuss qualitatively the level spectrum and the involved\ntransport processes in this device and extract the DQD coupling parameters.\nThese results lead us to believe that clean and undoped QDs are formed parallel\nto the CNT axis, possibly on the outer and inner shells of a multi-wall CNT, or\nin a double-stranded CNT bundle.\n", "  We construct solutions to the Einstein equations for asymptotically locally\nAnti-de Sitter spacetimes with four, five, and six dimensional\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om boundary metrics. These spacetimes are gravitational duals\nto \"jammed\" CFTs on those backgrounds at infinite N and strong coupling. For\nthese spacetimes, we calculate the boundary stress tensor as well as compute\nentanglement entropies for ball shaped regions as functions of the boundary\nblack hole temperature $T_{BH}$. From this, we see how the CFT prevents heat\nflow from the black hole to the vacuum at spatial infinity. We also compute\nentanglement entropies for a three dimensional boundary black hole using the\nAdS C-metric. We compare our results to previous work done in similar\nspacetimes.\n", "  Recently for the sine-Gordon equation it has been established that during\ncollisions of $N$ slow kinks maximal energy density increases as $N^2$. In this\nnumerical study, the same scaling rule is established for the non-integrable\n$\\phi^4$ model for $N\\le 5$. For odd (even) $N$ the maximal energy density is\nin the form of potential (kinetic) energy density. Maximal elastic strain is\nalso calculated. In addition, the effect of the kink's internal modes on the\nmaximal energy density is analysed for $N=1, 2, 3$. Our results suggest that in\nmulti-soliton collisions very high energy density can be achieved in a\ncontrollable manner.\n", "  In the following we are interested in the spectral gaps of discrete\nquasiperiodic Schr\\\"odinger operators when the frequency is Diophantine, the\npotential is analytic, and in the subcritical regime. The gap-labelling theorem\nasserts in this context that each gap has constant rotation number, labeled by\nsome integer. We prove that the size of these gaps decays exponentially fast\nwith respect to their label. This refines a subexponential bound obtained\npreviously by Sana Ben Hadj Amor. Contrary to her approach, which is based on\nKAM methods, the arguments in the present paper are non-perturbative, and use\nquantitative reducibility estimates obtained by Artur Avila and Svetlana\nJitomirskaya. As a corollary of our result, we show that under the previous\nassumptions, the spectrum is 1/2-homogeneous.\n", "  We use computer simulations to investigate how a catalytic reaction in a\npolymer sol can induce the formation of a polymer gel. To this aim we consider\na solution of homopolymers in which freely-diffusing catalysts convert the\noriginally repulsive A monomers into attractive B ones. We find that at low\ntemperatures this reaction transforms the polymer solution into a physical gel\nthat has a remarkably regular mesostructure in the form of a cluster phase,\nabsent in the usual homopolymer gels obtained by a quench in temperature. We\ninvestigate how this microstructuring depends on catalyst concentration,\ntemperature, and polymer density and show that the dynamics for its formation\ncan be understood in a semi-quantitative manner using the interaction\npotentials between the particles as input. The structuring of the copolymers\nand the AB sequences resulting from the reactions can be discussed in the\ncontext of the phase behaviour of correlated random copolymers. The location of\nthe spinodal line as found in our simulations is consistent with analytical\npredictions. Finally, we show that the observed structuring depends not only on\nthe chemical distribution of the A and B monomers but also on the mode of\nformation of this distribution.\n", "  We report numerical results for the effective potential arising between two\ncolloids immersed in a self-assembling cosolute which forms reversible\nclusters. The potential is evaluated at cosolute state points with different\ndensities and temperatures but with the same connectivity properties. We find\nthat the range of the resulting effective potential is controlled only by the\ncosolute thermal correlation length rather than by its connectivity length. We\ndiscuss the significant differences with previous results focused on cosolute\nforming irreversible clusters and we show that irreversible bond case\nrepresents a singular limit which cannot be accessed in equilibrium by\ncontinuously increasing the bond lifetime.\n", "  We performed density functional calculations for ultra-thin bismuth surface\nalloys: surface alloys of bismuth and face-centered cubic metals\nBi/$M$(111)-$(\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3})R30\\deg$ ($M$=Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Co, and Fe).\nOur calculated Rashba parameters for the Bi/Ag are consistent with the previous\nexperimental and theoretical results. We predicted a trend in the Rashba\ncoefficients $\\alpha_R$ of bands around the Fermi energy for noble metals as\nfollows: Bi/Ag > Bi/Cu > Bi/Au. As for the transition metals, there is a trend\nin $\\alpha_R$: Bi/Ni > Bi/Co > Bi/Fe. Our finding may lead to design efficient\nspin-charge conversion materials.\n", "  In the population synthesis simulations of Pop III stars, many BH (Black\nHole)-BH binaries with merger time less than the age of the Universe\n$(\\tau_{\\rm H})$ are formed, while NS (Neutron Star)-BH binaries are not. The\nreason is that Pop III stars have no metal so that no mass loss is expected.\nThen, in the final supernova explosion to NS, much mass is lost so that the\nsemi major axis becomes too large for Pop III NS-BH binaries to merge within\n$\\tau_{\\rm H}$. However it is almost established that the kick velocity of the\norder of $200-500{\\rm~ km~s^{-1}}$ exists for NS from the observation of the\nproper motion of the pulsar. Therefore, the semi major axis of the half of\nNS-BH binaries can be smaller than that of the previous argument for Pop III\nNS-BH binaries to decrease the merging time. We perform population synthesis\nMonte Carlo simulations of Pop III NS-BH binaries including the kick of NS and\nfind that the event rate of Pop III NS-BH merger rate is $\\sim 1 {\\rm Gpc^{-3}\nyr^{-1}}$. This suggests that there is a good chance of the detection of Pop\nIII NS-BH mergers in O2 of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo from this autumn.\n", "  North-south asymmetry of sunspot activity resulted in an asynchronous\nreversal of the Sun's polar fields in the current cycle. The asymmetry is also\nobserved in the formation of polar coronal holes. A stable coronal hole was\nfirst formed at the South Pole, despite the later polar-field reversal there.\nThe aim of this study is to understand processes making this situation\npossible. Synoptic magnetic maps from the Global Oscillation Network Group and\ncorresponding coronal-hole maps from the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope\naboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory are analyzed here to study a\ncausal relationship between the decay of activity complexes, evolution of\nlarge-scale magnetic fields, and formation of coronal holes. Ensembles of\ncoronal holes associated with decaying active regions and activity complexes\nare presented. These ensembles take part in global rearrangements of the Sun's\nopen magnetic flux. In particular, the south polar coronal hole was formed from\nan ensemble of coronal holes that originated after the decay of multiple\nactivity complexes observed during 2014.\n", "  The most simple superrenormalizable model of quantum gravity is based on the\ngeneral local covariant six-derivative action. In addition to graviton such a\ntheory has massive scalar and tensor modes. It was shown recently that in the\ncase when the massive poles emerge in complex conjugate pairs, the theory has\nalso unitary $S$-matrix and hence can be seen as a candidate to be a consistent\nquantum gravity theory. In the present work we construct the modified Newton\npotential and explore the gravitational light bending in a general\nsix-derivative theory, including the most interesting case of complex massive\npoles. In the case of the light deflection the results are obtained within\nclassical and semiclassical approaches.\n", "  We consider open quantum walks on a graph, and consider the random variables\ndefined as the passage time and number of visits to a given point of the graph.\nWe study in particular the probability that the passage time is finite, the\nexpectation of that passage time, and the expectation of the number of visits,\nand discuss the notion of recurrence for open quantum walks. We also study exit\ntimes and exit probabilities from a finite domain, and use them to solve\nDirichlet problems and to determine harmonic measures. We consider in\nparticular the case of irreducible open quantum walks. The results we obtain\nextend those for classical Markov chains.\n", "  We study $(1+1)$-dimensional p-wave holographic superconductors described by\nthree dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity coupled to a massive complex vector\nfield in the context of $AdS_3/CFT_2$ correspondence. In the probe limit where\nthe backreation of matter fields is neglected, we show that there occurs a\nformation of a vector hair around the black hole below a certain critical\ntemperature. In the dual strongly coupled $(1+1)$-dimensional boundary theory,\nthis holographically corresponds to the formation of a charged vector\ncondensate spontaneously breaking both the $U(1)$ and $SO(1,1)$ symmetries. We\nnumerically compute the ac conductivity for the superconducting phase of the\nboundary field theory and find that the presence of a magnetic moment term in\nthe dual bulk theory effects the conductivity in the boundary field theory.\n", "  Quantum repeaters provide an efficient solution to distribute Bell pairs over\narbitrarily long distances. While scalable architectures are demanding\nregarding the number of qubits that need to be controlled, here we present a\nquantum repeater scheme aiming to extend the range of present day quantum\ncommunications that could be implemented in the near future with trapped ions\nin cavities. We focus on an architecture where ion-photon entangled states are\ncreated locally and subsequently processed with linear optics to create\nelementary links of ion-ion entangled states. These links are then used to\ndistribute entangled pairs over long distances using successive entanglement\nswapping operations performed deterministically using ion-ion gates. We show\nhow this architecture can be implemented while encoding the qubits in a\ndecoherence free subspace to protect them against collective dephasing. This\nresults in a protocol that can be used to violate a Bell inequality over\ndistances of about 800 km assuming state of the art parameters. We discuss how\nthis could be improved to several thousand kilometers in future setups.\n", "  X-ray production differential cross sections induced by C and Si ions with\nenergies from 1 MeV/u down to 0.25 MeV/u, produced by the CMAM 5 MV tandem\naccelerator, have been measured for thin targets of Ti, Fe, Zn, Nb, Ru and Ta\nin a direct way. X-rays have been detected by a fully characterized silicon\ndrift diode and beam currents have been measured by a system of two Faraday\ncups. Measured cross sections agree in general with previously published\nresults. The ECPSSR theory with the united atoms correction gives absolute\nvalues close to the experimental ones for all the studied elements excited by C\nions and for Ta, Nb and Ru excited by Si ions. For Ti, Fe and Zn excited by Si,\nthe basic ECPSSR theory gives better agreement, although on absolute values the\ngap for Ti is still large.\n", "  We demonstrate several new electron transport phenomena mediated by Andreev\nbound states (ABSs) that form on three-terminal carbon nanotube (CNT) QDs, with\none superconducting (S) contact in the center and two adjacent normal metal (N)\ncontacts. Three-terminal spectroscopy allows us to identify the coupling to the\nN contacts as the origin of the Andreev resonance (AR) linewidths and to\ndetermine the critical coupling strengths to S, for which a ground state\ntransition S-QD systems can occur. We ascribe replicas of the lowest-energy ABS\nresonance to transitions between the ABS and odd-parity excited QD states, a\nprocess called excited state ABS resonances. In the conductance between the two\nN contacts we find a characteristic pattern of positive and negative\ndifferential subgap conductance, which we explain by considering two nonlocal\nprocesses, the creation of Cooper pairs in S by electrons from both N\nterminals, and a novel mechanism called resonant ABS tunneling. In the latter,\nelectrons are transferred via the ABS without creating Cooper pairs in S. The\nthree-terminal geometry also allows spectroscopy experiments with different\nboundary conditions, for example by leaving S floating. Surprisingly, we find\nthat, depending on the boundary conditions, the experiments either show\nsingle-particle Coulomb blockade resonances, ABS characteristics, or both in\nthe same measurements, seemingly contradicting the notion of ABSs replacing the\nsingle particle states as eigenstates of the QD. We qualitatively explain these\nresults as originating from the finite time scale required for the coherent\noscillations between the superposition states after a single electron tunneling\nevent. These experiments demonstrate that three-terminal experiments on a\nsingle complex quantum object can also be useful to investigate charge dynamics\notherwise not accessible due to the very high frequencies.\n", "  CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is nowadays amongst the most promising photovoltaic\nmaterials for energy conversion. We have studied by ab-initio calculations,\nusing several levels of approximation - namely density functional theory\nincluding spin-orbit coupling and quasi-particle corrections by means of the GW\nmethod, as well as pseudopotential self-interaction corrections -, the role of\nthe methylammonium orientation on the electronic structure of this perovskite.\nWe have considered many molecular arrangements within 2x2x2 supercells, showing\nthat the relative orientation of the organic molecules is responsible for a\nhuge band gap variation up to 2 eV. The band gap sizes are related to\ndistortions of the PbI3 cage, which are in turn due to electrostatic\ninteractions between this inorganic frame and the molecules. The strong\ndependence of the band gap on the mutual molecular orientation is confirmed at\nall levels of approximations. Our results suggest then that the coupling\nbetween the molecular motion and the interactions of the molecules with the\ninorganic cage could help to explain the widening of the absorption spectrum of\nCH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, consistent with the observed white spectrum.\n", "  We investigate whether the spin or charge degrees of freedom are responsible\nfor the nodal gap in underdoped cuprates by performing inelastic neutron\nscattering and x-ray diffraction measurements on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, which\nis on the edge of the antiferromagnetic phase. We found that fluctuating\nincommensurate spin-density-wave (SDW) with a the bottom part of an hourglass\ndispersion exists even in this magnetic sample. The strongest component of\nthese fluctuations diminishes at the same temperature where the nodal gap\nopens. X-ray scattering measurements on the same crystal show no signature of\ncharge-density-wave (CDW). Therefore, we suggest that the nodal gap in the\nelectronic band of this cuprate opens due to fluctuating SDW with no\ncontribution from CDW.\n", "  The black hole information paradox presumes that quantum field theory in\ncurved spacetime can provide unitary propagation from a near-horizon mode to an\nasymptotic Hawking quantum. Instead of invoking conjectural quantum gravity\neffects to modify such an assumption, we propose a self-consistency check. We\nestablish an analogy to Feynman's analysis of a double-slit experiment. Feynman\nshowed that unitary propagation of the interfering particles, namely ignoring\nthe entanglement with the double-slit, becomes an arbitrarily reliable\nassumption when the screen upon which the interference pattern is projected is\ninfinitely far away. We argue for an analogous self-consistency check for\nquantum field theory in curved spacetime. We apply it to the propagation of\nHawking quanta and test whether ignoring the entanglement with the geometry\nalso becomes arbitrarily reliable in the limit of a large black hole. We\npresent curious results to suggest a negative answer, and we discuss how this\nloss of na\u007five unitarity in QFT might be related to a solution of the paradox\nbased on the soft-hair-memory effect.\n", "  We present the discovery of eight young M7-L2 dwarfs in the Taurus\nstar-forming region and the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association, serendipitously\nfound during a wide-field search for L/T transition dwarfs using Pan-STARRS1\n(optical) and WISE (mid-infrared) photometry. We identify PSO J060.3200+25.9644\n(near-infrared spectral type L1) and PSO J077.1033+24.3809 (L2) as new members\nof Taurus based on their VL-G gravity classifications, the consistency of their\nphotometry and proper motions with previously known Taurus objects, and the low\nprobability of contamination by field objects. PSO J077.1033+24.3809 is the\ncoolest substellar member of Taurus found to date. Both Taurus objects are\namong the lowest mass free-floating objects ever discovered, with estimated\nmasses $\\approx$6 M$_{\\rm Jup}$, and provide further evidence that isolated\nplanetary-mass objects can form as part of normal star-formation processes. PSO\nJ060.3200+25.9644 (a.k.a. DANCe J040116.80+255752.2) was previously identified\nas a likely member of the Pleiades (age $\\approx125$ Myr) based on photometry\nand astrometry, but its VL-G gravity classification and near-infrared\nphotometry imply a much younger age and thus point to Taurus membership. We\nhave also discovered six M7-L1 dwarfs in outlying regions of Scorpius-Centaurus\nwith photometry, proper motions, and low-gravity spectral signatures consistent\nwith membership. These objects have estimated masses $\\approx$15-36 M$_{\\rm\nJup}$. The M7 dwarf, PSO J237.1470-23.1489, shows excess mid-infrared flux\nimplying the presence of a circumstellar disk. Finally, we present catalogs of\nPan-STARRS1 proper motions for low-mass members of Taurus and Upper Scorpius\nwith median precisions of $\\approx$3 mas yr$^{-1}$, including 67 objects with\nno previous proper motion and 359 measurements that improve on literature\nvalues.\n", "  We present a novel derivation of the elastic theory of shells. We use the\nlanguage of Geometric algebra, which allows us to express the fundamental laws\nin component-free form, thus aiding physical interpretation. It also provides\nthe tools to express equations in an arbitrary coordinate system, which\nenhances their usefulness. The role of moments and angular velocity, and the\napparent use by previous authors of an unphysical angular velocity, has been\nclarified through the use of a bivector representation. In the linearised\ntheory, clarification of previous coordinate conventions which have been the\ncause of confusion, is provided, and the introduction of prior strain into the\nlinearised theory of shells is made possible.\n", "  This is a survey of several approaches to the framework for working with\ninfinitesimals and infinite numbers, originally developed by Abraham Robinson\nin the 1960s, and their constructive engagement with the Cantor-Dedekind\npostulate and the Intended Interpretation hypothesis. We highlight some\napplications including (1) Loeb's approach to the Lebesgue measure, (2) a\nradically elementary approach to the vibrating string, (3) true infinitesimal\ndifferential geometry. We explore the relation of Robinson's and related\nframeworks to the multiverse view as developed by Hamkins. Keywords:\naxiomatisations, infinitesimal, nonstandard analysis, ultraproducts,\nsuperstructure, set-theoretic foundations, multiverse, naive integers,\nintuitionism, soritical properties, ideal elements, protozoa.\n", "  A major open challenge in neuroscience is the ability to measure and perturb\nneural activity in vivo from well-defined neural sub-populations at cellular\nresolution anywhere in the brain. However, limitations posed by scattering and\nabsorption prohibit non-invasive (surface) multiphoton approaches for deep\n(>2mm) structures, while Gradient Refreactive Index (GRIN) endoscopes are thick\nand cause significant damage upon insertion. Here, we demonstrate a novel\nmicroendoscope to image neural activity at arbitrary depths via an ultrathin\nmultimode optical fiber (MMF) probe that is 5-10X thinner than commercially\navailable microendoscopes. We demonstrate micron-scale resolution,\nmultispectral and volumetric imaging. In contrast to previous approaches, we\nshow that this method has an improved acquisition speed that is sufficient to\ncapture rapid neuronal dynamics in-vivo in rodents expressing a genetically\nencoded calcium indicator. Our results emphasize the potential of this\ntechnology in neuroscience applications and open up possibilities for cellular\nresolution imaging in previously unreachable brain regions.\n", "  Using a variational Monte Carlo method, we study competitions of strong\nelectron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the ground state of\nHolstein-Hubbard model on a square lattice. At half filling, an extended\nintermediate metallic or weakly superconducting (SC) phase emerges, sandwiched\nby antiferromagnetic and charge order (CO) insulating phases. By the carrier\ndoping into the CO insulator, the SC order dramatically increases for strong\nelectron-phonon couplings, but largely hampered by wide phase separation (PS)\nregions. Superconductivity is optimized at the border to the PS.\n", "  ReSe2 and ReS2 are unusual compounds amongst the layered transition metal\ndichalcogenides as a result of their low symmetry, with a characteristic\nin-plane anisotropy due to in-plane rhenium chains. They preserve inversion\nsymmetry independent of the number of layers and, in contrast to more\nwell-known transition metal dichalcogenides, bulk and few-monolayer Re-TMD\ncompounds have been proposed to behave as electronically and vibrational\ndecoupled layers. Here, we probe for the first time the electronic band\nstructure of bulk ReSe2 by direct nanoscale angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy. We find a highly anisotropic in- and out-of-plane electronic\nstructure, with the valence band maxima located away from any particular\nhigh-symmetry direction. The effective mass doubles its value perpendicular to\nthe Re chains and the interlayer van der Waals coupling generates significant\nelectronic dispersion normal to the layers. Our density functional theory\ncalculations, including spin-orbit effects, are in excellent agreement with\nthese experimental findings.\n", "  We apply second order Andersen-Weeks-Chandler perturbation theory to the\none-component sticky-hard-spheres fluid. We compare the results with the mean\nspherical approximation, the Percus-Yevick approximation, two generalized\nPercus-Yevick approximations, and the Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  We describe several methods of constructing R-matrices that are dependent\nupon many parameters, for example unitary R-matrices and R-matrices whose\nentries are functions. As an application, we construct examples of R-matrices\nwith prescribed singular values.\n  We characterise some classes of indecomposable set-theoretic solutions of the\nquantum Yang-Baxter equation (QYBE) and construct R-matrices related to such\nsolutions. In particular, we establish a correspondence between one-generator\nbraces and indecomposable, non-degenerate involutive set-theoretic solutions of\nthe QYBE, showing that such solutions are abundant.\n  We show that R-matrices related to involutive, non-degenerate solutions of\nthe QYBE have special form.\n  We also investigate some linear algebra questions related to R-matrices.\n", "  Using a manifestly invariant Lagrangian density based on Clebsch fields and\nsuitable for geophysical fluid dynamics, the conservation of mass, entropy,\nmomentum and energy, and the associated symmetries are investigated. In\ncontrast, it is shown that the conservation of Ertel's potential vorticity is\nnot associated with any symmetry of the equations of motion, but is instead a\ntrivial conservation law of the second kind. This is at odds with previous\nstudies which claimed that potential vorticity conservation relates to a\nsymmetry under particle-relabeling transformations. From the invariant\nLagrangian density, a canonical Hamiltonian formulation is obtained in which\nDirac constraints explicitly include the (possibly time-dependent) metric\ntensor. In this case, it is shown that all Dirac constraints are primary and of\nthe second class, which implies that no local gauge symmetry transformations of\nClebsch fields exist. Finally, the corresponding non-canonical Hamiltonian\nstructure with time-dependent strong constraints is derived using tensor\ncomponents. The existence of Casimir invariants is then investigated in\narbitrary coordinates for two choices of dynamical variables in phase space.\n", "  We consider an array of the meta-atom consisting of two cut-wires and a\nsplit-ring resonator interacting with an electromagnetic field with two\npolarization components. We prove that such metamaterial system can be taken as\na classical analogue of an atomic medium with a double- $\\Lambda$-type\nfour-level configuration coupled with four laser fields, exhibits an effect of\nplasmon induced transparency (PIT), and displays a similar behavior of atomic\nfour-wave mixing (FWM). We demonstrate that when nonlinear varactors are\nmounted onto the gaps of the split-ring resonators the system can acquire giant\nsecond- and third-order Kerr nonlinearities via the PIT and a\nlongwave-shortwave interaction. We also demonstrate that the system supports\nhigh-dimensional vector plasmonic dromions [i.e. (2+1)-dimensional plasmonic\nsolitons with two polarization components, each of which has a coupling between\na longwave and a shortwave], which have very low generation power and are\nrobust during propagation. Our work gives not only a plasmonic analogue of the\nFWM in coherent atomic systems but also provides the possibility for obtaining\nnew type of nonlinear polaritons in plasmonic metamaterials.\n", "  The rhenium-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are atypical of the\nTMD family due to their highly anisotropic crystalline structure and are\nrecognized as promising materials for two dimensional heterostructure devices.\nThe nature of the band gap (direct or indirect) for bulk, few and single layer\nforms of ReS$_2$ is of particular interest, due to its comparatively weak\ninter-planar interaction. However, the degree of inter-layer interaction and\nthe question of whether a transition from indirect to direct gap is observed on\nreducing thickness (as in other TMDs) are controversial. We present a direct\ndetermination of the valence band structure of bulk ReS$_2$ using high\nresolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find a clear\nin-plane anisotropy due to the presence of chains of Re atoms, with a strongly\ndirectional effective mass which is larger in the direction orthogonal to the\nRe chains (2.2 $m_e$) than along them (1.6 $m_e$), in good agreement with\ndensity functional theory calculations. An appreciable inter-plane interaction\nresults in an experimentally-measured difference of ~100-200 meV between the\nvalence band maxima at the Z point (0,0,1/2) and the $\\Gamma$ point (0,0,0) of\nthe three-dimensional Brillouin zone. This leads to a direct gap at Z and a\nclose-lying but larger gap at $\\Gamma$, implying that bulk ReS2 is marginally\nindirect. This may account for recent conflicting transport and\nphotoluminescence measurements and the resulting uncertainty about the direct\nor indirect gap nature of this material.\n", "  Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to trace merger shock fronts. If\ncosmological structure formation determines the luminosity, size and shape\ndistributions of radio relics then merger shocks need to be lighted up in a\nhomogeneous way. We investigate if a mock relic sample, obtained from zoomed\ngalaxy cluster simulations, is able to match the properties of relics measured\nin the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We compile a list of all radio relics known\nto date and homogeneously measure their parameters in all NVSS images and apply\nthe same procedure to relics in our simulations. Number counts in the mock\nrelic sample increase more steeply towards lower relic flux densities,\nsuggesting an incompleteness of NVSS in this regime. Overall, we find that NVSS\nand mock samples show similar properties. However, large simulated relics tend\nto be somewhat smaller and closer to the cluster centre than observed ones.\nBesides this, the mock sample reproduces very well-known correlations for radio\nrelics, in particular those relating the radio luminosity with the largest\nlinear size and the X-ray luminosity. We show that these correlations are\nlargely governed by the sensitivity of the NVSS observations. Mock relics show\na similar orientation with respect to the direction to the cluster centre as\nthe NVSS sample. Moreover, we find that their maximum radio luminosity roughly\ncorrelates with cluster mass, although displaying a large scatter. The overall\ngood agreement between NVSS and the mock sample suggests that properties of\nradio relics are indeed governed by merger shock fronts, emitting in a\nhomogeneous fashion. Our study demonstrates that the combination of mock\nobservations and data from upcoming radio surveys will allow to shed light on\nboth the origin of radio relics and the nature of the intracluster medium.\n", "  We study the collective dynamics of accelerated atoms interacting with a\nmassless field via an Unruh-deWitt-type interaction. We first derive a general\nHamiltonian describing such a system and then, employing a Markovian master\nequation, we study the corresponding collective dynamics. In particular, we\nobserve that the emergence of entanglement between two-level atoms is linked to\nthe building up of coherences between them and to superradiant emission. In\naddition, we show that the derived Hamiltonian can be experimentally\nimplemented by employing impurities in Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  We developed a new method to measure superconducting stiffness $\\rho_{s}$,\ncritical current density $J^c$, and coherence length $\\xi$ without subjecting\nthe sample to magnetic field or attaching leads. The method is based on the\nLondon equation $\\mathbf{J}=-\\rho_{s}\\mathbf{A}$, where ${\\bf J}$ is the\ncurrent density and ${\\bf A}$ is the vector potential. Using a rotor free ${\\bf\nA}$ and a measurement of ${\\bf J}$ via the magnetic moment of a superconducting\nring, we determine $\\rho_{s}$. By increasing $\\mathbf{A}$ until the London\nequation does not hold anymore we determine $J^c$ and $\\xi$. The method is\nsensitive to very small stiffness, which translates to penetration depth\n$\\lambda \\lesssim 3$ mm. It is also sensitive to extremely low critical current\ndensity $J^c \\sim 1$ Acm$^{-2}$ or long coherence length $\\xi \\sim 1\\mu m$.\nNaturally, the method does not suffer from demagnetization factor\ncomplications, the presence of vortices, or out-of-equilibrium conditions.\nTherefore, the absolute values of the different parameters can be determined.\nWe demonstrate the application of this method to La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$.\n", "  We considered various types of potential noise in gates controlling\nnon-adiabatic holonomic transformations of spin-qubits in one and two\ndimensional systems with the Rashba interaction. It is shown how exact results\ncan be derived for deviations of spin rotation angle and fidelity of the qubit\ntransformation after a completed transformation. Errors in initial values of\ngate potentials and time-dependent drivings are considered and exact results\nfor white gate noise are derived and analysed in detail. It is demonstrated how\nthe drivings can be tuned to optimise the final fidelity of the transformation\nand to minimise the variances of qubit transformations.\n", "  Quantum critical points (QCPs) are widely accepted as a source of a diverse\nset of collective quantum phases of matter. A central question is how the order\nparameters of phases near a QCP interact and determine the fundamental\ncharacter of the critical dynamics which drive the quantum critical behavior.\nOne of the most interesting proposals for the quantum critical behavior that\noccurs in correlated electron systems is that the behavior may arise from\nlocal, as opposed to long wavelength, critical fluctuations of the order\nparameter. The local criticality is believed to give rise to energy over\ntemperature ($E/T$) scaling of the dynamic susceptibility with a fractional\nexponent near the quantum critical point (QCP). Here we show that $E/T$ scaling\nis indeed observed for CeCu$_{6-x}$Ag$_x$ but on closer inspection, the\nfluctuations can be separated into two components, implying that multiple order\nparameters play an important role in the unconventional critical behavior.\nAdditionally, when the fluctuations corresponding to the magnetically ordered\nside of the phase diagram are separated, they are found to be three dimensional\nand to obey the scaling behavior expected for long wavelength fluctuations near\nan itinerant antiferromagnetic QCP.\n", "  We describe a novel procedure for the calculation of correction factors for\ntaking into account the effect of target thickness to be applied to the\ndetermination of cross sections of X-ray emission induced by heavy ions at MeV\nenergies. We discuss the origin of the correction and describe the\ncalculations, based on simple polynomial fits of both the theoretical cross\nsections and the ion energy losses. The procedure can be easily implemented. We\nshow several examples for a set of targets specifically produced for cross\nsection measurements and for various combinations of ion type and energy.\n", "  We present evidence that the recently discovered, directly-imaged planet HD\n131399 Ab is a background star with non-zero proper motion. From new JHK1L'\nphotometry and spectroscopy obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager, VLT/SPHERE,\nand Keck/NIRC2, and a reanalysis of the discovery data obtained with\nVLT/SPHERE, we derive colors, spectra, and astrometry for HD 131399 Ab. The\nbroader wavelength coverage and higher data quality allow us to re-investigate\nits status. Its near-infrared spectral energy distribution excludes spectral\ntypes later than L0 and is consistent with a K or M dwarf, which are the most\nlikely candidates for a background object in this direction at the apparent\nmagnitude observed. If it were a physically associated object, the projected\nvelocity of HD 131399 Ab would exceed escape velocity given the mass and\ndistance to HD 131399 A. We show that HD 131399 Ab is also not following the\nexpected track for a stationary background star at infinite distance. Solving\nfor the proper motion and parallax required to explain the relative motion of\nHD 131399 Ab, we find a proper motion of 12.3 mas/yr. When compared to\npredicted background objects drawn from a galactic model, we find this proper\nmotion to be high, but consistent with the top 4% fastest-moving background\nstars. From our analysis we conclude that HD 131399 Ab is a background K or M\ndwarf.\n", "  This letter presents an extension of EPL116(2017)62001 to light- and\nstrange-quark nonequilibrium chemical phase-space occupancy factors\n($\\gamma_{q,s}$). The resulting damped trigonometric functionalities relating\n$\\gamma_{q,s}$ to the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies $(\\sqrt{s_{NN}})$\nlooks very similar except different coefficients. The phenomenology of the\nresulting $\\gamma_{q,s}(\\sqrt{s_{NN}})$ describes a rapid decrease at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\lesssim7~$GeV followed by a faster increase up to $\\sim20~$GeV.\nThen, both $\\gamma_{q,s}$ become nonsensitive to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. Although\nthese differ from $\\gamma_{s}(\\sqrt{s_{NN}})$ obtained at\n$\\gamma_q(\\sqrt{s_{NN}})=1$, various particle ratios including\n$\\mathrm{K}^+/\\pi^+$, $\\mathrm{K}^-/\\pi^-$, $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}/\\pi^-$,\n$\\bar{\\mathrm{\\Lambda}}/\\pi^-$, $\\mathrm{\\Xi}^+/\\pi^+$, and\n$\\mathrm{\\Omega}/\\pi^-$, can well be reproduced, as well. We conclude that\n$\\gamma_{q,s}(\\sqrt{s_{NN}})$ should be instead determined from fits of various\nparticle yields and ratios but not merely from fits to the particle ratio\n$\\mathrm{K}^+/\\pi^+$.\n", "  We study the invariance of stochastic differential equations under random\ndiffeomorphisms, and establish the determining equations for random Lie-point\nsymmetries of stochastic differential equations, both in Ito and in\nStratonovich form. We also discuss relations with previous results in the\nliterature.\n", "  The (In,Fe)Sb layers with the Fe content up to 13 at. % have been grown on\n(001) GaAs substrates using the pulsed laser deposition. The TEM investigations\nshow that the (In,Fe)Sb layers are epitaxial and free of the inclusions of a\nsecond phase. The observation of the hysteretic magnetoresistance curves at\ntemperatures up to 300 K reveals that the Curie point is above room\ntemperature. The resonant character of magnetic circular dichroism confirms the\nintrinsic ferromagnetism in the (In,Fe)Sb layers. We suggest that the\nferromagnetism of the (In,Fe)Sb matrix is not carrier-mediated and apparently\nis determined by the mechanism of superexchange interaction between Fe atoms\n(This work was presented at the XXI Symposium Nanophysics and Nanoelectronics,\nNizhny Novgorod, March, 13-16, 2017 (book of proceedings v.1, p. 195),\nhttp://nanosymp.ru/UserFiles/Symp/2017_v1.pdf).\n", "  The thermodynamics of the Stranski-Krastanov mode of epitaxial growth and the\neffect of the sign of the lattice misfit are discussed. The Stranski-Krastanov\nmode of growth represents a sequence of layer-by-layer or Frank-van der Merwe\ngrowth followed by the formation of three-dimensional (3D) islands or\nVolmer-Weber growth. The occurrence of both growth modes mentioned above is in\ncompliance with the wettability criterion of Bauer. The positive wetting\nfunction required for the occurrence of the Volmer-Weber growth is originated\nby the vertical displacements of the atoms close to the edges of the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) islands as a result of the relaxation of the lattice\nmisfit. The monolayer high islands become unstable against bilayer islands,\nbilayer islands in turn become unstable against trilayer islands, etc. beyond\nsome critical islands sizes. Monolayer islands appear as necessary precursors\nof three-dimensional (3D) islands. The critical island size for mono-bilayer\ntransformation increases steeply with decreasing lattice misfit and diverges at\na critical value of the misfit. This value divides the regions of Frank-van der\nMerwe and Stranski-Krastanov modes in a phase diagram of coordinates\nwetting-misfit. The transformation of monolayer to multilayer islands takes\nplace either by consecutive nucleation and growth of 2D islands (layer-by-layer\ntransformation), or by nucleation and lateral (2D) growth of multilayer islands\n(multilayer 2D transformation). The former occurs in the case of \"stiff\"\noverlayer materials and mostly in compressed overlayers. The latter takes place\nin the case of \"soft\" materials like Pb and In, mostly in tensile overlayers.\nTensile films show non-nucleation transformation compared with the\nnucleation-like behavior of compressed films.\n", "  We carry out simulations of gravitationally unstable disks using smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics(SPH) and the novel Lagrangian meshless finite mass (MFM)\nscheme in the GIZMO code (Hopkins 2015). Our aim is to understand the cause of\nthe non-convergence of the cooling boundary for fragmentation reported in the\nliterature. We run SPH simulations with two different artificial viscosity\nimplementations, and compare them with MFM, which does not employ any\nartificial viscosity. With MFM we demonstrate convergence of the critical\ncooling time scale for fragmentation at \\beta_{crit} =3.. Non-convergence\npersists in SPH codes, although it is significantly mitigated with schemes\nhaving reduced artificial viscosity such as inviscid SPH (ISPH) (Cullen &\nDehnen 2010). We show how the non-convergence problem is caused by artificial\nfragmentation triggered by excessive dissipation of angular momentum in domains\nwith large velocity derivatives. With increased resolution such domains become\nmore prominent. Vorticity lags behind density due to numerical viscous\ndissipation in these regions, promoting collapse with longer cooling times.\nSuch effect is shown to be dominant over the competing tendency of artificial\nviscosity to diminish with increasing resolution. When the initial conditions\nare first relaxed for several orbits, the flow is more regular, with lower\nshear and vorticity in non-axisymmetric regions, aiding convergence. Yet MFM is\nthe only method that converges exactly. Our findings are of general interest as\nnumerical dissipation via artificial viscosity or advection errors can also\noccur in grid-based codes. Indeed for the FARGO code values of \\beta_{crit}\nsignificantly higher than our converged estimate have been reported in the\nliterature. Finally, we discuss implications for giant planet formation via\ndisk instability.\n", "  The upcoming SKA1-Low radio interferometer will be sensitive enough to\nproduce tomographic imaging data of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch\nof Reionization. Due to the non-Gaussian distribution of the signal, a power\nspectrum analysis alone will not provide a complete description of its\nproperties. Here, we consider an additional metric which could be derived from\ntomographic imaging data, namely the bubble size distribution of ionized\nregions. We study three methods that have previously been used to characterize\nbubble size distributions in simulation data for the hydrogen ionization\nfraction - the spherical-average, mean-free-path and friends-of-friends methods\n- and apply them to simulated 21-cm data cubes. Our simulated data cubes have\nthe (sensitivity-dictated) resolution expected for the SKA1-Low reionization\nexperiment and we study the impact of both the light-cone and redshift space\ndistortion effects. To identify ionized regions in the 21-cm data we introduce\na new, self-adjusting thresholding approach based on the K-Means algorithm. We\nfind that the fraction of ionized cells identified in this way consistently\nfalls below the mean volume-averaged ionized fraction. From a comparison of the\nthree bubble size methods, we conclude that all three methods are useful, but\nthat the mean-free-path method performs best in terms of tracking the progress\nof reionization and separating different reionization scenarios. The light-cone\neffect is found to affect data spanning more than about 10~MHz in frequency\n($\\Delta z\\sim0.5$). We find that redshift space distortions only marginally\naffect the bubble size distributions.\n", "  We have discovered that the extremely red, low-gravity L7 dwarf 2MASS\nJ11193254-1137466 is a 0.14\" (3.6 AU) binary using Keck laser guide star\nadaptive optics imaging. 2MASS J11193254-1137466 has previously been identified\nas a likely member of the TW Hydrae Association (TWA). Using our updated\nphotometric distance and proper motion, a kinematic analysis based on the\nBANYAN II model gives an 82% probability of TWA membership. At TWA's 10$\\pm$3\nMyr age and using hot-start evolutionary models, 2MASS J11193254-1137466AB is a\npair of $3.7^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$ brown dwarfs, making it the\nlowest-mass binary discovered to date. We estimate an orbital period of\n$90^{+80}_{-50}$ years. One component is marginally brighter in $K$ band but\nfainter in $J$ band, making this a probable flux-reversal binary, the first\ndiscovered with such a young age. We also imaged the spectrally similar TWA L7\ndwarf WISEA J114724.10-204021.3 with Keck and found no sign of binarity. Our\nevolutionary model-derived $T_{\\rm eff}$ estimate for WISEA J114724.10-204021.3\nis $\\approx$230 K higher than for 2MASS J11193254-1137466AB, at odds with their\nspectral similarity. This discrepancy suggests that WISEA J114724.10-204021.3\nmay actually be a tight binary with masses and temperatures very similar to\n2MASS J11193254-1137466AB, or further supporting the idea that near-infrared\nspectra of young ultracool dwarfs are shaped by factors other than temperature\nand gravity. 2MASS J11193254-1137466AB will be an essential benchmark for\ntesting evolutionary and atmospheric models in the young planetary-mass regime.\n", "  I will sketchily illustrate how the theory of symmetry helps in determining\nsolutions of (deterministic) differential equations, both ODEs and PDEs,\nstaying within the classical theory. I will then present a quick discussion of\nsome more and less recent attempts to extend this theory to the study of\nstochastic differential equations, and briefly mention some perspective in this\ndirection.\n", "  3D Dirac semimetals are an emerging class of materials that possess\ntopological electronic states with a Dirac dispersion in their bulk. In\nnodal-line Dirac semimetals, the conductance and valence bands connect along a\nclosed path in momentum space, leading to the prediction of pseudospin vortex\nrings and pseudospin skyrmions. Here, we use Fourier transform scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy (FT-STS) at 4.5 K to resolve quasiparticle interference\n(QPI) patterns at single defect centers on the surface of the line nodal\nsemimetal zirconium silicon sulfide (ZrSiS). Our QPI measurements show\npseudospin conservation at energies close to the line node. In addition, we\ndetermine the Fermi velocity to be $\\hbar v_F = 2.65 \\pm 0.10$ eV {\\AA} in the\n{\\Gamma}-M direction ~300 meV above the Fermi energy $E_F$, and the line node\nto be ~140 meV above $E_F$. More importantly, we find that certain scatterers\ncan introduce energy-dependent non-preservation of pseudospins, giving rise to\neffective scattering between states with opposite valley pseudospin deep inside\nvalence and conduction bands. Further investigations of quasiparticle\ninterference at the atomic level will aid defect engineering at the synthesis\nlevel, needed for the development of lower-power electronics via\ndissipationless electronic transport in the future.\n", "  e-ASTROGAM is a gamma-ray space mission proposed for the fifth Medium-size\nmission (M5) of the European Space Agency. It is dedicated to the study of the\nnon-thermal Universe in the photon energy range from ~0.15 MeV to 3 GeV with\nunprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy resolution, together with a\ngroundbreaking capability for gamma-ray polarimetric measurements over its\nentire bandwidth. We discuss here the main polarization results expected at low\nenergies, between 150 keV and 5 MeV, using Compton interactions in the\ne-ASTROGAM instrument, from observations of active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray\nbursts, microquasars, and the Crab pulsar and nebula. The anticipated\nperformance of the proposed observatory for polarimetry is illustrated by\nsimulations of the polarization signals expected from various sources. We show\nthat polarimetric analyses with e-ASTROGAM should provide definitive insight\ninto the geometry, magnetization and content of the high-energy plasmas found\nin the emitting sources, as well as on the processes of radiation of these\nplasmas.\n", "  Based on experimental traffic data obtained from German and US highways, we\npropose a novel two-dimensional first-order macroscopic traffic flow model. The\ngoal is to reproduce a detailed description of traffic dynamics for the real\nroad geometry. In our approach both the dynamic along the road and across the\nlanes is continuous. The closure relations, being necessary to complete the\nhydrodynamic equation, are obtained by regression on fundamental diagram data.\nComparison with prediction of one-dimensional models shows the improvement in\nperformance of the novel model.\n", "  Effective Polyakov line actions are a powerful tool to study the finite\ntemperature behaviour of lattice gauge theories. They are much simpler to\nsimulate than the original lattice model and are affected by a milder sign\nproblem, but it is not clear to which extent they really capture the rich\nspectrum of the original theories. We propose here a simple way to address this\nissue based on the so called second moment correlation length $\\xi_{2nd}$. The\nratio $\\xi/\\xi_{2nd}$ between the exponential correlation length and the second\nmoment one is equal to 1 if only a single mass is present in the spectrum, and\nit becomes larger and larger as the complexity of the spectrum increases. Since\nboth $\\xi$ and $\\xi_{2nd}$ are easy to measure on the lattice, this is a cheap\nand efficient way to keep track of the spectrum of the theory. As an example of\nthe information one can obtain with this tool we study the behaviour of\n$\\xi/\\xi_{2nd}$ in the confining phase of the ($D=3+1$) $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge\ntheory and show that it is compatible with 1 near the deconfinement transition,\nbut it increases dramatically as the temperature decreases. We also show that\nthis increase can be well understood in the framework of an effective string\ndescription of the Polyakov loop correlator. This non-trivial behaviour should\nbe reproduced by the Polyakov loop effective action; thus, it represents a\nstringent and challenging test of existing proposals and it may be used to\nfine-tune the couplings and to identify the range of validity of the\napproximations involved in their construction.\n", "  We study magnetic excitations in a bilayer of an antiferromagnetic (AF)\ninsulator and a correlated metal, in which double occupancy is forbidden. The\neffective action of the AF spin wave in the AF insulator is derived by using\nthe path integral formula within the second order of interplane coupling. The\nelectron correlation in the correlated metal is treated by the Gutzwiller\napproximation, which renormalizes the hopping integrals by g_t as proportional\nto the hole density. The linewidth of the AF spin wave excitations originates\nfrom particle-hole excitations in the correlated metal. By increasing the\ncorrelation effect, i.e., by decreasing g_t, it is found that the linewidth at\nlow energies increases inversely proportional to g_t. The present results will\nalso be useful for bilayers of a metal and ferrimagnet.\n", "  The merger of a neutron star (NS) binary may result in the formation of a\nlong-lived, or indefinitely stable, millisecond magnetar remnant surrounded by\na low-mass ejecta shell. A portion of the magnetar's prodigious rotational\nenergy is deposited behind the ejecta in a pulsar wind nebula, powering\nluminous optical/X-ray emission for hours to days following the merger. Ions in\nthe pulsar wind may also be accelerated to ultra-high energies, providing a\ncoincident source of high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. At early times, the\ncosmic rays experience strong synchrotron losses; however, after a day or so,\npion production through photomeson interaction with thermal photons in the\nnebula comes to dominate, leading to efficient production of high-energy\nneutrinos. After roughly a week, the density of background photons decreases\nsufficiently for cosmic rays to escape the source without secondary production.\nThese competing effects result in a neutrino light curve that peaks on a few\nday timescale near an energy of $\\sim10^{18}$ eV. This signal may be detectable\nfor individual mergers out to $\\sim$ 10 (100) Mpc by current (next-generation)\nneutrino telescopes, providing clear evidence for a long-lived NS remnant, the\npresence of which may otherwise be challenging to identify from the\ngravitational waves alone. Under the optimistic assumption that a sizable\nfraction of NS mergers produce long-lived magnetars, the cumulative\ncosmological neutrino background is estimated to be $\\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-8}\\,\\rm\nGeV\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}\\,sr^{-1}$ for a NS merger rate of $10^{-7}\\,\\rm\nMpc^{-3}\\,yr^{-1}$, overlapping with IceCube's current sensitivity and within\nthe reach of next-generation neutrino telescopes.\n", "  We consider a nonlocal gravity model motivated by nonperturbative Quantum\nGravity studies. This model, if correct, suggests the existence of strong IR\nrelevant effects which can lead to an interesting late time cosmology. We\nimplement the IR modification directly in the effective action. We show that,\nupon some assumptions on initial conditions, this model describes an\nobservationally viable background cosmology being also consistent with local\ngravity tests.\n", "  Superstatistics is a widely employed tool of non-equilibrium statistical\nphysics which plays an important role in analysis of hierarchical complex\ndynamical systems. Yet, its \"canonical\" formulation in terms of a single\nnuisance parameter is often too restrictive when applied to complex empirical\ndata. Here we show that a multi-scale generalization of the superstatistics\nparadigm is more versatile, allowing to address such pertinent issues as\ntransmutation of statistics or inter-scale stochastic behavior. To put some\nflesh on the bare bones, we provide a numerical evidence for a transition\nbetween two superstatistics regimes, by analyzing high-frequency (minute-tick)\ndata for share-price returns of seven selected companies. Salient issues, such\nas breakdown of superstatistics in fractional diffusion processes or connection\nwith Brownian subordination are also briefly discussed.\n", "  Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) analyzes traditional real-space\nmicroscope images to extract information on sample dynamics in a way akin to\nlight scattering, by decomposing each image in a sequence into Fourier modes,\nand evaluating their time correlation properties. DDM has been applied in a\nnumber of soft-matter and colloidal systems. However, objects observed to move\nout of the microscope's captured field of view, intersecting the edges of the\nacquired images, can introduce spurious but significant errors in the\nsubsequent analysis. Here we show that application of a spatial windowing\nfilter to images in a sequence before they enter the standard DDM analysis can\nreduce these artifacts substantially. Moreover, windowing can increase\nsignificantly the accessible range of wave vectors probed by DDM, and may\nfurther yield unexpected information, such as the size polydispersity of a\ncolloidal suspension.\n", "  We experimentally study the phase stabilization of a semiconductor double\nquantum dot (DQD) single atom maser by injection locking. A voltage-biased DQD\nserves as an electrically tunable microwave frequency gain medium. The\nstatistics of the maser output field demonstrate that the maser can be phase\nlocked to an external cavity drive, with a resulting phase noise of -99 dBc/Hz\nat a frequency offset of 1.3 MHz. The injection locking range, and the phase of\nthe maser output relative to the injection locking input tone are in good\nagreement with Adler's theory. Furthermore, the electrically tunable DQD energy\nlevel structure allows us to rapidly switch the gain medium on and off,\nresulting in an emission spectrum that resembles a frequency comb. The free\nrunning frequency comb linewidth is ~8 kHz and can be improved to less than 1\nHz by operating the comb in the injection locked regime.\n", "  Understanding how soft particles can fill the space is still an open\nquestion. Structures far from classical FCC or BCC phases are now commonly\nexperimentally observed in many different systems. Models based on pair\ninteraction between soft particle are at present much studied in 2D. Pair\ninteraction with two different lengths have been shown to lead to\nquasicrystalline architectures. It is also the case for a hard core with a\nsquare repulsive shoulder potential. In 3D, global approaches have been\nproposed for instance by minimizing the interface area between the deformed\nobjects in the case of foams or micellar systems or using self-consistent mean\nfield theory in copolymer melts. In this paper we propose to compare a strong\nvan der Waals attraction between spherical hard cores and an elastic energy\nassociated to the deformation of the soft corona. This deformation is measured\nas the shift between the deformed shell compared to a corona with a perfect\nspherical symmetry. The two main parameters in this model are: the hard core\nvolume fraction and the weight of the elastic energy compared to the van der\nWaals one. The elastic energy clearly favours the BCC structure but large van\nder Waals forces favors Frank and Kasper phases. This result opens a route\ntowards controlling the building of nanoparticle superlattices with complex\nstructures and thus original physical properties.\n", "  We present predictions of the K\\\"ahler moduli inflation model for the\nspectral tilt by parametrising the reheating epoch by an effective\nequation-of-state parameter and the number of e-foldings of reheating; and\ntaking into account the post-inflationary history of the model. This model has\nan epoch in which the energy density of the universe is dominated by cold\nmoduli particles. We compare our results with data from the PLANCK mission and\nfind that exotic reheating (with effective equation of state $w_{\\rm re}$\ngreater than 1/3) is required to match the observations. For canonical\nreheating case with $w_{\\rm re} = 0$, we deduce $\\text{log}_{10}(T_{\\rm\nre}/10^3~ \\text{GeV}) \\simeq 1190 (n_s - 0.956)$. We also analyse our results\nin the context of observations being planned for the future and their projected\nsensitivities.\n", "  The Renyi entropy is a generalisation of the Shannon entropy that is\nsensitive to the fine details of a probability distribution. We present results\nfor the Renyi entropy of the totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP). We\ncalculate explicitly an entropy whereby the squares of configuration\nprobabilities are summed, using the matrix product formalism to map the problem\nto one involving a six direction lattice walk in the upper quarter plane. We\nderive the generating function across the whole phase diagram, using an\nobstinate kernel method. This gives the leading behaviour of the Renyi entropy\nand corrections in all phases of the TASEP. The leading behaviour is given by\nthe result for a Bernoulli measure and we conjecture that this holds for all\nRenyi entropies. Within the maximal current phase the correction to the leading\nbehaviour is logarithmic in the system size. Finally, we remark upon a special\nproperty of equilibrium systems whereby discontinuities in the Renyi entropy\narise away from phase transitions, which we refer to as secondary transitions.\nWe find no such secondary transition for this nonequilibrium system, supporting\nthe notion that these are specific to equilibrium cases.\n", "  We present a summary of our recent publication concerning the derivation of\nthe extended Casimir-Polder dispersive interaction between two neutrons.\nDynamical polarizations of the neutrons, recently derived within Chiral\nEffective Theory are used for the purpose. An account of the higher\nfrequency/energy behavior of these entities related to the opening of one-pion\nproduction channel and the excitation of the $\\Delta$ resonance are taken into\nconsideration in our derivation of the CP interaction. The neutron-neutron\nsystem in free space is treated in details so are the neutron-wall and the\nwall-neutron-wall systems. The case of tetraneutron (a 4 neutron system) in a\nresonant state is then briefly considered. The 4n CP interaction is evaluated\nto assess its potential relevance to the ongoing debate concerning the nature\nof the tetraneutron.\n", "  We study the crossover between the sudden quench limit and the adiabatic\ndynamics of superconducting states in the attractive Hubbard model. We focus on\nthe dynamics induced by the change of the attractive interaction during a\nfinite ramp time which is varied in order to track the evolution of the\ndynamical phase diagram from the sudden quench to the equilibrium limit. Two\ndifferent dynamical regimes are realized for quenches towards weak and strong\ncoupling interactions. At weak coupling the dynamics depends only on the energy\ninjected into the system, whereas a dynamics retaining memory of the initial\nstate takes place at strong coupling. We show that this is related to a sharp\ntransition between a weak and a strong coupling quench dynamical regime, which\ndefines the boundaries beyond which a dynamics independent from the initial\nstate is recovered. Comparing the dynamics in the superconducting and\nnon-superconducting phases we argue that this is due to the lack of an\nadiabatic connection to the equilibrium ground state for non-equilibrium\nsuperconducting states in the strong coupling quench regime.\n", "  We study the critical properties of the QED$_3$-Gross-Neveu model with $2N$\nflavors of two-component Dirac fermions coupled to a massless scalar field and\na U(1) gauge field. For $N=1$, this theory has recently been suggested to be\ndual to the SU(2) noncompact CP$^1$ model that describes the deconfined phase\ntransition between the Neel antiferromagnet and the valence bond solid on the\nsquare lattice. For $N=2$, the theory has been proposed as an effective\ndescription of a deconfined critical point between chiral and Dirac spin liquid\nphases, and may potentially be realizable in spin-$1/2$ systems on the kagome\nlattice. We demonstrate the existence of a stable quantum critical point in the\nQED$_3$-Gross-Neveu model for all values of $N$. This quantum critical point is\nshown to escape the notorious fixed-point annihilation mechanism that renders\nplain QED$_3$ (without scalar-field coupling) unstable at low values of $N$.\nThe theory exhibits an upper critical space-time dimension of four, enabling us\nto access the critical behavior in a controlled expansion in the small\nparameter $\\epsilon = 4-D$. We compute the scalar-field anomalous dimension\n$\\eta_\\phi$, the correlation-length exponent $\\nu$, as well as the scaling\ndimension of the flavor-symmetry-breaking bilinear $\\bar\\psi\\sigma^z\\psi$ at\nthe critical point, and compare our leading-order estimates with predictions of\nthe conjectured duality.\n", "  Recent theoretical studies of a pair of atoms in a 1D waveguide find that the\nsystem responds asymmetrically to incident fields from opposing directions at\nlow powers. Since there is no explicit time-reversal symmetry breaking elements\nin the device, this has caused some debate. Here we show that the asymmetry\narises from the formation of a quasi-dark-state of the two atoms, which\nsaturates at extremely low power. In this case the nonlinear saturability\nexplicitly breaks the assumptions of the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. Moreover,\nwe show that the statistics of the output field from the driven system can be\nexplained by a very simple stochastic mirror model and that at steady state,\nthe two atoms and the local field are driven to an entangled, tripartite\n$\\left| W \\right\\rangle$ state. Because of this, we argue that the device is\nbetter understood as a saturable Yagi-Uda antenna, a distributed system of\ndifferentially-tuned dipoles that couples asymmetrically to external fields.\n", "  We revisit the effects of the Hubbard repulsion on quantum spin Hall effects\n(QSHE) in two-dimensional quantum lattice models. We present both unbiased\nexact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group simulations with\nnumerical evidences for a continuous quantum phase transition (CQPT) separating\nQSHE from the topologically trivial antiferromagnetic phase. Our numerical\nresults suggest that, the nature of CQPT exhibits distinct finite-size scaling\nbehaviors, which may be consistent with either Ising or XY universality classes\nfor different time-reversal symmetric QSHE systems.\n", "  Chess is an emblematic sport that stands out because of its age, popularity\nand complexity. It has served to study human behavior from the perspective of a\nwide number of disciplines, from cognitive skills such as memory and learning,\nto aspects like innovation and decision making. Given that an extensive\ndocumentation of chess games played throughout history is available, it is\npossible to perform detailed and statistically significant studies about this\nsport. Here we use one of the most extensive chess databases in the world to\nconstruct two networks of chess players. One of the networks includes games\nthat were played over-the-board and the other contains games played on the\nInternet. We study the main topological characteristics of the networks, such\nas degree distribution and correlations, transitivity and community structure.\nWe complement the structural analysis by incorporating players' level of play\nas node metadata. Although both networks are topologically different, we show\nthat in both cases players gather in communities according to their expertise\nand that an emergent rich-club structure, composed by the top-rated players, is\nalso present.\n", "  The repeating FRB 121102 emitted a pair of discrete bursts separated by 37 ms\nand another pair, 131 days later, separated by 34 ms, during observations that\ndetected FRB at a mean rate of $2 \\times 10^{-4}$/s. Here I assume that these\nevents are separate bursts rather than multiple peaks from longer single bursts\nand consider their implications. They then are inconsistent with Poissonian\nstatistics. The measured intervals constrain any possible periodic modulation\nunderlying the highly episodic emission. If more such short intervals are\nmeasured a period may be determined or periodicity may be excluded. Sources of\nnarrow wandering beams predict pairs (or higher multiples) of bursts closely\nspaced in time compared to the mean event rate.\n", "  Transition-edge sensors (TES) as microcalorimeters for high-energy-resolution\nX-ray spectroscopy are often fabricated with an absorber made of materials with\nhigh Z (for X-ray stopping power) and low heat capacity (for high resolving\npower). Bismuth represents one of the most compelling options. TESs with\nevaporated bismuth absorbers have shown spectra with undesirable and\nunexplained low-energy tails. We have developed TESs with electroplated bismuth\nabsorbers over a gold layer that are not afflicted by this problem and that\nretain the other positive aspects of this material. To better understand these\nphenomena, we have studied a series of TESs with gold, gold/evaporated bismuth,\nand gold/electroplated bismuth absorbers, fabricated on the same die with\nidentical thermal coupling. We show that bismuth morphology is linked to the\nspectral response of X-ray TES microcalorimeters.\n", "  The 'optical spring' results from dynamical back-action and can be used to\nimprove the sensitivity of cavity-enhanced gravitational-wave detectors. The\neffect occurs if an oscillation of the cavity length results in an oscillation\nof the intra-cavity light power having such a phase relation that the light's\nradiation pressure force amplifies the oscillation of the cavity length. Here,\nwe analyse a Michelson interferometer whose optical-spring cavity includes an\nadditional optical-parametric amplifier with adjustable phase. We find that the\nphase of the parametric pump field is a versatile parameter for shaping the\ninterferometer's spectral density.\n", "  In this work, we interpreted the high braking index of PSR J1640$-$4631 with\na combination of the magneto-dipole radiation and dipole magnetic field decay\nmodels. By introducing a mean rotation energy conversion coefficient\n$\\overline{\\zeta}$, the ratio of the total high-energy photon energy to the\ntotal rotation energy loss in the whole life of the pulsar, and combining the\npulsar's high-energy and timing observations with reliable nuclear equation of\nstate, we estimate the pulsar's initial spin period, $P_{0}\\sim (17-44)$ ms,\ncorresponding to the moment of inertia $I\\sim (0.8-2.1)\\times 10^{45}$ g\ncm$^{2}$. Assuming that PSR J1640$-$4631 has experienced a long-term\nexponential decay of the dipole magnetic field, we calculate the true age\n$t_{\\rm age}$, the effective magnetic field decay timescale $\\tau_{D}$, and the\ninitial surface dipole magnetic field at the pole $B_{p}(0)$ of the pulsar to\nbe $(2900-3100)$ yrs, $1.07(2)\\times10^{5}$ yrs, and $(1.84-4.20)\\times10^{13}$\nG, respectively. The measured braking index of $n=3.15(3)$ for PSR J1640$-$4631\nis attributed to its long-term dipole magnetic field decay and a low magnetic\nfield decay rate, $dB_{\\rm p}/dt\\sim -(1.66-3.85)\\times10^{8}$ G yr$^{-1}$. Our\nmodel can be applied to both the high braking index ($n>3$) and low braking\nindex ($n<3$) pulsars, tested by the future polarization, timing, and\nhigh-energy observations of PSR J1640$-$4631.\n", "  We present derivation and implementation of the Multi-Configurational\nStrong-Field Approximation with Gaussian nuclear Wave Packets (MC-SFA-GWP) -- a\nversion of the molecular strong-field approximation which treats all electronic\nand nuclear degrees of freedom, including their correlations,\nquantum-mechanically. The technique allows, for the first time, realistic\nsimulation of high-harmonic emission in polyatomic molecules without invoking\nreduced-dimensionality models for the nuclear motion or the electronic\nstructure. We use MC-SFA-GWP to model isotope effects in high-harmonics\ngeneration (HHG) spectroscopy of methane. The HHG emission in this molecule\ntransiently involves strongly vibronically-coupled $^2F_2$ electronic state of\nthe $\\rm CH_4^+$ cation. We show that the isotopic HHG ratio in methane\ncontains signatures of: a) field-free vibronic dynamics at the conical\nintersection (CI); b) resonant features in the recombination cross-sections; c)\nlaser-driven bound-state dynamics; as well as d) the well-known short-time\nGaussian decay of the emission. We assign the intrinsic vibronic feature (a) to\na relatively long-lived ($\\ge4$ fs) vibronic wave packet of the singly-excited\n$\\nu_4$ ($t_2$) and $\\nu_2$ ($e$) vibrational modes, strongly coupled to the\ncomponents of the $^2F_2$ electronic state. We demonstrate that these physical\neffects differ in their dependence on the wavelength, intensity, and duration\nof the driving pulse, allowing them to be disentangled. We thus show that HHG\nspectroscopy provides a versatile tool for exploring both conical intersections\nand resonant features in photorecombination matrix elements in the regime not\neasily accessible with other techniques.\n", "  We study the pair-production process in the presence of two\ncounterpropagating linearly polarized short laser pulses. By means of a\nnonperturbative technique, we take into account the full coordinate dependence\nof the external field going beyond the dipole and standing-wave approximations.\nIn particular, we analyze the momentum distribution of particles created. It is\ndemonstrated that the spatial variations of the laser pulses may play a crucial\nrole. The more accurate treatment reveals a number of prominent features: the\npair-production probabilities become considerably smaller, the quantitative\nbehavior of the momentum spectra changes dramatically, and the pulse shape\neffects become much less pronounced. The results of our study are expected to\nbe very important for future theoretical and experimental investigations.\n", "  We investigate the long-term spectral variability in the ultra-luminous X-ray\nsource Holmberg IX X--1. By analyzing the data from eight {\\it Suzaku} and 13\n{\\it XMM-Newton} observations conducted between 2001 and 2015, we perform a\ndetailed spectral modeling for all spectra with simple models and complex\nphysical models. We find that the spectra can be well explained by a disc plus\nthermal Comptonization model. Applying this model, we unveil correlations\nbetween the X-ray luminosity ($L_{\\rm X}$) and the spectral parameters. Among\nthe correlations, a particular one is the statistically significant positive\ncorrelation between $L_{\\rm X}$ and the photon index ($\\Gamma$), while at the\nhigh luminosities of $> 2\\times10^{40}\\,{\\rm~erg\\ s}^{-1}$, the source becomes\nmarginally hard and that results a change in the slope of the $\\Gamma - L_{\\rm\nX}$ correlation. Similar variability behavior is observed in the optical depth\nof the source around $L_{\\rm X} \\sim 2\\times10^{40}\\,{\\rm~erg\\ s}^{-1}$ as the\nsource becomes more optically thick. We consider the scenario that a corona\ncovers the inner part of the disc, and the correlations can be explained as to\nbe driven by the variability of seed photons from the disc input into the\ncorona. On the basis of the disc-corona model, we discuss the physical\nprocesses that are possibly indicated by the variability of the spectral\nparameters. Our analysis reveals the complex variability behavior of Holmberg\nIX X--1 and the variability mechanism is likely related to the geometry of the\nX-ray emitting regions.\n", "  The Higgs boson discovery stirred interest in next-to-minimal supersymmetric\nmodels, due to the apparent fine-tuning required to accommodate it in minimal\ntheories. To assess their naturalness, we compare fine-tuning in a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ conserving semi-constrained Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (NMSSM) to the constrained MSSM (CMSSM). We contrast popular\nfine-tuning measures with naturalness priors, which automatically appear in\nstatistical measures of the plausibility that a given model reproduces the weak\nscale. Our comparison shows that naturalness priors provide valuable insight\ninto the hierarchy problem and rigorously ground naturalness in Bayesian\nstatistics. For the CMSSM and semi-constrained NMSSM we demonstrate qualitative\nagreement between naturalness priors and popular fine tuning measures. Thus, we\ngive a clear plausibility argument that favours relatively light superpartners.\n", "  In this work, a mechanism for improving the quantum state transfer efficiency\nin a spin chain, which is in contact with a dissipative structured reservoir,\nis investigated. The efficiency of the method is based on the addition of\nsimilar non-interacting auxiliary chains into the reservoir. In this regard, we\nobtain the exact solution for the master equation of the spin chain in the\npresence of dissipation. It is found out that entering more auxiliary chains\ninto the reservoir causes, in general, the better improvement of the fidelity\nof state transfer along the mentioned chain. Furthermore, it is reveal that the\nprotocol has better efficiency for a chain with longer length. Therefore, by\nthis method, quantum state transfer along a linear chain with an arbitrary\nnumber of qubits, can be well-protected against the dissipative noises.\n", "  We compute the time-dependent complexity of the thermofield double states by\nfour different proposals: two holographic proposals based on the\n\"complexity-action\" (CA) conjecture and \"complexity-volume\" (CV) conjecture,\nand two quantum field theoretic proposals based on the Fubini-Study metric (FS)\nand Finsler geometry (FG). We find that four different proposals yield both\nsimilarities and differences, which will be useful to deepen our understanding\non the complexity and sharpen its definition. In particular, at early time the\ncomplexity linearly increase in the CV and FG proposals, linearly decreases in\nthe FS proposal, and does not change in the CA proposal. In the late time\nlimit, the CA, CV and FG proposals all show that the growth rate is\n$2E/(\\pi\\hbar)$ saturating the Lloyd's bound, while the FS proposal shows the\ngrowth rate is zero. It seems that the holographic CV conjecture and the field\ntheoretic FG method are more correlated.\n", "  Optical phase-modulated fringe-patterns are usually digitized with XxY pixels\nand 8 bits/pixel (or higher) gray-levels. The digitized 8 bits/pixel are\nraw-data bits, not Shannon information bits. Here we show that noisy\nfringe-patterns store much less Shannon information than the capacity of the\ndigitizing camera. This means that high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) cameras may\nwaste to noise most bits/pixel. For example one would not use smartphone\ncameras for high quality phase-metrology, because of their lower (S/N) images.\nHowever smartphones digitize high-resolution (12 megapixel) images, and as we\nshow here, the information storage of an image depends on its bandwidth and its\n(S/N). The standard formalism for measuring information are the Shannon-entropy\nH, and the Shannon capacity theorem (SCT). According to SCT, low (S/N) images\nmay be compensated with a larger fringe-bandwidth to obtain high-information\nphase measurements. So broad bandwidth fringes may give high quality phase, in\nspite of digitizing low (S/N) fringe images. Most real-life images are\nredundant, they have smooth zones where the pixel-value do not change much, and\ndata compression algorithms are paramount for image transmission/storage.\nShannon's capacity theorem is used to gauge competing image compression\nalgorithms. Here we show that phase-modulated phase-shifted fringes are highly\ncorrelated, and as a consequence, phase-shifting algorithms (PSAs) may be used\nas fringe-data compressors. Therefore a PSA may compress a large number of\nphase-shifted fringes into a single complex-valued image. This is important in\nspaceborne optical/RADAR phase-telemetry where downlink is severely limited by\nhuge distance and low-power downlink. That is, instead of transmitting M\nphase-shifted fringes, one only transmit the phase-demodulated signal as\ncompressed sensing data.\n", "  The Paulsen problem is a basic open problem in operator theory: Given vectors\n$u_1, \\ldots, u_n \\in \\mathbb R^d$ that are $\\epsilon$-nearly satisfying the\nParseval's condition and the equal norm condition, is it close to a set of\nvectors $v_1, \\ldots, v_n \\in \\mathbb R^d$ that exactly satisfy the Parseval's\ncondition and the equal norm condition? Given $u_1, \\ldots, u_n$, the squared\ndistance (to the set of exact solutions) is defined as $\\inf_{v} \\sum_{i=1}^n\n\\| u_i - v_i \\|_2^2$ where the infimum is over the set of exact solutions.\nPrevious results show that the squared distance of any $\\epsilon$-nearly\nsolution is at most $O({\\rm{poly}}(d,n,\\epsilon))$ and there are\n$\\epsilon$-nearly solutions with squared distance at least $\\Omega(d\\epsilon)$.\nThe fundamental open question is whether the squared distance can be\nindependent of the number of vectors $n$.\n  We answer this question affirmatively by proving that the squared distance of\nany $\\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^{13/2} \\epsilon)$. Our approach is based\non a continuous version of the operator scaling algorithm and consists of two\nparts. First, we define a dynamical system based on operator scaling and use it\nto prove that the squared distance of any $\\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^2\nn \\epsilon)$. Then, we show that by randomly perturbing the input vectors, the\ndynamical system will converge faster and the squared distance of an\n$\\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^{5/2} \\epsilon)$ when $n$ is large enough\nand $\\epsilon$ is small enough. To analyze the convergence of the dynamical\nsystem, we develop some new techniques in lower bounding the operator capacity,\na concept introduced by Gurvits to analyze the operator scaling algorithm.\n", "  The correlation functions of certain $n$-cluster XY models are explicitly\nexpressed in terms of those of the standard Ising chain in transverse field.\n", "  Movement behavior of biological entities plays a crucial role in their\ndestiny through regulating their intraspecific and interspecific interactions\nas well as their interaction with surrounding environment. In spite of various\nmodels for population dynamics, the effect of movement behavior and\nheterogeneity of environment on population dynamics has remained poorly\nunderstood. We introduced an extended version of Kolmogorov equation which\ncaptures movement behavior and translated our model to a biased random walk on\npercolation lattice. Then we explored the effect of mentioned topic on\npopulation dynamics, especially for intratumor heterogeneity, metastasis and\nimmune surveillance. In the case of tumor, our result reveals that\ncommunication between cell colons and the structure of host tissue together\nregulate the intratumor heterogeneity. For metastasis, our model predicts that\nthe interplay between the structure of metastatic niche and interactions\nbetween metastatic cells arrived from different colons determines that which\nkind of seeds, polyclonal or monoclonal, can successfully metastasized there.\nFinally, studying the immune cells-tumor cells interaction in this context\nreveals the negative effect of the heterogeneous structure of host tissue on\nimmune surveillance. These findings deepen our understanding of cancer biology\nand may have applications in Immunotherapy.\n", "  Stars and their corresponding protoplanetary disks form in diverse\nenvironments. To account for these natural variations, we investigate the\nformation process around nine solar mass stars with a maximum resolution of 2\nAU in a Giant Molecular Cloud of (40 pc)$^3$ in volume by using the adaptive\nmesh refinement code \\ramses. The magnetohydrodynamic simulations reveal that\nthe accretion process is heterogeneous in time, in space, and among protostars\nof otherwise similar mass. During the first roughly 100 kyr of a protostar\nevolving to about a solar mass, the accretion rates peak around $10^{-5}$ to\n$10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ shortly after its birth, declining with time\nafter that. The different environments also affect the spatial accretion, and\ninfall of material to the star-disk system is mostly through filaments and\nsheets. Furthermore, the formation and evolution of disks varies significantly\nfrom star to star. We interpret the variety in disk formation as a consequence\nof the differences in the combined effects of magnetic fields and turbulence\nthat may cause differences in the efficiency of magnetic braking, as well as\ndifferences in the strength and distribution of specific angular momentum.\n", "  We extend our previous study of radiative ablation of circumstellar disks by\nline-scattering of the star's radiation, accounting now for the effect of\nmultiple line resonances off the stellar limb. For an analytic,\nthree-dimensional model of the velocity structure of an equatorial Keplerian\ndisk bounded at higher latitudes by a radially accelerating stellar wind\noutflow, we use root-finding methods to identify multiple resonances from a\nnear-disk circumstellar location along starward rays both on and off the\nstellar core. Compared to our previous study that accounted only for the effect\nof on-core resonances in reducing the radiative driving through the scattering\nof radiation away from a near-disk circumstellar location, including off-limb\nresonances leads to additional radiative driving from scattering toward this\nlocation. Instead of the up-to-50% reduction in line-acceleration previously\ninferred from multiple resonance effects, we now find a more modest 15-20% net\nreduction.\n", "  I describe the theoretical progress in the study of semileptonic tree-level B\ndecays, and its interplay with recent experimental results. In particular, I\nfocus on two anomalies: the ratios $R(D^{(*)})=\\displaystyle\\frac{{\\cal B}(B\n\\to D^{(*)} \\tau \\bar \\nu_\\tau)}{{\\cal B}(B \\to D^{(*)} \\ell \\bar \\nu_\\ell)}$\nand the inclusive versus exclusive determination of $|V_{cb}|$. I review a few\nexplanations proposed for such anomalies, and discuss tests to shed light on\ntheir origin.\n", "  We report a systematic investigation on the magnetization relaxation\nproperties of iron-based half-metallic Heusler alloy\nFe$_{2}$Cr$_{1-x}$Co_${x}$Si (FCCS) thin films using broadband angular-resolved\nferromagnetic resonance. Band structure engineering through Co doping (x)\ndemonstrated by first-principles calculations is shown to tune the intrinsic\nmagnetic damping over an order of magnitude, namely 0.01-0.0008. Notably, the\nintrinsic damping constants for samples with high Co concentration are among\nthe lowest reported for Heusler alloys and even comparable to magnetic\ninsulator yttrium iron garnet. Furthermore, a significant reduction of both\nisotropic and anisotropic contributions of extrinsic damping of the FCCS alloys\nwas found in the FCCS films with x=0.5-0.75, which is of particular importance\nfor applications. These results demonstrate a practical recipe to tailor\nfunctional magnetization for Heusler alloy-based spintronics at room\ntemperature\n", "  The integrable system is constrained strictly by the conservation law during\nthe time evolution, and the nearly integrable system or nonintegrable system is\nalso constrained by the conserved parameters (like the constants of motion)\nwith corresponding generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) which is indubitability a\npowerful tool in the prediction of thr relaxation dynamics. For stochastic\nevolution dynamic with considerable noise, the obviously quantum or thermal\ncorrelations which don't exhibit the thermal behavior, (like the density of\nkinks or transverse magnetization correlators), display a asymptotic\nnonthermalization, and in fact it's a asymptotic quasisteady state with a\ninfinte temperature, therefore the required distance to the nonthermal steady\nstate is in a infinite time average. In this paper, we unambiguously\ninvestigate the relaxation of a nonequilibrium system in a canonical ensemble\nfor integrable system or nonintegrable system, and the temporal behavior of\nmany-body quantum system and the macroscopic system, as well as the\ncorresponding linear-coupling between harmonic oscillators. Matrix-method in\nentropy ensemble is also utilized to discuss the boundary and the important\ndiagonalization, the approximation by the perturbation theory is also obtained.\n", "  Measurements of Underlying Event activity using proton-proton collision data\ncollected by the CMS detector will be presented. To check the energy dependence\nof the underlying event activity, results are compared with previous\nmeasurements from different experiments at different centre-of-mass energies.\n", "  We point out that most of the classical thermodynamics results in the paper\nhave been known in the literature, see Kestin and Woods, for quite some time\nand are not new, contrary to what the authors imply. As shown by Kestin, these\nresults are valid for quasistatic irreversible processes only and not for\narbitrary irreversible processes as suggested in the paper. Thus, the\napplication to the Jarzynski process is limited.\n", "  It is well known that today two main and well studied methods for alignment\nof liquid crystals has been used, namely: rubbing and photoalignment\ntechnologies, that lead to the change of anisotropic properties of aligning\nlayers and long-range interaction of the liquid crystal molecules in a\nmesophase. In this manuscript, we propose the usage of the nonlinear laser\nlithography technique, which was recently presented as a fast, relatively\nlow-cost method for a large area micro- and nanogrooves fabrication based on\nlaser-induced periodic surface structuring, as a new perspective method of the\nalignment of nematic liquid crystals. 920 nm periodic grooves were formed on a\nTi layer processed by means of the nonlinear laser lithography and studied as\nan aligning layer. Aligning properties of the periodic structures of Ti layers\nwere examined by using a combined twist LC cell. In addition, the layer of the\nmicrostructured Ti was coated with an oxidianiline-polyimide film with\nannealing of the polymer film followed without any further processing. The\ndependence of the twist angle of LC cells on a scanning speed and power of\nlaser beam during processing of the Ti layer was studied. The azimuthal\nanchoring energy of Ti layers with a periodic microstructure was calculated.\nThe maximum azimuthal anchoring energy for the microstructured Ti layer was\nabout 4.6*10-6 J/m2, which is comparable to the photoalignment technology. It\nwas found that after the deposition of a polyimide film on the periodic\nmicrostructured Ti layer, the gain effect of the azimuthal anchoring energy to\n~ 1*10-4 J/m2 is observed. Also, AFM study of aligning surfaces was carried\nout.\n", "  In this contribution, we explore the imaging limits of terahertz single-pixel\ncameras and present a way to improve the achievable signal-to-noise ratio and\nspatial resolution using a technique called dithering masks. The proposed\nprocedure is implemented on the hardware level using recent advances in the\ndevelopment of spatial light modulators for terahertz single-pixel cameras.\nThereby, our approach offers new ways to overcome theoretical imaging limits of\nnear wavelength resolution. We suggest that in using dithering masks the\nrequired phase retrieval driven recovery can be simplified to a robust\nnon-negative linear model even for near wavelength terahertz single-pixel\nimaging.\n", "  Gravitational lensings provide unique opportunities to study distant\ngalaxies. Despite their usefulness, only a dozens of gravitational arcs have\nbeen reported up-to-date, hampered by the low resolution imaging from\nground-based surveys. We propose a novel method to identify Einstein rings/arcs\nin the IFU surveys via image subtraction and computer vision techniques. We use\nthe recent discovered strong lens system in the MaNGA survey as a\nproof-of-concept; in addition to MaNGA, our approach is applicable to other IFU\nsurveys, such as SAMI, CALIFA, Hector, DESI, and 4MOST.\n", "  We present the deepest study to date of the Lya luminosity function (LF) in a\nblank field using blind integral field spectroscopy from MUSE. We constructed a\nsample of 604 Lya emitters (LAEs) across the redshift range 2.91 < z < 6.64\nusing automatic detection software in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We calculate\naccurate total Lya fluxes capturing low surface brightness extended Lya\nemission now known to be a generic property of high-redshift star-forming\ngalaxies. We simulated realistic extended LAEs to characterise the selection\nfunction of our samples, and performed flux-recovery experiments to test and\ncorrect for bias in our determination of total Lya fluxes. We find an accurate\ncompleteness correction accounting for extended emission reveals a very steep\nfaint-end slope of the LF, alpha, down to luminosities of log10 L erg s^-1<\n41.5, applying both the 1/Vmax and maximum likelihood estimators. Splitting the\nsample into three broad redshift bins, we see the faint-end slope increasing\nfrom -2.03+1.42-inf at z ~ 3.44 to -2.86+0.76-inf at z ~ 5.48, however no\nstrong evolution is seen between the 68% confidence regions in L*-alpha\nparameter space. Using the Lya line flux as a proxy for star formation\nactivity, and integrating the observed LFs, we find that LAEs' contribution to\nthe cosmic SFRD rises with redshift until it is comparable to that from\ncontinuum-selected samples by z ~ 6. This implies that LAEs may contribute more\nto the star-formation activity of the early Universe than previously thought -\nany additional interglactic medium correction would act to further boost the\nLya luminosities. Finally, assuming fiducial values for the escape of Lya and\nLyC radiation, and the clumpiness of the IGM, we integrated the maximum\nlikelihood LF at 5.00 < z < 6.64 and find we require only a small extrapolation\nbeyond the data (< 1 dex in L) for LAEs alone to maintain an ionised IGM at z ~\n6.\n", "  There are two main physical properties needed to fabricate 1D photonic\nstructures and form perfect photonic bandgaps: the quality of the thickness\nperiodicity and the refractive index of their components. Porous silicon (PS)\nis a nano-structured material widely used to prepare 1D photonic crystals due\nto the ease of tuning its porosity and its refractive index by changing the\nfabrication conditions. Since the morphology of PS changes with porosity, the\ndetermination of PS's refractive index is no easy task. To find the optical\nproperties of PS we can use different effective medium approximations (EMA). In\nthis work we propose a method to evaluate the performance of the refractive\nindex of PS layers to build photonic Bragg reflectors. Through a quality factor\nwe measure the agreement between theory and experiment and therein propose a\nsimple procedure to determine the usability of the refractive indices. We test\nthe obtained refractive indices in more complicated structures, such as a\nbroadband Vis-NIR mirror, and by means of a Merit function we find a good\nagreement between theory and experiment. With this study we have proposed\nquantitative parameters to evaluate the refractive index for PS Bragg\nreflectors. This procedure could have an impact on the design and fabrication\nof 1D photonic structures for different applications.\n", "  The development of new exchange-correlation functionals within density\nfunctional theory means that increasingly accurate information is accessible at\nmoderate computational cost. Recently, a newly developed self-consistent hybrid\nfunctional has been proposed [Skone \\textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{89},\n195112 (2014)], which allows for a reliable and accurate calculation of\nmaterial properties using a fully \\textit{ab initio} procedure. Here, we apply\nthis new functional to wurtzite ZnO, rutile SnO$_2$, and rocksalt MgO. We\npresent calculated structural, electronic, and optical properties, which we\ncompare to results obtained with the PBE and PBE0 functionals. For all\nsemiconductors considered here the self-consistent hybrid approach gives\nimproved agreement with experimental structural data relative to the PBE0\nhybrid functional for a moderate increase in computational cost, while avoiding\nthe empiricism common to conventional hybrid functionals. The electronic\nproperties are improved for ZnO and MgO, whereas for SnO$_2$ the PBE0 hybrid\nfunctional gives best agreement with experimental data.\n", "  A theoretical study of ionization of the hydrogen atom due to an XUV pulse in\nthe presence of an IR laser is presented. Well-established theories are usually\nused to describe the problem of laser assisted photoelectron effect. However,\nthe well-known soft-photon approximation firstly posed by Maquet et al in\nJournal of Modern Optics 54, 1847 (2007) and Kazansky's theory in Phys. Rev. A\n82, 033420 (2010) completely fails to predict the electron emission\nprependicularly to the polarization direction. Making use of a simple\nsemiclassical model, we study the angle-resolved energy distribution of\nphotoelectrons for the case that both fields are linearly polarized in the same\ndirection. We thoroughly analize and characterize two different emission\nregions in the angle-energy domain: (i) the parallel-like region with\ncontribution of two classical trajectories per optical cycle and (ii) the\nperpendicular-like region with contribution of four classical trajectories per\noptical cycle. We show that our semiclassical model is able to asses the\ninterference patterns of the angle-resolved photoelectron spectrum in the two\ndifferent mentioned regions. Electron trajectories stemming from different\noptical laser cycles give rise to angle-independent intercycle interference\nknown as sidebands. These sidebands are modulated by an angle-dependent\ncoarse-grained structure coming from the intracycle interference of the\nelectron trajectories born during the same optical cycle. We show the accuracy\nof our semiclassical model as a function of the time delay between the IR and\nthe XUV pulses and also as a function of the laser intensity by comparing the\nsemiclassical predictions of the angle-resolved photoelectron spectrum with the\ncontinuum-distorted wave strong field approximation and the ab initio solution\nof the time dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\n", "  Permanent magnet materials require a high uniaxial magneto-crystalline\nanisotropy. Exchange coupling between small crystallites with easy-plane\nanisotropy induces an effective uniaxial anisotropy if arranged accordingly.\nNanostructuring of materials with easy-plane anisotropy is an alternative way\nto create hard-magnetic materials. The coercivity increases with decreasing\nfeature size. The resulting coercive field is about 12 percent of the\nanisotropy field for a crystal size of 3.4 times the Bloch parameter.\n", "  We present the results of high resolution spectra of seven stars in the field\nof NGC 2482, an open star cluster of age 447 Myr. We confirm the previously\npublished values of the radial velocity and metallicity of one giant star. This\ngives us confidence that another giant star is a bona fide cluster member, and\nthat three stars significantly above the main sequence in a color-magnitude\ndiagram are not members, on the basis of discordant radial velocities. Another\nstar ~1.7 mag above the main sequence may or may not be a member. Its [Fe/H]\nvalue is ~0.1 dex more positive than two giant stars studied, and its radial\nvelocity is 3-4 km/s less than that of the two giant stars, which is a\nsignificant difference if the velocity dispersion of the cluster is less than\n+/-1 km/s. To a large extent the width of the main sequence seems to be due to\nthe presence of foreground and background stars in the same general direction,\nstars that masquerade as main sequence stars in the cluster.\n", "  We demonstrate how masses of new states, beyond direct experimental reach,\ncould nevertheless be extracted in the framework of effective field theory\n(EFT), given broad assumptions on the underlying UV physics, however not\nsticking to a particular setup nor fixing the coupling strength of the\nscenario. The flat direction in the $g_\\ast$ vs. $M$ plane is lifted by\nstudying correlations between observables that depend on operators with a\ndifferent $\\hbar$ scaling. We discuss the remaining model dependence (which is\ninherent even in the EFT approach to have control over the error due to the\ntruncation of the power series), as well as prospects to test paradigms of UV\nphysics. In particular, we provide an assessment of which correlations are best\nsuited regarding sensitivity, give an overview of possible/expected effects in\ndifferent observables, and demonstrate how perturbativity and direct search\nlimits corner possible patterns of deviations from the SM in a given UV\nparadigm.\n", "  We outline the design of beam experiments for the electron linac at the\nFermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility and for the\nIntegrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA), based on synchrotron light emitted\nby the electrons in bend dipoles, detected with gated microchannel-plate\nphotomultipliers (MCP-PMTs). The system can be used both for beam diagnostics\n(e.g., beam intensity with full dynamic range, turn-by-turn beam vibrations,\netc.) and for scientific experiments, such as the direct observation of the\ntime structure of the radiation emitted by single electrons in a storage ring.\nThe similarity between photon pulses and spectrum at the downstream end of the\nelectron linac and in the IOTA ring allows one to test the apparatus during\ncommissioning of the linac.\n", "  The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR is an experiment constructed to search for\nneutrinoless double-beta decays in germanium-76 and to demonstrate the\nfeasibility to deploy a ton-scale experiment in a phased and modular fashion.\nIt consists of two modular arrays of natural and $^{76}\\textrm{Ge}$-enriched\ngermanium detectors totaling 44.1 kg (29.7 kg enriched detectors), located at\nthe 4850' level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South\nDakota, USA. Data taken with this setup since summer 2015 at different\nconstruction stages of the experiment show a clear reduction of the observed\nbackground index around the ROI for $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay search due to\nimprovements in shielding. We discuss the statistical approaches to search for\na $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$-signal and derive the physics sensitivity for an expected\nexposure of $10\\,\\textrm{kg}{\\cdot}\\textrm{y}$ from enriched detectors using a\nprofile likelihood based hypothesis test in combination with toy Monte Carlo\ndata.\n", "  Assessing student learning is a cornerstone of educational practice.\nStandardized assessments have played a significant role in the development of\ninstruction, curricula, and educational spaces in college physics. However, the\nuse of these assessments to evaluate student learning is only productive if\nthey continue to align with our learning goals. Recently, there have been calls\nto elevate the process of science (\"scientific practices\") to the same level of\nimportance and emphasis as the concepts of physics (\"core ideas\" and\n\"crosscutting concepts\"). We use the recently developed 3D-LAP to investigate\nhow well the most commonly used standardized assessments in introductory\nphysics (i.e. concept inventories) align with this modern understanding of\nphysics education's learning goals. We find that many of the questions on\nconcept inventories do elicit evidence of student understanding of core ideas,\nbut do not have the potential to elicit evidence of scientific practices or\ncrosscutting concepts. Furthermore, we find that the individual scientific\npractices and crosscutting concepts that are assessed using these tools are\nlimited to a select few. We discuss the implications that these findings have\non designing and testing curricula and instruction both in the past and for the\nfuture.\n", "  In this work, we report the first demonstration of a solution processable,\noptically switchable 1D photonic crystal by implementing phototunable doped\nmetal oxide nanocrystals. The resulting device structure shows bi-photonic\nresponse with the photonic bandgap covering the visible spectral range and the\nplasmon resonance of the doped metal oxide the near infrared. By means of a\nfacile photodoping process, we tuned the plasmonic response and switched\neffectively the optical properties of the photonic crystal, translating the\neffect from the near infrared to the visible. The ultrafast bandgap pumping\ninduces a signal change in the region of the photonic stopband, with recovery\ntimes of several picoseconds, providing a step toward the ultrafast optical\nswitching. Optical modeling uncovers the importance to understand largely the\nvariations of the dielectric function of the photodoped material, and\nvariations in the high frequency region of the Drude response are responsible\nfor the strong switching in the visible after photodoping. Our device\nconfiguration offers unprecedented tunablility due to flexibility in device\ndesign, cover wavelength ranges from the visible to the near infrared. Our\nfindings indicate a new protocol to modify the optical response of photonic\ndevices by optical triggers only.\n", "  Summarizes recent work on the wakefields and impedances of flat, metallic\nplates with small corrugations\n", "  Radicalization is the process by which people come to adopt increasingly\nextreme political or religious ideologies. While radical thinking is by no\nmeans problematic in itself, it becomes a threat to national security when it\nleads to violence. We introduce a simple compartmental model (similar to\nepidemiology models) to describe the radicalization process. We then extend the\nmodel to allow for multiple ideologies. Our approach is similar to the one used\nin the study of multi-strain diseases. Based on our models, we assess several\nstrategies to counter violent extremism.\n", "  Accurate and precise astronomical distance determinations are crucial for\nderivations of, among others, the masses and luminosities of a large variety of\ndistant objects. Astronomical distance determination has traditionally relied\non the concept of a `distance ladder.' Here we review our recent attempts to\nestablish a highly robust set of internally consistent distance determinations\nto Local Group galaxies, which we recommend as the statistical basis of an\nimproved extragalactic distance ladder.\n", "  SDSS-V will be an all-sky, multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of over six\nmillion objects. It is designed to decode the history of the Milky Way, trace\nthe emergence of the chemical elements, reveal the inner workings of stars, and\ninvestigate the origin of planets. It will also create an integral-field\nspectroscopic map of the gas in the Galaxy and the Local Group that is 1,000x\nlarger than the current state of the art and at high enough spatial resolution\nto reveal the self-regulation mechanisms of galactic ecosystems. SDSS-V will\npioneer systematic, spectroscopic monitoring across the whole sky, revealing\nchanges on timescales from 20 minutes to 20 years. The survey will thus track\nthe flickers, flares, and radical transformations of the most luminous\npersistent objects in the universe: massive black holes growing at the centers\nof galaxies.\n  The scope and flexibility of SDSS-V will be unique among extant and future\nspectroscopic surveys: it is all-sky, with matched survey infrastructures in\nboth hemispheres; it provides near-IR and optical multi-object fiber\nspectroscopy that is rapidly reconfigurable to serve high target densities,\ntargets of opportunity, and time-domain monitoring; and it provides optical,\nultra-wide-field integral field spectroscopy. SDSS-V, with its programs\nanticipated to start in 2020, will be well-timed to multiply the scientific\noutput from major space missions (e.g., TESS, Gaia, eROSITA) and ground-based\nprojects. SDSS-V builds on the 25-year heritage of SDSS's advances in data\nanalysis, collaboration infrastructure, and product deliverables. The project\nis now refining its science scope, optimizing the survey strategies, and\ndeveloping new hardware that builds on the SDSS-IV infrastructure. We present\nhere an overview of the current state of these developments as we seek to build\nour worldwide consortium of institutional and individual members.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the electronic structures of 192\nconfigurations of 39 stable, layered, transition-metal dichalcogenides using\ndensity-functional theory. We show detailed investigations of their monolayer,\nbilayer, and trilayer structures' valence-band maxima, conduction-band minima,\nand band gap responses to transverse electric fields. We also report the\ncritical fields where semiconductor-to-metal phase transitions occur. Our\nresults show that band gap engineering by applying electric fields can be an\neffective strategy to modulate the electronic properties of transition-metal\ndichalcogenides for next-generation device applications.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the US Patient Referral Network (also called the\nShared Patient Network) and various subnetworks for the years 2009--2015. In\nthese networks two physicians are linked if a patient encounters both of them\nwithin a specified time-interval, according to the data made available by the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We find power law distributions on\nmost state-level data as well as a core-periphery structure. On a national and\nstate level, we discover a so-called small-world structure as well as a\n\"gravity law\" of the type found in some large-scale economic networks. Some\nphysicians play the role of hubs for interstate referral. Strong correlations\nbetween certain network statistics with healthcare system statistics at both\nthe state and national levels are discovered. The patterns in the referral\nnetwork evinced using several statistical analyses involving key metrics\nderived from the network illustrate the potential for using network analysis to\nprovide new insights into the healthcare system and opportunities or mechanisms\nfor catalyzing improvements.\n", "  Ferroelectric photovoltaics (FPVs) have drawn much attention owing to their\nhigh stability, environmental safety, anomalously high photovoltages, coupled\nwith reversibly switchable photovoltaic responses. However, FPVs suffer from\nextremely low photocurrents, which is primarily due to their wide band gaps.\nHere, we present a new class of FPVs by demonstrating switchable ferroelectric\nphotovoltaic effects using hexagonal ferrite (h-RFeO3) thin films having narrow\nband gaps of ~1.2 eV, where R denotes rare-earth ions. FPVs with narrow band\ngaps suggests their potential applicability as photovoltaic and optoelectronic\ndevices. The h-RFeO3 films further exhibit reasonably large ferroelectric\npolarizations, which possibly reduces a rapid recombination rate of the\nphoto-generated electron-hole pairs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of\nh-RFeO3 thin-film devices is sensitive on the magnitude of polarization. In the\ncase of h-TmFeO3 (h-TFO) thin film, the measured PCE is twice as large as that\nof the BiFeO3 thin film, a prototypic FPV. We have further shown that the\nswitchable photovoltaic effect dominates over the unswitchable internal field\neffect arising from the net built-in potential. This work thus demonstrates a\nnew class of FPVs towards high-efficiency solar cell and optoelectronic\napplications.\n", "  Multi-component lattice Boltzmann models operating in a wide range of fluid\nviscosity values are developed and examined. The algorithm is constructed with\nthe goal to enable engineering applications without sacrificing simplicity and\ncomputational efficiency present in the original Shan-Chen model and D3Q19\nlattice scheme. Boundary conditions for modeling friction and wettability\neffects are developed for discrete representation of surfaces within a\nvolumetric approach, which results in accurate flow simulation in complex\ngeometry. Numerical validation of our models includes comparison to previous\nstudies and analytical solutions. The results are shown to be robust and\naccurate up to an extremely small kinematic viscosity value of $0.0017$ lattice\nunits and the extremely high ratio of components' kinematic viscosities of\nhundreds and up to a thousand. This improvement is significant compared to\nprevious studies with Shan-Chen model \\cite{2013_Yang,2004_Kang,2010_Dong}, in\nwhich reasonable accuracy was kept only at the viscosity ratio up to 10 in the\nPoiseuille flow and the fingering simulation.\n", "  We report on the combined results of structural, magnetic, transport and\ncalorimetric properties of Mn$_5$Si$_3$-type hexagonal Gd$_5$Sb$_3$. With\ndecreasing temperature, it exhibits a ferromagnetic-like transition at 265 K,\nN\\'{e}el transition at 95.5 K and a spin-orientation transition at 62 K. The\nsystem is found to be in AFM state down to 2 K in a field of 70 kOe. Magnetic\nphase coexistence is not noticeable despite large positive Curie-Weiss\ntemperature. Instead low-temperature AFM and high-temperature FM-like phases\nare separated in large temperature. Temperature-magnetic field ($H$-$T$) phase\ndiagram reveals field-driven complex magnetic phases. Within the AFM phase, the\nsystem is observed to undergo field-driven spin-orientation transitions.\nField-induced tricritical and quantum critical points appear to be absent due\nto strong AFM nature and by the intervention of FM-like state between PM and\nAFM states. Electrical resistivity along with large Sommerfeld parameter\nsuggests metallic nature.\n", "  Protein adsorption/desorption upon nanoparticle surfaces is an important\nprocess to understand for developing new nanotechnology involving biomaterials,\nwhile atomistic picture of the process and its coupling with protein\nconformational change is lacking. Here we report our study on the adsorption of\nprotein GB1 upon a polystyrene nanoparticle surface using atomistic molecular\ndynamic simulations. Enabled by metadynamics, we explored the relevant phase\nspace and identified three protein states; each protein state involved both the\nadsorbed and desorbed states. We also studied the change of secondary and\ntertiary structures of GB1 during adsorption, and the dominant interactions\nbetween protein and surface in different adsorbing stages. From the simulation\nresults we obtained a scenario that is more rational and complete than the\nconventional one. We believe the new scenario is more appropriate as a\ntheoretical model in understanding and explaining experimental signals.\nIntroduction\n", "  Quantum routing of single photons in a system with two waveguides coupled to\ntwo whispering-gallery resonators (WGRs) are investigated theoretically. With a\nreal-space full quantum theory, photonic scattering amplitudes along four ports\nof the waveguide network are analytically obtained. It is shown that, by\nadjusting the geometric and physical parameters of the two-WGR configuration,\nthe quantum routing properties of single photons along the present waveguide\nnetwork can be controlled effectively. For example, the routing capability from\ninput waveguide to another one can significantly exceed 0.5 near the resonance\npoint of scattering spectra, which can be achieved with only one resonator. By\nproperly designing the distance between two WGRs and the waveguide-WGR coupling\nstrengths, the transfer rate between the waveguides can also reach certain\nsufficiently high values even in the non-resonance regime. Moreover, Fano-like\nresonances in the scattering spectra are designable. The proposed system may\nprovide a potential application in controlling single-photon quantum routing as\na novel router.\n", "  In the MnSi bulk chiral magnet, magnetic skyrmion strings of 17 nm in\ndiameter appear in the form of a lattice, penetrating the sample thickness,\n10-1,000 um. Although such a bundle of skyrmion strings may exhibit complex\nsoft-matter-like dynamics when starting to move under the influence of a random\npinning potential, the details remain highly elusive. Here, we show that a\nmetastable skyrmion-string lattice is subject to topological unwinding under\nthe application of pulsed currents of 3-5x106 A m-2 rather than being\ntransported, as evidenced by measurements of the topological Hall effect. The\ncritical current density above which the topological unwinding occurs is larger\nfor a shorter pulse width, reminiscent of the viscoelastic characteristics\naccompanying the pinning-creep transition observed in domain-wall motion.\nNumerical simulations reveal that current-induced depinning of already\nsegmented skyrmion strings initiates the topological unwinding. Thus, the\nskyrmion-string length is an element to consider when studying current-induced\nmotion.\n", "  Usually, the liner waveguides with single quantum emitters are utilized as\nrouters to construct the quantum network in quantum information processings.\nHere, we investigate the influence of the nonlinear dispersion on quantum\nrouting of single surface plasmons, between two metal nanowires with a pair of\nquantum dots. By using a full quantum theory in real space, we obtain the\nrouting probabilities of a single surface plasmon into the four outports of two\nplasmonic waveguides scattered by a pair of quantum dots. It is shown that, by\nproperly designing the inter-dot distance and the dot-plasmon couplings, the\nrouting capability of the surface plasmons between the plasmonic waveguide\nchannels can be significantly higher than the relevant network formed by the\nsingle-emitter waveguides with the linear dispersions. Interestingly, the\npresent quadratic dispersions in the waveguides deliver the manifest Fano-like\nresonances of the surface-plasmon transport. Therefore, the proposed double-dot\nconfiguration could be utilized as a robust quantum router for controlling the\nsurface-plasmon routing in the plasmonic waveguides and a plasmonic Fano-like\nresonance controller.\n", "  The time evolution of the distribution and shareability of quantum coherence\nof a tripartite system in a non-Markovian environment is examined. The total\ncoherence can be decomposed into various contributions, ranging from local,\nglobal bipartite and global tripartite, which characterize the type of state.\nWe identify coherence revivals for non-Markovian systems for all the\ncontributions of coherence. The local coherence is found to be much more robust\nunder the environmental coupling due to an effective smaller coupling to the\nreservoir. This allows us to devise a characterization of a quantum state in\nterms of a coherence tuple on a multipartite state simply by examining various\ncombinations of reservoir couplings. The effect of the environment on the\nshareability of quantum coherence, as defined using the monogamy of coherence,\nis investigated and found that the sign of the monogamy is a preserved quantity\nunder the decoherence. We conjecture that the monogamy of coherence is a\nconserved property under local incoherent processes.\n", "  This dissertation consists of three parts. The first part of the thesis is\ndevoted to the study of gravity and higher spin gauge theories in 2+1\ndimensions. The first part deals with cosmological solutions of spin-3 gravity\nand their thermodynamics, flat space limit of AdS$_3$ gravity and higher spins\nusing Grassmann approach and chiral higher spin solutions with the most general\nAdS$_3$ boundary condition. The second part is devoted to the problem of\nNeumann boundary condition in Einstein's gravity. We present an explicit\nboundary term that makes the Neumann variational problem well posed and explore\nits consequences for holography in various dimensions. In the third part of the\ndissertation, we use the CFT techniques of Rychkov and Tan to compute anomalous\ndimensions in the O(N) Gross-Neveu model in $d=2+\\epsilon$ dimensions. To do\nthis, we extend the \"cow-pie contraction\" algorithm of Basu and Krishnan to\ntheories with fermions.\n", "  Recently, the problem of the infinite spherical well was solved by the\ngroup-theoretical method to resolve all the peculiarities in the currently\naccepted solution [DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.18172.44162 (Researchgate, 2017)]. With\na view to further justifying the group-theoretical method, the problem is first\nstudied from the viewpoint of classical mechanics. Then the radial probability\ndensities predicted by classical mechanics are compared with those predicted\nfrom solutions of the problem obtained by the group-theoretical method. The\ncomparisons clearly indicate the convergence of predictions of quantum\nmechanics and classical mechanics in the limit of large eigen-energies.\nTherefore, the group-theoretical method is justified as the right way to solve\nthe problem of the infinite spherical well.\n", "  We identify that for a broad range of parameters a variant of the soliton\nsolution of the one-dimensional non-linear Schr\\\"{odinger} equation, the {\\it\nbreather}, is distinct when one studies the associated space curve (or soliton\nsurface), which in this case is knotted. The signi ficance of these solutions\nwith such a hidden non-trivial topological element is pre-eminent on two\ncounts: it is a one-dimensional model, and the no nlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation is well known as a model for a variety of physical systems.\n", "  The magneto-transport properties in Sulfur doped Bi2Se3 are investigated. The\nmagnetoresistance (MR) decreases with increase of S content and finally for 7%\n(i.e. y=0.21) S doping the magnetoresistance becomes negative. This negative MR\nis unusual as it is observed when magnetic field is applied with the\nperpendicular direction to the plane of the sample. The magneto-transport\nbehavior shows the shubnikov-de hass (SdH) oscillation indicating the\ncoexistence of both surface and bulk states. The negative MR has been\nattributed to the bulk conduction.\n", "  Following [7,8], we analyze regularity properties of single-site probability\ndistributions of the random potential and of the Integrated Density of States\n(IDS) in the Anderson models with infinite-range interactions and arbitrary\nnontrivial probability distributions of the site potentials. In the present\nwork, we study $2$-particle Anderson Hamiltonians on a lattice and prove\nspectral and strong dynamical localization at low energies, with exponentially\ndecaying eigenfunctions, for a class of site potentials featuring a power-law\ndecay.\n", "  In this work, we revisit a criterion, originally proposed in [Nonlinearity\n{\\bf 17}, 207 (2004)], for the stability of solitary traveling waves in\nHamiltonian, infinite-dimensional lattice dynamical systems. We discuss the\nimplications of this criterion from the point of view of stability theory, both\nat the level of the spectral analysis of the advance-delay differential\nequations in the co-traveling frame, as well as at that of the Floquet problem\narising when considering the traveling wave as a periodic orbit modulo a shift.\nWe establish the correspondence of these perspectives for the pertinent\neigenvalue and Floquet multiplier and provide explicit expressions for their\ndependence on the velocity of the traveling wave in the vicinity of the\ncritical point. Numerical results are used to corroborate the relevant\npredictions in two different models, where the stability may change twice. Some\nextensions, generalizations and future directions of this investigation are\nalso discussed.\n", "  We have completed a survey of twenty-two ultraviolet-selected hot subdwarfs\nusing the Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS) and the 2.2-m\ntelescope at La Silla. The sample includes apparently single objects as well as\nhot subdwarfs paired with a bright, unresolved companion. The sample was\nextracted from our GALEX catalogue of hot subdwarf stars. We identified three\nnew short-period systems (P=3.5 hours to 5 days) and determined the orbital\nparameters of a long-period (P=62.66 d) sdO plus G III system. This particular\nsystem should evolve into a close double degenerate system following a second\ncommon envelope phase. We also conducted a chemical abundance study of the\nsubdwarfs: Some objects show nitrogen and argon abundance excess with respect\nto oxygen. We present key results of this programme.\n", "  The sheer interstellar abundance of helium makes any bound molecules or\ncomplexes containing it of potential interest for astrophysical observation.\nThis work utilizes high-level and trusted quantum chemical techniques to\npredict the rotational, vibrational, and rovibrational traits of HeHHe+,\nHeHNe+, and HeHAr+. The first two are shown to be strongly bound, while HeHAr+\nis shown to be more of a van der Waals complex of argonium with a helium atom.\nIn any case, the formation of HeHHe+ through reactions of HeH+ with HeH3+ is\nexothermic. HeHHe+ exhibits the quintessentially bright proton-shuttle motion\npresent in all proton-bound complexes in the 7.4 micron range making it a\npossible target for telescopic observation at the mid-IR/far-IR crossover point\nand a possible tracer for the as-of-yet unobserved helium hydride cation.\nFurthermore, a similar mode in HeHNe+ can be observed to the blue of this close\nto 6.9 microns. The brightest mode of HeHAr+ is dimmed due the reduced\ninteraction of the helium atom with the central proton, but this fundamental\nfrequency can be found slightly to the red of the Ar-H stretch in the\nastrophysically detected argonium cation.\n", "  Ozak et al. [2016] claimed that explicitly including the effect of CO$_2$\ncollisional line mixing (LM) in their radiative transfer calculations yield\nCO$_2$ atmospheres that are more transparent to infrared radiation than when\nspectra calculations are made using sub-Lorentzian line shapes. This would in\nparticular imply significantly colder surface temperatures (up to 15K) for\nearly Mars than estimated in previous studies. Here we show that the relative\ncooling that Ozak et al. [2016] associated to the effect of collisional line\nmixing is in fact due to a wrong choice of broadening species (air instead of\nCO$_2$). We then calculated Line-by-Line spectra of pure CO$_2$ atmospheres\nusing a line-mixing model developed for self-broadened CO$_2$. Using the LMD\nGeneric model (in 1D radiative-convective mode), we find that calculations made\nwith the proper collisional line mixing model and with sub-Lorentzian line\nshapes lead to differences between early Mars surface temperatures smaller than\n2 Kelvins only.\n", "  The analysis of the seismic vulnerability of urban centres has received a\ngreat attention in the last century. In order to estimate the seismic\nvulnerability of a densely populated urban area, it would in principle be\nnecessary to develop in-depth analyses for predicting the dynamic behaviour of\nthe individual buildings and their structural aggregation. Such analyses,\nhowever, are extremely cost-intensive, require great processing time and above\nall expertise judgement. It is therefore very useful to define simplified rules\nfor estimating the seismic vulnerability of whole urban areas. In the last\ndecades, the Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) scenario has gained increasing\ncredibility as a mathematical framework for explaining a large number of\nnaturally occurring extreme events, from avalanches to earthquakes dynamics,\nfrom bubbles and crises in financial markets to the extinction of species in\nthe evolution or the behaviour of human brain activity. All these examples show\nthe intrinsic tendency common to many phenomena to spontaneously organize into\na dynamical critical state, whose signature is the presence of a power law\nbehaviour in the frequency distribution of events. In this context, the\nOlami-Feder- Christensen (OFC) model, introduced in 1992, has played a key role\nin modelling earthquakes phenomenology. The aim of the present paper is\nproposing an agent-based model of earthquake dynamics, based on the OFC self-\norganized criticality framework, in order to evaluate the effects of a critical\nsequence of seismic events on a given large urban area during a given interval\nof time. The further integration of a GIS database within a software\nenvironment for agent-based simulations, will allow to perform a preliminary\nparametric study of these effects on real datasets. The model could be useful\nfor defining planning strategies for seismic risk reduction\n", "  In this paper we investigate bubble nucleation in a disordered\nLandau-Ginzburg model. First we adopt the standard procedure to average over\nthe disordered free energy. This quantity is represented as a series of the\nreplica partition functions of the system. Using the saddle-point equations in\neach replica partition function, we discuss the presence of a spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking mechanism. The leading term of the series is given by a\nlarge-N Euclidean replica field theory. Next, we consider finite temperature\neffects. Below some critical temperature, there are N real instantons-like\nsolutions in the model. The transition from the false to the true vacuum for\neach replica field is given by the nucleation of a bubble of the true vacuum.\nIn order to describe these irreversible processes of multiple nucleation, going\nbeyond the diluted instanton approximation, an effective model is constructed,\nwith one single mode of a bosonic field interacting with a reservoir of N\nidentical two-level systems.\n", "  We investigate the stability of synchronization in networks of dynamical\nsystems with strongly delayed connections. We obtain strict conditions for\nsynchronization of periodic and equilibrium solutions. In particular, we show\nthe existence of a critical coupling strength $\\kappa_{c}$, depending only on\nthe network structure, isolated dynamics and coupling function, such that for\nlarge delay and coupling strength $\\kappa<\\kappa_{c}$, the network possesses\nstable synchronization. The critical coupling $\\kappa_{c}$ can be chosen\nindependently of the delay for the case of equilibria, while for the periodic\nsolution, $\\kappa_{c}$ depends essentially on the delay and vanishes as the\ndelay increases. We observe that, for random networks, the synchronization\ninterval is maximal when the network is close to the connectivity threshold. We\nalso derive scaling of the coupling parameter that allows for a synchronization\nof large networks for different network topologies.\n", "  Graphene oxide relative dielectric permittivity, both its real and imaginary\nparts, have been measured under various humidity conditions at GHz. It is\ndemonstrated that the relative dielectric permittivity increases with\nincreasing humidity due to water uptake. This electrical property of graphene\noxide was used to create a battery-free wireless radio-frequency identification\n(RFID) humidity sensor by coating printed graphene antenna with the graphene\noxide layer. The resonance frequency as well as the backscattering phase of\nsuch graphene oxide/graphene antenna become sensitive to the surrounding\nhumidity and can be detected by the RFID reader. This enables batteryless\nwireless monitoring of the local humidity with digital identification attached\nto any location or item and paves the way for low-cost efficient sensors for\nInternet of Things applications.\n", "  In the recent paper by Teys [JETP Letters 105 (8), 477-483 (2017)], an atomic\nmodel for the Si(331) reconstructed surface (hereby referred to as T-model) was\nproposed on the basis of high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nimages. While detailing the virtues against previous and abandoned models, the\nauthor avoids any reference to the rather distinct 8P-model advocated few weeks\nearlier by Zhachuk and Teys [R. Zhachuk, S. Teys, Phys. Rev. B 95, 041412\n(2017)], casting doubts to his own work. Formulated that way, findings from\nRef. [JETP Letters 105 (8), 477-483 (2017)] leave readers of JETP Letters with\na partial and confusing view of the problem, and above all, leaves the\nobservations open to ambiguous interpretation. The 8P-model is also based on\nSTM measurements, and unlike the T-model, passed through the scrutiny of\nfirst-principles calculations. The present comment reconciles Ref. [JETP\nLetters 105 (8), 477-483 (2017)] with the literature by supplementing the\ndiscussion with a missing and critical account on the stability and electronic\nstructure of the T- versus 8P-models of Si(331).\n", "  Several anomalous features in the orbital distribution of distant Kuiper Belt\nobjects have recently sparked suggestions of an unseen large planet (or two)\norbiting beyond Neptune. I review the theoretical arguments and the prospects\nfor the existence of unseen massive bodies in the distant solar system.\n", "  We present an application of Flory-type self-consistent field theory of the\nflexible polymer chain dissolved in the binary mixture of solvents to\ntheoretical description of co-nonsolvency. We show that our theoretical\npredictions are in good quantitative agreement with the recently published MD\nsimulation results for the conformational behavior of a Lennard-Jones flexible\nchain in a binary mixture of the Lennard-Jones fluids. We show that our theory\nis able to describe co-nonsolvency suppression through pressure enhancement to\nextremely high values recently discovered in experiment and reproduced by full\natomistic MD simulations. Analysing a co-solvent concentration in internal\npolymer volume at different pressure values, we speculate that this phenomenon\nis caused by the suppression of the co-solvent preferential solvation of the\npolymer backbone at rather high pressure imposed. We show that when the\nco-solvent-induced coil-globule transition takes place, the entropy and the\nenthalpy contributions to the solvation free energy abruptly decrease, while\nthe solvation free energy remains continuous.\n", "  In the context of the LAUE project devoted to build a Laue lens prototype for\nfocusing celestial hard X-/soft gamma-rays, a Laue lens made of bent crystal\ntiles, with 20 m focal length, is simulated. The focusing energy passband is\nassumed to be 90--600 keV. The distortion of the image produced by the lens on\nthe focal plane, due to effects of crystal tile misalignment and radial\ndistortion of the crystal curvature, is investigated. The corresponding\neffective area of the lens, its point spread function and sensitivity are\ncalculated and compared with those exhibited by a nominal Laue lens with no\nmisalignment and/or distortion. Such analysis is crucial to estimate the\noptical properties of a real lens, in which the investigated shortcomings could\nbe present.\n", "  We study the loss, recovery, and preservation of differentiability of\ntime-dependent large deviation rate functions. This study is motivated by\nmean-field Gibbs-non-Gibbs transitions. The gradient of the rate-function\nevolves according to a Hamiltonian flow. This Hamiltonian flow is used to\nanalyze the regularity of the time dependent rate function, both for Glauber\ndynamics for the Curie-Weiss model and Brownian dynamics in a potential. We\nhereby create a unifying framework for the treatment of mean-field\nGibbs-non-Gibbs transitions, based on Hamiltonian dynamics and viscosity\nsolutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.\n", "  The conventional formulation of the Method of Dimensionality Reduction (MDR)\nin contact mechanics is only applicable two \"point contacts\", that is to\ncontacts of two unbounded three-dimensional bodies over final contact area. We\nanalyze here if it is possible to find an at least approximate formulation of\nthe MDR for \"line contacts\", that is contacts which contact area is unbounded\nin one direction. In this case the problem can be formulated as contact of two\ntwo-dimensional half-\"spaces\".\n", "  Layered materials such as graphite and transition metal dichalcogenides have\nextremely anisotropic mechanical properties owing to orders of magnitude\ndifference between in-plane and out-of-plane interatomic interaction strengths.\nAlthough effects of mechanical perturbations on either intra- or inter-layer\ninteractions have been extensively investigated, mutual correlations between\nthem have rarely been addressed. Here we show that layered materials have an\ninevitable coupling between in-plane uniaxial strain and interlayer shear.\nBecause of this, the uniaxial in-plane strain induces an anomalous splitting of\nthe degenerate interlayer shear phonon modes such that the split shear mode\nalong the tensile strain is not softened but hardened contrary to the case of\nintralayer phonon modes. We confirm the effect by measuring Raman shifts of\nshear modes of bilayer MoS2 under strain. Moreover, by analyzing the splitting,\nwe obtain an unexplored off-diagonal elastic constant, demonstrating that Raman\nspectroscopy can determine almost all mechanical constants of layered\nmaterials.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the sensitivity of invariant states in linear\nquantum stochastic systems with respect to nonlinear perturbations. The system\nvariables are governed by a Markovian Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic\ndifferential equation (QSDE) driven by quantum Wiener processes of external\nbosonic fields in the vacuum state. The quadratic system Hamiltonian and the\nlinear system-field coupling operators, corresponding to a nominal open quantum\nharmonic oscillator, are subject to perturbations represented in a Weyl\nquantization form. Assuming that the nominal linear QSDE has a Hurwitz dynamics\nmatrix and using the Wigner-Moyal phase-space framework, we carry out an\ninfinitesimal perturbation analysis of the quasi-characteristic function for\nthe invariant quantum state of the nonlinear perturbed system. The resulting\ncorrection of the invariant states in the spatial frequency domain may find\napplications to their approximate computation, analysis of relaxation dynamics\nand non-Gaussian state generation in nonlinear quantum stochastic systems.\n", "  In this paper, we study Schwinger pair production of charged massless\nparticles in constant electric fields of finite-extent. Exploiting a map from\nthe Dirac and Klein-Gordon equation to the harmonic oscillator, we find exact\npair production rates for massless fermions and scalars. Pair production rates\ndepend only on the ratio between the capacitor plate separation, $\\ell$, and\nthe length-scale of the force-field, $\\ell_F$. Chirality ensures that fermion\nproduction smoothly vanishes with $\\ell/\\ell_F$. Scalar pair production though\ndiverges exponentially quickly in this limit. The same limit of the smooth\ntanh-potential does not diverge; divergences seem tied to singularities in\ncurrent and charge densities.\n", "  We show that radiative cooling profiles, when described in temperature\ncoordinates, are insensitive to surface temperature $T_s$. We argue this\ntheoretically as well as confirm it in cloud-resolving simulations of radiative\nconvective equilibrium (RCE). This $T_s$-invariance holds for shortwave and\nlongwave cooling separately, as well as their sum. Furthermore, the\n$T_s$-invariance of radiative cooling profiles leads to a simple expression for\nthe $T_s$-dependence of column-integrated cooling and hence precipitation, and\ngives insight into why mean precipitation increases at a rate of $2 -3\\%\\\n\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$ in RCE. The relevance of these results to global climate\nsimulations is assessed, and the $T_s$-invariance is found to hold in the mid\nand upper troposphere. In the lower troposphere, the pressure-invariance of\ncloud layers and circulation tends to dominate.\n", "  We consider a Wheeler delayed-choice experiment based on the Mach-Zehnder\nInterferometer. Since the development of the causal interpretation of\nrelativistic boson fields there have not been any applications for which the\nequations of motion for the field have been solved explicitly. Here, we provide\nperhaps the first application of the causal interpretation of boson fields for\nwhich the equations of motion are solved. Specifically, we consider the\nelectromagnetic field. Solving the equations of motion allows us to develop a\nrelativistic causal model of the Wheeler delayed-choice Mach-Zehnder\nInterferometer. We show explicitly that a photon splits at a beam splitter. We\nalso demonstrate the inherent nonlocal nature of a relativistic quantum field.\nThis is particularly revealed in a which-path measurement where a quantum is\nnonlocally absorbed from both arms of the interferometer. This feature explains\nhow when a photon is split by a beam splitter it nevertheless registers on a\ndetector in one arm of the interferometer. Bohm et al \\cite{BDH85} have argued\nthat a causal model of a Wheeler delayed-choice experiment avoids the paradox\nof creating or changing history, but they did not provide the details of such a\nmodel. The relativistic causal model we develop here serves as a detailed\nexample which demonstrates this point, though our model is in terms of a field\npicture rather than the particle picture of the Bohm-de Broglie nonrelativistic\ncausal interpretation.\n", "  Grangier, Roger and Aspect (GRA) performed a beam-splitter experiment to\ndemonstrate the particle behaviour of light and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer\nexperiment to demonstrate the wave behaviour of light. The distinguishing\nfeature of these experiments is the use of a gating system to produce near\nideal single photon states. With the demonstration of both wave and particle\nbehaviour (in two mutually exclusive experiments) they claim to have\ndemonstrated the dual particle-wave behaviour of light and hence to have\nconfirmed Bohr's principle of complementarity. The demonstration of the wave\nbehaviour of light is not in dispute. But we want to demonstrate, contrary to\nthe claims of GRA, that their beam-splitter experiment does not conclusively\nconfirm the particle behaviour of light, and hence does not confirm\nparticle-wave duality, nor, more generally, does it confirm complementarity.\nOur demonstration consists of providing a detailed model based on the Causal\nInterpretation of Quantum Fields (CIEM), which does not involve the particle\nconcept, of GRA's which-path experiment. We will also give a brief outline of a\nCIEM model for the second, interference, GRA experiment.\n"]}
