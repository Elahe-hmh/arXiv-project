simulation (DNS) of a channel flow with one curved surface\nwas performed at moderate Reynolds number (Re_tau = 395 at the inlet). The\nadverse pressure gradient was obtained by a wall curvature through a\nmathematical mapping from physical coordinates to Cartesian ones. The code,\nusing spectral spanwise and normal discretization, combines the advantage of a\ngood accuracy with a fast integration procedure compared to standard numerical\nprocedures for complex geometries. The turbulent flow slightly separates on the\nprofile at the lower curved wall and is at the onset of separation at the\nopposite flat wall. The thin separation bubble is characterized with a reversal\nflow fraction. Intense vortices are generated near the separation line on the\nlower wall but also at the upper wall. Turbulent normal stresses and kinetic\nenergy budget are investigated along the channel.\n", "  It is shown that a new type of the self-similar spherical ionization waves\nmay exist in gases. All spatial scales and the propagation velocity of such\nwaves increase exponentially in time. Conditions for existence of these waves\nare established, their structure is described and approximate analytical\nrelationships between the principal parameters are obtained. It is notable that\nspherical ionization waves can serve as the simplest, but structurally complete\nand physically transparent model of streamer in homogeneous electric field.\n", "  In this work, we present a deformed solutions starting from systems of three\ncoupled scalar fields with super-potential $W(\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3)$ by orbit\nmethod. First, we deform the corresponding super-potential and obtain defect\nsolutions. It is shown that how to construct new models altogether with its\ndefect solutions in terms of the non-deformed model. Therefore, we draw the\ngraph of super-potential and different fields in terms of $x.$ So we observe\nthat the graphs for deformed and non - deformed cases are changed by the scale.\n", "  Game theory has been one of the most successful quantitative concepts to\ndescribe social interactions, their strategical aspects, and outcomes. Among\nthe payoff matrix quantifying the result of a social interaction, the\ninteraction conditions have been varied, such as the number of repeated\ninteractions, the number of interaction partners, the possibility to punish\ndefective behavior etc. While an extension to spatial interactions has been\nconsidered early on such as in the \"game of life\", recent studies have focussed\non effects of the structure of social interaction networks.\n  However, the possibility of individuals to move and, thereby, evade areas\nwith a high level of defection, and to seek areas with a high level of\ncooperation, has not been fully explored so far. This contribution presents a\nmodel combining game theoretical interactions with success-driven motion in\nspace, and studies the consequences that this may have for the degree of\ncooperation and the spatio-temporal dynamics in the population. It is\ndemonstrated that the combination of game theoretical interactions with motion\ngives rise to many self-organized behavioral patterns on an aggregate level,\nwhich can explain a variety of empirically observed social behaviors.\n", "  Time-asymmetric spacetime structures, in particular those representing black\nholes and the expansion of the universe, are intimately related to other arrows\nof time, such as the second law and the retardation of radiation. The nature of\nthe quantum arrow, often attributed to a collapse of the wave function, is\nessential, in particular, for understanding the much discussed \"black hole\ninformation loss paradox\". However, this paradox assumes a new form and can\npossibly be avoided in a consistent causal treatment that may be able to avoid\nhorizons and singularities. - A \"master arrow\", which combines all arrows of\ntime, does not have to be identified with a direction of the formal time\nparameter that serves to formulate the dynamics as a succession of global\nstates (a trajectory in configuration or Hilbert space). It may even change\ndirection with respect to a fundamental physical clock such as the cosmic\nexpansion parameter if this was formally extended either into a future\ncontraction era or to negative \"pre-big-bang\" values.\n", "  Radar-holonomic congruences of wordlines are proposed as a weaker substitute\nfor the too restrictive class of Born-rigid motions. The definition is\nexpressed as a set of differential equations. Integrability conditions and\nCauchy data are studied. We finally obtain an example of a radar-holonomic\ncongruence containing a given worldline with a given value of the rotation on\nthis line.\n", "  The application of the Lorentz integral transform (LIT) method to photon\nscattering off nuclei is presented in general. As an example, elastic photon\nscattering off the deuteron in the unretarded dipole approximation is\nconsidered using the LIT method. The inversion of the integral transform is\ndiscussed in detail paying particular attention to the high-energy\ncontributions in the resonance term. The obtained E1-polarizabilities are\ncompared to results from the literature. The corresponding theoretical cross\nsection is confronted with experimental results confirming, as already known\nfrom previous studies, that the E1-contribution is the most important one at\nlower energies.\n", "  We consider a local action with both the real scalar field and its dual in\ntwo Euclidean dimensions. The role of singular line discontinuities is\nemphasized. Exotic properties of the correlation of the field with its dual,\nthe generation of spin from scalar fields, and quantization of dual charges are\npointed out. Wick's theorem and rotation properties of fermions are recovered\nfor half-integer quantization.\n", "  Dirac, Schwinger and Zwanziger theories of electric and magnetic charges are\nobtained via duality transformation. Analogous construction for three Euclidean\ndimensions, with magnetic charges interacting with electric currents, is also\ndone. The role of Dirac strings as dislocations in the configurations of gauge\npotential is emphasized.\n", "  The entropic gravity scenario recently proposed by Erik Verlinde reproduced\nthe Newton's law of purely classical gravity yet the key assumptions of this\napproach all have quantum mechanical origins. This is atypical for emergent\nphenomena in physics, where the underlying, more fundamental physics often\nreveals itself as corrections to the leading classical behavior. So one\nnaturally wonders: where is hbar hiding in entropic gravity? To address this\nquestion, we first revisit the idea of holographic screen as well as entropy\nand its variation law in order to obtain a self-consistent approach to the\nproblem. Next we argue that when dealing with quantum gravity issues the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle (GUP) should be the more appropriate\nfoundation. Indeed based on GUP it has been demonstrated that the black hole\nBekenstein entropy area law must be modified not only in the strong but also in\nthe weak gravity regime. In the weak gravity limit, such a GUP modified entropy\nexhibits a logarithmic correction term. When applying it to the entropic\ninterpretation, we demonstrate that the resulting gravity force law does\ninclude sub-leading order correction terms that depend on hbar. Such deviation\nfrom the classical Newton's law may serve as a probe to the validity of the\nentropic gravity postulate.\n", "  We report the activity measured in rainwater samples collected in the Greater\nSudbury area of eastern Canada on 3, 16, 20, and 26 April 2011. The samples\nwere gamma-ray counted in a germanium detector and the isotopes 131I and 137Cs,\nproduced by the fission of 235U, and 134Cs, produced by neutron capture on\n133Cs, were observed at elevated levels compared to a reference sample of\nice-water. These elevated activities are ascribed to the accident at the\nFukushima Dai-ichi nuclear reactor complex in Japan that followed the 11 March\nearthquake and tsunami. The activity levels observed at no time presented\nhealth concerns.\n", "  We utilize an event-by-event relativistic hydrodynamic calculation performed\nat a number of different incident beam energies to investigate the creation of\nhot and dense QCD matter near the critical point. Using state-of-the-art\nanalysis and visualization tools we demonstrate that each collision event\nprobes QCD matter characterized by a wide range of temperatures and\nbaryo-chemical potentials, making a dynamical response of the system to the\nvicinity of the critical point very difficult to isolate above the background.\n", "  We employ the lattice QCD data on Taylor expansion coefficients to extend our\nprevious parametrization of the equation of state to finite baryon density.\nWhen we take into account lattice spacing and quark mass dependence of the\nhadron masses, the Taylor coefficients at low temperature are equal to those of\nhadron resonance gas. Parametrized lattice equation of state can thus be\nsmoothly connected to the hadron resonance gas equation of state at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  Freeze-out conditions in Heavy Ion Collisions are generally determined by\ncomparing experimental results for ratios of particle yields with theoretical\npredictions based on applications of the Hadron Resonance Gas model. We discuss\nhere how this model dependent determination of freeze-out parameters may\neventually be replaced by theoretical predictions based on equilibrium QCD\nthermodynamics.\n", "  By introducing the dressed Polayakov loop or dual chiral condensate as a\ncandidate order parameter to describe the deconfinement phase transition for\nlight flavors, we discuss the interplay between the chiral and deconfinement\nphase transitions, and propose the possible QCD phase diagram at finite\ntemperature and density. We also introduce a dynamical gluodynamic model with\ndimension-2 gluon condensate, which can describe the color electric\ndeconfinement as well as color magnetic confinement.\n", "  Obtaining strong magnetoelectric couplings in bulk materials and\nheterostructures is an ongoing challenge. We demonstrate that manganite\nheterostructures of the form ${\\rm\n(Insulator)/(LaMnO_3)_n/(CaMnO_3)_n/(Insulator)}$ show strong multiferroicity\nin magnetic manganites where ferroelectric polarization is realized by charges\nleaking from ${\\rm LaMnO_3}$ to ${\\rm CaMnO_3}$ due to repulsion. Here, an\neffective nearest-neighbor electron-electron (electron-hole) repulsion\n(attraction) is generated by cooperative electron-phonon interaction. Double\nexchange, when a particle virtually hops to its unoccupied neighboring site and\nback, produces magnetic polarons that polarize antiferromagnetic regions. Thus\na striking giant magnetoelectric effect ensues when an external electrical\nfield enhances the electron leakage across the interface.\n", "  We study the QCD phase structure at high temperature and density adopting a\nhistogram method. Because the quark determinant is complex at finite density,\nthe Monte-Carlo method cannot be applied directly. We use a reweighting method\nand try to solve the problems which arise in the reweighting method, i.e. the\nsign problem and the overlap problem. We discuss the chemical potential\ndependence of the probability distribution function in the heavy quark mass\nregion and examine the applicability of the approach in the light quark region.\n", "  A non-Abelian gauge field with a topological action is coupled to a spin 3/2\nMajorana spinor. The symmetries of this model are analyzed using the Dirac\nconstraint formalism. These symmetries include a Fermionic symmetry and the\nalgebra of these symmetries closes; it is not the algebra of supergravity. The\naction is invariant without the need to introduce auxiliary fields.\n", "  We present low temperature transport measurements on dual-gated suspended\ntrilayer graphene in the quantum Hall (QH) regime. We observe QH plateaus at\nfilling factors {\\nu}=-8, -2, 2, 6, and 10, in agreement with the\nfull-parameter tight binding calculations. In high magnetic fields, odd-integer\nplateaus are also resolved, indicating almost complete lifting of the 12-fold\ndegeneracy of the lowest Landau levels (LL). Under an out-of-plane electric\nfield E, we observe degeneracy breaking and transitions between QH plateaus.\nInterestingly, depending on its direction, E selectively breaks the LL\ndegeneracies in the electron-doped or hole-doped regimes. Our results\nunderscore the rich interaction-induced phenomena in trilayer graphene.\n", "  The infinitesimal transformations that leave invariant a two-covariant\nsymmetric tensor are studied. The interest of these symmetry transformations\nlays in the fact that this class of tensors includes the energy-momentum and\nRicci tensors. We find that in most cases the class of infinitesimal generators\nof these transformations is a finite dimensional Lie algebra but also, in some\ncases exhibiting a higher degree of degeneracy, this class is infinite\ndimensional and may fail to be a Lie algebra.\n", "  A numerical simulation of evolution of an identical interacting streamers\narray in semiconductors has been performed using the diffusion-drift\napproximation and taking into account the impact and tunnel ionization. It has\nbeen assumed that the external electric field Eo is static and uniform, the\nbackground electrons and holes are absent, the initial avalanches start\nsimultaneously from the nodes of the plane hexagonal lattice, which is\nperpendicular to the external field, however the avalanches and streamers are\naxially symmetric within a cylinder of radius R. It has been shown that under\ncertain conditions, the interaction between the streamers leads finally either\nto the formation of two types of stationary ionization waves with corrugated\nfront or to a stationary plane ionization wave. A diagram of different steady\nstates of this type waves in the plane of parameter [Eo,R] has been presented\nand a qualitative explanation of the plane partition into four different\nregions has been given. Characteristics of corrugated waves have been studied\nin detail and discussed in the region of R and Eo large values, in which the\nmaximum field strength at the front is large enough for the tunnel ionization\nimplementation. It has been shown that corrugated waves ionize semiconductor\nmore efficiently than flat ones, especially in relatively weak external fields.\n", "  This is an introductory text reviewing Lieb-Robinson bounds for open and\nclosed quantum many-body systems. We introduce the Heisenberg picture for\ntime-dependent local Liouvillians and state a Lieb-Robinson bound that gives\nrise to a maximum speed of propagation of correlations in many body systems of\nlocally interacting spins and fermions. Finally, we discuss a number of\nimportant consequences concerning the simulation of time evolution and\nproperties of ground states and stationary states.\n", "  Density functional theory is a successful branch of numerical simulations of\nquantum systems. While the foundations are rigorously defined, the universal\nfunctional must be approximated resulting in a `semi'-ab initio approach. The\nsearch for improved functionals has resulted in hundreds of functionals and\nremains an active research area. This chapter is concerned with understanding\nfundamental limitations of any algorithmic approach to approximating the\nuniversal functional. The results based on Hamiltonian complexity presented\nhere are largely based on \\cite{Schuch09}. In this chapter, we explain the\ncomputational complexity of DFT and any other approach to solving electronic\nstructure Hamiltonians. The proof relies on perturbative gadgets widely used in\nHamiltonian complexity and we provide an introduction to these techniques using\nthe Schrieffer-Wolff method. Since the difficulty of this problem has been well\nappreciated before this formalization, practitioners have turned to a host\napproximate Hamiltonians. By extending the results of \\cite{Schuch09}, we show\nin DFT, although the introduction of an approximate potential leads to a\nnon-interacting Hamiltonian, it remains, in the worst case, an NP-complete\nproblem.\n", "  We discuss the asymptotic behavior of conversions between two independent and\nidentical distributions up to the second-order conversion rate when the\nconversion is produced by a deterministic function from the input probability\nspace to the output probability space. To derive the second-order conversion\nrate, we introduce new probability distributions named Rayleigh-normal\ndistributions. The family of Rayleigh-normal distributions includes a Rayleigh\ndistribution and coincides with the standard normal distribution in the limit\ncase. Using this family of probability distributions, we represent the\nasymptotic second-order rates for the distribution conversion. As an\napplication, we also consider the asymptotic behavior of conversions between\nthe multiple copies of two pure entangled states in quantum systems when only\nlocal operations and classical communications (LOCC) are allowed. This problem\ncontains entanglement concentration, entanglement dilution and a kind of\ncloning problem with LOCC restriction as special cases.\n", "  In this paper we consider the problem of the occurrence of spurious modes\nwhen computing the eigenvalues of Dirac operators, with the motivation to\ndescribe relativistic electrons in an atom or a molecule. We present recent\nmathematical results which we illustrate by simple numerical experiments. We\nalso discuss open problems.\n", "  The Resonating Valence Bond theory of the chemical bond was introduced soon\nafter the discovery of quantum mechanics and has contributed to explain the\nrole of electron correlation within a particularly simple and intuitive\napproach where the chemical bond between two nearby atoms is described by one\nor more singlet electron pairs. In this chapter Pauling's resonating valence\nbond theory of the chemical bond is revisited within a new formulation,\nintroduced by P.W. Anderson after the discovery of High-Tc superconductivity.\nIt is shown that this intuitive picture of electron correlation becomes now\npractical and efficient, since it allows us to faithfully exploit the locality\nof the electron correlation, and to describe several new phases of matter, such\nas Mott insulators, High-Tc superconductors, and spin liquid phases.\n", "  We present the Copupled Cluster (CC) method and the Density matrix\nRenormalization Grooup (DMRG) method in a unified way, from the perspective of\nrecent developments in tensor product approximation. We present an introduction\ninto recently developed hierarchical tensor representations, in particular\ntensor trains which are matrix product states in physics language. The discrete\nequations of full CI approximation applied to the electronic Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is casted into a tensorial framework in form of the second\nquantization. A further approximation is performed afterwards by tensor\napproximation within a hierarchical format or equivalently a tree tensor\nnetwork. We establish the (differential) geometry of low rank hierarchical\ntensors and apply the Driac Frenkel principle to reduce the original\nhigh-dimensional problem to low dimensions. The DMRG algorithm is established\nas an optimization method in this format with alternating directional search.\nWe briefly introduce the CC method and refer to our theoretical results. We\ncompare this approach in the present discrete formulation with the CC method\nand its underlying exponential parametrization.\n", "  New computational technique based on the symbolic description utilizing\nkneading invariants is used for explorations of parametric chaos in a two\nexemplary systems with the Lorenz attractor: a normal model from mathematics,\nand a laser model from nonlinear optics. The technique allows for uncovering\nthe stunning complexity and universality of the patterns discovered in the\nbi-parametric scans of the given models and detects their organizing centers --\ncodimension-two T-points and separating saddles.\n", "  The interplay between nonlinear dynamic systems and noise has proved to be of\ngreat relevance in several application areas. In this presentation, we focus on\nthe areas of information transmission and storage. We review some recent\nresults on information transmission through nonlinear channels assisted by\nnoise. We also present recent proposals of memory devices in which noise plays\nan essential role. Finally, we discuss new results on the influence of noise in\nmemristors.\n", "  Neutron detectors are extensively used at many nuclear research facilities\nacross Europe. Their application range covers many topics in basic and applied\nnuclear research: in nuclear structure and reaction dynamics (reaction\nreconstruction and decay studies); in nuclear astrophysics (neutron emission\nprobabilities); in nuclear technology (nuclear data measurements and\nin-core/off-core monitors); in nuclear medicine (radiation monitors,\ndosimeters); in materials science (neutron imaging techniques); in homeland\nsecurity applications (fissile materials investigation and cargo inspection).\nLiquid scintillators, widely used at present, have however some drawbacks given\nby toxicity, flammability, volatility and sensitivity to oxygen that limit\ntheir duration and quality. Even plastic scintillators are not satisfactory\nbecause they have low radiation hardness and low thermal stability. Moreover\norganic solvents may affect their optical properties due to crazing. In order\nto overcome these problems, phenyl-polysiloxane based scintillators have been\nrecently developed at Legnaro National Laboratory. This new solution showed\nvery good chemical and thermal stability and high radiation hardness. The\nresults on the different samples performance will be presented, paying special\nattention to a characterization comparison between synthesized phenyl\ncontaining polysiloxane resins where a Pt catalyst has been used and a\nscintillating material obtained by condensation reaction, where tin based\ncompounds are used as catalysts. Different structural arrangements as a result\nof different substituents on the main chain have been investigated by High\nResolution X-Ray Diffraction, while the effect of improved optical\ntransmittance on the scintillation yield has been elucidated by a combination\nof excitation/fluorescence measurements and scintillation yield under exposure\nto alpha and {\\gamma}-rays.\n", "  We review an approach where the energy functional of Density-Functional\nTheory (DFT) can be determined without empiricism via a Quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC) procedure. The idea consists of a nested iterative loop where the\nconfigurational space of the electrons in the QMC procedure is determined by a\ntrial oneparticle electron density; this allows then for the determination of a\nfirst guess for the energy functional, which is then in turn used for a DFT\nminimization process. This latter delivers a new electron density and the loop\nis repeated iteratively until convergence is reached and thus the electronic\nstructure of the system determined. In essence, from the applied point of view,\nsuch an approach is a compromise between the large computational cost but high\naccuracy of QMC and the reasonable computational cost but lower accuracy of\nDFT. The proposed approach goes beyond the standard Kohn-Sham method, which is\nthe standard in DFT, and requires neither orbitals nor the a priori\nspecification of the exchange and correlation functional. From the conceptual\npoint of view, the relevant aspect is that the 3N-dimensional wavefunction is\nderived as a function(al) of the three-dimensional electron density, which is\nthe key principle of DFT.\n", "  We consider random number conversion (RNC) through random number storage with\nrestricted size. We clarify the relation between the performance of RNC and the\nsize of storage in the framework of first- and second- order asymptotics, and\nderive their rate regions. Then, we show that the results for RNC with\nrestricted storage recover those for conventional RNC without storage in the\nlimit of storage size. To treat RNC via restricted storage, we introduce a new\nkind of probability distributions named generalized Rayleigh-normal\ndistributions. Using the generalized Rayleigh-normal distributions, we can\ndescribe the second-order asymptotic behaviour of RNC via restricted storage in\na unified manner. As an application to quantum information theory, we analyze\nLOCC conversion via entanglement storage with restricted size. Moreover, we\nderive the optimal LOCC compression rate under a constraint of conversion\naccuracy.\n", "  The introduction of femto-chemistry has made it a primary goal to follow the\nnuclear and electronic evolution of a molecule in time and space as it\nundergoes a chemical reaction. Using Coulomb Explosion Imaging we have shot the\nfirst high-resolution molecular movie of a to and fro isomerization process in\nthe acetylene cation. So far, this kind of phenomenon could only be observed\nusing VUV light from a Free Electron Laser [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 263002\n(2010)]. Here we show that 266 nm ultrashort laser pulses are capable of\ninitiating rich dynamics through multiphoton ionization. With our generally\napplicable tabletop approach that can be used for other small organic\nmolecules, we have investigated two basic chemical reactions simultaneously:\nproton migration and C=C bond-breaking, triggered by multiphoton ionization.\nThe experimental results are in excellent agreement with the timescales and\nrelaxation pathways predicted by new and definitively quantitative ab initio\ntrajectory simulations.\n", "  In snapshots, this exposition introduces conformal field theory, with a focus\non those perspectives that are relevant for interpreting superconformal field\ntheory by Calabi-Yau geometry. It includes a detailed discussion of the\nelliptic genus as an invariant which certain superconformal field theories\nshare with the Calabi-Yau manifolds. K3 theories are (re)viewed as prime\nexamples of superconformal field theories where geometric interpretations are\nknown. A final snapshot addresses the K3-related Mathieu Moonshine phenomena,\nwhere a lead role is predicted for the chiral de Rham complex.\n", "  Mel Levy and Elliott Lieb are two of the most prominent researchers who have\ndedicated their efforts to the investigation of fundamental questions in\nmany-electron theory. Their results have not only revolutionized the\ntheoretical approach of the field, but, directly or indirectly, allowed for a\nquantum jump in the computational treatment of realistic systems as well. For\nthis reason, at the conclusion of our book where the subject is treated across\ndifferent disciplines, we have asked Mel Levy and Elliott Lieb to provide us\nwith some open problems, which they believe will be a worth challenge for the\nfuture also in the perspective of a synergy among the various disciplines.\n", "  Novel mechanisms of defect annealing in solids are discussed, which are based\non the large amplitude anharmonic lattice vibrations, a.k.a. intrinsic\nlocalized modes or discrete breathers (DBs). A model for amplification of\ndefect annealing rate in Ge by low energy plasma-generated DBs is proposed, in\nwhich, based on recent atomistic modelling, it is assumed that DBs can excite\natoms around defects rather strongly, giving them energy $\\gg k_BT$ for\n$\\sim$100 oscillation periods. This is shown to result in the amplification of\nthe annealing rates proportional to the DB flux, i.e. to the flux of ions (or\nenergetic atoms) impinging at the Ge surface from inductively coupled plasma\n(ICP)\n", "  We discuss transport on load bearing branching hierarchical networks which\ncan model diverse systems which can serve as models of river networks, computer\nnetworks, respiratory networks and granular media. We study avalanche\ntransmissions and directed percolation on these networks, and on the V lattice,\ni.e., the strongest realization of the lattice. We find that typical\nrealizations of the lattice show multimodal distributions for the avalanche\ntransmissions, and a second order transition for directed percolation. On the\nother hand, the V lattice shows power - law behavior for avalanche\ntransmissions, and a first order (explosive) transition to percolation. The V\nlattice is thus the critical case of hierarchical networks. We note that small\nperturbations to the V lattice destroy the power-law behavior of the\ndistributions, and the first order nature of the percolation. We discuss the\nimplications of our results.\n", "  Objective testing is a key issue in the process of revision and improvement\nof seismic hazard assessments. Therefore we continue the rigorous comparative\nanalysis of past and newly available hazard maps for the territory of Italy\nagainst the seismic activity observed in reality. The final Global Seismic\nHazard Assessment Program (GSHAP) results and the most recent version of\nSeismic Hazard Harmonization in Europe (SHARE) project maps, along with the\nreference hazard maps for the Italian seismic code, all obtained by\nprobabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA), are cross-compared to the three\nground shaking maps based on the duly physically and mathematically rooted\nneo-deterministic approach (NDSHA). These eight hazard maps for Italy are\ntested against the available data on ground shaking. The results of comparison\nbetween predicted macroseismic intensities and those reported for past\nearthquakes (in the time interval from 1000 to 2014 year) show that models\nprovide rather conservative estimates, which tend to over-estimate seismic\nhazard at the ground shaking levels below the MCS intensity IX. Only exception\nis represented by the neo-deterministic maps associated with a fixed return\nperiod of 475 or 2475 years, which provide a better fit to observations, at the\ncost of model consistent 10% or 2% cases of exceedance respectively. In terms\nof the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit criterion, although all of the eight\nhazard maps differ significantly from the distribution of the observed ground\nshaking reported in the available Italian databases, the NDSHA approach appears\nto outscore significantly the PSHA one.\n", "  This note is a review of the recently revealed intriguing connection between\nintegrable quantum spin chains and integrable many-body systems of classical\nmechanics. The essence of this connection lies in the fact that the spectral\nproblem for quantum Hamiltonians of the former models is closely related to a\nsort of inverse spectral problem for Lax matrices of the latter ones. For\nsimplicity, we focus on the most transparent and familiar case of spin chains\non N sites constructed by means of the GL(2)-invariant R-matrix. They are\nrelated to the classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider system of N particles, which is\nknown to be an integrable deformation of the Calogero-Moser system. As an\nexplicit example the case N=2 is considered in detail.\n", "  We first review the derivation of an effective one-dimensional (1D) discrete\nnonpolynomial Schr\\\"odinger equation from the continuous 3D Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation with transverse harmonic confinement and axial periodic potential.\nThen we study the bright solitons obtained from this discrete nonpolynomial\nequation showing that they give rise to the collapse of the condensate above a\ncritical attractive strength. We also investigate the dimensional reduction of\na bosonic quantum field theory, deriving an effective 1D nonpolynomial\nHeisenberg equation from the 3D Heisenberg equation of the continuous bosonic\nfield operator under the action of transverse harmonic confinement. Moreover,\nby taking into account the presence of an axial periodic potential we find a\ngeneralized Bose-Hubbard model which reduces to the familiar 1D Bose-Hubbard\nHamiltonian only if a strong inequality is satisfied. Remarkably, in the\nabsence of axial periodic potential our 1D nonpolynomial Heisenberg equation\ngives the generalized Lieb-Liniger theory we obtained some years ago.\n", "  Experimental results often do not assess network structure; rather, the\nnetwork structure is inferred by the dynamics of the nodes. From the dynamics\nof the nodes one then constructs a network of functional relations, termed the\nfunctional network. A fundamental question in the analysis of complex systems\nconcerns the relation between functional and structural networks. Using\nsynchronisation as a paradigm for network functionality, we study the dynamics\nof cluster formation in functional networks. We show that the functional\nnetwork can drastically differ from the structural network. We uncover the\nmechanism driving these bifurcations by obtaining necessary conditions for\nmodular synchronisation.\n", "  The LDA+DMFT method is a very powerful tool for gaining insight into the\nphysics of strongly correlated materials. It combines traditional ab-initio\ndensity-functional techniques with the dynamical mean-field theory. The core\naspects of the method are (i) building material-specific Hubbard-like many-body\nmodels and (ii) solving them in the dynamical mean-field approximation. Step\n(i) requires the construction of a localized one-electron basis, typically a\nset of Wannier functions. It also involves a number of approximations, such as\nthe choice of the degrees of freedom for which many-body effects are explicitly\ntaken into account, the scheme to account for screening effects, or the form of\nthe double-counting correction. Step (ii) requires the dynamical mean-field\nsolution of multi-orbital generalized Hubbard models. Here central is the\nquantum-impurity solver, which is also the computationally most demanding part\nof the full LDA+DMFT approach. In this chapter I will introduce the core\naspects of the LDA+DMFT method and present a prototypical application.\n", "  The question whether a nonlinear localized mode (discrete soliton/breather)\ncan be mobile in a lattice has a standard interpretation in terms of the\nPeierls-Nabarro (PN) potential barrier. For the most commonly studied cases,\nthe PN barrier for strongly localized solutions becomes large, rendering these\nessentially immobile. Several ways to improve the mobility by reducing the\nPN-barrier have been proposed during the last decade, and the first part gives\na brief review of such scenarios in 1D and 2D. We then proceed to discuss two\nrecently discovered novel mobility scenarios. The first example is the 2D\nKagome lattice, where the existence of a highly degenerate, flat linear band\nallows for a very small PN-barrier and mobility of highly localized modes in a\nsmall-power regime. The second example is a 1D waveguide array in an active\nmedium with intrinsic (saturable) gain and damping, where exponentially\nlocalized, travelling discrete dissipative solitons may exist as stable\nattractors. Finally, using the framework of an extended Bose-Hubbard model, we\nshow that while quantum fluctuations destroy the mobility of slowly moving,\nstrongly localized classical modes, coherent mobility of rapidly moving states\nsurvives even in a strongly quantum regime.\n", "  We survey the application of a relatively new branch of statistical\nphysics--\"community detection\"-- to data mining. In particular, we focus on the\ndiagnosis of materials and automated image segmentation. Community detection\ndescribes the quest of partitioning a complex system involving many elements\ninto optimally decoupled subsets or communities of such elements. We review a\nmultiresolution variant which is used to ascertain structures at different\nspatial and temporal scales. Significant patterns are obtained by examining the\ncorrelations between different independent solvers. Similar to other\ncombinatorial optimization problems in the NP complexity class, community\ndetection exhibits several phases. Typically, illuminating orders are revealed\nby choosing parameters that lead to extremal information theory correlations.\n", "  The physics of ice crystal growth from the liquid phase, especially in the\npresence of salt, has received much less attention than the growth of snow\ncrystals from the vapour phase. The growth of so-called frazil ice by\nsolidification of a supercooled aqueous salt solution is consistent with\ncrystal growth in the basal plane being limited by the diffusive removal of the\nlatent heat of solidification from the solid--liquid interface, while being\nlimited by attachment kinetics in the perpendicular direction. This leads to\nthe formation of approximately disk-shaped crystals with a low aspect ratio of\nthickness compared to radius, because radial growth is much faster than axial\ngrowth. We calculate numerically how fast disk-shaped crystals grow in both\npure and binary melts, accounting for the comparatively slow axial growth, the\neffect of dissolved solute in the fluid phase and the difference in thermal\nproperties between solid and fluid phases. We identify the main physical\nmechanisms that control crystal growth and show that the diffusive removal of\nboth the latent heat released and also the salt rejected at the growing\ninterface are significant. Our calculations demonstrate that certain previous\nparameterizations, based on scaling arguments, substantially underestimate\ncrystal growth rates by a factor of order 10-100 for low aspect ratio disks,\nand provide a parameterization for use in models of ice crystal growth in\nenvironmental settings.\n", "  Oberdieck and Pandharipande conjectured that the curve counting invariants of\n$S\\times E$, the product of a $K3$ surface and an elliptic curve, is given by\nminus the reciprocal of the Igusa cusp form of weight 10. For a fixed primitive\ncurve class in $S$ of square $2h-2$, their conjecture predicts that the\ncorresponding partition functions are given by meromorphic Jacobi forms of\nweight $-10$ and index $h-1$. We calculate the partition functions for\nprimitive classes of square -2 and of square 0.\n  Our computation uses reduced Donaldson-Thomas invariants which are defined as\nthe Behrend function weighted Euler characteristics of the quotient of the\nHilbert scheme of curves in $S\\times E$ by the action of $E$. Our technique is\na mixture of motivic and toric methods (developed with Martijn Kool) which\nallows us to express the partition functions in terms of the topological vertex\nand subsequently in terms of Jacobi forms. We compute the partition functions\nfor both Behrend function weighted Euler characteristics and for unweighted\nEuler characteristics. The results for the Behrend function weighted case\ndepends on Conjecture 18 from https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07369\n", "  There has been an increasing interest in the quantification of nearly\ndeterministic work extraction from a finite number of copies of microscopic\nparticles in finite time. This paradigm, so called single-shot\nepsilon-deterministic work extraction, considers processes with small failure\nprobabilities. However, the resulting fluctuations in the extracted work\nentailed by this failure probability have not been studied before. In the\nstandard thermodynamics paradigm fluctuation theorems are powerful tools to\nstudy fluctuating quantities. Given that standard fluctuation theorems are\ninadequate for a single-shot scenario, here we formulate and prove a\nfluctuation relation specific to the single-shot epsilon-deterministic work\nextraction to bridge this gap. Our results are general in the sense that we\nallow the system to be in contact with the heat bath at all times. As a\ncorollary of our theorem we derive the known bounds on the\nepsilon-deterministic work.\n", "  Superconductivity is traditionally viewed as a low-temperature phenomenon.\nWithin the BCS theory this is understood to result from the fact that the\npairing of electrons takes place only close to the usually two-dimensional\nFermi surface residing at a finite chemical potential. Because of this, the\ncritical temperature is exponentially suppressed compared to the microscopic\nenergy scales. On the other hand, pairing electrons around a dispersionless\n(flat) energy band leads to very strong superconductivity, with a mean-field\ncritical temperature linearly proportional to the microscopic coupling\nconstant. The prize to be paid is that flat bands can generally be generated\nonly on surfaces and interfaces, where high-temperature superconductivity would\nshow up. The flat-band character and the low dimensionality also mean that\ndespite the high critical temperature such a superconducting state would be\nsubject to strong fluctuations. Here we discuss the topological and\nnon-topological flat bands discussed in different systems, and show that\ngraphite is a good candidate for showing high-temperature flat-band interface\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  We discuss a general framework to address spin decoherence resulting from\nfluctuations in a spin Hamiltonian. We performed a systematic study on spin\ndecoherence in the compound K$_6$[V$_{15}$As$_6$O$_{42}$(D$_2$O)] $\\cdot$\n8D$_2$O, using high-field Electron Spin Resonance (ESR). By analyzing the\nanisotropy of resonance linewidths as a function of orientation, temperature\nand field, we find that the spin-orbit term is a major decoherence source. The\ndemonstrated mechanism can alter the lifetime of any spin qubit and we discuss\nhow to mitigate it by sample design and field orientation.\n", "  The creation of point defects in the crystal lattices of various\nsemiconductors by subthreshold events has been reported on by a number of\ngroups. These observations have been made in great detail using sensitive\nelectrical techniques but there is still much that needs to be clarified.\nExperiments using Ge and Si were performed that demonstrate that energetic\nparticles, the products of collisions in the electron beam, were responsible\nfor the majority of electron-beam deposition (EBD) induced defects in a\ntwo-step energy transfer process. Lowering the number of collisions of these\nenergetic particles with the semiconductor during metal deposition was\naccomplished using a combination of static shields and superior vacuum\nresulting in devices with defect concentrations lower than $\n10^{11}\\,$cm$^{-3}$, the measurement limit of our deep level transient\nspectroscopy (DLTS) system. High energy electrons and photons that samples are\ntypically exposed to were not influenced by the shields as most of these\nparticles originate at the metal target thus eliminating these particles as\npossible damage causing agents. It remains unclear how packets of energy that\ncan sometimes be as small of 2eV travel up to a $\\mu$m into the material while\nstill retaining enough energy, that is, in the order of 1eV, to cause changes\nin the crystal. The manipulation of this defect causing phenomenon may hold the\nkey to developing defect free material for future applications.\n", "  Experimental detection of entanglement of an arbitrary state of a given\nbipartite system is crucial for exploring many areas of quantum information.\nBut such a detection should be made in a device independent way if the\npreparation process of the state is considered to be faithful, in order to\navoid detection of a separable state as entangled one. The recently developed\nscheme of detecting bipartite entanglement in a measurement device independent\nway [Phys. Rev. Lett {\\bf 110}, 060405 (2013)] does require information about\nthe state. Here by using Auguisiak et al.'s universal entanglement witness\nscheme for two-qubit states [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 77}, 030301 (2008)], we provide\na universal detection scheme for two-qubit states in a measurement device\nindependent way. We provide a set of universal witness operators for detecting\nNPT-ness(negative under partial transpose) of states in a measurement device\nindependent way. We conjecture that no such universal entanglement witness\nexists for PPT(positive under partial transpose) entangled states. We also\nanalyse the robustness of some of the experimental schemes of detecting\nentanglement in a measurement device independent way under the influence of\nnoise in the inputs (from the referee) as well as in the measurement operator\nas envisazed in ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett {\\bf 110}, 060405 (2013)].\n", "  We study the electronic structure of cubic phase uranium dioxide at different\nvolumes using a combination of density functional theory and dynamical\nmean-field theory. The \\emph{ab initio} calculations predict an\norbital-selective Mott insulator-metal transition at a moderate pressure of\n$\\approx 45$ GPa. At this pressure the $j=5/2$ states become metallic, while\nthe $j=7/2$ states remain insulating up to about 60 GPa. In the metallic state,\nwe observe a rapid decrease of the 5$f$ occupation and total angular momentum\nwith pressure. Simultaneously, the generalized Zhang-Rice state, which is of\npredominantly $j=5/2$ character, quickly disappears after the transition into\nthe metallic phase.\n", "  HI intensity mapping is a new observational technique to map fluctuations in\nthe large-scale structure of matter using the 21 cm emission line of atomic\nhydrogen (HI). Sensitive radio surveys have the potential to detect Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillations (BAO) at low redshifts (z < 1) in order to constrain the\nproperties of dark energy. Observations of the HI signal will be contaminated\nby instrumental noise and, more significantly, by astrophysical foregrounds,\nsuch as Galactic synchrotron emission, which is at least four orders of\nmagnitude brighter than the HI signal. Foreground cleaning is recognised as one\nof the key challenges for future radio astronomy surveys. We study the ability\nof the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) method to\nsubtract radio foregrounds and to recover the cosmological HI signal for a\ngeneral HI intensity mapping experiment. The GNILC method is a new technique\nthat uses both frequency and spatial information to separate the components of\nthe observed data. Our results show that the method is robust to the complexity\nof the foregrounds. For simulated radio observations including HI emission,\nGalactic synchrotron, Galactic free-free, radio sources and 0.05 mK thermal\nnoise, we find that we can reconstruct the HI power spectrum for multipoles 30\n< l < 150 with 6% accuracy on 50% of the sky for a redshift z ~ 0.25.\n", "  We discuss an approach to compute the first and second moments of the number\nof eigenvalues $I_N$ that lie in an arbitrary interval of the real line for $N\n\\times N$ Gaussian random matrices. The method combines the standard\nreplica-symmetric theory with a perturbative expansion of the saddle-point\naction up to $O(1/N)$ ($N \\gg 1$), leading to the correct logarithmic scaling\nof the variance $\\langle I_{N}^{2} \\rangle - \\langle I_N \\rangle^2 = O(\\ln N)$\nas well as to an analytical expression for the $O(1/N)$ correction to the\naverage $\\langle I_N \\rangle/N$. Standard results for the number variance at\nthe local scaling regime are recovered in the limit of a vanishing interval.\nThe limitations of the replica-symmetric method are unveiled by comparing our\nresults with those derived through exact methods. The present work represents\nan important step to study the fluctuations of $I_N$ in non-invariant random\nmatrix ensembles, where the joint distribution of eigenvalues is not known.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the localization of a bulk gravitino field on\nthe scalar-tensor branes and compare the result with that in the\nRandall-Sundrum-1 (RS1) model. The coupled chiral equations for the\nKaluza-Klein (KK) modes of the gravitino field are obtained by fixing the gauge\n$\\Psi_5=0$ and using the chiral KK decompositions. It is shown that, in the RS1\nmodel for the left- and right-handed zero modes of the gravitino field, only\none of them can be localized near one brane. For the massive modes, both chiral\nmodes survive and the lower KK modes are localized near the IR brane from the\nfour-dimensional physical coordinate point of view. However, for the\nscalar-tensor brane model, the localization of the gravitino chiral zero modes\ndepends on the coupling parameter $\\lambda$, and they will be not localized\naround anyone brane within a certain range of the parameter $\\lambda$, which is\nquite different from the RS1 model. Furthermore, we also give the corresponding\nmass spectra of the massive KK gravitinos in the scalar-tensor model.\n", "  When the measurements from the FCC-ee become available, an improved\ndetermination of the standard-model \"input\" parameters will be needed to fully\nexploit the new precision data towards either constraining or fitting the\nparameters of beyond-the-standard-model theories. Among these input parameters\nis the electromagnetic coupling constant estimated at the Z mass scale,\nalpha_QED(mZ). The measurement of the muon forward-backward asymmetry at the\nFCC-ee, just below and just above the Z pole, can be used to make a direct\ndetermination of alpha_QED(mZ) with an accuracy deemed adequate for an optimal\nuse of the FCC-ee precision data.\n", "  We consider a Sklyanin algebra S with 3 generators, which is the quadratic\nalgebra over a field k with three generators x,y,z given by three relations\npxy+qyx+rzz=0, pyz+qzy+rxx=0 and pzx+qxz+ryy=0, where p,q,r are parameters from\nthe fileld k. This class of algebras enjoyed much of attention, in particular,\nusing tools from algebraic geometry, Feigin & Odesskii, and Artin, Tate & Van\nden Berg, showed that if at least two of the parameters p, q and r are non-zero\nand at least two of three numbers p^3,q^3 and r^3 are distinct, then S is\nKoszul and has the same Hilbert series as the algebra of commutative\npolynomials in three variables. It became commonly accepted, that it is\nimpossible to achieve the same objective by purely algebraic and combinatorial\nmeans, like the Groebner basis technique. The main purpose of this paper is to\ntrace combinatorial meaning of the properties of Sklyanin algebras, such as\nKoszulity, PBW, PHS, Calabi-Yau, and to give a new constructive proof of the\nabove facts due to Artin, Tate and Van den Bergh.\n  Further, we study a wider class of Sklyanin algebras, namely the situation\nwhen all parameters of relations could be different. This class called\ngeneralized Sklyanin algebras. We classify up to isomorphism genralized\nSklyanin algebras with polynomial Hilbert series. We show that generalized\nSlyanin algebras in general position have the Golod-Shafarevich Hilbert series\n(with exception of the case of the field with two elements).\n", "  Quantum correlations including entanglement and quantum discord has drawn\nmuch attention in characterizing quantum phase transitions. Quantum deficit\noriginates in questions regarding work extraction from quantum systems coupled\nto a heat bath [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 180402 (2002)]. It links quantum\nthermodynamics with quantum correlations and provides a new standpoint for\nunderstanding quantum non-locality. In this paper, we evaluate the one-way\ndeficit of two adjacent spins in the bulk for the XX model. In the\nthermodynamic limit, the XX model undergoes a first order transition from fully\npolarized to a critical phase with quasi-long-range order with decrease of\nquantum parameter. We find that the one-way deficit becomes nonzero after the\ncritical point. Therefore, the one-way deficit characterizes the quantum phase\ntransition in the XX model.\n", "  The number of clusters per site $n(p)$ in percolation at the critical point\n$p = p_c$ is not itself a universal quantity---it depends upon the lattice and\npercolation type (site or bond). However, many of its properties, including\nfinite-size corrections, scaling behavior with $p$, and amplitude ratios, show\nvarious degrees of universal behavior. Some of these are universal in the sense\nthat the behavior depends upon the shape of the system, but not lattice type.\nHere, we elucidate the various levels of universality for elements of $n(p)$\nboth theoretically and by carrying out extensive studies on several two- and\nthree-dimensional systems, by high-order series analysis, Monte-Carlo\nsimulation, and exact enumeration. We find many new results, including precise\nvalues for $n(p_c)$ for several systems, a clear demonstration of the\nsingularity in $n''(p)$, and metric scale factors. We make use of the matching\npolynomial of Sykes and Essam to find exact relations between properties for\nlattices and matching lattices. We propose a criterion for an absolute metric\nfactor $b$ based upon the singular behavior of the scaling function, rather\nthan a relative definition of the metric that has previously been used.\n", "  The orientational order of nematic liquid crystals is traditionally studied\nby means of the second-rank ordering tensor $\\mathbb{S}$. When this is\ncalculated through experiments or simulations, the symmetry group of the phase\nis not known \\emph{a-priori}, but needs to be deduced from the numerical\nrealisation of $\\mathbb{S}$, which is affected by numerical errors. There is no\ngenerally accepted procedure to perform this analysis. Here, we provide a new\nalgorithm suited to identifying the symmetry group of the phase. As a by\nproduct, we prove that there are only five phase-symmetry classes of the\nsecond-rank ordering tensor and give a canonical representation of $\\mathbb{S}$\nfor each class. The nearest tensor of the assigned symmetry is determined by\ngroup-projection. In order to test our procedure, we generate uniaxial and\nbiaxial phases in a system of interacting particles, endowed with $D_{\\infty\nh}$ or $D_{2h}$, which mimic the outcome of Monte-Carlo simulations. The actual\nsymmetry of the phases is correctly identified, along with the optimal choice\nof laboratory frame.\n", "  We study the intrinsic anisotropy of the superconducting state in\nKFe$_2$As$_2$, using small-angle neutron scattering to image the vortex lattice\nas the applied magnetic field is rotated towards the FeAs crystalline planes.\nThe anisotropy is found to be strongly field dependent, indicating multiband\nsuperconductivity. Furthermore, the high field anisotropy significantly exceeds\nthat of the upper critical field, providing further support for Pauli limiting\nin KFe$_2$As$_2$ for field applied in the basal plane. The effect of Pauli\nparamagnetism on the unpaired quasiparticles in the vortex cores is directly\nevident from the ratio of scattered intensities due to the longitudinal and\ntransverse vortex lattice field modulation.\n", "  We present a review of the phonon thermal conductivity of segmented nanowires\nfocusing on theoretical results for Si and Si/Ge structures with the constant\nand periodically modulated cross-sections. We describe the use of the\nface-centered cubic cell and Born-von Karman models of the lattice vibrations\nfor calculating the phonon energy spectra in the segmented nanowires.\nModification of the phonon spectrum in such nanostructures results in strong\nreduction of the phonon thermal conductivity and suppression of heat transfer\ndue to a trapping of phonon modes in nanowire segments. Possible practical\napplications of segmented nanowires in thermoelectric energy generation are\nalso discussed.\n", "  Cosmic strings in the early universe have received revived interest in recent\nyears. In this paper we derive these structures as topological defects from\nsingular distributions of the quintessence field of dark energy. Our emphasis\nis placed on the topological charge of tangled cosmic strings, which originates\nfrom the Hopf mapping and is a Chern-Simons action possessing strong inherent\ntie to knot topology. It is shown that the Kauffman bracket knot polynomial can\nbe constructed in terms of this charge for un-oriented knotted strings, serving\nas a topological invariant much stronger than the traditional Gauss linking\nnumbers in characterizing string topology. Especially, we introduce a\nmathematical approach of breaking-reconnection which provides a promising\ncandidate for studying physical reconnection processes within the\ncomplexity-reducing cascades of tangled cosmic strings.\n", "  To explain the extremely high energy release, $>10^{53}$~erg, suggested by\nthe observations of some Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) we propose a new energy\nextraction mechanism from the rotation energy of a Kerr-Newman black hole (BH)\nby a massive photon field. Numerical results show that this mechanism is stable\nwith respect to the black hole rotation parameter, $a$, with a clear dependence\non the BH mass, $M$, and charge, $Q$, and can extract energies up to $10^{54}$\nerg. The controversial \"energy crisis\" problem of GRBs that does not show\nevidence for collimated emission may benefit of this energy extraction\nmechanism. With these results we set a lower bound on the coupling between\nelectromagnetic and gravitational fields.\n", "  The holographic approach to study strongly coupled superconductors in the\npresence of dark matter is reviewed. We discuss the influence of dark matter on\nthe superconducting transition temperature of both s-wave and p-wave\nholographic superconductors. The upper critical field, coherence length,\npenetration depth of holographic superconductors as well as the metal-insulator\ntransitions have also been analysed. Issues related to the validity of AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence for the description of superconductors studied in the laboratory\nand possible experiments directed towards the detection of dark matter are\ndiscussed. In doing so we shall compare our assumptions and assertions with\nthose generally accepted in the elementary particle experiments aimed at the\ndetection of dark matter particles.\n", "  We study the cosmological evolution with nonsingular branes generated by a\nbulk scalar field coupled to gravity. The specific setup investigated leads to\nbranes with a time-dependent warp factor. We calculate the effective Hubble\nparameter and the effective scale factor for the FRW branes obtained solutions.\nThe spatially dependent branes solutions also were found.\n", "  We investigate the effects of cooperativity between contagion processes that\nspread and persist in a host population. We propose and analyze a dynamical\nmodel in which individuals that are affected by one transmissible agent $A$\nexhibit a higher than baseline propensity of being affected by a second agent\n$B$ and vice versa. The model is a natural extension of the traditional SIS\n(Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model used for modeling single contagion\nprocesses. We show that cooperativity changes the dynamics of the system\nconsiderably when cooperativity is strong. The system exhibits discontinuous\nphase transitions not observed in single agent contagion, multi-stability, a\nseparation of the traditional epidemic threshold into different thresholds for\ninception and extinction as well as hysteresis. These properties are robust and\nare corroborated by stochastic simulations on lattices and generic network\ntopologies. Finally, we investigate wave propagation and transients in a\nspatially extended version of the model and show that especially for\nintermediate values of baseline reproduction ratios the system is characterized\nby various types of wave-front speeds. The system can exhibit spatially\nheterogeneous stationary states for some parameters and negative front speeds\n(receding wave fronts). The two agent model can be employed as a starting point\nfor more complex contagion processes, involving several interacting agents, a\nmodel framework particularly suitable for modeling the spread and dynamics of\nmicrobiological ecosystems in host populations.\n", "  We consider an extension of the Standard Model with a singlet sector\nconsisting of a real (pseudo)scalar and a Dirac fermion coupled with the\nStandard Model only via the scalar portal. We assume that the portal coupling\nis weak enough for the singlet sector not to thermalize with the Standard Model\nallowing the production of singlet particles via the freeze-in mechanism. If\nthe singlet sector interacts with itself sufficiently strongly, it may\nthermalize within itself, resulting in dark matter abundance determined by the\nfreeze-out mechanism operating within the singlet sector. We investigate this\nscenario in detail. In particular, we show that requiring the absence of\ninflationary isocurvature fluctuations provides lower bounds on the magnitude\nof the dark sector self-interactions and in parts of the parameter space favors\nsufficiently large self-couplings, supported also by the features observed in\nthe small-scale structure formation.\n", "  We report GHz longitudinal as well as shear acoustic phonons photoexcitation\nand photodetection using femtosecond laser pulses in a spin-crossover molecular\ncrystal. From our experimental observation of time domain Brillouin scattering\ntriggered by the photoexcitation of acoustic waves across the low-spin (LS) to\nhigh-spin (HS) thermal crossover, we reveal a link between molecular spin state\nand photoexcitation of coherent GHz acoustic phonons. In particular, we\nexperimentally evidence an unconventional non-thermal pathway for the laser\nexcitation of GHz phonons. We also provide experimental insight on the optical\nand mechanical parameters evolution across the LS/HS spin crossover temperature\nT$_{1/2}$.\n", "  Complete Hamiltonian formalism is suggested for inertial waves in rotating\nincompressible fluid. Resonance three-wave interaction processes -- decay\ninstability and confluence of two waves -- are shown to play a key role in the\nweakly nonlinear dynamics and statistics of inertial waves in the rapid\nrotation case. Future applications of the Hamiltonian approach in inertial wave\ntheory are investigated and discussed.\n", "  We show that monochromatic long-crested corrugations on an otherwise flat\nseafloor can coherently scatter the energy of an oblique incident internal wave\nto multiple multi-directional higher-mode waves via a series of resonant\ninteractions. We demonstrate that a resonance between seabed corrugations and a\nnormally or slightly oblique incident internal wave results in a series of\nfollow-up resonant interactions, which take place between the same corrugations\nand successively resonated shorter waves. A chain resonance of internal waves\nthat carries energy to small scales is thus obtained, and we find that the\nRichardson number decreases by several orders of magnitude over the corrugated\npatch. If the incidence angle is large, and the incident wave perfectly\nsatisfies a resonance condition with the topography, it turns out that not many\nhigher-mode resonance or near-resonance conditions can be satisfied, such that\nenergy stays confined within the first few modes. Nevertheless, if the incident\nwaves are sufficiently detuned from satisfying a perfect resonance condition\nwith the seabed corrugations, then we show that this frequency detuning may\nbalance off the large detuning due to oblique incidence, leading to a chain\nresonance that again carries energy to small scales. The evolution of the\nincident and resonated wave amplitudes is predicted from the envelope equation\nfor internal waves over resonant seabed topography in a three-dimensional\nrotating fluid, which we derive considering the Boussinesq and $f$-plane\napproximations with $f$ the Coriolis frequency, linear density stratification\nand small-amplitude corrugations. Our results suggest that topographic features\non the ocean floor with a dominant wavenumber vector, through the chain\nresonance mechanism elucidated here, may play a more important role than\npreviously thought in the enhancement of diapycnal mixing and energy\ndissipation.\n", "  We consider the twistor description of conformal higher spin theories and\ngive twistor space actions for the self-dual sector of theories with spin\ngreater than two that produce the correct flat space-time spectrum. We identify\na ghost-free subsector, analogous to the embedding of Einstein gravity with\ncosmological constant in Weyl gravity, which generates the unique spin-s\nthree-point anti-MHV amplitude consistent with Poincare invariance and helicity\nconstraints. By including interactions between the infinite tower of\nhigher-spin fields we give a geometric interpretation to the twistor equations\nof motion as the integrability condition for a holomorphic structure on an\ninfinite jet bundle. Finally, we introduce anti-self-dual interaction terms to\ndefine a twistor action for the full conformal higher spin theory.\n", "  Quantum coherence (QCh) is considered to be a key ingredient in quantum\nresource theories and also plays a pivotal role in the design and\nimplementation of various information processing tasks. Consequently, it\nbecomes important for us to create more number coherent quantum states between\ntwo labs from a given coherent state shared initially. We call this process as\n\\textbf{Broadcasting of Quantum Coherence (QCh)}. In this work we extensively\nstudy the problem of broadcasting of QCh. In order to have a holistic view of\nbroadcasting, we start with a most general representation two qubit mixed state\nin terms of Bloch vectors. As a cloning transformation we have used universal\nsymmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery (BH) cloner locally as well as non locally.\nRemarkably, we find that in either of the case it is impossible to do optimal\nbroadcasting of QCh. Further we show in case of non optimal broadcasting it is\nimpossible to increase QCh of the state by both local and non local cloning\noperations. In non optimal case, apart from general result we consider examples\nlike, a) Werner like states (WLS) and b) Bell diagonal states (BDS) and obtain\nranges for broadcasting in terms of input state parameters.\n", "  The form of higher-spin current interactions in $AdS_4$ is derived from the\nfull nonlinear higher-spin equations in the sector of Weyl 0-forms. The\ncoupling constant in front of spin-one currents built from scalars and spinors\nas well as Yukawa coupling are determined explicitly. Couplings of all other\nhigher-spin current interactions are determined implicitly. All couplings are\nshown to be independent of the phase parameter of the nonlinear higher-spin\ntheory. The proper holographic dependence of the vertex on the higher-spin\nphase parameter is shown to result from the boundary conditions on the bulk\nfields.\n", "  We combine the known asymptotic behaviour of the QCD perturbation series\nexpansion, which relates the pole mass of a heavy quark to the MSbar mass, with\nthe exact series coefficients up to the four-loop order to determine the\nultimate uncertainty of the top-quark pole mass due to the renormalon\ndivergence. We perform extensive tests of our procedure by varying the number\nof colours and flavours, as well as the scale of the strong coupling and the\nMSbar mass. Including an estimate of the internal bottom and charm quark mass\neffect, we conclude that this uncertainty is around 110 MeV. We further\nestimate the additional contribution to the mass relation from the five-loop\ncorrection and beyond to be around 300 MeV.\n", "  Logarithmic conformal field theories have a vast range of applications, from\ncritical percolation to systems with quenched disorder. In this paper we\nthoroughly examine the structure of these theories based on their symmetry\nproperties. Our analysis is model-independent and holds for any spacetime\ndimension. Our results include a determination of the general form of\ncorrelation functions and conformal block decompositions, clearing the path for\nfuture bootstrap applications. Several examples are discussed in detail,\nincluding logarithmic generalized free fields, holographic models,\nself-avoiding random walks and critical percolation.\n", "  We present a search for a non-Standard-Model invisible particle $X^0$ in the\nmass range $0.1\\textrm{-}1.8 \\,{\\rm GeV}/{c^2}$ in $B^{+}\\to e^{+} X^{0}$ and\n$B^{+}\\to \\mu^{+} X^{0}$ decays. The results are obtained from a $711~{\\rm\nfb}^{-1}$ data sample that corresponds to $772 \\times 10^{6} B\\bar{B}$ pairs,\ncollected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB\n$e^+ e^-$ collider. One $B$ meson is fully reconstructed in a hadronic mode to\ndetermine the momentum of the lepton of the signal decay in the rest frame of\nthe recoiling partner $B$ meson. We find no evidence of a signal and set upper\nlimits on the order of $10^{-6}$.\n", "  In this paper, some characterizations about transitivity, mildly mixing\nproperty, $\\mathbf{a}$-transitivity, equicontinuity, uniform rigidity and\nproximality of Zadeh's extensions restricted on some invariant closed subsets\nof the space of all upper semi-continuous fuzzy sets with the level-wise metric\nare obtained. In particular, it is proved that a dynamical system is weakly\nmixing (resp., mildly mixing, weakly mixing and $\\mathbf{a}$-transitive,\nequicontinuous, uniformly rigid) if and only if the Zadeh's extension is\ntransitive (resp., mildly mixing, $\\mathbf{a}$-transitive, equicontinuous,\nuniformly rigid).\n", "  Recent astronomical discoveries of supermassive black holes (quasars),\ngamma-bursters, supernovae, and dust at high redshifts, z = (5 --10), are\nreviewed. Such a dense population of the early universe is at odds with the\nconventional mechanisms of its possible origin. Similar data from the\ncontemporary universe, which are also in conflict with natural expectations,\nare considered too. Two possible mechanisms are suggested, at least one of\nwhich can potentially solve all these problems. As a by-product of the last\nmodel, an abundant cosmological antimatter may be created.\n", "  A new Dimensional Regularization of $\\gamma_5$ is proposed. Cyclicity and\nLorentz covariance are enforced. The extension to generic dimension is based on\nthe integral representation of the trace of gamma's, presented in a previous\npaper.\n", "  We present a systematic mathematical analysis of the qualitative steady-state\nresponse to rate perturbations in large classes of reaction networks. This\nincludes multimolecular reactions and allows for catalysis, enzymatic\nreactions, multiple reaction products, nonmonotone rate functions, and\nnon-closed autonomous systems. Our structural sensitivity analysis is based on\nthe stoichiometry of the reaction network, only. It does not require numerical\ndata on reaction rates. Instead, we impose mild and generic nondegeneracy\nconditions of algebraic type. From the structural data, only, we derive which\nsteady-state concentrations are sensitive to, and hence influenced by, changes\nof any particular reaction rate - and which are not. We also establish\ntransitivity properties for influences involving rate perturbations. This\nallows us to derive an influence graph which globally summarizes the influence\npattern of the given network. The influence graph allows the computational, but\nmeaningful, automatic identification of functional subunits in general\nnetworks, which hierarchically influence each other. We illustrate our results\nfor several variants of the glycolytic citric acid cycle. Biological\napplications include enzyme knockout experiments, and metabolic control.\n", "  Three self-gravitating $SO(10)$ domain walls in five dimensions are obtained\nand their properties are analyzed. These non-abelian domain walls interpolate\nbetween AdS${}_5$ spacetimes with different embedding of $SU(5)$ in $SO(10)$\nand they can be distinguished, among other features, by the unbroken group on\neach wall, being either $SO(10)$, $SO(6)\\otimes SU(2)\\otimes U(1)/Z_2$ or\n$SU(4)\\otimes SO(2)\\otimes U(1)/Z_4$. We show that, unlike Minkowskian\nversions, the curved scenarios are perturbatively stable due to the\ngravitational capture of scalar fluctuations associated to the residual\northogonal subgroup in the core of the walls. These stabilizer modes are\nadditional to the four-dimensional Nambu-Goldstone states found in two of the\nthree gravitational sceanarios.\n", "  The epochs of reheating and preheating are studied in a simple extension of\nthe Starobinsky inflationary model, which consists of an $R^2$--correction to\nthe Einstein--Hilbert action and an additional scalar field. We find that if\nthe $R^2$--correction at the end of inflation is dynamically important, it\naffects the expansion rate and as a consequence the reheating and preheating\nprocesses. While we find that the reheating temperature and duration of\nreheating are only slightly affected, the effect has to be taken into account\nwhen comparing the theory to data. In the case of preheating, the gravitational\ncorrections can significantly affect the decay of the second field. Particle\nproduction is strongly affected for certain values of the parameters in the\ntheory.\n", "  Majorana bound states have been recently observed at the boundaries of\none-dimensional topological superconductors. Yet, controlling the localization\nof the Majorana states, which is essential to the realization of any\ntopological quantum device, is an ongoing challenge. To this end, we introduce\na mechanism which can break a topologically homogeneous state via the formation\nof topological domains, and which can be exploited to control the position of\nMajorana states. We found in fact that in the presence of amplitude-modulated\nfields, contiguous magnetic domains can become topologically inequivalent and,\nas a consequence, Majorana states can be pinned to the domain walls of the\nmagnetic structure. The formation of topological domains and the position of\nMajorana states can be externally controlled by tuning an applied field (e.g.,\nmagnetic or gate).\n", "  The thermalization of a strongly coupled plasma is examined in the\nholographic framework through non-local observables: the equal-time two-point\ncorrelation function of a large dimension boundary operator, and Wilson loops\nof different shapes. The evolution of the probes from an initial\nfar-from-equilibrium state to a hydrodynamic regime is found to depend on their\nsize. A hierarchy among the thermalization times of the energy density, the\npressures and the large size probes, is identified: the relaxation process is\nfaster at short distances.\n", "  We reevaluate the predictions of inflation regarding primordial gravity\nwaves, which should appear as B-modes in the CMB, in light of the fact that the\nstandard inflationary paradigm is unable to account for the transition from an\ninitially symmetric state into a non-symmetric outcome. We show that the\nincorporation of an element capable of explaining such a transition\ndramatically alters the prediction for the shape and size of the B-mode\nspectrum. In particular, we find that by adapting a realistic objective\ncollapse model to the situation at hand, the B-mode spectrum gets strongly\nsuppressed with respect to the standard prediction. We conclude that the\nfailure to detect B-modes in the CMB does not rule-out the simplest\ninflationary models.\n", "  Viscoelastic fluids exhibit elastic instabilities in simple shear flow and\nflow through curved streamlines. Surprisingly, we found in a porous medium such\nfluids show strikingly different hydrodynamic instabilities depicted by very\nlarge sideways excursions and presence of fast and slow moving lanes which have\nnot been reported before. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements through\na pillared microchannel, provide experimental evidence of such instabilities at\nvery low Reynolds number (< 0.01). We observe a transition from a symmetric\nlaminar to an asymmetric flow, which finally transforms to a nonlinear\naperiodic flow with strong lateral movements. The instability is characterized\nby a rapid increase in spatial and temporal fluctuations of velocity components\nand pressure at a critical Deborah number (De). Our experiments reveal the\npresence of a fascinating interplay between pore space and fluid rheology.\n", "  Several platforms are currently being explored for simulating physical\nsystems whose complexity increases faster than polynomially with the number of\nparticles or degrees of freedom in the system. Defects and vacancies in\nsemiconductors or dielectric materials, magnetic impurities embedded in solid\nhelium \\cite{lemeshko13}, atoms in optical lattices, photons, trapped ions and\nsuperconducting q-bits are among the candidates for predicting the behaviour of\nspin glasses, spin-liquids, and classical magnetism among other phenomena with\npractical technological applications. Here we investigate the potential of\npolariton graphs as an efficient simulator for finding the global minimum of\nthe $XY$ Hamiltonian. By imprinting polariton condensate lattices of bespoke\ngeometries we show that we can simulate a large variety of systems undergoing\nthe U(1) symmetry breaking transitions. We realise various magnetic phases,\nsuch as ferromagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, and frustrated spin configurations\non unit cells of various lattices: square, triangular, linear and a disordered\ngraph. Our results provide a route to study unconventional superfluids,\nspin-liquids, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, classical\nmagnetism among the many systems that are described by the $XY$ Hamiltonian.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate preservation of quantum coherence of a\nsingle-qubit interacting with a zero-temperature thermal reservoir through the\naddition of noninteracting qubits in the reservoir. Moreover, we extend this\nscheme to preserve quantum entanglement between two and three distant qubits,\neach of which interacts with a dissipative reservoir independently. At the long\ntime limit, we obtained analytical expressions for the coherence measure and\nthe concurrence of two and three qubits in terms of the number of additional\nqubits. It is observed that, by increasing the number of additional qubits in\neach reservoir, the initial coherence and the respective entanglements are\ncompletely protected in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes.\nInterestingly, the protection of entanglements occurs even under the\nindividually different behaviors of the reservoirs.\n", "  An elastoplastic theory is not volume conserved if it improperly sets an\narbitrary plastic strain rate tensor to be deviatoric. This paper discusses how\nto rigorously realize volume conservation in finite strain regime, especially\nwhen the unloading stress free configuration is not adopted or unique in the\nelastoplastic theories. An accurate condition of volume conservation is\nclarified and used in this paper that the density of a volume element after the\napplied loads are completely removed should be identical to that of the initial\nstress free states. For the elastoplastic theories that adopt the unloading\nstress free configuration (i.e. the intermediate configuration), the accurate\ncondition of volume conservation is satisfied only if specific definitions of\nthe plastic strain rate are used among many other different definitions. For\nthe elastoplastic theories that do not adopt the unloading stress free\nconfiguration, it is even more difficult to realize volume conservation as the\ninformation of the stress free state lacks. To find a universal approach of\nrealizing volume conservation for elastoplastic theories whether or not adopt\nthe unloading stress free configuration, we propose a single assumption that\nthe density of material only depends on the trace of the Cauchy stress, and\ninterestingly find that the zero trace of the plastic stress rate is equivalent\nto the accurate condition of volume conservation. Two strategies are further\nproposed to satisfy the accurate condition of volume conservation: directly and\nslightly revising the tangential stiffness tensor or using a properly chosen\nstress/strain measure and elastic compliance tensor. They are implemented into\nexisting elastoplastic theories, and the volume conservation is demonstrated by\nboth theoretical proof and numerical examples.\n", "  The strong interactions are charge independent. If we limit ourselves to the\nstrong interactions, we have the isospin $T$ as a good quantum number. Here we\nconsider the lack of level repulsion of states of different isospin and how\nthis effect manifests in nearest neighbor spacing (NNS) histograms, which\nprovide a visual and statistical context in which to study distributions of\nenergy level spacings. In particular, we study nucleons in the f-p model space\nfor the nucleus $^{44}$Ti. We also study the effect of the Coulomb interaction\non the level spacing distribution.\n", "  We compute entanglement entropy for free massive scalar fields in anti-de\nSitter (AdS) space. The entangling surface is a minimal surface whose boundary\nis a sphere at the boundary of AdS. The entropy can be evaluated from the\nthermal free energy of the fields on a topological black hole by using the\nreplica method. In odd-dimensional AdS, exact expressions of the Renyi entropy\n$S_n$ are obtained for arbitrary $n$. We also evaluate 1-loop corrections\ncoming from the scalar fields to holographic entanglement entropy. Applying the\nresults, we compute the leading difference of entanglement entropy between two\nholographic CFTs related by a renormalization group flow triggered by a double\ntrace deformation. The difference is proportional to the shift of a central\ncharge under the flow.\n", "  Whether there exist independent transverse electric (TE) and transverse\nmagnetic (TM) modes in a metallic waveguide filled with an anisotropic medium\nis a fundamental question in electromagnetics waveguide theory, but so far no\ndefinitive answers have been published. This paper establishes a necessary and\nsufficient condition for having independent TE and TM modes in a waveguide\nfilled with a homogeneous lossless anisotropic medium based on both waveguide\ntheory in electromagnetics and basic knowledge in mathematics. Moreover, for\nthe independent TE modes, we prove the propagation constants obtained from both\nthe longitudinal scalar magnetic field stimulation and the transverse vector\nelectric field stimulation are the same; for the independent TM modes, the\npropagation constants obtained from both the longitudinal scalar electric field\nstimulation and the transverse vector magnetic field stimulation are the same.\nThis necessary and sufficient condition is a new theoretical result in\nelectromagnetic waveguide theory, and is expected to be valuable for the design\nof waveguides filled with anisotropic media.\n", "  The PADME experiment, hosted at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, will\nsearch for a Dark Photon that decays in invisible channels with a mass up to\n$23.7\\,\\mbox{MeV}$ and coupling constant down to $10^{-3}$.\n", "  We study the richer structures of quasi-one-dimensional Bogoliubov-de Genes\ncollective excitations of F = 1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate in a harmonic\ntrap potential loaded in an optical lattice. Employing a perturbative method we\nreport general analytical expressions for the confined collective polar and\nferromagnetic Goldstone modes. In both cases the excited eigenfrequencies are\ngiven as function of the 1D effective coupling constants, trap frequency and\noptical lattice parameters. It is shown that the main contribution of the\noptical lattice laser intensity is to shift the confined phonon frequencies.\nMoreover, for high intensities, the excitation spectrum becomes independent of\nthe self-interaction parameters. We reveal some features of the evolution for\nthe Goldstone modes as well as the condensate densities from the ferromagnetic\nto the polar phases.\n", "  The six parameters of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model have best-fit values\nderived from the Planck temperature power spectrum that are shifted somewhat\nfrom the best-fit values derived from WMAP data. These shifts are driven by\nfeatures in the Planck temperature power spectrum at angular scales that had\nnever before been measured to cosmic-variance level precision. We investigate\nthese shifts to determine whether they are within the range of expectation and\nto understand their origin in the data. Taking our parameter set to be the\noptical depth of the reionized intergalactic medium $\\tau$, the baryon density\n$\\omega_{\\rm b}$, the matter density $\\omega_{\\rm m}$, the angular size of the\nsound horizon $\\theta_*$, the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum,\n$n_{\\rm s}$, and $A_{\\rm s}e^{-2\\tau}$ (where $A_{\\rm s}$ is the amplitude of\nthe primordial power spectrum), we examine the change in best-fit values\nbetween a WMAP-like large angular-scale data set (with multipole moment\n$\\ell<800$ in the Planck temperature power spectrum) and an all angular-scale\ndata set ($\\ell<2500$ Planck temperature power spectrum), each with a prior on\n$\\tau$ of $0.07\\pm0.02$. We find that the shifts, in units of the 1$\\sigma$\nexpected dispersion for each parameter, are $\\{\\Delta \\tau, \\Delta A_{\\rm s}\ne^{-2\\tau}, \\Delta n_{\\rm s}, \\Delta \\omega_{\\rm m}, \\Delta \\omega_{\\rm b},\n\\Delta \\theta_*\\} = \\{-1.7, -2.2, 1.2, -2.0, 1.1, 0.9\\}$, with a $\\chi^2$ value\nof 8.0. We find that this $\\chi^2$ value is exceeded in 15% of our simulated\ndata sets, and that a parameter deviates by more than 2.2$\\sigma$ in 9% of\nsimulated data sets, meaning that the shifts are not unusually large. Comparing\n$\\ell<800$ instead to $\\ell>800$, or splitting at a different multipole, yields\nsimilar results. We examine the $\\ell<800$ model residuals in the $\\ell>800$\npower spectrum data and find that the features there... [abridged]\n", "  This paper studies the time-averaged energy dissipation rate $\\langle\n\\varepsilon_{SMD} (u)\\rangle$ for the combination of the Smagorinsky model and\ndamping function. The Smagorinsky model is well known to over-damp. One common\ncorrection is to include damping functions that reduce the effects of model\nviscosity near walls. Mathematical analysis is given here that allows\nevaluation of $\\langle \\varepsilon_{SMD} (u)\\rangle $ for any damping function.\nMoreover, the analysis motivates a modified van Driest damping. It is proven\nthat the combination of the Smagorinsky with this modified damping function\ndoes not over dissipate and is also consistent with Kolmogorov phenomenology.\n", "  Nested multilayer mirrors are commonly used in X-ray telescope structures to\nincrease the collecting area. To balance the difficulty and cost of producing\nthese mirrors, the classical Wolter-I structure has previously been replaced\nwith a conical Wolter-I structure, but it can lead to significantly poorer\nangular resolution. In this paper, we consider changing one of the mirror\nshapes (paraboloid or hyperboloid) of the Wolter-I structure to a conical\nmirror shape, while the other mirror shape remains a quadric surface-type\nstructure, which could thus ensure the imaging quality. Based on a theoretical\nanalysis and the results of simulations, the cone-hyperboloid and\nparaboloid-cone structures are found to provide the best angular resolutions,\nand the cone-hyperboloid structure is shorter than the paraboloid-cone\nstructure at the focal length. The cone-hyperboloid structure is then nested to\nobtain the best on-axis angular resolution and off-axis images.\n", "  We describe the Mott dissociation of pions and kaons within a Beth-Uhlenbeck\napproach based on the PNJL model, which allows for a unified description of\nbound, resonant and scattering states. Within this model we evaluate the\ntemperature and chemical potential dependent modification of the phase shifts\nboth in the pseudoscalar and scalar isovector meson channels for $N_f=2+1$\nquark flavors. We show that the character change of the pseudoscalar bound\nstates to resonances in the continuum at the Mott transition temperature is\nsignaled by a jump of the phase shift at the threshold from $\\pi$ to zero, in\naccordance with the Levinson theorem. In particular, we demonstrate the\nimportance of accounting for the scattering continuum states, which ensures\nthat the total phase shift in each of the meson channels vanishes at high\nenergies, thus eliminating mesonic correlations from the thermodynamics at high\ntemperatures. In this way, we prove that the present approach provides a\nunified description of the transition from a meson gas to a quark-gluon plasma.\nWe discuss the occurrence of an anomalous mode for mesons composed of quarks\nwith unequal masses which is particularly pronounced for $K^+$ and $\\kappa^+$\nstates at finite densities a a possible mechanism to explain the \"horn\" effect\nfor the $K^+/\\pi^+$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  Super Efimov effect is a recently proposed three-body effect characterized by\na double-exponential scaling, which has not been observed experimentally yet.\nHere, we present the general dynamic equations determining the cloud size of a\nscale invariant quantum gas in a time dependent harmonic trap. We show that a\ndouble-log periodicity as the hallmark of the super Efimov effect emerges when\nthe trap frequency is decreased with a specially designed time-dependence. We\nalso demonstrate that this dynamic super Efimov effect can be realized with\nrealistic choices of parameters in current experiments.\n", "  We study the stability and the dynamics of many-soliton molecules in\ndispersion-managed (DM) optical fibers with focus on five-and seven-soliton\nmolecules by analytical and numerical means. In particular we calculate the\nbinding force, pulse durations and equilibrium separations using a variational\napproach. Predicted pulse shapes are in good agreement with those found by\nnumerical simulations of the underlying nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nWithin limitations soliton molecules with up to seven solitons possibly allow\nto encode three bits of data per clock period.\n", "  We discuss a generalisation of the Snyder model that includes all the\npossible deformations of the Heisenberg algebra compatible with Lorentz\ninvariance, in terms of realisations of the noncommutative geometry. The\ncorresponding deformed addition of momenta, the twist and the $R$-matrix are\ncalculated to first order in the deformation parameters for all models. In the\nparticular case of the Snyder realisation, the exact formula for the twist is\nobtained.\n", "  We report an abundance analysis for the highly r-process-enhanced (r-II) star\nCS 29497-004, a very metal-poor giant with Teff = 5013K and [Fe/H]=-2.85, whose\nnature was initially discovered in the course of the HERES project. Our\nanalysis is based on high signal-to-noise, high-resolution (R~75000) VLT/UVES\nspectra and MARCS model atmospheres under the assumption of local thermodynamic\nequilibrium, and obtains abundance measurements for a total of 46 elements, 31\nof which are neutron-capture elements. As is the case for the other 25 r-II\nstars currently known, the heavy-element abundance pattern of CS 29497-004\nwell-matches a scaled Solar System second peak r-process-element abundance\npattern. We confirm our previous detection of Th, and demonstrate that this\nstar does not exhibit an \"actinide boost\". Uranium is also detected (log e(U)\n=-2.20+/-0.30), albeit with a large measurement error that hampers its use as a\nprecision cosmo-chronometer. Combining the various elemental chronometer pairs\nthat are available for this star, we derive a mean age of 12.2+/-3.7 Gyr using\nthe theoretical production ratios from waiting-point approximation models\n(Kratz et al. 2007). We further explore the high-entropy wind model (Farouqi et\nal. 2010) production ratios arising from different neutron richness of the\nejecta (Y_e), and derive an age of 13.7+/-4.4 Gyr for a best-fitting Y_e=0.447.\nThe U/Th nuclei-chronometer is confirmed to be the most resilient to\ntheoretical production ratios and yields an age of 16.5+:-6.6 Gyr. Lead (Pb) is\nalso tentatively detected in CS 29497-004, at a level compatible with a scaled\nSolar r-process, or with the theoretical expectations for a pure r-process in\nthis star.\n", "  A visualization for dynamics of a qudit spin vector in a time-dependent\nmagnetic field is realized by means of mapping a solution for a spin vector on\nthe three-dimensional spherical curve (vector hodograph). The obtained results\nobviously display the quantum interference of precessional and nutational\neffects on the spin vector in the magnetic resonance. For any spin the bottom\nbounds of the quantum speed limit time (QSL) are found. It is shown that the\nbottom bound goes down when using multilevel spin systems. Under certain\nconditions the non-nil minimal time, which is necessary to achieve the\northogonal state from the initial one, is attained at spin S=2. An estimation\nof the product of two and three standard deviations of the spin components are\npresented. We discuss the dynamics of the mutual uncertainty, conditional\nuncertainty and conditional variance in terms of spin standard deviations. The\nstudy can find practical applications in the magnetic resonance, 3D\nvisualization of computational data and in designing of optimized information\nprocessing devices for quantum computation and communication.\n", "  Rotating domain wall based sensors that have recently been developed are\nbased on a segmented looping geometry. In order to determine the crucial\npinning of domain walls in this special geometry, we investigate the depinning\nunder different angles of an applied magnetic field and obtain the angular\ndependence of the depinning field of the domain walls. Due to the geometry, the\ndepinning field not only exhibits a 180$^\\circ$-periodicity but a more complex\ndependence on the angle. The depinning field depends on two different angles\nassociated with the initial state and the segmented geometry of the corner. We\nfind that depending on the angle of the applied field two different switching\nprocesses occur and we can reproduce the angular dependence using a simple\nmodel calculation.\n", "  We use a Raman four-wave mixing process to read-out light from atomic\ncoherence which is continuously written. The light is continuously generated\nafter an effective delay, allowing the atomic coherence to evolve during the\nprocess. Contrary to slow-light delay, which depends on the medium optical\ndepth, here the generation delay is determined solely by the intensive\nproperties of the system, approaching the atomic coherence lifetime at the weak\ndriving limit. The generated light is background free. We experimentally probe\nthese properties utilizing spatial diffusion as an 'internal clock' for the\natomic evolution time.\n", "  We introduce a generalized Dicke-like model to describe two-level systems\ncoupled with a single bosonic mode. In addition, the two-level systems mutually\ninteract via direct dipole-dipole interaction. We apply the model to an\nensemble of dye molecules coupled to a plasmonic excitation in a metallic\nnanoparticle and study how the dipole-dipole interaction and configurational\nrandomness introduced to the system affect the energy spectra. Comparing the\nsystem eigenenergies obtained by our model with the light spectra from a\nmultiple-scattering simulation, we suggest a way to identify dark modes in our\nmodel. Finally, we perform a parameter sweep in order to determine the scaling\nproperties of the system and to classify the regions of the parameter space\nwhere the dipole-dipole interactions can have significant effects.\n", "  As was shown in 1984 by Caneschi, Farrar, and Schwimmer, decomposing\nrepresentations of the supergroup SU(M|N), can give interesting anomaly-free\nsets of fermion representations of SU(M) x SU(N) x U(1). It is shown here that\nsuch groups can be used to construct realistic grand unified models with\nnon-abelian gauged family symmetries. A particularly simple three-family\nexample based on SU(5) x SU(2) x U(1) is studied. The forms of the mass\nmatrices, including that of the right-handed neutrinos, are determined in terms\nof SU(2) Clebsch coefficients; and the model is able to fit the lepton sector\nand predict the Dirac CP-violating phase of the neutrinos.. Models of this type\nwould have a rich phenomenology if part of the family symmetry is broken near\nthe electroweak scale.\n", "  Zero and normal modes for scalar and spinor fields in Kerr-anti de Sitter\nspacetime are studied as bound state problem with Dirichlet and Neumann\nboundary conditions. Zero mode is defined as the momentum near the horizon to\nbe zero: $p_{\\rm H}=\\omega-\\Omega_{\\rm H}m=0$, and is shown not to exist as\nphysical state for both scalar and spinor fields. Physical normal modes satisfy\nthe spectrum condition $p_{\\rm H}>0$ as a result of non-existence of zero mode\nand the analyticity with respect to rotation parameter $a$ of Kerr-anti de\nSitter black hole. Comments on the super-radiant modes and the thermodynamics\nof black hole are given in relation to the spectrum condition for normal modes.\nPreliminary numerical analysis on normal modes is presented.\n", "  Accurately determining dependency structure is critical to discovering a\nsystem's causal organization. We recently showed that the transfer entropy\nfails in a key aspect of this---measuring information flow---due to its\nconflation of dyadic and polyadic relationships. We extend this observation to\ndemonstrate that this is true of all such Shannon information measures when\nused to analyze multivariate dependencies. This has broad implications,\nparticularly when employing information to express the organization and\nmechanisms embedded in complex systems, including the burgeoning efforts to\ncombine complex network theory with information theory. Here, we do not suggest\nthat any aspect of information theory is wrong. Rather, the vast majority of\nits informational measures are simply inadequate for determining the meaningful\ndependency structure within joint probability distributions. Therefore, such\ninformation measures are inadequate for discovering intrinsic causal relations.\nWe close by demonstrating that such distributions exist across an arbitrary set\nof variables.\n", "  The $\\mu(I)$-rheology has been recently proposed as a potential candidate to\nmodel the flow of frictional grains in a dense inertial regime. However, this\nrheology was shown to be ill-posed in the mathematical sense for a large range\nof parameters, notably in the slow and fast flow limits \\citep{Barker2015}. In\nthis rapid communication, we extend the stability analysis to compressible\nflows. We show that compressibility regularizes mostly the equations, making\nthem well-posed for all parameters, at the condition that sufficient\ndissipation is associated with volume changes. In addition to the usual Coulomb\nshear friction coefficient $\\mu$, we introduce a bulk friction coefficient\n$\\mu_b$, associated to volume changes and show that the equations are\nwell-posed in two dimensions if $\\mu_b>2-2\\mu$ ($\\mu_b>3-7\\mu/2$ in three\ndimensions). Moreover, we show that the ill-posed domain defined in\n\\citep{Barker2015} transforms into a domain where the equations are unstable\nbut stay well-posed when compressibility is taken into account. These results\nsuggest thus the importance of compressibility in dense granular flows.\n", "  We introduce the idea that the electronic band structure of a charge density\nwave system may mimic the electronic structure of graphene. In that case a\nclass of materials quite different from graphene might be opened up to exploit\ngraphene's remarkable electronic properties. The theory of such materials,\nalong with superconductivity, is based on the material's dynamical, rather than\nits static, properties. The charge density wave system turns out to have a\nnumber of requirements: (1) a specific wave geometry simply related to\ngraphene; (2) a self-consistency among the electrons that requires the net\nCoulomb and phonon-mediated parts of the electron-electron interactions to be\nattractive. We develop a model that leads to an analytical expression for the\ntotal energy in terms of the effective electron mass $\\mu$, the electron\ndensity $\\rho_0$, and the strength $\\tilde{\\nu}_{K}$ of the net\nelectron-electron interaction. For constant $\\mu>0$ and $\\rho_0$, we examine\nthe limitations set upon $\\tilde{\\nu}_{K}$ by self-consistency, stability, and\nthe approximation in the electronic state calculation, and find them to be\nmutually compatible. This demonstrates the viability of our model.\n", "  The general Weyl -- Wigner formalism in finite dimensional phase spaces is\ninvestigated. Then this formalism is specified to the case of symmetric\nordering of operators in an odd -- dimensional Hilbert space. A respective\nWigner function on the discrete phase space is found and the limit, when the\ndimension of Hilbert space tends to infinity, is considered. It is shown that\nthis limit gives the number -- phase Wigner function in quantum optics.\nAnalogous results for the `almost' symmetric ordering in an even -- dimensional\nHilbert space are obtained. Relations between the discrete Wigner functions\nintroduced in our paper and some other discrete Wigner functions appearing in\nliterature are studied.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry breaking is related to the appearance of emergent\nphenomena, while a non-vanishing order parameter has been viewed as the sign of\nturning into such symmetry breaking phase. Recently, we have proposed a\ncontinuous measure of symmetry of a physical system using group theoretical\napproach. Within this framework, we study the spontaneous symmetry breaking in\nthe conventional superconductor and Bose-Einstein condensation by showing both\nthe two many body systems can be mapped into the many spin model. Moreover we\nalso formulate the underlying relation between the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking and the order parameter quantitatively. The degree of symmetry stays\nunity in the absence of the two emergent phenomena, while decreases\nexponentially at the appearance of the order parameter which indicates the\ninextricable relation between the spontaneous symmetry and the order parameter.\n", "  In one spatial dimension, anyons in the original description of Leinaas and\nMyrheim are formally equivalent to locally interacting bosons described by the\nLieb-Liniger model. This admits an interesting reinterpretation of interacting\nbosons in the context of anyons. We elaborate on this parallel, particularly\nincluding the many-body bound states from the attractive Lieb-Liniger model. In\nthe anyonic context these bound states are created purely by\nquantum-statistical attraction and coined quantum-statistical condensate, which\nis more robust than the Bose-Einstein condensate. We introduce the second\nquantization formalism for the present anyons and construct the generalized\nJordan-Wigner transformation that connects them to the bosons of the\nLieb-Liniger model.\n", "  The rotating saddle not only is an interesting system that is able to trap a\nball near its saddle point, but can also intuitively illustrate the operating\nprinciples of quadrupole ion traps in modern physics. Unlike the conventional\nmodels based on the mass-point approximation, we study the stability of a ball\nin a rotating-saddle trap using rigid-body dynamics. The stabilization\ncondition of the system is theoretically derived and subsequently verified by\nexperiments. The results are compared with the previous mass-point model,\ngiving large discrepancy as the curvature of the ball is comparable to that of\nthe saddle. We also point out that the spin angular velocity of the ball is\nanalogous to the cyclotron frequency of ions in an external magnetic field\nutilized in many prevailing ion-trapping schemes.\n", "  We investigate a quantum many-body system with particles moving on a circle\nand subject to two-body and three-body potentials. In this new class of models,\nthat extrapolates from the celebrated Calogero-Sutherland model and a system\nwith interactions among nearest and next-to-nearest neighbors, the interactions\ncan be tuned as a function of range. We determine the exact ground state energy\nand wavefunction and obtain a part of the excitation spectrum.\n", "  The diameter of the apparent horizon, defined by the distance between\nfurthest points on the horizon, in spacetimes with a positive cosmological\nconstant $\\varLambda$ has been investigated. It is established that the\ndiameter of the apparent horizon on the totally umbilic partial Cauchy surface\ncannot exceed $2\\pi/\\sqrt{3\\varLambda}$. Then, it is argued that arbitrarily\nlong black strings cannot be formed in our universe.\n", "  The statistical properties of infrequent particle displacements, greater than\na certain distance, is known as jump dynamics in the context of structural\nglass formers. We generalize the concept of jump to the case of a spin glass,\nby dividing the system in small boxes, and considering infrequent cooperative\nspin flips in each box. Jumps defined this way share similarities with jumps in\nstructural glasses. We perform numerical simulations for the 3D\nEdwards-Anderson model, and study how the properties of these jumps depend on\nthe waiting time after a quench. Similar to the results for structural glasses,\nwe find that while jump frequency depends strongly on time, jump duration and\njump length are roughly stationary. At odds with some results reported on\nstudies of structural glass formers, at long enough times, the rest time\nbetween jumps varies as the inverse of jump frequency. We give a possible\nexplanation for this discrepancy. We also find that our results are\nqualitatively reproduced by a fully-connected trap model.\n", "  Strongly interacting solitons confined to an optical resonator would offer\nunique capabilities for experiments in communication, computation, and sensing\nwith light. Here we report on the discovery of soliton crystals in monolithic\nKerr microresonators-spontaneously and collectively ordered ensembles of\nco-propagating solitons whose interactions discretize their allowed temporal\nseparations. We unambiguously identify and characterize soliton crystals\nthrough analysis of their 'fingerprint' optical spectra, which arise from\nspectral interference between the solitons. We identify a rich space of soliton\ncrystals exhibiting crystallographic defects, and time-domain measurements\ndirectly confirm our inference of their crystal structure. The crystallization\nwe observe is explained by long-range soliton interactions mediated by\nresonator mode degeneracies, and we probe the qualitative difference between\nsoliton crystals and a soliton liquid that forms in the absence of these\ninteractions. Our work explores the rich physics of monolithic Kerr resonators\nin a new regime of dense soliton occupation and offers a way to greatly\nincrease the efficiency of Kerr combs; further, the extreme degeneracy of the\nconfiguration space of soliton crystals suggests an implementation for a robust\non-chip optical buffer.\n", "  We propose and examine a new high-density composite of $\\Lambda^* \\equiv K^-p\n= (s \\bar{u}) \\otimes (uud)$, which may be called {\\it Kaonic Proton Matter\n(KPM)}, or simply, {\\it $\\Lambda^* $-Matter}, where substantial shrinkage of\nbaryonic bound systems originating from the strong attraction of the\n$(\\bar{K}N)^{I=0}$ interaction takes place, providing a ground-state neutral\nbaryonic system with a huge energy gap. The mass of an ensemble of $(K^-p)_m$,\nwhere $m$, the number of the $K^-p$ pair, is larger than $m \\approx 10$, is\npredicted to drop down below its corresponding neutron ensemble, $(n)_m$, since\nthe attractive interaction is further increased by the Heitler-London type\nmolecular covalency, as well as by chiral symmetry restoration of the QCD\nvacuum. Since the seed clusters ($K^-p$, $K^-pp$ and $K^-K^-pp$) are\nshort-lived, the formation of such a stabilized relic ensemble, $(K^-p)_m$, may\nbe conceived during the Big-Bang Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) period in the early\nuniverse before the hadronization and $quark$-$anti$-$quark$ annihilation\nproceed. At the final stage of baryogenesis a substantial amount of primordial\n($\\bar{u},\\bar{d}$)'s are transferred and captured into {\\it KPM}, where the\nanti-quarks find places to survive forever. The expected {\\it KPM} state may be\n{\\it cold, dense and neutral $\\bar{q} q$-hybrid ({\\it Quark Gluon Bound (QGB)})\nstates, $[s(\\bar{u} \\otimes u) ud]_m$,} to which the relic of the disappearing\nanti-quarks plays an essential role as hidden components. The {\\it KPM} may\nalso be produced during the formation and decay of neutron stars.\n", "  The scope of this article is to review the state-of-the-art in the field of\nconfined electron systems generated at the bare surfaces of transition metal\noxides (TMOs). This scientific field is a prime example of a domain where\ntwo-dimensional physics and photoemission-based spectroscopic techniques have\ntogether set up the development of the story. The discovery of a high-mobility\ntwo-dimensional electron system (2DES) at interfaces of transition metal oxides\nhas attracted an immense scientific interest due to new opportunities opened in\nthe emerging field of oxide electronics. The subsequent paradigm shift from\ninterfaces to the bare surfaces of TMOs made the confined electron system\naccessible to surface-sensitive spectroscopic techniques and this new era is\nthe focus of the present article. We describe how results by means of\nAngle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) establish the presence of\nconfined electron carriers at the bare surface of SrTiO$_{3}$(100), which\nexhibit complex physics phenomena such as orbital ordering, electron-phonon\ninteractions and spin splitting. The key element behind the 2DES generation is\noxygen vacancies. Moreover, we review the experimental evidence on the\ngeneration of 2DESs on surfaces with different orientation, as well as on\ndifferent TMO substrates. The electronic structure of the confined electron\nsystem responds to such changes, thereby providing external means for\nengineering its properties. Finally, we identify new directions for future\nresearch by introducing a device-friendly fabrication protocol for the\ngeneration of 2DESs on TMO surfaces.\n", "  Low-energy electronic recoil caused by solar neutrinos in multi-ton xenon\ndetectors is an important subject not only because it is a source of the\nirreducible background for direct searches of weakly-interacting massive\nparticles (WIMPs), but also because it provides a viable way to measure the\nsolar $pp$ and $^{7}\\textrm{Be}$ neutrinos at the precision level of current\nstandard solar model predictions. In this work we perform $\\textit{ab initio}$\nmany-body calculations for the structure, photoionization, and\nneutrino-ionization of xenon. It is found that the atomic binding effect yields\na sizable suppression to the neutrino-electron scattering cross section at low\nrecoil energies. Compared with the previous calculation based on the free\nelectron picture, our calculated event rate of electronic recoil in the same\ndetector configuration is reduced by about $25\\%$. We present in this paper the\nelectronic recoil rate spectrum in the energy window of 100 eV - 30 keV with\nthe standard per ton per year normalization for xenon detectors, and discuss\nits implication for low energy solar neutrino detection (as the signal) and\nWIMP search (as a source of background).\n", "  We calculate new corrections to the Brane-world dynamics, lying in a 5D\nSchwarzschild-De Sitter black hole, generalizing the result of Nojiri, Odintsov\nand Ogushi (NOO) in Ref.\\cite{Nojiri:2002vu}, The NOO entropy effect is based\non the Logharitmic correction to the bulk entropy firstly calculated by\nMukherji and Pal in Ref.\\cite{Mukherji:2002de}. We calculate higher order\ncontributions to the brane worldsheet. The extra terms obtained lead to\ninteresting implications in brane-cosmology. In particular, new entropic terms\nrapidly disappear in the late Universe while exploding in the very Early\nUniverse. In particular, we show that they may trigger a cosmological bounce in\nthe very early Universe. On the other hand, they contribute to the cosmological\nexpansion in the Late Universe. We also discuss a scenario in which the BLK\nanisotropies are washed-out, toward a new Ekpyrotic Brane Cosmology.\n", "  A manifestly covariant, or geometric, field theory for relativistic classical\nparticle-field system is developed. The connection between space-time symmetry\nand energy-momentum conservation laws for the system is established\ngeometrically without splitting the space and time coordinates, i.e.,\nspace-time is treated as one identity without choosing a coordinate system. To\nachieve this goal, we need to overcome two difficulties. The first difficulty\narises from the fact that particles and field reside on different manifold. As\na result, the geometric Lagrangian density of the system is a function of the\n4-potential of electromagnetic fields and also a functional of particles'\nworld-lines. The other difficulty associated with the geometric setting is due\nto the mass-shell condition. The standard Euler-Lagrange (EL) equation for a\nparticle is generalized into the geometric EL equation when the mass-shell\ncondition is imposed. For the particle-field system, the geometric EL equation\nis further generalized into a weak geometric EL equation for particles. With\nthe EL equation for field and the geometric weak EL equation for particles,\nsymmetries and conservation laws can be established geometrically. A geometric\nexpression for the energy-momentum tensor for particles is derived for the\nfirst time, which recovers the non-geometric form in the existing literature\nfor a chosen coordinate system.\n", "  We study probabilities of various rare events for the limiting point process\nthat appears at the random matrix hard edge. We also show a transition from\nhard edge to bulk behavior. Asymptotic events studied include a central limit\ntheorem and large deviation result for the number of points in a growing\ninterval $[0,\\lambda]$ as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. We study these results for the\nsquare root of the hard edge process. In this setting many of these behaviors\nmimic those of the Sine$_\\beta$ process.\n", "  The Prisoner's Dilemma Process on a graph $G$ is an iterative process where\neach vertex, with a fixed strategy (cooperate or defect), plays the game with\neach of its neighbours. At the end of a round each vertex may change its\nstrategy to that of its neighbour with the highest pay-off. Here we study the\nspread of cooperative and selfish behaviours on a toroidal grid, where each\nvertex is initially a cooperator with probability $p$. When vertices are\npermitted to change their strategies via a randomized asynchronous update\nscheme, we find that for some values of $p$ the limiting density of cooperators\nmay be modelled as a polynomial in $p$. Theoretical bounds for this density are\nconfirmed via simulation.\n", "  A discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) is proposed to probe the Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability (RTI) in two-component compressible flows. Each species has a\nflexible specific heat ratio and is described by one discrete Boltzmann\nequation (DBE). Independent discrete velocities are adopted for the two DBEs.\nThe collision and force terms in the DBE account for the molecular collision\nand external force, respectively. Two types of force terms are exploited. In\naddition to recovering the modified Navier-Stokes equations in the hydrodynamic\nlimit, the DBM has the capability of capturing detailed nonequilibrium effects.\nFurthermore, we use the DBM to investigate the dynamic process of the RTI. The\ninvariants of tensors for nonequilibrium effects are presented and studied. For\nlow Reynolds numbers, both global nonequilibrium manifestations and the growth\nrate of the entropy of mixing show three stages (i.e., the reducing,\nincreasing, and then decreasing trends) in the evolution of the RTI. On the\nother hand, the early reducing tendency is suppressed and even eliminated for\nhigh Reynolds numbers. Relevant physical mechanisms are analyzed and discussed.\n", "  Enhanced van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy of semiconductors on layered vdW\nsubstrate is identified as the formation of dative bonds. For example, despite\nthat NbSe2 is a vdW layered material, first-principles calculations reveal that\nthe bond strength at CdTe-NbSe2 interface is five times as large as that of vdW\ninteraction at CdTe-graphene interface. The unconventional chemistry here is\nenabled by an effective net electron transfer from Cd dangling-bond states at\nCdTe surface to metallic non-bonding NbSe2 states, which is a necessary\ncondition to activate the Cd for enhanced binding with Se.\n", "  Recently a number of diatomic and polyatomics molecules has been identified\nas a prospective systems for Doppler/Sisyphus cooling. Doppler/Sisyphus cooling\nallows to decrease the kinetic energy of molecules down to microkelvin\ntemperatures with high efficiency and then capture them to molecular traps,\nincluding magneto-optical trap. Trapped molecules can be used for creation of\nmolecular fountains and/or performing controlled chemical reactions,\nhigh-precision spectra measurements and a multitude of other applications.\nPolyatomic molecules with heavy nuclei present considerable interest for the\nsearch for \"new physics\" outside of Standard Model and other applications\nincluding cold chemistry, photochemistry, quantum informatics etc. Herein we\nwould like to attract attention to radium monohydroxide molecule (RaOH) which\nis on the one hand an amenable object for laser cooling and on the other hand\nprovides extensive possibilities for searching for P-odd and P,T-odd effects.\nAt the moment RaOH is the heaviest polyatomic molecule proposed for direct\ncooling with lasers.\n", "  The lecture presents an overview of the quest for the new physics in low\nenergy neutron phenomena. In addition to the traditional topics the quantum\ndamping of $n$ $\\bar{n}$ oscillations is discussed.\n", "  We compute asymptotic symmetry algebras of conformal gravity. Due to more\ngeneral boundary conditions allowed in conformal gravity in comparison to those\nin Einstein gravity, we can classify the corresponding algebras. The highest\nalgebra for non-trivial boundary conditions is five dimensional and it leads to\nglobal geon solution with non-vanishing charges.\n", "  The effect of conformational fluctuations of modular macromolecules, such as\nenzymes, on their diffusion properties is addressed using a simple generic\nmodel of an asymmetric dumbbell made of two hydrodynamically coupled subunits.\nIt is shown that equilibrium fluctuations can lead to an interplay between the\ninternal and the external degrees of freedom and give rise to negative\ncontributions to the overall diffusion coefficient. Considering that this model\nenzyme explores a mechanochemical cycle, we show how substrate binding and\nunbinding affects its internal fluctuations, and how this can result in an\nenhancement of the overall diffusion coefficient of the molecule. These\ntheoretical predictions are successfully confronted with recent measurements of\nenzyme diffusion in dilute conditions using fluorescence correlation\nspectroscopy.\n", "  In this paper, we first study mutual information of excited states in the\nsmall subsystem size limit in generic conformal field theory. We then discuss\nrelative entropy of two disjoint subsystems in the same limit.\n", "  The static region outside the event horizon of an asymptotically anti de\nSitter black hole has a conformal timelike boundary $\\mathscr{I}$ on which\nboundary conditions have to be imposed for the evolution of linear fields from\ninitial data to be a well posed problem. Only homogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann or\nRobin conditions preserve the action of the background isometry group on the\nsolution space. We study the case in which the modal decomposition of the\nlinear field leads to potentials not diverging at the conformal timelike\nboundary. We prove that there is always an instability if Robin boundary\nconditions with large enough $\\gamma$ (the quotient between the values of the\nderivative of the field and the field at the boundary) are allowed. We explain\nthe origin of this instability, show that for modes with nonnegative potentials\nthere is a single unstable state and prove a number of properties of this\nstate. Although our results apply in general to 1+1 wave equations on a half\ninfinite domain with a potential that is not singular at the boundary, our\nmotivation is to analyze the gravitational stability of the four dimensional\nSchwarzschild anti de Sitter black holes (SAdS${}_4$) in the context of the\nblack hole non modal linear stability program initiated in Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\\n{\\bf 112}, 191101 (2014), and the related supersymmetric type of duality\nexchanging odd and even modes. We prove that this symmetry is broken except\nwhen a combination of Dirichlet conditions in the even sector and a particular\nRobin condition in the odd sector is enforced, or viceversa, and that only the\nfirst of these two choices leads to a stable dynamics.\n", "  We consider a class of planar tree-level four-point functions in N=4 SYM in a\nspecial kinematic regime: one BMN operator with two scalar excitations and\nthree half-BPS operators are put onto a line in configuration space;\nadditionally, for the half-BPS operators a co-moving frame is chosen in flavour\nspace. In configuration space, the four-punctured sphere is naturally\ntriangulated by tree-level planar diagrams. We demonstrate on a number of\nexamples that each tile can be associated with a modified hexagon form-factor\nin such a way as to efficiently reproduce the tree-level four-point function.\nOur tessellation is not of the OPE type, fostering the hope of finding an\nindependent, integrability-based approach to the computation of planar\nfour-point functions.\n", "  As radiofrequency filtering plays a vital role in electromagnetic devices and\nsystems, recently photonic techniques have been intensively studied to\nimplement radiofrequency filters to harness wide frequency coverage, large\ninstantaneous bandwidth, low frequency-dependent loss, flexible tunability and\nstrong immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, one crucial challenge\nfacing the photonic radiofrequency filter (PRF) is the less impressive\nout-of-band rejection. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate a\ntunable PRF with a record out-of-band rejection of 80 dB, which is 3 dB higher\nthan the maximum value (~77 dB) reported so far, when incorporating highly\nselective polarization control and large narrow-band amplification enabled by\nstimulated Brillouin scattering effect. In particular, this record rejection is\narduous to be achieved for a narrow passband (e.g., a few megahertz) and a high\nfinesse in a PRF. Moreover, the proposed PRF is an active one capable of\nproviding negligible insertion loss and even signal gain. Tunable central\nfrequency ranging from 2.1 to 6.1 GHz is also demonstrated. The proposed PRF\nwill provide an ultra-high noise or clutter suppression for harsh\nelectromagnetic scenarios, particularly when room-temperature implementation\nand remote distribution are needed.\n", "  Unsteady inviscid flow models of wings and airfoils have been developed to\nstudy the aerodynamics of natural and man-made flyers. Vortex methods have been\nextensively applied to reduce the dimensionality of these aerodynamic models,\nbased on the proper estimation of the strength and distribution of the vortices\nin the wake. In such modeling approaches, one of the most fundamental questions\nis how the vortex sheets are generated and released from sharp edges. To\ndetermine the formation of the trailing-edge vortex sheet, the classical Kutta\ncondition can be extended to unsteady situations by realizing that a flow\ncannot turn abruptly around a sharp edge. This condition can be readily applied\nto a flat plate or an airfoil with cusped trailing edge since the direction of\nthe forming vortex sheet is known to be tangential to the trailing edge.\nHowever, for a finite-angle trailing edge, or in the case of flow separation\naway from a sharp corner, the direction of the forming vortex sheet is\nambiguous. To remove any ad-hoc implementation, the unsteady Kutta condition,\nthe conservation of circulation, as well as the conservation laws of mass and\nmomentum are coupled to analytically solve for the angle, strength, and\nrelative velocity of the trailing-edge vortex sheet. The two-dimensional\naerodynamic model together with the proposed vortex-sheet formation condition\nis verified by comparing flow structures and force calculations with\nexperimental results for airfoils in steady and unsteady background flows.\n", "  It has recently been proposed, by assuming that dark matter is a superfluid,\nthat MOND-like effects can be achieved on small scales whilst preserving the\nsuccess of $\\Lambda$CDM on large scales. Here we aim to provide the first set\nof spherical models of galaxy clusters in the context of superfluid dark\nmatter. We first outline the theoretical structure of the superfluid core and\nthe surrounding \"normal phase\" dark halo of quasi-particles in thermal\nequlibrium. The latter should encompass the largest part of galaxy clusters.\nHere, we set the SfDM transition at the radius where the density and pressure\nof the superfluid and normal phase coincides, neglecting the effect of phonons\nin the suprefluid core. We then apply the theory to a sample of galaxy\nclusters, and directly compare the SfDM predicted mass profiles to data. We\nfind that the superfluid formulation can reproduce the X-ray dynamical mass\nprofile of clusters. The SfDM fits however display slight under-predictions of\nthe gravity in the central regions which might be partly related to our\nneglecting of the effect of phonons in these regions. We conclude that this\nsuperfluid formulation is successful in describing galaxy clusters, but further\nwork will be needed to determine whether the parameter choice is consistent\nwith galaxies. Our model could be made more realistic by exploring\nnon-sphericity and the SfDM transition condition we impose.\n", "  We build a holographic model for the pairing fluctuation pseudogap phase in\nfermionic high temperature superconductivity/superfluidity based on the BCS-BEC\ncrossover scenario. The pseudogap originates from incoherent Cooper pairing and\nhas been observed in recent cold atom experiments. The strength of Cooper\npairing and hence the BCS-BEC crossover is controlled by an effective 4-Fermi\ninteraction and we argue that the double-trace deformation for charged scalar\noperator is a close analog in large N field theories. We employ the\ndouble-trace deformed Abelian Higgs model of holographic superconductors and\npropose that the incoherent fluctuations of the charged scalar in the bulk is\nthe holographic dual of the fluctuating Cooper pairs. Using a Madelung\ntransformation and the velocity-potential formalism, we develop a quantum fluid\ndynamics as an effective theory for these bulk fluctuations. The new fluid\ndynamics takes care of the boundary conditions required by AdS/CFT and encodes\nthe vacuum polarization effect in curved spacetime. The pseudogap in\nconductivity can be related to the plasma oscillation of this bulk fluid.\n", "  Cytoskeletal motors known as motor proteins are molecules that drive cellular\ntransport along several parallel cytoskeletal filaments and support many\nbiological processes. Experimental evidences suggest that they interact with\nthe nearest molecules of their filament while performing mechanical work. To\nunderstand such mechanism theoretically, a new version of two-channel totally\nasymmetric simple exclusion process which incorporates interactions in a\nthermodynamically consistent way, is introduced. As the existing approaches for\nmulti-channel systems deviate from analyzing the effect of inter and intra\nchannel interactions, a new approach known as modified vertical cluster mean\nfield is developed. The approach along with monte-carlo simulations\nsuccessfully encounters some correlations and computes all complex dynamic\nproperties of the system. Role of symmetry of interactions and inter-channel\ncoupling is observed on triple points and particle maximal current.\nSurprisingly, for each coupling rate and most of the interaction splittings,\nthere corresponds an optimal interaction strength for the maximal current which\nbelongs to the case of weak repulsive interactions. Moreover, for a fixed\ninteraction splitting, as coupling rate increases, the optimal strength\ndecreases and tends towards the experimental predictions. Correlations are\nfound to be short-range and weaker for repulsive and weak attractive\ninteractions, while for stronger attractions they are long-range and stronger.\nAll these findings are also discussed in the context of experimental\nobservations.\n", "  The single-parameter scaling hypothesis relating the average and variance of\nthe logarithm of the conductance is a pillar of the theory of electronic\ntransport. We use a maximum-entropy ansatz to explore the logarithm of the\nenergy density, $\\ln {\\cal W}(x)$, at a depth $x$ into a random one-dimensional\nsystem. Single-parameter scaling would be the special case in which $x=L$ (the\nsystem length). We find the result, confirmed in microwave measurements and\ncomputer simulations, that the average of $\\ln {\\cal W}(x)$ is independent of\n$L$ and equal to $-x/\\ell$, with $\\ell$ the mean free path. At the beginning of\nthe sample, ${\\rm var}[\\ln {\\cal W}(x)]$ rises linearly with $x$ and is also\nindependent of $L$, with a sublinear increase near the sample output. At $x=L$\nwe find a correction to the value of ${\\rm var}[\\ln T]$ predicted by\nsingle-parameter scaling.\n", "  We investigate the stability and critical velocity of a weakly interacting\nBose gas flowing in a random potential. By applying the Bogoliubov theory to a\ndisordered Bose system with a steady flow, the condensate density and the\nsuperfluid density are determined as functions of the disorder strength, flow\nvelocity, and temperature. The critical velocity, at which the steady flow\nbecomes unstable, is calculated from the spectrum of hydrodynamic excitation.\nWe also show that in two dimensions the critical velocity strongly depends on\nthe system size.\n", "  We analyze the extended superfluid density data of Bo\\v{z}ovi\\'{c} \\textit{\net al}. taken on homogenous thin films to explore the critical properties of\nthe thermal (TSM) and quantum superconductor to metal (QSM) transitions in\noverdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$. The temperature dependence reveals\nremarkable agreement with d-wave BCS behavior, where $\\sigma \\propto 1/\\lambda\n^{2}$. No sign of the expected KTB transition is observable. We show that the\ncritical amplitude $\\rho_{s0}=\\rho_{s}\\left( T\\right) /\\left( 1-T/T_{c}\\right)\n$ scales as $T_{c}\\propto \\rho_{s0}^{1/2}$ and with that as $T_{c}\\propto\n\\rho_{s}\\left( 0\\right) $, empirically verified by Bo\\v{z}ovi\\'{c} \\textit{et\nal}. Together with additional evidence for BCS behavior in overdoped\nLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ we show that the scaling relation $T_{c}\\propto\n\\lambda \\left( 0\\right) ^{-1}\\propto \\Delta \\left( 0\\right) \\propto \\xi \\left(\n0\\right) ^{-1}\\propto H_{c2}\\left( 0\\right) ^{-1/2}\\propto\n\\lambda_{0}^{-1}\\propto \\Delta_{0}\\propto \\xi_{0}^{-1}\\propto H_{c20}^{-1/2}$\napplies, by approaching the QSM and TSM transitions. This differs from the\ndirty limit behavior $\\lambda \\left( 0\\right) \\propto \\xi \\left( 0\\right)\n^{1/2}$, maintains the $T_{c}$ \\ independence of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter\n$\\kappa =\\lambda_{o}/\\xi_{0}$, and puts a stringent constraint on the effect at\nwork. We notice that potential candidates appear to be the nonlocal effects on\nthe penetration depth of clean d-wave superconductors explored by Kosztin and\nLegget.\n", "  In this paper we investigate, using theory and Direct Numerical Simulations\n(DNS), the Forward In Time (FIT) and Backward In Time (BIT) Probability Density\nFunctions (PDFs) of the separation of inertial particle-pairs in isotropic\nturbulence. In agreement with our earlier study (Bragg et al., Phys. Fluids 28,\n013305 (2016)), where we compared the FIT and BIT mean-square separations, we\nfind that inertial particles separate much faster BIT than FIT, with the\nstrength of the irreversibility depending upon the final/initial separation of\nthe particle-pair and their Stokes number $St$. However, we also find that the\nirreversibility shows up in subtle ways in the behavior of the full PDF that it\ndoes not in the mean-square separation. In the theory, we derive new\npredictions, including a prediction for the BIT/FIT PDF for ${St\\geq O(1)}$,\nand for final/initial separations in the dissipation regime. The prediction\nshows how caustics in the particle relative velocities in the dissipation range\naffect the scaling of the pair-separation PDF, leading to a PDF with an\nalgebraically decaying tail. The predicted functional behavior of the PDFs is\nuniversal, in that it does not depend upon the level of intermittency in the\nunderlying turbulence. We also analyze the pair-separation PDFs for fluid\nparticles at short-times, and construct theoretical predictions using the\nmultifractal formalism to describe the fluid relative velocity distributions.\nThe theoretical and numerical results both suggest that the extreme events in\nthe inertial particle-pair dispersion at the small-scales are dominated by\ntheir non-local interaction with the turbulent velocity field, rather than due\nto the strong dissipation range intermittency of the turbulence itself...\n", "  We develop an operator splitting method to simulate flows of isothermal\ncompressible natural gas over transmission pipelines. The method solves a\nsystem of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) of\nhydrodynamic type for mass flow and pressure on a metric graph, where turbulent\nlosses of momentum are modeled by phenomenological Darcy-Weisbach friction.\nMass flow balance is maintained through the boundary conditions at the network\nnodes, where natural gas is injected or withdrawn from the system. Gas flow\nthrough the network is controlled by compressors boosting pressure at the inlet\nof the adjoint pipe. Our operator splitting numerical scheme is unconditionally\nstable and it is second order accurate in space and time. The scheme is\nexplicit, and it is formulated to work with general networks with loops. We\ntest the scheme over range of regimes and network configurations, also\ncomparing its performance with performance of two other state of the art\nimplicit schemes.\n", "  Entanglement generated from polar molecules of two-dimensional rotation is\ninvestigated in a static electric field. The electric field modulates the\nrotational properties of molecules, leading to distinctive entanglement. The\nconcurrence is used to estimate the degree of entanglement. When the electric\nfield is applied parallel or perpendicular to the intermolecular direction, the\nconcurrences reveal two overlapping features. Such a pronounced signature\ncorresponds to the coexistence of all Bell-like states. The characteristics of\nBell-like states and overlapping concurrences are kept independent of the\nmodulation of dipole-field and dipole-dipole interactions. On the contrary, the\nBell-like states fail to coexist in other field directions, reflecting\nnonoverlapping concurrences. Furthermore, the thermal effect on the\nentanglement is analyzed for the Bell-like states. Dissimilar suppressed\nconcurrences occur due to different energy structures for the two specific\nfield directions.\n", "  We propose iterative inversion algorithms for weighted Radon transforms $R_W$\nalong hyperplanes in $R^3$. More precisely, expandingthe weight $W = W (x,\n\\theta), x \\in R^3 , \\theta \\in S^2$ , into the series of spherical harmonics\nin $\\theta$ and assuming that the zero order term $w_{0,0}(x)$ is not zero at\nany $x \\in R^3$ , we reduce the inversion of $R_W$ to solving a linear integral\nequation. In addition, under the assumption that the even part of $W$ in\n$\\theta$ (i.e., $1/2(W (x, \\theta) + W (x, -\\theta))$) is close to $w_{0,0}$,\nthe aforementioned linear integral equation can be solved by the method of\nsuccessive approximations. Approximate inversions of $R_W$ are also given. Our\nresults can be considered as an extension to 3D of two-dimensional results of\nKunyansky (1992), Novikov (2014), Guillement, Novikov (2014). In our studies we\nare motivated, in particular, by problems of emission tomographies in 3D. In\naddition, we generalize our results to the case of dimension $n > 3$.\n", "  The dependence of the light and charge yield of liquid xenon on the applied\nelectric field and recoil energy is important for dark matter detectors using\nliquid xenon time projections chambers. Few measurements have been made of this\nfield dependence at recoil energies less than 10 keV. In this paper we present\nresults of such measurements using a specialized detector. Recoil energies are\ndetermined via the Compton coincidence technique at four drift fields relevant\nfor liquid xenon dark matter detectors: 0.19, 0.48, 1.02, and 2.32 kV/cm. Mean\nrecoil energies down to 1 keV were measured with unprecedented precision. We\nfind that the charge and light yield are anti-correlated above 3 keV, and that\nthe field dependence becomes negligible below 6 keV. However, below 3 keV we\nfind a charge yield significantly higher than expectation and a reconstructed\nenergy deviating from linearity.\n", "  The polaron model of H. Fr\\\"ohlich describes an electron coupled to the\nquantized longitudinal optical modes of a polar crystal. In the strong-coupling\nlimit one expects that the phonon modes may be treated classically, which leads\nto a coupled Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson system with memory. For the effective\ndynamics of the electron this amounts to a nonlinear and non-local\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. We use the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle to\nderive the Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson system from the Fr\\\"ohlich model and we\npresent new results on the accuracy of their solutions for describing the\nmotion of Fr\\\"ohlich polarons in the strong-coupling limit. Our main result\nextends to $N$-polaron systems.\n", "  The method of large spin perturbation theory allows to analyse conformal\nfield theories (CFT) by turning the crossing equations into an algebraic\nproblem. We apply this method to a generic CFT with weakly broken higher spin\n(HS) symmetry, to the first non-trivial order in the breaking parameter. We\nshow that the spectrum of broken currents, for any value of the spin, follows\nfrom crossing symmetry. After discussing a generic model of a single scalar\nfield, we focus on vector models with $O(N)$ global symmetry. We rediscover the\nspectrum of several models, including the $O(N)$ Wilson-Fisher model around\nfour dimensions, the large $O(N)$ model in $2<d<4$ and cubic models around six\ndimensions, not necessarily unitary. We also discuss models where the\nfundamental field is not part of the spectrum. Examples of this are weakly\ncoupled gauge theories and our method gives an on-shell gauge invariant way to\nstudy them. At first order in the coupling constant we show that again the\nspectrum follows from crossing symmetry, to all values of the spin. Our method\nprovides an alternative to usual perturbation theory without any reference to a\nLagrangian.\n", "  The subwavelength mode volumes of plasmonic filters are well matched to the\nsmall size of state-of-the-art active pixels (~ 1 {\\mu}m) in CMOS image sensor\narrays used in portable electronic devices. Typical plasmonic filters exhibit\nbroad (> 100 nm) transmission bandwidths. Dramatically reducing the peak width\nof filter transmission spectra would allow for the realization of CMOS\nhyperspectral imaging arrays, which demand the FWHM of transmission peaks to be\nless than 30 nm. We find that the design of 5 layer\nmetal-insulator-metal-insulator-metal structures gives rise to multi-mode\ninterference phenomena that suppresses spurious transmission features gives\nrise to a single narrow transmission band with FWHM as small as 17 nm. The\ntransmission peaks of these multilayer slot-mode plasmonic filters (MSPFs) can\nbe systematically varied throughout the visible and near infrared spectrum, so\nthe same basic structure can serve as a filter over a large range of\nwavelengths.\n", "  This study presents numerical simulations and experiments considering the\nflow of an electrically conducting fluid inside a cube driven by a rotating\nmagnetic field (RMF). The investigations are focused on the spin-up, where a\nliquid metal (GaInSn) is suddenly exposed to an azimuthal body force generated\nby the RMF, and the subsequent flow development. The numerical simulations rely\non a semi-analytical expression for the induced electromagnetic force density\nin an electrically conducting medium inside a cuboid container with insulating\nwalls. Velocity distributions in two perpendicular planes are measured using a\nnovel dual-plane, two-component ultrasound array Doppler velocimeter (UADV)\nwith continuous data streaming, enabling long term measurements for\ninvestigating transient flows. This approach allows to identify the main\nemerging flow modes during the transition from a stable to unstable flow\nregimes with exponentially growing velocity oscillations using the Proper\nOrthogonal Decomposition (POD) method.\n  Characteristic frequencies in the oscillating flow regimes are determined in\nthe super critical range above the critical magnetic Taylor number $Ta_c\n\\approx 1.26 \\times 10^5$, where the transition from the steady double vortex\nstructure of the secondary flow to an unstable regime with exponentially\ngrowing oscillations is detected.\n  The mean flow structures and the temporal evolution of the flow predicted by\nthe numerical simulations and observed in experiments are in very good\nagreement.\n", "  Transition probabilities for a class of two level systems described by\nexplicitly time dependent Hamiltonians are considered. Provided only that the\napproach to the infinite time limit is non-trivial falling at least as fast as\n1/t for large t, the transition probability takes a particularly simple form\ndepending only on the value of Hamiltonian parameters in this limit.\n", "  We report on the fabrication and characterization of a Fabry-Perot\nmicrocavity enclosing a thin diamond membrane at cryogenic temperatures. The\ncavity is designed to enhance resonant emission of single nitrogen-vacancy\ncenters by allowing spectral and spatial tuning while preserving the optical\nproperties observed in bulk diamond. We demonstrate cavity finesse at cryogenic\ntemperatures within the range of F = 4,000-12,000 and find a sub-nanometer\ncavity stability. Modeling shows that coupling nitrogen-vacancy centers to\nthese cavities could lead to an increase of remote entanglement success rates\nby three orders of magnitude.\n", "  The tunability of the dielectric properties induced by the substrate driven\ninteractions (SDI) and the exchange field (M) due to the ferro-magnetic\nimpurities in graphene monolayer on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)\n(viz., XY2 , X = Mo, W; Y = S, Se) around K and K prime points is reported\nhere. The cavalcade of interactions involve sub-lattice-resolved, strongly\nenhanced intrinsic spin-orbit couplings(SOC), the extrinsic Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling (RSOC), and the orbital gap related to the transfer of the electronic\ncharge from graphene to XY2. The RSOC allows for external tuning of the band\ngap in graphene and connects the nearest neighbors with spin-flip. We obtain\nthe usual gapped bands with an effective, RSOC-dependent Zeeman field due to\nthe interplay of SDI. Using these bands we obtain the closed analytical\nexpression of the dielectric function in the finite doping case. The zero of\nthe dielectric function corresponds to the collective mode. Upon including the\nfull dispersion of graphene on TMDC, we find that there is in fact only one\ncollective mode and it corresponds to charge plasmons. The dispersion of the\nlatter yields the q^2/3 behavior and not the well known q^1/2 behavior. We also\nfind that the plasmon frequency could be changed by the tuning of the chemical\npotential.\n", "  A spin-$j$ state can be represented by a symmetric tensor of order $N=2j$ and\ndimension $4$. Here, $j$ can be a positive integer, which corresponds to a\nboson; $j$ can also be a positive half-integer, which corresponds to a fermion.\nIn this paper, we introduce regularly decomposable tensors and show that a\nspin-$j$ state is classical if and only if its representing tensor is a\nregularly decomposable tensor. In the even-order case, a regularly decomposable\ntensor is a completely decomposable tensor but not vice versa; a completely\ndecomposable tensors is a sum-of-squares (SOS) tensor but not vice versa; an\nSOS tensor is a positive semi-definite (PSD) tensor but not vice versa. In the\nodd-order case, the first row tensor of a regularly decomposable tensor is\nregularly decomposable and its other row tensors are induced by the regular\ndecomposition of its first row tensor. We also show that complete\ndecomposability and regular decomposability are invariant under orthogonal\ntransformations, and that the completely decomposable tensor cone and the\nregularly decomposable tensor cone are closed convex cones. Furthermore, in the\neven-order case, the completely decomposable tensor cone and the PSD tensor\ncone are dual to each other. The Hadamard product of two completely\ndecomposable tensors is still a completely decomposable tensor. Since one may\napply the positive semi-definite programming algorithm to detect whether a\nsymmetric tensor is an SOS tensor or not, this gives a checkable necessary\ncondition for classicality of a spin-$j$ state. Further research issues on\nregularly decomposable tensors are also raised.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive analysis of electroweak, QED and mixed\nQCD-electroweak corrections underlying the precise measurement of the W-boson\nmass M_W at hadron colliders. By applying a template fitting technique, we\ndetail the impact on M_W of next-to-leading order electroweak and QCD\ncorrections, multiple photon emission, lepton pair radiation and factorizable\nQCD-electroweak contributions. As a by-product, we provide an up-to-date\nestimate of the main theoretical uncertainties of perturbative nature. Our\nresults can serve as a guideline for the assessment of the theoretical\nsystematics at the Tevatron and LHC and allow a more robust precision\nmeasurement of the W-boson mass at hadron colliders.\n", "  The ongoing perplexing scenario with no hints of new physics at the Large\nHadron Collider can be elucidated amicably if the exotic particle spectrum in\nmany of the well-motivated theoretical models possesses degenerate mass. We\ninvestigate the usefulness of different kinematic variables sensitive to the\ncompressed mass region, and propose a search strategy considering a\nphenomenological supersymmetric scenario where the top squark undergoes a\nfour-body decay due to its extremely narrow mass difference with the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle. Considering a challenging but relatively clean\ndileptonic decay channel, we demonstrate that one can effectively restrain the\nsignificant background from the top quark, which provides a complementary\napproach to the present CMS analysis. With the new strategic approach the\ncurrent limit can be extended to a phase-space region that was not explored\nbefore.\n", "  We consider a model of dark quantum electrodynamics which is coupled with a\nvisible photon through a kinetic mixing term. After checking of consistency\nproperties, we compute the $g_w-2$, where $g_w$ is the gyromagnetic factor for\na dark fermion. The $g_w-2$ and $g-2$ of quantum electrodynamics are related by\nthe kinetic mixing factor. We analyse the $g_w-2$ in terms of the ratio $\\kappa\n=m_\\gamma/m_\\chi$ where $m_\\gamma$ and $m_\\chi$ are the masses of the dark\nphoton and the dark fermion and we discuss how light and heavy fermions become\nvery different for $m_\\gamma \\leq10^{-5}\\,$ eV. This analysis is also carried\nout using different available data.\n", "  One of the most pressing issues for loop quantum gravity and spin foams is\nthe construction of the continuum limit. In this paper, we propose a systematic\ncoarse-graining scheme for three-dimensional lattice gauge models including\nspin foams. This scheme is based on the concept of decorated tensor networks,\nwhich have been introduced recently. Here we develop an algorithm applicable to\ngauge theories with non-Abelian groups, which for the first time allows for the\napplication of tensor network coarse-graining techniques to proper spin foams.\nThe procedure deals efficiently with the large redundancy of degrees of freedom\nresulting from gauge symmetry. The algorithm is applied to 3D spin foams\ndefined on a cubical lattice which, in contrast to a proper triangulation,\nallows for non--trivial simplicity constraints. This mimics the construction of\nspin foams for 4D gravity. For lattice gauge models based on a finite group we\nuse the algorithm to obtain phase diagrams, encoding the continuum limit of a\nwide range of these models. We find phase transitions for various families of\nmodels carrying non--trivial simplicity constraints.\n", "  In this paper, we have studied the shapes coexistence in the 180-190Hg\nisotopes. The SO(6) representation of eigenstates and a transitional\nHamiltonian in the Interacting Boson Model are used to consider the evolution\nfrom prolate to oblate shapes for systems with total boson number N = 9-12.\nParameter free (up to overall scale factors) predictions for energy spectra and\nquadrupole transition rates are found to be in good agreement with experimental\ncounterparts. The results for the control parameter of transitional Hamiltonian\noffer a combination of spherical and deformed shapes in these Hg isotopes and\nalso more deviation from SO(6) limit is observed when the quadrupole\ndeformation is decreased. Also, there are some suggestion about the expectation\nvalues of operator which are determined in the first state of ground, beta and\ngamma bounds and the control parameter of model.\n", "  We present a novel way of testing the seesaw origin of neutrino mass in the\ncontext of the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model. It is based on the\nconnection between the leptonic interactions of the doubly charged scalars,\nwhose presence is at the core of the seesaw mechanism, and the neutrino Dirac\nYukawa couplings which govern, among other processes, the right-handed neutrino\ndecays into left-handed charged leptons. We prove that any physical quantity\ndepending on these couplings is a function of the hermitian part only which can\nsignificantly simplify their future experimental determination.\n", "  The direct detections of gravitational waves (GW) from merging binary black\nholes (BBH) by aLIGO have brought us a new opportunity to utilize BBH for a\nmeasurement of the Hubble constant. In this paper, we point out that there\nexists a small number of BBH that gives significantly small sky localization\nvolume so that a host galaxy is uniquely identified. Then a redshift of a BBH\nis obtained from a spectroscopic follow-up observation of the host galaxy.\nUsing these redshift-identified BBH, we show that the Hubble constant is\nmeasured at a level of precision better than 1% with advanced detectors like\naLIGO at design sensitivity. Since a GW observation is completely independent\nof other astrophysical means, this qualitatively new probe will help resolve a\nwell-known value discrepancy problem on the Hubble constant from cosmological\nmeasurements and local measurements.\n", "  Light neutral mediators, with mass $\\lesssim 1$ GeV, are common features of\nextensions to the Standard Model (SM). Current astrophysical and terrestrial\nexperiments have constrained the model parameter space, and planned experiments\naround the world promise continued improvement in sensitivity. In this paper we\nstudy the prospects for probing light neutral mediators using terrestrial\nstopped pion and reactor sources in combination with ultra-low threshold\nnuclear and electron recoil detectors. We show that the coherent\nneutrino-nucleus and neutrino-electron scattering channels provide\ncomplementary sensitivity to light mediators. With low threshold detectors, we\nshow that most stringent bounds on models arise from the nuclear scattering\nprocess, improving upon previous bounds from electron scattering of solar\nneutrinos by nearly an order of magnitude for mediator masses $\\gtrsim 0.1$\nGeV.\n", "  The semi-device-independent approach provides a framework for\nprepare-and-measure quantum protocols using devices whose behavior must not be\ncharacterized nor trusted, except for a single assumption on the dimension of\nthe Hilbert space characterizing the quantum carriers. Here, we propose instead\nto constrain the quantum carriers through a bound on the mean value of a\nwell-chosen observable. This modified assumption is physically better motivated\nthan a dimension bound and closer to the description of actual experiments. In\nparticular, we consider quantum optical schemes where the source emits quantum\nstates described in an infinite-dimensional Fock space and model our assumption\nas an upper bound on the average photon number in the emitted states. We\ncharacterize the set of correlations that may be exhibited in the simplest\npossible scenario compatible with our new framework, based on two\nenergy-constrained state preparations and a two-outcome measurement.\nInterestingly, we uncover the existence of quantum correlations exceeding the\nset of classical correlations that can be produced by devices behaving in a\npurely pre-determined fashion (possibly including shared randomness). This\nfeature suggests immediate applications to certified randomness generation.\nAlong this line, we analyze the achievable correlations in several\nprepare-and-measure optical schemes with a mean photon number constraint and\ndemonstrate that they allow for the generation of certified randomness. Our\nsimplest optical scheme works by the on-off keying of an attenuated laser\nsource followed by photocounting. It opens the path to more sophisticated\nenergy-constrained semi-device-independent quantum cryptography protocols, such\nas quantum key distribution.\n", "  Weyl semimetal (WSM) is expected to be an ideal spintronic material owing to\nits spin currents carried by the bulk and surface states with spin-momentum\nlocking. A photocurrent generation in noncentrosymmetric WSM was also predicted\nowing to its broken inversion symmetry and linear energy dispersion which are\nunique to Weyl systems. In our recent measurements, the circular photogalvanic\neffect (CPGE) has been demonstrated in WSM of TaAs. The CPGE voltage is\nproportional to the helicity of the incident light and reverses its direction\non changing the radiation helicity from left handed to right handed, a\nperiodical oscillation therefore appears following with the alteration of\noptical polarization. We herein attribute the CPGE to the asymmetric optical\nexcitation of the Weyl cone, which could result in an asymmetric distribution\nof photoexcited carriers in momentum space according to an optical spin\nselection rule.\n", "  Recent experiments found that a hot solid sphere that is able to sustain a\nstable Leidenfrost vapour layer in a liquid exhibits significant drag reduction\nduring free fall. The variation of the drag coefficient with Reynolds number\nshows substantial deviation from the characteristic drag crisis behavior at\nhigh Reynolds numbers. Results obtained with liqiuds of different viscosities\nshow that onset of the drag crisis depends on the viscosity ratio of the vapor\nto the liquid. The key feature of the vapour layer in facilitating tangential\nflow and in altering the behaviour of the boundary layer can be captured by the\nNavier slip model that is defined by a slip length. Here, direct numerical and\nlarge eddy simulations of flow past a sphere at moderate to high Reynolds\nnumbers ($10^2 \\leq \\mbox{Re} \\leq 4 \\times 10^4$) are employed to quantify\ncomparisons with experimental results in terms of variations of the drag\ncoefficient with Reynolds number and the form of the downstream wake on the\nsphere. This provides a simple one parameter characterization of the drag\nreduction phenomenon.\n", "  At present, the sources of entangled photons have a low rate of photon\ngeneration. This limitation is a key component of quantum informatics for the\nrealization of such functions as linear quantum computation and quantum\nteleportation. In this paper, we propose a method for high intensity generation\nof entangled photons in a two-mode electromagnetic field. On the basis of exact\nsolutions of the Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation, in the conditions of interaction of\nthe electrons in an atom with a strong two-mode electromagnetic field, it is\nshown that there may be large quantum entanglement between photons. The quantum\nentanglement is analyzed on the basis of the Schmidt parameter. It is shown\nthat the Schmidt parameter can reach very high values depending on the choice\nof characteristics of the two-mode fields. We find the Wigner function for the\nconsidered case. Violation of Bell's inequalities for continuous variables is\ndemonstrated.\n", "  Lattice gauge theories describe fundamental phenomena in nature, but\ncalculating their real-time dynamics on classical computers is notoriously\ndifficult. In a recent publication [Nature 534, 516 (2016)], we proposed and\nexperimentally demonstrated a digital quantum simulation of the paradigmatic\nSchwinger model, a U(1)-Wilson lattice gauge theory describing the interplay\nbetween fermionic matter and gauge bosons. Here, we provide a detailed\ntheoretical analysis of the performance and the potential of this protocol. Our\nstrategy is based on analytically integrating out the gauge bosons, which\npreserves exact gauge invariance but results in complicated long-range\ninteractions between the matter fields. Trapped-ion platforms are naturally\nsuited to implementing these interactions, allowing for an efficient quantum\nsimulation of the model, with a number of gate operations that scales only\npolynomially with system size. Employing numerical simulations, we illustrate\nthat relevant phenomena can be observed in larger experimental systems, using\nas an example the production of particle--antiparticle pairs after a quantum\nquench. We investigate theoretically the robustness of the scheme towards\ngeneric error sources, and show that near-future experiments can reach regimes\nwhere finite-size effects are insignificant. We also discuss the challenges in\nquantum simulating the continuum limit of the theory. Using our scheme,\nfundamental phenomena of lattice gauge theories can be probed using a broad set\nof experimentally accessible observables, including the entanglement entropy\nand the vacuum persistence amplitude.\n", "  The holographic equilibration of a far-from-equilibrium strongly coupled\ngauge theory is investigated. The dynamics of a probe D7-brane in an AdS-Vaidya\nbackground is studied in the presence of an external time-dependent electric\nfield. Defining the equilibration times $t_{eq}^c$ and $t_{eq}^j$, at which\ncondensation and current relax to their final equilibrated values, receptively,\nthe smallness of transition time $k_M$ or $k_E$ is enough to observe a\nuniversal behaviour for re-scaled equilibration times $k_M k_E (t_{eq}^c)^{-2}$\nand $k_M k_E (t_{eq}^j)^{-2}$. Moreover, regardless of the values for $k_M$ and\n$k_E$, $t_{eq}^c/t_{eq}^j$ also behaves universally for large enough value of\nthe ratio of the final electric field to final temperature. Then a simple\ndiscussion of the static case reveals that $t_{eq}^c \\leq t_{eq}^j$. For an\nout-of-equilibrium process, our numerical results show that, apart from the\ncases for which $k_E$ is small, the static time ordering persists.\n", "  Non-local carrier injection/detection schemes lie at the very foundation of\ninformation manipulation in integrated systems. This paradigm consists in\ncontrolling with an external signal the channel where charge carriers flow\nbetween a \"source\" and a well separated \"drain\". The next generation\nelectronics may operate on the spin of carriers instead of their charge and\ngermanium appears as the best hosting material to develop such a platform for\nits compatibility with mainstream silicon technology and the long electron spin\nlifetime at room temperature. Moreover, the energy proximity between the direct\nand indirect bandgaps allows for optical spin injection and detection within\nthe telecommunication window. In this letter, we demonstrate injection of pure\nspin currents (\\textit{i.e.} with no associated transport of electric charges)\nin germanium, combined with non-local spin detection blocks at room\ntemperature. Spin injection is performed either electrically through a magnetic\ntunnel junction (MTJ) or optically, exploiting the ability of lithographed\nnanostructures to manipulate the distribution of circularly-polarized light in\nthe semiconductor. Pure spin current detection is achieved using either a MTJ\nor the inverse spin-Hall effect (ISHE) across a platinum stripe. These results\nbroaden the palette of tools available for the realization of opto-spintronic\ndevices.\n", "  We study the one loop electroweak radiative corrections to\n  $h^0\\to b\\bar{b}$ and $h^0\\to \\tau^+\\tau^-$ in the framework of two Higgs\ndoublet Model (2HDM). We evaluate the deviation of these couplings from their\nStandard Model (SM) values. $h^0\\to b\\bar{b}$ and $h^0\\to \\tau^+\\tau^-$ may\nreceives large contribution from triple couplings $h^0H^0H^0$, $H^0h^0h^0$,\n$h^0A^0A^0$ and $h^0H^+H^-$ which are absent in the Standard Model. It is found\nthat in 2HDM, these corrections could be significant and may reach more than\n20\\% for not tow heavy $H^0$ or $A^0$ or $H^\\pm$. We also study the ratio of\nbranching ratios $R=BR(h^0\\to b\\bar{b})/BR(h^0\\to \\tau^+\\tau^-)$ of Higgs boson\ndecays which could be used to disentangle SM from other models such as 2HDM.\n", "  Thomson scattering of intense laser pulses from relativistic electrons allows\nus to generate high-brightness and tunable-polarization X/{\\gamma}-ray pulses.\nThis paper demonstrates the polarization control of the Thomson scattering\nsource experimentally. The polarization of X/{\\gamma}-ray is related to\nincident polarized laser beams, which is controlled by rotating a quarter-wave\nplate. In the experiment, the polarization of X-ray is determined by recording\nthe spatial distribution of scattered photons, produced by X-ray irradiating on\na target. According to modulation curves analysed from experiment results, the\nconclusion is that the polarization of Thomson scattering source is tunable and\ncontrollable. Meanwhile, stokes parameters of X/{\\gamma}-ray whose energy\nvaries between tens of keV and MeV are simulated. Considering the paraxial\nphotons, it is showed that the polarization is nearly the same value in a wide\nrange of X-ray energy according to simulation results.\n", "  Population inversion on the 5D-6P transition in Rb atoms produced by cw\nexcitation at different wavelengths has been analysed by comparing the\ngenerated mid-IR radiation at 5.23 um originated from amplified spontaneous\nemission and isotropic blue fluorescence at 420 nm. A novel method of detecting\ntwo-photon excitation in atomic vapours using ASE is suggested. We have\nobserved directional co- and counter-propagating emission at 5.23 um. We find\nthat the power dependencies of the backward- and forward-directed emission can\nbe very close, however their spectral dependencies are not identical. The\nmid-IR emission in Rb vapours excited by nearly counter-propagating beams at\n780 and 776 nm does not exactly coincide spatially with the applied laser\nbeams. The presented observations could be useful for enhancing efficiency of\nfrequency mixing processes and new field generation in atomic media.\n", "  In this work, based on consideration of periodicity and asymptotic forms of\nwave function, we propose a novel approach to the solution of finite volume\nthree-body problem by mapping a three-body problem into a higher dimensional\ntwo-body problem. The idea is demonstrated by an example of two light spinless\nparticles and one heavy particle scattering in one spatial dimension. This 1D\nthree-body problem resembles a two-body problem in two spatial dimensions\nmathematically, and quantization condition of 1D three-body problem is thus\nderived accordingly.\n", "  We propose a 2D QFT generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, which we\nargue preserves most of its features. The UV limit of the model is described by\n$N$ copies of a topological Ising CFT. The full interacting model exhibits\nconformal symmetry in the IR and an emergent pseudo-Goldstone mode that arises\nfrom broken reparametrization symmetry. We find that the effective action of\nthe Goldstone mode matches with the 3D AdS gravity action, viewed as a\nfunctional of the boundary metric. We compute the spectral density and show\nthat the leading deviation from conformal invariance looks like a $T \\bar{T}$\ndeformation. We comment on the relation between the IR effective action and\nLiouville CFT.\n", "  At present, there is still no consistent interpretation of the normal and\nsuperconducting properties of Fe-based superconductors (FeSCs). The strength of\nthe el-el interaction and the role of correlation effects are under debate.\nHere, we examine several common materials and illustrate various problems and\nconcepts that are generic for all FeSCs. Based on empirical observations and\nqualitative insight from density functional theory, we show that the\nsuperconducting and low-energy thermodynamic properties of the FeSCs can be\ndescribed semi-quantitively within multiband Eliashberg theory. We account for\nan important high-energy mass renormalization phenomenologically,and in\nagreement with constraints provided by thermodynamic, optical, and\nangle-resolved photoemission data. When seen in this way, all FeSCs with\n$T_\\mathrm{c} <$ 40~K studied so far are found to belong to an {\\it\nintermediate} coupling regime. This finding is in contrast to the strong\ncoupling scenarios proposed in the early period of the FeSC history.We also\ndiscuss several related issues, including the role of band shifts as measured\nby the positions of van Hove singularities, and the nature of a recently\nsuggested quantum critical point in the strongly hole-doped systems\nAFe$_2$As$_2$ (A = K, Rb, Cs). Using high-precision full relativistic GGA-band\nstructure calculations, we arrive at a somewhat milder mass renormalization in\ncomparison with previous studies. From the calculated mass anisotropies of all\nFermi surface sheets, only the $\\varepsilon$-pocket near the corner of the BZ\nis compatible with the experimentally observed anisotropy of the upper critical\nfield. pointing to its dominant role in the superconductivity of these three\ncompounds.\n", "  We show that in $\\text{O}(D)$ invariant matrix theories containing a large\nnumber $D$ of complex or Hermitian matrices, one can define a\n$D\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit for which the sum over planar diagrams truncates to\na tractable, yet non-trivial, sum over melon diagrams. In particular, results\nobtained recently in SYK and tensor models can be generalized to traditional,\nstring-inspired matrix quantum mechanical models of black holes.\n", "  In this paper we generalize the Parikh-Wilczek scheme to a holographic screen\nin the framework of the ultraviolet self-complete quantum gravity. We calculate\nthat the tunneling probabilities of the massless and massive particles depend\non their energies of the particles and the mass of the holographic screen. The\nradiating temperature has not been the standard Hawking temperature. On the\ncontrary, the quantum unitarity principle always remains.\n", "  The single-particle spectral function measures the density of electronic\nstates (DOS) in a material as a function of both momentum and energy, providing\ncentral insights into phenomena such as superconductivity and Mott insulators.\nWhile scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and other tunneling methods have\nprovided partial spectral information, until now only angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has permitted a comprehensive determination\nof the spectral function of materials in both momentum and energy. However,\nARPES operates only on electronic systems at the material surface and cannot\nwork in the presence of applied magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate a new\nmethod for determining the full momentum and energy resolved electronic\nspectral function of a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system embedded in a\nsemiconductor. In contrast with ARPES, the technique remains operational in the\npresence of large externally applied magnetic fields and functions for\nelectronic systems with zero electrical conductivity or with zero electron\ndensity. It provides a direct high-resolution and high-fidelity probe of the\ndispersion and dynamics of the interacting 2D electron system. By ensuring the\nsystem of interest remains under equilibrium conditions, we uncover delicate\nsignatures of many-body effects involving electron-phonon interactions,\nplasmons, polarons, and a novel phonon analog of the vacuum Rabi splitting in\natomic systems.\n", "  ATK-ForceField is a software package for atomistic simulations using\nclassical interatomic potentials. It is implemented as a part of the Atomistix\nToolKit (ATK), which is a Python programming environment that makes it easy to\ncreate and analyze both standard and highly customized simulations. This paper\nwill focus on the atomic interaction potentials, molecular dynamics, and\ngeometry optimization features of the software, however, many more advanced\nmodeling features are available. The implementation details of these algorithms\nand their computational performance will be shown. We present three\nillustrative examples of the types of calculations that are possible with\nATK-ForceField: modeling thermal transport properties in a silicon germanium\ncrystal, vapor deposition of selenium molecules on a selenium surface, and a\nsimulation of creep in a copper polycrystal.\n", "  Magmatism in subduction zones builds continental crust and causes most of\nEarth's subaerial volcanism. The production rate and composition of magmas are\ncontrolled by the thermal structure of subduction zones. A range of geochemical\nand heat flow evidence has recently converged to indicate that subduction zones\nare hotter at lithospheric depths beneath the arc than predicted by canonical\nthermomechanical models, which neglect magmatism. We show that this discrepancy\ncan be resolved by consideration of the heat transported by magma. In our one-\nand two-dimensional numerical models and scaling analysis, magmatic transport\nof sensible and latent heat locally alters the thermal structure of canonical\nmodels by $\\sim$300 K, increasing predicted surface heat flow and\nmid-lithospheric temperatures to observed values. We find the advection of\nsensible heat to be larger than the deposition of latent heat. Based on these\nresults we conclude that thermal transport by magma migration affects the\nchemistry and the location of arc volcanoes.\n", "  A new approach to perform analog optical differentiation is presented using\nhalf-wavelength slabs. First, a half-wavelength dielectric slab is used to\ndesign a first order differentiator. The latter works properly for both major\npolarizations, in contrast to designs based on Brewster effect [Opt. Lett. 41,\n3467 (2016)]. Inspired by the proposed dielectric differentiator, and by\nexploiting the unique features of graphene, we further design and demonstrate a\nreconfigurable and highly miniaturized differentiator using a half-wavelength\nplasmonic graphene film. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed\ngraphene-based differentiator is even smaller than the most compact\ndifferentiator presented so far [Opt. Lett. 40, 5239 (2015)].\n", "  In this work the conducting properties of graphene lattice with a particular\nconcentration of defect (5\\% and 10\\%) has been studied. The real space block\nrecursion method introduced by Haydock et al. has been used in presence of the\nrandom distribution of defects in graphene. This Green function based method is\nfound more powerful than the usual reciprocal based methods which need\nartificial periodicity. Different resonant states appear because of the\npresence of topological and local defects are studied within the framework of\nGreen function.\n", "  A recent analysis of data on the two photon production of the $\\eta_c$ and\nits decay to $K(K\\pi)$ has determined the $K\\pi$ $S$-wave amplitude in a\n\"model-independent\" way assuming primarily that the additional kaon is a\nspectator in this decay. The purpose of this paper is to fit these results,\ntogether with classic $K\\pi$ production data from LASS, within a formalism that\nimplements unitarity for the di-meson interaction. This fixes the $I=1/2$\n$K\\pi\\to K\\pi$ $S$-wave amplitude up to 2.4 GeV. This resolves the Barrelet\nambiguity in the original LASS analysis, and constrains the amount of\ninelasticity in $K\\pi$ scattering, highlighting that this becomes significant\nbeyond 1.8 GeV. This result needs to be checked by experimental information on\nthe many inelastic channels, in particular $K\\eta^\\prime$ and $K\\pi\\pi\\pi$. Our\nanalysis provides a single representation for the $K\\pi$ $S$-wave from\nthreshold, controlled by Chiral Perturbation Theory, through the broad\n$\\kappa$, $K_0^*(1430)$ and $K_0^*(1950)$ resonances. There is no arbitrary sum\nof Breit-Wigner forms and random backgrounds for real $K\\pi$ masses. Rather the\nform provides a representation that can be translated to other processes with\n$K\\pi$ interactions with their own coupling functions, while automatically\nmaintaining consistency with the chiral dynamics near threshold, with the LASS\ndata and the new results on $\\eta_c$ decay.\n", "  The rotary sequential hydrolysis of metabolic machine F1-ATPase is a\nprominent feature to reveal high coordination among multiple chemical sites on\nthe stator F1 ring, which also contributes to tight coupling between the\nchemical reaction and central {\\gamma}-shaft rotation. High-speed AFM\nexperiments discovered that the sequential hydrolysis was maintained on the F1\nring even in the absence of the {\\gamma} rotor. To explore how the intrinsic\nsequential performance arises, we computationally investigated essential\ninter-subunit couplings on the hexameric ring of mitochondrial and bacterial\nF1. We first reproduced the sequential hydrolysis schemes as experimentally\ndetected, by simulating tri-site ATP hydrolysis cycles on the F1 ring upon\nkinetically imposing inter-subunit couplings to substantially promote the\nhydrolysis products release. We found that it is key for certain ATP binding\nand hydrolysis events to facilitate the neighbor-site ADP and Pi release to\nsupport the sequential hydrolysis. The kinetically feasible couplings were then\nscrutinized through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations as well as\ncoarse-grained simulations, in which we enforced targeted conformational\nchanges for the ATP binding or hydrolysis. Notably, we detected the\nasymmetrical neighbor-site opening that would facilitate the ADP release upon\nthe enforced ATP binding, and computationally captured the complete Pi release\nthrough charge hopping upon the enforced neighbor-site ATP hydrolysis. The\nATP-hydrolysis triggered Pi release revealed in current TMD simulation confirms\na recent prediction made from statistical analyses of single molecule\nexperimental data in regard to the role ATP hydrolysis plays. Our studies,\ntherefore, elucidate both the concerted chemical kinetics and underlying\nstructural dynamics of the inter-subunit couplings that lead to the rotary\nsequential hydrolysis of the F1 ring.\n", "  The central aspect of my personal scientific activity, has focused on\ncalculations useful for interpretation of High Energy accelerator experimental\nresults, especially in a domain of precision tests of the Standard Model. My\nactivities started in early 80's, when computer support for algebraic\nmanipulations was in its infancy. But already then it was important for my\nwork. It brought a multitude of benefits, but at the price of some\ninconvenience for physics intuition. Calculations became more complex, work had\nto be distributed over teams of researchers and due to automatization, some\naspects of the intermediate results became more difficult to identify.\n  In my talk I will not be very exhaustive, I will present examples from my\npersonal research only: (i) calculations of spin effects for the process e+ e-\nto tau+tau- gamma at Petra/PEP energies, calculations (with the help of the\n{\\tt Grace} system of Minami-tateya group) and phenomenology of spin amplitudes\nfor (ii) e+ e- to 4f and for (iii) e+ e- to nu_e bar nu_e gamma gamma\nprocesses, (iv) phenomenology of CP-sensitive observables for Higgs boson\nparity in H to tau+ tau- , tau+- to nu 2(3)pi cascade decays\n", "  We consider turbulence in a stratified 'Kolmogorov' flow, driven by\nhorizontal shear in the form of sinusoidal body forcing in the presence of an\nimposed background linear stable stratification in the third direction. This\nflow configuration allows the controlled investigation of the formation of\ncoherent structures, which here organise the flow into horizontal layers by\ninclining the background shear as the strength of the stratifica- tion is\nincreased. By numerically converging exact steady states from direct numerical\nsimulations of chaotic flow, we show, for the first time, a robust connection\nbetween linear theory predicting instabilities from infinitesimal perturbations\nto the robust finite amplitude nonlinear layered state observed in the\nturbulence. We investigate how the observed vertical length scales are related\nto the primary linear instabilities and compare to previously considered\nexamples of shear instability leading to layer formation in other horizontally\nsheared flows.\n", "  We develop a unified theoretical picture for excitations in Mott systems,\nportraying both the heavy quasiparticle excitations and the Hubbard bands as\nfeatures of an emergent Fermi liquid state formed in an extended Hilbert space,\nwhich is non-perturbatively connected to the physical system. This observation\nsheds light on the fact that even the incoherent excitations in strongly\ncorrelated matter often display a well defined Bloch character, with pronounced\nmomentum dispersion. Furthermore, it indicates that the Mott point can be\nviewed as a topological transition, where the number of distinct dispersing\nbands displays a sudden change at the critical point. Our results, obtained\nfrom an appropriate variational principle, display also remarkable quantitative\naccuracy. This opens an exciting avenue for fast realistic modeling of strongly\ncorrelated materials.\n", "  Two independent criteria are presented that together guarantee exponential\nsuppression of the two-loop cosmological constant in non-supersymmetric\nheterotic strings. They are derived by performing calculations in both the full\nstring theory and in its underlying effective field theory, and come\nrespectively from contributions that involve only physical untwisted states,\nand contributions that include orbifold twisted states. The criteria depend\npurely on the spectrum and charges, so a model that satisfies them will do so\nwith no fine-tuning. An additional consistency condition (emerging from the\nso-called separating degeneration limit of the two-loop diagram) is that the\none-loop cosmological constant must also be suppressed, by Bose-Fermi\ndegeneracy in the massless spectrum. We remark that theories of this kind, that\nhave continued exponential suppression to higher orders, can form the basis for\na string implementation of the \"naturalness without supersymmetry\" idea.\n", "  As single-photon sources become more mature and are used more often in\nquantum information, communications and measurement applications, their\ncharacterization becomes more important. Single-photon-like light is often\ncharacterized by its brightness, and two quantum properties: the single-photon\ncomposition and the photon indistinguishability. While it is desirable to\nobtain these quantities from a single measurement, currently two or more\nmeasurements are required. Here, we simultaneously determine the brightness,\nthe single photon purity, the indistinguishability, and the statistical\ndistribution of Fock states to third order for a quantum light source. The\nmeasurement uses a pair of two-photon (n = 2) number-resolving detectors. n > 2\nnumber-resolving detectors provide no additional advantage in the single-photon\ncharacterization. The new method extracts more information per experimental\ntrial than a conventional measurement for all input states, and is particularly\nmore e cient for statistical mixtures of photon states. Thus, using this n=2,\nnumber- resolving detector scheme will provide advantages in a variety of\nquantum optics measurements and systems.\n", "  We develop a unified theory that encompasses the macroscopic dynamics of\nrecurrent interactions of binary units within arbitrary network architectures.\nUsing the martingale theory, our mathematical analysis provides a complete\ndescription of nonequilibrium fluctuations in networks with finite size and\nfinite degree of interactions. Our approach allows the investigation of systems\nfor which a deterministic mean-field theory breaks down. To demonstrate this,\nwe uncover a novel dynamic state in which a recurrent network of binary units\nwith statistically inhomogeneous interactions, along with an asynchronous\nbehavior, also exhibits collective nontrivial stochastic fluctuations in the\nthermodynamical limit.\n", "  We propose and analyze numerically a simple dynamical model that describes\nthe firm behaviors under uncertainty of demand forecast. Iterating this simple\nmodel and varying some parameters values we observe a wide variety of market\ndynamics such as equilibria, periodic and chaotic behaviors. Interestingly the\nmodel is also able to reproduce market collapses.\n", "  The low-temperature properties of certain quantum magnets can be described in\nterms of a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnetic quasiparticles\n(triplons). Some mean-field approaches (MFA) to describe these systems, based\non the standard grand canonical ensemble, do not take the anomalous density\ninto account and leads to an internal inconsistency, as it has been shown by\nHohenberg and Martin, and may therefore produce unphysical results. Moreover,\nan explicit breaking of the U(1) symmetry as observed, for example, in TlCuCl3\nmakes the application of MFA more complicated. In the present work, we develop\na self-consistent MFA approach, similar to the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov\napproximation in the notion of representative statistical ensembles, including\nthe effect of a weakly broken U(1) symmetry. We apply our results on\nexperimental data of the quantum magnet TlCuCl3 and show that magnetization\ncurves and the energy dispersion can be well described within this\napproximation assuming that the BEC scenario is still valid. We predict that\nthe shift of the critical temperature Tc due to a finite exchange anisotropy is\nrather substantial even when the anisotropy parameter \\gamma is small, e.g.,\n\\Delta T_c \\approx 10%$ of Tc in H = 6T and for \\gamma\\approx 4 \\mu eV.\n", "  We have performed a theoretical and numerical investigation of\nthermoacoustically amplified quasi-planar nonlinear waves driven to the limit\nof shock-wave formation in a variable-area 2.58 m long looped resonator\ndesigned via eigenvalue analysis to maximize the growth rate of the second\nharmonic (265 Hz). High-order unstructured fully compressible Navier-Stokes\nsimulations reveal the presence of three regimes: (i) Monochromatic harmonic\ngrowth, governed by linear thermoacoustics; (ii) Hierarchical spectral\nbroadening, characterized by nonlinear energy cascade; (iii) Shock-wave\ndominated limit cycle, where energy production is balanced by dissipation\noccurring at the captured shock-thickness scale. We have modeled these regimes\nof thermoacoustic wave amplification based on first-principle governing\nequations and elucidated the physics of energy density production and\nsaturation to a limit cycle.\n", "  We discuss bosonization and Fermionic Short-Range-Entangled (FSRE) phases of\nmatter in one, two, and three spatial dimensions, emphasizing the physical\nmeaning of the cohomological parameters which label such phases and the\nconnection with higher-form symmetries. We propose a classification scheme for\nfermionic SPT phases in three spatial dimensions with an arbitrary finite point\nsymmetry G. It generalizes the supercohomology of Gu and Wen. We argue that the\nmost general such phase can be obtained from a bosonic \"shadow\" by condensing\nboth fermionic particles and strings.\n", "  It is shown that the random-phase approximation (RPA) method with its\nnonlinear generalization, which was previously considered as approximation,\nreproduces the exact solutions of the Lipkin model. The nonlinear RPA is based\non an equation nonlinear on eigenvectors and includes many-particle-many-hole\ncomponents in the creation operator of the excited states. We demonstrate the\nexact character of solutions analytically for the particle number $N$ = 2 and,\nnumerically, for $N$ = 20. This finding indicates that the nonlinear RPA is\nequivalent to the exact Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, which opens up new\npossibilities for realistic calculations in many-body problems.\n", "  Microresonator-based frequency combs are strong contenders as light sources\nfor wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Recent demonstrations have shown\nthe potential of microresonator combs for replacing tens of WDM lasers with a\nsingle laser-pumped device. These experiments relied on microresonators\ndisplaying anomalous dispersion. Devices operating in the normal dispersion\noffer the prospect of attaining high power conversion efficiency - an aspect\nthat will be crucial in the future for enabling energy-efficient coherent\ncommunications with higher order modulation formats or lighting several spatial\nchannels in space-division multiplexing. Here we report the experimental\ndemonstration of coherent communications using normal dispersion microresonator\ncombs. With polarization multiplexed (PM) quadrature phase-shift keying, we\ntransmitted data over more than 6300 km in single-mode fiber. In a second\nexperiment, we reached beyond 700 km with PM 16 quadrature amplitude modulation\nformat and an aggregate data rate above 900 Gbit/s assuming 6% error correction\noverhead. These results represent the longest fiber transmission ever achieved\nusing an integrated comb source.\n", "  We measure a value for the cosmic expansion of $H(z) = 89 \\pm 23$(stat) $\\pm$\n44(syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at a redshift of $z \\simeq 0.47$ based on the\ndifferential age technique. This technique, also known as cosmic chronometers,\nuses the age difference between two redshifts for a passively evolving\npopulation of galaxies to calculate the expansion rate of the Universe. Our\nmeasurement is based on analysis of high quality spectra of Luminous Red\nGalaxies (LRGs) obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in\ntwo narrow redshift ranges of $z \\simeq 0.40$ and $z \\simeq 0.55$ as part of an\ninitial pilot study. Ages were estimated by fitting single stellar population\nmodels to the observed spectra. This measurement presents one of the best\nestimates of $H(z)$ via this method at $z\\sim0.5$ to date.\n", "  We propose an extension of Quantum Mechanics based on the idea that the\nunderlying \"quantum noise\" has a non-zero, albeit very small, correlation time\n$\\tau_c$. The standard (non-relativistic) Schrodinger equation is recovered to\nzeroth order in $\\tau_c$, and the first correction to energy levels is\ncomputed. Some consequences are discussed, in particular the violation of\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle and the restoration of locality at short\ntimes.\n", "  In electronic structure theory, restricted single-reference coupled cluster\n(CC) captures weak correlation but fails catastrophically under strong\ncorrelation. Spin-projected unrestricted Hartree-Fock (SUHF), on the other\nhand, misses weak correlation but captures a large portion of strong\ncorrelation. The theoretical description of many important processes, e.g.\nmolecular dissociation, requires a method capable of accurately capturing both\nweak- and strong correlation simultaneously, and would likely benefit from a\ncombined CC-SUHF approach. Based on what we have recently learned about SUHF\nwritten as particle-hole excitations out of a symmetry-adapted reference\ndeterminant, we here propose a heuristic coupled cluster doubles model to\nattenuate the dominant spin collective channel of the quadratic terms in the\ncoupled cluster equations. Proof of principle results presented here are\nencouraging and point to several paths forward for improving the method\nfurther.\n", "  Metastable condensed matter typically fluctuates about local energy minima at\nthe femtosecond time scale before transitioning between local minima after\nnanoseconds or microseconds. This vast scale separation limits the\napplicability of classical molecular dynamics methods and has spurned the\ndevelopment of a host of approximate algorithms. One recently proposed method\nis diffusive molecular dynamics which aims to integrate a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations describing the likelihood of occupancy by one of two\nspecies, in the case of a binary alloy, while quasistatically evolving the\nlocations of the atoms. While diffusive molecular dynamics has shown to be\nefficient and provide agreement with observations, it is fundamentally a model,\nwith unclear connections to classical molecular dynamics.\n  In this work, we formulate a spin-diffusion stochastic process and show how\nit can be connected to diffusive molecular dynamics. The spin-diffusion model\ncouples a classical overdamped Langevin equation to a kinetic Monte Carlo model\nfor exchange amongst the species of a binary alloy. Under suitable assumptions\nand approximations, spin-diffusion can be shown to lead to diffusive molecular\nmolecular dynamics type models. The key assumptions and approximations include\na well defined time scale separation, a choice of spin exchange rates, a low\ntemperature approximation, and a mean field type approximation. We derive\nseveral models from different assumptions and show their relationship to\ndiffusive molecular dynamics. Differences and similarities amongst the models\nare explored in a simple test problem.\n", "  We formulate a Data Driven Computing paradigm, termed max-ent Data Driven\nComputing, that generalizes distance-minimizing Data Driven Computing and is\nrobust with respect to outliers. Robustness is achieved by means of clustering\nanalysis. Specifically, we assign data points a variable relevance depending on\ndistance to the solution and on maximum-entropy estimation. The resulting\nscheme consists of the minimization of a suitably-defined free energy over\nphase space subject to compatibility and equilibrium constraints.\nDistance-minimizing Data Driven schemes are recovered in the limit of zero\ntemperature. We present selected numerical tests that establish the convergence\nproperties of the max-ent Data Driven solvers and solutions.\n", "  Ion cyclotron emission (ICE) is detected during edge localised modes (ELMs)\nin the KSTAR tokamak at harmonics of the proton cyclotron frequency in the\nouter plasma edge. The emission typically chirps downward (occasionally upward)\nduring ELM crashes, and is driven by confined 3MeV fusion-born protons that\nhave large drift excursions from the plasma core. We exploit fully kinetic\nsimulations at multiple plasma densities to match the time-evolving features of\nthe chirping ICE. This yields a unique, very high time resolution diagnostic of\nthe collapsing edge pedestal density.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupled semiconducting nanowires with proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity are expected to host Majorana zero modes at their endpoints\nwhen a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied. The resulting phase would\nbe a one-dimensional topological superconductor. However, while a variety of\nexperiments have been performed observing a zero bias conductance peak\n(suggestive of Majorana zero modes), the topological nature of these physical\nsystems is still a subject of debate. Here we suggest a quantitative test of\nthe degree to which a system displaying a zero bias peak may be considered\ntopological. The experiment is similar to previous measurements of conductance,\nbut is performed with the aid of a quantum dot at the wire's end. We arrive at\nthe surprising result that the non-local nature of the topological system may\nbe identified through a local measurement.\n", "  Chiral active fluids are materials composed of self-spinning rotors that\ncontinuously inject energy and angular momentum at the microscale.\nOut-of-equilibrium fluids with active-rotor constituents have been\nexperimentally realized using nanoscale biomolecular motors, microscale active\ncolloids, or macroscale driven chiral grains. Here, we show how such chiral\nactive fluids break both parity and time-reversal symmetries in their steady\nstates, giving rise to a dissipationless linear-response coefficient called odd\nviscosity in their constitutive relations. Odd viscosity couples pressure and\nvorticity leading, for example, to density modulations within a vortex profile.\nMoreover, chiral active fluids flow in the direction transverse to applied\ncompression as in shock propagation experiments. We envision that this\ncollective transverse response may be exploited to design self-assembled\nhydraulic cranks that convert between linear and rotational motion in\nmicroscopic machines powered by active-rotors fluids.\n", "  Loop-induced $Hgg$ and $H\\gamma\\gamma$ coupling play an important role in the\nHiggs production and decay at the LHC. These vertices can be affected by\nvarious New Physics contributions, including new particles, anomalous Yukawa\ncouplings, and so on. We point out some ratios of the Higgs signal strengths\ncould help disentangle the contributions of new particles from other sources of\nNew Physics.\n", "  We tabulate spontaneous emission rates for all possible 811\nelectric-dipole-allowed transitions between the 75 lowest-energy states of Ca\nI. These involve the $4sns$ ($n=4-8$), $4snp$ ($n=4-7$), $4snd$ ($n=3-6$),\n$4snf$ ($n=4-6$), $4p^2$, and $3d4p$ electronic configurations. We compile the\ntransition rates by carrying out ab initio relativistic calculations using the\ncombined method of configuration interaction and many-body perturbation theory.\nThe results are compared to the available literature values. The tabulated\nrates can be useful in various applications, such as optimizing laser cooling\nin magneto-optical traps, estimating various systematic effects in optical\nclocks and evaluating static or dynamic polarizabilities and long-range\natom-atom interaction coefficients and related atomic properties.\n", "  Atomically thin black phosphorus (BP) field-effect transistors show\nstrong-weak localization transition which is tunable through gate voltages.\nHopping transports through charge impurity induced localized states are\nmeasured at low-carrier density regime. Variable-range hopping model is applied\nto simulate the charge carrier scattering behavior. In the high-carrier\nconcentration regime, a negative magnetoresistance signals the weak\nlocalization effect. The extracted phase coherence length is power-law\ntemperature dependent ($\\sim T^{-0.48\\pm0.03}$) and demonstrates\nelectron-electron interactions in few-layer BP. The competition between the\nStrong localization length and phase coherence length is proposed and discussed\nbased on the observed gate tunable strong-weak localization transition in\nfew-layer BP.\n", "  We consider a colored version of the SYK model, that is we distinguish the\n$D$ vector fermionic fields involved in the interaction by a color. We obtain\nthe full $1/N$ series of both the quenched and annealed free energies of the\nmodel and show that at leading order the two are identical. The results can be\nused to study systematically the $1/N$ corrections to this leading order\nbehavior.\n", "  Extensive self-consistent multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF)\ncalculations are performed for the $3s^2 3p^6 3d^k$ ($k=1-9$) ground\nconfigurations of highly charged ions ($Z=72-83$). Complete and consistent data\nsets of \\textbf{excitation energies}, wavelengths, line strengths, oscillator\nstrengths, and magnetic dipole (M1) and electric quadrupole (E2) transition\nrates among all these levels are given. We have compared our results with the\nresults available in the literature and the accuracy of the data is assessed.\nWe predict new energy levels and transition probabilities where no other\nexperimental or theoretical results are available, which will form the basis\nfor future experimental work.\n", "  The universality of the weak interactions can be tested in semileptonic $b\n\\to c$ transitions, and in particular in the ratios $R(D^{(*)}) \\equiv \\Gamma(B\n\\rightarrow D^{(*)} \\tau \\nu )/\\Gamma(B \\rightarrow D^{(*)} \\ell \\nu )$ (where\n$\\ell = \\mu$ or $e$). Due to the recent differences between the experimental\nmeasurements of these observables by BaBar, Belle and LHCb on the one hand and\nthe Standard Model predicted values on the other hand, we study the predicted\nratios $R(D^{(*)}) = \\Gamma(B \\rightarrow D^{(*)} \\tau +$ \"missing\" $)/\\Gamma(B\n\\rightarrow D^{(*)} \\ell \\nu )$ in scenarios with an additional sterile heavy\nneutrino of mass $\\sim 1$ GeV. Further, we evaluate the newly defined ratio\n$R(0) \\equiv \\Gamma(B \\to \\tau +$ \"missing\" $)/\\Gamma(B \\to \\mu \\nu )$ in such\nscenarios, in view of the future possibilities of measuring the quantity at\nBelle-II.\n", "  We consider a layer of an inviscid fluid with free surface which is subject\nto vertical high-frequency vibrations. We derive three asymptotic systems of\nequations that describe slowly evolving (in comparison with the vibration\nfrequency) free-surface waves. The first set of equations is obtained without\nassuming that the waves are long. These equations are as difficult to solve as\nthe exact equations for irrotational water waves in a non-vibrating fluid. The\nother two models describe long waves. These models are obtained under two\ndifferent assumptions about the amplitude of the vibration. Surprisingly, the\ngoverning equations have exactly the same form in both cases (up to\ninterpretation of some constants). These equations reduce to the standard\ndispersionless shallow-water equations if the vibration is absent, and the\nvibration manifests itself via an additional term which makes the equations\ndispersive and, for small-amplitude waves, is similar to the term that would\nappear if surface tension were taken into account. We show that our dispersive\nshallow water equations have both solitary and periodic travelling waves\nsolutions and discuss an analogy between these solutions and travelling\ncapillary-gravity waves in a non-vibrating fluid.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the generation of intense keV attosecond pulses\nin an orthogonally polarized multicycle midinfrared two-color laser field. It\nis demonstrated that multiple continuum-like humps, which have a spectral width\nof about twenty orders of harmonics and an intensity of about one order higher\nthan adjacent normal harmonic peaks, are generated under proper two-color\ndelays, owing to the reduction of the number of electron-ion recollisions and\nsuppression of inter-half-cycle interference effect of multiple electron\ntrajectories when the long wavelength midinfrared driving field is used. Using\nthe semiclassical trajectory model, we have revealed the two-dimensional\nmanipulation of the electron-ion recollision process, which agrees well with\nthe time frequency analysis. By filtering these humps, intense isolated\nattosecond pulses are directly generated without any phase compensation. Our\nproposal provides a simple technique to generate intense isolated attosecond\npulses with various central photon energies covering the multi-keV spectral\nregime by using multicycle driving pulses with high pump energy in experiment.\n", "  The recent detection of gravitational waves has generated interest in\nalternatives to the black hole interpretation of sources. One set of such\nalternatives involves a prediction of gravitational wave \"echoes\". We consider\ntwo aspects of possible echoes: First, general features of echoes coming from\nspacetime reflecting conditions. We find that the detailed nature of such\nechoes does not bear any clear relationship to quasi-normal frequencies.\nSecond, we point out the pitfalls in the analysis of local reflecting \"walls\"\nnear the horizon of rapidly rotating black holes.\n", "  We describe the collective hydrodynamic motion of an incommensurate charge\ndensity wave state in a clean electronic system. Our description simultaneously\nincorporates the effects of both pinning due to weak disorder and also phase\nrelaxation due to proliferating dislocations. We show that the interplay\nbetween these two phenomena has important consequences for charge and momentum\ntransport. For instance, it can lead to metal-insulator transitions. We\nfurthermore identify signatures of fluctuating density waves in frequency and\nspatially resolved conductivities. Phase disordering is well known to lead to a\nlarge viscosity. We derive a precise formula for the phase relaxation rate in\nterms of the viscosity in the dislocation cores. We thereby determine the\nviscosity of the superconducting state of BSCCO from the observed melting\ndynamics of Abrikosov lattices and show that the result is consistent with\ndissipation into Bogoliubov quasiparticles.\n", "  A large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) is considered in the\nstrain-controlled regime, and the interrelation between the Fourier transform\n(FT) and the stress decomposition (SD) approaches is established. Several\ndefinitions of the generalized storage and loss moduli are examined in a\nunified conceptual scheme based on the Lissajous--Bowditch plots. An\nillustrative example of evaluating the generalized moduli from a LAOS flow is\ngiven.\n", "  We show that the exact solution of Einstein's equations describing a system\nof two aligned identical Kerr black holes separated by a massless strut follows\nstraightforwardly from the extended 2-soliton solution possessing equatorial\nsymmetry, and we give its concise analytic representation in terms of physical\nparameters.\n", "  The interactive computation paradigm is reviewed and a particular example is\nextended to form the stochastic analog of a computational process via a\ntranscription of a minimal Turing Machine into an equivalent asynchronous\nCellular Automaton with an exponential waiting times distribution of effective\ntransitions. Furthermore, a special toolbox for analytic derivation of\nrecursive relations of important statistical and other quantities is introduced\nin the form of an Inductive Combinatorial Hierarchy.\n", "  In many contexts it is extremely costly to perform enough high quality\nexperimental measurements to accurately parameterize a predictive quantitative\nmodel. However, it is often much easier to carry out large numbers of\nexperiments that indicate whether each sample is above or below a given\nthreshold. Can many such categorical or \"coarse\" measurements be combined with\na much smaller number of high resolution or \"fine\" measurements to yield\naccurate models? Here, we demonstrate an intuitive strategy, inspired by\nstatistical physics, wherein the coarse measurements are used to identify the\nsalient features of the data, while the fine measurements determine the\nrelative importance of these features. A linear model is inferred from the fine\nmeasurements, augmented by a quadratic term that captures the correlation\nstructure of the coarse data. We illustrate our strategy by considering the\nproblems of predicting the antimalarial potency and aqueous solubility of small\norganic molecules from their 2D molecular structure.\n", "  Limits on power dissipation have pushed CPUs to grow in parallel processing\ncapabilities rather than clock rate, leading to the rise of \"manycore\" or\nGPU-like processors. In order to achieve the best performance, applications\nmust be able to take full advantage of vector units across multiple cores, or\nsome analogous arrangement on an accelerator card. Such parallel performance is\nbecoming a critical requirement for methods to reconstruct the tracks of\ncharged particles at the Large Hadron Collider and, in the future, at the High\nLuminosity LHC. This is because the steady increase in luminosity is causing an\nexponential growth in the overall event reconstruction time, and tracking is by\nfar the most demanding task for both online and offline processing. Many past\nand present collider experiments adopted Kalman filter-based algorithms for\ntracking because of their robustness and their excellent physics performance,\nespecially for solid state detectors where material interactions play a\nsignificant role. We report on the progress of our studies towards a Kalman\nfilter track reconstruction algorithm with optimal performance on manycore\narchitectures. The combinatorial structure of these algorithms is not\nimmediately compatible with an efficient SIMD (or SIMT) implementation; the\nchallenge for us is to recast the existing software so it can readily generate\nhundreds of shared-memory threads that exploit the underlying instruction set\nof modern processors. We show how the data and associated tasks can be\norganized in a way that is conducive to both multithreading and vectorization.\nWe demonstrate very good performance on Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi architectures,\nas well as promising first results on Nvidia GPUs.\n", "  When starting with a static, spherically-symmetric ansatz, there are two\ntypes of black hole solutions in dRGT massive gravity: (i) exact Schwarzschild\nsolutions which exhibit no Yukawa suppression at large distances and (ii)\nsolutions in which the dynamical metric and the reference metric are\nsimultaneously diagonal and which inevitably exhibit coordinate-invariant\nsingularities at the horizon. In this work we investigate the possibility of\nblack hole solutions which can accommodate both a non-singular horizon and\nYukawa asymptotics. In particular, by adopting a time-dependent ansatz, we\nderive perturbative analytic solutions which possess non-singular horizons.\nThese black hole solutions are indistinguishable from Schwarzschild black holes\nin the limit of zero graviton mass. At finite graviton mass, they depend\nexplicitly on time. However, we demonstrate that the location of the apparent\nhorizon is not necessarily time-dependent, indicating that these black holes\nare not necessarily accreting or evaporating (classically). In deriving these\nresults, we also review and extend known results about static black hole\nsolutions in massive gravity.\n", "  Weak scale supersymmetry (SUSY) remains a compelling extension of the\nStandard Model because it stabilizes the quantum corrections to the Higgs and\nW, Z boson masses. In natural SUSY models these corrections are, by definition,\nnever much larger than the corresponding masses. Natural SUSY models all have\nan upper limit on the gluino mass, too high to lead to observable signals even\nat the high luminosity LHC. However, in models with gaugino mass unification,\nthe wino is sufficiently light that supersymmetry discovery is possible in\nother channels over the entire natural SUSY parameter space with no worse than\n3% fine-tuning. Here, we examine the SUSY reach in more general models with and\nwithout gaugino mass unification (specifically, natural generalized mirage\nmediation), and show that the high energy LHC (HE-LHC), a pp collider with\n\\sqrt{s}=33 TeV, will be able to detect the SUSY signal over the entire allowed\nmass range. Thus, HE-LHC would either discover or conclusively falsify natural\nSUSY with better than 3% fine-tuning using a conservative measure that allows\nfor correlations among the model parameters.\n", "  We argue that conformal invariance in flat spacetime implies Weyl invariance\nin a general curved background metric for all unitary theories in spacetime\ndimensions $d \\leq 10$. We also study possible curvature corrections to the\nWeyl transformations of operators, and show that these are absent for operators\nof sufficiently low dimensionality and spin. We find possible `anomalous' Weyl\ntransformations proportional to the Weyl (Cotton) tensor for $d > 3$ ($d = 3$).\nThe arguments are based on algebraic consistency conditions similar to the\nWess-Zumino consistency conditions that classify possible local anomalies. The\narguments can be straightforwardly extended to larger operator dimensions and\nhigher $d$ with additional algebraic complexity.\n", "  Nanomechanical devices have attracted the interest of a growing\ninterdisciplinary research community, since they can be used as highly\nsensitive transducers for various physical quantities. Exquisite control over\nthese systems facilitates experiments on the foundations of physics. Here, we\ndemonstrate that an optically trapped silicon nanorod, set into rotation at MHz\nfrequencies, can be locked to an external clock, transducing the properties of\nthe time standard to the rod's motion with the remarkable frequency stability\n$f_{\\rm r}/\\Delta f_{\\rm r}$ of $7.7 \\times 10^{11}$. While the dynamics of\nthis periodically driven rotor generally can be chaotic, we derive and verify\nthat stable limit cycles exist over a surprisingly wide parameter range. This\nrobustness should enable, in principle, measurements of external torques with\nsensitivities better than 0.25zNm, even at room temperature. We show that in a\ndilute gas, real-time phase measurements on the locked nanorod transduce\npressure values with a sensitivity of 0.3%.\n", "  Recent measurements of the Geminga and B0656+14 pulsars by the gamma-ray\ntelescope HAWC (along with earlier measurements by Milagro) indicate that these\nobjects generate significant fluxes of very high-energy electrons. In this\npaper, we use the very high-energy gamma-ray intensity and spectrum of these\npulsars to calculate and constrain their expected contributions to the local\ncosmic-ray positron spectrum. Among models that are capable of reproducing the\nobserved characteristics of the gamma-ray emission, we find that pulsars\ninvariably produce a flux of high-energy positrons that is similar in spectrum\nand magnitude to the positron fraction measured by PAMELA and AMS-02. In light\nof this result, we conclude that it is very likely that pulsars provide the\ndominant contribution to the long perplexing cosmic-ray positron excess.\n", "  The bulk self diffusion of the ethylammonium cation and the nitrate anion can\nboth be described by respective single diffusion coefficients. Diffusion of the\nanion is 1.7 times higher than that of the cation. This indicates no tight\nassociation of the ions in the ionic liquid. For the ethylammonium cation\nconfined between glass plates the effective diffusion coefficient along, as\nwell as normal to the confining glass plates is higher by a factor of 1.86 as\ncompared to that in the bulk. The same time, NMR T2 relaxation of protons of\nNH3 group of the EA cation is faster by a factor of 22 than that in bulk. 2H\nNMR spectra of selectively labeled CH2 and CH3 groups of EA do not demonstrate\nany ordering of the EA between the glass plates. We suggested that these data\nfavor a model where a bulk isotropic sponge like structure of EAN is saved in\nthe confinement, but sizes of connecting channels increases. Those leads to\nfaster translational diffusion and faster exchange processes of protons of NH3\ngroup, in comparison with the bulk.\n", "  We develop a general methodology for the inclusion of variable surface\ntension into a Volume-of-Fluid based Navier-Stokes solver. This new numerical\nmodel provides a robust and accurate method for computing the surface gradients\ndirectly by finding the tangent directions on the interface using height\nfunctions. The implementation is applicable to both temperature and\nconcentration dependent surface tension, along with the setups involving a\nlarge jump in the temperature between the fluid and its surrounding, as well as\nthe situations where the concentration should be strictly confined to the fluid\ndomain, such as the mixing of fluids with different surface tension\ncoefficients. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to thermocapillary\nmigration of bubbles and coalescence of drops characterized by different\nsurface tension.\n", "  We show that the high-energy cosmic neutrinos seen by the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory can be used to probe interactions between neutrinos and the dark\nsector that cannot be reached by current cosmological methods. The origin of\nthe observed neutrinos is still unknown, and their arrival directions are\ncompatible with an isotropic distribution. This observation, together with\ndedicated studies of Galactic plane correlations, suggest a predominantly\nextragalactic origin. Interactions between this isotropic extragalactic flux\nand the dense dark matter (DM) bulge of the Milky Way would thus lead to an\nobservable imprint on the distribution, which would be seen by IceCube as 1)\nslightly suppressed fluxes at energies below a PeV and 2) a deficit of events\nin the direction of the Galactic center. We perform an extended unbinned\nlikelihood analysis using the four-year high-energy starting event dataset to\nconstrain the strength of DM-neutrino interactions for two model classes. We\nfind that, in spite of low statistics, IceCube can probe regions of the\nparameter space inaccessible to current cosmological methods.\n", "  A measurement of the inclusive production cross section of isolated prompt\nphotons in proton-antiproton collisions at center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s}$=1.96TeV is presented. The results are obtained using the full Run II\ndata sample collected with the Collider Detector at the Fermilab Tevatron,\nwhich corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 9.5fb$^{-1}$. The cross\nsection is measured as a function of photon transverse energy, $E_T^{\\gamma}$,\nin the range 30$ < E_T^{\\gamma} <$500GeV and in the pseudorapidity region\n$|\\eta^{\\gamma}|<$1.0. The results are compared with predictions from\nparton-shower Monte Carlo models at leading order in quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD) and from next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations. The latter\nshow good agreement with the measured cross section.\n", "  Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) exhibit excellent\nelectronic and optical properties. However, the performance of these\ntwo-dimensional (2D) devices are often limited by the large resistance offered\nby the metal contact interface. Till date, the carrier injection mechanism from\nmetal to 2D TMDC layers remains unclear, with widely varying reports of\nSchottky barrier height (SBH) and contact resistance (Rc), particularly in the\nmonolayer limit. In this work, we use a combination of theory and experiments\nin Au and Ni contacted monolayer MoS2 device to conclude the following points:\n(i) the carriers are injected at the source contact through a cascade of two\npotential barriers - the barrier heights being determined by the degree of\ninteraction between the metal and the TMDC layer; (ii) the conventional\nRichardson equation becomes invalid due to the multi-dimensional nature of the\ninjection barriers, and using Bardeen-Tersoff theory, we derive the appropriate\nform of the Richardson equation that describes such composite barrier; (iii) we\npropose a novel transfer length method (TLM) based SBH extraction methodology,\nto reliably extract SBH by eliminating any confounding effect of temperature\ndependent channel resistance variation; (iv) we derive the Landauer limit of\nthe contact resistance achievable in such devices. A comparison of the limits\nwith the experimentally achieved contact resistance reveals plenty of room for\ntechnological improvements.\n", "  We study the heat transport in filamentary RRAM nano-sized devices by\ncomparing the accurate results of COMSOL modeling with simplified analytical\nmodels for two complementary mechanisms: one neglecting the radial heat\ntransfer from the filament to the insulating host, while the other describing\nthe radial transport through the dielectric in the absence of the filament heat\ntransfer. For the former, we find that the earlier assumed simplification of\nthe electrodes being ideal heat conductors is insufficient; a more adequate\napproximation is derived where the heat transport is determined by the adjacent\nproximities of the filament tips in the electrodes.We find that both\ncomplementary mechanisms overestimate the maximum temperature yet offering\nacceptable results. However, the two in parallel provide a better analytical\napproximation. In addition, we show that the Wiedemann-Franz-Lorenz law helps\nthe analysis when the Lorenz parameter is chosen from the actual data. We\npresent an approximate expression for the SET voltage possessing a high degree\nof universality and predicting that filament materials with low Lorenz numbers\ncan be good candidates for the future low set voltage devices.\n", "  SCYNet (SUSY Calculating Yield Net) is a tool for testing supersymmetric\nmodels against LHC data. It uses neural network regression for a fast\nevaluation of the profile likelihood ratio. Two neural network approaches have\nbeen developed: one network has been trained using the parameters of the\n11-dimensional phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(pMSSM-11) as an input and evaluates the corresponding profile likelihood ratio\nwithin milliseconds. It can thus be used in global pMSSM-11 fits without time\npenalty. In the second approach, the neural network has been trained using\nmodel-independent signature-related objects, such as energies and particle\nmultiplicities, which were estimated from the parameters of a given new physics\nmodel. While the calculation of the energies and particle multiplicities takes\nup computation time, the corresponding neural network is more general and can\nbe used to predict the LHC profile likelihood ratio for a wider class of new\nphysics models.\n", "  MAXI J0556-332 is the hottest transient accreting neutron star at the\nbeginning of its quiescence. A theoretical model with crustal heating indicates\nthat an additional shallow heat source of Qshallow > 6 MeV per accreted nucleon\nis required in the shallow outer crust with respect to the deeper star crust by\nconsidering the observed decline in accretion rate at the end of outburst.\nHowever, the physical source of this shallow heating is still unclear. In the\npresent investigation, we performed stellar evolutionary calculations, adopting\nthe effects of outburst behavior of the accretion rate. As a consequence, we\nfind that the quiescent light curve of MAXI J0556-332 can be well explained by\nthe nuclear energy generation due to the hot CNO cycle.\n", "  This paper deals with the design of tensorial modulated metasurfaces able to\nimplement a general radiating aperture field distribution. A new aperture\nsynthesis approach is introduced, based on local holography and variable\nimpedance modulation. In particular, it is shown that tensorial metasurfaces\ncan be used to generate general radiating distribution (phase and amplitude).\nIn addition, a step by step algorithm is presented. In order to validate the\nmethod, several solutions are presented at 20 GHz which implement aperture\ndistributions able to radiate different beams with general polarization.\n", "  Quasi-lossless and asymmetric sound transports, which are exceedingly\ndesirable in various modern physical systems, are almost based on nonlinear or\nangular-momentum biasing effects with extremely high power levels and complex\nmodulation schemes. A practical route for the steerable sound transport along\nany arbitrary acoustic pathway, especially in a 3D acoustic network, could\nrevolutionize the sound power flow and the sound communication. Here, we design\nan acoustic device consisting of a regular-tetrahedral cavity with four\ncylindrical waveguides. A smaller regular-tetrahedral solid in this cavity is\neccentrically emplaced to break its spatial symmetry. The numerical and\nexperimental results show that the sound power flow can unimpededly transport\nbetween two waveguides away from the eccentric solid within a wide frequency\nrange. Furthermore, in the vicinity of eigenmode, the sound waves from various\nwaveguides can transport to different waveguides, respectively along the\ncompressed and broadened pathways without mutually interference. Endowed with\nthese quasi-lossless and asymmetric transport characteristics, we construct a\n3D acoustic network, in which the sound power flow can flexibly propagate along\narbitrary sound pathways defined by our acoustic devices with\neccentrically-emplaced regular-tetrahedral solids.\n", "  We investigate the generation of entanglement (spin squeezing) in an\noptical-transition atomic clock through the coupling to a vacuum\nelectromagnetic field that is enhanced by an optical cavity. We show that if\neach atom is prepared in a superposition of the ground state and a long-lived\nelectronic excited state, and viewed as a spin-1/2 system, then the collective\nvacuum light shift entangles the atoms, resulting in a squeezed distribution of\nthe ensemble collective spin. This scheme reveals that even a vacuum field can\nbe a useful resource for entanglement and quantum manipulation. The method is\nsimple and robust since it requires neither the application of light nor\nprecise frequency control of the ultra-high-finesse cavity. Furthermore, the\nscheme can be used to implement two-axis twisting by rotating the spin\ndirection while coupling to the vacuum, resulting in stronger squeezing.\n", "  In this talk I discuss a supersymmetric Pati-Salam model of fermion masses\nand mixing angles which fits low energy data. The model is then extended to\ninclude an inflationary sector which is shown to be consistent with\nBicep2-Keck-Planck data. The energy scale during inflation is associated with\nthe PS symmetry breaking scale. Finally, the model is shown to be consistent\nwith the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio necessary for Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis. It turns out that only the heaviest right-handed neutrino\ndecays produce the correct sign of the baryon-to-entropy ratio. Nevertheless,\nwe obtain the observed value due to the process of instant preheating.\n", "  In this study, we investigate muon $g-2$, $R_{K^{(*)}}$, and $R_{D^{(*)}}$\nanomalies in a specific model with one doublet, one triplet, and one singlet\nscalar leptoquark (LQ). When the strict limits from the $\\ell' \\to \\ell\n\\gamma$, $\\Delta B=2$, $B_{s}\\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$, and $B^+ \\to K^+ \\nu \\bar\\nu$\nprocesses are considered, it is difficult to use one scalar LQ to explain all\nof the anomalies due to the strong correlations among the constraints and\nobservables. After ignoring the constraints and small couplings, the muon $g-2$\ncan be explained by the doublet LQ alone due to the $m_t$ enhancement, whereas\nthe measured and unexpected smaller $R_{K^{(*)}}$ requires the combined effects\nof the doublet and triplet LQs, and the $R_D$ and $R_{D^*}$ excesses depend on\nthe singlet LQ through scalar- and tensor-type interactions.\n", "  The RIT numerical relativity group is releasing a public catalog of\nblack-hole-binary waveforms. The initial release of the catalog consists of 126\nrecent simulations that include precessing and non precessing systems with mass\nratios $q=m_1/m_2$ in the range $1/6\\leq q\\leq1$. The catalog contains\ninformation about the initial data of the simulation, the waveforms\nextrapolated to infinity, as well as information about the peak luminosity and\nfinal remnant black hole properties. These waveforms can be used to\nindependently interpret gravitational wave signals from laser interferometric\ndetectors and\n", "  A sample of Coma cluster ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are modelled in the\ncontext of Extended Modified Newtonian Dynamics (EMOND) with the aim to explain\nthe large dark matter-like effect observed in these cluster galaxies.\n  We first build a model of the Coma cluster in the context of EMOND using gas\nand galaxy mass profiles from the literature. Then assuming the dynamical mass\nof the UDGs satisfies the fundamental manifold of other ellipticals, and that\nthe UDG stellar mass-to-light matches their colour, we can verify the EMOND\nformulation by comparing two predictions of the baryonic mass of UDGs.\n  We find that EMOND can explain the UDG mass, within the expected modelling\nerrors, if they lie on the fundamental manifold of ellipsoids, however, given\nthat measurements show one UDG lying off the fundamental manifold, observations\nof more UDGs are needed to confirm this assumption.\n", "  Defects between gapped boundaries provide a possible physical realization of\nprojective non-abelian braid statistics. A notable example is the projective\nMajorana/parafermion braid statistics of boundary defects in fractional quantum\nHall/topological insulator and superconductor heterostructures. In this paper,\nwe develop general theories to analyze the topological properties and\nprojective braiding of boundary defects of topological phases of matter in two\nspatial dimensions. We present commuting Hamiltonians to realize defects\nbetween gapped boundaries in any $(2+1)D$ untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theory,\nand use these to describe their topological properties such as their quantum\ndimension. By modeling the algebraic structure of boundary defects through\nmulti-fusion categories, we establish a bulk-edge correspondence between\ncertain boundary defects and symmetry defects in the bulk. Even though it is\nnot clear how to physically braid the defects, this correspondence elucidates\nthe projective braid statistics for many classes of boundary defects, both\namongst themselves and with bulk anyons. Specifically, three such classes of\nimportance to condensed matter physics/topological quantum computation are\nstudied in detail: (1) A boundary defect version of Majorana and parafermion\nzero modes, (2) a similar version of genons in bilayer theories, and (3)\nboundary defects in $\\mathfrak{D}(S_3)$.\n", "  We report on criteria to detect entanglement between the light modes of two\ncrossed optical cavities by analyzing the transverse deflection patterns of an\natomic beam. The photon exchange between the modes and the atoms occurs around\nthe overlapping nodes of associated standing waves, which generates the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) version of the Optical Stern-Gerlach (OSG) effect. In this\noptical cross-cavity setup, we show that the discrete signatures of the fields\nstates, left in the momentum distribution of the deflected atoms, may reveal\nentanglement for a certain class of two-mode states. For a single photon, we\npresent the possibility of quantifying entanglement by the rotation of the\nmomentum distribution. For a larger number of photons, we demonstrate that\nquantum interference precludes the population of specific momentum states\nrevealing maximum entanglement between the light modes.\n", "  Topological quantum pumps are topologically equivalent to the quantum Hall\nstate: In these systems, the charge pumped during each pumping cycle is\nquantized and coincides with the Chern invariant. However, differently from\nquantum Hall insulators, quantum pumps can exhibit novel phenomena such as the\nfractional quantization of the charge transport, as a consequence of their\ndistinctive symmetries in parameter space. Here, we report the analogous\nfractional quantization of the spin transport in a topological spin pump\nrealized in a one-dimensional lattice via a periodically modulated Zeeman\nfield. In the proposed model, which is a spinfull generalization of the\nHarper-Hofstadter model, the amount of spin current pumped during well-defined\nfractions of the pumping cycle is quantized as fractions of the spin Chern\nnumber. This fractional quantization of spin is topological, and is a direct\nconsequence of the additional symmetries ensuing from the commensuration of the\nperiodic field with the underlying lattice.\n", "  In numerous applications, Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography\n(FD-OCT) suffers from a limited imaging depth due to signal roll-off, a limited\nfocal range, and autocorrelation noise. Here, we propose a parallel full-field\nFD-OCT imaging method that uses a swept laser source and an area camera in\ncombination with an off-axis reference, which is incident on the camera at a\nsmall angle. As in digital off-axis holography, this angle separates\nautocorrelation signals and the complex conjugated mirror image from the actual\nsignal in Fourier space. We demonstrate that by reconstructing the signal term\nonly, this approach enables full-range imaging, i.e., it increases the imaging\ndepth by a factor of two, and removes autocorrelation artifacts. The previously\ndemonstrated techniques of inverse scattering and holoscopy can then\nnumerically extend the focal range without loss of lateral resolution or\nimaging sensitivity. The resulting, significantly enhanced measurement depth is\ndemonstrated by imaging a porcine eye over its entire depth, including cornea,\nlens, and retina. Finally, the feasibility of in vivo measurements is\ndemonstrated by imaging the living human retina.\n", "  We explore the evolution of daily returns of four major US stock market\nindices during the technology crash of 2000, and the financial crisis of\n2007-2009. Our methodology is based on topological data analysis (TDA). We use\npersistence homology to detect and quantify topological patterns that appear in\nmultidimensional time series. Using a sliding window, we extract time-dependent\npoint cloud data sets, to which we associate a topological space. We detect\ntransient loops that appear in this space, and we measure their persistence.\nThis is encoded in real-valued functions referred to as a 'persistence\nlandscapes'. We quantify the temporal changes in persistence landscapes via\ntheir $L^p$-norms. We test this procedure on multidimensional time series\ngenerated by various non-linear and non-equilibrium models. We find that, in\nthe vicinity of financial meltdowns, the $L^p$-norms exhibit strong growth\nprior to the primary peak, which ascends during a crash. Remarkably, the\naverage spectral density at low frequencies of the time series of $L^p$-norms\nof the persistence landscapes demonstrates a strong rising trend for 250\ntrading days prior to either dotcom crash on 03/10/2000, or to the Lehman\nbankruptcy on 09/15/2008. Our study suggests that TDA provides a new type of\neconometric analysis, which goes beyond the standard statistical measures. The\nmethod can be used to detect early warning signals of imminent market crashes.\nWe believe that this approach can be used beyond the analysis of financial time\nseries presented here.\n", "  We study a scenario in which the baryon asymmetry of the universe arises from\na cosmological phase transition where lepton-number is spontaneously broken. If\nthe phase transition is first order, a lepton-number asymmetry can arise at the\nbubble wall, through dynamics similar to electroweak baryogenesis, but\ninvolving right-handed neutrinos. In addition to the usual neutrinoless double\nbeta decay in nuclear experiments, the model may be probed through a variety of\n\"baryogenesis by-products,\" which include a stochastic background of\ngravitational waves created by the colliding bubbles. Depending on the model,\nother aspects may include a network of topological defects that produce their\nown gravitational waves, additional contribution to dark radiation, and a light\npseudo-Goldstone boson (majoron) as dark matter candidate.\n", "  We consider systems of agents interacting through topological interactions.\nThese have been shown to play an important part in animal andhuman behavior.\nPrecisely, the system consists of a finite number of particles characterized by\ntheir positions and velocities. At random times arandomly chosen particle, the\nfollower, adopts the velocity of its closest neighbor, the leader. We study the\nlimit of a system size going to infinityand, under the assumption of\npropagation of chaos, show that the limit kinetic equation is a non-standard\nspatial diffusion equation for the particle distribution function. We also\nstudy the case wherein the particles interact with their K closest neighbors\nand show that the correspondingkinetic equation is the same. Finally, we prove\nthat these models can be seen as a singular limit of the smooth rank-based\nmodel previously studied in [10]. The proofs are based on a combinatorial\ninterpretation of the rank as well as some concentration of measure arguments.\n", "  The electric field integral equation is a well known workhorse for obtaining\nfields scattered by a perfect electric conducting (PEC) object. As a result,\nthe nuances and challenges of solving this equation have been examined for a\nwhile. Two recent papers motivate the effort presented in this paper. Unlike\ntraditional work that uses equivalent currents defined on surfaces, recent\nresearch proposes a technique that results in well conditioned systems by\nemploying generalized Debye sources (GDS) as unknowns. In a complementary\neffort, some of us developed a method that exploits the same representation for\nboth the geometry (subdivision surface representations) and functions defined\non the geometry, also known as isogeometric analysis (IGA). The challenge in\ngeneralizing GDS method to a discretized geometry is the complexity of the\nintermediate operators. However, thanks to our earlier work on subdivision\nsurfaces, the additional smoothness of geometric representation permits\ndiscretizing these intermediate operations. In this paper, we employ both ideas\nto present a well conditioned GDS-EFIE. Here, the intermediate surface\nLaplacian is well discretized by using subdivision basis. Likewise, using\nsubdivision basis to represent the sources, results in an efficient and\naccurate IGA framework. Numerous results are presented to demonstrate the\nefficacy of the approach.\n", "  Using a three-dimensional semiclassical model, we study double ionization for\nstrongly-driven He fully accounting for magnetic field effects. For linearly\nand slightly elliptically polarized laser fields, we show that recollisions and\nthe magnetic field combined act as a gate. This gate favors more transverse -\nwith respect to the electric field - initial momenta of the tunneling electron\nthat are opposite to the propagation direction of the laser field. In the\nabsence of non-dipole effects, the transverse initial momentum is symmetric\nwith respect to zero. We find that this asymmetry in the transverse initial\nmomentum gives rise to an asymmetry in a double ionization observable. Finally,\nwe show that this asymmetry in the transverse initial momentum of the tunneling\nelectron accounts for a recently-reported unexpectedly large average sum of the\nelectron momenta parallel to the propagation direction of the laser field.\n", "  We have carried out a detailed study of scaling region using detrended\nfractal analysis test by applying different forcing likewise noise, sinusoidal,\nsquare on the floating potential fluctuations acquired under different\npressures in a DC glow discharge plasma. The transition in the dynamics is\nobserved through recurrence plot techniques which is an efficient method to\nobserve the critical regime transitions in dynamics. The complexity of the\nnonlinear fluctuation has been revealed with the help of recurrence\nquantification analysis which is a suitable tool for investigating recurrence,\nan ubiquitous feature providing a deep insight into the dynamics of real\ndynamical system. An informal test for stationarity which checks for the\ncompatibility of nonlinear approximations to the dynamics made in different\nsegments in a time series has been proposed. In case of sinusoidal, noise,\nsquare forcing applied on fluctuation acquired at P=0.12mbar only one dominant\nscaling region is observed whereas the forcing applied on fluctuation\n(P=0.004mbar) two prominent scaling regions have been explored reliably using\ndifferent forcing amplitudes indicating the signature of crossover phenomena.\nFurthermore a persistence long range behaviour has been observed in one of\nthese scaling regions. A comprehensive study of the quantifi- cation of scaling\nexponents has been carried out with the increase in amplitude and frequency of\nsinusoidal, square type of forcings. The scalings exponent is envisaged to be\nthe roughness of the time series. The method provides a single quantitative\nidea of the scaling exponent to quantify the correlation properties of a\nsignal.\n", "  We point out that unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra contain\nBerry phases obtained by acting on a primary state with conformal\ntransformations that trace a closed path on a Virasoro coadjoint orbit. These\nphases can be computed exactly thanks to the Maurer-Cartan form on the Virasoro\ngroup, and they persist after combining left- and right-moving sectors.\nThinking of Virasoro representations as particles in AdS_3 dressed with\nboundary gravitons, the Berry phases associated with Brown-Henneaux\ndiffeomorphisms provide a gravitational extension of Thomas precession.\n", "  We discuss a technique for measuring a charged particle's momentum by means\nof multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) in the MicroBooNE liquid argon time\nprojection chamber (LArTPC). This method does not require the full particle\nionization track to be contained inside of the detector volume as other track\nmomentum reconstruction methods do (range-based momentum reconstruction and\ncalorimetric momentum reconstruction). We motivate use of this technique,\ndescribe a tuning of the underlying phenomenological formula, quantify its\nperformance on fully contained beam-neutrino-induced muon tracks both in\nsimulation and in data, and quantify its performance on exiting muon tracks in\nsimulation. Using simulation, we have shown that the standard Highland formula\nshould be re-tuned specifically for scattering in liquid argon, which\nsignificantly improves the bias and resolution of the momentum measurement.\nWith the tuned formula, we find agreement between data and simulation for\ncontained tracks, with a small bias in the momentum reconstruction and with\nresolutions that vary as a function of track length, improving from about 10%\nfor the shortest (one meter long) tracks to 5% for longer (several meter)\ntracks. For simulated exiting muons with at least one meter of track contained,\nwe find a similarly small bias, and a resolution which is less than 15% for\nmuons with momentum below 2 GeV/c. Above 2 GeV/c, results are given as a first\nestimate of the MCS momentum measurement capabilities of MicroBooNE for high\nmomentum exiting tracks.\n", "  We review recent developments in the construction of heterotic and type II\nstring field theories and their various applications. These include systematic\nprocedures for determining the shifts in the vacuum expectation values of\nfields under quantum corrections, computing renormalized masses and S-matrix of\nthe theory around the shifted vacuum and a proof of unitarity of the S-matrix.\nThe S-matrix computed this way is free from all divergences when there are more\nthan 4 non-compact space-time dimensions, but suffers from the usual infrared\ndivergences when the number of non-compact space-time dimensions is 4 or less.\n", "  Relativistic quantum theory of induced scattering of 2D Dirac particles by\nelectrostatic field of impurity ion (in the Born approximation) in the doped\ngraphene at the presence of an external electromagnetic radiation field\n(actually terahertz radiation, to exclude the valence electrons excitations at\nhigh Fermi energies) has been developed. It is shown that the strong coupling\nof massless quasiparticles in the quantum nanostructures to a strong\nelectromagnetic radiation field leads to the strongly nonlinear response of\ngraphene, which opens diverse ways for manipulating the electronic transport\nproperties of conductive electrons by coherent radiation fields.\n", "  We demonstrate that a semiconductor laser perturbed by the distributed\nfeedback from a fiber random grating can emit light chaotically without the\ntime delay signature. A theoretical model is developed based on the\nLang-Kobayashi model in order to numerically explore the chaotic dynamics of\nthe laser diode subjected to the random distributed feedback. It is predicted\nthat the random distributed feedback is superior to the single reflection\nfeedback in suppressing the time-delay signature. In experiments, a massive\nnumber of feedbacks with randomly varied time delays induced by a fiber random\ngrating introduce large numbers of external cavity modes into the semiconductor\nlaser, leading to the high dimension of chaotic dynamics and thus the\nconcealment of the time delay signature. The obtained time delay signature with\nthe maximum suppression is 0.0088, which is the smallest to date.\n", "  Pair creation of spin- 1/2 particles in Minkowski spacetime is investigated\nby obtaining exact solu- tions of the Dirac equation in the presence of\nelectromagnetic fields and using them for determining the Bogoliubov\ncoefficients. The resulting particle creation number density depends on the\nstrength of the electric and magnetic fields.\n", "  Interferometers with single particles are susceptible for dephasing\nperturbations from the environment, such as electromagnetic oscillations or\nmechanical vibrations. On the one hand, this limits sensitive quantum phase\nmeasurements as it reduces the interference contrast. On the other hand, it\nenables single-particle interferometers to be used as sensitive sensors for\nelectromagnetic and mechanical perturbations. Recently, it was demonstrated\nexperimentally, that a second-order correlation analysis can decrease the\nshielding and damping requirements significantly. Thereby, the relevant\nmatter-wave characteristics and perturbation parameters could be extracted from\nthe correlation analysis of a \"washed-out\" interference pattern and the\nundisturbed interferogram could be reconstructed. This method can be applied to\nall interferometers, that produce a spatial fringe pattern on a detector with\nhigh spatial and temporal single-particle resolution. In this article, we\npresent and discuss in detail the used two-dimensional second-order correlation\ntheory for multifrequency perturbations. The derivations of an explicit and\napproximate solution of the correlation function and corresponding amplitude\nspectra are provided. It is explained, how the numerical correlation function\nis extracted from the measurement data. Thereby, the influence of the temporal\nand spatial discretization step size on the extracted parameters is analyzed.\nThe influence of noise on the correlation function and amplitude spectrum is\ncalculated and numerically cross-checked by a comparison of our theory with\nnumerical single-particle simulations. Our method can also be applied for the\nanalysis of broad-band frequency noise, dephasing the interference pattern.\nUsing Gaussian distributed noise in the simulations, we demonstrate that the\nrelevant matter-wave parameters and the applied perturbation spectrum can be\nrevealed.\n", "  We present new numerical tools to analyse cosmic void catalogues, implemented\ninside the CosmoBolognaLib, a large set of Open Source C++/Python numerical\nlibraries. The CosmoBolognaLib provides a common numerical environment for\ncosmological calculations. This work extends these libraries by adding new\nalgorithms for cosmological analyses of cosmic voids, covering the existing gap\nbetween theory and observations. We implemented new methods to model the size\nfunction of cosmic voids, in both observed and simulated samples of dark matter\nand biased tracers. Moreover, we provide new numerical tools to construct\nunambiguous void catalogues. The latter are designed to be independent of the\nvoid finder, in order to allow a high versatility in comparing independent\nresults. The implemented Open Source software is available at the GitHub\nrepository https://github.com/federicomarulli/CosmoBolognaLib. We provide also\na full doxygen documentation and some example codes that explain how to use\nthese libraries.\n", "  We extend the study of quark spin-orbit correlations in the nucleon to the\ncase of transverse polarization. At the leading-twist level, this completes the\nspin structure of the quark kinetic energy-momentum tensor. In particular, we\nrevisit the transversity decomposition of angular momentum proposed a decade\nago by Burkardt and introduce a new transverse correlation, namely between\nquark transversity and orbital angular momentum. We also provide for the first\ntime the Wandzura-Wilczek expression for the second Mellin moment of twist-3\ntransversity generalized parton distributions, along with a new sum rule. Based\non lattice calculation results, we conclude that the quark transverse\nspin-orbit correlation is negative for both up and down flavors, just like in\nthe longitudinal case.\n", "  We have experimentally identified a new magnetic ground state for the kagome\nlattice, in the perfectly hexagonal Fe2+ (3d6, S = 2) compound Fe4Si2Sn7O16.\nRepresentational symmetry analysis of neutron diffraction data shows that below\nT_N = 3.5 K, the spins on 2/3 of the magnetic ions order into canted\nantiferromagnetic chains, separated by the remaining 1/3 which are\ngeometrically frustrated and show no long-range order down to at least T = 0.1\nK. Moessbauer spectroscopy confirms that there is no static order on the latter\n1/3 of the magnetic ions - i.e., they are in a liquid-like rather than a frozen\nstate - down to at least 1.65 K. A heavily Mn-doped sample\nFe1.45Mn2.55Si2Sn7O16 has the same magnetic structure. Although the propagation\nvector q = (0, 1/2 , 1/2 ) breaks hexagonal symmetry, we see no evidence for\nmagnetostriction in the form of a lattice distortion within the resolution of\nour data. We discuss the relationship to partially frustrated magnetic order on\nthe pyrochlore lattice of Gd2Ti2O7, and to theoretical models that predict\nsymmetry breaking ground states for perfect kagome lattices.\n", "  We investigate a weak version of subsystem eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis (ETH) for a two-dimensional large central charge conformal field\ntheory by comparing the local equivalence of high energy state and thermal\nstate of canonical ensemble. We evaluate the single-interval R\\'enyi entropy\nand entanglement entropy for a heavy primary state in short interval expansion.\nWe verify the results of R\\'enyi entropy by two different replica methods. We\nfind nontrivial results at the eighth order of short interval expansion, which\ninclude an infinite number of higher order terms in the large central charge\nexpansion. We then evaluate the relative entropy of the reduced density\nmatrices to measure the difference between the heavy primary state and thermal\nstate of canonical ensemble, and find that the aforementioned nontrivial eighth\norder results make the relative entropy unsuppressed in the large central\ncharge limit. By using Pinsker's and Fannes-Audenaert inequalities, we can\nexploit the results of relative entropy to yield the lower and upper bounds on\ntrace distance of the excited-state and thermal-state reduced density matrices.\nOur results are consistent with subsystem weak ETH, which requires the above\ntrace distance is of power-law suppression by the large central charge.\nHowever, we are unable to pin down the exponent of power-law suppression. As a\nbyproduct we also calculate the relative entropy to measure the difference\nbetween the reduced density matrices of two different heavy primary states.\n", "  We revisit the notion of quantum Lie algebra of symmetries of a\nnoncommutative spacetime, its elements are shown to be the generators of\ninfinitesimal transformations and are naturally identified with physical\nobservables. Wave equations on noncommutative spaces are derived from a quantum\nHodge star operator. This general noncommutative geometry construction is then\nexemplified in the case of k-Minkowski spacetime. The corresponding quantum\nPoincare'-Weyl Lie algebra of infinitesimal translations, rotations and\ndilatations is obtained. The d'Alembert wave operator coincides with the\nquadratic Casimir of quantum translations and it is deformed as in Deformed\nSpecial Relativity theories. Also momenta (infinitesimal quantum translations)\nare deformed, and correspondingly the Einstein-Planck relation and the de\nBroglie one. The energy-momentum relations (dispersion relations) are\nconsequently deduced. These results complement those of the phenomenological\nliterature on the subject.\n", "  Follow-up observations at high-angular resolution of submillimeter galaxies\nshowed that the single-dish sources are comprised of a blend of several\ngalaxies. Consequently, number counts derived from low and high angular\nresolution observations are in disagreement. This demonstrates the importance\nof resolution effects and the need to have realistic simulations to explore\nthem. We built a new 2deg^2 simulation of the extragalactic sky from the\nfar-infrared to the submillimeter. It is based on an updated version of the two\nstar-formation mode galaxy evolution model. Using global galaxy properties, we\nuse the abundance matching technique to populate a dark-matter lightcone and\nthus simulate the clustering. We produce maps and extract the sources, and show\nthat the limited angular resolution of single-dish instruments have a strong\nimpact on (sub)millimeter continuum observations. Taking into account these\nresolution effects, we are reproducing a large set of observables, including\nnumber counts, redshift distributions, and cosmic infrared background power\nspectra. Our simulation describes consistently the number counts from\nsingle-dish telescopes and interferometers. In particular, at 350 and 500 um,\nwe find that number counts measured by Herschel between 5 and 50 mJy are biased\ntowards high values by a factor 2, and that redshift distributions are biased\ntowards low z. We also show that the clustering has an important impact on the\nHerschel pixel histogram used to derive number counts from P(D) analysis.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the large number density of red Herschel sources\nfound in observations but not in models could be an observational artifact\ncaused by the combination of noise, resolution effects, and the steepness of\ncolor and flux density distributions. Our simulation (SIDES) is available at\nhttp://cesam.lam.fr/sides\n", "  This is a review of the results on black hole physics in the framework of\nloop quantum gravity. The key feature underlying the results is the\ndiscreteness of geometric quantities at the Planck scale predicted by this\napproach to quantum gravity. Quantum discreteness follows directly from the\ncanonical quantization prescription when applied to the action of general\nrelativity that is suitable for the coupling of gravity with gauge fields and\nspecially with fermions. Planckian discreteness and causal considerations\nprovide the basic structure for the understanding of the thermal properties of\nblack holes close to equilibrium. Discreteness also provides a fresh new look\nat more (at the moment) speculative issues such as those concerning the fate of\ninformation in black hole evaporation. The hypothesis of discreteness leads\nalso to interesting phenomenology with possible observational consequences. The\ntheory of loop quantum gravity is a developing program. This review reports its\nachievements and open questions in a pedagogical manner with an emphasis on\nquantum aspects of black hole physics.\n", "  We study topological defects in anisotropic ferromagnets with competing\ninteractions near the Lifshitz point. We show that skyrmions and bi-merons are\nstable in a large part of the phase diagram. We calculate skyrmion-skyrmion and\nmeron-meron interactions and show that skyrmions attract each other and form\nring-shaped bound states in a zero magnetic field. At the Lifshitz point merons\ncarrying a fractional topological charge become deconfined. These results imply\nthat unusual topological excitations may exist in weakly frustrated magnets\nwith conventional crystal lattices.\n", "  M2 branes probing T-brane backgrounds in M-theory with ADE surface\nsingularities perceive deformations on their worldvolume superpotentials by\nmonopole operators. The dynamics and moduli spaces of the resulting theories\ncan be studied using a dual description involving conventional superpotential\nterms and (the dimensional reduction of) class S trinion theories. By using the\nS-dual description of N=2 SU(N) SQCD with 2N flavors in four dimensions, we are\nable to study T-branes corresponding to all minimal nilpotent orbits for the\nwhole ADE series. Our proposed dualities are supported by the match in squashed\nsphere partition functions.\n", "  In applications of Einstein gravity one replaces the quantum-mechanical\nenergy-momentum tensor of sources such as the degenerate electrons in a white\ndwarf or the black-body photons in the microwave background by c-number matrix\nelements. And not only that, one ignores the zero-point fluctuations in these\nsources by only retaining the normal-ordered parts of those matrix elements.\nThere is no apparent justification for this procedure, and we show that it is\nprecisely this procedure that leads to the cosmological constant problem. We\nsuggest that solving the problem requires that gravity be treated just as\nquantum-mechanically as the sources to which it couples, and show that one can\nthen solve the cosmological constant problem if one replaces Einstein gravity\nby the fully quantum-mechanically consistent conformal gravity theory.\n", "  The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) is considered as a measure of quantum\nchaos. We formulate how to calculate the OTOC for quantum mechanics with a\ngeneral Hamiltonian. We demonstrate explicit calculations of OTOCs for a\nharmonic oscillator, a particle in a one-dimensional box, a circle billiard and\nstadium billiards. For the first two cases, OTOCs are periodic in time because\nof their commensurable energy spectra. For the circle and stadium billiards,\nthey are not recursive but saturate to constant values which are linear in\ntemperature. Although the stadium billiard is a typical example of the\nclassical chaos, an expected exponential growth of the OTOC is not found. We\nalso discuss the classical limit of the OTOC. Analysis of a time evolution of a\nwavepacket in a box shows that the OTOC can deviate from its classical value at\na time much earlier than the Ehrenfest time.\n", "  The design and production of novel 2-dimensional materials has seen great\nprogress in the last decade, prompting further exploration of the chemistry of\nsuch materials. Doping and hydrogenating graphene is an experimentally realised\nmethod of changing its surface chemistry, but there is still a great deal to be\nunderstood on how doping impacts on the adsorption of molecules. Developing\nthis understanding is key to unlocking the potential applications of these\nmaterials. High throughput screening methods can provide particularly effective\nways to explore vast chemical compositions of materials. Here, alchemical\nderivatives are used as a method to screen the dissociative adsorption energy\nof water molecules on various BN doped topologies of hydrogenated graphene. The\npredictions from alchemical derivatives are assessed by comparison to density\nfunctional theory. This screening method is found to predict dissociative\nadsorption energies that span a range of more than 2 eV, with a mean absolute\nerror $<0.1$ eV. In addition, we show that the quality of such predictions can\nbe readily assessed by examination of the Kohn-Sham highest occupied molecular\norbital in the initial states. In this way, the root mean square error in the\ndissociative adsorption energies of water is reduced by almost an order of\nmagnitude (down to $\\sim0.02$ eV) after filtering out poor predictions. The\nfindings point the way towards a reliable use of first order alchemical\nderivatives for efficient screening procedures.\n", "  We put forward a new proposal for generating the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse by making use of the dynamics of a $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ scalar field\ncoupled to dark matter. High dark matter densities cause the $\\mathrm{U}(1)$\nsymmetry to break spontaneously so that the field acquires a large vacuum\nexpectation value. The symmetry is restored when the density redshifts below a\ncritical value, resulting in the coherent oscillation of the scalar field. A\nnet $B-L$ number can be generated either via baryon number-conserving couplings\nto the standard model or through small symmetry-violating operators and the\nsubsequent decay of the scalar condensate.\n", "  A new derivation of surface charges for 3+1 gravity coupled to\nElectromagnetism is obtained. Gravity theory is written in the\ntetrad-connection variables. The general derivation starts from the Lagrangian\nand uses the covariant symplectic formalism in the language of forms. For gauge\ntheories surface charges disentangle physical from gauge symmetries through the\nuse of Noether identities and the exactness symmetry condition. The surface\ncharges are quasilocal, explicitly coordinate independent, gauge invariant, and\nbackground independent. For a black hole family solution the surface charge\nconservation implies the first law of black hole mechanics. As a check we show\nthe first law for black hole electrically charged, rotating, and with an\nasymptotically constant curvature (the Kerr-Newman (anti-)de Sitter family).\nThe charges, including the would-be mass term appearing in the first law, are\nquasilocal. It is not required a reference to the asymptotic structure of the\nspacetime nor boundary conditions, and therefore topological terms do not play\na r\\^ole. Finally, surface charges formulae for Lovelock gravity coupled to\nElectromagnetism are exhibited. It generalizes the one derived in a recent work\nby G. Barnich, P. Mao, and R. Ruzziconi. The two different symplectic methods\nto define surface charges are compared and shown equivalent.\n", "  The lack of evidence for weak scale supersymmetry from LHC Run-I and Run-II\nresults along with null results from direct/indirect dark matter detection\nexperiment have caused a paradigm shift in expected phenomenology of SUSY\nmodels. The SUSY dark matter candidate, neutralino $\\widetilde{Z}_1$, can only\nsatisfy the measured dark matter abundance due to resonance- and\nco-annihilations in cMSSM model. Moreover, viable parameter space is highly\nfine-tuned in the cMSSM. In models that can still satisfy the naturalness\ncondition such as NUHM2, the neutralino is underproduced due to its higgsino\nnature. Neutralino combined with axion that solves the strong CP problem can\nexplain the observed dark matter in the universe. Here I briefly discuss\nimplications of the mixed axion-neutralino scenario.\n", "  Quantum entanglement occurs not just in discrete systems such as spins, but\nalso in the spatial wave functions of systems with more than one degree of\nfreedom. It is easy to introduce students to entangled wave functions at an\nearly stage, in any course that discusses wave functions. Doing so not only\nprepares students to learn about Bell's theorem and quantum information\nscience, but can also provide a deeper understanding of the principles of\nquantum mechanics and help fight against some common misconceptions. Here I\nintroduce several pictorial examples of entangled wave functions that depend on\njust two spatial variables. I also show how such wave functions can arise\ndynamically, and describe how to quantify their entanglement.\n", "  Successful doping of single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)\nremains a formidable barrier to their incorporation into a range of\ntechnologies. We use density functional theory to study doping of molybdenum\nand tungsten dichalcogenides with a large fraction of the periodic table. An\nautomated analysis of the energetics, atomic and electronic structure of\nthousands of calculations results in insightful trends across the periodic\ntable and points out promising dopants to be pursued experimentally. Beyond\npreviously studied cases, our predictions suggest promising substitutional\ndopants that result in p-type transport and reveal interesting physics behind\nthe substitution of the metal site. Doping with early transition metals (TMs)\nleads to tensile strain and a significant reduction in the bandgap. The bandgap\nincreases and strain is reduced as the d-states are filled into the mid TMs;\nthese trends reverse are we move into the late TMs. Additionally, the Fermi\nenergy increases monotonously as the d-shell is filled from the early to mid\nTMs and we observe few to no gap states indicating the possibility of both p-\n(early TMs) and n- (mid TMs) type doping. Quite surprisingly, the simulations\nindicate the possibility of interstitial doping of TMDs; the energetics reveal\nthat a significant number of dopants, increasing in number from molybdenum\ndisulfide to diselenide and to ditelluride, favor the interstitial sites over\nadsorbed ones. Furthermore, calculations of the activation energy associated\nwith capturing the dopants into the interstitial site indicate that the process\nis kinetically possible. This suggets that interstitial impurities in TMDs are\nmore common than thought to date and we propose a series of potential\ninterstitial dopants for TMDs relevant for application in nanoelectronics based\non a detailed analysis of the predicted electronic structures.\n", "  We present a new method for reconstructing CFT duals of states excited by the\nbulk local operators in the three dimensional AdS black holes in the AdS/CFT\ncontext. As an important procedure for this, we introduce a map between the\nbulk points in AdS and those on the boundary where CFT lives. This gives a\nsystematic and universal way to express bulk local states even inside black\nhole interiors. Our construction allows us to probe the interior structures of\nblack holes purely from the CFT calculations. We analyze bulk local states in\nthe single-sided black holes as well as the double-sided black holes.\n", "  We argue in a model-independent way that the Hilbert space of quantum gravity\nis locally finite-dimensional. In other words, the density operator describing\nthe state corresponding to a small region of space, when such a notion makes\nsense, is defined on a finite-dimensional factor of a larger Hilbert space.\nBecause quantum gravity potentially describes superpo- sitions of different\ngeometries, it is crucial that we associate Hilbert-space factors with spatial\nregions only on individual decohered branches of the universal wave function.\nWe discuss some implications of this claim, including the fact that quantum\nfield theory cannot be a fundamental description of Nature.\n", "  We provide general arguments regarding the connection between low-energy\ntheories (gravity and quantum field theory) and a hypothetical fundamental\ntheory of quantum gravity, under the assumptions of (i) validity of the\nholographic bound and (ii) preservation of unitary evolution at the level of\nthe fundamental theory. In particular, the appeal to the holographic bound\nimposed on generic physical systems by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy implies\nthat both classical geometry and quantum fields propagating on it should be\nregarded as phenomena emergent from the dynamics of the fundamental theory. The\nreshuffling of the fundamental degrees of freedom during the unitary evolution\nthen leads to an entanglement between geometry and quantum fields. The\nconsequences of such scenario are considered in the context of black hole\nevaporation and the related information-loss issue: we provide a simplistic toy\nmodel in which an average loss of information is obtained as a consequence of\nthe geometry-field entanglement.\n", "  Supermassive stars (SMSs) of mass $\\gtrsim 10^5 M_\\odot$ are candidates for\nseeds of supermassive black holes found in the center of many massive galaxies.\nWe simulate the gravitational collapse of a rigidly rotating SMS core including\nnuclear burning effects in axisymmetric numerical-relativity simulation. We\nfind that for realistic initial conditions, the nuclear burning does not play\nan important role. After the collapse, a torus surrounding a rotating black\nhole is formed and a fraction of the torus material is ejected. We\nquantitatively study the relation between the properties of these objects and\nrotation. We find that if a SMS core is sufficiently rapidly rotating, the\ntorus and outflow mass have approximately $6\\%$ and $1\\%$ of the initial mass,\nrespectively. The typical average velocity and the total kinetic energy of the\noutflow are $0.2~c$ and $10^{54-56}$ erg where $c$ is the speed of light.\nFinally, we briefly discuss the possibility for observing the torus and\noutflow.\n", "  We consider the description of reggeon amplitudes (Wilson lines form factors)\nin N=4 SYM within the framework of four dimensional ambitwistor string theory.\nThe latter is used to derive scattering equations representation for reggeon\namplitudes with multiple reggeized gluons present. It is shown, that\ncorresponding tree-level string correlation function correctly reproduces\npreviously obtained Grassmannian integral representation of reggeon amplitudes\nin N=4 SYM.\n", "  We use inelastic light scattering to study Sr$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$\n($x\\approx0.34$), which exhibits a robust tetragonal magnetic phase that\nrestores the four-fold rotation symmetry inside the orthorhombic magnetic\nphase. With cooling, we observe splitting and recombination of an $E_g$ phonon\npeak upon entering the orthorhombic and tetragonal magnetic phases,\nrespectively, consistent with the reentrant phase behavior. Our electronic\nRaman data reveal a pronounced feature that is clearly associated with the\ntetragonal magnetic phase, suggesting the opening of an electronic gap. No\nphonon back-folding behavior can be detected above the noise level, which\nimplies that any lattice translation symmetry breaking in the tetragonal\nmagnetic phase must be very weak.\n", "  We investigate the mass range of the quark-antiquark fluctuations of the\nphoton that are active in producing the total photoabsorption cross section in\nthe color dipole picture, emphasizing the notion of color transparency and\nsaturation. We consider the implications of measurements at future extensions\nof the available electron-proton-scattering energy.\n", "  The multiplicative Hamiltonian flow on the phase space for a system with 1\ndegree of freedom was constituted from infinite hierarchy Hamiltonian flows. A\nnew type of canonical transformation associated with the multiplicative\nHamiltonian was found and called the {\\lambda}- extended class of the standard\ncanonical transformations.\n", "  The quantum Hall effects in the sliding bilayer graphene and AAB-stacked\ntrilayer system are investigated by the Kubo formula and the generalized\ntight-binding model. The various stacking configurations can greatly diversify\nthe magnetic quantization and thus create the rich and unique transport\nproperties. The quantum conductivities are very sensitive to the Fermi energy\nand magnetic-field strength. The diverse features cover the specific\nnon-integer conductivities, the integer conductivities with the distinct steps,\nthe splitting-created reduction and complexity of quantum conductivity, a\nvanishing or non-zero conductivity at the neutral point, and the well-like,\nstaircase, composite, and abnormal plateau structures in the\nfield-dependencies. Such stacking-dependent characteristics mainly originate\nfrom the crossing, anticrossing and splitting Landau-level energy spectra and\nthree kinds of quantized modes.\n", "  A sound source was proposed for acoustic measurements of physical models of\nthe human vocal tract. The physical models are produced by Fast Prototyping,\nbased on Magnetic Resonance Imaging during prolonged vowel production. The\nsound source, accompanied by custom signal processing algorithms, is used for\ntwo kinds of measurements: (i) amplitude frequency response and resonant\nfrequency measurements of physical models, and (ii) signal reconstructions at\nthe source output according to a target waveform with measurements at the mouth\nposition of the physical model. The proposed source and the software are\nvalidated by measurements on a physical model of the vocal tract corresponding\nto vowel [a] of a male speaker.\n", "  We study scenarios in which the baryon asymmetry is generated from the decay\nof a particle whose mass originates from the spontaneous breakdown of a\nsymmetry. This is realized in many models, including low-scale leptogenesis and\ntheories with classical scale invariance. Symmetry breaking in the early\nuniverse proceeds through a phase transition that gives the parent particle a\ntime-dependent mass, which provides an additional departure from thermal\nequilibrium that could modify the efficiency of baryogenesis from\nout-of-equilibrium decays. We characterize the effects of various types of\nphase transitions and show that an enhancement in the baryon asymmetry from\ndecays is possible if the phase transition is of the second order, although\nsuch models are typically fine-tuned. We also stress the role of new\nannihilation modes that deplete the parent particle abundance in models\nrealizing such a phase transition, reducing the efficacy of baryogenesis. A\nproper treatment of baryogenesis in such models therefore requires the\ninclusion of the effects we study in this paper.\n", "  Just as photons are the quanta of light, plasmons are the quanta of\norchestrated charge-density oscillations in conducting media. Plasmon phenomena\nin normal metals, superconductors and doped semiconductors are often driven by\nlong-wavelength Coulomb interactions. However, in crystals whose Fermi surface\nis comprised of disconnected pockets in the Brillouin zone, collective electron\nexcitations can also attain a shortwave component when electrons transition\nbetween these pockets. Here, we show that the band structure of monolayer\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides gives rise to an intriguing mechanism through\nwhich shortwave plasmons are paired up with excitons. The coupling elucidates\nthe origin for the optical side band that is observed repeatedly in monolayers\nof WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ but not understood. The theory makes it clear why\nexciton-plasmon coupling has the right conditions to manifest itself distinctly\nonly in the optical spectra of electron-doped tungsten-based monolayers.\n", "  Recent upgrades in H-1 power supplies have enabled the operation of the H-1\nexperiment at higher heating powers than previously attainable. A heating power\nscan in mixed hydrogen/helium plasmas reveals a change in mode activity with\nincreasing heating power. At low power (<50 kW) modes with beta-induced Alfven\neigenmode (BAE) frequency scaling are observed. At higher power modes\nconsistent with an analysis of nonconventional Global Alfven Eigenmodes (GAEs)\nare observed, the subject of this work. We have computed the mode continuum,\nand identified GAE structures using the ideal MHD solver CKA and the\ngyrokinetic code EUTERPE. An analytic model for ICRH-heated minority ions is\nused to estimate the fast ion temperature from the hydrogen species. Linear\ngrowth rate scans using a local flux surface stability calculation, LGRO, are\nperformed. These studies demonstrate growth from circulating particles whose\nspeed is significantly less than the Alfven speed, and are resonant with the\nmode through harmonics of the Fourier decomposition of the strongly-shaped\nheliac magnetic field. They reveal drive is possible with a small, hot\nenergetic tail of the hydrogen species. Local linear growth rate scans are also\ncomplemented with global calculations from CKA and EUTERPE. These qualitatively\nconfirm the findings from the LGRO study, and show that the inclusion of finite\nLarmor radius effects can reduce the growth rate by a factor of three, but do\nnot affect marginal stability. Finally, a study of damping of the global mode\nwith the thermal plasma is conducted, computing continuum, and the damping\narising from parallel electric fields. We find that continuum damping is of\norder 0.1% for the configuration studied. The inclusion of resistivity lifts\nthe damping to 19%. Such large damping is consistent with experimental\nobservations that in absence of drive the mode decays rapidly (~0.1 ms).\n", "  We show the localization transition and its effect on two dynamical processes\nfor an extended Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper model with incommensurate on-site and\nhopping potentials. After specifying an extended Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper model, we\ncheck the localization transition for all the eigenstates and eigenenergy band\nsplitting behavior versus a system parameter. To examine the effect of\nlocalization transition on dynamical processes, firstly, the slowly pumping of\nthe edge states are examined. In the dynamical processes, the system acts as\nconductor for the excitation in the nonlocal region and insulator in the\nlocalized region. Then by quantum Lyapunov control method with different\ncontrol Hamiltonians, we prepare an edge localized state which exists in the\nnonlocal region. Compared to that in the nonlocal region, the control effect is\nsuppressed in the localized region. Then we employ the entropy and occupation\nimbalance between even and odd sites to indicate the localization transition\nfurther. Finally, the experimental schemes based on cold atoms trapped\nquasiperiodic optical lattice and coupled optical waveguide arrays are\nsuggested.\n", "  We investigate the operator content of the Q-state Potts model in arbitrary\ndimension, using the representation theory of the symmetric group. In\nparticular we construct all possible tensors acting on N spins, corresponding\nto given symmetries under $S_Q$ and $S_N$, in terms of representations\ninvolving any Young diagram. These operators transform non-trivially under the\ngroup of spatial rotations, with a definite conformal spin. The two-point\ncorrelation functions are then computed, and their physical interpretation is\ngiven in terms of Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters propagating between two\nneighbourhoods of each N spins. In two dimensions, we obtain analytically the\ncritical exponent corresponding to each operator. In the simplest and\nphysically most relevant cases, we confirm the values of the critical exponent\nand the conformal spin by numerical measurements, using both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and transfer matrix diagonalisations. Our classification partially\nprovides the structure of Jordan cells of the dilatation operator in arbitrary\ndimensions, which in turn gives rise to logarithmic correlation functions.\n", "  The technique of propagating spin wave spectroscopy is applied to a 20 nm\nthick Fe/MgO (001) film. The magnetic parameters extracted from the position of\nthe resonance peaks are very close to those tabulated for bulk iron. From the\npropagating waveforms, a group velocity of 4 km/s and an attenuation length of\nabout 6 micrometers are extracted for 1.6 micrometers-wavelength spin-wave at\n18 GHz. From the measured current-induced spin-wave Doppler shift, we also\nextract a surprisingly high degree of spin-polarization of the current of 83%.\nThis set of results makes single-crystalline iron a promising candidate for\nbuilding devices utilizing high frequency spin-waves and spin-polarized\ncurrents.\n", "  We develop an optical tweezers system using a single dual-mode optical fiber\nwhere mesoscopic absorbing particles can be trapped in three dimensions and\nmanipulated employing photophoretic forces. We generate a superposition of\nfundamental and first order Hermite-Gaussian beam modes by the simple\ninnovation of coupling a laser into a commercial optical fiber designed to be\nsingle mode for a wavelength higher than that of the laser. We achieve robust\ntrapping of the absorbing particles for hours using both the pure fundamental\nand superposition mode beams and attain large manipulation velocities of ~5\nmm/s in the axial direction and ~0.75 mm/s in the radial direction. We then\ndemonstrate that the superposition mode is more effective in trapping and\nmanipulation compared to the fundamental mode by around 80%, which may be\nincreased several times by the use of a pure first order Hermite-Gaussian mode.\nThe work has promising implications for trapping and spectroscopy of aerosols\nin air using simple optical fiber-based traps.\n", "  Mobile impurity atoms immersed in Bose-Einstein condensates provide a new\nplatform for exploring Bose polarons. Recent experimental advances in the field\nof ultracold atoms make it possible to realize such systems with highly tunable\nmicroscopic parameters and to explore equilibrium and dynamical properties of\npolarons using a rich toolbox of atomic physics. In this paper we present a\ndetailed theoretical analysis of Bose polarons in one dimensional systems of\nultracold atoms. By combining a non-perturbative renormalization group approach\nwith numerically exact diffusion Monte Carlo calculations we obtain not only\ndetailed numerical results over a broad range of parameters but also\nqualitative understanding of different regimes of the system. We find that an\naccurate description of Bose polarons requires the inclusion of two-phonon\nscattering terms which go beyond the commonly used Fr\\\"ohlich model.\nFurthermore we show that when the Bose gas is in the strongly interacting\nregime, one needs to include interactions between the phonon modes. We use\nseveral theoretical approaches to calculate the polaron energy and its\neffective mass. The former can be measured using radio-frequency spectroscopy\nand the latter can be studied experimentally using impurity oscillations in a\nharmonic trapping potential. We compare our theoretical results for the\neffective mass to the experiments by Catani et al. [PRA 85, 023623 (2012)]. In\nthe weak-to-intermediate coupling regimes we obtain excellent quantitative\nagreement between theory and experiment, without any free fitting parameter. We\nsupplement our analysis by full dynamical simulations of polaron oscillations\nin a shallow trapping potential. We also use our renormalization group approach\nto analyze the full phase diagram and identify regions that support repulsive\nand attractive polarons, as well as multi-particle bound states.\n", "  We explore statistical characteristics of avalanches associated with the\ndynamics of a complex-network model, where two modules corresponding to\nsensorial and symbolic memories interact, representing unconscious and\nconscious mental processes. The model illustrates Freud's ideas regarding the\nneuroses and that consciousness is related with symbolic and linguistic memory\nactivity in the brain. It incorporates the Stariolo-Tsallis generalization of\nthe Boltzmann Machine in order to model memory retrieval and associativity. In\nthe present work, we define and measure avalanche size distributions during\nmemory retrieval, in order to gain insight regarding basic aspects of the\nfunctioning of these complex networks. The avalanche sizes defined for our\nmodel should be related to the time consumed and also to the size of the\nneuronal region which is activated, during memory retrieval. This allows the\nqualitative comparison of the behaviour of the distribution of cluster sizes,\nobtained during fMRI measurements of the propagation of signals in the brain,\nwith the distribution of avalanche sizes obtained in our simulation\nexperiments. This comparison corroborates the indication that the Nonextensive\nStatistical Mechanics formalism may indeed be more well suited to model the\ncomplex networks which constitute brain and mental structure.\n", "  Single molecule magnets (SMMs) with single-ion anisotropies $\\mathbf d$,\ncomparable to exchange interactions J, between spins have recently been\nsynthesized. In this paper, we provide theoretical insights into the magnetism\nof such systems. We study spin chains with site spins, s=1, 3/2 and 2 and\non-site anisotropy $\\mathbf d$ comparable to the exchange constants between the\nspins. We find that large $\\mathbf d$ leads to crossing of the states with\ndifferent $M_S$ values in the same spin manifold of the $\\mathbf d = 0$ limit.\nFor very large $\\mathbf d$'s we also find that the $M_S$ states of the higher\nenergy spin states descend below the $M_S$ states of the ground state spin\nmanifold. Total spin in this limit is no longer conserved and describing the\nmolecular anisotropy by the constants $D_M$ and $E_M$ is not possible. However,\nthe total spin of the low-lying large $M_S$ states is very nearly an integer\nand using this spin value it is possible to construct an effective spin\nHamiltonian and compute the molecular magnetic anisotropy constants $D_M$ and\n$E_M$. We report effect of finite sizes, rotations of site anisotropies and\nchain dimerization on the effective anisotropy of the spin chains.\n", "  The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in hydrodynamic effects\nin interacting electron systems in ultra-pure materials. In this paper we\nbriefly review the recent advances, both theoretical and experimental, in the\nhydrodynamic approach to electronic transport in graphene, focusing on viscous\nphenomena, Coulomb drag, non-local transport measurements, and possibilities\nfor observing nonlinear effects.\n", "  We present results on the deposition and characterization of defected\ngraphene by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The source of\ncarbon/carbon-containing radicals is thermally decomposed acetone (C2H6CO) in\nAr main gas flow. The deposition takes place on (001) Si substrates at about\n1150-11600C. We established by Raman spectroscopy the presence of single- to\nfew- layered defected graphene deposited on two types of interlayers that\npossess different surface morphology and consisted of mixed sp2 and sp3\nhybridized carbon. The study of interlayers by XPS, XRD, GIXRD and SEM\nidentifies different phase composition: i) a diamond-like carbon dominated film\nconsisting some residual SiC, SiO2 etc.; ii) a sp2- dominated film consisting\nsmall quantities of C60/C70 fullerenes and residual Si-O-, C=O etc. species.\nThe polarized Raman studies confirm the presence of many single-layered\ndefected graphene areas that are larger than few microns in size on the\npredominantly amorphous carbon interlayers.\n", "  The critical behavior of the random field $O(N)$ model driven at a uniform\nvelocity is investigated at zero-temperature. From naive phenomenological\narguments, we introduce a dimensional reduction property, which relates the\nlarge-scale behavior of the $D$-dimensional driven random field $O(N)$ model to\nthat of the $(D-1)$-dimensional pure $O(N)$ model. This is an analogue of the\ndimensional reduction property in equilibrium cases, which states that the\nlarge-scale behavior of $D$-dimensional random field models is identical to\nthat of $(D-2)$-dimensional pure models. However, the dimensional reduction\nproperty breaks down in low enough dimensions due to the presence of multiple\nmeta-stable states. By employing the non-perturbative renormalization group\napproach, we calculate the critical exponents of the driven random field $O(N)$\nmodel near three-dimensions and determine the range of $N$ in which the\ndimensional reduction breaks down.\n", "  The Quasi-diagonal Direct Interaction Approximation (QDIA) closure equations\nare formulated for inhomogeneous classical and quantum fields interacting\nthrough dynamical equations with quadratic nonlinearity and with first or\nsecond order time derivatives. Associated more complex inhomogeneous DIA and\nSelf-Energy closure equations are expounded as part of the derivation. The QDIA\nemploys a bare vertex approximation and is only a few times more\ncomputationally intensive than the homogeneous DIA. Examples of applications to\nturbulent classical geophysical and Navier Stokes fluids, including\nnon-Gaussian noise, to classical and quantum Klein Gordon equations with g\nphi^3 Lagrangian interaction, and to coupled field-auxiliary field equations\nassociated lambda phi^4 Lagrangian interaction, are presented.\n", "  We briefly review numerical methods for calculations beyond one loop and then\ndescribe new developments within the method of sector decomposition in more\ndetail. We also discuss applications to two-loop integrals involving several\nmass scales.\n", "  We investigate the behaviour of hard-core bosons in one- and two-dimensional\nflat band systems, the chequerboard and the kagom\\'e lattice and\none-dimensional analogues thereof. The one dimensional systems have an exact\nlocal reflection symmetry which allows for exact results. We show that above\nthe critical density an additional particle forms a pair with one of the other\nbosons and that the pair is localised. In the two-dimensional systems exact\nresults are not available but variational results indicate a similar physical\nbehaviour.\n", "  We calculate the nonrelativistic scattering of a wavepacket from a Coulomb\npotential and find deviations from the Rutherford formula in all cases. These\ngenerally occur only at low scattering angles, where they would be obscured by\nthe part of the incident beam that emerges essentially unscattered. For a model\nexperiment, the scattering of helium nuclei from a thin gold foil, we find the\ndeviation region is magnified for low incident energies (in the keV range), so\nthat a large shadow zone of low probability around the forward direction is\nexpected to be measurable.\n  From a theoretical perspective, the use of wavepackets makes partial wave\nanalysis applicable to this infinite-range potential. It allows us to calculate\nthe everywhere finite probability for a wavepacket to wavepacket transition and\nto relate this to the differential cross section. Time delays and advancements\nin the detection probabilities can be calculated. We investigate the optical\ntheorem as applied to this special case.\n", "  We present the results of our calculations of the parity nonconserving\nelectric dipole amplitudes ($E1_{PNC}$) for the $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} - 5d ~\n^2D_{3/2;5/2}$ transitions of $^{133}$Cs employing a relativistic\ncoupled-cluster (RCC) method. $E1_{PNC}$ values for the nuclear spin\nindependent (NSI) and nuclear spin dependent (NSD) parity non-conservation\n(PNC) effects for different hyperfine levels of the $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} - 5d ~\n^2D_{3/2}$ transition and only due to the NSD PNC interaction Hamiltonian for\nall possible hyperfine levels of the $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} - 5d ~ ^2D_{5/2}$\ntransition are given. We have also performed calculations of several properties\nthat are relevant for assessing the reliability of the calculations of the\namplitudes of the above mentioned transitions. We highlight the importance of\ncorrelation effects by giving the results of both the Dirac-Fock (DF) and RCC\ncontributions. Approximate contributions to these properties from the Breit and\nquantum electrodynamics (QED) interactions have also been evaluated. Plausible\nexperimental schemes to measure these transition amplitudes by light shift\ntechniques and interference involving induced Stark shifts are outlined.\n", "  We developed a Friedrichs-model-like scheme in studying the hadron resonance\nphenomenology and present that the hadron resonances might be regarded as the\nGamow states produced by a Hamiltonian in which the bare discrete state is\ndescribed by the result of usual quark potential model and the interaction part\nis described by the quark pair creation model. In a one-parameter calculation,\nthe $X(3862)$, $X(3872)$, and $X(3930)$ state could be simultaneously produced\nwith a quite good accuracy by coupling the three P-wave states,\n$\\chi_{c2}(2P)$, $\\chi_{c1}(2P)$, $\\chi_{c0}(2P)$ predicted in the\nGodfrey-Isgur model to the $D\\bar D$, $D\\bar D^{*}$, $D^*\\bar D^*$ continuum\nstates. At the same time, we predict that the $h_c(2P)$ state is at about 3902\nMeV with a pole width of about 54 MeV. In this calculation, the $X(3872)$ state\nhas a large compositeness. This scheme may shed more light on the long-standing\nproblem about the general discrepancy between the prediction of the quark model\nand the observed values, and it may also provide reference for future search\nfor the hadron resonance state.\n", "  Diffuse optical breast imaging utilizes near-infrared (NIR) light propagation\nthrough tissues to assess the optical properties of tissue for the\nidentification of abnormal tissue. This optical imaging approach is sensitive,\ncost-effective, and does not involve any ionizing radiation. However, the image\nreconstruction of diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a nonlinear inverse\nproblem and suffers from severe ill-posedness, especially in the cases of\nstrong noise and incomplete data. In this paper, a novel image reconstruction\nmethod is proposed for the detection of breast cancer. This method split the\nimage reconstruction problem into the localization of abnormal tissues and\nquantification of absorption variations. The localization of abnormal tissues\nis performed based on a new well-posed optimization model, which can be solved\nvia differential evolution optimization method to achieve a stable image\nreconstruction. The quantification of abnormal absorption variations is then\ndetermined in localized regions of relatively small extents, which are\npotentially tumors. Consequently, the number of unknown absorption variables\ncan be greatly reduced to overcome the underdetermined nature of diffuse\noptical tomography (DOT), allowing for accurate and stable reconstruction of\nthe abnormal absorption variations in the breast. Numerical simulation\nexperiments show that the image reconstruction method is stable and accurate\nfor the identification of abnormal tissues, and robust against measurement\nnoise of data.\n", "  Weyl semimetals have been intensely studied as a three dimensional\nrealization of a Dirac-like excitation spectrum where the conduction bands and\nvalence bands touch at isolated Weyl points in momentum space. Like in\ngraphene, this property entails various peculiar electronic properties.\nHowever, recent theoretical studies have suggested that resonant scattering\nfrom rare regions can give rise to a non-zero density of states even at charge\nneutrality. Here, we give a detailed account of this effect and demonstrate how\nthe semimetallic nature is suppressed at the lowest scales. To this end, we\ndevelop a self-consistent T-matrix approach to investigate the density of\nstates beyond the limit of weak disorder. Our results show a nonvanishing\ndensity of states at the Weyl point which exhibits a non-analytic dependence on\nthe impurity density. This unusually strong effect of rare regions leads to a\nrevised estimate for the conductivity close to the Weyl point and emphasizes\npossible deviations from semimetallic behavior in dirty Weyl semimetals at\ncharge neutrality even with very low impurity concentration.\n", "  We study the transition of non-perturbative to perturbative QCD in situations\nwith possible violations of scaling limits. To this end we consider the singly-\nand doubly-virtual pion transition form factor $\\pi^0\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ at all\nmomentum scales of symmetric and asymmetric photon momenta within the\nDyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach. For the doubly virtual form factor we\nfind good agreement with perturbative asymptotic scaling laws. For the\nsingly-virtual form factor our results agree with the Belle data. At very large\noff-shell photon momenta we identify a mechanism that introduces quantitative\nmodifications to Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage scaling.\n", "  In this paper, we develop a theoretical analysis to efficiently handle\nsuperpositions of waves with concentrated wavevector and frequency spectra,\nallowing an easy analytical description of fields with interesting transverse\nprofiles. First, we analyze an extension of the paraxial formalism that is more\nsuitable for superposing these types of waves, as it does not rely on the use\nof coordinate rotations combined with paraxial assumptions. Second, and most\nimportantly, we leverage the obtained results to describe azimuthally symmetric\nwaves composed of superpositions of zero-order Bessel beams with close cone\nangles that can be as large as desired, unlike in the paraxial formalism.\nThroughout the paper, examples are presented, such as Airy beams with enhanced\ncurvatures, nonparaxial Bessel-Gauss beams and Circular Parabolic-Gaussian\nbeams (which are based on the Cartesian Parabolic-Gaussian beams), and\nexperimental data illustrates interesting transverse patterns achieved by\nsuperpositions of beams propagating in different directions.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional random walk (RW) with a continuous and\nsymmetric jump distribution, $f(\\eta)$, characterized by a L\\'evy index $\\mu\n\\in (0,2]$, which includes standard random walks ($\\mu=2$) and L\\'evy flights\n($0<\\mu<2$). We study the survival probability, $q(x_0,n)$, representing the\nprobability that the RW stays non-negative up to step $n$, starting initially\nat $x_0 \\geq 0$. Our main focus is on the $x_0$-dependence of $q(x_0,n)$ for\nlarge $n$. We show that $q(x_0,n)$ displays two distinct regimes as $x_0$\nvaries: (i) for $x_0= O(1)$ (\"quantum regime\"), the discreteness of the jump\nprocess significantly alters the standard scaling behavior of $q(x_0,n)$ and\n(ii) for $x_0 = O(n^{1/\\mu})$ (\"classical regime\") the discrete-time nature of\nthe process is irrelevant and one recovers the standard scaling behavior (for\n$\\mu =2$ this corresponds to the standard Brownian scaling limit). The purpose\nof this paper is to study how precisely the crossover in $q(x_0,n)$ occurs\nbetween the quantum and the classical regime as one increases $x_0$.\n", "  We investigate the possibility whether the tensions with SM expectations\nobserved in several b -> sll transitions, including hints for lepton flavour\nnon-universality, could be due to the decay of B into a new light resonance. We\nfind that qualitative agreement with the data can be obtained with a light\nvector resonance dominantly decaying invisibly. This scenario predicts a shift\nin the muon anomalous magnetic moment that could explain the long-standing\ndiscrepancy. The most stringent constraint comes from searches for B decays\nwith missing energy. A striking prediction is a strong q^2 dependence of the\nlepton flavour universality ratios R_K and R_K* that should allow to clearly\nconfirm or rule out this possibility experimentally. We also comment on the\npossible connection of the invisible decay product with Dark Matter.\n", "  Motivated by observational and theoretical work which both suggest very small\nscale ($\\lesssim 1\\,$pc) structure in the circum-galactic medium of galaxies\nand in other environments, we study Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) radiative\ntransfer in an extremely clumpy medium with many \"clouds\" of neutral gas along\nthe line of sight. While previous studies have typically considered radiative\ntransfer through sightlines intercepting $\\lesssim 10$ clumps, we explore the\nlimit of a very large number of clumps per sightline (up to $f_{\\mathrm{c}}\n\\sim 1000$). Our main finding is that, for covering factors greater than some\ncritical threshold, a multiphase medium behaves similar to a homogeneous medium\nin terms of the emergent Ly$\\alpha$ spectrum. The value of this threshold\ndepends on both the clump column density and on the movement of the clumps. We\nestimate this threshold analytically and compare our findings to radiative\ntransfer simulations with a range of covering factors, clump column densities,\nradii, and motions. Our results suggest that (i) the success in fitting\nobserved Ly$\\alpha$ spectra using homogeneous \"shell models\" (and the\ncorresponding failure of multiphase models) hints towards the presence of very\nsmall-scale structure in neutral gas, in agreement within a number of other\nobservations; and (ii) the recurrent problems of reproducing realistic line\nprofiles from hydrodynamical simulations may be due to their inability to\nresolve small-scale structure, which causes simulations to underestimate the\neffective covering factor of neutral gas clouds.\n", "  We propose a new set of s-confining theories with product gauge groups and no\ntree-level superpotential, based on a model with one antisymmetric matter field\nand four flavors of quarks. For each product group we find a set of\ngauge-invariant operators which satisfy the 't Hooft anomaly matching\nconditions, and we identify the dynamically generated superpotential which\nreproduces the classical constraints between operators. Several of these\nproduct gauge theories confine without breaking chiral symmetry, even in cases\nwhere the classical moduli space is quantum-modified. These results may be\nuseful for composite model building, particularly in cases where small meson\noperators are absent, or for theories with multiple natural energy scales, and\nmay provide new ways to break supersymmetry dynamically.\n", "  It is a great pleasure to be invited to join the chorus on this auspicious\noccasion to celebrate Professor K. Alex Mueller's 90th birthday by Professors\nAnnette Bussman-Holder, Hugo Keller, and Antonio Bianconi. As a student in high\ntemperature superconductivity, I am forever grateful to Professor Alex Mueller\nand Dr. Georg Bednorz \"for their important breakthrough in the discovery of\nsuperconductivity in the ceramic materials\" in 1986 as described in the\ncitation of their 1987 Nobel Prize in Physics. It is this breakthrough\ndiscovery that has ushered in the explosion of research activities in high\ntemperature superconductivity (HTS) and has provided immense excitement in HTS\nscience and technology in the ensuing decades till now. Alex has not been\nresting on his laurels and has continued to search for the origin of the\nunusual high temperature superconductivity in cuprates.\n", "  In this work we derive a lower bound for the minimum time required to\nimplement a target unitary transformation through a classical time-dependent\nfield in a closed quantum system. The bound depends on the target gate, the\nstrength of the internal Hamiltonian and the highest permitted control field\namplitude. These findings reveal some properties of the reachable set of\noperations, explicitly analyzed for a single qubit. Moreover, for fully\ncontrollable systems, we identify a lower bound for the time at which all\nunitary gates become reachable. We use numerical gate optimization in order to\nstudy the tightness of the obtained bounds. It is shown that in the single\nqubit case our analytical findings describe the relationship between the\nhighest control field amplitude and the minimum evolution time remarkably well.\nFinally, we discuss both challenges and ways forward for obtaining tighter\nbounds for higher dimensional systems, offering a discussion about the\nmathematical form and the physical meaning of the bound.\n", "  The planar oxygen isotope effect coefficient measured as a function of hole\ndoping in the Pr- and La-doped YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and the Ni-doped\nLa1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) superconductors quantitatively and qualitatively\nfollows the form originally proposed by Kresin and Wolf, which was derived for\npolarons perpendicular to the superconducting planes. Interestingly, the\ninverse oxygen isotope effect coefficient at the pseudogap temperature also\nfollows the same formula. These findings allow the conclusion that the\nsuperconductivity in YBCO and LSCO results from polarons or rather bipolarons\nin the CuO2 plane. The original formula, proposed for the perpendicular\ndirection only, is obviously more generally valid and accounts for the\nsuperconductivity in the CuO2 planes.\n", "  Some key results obtained in joint research projects with Alex M\\\"uller are\nsummarized, concentrating on the invention of the barocaloric effect and its\napplication for cooling as well as on important findings in the field of\nhigh-temperature superconductivity resulting from neutron scattering\nexperiments.\n", "  The challenge of understanding high-temperature superconductivity has led to\na plethora of ideas, but 30 years after its discovery in cuprates, very few\nhave achieved convincing experimental validation. While Hubbard and t-J models\nwere given a lot of attention, a number of recent experiments appear to give\ndecisive support to the model of real-space inter-site pairing and percolative\nsuperconductivity in cuprates. Systematic measurements of the doping dependence\nof the superfluid density show a linear dependence on superfluid density -\nrather than doping - over the entire phase diagram, in accordance with the\nmodel's predictions. The doping-dependence of the anomalous lattice dynamics of\nin-plane Cu-O mode vibrations observed by inelastic neutron scattering, gives\nremarkable reciprocal space signature of the inter-site pairing interaction\nwhose doping dependence closely follows the predicted pair density.\nSymmetry-specific time-domain spectroscopy shows carrier localization, polaron\nformation, pairing and superconductivity to be distinct processes occurring on\ndistinct timescales throughout the entire superconducting phase diagram. The\nthree diverse experimental results confirm non-trivial predictions made more\nthan a decade ago by the inter-site pairing model in the cuprates, remarkably\nalso confirming some of the fundamental notions mentioned in the seminal paper\non the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates.\n", "  In the 80th anniversary book for Alex M\\\"uller I wrote a story of our\nscientific collaboration, Shared Fascinations. This time I will be more\npersonal, about the human side of our collaboration and encounters, while also\nreferring to episodes mentioned in Shared Fascinations.\n", "  A systematic Raman study in the visible carried out on the YBa2Cu316,18Ox\n(x=6-7) compounds, with isotopic substitution of 18O for 16O, has detected a\ndoping dependent deviation from harmonic behavior for the frequency shift of\nthe in-phase mode, a smaller amount of anharmonicity for the apex mode, and\nalmost no effect for the out-of-phase B1g-symmetry phonon. It appears that the\namount of anharmonicity depends strongly on the oxygen concentration; it\ndiminishes close to the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural phase transition\nand close to optimal doping, while it reaches its maximum value for the\northo-II and a tetragonal phase. The almost zero anharmonicity at optimal\ndoping persists even at 77K. The data in the overdoped oxygen concentration,\nwhere a softening of the in-phase phonon frequency occurs, indicate that the\nanharmonicity is not enhanced by the sudden increase in the CuO2 buckling. The\nresults fully agree with recent studies of the ortho-II phase but they do not\ncomply with a static double-well potential of the apical oxygen atom at optimal\ndoping.\n", "  Process induced efficiency variation is a major concern for all thin film\nsolar cells, including the emerging perovskite based solar cells. In this\nmanuscript, we address the effect of pinholes or process induced surface\ncoverage aspects on the efficiency of such solar cells through detailed\nnumerical simulations. Interestingly, we find the pinhole size distribution\naffects the short circuit current and open circuit voltage in contrasting\nmanners. Specifically, while the Jsc is heavily dependent on the pinhole size\ndistribution, surprisingly, the Voc seems to be only nominally affected by it.\nFurther, our simulations also indicate that, with appropriate interface\nengineering, it is indeed possible to design a nanostructured device with\nefficiencies comparable to that of ideal planar structures. Additionally, we\npropose a simple technique based on terminal IV characteristics to estimate the\nsurface coverage in perovskite solar cells.\n", "  Recently, several $B$-physics experiments have reported an appreciable\ndeviation from the Standard Model (SM) in the tree-level observables\n$R_{D^{(*)}}$; the combined weighted average now stands at $\\approx 4 \\sigma$.\nWe first show the anomaly necessarily implies model-independent collider\nsignals of the form $pp \\to b \\tau \\nu$ that should be expediously searched for\nat ATLAS/CMS as a complementary test of the anomaly. Next we suggest a possible\ninterconnection of the anomaly with the radiative stability of the Standard\nModel Higgs boson and point to a minimal effective supersymmetric scenario with\n$R$-parity violation as the underlying cause. We also comment on the\npossibility of simultaneously explaining the recently reported $R_{K^{(*)}}$\nanomaly in this setup.\n", "  These notes correspond to a mini-course given at the Poisson 2016 conference\nin Geneva. Starting from classical integrable systems in the sense of\nLiouville, we explore the notion of non-degenerate singularity and expose\nrecent research in connection with semi-toric systems. The quantum and\nsemiclassical counterpart will also be presented, in the viewpoint of the\ninverse question: from the quantum mechanical spectrum, can you recover the\nclassical system?\n", "  We present a spectral-domain (SD) technique for the efficient analysis of\nmetasurfaces. The metasurface is modeled by generalized sheet transition\nconditions (GSTCs) as a zero-thickness sheet creating a discontinuity in the\nelectromagnetic field. The SD expression of these GSTCs for a specified\nincident field leads to a system of four surface integral equations for the\nreflected and transmitted fields, which are solved using the method of moments\nin the spectral domain. Compared to the finite-difference and finite-element\ntechniques that require meshing the entire computational domain, the proposed\ntechnique reduces the problem to the surface of the metasurface, hence\neliminating one dimension and providing substantial benefits in terms of memory\nand speed. A monochromatic generalized-refractive metasurface and a\npolychromatic focusing metasurface are presented as illustrative examples.\n", "  On the basis of ab-initio total-energy electronic-structure calculations, we\nfind that interface localized electron states at the SiC/SiO$_2$ interface\nemerge in the energy region between 0.3 eV below and 1.2 eV above the bulk\nconduction-band minimum (CBM) of SiC, being sensitive to the sequence of atomic\nbilayers in SiC near the interface. These new interface states unrecognized in\nthe past are due to the peculiar characteristics of the CBM states which are\ndistributed along the crystallographic channels. We also find that the electron\ndoping modifies the energetics among the different stacking structures.\nImplication for performance of electron devices fabricated on different SiC\nsurfaces are discussed.\n", "  We study the Hausdorff dimension of the path of a quantum particle in\nnon-commutative space-time. We show that the Hausdorff dimension depends on the\ndeformation parameter $a$ and the resolution $\\Delta x$ for both\nnon-relativistic and relativistic quantum particle. For the non-relativistic\ncase, it is seen that Hausdorff dimension is always less than two in the\nnon-commutative space-time. For relativistic quantum particle, we find the\nHausdorff dimension increases with the non-commutative parameter, in contrast\nto the commutative space-time. We show that non-commutative correction to Dirac\nequation brings in the spinorial nature of the relativistic wave function into\nplay, unlike in the commutative space-time. By imposing self-similarity\ncondition on the path of non-relativistic and relativistic quantum particle in\nnon-commutative space-time, we derive the corresponding generalised uncertainty\nrelation.\n", "  We present a scattering theory for the efficient transmission of an\nexcitation across a finite network with designed disorder. We show that the\npresence of randomly positioned networks sites allows to significantly\naccelerate the excitation transfer processes as compared to a dimer structure,\nif only the disordered Hamiltonians are constrained to be centrosymmetric, and\nto exhibit a dominant doublet in their spectrum. We identify the cause of this\nefficiency enhancement in the constructive interplay between disorder-induced\nfluctuations of the dominant doublet's splitting and the coupling strength\nbetween the input and output sites to the scattering channels. We find that the\ncharacteristic strength of these fluctuations together with the channel\ncoupling fully control the transfer efficiency.\n", "  We present results from a controlled numerical experiment investigating the\neffect of stellar density gas on the coalescence of binary black holes (BBHs)\nand the resulting gravitational waves (GWs). This investigation is motivated by\nthe proposed stellar core fragmentation scenario for BBH formation and the\nassociated possibility of an electromagnetic counterpart to a BBH GW event. We\nemploy full numerical relativity coupled with general-relativistic\nhydrodynamics and set up a $30 + 30 M_\\odot$ BBH (motivated by GW150914) inside\ngas with realistic stellar densities. Our results show that at densities $\\rho\n\\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7 \\, \\mathrm{g \\, cm}^{-3}$ dynamical friction between the\nBHs and gas changes the coalescence dynamics and the GW signal in an\nunmistakable way. We show that for GW150914, LIGO observations conclusively\nrule out BBH coalescence inside stellar gas of $\\rho \\gtrsim 10^7 \\,\n\\mathrm{g\\,cm}^{-3}$. Typical densities in the collapsing cores of massive\nstars are in excess of this density. This excludes the fragmentation scenario\nfor the formation of GW150914.\n", "  From the very beginning K. Alex M\\\"uller emphasized that the materials he and\nGeorge Bednorz discovered in 1986 were $hole$ superconductors. Here I would\nlike to share with him and others what I believe to be $the$ key reason for why\nhigh $T_c$ cuprates as well as all other superconductors are hole\nsuperconductors, which I only came to understand a few months ago. This paper\nis dedicated to Alex M\\\"uller on the occasion of his 90th birthday.\n", "  It has been recently argued, via very clever arguments, that the MaxEnt\nvariational problem would not adequately work for Renyi's and Tsallis'\nentropies. We constructively show here that this is not so if one formulates\nthe associated variational problem in a more orthodox functional fashion.\n", "  We present a new paradigm for understanding optical absorption and hot\nelectron dynamics experiments in graphene. Our analysis pivots on assigning\nproper importance to phonon assisted indirect processes and bleaching of direct\nprocesses. We show indirect processes figure in the excess absorption in the UV\nregion. Experiments which were thought to indicate ultrafast relaxation of\nelectrons and holes, reaching a thermal distribution from an extremely\nnon-thermal one in under 5-10 fs, instead are explained by the nascent electron\nand hole distributions produced by indirect transitions. These need no\nrelaxation or ad-hoc energy removal to agree with the observed emission spectra\nand fast pulsed absorption spectra. The fast emission following pulsed\nabsorption is dominated by phonon assisted processes, which vastly outnumber\ndirect ones and are always available, connecting any electron with any hole any\ntime. Calculations are given, including explicitly calculating the magnitude of\nindirect processes, supporting these views.\n", "  A specific value for the cosmological constant, \\Lambda, can account for\nlate-time cosmic acceleration. However, motivated by the so-called cosmological\nconstant problem(s), several alternative mechanisms have been explored. To\ndate, a host of well-studied dynamical dark energy and modified gravity models\nexists. Going beyond \\Lambda CDM often comes with additional degrees of freedom\n(dofs). For these to pass existing observational tests, an efficient screening\nmechanism must be in place. The linear and quasi-linear regimes of structure\nformation are ideal probes of such dofs and can capture the onset of screening.\nWe propose here a semi-phenomenological treatment to account for screening\ndynamics on LSS observables, with special emphasis on Vainshtein-type\nscreening.\n", "  Recent studies point to the potential storage of a large number of patterns\nin the celebrated Hopfield associative memory model, well beyond the limits\nobtained previously. We investigate the properties of new fixed points to\ndiscover that they exhibit instabilities for small perturbations and are\ntherefore of limited value as associative memories. Moreover, a large\ndeviations approach also shows that errors introduced to the original patterns\ninduce additional errors and increased corruption with respect to the stored\npatterns.\n", "  The use of geometrical constraints opens many new perspectives in photonics\nand in fundamental studies of nonlinear waves. By implementing surface\nstructures in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers as manifolds for curved\nspace, we experimentally study the impacts of geometrical constraints on\nnonlinear wave localization. We observe localized waves pinned to the maximal\ncurvature in an elliptical-ring, and confirm the reduction in the localization\nlength of waves by measuring near and far field patterns, as well as the\ncorresponding dispersion relation. Theoretically, analyses based on a\ndissipative model with a parabola curve give good agreement remarkably to\nexperimental measurement on the transition from delocalized to localized waves.\nThe introduction of curved geometry allows to control and design lasing modes\nin the nonlinear regime.\n", "  Systems of Bose particles with both repulsive and attractive interactions are\nstudied using the Skyrme-like mean-field model. The phase diagram of such\nsystems exhibits two special lines in the chemical potential-temperature plane:\none line which represents the first-order liquid-gas phase transition with the\ncritical end point, and another line which represents the onset of\nBose-Einstein condensation. The calculations are made for strongly-interacting\nmatter composed of alpha particles. The phase diagram of this matter is\nqualitatively similar to that observed for the atomic He4 liquid. The\nsensitivity of the results to the model parameters is studied. For weak\ninteraction coupling the critical point is located at the Bose-condensation\nline.\n", "  We describe the hardware, gateware, and software developed at Raytheon BBN\nTechnologies for dynamic quantum information processing experiments on\nsuperconducting qubits. In dynamic experiments, real-time qubit state\ninformation is fedback or fedforward within a fraction of the qubits' coherence\ntime to dynamically change the implemented sequence. The hardware presented\nhere covers both control and readout of superconducting qubits. For readout we\ncreated a custom signal processing gateware and software stack on commercial\nhardware to convert pulses in a heterodyne receiver into qubit state\nassignments with minimal latency, alongside data taking capability. For\ncontrol, we developed custom hardware with gateware and software for pulse\nsequencing and steering information distribution that is capable of arbitrary\ncontrol flow on a fraction superconducting qubit coherence times. Both readout\nand control platforms make extensive use of FPGAs to enable tailored qubit\ncontrol systems in a reconfigurable fabric suitable for iterative development.\n", "  We develop a class of supercell photonic crystals supporting complete\nphotonic bandgaps based on breaking spatial symmetries of the underlying\nprimitive photonic crystal. One member of this class based on a two-dimensional\nhoneycomb structure supports a complete bandgap for an index-contrast ratio as\nlow as $n_{high}/n_{low} = 2.1$, making this the first such 2D photonic crystal\nto support a complete bandgap in lossless materials at visible frequencies. The\ncomplete bandgaps found in such supercell photonic crystals do not necessarily\nmonotonically increase as the index-contrast in the system is increased,\ndisproving a long-held conjecture of complete bandgaps in photonic crystals.\n", "  We discuss in detail the spatial distribution of angular momentum inside the\nnucleon. We show that the discrepancies between different definitions originate\nfrom terms that integrate to zero. Even though these terms can safely be\ndropped at the integrated level, they have to be taken into account at the\ndensity level. Using the scalar diquark model, we illustrate our results and,\nfor the first time, check explicitly that the equivalence between kinetic and\ncanonical orbital angular momentum persists at the density level, as expected\nin a system without gauge degrees of freedom.\n", "  We propose a model with $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry and several new fermions\nin no conflict with anomaly cancellation where the neutrino masses are given by\nthe vacuum expectation value of Higgs triplet induced at the one-loop level.\nThe new fermions are odd under discrete $Z_2$ symmetry and the lightest one\nbecomes dark matter candidate. We find that the mass of dark matter is\ntypically $O(1)$-$O(10)$ GeV. Then relic density of the dark matter is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We show a symmetry that, in the context of a composite Higgs with anarchic\nflavor, can suppress the dominant CP violating contributions to $K-\\bar K$\nmixing. Based on previous extensions of SU(3)$_c$, we consider the case in\nwhich the composite sector has a global SU(6) symmetry, spontaneously broken to\na subgroup containing SU(3)$\\times$SU(3). We show that the interactions with\nthe Standard Model can spontaneously break the remaining symmetry to the\ndiagonal subgroup, identified with the group of color interactions, and\nnaturally suppress $\\epsilon_K$. We consider this scenario in the context of\nthe Minimal Composite Higgs Model based on SO(5)/SO(4) for the electroweak\nsector. By working in the framework of 2-site models, we compute the scalar\npotential, determine the conditions for a successful breaking of the symmetries\nand calculate the spectrum of lightest states. We find that $\\epsilon_K$ can be\nsuppressed and the top mass reproduced for a large region of the parameter\nspace where the symmetries are dynamically broken. Besides other new\nresonances, the model predicts the presence of a new singlet scalar state,\ngenerally lighter than the Higgs, that could have evaded detection at\ncolliders.\n", "  The double-exchange (DE) interaction, that is, a ferromagnetic (FM)\ninteraction due to a combination of electron motion and the Hund coupling, is a\nwell known source of a wide class of FM orders. Here, we show that the DE\ninteraction in highly photoexcited states is antiferromagnetic (AFM). Transient\ndynamics of quantum electrons coupled with classical spins are analyzed. An ac\nfield applied to a metallic FM state results in an almost perfect N\\'eel state.\nA time characterizing the FM-to-AFM conversion is scaled by light amplitude and\nfrequency. This hidden AFM interaction is attributable to the electron-spin\ncoupling under nonequilibrium electron distribution.\n", "  We conjecture that in Yang-Mills theories the ratio between the ground-state\nglueball mass squared and the string tension is proportional to the ratio of\nthe eigenvalues of quadratic Casimir operators in the adjoint and the\nfundamental representations. The proportionality constant depends on the\ndimension of the space-time only, and is henceforth universal. We argue that\nthis universality, which is supported by available lattice results, is a direct\nconsequence of area-law confinement. In order to explain this universal\nbehaviour, we provide three analytical arguments, based respectively on a\nBethe-Salpeter analysis, on the saturation of the scale anomaly by the lightest\nscalar glueball and on QCD sum rules, commenting on the underlying assumptions\nthat they entail and on their physical implications.\n", "  Beam commissioning of the SuperKEKB collider began in 2016. The Beam Exorcism\nfor A STable experiment II (BEAST II) project is particularly designed to\nmeasure the beam backgrounds around the interaction point of the SuperKEKB\ncollider for the Belle II experiment. We develop a system using bismuth\ngermanium oxide (BGO) crystals with optical fibers connecting to a multianode\nphotomultiplier tube (MAPMT) and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)\nembedded readout board for monitoring the real-time beam backgrounds in BEAST\nII. The overall radiation sensitivity of this system is estimated to be\n$(2.20\\pm0.26)\\times10^{-12}$ Gy/ADU (analog-to-digital unit) with the standard\n10 m fibers for transmission and the MAPMT operating at 700 V. Our $\\gamma$-ray\nirradiation study of the BGO system shows that the exposure of BGO crystals to\n$^{60}$Co $\\gamma$-ray doses of 1 krad has led to immediate light output\nreductions of 25--40%, and the light outputs further drop by 30--45% after the\ncrystals receive doses of 2--4 krad. Our findings agree with those of the\nprevious studies on the radiation hard (RH) BGO crystals grown by the low\nthermal gradient Czochralski (LTG Cz) technology. The absolute dose from the\nBGO system is also consistent with the simulation, and is estimated to be about\n1.18 times the equivalent dose. These results prove that the BGO system is able\nto monitor the background dose rate in real time under extreme high radiation\nconditions. This study concludes that the BGO system is reliable for the beam\nbackground study in BEAST II.\n", "  We address questions posed by experiments which show that most small-chain\nalcohols reduce the miscibility transition temperature when added to giant\nplasma membrane vesicles, but increase that temperature when added to giant\nunilamellar vesicles. In both systems the change in temperature depends\nnon-monotonically on the length of the alcohol chain. To emphasize the roles\nplayed by the internal entropies of the components, we model them as linear\npolymers. We show that, within Flory-Huggins theory, the addition of alcohol\ncauses an increase or decrease of the transition temperature depending upon the\ncompetition of two effects. One is the dilution of the solvent interactions\ncaused by the introduction of solute, which tends to lower the temperature. The\nother is the preference of the solute for one phase or the other, which tends\nto raise the temperature. The magnitude of this term depends on the entropies\nof all components. Lastly we provide a reasonable explanation for the behavior\nof the transition temperature with alcohol chain length observed in experiment.\n", "  MoTe2 is the least explored material in the Molybdenum-chalcogen family,\nwhich crystallizes in thermodynamically stable semiconducting 2H phase at\n\\textless 500 C and 1T' metallic phase at higher temperatures. Molecular beam\nepitaxy (MBE) provides an unique opportunity to tackle the small\nelectronegativity difference between Mo and Te while growing layer by layer\naway from thermodynamic equilibrium. For a few-layer MoTe2 grown at a moderate\nrate of $\\sim$6 mins per monolayer under varied Te:Mo flux ratio and substrate\ntemperature, the boundary between the 2 phases in MBE grown MoTe2 on CaF2 is\ncharacterized using Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), Raman\nspectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Grazing incidence\nX-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) reveals a grain size of $\\sim$90 {\\AA} and presence\nof twinned grains. XRD, transmission electron miscroscopy, RHEED, low energy\nelectron diffraction along with lack of electrical conductivity modulation by\nfield effect in MBE 2H-MoTe2 on GaAs (111) B show likelihood of excess Te\nincorporation in the films. Finally, thermal stability and air sensitivity of\nMBE 2H-MoTe2 is investigated by temperature dependent XRD and XPS,\nrespectively.\n", "  A scheme for distributed quantum measurement that allows nondestructive or\nindirect Bell measurement was proposed by Gupta et al., (Int. J. Quant. Infor.\n\\textbf{5} (2007) 627) and subsequently realized experimentally using an\nNMR-based three-qubit quantum computer by Samal et al., (J. Phys. B,\n\\textbf{43} (2010) 095508). In the present work, a similar experiment is\nperformed using the five-qubit super-conductivity-based quantum computer, which\nhas been recently placed in cloud by IBM Corporation. The experiment confirmed\nthat the Bell state can be constructed and measured in a nondestructive manner\nwith a reasonably high fidelity. A comparison of the outcomes of this study and\nthe results obtained earlier in the NMR-based experiment has also been\nperformed. The study indicates that to make a scalable SQUID-based computer,\nerrors by the gates (in the present technology) have to be reduced\nconsiderably.\n", "  We consider D=3 supersymmetric Chern-Simons gauge theories both from the\npoint of view of their formal structure and of their applications to the\n$\\mathrm{AdS_4/CFT_3}$ correspondence. From the structural view-point, we use\nthe new formalism of integral forms in superspace that utilizes the rheonomic\nLagrangians and the Picture Changing Operators, as an algorithmic tool\nproviding the connection between different approaches to supersymmetric\ntheories. We provide here the generalization to an arbitrary K\\\"ahler manifold\nwith arbitrary gauge group and arbitrary superpotential of the rheonomic\nlagrangian of D=3 matter coupled gauge theories constructed years ago. From the\npoint of view of the $\\mathrm{AdS_4/CFT_3}$ correspondence and more generally\nof M2-branes we emphasize the role of the K\\\"ahler quotient data in determining\nthe field content and the interactions of the Cherns Simons gauge theory when\nthe transverse space to the brane is a non-compact K\\\"ahler quotient $K_4$ of\nsome flat variety with respect to a suitable group. The crepant resolutions of\n${\\mathbb C}^n/\\Gamma$ singularities fall in this category. In the present\npaper we anticipate the general scheme how the geometrical data are to be\nutilized in the construction of the D=3 Chern-Simons Theory supposedly dual to\nthe corresponding M2-brane solution.\n", "  Rare regions with weak disorder (Griffiths regions) have the potential to\nspoil localization. We describe a non-perturbative construction of local\nintegrals of motion (LIOMs) for a weakly interacting spin chain in one\ndimension, under a physically reasonable assumption on the statistics of\neigenvalues. We discuss ideas about the situation in higher dimensions, where\none can no longer ensure that interactions involving the Griffiths regions are\nmuch smaller than the typical energy-level spacing for such regions. We argue\nthat ergodicity is restored in dimension d > 1, although equilibration should\nbe extremely slow, similar to the dynamics of glasses.\n", "  The Lowest Landau Level (LLL) equation emerges as an accurate approximation\nfor a class of dynamical regimes of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) in\ntwo-dimensional isotropic harmonic traps in the limit of weak interactions.\nBuilding on recent developments in the field of spatially confined extended\nHamiltonian systems, we find a fully nonlinear solution of this equation\nrepresenting periodically modulated precession of a single vortex. Motions of\nthis type have been previously seen in numerical simulations and experiments at\nmoderately weak coupling. Our work provides the first controlled analytic\nprediction for trajectories of a single vortex, suggests new targets for\nexperiments, and opens up the prospect of finding analytic multi-vortex\nsolutions.\n", "  In this article we have investigated the Thomas-Fermi model for the electron\ngas in Rindler space. We have found that if the uniform acceleration is along\n$+x$-direction, then there is $y-z$-symmetry in space. For the sake of\nmathematical simplicity, we have assumed two dimensional spatial structure\n($x-y$) in Rindler space. It has been observed that in two dimensional spatial\ncoordinates the electrons are distributed discontinuously but in a periodic\nmanner in a number of rectangular strips like domain along $\\pm y$-direction.\nSome of them are having void structure, with no electrons inside such\nrectangular strips, while some are filled with electrons. We call the later\ntype domain as the normal zone. We have also given physical interpretation for\nsuch exotic type electron distribution in Rindler space.\n", "  This paper proposes two spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) leaky-wave\nantennas using periodically loaded patches above perfect electric conductor\n(PEC) and artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) ground planes, respectively. The\nSSPP leaky-wave antenna is based on a SSPP transmission line, along which\ncircular patches are periodically loaded on both sides to provide an additional\nmomentum for phase matching with the radiated waves in the air. The PEC and AMC\nground planes underneath the antenna reflect the radiated waves into the upward\nspace, leading to an enhanced radiation gain. Both PEC- and AMC-grounded\nantenna prototypes are fabricated and measured in comparison with the one\nwithout any ground plane. The experimental results show that the PEC and AMC\nground planes increase the radiation gain by approximately 3 dB within the\noperational frequency range 4.5-6.5 GHz. It also demonstrates that the\nAMC-grounded leaky-wave antenna, with a thickness of 0.08\\lambda at 6 GHz,\nfeatures more compact profile than the PEC-grounded one (with a thickness of\n0.3\\lambda at 6 GHz).\n", "  We reveal multiple components of an interacting galaxy system at\n$z\\approx3.35$ through a detailed analysis of the exquisite high-resolution\nKeck/HIRES spectrum of the afterglow of a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Through\nVoigt-profile fitting of absorption lines from the Lyman-series, we constrain\nthe neutral hydrogen column density to $N_{\\mathrm{HI}} \\leq 10^{18.35}$\ncm$^{-2}$ for the densest of four distinct systems at the host redshift of\nGRB~080810, among the lowest $N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ ever observed in a GRB host,\ndespite the line of sight passing within a projected 5 kpc of the galaxy\ncentres. By detailed analysis of the corresponding metal absorption lines, we\nderive chemical, ionic and kinematic properties of the individual absorbing\nsystems, and thus build a picture of the host as a whole. Striking differences\nbetween the systems imply that the line of sight passes through several phases\nof gas: the star-forming regions of the GRB host; enriched material in the form\nof a galactic outflow; the hot and ionised halo of a second, interacting galaxy\nfalling towards the host at a line-of-sight velocity of 700 km s$^{-1}$; and a\ncool, metal-poor cloud which may represent one of the best candidates yet for\nthe inflow of metal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium.\n", "  We continue to study a certain dynamical theory of 3-forms in seven\ndimensions, which can be viewed as a non-linear 7D analog of the 3D Abelian\nChern-Simons theory. We perform the 6+1 split and show that the theory\npropagates 3 degrees of freedom. We also study the dimensional reduction on S3.\nWe find the resulting theory to be a variant of 4D scalar-tensor theory of\ngravity.\n", "  We investigate the influence of periodic surface roughness in thin\nferromagnetic films on shape anisotropy and magnetization behavior inside the\nferromagnet. Starting from the full micromagnetic energy and using methods of\nhomogenization and $\\Gamma$-convergence we derive a two dimensional local\nreduced model. Investigation of this model provides an insight on the formation\nmechanism of {\\it perpendicular magnetic anisotropy} and uniaxial anisotropy\nwith an {\\it arbitrary} preferred direction of magnetization.\n", "  The present study investigates a way to design dykes which can filter the\nwavelengths of ocean surface waves. This offers the possibility to achieve a\nstructure that can attenuate waves associated with storm swell, without\naffecting coastline in other conditions. Our approach is based on low frequency\nresonances in metamaterials combined with Bragg frequencies for which waves\ncannot propagate in periodic lattices.\n", "  Finding an easy-to-build coils set has been a critical issue for stellarator\ndesign for decades. Conventional approaches assume a toroidal \"winding\"\nsurface. We'll investigate if the existence of winding surface unnecessarily\nconstrains the optimization, and a new method to design coils for stellarators\nis presented. Each discrete coil is represented as an arbitrary, closed,\none-dimensional curve embedded in three-dimensional space. A target function to\nbe minimized that covers both physical requirements and engineering constraints\nis constructed. The derivatives of the target function are calculated\nanalytically. A numerical code, named FOCUS, has been developed. Applications\nto a simple configuration, the W7-X, and LHD plasmas are presented.\n", "  The explicit evaluation of the partition function in the Schwarzian theory is\npresented.\n", "  We report here new electrical laws, derived from nonlinear electro-diffusion\ntheory, about the effect of the local geometrical structure, such as curvature,\non the electrical properties of a cell. We adopt the Poisson-Nernst-Planck\n(PNP) equations for charge concentration and electric potential as a model of\nelectro-diffusion. In the case at hand, the entire boundary is impermeable to\nions and the electric field satisfies the compatibility condition of Poisson's\nequation. We construct an asymptotic approximation for certain singular limits\nto the steady-state solution in a ball with an attached cusp-shaped funnel on\nits surface. As the number of charge increases, they concentrate at the end of\ncusp-shaped funnel. These results can be used in the design of nano-pipettes\nand help to understand the local voltage changes inside dendrites and axons\nwith heterogenous local geometry.\n", "  We describe the design of a new family of high spectral brightness narrow\nlinewidth (NLW) mid-infrared (MIR) lasers of < 1 MHz anticipated linewidths\nwith potential for operation at any target wavelength between 2.5 and 9.5 um.\nMore specifically, we analyze the potential performance characteristics of\nmid-infrared distributed feedback (DFB) Raman fiber lasers (RFLs) based on\nPi-phase-shifted (PPS) Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) written in appropriately\nchosen low-phonon-energy glass fibers. In particular, we calculate anticipated\nthreshold pump powers for optimal laser designs and pump wavelengths for single\nfrequency (fundamental mode) operation of specific mid-infrared DFB-RFLs\noperating at chosen target wavelengths, and show that these pump powers can be\nas low as a few milliWatts for MIR DFB-RFLs fabricated with appropriate\nlow-loss small mode area single mode fibers. As such, we clearly establish the\nPPS-DFB RFL platform as a very practical approach for constructing a broad\nrange of narrow linewidth MIR coherent sources for numerous applications,\nincluding proximal and remote sensing of molecules and various high spectral\nbrightness and long coherence length MIR applications.\n", "  The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a concrete solvable model to study\nnon-Fermi liquid properties, holographic duality and maximally chaotic\nbehavior. In this work, we consider a generalization of the SYK model that\ncontains two SYK models with different number of Majorana modes coupled by\nquadratic terms. This model is also solvable, and the solution shows a\nzero-temperature quantum phase transition between two non-Fermi liquid chaotic\nphases. This phase transition is driven by tuning the ratio of two mode\nnumbers, and a Fermi liquid non-chaotic phase sits at the critical point with\nequal mode number. At finite temperature, the Fermi liquid phase expands to a\nfinite regime. More intriguingly, a different non-Fermi liquid phase emerges at\nfinite temperature. We characterize the phase diagram in term of the spectral\nfunction, the Lyapunov exponent and the entropy. Our results illustrate a\nconcrete example of quantum phase transition and critical regime between two\nnon-Fermi liquid phases.\n", "  The Leidenfrost effect occurs when an object near a hot surface vaporizes\nrapidly enough to lift itself up and hover. Although well-understood for\nliquids and stiff sublimable solids, nothing is known about the effect with\nmaterials whose stiffness lies between these extremes. Here we introduce a new\nphenomenon that occurs with vaporizable soft solids: the elastic Leidenfrost\neffect. By dropping hydrogel spheres onto hot surfaces we find that, rather\nthan hovering, they energetically bounce several times their diameter for\nminutes at a time. With high-speed video during a single impact, we uncover\nhigh-frequency microscopic gap dynamics at the sphere-substrate interface. We\nshow how these otherwise-hidden agitations constitute work cycles that harvest\nmechanical energy from the vapour and sustain the bouncing. Our findings\nunleash a powerful and widely applicable strategy for injecting mechanical\nenergy into soft materials, with relevance to fields ranging from soft robotics\nand metamaterials to microfluidics and active matter.\n", "  The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem dictates that emergent low-energy\nstates from a lattice model cannot be a trivial symmetric insulator if the\nfilling per unit cell is not integral and if the lattice translation symmetry\nand particle number conservation are strictly imposed. In this paper, we\ncompare the one-dimensional gapless states enforced by the LSM theorem and the\nboundaries of one-higher dimensional strong symmetry-protected topological\n(SPT) phases from the perspective of quantum anomalies. We first note that,\nthey can be both described by the same low-energy effective field theory with\nthe same effective symmetry realizations on low-energy modes, wherein\nnon-on-site lattice translation symmetry is encoded as if it is a local\nsymmetry. In spite of the identical form of the low-energy effective field\ntheories, we show that the quantum anomalies of the theories play different\nroles in the two systems. In particular, We find that the chiral anomaly is\nequivalent to the LSM theorem, whereas there is another anomaly, which is not\nrelated to the LSM theorem but is intrinsic to the SPT states. As an\napplication, we extend the conventional LSM theorem to multiple-charge\nmultiple-species problems and construct several exotic symmetric insulators. We\nalso find that the (3+1)d chiral anomaly provides only the perturbative\nstability of the gapless-ness local in the parameter space.\n", "  In a multipartite random energy model, made of a number of coupled GREMs, we\ndetermine the joint law of the overlaps in terms of the ones of the single\nGREMs. This provides the simplest example of the so-called overlap\nsynchronisation.\n", "  The low-energy behaviors of gapless double- and triple-Weyl fermions caused\nby the interplay of long-range Coulomb interaction and quenched disorder are\nstudied by performing a renormalization group analysis. It is found that an\narbitrarily weak disorder drives the double-Weyl semimetal to undergo a quantum\nphase transition into a compressible diffusive metal, independent of the\ndisorder type and the Coulomb interaction strength. In contrast, the nature of\nthe ground state of triple-Weyl fermion system relies sensitively on the\nspecific disorder type in the noninteracting limit: The system is turned into a\ncompressible diffusive metal state by an arbitrarily weak random scalar\npotential or $z$ component of random vector potential but exhibits stable\ncritical behavior when there is only $x$ or $y$ component of random vector\npotential. In case the triple-Weyl fermions couple to random scalar potential,\nthe system becomes a diffusive metal in the weak interaction regime but remains\na semimetal if Coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong. Interplay of Coulomb\ninteraction and $x$, or $y$, component of random vector potential leads to a\nstable infrared fixed point that is likely to be characterized by critical\nbehavior. When Coulomb interaction coexists with the $z$ component of random\nvector potential, the system flows to the interaction-dominated strong coupling\nregime, which might drive a Mott insulating transition. It is thus clear that\ndouble- and triple-Weyl fermions exhibit distinct low-energy behavior in\nresponse to interaction and disorder. The physical explanation of such\ndistinction is discussed in detail. The role played by long-range Coulomb\nimpurity in triple-Weyl semimetal is also considered.\n", "  We inspect different quantum optical setups from the viewpoint of\nentanglement generation and detection. As a first step we consider a planar\nsemiconductor microcavity and optimize the Bell-type correlations and their\nrobustness against dephasing to create strong bipartite entanglement between\npolariton branches, which subsequently can be transfered to the emitted\nphotons. In a second step, in order to create multipartite entangled light, we\nplace the microcavity in an optical resonator driven by pump pulses with a\nfrequency comb spectrum. For this system we show how phase matching of all comb\nmodes can be achieved and will lead to indistinguishable scattering processes\ncausing entanglement among every mode. Finally we demonstrate the buildup of\nentanglement in the dissipative dynamics of emitters coupled to a single cavity\nphoton mode driven by an external laser. From a Floquet master equation\napproach we find that entanglement production predominates during the first few\nlaser oscillation periods.\n", "  Using a data set of 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ taken at a center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we\nperform a search for an extra U(1) gauge boson, also denoted as a dark photon.\nWe examine the initial state radiation reactions $e^+e^-\\rightarrow\ne^+e^-\\gamma_{\\rm ISR}$ and $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-\\gamma_{\\rm ISR}$ for\nthis search, where the dark photon would appear as an enhancement in the\ninvariant mass distribution of the leptonic pairs. We observe no obvious\nenhancement in the mass range between 1.5 and 3.4 GeV/$c^{2}$ and set a 90%\nconfidence level upper limit on the mixing strength of the dark photon and the\nStandard Model photon. We obtain a competitive limit in the tested mass range.\n", "  We present an analysis of the stability spectrum for all stationary periodic\nsolutions to the sine-Gordon equation. An analytical expression for the\nspectrum is given. From this expression, various quantitative and qualitative\nresults about the spectrum are derived. Specifically, the solution parameter\nspace is shown to be split into regions of distinct qualitative behavior of the\nspectrum, in one of which the solutions are stable. Additional results on the\nstability of solutions with respect to perturbations of an integer multiple of\nthe solution period are given.\n", "  In halo dark matter axion search experiments, cylindrical microwave cavities\nare typically employed to detect signals from the axion-photon conversion. To\nenhance the conversion power and reduce the noise level, cavities are placed in\nstrong solenoid magnetic fields at sufficiently low temperatures. Exploring\nhigh mass regions in cavity-based axion search experiments requires high\nfrequency microwave cavities and thus understanding cavity properties at high\nfrequencies in extreme conditions is deemed necessary. We present a study of\nthe magnetoresistance of copper using a cavity with a resonant frequency of\n12.9 GHz at the liquid helium temperature in magnetic fields up to 15 T\nutilizing a second generation high temperature superconducting magnet. The\nobservations are interpreted to be consistent with the anomalous skin effect\nand size effect. This is the first measurement of magnetoresistance at a high\nfrequency (> 10 GHz) in high magnetic fields (> 10 T).\n", "  In the regime where traditional approaches to electronic structure cannot\nafford to achieve accurate energy differences via exhaustive wave function\nflexibility, rigorous approaches to balancing different states' accuracies\nbecome desirable. As a direct measure of a wave function's accuracy, the energy\nvariance offers one route to achieving such a balance. Here, we develop and\ntest a variance matching approach for predicting excitation energies within the\ncontext of variational Monte Carlo and selective configuration interaction. In\na series of tests on small but difficult molecules, we demonstrate that the\napproach it is effective at delivering accurate excitation energies when the\nwave function is far from the exhaustive flexibility limit. Results in C$_3$,\nwhere we combine this approach with variational Monte Carlo orbital\noptimization, are especially encouraging.\n", "  It is shown that the addition of small amounts of microscopic rods in a\nviscous fluid at low Reynolds number causes a significant increase of the flow\nresistance. Numerical simulations of the dynamics of the solution reveal that\nthis phenomenon is associated to a transition from laminar to chaotic flow.\nPolymer stresses give rise to flow instabilities which, in turn, perturb the\nalignment of the rods. This coupled dynamics results in the activation of a\nwide range of scales, which enhances the mixing efficiency of viscous flows.\n", "  We present a new algorithm for the discretization of the Vlasov-Maxwell\nsystem of equations for the study of plasmas in the kinetic regime. Using the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the spatial discretization, we\nobtain a high order accurate solution for the plasma's distribution function.\nTime stepping for the distribution function is done explicitly with a third\norder strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta method. Since the Vlasov equation\nin the Vlasov-Maxwell system is a high dimensional transport equation, up to\nsix dimensions plus time, we take special care to note various features we have\nimplemented to reduce the cost while maintaining the integrity of the solution,\nincluding the use of a reduced high-order basis set. A series of benchmarks,\nfrom simple wave and shock calculations, to a five dimensional turbulence\nsimulation, are presented to verify the efficacy of our set of numerical\nmethods, as well as demonstrate the power of the implemented features.\n", "  We determine an optimized clustering statistic to be used for galaxy samples\nwith significant redshift uncertainty, such as those that rely on photometric\nredshifts. To do so, we study the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) information\ncontent as a function of the orientation of galaxy clustering modes with\nrespect to their angle to the line-of-sight (LOS). The clustering along the\nLOS, as observed in a redshift-space with significant redshift uncertainty, has\ncontributions from clustering modes with a range of orientations with respect\nto the true LOS. For redshift uncertainty $\\sigma_z \\geq 0.02(1+z)$ we find\nthat while the BAO information is confined to transverse clustering modes in\nthe true space, it is spread nearly evenly in the observed space. Thus,\nmeasuring clustering in terms of the projected separation (regardless of the\nLOS) is an efficient and nearly lossless compression of the signal for\n$\\sigma_z \\geq 0.02(1+z)$. For reduced redshift uncertainty, a more careful\nconsideration is required. We then use more than 1700 realizations (combining\ntwo separate sets) of galaxy simulations mimicking the Dark Energy Survey Year\n1 sample to validate our analytic results and optimized analysis procedure. We\nfind that using the correlation function binned in projected separation, we can\nachieve uncertainties that are within 10 per cent of those predicted by Fisher\nmatrix forecasts. We predict that DES Y1 should achieve a 5 per cent distance\nmeasurement using our optimized methods. We expect the results presented here\nto be important for any future BAO measurements made using photometric redshift\ndata.\n", "  In this Essay we investigate the observational signatures of Loop Quantum\nCosmology (LQC) in the CMB data. First, we concentrate on the dynamics of LQC\nand we provide the basic cosmological functions. We then obtain the power\nspectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations in order to study the performance\nof LQC against the latest CMB data. We find that LQC provides a robust\nprediction for the main slow-roll parameters, like the scalar spectral index\nand the tensor-to-scalar fluctuation ratio, which are in excellent agreement\nwithin $1\\sigma$ with the values recently measured by the Planck collaboration.\nThis result indicates that LQC can be seen as an alternative scenario with\nrespect to that of standard inflation.\n", "  Background: The $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha,n$)$^{25}$Mg reaction is one of the neutron\nsources for the $s$-process in massive stars. The properties of levels in\n$^{26}$Mg above the $\\alpha$-particle threshold control the strengths of the\n$^{22}$Ne($\\alpha,n$)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha,\\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg\nreactions. The strengths of these reactions as functions of temperature are one\nof the major uncertainties in the $s$-process. Methods: Inelastically scattered\n$\\alpha$ particles from a $^{26}$Mg target were momentum-analysed in the K600\nmagnetic spectrometer at iThemba LABS, South Africa. The differential cross\nsections of states were deduced from the focal-plane trajectory of the\nscattered $\\alpha$ particles. Based on the differential cross sections, spin\nand parity assignments to states are made. Results: A new $0^+$ state was\nobserved in addition to a number of other states, some of which can be\nassociated with states observed in other experiments. Some of the deduced\n$J^\\pi$ values of the states observed in the present study show discrepancies\nwith those assigned in an experiment performed at RCNP Osaka. Conclusion: The\nhigh level density at this excitation energy in $^{26}$Mg makes assigning\n$J^\\pi$ values to observed states difficult. Further experimental\ninvestigations with superior experimental energy resolution are required to\nclarify the number of levels in $^{26}$Mg, especially between the\n$\\alpha$-particle threshold at 10.615 MeV and the neutron threshold at 11.319\nMeV.\n", "  There is a renewed interest in conformal field theories (CFT) on ultrametric\nspaces (p-adic field and its algebraic extensions) in view of their natural\nadaptability in the holographic setting. We compute the contributions from the\nexchange interactions to the four-point correlator of the CFT using Witten\ndiagrams with three-scalar interaction vertex. Together with the contributions\nfrom the bulk four-point interaction, the contact term, these provide a\ncomplete answer. We remark on the singularity structure in Mellin space, and\nargue that all these models are analogues of adS_2/CFT_1.\n", "  Inflation in the early Universe is one of the most promising probes of\ngravity in the high-energy regime. However, observable scales give access to a\nlimited window in the inflationary dynamics. In this essay, we argue that\nquantum corrections to the classical dynamics of cosmological fields allow us\nto probe much earlier epochs of the inflationary phase and extend this window\nby many orders of magnitude. We point out that both the statistics of\ncosmological fluctuations at observable scales, and the field displacements\nacquired by spectator fields that play an important role in many\npost-inflationary processes, are sensitive to a much longer phase of the\ninflationary epoch.\n", "  Quantum many-body problem with exponentially large degrees of freedom can be\nreduced to a tractable computational form by neural network method \\cite{CT}.\nThe power of deep neural network (DNN) based on deep learning is clarified by\nmapping it to renormalization group (RG), which may shed lights on holographic\nprinciple by identifying a sequence of RG transformations to the AdS geometry.\nIn this essay, we show that any network which reflects RG process has intrinsic\nhyperbolic geometry, and discuss the structure of entanglement encoded in the\ngraph of DNN. We find the entanglement structure of deep neural network is of\nRyu-Takayanagi form. Based on these facts, we argue that the emergence of\nholographic gravitational theory is related to deep learning process of the\nquantum field theory.\n", "  Wave propagation of field disturbances is ubiquitous. The electromagnetic and\ngravitational are cousin theories in which the corresponding waves play a\nrelevant role to understand several related physical. It has been established\nthat small electromagnetic waves can generate gravitational waves and vice\nversa when scattered by a charged black hole. In the realm of cylindrical\nspacetimes, we present here a simple nonlinear effect of the conversion of\nelectromagnetic to gravitational waves reflected by the amount of mass\nextracted from them.\n", "  We derive an asymptotic formula for operator product expansion coefficients\nof heavy operators in two dimensional conformal field theory. This follows from\nmodular invariance of the genus two partition function, and generalises the\nasymptotic formula for the density of states from torus modular invariance. The\nresulting formula is universal, depending only on the central charge, but\ninvolves the asymptotic behaviour of genus two conformal blocks. We use\nmonodromy techniques to compute the asymptotics of the relevant blocks at large\ncentral charge to determine the behaviour explicitly.\n", "  We present a general approach for the solution of the three-body problem for\na general interaction, and apply it to the case of the Coulomb interaction.\nThis approach is exact, simple and fast. It makes use of integral equations\nderived from the consideration of the scattering properties of the system. In\nparticular this makes full use of the solution of the two-body problem, the\ninteraction appearing only through the corresponding known T-matrix. In the\ncase of the Coulomb potential we make use of a very convenient expression for\nthe T-matrix obtained by Schwinger. As a check we apply this approach to the\nwell-known problem of the Helium atom ground state and obtain a perfect\nnumerical agreement with the known result for the ground state energy. The wave\nfunction is directly obtained from the corresponding solution. We expect our\nmethod to be in particular quite useful for the trion problem in\nsemiconductors.\n", "  In this work we compare mass spectra and decay constants obtained from two\nrecent, independent, and fully relativistic approaches to the quarkonium\nbound-state problem: the Hamiltonian basis light-front quantization (BLFQ)\napproach, where light-front wave functions are naturally formulated; and, the\ncovariant spectator theory (CST), based on a reorganization of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation. Even though conceptually different, both solutions are\nobtained in Minkowski space. Comparisons of decay constants for more than ten\nstates of charmonium and bottomonium show favorable agreement between the two\napproaches as well as with experiment where available. We also apply the\nBrodsky-Huang-Lepage prescription to convert the CST amplitudes into functions\nof light-front variables. This provides an ideal opportunity to investigate the\nsimilarities and differences at the level of the wave functions. Several\nqualitative features are observed in remarkable agreement between the two\napproaches even for the rarely addressed excited states. Leading twist\ndistribution amplitudes as well as parton distribution functions of heavy\nquarkonia are also analyzed.\n", "  The weak gravity conjecture suggests that, in a self-consistent theory of\nquantum gravity, the strength of gravity is bounded from above by the strengths\nof the various gauge forces in the theory. In particular, this intriguing\nconjecture asserts that in a theory describing a U(1) gauge field coupled\nconsistently to gravity, there must exist a particle whose proper mass is\nbounded (in Planck units) by its charge: $m/m_{\\text{P}}<q$. This beautiful and\nremarkably compact conjecture has attracted the attention of physicists and\nmathematicians over the last decade. It should be emphasized, however, that\ndespite the fact that there are numerous examples from field theory and string\ntheory that support the conjecture, we still lack a general proof of its\nvalidity. In the present Letter we prove that the weak gravity conjecture (and,\nin particular, the mass-charge upper bound $m/m_{\\text{P}}<q$) can be inferred\ndirectly from Bekenstein's generalized second law of thermodynamics, a law\nwhich is widely believed to reflect a fundamental aspect of the elusive theory\nof quantum gravity.\n", "  We define a natural counting function for BPS black holes in $K3 \\times T^2$\ncompactification of type II string theory, and observe that it is given by a\nweight 3/2 mock modular form discovered by Zagier. This hints at tantalizing\nrelations connecting black holes, string theory, and number theory.\n", "  The ground state entanglement of the system, both in discrete-time and\ncontinuous-time cases, is quantified through the linear entropy. The result\nshows that the entanglement increases as the interaction between the particles\nincreases in both time scales. It is also found that the strength of the\nharmonic potential affects the formation rate of the entanglement of the\nsystem. The different feature of the entanglement between continuous-time and\ndiscrete-time scales is that, for discrete-time entanglement, there is a\ncut-off condition. This condition implies that the system can never be in a\nmaximally entangled state.\n", "  A velocity-selective spectroscopy technique for studying the spectra from hot\nRydberg gases is presented. This method provides high-resolution measurement of\nthe spectrum interval. Based on this method, the velocity-selective hyperfine\nsplitting of intermediate states is measured, as well as the Doppler-free\nfine-structure splitting of the Rydberg states via two-photon Rydberg\nexcitation in a room-temperature 133Cs vapor cell. The experiment data and\ntheoretical predictions show excellent agreement.\n", "  Suppose we assume that (a) information about a black hole is encoded in its\nHawking radiation and (b) causality is not violated to leading order in gently\ncurved spacetime. Then we argue that spacetime cannot just be described as a\nmanifold with a shape; it must be given an additional attribute which we call\n`thickness'. This thickness characterizes the spread of the quantum gravity\nwavefunctional in superspace -- the space of all 3-geometries. Low energy\nparticles travel on spacetime without noticing the thickness parameter, so they\njust see an effective manifold. Objects with energy large enough to create a\nhorizon do notice the finite thickness; this modifies the semiclassical\nevolution in such a way that we avoid horizon formation and the consequent\nviolation of causality.\n", "  Quantum Metrology calculates the ultimate precision of all estimation\nstrategies, measuring what is their root mean-square error (RMSE) and their\nFisher information. Here, instead, we ask how many bits of the parameter we can\nrecover, namely we derive an information-theoretic quantum metrology. In this\nsetting we redefine \"Heisenberg bound\" and \"standard quantum limit\" (the usual\nbenchmarks in quantum estimation theory), and show that the former can be\nattained only by sequential strategies or parallel strategies that employ\nentanglement among probes, whereas parallel-separable strategies are limited by\nthe latter. We highlight the differences between this setting and the\nRMSE-based one.\n", "  We construct an infinite-dimensional space of solutions to Vasiliev's\nequations in four dimensions that are asymptotic to AdS spacetime and superpose\nmassless scalar particle modes over static higher spin black holes. Each\nsolution is obtained by a large gauge transformation of an all-order\nperturbatively defined particular solution given in a simple gauge, in which\nthe spacetime connection vanishes, the twistor space connection is holomorphic,\nand all local degrees of freedom are encoded into the residual twistor space\ndependence of the spacetime zero-forms. The latter are expanded over two dual\nspaces of Fock space operators, corresponding to scalar particle and static\nblack hole modes, equipped with positive definite sesquilinear and bilinear\nforms, respectively. Switching on an AdS vacuum gauge function, the twistor\nspace connection becomes analytic at generic spacetime points, which makes it\npossible to reach Vasiliev's gauge, in which Fronsdal fields arise\nasymptotically, by another large transformation given here at first order. The\nparticle and black hole modes are related by a twistor space Fourier transform,\nresulting in a black hole backreaction already at the second order of classical\nperturbation theory. We speculate on the existence of a fine-tuned branch of\nmoduli space that is free from black hole modes and directly related to the\nquasi-local deformed Fronsdal theory. Finally, we comment on a possible\ninterpretation of the higher spin black hole solutions as black-hole\nmicrostates.\n", "  Despite the outstanding achievements of modern cosmology, the classical\ndispute on the precise value of $H_0$, which is the first ever parameter of\nmodern cosmology and one of the prime parameters in the field, still goes on\nand on after over half a century of measurements. Recently the dispute came to\nthe spotlight with renewed strength owing to the significant tension (at\n$>3\\sigma$ c.l.) between the latest Planck determination obtained from the CMB\nanisotropies and the local (distance ladder) measurement from the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST), based on Cepheids. In this work, we investigate the impact of\nthe running vacuum model (RVM) and related models on such a controversy. For\nthe RVM, the vacuum energy density $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ carries a mild dependence\non the cosmic expansion rate, i.e. $\\rho_{\\Lambda}(H)$, which allows to\nameliorate the fit quality to the overall $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB$ cosmological\nobservations as compared to the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. By letting the\nRVM to deviate from the vacuum option, the equation of state $w=-1$ continues\nto be favored by the overall fit. Vacuum dynamics also predicts the following:\ni) the CMB range of values for $H_0$ is more favored than the local ones, and\nii) smaller values for $\\sigma_8(0)$. As a result, a better account for the LSS\nstructure formation data is achieved as compared to the $\\Lambda$CDM, which is\nbased on a rigid (i.e. non-dynamical) $\\Lambda$ term.\n", "  In nonlinear dynamics, and to a lesser extent in other fields, a widely used\nmeasure of complexity is the Permutation Entropy. But there is still no known\nmethod to determine the accuracy of this measure. There has been little\nresearch on the statistical properties of this quantity that characterize time\nseries. The literature describes some resampling methods of quantities used in\nnonlinear dynamics - as the largest Lyapunov exponent - but all of these seems\nto fail. In this contribution we propose a parametric bootstrap methodology\nusing a symbolic representation of the time series in order to obtain the\ndistribution of the Permutation Entropy estimator. We perform several time\nseries simulations given by well known stochastic processes: the 1=f? noise\nfamily, and show in each case that the proposed accuracy measure is as\nefficient as the one obtained by the frequentist approach of repeating the\nexperiment. The complexity of brain electrical activity, measured by the\nPermutation Entropy, has been extensively used in epilepsy research for\ndetection in dynamical changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) signal with no\nconsideration of the variability of this complexity measure. An application of\nthe parametric bootstrap methodology is used to compare normal and pre-ictal\nEEG signals.\n", "  We present a bimetric low-energy effective theory of fractional quantum Hall\n(FQH) states that describes the topological properties and a gapped collective\nexcitation, known as Girvin-Macdonald-Platzman (GMP) mode. The theory consist\nof a topological Chern-Simons action, coupled to a symmetric rank two tensor,\nand an action \\`a la bimetric gravity, describing the gapped dynamics of the\nspin-$2$ GMP mode. The theory is formulated in curved ambient space and is\nspatially covariant, which allows to restrict the form of the effective action\nand the values of phenomenological coefficients. Using the bimetric theory we\ncalculate the projected static structure factor up to the $k^6$ order in the\nmomentum expansion. To provide further support for the theory, we derive the\nlong wave limit of the GMP algebra, the dispersion relation of the GMP mode,\nand the Hall viscosity of FQH states. We also comment on the possible\napplications to fractional Chern insulators, where closely related structures\narise. Finally, it is shown that the familiar FQH observables acquire a curious\ngeometric interpretation within the bimetric formalism.\n", "  The bulk reconstruction formula for a Euclidean anti-de Sitter space is\ndirectly related to the inverse of the Gel'fand-Graev-Radon transform.\nCorrelation functions of a conformal scalar field theory in the boundary are\nthereby related to correlation functions of a self-interacting scalar field\ntheory in the bulk at different loop orders.\n", "  Vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields are altered in presence of a strong\ngravitational background, with important physical consequences. We argue that a\nnon-trivial spacetime geometry can act as an optically active medium for\nquantum electromagnetic radiation, in such a way that the state of polarization\nof radiation changes in time, even in the absence of electromagnetic sources.\nThis is a quantum effect, and is a consequence of an anomaly related to the\nclassical invariance under electric-magnetic duality rotations in Maxwell\ntheory.\n", "  The measurement of the top quark mass has large systematic uncertainties\ncoming from the Monte Carlo simulations that are used to match theory and\nexperiment. We explore how much that uncertainty can be reduced by using jet\ngrooming procedures. We estimate the inherent ambiguity in what is meant by\nMonte Carlo mass to be around 530 MeV without any corrections. This uncertainty\ncan be reduced by 60% to 200 MeV by calibrating to the W mass and a further 33%\nto 140 MeV by applying soft-drop jet grooming (or by 20% more to 170 MeV with\ntrimming). At e+e- colliders, the associated uncertainty is around 110 MeV,\nreducing to 50 MeV after calibrating to the W mass. By analyzing the tuning\nparameters, we conclude that the importance of jet grooming after calibrating\nto the W mass is to reduce sensitivity to the underlying event.\n", "  We present modeling and design of singly-resonant optical parametric\noscillator (SR-OPO) with an intracavity idler absorber to enhance the\nconversion efficiency for the signal, by suppressing the back conversion of the\nsignal and idler to the pump. Following plane wave analysis, we arrive at the\noptimum parameters of the OPO to achieve high conversion efficiency for the\nsignal. For a given pump intensity, we have analyzed the effect of position and\nnumber of absorbers required for optimum performance of the device. The model\nis also extended to the case in which the signal is absorbed, yielding higher\nconversion efficiency for the idler (in mid-IR region). The magnitude of\nabsorption and the effect of inter-crystal phase shift on the conversion\nefficiency are also discussed. We also present an analytical solution for\ntwin-crystal SR-OPO with an absorber in between; taking into account the\nvariation of signal amplitude inside the cavity, we re-affirm that the often\nused 'constant signal-wave approximation' is valid if the reflectivity of the\noutput coupler is high for the signal.\n", "  Local configurational symmetry in lattice structures may give rise to\nstationary, compact solutions, even in the absence of disorder and\nnonlinearity. These compact solutions are related to the existence of flat\ndispersion curves (bands). Nonlinearity can destabilize such compactons. One\ncommon flat-band-generating system is the 1D cross-stitch model, in which\ncompactons were shown to exist for the photonic lattice with Kerr nonlinearity.\nThe compactons exist there already in the linear regime and are not generally\ndestructed by that nonlinearity. Smooth nonlinearity of this kind does not\nallow doing a complete stability analysis for this chain. We consider a\ndiscrete mechanical system with flat dispersion bands, in which the\nnonlinearity exists due to impact constraints. There, one can use the concept\nof the saltation matrix for the analytic construction of the monodromy matrix.\nBesides, we consider a smooth nonlinear lattice with linearly connected\nmassless boxes, each containing two symmetric anharmonic oscillators. In this\nmodel, the flat bands and discrete compactons also readily emerge. This system\nalso permits performing comprehensive stability analysis, at least in the\nanti-continuum limit, due to the reduced number of degrees-of-freedom. In both\nsystems, there exist two types of localization. The first one is the complete\nlocalization, and the second one is the more common exponential localization.\nThe latter type is associated with discrete breathers (DBs). Two principal\nmechanisms for the loss of stability are revealed. The first one is the\npossible internal instability of the symmetric and/or antisymmetric solution in\nthe individual unit cell of the chain. One can interpret this instability\npattern as internal resonance between the compacton and the DB. The other\nmechanism is global instability related to resonance of the stationary solution\nwith the propagation frequencies.\n", "  We investigate the plasmon dispersion relation and damping rate of collective\nexcitations in a double-layer system consisting of bilayer graphene and GaAs\nquantum well, separated by a distance, at zero temperature with no interlayer\ntunneling. We use the random-phase-approximation dielectric function and take\ninto account the nonhomogeneity of the dielectric background of the system. We\nshow that the plasmon frequencies and damping rates depend considerably on\ninterlayer correlation parameters, electron densities and dielectric constants\nof the contacting media.\n", "  In this letter, we study the Alice-Bob peakon system generated from an\nintegrable peakon system through using the strategy of the so-called Alice-Bob\nnon-local KdV approach [13]. Non-local integrable peakon equations are obtained\nand shown to have peakon solutions.\n", "  Single layer (SL) phosphorus (phosphorene) has drawn considerable research\nattention recently as a two-dimensional (2D) material for application promises.\nIt is a semiconductor showing superior transport and optical properties.\nFew-layer or SL black phosphorus has been successfully isolated by exfoliation\nfrom bulk crystals and extensively studied thereof for its electronic and\noptical properties. Blue phosphorus (blueP), an allotrope of black phosphorus\nwhere atoms are arranged in a more flat atomic configuration, has been recently\nsuggested by theory to exist in the SL form on some substrates. In this work,\nwe report the formation of a blueP-like epilayer on Au(111) by molecular-beam\nepitaxy. In particular, we uncover by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\none-dimensional (1D) atomic chains at low coverage, which develop into more\ncompact islands or patches of $(\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3})R30^\\circ$ structure\nwith increasing coverage before blueP-like islands nucleate and grow. We also\nnote an interesting growth characteristic where the\n$(\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3})R30^\\circ$ surface at intermediate coverage tends to\nphase-separate into locally low-coverage 1D chain and high-coverage blueP-like\nstructures, respectively. This experiment thus not only lends a support of the\nrecently proposed half-layer by half-layer (HLBHL) growth mechanism but also\nreveals the kinetic details of blueP growth processes.\n", "  The relationship between bulk and boundary properties is one of the founding\nfeatures of (Rational) Conformal Field Theory. Our goal in this paper is to\nexplore the possibility of having an equivalent relationship in the context of\nlattice models. We focus on models based on the Temperley-Lieb algebra, and use\nthe concept of braid translation, which is a natural way to close an open spin\nchain by adding an interaction between the first and last spins using braiding\nto bring them next to each other. The interaction thus obtained is in general\nnon-local, but has the key feature that it is expressed solely in terms of the\nalgebra for the open spin chain - the ordinary Temperley-Lieb algebra and its\nblob algebra generalization. This is in contrast with the usual periodic spin\nchains which involve only local interactions, and are described by the periodic\nTL algebra. We show that for the Restricted Solid-On-Solid models, which are\nknown to be described by minimal unitary CFTs in the continuum limit, the braid\ntranslation in fact does provide the ordinary periodic model starting from the\nopen model with fixed boundary conditions on the two sides of the strip. This\nstatement has a precise mathematical formulation, which is a pull-back map\nbetween irreducible modules of, respectively, the blob algebra and the affine\nTL algebra. We then turn to the same kind of analysis for two models whose\ncontinuum limits are Logarithmic CFTs - the alternating gl(1|1) and sl(2|1)\nspin chains. We find that the result for minimal models does not hold any\nlonger: braid translation of the relevant TL modules does not give rise to the\nmodules known to be present in the periodic chains. In the gl(1|1) case, the\ncontent in terms of the irreducibles is the same, as well as the spectrum, but\nthe detailed structure (like logarithmic coupling) is profoundly different.\nThis carries over to the continuum limit.\n", "  We establish a comprehensive description of the patterns formed when a\nwetting liquid displaces a viscous fluid confined in a porous medium. Building\non model microfluidic experiments, we evidence four imbibition scenarios all\nyielding different large-scale morphologies. Combining high-resolution imaging\nand confocal microscopy, we show that they originate from two\nliquid-entrainment transitions and a Rayleigh-Plateau instability at the pore\nscale. Finally, we demonstrate and explain the long-time coarsening of the\nresulting patterns.\n", "  IceCube is a neutrino observatory deployed in the glacial ice at the\ngeographic South Pole. The $\\nu_\\mu$ energy unfolding described in this paper\nis based on data taken with IceCube in its 79-string configuration.\n  A sample of muon neutrino charged-current interactions with a purity of\n99.5\\% was selected by means of a multivariate classification process based on\nmachine learning. The subsequent unfolding was performed using the software\n\\truee. The resulting spectrum covers an E$_\\nu$-range of more than four orders\nof magnitude from 125 GeV to 3.2 PeV. Compared to the Honda atmospheric\nneutrino flux model, the energy spectrum shows an excess of more than\n$1.9\\,\\sigma$ in four adjacent bins for neutrino energies\n$E_\\nu\\geq177.8$\\,TeV. The obtained spectrum is fully compatible with previous\nmeasurements of the atmospheric neutrino flux and recent IceCube measurements\nof a flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos.\n", "  We introduce the `stealth bosons' $S$, light boosted particles with a decay\n$S \\to AA \\to q \\bar q q \\bar q$ into two daughter bosons $A$, which\nsubsequently decay into four quarks that are reconstructed as a single fat jet.\nVariables that measure the two-pronged structure of fat jets, which are used\nfor diboson resonance searches in hadronic or semi-leptonic final states,\nclassify the jets produced in stealth boson decays as QCD-like - actually, for\nthese variables they may seem more background-like than the QCD background\nitself. The number of tracks in those jets can also be, on average, much higher\nthan for the fat jets arising from the hadronic decay of boosted $W$ and $Z$\nbosons. Therefore, these elusive particles are hard to spot in standard\nsearches. Heavy resonances decaying into two such stealth bosons, or one plus a\n$W/Z$ boson, could offer an explanation for the recurrent small excesses found\nin hadronic diboson resonance searches near an invariant mass of 2 TeV.\n", "  We study the thermal diffusivity $D_T$ in models of metals without\nquasiparticle excitations (`strange metals'). The many-body quantum chaos and\ntransport properties of such metals can be efficiently described by a\nholographic representation in a gravitational theory in an emergent curved\nspacetime with an additional spatial dimension. We find that at generic\ninfra-red fixed points $D_T$ is always related to parameters characterizing\nmany-body quantum chaos: the butterfly velocity $v_B$, and Lyapunov time\n$\\tau_L$ through $D_T \\sim v_B^2 \\tau_L$. The relationship holds independently\nof the charge density, periodic potential strength or magnetic field at the\nfixed point. The generality of this result follows from the observation that\nthe thermal conductivity of strange metals depends only on the metric near the\nhorizon of a black hole in the emergent spacetime, and is otherwise insensitive\nto the profile of any matter fields.\n", "  We identify the Taylor coefficients of the transfer matrices corresponding to\nquantum toroidal algebras with the elliptic local and non-local integrals of\nmotion introduced by Kojima, Shiraishi, Watanabe, and one of the authors.\n  That allows us to prove the Litvinov conjectures on the Intermediate Long\nWave model.\n  We also discuss the (gl(m),gl(n)) duality of XXZ models in quantum toroidal\nsetting and the implications for the quantum KdV model. In particular, we\nconjecture that the spectrum of non-local integrals of motion of Bazhanov,\nLukyanov, and Zamolodchikov is described by Gaudin Bethe ansatz equations\nassociated to affine sl(2).\n", "  Connectivity patterns of relevance in neuroscience and systems biology can be\nencoded in hierarchical modular networks (HMNs). Moreover, recent studies\nhighlight the role of hierarchical modular organization in shaping brain\nactivity patterns, providing an excellent substrate to promote both the\nsegregation and integration of neural information. Here we propose an extensive\nnumerical analysis of the critical spreading rate (or \"epidemic\" threshold)\n--separating a phase with endemic persistent activity from one in which\nactivity ceases-- on diverse HMNs. By employing analytical and computational\ntechniques we determine the nature of such a threshold and scrutinize how it\ndepends on general structural features of the underlying HMN. We critically\ndiscuss the extent to which current graph-spectral methods can be applied to\npredict the onset of spreading in HMNs, and we propose the network topological\ndimension as a relevant and unifying structural parameter, controlling the\nepidemic threshold.\n", "  For long wavelengths three-dimensional connected metallic wire meshes are\nimpenetrable by light and have an electromagnetic response similar to that of\nan electron gas below the plasma frequency. Surprisingly, here it is shown that\nwhen two opaque metallic meshes are spatially-interlaced the combined structure\nenables an anomalous light tunneling in the long wavelength regime. The effect\nis due to the destructive interference of the waves scattered by the two wire\nmeshes, which leads to a Fano-type resonance.\n", "  The work describes a first-principles-based computational strategy for\nstudying structural phase transitions, and in particular, for determination of\nthe so-called Landau-Devonshire potential - the classical zero-temperature\nlimit of the Gibbs energy, expanded in terms of order parameters. It exploits\nthe configuration space attached to the eigenvectors of the modes frozen in the\nground state, rather than the space spanned by the unstable modes of the\nhigh-symmetry phase, as done usually. This allows us to carefully probe the\npart of the energy surface in the vicinity of the ground state, which is most\nrelevant for the properties of the ordered phase. We apply this procedure to\nBiFeO$_3$ and perform ab-initio calculations in order to determine potential\nenergy contributions associated with strain, polarization and oxygen octahedra\ntilt degrees of freedom, compatible with its two-formula unit cell periodic\nboundary conditions.\n", "  We study models that produce a Higgs boson plus photon ($h^0 \\gamma$)\nresonance at the LHC. When the resonance is a $Z'$ boson, decays to $h^0\n\\gamma$ occur at one loop. If the $Z'$ boson couples at tree-level to quarks,\nthen the $h^0 \\gamma$ branching fraction is typically of order $10^{-5}$ or\nsmaller. Nevertheless, there are models that would allow the observation of $Z'\n\\to h^0 \\gamma$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with a cross section times branching\nfraction larger than 1 fb for a $Z'$ mass in the 200--450 GeV range, and larger\nthan 0.1 fb for a mass up to 800 GeV. The 1-loop decay of the $Z'$ into lepton\npairs competes with $h^0 \\gamma$, even if the $Z'$ couplings to leptons vanish\nat tree level. We also present a model in which a $Z'$ boson decays into a\nHiggs boson and a pair of collimated photons, mimicking an $h^0 \\gamma$\nresonance. In this model, the $h^0 \\gamma$ resonance search would be the\ndiscovery mode for a $Z'$ as heavy as 2 TeV. When the resonance is a scalar,\nalthough decay to $h^0 \\gamma$ is forbidden by angular momentum conservation,\nthe $h^0$ plus collimated photons channel is allowed. We comment on prospects\nof observing an $h^0 \\gamma$ resonance through different Higgs decays, on\nconstraints from related searches, and on models where $h^0$ is replaced by a\nnonstandard Higgs boson.\n", "  We perform numerical simulations of a turbulent channel flow over an\nhyper-elastic wall. In the fluid region the flow is governed by the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, while the solid is a neo-Hookean\nmaterial satisfying the incompressible Mooney-Rivlin law. The multiphase flow\nis solved with a one-continuum formulation, using a monolithic velocity field\nfor both the fluid and solid phase, which allows the use of a fully Eulerian\nformulation. The simulations are carried out at Reynolds bulk $Re=2800$ and\nexamine the effect of different elasticity and viscosity of the deformable\nwall. We show that the skin friction increases monotonically with the material\nelastic modulus. The turbulent flow in the channel is affected by the moving\nwall even at low values of elasticity since non-zero fluctuations of vertical\nvelocity at the interface influence the flow dynamics. The near-wall streaks\nand the associated quasi-streamwise vortices are strongly reduced near a highly\nelastic wall while the flow becomes more correlated in the spanwise direction,\nsimilarly to what happens for flows over rough and porous walls. As a\nconsequence, the mean velocity profile in wall units is shifted downwards when\nshown in logarithmic scale, and the slope of the inertial range increases in\ncomparison to that for the flow over a rigid wall. We propose a correlation\nbetween the downward shift of the inertial range, its slope and the wall-normal\nvelocity fluctuations at the wall, extending results for the flow over rough\nwalls. We finally show that the interface deformation is determined by the\nfluid fluctuations when the viscosity of the elastic layer is low, while when\nthis is high the deformation is limited by the solid properties.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate how competition between band inversion and\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) results in nontrivial evolution of band topology,\ntaking antiperovskite Ba$_3$SnO as a prototype material. A key observation is\nthat when the band inversion dominates over SOC, there appear \"twin\" Dirac\ncones in the band structure. Due to the twin Dirac cones, the band shows highly\npeculiar structure in which the upper cone of one of the twin continuously\ntransforms to the lower cone of the other. Interestingly, the relative size of\nthe band inversion and SOC is controlled in this series of antiperovskite\nA$_3$EO by substitution of A (Ca, Sr, Ba) and/or E (Sn, Pb) atoms. Analysis of\nan effective model shows that the emergence of twin Dirac cones is general,\nwhich makes our argument a promising starting point for finding a singular band\nstructure induced by the competing band inversion and SOC.\n", "  We define the stringent coherence witness as an observable which has zero\nmean value for all of incoherent states and hence a nonzero mean value\nindicates the coherence. The existence of such witnesses are proved for any\nfinite-dimension states. Not only is the witness efficient in testing whether\nthe state is coherent, the mean value is also quantitatively related to the\namount of coherence contained in the state. For an unknown state, the modulus\nof the mean value of a normalized witness provides a tight lower bound of\n$l_1$-norm of coherence in the state. When we have some previous knowledge of\nthe state, the optimal witness is derived such that its measured mean value,\ncalled the witnessed coherence, equals to the $l_1$-norm of coherence. One can\nalso fix the witness and implement some incoherent operations on the state\nbefore the witness is measured. In this case, the measured mean value cannot\nreach the witnessed coherence if the initial state and the fixed witness does\nnot match well. Based this result, we design a quantum coherence game. Our\nresults provides a way to directly measure the coherence in arbitrary finite\ndimension states and an operational interpretation of the $l_1$-norm of\ncoherence.\n", "  Light beams can be characterized by their complex spatial profiles in both\nintensity and phase. Analogous to time signals, which can be decomposed into\nmultiple orthogonal frequency functions, a light beam can also be decomposed\ninto a set of spatial modes that are taken from an orthogonal basis. Such a\ndecomposition can provide a tool for spatial spectrum analysis, which may allow\nthe stable, accurate and robust extraction of physical object information that\nmay not be readily achievable using traditional approaches. As an example, we\nmeasure the opening angle of an object using the complex spectrum of orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) modes as the basis, achieving a more than 15 dB\nsignal-to-noise ratio. We find that the dip (i.e., notch) positions of the OAM\nintensity spectrum are dependent on an object's opening angle but independent\nof the object opening's angular orientation, whereas the slope of the OAM phase\nspectrum is dependent on the object opening's orientation but independent on\nthe opening angle.\n", "  Multiscale interaction between the magnetic island and turbulence has been\ndemonstrated through simultaneous two-dimensional measurements of turbulence\nand temperature and flow profiles. The magnetic island and turbulence mutually\ninteract via the coupling between the electron temperature ($T_e$) gradient,\nthe $T_e$ turbulence, and the poloidal flow. The $T_e$ gradient altered by the\nmagnetic island is peaked outside and flattened inside the island. The $T_e$\nturbulence can appear in the increased $T_e$ gradient regions. The combined\neffects of the $T_e$ gradient and the the poloidal flow shear determine\ntwo-dimensional distribution of the $T_e$ turbulence. When the reversed\npoloidal flow forms, it can maintain the steepest $T_e$ gradient and the\nmagnetic island acts more like a electron heat transport barrier.\nInterestingly, when the $T_e$ gradient, the $T_e$ turbulence, and the flow\nshear increase beyond critical levels, the magnetic island turns into a fast\nelectron heat transport channel, which directly leads to the minor disruption.\n", "  In the lore of quantum metrology, one often hears (or reads) the following\nno-go theorem: If you put vacuum into one input port of a balanced Mach-Zehnder\nInterferometer, then no matter what you put into the other input port, and no\nmatter what your detection scheme, the sensitivity can never be better than the\nshot noise limit (SNL). Often the proof of this theorem is cited to be in Ref.\n[C. Caves, Phys. Rev. D 23, 1693 (1981)], but upon further inspection, no such\nclaim is made there. A quantum-Fisher-information-based argument suggestive of\nthis no-go theorem appears in Ref. [M. Lang and C. Caves, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,\n173601 (2013)], but is not stated in its full generality. Here we thoroughly\nexplore this no-go theorem and give the rigorous statement: the no-go theorem\nholds whenever the unknown phase shift is split between both arms of the\ninterferometer, but remarkably does not hold when only one arm has the unknown\nphase shift. In the latter scenario, we provide an explicit measurement\nstrategy that beats the SNL. We also point out that these two scenarios are\nphysically different and correspond to different types of sensing applications.\n", "  We provide an analytical and theoretical study of exotic looped trajectories\n(ELTs) in a double-slit interferometer with quantum marking. We use an excited\nRydberg-like atom and which-way detectors such as superconducting cavities,\njust as in the Scully-Englert-Walther interferometer. We indicate appropriate\nconditions on the atomic beam or superconducting cavities so that we determine\nan interference pattern and fringe visibility exclusive from the ELTs. We\nquantitatively describe our results for Rubidium atoms and propose this\nframework as an alternative scheme to the double-slit experiment modified to\ninterfere only these exotic trajectories.\n", "  We introduce a magnetic analogue of the seven-dimensional nonassociative\noctonionic R-flux algebra that describes the phase space of M2-branes in\nfour-dimensional locally non-geometric M-theory backgrounds. We show that these\ntwo algebras are related by a Spin(7) automorphism of the 3-algebra that\nprovides a covariant description of the eight-dimensional M-theory phase space.\nWe argue that this algebra also underlies the phase space of electrons probing\na smeared magnetic monopole in quantum gravity by showing that upon appropriate\ncontractions, the algebra reduces to the noncommutative algebra of a spin foam\nmodel of three-dimensional quantum gravity, or to the nonassociative algebra of\nelectrons in a background of uniform magnetic charge. We realise this set-up in\nM-theory as M-waves probing a delocalised Kaluza-Klein monopole, and show that\nthis system also has a seven-dimensional phase space. We suggest that the\nsmeared Kaluza-Klein monopole is non-geometric because it cannot be described\nby a local metric. This is the magnetic analogue of the local non-geometry of\nthe R-flux background and arises because the smeared Kaluza-Klein monopole is\ndescribed by a U(1)-gerbe rather than a U(1)-fibration.\n", "  A consideration of waves propagating parallel to the external magnetic field\nis presented. The dielectric permeability tensor is derived from quantum\nkinetic equations with non-trivial equilibrium spin-distribution functions\n(NTESDF) in the linear approximation on amplitude of wave perturbations. In\ngeneral case, x- and y-projections of the SDF are nonzero which is called the\nnon-trivial regime. Corresponding equilibrium solution is found. Contribution\nof the NTESDF appears in the dielectric permeability tensor in the additive\nform. It is explicitly found here. Corresponding modification in the dispersion\nequation for the transverse waves is derived. Contribution of NTESDF in the\nspectrum of transverse waves is calculated numerically. It is found that the\nterm caused by the NTESDF can be comparable with the classic terms for the\nrelatively small wave vectors and frequencies above the cyclotron frequency. In\nmajority of regimes, the extra spin caused term dominates over the spin term\nfound earlier, except the small frequency regime, where their contributions in\nthe whistler spectrum are comparable. A decrease of the left-hand circularly\npolarized wave frequency, an increase of the high-frequency right-hand\ncircularly polarized wave frequency, and a decrease of frequency changing by an\nincrease of frequency at the growth of the wave vector for the whistler are\nfound. A dramatic decrease of the spin wave frequency resulting in several\ntimes larger group velocity of the spin wave is found either. Found dispersion\nequations are used for obtaining of an effective quantum hydrodynamics\nreproducing these results. This generalization requires the introduction of\ncorresponding equation of state for the thermal part of the spin current in the\nspin evolution equation.\n", "  Three new heuristic derivations of the Planck scale are described. They are\nbased on basic principles or phenomena of relativistic gravity and quantum\nphysics. The Planck scale quantities thus obtained are within one order of\nmagnitude of the \"standard\" ones. We contemplate the pair creation of causal\nbubbles so small that they can be treated as particles, the scattering of a\nmatter wave off the background curvature of spacetime that it induces, and the\nHawking evaporation of a black hole in a single burst at the Planck scale.\n", "  Quantum vortices in superfluids may capture matter and deposit it inside\ntheir core. By doping vortices with foreign particles one can effectively\nvisualize them and study experimentally. To acquire a better understanding of\nthe interaction of quantum vortices with matter and clarify the details of\nrecent experiments properties of doped vortices are investigated here\ntheoretically in the regimes where the doping mass becomes close to the total\nmass of superfluid particles forming a vortex. Such formations are dynamically\nstable and, possessing both vorticity and enhanced inertia, demonstrate\nproperties which are different from the pure vortex case. The goal of this\npaper is to define and investigate the universal aspects of a heavily doped\nvortex behavior which can be realized in different types of quantum mixtures.\nThe proposed 3D model is based on a system of coupled semiclassical matter wave\nequations which are solved numerically in a wide range of physical parameters.\nThe size, geometry, solubility and binding energy of dopants in different\nregimes are discussed. A coupled motion of a vortex-dopant complex and\ndecoupling conditions are studied. The reconnection of vortices, taken as an\nexample of a fundamental process responsible for the evolution of a quantum\nturbulent state, is modeled to illustrate the difference between the light and\nheavy doping cases.\n", "  We investigate the demagnetization dynamics of the cycloidal and sinusoidal\nphases of multiferroic TbMnO$_3$ by means of time-resolved resonant soft x-ray\ndiffraction following excitation by an optical pump. Using orthogonal linear\nx-ray polarizations, we suceeded in disentangling the response of the\nmultiferroic cycloidal spin order from the sinusoidal antiferromagnetic order\nin the time domain. This enables us to identify the transient magnetic phase\ncreated by intense photoexcitation of the electrons and subsequent heating of\nthe spin system on a picosecond timescale. The transient phase is shown to be a\nspin density wave, as in the adiabatic case, which nevertheless retains the\nwave vector of the cycloidal long range order. Two different pump photon\nenergies, 1.55 eV and 3.1 eV, lead to population of the conduction band\npredominantly via intersite $d$-$d$ transitions or intrasite $p$-$d$\ntransitions, respectively. We find that the nature of the optical excitation\ndoes not play an important role in determining the dynamics of magnetic order\nmelting. Further, we observe that the orbital reconstruction, which is induced\nby the spin ordering, disappears on a timescale comparable to that of the\ncycloidal order, attesting to a direct coupling between magnetic and orbital\norders. Our observations are discussed in the context of recent theoretical\nmodels of demagnetization dynamics in strongly correlated systems, revealing\nthe potential of this type of measurement as a benchmark for such complex\ntheoretical studies.\n", "  In this paper we propose that bubbles of AdS within Minkowski spacetime,\nstabilized at a finite radius by stiff matter and an electromagnetic gas, can\nbe an alternative endpoint of gravitational collapse. The bubbles are\nhorizonless with a size up to 12.5% larger than their Schwarzschild radius\ndepending on their charge. We argue that they are stable against small\nperturbations, and have thermodynamical properties similar to those of real\nblack holes. We provide a realization of the bubbles within string theory that\nrelies on a specific brane intersection giving rise to a shell carrying\ndissolved charges from lower dimensional D-branes as well as a gas of open\nstrings. We also note that our construction provides a new way of understanding\nthe entropy of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes in the extremal limit.\n", "  Ray optics has proven to be an effcient and versatile tool to describe\ndielectric optical microcavities and their far-field emission based on the\nprinciple of ray-wave correspondence. Whereas often the well-known ray-optics\nat planar interfaces yields reasonable results, semiclassically and\nboundary-curvature induced corrections will become more important as the cavity\nsize is further reduced. In this paper we summarize the various ray optics\ndescriptions of optical microresonators, paying in addition special attention\nto the differences that arise between chaotic vs. non-chaotic (integrable or\nnearly integrable) resonator geometries, respectively. Whereas the far-field\npattern in the chaotic case is known to be determined by the overlap of the\nunstable manifold with the leaky region, it results from the emission of\ntrajectories with the smallest nonzero decay rates in the non-chaotic\nsituation. We present an enhanced ray optical description, extended by\nwave-inspired (semiclassical) corrections, and discuss their consequences for\nthe ray dynamics. In particular we find clear indications for the presence of\nattractors resulting from the non-Hamiltonian character of the extended ray\ndynamics in phase space. We illustrate their impact on the far-field emission\nand show that it can considerably differ from the conventional ray description\nresult.\n", "  For a quantum system undergoing a unitary process work is commonly defined\nbased on the Two Projective Measurement (TPM) protocol which measures the\nenergies of the system before and after the process. However, it is well known\nthat projective measurements disregard quantum coherences of the system with\nrespect to the energy basis, thus removing potential quantum signatures in the\nwork distribution. Here we consider weak measurements of the system's energy\ndifference and establish corrections to work averages arising from initial\nsystem coherences. We discuss two weak measurement protocols that couple the\nsystem to a detector, prepared and measured either in the momentum or the\nposition eigenstates. Work averages are derived for when the system starts in\nthe proper thermal state versus when the initial system state is a pure state\nwith thermal diagonal elements and coherences characterised by a set of phases.\nWe show that by controlling only the phase differences between the energy\neigenstate contributions in the system's initial pure state, the average work\ndone during the same unitary process can be controlled. By changing the phases\nalone one can toggle from regimes where the systems absorbs energy, i.e. a work\ncost, to the ones where it emits energy, i.e. work can be drawn. This suggests\nthat the coherences are additional resources that can be used to manipulate or\nstore energy in a quantum system.\n", "  Loss is inevitable for the optical system due to absorption of materials,\nscattering caused by the defects and surface roughness. In quantum optical\ncircuits, the loss can not only reduce the intensity of signal, but also affect\nthe performance of quantum operations. In this work, we divide losses into\nunbalanced linear loss and shared common loss, and provide a detailed analysis\non how loss affects the integrated linear optical quantum gates. It is found\nthat the orthogonality of eigenmodes and the unitary phase relation of the\ncoupled waveguide modes are destroyed by the loss. As a result, the fidelity of\nsingle- and two-qubit operations decrease significant as the shared loss\nbecomes comparable to the coupling strength. Our results are important for the\ninvestigation of large-scale photonic integrated quantum information process.\n", "  We present an analytical solution for the projectile coplanar motion under\nconstant drag parametrised by the velocity angle. We found the locus formed by\nthe apices of the projectile trajectories. The range and time of flight are\nobtained numerically and we find that the optimal launching angle is smaller\nthan in the free drag case. This is a good example of problems with constant\ndissipation of energy that includes curvature, and it is proper for\nintermediate courses of mechanics.\n", "  We investigate time-series obtained from gyrofluid simulations in coupled\nedge/scrape-off layer turbulence characteristic for fusion edge-region plasmas.\nBlob birth near the separatrix produces intermittent signals whose statistics\ndepend on the ion mass of the reactor fuel, pointing towards overall slower\ndynamics for heavier isotopes. We find that a recently established shot-noise\nstochastic model for scrape-off layer fluctuations coincides reasonably well\nwith the numerical simulations performed in this contribution.\n", "  Recent advances in imaging sensors and digital light projection technology\nhave facilitated a rapid progress in 3D optical sensing, enabling 3D surfaces\nof complex-shaped objects to be captured with improved resolution and accuracy.\nHowever, due to the large number of projection patterns required for phase\nrecovery and disambiguation, the maximum fame rates of current 3D shape\nmeasurement techniques are still limited to the range of hundreds of frames per\nsecond (fps). Here, we demonstrate a new 3D dynamic imaging technique, Micro\nFourier Transform Profilometry ($\\mu$FTP), which can capture 3D surfaces of\ntransient events at up to 10,000 fps based on our newly developed high-speed\nfringe projection system. Compared with existing techniques, $\\mu$FTP has the\nprominent advantage of recovering an accurate, unambiguous, and dense 3D point\ncloud with only two projected patterns. Furthermore, the phase information is\nencoded within a single high-frequency fringe image, thereby allowing\nmotion-artifact-free reconstruction of transient events with temporal\nresolution of 50 microseconds. To show $\\mu$FTP's broad utility, we use it to\nreconstruct 3D videos of 4 transient scenes: vibrating cantilevers, rotating\nfan blades, bullet fired from a toy gun, and balloon's explosion triggered by a\nflying dart, which were previously difficult or even unable to be captured with\nconventional approaches.\n", "  We report on fundamental aspects of spin dynamics in graphene interfaced with\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). By using realistic models derived\nfrom first principles we compute the spin lifetime anisotropy, defined as the\nratio of lifetimes for spins pointing out of the graphene plane to those\npointing in the plane. In the presence of strong intervalley scattering the\nanisotropy can reach unprecedented values of tens to hundreds, while it reduces\nto 1/2 for weak disorder. This behavior is mediated by spin-valley locking,\nwhich is strong in TMDCs and is imprinted onto graphene. Such giant spin\ntransport anisotropy, driven by proximity effects, provides an exciting\nparadigm for designing novel spin device functionalities.\n", "  A tetragonal photonic crystal composed of high-index pillars can exhibit a\nfrequency-isolated accidental degeneracy at a high-symmetry point in the first\nBrillouin zone. A photonic band gap can be formed there by introducing a\ngeometrical anisotropy in the pillars. In this gap, gapless surface/domain-wall\nstates emerge under a certain condition. We analyze their physical property in\nterms of an effective hamiltonian, and a good agreement between the effective\ntheory and numerical calculation is obtained.\n", "  Recently there is a flourishing and notable interest in the crystalline\nscintillator material sodium iodide (NaI) as target for direct dark matter\nsearches. This is mainly driven by the long-reigning contradicting situation in\nthe dark matter sector: the positive evidence for the detection of a dark\nmatter modulation signal claimed by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration is (under\nso-called standard assumptions) inconsistent with the null-results reported by\nmost of the other direct dark matter experiments. We present the results of a\nfirst prototype detector using a new experimental approach in comparison to\n\\textit{conventional} single-channel NaI scintillation light detectors: a NaI\ncrystal operated as a scintillating calorimeter at milli-Kelvin temperatures\nsimultaneously providing a phonon (heat) plus scintillation light signal and\nparticle discrimination on an event-by-event basis. We evaluate energy\nresolution, energy threshold and further performance parameters of this\nprototype detector developed within the COSINUS R&D project.\n", "  This paper deals with the viscous accretion flow of modified Chaplygin gas\ntowards a black hole as the central gravitating object. Modified Chaplygin gas\nis a particular type of dark energy model which mimics of radiation era to\nphantom era depending on the different values of its parameters. We compare the\ndrak energy accretion with the flow of adiabatic gas. An accretion disc flow\naround a black hole is an example of a transonic flow. To make the model, we\nconsider three components of Navier Stokes' equation, the equation of\ncontinuity and the modified Chaplygin gas's equation of state. As a transonic\nflow passes through the sonic point, the velocity gradient being apparently\nsingular there, gives rise to two flow branches : one infalling, the accretion\nand the other outgoing, the wind. We show that the wind curve is stronger and\nwind speed reaches to that of light at a finite distance from the black hole\nwhen dark energy is considered. Besides, if we increase the viscosity,\naccretion disc is being shortened. This two process acting together deviates\nmuch from adiabatic accretion case. It shows a weakening process for the\naccretion procedure by the works of viscous system influenced angular momentum\ntransport and the repulsive force of the modified Chaplygin gas together.\n", "  In this paper, we give a more pellucid derivation for the cascaded lattice\nBoltzmann method (CLBM) based on a general multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) frame\nthrough defining a shift matrix. When the shift matrix is a unit matrix, the\nCLBM degrades into an MRT LBM. Based on this, a consistent forcing scheme is\ndeveloped for the CLBM. The applicability of the non-slip rule, the\nsecond-order convergence rate in space and the property of isotropy for the\nconsistent forcing scheme is demonstrated through the simulation of several\ncanonical problems. Several other existing force schemes previously used in the\nCLBM are also examined. The study clarifies the relation between MRT LBM and\nCLBM under a general framework.\n", "  We consider measurements of exclusive rare semi-tauonic $b$-hadron decays,\nmediated by the $b \\rightarrow s \\tau^+ \\tau^-$ transition, at a future high\nenergy circular electron-positron collider (FCC-$ee$). We argue that the high\nboosts of $b$-hadrons originating from on-shell $Z$ boson decays allow for a\nfull reconstruction of the decay kinematics in hadronic $\\tau$ decay modes (up\nto discrete ambiguities). This, together with the potentially large statistics\nof $Z\\to b\\bar b$, opens the door for the experimental determination of $\\tau$\npolarizations in these rare $b$-hadron decays. In light of the current\nexperimental situation on lepton flavor universality in rare semileptonic $B$\ndecays, we discuss the complementary short-distance physics information carried\nby the $\\tau$ polarizations and suggest suitable theoretically clean\nobservables in the form of single- and double-$\\tau$ polarization asymmetries.\n", "  The exploitation of the excellent intrinsic electronic properties of graphene\nfor device applications is hampered by a large contact resistance between the\nmetal and graphene. The formation of edge contacts rather than top contacts is\none of the most promising solutions for realizing low ohmic contacts. In this\npaper the fabrication and characterization of edge contacts to large area\nCVD-grown monolayer graphene by means of optical lithography using CMOS\ncompatible metals, i.e. Nickel and Aluminum is reported. Extraction of the\ncontact resistance by Transfer Line Method (TLM) as well as the direct\nmeasurement using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy demonstrates a very low width\nspecific contact resistance.\n", "  The current-induced spin polarization and momentum-dependent spin-orbit field\nwere measured in In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As epilayers with varying indium\nconcentrations and silicon doping densities. Samples with higher indium\nconcentrations and carrier concentrations and lower mobilities were found to\nhave larger electrical spin generation efficiencies. Furthermore,\ncurrent-induced spin polarization was detected in GaAs epilayers despite the\nabsence of measurable spin-orbit fields, indicating that the extrinsic\ncontributions to the spin polarization mechanism must be considered.\nTheoretical calculations based on a model that includes extrinsic contributions\nto the spin dephasing and the spin Hall effect, in addition to the intrinsic\nRashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, are found to qualitatively agree\nwith the experimental results.\n", "  The dynamics of a gravitational wave propagating through a cosmic gauge field\nare dramatically different than in vacuum. We show that a gravitational wave\nacquires an effective mass, is birefringent, and its normal modes are a linear\ncombination of gravitational waves and gauge field excitations, leading to the\nphenomenon of gravitational wave -- gauge field oscillations. These surprising\nresults provide insight into gravitational phenomena and may suggest new\napproaches to a theory of quantum gravity.\n", "  Spatial and time scales of spin density fluctuations (SDF) were analyzed in\n3d ferromagnets using ab initio linear response calculations of complete\nwavevector and energy dependence of the dynamic spin susceptibility tensor. We\ndemonstrate that SDF are spread continuously over the entire Brillouin zone and\nwhile majority of them reside within the 3d bandwidth, a significant amount\ncomes from much higher energies. A validity of the adiabatic approximation in\nspin dynamics is discussed. The SDF spectrum is shown to have two main\nconstituents: a minor low-energy spin wave contribution and a much larger\nhigh-energy component from more localized excitations. Using the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), the on-site spin correlator (SC) and the\nrelated effective fluctuating moment were properly evaluated and their\nuniversal dependence on the 3d band population is further discussed.\n", "  Hao Wei et.al. has claimed in $\\mathrm{Phys. Lett. \\textbf{B707}, 298\n(2012)}$ that Noether symmetry in the context of teleparallel $f(T)$ theory of\ngravity admits $f(T)\\propto T^{n}$, (where $n$ is an arbitrary) in matter\ndomain era in Friedmann- Robertson universe. But, it has been shown that the\nconserved current obtained under the process does not satisfy the field\nequations in general. Here, it is shown that Noether Symmetry admits\n$f(T)\\propto T^\\frac{3}{2}$ along with a conserved current $ a \\dot a\nT^\\frac{1}{2}$ in teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity. Thus, their claim is not\ncorrect.\n", "  We study solutions for boson stars in the multi-scalar field theory with\nglobal symmetry $[U(1)]^N$. The properties of the boson stars are investigated\nby the Newtonian approximation with the large coupling limit. Our purpose is to\nstudy the models bringing about exotic mass distributions which explain flat\nrotation curves of galaxies. We propose plausible models in which coupling\nmatrices are associated with various graphs in graph theory.\n", "  The quantum fluctuations of the entropy production for fermionic systems in\nthe Landauer-Buttiker non-equilibrium steady state are investigated. The\nprobability distribution, governing these fluctuations, is explicitly derived\nby means of quantum field theory methods and analysed in the zero frequency\nlimit. It turns out that microscopic processes with positive, vanishing and\nnegative entropy production occur in the system with non-vanishing probability.\nIn spite of this fact, we show that all odd moments (in particular, the mean\nvalue of the entropy production) of the above distribution are non-negative.\nThis result extends the second principle of thermodynamics to the quantum\nfluctuations of the entropy production in the Landauer-Buttiker state. The\nimpact of the time reversal is also discussed.\n", "  Numerical simulations of beam-plasma instabilities may produce quantitatively\nincorrect results because of unrealistically high initial noise from which the\ninstabilities develop. Of particular importance is the wakefield noise, the\npotential perturbations that have a phase velocity which is equal to the beam\nvelocity. Controlling the noise level in simulations may offer the possibility\nof extrapolating simulation results to the more realistic low-noise case. We\npropose a novel method for generating wakefield noise with a controllable\namplitude by randomly located charged rods propagating ahead of the beam. We\nalso illustrate the method with particle-in-cell simulations. The generation of\nthis noise is not accompanied by parasitic Cherenkov radiation waves.\n", "  In the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-aether theory we study the\nbirefringence effect, which can occur in the pp-wave symmetric dynamic aether.\nThe dynamic aether is considered to be latently birefringent quasi-medium,\nwhich displays this hidden property if and only if the aether motion is\nnon-uniform, i.e., when the aether flow is characterized by the non-vanishing\nexpansion, shear, vorticity or acceleration. In accordance with the\ndynamo-optical scheme of description of the interaction between electromagnetic\nwaves and the dynamic aether, we shall model the susceptibility tensors by the\nterms linear in the covariant derivative of the aether velocity four-vector.\nWhen the pp-wave modes appear in the dynamic aether, we deal with a\ngravitationally induced degeneracy removal with respect to hidden\nsusceptibility parameters. As a consequence, the phase velocities of\nelectromagnetic waves possessing orthogonal polarizations do not coincide, thus\ndisplaying the birefringence effect. Two electromagnetic field configurations\nare studied in detail: longitudinal and transversal with respect to the aether\npp-wave front. For both cases the solutions are found, which reveal anomalies\nin the electromagnetic response on the action of the pp-wave aether mode.\n", "  Ensembles of interacting drops that slide down an inclined plate show a\ndramatically different coarsening behavior as compared to drops on a horizontal\nplate: As drops of different size slide at different velocities, frequent\ncollisions result in fast coalescence. However, above a certain size individual\nsliding drops are unstable and break up into smaller drops. Therefore, the\nlong-time dynamics of a large drop ensemble is governed by a balance of merging\nand splitting. We employ a long-wave film height evolution equation and\ndetermine the dynamics of the drop size distribution towards a stationary state\nfrom direct numerical simulations on large domains. The main features of the\ndistribution are then related to the bifurcation diagram of individual drops\nobtained by numerical path continuation. The gained knowledge allows us to\ndevelop a Smoluchowski-type statistical model for the ensemble dynamics that\nwell compares to full direct simulations.\n", "  We analyze scattering amplitudes with one soft external graviton and\narbitrary number of other finite energy external states carrying arbitrary mass\nand spin to sub-subleading order in the momentum of the soft graviton. Our\nresult can be expressed as the sum of a universal part that depends only on the\namplitude without the soft graviton and not the other details of the theory and\na non-universal part that depends on the amplitude without the soft graviton,\nand the two and three point functions of the theory. For tree amplitudes our\nresults are valid in all space-time dimensions while for loop amplitudes,\ninfrared divergences force us to restrict our analysis to space time dimensions\nfive or more. With this restriction the results are valid to all orders in\nperturbation theory. Our results agree with known results in quantum field\ntheories and string theory.\n", "  We study the isospin amplitudes in the exclusive $B$ to $D^*\\bar{D}K$ decay\nprocess and fit the available $D^{*0}\\bar{D}^0$ invariant mass distributions\nnear threshold. The analysis demonstrates that the production of the isospin\ntriplet $D^*\\bar{D}$ state is highly suppressed compared to the isospin singlet\none. That explains why the $Z_c(3900)$ has not been found in $B$ decays. In\naddition, the production of the negative charge-parity state might be further\nsuppressed in the heavy quark limit. These two reasons which are based on the\nmolecular assumption offer the first explanation why the $Z_c(3900)$ is absent\nin $B$ decays. Further studies of the absence from both the experimental and\nthe theoretical side is extremely important for understanding the nature of the\n$X(3872)$ and the $Z_c(3900)$.\n", "  We introduce three approaches to generate curvature invariants that transform\ncovariantly under a conformal transformation of a four dimensional spacetime.\nFor any black hole conformally related to a stationary black hole, we show how\na set of conformally covariant invariants can be combined to produce a\nconformally covariant invariant that detects the event horizon of the\nconformally related black hole. As an application we consider the rotating\ndynamical black holes conformally related to the Kerr-NUT-(Anti)-de Sitter\nspacetimes and construct an invariant that detects the conformal Killing\nhorizon along with a second invariant that detects the conformal stationary\nlimit surface.\n  In addition, we present necessary conditions for a dynamical black hole to be\nconformally related to a stationary black hole and apply these conditions to\nthe ingoing Kerr-Vaidya and Vaidya black hole solutions to determine if they\nare conformally related to stationary black holes for particular choices of the\nmass function. While two of the three approaches cannot be generalized to\nhigher dimensions, we discuss the existence of a conformally covariant\ninvariant that will detect the event horizon for any higher dimensional black\nhole conformally related to a stationary black hole which admits at least two\nconformally covariant invariants, including all vacuum spacetimes.\n", "  The minimal dominating Set (MDS) problem is a prototypical hard combinatorial\noptimization problem. Two years ago we studied this problem by cavity method.\nAlthough we get the solution of a given graph, which gives very good estimation\nof minimal dominating size, but we don't know whether we get the ground state\nsolution and how many solutions exist in the ground state. For this purpose,\nlast year we continue to develop the one step replica symmetry breaking (RSB)\ntheory to find the ground state energy of the MDS problem. Finally we find that\n1) The MDS problem solution space has both condensation transition and cluster\ntransition on regular Random (RR) graph and we prove this by simulated\nannealing dynamical process. 2) We developed zero temperature Survey\nPropagation (SP) algorithm on ER graph to estimate the ground state energy and\nto get Survey Propagation Decimation (SPD) algorithm with good results same as\nBPD algorithm.\n", "  Present nuclear detection techniques prevents us from determining if the\nanalogue of a Rydberg molecule exists for the nuclear case. But nothing in\nnature disallows their existence. As in the atomic case, Rydberg nuclear\nmolecules would be a laboratory for new aspects and applications of nuclear\nphysics. We propose that Rydberg nuclear molecules, which represent the exotic,\nhalo nuclei version, such as 11Be + 11Be, of the well known quasimolecules\nobserved in stable nuclei such as 12C + 12C, might be common structures that\ncould manifest their existence along the dripline. A study of possible\ncandidates and the expected structure of such exotic clustering of two halo\nnuclei: the Rydberg nuclear molecules, is made on the basis of three diferent\nmethods. It is shown that such cluster structures might be stable and\nunexpectedly common.\n", "  Event horizons are the defining feature of classical black holes. They are\nthe key ingredient of the information loss paradox which, as paradoxes in\nquantum foundations, is built on a combination of predictions of quantum theory\nand counterfactual classical features: neither horizon formation nor its\ncrossing by a test body is observable. Furthermore, horizons are unnecessary\nfor the production of Hawking-like radiation. We demonstrate that when this\nradiation is taken into account it prevents horizon crossing/formation in a\nlarge class of models. We conjecture that horizon avoidance is a general\nfeature of collapse. The non-existence of event horizons dispels the paradox,\nbut opens up important questions about thermodynamic properties of the\nresulting objects and correlations between different degrees of freedom.\n", "  We discuss the impact of finite particle losses associated with instrumental\neffects in measurements of moments of produced multiplicities with the Identity\nMethod towards the evaluation of fluctuation measures such as $\\nu_{dyn}$. We\nshow that the identity method remains applicable provided it is modified to\ndetermine factorial moments $\\langle N(N-1)\\rangle$, rather than moments\n$\\langle N^2\\rangle$. We further show that $\\nu_{dyn}$ remains robust if\ndetection efficiencies are uniform across the measurement's acceptance. The\nrobustness is lost, however, if detection efficiencies are momentum dependent,\nalthough the identity methods remains applicable provided detection\nefficiencies can be determined with sufficient accuracy.\n", "  Understanding the dynamics of positron cooling in gases, including the\nfraction of positrons surviving to thermalisation, is critical for accurate\ninterpretation of positron lifetime spectra, for the development of efficient\npositron cooling in traps and accumulators, and for a cryogenically cooled,\nultra-high-energy-resolution, trap-based positron beam. Here, positron cooling\nand annihilation in noble gases is simulated using accurate scattering and\nannihilation cross sections calculated \\emph{ab initio} with many-body theory.\nIt is shown that a strikingly small fraction of positrons survive to\nthermalisation: $\\sim$0.1 in He, $\\sim$0 in Ne (due to cooling effectively\nstalling in the relatively deep momentum-transfer cross-section minimum),\n$\\sim$0.15 in Ar, $\\sim$0.05 in Kr and $\\sim$0.01 in Xe. For Xe, the\ntime-varying annihilation rate $\\bar{Z}_{\\rm eff}(\\tau)$ is shown to be highly\nsensitive to the depletion of the distribution due to annihilation,\nconclusively explaining the long-standing discrepancy between gas-cell and\ntrap-based measurements in Xe. The \\emph{ab initio} calculations enable the\nfirst simultaneous probing of the energy dependence of the the scattering cross\nsection and annihilation rate. Overall, the use of the accurate atomic data\ngives $\\bar{Z}_{\\rm eff}(\\tau)$ in close agreement with experiment for all\nnoble gases except Ne, the experiment for which is proffered to have suffered\nfrom incomplete knowledge of the fraction of positrons surviving to\nthermalisation and/or the presence of impurities.\n", "  One of the challenges for fermionic cold atom experiments in optical lattices\nis to cool the systems to low enough temperature that they can form quantum\ndegenerate ordered phases. In particular, there has been significant work in\ntrying to find the antiferromagnetic phase transition of the Hubbard model in\nthree dimensions, without success. Here, we attack this problem from a\ndifferent angle by enhancing the ordering temperature via an increase in the\ndegeneracy of the atomic species trapped in the optical lattice. In addition to\ndeveloping the general theory, we also discuss some potential systems where one\nmight be able to achieve these results experimentally.\n", "  We show the existence of Fano resonances in the context of near-field\nradiative heat transfer, which enable the strong suppression and enhancement of\nthe spectral heat flux at specific wavelengths. This is demonstrated by making\nuse of the plasmon-phonon coupling in a symmetric nano cavity composed by a\npolaritonic material coated with a metallic layer, in which each side of the\ncavity is kept at different temperatures. The strong hybridization of the\nplasmonic and phononic modes sustained by the multilayer structure is\ndetermined by the matching of their polarization. This leads to the opening of\na thermal band gap, where heat transfer in the coupled system is inhibited for\nall wave vectors and for wavelengths at which the individual constituents are\nthermally transmissive.\n", "  Caustics are natural phenomena in which nature concentrates the energy of\nwaves. Although, they are known mostly in optics, caustics are intrinsic to all\nwave phenomena. For example, studies show that fluctuations in the profile of\nan ocean floor can generate random caustics and focus the energy of tsunami\nwaves. Caustics share many similarities to rogue waves, as they both exhibit\nheavy-tailed distribution, i.e. an overpopulation of large events. Linear\nSchr\\\"odinger-type equations are usually used to explain the wave dynamics of\ncaustics. However, in that the wave amplitude increases dramatically in\ncaustics, nonlinearity is inevitable in many systems. In this Letter, we\ninvestigate the effect of nonlinearity on the formation of optical caustics. We\nshow experimentally that, in contrast to linear systems, even small phase\nfluctuations can generate strong caustics upon nonlinear propagation. We\nsimulated our experiment based on the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE)\nwith Kerr-type nonlinearity, which describes the wave dynamics not only in\noptics, but also in some other physical systems such as oceans. Therefore, our\nresults may also aid our understanding of ocean phenomena.\n", "  Silicene, a 2D analogue of graphene, has spurred a tremendous research\ninterest in the scientific community for its unique properties essential for\nnext generation electronic devices. In this work, for the first time, we\npresent a molecular dynamics (MD) investigation to determine the fracture\nstrength and toughness of nanocrystalline silicene (nc silicene) sheet of\nvaried grain size and pre existing crack length at room temperature. Our\nresults suggest that the transition from an inverse pseudo Hall Petch to a\npseudo Hall Petch behavior in nc silicene occurs at a critical grain size of\n17.32 nm. This phenomenon is also prevalent in nanocrystalline graphene.\nHowever, nc silicene with pre existing cracks exhibits anomalous crack\npropagation and fracture toughness behaviour. We have observed two distinct\ntypes of failure mechanisms (crack sensitive and insensitive failure) and\ndevised the mechanophysical conditions under which they occur. Fracture\ntoughness calculated from both Griffiths theory and MD simulations indicate\nthat the former overpredicts the fracture toughness of nc silicene. The most\nstriking outcome, however, is that despite the presence of a pre existing\ncrack, the crack sensitivity of nc silicene is found to be dependent on the\ngrain size and their orientations. This study is the first direct comparison of\natomistic simulations to the continuum theories to predict the anomalous\nbehaviour in deformation and failure mechanisms of nc silicene.\n", "  In this work, we present structural, electronic, magnetic, mechanical and\ntransport properties of equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy, CoRhMnGe using\nboth theoretical and experimental techniques. A detailed structural analysis is\nperformed using X-ray diffraction(XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine\nstructure(EXAFS) spectroscopy. The alloy is found to crystallize in Y-type\nstructure having space group $F\\bar{4}3m$ (\\# 216). The ab-initio simulation\npedict half-metallic ferromagnetic characteristics leading to large spin\npolarization. The calculated magnetization is found to be in fair agreement\nwith experiment as well as those predicted by the Slater-Pauling rule, which is\na prerequisite for half-metallicity. The magnetic transition\ntemperature($\\mathrm{T_{C}}$) is found to be $\\sim 760$ K. Measured electrical\nresistivity in the temperature range 2-400 K also gives an indication of\nhalf-metallic behavior. Simulated resistivity matches fairly well with those\nmeasured, with the temperature dependant carrier relaxation time lying in the\nrange $1-2$ fs. Effect of hydrostatic pressure on electronic structure,\nmagnetic and mechanical properties are investigated in detail. The alloy is\nfound to preserve half-metallic characteristics upto 30.27 GPa beyond which it\ntransit to metallic phase. No magnetic phase transition is found to occur in\nthe whole range of pressure. The system also satisfies the Born-Huang criteria\nfor mechanical stability upto a limited range of pressure. All these properties\nmake CoRhMnGe alloy promising for spintronics devices.\n", "  We derive the decay rate of a gauged Q-ball into fermions, applying the\nleading semi-classical approximation. We find that more particles come out from\nthe surface of a gauged Q-ball, compared to the case of a global Q-ball, due to\nthe electric repulsion. We show that, however, the decay rate of a gauged\nQ-ball is bounded from above due to the Pauli blocking at the surface of the\nQ-ball, just as in the case of a global Q-ball. We also find that there is a\nfurther suppression due to the Coulomb potential outside the Q-ball, which we\nfind to play the role of a potential barrier for the fermions coming from the\ninside the Q-ball.\n", "  We introduce a concept of hidden ladders for the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper\ntype compounds: While the crystal structure is bilayer, $d_{xz}$ ($d_{yz}$)\norbitals in the relevant $t_{2g}$ sector of the transition metal form a two-leg\nladder along $x$ ($y$), since the $d_{xz}$ ($d_{yz}$) electrons primarily hop\nalong the leg direction $x$ ($y$) on top of the rung $z$ direction. We predict\nthat Sr$_3$Mo$_2$O$_7$ and Sr$_3$Cr$_2$O$_7$ are candidates for the\nhidden-ladder material with a right position of $E_F$, from a first-principles\nband calculation. Based on the analysis of Eliashberg equation for these\nsystems, we propose a possible occurrence of high temperature superconductivity\nin these materials arising from the interband pair scattering processes between\nthe wide and \"incipient\" narrow bands on the ladder.\n", "  The $Z$ boson in the process $pp \\to ZH$ and the $W^+_{}$ and $W^-_{}$ in the\nprocess $pp \\to W^{\\pm}_{}H$ can be in polarised states. The polarisation\ndensity matrix of the $Z$ ($W$) boson contains the complete information about a\nstate of polarisation of the $Z$ ($W$) boson, and $HZZ$, $HZ\\gamma$ and $HWW$\ninteractions may be studied in detail from a careful analysis of these\nmatrices. In this paper, a systematic approach to analyse these polarisation\ndensity matrices is presented. With the aim of making maximum use of the\npolarisation information, all of the elements of the polarisation density\nmatrices are related with observables, which are measurable at the environment\nof $pp$ collisions. Consequences of non-standard $HZZ$, $HZ\\gamma$ and $HWW$\ninteractions for these observables are discussed.\n", "  The quantum theory of coherent Ising machines, based on degenerate optical\nparametric oscillators and measurement-feedback circuits, is developed using\nthe positive $P({\\alpha},{\\beta})$ representation of the density operator and\nthe master equation. The theory is composed of the c-number stochastic\ndifferential equations for describing open dissipative quantum dynamics and the\nreplicator dynamics equations for handling measurement-induced collapse of the\ndensity operator. We apply the present theory to simulate two simple Ising spin\nmodels and elucidate the unique features of this computing machine.\n", "  In the present study we analytically investigate the deformation and bulk\nrheology of a dilute emulsion of surfactant-laden droplets suspended in a\nlinear flow. We use an asymptotic approach to predict the effect of surfactant\ndistribution on the deformation of a single droplet as well as the effective\nshear and extensional viscosity for the dilute emulsion. The non-uniform\ndistribution of surfactants due to the bulk flow results in the generation of a\nMarangoni stress which affects both the deformation as well as the bulk\nrheology of the suspension. The present analysis is done for the limiting case\nwhen the surfactant transport is dominated by the surface diffusion relative to\nsurface convection. As an example, we have used two commonly encountered bulk\nflows, namely, uniaxial extensional flow and simple shear flow. With the\nassumption of negligible inertial forces present in either of the phases, we\nare able to show that both the surfactant concentration on the droplet surface\nas well as the ratio of viscosity of the droplet phase with respect to the\nsuspending fluid has a significant effect on the droplet deformation as well as\nthe bulk rheology. It is seen that increase in the non-uniformity in surfactant\ndistribution on the droplet surface results in a higher droplet deformation and\na higher effective viscosity for either of linear flows considered. For the\ncase of simple shear flow, surfactant distribution is found to have no effect\non the inclination angle, however, a higher viscosity ratio predicts the\ndroplet to be more aligned towards the direction of flow.\n", "  In this paper, considering the linearized Einstein equation with a\ntwo-parameter family of linear covariant gauges in de Sitter spacetime, we\nexamine possible vacuum states for the gravitons field with respect to\ninvariance under the de Sitter group $SO_0(1,4)$. Our calculations explicitly\nreveal that there exists no natural de Sitter-invariant vacuum state (the\nEuclidean state) for the gravitons field. Indeed, on the foundation of a\nrigorous group theoretical reasoning, we prove that if one insists on full\ncovariance as well as causality for the theory, has to give up the positivity\nrequirement of the inner product. However, one may still look for states with\nas much symmetry as possible, more precisely, a restrictive version of\ncovariance by considering the gravitons field and the associated vacuum state\nwhich are, respectively, covariant and invariant with respect to some maximal\nsubgroup of the full de Sitter group. In this regard, we treat $SO(4)$ case,\nand find a family of $SO(4)$-invariant states. The associated $SO(4)$-covariant\nquantum field is given, as well.\n", "  A few years ago the use of standard functional manipulations was demonstrated\nto imply an unexpected property satisfied by the fermionic Green's functions of\nQCD: effective locality. This feature of QCD is non-perturbative as it results\nfrom a full integration of the gluonic degrees of freedom. In this paper,\nprevious derivations of effective locality are reviewed, corrected, and\nenhanced. Focussing on the way non-abelian gauge invariance is realized in the\nnon-perturbative regime of QCD, the deeper meaning of effective locality is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Motivated by understanding the background to Chiral Magnetic Effect in\nproton-nucleus collisions from first principles, we compute the three particle\ncorrelation in the projectile wave function. We extract the correlations\nbetween two quarks and one gluon in the framework of the Color Glass\nCondensate. This is related to the same-charge correlation of the conventional\nobservable for the Chiral Magnetic Effect. We show that there are two different\ncontributions to this correlation function. One contribution is\nrapidity-independent and as such can be identified with the pedestal; while the\nother displays rather strong rapidity dependence. The pedestal contribution and\nthe rapidity-dependent contribution at large rapidity separation between the\ntwo quarks result in the negative same charge correlations, while at small\nrapidity separation the second contribution changes sign. We argue that the\ncomputed initial state correlations might be partially responsible for the\nexperimentally observed signal in proton-nucleus collisions.\n", "  In this paper we work out in detail a new proposal to define rigorously a\nsector of loop quantum gravity at the diffeomorphism invariant level\ncorresponding to homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies, and propose how to\ncompare in detail the physics of this sector with that of loop quantum\ncosmology. The key technical steps we have completed are (a) to formulate\nconditions for homogeneity and isotropy in a diffeomorphism covariant way on\nthe classical phase space of general relativity, and (b) to translate these\nconditions consistently using well-understood techniques to loop quantum\ngravity. To impose the symmetry at the quantum level, on both the connection\nand its conjugate momentum, the method used necessarily has similiarities to\nthe Gupta-Bleuler method of quantizing the electromagnetic field. Lastly, a\nstrategy for embedding states of loop quantum cosmology into this new\nhomogeneous isotropic sector, and using this embedding to compare the physics,\nis presented.\n", "  We propose a scheme to generate carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) stabilized\nfew-cycle optical pulses from a free-electron laser oscillator. The CEP\nstabilization is realized by continuous injection of CEP-stabilized seed pulses\nfrom an external laser to the FEL oscillator whose cavity length is perfectly\nsynchronized to the electron bunch repetition. Such CEP-stabilized few-cycle\nFEL pulses will be an efficient driver for exploring high-harmonic generation\nat energies 1-10~keV for attosecond and zeptosecond science, broad-band x-ray\noptical frequency combs and coherent control of chemical reaction.\n", "  Recently, the coherent Ising machine (CIM) as a degenerate optical parametric\noscillator (DOPO) network has been researched to solve Ising combinatorial\noptimization problems. We formulate a theoretical model for the CIM with\ndiscrete-time measurement feedback processes, and perform numerical simulations\nfor the simplest network, composed of two degenerate optical parametric\noscillator pulses with the anti-ferromagnetic mutual coupling. We evaluate the\nextent to which quantum coherence exists during the optimization process.\n", "  We consider turbulence driven by a large-scale horizontal shear in Kolmogorov\nflow (i.e. with sinusoidal body forcing) and a background linear stable\nstratification with buoyancy frequency $N_B^2$ imposed in the third, vertical\ndirection in a fluid with kinematic viscosity $\\nu$. This flow is known to be\norganised into layers by nonlinear unstable steady states, which incline the\nbackground shear in the vertical and can be demonstrated to be the\nfinite-amplitude saturation of a sequence of instabilities, originally from the\nlaminar state. Here, we investigate the next order of motions in this system,\ni.e. the time-dependent mechanisms by which the density field is irreversibly\nmixed. This investigation is achieved using 'recurrent flow analysis'. We\nidentify (unstable) periodic orbits, which are embedded in the turbulent\nattractor, and use these orbits as proxies for the chaotic flow. We find that\nthe time average of an appropriate measure of the 'mixing efficiency' of the\nflow $\\mathscr{E}= \\chi/(\\chi+\\mathcal{D})$ ($\\mathcal{D}$ is the\nvolume-averaged kinetic energy dissipation rate and $\\chi$ is the\nvolume-averaged density variance dissipation rate) varies non-monotonically\nwith the time-averaged buoyancy Reynolds numbers $\\overline{Re}_B=\n\\overline{\\mathcal{D}}/(\\nu N_B^2)$, and is bounded above by $1/6$,\nconsistently with the classical model of Osborn (1980). There are qualitatively\ndifferent physical properties between the unstable orbits that have lower\nirreversible mixing efficiency at low $\\overline{Re}_B \\sim O(1)$ and those\nwith nearly optimal $\\mathscr{E} \\lesssim 1/6$ at intermediate $\\overline{Re}_B\n\\sim 10$. The weaker orbits, inevitably embedded in more strongly stratified\nflow, are characterised by straining or 'scouring' motions, while the more\nefficient orbits have clear overturning dynamics in more weakly stratified, and\napparently shear-unstable flow.\n", "  We reformulate an earlier model of the \"Emergence of classes...\" proposed by\nAxtell etal. using more elaborate cognitive processes allowing a statistical\nphysics approach. The thorough analysis of the phase space and of the basins of\nattraction leads to a reconsideration of the previous social interpretations:\nour model predicts the reinforcement of discrimination biases and their long\nterm stability rather than the emergence of classes.\n", "  We clarify three aspects of non-compact elliptic genera. Firstly, we give a\npath integral derivation of the elliptic genus of the cigar conformal field\ntheory from its non-linear sigma-model description. The result is a manifestly\nmodular sum over a lattice. Secondly, we discuss supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics with a continuous spectrum. We regulate the theory and analyze the\ndependence on the temperature of the trace weighted by the fermion number. The\ndependence is dictated by the regulator. From a detailed analysis of the\ndependence on the infrared boundary conditions, we argue that in non-compact\nelliptic genera right-moving supersymmetry combined with modular covariance is\nanomalous. Thirdly, we further clarify the relation between the flat space\nelliptic genus and the infinite level limit of the cigar elliptic genus.\n", "  In recent years, multiple studies have reported substantial populations of\nlarge, low-surface-brightness galaxies in local galaxy clusters. Various\ntheories that aim to explain the presence of such ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs)\nhave since been proposed. A key question that will help to differentiate\nbetween models is whether UDGs have counterparts in lower-mass host haloes, and\nwhat their abundance as a function of halo mass is. In this study we extend our\nprevious study of UDGs in galaxy clusters to galaxy groups. We measure the\nabundance of UDGs in 325 spectroscopically-selected groups from the Galaxy And\nMass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We make use of the overlapping imaging from the\nESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), from which we can identify galaxies with mean\nsurface brightnesses within their effective radii down to ~25.5 mag\narcsec$^{-2}$ in the r-band. We are able to measure a significant overdensity\nof UDGs (with sizes r_eff > 1.5 kpc) in galaxy groups down to M200=10^12 Msun,\na regime where approximately only 1 in 10 groups contains a UDG that we can\ndetect. We combine measurements of the abundance of UDGs in haloes that cover\nthree orders of magnitude in halo mass, finding that their numbers scale quite\nsteeply with halo mass; N_UDG (R<R200) $\\propto$ M200^(1.11+/-0.07). To better\ninterpret this, we also measure the mass-richness relation for brighter\ngalaxies down to $M^*_r$+2.5 in the same GAMA groups, and find a much shallower\nrelation of N_Bright (R<R200) $\\propto$ M200^(0.78+/-0.05). This shows that\nUDGs are relatively more abundant, compared to bright galaxies, in massive\nclusters than in groups. We discuss implications, but whether this difference\nis related to a higher destruction rate of UDGs in groups, or whether massive\nhaloes have a positive effect on their formation, is not yet clear.\n", "  A pump source is one of the essential prerequisites in order to achieve\nlasing, and, in most cases, a stronger pump leads to higher laser power at the\noutput. However, this behavior may be suppressed if two pump beams are used. In\nthis work, it is shown that lasing around the 1600 nm band can be suppressed\ncompletely if two pumps, at wavelengths of 980 nm and 1550 nm, are applied\nsimultaneously to a Yb:Er-doped microlaser, whereas it can be revived by\nswitching one of them off. This phenomenon can be explained by assuming that\nthe existence of one pump (980 nm) changes the role of the other pump (1550\nnm); more specifically, the 1550 nm pump starts to consume the population\ninversion instead of increasing it when the 980 nm pump power exceeds a certain\nvalue. As a result, the two pump fields lead to a closed-loop transition within\nthe gain medium (i.e., erbium ions). This study unveils an interplay similar\nwith coherence effects between different pump pathways, which provides a\nreference for designing the laser pump and may have applications in lasing\ncontrol.\n", "  Single-molecule electronics has been envisioned as the ultimate goal in the\nminiaturisation of electronic circuits. While the aim of incorporating\nsingle-molecule junctions into modern technology still proves elusive, recent\ndevelopments in this field have begun to enable experimental investigation\nfundamental concepts within the area of chemical physics. One such phenomenon\nis the concept of Environment-Assisted Quantum Transport which has emerged from\nthe investigation of exciton transport in photosynthetic complexes. Here, we\nstudy charge transport through a two-site molecular junction coupled to a\nvibrational environment. We demonstrate that vibrational interactions can also\nsignificantly enhance the current through specific molecular orbitals. Our\nstudy offers a clear pathway towards finding and identifying\nenvironment-assisted transport phenomena in charge transport settings.\n", "  The Kolmogrov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) growth model is considered on a\none-dimensional (1D) lattice. Cells can growth with constant speed and\ncontinuously nucleate on the empty sites. We offer an alternative, mean-field\nlike approach for describing theoretically the dynamics and derive an\nanalytical cell-size distribution function. Our method reproduces the same\nscaling laws as the KJMA theory and has the advantage that it leads to a simple\nclosed form for the cell-size distribution function. It is shown that a Weibull\ndistribution is appropriate for describing the final cell-size distribution.\nThe results are discussed in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation data.\n", "  We present {\\it block analysis}, an efficient method to perform finite-size\nscaling for obtaining the length scale of dynamic heterogeneity and the\npoint-to-set length scale for generic glass-forming liquids. This method\ninvolves considering blocks of varying sizes embedded in a system of a fixed\n(large) size. The length scale associated with dynamic heterogeneity is\nobtained from a finite-size scaling analysis of the dependence of the\nfour-point dynamic susceptibility on the block size. The block size dependence\nof the variance of the $\\alpha$-relaxation time yields the static point-to-set\nlength scale. The values of the obtained length scales agree quantitatively\nwith those obtained from other conventional methods. This method provides an\nefficient experimental tool for studying the growth of length scales in systems\nsuch as colloidal glasses for which performing finite-size scaling by carrying\nout experiments for varying system sizes may not be feasible.\n", "  After more than forty years since the basic standard model for supernovae Ia\nwas proposed many astronomers are still hopeful that this phenomenon will\nultimately be understood in terms of Newtonian gravity plus nuclear and\nparticle physics as they existed in the 1930's. In spite of this fact there are\nat least six nagging puzzles in supernova physics that suggest some radical new\nphysics input may be necessary. \"Radical\" in this context means a physics idea\nthat did not exist in the 1930's and that is still not experimentally confirmed\nin 2017.\n", "  A search for pair production of massive vector-like T and B quarks in\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV is presented. The data set was\ncollected in 2015 by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an\nintegrated luminosity of up to 2.6 inverse femtobarns. The T and B quarks are\nassumed to decay through three possible channels into a heavy boson (either a\nW, Z or Higgs boson) and a third generation quark. This search is performed in\nfinal states with one charged lepton and several jets, exploiting techniques to\nidentify W or Higgs bosons decaying hadronically with large transverse momenta.\nNo excess over the predicted standard model background is observed. Upper\nlimits at 95% confidence level on the T quark pair production cross section are\nset that exclude T quark masses below 860 GeV in the singlet, and below 830 GeV\nin the doublet branching fraction scenario. For other branching fraction\ncombinations with B(tH) + B(bW) >= 0.4, lower limits on the T quark range from\n790 to 940 GeV. Limits are also set on pair production of singlet vector-like B\nquarks, which can be excluded up to a mass of 730 GeV. These limits are among\nthe most stringent to date for vector-like T quarks. The techniques showcased\nhere for understanding highly-boosted final states are important as the\nsensitivity to new particles is extended to higher masses.\n", "  The associated production of Higgs boson with a hard photon at lepton\ncollider, i.e., $e^+e^-\\to H\\gamma$, is known to bear a rather small cross\nsection in Standard Model, and can serve as a sensitive probe for the potential\nnew physics signals. Similar to the loop-induced Higgs decay channels $H\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma, Z\\gamma$, the $e^+e^-\\to H\\gamma$ process also starts at one-loop\norder provided that the tiny electron mass is neglected. In this work, we\ncalculate the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to this associated\n$H+\\gamma$ production process, which mainly stem from the gluonic dressing to\nthe top quark loop. The QCD corrections are found to be rather modest at lower\ncenter-of-mass energy range ($\\sqrt{s}<300$ GeV), thus of negligible impact on\nHiggs factory such as CEPC. Nevertheless, when the energy is boosted to the ILC\nenergy range ($\\sqrt{s}\\approx 400$ GeV), QCD corrections may enhance the\nleading-order cross section by $20\\%$. In any event, the $e^+e^-\\to H\\gamma$\nprocess has a maximal production rate $\\sigma_{\\rm max}\\approx 0.08$ fb around\n$\\sqrt{s}= 250$ GeV, thus CEPC turns out to be the best place to look for this\nrare Higgs production process. In the high energy limit, the effect of NLO QCD\ncorrections become completely negligible, which can be simply attributed to the\ndifferent asymptotic scaling behaviors of the LO and NLO cross sections, where\nthe former exhibits a milder decrement $\\propto 1/s$ , but the latter undergoes\na much faster decrease $\\propto 1/s^2$.\n", "  A search is conducted for new physics in a final state containing a photon\nand missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13\nTeV. The data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 12.9 inverse femtobarns. No deviations are observed\nrelative to the predictions of the standard model. The results are interpreted\nas exclusion limits on the dark matter production cross sections and parameters\nin models containing extra spatial dimensions. Improved limits are set with\nrespect to previous searches using the monophoton final state. In particular,\nthe limits on the extra dimension model parameters are the most stringent to\ndate in this channel.\n", "  We investigate the properties of a two-state sandpile model subjected to a\nconfining potential in two dimensions. From the microdynamical description, we\nderive a diffusion equation, and find a stationary solution for the case of a\nparabolic confining potential. By studying the systems at different confining\nconditions, we observe two scale-invariant regimes. At a given confining\npotential strength, the cluster size distribution takes the form of a power\nlaw. This regime corresponds to the situation in which the density at the\ncenter of the system approaches the critical percolation threshold. The\nanalysis of the fractal dimension of the largest cluster frontier provides\nevidence that this regime is reminiscent of gradient percolation. By increasing\nfurther the confining potential, most of the particles coalesce in a giant\ncluster, and we observe a regime where the jump size distribution takes the\nform of a power law. The onset of this second regime is signaled by a maximum\nin the fluctuation of energy.\n", "  In this paper we consider the problem of avoided crossings (level repulsion)\nin phononic crystals and suggest a computationally efficient strategy to\ndistinguish them from normal cross points. This process is essential for the\ncorrect sorting of the phononic bands and, subsequently, for the accurate\ndetermination of mode continuation, group velocities, and emergent properties\nwhich depend on them such as thermal conductivity. Through explicit phononic\ncalculations using generalized Rayleigh quotient, we identify exact locations\nof exceptional points in the complex wavenumber domain which results in level\nrepulsion in the real domain. We show that in the vicinity of the exceptional\npoint the relevant phononic eigenvalue surfaces resemble the surfaces of a 2 by\n2 parameter-dependent matrix. Along a closed loop encircling the exceptional\npoint we show that the phononic eigenvalues are exchanged, just as they are for\nthe 2 by 2 matrix case. However, the behavior of the associated eigenvectors is\nshown to be more complex in the phononic case. Along a closed loop around an\nexceptional point, we show that the eigenvectors can flip signs multiple times\nunlike a 2 by 2 matrix where the flip of sign occurs only once. Finally, we\nexploit these eigenvector sign flips around exceptional points to propose a\nsimple and efficient method of distinguishing them from normal crosses and of\ncorrectly sorting the band-structure. Our proposed method is roughly an\norder-of magnitude faster than the zoom-in method and correctly identifies >\n97% of the cases considered. Both its speed and accuracy can be further\nimproved and we suggest some ways of achieving this. Our method is general and,\nas such, would be directly applicable to other eigenvalue problems where the\neigenspectrum needs to be correctly sorted.\n", "  Microbial flagellates typically inhabit complex suspensions of polymeric\nmaterial which can impact the swimming speed of motile microbes, filter-feeding\nof sessile cells, and the generation of biofilms. There is currently a need to\nbetter understand how the fundamental dynamics of polymers near active cells or\nflagella impacts these various phenomena, in particular the hydrodynamic and\nsteric influence of a rotating helical filament on suspended polymers. Our\nStokesian dynamics simulations show that as a stationary rotating helix pumps\nfluid along its long axis, polymers migrate radially inwards while being\nelongated. We observe that the actuation of the helix tends to increase the\nprobability of finding polymeric material within its pervaded volume. This\naccumulation of polymers within the vicinity of the helix is stronger for\nlonger polymers. We further analyse the stochastic work performed by the helix\non the polymers and show that this quantity is positive on average and\nincreases with polymer contour length.\n", "  Based on fully relativistic first-principles calculations, we studied the\ntopological properties of layered XIn$_2$P$_2$ (X = Ca, Sr). Band inversion can\nbe induced by strain without SOC, forming one nodal ring in the k$_z$ = 0\nplane, which is protected by the coexistence of time-reversal and\nmirror-reflection symmetry. Including SOC, a substantial band gap is opened\nalong the nodal line and the line-node semimetal would evolve into a\ntopological insulator. These results reveal a category of materials showing\nquantum phase transition from trivial semiconductor and topologically\nnontrivial insulator by the tuneable elastic strain engineering. Our\ninvestigations provide a new perspective about the formation of topological\nline-node semimetal under stain.\n", "  We explore the possibility that inflation is driven by supersymmetry breaking\nwith the superpartner of the goldstino (sgoldstino) playing the role of the\ninflaton. Moreover, we impose an R-symmetry that allows to satisfy easily the\nslow-roll conditions, avoiding the so-called $\\eta$-problem, and leads to two\ndifferent classes of small field inflation models; they are characterised by an\ninflationary plateau around the maximum of the scalar potential, where\nR-symmetry is either restored or spontaneously broken, with the inflaton\nrolling down to a minimum describing the present phase of our Universe. To\navoid the Goldstone boson and remain with a single (real) scalar field (the\ninflaton), R-symmetry is gauged with the corresponding gauge boson becoming\nmassive. This framework generalises a model studied recently by the present\nauthors, with the inflaton identified by the string dilaton and R-symmetry\ntogether with supersymmetry restored at weak coupling, at infinity of the\ndilaton potential. The presence of the D-term allows a tuning of the vacuum\nenergy at the minimum. The proposed models agree with cosmological observations\nand predict a tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial perturbations\n$10^{-9}\\lesssim r\\lesssim 10^{-4}$ and an inflation scale $10^{10}$ GeV\n$\\lesssim H_*\\lesssim 10^{12}$ GeV. $H_*$ may be lowered up to electroweak\nenergies only at the expense of fine-tuning the scalar potential.\n", "  We discuss how flavour GUT models in the context of supergravity can be\ncompleted with a simple SUSY breaking sector, such that the flavour-dependent\n(non-universal) soft breaking terms can be calculated. As an example, we\ndiscuss a model based on an SU(5) GUT symmetry and $A_4$ family symmetry, plus\nadditional discrete \"shaping symmetries\" and a $\\mathbb{Z}_4^\\mathrm{R}$\nsymmetry. We calculate the soft terms and identify the relevant high scale\ninput parameters, and investigate the resulting predictions for the low scale\nobservables, such as flavour violating processes, the sparticle spectrum and\nthe dark matter relic density.\n", "  We study the U(1) quantum spin liquid on the pyrochlore spin ice systems. For\nthe non-Kramers doublets such as Pr$^{3+}$ and Tb$^{3+}$, we point out that the\ninelastic neutron scattering not only detects the low-energy gauge photon, but\nalso contains the continuum of the \"magnetic monopole\" excitations. Unlike the\nspinons, these \"magnetic monopoles\" are purely of quantum origin and have no\nclassical analogue. We further point out that the \"magnetic monopole\"\nexperiences a background dual \"$\\pi$\" flux due to the spin-1/2 nature of the\nlocal moment when the \"monopole\" hops on the dual diamond lattice. We then\npredict that the \"monopole\" continuum has an enhanced spectral periodicity.\nThis prediction can be examined among the existing data on the non-Kramers\ndoublet spin liquid candidate materials like Pr$_2$TM$_2$O$_7$ and\nTb$_2$TM$_2$O$_7$ (with TM = \"transition metal\"). The application to the\nKramers doublet systems and numerical simulation is further discussed. Finally,\nwe present a general classification of distinct symmetry enriched U(1) quantum\nspin liquids based on the translation symmetry fractionalization patterns of\n\"monopoles\" and \"spinons\".\n", "  The dynamics of deformations of a quantum vortex ring in a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate with periodic equilibrium density $\\rho(z)= 1-\\epsilon\\cos z$ has\nbeen considered within the local induction approximation. Parametric\ninstabilities of the normal modes with azimuthal numbers $\\pm m$ have been\nrevealed at the energy integral $E$ near values $E_m^{(p)}=2m\\sqrt{m^2-1}/p$,\nwhere $p$ is the resonance order. Numerical simulations have shown that already\nat $\\epsilon\\sim 0.03$ a rapid growth of unstable modes with $m=2$, $p=1$ to\nmagnitudes of order of unity is typical, which is then followed, after a few\nlarge oscillations, by fast return to a weakly excited state. Such behavior\ncorresponds to an integrable Hamiltonian of the form $H\\propto\n\\sigma(E_2^{(1)}-E)(|b_+|^2 + |b_-|^2) -\\epsilon(b_+ b_- + b_+^* b_-^*)\n+u(|b_+|^4 +|b_-|^4) + w |b_+|^2|b_-|^2$ for two complex envelopes $b_\\pm(t)$.\nThe results have been compared to parametric instabilities of vortex ring in\ncondensate with density $\\rho(z,r)=1-r^2-\\alpha z^2$, which take place at\n$\\alpha\\approx 8/5$ and at $\\alpha\\approx 16/7$.\n", "  The hydrodynamics and rheology of a sheared dilute gas-solid suspension,\nconsisting of inelastic hard-spheres suspended in a gas, are analysed using\nanisotropic Maxwellian as the single particle distribution function. The\nclosed-form solutions for granular temperature and three invariants of the\nsecond-moment tensor are obtained as functions of the Stokes number ($St$), the\nmean density ($\\nu$) and the restitution coefficient ($e$). Multiple states of\nhigh and low temperatures are found when the Stokes number is small, thus\nrecovering the \"ignited\" and \"quenched\" states, respectively, of Tsao \\& Koch\n(J. Fluid Mech.,1995). The phase diagram is constructed in the\nthree-dimensional ($\\nu, St, e$)-space that delineates the regions of ignited\nand quenched states and their coexistence. Analytical expressions for the\nparticle-phase shear viscosity and the normal stress differences are obtained,\nalong with related scaling relations on the quenched and ignited states. At any\n$e$, the shear-viscosity undergoes a discontinuous jump with increasing shear\nrate (i.e.~ discontinuous shear-thickening) at the \"quenched-ignited\"\ntransition. The first (${\\mathcal N}_1$) and second (${\\mathcal N}_2$)\nnormal-stress differences also undergo similar first-order transitions: (i)\n${\\mathcal N}_1$ jumps from large to small positive values and (ii) ${\\mathcal\nN}_2$ from positive to negative values with increasing $St$, with the\nsign-change of ${\\mathcal N}_2$ identified with the system making a transition\nfrom the quenched to ignited states. The superior prediction of the present\ntheory over the standard Grad's method and the Chapman-Enskog solution is\ndemonstrated via comparisons of transport coefficients with simulation data for\na range of Stokes number and restitution coefficient.\n", "  False vacuum states are metastable in quantum field theories, and true vacuum\nbubbles can be nucleated due to the quantum tunneling effect. It was recently\nsuggested that an evaporating black hole (BH) can be a catalyst of bubble\nnucleations and dramatically shortens the lifetime of the false vacuum. In\nparticular, in the context of the Standard Model valid up to a certain energy\nscale, even a single evaporating BH may spoil the successful cosmology by\ninducing the decay of our electroweak vacuum. In this paper, we reinterpret\ncatalyzed vacuum decay by BHs, using an effective action for a thin-wall bubble\naround a BH to clarify the meaning of bounce solutions. We calculate bounce\nsolutions in the limit of a flat spacetime and in the limit of negligible\nbackreaction to the metric, where it is much easier to understand the physical\nmeaning, and compare these results with the full calculations done in the\nliterature. As a result, we give a physical interpretation of the enhancement\nfactor: it is nothing but the probability of producing states with a finite\nenergy. This makes it clear that all the other states such as plasma should\nalso be generated through the same mechanism, and calls for finite-density\ncorrections to the tunneling rate which tend to stabilize the false vacuum. We\nalso clarify that the dominant process is always consistent with the\nperiodicity indicated by the BH Hawking temperature after summing over all\npossible remnant BH masses or bubble energies, although the periodicity of each\nbounce solution as a function of a remnant BH can be completely different from\nthe inverse temperature of the system as mentioned in the previous literature.\n", "  The possibility to effect valley splitting of an electronic current in\ngraphene represents the essential component in the new field of valleytronics\nin such two-dimensional materials. Based on a symmetry analysis of the\nscattering matrix, we show that if the spatial distribution of multiple\npotential scatterers breaks mirror symmetry about the axis of incoming\nelectrons, then a splitting of the current between two valleys is observed.\nThis leads to the appearance of the valley Hall effect. We illustrate the\neffect of mirror symmetry breaking in a minimal system of two symmetric\nimpurities, demonstrating the splitting between valleys via the differential\ncross sections and non-vanishing skew parameter. We further discuss the role\nthat these effects may play in transport experiments.\n", "  The lowest-lying resonance in the QCD spectrum is the $0^{++}$ isoscalar\n$\\sigma$ meson, also known as the $f_0(500)$. We augment SU(2) chiral\nperturbation theory ($\\chi$PT) by including the $\\sigma$ meson as an additional\nexplicit degree of freedom, as proposed by Soto, Talavera, and Tarr\\'us and\nothers. In this effective field theory, denoted $\\chi$PT$_S$, the $\\sigma$\nmeson's well-established mass and decay width are not sufficient to properly\nrenormalize its self energy. At $\\mathcal{O}(p^4)$ another low-energy constant\nappears in the dressed $\\sigma$-meson propagator; we adjust it so that the\nisoscalar pion-pion scattering length is also reproduced. We compare the\nresulting amplitudes for the $\\pi\\pi\\rightarrow\\pi\\pi$ and\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow\\pi\\pi$ reactions to data from threshold through the\nenergies at which the $\\sigma$-meson resonance affects observables. The\nleading-order (LO) $\\pi \\pi$ amplitude reproduces the $\\sigma$-meson pole\nposition, the isoscalar $\\pi \\pi$ scattering lengths and $\\pi \\pi$ scattering\nand $\\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow \\pi \\pi$ data up to $\\sqrt{s} \\approx 0.5$ GeV.\nIt also yields a $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow\\pi\\pi$ amplitude that obeys the Ward\nidentity. The value obtained for the $\\pi^0$ polarizability is, however, only\nslightly larger than that obtained in standard $\\chi$PT.\n", "  Periodic driving of optical lattices has enabled the creation of novel\nbandstructures not realizable in static lattice systems, such as topological\nbands for neutral particles. However, especially driven systems of interacting\nbosonic particles often suffer from strong heating. We have systematically\nstudied heating in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in a driven\none-dimensional optical lattice. We find interaction-dependent heating rates\nthat depend both on the scattering length and the driving strength and identify\nthe underlying resonant intra- and interband scattering processes. By comparing\nexperimental data and theory, we find that for driving frequencies well above\nthe trap depth, the heating rate is dramatically reduced by the fact that\nresonantly scattered atoms leave the trap before dissipating their energy into\nthe system. This mechanism of Floquet evaporative cooling offers a powerful\nstrategy to minimize heating in Floquet engineered quantum gases.\n", "  We introduce a data assimilation method to estimate model parameters with\nobservations of passive tracers by directly assimilating Lagrangian Coherent\nStructures. Our approach differs from the usual Lagrangian Data Assimilation\napproach, where parameters are estimated based on tracer trajectories. We\nemploy the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework to avoid computing\nthe likelihood function of the coherent structure, which is usually\nunavailable. We solve the ABC by a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method, and use\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the coherent patterns from\ntracer trajectory data. Our new method shows remarkably improved results\ncompared to the bootstrap particle filter when the physical model exhibits\nchaotic advection.\n", "  $\\gamma$ spectra for positron annihilation in noble-gas atoms are calculated\nusing many-body theory for positron momenta up to the positronium-formation\nthreshold. This data is used, together with time-evolving positron-momentum\ndistributions determined in [arXiv:1706.01434 (2017)], to calculate the\ntime-varying $\\gamma$ spectra produced during positron cooling in noble gases.\nThe $\\gamma$-spectra and their $\\bar{S}$ and $\\bar{W}$ shape parameters are\nshown to be sensitive probes of the time evolution of the positron momentum\ndistribution, and thus provide a means of studying positron cooling that is\ncomplementary to positron lifetime spectroscopy.\n", "  Decoupling of heavy quarks at low energies can be described by means of an\neffective theory as shown by S. Weinberg in Ref. [1]. We study the decoupling\nof the charm quark by lattice simulations. We simulate a model, QCD with two\ndegenerate charm quarks. In this case the leading order term in the effective\ntheory is a pure gauge theory. The higher order terms are proportional to\ninverse powers of the charm quark mass $M$ starting at $M^{-2}$. Ratios of\nhadronic scales are equal to their value in the pure gauge theory up to power\ncorrections. We show, by precise measurements of ratios of scales defined from\nthe Wilson flow, that these corrections are very small and that they can be\ndescribed by a term proportional to $M^{-2}$ down to masses in the region of\nthe charm quark mass.\n", "  Leptoquarks occur in many new physics scenarios and could be the next big\ndiscovery at the LHC. The purpose of this paper is to point out that a\nmodel-independent search strategy covering all possible leptoquarks is possible\nand has not yet been fully exploited. To be systematic we organize the possible\nleptoquark final states according to a leptoquark matrix with entries\ncorresponding to nine experimentally distinguishable leptoquark decays: any of\n{light-jet, b-jet, top} with any of {neutrino, $e/\\mu$, $\\tau$}. The 9\npossibilities can be explored in a largely model-independent fashion with\npair-production of leptoquarks at the LHC. We review the status of experimental\nsearches for the 9 components of the leptoquark matrix, pointing out which 3\nhave not been adequately covered. We plead that experimenters publish bounds on\nleptoquark cross sections as functions of mass for as wide a range of\nleptoquark masses as possible. Such bounds are essential for reliable recasts\nto general leptoquark models. To demonstrate the utility of the leptoquark\nmatrix approach we collect and summarize searches with the same final states as\nleptoquark pair production and use them to derive bounds on a complete set of\nMinimal Leptoquark models which span all possible flavor and gauge\nrepresentations for scalar and vector leptoquarks.\n", "  We devise an optimised bi-component multi-layered dielectric stack design to\nenhance the local irradiance for efficient photovoltaic upconversion materials.\nThe field intensity profile throughout the photonic structure is numerically\noptimized by appropriate tuning of the individual layers' thicknesses. The\noptimality of the thus inferred structure is demonstrated by comparison with an\nanalytically derived upper bound. The optimized local irradiance is found to\nincrease exponentially with the number of layers, its rate determined by the\npermittivity ratio of the two material components. Manufacturing errors which\ninduce deviations from the optimised design are accounted for statistically,\nand set a finite limit to the achievable enhancement. Notwithstanding,\nrealistic assumptions on manufacturing errors still suggest achievable\nirradiances which are significantly larger than those obtained with the\nrecently proposed Bragg stack structures.\n", "  We provide a proposal, motivated by Separation of Variables and gauge theory\narguments, for constructing exact solutions to the quantum Baxter equation\nassociated to the $N$-particle relativistic Toda chain and test our proposal\nagainst numerical results. Quantum Mechanical non-perturbative corrections,\nessential in order to obtain a sensible solution, are taken into account in our\ngauge theory approach by considering codimension two defects on curved\nbackgrounds (squashed $S^5$ and degenerate limits) rather than flat space; this\nsetting also naturally incorporates exact quantization conditions and energy\nspectrum of the relativistic Toda chain as well as its modular dual structure.\n", "  General relativity's no-hair theorem states that isolated astrophysical black\nholes are described by only two numbers: mass and spin. As a consequence, there\nare strict relationships between the frequency and damping time of the\ndifferent modes of a perturbed Kerr black hole. Testing the no-hair theorem has\nbeen a longstanding goal of gravitational-wave astronomy. The recent detection\nof gravitational waves from black hole mergers would seem to make such tests\nimminent. We investigate how constraints on black hole ringdown parameters\nscale with the loudness of the ringdown signal---subject to the constraint that\nthe post-merger remnant must be allowed to settle into a perturbative,\nKerr-like state. In particular, we require that---for a given detector---the\ngravitational waveform predicted by numerical relativity is indistinguishable\nfrom an exponentially damped sine after time $t^\\text{cut}$. By requiring the\npost-merger remnant to settle into such a perturbative state, we find that\nconfidence intervals for ringdown parameters do not necessarily shrink with\nlouder signals. In at least some cases, more sensitive measurements probe later\ntimes without necessarily providing tighter constraints on ringdown frequencies\nand damping times. Preliminary investigations are unable to explain this result\nin terms of a numerical relativity artifact.\n", "  We study the motion of topological defects in 1+1 and 2+1 d relativistic\n$\\phi^6$ model with three equal vacua in the presence of radiation. We show\nthat even small fluctuations can trigger a chain reaction leading to vanishing\nof topological defects. Only one vacuum remains stable and domains containing\nother vacua vanish. We explain this phenomenon in terms of radiation pressure\n(both positive and negative). We construct an effective model which translates\nthe fluctuations into additional term in the field theory potential. In case of\ntwo dimensional model we find a relation between the critical size of the bulk\nand amplitude of the perturbation.\n", "  Complex electronic band structures, with multiple valleys or bands at the\nsame or similar energies can be beneficial for thermoelectric performance, but\nthe advantages can be offset by inter-valley and inter-band scattering. In this\npaper, we demonstrate how first-principles band structures coupled with\nrecently developed techniques for rigorous simulation of electron-phonon\nscattering provide the capabilities to realistically assess the benefits and\ntrade-offs associated with these materials. We illustrate the approach using\nn-type silicon as a model material and show that intervalley scattering is\nstrong. This example shows that the convergence of valleys and bands can\nimprove thermoelectric performance, but the magnitude of the improvement\ndepends sensitively on the relative strengths of intra- and inter-valley\nelectron scattering. Because anisotropy of the band structure also plays an\nimportant role, a measure of the benefit of band anisotropy in the presence of\nstrong intervalley scattering is presented.\n", "  We suggest that holographic tensor models related to SYK are viable\ncandidates for exactly (ie., non-perturbatively in $N$) solvable holographic\ntheories. The reason is that in these theories, the Hilbert space is a spinor\nrepresentation, and the Hamiltonian (at least in some classes) can be arranged\nto commute with the Clifford level. This makes the theory solvable level by\nlevel. We demonstrate this for the specific case of the uncolored $O(n)^3$\ntensor model with arbitrary even $n$, and reduce the question of determining\nthe spectrum and eigenstates to an algebraic equation relating Young tableaux.\nSolving this reduced problem is conceptually trivial and amounts to matching\nthe representations on either side, as we demonstrate explicitly at low levels.\nAt high levels, representations become bigger, but should still be tractable.\nNone of our arguments require any supersymmetry.\n", "  This article shows that the compactified Milne universe geometry, a toy model\nfor the big crunch/big bang transition, can be realized in hyperbolic\nmetamaterials, a new class of nanoengineered systems which have recently found\nits way as an experimental playground for cosmological ideas. On one side,\nKlein-Gordon particles, as well as tachyons, are used as probes of the Milne\ngeometry. On the other side, the propagation of light in two versions of a\nliquid crystal-based metamaterial provides the analogy. It is shown that ray\nand wave optics in the metamaterial mimic, respectively, the classical\ntrajectories and wave function propagation, of the Milne probes, leading to the\nexciting perspective of realizing experimental tests of particle tunneling\nthrough the cosmic singularity, for instance.\n", "  We apply the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method for the harmonic oscillator\nwith time dependent mass and frequency to the modes of a charged scalar field\nthat propagates in a curved, homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. We recover\nthe Bunch-Davies vacuum in the case of a flat DeSitter spacetime, the\nequivalent one in the case of a closed DeSitter spacetime and the invariant\nvacuum in a curved spacetime that evolves adiabatically. In the three cases, it\nis computed the thermodynamical magnitudes of entanglement between the modes of\nthe particles and antiparticles of the invariant vacuum, and the modification\nof the Friedmann equation caused by the existence of the energy density of\nentanglement. The amplitude of the vacuum fluctuations are also computed.\n", "  The linear Boltzmann equation approach is generalized to describe fractional\nsuperdiffusive transport of the Levy walk type in external force fields. The\ntime distribution between scattering events is assumed to have a finite mean\nvalue and infinite variance. It is completely characterized by the two\nscattering rates, one fractional and a normal one, which defines also the mean\nscattering rate. We formulate a general fractional linear Boltzmann equation\napproach and exemplify it with a particularly simple case of the Bohm and Gross\nscattering integral leading to a fractional generalization of the Bhatnagar,\nGross and Krook kinetic equation. Here, at each scattering event the particle\nvelocity is completely randomized and takes a value from equilibrium Maxwell\ndistribution at a given fixed temperature. We show that the retardation effects\nare indispensable even in the limit of infinite mean scattering rate and argue\nthat this novel fractional kinetic equation provides a viable alternative to\nthe fractional Kramers-Fokker-Planck (KFP) equation by Barkai and Silbey and\nits generalization by Friedrich et al. based on the picture of divergent mean\ntime between scattering events. The case of divergent mean time is also\ndiscussed at length and compared with the earlier results obtained within the\nfractional KFP.\n", "  We show that the critical temperature of a ferromagnetic phase transition in\na quasi-two-dimensional hole gas confined in a diluted magnetic semiconductor\nquantum well strongly depends on the hole chemical potential and hole density.\nThe significant variations of the the Curie temperature occur close to the\nLifshitz topological transition points where the hole Fermi surface acquires\nadditional components of topological connectivity due to the filling of excited\nsize-quantization subbands. The model calculations demonstrate that the Curie\ntemperature can be doubled by a small variation of the gate voltage for the\nCdMnTe/CdMgTe quantum well based device.\n", "  In this work, we perform a \\textit{toy-model} analysis for the unpolarized\nphoto- and electroproduction of $\\Lambda(1405)\\equiv\\Lambda^*$ via\n$\\gamma^{(*)}p\\to K^+\\pi^+\\Sigma^-$ by employing the effective Lagrangian\napproach at the tree level only. We consider that $\\Lambda^*$ consists of the\nhigh-mass ($H$) and low-mass ($L$) poles as suggested by the chiral unitary\nmodel (ChUM). We determine all the model parameters including coupling\nconstants and cutoff parameters for the phenomenological strong form factors by\nusing the theoretical information from ChUM and available experimental data.\nThe electromagnetic (EM) form factors for the two poles are parameterized\nappropriately being similar to that for the neutron by employing the ChUM\nestimates for the EM root-mean-squared (rms) radii for the two poles. We\nobserve from the numerical calculations that, for the photoproduction of\n$\\Lambda^*$, the interference between the two poles turns out to be\ndestructive, resulting in the single-peak line at\n$M_{\\pi^+\\Sigma^-}\\approx1405$ MeV in the invariant-mass distribution. On the\ncontrary, there appear two peaks in the distribution for the electroproduction\nas observed in the CLAS/Jlab electroproduction data, due to the constructive\ninterference, which is mainly caused by the Dirac form factors for the two\npoles. From this observation, we conclude that, in order to explain the photo-\nand electroproduction data simultaneously, i.e., \\textit{single} and\n\\textit{double} peaks, respectively, in the invariant-mass distribution, the\ninterference patterns for the two poles should follow those suggested by ChUM.\nIn turn, it is a strong theoretical and experimental supports for the two-pole\nstructure scenario for $\\Lambda^*$.\n", "  We have shown in paper I of this series (arXiv:1706.03795) that interstellar\ncommunication to nearby (pc) stars is possible at data rates of bits per second\nper Watt between a 1 m sized probe and a large receiving telescope (E-ELT, 39\nm), when optimizing all parameters such as frequency at 300-400 nm. We now\napply our framework of interstellar extinction and quantum state calculations\nfor photon encoding to the solar gravitational lens (SGL), which enlarges the\naperture (and thus the photon flux) of the receiving telescope by a factor of\n$>10^9$. For the first time, we show that the use of the SGL for communication\npurposes is possible. This was previously unclear because the Einstein ring is\nplaced inside the solar coronal noise, and contributing factors are difficult\nto determine. We calculate point-spread functions, aperture sizes, heliocentric\ndistance, and optimum communication frequency. The best wavelength for nearby\n(<100 pc) interstellar communication is limited by current technology to the UV\nand optical band. To suppress coronal noise, an advanced coronograph is\nrequired, alternatively an occulter could be used which would require a second\nspacecraft in formation flight 78 km from the receiver, and ~10 m in size. Data\nrates scale approximately linear with the SGL telescope size and with\nheliocentric distance. Achievable (receiving) data rates from Alpha Cen are\n1-10 Mbits per second per Watt for a pair of meter-sized telescopes, an\nimprovement of $10^6$ compared to using the same receiving telescope without\nthe SGL. A 1 m telescope in the SGL can receive data at rates comparable to a\nkm-class \"normal\" telescope.\n", "  We consider double-winding, triple-winding and multiple-winding Wilson loops\nin the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills gauge theory. We examine how the area law falloff of\nthe vacuum expectation value of a multiple-winding Wilson loop depends on the\nnumber of color $N$. In sharp contrast to the difference-of-areas law recently\nfound for a double-winding $SU(2)$ Wilson loop average, we show irrespective of\nthe spacetime dimensionality that a double-winding $SU(3)$ Wilson loop follows\na novel area law which is neither difference-of-areas nor sum-of-areas law for\nthe area law falloff and that the difference-of-areas law is excluded and the\nsum-of-areas law is allowed for $SU(N)$ ($N \\ge 4$), provided that the string\ntension obeys the Casimir scaling for the higher representations. Moreover, we\nextend these results to arbitrary multi-winding Wilson loops. Finally, we argue\nthat the area law follows a novel law, which is neither sum-of-areas nor\ndifference-of-areas law when $N\\ge 3$. In fact, such a behavior is exactly\nderived in the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the two-dimensional spacetime.\n", "  We consider electrically charged static nonextremal black holes in\n$d$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-(A)dS gravity, whose horizon is a generic\nEinstein space in $d-2$ dimensions. It is shown that for this system the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation is exactly solvable and admits two branches of\nsolutions. One of them exhibits a non-simply connected domain of integration\nconstants and does not reduce to the well-known solution for the $d=4$ BPS\ncase. The principal functions generate two first order flows that are\nanalytically different, but support the same general solution. One of the two\nsets of flow equations corresponds to those found by L\\\"u, Pope and\nV\\'azquez-Poritz in hep-th/0307001 and (for $d=4$ and $\\Lambda=0$) by Miller,\nSchalm and Weinberg in hep-th/0612308. This clarifies also the reason for the\nvery existence of first order equations for nonextremal black holes, namely,\nthey are just the expressions for the conjugate momenta in terms of derivatives\nof the principal function in a Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. In the last part of\nour paper we analyze how much of these integrability properties generalizes to\nmatter-coupled $N=2$, $d=4$ gauged supergravity.\n", "  Solid-oxide fuel cells produce electric current from energy released by a\nspontaneous electrochemical reaction. The efficiency of these devices depends\ncrucially on the microstructure of their electrodes and, in particular, on the\nthree-phase boundary (TPB) length, along which the energy-producing reaction\noccurs. We present a systematic maximisation of the TPB length as a function of\nfour readily-controllable microstructural parameters, for any given mean\nhydraulic radius, which is a conventional measure of the permeability to gas\nflow. We identify the maximising parameters and show that the TPB length can be\nincreased by a factor of over 300% compared to current common practices. We\nsupport this result by calculating the TPB of several numerically simulated\nstructures. We also compare four models for a single intergranular contact in\nthe sintered electrode and show that the model commonly used in the literature\nis oversimplified and unphysical. We then propose two alternatives.\n", "  We study correlation functions in the one-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupersymmetric SYK model. The leading order 4-point correlation functions are\ncomputed by summing over ladder diagrams expanded in a suitable basis of\nconformal eigenfunctions. A novelty of the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ model is that both\nsymmetric and antisymmetric eigenfunctions are required. Although we use a\ncomponent formalism, we verify that the operator spectrum and 4-point functions\nare consistent with $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry. We also confirm the\nmaximally chaotic behavior of this model and comment briefly on its 6-point\nfunctions.\n", "  We describe a multichannel magnetoencephalography (MEG) system that uses\noptically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) to sense the magnetic fields of the human\nbrain. The system consists of an array of 20 OPM channels conforming to the\nhuman subject's head, a person-sized magnetic shield containing the array and\nthe human subject, a laser system to drive the OPM array, and various control\nand data acquisitions systems. We conducted two MEG experiments: auditory\nevoked magnetic field (AEF) and somatosensory evoked magnetic field (SEF), on\nthree healthy male subjects, using both our OPM array and a 306-channel\nElekta-Neuromag superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) MEG system.\nThe described OPM array measures the tangential components of the magnetic\nfield as opposed to the radial component measured by all SQUID-based MEG\nsystems. Herein we compare the results of the OPM- and SQUID-based MEG systems\non the auditory and somatosensory data recorded in the same individuals on both\nsystems.\n", "  The standard-model extension (SME) is an effective field theory framework\naiming at parametrizing any violation to the Lorentz symmetry (LS) in all\nsectors of physics. In this Letter, we report the first direct experimental\nmeasurement of SME coefficients performed simultaneously within two sectors of\nthe SME framework using lunar laser ranging observations. We consider the pure\ngravitational sector and the classical point-mass limit in the matter sector of\nthe minimal SME. We report no deviation from general relativity and put new\nrealistic stringent constraints on LS violations improving up to 3 orders of\nmagnitude previous estimations.\n", "  The landscape of ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is drastically changing\nwith the perspective of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) composed of more\nthan 100 Cherenkov telescopes. For the first time in this energy domain, CTA\nwill be operated as an observatory open to the astronomy community. In this\ncontext, a structured high level data model is being developed to describe a\nCTA observation. The data model includes different classes of metadata on the\nproject definition, the configuration of the instrument, the ambient\nconditions, the data acquisition and the data processing. This last part relies\non the Provenance Data Model developed within the International Virtual\nObservatory Alliance (IVOA), for which CTA is one of the main use cases. The\nCTA data model should also be compatible with the Virtual Observatory (VO) for\ndata diffusion. We have thus developed a web-based data diffusion prototype to\ntest this requirement and ensure the compliance.\n", "  We investigate multiple scattering of scalar waves by an ensemble of $N$\nresonant point scatterers in three dimensions. For up to $N = 21$ scatterers,\nwe numerically optimize the positions of the individual scatterers, such as to\nmaximize the total scattering cross section for an incoming plane wave, on the\none hand, and to minimize the decay rate associated to a long-lived scattering\nresonance, on the other hand. In both cases, the optimimum is achieved by\nconfigurations where all scatterers are placed on a line parallel to the\ndirection of the incoming plane wave. The associated maximal scattering cross\nsection increases quadratically with the number of scatterers for large $N$,\nwhereas the minimal decay rate -- which is realized by configurations that are\nnot the same as those that maximize the scattering cross section -- decreases\nexponentially as a function of $N$. Finally, we also analyze the stability of\nour optimized configurations with respect to small random displacements of the\nscatterers. These results demonstrate that optimized configurations of\nscatterers bear a considerable potential for applications such as quantum\nmemories or mirrors consisting of only a few atoms.\n", "  We investigate magnetic properties of an $S$=1/2 quasi-one dimensional\norganic antiferromagnet, D-F$_{5}$PNN using magnetization measurements taken at\ntemperatures as low as 0.5 K. Three distinct phases were observed consisting of\nuniform, dimerized (D), and incommensurate (I) spin structures in the magnetic\nfield versus temperature plane, where a significant hysteresis appears between\nD-I transitions in the field scan measurements. A combination of magnon ($S$=1)\nand soliton ($S$=1/2) excitations have successfully reproduced the observed\nmagnetic susceptibility. In addition, such excitations provide a reasonable\ninterpretation of the temperature dependent electron spin resonance (ESR)\nspectra. By comparison with the theoretical study, we conclude that\nD-F$_{5}$PNN is an ideal compound for investigating the spin-Peierls\ntransition.\n", "  We investigate the stability, with respect to spatial inhomogeneity, of a\ntwo-dimensional dense neutrino gas. The system exhibits growth of seed\ninhomogeneity due to nonlinear coherent neutrino self-interactions. In the\nabsence of incoherent collisional effects, we observe a dependence of this\ninstability growth rate on the neutrino mass spectrum: the normal neutrino mass\nhierarchy exhibits spatial instability over a larger range of neutrino number\ndensity compared to that of the inverted case. We further consider the effect\nof elastic incoherent collisions of the neutrinos with a static background of\nheavy, nucleon-like scatterers. At small scales, the growth of flavor\ninstability can be suppressed by collisions. At large length scales we find,\nperhaps surprisingly, that for inverted neutrino mass hierarchy incoherent\ncollisions fail to suppress flavor instabilities, independent of the coupling\nstrength.\n", "  Cat-state qubits (qubits encoded with cat states) have recently drawn\nintensive attention due to their enhanced life times with quantum error\ncorrection. We here propose a method to implement a universal controlled-phase\ngate of two cat-state qubits, via two microwave resonators coupled to a\nsuperconducting transmon qutrit. During the gate operation, the qutrit remains\nin the ground state; thus decoherence from the qutrit is greatly suppressed.\nThis proposal requires only two basic operations and neither classical pulse\nnor measurement is needed; therefore the gate realization is simple. Numerical\nsimulations show that high-fidelity implementation of this gate is feasible\nwith current circuit QED technology. The proposal is quite general and can be\napplied to implement the proposed gate with two microwave resonators or two\noptical cavities coupled to a single three-level natural or artificial atom.\n", "  We show that non-linear Schwarzian differential equations emerging from\ncovariance symmetry conditions imposed on linear differential operators with\nhypergeometric function solutions, can be generalized to arbitrary order linear\ndifferential operators with polynomial coefficients having selected\ndifferential Galois groups. For order three and order four linear differential\noperators we show that this pullback invariance up to conjugation eventually\nreduces to symmetric powers of an underlying order-two operator. We give,\nprecisely, the conditions to have modular correspondences solutions for such\nSchwarzian differential equations, which was an open question in a previous\npaper. We analyze in detail a pullbacked hypergeometric example generalizing\nmodular forms, that ushers a pullback invariance up to operator homomorphisms.\nWe expect this new concept to be well-suited in physics and enumerative\ncombinatorics. We finally consider the more general problem of the equivalence\nof two different order-four linear differential\n  Calabi-Yau operators up to pullbacks and conjugation, and clarify the cases\nwhere they have the same Yukawa couplings.\n", "  We present an overview of scenarios where the observed Dark Matter (DM)\nabundance consists of Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs), produced\nnon-thermally by the so-called freeze-in mechanism. In contrast to the usual\nfreeze-out scenario, frozen-in FIMP DM interacts very weakly with the particles\nin the visible sector and never attained thermal equilibrium with the\nbaryon-photon fluid in the early Universe. Instead of being determined by its\nannihilation strength, the DM abundance depends on the decay and annihilation\nstrengths of particles in equilibrium with the baryon-photon fluid, as well as\ncouplings in the DM sector. This makes frozen-in DM very difficult but not\nimpossible to test. In this review, we present the freeze-in mechanism and its\nvariations considered in the literature (dark freeze-out and reannihilation),\ncompare them to the standard DM freeze-out scenario, discuss several aspects of\nmodel building, and pay particular attention to observational properties and\ngeneral testability of such feebly interacting DM.\n", "  A free surface of a dilute $^3$He-$^4$He liquid mixture is a unique system\nwhere two Fermi liquids with distinct dimensions coexist: a three-dimensional\n(3D) $^3$He Fermi liquid in bulk and a two-dimensional (2D) $^3$He Fermi liquid\nat the surface. To investigate a novel effect generated by the interaction\nbetween the two Fermi liquids, mobility of a Wigner crystal of electrons formed\non the free surface of the mixture is studied. An anomalous enhancement of the\nmobility, compared with the case where the 3D and 2D systems do not interact\nwith each other, is observed. The enhancement is explained by non-trivial\nreflection of 3D quasiparticles from the surface covered with the 2D $^3$He\nsystem.\n", "  Observational evidence for dark matter stems from its gravitational\ninteractions, and as of yet there has been no evidence for dark matter\ninteracting via other means. We examine models where dark matter interactions\nare purely gravitational in a Randall-Sundrum background. In particular, the\nKaluza-Klein tower of gravitons which result from the warped fifth dimension\ncan provide viable annihilation channels into Standard Model final states, and\nwe find that we can achieve values of the annihilation cross section, $\\left<\n\\sigma v \\right>$, which are consistent with the observed relic abundance in\nthe case of spin-1 dark matter. We examine constraints on these models\nemploying both the current photon line and continuum indirect dark matter\nsearches, and assess the prospects of hunting for the signals of such models in\nfuture direct and indirect detection experiments.\n", "  Colloidal core/shell InP/ZnSe quantum dots (QDs), recently produced using an\nimproved synthesis method, have a great potential in life-science applications\nas well as in integrated quantum photonics and quantum information processing\nas single-photon emitters. Single-particle spectroscopy of 10-nm QDs with\n3.2-nm cores reveals strong photon antibunching attributed to fast (70-ps)\nAuger recombination of multiple excitons. The QDs exhibit very good\nphotostability under strong optical excitation. We demonstrate that the\nantibunching is preserved when the QDs are excited above the saturation\nintensity of the fundamental-exciton transition. This result paves the way\ntowards their usage as high-purity on-demand single-photon emitters at room\ntemperature. Unconventionally, despite the strong Auger blockade mechanism,\nInP/ZnSe QDs also display very little luminescence intermittency (\"blinking\"),\nwith a simple on/off blinking pattern. The analysis of single-particle\nluminescence statistics places these InP/ZnSe QDs in the class of nearly\nblinking-free QDs, with emission stability comparable to state-of-the-art\nthick-shell and alloyed-interface CdSe/CdS, but with improved single-photon\npurity.\n", "  Active systems are inherently out of equilibrium, as they collect energy from\ntheir surroundings and transform it into directed motion. A recent theoretical\nstudy suggests that binary mixtures of active particles with distinct effective\ndiffusion coefficients exhibit dynamical demixing above a threshold ratio of\nthe diffusion coefficients. Here, we show that this threshold may be reduced\ndrastically in the presence of external fields. We investigate the demixing as\na function of the ratio of the diffusion coefficients and discuss the\nimplications of the results for active systems.\n", "  We study several models of staircase polygons on the $45^\\circ$ rotated\nsquare lattice, which interact with an impenetrable surface while also being\npushed towards or pulled away from the surface by a force. The surface\ninteraction is governed by a fugacity $a$ and the force by a fugacity $y$.\nStaircase polygons are simplifications of more general self-avoiding polygons,\na well-studied model of interacting ring polymers. For this simplified case we\nare able to exactly determine the limiting free energy in the full $a$-$y$\nplane, and demonstrate that staircase polygons exhibit four different phases,\nincluding a \"mixed\" adsorbed-ballistic phase.\n", "  We present a new model of quantum gravity as a theory of random geometries\ngiven explicitly in terms of a multitrace matrix model. This is a\ngeneralization of the usual discretized random surfaces of 2D quantum gravity\nwhich works away from two dimensions and captures a large class of spaces\nadmiting a finite spectral triple. These multitrace matrix models sustain\nemergent geometry as well as growing dimensions and topology change.\n", "  We investigate the Heisenberg XXZ-chain with long-range interactions in the\nZ-dimension. By applying two magnetic boundary reservoirs we drive the system\nout of equilibrium and induce a non-zero steady state current. The long-range\ncoupled chain shows nearly ballistic transport and linear response for all\npotential differences of the external reservoirs. In contrast, the common\nisotropic nearest-neighbor coupling shows negative differential conductivity\nand a transition from diffusive to subdiffusive transport for a far from\nequilibrium driving. Adding disorder, the change in the transport for nearest\nneighbor coupling is therefore highly dependent on the driving. We find for the\ndisordered long-range coupled XXZ-chain, any change in the transport behavior\nis independent of the potential difference and the coupling strengths of the\nexternal reservoirs.\n", "  The Stark resonance parameters for the $3a_{1}$ molecular orbital of H$_{2}$O\nare computed by solving a system of partial differential equations in spherical\npolar coordinates. The starting point of the calculation is the quantum\npotential derived for this orbital from a single-center expanded Hartree-Fock\norbital. The resonance positions and widths are obtained after applying an\nexterior complex scaling technique to describe the ionization regime for\nexternal fields applied along the two distinct $\\hat{z}$ directions associated\nwith the symmetry axis. The procedure thus avoids the computation of\nmulti-center integrals, yet takes into account the geometric shape of a\nsimplified molecular orbital in the field-free case.\n", "  We investigate the detectability of massive mode of polarization of\nGravitational Waves (GWs) in f(R) theory of gravity associated with Gamma Ray\nBursts (GRBs) sources. We obtain the beam pattern function of Laser\nInterferometric Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO) corresponding to the\nmassive polarization of GWs and perform Bayesian analysis to study this\npolarization. It is found that the massive polarization component with a mass\nof 10^-22eV/c2 is too weak to be detected at LIGO with its current\nconfiguration.\n", "  We describe the non-equilibrium dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models of\nfermions with all-to-all interactions. These provide tractable models of the\ndynamics of quantum systems without quasiparticle excitations. The\nKadanoff-Baym equations show that the final state is thermal, and their\nnumerical analysis appears consistent with a thermalization rate proportional\nto the absolute temperature of the final state. We also obtain an exact\nanalytic solution of the non-equilibrium dynamics in the large $q$ limit of a\nmodel with $q$ fermion interactions: in this limit, the thermalization of the\nfermion Green's function is instantaneous.\n", "  Following recent Verlinde's heuristic construction or emergent gravity,\nHossenfelder wrote down the Lagrangian capturing some aspects of this theory.\nWe point out that there is an error in calculations whose consequence is that a\ncosmological de Sitter space solution is not recovered from this Lagrangian. We\ncorrect this error in order to obtain the desired solution. We also show that\nsmall perturbations around de Sitter space grow, which implies that this state\nis not stable. However, the presence of matter and radiation might in principle\nprovide stability.\n", "  In this paper we assess the predictive power of the self-consistent hybrid\nfunctional scPBE0 in calculating the band gap of oxide semiconductors. The\ncomputational procedure is based on the self-consistent evaluation of the\nmixing parameter $\\alpha$ by means of an iterative calculation of the static\ndielectric constant using the perturbation expansion after discretization\n(PEAD) method and making use of the relation $\\alpha = 1/\\epsilon_{\\infty}$.\nOur materials dataset is formed by 30 compounds covering a wide range of band\ngaps and dielectric properties, and includes materials with a wide spectrum of\napplication as thermoelectrics, photocatalysis, photovoltaics, transparent\nconducting oxides, and refractory materials. Our results show that the scPBE0\nfunctional provides better band gaps than the non self-consistent hybrids PBE0\nand HSE06, but scPBE0 does not show significant improvement on the description\nof the static dielectric constants. Overall, the scPBE0 data exhibit a mean\nabsolute percentage error of 14 \\% (band gaps) and 10 \\% ($\\epsilon_\\infty$).\nFor materials with weak dielectric screening and large excitonic biding\nenergies scPBE0, unlike PBE0 and HSE06, overestimates the band gaps, but the\nvalue of the gap become very close to the experimental value when excitonic\neffects are included (e.g. for SiO$_2$). However, special caution must be given\nto the compounds with small band gaps due to the tendency of scPBE0 to\noverestimate the dielectric constant in proximity of the metallic limit.\n", "  A very massive star with a carbon-oxygen core in the range of $64$\nM$_{\\odot}<M_{\\mathrm{CO}}<133$ M$_{\\odot}$ is expected to undergo a very\ndifferent kind of explosion known as a pair instability supernova. Pair\ninstability supernovae are candidates for superluminous supernovae due to the\nprodigious amounts of radioactive elements they create. While the basic\nmechanism for the explosion is understood, how a star reaches a state is not,\nthus observations of a nearby pair-instability supernova would allow us to test\ncurrent models of stellar evolution at the extreme of stellar masses. Much will\nbe sought within the electromagnetic radiation we detect from such a supernova\nbut we should not forget that the neutrinos from a pair-instability supernova\ncontain unique signatures of the event that unambiguously identify this type of\nexplosion. We calculate the expected neutrino flux at Earth from two,\none-dimensional pair-instability supernova simulations which bracket the mass\nrange of stars which explode by this mechanism taking into account the full\ntime and energy dependence of the neutrino emission and the flavor evolution\nthrough the outer layers of the star. We calculate the neutrino signals in five\ndifferent detectors chosen to represent present or near future designs. We find\nthe more massive progenitors explode as pair-instability supernova which can\neasily be detected in multiple different neutrino detectors at the `standard'\nsupernova distance of $10\\;{\\rm kpc}$ producing several events in DUNE, JUNE\nand SuperKamiokande, while the lightest progenitors only produce a handful of\nevents (if any) in the same detectors. The proposed HyperKamiokande detector\nwould detect neutrinos from a large pair-instability supernova as far as $\\sim\n50\\;{\\rm kpc}$ allowing it to reach the Megallanic Clouds and the several very\nhigh mass stars known to exist there.\n", "  We discuss free Dirac fermions rotating uniformly inside a cylindrical cavity\nin the presence of background magnetic field parallel to the cylinder axis. We\nshow that in addition to the known bulk states the system contains massive edge\nstates with the masses inversely proportional to the radius of the cylinder.\nThe edge states appear at quantized threshold values of the fermion mass. In\nthe limit of infinite fermion mass the masses of the edge states remain finite\nbut, generally, nonzero as contrasted to the bulk states whose masses become\ninfinite. The presence of magnetic field affects the spectrum of both bulk and\nedge modes, and the masses of the edge states may vanish at certain values of\nmagnetic field. The moment of inertia of Dirac fermions is non-monotonically\nincreasing, oscillating function of magnetic field. The oscillations are well\npronounced in a low-temperature domain and they disappear at high temperatures.\n", "  The effectiveness of molecular-based light harvesting relies on transport of\noptical excitations, excitons, to charg-transfer sites. Measuring exciton\nmigration has, however, been challenging because of the mismatch between\nnanoscale migration lengths and the diffraction limit. In organic\nsemiconductors, common bulk methods employ a series of films terminated at\nquenching substrates, altering the spatioenergetic landscape for migration.\nHere we instead define quenching boundaries all-optically with sub-diffraction\nresolution, thus characterizing spatiotemporal exciton migration on its native\nnanometer and picosecond scales without disturbing morphology. By transforming\nstimulated emission depletion microscopy into a time-resolved ultrafast\napproach, we measure a 16-nm migration length in CN-PPV conjugated polymer\nfilms. Combining these experiments with Monte Carlo exciton hopping simulations\nshows that migration in CN-PPV films is essentially diffusive because intrinsic\nchromophore energetic disorder is comparable to inhomogeneous broadening among\nchromophores. This framework also illustrates general trends across materials.\nOur new approach's sub-diffraction resolution will enable previously\nunattainable correlations of local material structure to the nature of exciton\nmigration, applicable not only to photovoltaic or display-destined organic\nsemiconductors but also to explaining the quintessential exciton migration\nexhibited in photosynthesis.\n", "  Denef and Douglas have observed that in certain landscape models the problem\nof finding small values of the cosmological constant is a large instance of an\nNP-hard problem. The number of elementary operations (quantum gates) needed to\nsolve this problem by brute force search exceeds the estimated computational\ncapacity of the observable universe. Here we describe a way out of this\npuzzling circumstance: despite being NP-hard, the problem of finding a small\ncosmological constant can be attacked by more sophisticated algorithms whose\nperformance vastly exceeds brute force search. In fact, in some parameter\nregimes the average-case complexity is polynomial. We demonstrate this by\nexplicitly finding a cosmological constant of order $10^{-120}$ in a randomly\ngenerated $10^9$-dimensional ADK landscape.\n", "  Relativistic quantum systems that admit scattering experiments are\nquantitatively described by effective field theories, where $S$-matrix\nkinematics and symmetry considerations are encoded in the operator spectrum of\nthe EFT. In this paper we use the $S$-matrix to derive the structure of the EFT\noperator basis, providing complementary descriptions in (i) position space\nutilizing the conformal algebra and cohomology and (ii) momentum space via an\nalgebraic formulation in terms of a ring of momenta with kinematics implemented\nas an ideal. These frameworks systematically handle redundancies associated\nwith equations of motion (on-shell) and integration by parts (momentum\nconservation).\n  We introduce a partition function, termed the Hilbert series, to enumerate\nthe operator basis--correspondingly, the $S$-matrix--and derive a matrix\nintegral expression to compute the Hilbert series. The expression is general,\neasily applied in any spacetime dimension, with arbitrary field content and\n(linearly realized) symmetries.\n  In addition to counting, we discuss construction of the basis. Simple\nalgorithms follow from the algebraic formulation in momentum space. We\nexplicitly compute the basis for operators involving up to $n=5$ scalar fields.\nThis construction universally applies to fields with spin, since the operator\nbasis for scalars encodes the momentum dependence of $n$-point amplitudes.\n  We discuss in detail the operator basis for non-linearly realized symmetries.\nIn the presence of massless particles, there is freedom to impose additional\nstructure on the $S$-matrix in the form of soft limits. The most na\\\"ive\nimplementation for massless scalars leads to the operator basis for pions,\nwhich we confirm using the standard CCWZ formulation for non-linear\nrealizations.\n", "  In quantum field theory, the photon-fermion vertex can be described in terms\nof four form factors which encode the static electromagnetic properties of the\nparticle, namely its charge, magnetic dipole moment, electric dipole moment,\nand anapole moment. For Majorana fermions, only the anapole moment can be\nnonzero, a consequence of the fact that these particles are their own\nantiparticles. Using the framework of quantum field theory, we perform a\nscattering calculation which probes the anapole moment with a spinless charged\nparticle. In the limit of low-momentum transfer, we confirm that the anapole\ncan be classically likened to a point-like toroidal solenoid whose magnetic\nfield is confined to the origin. Such a toroidal current distribution can be\nused to demonstrate the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We find that, in the\nnon-relativistic limit, our scattering cross section agrees with a quantum\nmechanical computation of the cross section for a spinless current scattered by\nan infinitesimally thin toroidal solenoid. Our presentation is geared toward\nadvanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students. This work serves as an\nintroduction to the anapole moment and also provides an example of how one can\ndevelop an understanding of a particle's electromagnetic properties in quantum\nfield theory.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the late-time cosmic acceleration in mimetic\n$f(R,T)$ gravity with Lagrange multiplier and potential in a Universe\ncontaining, besides radiation and dark energy, a self-interacting (collisional)\nmatter. We obtain through the modified Friedmann equations, the main equation\nthat can describe the cosmological evolution and with several models from\n$Q(z)$ and the well known particular model $f(R, T)$, we perform an analysis of\nthe late-time evolution. We examine the behavior of the Hubble parameter, the\ndark energy equation of state and the total effective equation of state and we\ncompare in each case the resulting picture with the non-collisional matter\n(assumed as dust) and also with the collisional matter in mimetic $f(R, T)$\ngravity. The results obtained are in good agreement with the observational data\nand show that in presence of the collisional matter the dark energy\noscillations in mimetic f(R, T) gravity can be damped.\n", "  We investigate the propagation of gravitational waves in linearized\nChern-Simons (CS) modified gravity by considering two nondynamical models for\nthe coupling field $\\theta$: (i) a domain wall and (ii) a surface layer of\n$\\theta$, motivated by their relevance in condensed matter physics. We\ndemonstrate that the metric and its first derivative become discontinuous for a\ndomain wall of $\\theta$, and we determine the boundary conditions by realizing\nthat the additional contribution to the wave equation corresponds to one of the\nself-adjoint extensions of the D'Alembert operator. Nevertheless, such\ndiscontinuous metric satisfies the area matching conditions introduced by\nBarrett. On the other hand, the propagation through a surface layer of $\\theta$\nbehaves similarly to the propagation of electromagnetic waves in CS extended\nelectrodynamics. In both cases we calculate the corresponding reflection and\ntransmission amplitudes. As a consequence of the distributional character of\nthe additional terms in the equations that describe wave propagation, the\nresults obtained for the domain wall are not reproduced when the thickness of\nthe surface layer goes to zero, as one could naively expect.\n", "  We present a generalization of Bloch's theorem to finite-range lattice\nsystems of independent fermions, in which translation symmetry is broken only\nby arbitrary boundary conditions, by providing exact, analytic expressions for\nall energy eigenvalues and eigenstates. By transforming the single-particle\nHamiltonian into a corner-modified banded block-Toeplitz matrix, a key step is\na bipartition of the lattice, which splits the eigenvalue problem into a system\nof bulk and boundary equations. The eigensystem inherits most of its solutions\nfrom an auxiliary, infinite translation-invariant Hamiltonian that allows for\nnon-unitary representations of translation symmetry. A reformulation of the\nboundary equation in terms of a boundary matrix ensures compatibility with the\nboundary conditions, and determines the allowed energy eigenstates. We show how\nthe boundary matrix captures the interplay between bulk and boundary\nproperties, leading to efficient indicators of bulk-boundary correspondence.\nRemarkable consequences of our generalized Bloch theorem are the engineering of\nHamiltonians that host perfectly localized, robust zero-energy edge modes, and\nthe predicted emergence, e.g. in Kitaev's chain, of localized excitations whose\namplitudes decay exponentially with a power-law prefactor. We further show how\nthe theorem yields diagonalization algorithms for the class of Hamiltonians\nunder consideration, and use the proposed bulk-boundary indicator to\ncharacterize the topological response of a multi-band time-reversal invariant\ns-wave superconductor under twisted boundary conditions, showing how a\nfractional Josephson effect can occur without a fermionic parity switch.\nFinally, we establish connections to the transfer matrix method and\ndemonstrate, using the paradigmatic Kitaev's chain example, that a\nnon-diagonalizable transfer matrix signals the presence of solutions with a\npower-law prefactor.\n", "  Using polarization-resolved transient reflection spectroscopy, we investigate\nthe ultrafast modulation of light interacting with a metasurface consisting of\ncoherently vibrating nanophotonic meta-atoms in the form of U-shaped split-ring\nresonators, that exhibit co-localized optical and mechanical resonances. With a\ntwo-dimensional square-lattice array of these resonators formed of gold on a\nglass substrate, we monitor the visible-pump-pulse induced gigahertz\noscillations in intensity of reflected linearly-polarized infrared probe light\npulses, modulated by the resonators effectively acting as miniature tuning\nforks. A multimodal vibrational response involving the opening and closing\nmotion of the split rings is detected in this way. Numerical simulations of the\nassociated transient deformations and strain fields elucidate the complex\nnanomechanical dynamics contributing to the ultrafast optical modulation, and\npoint to the role of acousto-plasmonic interactions through the opening and\nclosing motion of the SRR gaps as the dominant effect. Applications include\nultrafast acoustooptic modulator design and sensing.\n", "  Quantifying the statistics of occupancy of solvent molecules in the vicinity\nof solutes is central to our understanding of solvation phenomena. Number\nfluctuations in small `solvation shells' around solutes cannot be described\nwithin the macroscopic grand canonical framework using a single chemical\npotential that represents the solvent `bath'. In this communication, we\nhypothesize that molecular-sized observation volumes such as solvation shells\nare best described by coupling the solvation shell with a mixture of particle\nbaths each with its own chemical potential. We confirm our hypotheses by\nstudying the enhanced fluctuations in the occupancy statistics of hard sphere\nsolvent particles around a distinguished hard sphere solute particle.\nConnections with established theories of solvation are also discussed.\n", "  The kagome lattice is a paragon of geometrical frustration, long-studied for\nits association with novel ground-states including spin liquids (SLs). Many\nrecently synthesized kagome materials feature rare-earth ions, which may be\nexpected to exhibit highly anisotropic exchange interactions. The consequences\nof this combination of strong exchange anisotropy and extreme geometrical\nfrustration are yet to be fully understood. Here, we establish a general\npicture of the interactions and resulting ground-states (GSs) arising from\nnearest neighbour exchange anisotropy on the kagome lattice. We determine a\ngeneric anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian from symmetry arguments. In the\nhigh-symmetry case where reflection in the kagome plane is a symmetry of the\nsystem, the generic nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian can be locally defined as a\nXYZ model with out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We proceed to\nstudy its phase diagram in the classical limit, making use of an exact\nreformulation of the Hamiltonian in terms of irreducible representations\n(irreps) of the lattice symmetry group. This reformulation in terms of irreps\nnaturally explains the three-fold mapping between SLs recently studied on\nkagome by the present authors [Nat Commun 7, 10297 (2016)]. In addition, a\nnumber of unusual states are stabilised in the regions where different forms of\nGS order compete, including a stripy phase with a local Z8 symmetry and a\nclassical analogue of a chiral SL. This generic Hamiltonian also turns out to\nbe a fruitful hunting ground for coexistence of different forms of magnetic\norder, or of order and disorder, which we find is a particular property of the\nkagome lattice arising from the odd number of spins per frustrated unit. These\nresults are compared and contrasted with those obtained on the pyrochlore\nlattice, and connection is made with recent progress in understanding quantum\nmodels with S = 1/2\n", "  We study moduli stabilization of the F-theory compactified on an elliptically\nfibered Calabi-Yau fourfold. Our setup is based on the mirror symmetry\nframework including brane deformations. The complex structure moduli dependence\nof the resulting 4D N=1 effective theory is determined by the associated\nfourfold period integrals. By turning on appropriate G-fluxes, we explicitly\ndemonstrate that all the complex structure moduli fields can be stabilized\naround the large complex structure point of the F-theory fourfold.\n", "  In compressive fracture of dry plexiform bone, we examine the individual\nroles of overall mean porosity, the connectivity of the porosity network, and\nthe elastic as well as the failure properties of the non-porous matrix, using a\nrandom spring network model. Porosity network structure is shown to reduce the\ncompressive strength by upto 30%. However, the load bearing capacity increases\nwith increase in either of the matrix properties - elastic modulus or failure\nstrain threshold. To validate the porosity-based RSNM model with available\nexperimental data, bone-specific failure strain thresholds for the ideal matrix\nof similar elastic properties were estimated to be within 60% of each other.\nFurther, we observe the avalanche size exponents to be independent of the\nbone-dependent parameters as well as the structure of the porosity network.\n", "  Biological systems have to build models from their sensory data that allow\nthem to efficiently process previously unseen inputs. Here, we study a neural\nnetwork learning a linearly separable rule using examples provided by a\nteacher. We analyse the ability of the network to apply the rule to new inputs,\nthat is to generalise from past experience. Using stochastic thermodynamics, we\nshow that the thermodynamic costs of the learning process provide an upper\nbound on the amount of information that the network is able to learn from its\nteacher for both batch and online learning. This allows us to introduce a\nthermodynamic efficiency of learning. We analytically compute the dynamics and\nthe efficiency of a noisy neural network performing online learning in the\nthermodynamic limit. In particular, we analyse three popular learning\nalgorithms, namely Hebbian, Perceptron and AdaTron learning. Our work extends\nthe methods of stochastic thermodynamics to a new type of learning problem and\nmight form a suitable basis for investigating the thermodynamics of\ndecision-making.\n", "  Context. Recent high angular resolution polarimetric continuum observations\nof circumstellar disks provide new insights into their magnetic field. However,\ndirect constraints are limited to the plane of sky component of the magnetic\nfield. Observations of Zeeman split spectral lines are a potential approach to\nenhance these insights by providing complementary information.\n  Aims. We investigate which constraints for magnetic fields in circumstellar\ndisks can be obtained from Zeeman observations of the $113~\\mathrm{GHz}$ CN\nlines. Furthermore, we analyze the requirements to perform these observations\nand their dependence on selected quantities.\n  Methods. We simulate the Zeeman splitting with the radiative transfer (RT)\ncode POLARIS (Reissl et al. 2016) extended by our Zeeman splitting RT extension\nZRAD (Brauer et al. 2017), which is based on the line RT code Mol3D (Ober et\nal. 2015).\n  Results. We find that Zeeman observations of the $113~\\mathrm{GHz}$ CN lines\nprovide significant insights into the magnetic field of circumstellar disks.\nHowever, with the capabilities of recent and upcoming instrument/observatories,\neven spatially unresolved observations would be challenging. Nevertheless,\nthese observations are feasible for the most massive disks with a strong\nmagnetic field and high abundance of CN/H. The most restrictive quantity is the\nmagnetic field strength, which should be at least in the order of\n$\\sim1~\\mathrm{mG}$. In addition, the inclination of the disk should be around\n$60\\deg$ to preserve the ability to derive the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic\nfield strength and to obtain a sufficiently high circularly polarized flux.\n", "  In this work, transport properties of the nonadiabatically pumped\ndouble-quantum-well (DQW) structure are studied. Different from a single\nquantum well, band mixing in the DQW generates bonding and antibonding states,\nwhose wave functions have different spatial symmetry. By applying a\ntime-dependent electric potential to the two well regions simultaneously,\nFloquet sidebands are formed, which constitutes additional quantum tunneling\npaths. When one of the Floquet sidebands coincides with the bonding or\nantibonding quasibound states within the DQW structure, sharp Fano resonances\nare found in the transmission coefficients as well as in the differential shot\nnoise spectra. While such Fano resonances originate from quantum interference,\ntheir shapes are strikingly different for transport via the bonding state and\nvia the antibonding state. The Fano resonance via the even-parity bonding state\nshows a perfect transmission followed by a total reflection and the Fano\nresonance via the odd-parity antibonding state has a reversed symmetry and\nshows a total reflection before a perfect transmission.\n", "  We investigate the possibility to use transient absorption of a coherent\nbound electron wave packet in hydrogen as an attosecond pulse characterization\ntechnique. In recent work we have shown that photoionization of such a coherent\nbound electron wave packet opens up for pulse characterization with\nunprecedented temporal accuracy --- independent of the atomic structure ---\nwith maximal photoemission at all kinetic energies given a wave packet with\nzero relative phase [Pabst and Dahlstr\\\"om, Phys. Rev. A, 94, 13411 (2016)].\nHere, we perform numerical propagation of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation and analytical calculations based on perturbation theory to show that\nthe energy-resolved maximal absorption of photons from the attosecond pulse\ndoes not uniquely occur at zero relative phase of the initial wave packet.\nInstead, maximal absorption occurs at different relative wave packet phases,\ndistributed as a non-monotonous function with a smooth $-\\pi/2$ shift across\nthe central photon energy (given a Fourier-limited Gaussian pulse). Similar\nresults are found also in helium. Our finding is surprising because it implies\nthat the energy-resolved photoelectrons are not mapped one-to-one with the\nenergy-resolved absorbed photons of the attosecond pulse.\n", "  We numerically study the spin-$1/2$ breathing kagome lattice. In this\nvariation of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet, the spins belonging to\nupward and downward facing triangles have different coupling strengths. Using\nthe density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method and exact\ndiagonalization, we show that the kagome antiferromagnet spin liquid is\nextremely robust to this anisotropy. Materials featuring this anisotropy -- and\nespecially the recently studied vanadium compound\n$[{\\mathrm{NH}}_{4}{]}_{2}[{\\mathbf{C}}_{7}{\\mathbf{H}}_{14}\\mathbf{N}][{\\mathbf{V}}_{7}{\\mathbf{O}}_{6}{\\mathbf{F}}_{18}]$\n(DQVOF) -- may thus be very good candidates to realize the much studied kagome\nspin liquid. Further, we closely examine the limit of strong breathing\nanisotropy and find indications of a transition to a nematic phase.\n", "  In this paper we compare experimental observations and theory of radiation\nemission from a microbunched beam with microbunching wavefront tilt with\nrespect to the direction of motion. The theory refers to the work [1], which\npredicts, in this case, exponential suppression of coherent radiation along the\nkicked direction. The observations refer to a recent experiment performed at\nthe LCLS [2,3], where a microbunched beam was kicked by a bend and sent to a\nradiator undulator. The experiment resulted in the emission of strong coherent\nradiation that had its maximum along the kicked direction of motion, when the\nundulator parameter was detuned to a value larger than the nominal one. We\nfirst analyze the theory in detail, and we confirm the correctness of its\nderivation according to the conventional theory of radiation emission from\ncharged particles. Subsequently, we look for possible peculiarities in the\nexperiment, which may not be modeled by the theory. We show that only spurious\neffects are not accounted for. We conclude that the experiment defies\nexplanation in terms of the conventional theory of radiation emission.\n", "  The mathematically sound theory of quantum open systems, formulated in the\n70-ties of XX century and highlighted by the discovery of\nGorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) equation, found a wide range of\napplications in various branches of physics and chemistry, notably in the field\nof quantum information and quantum thermodynamics. However, it took 40 years\nbefore this formalism has been applied to explain correctly the operation\nprinciples of long existing energy transducers like photovoltaic,\nthermoelectric and fuel cells. This long path is briefly reviewed from the\npersonal author's perspective. Finally, the new, fully quantum model of\nchemical engine based on GKLS equation and applicable to fuel cells or\nreplicators is outlined. The model illustrates the difficulty with an entirely\nquantum operational definition of work, comparable to the Problem of Quantum\nMeasurement.\n", "  A study of the localization properties of a single-element Resistive Plate\nWELL (RPWELL) detector is presented. The detector comprises of a single-sided\nTHick Gaseous Electron Multiplier (THGEM) coupled to a segmented readout anode\nthrough a doped silicate-glass plate of 10$^{10}$ $\\Omega\\cdot$cm bulk\nresistivity. Operated in ambient Ne/(5$\\%$CH$_4$) gas, the detector has been\ninvestigated with 150 GeV muons at CERN-SPS. Signals induced through the\nresistive plate on anode readout strips were recorded with APV25/SRS\nelectronics. The experimental results are compared with that of Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The effects of various physics phenomena on the position\nresolution are discussed. The measured position resolution in the present\nconfiguration is 0.28 mm RMS - compatible with the holes-pattern of the\nmultiplier. Possible ways for improving the detector position resolution are\nsuggested.\n", "  Einstein's General theory of relativity is plagued by cosmological and\nblackhole type singularities Recently, it has been shown that infinite\nderivative, ghost free, gravity can yield non-singular cosmological and\nmini-blackhole solutions. In particular, the theory possesses a {\\it mass-gap}\ndetermined by the scale of new physics. We will use this property to argue that\nit is possible to form a non-singular super-massive compact objects without\nhaving any event horizon in this class of theories.\n", "  Irradiating intercalated nanorings by optical vortices ignites a charge flow\nthat emits coherent trains of high harmonic bursts with frequencies and time\nstructures that are controllable by the topological charge of the driving\nvortex beam. Similar to synchrotron radiation, the polarization of emitted\nharmonics is also selectable by tuning to the appropriate emission angle with\nrespect to the ring plane. The nonequilibrium orbital magnetic moment triggered\nin a ring tunnels quantum mechanically to smaller and larger rings leading\nrespectively to high and low-frequency harmonic generation. The frequencies of\nthe emitted harmonics are tunable by simply changing the waist and/or the\nwinding number of the optical vortex, without the need to increase the pulse\nintensity which can lead to material damage. These findings follow from\nfull-fledged quantum dynamic simulations for realistic material and laser\nparameters. The proposed setup is non-destructive as only short vortex pulses\nof moderate intensities are needed, and it offers a versatile tool for\nnanoscale optical and spectroscopic applications such as local, single beam\npump-probe experiments.\n", "  Results are presented from a search for production of Higgs boson pairs (HH)\nwhere one boson decays to a pair of b quarks and the other to a tau lepton\npair. This work is based on proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS\nexperiment at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n18.3 inverse femtobarns. Resonant and nonresonant modes of HH production have\nbeen probed and no significant excess relative to the background-only\nhypotheses has been found in either mode. Upper limits on cross sections of the\ntwo HH production modes have been set. The results have been combined with\npreviously published searches at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, in decay modes to two photons\nand two b quarks, as well as to four b quarks, which also show no evidence for\na signal. Limits from the combination have been set on resonant HH production\nby an unknown particle X in the mass range m[X] = 300 GeV to m[X] = 1000 GeV.\nFor resonant production of spin 0 (spin 2) particles, the observed 95% CL upper\nlimit is 1.13 pb (1.09 pb) at m[X] = 300 GeV and to 21 fb (18 fb) at m[X] =\n1000 GeV. For nonresonant HH production, a limit of 43 times the rate predicted\nby the standard model has been set.\n", "  The unit cell of a chevronic sculptured thin film (ChevSTF) comprises two\nidentical columnar thin films (CTFs) except that the nanocolumns of the first\nare oriented at an angle \\chi and nanocolumns of the second are oriented at an\nangle \\pi-\\chi with respect to the interface of the two CTFs. A ChevSTF\ncontaining 10 unit cells was fabricated using resistive-heating physical vapor\ndeposition of zinc selenide. Planewave reflectance and transmittance spectrums\nof this ChevSTF were measured for a wide variety of incidence conditions over\nthe 500--900-nm range of the free-space wavelength. Despite its structural\nperiodicity, the ChevSTF did not exhibit the Bragg phenomenon. Theoretical\ncalculations with the CTFs modeled as biaxial dielectric materials indicated\nthat the Bragg phenomenon would not be manifested for normal and near-normal\nincidence, but vestigial manifestation was possible for suffciently oblique\nincidence. Thus, structural periodicity does not always lead to electromagnetic\nperiodicity that underlies the exhibition of the Bragg phenomenon.\n", "  We provide novel random surface density functional theory (RSDFT) formulation\nin the case of geometric heterogeneous surface of solid media which is\nessential for description of thermodynamic properties of confined fluids. The\nmajor difference of our theoretical approach from existing ones is stochastic\nmodel of solid surface which takes into account the correlation properties of\ngeometry. The main building blocks are effective fluid-solid potential\ndeveloped in work (J. Stat. Phys, 2017,167(6), 1519-1545) and geometry based\nmodification of Helmholtz free energy for Lennard-Jones fluids. Efficiency of\nRSDFT is demonstrated in calculation of argon and nitrogen low temperature\nadsorption on real heterogeneous surfaces (BP280 carbon black). These results\nare in good agreement with experimental data published in the literature. Also\nseveral models of corrugated materials are developed in the framework of RSDFT.\nNumerical analysis demonstrates strong influence of surface roughness\ncharacteristics on adsorption isotherms. Thus developed formalism provides\nconnection between rigorous description of stochastic surface and confined\nfluids thermodynamics.\n", "  We study the butterfly effect by considering shock wave solutions near the\nhorizon of the AdS black brane in some of 3-dimensional Gravity models\nincluding; 3D Einstein Gravity, Minimal Massive 3D Gravity, New Massive\nGravity, Generalized Massive Gravity, Born-Infeld 3D Gravity and New\nBi-Gravity. We calculate the butterfly velocities of these models and also we\nconsider the critical points and different limits in some of these models. By\nstudying the butterfly effect in the Generalized Massive Gravity, we observe a\ncorrespondence between the butterfly velocities and right-left moving degrees\nof freedom or the central charges of the dual 2D Conformal Field Theories.\n", "  The ability to separate large volumes of mixed species based on atomic mass\nappears desirable for a variety of emerging applications with high societal\nimpact. One possibility to meet this objective consists in leveraging mass\ndifferential effects in rotating plasmas. Beyond conventional centrifugation,\nrotating plasmas offer in principle additional ways to separate elements based\non mass. Single ion orbits show that ion radial mass separation in a uniform\nmagnetized plasma column can be achieved by applying a tailored electric\npotential profile across the column, or by driving a rotating magnetic field\nwithin the column. Furthermore, magnetic pressure and centrifugal effects can\nbe combined in a non-uniform geometry to separate ions based on mass along the\nfield lines. Practical application of these separation schemes hinges on the\nability to produce the desirable electric and magnetic field configuration\nwithin the plasma column.\n", "  The highly forbidden $^2$S$_{1/2} \\rightarrow ^2$F$_{7/2}$ electric octupole\ntransition in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ is a potential candidate for a redefinition of the\nSI second. We present a measurement of the absolute frequency of this optical\ntransition, performed using a frequency link to International Atomic Time to\nprovide traceability to the SI second. The $^{171}$Yb$^+$ optical frequency\nstandard was operated for 76% of a 25-day period, with the absolute frequency\nmeasured to be 642 121 496 772 645.14(26) Hz. The fractional uncertainty of\n$4.0 \\times 10 ^{-16}$ is comparable to that of the best previously reported\nmeasurement, which was made by a direct comparison to local caesium primary\nfrequency standards.\n", "  For stationary interface growth, governed by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nequation in 1 + 1 dimensions, typical fluctuations of the interface height at\nlong times are described by the Baik-Rains distribution. Recently Chhita et al.\n[1] used the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) to study the\nheight fluctuations in systems of the KPZ universality class for Brownian\ninterfaces with arbitrary diffusion constant. They showed that there is a\none-parameter family of long-time distributions, parametrized by the diffusion\nconstant of the initial random height profile. They also computed these\ndistributions numerically by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Here we\naddress this problem analytically and focus on the distribution tails at short\ntimes. We determine the (stretched exponential) tails of the height\ndistribution by applying the Optimal Fluctuation Method (OFM) to the KPZ\nequation. We argue that, by analogy with other initial conditions, the \"slow\"\ntail holds at arbitrary times and therefore provides a proper asymptotic to the\nfamily of long-time distributions studied in Ref. [1]. We verify this\nhypothesis by performing large-scale MC simulations of a TASEP with a\nparallel-update rule. The \"fast\" tail, predicted by the OFM, is also expected\nto hold at arbitrary times, at sufficiently large heights.\n", "  We present a new strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS\nJ1206.2-0847 (MACS 1206), at z=0.44, using deep spectroscopy from CLASH-VLT and\nVLT/MUSE archival data in combination with imaging from the Cluster Lensing and\nSupernova survey with Hubble. MUSE observations enable the spectroscopic\nidentification of 23 new multiply imaged sources, extending the previous\ncompilations by a factor of approximately five. In total, we use the positional\nmeasurements of 82 spectroscopic multiple images belonging to 27 families at\nz=1.0-6.1 to reconstruct the projected total mass distribution of MACS 1206.\nRemarkably, 11 multiple images are found within 50 kpc of the brightest cluster\ngalaxy, making this an unprecedented set of constraints for the innermost\nprojected mass distribution of a galaxy cluster. We thus find that, although\ndynamically relaxed, the smooth matter component (dark matter plus hot gas) of\nMACS 1206 shows a significant asymmetry, which closely follows the asymmetric\ndistribution of the stellar component (galaxy members and intracluster light).\nWe determine the value of the innermost logarithmic slope of the projected\ntotal mass density profile and find it to be close to the canonical\nNavarro-Frenk-White value. We demonstrate that this quantity is very robust\nagainst different parametrizations of the diffuse mass component; however, this\nis not the case when only one central image is used in the mass reconstruction.\nWe also show that the mass density profile from our new strong lensing model is\nin very good agreement with dynamical and X-ray measurements at larger radii,\nwhere they overlap.\n", "  We show that the large-charge formalism can be successfully applied to models\nthat go beyond the vector models discussed so far in the literature. We study\nthe explicit example of a conformal $SU(3)$ matrix model in 2+1 space-time\ndimensions at fixed charge and calculate the anomalous dimension and fusion\ncoefficients at leading order in the $U(1)$ charge.\n", "  The detailed distribution and kinematics of the atomic and the CO-bright\nmolecular hydrogen in the disc of the Milky Way inside the Solar circle are\nderived under the assumptions of axisymmetry and pure circular motions. We\ndivide the Galactic disc into a series of rings, and assume that the gas in\neach ring is described by four parameters: its rotation velocity, velocity\ndispersion, midplane density and its scale height. We fit these parameters to\nthe Galactic HI and CO (J=1-0) data by producing artificial HI and CO\nline-profiles and comparing them with the observations. Our approach allows us\nto fit all parameters to the data simultaneously without assuming a-priori a\nradial profile for one of the parameters. We present the distribution and\nkinematics of the HI and H2 in both the approaching (QIV) and the receding (QI)\nregions of the Galaxy. Our best-fit models reproduces remarkably well the\nobserved HI and CO longitude-velocity diagrams up to a few degrees of distance\nfrom the midplane. With the exception of the innermost 2.5 kpc, QI and QIV show\nvery similar kinematics. The rotation curves traced by the HI and H2 follow\nclosely each other, flattening beyond R=6.5 kpc. Both the HI and the H2 surface\ndensities show a) a deep depression at 0.5<R<2.5 kpc, analogous to that shown\nby some nearby barred galaxies, b) local overdensities that can be interpreted\nin terms of spiral arms or ring-like features in the disk. The HI (H2)\nproperties are fairly constant in the region outside the depression, with\ntypical velocity dispersion of 8.9+/-1.1 (4.4+/-1.2) km/s, density of\n0.43+/-0.11 (0.42+/-0.22) cm-3 and HWHM scale height of 202+/-28 (64+/-12) pc.\nWe also show that the HI opacity in the LAB data can be accounted for by using\nan `effective' spin temperature of about 150 K: assuming an optically thin\nregime leads to underestimate the HI mass by about 30%.\n", "  Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) provides three-dimensional refractive\nindex (RI) tomograms of a transparent microscopic object. However, because of\nthe finite numerical aperture of objective lenses, ODT has the limited access\nto diffracted light and suffers from poor spatial resolution, particularly\nalong the axial direction. To overcome the limitation of the quality of RI\ntomography, we present an algorithm that accurately reconstructs RI tomography\nusing preliminary information that the RI values of a specimen are discrete and\nuniform. Through simulations and experiments on various samples, including\nmicrospheres, red blood cells, and water droplets, we show that the proposed\nmethod can precisely reconstruct RI tomograms of samples with discrete and\nuniform RI values in the presence of the missing information and noise.\n", "  Given a matrix Lie algebra one can construct the 3-Lie algebra by means of\nthe trace of a matrix. In the present paper we show that this approach can be\nextended to the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields on a manifold\nif instead of the trace of a matrix we consider a differential 1-form which\nsatisfies certain conditions. Then we show that the same approach can be\nextended to matrix Lie superalgebras if instead of the trace of a matrix we\nmake use of the super trace of a matrix. It is proved that a graded triple\ncommutator of matrices constructed with the help of the graded commutator and\nthe super trace satisfies a graded ternary Filippov-Jacobi identity. In two\nparticular cases and we show that the Pauli and Dirac matrices generate the\nmatrix 3-Lie superalgebras, and we find the non-trivial graded triple\ncommutators of these algebras. We propose a Clifford algebra approach to 3-Lie\nsuperalgebras induced by Lie superalgebras. We also discuss an application of\nmatrix 3-Lie superalgebras in BRST-formalism.\n", "  Short-duration GRBs with extended emission form a subclass of short GRBs,\ncomprising about 15% of the short-duration sample. Afterglow detections of\nshort GRBs are also rare (about 30%) due to their smaller luminosity. We\npresent a multi-band data set of the short burst with extended emission GRB\n150424A, comprising of GROND observations, complemented with data from\nSwift/UVOT, Swift/XRT, HST, Keck/LRIS and data points from the literature. The\nGRB 150424A afterglow shows an extended plateau phase, lasting about 8hrs. The\nanalysis of this unique GRB afterglow might shed light on the understanding of\nafterglow plateau emission, the nature of which is still under debate.\n  We present a phenomenological analysis by applying fireball closure\nrelations, and interpret the findings in the context of the fireball model. We\ndiscuss the plausibility of a magnetar as a central engine, being responsible\nfor additional and prolonged energy injection into the fireball.\n  We find convincing evidence for energy injection into the afterglow of GRB\n150424A. We find that a magnetar spin down as source for a prolonged energy\ninjection requires that at least 4% of the spin-down energy is converted to\nradiation.\n", "  We show that a generic single-orbital Anderson impurity model, lacking for\ninstance any kind of particle-hole symmetry, can be exactly mapped without any\nconstraint onto a resonant level model coupled to two Ising variables, which\nreduce to one if the hybridisation is particle-hole symmetric. The mean-field\nsolution of this model is found to be stable to unphysical spontaneous\nmagnetisation of the impurity, unlike the saddle-point solution in the standard\nslave-boson representation. Remarkably, the mean-field estimate of the Wilson\nratio approaches the exact value $R_\\text{W}=2$ in the Kondo regime.\n", "  Strongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMPs) have recently been proposed as\nlight thermal dark matter relics. Here we consider an explicit realization of\nthe SIMP mechanism in the form of vector SIMPs arising from an $SU(2)_X$ hidden\ngauge theory, where the accidental custodial symmetry protects the stability of\nthe dark matter. We propose several ways of equilibrating the dark and visible\nsectors in this setup. In particular, we show that a light dark Higgs portal\ncan maintain thermal equilibrium between the two sectors, as can a massive dark\nvector portal with its generalized Chern-Simons couplings to the vector SIMPs,\nall while remaining consistent with experimental constraints.\n", "  We study the anomalous Nernst and thermal Hall effects in a linearized\nlow-energy model of a tilted Weyl semimetal, with two Weyl nodes separated in\nmomentum space. For inversion symmetric tilt, we give analytic expressions in\ntwo opposite limits: for a small tilt, corresponding to a type-I Weyl\nsemimetal, the Nernst conductivity is finite and independent of the Fermi\nlevel, while for a large tilt, corresponding to a type-II Weyl semimetal, it\nacquires a contribution depending logarithmically on the Fermi energy. This\nresult is in a sharp contrast to the nontilted case, where the Nernst response\nis known to be zero in the linear model. The thermal Hall conductivity\nsimilarly acquires Fermi surface contributions, which add to the Fermi level\nindependent, zero tilt result, and is suppressed as one over the tilt parameter\nat half filling in the Type-II phase. In the case of inversion breaking tilt,\nwith the tilting vector of equal modulus in the two Weyl cones, all Fermi\nsurface contributions to both anomalous responses cancel out, resulting in zero\nNernst conductivity. We discuss two possible experimental setups, representing\nopen and closed thermoelectric circuits.\n", "  We examine magnetotransport in a holographic Dirac-Born-Infeld model, taking\ninto account the effects of backreaction on the geometry. The theory we\nconsider includes axionic scalars, introduced to break translational symmetry\nand generate momentum dissipation. The generic structure of the DC conductivity\nmatrix for these theories is extremely rich, and is significantly more complex\nthan that obtained in the probe approximation. We find new classes of black\nbrane solutions, including geometries that exhibit Lifshitz scaling and\nhyperscaling violation, and examine their implications on the transport\nproperties of the system. Depending on the choice of theory parameters, these\nbackgrounds can lead to metallic or insulating behavior. Negative\nmagnetoresistance is observed in a family of dynoic solutions. Some of the new\nbackreacted geometries also support magnetic-field-induced metal-insulator\ntransitions.\n", "  We consider multi-variable reductions of the dispersionless DKP hierarchy\n(the dispersionless limit of the Pfaff lattice) in the elliptic\nparametrization. The reduction is given by a system of elliptic L\\\"owner\nequations supplemented by a system of partial differential equations of\nhydrodynamic type. The compatibility conditions for the elliptic L\\\"owner\nequations are derived. They are elliptic analogues of the Gibbons-Tsarev\nequations. We prove solvability of the hydrodynamic type system by means of the\ngeneralized hodograph method. The associated diagonal metric is proved to be of\nthe Egorov type.\n", "  We use the rotation-invariant Green's function method (RGM) and the\nhigh-temperature expansion (HTE) to study the thermodynamic properties of the\nspin-$S$ Heisenberg ferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice. We examine the\nexcitation spectra as well as various thermodynamic quantities, such as the\norder parameter (magnetization), the uniform static susceptibility, the\ncorrelation length, the spin-spin correlations, and the specific heat, as well\nas the static and dynamic structure factors. We discuss the influence of the\nspin quantum number $S$ on the temperature dependence of these quantities. We\ncompare our results for the pyrochlore ferromagnet with the corresponding ones\nfor the simple-cubic lattice both having the same coordination number $z=6$. We\nfind a significant suppression of magnetic ordering for the pyrochlore lattice\ndue to its geometry with corner-sharing tetrahedra.\n", "  We discuss the effect of small perturbation on nodeless solutions of the\nnonlinear \\Schrodinger\\ equation in 1+1 dimensions in an external complex\npotential derivable from a parity-time symmetric superpotential that was\nconsidered earlier [Phys.~Rev.~E 92, 042901 (2015)]. In particular we consider\nthe nonlinear partial differential equation $\\{ \\, \\rmi \\, \\partial_t +\n\\partial_x^2 + g |\\psi(x,t)|^2 - V^{+}(x) \\, \\} \\, \\psi(x,t) = 0$, where\n$V^{+}(x) = \\qty( -b^2 - m^2 + 1/4 ) \\, \\sech^2(x) - 2 i \\, m \\, b \\, \\sech(x)\n\\, \\tanh(x)$ represents the complex potential. Here we study the perturbations\nas a function of $b$ and $m$ using a variational approximation based on a\ndissipation functional formalism. We compare the result of this variational\napproach with direct numerical simulation of the equations. We find that the\nvariational approximation works quite well at small and moderate values of the\nparameter $b m$ which controls the strength of the imaginary part of the\npotential. We also show that the dissipation functional formalism is equivalent\nto the generalized traveling wave method for this type of dissipation.\n", "  In this paper, we study an SYK model and an SYK-like tensor model with global\nsymmetry. First, we study the large $N$ expansion of the bi-local collective\naction for the SYK model with manifest global symmetry. We show that the global\nsymmetry is enhanced to a local symmetry at strong coupling limit, and the\ncorresponding symmetry algebra is the Kac-Moody algebra. The emergent local\nsymmetry together with the emergent reparametrization is spontaneously and\nexplicit broken. This leads to a low energy effective action. We evaluate four\npoint functions, and obtain spectrum of our model. We derive the low energy\neffective action and analyze the chaotic behavior of the four point functions.\nWe also consider the recent 3D gravity conjecture for our model.\n  We also introduce an SYK-like tensor model with global symmetry. We first\nstudy chaotic behavior of four point functions in various channels for the\nrank-3 case, and generalize this into a rank-$(q-1)$ tensor model.\n", "  Aims. HD166734 is an eccentric eclipsing binary system composed of two\nsupergiant O-type stars, orbiting with a 34.5-day period. In this rare\nconfiguration for such stars, the two objects mainly evolve independently,\nfollowing single-star evolution so far. This system provides a chance to study\nthe individual parameters of two supergiant massive stars and to derive their\nreal masses. Methods. An intensive monitoring was dedicated to HD166734.We\nanalyzed mid- and high-resolution optical spectra to constrain the orbital\nparameters of this system. We also studied its light curve for the first time,\nobtained in the VRI filters. Finally, we disentangled the spectra of the two\nstars and modeled them with the CMFGEN atmosphere code in order to determine\nthe individual physical parameters. Results. HD166734 is a O7.5If+O9I(f)\nbinary. We confirm its orbital period but we revise the other orbital\nparameters. In comparison to what we found in the literature, the system is\nmore eccentric and, now, the hottest and the most luminous component is also\nthe most massive one. The light curve exhibits only one eclipse and its\nanalysis indicates an inclination of 63.0{\\deg} $\\pm$ 2.7{\\deg}. The\nphotometric analysis provides us with a good estimation of the luminosities of\nthe stars, and therefore their exact positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram. The evolutionary and the spectroscopic masses show good agreement with\nthe dynamical masses of 39.5 Msun for the primary and 33.5 Msun for the\nsecondary, within the uncertainties. The two components are both enriched in\nhelium and in nitrogen and depleted in carbon. In addition, the primary also\nshows a depletion in oxygen. Their surface abundances are however not different\nfrom those derived from single supergiant stars, yielding, for both components,\nan evolution similar to that of single stars.\n", "  In an attempt to develop a streamlined astrophotonic instrument, we\ndemonstrate the realization of an all-photonic device capable of both multimode\nto single mode conversion and spectral dispersion on an 8-m class telescope\nwith efficient coupling. The device was a monolithic photonic spectrograph\nwhich combined an integrated photonic lantern, and an efficient arrayed\nwaveguide grating device. During on-sky testing, we discovered a previously\nunreported type of noise that made spectral extraction and calibration\nextremely difficult. The source of the noise was traced to a\nwavelength-dependent loss mechanism between the feed fiber's multimode\nnear-field pattern, and the modal acceptance profile of the integrated photonic\nlantern. Extensive modeling of the photonic components replicates the\nwavelength-dependent loss, and demonstrates an identical effect on the final\nspectral output. We outline that this could be mitigated by directly injecting\ninto the integrated photonic lantern.\n", "  We derive the three-body quantization condition in a finite volume using an\neffective field theory in the particle-dimer picture. Moreover, we consider the\nextraction of physical observables from the lattice spectrum using the\nquantization condition. To illustrate the general framework, we calculate the\nvolume-dependent three-particle spectrum in a simple model both below and above\nthe three-particle threshold. The relation to existing approaches is discussed\nin detail.\n", "  We study the output entanglement in a three-mode optomechanical system via\nreservoir engineering by shifting the center frequency of filter function away\nfrom resonant frequency. We find the bandwidth of the filter function can\nsuppress the entanglement in the vicinity of resonant frequency of the system,\nwhile the entanglement will become prosperous if the center frequency departs\nfrom the resonant frequency. We obtain the approximate analytical expressions\nof the output entanglement, and from which we give the optimal center frequency\nat which the entanglement takes the maximum. Furthermore, we study the effects\nof time delay between the two output fields on the output entanglement, and\nobtain the optimal time delay for the case of large filter bandwidth.\n", "  Using highly controlled coverages of graphene on SiC(0001), we have studied\nthe structure of the first graphene layer that grows on the SiC interface. This\nlayer, known as the buffer layer, is semiconducting. Using x-ray reflectivity\nand x-ray standing waves analysis we have performed a comparative study of the\nbuffer layer structure with and without an additional monolayer graphene layer\nabove it. We show that no more than 26\\% of the buffer carbon is covalently\nbonded to Si in the SiC interface. We also show that the top SiC bilayer is Si\ndepleted and is the likely the cause of the incommensuration previously\nobserved in this system. When a monolayer graphene layer forms above the\nbuffer, the buffer layer becomes less corrugated with signs of a change in the\nbonding geometry with the SiC interface. At the same time, the entire SiC\ninterface becomes more disordered, presumably due to entropy associated with\nthe higher growth temperature.\n", "  Models of Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM) with a sufficiently attractive and\nlong-range force gives rise to stable bound objects, analogous to nuclei in the\nStandard Model, called nuggets. We study the properties of these nuggets and\ncompute their profiles and binding energies. Our approach, applicable to both\nelementary and composite fermionic ADM, utilizes relativistic mean field\ntheory, and allows a more systematic computation of nugget properties, over a\nwider range of sizes and force mediator masses, compared to previous\nliterature. We identify three separate regimes of nugget property behavior\ncorresponding to (1) non-relativistic and (2) relativistic constituents in a\nCoulomb-like limit, and (3) saturation in an anti-Coulomb limit when the\nnuggets are large compared to the force range. We provide analytical\ndescriptions for nuggets in each regime. Through numerical calculations, we are\nable to confirm our analytic descriptions and also obtain smooth transitions\nfor the nugget profiles between all three regimes. We also find that over a\nwide range of parameter space, the binding energy in the saturation limit is an\n${\\cal O}(1)$ fraction of the constituent's mass, significantly larger than\nexpectations in the non-relativistic case. In a companion paper, we apply our\nresults to synthesis of ADM nuggets in the early Universe.\n", "  The modulational instability of dust-acoustic (DA) waves (DAWs), and\ncorresponding DA rogue waves (DARWs) in a realistic space dusty plasma system\n(containing inertial warm positively and negatively charged dust, isothermal\nions, and nonthermal kappa distributed electrons) has been theoretically\ninvestigated. The nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation is derived by using\nreductive perturbation method for this investigation. It is observed that the\ndusty plasma system under consideration supports two modes, namely fast and\nslow modes, and that both of these two modes can be stable or unstable\ndepending the sign of ratio of the dispersive and nonlinear coefficients. The\nnumerical analysis have shown that the basic features (viz.\nstability/instabilit, growth rate, amplitude, etc.) of the DAWs associated with\nthe fast mode are significantly modified by superthermal parameter ($\\kappa$)\nand other various plasma parameters. The results of our present investigation\nshould be useful for understanding DARWs in space plasma systems, viz.\nmesosphere and ionospehre.\n", "  Magnetic interactions are widely believed to play a crucial role in the\nmicroscopic mechanism leading to high critical temperature superconductivity.\nIt is therefore important to study the signatures of pairing in the magnetic\nexcitation spectrum of simple models known to show unconventional\nsuperconducting tendencies. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group\ntechnique, we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor $S({\\bf k},\\omega)$\nof a generalized $t-U-J$ Hubbard model away from half-filling in a two-leg\nladder geometry. The addition of $J$ enhances pairing tendencies. We analyze\nquantitatively the signatures of pairing in the magnetic excitation spectra. We\nfound that the superconducting pair-correlation strength, that can be estimated\nindependently from ground state properties, is closely correlated with the\nintegrated low-energy magnetic spectral weight in the vicinity of $(\\pi,\\pi)$.\nIn this wave-vector region, robust spin incommensurate features develop with\nincreasing doping. The branch of the spectrum with rung direction wave-vector\n$k_{rung}=0$ does not change substantially with doping where pairing dominates,\nand thus plays a minor role. We discuss the implications of our results for\nneutron scattering experiments, where the spin excitation dynamics of\nhole-doped quasi-one dimensional magnetic materials can be measured, and also\naddress implications for recent resonant inelastic X-ray scattering\nexperiments.\n", "  The dependence of multi-proton correlation functions and cumulants on the\nacceptance in rapidity and transverse momentum is studied. We find that the\npreliminary data of various cumulant ratios are consistent, within errors, with\nrapidity and transverse momentum independent correlation functions. However,\nrapidity correlations which moderately increase with rapidity separation\nbetween protons are slightly favored. We propose to further explore the\nrapidity dependence of multi-particle correlation functions by measuring the\ndependence of the integrated reduced correlation functions as a function of the\nsize of the rapidity window.\n", "  The Real Compton Scattering in ultraperipheral $pPb$ collisions at RHIC and\nLHC energies is investigated and predictions for the squared transverse\nmomentum ($t$) and rapidity ($Y$) distributions are presented. The scattering\namplitude is assumed to be given by the sum of the Reggeon and Pomeron\ncontributions and the Pomeron one is described by the Color Dipole formalism\ntaking into account the non - linear (saturation) effects in the QCD dynamics.\nWe demonstrate that the behaviour of the cross sections at large -- $t$ and/or\n$Y$ is dominated by the Pomeron contribution and is strongly affected by the\nnon -- linear effects present in the QCD dynamics. These results indicate that\na future experimental analysis of this process can be useful to probe the QCD\ndynamics at high energies.\n", "  Strong collisional shocks in multi-ion plasmas are featured in many\nhigh-energy-density environments, including Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF)\nimplosions. However, their basic structure and its dependence on key parameters\n(e.g., the Mach number and the plasma ion composition) are poorly understood,\nand controversies in that regard remain in the literature. Using a\nhigh-fidelity Vlasov-Fokker-Planck code, iFP, and direct comparisons to\nmulti-ion hydrodynamic simulations and semi-analytic predictions, we critically\nexamine steady-state planar shocks in D-3He plasmas and put forward a\nresolution to these controversies.\n", "  An interesting result in particle astrophysics is the recent detection of an\nunexplained 3.5 keV line from galaxy clusters. A promising model, which can\nexplain the morphology of the signal and its non-observation in dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, involves a 7 keV dark matter particle decaying into a pair\nof ultra-light axions that convert into photons in the magnetic field of the\nclusters. Given that light axions emerge naturally in 4D string vacua, in this\npaper we present a microscopic realisation of this model within the framework\nof type IIB flux compactifications. Dark matter is a local closed string axion\nwhich develops a tiny mass due to subdominant poly-instanton corrections to the\nsuperpotential and couples via kinetic mixing to an almost massless open string\naxion living on a D3-brane at a singularity. The interaction of this\nultra-light axion with photons is induced by U(1) kinetic mixing. After\ndescribing the Calabi-Yau geometry and the brane set-up, we discuss in depth\nmoduli stabilisation, the resulting mass spectrum and the strength of all\nrelevant couplings.\n", "  The work is devoted to constructing a wide class of differential-functional\ndynamical systems, whose rich algebraic structure makes their integrability\nanalytically effective. In particular, there is analyzed in detail the operator\nLax type equations for factorized seed elements, there is proved an important\ntheorem about their operator factorization and the related analytical solution\nscheme to the corresponding nonlinear differential-functional dynamical\nsystems.\n", "  We present a lattice calculation of the Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP)\ncontribution of the strange and charm quarks to the anomalous magnetic moment\nof the muon including leading-order electromagnetic corrections. We employ the\ngauge configurations generated by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration\n(ETMC) with $N_f = 2+1+1$ dynamical quarks at three values of the lattice\nspacing ($a \\simeq 0.062, 0.082, 0.089$ fm) with pion masses in the range\n$M_\\pi \\simeq 210 - 450$ MeV. The strange and charm quark masses are tuned at\ntheir physical values. Neglecting disconnected diagrams and after the\nextrapolations to the physical pion mass and to the continuum limit we obtain:\n$a_\\mu^s(\\alpha_{em}^2) = (53.1 \\pm 2.5) \\cdot 10^{-10}$,\n$a_\\mu^s(\\alpha_{em}^3) = (-0.018 \\pm 0.011) \\cdot 10^{-10}$ and\n$a_\\mu^c(\\alpha_{em}^2) = (14.75 \\pm 0.56) \\cdot 10^{-10}$,\n$a_\\mu^c(\\alpha_{em}^3) = (-0.030 \\pm 0.013) \\cdot 10^{-10}$ for the strange\nand charm contributions, respectively.\n", "  We have built a variable temperature scanning probe microscope (SPM) that\ncovers 4.6 K - 180 K and up to 7 Tesla whose SPM head fits in a 52 mm bore\nmagnet. It features a temperature-controlled sample stage thermally well\nisolated from the SPM body in good thermal contact with the liquid helium bath.\nIt has a 7 sample holder storage carousel at liquid helium temperature for\nsystematic studies using multiple samples and field emission targets intended\nfor spin-polarized spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nstudy on samples with various compositions and doping conditions. The system is\nequipped with a UHV sample preparation chamber and mounted on a two-stage\nvibration isolation system made of a heavy concrete block and a granite table\non pneumatic vibration isolators. A quartz resonator (qPlus) based non-contact\natomic force microscope (AFM) sensor is used for simultaneous STM/AFM operation\nfor research on samples with highly insulating properties such as strongly\nunderdoped cuprates and strongly correlated electron systems.\n", "  A novel technique for polarization-multiplexing ghost imaging is proposed to\nsimultaneously obtain multiple polarimetric information by a single detector.\nHere, polarization-division multiplexing speckles are employed for object\nillumination. The light reflected from the objects is detected by a\nsingle-pixel detector. An iterative reconstruction method is used to restore\nthe fused image containing the different polarimetric information by summing\nthe multiplexed speckles and detected intensities. Next, clear images of the\ndifferent polarimetric information are recovered by demultiplexing the fused\nimage. The application of this method to the detection of two different\npolarized objects is presented, and the results clearly demonstrate that the\nproposed method is effective. An encryption experiment for polarimetric\ninformation is also performed by setting the multiplexed speckles' encoding as\nthe keys.\n", "  A model consisting in two quantum XX spin chains, one homogeneous and the\nsecond with random couplings drawn from a binary distribution, is considered.\nThe two chains are coupled to two different non-local thermal baths and their\ndynamics is governed by a Lindblad equation. In the steady state, a current J\nis induced between the two chains by coupling them together by their edges and\nimposing different chemical potentials $\\mu$ to the two baths. While a regime\nof linear characteristics J versus $\\Delta$$\\mu$ is observed in the absence of\nrandomness, a gap opens as the disorder strength is increased. In the\ninfinite-randomness limit, this behavior is related to the density of states of\nthe localized states contributing to the current. The conductance is shown to\ndiverge in this limit.\n", "  Measurement induced nonlocality (MIN) captures global nonlocal effect of\nbipartite quantum state due to locally invariant projective measurements. In\nthis paper, we propose a new version of MIN using fidelity induced\nmetric,andthe same is calculated for pure and mixed states. For mixed state,\nthe upper bound is obtained from eigenvalues of correlation matrix. Further,\ndynamics of MIN and fidelity based MIN under various noisy quantum channels\nshow that they are more robust than entanglement.\n", "  We report on the first measurement of the beam-spin asymmetry in the\nexclusive process of coherent deeply virtual Compton scattering off a nucleus.\nThe experiment used the 6 GeV electron beam from the CEBAF accelerator at\nJefferson Lab incident on a pressurized $^4$He gaseous target placed in front\nof the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). The scattered electron was\ndetected by CLAS and the photon by a dedicated electromagnetic calorimeter at\nforward angles. To ensure the exclusivity of the process, a specially designed\nradial time projection chamber was used to detect the recoiling $^4$He nuclei.\nWe measured beam-spin asymmetries larger than those observed on the free proton\nin the same kinematic domain. From these, we were able to extract, in a\nmodel-independent way, the real and imaginary parts of the only $^4$He Compton\nform factor, $\\cal H_A$. This first measurement of coherent deeply virtual\nCompton scattering on the $^4$He nucleus, with a fully exclusive final state\nvia nuclear recoil tagging, leads the way toward 3D imaging of the partonic\nstructure of nuclei.\n", "  We present an action for chiral $N=(1,0)$ supergravity in $2+2$ dimensions.\nThe fields of the theory are organized into an $OSp(1|4)$ connection\nsupermatrix, and are given by the usual vierbein $V^a$, spin connection\n$\\omega^{ab}$, and Majorana gravitino $\\psi$. In analogy with a construction\nused for $D=10+2$ gauge supergravity, the action is given by $\\int STr ({\\bf\nR}^2 {\\bf \\Gamma})$, where ${\\bf R}$ is the $OSp(1|4)$ curvature supermatrix\ntwo-form, and ${\\bf \\Gamma}$ a constant supermatrix containing $\\gamma_5$. It\nis similar, but not identical to the MacDowell-Mansouri action for $D=2+2$\nsupergravity. The constant supermatrix breaks $OSp(1|4)$ gauge invariance to a\nsubalgebra $OSp(1|2) \\oplus Sp(2)$, including a Majorana-Weyl supercharge. Thus\nhalf of the $OSp(1|4)$ gauge supersymmetry survives. The gauge fields are the\nselfdual part of $\\omega^{ab}$ and the Weyl projection of $\\psi$ for\n$OSp(1|2)$, and the antiselfdual part of $\\omega^{ab}$ for $Sp(2)$.\nSupersymmetry transformations, being part of a gauge superalgebra, close\noff-shell. The selfduality condition on the spin connection can be consistently\nimposed, and the resulting \"projected\" action is $OSp(1|2)$ gauge invariant.\n", "  Vibrationally resolved electronic absorption spectra including the effect of\nvibrational pre-excitation are computed in order to interpret and predict\nvibronic transitions that are probed in the Vibrationally Promoted Electronic\nResonance (VIPER) experiment [L. J. G. W. van Wilderen et al., Angew. Chem.\nInt. Ed. 53, 2667 (2014)]. To this end, we employ time-independent and\ntime-dependent methods based on the evaluation of Franck-Condon overlap\nintegrals and Fourier transformation of time-domain wavepacket autocorrelation\nfunctions, respectively. The time-independent approach uses a generalized\nversion of the FCclasses method [F. Santoro et al., J. Chem. Phys. 126, 084509\n(2007)]. In the time-dependent approach, autocorrelation functions are obtained\nby wavepacket propagation and by evaluation of analytic expressions, within the\nharmonic approximation including Duschinsky rotation effects. For several\nmedium-sized polyatomic systems, it is shown that selective pre-excitation of\nparticular vibrational modes leads to a red-shift of the low-frequency edge of\nthe electronic absorption spectrum, which is a prerequisite for the VIPER\nexperiment. This effect is typically most pronounced upon excitation of ring\ndistortion modes within an aromatic pi-system. Theoretical predictions as to\nwhich modes show the strongest VIPER effect are found to be in excellent\nagreement with experiment.\n", "  Majorana Josephson junctions in nanowire systems exhibit a pseudo-$4\\pi$\nperiod current-phase relation in the clean limit. In this work, we study how\nthis current-phase relation responds to a tilted magnetic field in a disordered\nMajorana Josephson junction within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. We show\nthat the tilted magnetic field induces a $\\phi_0$ phase shift to the\ncurrent-phase relation. Most importantly, we find that this $\\phi_0$-junction\nbehavior is robust even in the presence of disorders.\n", "  The large hierarchy between the Planck scale and the weak scale can be\nexplained by the dynamical breaking of supersymmetry in strongly coupled gauge\ntheories. Similarly, the hierarchy between the Planck scale and the energy\nscale of inflation may also originate from strong dynamics, which dynamically\ngenerate the inflaton potential. We present a model of the hidden sector which\nunifies these two ideas, i.e., in which the scales of inflation and\nsupersymmetry breaking are provided by the dynamics of the same gauge group.\nThe resultant inflation model is chaotic inflation with a fractional power-law\npotential in accord with the upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The\nsupersymmetry breaking scale can be much smaller than the inflation scale, so\nthat the solution to the large hierarchy problem of the weak scale remains\nintact. As an intrinsic feature of our model, we find that the sgoldstino,\nwhich might disturb the inflationary dynamics, is automatically stabilized\nduring inflation by dynamically generated corrections in the strongly coupled\nsector. This renders our model a field-theoretical realization of what is\nsometimes referred to as sgoldstino-less inflation.\n", "  We study the dynamical thermal conductivity of the two-dimensional Kitaev\nspin-model on the honeycomb lattice. We find a strongly temperature dependent\nlow-frequency spectral intensity as a direct consequence of fractionalization\nof spins into mobile Majorana matter and a static $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ gauge field.\nThe latter acts as an emergent thermally activated disorder, leading to the\nappearance of a pseudogap which partially closes in the thermodynamic limit,\nindicating a dissipative heat conductor. Our analysis is based on complementary\ncalculations of the current correlation function, comprising exact\ndiagonalization by means of a complete summation over all gauge sectors, as\nwell as a phenomenological mean-field treatment of thermal gauge fluctuations,\nvalid at intermediate and high temperatures. The results will also be\ncontrasted against the conductivity discarding gauge fluctuations.\n", "  We construct and study stationary, asymptotically flat multicenter solutions\ndescribing regular black holes with non-Abelian hair (colored magnetic-monopole\nand dyon fields) in two models of $\\mathcal{N}=2,d=4$ Super-Einstein-Yang-Mills\ntheories: the quadratic model $\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}}^{3}$ and the cubic model\nST$[2,6]$, which can be embedded in 10-dimensional Heterotic Supergravity.\nThese solutions are based on the multicenter dyon recently discovered by one of\nus, which solves the SU$(2)$ Bogomol'nyi and dyon equations on\n$\\mathbb{E}^{3}$. In contrast to the well-known Abelian multicenter solutions,\nthe relative positions of the non-Abelian black hole centers are unconstrained.\n  We study necessary conditions on the parameters of the solutions that ensure\nthe regularity of the metric. In the case of the $\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}}^{3}$\nmodel we show that it is enough to require the positivity of the \"masses\" of\nthe individual black holes, the finiteness of each of their entropies and their\nsuperadditivity. In the case of the $ST[2,6]$ model we have not been able to\nshow that analogous conditions are sufficient, but we give an explicit example\nof a regular solution describing thousands of non-Abelian dyonic black holes in\nequilibrium at arbitrary relative positions.\n  We also construct non-Abelian solutions that interpolate smoothly between\njust two aDS$_{2}\\times$S$^{2}$ vacua with different radii (dumbbell\nsolutions).\n", "  We use the generator-coordinate method with realistic shell-model\ninteractions to closely approximate full shell-model calculations of the matrix\nelements for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{48}$Ca, $^{76}$Ge, and\n$^{82}$Se. We work in one major shell for the first isotope, in the\n$f_{5/2}pg_{9/2}$ space for the second and third, and finally in two major\nshells for all three. Our coordinates include not only the usual axial\ndeformation parameter $\\beta$, but also the triaxiality angle $\\gamma$ and\nneutron-proton pairing amplitudes. In the smaller model spaces our matrix\nelements agree well with those of full shell-model diagonalization, suggesting\nthat our Hamiltonian-based GCM captures most of the important valence-space\ncorrelations. In two major shells, where exact diagonalization is not currently\npossible, our matrix elements are only slightly different from those in a\nsingle shell.\n", "  Paraxial linear propagation of light in an optical waveguide with material\ngain and loss is governed by a Schr\\\"odinger equation with a complex potential.\nProperties of parity-time-symmetric complex potentials have been heavily\nstudied before. In this article, new classes of non-parity-time-symmetric\ncomplex potentials featuring conjugate-pair eigenvalue symmetry in its spectrum\nare constructed by operator symmetry methods. Due to this eigenvalue symmetry,\nit is shown that the spectrum of these complex potentials is often all-real.\nUnder parameter tuning in these potentials, phase transition can also occur,\nwhere pairs of complex eigenvalues appear in the spectrum. A peculiar feature\nof the phase transition here is that, the complex eigenvalues may bifurcate out\nfrom an interior continuous eigenvalue inside the continuous spectrum, in which\ncase a phase transition takes place without going through an exceptional point.\nIn one spatial dimension, this class of non-parity-time-symmetric complex\npotentials is of the form $V(x)=h'(x)-h^2(x)$, where $h(x)$ is an arbitrary\nparity-time-symmetric complex function. These potentials in two spatial\ndimensions are also derived. Diffraction patterns in these complex potentials\nare further examined, and unidirectional propagation behaviors are\ndemonstrated.\n", "  We provide an overview of recent determinations of the strong coupling,\n$\\alpha_s$, from hadronic $\\tau$ decays. We contrast two analysis methods, the\n\"truncated-OPE approach\" and the \"DV-model approach,\" highlighting the\nassumptions going into each of these. We argue that a detailed study based on\nALEPH data shows the truncated-OPE approach to be quantitatively unreliable,\nwhile the DV-model approach passes all tests. New data for hadronic $\\tau$\ndecays from Belle and Belle-II could provide more stringent tests of the\nDV-model approach, and thus potentially lead to a more precise value of\n$\\alpha_s$ from hadronic $\\tau$ decays.\n", "  An absorption of a weak pulse by two identical atoms moving in a trap is\ninvestigated. Based on atom-light interactions we present a microscopic model\nof a two-body wave function diagnosis. We study the influence of pulse\nproperties on the results. We show that a pulse duration impact a resulting\none-photon and two-photons absorption probabilities significantly.\n", "  Many real-world complex networks simultaneously exhibit topological features\nof scale-free behaviour and hierarchical organization. In this regard,\ndeterministic scale-free [A.-L. Barab\\'asi \\etal, Physica A, 299, 3 (2001)] and\npseudofractal scale-free [S. N. Dorogovtsev \\etal, Phy. Rev. E, 65, 6 (2002)]\nnetworks constitute notable models which simultaneously incorporate the\naforementioned properties. The rules governing the formation of such networks\nare completely deterministic. However, real-world networks are presumably\nneither completely deterministic, nor perfectly hierarchical. Therefore, we\nsuggest here perfectly hierarchical scale-free networks with randomly rewired\nedges as better representatives of practical networked systems. In particular,\nwe preserve the scale-free degree distribution of the various deterministic\nnetworks but successively relax the hierarchical structure while rewiring them.\nWe utilize the framework of master stability function in investigating the\nsynchronizability of dynamical systems coupled on such rewired networks.\nInterestingly, this reveals that the process of rewiring is capable of\nsignificantly enhancing, as well as, deteriorating the synchronizability of the\nresulting networks. We investigate the influence of rewiring edges on the\ntopological properties of the rewired networks and, in turn, their relation to\nthe synchronizability of the respective topologies. Finally, we compare the\nsynchronizability of deterministic scale-free and pseudofractcal scale-free\nnetworks with that of random scale-free networks (generated using the classical\nBarab\\'asi-Albert model of growth and preferential attachment) and find that\nthe latter ones promote synchronizability better than their deterministic\ncounterparts.\n", "  We report on the measurement of the scattering properties of ultracold\n$^{174}$Yb bosons in a three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice. Site occupancy\nin an atomic Mott insulator is resolved with high-precision spectroscopy on an\nultranarrow optical clock transition. Scattering lengths and loss rate\ncoefficients for $^{174}$Yb atoms in different collisional channels involving\nthe ground state $^1$S$_0$ and the metastable $^3$P$_0$ are derived. These\nstudies set important constraints for future experimental studies of\ntwo-electron atoms for quantum-technological applications.\n", "  In recent years, microresonator-based optical frequency combs have created up\nopportunities for developing a spectroscopy laboratory on a chip due to its\nbroadband emission and high comb power. However, with mode spacings typically\nin the range of 10 - 1000 GHz, the realization of a chip-based high-resolution\nspectrometer suitable for gas-phase spectroscopy has proven to be difficult.\nHere, we show mode-hop-free tuning of a microresonator-based frequency comb\nover 16 GHz by simultaneously tuning both the pump laser and the cavity\nresonance. We illustrate the power of this scanning technique by demonstrating\ngas-phase molecular fingerprinting of acetylene with a high-spectral-resolution\nof < 80 MHz over a 45-THz optical bandwidth in the mid-IR. Our technique\nrepresents a significant step towards on-chip gas sensing with an ultimate\nspectral resolution given by the comb linewidth.\n", "  Effective field theory (EFT) is generalized to investigate the rotational\nmotion of triaxially deformed even-even nuclei. A Hamiltonian, called the\ntriaxial rotor model (TRM), is obtained up to next-to-leading order (NLO)\nwithin the EFT formalism. Its applicability is examined by comparing with a\nfive-dimensional collective Hamiltonian (5DCH) for the description of the\nenergy spectra of the ground state and $\\gamma$ band in Ru isotopes. It is\nfound that by taking into account the NLO corrections, the ground state band in\nthe whole spin region and the $\\gamma$ band in the low spin region are well\ndescribed. The results presented here indicate that it should be possible to\nfurther generalize the EFT to triaxial nuclei with odd mass number.\n", "  R-symmetry leads to a distinct realisation of SUSY with a significantly\nmodified coloured sector featuring a Dirac gluino and a scalar colour octet\n(sgluon). We present the impact of R-symmetry on squark production at the 13\nTeV LHC. We study the total cross sections and their NLO corrections from all\nstrongly interacting states, their dependence on the Dirac gluino mass and\nsgluon mass as well as their systematics for selected benchmark points. We find\nthat tree-level cross sections in the R-symmetric model are reduced compared to\nthe MSSM but the NLO K-factors are generally larger in the order of ten to\ntwenty per cent. In the course of this work we derive the required DREG $\\to$\nDRED transition counterterms and necessary on-shell renormalisation constants.\nThe real corrections are treated using FKS subtraction, with results cross\nchecked against an independent calculation employing the two cut phase space\nslicing method.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are nano-sized topologically protected spin textures with\nparticle-like properties. They can form lattices perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield and the orientation of these skyrmion lattices with respect to the\ncrystallographic lattice is governed by spin-orbit coupling. By performing\nsmall angle neutron scattering measurements, we investigate the coupling\nbetween the crystallographic and skyrmion lattices in both Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ and\nthe archetype chiral magnet MnSi. The results reveal that the orientation of\nthe skyrmion lattice is primarily determined by the magnetic field direction\nwith respect to the crystallographic lattice. In addition, it is also\ninfluenced by the magnetic history of the sample which can induce metastable\nlattices. Kinetic measurements show that these metastable skyrmion lattices may\nor may not relax to their equilibrium positions under macroscopic relaxation\ntimes. Furthermore, multidomain lattices may form when two or more equivalent\ncrystallographic directions are favored by spin-orbit coupling and oriented\nperpendicular to the magnetic field.\n", "  This work focuses on quantitative representation of transport in systems with\nquenched disorder. Explicit mapping of the quenched trap model to continuous\ntime random walk is presented. Linear temporal transformation: $t\\to\nt/\\Lambda^{1/\\alpha}$ for transient process on translationally invariant\nlattice, in the sub-diffusive regime, is sufficient for asymptotic mapping.\nExact form of the constant $\\Lambda^{1/\\alpha}$ is established. Disorder\naveraged position probability density function for quenched trap model is\nobtained and analytic expressions for the diffusion coefficient and drift are\nprovided.\n", "  The chemical yields of supernovae and the metal enrichment of the hot\nintra-cluster medium (ICM) are not well understood. This paper introduces the\nCHEmical Enrichment RGS Sample (CHEERS), which is a sample of 44 bright local\ngiant ellipticals, groups and clusters of galaxies observed with XMM-Newton.\nThis paper focuses on the abundance measurements of O and Fe using the\nreflection grating spectrometer (RGS). The deep exposures and the size of the\nsample allow us to quantify the intrinsic scatter and the systematic\nuncertainties in the abundances using spectral modeling techniques. We report\nthe oxygen and iron abundances as measured with RGS in the core regions of all\nobjects in the sample. We do not find a significant trend of O/Fe as a function\nof cluster temperature, but we do find an intrinsic scatter in the O and Fe\nabundances from cluster to cluster. The level of systematic uncertainties in\nthe O/Fe ratio is estimated to be around 20-30%, while the systematic\nuncertainties in the absolute O and Fe abundances can be as high as 50% in\nextreme cases. We were able to identify and correct a systematic bias in the\noxygen abundance determination, which was due to an inaccuracy in the spectral\nmodel. The lack of dependence of O/Fe on temperature suggests that the\nenrichment of the ICM does not depend on cluster mass and that most of the\nenrichment likely took place before the ICM was formed. We find that the\nobserved scatter in the O/Fe ratio is due to a combination of intrinsic scatter\nin the source and systematic uncertainties in the spectral fitting, which we\nare unable to disentangle. The astrophysical source of intrinsic scatter could\nbe due to differences in AGN activity and ongoing star formation in the BCG.\nThe systematic scatter is due to uncertainties in the spatial line broadening,\nabsorption column, multi-temperature structure and the thermal plasma models.\n(Abbreviated).\n", "  We continue the study of Lagrangian descriptions of $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nArgyres-Douglas theories. We use our recent interpretation in terms of\nsequential confinement to guess the Lagrangians of all the Argyres-Douglas\nmodels with Abelian three dimensional mirror. We find classes of four\ndimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ quivers that flow in the infrared to generalized\nArgyres-Douglas theories, such as the $(A_k,A_{kN+N-1})$ models. We study in\ndetail how the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ chiral rings map to the Coulomb and Higgs\nBranches of the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ CFT's. The three dimensional mirror RG flows\nare shown to land on the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ complete graph quivers. We also\ncompactify to three dimensions the gauge theory dual to $(A_1,D_4)$, and find\nthe expected Abelianization duality with $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SQED with $3$ flavors.\n", "  By means of first-principles calculations, we investigate the thermal\nproperties of silica as it evolves, under hydrostatic compression, from a\nstishovite phase into a CaCl$_2$-type structure. We compute the thermal\nconductivity tensor by solving the linearized Boltzmann transport equation\niteratively in a wide temperature range, using for this the pressure-dependent\nharmonic and anharmonic interatomic couplings obtained from first principles.\nMost remarkably, we find that, at low temperatures, SiO$_2$ displays a large\npeak in the in-plane thermal conductivity and a highly anisotropic behavior\nclose to the structural transformation. We trace back the origin of these\nfeatures by analyzing the phonon contributions to the conductivity. We discuss\nthe implications of our results in the general context of continuous structural\ntransformations in solids, as well as the potential geological interest of our\nresults for silica.\n", "  This paper presents the spatially resolved star formation history (2D-SFH) of\na small sample of four local mergers: the early-stage mergers IC1623, NGC6090,\nand the Mice, and the more advanced merger NGC2623, by analyzing IFS data from\nthe CALIFA survey and PMAS in LArr mode. Full spectral fitting techniques are\napplied to the datacubes to obtain the spatially resolved mass growth\nhistories, the time evolution of the star formation rate intensity\n($\\Sigma_{SFR}$), and the local specific star formation rate, over three\ndifferent timescales (30 Myr, 300 Myr, and 1 Gyr). The results are compared\nwith non-interacting Sbc--Sc galaxies, to quantify if there is an enhancement\nof the star formation and to trace its time scale and spatial extent. Our\nresults for the three LIRGs (IC1623W, NGC6090, and NGC2623) show that a major\nphase of star formation is occurring in time scales of 10$^{7}$ yr to few\n10$^{8}$ yr, with global SFR enhancements of $\\sim$2--6 with respect to\nmain-sequence star forming (MSSF) galaxies. In the two early-stage mergers\nIC1623W and NGC6090, which are between first pericenter passage and\ncoalescence, the most remarkable increase of the SFR with respect to\nnon-interacting spirals occurred in the last 30 Myr, and it is spatially\nextended, with enhancements of factors 2--7 both in the centres ($r <$ 0.5 half\nlight radius, HLR), and in the disks ($r >$ 1 HLR). In the more advanced merger\nNGC 2623 an extended phase of star formation occurred on a longer time-scale of\n$\\sim$1 Gyr, with a SFR enhancement of a factor $\\sim$2--3 larger than the one\nin Sbc--Sc MSSF galaxies over the same period, probably relic of the first\npericenter passage epoch. A SFR enhancement in the last 30 Myr is also present,\nbut only in NGC2623 centre, by a factor 3. In general, the spatially resolved\nSFHs of the LIRG-mergers are consistent with the predictions from high spatial\nresolution simulations.\n", "  It is widely known that the primordial curvature perturbation $\\zeta$ has\nseveral universal properties in the infrared (IR) such as the soft theorem,\nwhich is also known as the consistency relation, and the conservation in time.\nThey are valid in rather general single clock models of inflation. It has been\nargued that these universal properties are deeply related to the large gauge\ntransformations in inflationary spacetime. However, the invariance under the\nlarge gauge transformations is not sufficient to show these IR properties. In\nthis paper, we show that the locality condition is crucial to show the\nconsistency relation and the conservation of $\\zeta$. This argument also can\napply to an interacting system with the inflaton and heavy fields which have\narbitrary integer spins, including higher spin fields, which may be motivated\nfrom string theory. We will also show that the locality condition guarantees\nthe cancellation of the IR divergences in a certain class of variables whose\ncorrelation functions resemble cosmologically observable quantities.\n", "  We determine the asymptotic symmetry group of Killing horizons by choosing\nGaussian null coordinates in the neighbourhood of the horizon and boundary\nconditions that respect the leading order terms in the metric. The analysis\ndivides naturally into the two cases of subextremal and extremal horizons. In\ngeneral, we find rather involved asymptotic symmetry generators that\nnevertheless involve supertranslations and Killing vectors on the compact\nhorizon. The most striking observation is the difference in the dependence on\nthe coordinate along the horizon; we relate this to the redshift effect for\nsubextremal horizons. We consider the spherically symmetric case as a special\nand illuminating example.\n", "  In this paper, we attempt to implement the neutrino $\\mu$-$\\tau$ reflection\nsymmetry (which predicts $\\theta^{}_{23} = \\pi/4$ and $\\delta = \\pm \\pi/2$ as\nwell as trivial Majorana phases) in the minimal seesaw (which enables us to fix\nthe neutrino masses). For some direct (the preliminary experimental hints\ntowards $\\theta^{}_{23} \\neq \\pi/4$ and $\\delta \\neq - \\pi/2$) and indirect\n(inclusion of the renormalization group equation effect and implementation of\nthe leptogenesis mechanism) reasons, we particularly study the breakings of\nthis symmetry and their phenomenological consequences.\n", "  We study the causes of anomalous dispersion in Darcy-scale porous media\ncharacterized by spatially heterogeneous hydraulic properties. Spatial\nvariability in hydraulic conductivity leads to spatial variability in the flow\nproperties through Darcy's law and thus impacts on solute and particle\ntransport. We consider purely advective transport in heterogeneity scenarios\ncharacterized by broad distributions of heterogeneity length scales and point\nvalues. Particle transport is characterized in terms of the stochastic\nproperties of equidistantly sampled Lagrangian velocities, which are determined\nby the flow and conductivity statistics. The persistence length scales of flow\nand transport velocities are imprinted in the spatial disorder and reflect the\ndistribution of heterogeneity length scales. Particle transitions over the\nvelocity length scales are kinematically coupled with the transition time\nthrough velocity. We show that the average particle motion follows a coupled\ncontinuous time random walk (CTRW), which is fully parameterized by the\ndistribution of flow velocities and the medium geometry in terms of the\nheterogeneity length scales. The coupled CTRW provides a systematic framework\nfor the investigation of the origins of anomalous dispersion in terms of\nheterogeneity correlation and the distribution of heterogeneity point values.\nBroad distributions of heterogeneity point values and lengths scales may lead\nto very similar dispersion behaviors in terms of the spatial variance. Their\nmechanisms, however are very different, which manifests in the distributions of\nparticle positions and arrival times, which plays a central role for the\nprediction of the fate of dissolved substances in heterogeneous natural and\nengineered porous materials.\n", "  Transmission of low-energetic electrons through two-dimensional materials\nleads to unique scattering resonances. These resonances contribute to\nphotoemission from occupied bands where they appear as strongly dispersive\nfeatures of suppressed photoelectron intensity. Using angle-resolved\nphotoemission we have systematically studied scattering resonances in epitaxial\ngraphene grown on the chemically differing substrates Ir(111), Bi/Ir, Ni(111)\nas well as in graphene/Ir(111) nanopatterned with a superlattice of uniform Ir\nquantum dots. While the strength of the chemical interaction with the substrate\nhas almost no effect on the dispersion of the scattering resonances, their\nenergy can be controlled by the magnitude of charge transfer from/to graphene.\nAt the same time, a superlattice of small quantum dots deposited on graphene\neliminates the resonances completely. We ascribe this effect to a\nnanodot-induced buckling of graphene and its local rehybridization from\nsp$^{2}$ to sp$^{3}$ towards a three-dimensional structure. Our results suggest\nnanopatterning as a prospective tool for tuning optoelectronic properties of\ntwo-dimensional materials with graphene-like structure.\n", "  A Geant4-based Monte Carlo package named G4DS has been developed to simulate\nthe response of DarkSide-50, an experiment operating since 2013 at LNGS,\ndesigned to detect WIMP interactions in liquid argon. In the process of WIMP\nsearches, DarkSide-50 has achieved two fundamental milestones: the rejection of\nelectron recoil background with a power of ~10^7, using the pulse shape\ndiscrimination technique, and the measurement of the residual 39Ar\ncontamination in underground argon, ~3 orders of magnitude lower with respect\nto atmospheric argon. These results rely on the accurate simulation of the\ndetector response to the liquid argon scintillation, its ionization, and\nelectron-ion recombination processes. This work provides a complete overview of\nthe DarkSide Monte Carlo and of its performance, with a particular focus on\nPARIS, the custom-made liquid argon response model.\n", "  The mechanical force from light -- radiation pressure -- provides an\nintrinsic nonlinear interaction. Consequently, optomechanical systems near\ntheir steady state, such as the canonical optical spring, can display\nnon-analytic behavior as a function of external parameters. This\nnon-analyticity, a key feature of thermodynamic phase transitions, suggests\nthat there could be an effective thermodynamic description of optomechanical\nsystems. Here we explicitly define the thermodynamic limit for optomechanical\nsystems and derive a set of sufficient constraints on the system parameters as\nthe mechanical system grows large. As an example, we show how these constraints\ncan be satisfied in a system with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and derive a free\nenergy, allowing us to characterize this as an equilibrium phase transition.\n", "  We study a quantum Otto engine embedding a working substance composed by a\ntwo-level system interacting with a harmonic mode. The physical properties of\nthe substance are described by a generalized quantum Rabi model arising in\nsuperconducting circuits realizations. We show that light-matter quantum\ncorrelations reduction during the hot bath stage and compression stage act as a\nresource for enhanced work extraction and efficiency respectively. Also, we\ndemonstrate that the anharmonic spectrum of the working subtance has a direct\nimpact on the transition from heat engine into refrigerator as the light-matter\ncoupling is increased. These results shed light on the search for optimal\nconditions in the performance of quantum heat engines.\n", "  Lyapunov exponents measure the average exponential growth rate of typical\nlinear perturbations in a chaotic system, and the inverse of the largest\nexponent is a measure of the time horizon over which the evolution of the\nsystem can be predicted. Here, Lyapunov exponents are determined in forced\nhomogeneous isotropic turbulence for a range of Reynolds numbers. Results show\nthat the maximum exponent increases with Reynolds number faster than the\ninverse Kolmogorov time scale, suggesting that the instability processes may be\nacting on length and time scales smaller than Kolmogorov scales. Analysis of\nthe linear disturbance used to compute the Lyapunov exponent, and its\ninstantaneous growth, show that the instabilities do, as expected, act on the\nsmallest eddies, and that at any time, there are many sites of local\ninstabilities.\n", "  We demonstrate that the metallic topological surface states wrap on all sides\nthe 3D topological crystalline insulator SnTe. This is achieved by studying\noscillatory quantum magneto-transport and magnetization at tilted magnetic\nfields which enables us to observe simultaneous contributions from neighbouring\nsample sides. Taking into account pinning of the Fermi energy by the SnTe\nreservoir we successfully describe theoretically the de Haas-van Alphen\noscillations of magnetization. The determined \\pi-Berry phase of surface states\nconfirms their Dirac fermion character. We independently observe oscillatory\ncontributions of magneto-transport and magnetization originating from the bulk\nSnTe reservoir of high hole density. It is concluded that the bulk and surface\nLandau states exist in parallel. Our main result that the bulk reservoir is\nsurrounded on all sides by the topological surface states has an universal\ncharacter.\n", "  We revisit the subject of one-loop determinants in AdS$_3$ gravity via the\nquasinormal mode method. Our goal is to evaluate a one-loop determinant with\nchiral boundary conditions for the metric field; chirality is achieved by\nimposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on certain components while others\nsatisfy Neumann. Along the way, we give a generalization of the quasinormal\nmode method for stationary (non-static) thermal backgrounds, and propose a\ntreatment for Neumann boundary conditions in this framework. We evaluate the\ngraviton one-loop determinant on the Euclidean BTZ background with\nparity-violating boundary conditions (CSS), and find excellent agreement with\nthe dual warped CFT. We also discuss a more general falloff in AdS$_3$ that is\nrelated to two dimensional quantum gravity in lightcone gauge. The behavior of\nthe ghost fields under both sets of boundary conditions is novel and we discuss\npotential interpretations.\n", "  We demonstrate a coincidence velocity map imaging apparatus equipped with a\nnovel time stamping fast optical camera, Tpx3Cam, whose high sensitivity and ns\ntiming resolution allow for simultaneous position and time-of-flight detection.\nThis single detector design is simple, flexible and capable of highly\ndifferential measurements. We show detailed characterization of the camera and\nits application in strong field ionization experiments.\n", "  Complex mathematical models of interaction networks are routinely used for\nprediction in systems biology. However, it is difficult to reconcile network\ncomplexities with a formal understanding of their behavior. Here, we propose a\nsimple procedure (called $\\bar \\varphi$) to reduce biological models to\nfunctional submodules, using statistical mechanics of complex systems combined\nwith a fitness-based approach inspired by $\\textit{in silico}$ evolution. $\\bar\n\\varphi$ works by putting parameters or combination of parameters to some\nasymptotic limit, while keeping (or slightly improving) the model performance,\nand requires parameter symmetry breaking for more complex models. We illustrate\n$\\bar \\varphi$ on biochemical adaptation and on different models of immune\nrecognition by T cells. An intractable model of immune recognition with close\nto a hundred individual transition rates is reduced to a simple two-parameter\nmodel. $\\bar \\varphi$ extracts three different mechanisms for early immune\nrecognition, and automatically discovers similar functional modules in\ndifferent models of the same process, allowing for model classification and\ncomparison. Our procedure can be applied to biological networks based on rate\nequations using a fitness function that quantifies phenotypic performance.\n", "  We study entanglement entropy in a particular tensor-scalar theory: Horndeski\ngravity. Our goal is two-fold: investigate the Lewkowycz-Maldacena proposal for\nentanglement entropy in the presence of a tensor-scalar coupling and address a\npuzzle existing in the literature regarding the thermal entropy of\nasymptotically AdS Horndeski black holes. Using the squashed cone method, i.e.\nturning on a conical singularity in the bulk, we derive the functional for\nentanglement entropy in Horndeski gravity. We analyze the divergence structure\nof the bulk equation of motion. Demanding that the leading divergence of the\ntransverse component of the equation of motion vanishes we identify the surface\nwhere to evaluate the entanglement functional. We show that the surface\nobtained is precisely the one that minimizes said functional. By evaluating the\nentanglement entropy functional on the horizon we obtain the thermal entropy\nfor Horndeski black holes; this result clarifies discrepancies in the\nliterature. As an application of the functional derived we find the minimal\nsurfaces numerically and study the entanglement plateaux.\n", "  We use Boltzmann transport equation (BE) to study time evolution of a\nphoto-excited state in a nanoparticle including phonon-mediated exciton\nrelaxation and the multiple exciton generation (MEG) processes, such as\nexciton-to-biexciton multiplication and biexciton-to-exciton recombination. BE\ncollision integrals are computed using Kadanoff-Baym-Keldysh many-body\nperturbation theory (MBPT) based on density functional theory (DFT)\nsimulations, including exciton effects. We compute internal quantum efficiency\n(QE), which is the number of excitons generated from an absorbed photon in the\ncourse of the relaxation. We apply this approach to chiral single-wall carbon\nnanotubes (SWCNTs), such as (6,2), and (6,5). We predict efficient MEG in the\n(6,2) and (6,5) SWCNTs within the solar spectrum range starting at the $2 E_g$\nenergy threshold and with QE reaching $\\sim 1.6$ at about $3 E_g,$ where $E_g$\nis the electronic gap.\n", "  Optical Frequency Comb (OFC) generated by semiconductor lasers are currently\nwidely used in the extremely timely field of high capacity optical\ninterconnects and high precision spectroscopy. Very recently, several\nexperimental evidences of spontaneous OFC generation have been reported in\nsingle section Quantum Dot (QD) lasers. Here we provide a physical\nunderstanding of these self-organization phenomena by simulating the multi-mode\ndynamics of a single section Fabry-Perot (FP) QD laser using a Time-Domain\nTraveling-Wave (TDTW) model that properly accounts for coherent\nradiation-matter interaction in the semiconductor active medium and includes\nthe carrier grating generated by the optical standing wave pattern in the laser\ncavity. We show that the latter is the fundamental physical effect at the\norigin of the multi-mode spectrum appearing just above threshold. A\nself-mode-locking regime associated with the emission of OFC is achieved for\nhigher bias currents and ascribed to nonlinear phase sensitive effects as Four\nWave Mixing (FWM). Our results are in very good agreement with the experimental\nones.\n", "  We examine the effects of confinement on the dynamics of premelted films\ndriven by thermomolecular pressure gradients. Our approach is to modify a\nwell-studied setting in which the thermomolecular pressure gradient is driven\nby a temperature gradient parallel to an interfacially premelted elastic wall.\nThe modification treats the increase in viscosity associated with the thinning\nof films, studied in a wide variety of materials, using a power law and we\nexamine the consequent evolution of the confining elastic wall. We treat (1) a\nrange of interactions that are known to underlie interfacial premelting and (2)\na constant temperature gradient wherein the thermomolecular pressure gradient\nis a constant. The difference between the cases with and without the proximity\neffect arises in the volume flux of premelted liquid. The proximity effect\nincreases the viscosity as the film thickness decreases thereby requiring the\nthermomolecular pressure driven flux to be accommodated at higher temperatures\nwhere the premelted film thickness is the largest. Implications for experiment\nand observations of frost heave are discussed.\n", "  We study evolution and thermodynamics of a slow-roll transition between early\nand late time de Sitter phases, both in the homogeneous case and in the\npresence of a black hole, in a scalar field model with a generic potential\nhaving both a maximum and a positive minimum. Asymptotically future de Sitter\nspacetimes are characterized by ADM charges known as cosmological tensions. We\nshow that the late time de Sitter phase has finite cosmological tension when\nthe scalar field oscillation around its minimum is underdamped, while the\ncosmological tension in the overdamped case diverges. We compute the variation\nin the cosmological and black hole horizon areas between the early and late\ntime phases, finding that the fractional change in horizon area is proportional\nto the corresponding fractional change in the effective cosmological constant.\nWe show that the extended first law of thermodynamics, including variation in\nthe effective cosmological constant, is satisfied between the initial and final\nstates, and discuss the dynamical evolution of the black hole temperature.\n", "  The optical properties of KFe$_2$As$_2$ have been measured for light\npolarized in the a-b planes over a wide temperature and frequency range. Below\n$T^\\ast\\simeq 155$ K, where this material undergoes an incoherent-coherent\ncrossover, we observe a new coherent response emerging in the optical\nconductivity. A spectral weight analysis suggests that this new feature arises\nout of high-energy bound states. Below about $T_{\\rm FL} \\simeq 75$ K the\nscattering rate for this new feature is quadratic in temperature, indicating a\nFermi-liquid response. Theory calculations suggest this crossover is dominated\nby the $d_{xy}$ orbital. Our results advocate for Kondo-type screening as the\nmechanism for the orbital-selective incoherent-coherent crossover in\nhole-overdoped KFe$_2$As$_2$.\n", "  In this work the influence of cylindrical shape and alignment layers on light\nreflection in Blue Phase Liquid Crystal (BPLC) is presented. For the first\ntime, the process of BP domains growth in a capillary is presented. The\ncylindrical structure, its diameter and alignment layers change the\norientations of cubic blue phase (BP) domains and affect their growth. By using\ntemperature and external electric field the uniform structure was obtained. In\nthis study the ability of switching between BP I and chiral phase in a\ncapillary is also shown.\n", "  The gravitational consequence of local Lorentz violation (LV) should show\nitself in derivation of the characteristic quasinormal ringing of black hole\nmergers from their general relativity case. In this paper, we study quasinormal\nmodes (QNMs) of the scalar and electromagnetic field perturbations to Einstein\naether black holes. We find that quasinormal ringing of the first kind aether\nblack hole is similar to that of another Lorentz violation model---the\nQED-extension limit of standard model extension. These similarities between\ncompletely different backgrounds may imply that LV in gravity sector and LV in\nmatter sector have some connections between themself: damping quasinormal\nringing of black holes more rapidly and prolonging its oscillation period. By\ncompared to Schwarzschild black hole, both the first and the second kind aether\nblack holes have larger damping rate and smaller real oscillation frequency of\nQNMs. And the differences are from 0.7 percent to 35 percents, those could be\ndetected by new generation of gravitational antennas.\n", "  We calculate the electron excitation in cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) caused\nby the intense femtosecond laser double pulses using time-dependent density\nfunctional theory (TDDFT). We assume the electron distributions in the valence\nband (VB) and the conduction band (CB) based on three different approaches to\ndetermine the dependence of the plasma that is formed on the excitation by the\nfirst pulse. First, we consider the simple double pulse irradiation, which does\nnot include the electron-electron collisions and relaxation. Second, we\nconsider the partially thermalized electronic state, in which the electron\ntemperatures and numbers in the VB and the CB are defined independently. This\nassumption corresponds to the plasma before the electron-hole collisions\nbecomes dominant. The third approach uses the fully thermalized electron\ndistribution, which corresponds to a timescale of hundreds fs. Our results\nindicate that the simple double pulse approach is the worst of the three, and\nshow that the plasma formation changes the efficiency of the excitation by the\nsecond pulse. When the electron temperature decreases, the laser excitation\nefficiency increases as a result.\n", "  We show that the physics of anapole excitations can be accurately described\nin terms of a resonant state expansion formulation of standard Mie theory\nwithout recourse to Cartesian coordinate based `toroidal' currents that have\npreviously been used to describe this phenomenon. In this purely Mie theory\nframework, the anapole behavior arises as a result of a Fano-type interference\neffect between different quasi-normal modes of the scatterer that effectively\neliminate the scattered field in the associated multipole order.\n", "  We report on the microwave characterization of a novel one-dimensional\nJosephson metamaterial composed of a chain of asymmetric superconducting\nquantum interference devices (SQUIDs) with nearest-neighbor coupling through\ncommon Josephson junctions. This metamaterial demonstrates a strong Kerr\nnonlinearity, with a Kerr constant tunable over a wide range, from positive to\nnegative values, by a magnetic flux threading the SQUIDs. The experimental\nresults are in good agreement with the theory of nonlinear effects in Josephson\nchains. The metamaterial is very promising as an active medium for Josephson\ntraveling-wave parametric amplifiers; its use facilitates phase matching in a\nfour-wave mixing process for efficient parametric gain.\n", "  We show that the experimental data of mid-rapidity $p_{T}$ spectra for\nproton, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$ , $\\Omega^{-}$, $\\text{K(892)}^{*0}$ and\n$\\Xi(1530)^{*0}$ in minimum-bias $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV can be\nsystemically explained by the quark combination mechanism of hadronization. The\naveraged transverse momentum $\\langle p_{T}\\rangle$ and spectra ratios such as\n$\\Xi/\\Lambda$ and $\\Omega/\\phi$ calculated from quark combination reproduce the\ndata much better than those from traditional string and/or cluster\nfragmentation. The available data of hadronic $p_{T}$ spectra released by ALICE\ncollaboration in the first three high-multiplicity classes of $pp$ collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV are also well explained. We make predictions for other\nhadrons, and propose two scaling behaviors among decuplet baryons and vector\nmesons as the effective probe of hadron production mechanism at such high\ncollision energy.\n", "  We discuss non-linear instantons in supersymmetric field theories on curved\nspaces arising from D-branes. Focusing on D3-branes and four-dimensional field\ntheories, we derive the supersymmetry conditions and show the intimate relation\nbetween the instanton solutions and the non-linearly realized supersymmetries\nof the field theory. We demonstrate that field theories with non-linearly\nrealized supersymmetries are coupled to supergravity backgrounds in a similar\nfashion as those with linearly realized supersymmetries, and provide details on\nhow to derive such couplings from a type II perspective.\n", "  Anti-D3 branes and non-perturbative effects in flux compactifications\nspontaneously break supersymmetry and stabilise moduli in a metastable de\nSitter vacua. The low energy 4D effective field theory description for such\nmodels would be a supergravity theory with non-linearly realised supersymmetry.\nGuided by string theory modular symmetry, we compute this non-linear\nsupergravity theory, including dependence on all bulk moduli. Using either a\nconstrained chiral superfield or a constrained vector field, the uplifting\ncontribution to the scalar potential from the anti-D3 brane can be\nparameterised either as an F-term or Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term. Using again the\nmodular symmetry, we show that 4D non-linear supergravities that descend from\nstring theory have an enhanced protection from quantum corrections by\nnon-renormalisation theorems. The superpotential giving rise to metastable de\nSitter vacua is robust against perturbative string-loop and $\\alpha'$\ncorrections.\n", "  We introduce a mixed density fitting scheme that uses both a Gaussian and a\nplane-wave fitting basis to accurately evaluate electron repulsion integrals in\ncrystalline systems. We use this scheme to enable efficient all-electron\nGaussian based periodic density functional and Hartree-Fock calculations.\n", "  We study local quenches in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories at\nlarge-c by operators carrying higher spin charge. Viewing such states as\nsolutions in Chern-Simons theory, representing infalling massive particles with\nspin-three charge in the BTZ background, we use the Wilson line prescription to\ncompute the single-interval entanglement entropy (EE) and scrambling time\nfollowing the quench. We find that the change in EE is finite (and real) only\nif the spin-three charge q is bounded by the energy of the perturbation E, as\n|q|/c < E^2/c^2. We show that the Wilson line/EE correlator deep in the\nquenched regime and its expansion for small quench widths overlaps with the\nRegge limit for chaos of the out-of-time-ordered correlator. We further find\nthat the scrambling time for the two-sided mutual information between two\nintervals in the thermofield double state increases with increasing spin-three\ncharge, diverging when the bound is saturated. For larger values of the charge,\nthe scrambling time is shorter than for pure gravity and controlled by the\nspin-three Lyapunov exponent 4\\pi/\\beta. In a CFT with higher spin chemical\npotential, dual to a higher spin black hole, we find that the chemical\npotential must be bounded to ensure that the mutual information is a concave\nfunction of time and entanglement speed is less than the speed of light. In\nthis case, a quench with zero higher spin charge yields the same Lyapunov\nexponent as pure Einstein gravity.\n", "  That of disequilibrium (D) is a statistical notion introduced by\nL\\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet (LMC) more than 20 years ago [Phys. Lett. A\n209 (1995) 321]. D measures the amount of correlational structure of a system.\nWe wish to use D to analyze one of the simplest types of quantum correlations,\nthose present in simple quantum gaseous systems and due to symmetry\nconsiderations. To this end we extend the LMC formalism to the grand canonical\nenvironment and show that D displays distinctive behaviors for simple gases,\nthat allow for interesting insights into their structural properties.\n", "  Defects such as vacancies and impurities could have profound effects on the\ntransport properties of thermoelectric materials. However, it is usually quite\ndifficult to directly calculate the thermoelectric properties of\ndefect-containing systems via first-principles method since very large\nsupercell is required. In this work, based on the linear response theory and\nthe kernel polynomial method, we present an efficient approach that can help to\ncalculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients of a large system\ncontaining millions of atoms at arbitrary chemical potential and temperature.\nAs a prototype example, we consider dilute vacancies and hydrogen impurities in\na large scale {\\gamma}-graphyne sheet and discuss their effects on the\nthermoelectric transport properties.\n", "  Recently a consistent non-perturbative quantization of the Schwarzschild\ninterior resulting in a bounce from black hole to white hole geometry has been\nobtained by loop quantizing the Kantowski-Sachs vacuum spacetime. As in other\nspacetimes where the singularity is dominated by the Weyl part of the spacetime\ncurvature, the structure of the singularity is highly anisotropic in the\nKantowski-Sachs vacuum spacetime. As a result the bounce turns out to be in\ngeneral asymmetric creating a large mass difference between the parent black\nhole and the child white hole. In this manuscript, we investigate under what\ncircumstances a symmetric bounce scenario can be constructed in the above\nquantization. Using the setting of Dirac observables and geometric clocks we\nobtain a symmetric bounce condition which can be satisfied by a slight\nmodification in the construction of loops over which holonomies are considered\nin the quantization procedure. These modifications can be viewed as\nquantization ambiguities, and are demonstrated in three different flavors which\nall lead to a non-singular black to white hole transition with identical\nmasses. Our results show that quantization ambiguities can mitigate or even\nqualitatively change some key features of physics of singularity resolution.\nFurther, these results are potentially helpful in motivating and constructing\nsymmetric black to white hole transition scenarios.\n", "  An atom interferometer using a Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms is\nutilized for the measurement of magnetic field gradients. Composite optical\npulses are used to construct a spatially symmetric Mach-Zehnder geometry. Using\na biased interferometer we demonstrate the ability to measure small residual\nforces in our system at the position of the atoms. These are a residual\nmagnetic field gradient of 15$\\pm$2 mG/cm and and an inertial acceleration of\n0.08$\\pm$0.02 m/s$^2$. Our method has important applications in the calibration\nof precision measurement devices and the reduction of systematic errors.\n", "  McVittie spacetimes embed the vacuum Schwarzschild(-(anti) de Sitter)\nspacetime in an isotropic FLRW background universe. We study the global\nstructure of McVittie spacetimes with spatially non-flat FLRW backgrounds. This\nrequires the extension of the definition of such spacetimes, previously given\nonly for the flat and open cases, to the closed case. We revisit this\ndefinition and show how it gives rise to a unique spacetime (given the FLRW\nbackground, the mass parameter $M$ and the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$) in\nthe open and flat cases. In the closed case, an additional free function of the\ncosmic time arises. We derive some basic results on the metric, curvature and\nmatter content of McVittie spacetimes and derive a representation of the line\nelement that makes the study of their global properties possible. In the closed\ncase (independently of the free function mentioned above), the spacetime is\nconfined (at each instant of time) to a region bounded by a minimum and a\nmaximum area radius, and is bounded either to the future or to the past by a\nscalar curvature singularity. This allowed region only exists when the\nbackground scale factor is above a certain minimum. In the open case, radial\nnull geodesics originate in finite affine time in the past at a boundary formed\nby the union of the Big Bang singularity of the FLRW background and a\nnon-singular hypersurface of varying causal character. Furthermore, in the case\nof eternally expanding open universes, we show that black holes are ubiquitous:\ningoing radial null geodesics extend in finite affine time to a hypersurface\nthat forms the boundary of the region from which photons can escape to future\nnull infinity. We revisit the black hole interpretation of McVittie spacetimes\nin the spatially flat case, and show that this interpretation holds also in the\ncase of a vanishing cosmological constant, contrary to a previous claim of\nours.\n", "  HI intensity mapping is a new observational technique to survey the\nlarge-scale structure of matter using the 21 cm emission line of atomic\nhydrogen (HI). In this work, we simulate BINGO (BAO from Integrated Neutral Gas\nObservations) and SKA (Square Kilometre Array) phase-1 dish array operating in\nauto-correlation mode. For the optimal case of BINGO with no foregrounds, the\ncombination of the HI angular power spectra with Planck results allows $w$ to\nbe measured with a precision of $4\\%$, while the combination of the BAO\nacoustic scale with Planck gives a precision of $7\\%$. We consider a number of\npotentially complicating effects, including foregrounds and redshift dependent\nbias, which increase the uncertainty on $w$ but not dramatically; in all cases\nthe final uncertainty is found to be $\\Delta w < 8\\%$ for BINGO. For the\ncombination of SKA-MID in auto-correlation mode with Planck, we find that, in\nideal conditions, $w$ can be measured with a precision of $4\\%$ for the\nredshift range $0.35 < z < 3$ (i.e., for the bandwidth of $\\Delta \\nu = [350,\n1050]$ MHz) and $2\\%$ for $0 < z < 0.49$ (i.e., $\\Delta \\nu = [950, 1421]$\nMHz). Extending the model to include the sum of neutrino masses yields a $95\\%$\nupper limit of $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.24$ eV for BINGO and $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.08$ eV for\nSKA phase 1, competitive with the current best constraints in the case of BINGO\nand significantly better than them in the case of SKA.\n", "  Recently LHCb discovered the first doubly-charmed baryon $\\Xi_{cc}^{++} =\nccu$ at $3621.40 \\pm 0.78$ MeV, very close to our theoretical prediction. We\nuse the same methods to predict a doubly-bottom tetraquark $T(bb\\bar u\\bar d)$\nwith $J^P{=}1^+$ at $10,389\\pm 12$ MeV, 215 MeV below the $B^-\\bar B^{*0}$\nthreshold and 170 MeV below threshold for decay to $B^-\\bar B^0 \\gamma$. The\n$T(bb\\bar u\\bar d)$ is therefore stable under strong and electromagnetic (EM)\ninteractions and can only decay weakly, the first exotic hadron with such a\nproperty. On the other hand, the mass of $T(cc\\bar u\\bar d)$ with $J^P{=}1^+$\nis predicted to be $3882\\pm12$ MeV, 7 MeV above the $D^0 D^{*+}$ threshold and\n148 MeV above $D^0 D^+ \\gamma$ threshold. $T(bc\\bar u\\bar d)$ with $J^P{=}0^+$\nis predicted at $7134\\pm13$ MeV, 11 MeV below the $\\bar B^0 D^0$ threshold. Our\nprecision is not sufficient to determine whether $bc\\bar u\\bar d\\,$ is actually\nabove or below the threshold. It could manifest itself as a narrow resonance\njust at threshold.\n", "  Onsager's paper on phase transition and phase coexistence in anisotropic\ncolloidal systems is a landmark in the theory of lyotropic liquid crystals.\nHowever, an uncompromising scrutiny of Onsager's original derivation reveals\nthat it would be rigorously valid only for ludicrous values of the system's\nnumber density (of the order of the reciprocal of the number of particles)\nBased on Penrose's tree identity and an appropriate variant of the mean-field\napproach for purely repulsive, hard-core interactions, our theory shows that\nOnsager's theory is indeed valid for a reasonable range of densities.\n", "  Successful thermodynamic scaling of the structural alpha-relaxation time or\ntransport coefficients of glass-forming liquids determined at various\ntemperatures T and pressures P means the data conform to a single function of\nthe product variable TVgamma, where V is the specific volume and gamma is a\nmaterial specific constant. In the past two decades we have witnessed\nsuccessful TVgamma-scaling in many molecular, polymeric, and even metallic\nglass-formers, and gamma is related to the slope of the repulsive part of the\nintermolecular potential. The advances made indicate TVgamma-scaling is an\nimportant aspect of the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of glass-formers.\nIn this paper we show the origin of TVgamma-scaling is not from the structural\nalpha-relaxation time. Instead it comes from its precursor, the\nJohari-Goldstein beta-relaxation or the primitive relaxation of the Coupling\nModel and their relaxation times or tau_0 respectively. It is remarkable that\nall relaxation times are functions of TVgamma with the same gama, as well as\nthe fractional exponent of the Kohlrausch correlation function of the\nstructural alpha-relaxation. We arrive at this conclusion convincingly based on\ncorroborative evidences from a number of experiments and molecular dynamics\nsimulations performed on a wide variety of glass-formers and in conjunction\nwith consistency with the predictions of the Coupling Model.\n", "  A spectral representation for the neutrino propagator in a moving matter with\nconstant density is constructed. It is found that in a matter there exists a\n4-dimensional axis of complete polarization, all poles of the propagator are\nclassified according to the values of the spin projection onto this axis.\n", "  Plasma turbulence is investigated using high-resolution ion velocity\ndistributions measured by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) in the\nEarth's magnetosheath. The particle distribution is highly structured,\nsuggesting a cascade-like process in velocity space. This complex velocity\nspace structure is investigated using a three-dimensional Hermite transform\nthat reveals a power law distribution of moments. In analogy to hydrodynamics,\na Kolmogorov approach leads directly to a range of predictions for this\nphase-space cascade. The scaling theory is in agreement with observations,\nsuggesting a new path for the study of plasma turbulence in weakly collisional\nspace and astrophysical plasmas.\n", "  A common issue encountered in photoemission electron sources used in electron\naccelerators is the transverse inhomogeneity of the laser distribution\nresulting from the laser-amplification process and often use of frequency up\nconversion in nonlinear crystals. A inhomogeneous laser distribution on the\nphotocathode produces charged beams with lower beam quality. In this paper, we\nexplore the possible use of microlens arrays (fly-eye light condensers) to\ndramatically improve the transverse uniformity of the drive laser pulse on UV\nphotocathodes. We also demonstrate the use of such microlens arrays to generate\ntransversely-modulated electron beams and present a possible application to\ndiagnose the properties of a magnetized beam.\n", "  Models based on chiral symmetry predict pentaquarks that have relatively low\nmasses. We briefly review both theoretical and experimental status of exotica\nin the light sector. Next, shall show how to extend chiral models to baryons\nwith one heavy quark and show that one expects exotica also in this case.\nFinally, we interpret recently discovered by the LHCb collaboration five\n$\\Omega^*_c$ resonances in terms of regular and exotic excitations of the\nground state $\\Omega_c$.\n", "  A variety of new physics models allows for neutrinos to up-scatter into\nheavier states. If the incident neutrino is energetic enough, the heavy\nneutrino may travel some distance before decaying. In this work, we consider\nthe atmospheric neutrino flux as a source of such events. At IceCube, this\nwould lead to a \"double-bang\" (DB) event topology, similar to what is predicted\nto occur for tau neutrinos at ultra-high energies. The DB event topology has an\nextremely low background rate from coincident atmospheric cascades, making this\na distinctive signature of new physics. Our results indicate that IceCube\nshould already be able to derive new competitive constraints on models with\nGeV-scale sterile neutrinos using existing data.\n", "  Driven-dissipative systems define a broad class of non-equilibrium systems\nwhere an external drive (e.g. laser) competes with a dissipative environment.\nThe steady state of dynamics is generically distinct from a thermal state\ncharacteristic of equilibrium. As a representative example, a\ndriven-dissipative system with a continuous symmetry is generically disordered\nin two dimensions in contrast with the well-known algebraic order in\nequilibrium XY phases. In this paper, we study a 2D driven-dissipative model of\nweakly interacting bosons with a continuous $U(1)$ symmetry. Our aim is\ntwo-fold: First, we show that an effectively equilibrium XY phase emerges\ndespite the driven nature of the model, and that it is protected by a natural\n${\\mathbb Z}_2$ symmetry of the dynamics. Second, we argue that this phase is\nunstable against symmetry-breaking perturbations as well as static disorder,\nwhose mechanism in most cases has no analog in equilibrium. In the language of\nrenormalization group theory, we find that, outside equilibrium, there are more\nrelevant directions away from the XY phase.\n", "  Using two simple examples, the continuous-time random walk as well as a two\nstate Markov chain, the relation between generalized anomalous relaxation\nequations and semi-Markov processes is illustrated. This relation is then used\nto discuss continuous-time random statistics in a general setting, for\nstatistics of convolution-type. Two examples are presented in some detail: the\nsum statistic and the maximum statistic.\n", "  In supersymmetric theories, the gravitino is abundantly produced in the early\nUniverse from thermal scattering, resulting in a strong upper bound on the\nreheat temperature after inflation. We point out that the gravitino problem may\nbe absent or very mild due to the early dynamics of a supersymmetry breaking\nfield, i.e. a sgoldstino. In models of low scale mediation, the field value of\nthe sgoldstino determines the mediation scale and is in general different in\nthe early Universe from the present one. A large initial field value since the\nera of the inflationary reheating suppresses the gravitino production\nsignificantly. We investigate in detail the cosmological evolution of the\nsgoldstino and show that the reheat temperature may be much higher than the\nconventional upper bound, restoring the compatibility with thermal\nleptogenesis.\n", "  The orbital effect on the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) phase is investigated in\nsuperconducting core/shell nanowires subjected to the axial magnetic field. The\nconfinement in the radial direction results in the quantization of the electron\nmotion with energies determined by the radial $j$ and orbital $m$ quantum\nnumbers. In the external magnetic field the twofold degeneracy with respect to\nthe orbital magnetic quantum number $m$ is lifted which leads to the Fermi wave\nvector mismatch between the paired electrons $(k, j,m,\\uparrow) \\leftrightarrow\n(-k, j,-m,\\downarrow)$. This mismatch is transfered to the nonzero total\nmomentum of the Cooper pairs which results in the formation of FF phase\noccurring sequentially with increasing magnetic field. By changing the nanowire\nradius $R$ and the superconducting shell thickness $d$, we discuss the role of\nthe orbital effect in the FF phase formation in both the nanowire-like ($R/d\n\\ll 1$) and nanofilm-like ($R/d \\gg 1$) regime. We have found that the\nirregular pattern of the FF phase, which appears for the case of the\nnanowire-like regime, evolves towards the regular distribution, in which the FF\nphase stability regions appear periodically between the BCS state, for the\nnanofilm-like geometry. The crossover between these two different phase\ndiagrams is explained as resulting from the orbital effect and the multigap\ncharacter of superconductivity in core/shell nanowires.\n", "  Aqueous mixtures of small molecules, such as lower n-alkanols for example,\nare known to be micro-segregated, with domains in the nano-meter range. One\nconsequence of micro-segregated domains would be the existence of long range\ndomain-domain oscillatory correlations in the various atom- atom pair\ncorrelation functions, and subsequent pre-peaks in the corresponding atom atom\nstructure factors, in the q-vector range corresponding to nano-sized domains.\nHowever, no such pre-peak have ever been observed in the large corpus of\nradiation scattering data published so far. Here, through large scale\nsimulations of aqueous-1propanol mixtures, I report that the domain pre-peak\ncontributions in the atom-atom structure factors exactly cancel each other in\nthe total scattering intensity, thus suppressing the pre-peak in agreement with\nthe experimental findings. This cancellation is explained by drawing an analogy\nbetween the charge order found in ionic fluids and the segregated domain order.\nThis finding opens new interpretation of the well known scattering pre-peak\nobserved in micro-emulsions. In particular, it implies that scattering\nexperiment cannot detect homogeneous domain segregation, hence cannot lead to a\nproper microscopic description of atom-atom correlations in domain ordered\nmixtures.\n", "  We develop a model for the description of nonlinear pulse propagation in\nmultimode optical fibers with a parabolic refractive index profile. It consists\nin a 1+1D generalized nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with a periodic\nnonlinear coefficient, which can be solved in an extremely fast and efficient\nway. The model is able to quantitatively reproduce recently observed phenomena\nlike geometric parametric instability and broadband dispersive wave emission.\nWe envisage that our equation will represent a valuable tool for the study of\nspatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics in the growing field of multimode fiber\noptics.\n", "  Bose-Einstein condensates with tunable interatomic interactions have been\nstudied intensely in recent experiments. The investigation of the collapse of a\ncondensate following a sudden change in the nature of the interaction from\nrepulsive to attractive has led to the observation of a remnant condensate that\ndid not undergo further collapse. We suggest that this high-density remnant is\nin fact the absolute minimum of the energy, if the attractive atomic\ninteractions are nonlocal, and is therefore inherently stable. We show that a\nvariational trial function consisting of a superposition of two distinct\ngaussians is an accurate representation of the wavefunction of the ground state\nof the conventional local Gross-Pitaevskii field equation for an attractive\ncondensate and gives correctly the points of emergence of instability. We then\nuse such a superposition of two gaussians as a variational trial function in\norder to calculate the minima of the energy when it includes a nonlocal\ninteraction term. We use experimental data in order to study the long range of\nthe nonlocal interaction, showing that they agree very well with a\ndimensionally derived expression for this range.\n", "  We study CFT2 conformal blocks on a torus and their holographic realization.\nThe classical conformal blocks arising in the regime where conformal dimensions\ngrow linearly with the large central charge are shown to be holographically\ndual to the geodesic networks stretched in the thermal AdS bulk space. We\ndiscuss the n-point conformal blocks and their duals, the 2-point case is\nelaborated in full detail. We develop various techniques to calculate both\nquantum and classical conformal block functions. In particular, we show that\nexponentiated global torus blocks reproduce classical torus blocks in the\nspecific perturbative regimes of the conformal parameter space.\n", "  We measure the mass difference, $\\Delta m_+$, between the $D^{*}(2010)^+$ and\nthe $D^+$ using the decay chain $D^{*}(2010)^+\\to D^+ \\pi^0$ with $D^+\\to\nK^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$. The data were recorded with the BABAR detector at\ncenter-of-mass energies at and near the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance, and\ncorrespond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 468 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$. We\nmeasure $\\Delta m_+ = \\left(140\\,601.0 \\pm 6.8[{\\rm stat}] \\pm 12.9[{\\rm\nsyst}]\\right)$ keV. We combine this result with a previous BABAR measurement of\n$\\Delta m_0\\equiv m(D^{*}(2010)^+) - m (D^0)$ to obtain $\\Delta m_D = m(D^+) -\nm(D^0) = \\left(4\\,824.9 \\pm 6.8[{\\rm stat}] \\pm 12.9[{\\rm syst}]\\right)$ keV.\nThese results are compatible with and approximately five times more precise\nthan the Particle Data Group averages.\n", "  We present results from the first measurement of axial range components of\nfiducialized neutron induced nuclear recoil tracks using the DRIFT directional\ndark matter detector. Nuclear recoil events are fiducialized in the DRIFT\nexperiment using temporal charge carrier separations between different species\nof anions in 30:10:1 Torr of CS$_2$:CF$_4$:O$_2$ gas mixture. For this\nmeasurement, neutron-induced nuclear recoil tracks were generated by exposing\nthe detector to $^{252}$Cf source from different directions. Using these\nevents, the sensitivity of the detector to the expected axial directional\nsignatures were investigated as the neutron source was moved from one detector\naxis to another. Results obtained from these measurements show clear\nsensitivity of the DRIFT detector to the axial directional signatures in this\nfiducialization gas mode.\n", "  Ionized outflows in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to influence\ntheir nuclear and local galactic environment. However, the distance of the\noutflows with respect to the central engine is poorly constrained, which limits\nour understanding of their kinetic power as a cosmic feedback channel.\nTherefore, the impact of AGN outflows on their host galaxies is uncertain.\nHowever, when the density of the outflows is known, their distance can be\nimmediately obtained from their modelled ionization parameter. With the new\nself-consistent PhotoIONization (PION) model in the SPEX code, we are able to\ncalculate detailed level populations, including the ground and metastable\nlevels. This enables us to determine under what physical conditions the\nmetastable levels are significantly populated. We then identify characteristic\nlines from these metastable levels in the 1 -- 2000 {\\AA} wavelength range. In\nthe large density range of $n_H \\in (10^6, 10^{20} m^{-3}$, the metastable\nlevels 2s 2p $(^3P_{0-2})$ in Be-like ions can be significantly populated. For\nB-like ions, merely the first excited level 2s$^2$ 2p $(^2P_{3/2})$ can be used\nas a density probe. For C-like ions, the first two excited levels 2s$^2$ 2p$^2$\n($^3P_1$ and $^3P_2$) are better density probes than the next two excited\nlevels 2s$^2$ 2p$^2$ ($^1S_0$ and $^1D_2$). Different ions in the same\nisoelectronic sequence cover not only a wide range of ionization parameter, but\nalso a wide range of density. On the other hand, within the same isonuclear\nsequence, less ionized ions probe lower density and smaller ionization\nparameter. Finally, we re-analyzed the high-resolution grating spectra of NGC\n5548 observed with Chandra in January 2002, using a set of PION components to\naccount for the ionized outflow. We derive lower (or upper) limits of plasma\ndensity in five out of six PION components, based on the presence (or absence)\nof the metastable absorption lines.\n", "  A new technique based on superposition of two speckle patterns is proposed\nand demonstrated for controlled modulation of the spatial polarization\ndistribution of the resultant speckle. It is demonstrated both theoretically\nand experimentally that controlled modulation of the spatial polarization\ndistribution of laser speckle can be achieved by proper choice of the\npolarization states as well as the average spatial intensity of the constituent\nspeckles. It is also shown that the proposed technique is useful to generate\ndifferent speckle patterns with sinusoidal variation in their degree of\npolarization, which can be tuned from zero to unity. This technique can find\napplications in sensing, biomedical studies, and in determining the rotation of\nthe electric field vector after passing through a scattering medium.\n", "  A six-dimensional symplectic tracking approach exploiting the periodicity\nproperties of Dielectric Laser Acceleration (DLA) gratings is presented. The\nlongitudinal kick is obtained from the spatial Fourier harmonics of the laser\nfield within the structure, and the transverse kicks are obtained using the\nPanofsky-Wenzel theorem. Additionally to the usual, strictly longitudinally\nperiodic gratings, our approach is also applicable to periodicity chirped\n(sub-relativistic) and tilted (deflection) gratings. In the limit of small\nkicks and short periods we obtain the 6D Hamiltonian, which allows, for\nexample, to obtain matched beam distributions in DLAs. The scheme is applied to\nbeam and grating parameters similar to recently performed experiments. The\npaper concludes with an outlook to laser based focusing schemes, which are\npromising to overcome fundamental interaction length limitations, in order to\nbuild an entire microchip-sized laser driven accelerator.\n", "  The non-selective and selective measurements of a self-adjoint observable $A$\nin quantum mechanics are interpreted as `jumps' of the state of the measured\nsystem into a decohered or pure state, respectively, characterized by the\nspectral projections of $A$. However, one may try to describe the measurement\nresults as asymptotic states of a dynamical process, where the non-unitarity of\ntime evolution arises as an effective description of the interaction of the\nmeasured system with the measuring device. The dynamics we present is a\ntwo-step dynamics: the first step is the non-selective measurement or\ndecoherence, which is known to be described by the linear, deterministic\nLindblad equation. The second step is a process from the resulted decohered\nstate to a pure state, which is described by an effective non-linear `randomly\nchosen' toy model dynamics: the pure states arise as asymptotic fixed points,\nand their emergent probabilities are the relative volumes of their attractor\nregions.\n", "  We study the quantum Ising model in the transverse inhomogeneous magnetic\nfield. Such a system can be approached numerically through exact\ndiagonalization and analytically through the renormalization group techniques.\nBasic insights into its physics, however, can be obtained by adopting the\nKibble-Zurek theory of non-equilibrium phase transitions to description of\nspatially inhomogeneous systems at equilibrium. We employ all these approaches\nand focus on derivatives of longitudinal and transverse magnetizations, which\nhave extrema near the critical point. We discuss how these extrema can be used\nfor locating the critical point and for verification of the Kibble-Zurek\nscaling predictions in the spatial quench.\n", "  The scattering equation formalism for scattering amplitudes, and its stringy\nincarnation, the ambitwistor string, remains a mysterious construction. In this\npaper, we pursue the study a gauged-unfixed version of the ambitwistor string\nknown as the null string. We explore the following three aspects in detail; its\ncomplexification, gauge fixing, and amplitudes. We first study the\ncomplexification of the string; the associated symmetries and moduli, and\nconnection to the ambitwistor string. We then look in more details at the\nleftover symmetry algebra of the string, called Galilean conformal algebra; we\nstudy its local and global action and gauge-fixing. We finish by presenting an\noperator formalism, that we use to compute tree-level scattering amplitudes\nbased on the scattering equations and a one-loop partition function. These\nresults hopefully will open the way to understand conceptual questions related\nto the loop expansion in these twistor-like string models.\n", "  Recent works have associated systems of particles, characterized by\nshort-range repulsive interactions and evolving under overdamped motion, to a\nnonlinear Fokker-Planck equation within the class of nonextensive statistical\nmechanics, with a nonlinear diffusion contribution whose exponent is given by\n$\\nu=2-q$. The particular case $\\nu=2$ applies to interacting vortices in\ntype-II superconductors, whereas $\\nu>2$ covers systems of particles\ncharacterized by short-range power-law interactions, where correlations among\nparticles are taken into account. In the former case, several studies presented\na consistent thermodynamic framework based on the definition of an effective\ntemperature $\\theta$ (presenting experimental values much higher than typical\nroom temperatures $T$, so that thermal noise could be neglected), conjugated to\na generalized entropy $s_{\\nu}$ (with $\\nu=2$). Herein, the whole thermodynamic\nscheme is revisited and extended to systems of particles interacting\nrepulsively, through short-ranged potentials, described by an entropy\n$s_{\\nu}$, with $\\nu>1$, covering the $\\nu=2$ (vortices in type-II\nsuperconductors) and $\\nu>2$ (short-range power-law interactions) physical\nexamples. The main results achieved are: (a) The definition of an effective\ntemperature $\\theta$ conjugated to the entropy $s_{\\nu}$; (b) The construction\nof a Carnot cycle, whose efficiency is shown to be\n$\\eta=1-(\\theta_2/\\theta_1)$, where $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the effective\ntemperatures associated with two isothermal transformations, with\n$\\theta_1>\\theta_2$; (c) Thermodynamic potentials, Maxwell relations, and\nresponse functions. The present thermodynamic framework, for a system of\ninteracting particles under the above-mentioned conditions, and associated to\nan entropy $s_{\\nu}$, with $\\nu>1$, certainly enlarges the possibility of\nexperimental verifications.\n", "  In the earlier unitary-model-operator approach (UMOA), one-body correlations\nhave been taken into account approximately by the diagonalization of\nunitary-transformed Hamiltonians in the $0p0h$ and $1p1h$ space. With this\nprescription, the dependence of the harmonic-oscillator energy ($\\hbar\\omega$)\non calculated observables is not negligible even at larger model spaces. In the\npresent work, we explicitly introduce the one-body correlation operator so that\nit optimizes the single-particle basis states and then reduces the\n$\\hbar\\omega$-dependence. For an actual demonstration, we calculate the energy\nand radius for the $^{4}$He ground state with the softened nucleon-nucleon\n($NN$) interactions from Argonne v18 (AV18) and chiral effective field theory\n($\\chi$EFT) up to the next-to-next-to-next leading order (N$^{3}$LO). As a\nresult, we obtain practically $\\hbar\\omega$-free results at sufficiently large\nmodel spaces. The present results are reasonably close to those by the other ab\ninitio calculations with the same $NN$ interactions. This methodological\ndevelopment enables us more systematic analysis of calculation results in the\nUMOA. We also discuss qualitatively the origin of the $\\hbar\\omega$-dependence\non calculated observables in a somewhat simplified way.\n", "  We use a magnetometer probe based on the Zeeman shift of the rubidium\nresonant optical transition to explore the atomic magnetic response for a wide\nrange of field values. We record optical spectra for fields from few tesla up\nto 60 tesla, the limit of the coil producing the magnetic field. The atomic\nabsorption is detected by the fluorescence emissions from a very small region\nwith a submillimiter size. We investigate a wide range of magnetic interactions\nfrom the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime to the fine one, and the transitions\nbetween them. The magnetic field measurement is based on the rubidium\nabsorption itself. The rubidium spectroscopic constants were previously\nmeasured with high precision, except the excited state Land\\'e $g$-factor that\nwe derive from the position of the absorption lines in the transition to the\nfine Paschen-Back regime. Our spectroscopic investigation, even if limited by\nthe Doppler broadening of the absorption lines, measures the field with a 20\nppm uncertainty at the explored high magnetic fields. Its accuracy is limited\nto 75 ppm by the excited state Land\\'e $g$-factor determination.\n", "  For neutral and positively charged atoms and molecules, we prove the\nexistence of infinitely many Hartree-Fock critical points below the first\nenergy threshold (that is, the lowest energy of the same system with one\nelectron removed). This is the equivalent, in Hartree-Fock theory, of the\nfamous Zhislin-Sigalov theorem which states the existence of infinitely many\neigenvalues below the bottom of the essential spectrum of the $N$-particle\nlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger operator. Our result improves a theorem of Lions in 1987\nwho already constructed infinitely many Hartree-Fock critical points, but with\nmuch higher energy. Our main contribution is the proof that the Hartree-Fock\nfunctional satisfies the Palais-Smale property below the first energy\nthreshold. We then use minimax methods in the $N$-particle space, instead of\nworking in the one-particle space.\n", "  We introduce and investigate a system that uses temporal resonance-induced\nphase space pathways to create strong coupling between an atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate and a traveling optical lattice potential. We show that these\npathways thread both the classical and quantum phase space of the atom cloud,\neven when the optical lattice potential is arbitrarily weak. The topology of\nthe pathways, which form web-like patterns, can by controled by changing the\namplitude and period of the optical lattice. In turn, this control can be used\nto increase and limit the BEC's center-of-mass kinetic energy to pre-specified\nvalues. Surprisingly, the strength of the atom-lattice interaction and\nresulting BEC heating of the center-of-mass motion is enhanced by the repulsive\ninter-atomic interactions.\n", "  Under the working hypothesis that the structure of a bound hadron is modified\nby its interactions with other hadrons, one may expect to see changes in\ncarefully chosen observables. In the light of a recent proposal to measure the\naxial charge in the strangeness changing beta-decay of a bound Lambda hyperon,\nwe examine the size of the change expected within the quark-meson coupling\nmodel. It is predicted to be significant.\n", "  Within ab initio Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the leading numerical cost\nfor large systems is the computation of the values of the Slater determinants\nin the trial wavefunction. Each Monte Carlo step requires finding the\ndeterminant of a dense matrix. This is most commonly iteratively evaluated\nusing a rank-1 Sherman-Morrison updating scheme to avoid repeated explicit\ncalculation of the inverse. The overall computational cost is therefore\nformally cubic in the number of electrons or matrix size. To improve the\nnumerical efficiency of this procedure, we propose a novel multiple rank\ndelayed update scheme. This strategy enables probability evaluation with\napplication of accepted moves to the matrices delayed until after a\npredetermined number of moves, K. The accepted events are then applied to the\nmatrices en bloc with enhanced arithmetic intensity and computational\nefficiency via matrix-matrix operations instead of matrix-vector operations.\nThis procedure does not change the underlying Monte Carlo sampling or its\nstatistical efficiency. For calculations on large systems and algorithms such\nas diffusion Monte Carlo where the acceptance ratio is high, order of magnitude\nimprovements in the update time can be obtained on both multi-core CPUs and\nGPUs.\n", "  The RadiaBeam/SLAC dechirper, a structure consisting of pairs of flat,\nmetallic, corrugated plates, %a corrugated structure in flat geometry, has been\ninstalled just upstream of the undulators in the Linac Coherent Light Source\n(LCLS). As a dechirper, with the beam passing between the plates on axis,\nlongitudinal wakefields are induced that can remove unwanted energy chirp in\nthe beam. However, with the beam passing off axis, strong transverse wakes are\nalso induced. This mode of operation has already been used for the production\nof intense, multi-color photon beams using the Fresh-Slice technique, and is\nbeing used to develop a diagnostic for attosecond bunch length measurements.\nHere we measure, as function of offset, the strength of the transverse\nwakefields that are excited between the two plates, and also for the case of\nthe beam passing near to a single plate. We compare with analytical formulas\nfrom the literature, and find good agreement. This report presents the first\nsystematic measurements of the transverse wake strength in a dechirper, one\nthat has been excited by a bunch with the short pulse duration and high energy\nfound in an X-ray free electron laser.\n", "  Accurate prediction of solar activity calls for precise calibration of solar\ncycle models. Consequently we aim to find optimal parameters for models which\ndescribe the physical processes on the solar surface, which in turn act as\nproxies for what occurs in the interior and provide source terms for coronal\nmodels. We use a genetic algorithm to optimize surface flux transport models\nusing National Solar Observatory (NSO) magnetogram data for Solar Cycle 23.\nThis is applied to both a 1D model that inserts new magnetic flux in the form\nof idealized bipolar magnetic regions, and also to a 2D model that assimilates\nspecific shapes of real active regions. The genetic algorithm searches for\nparameter sets (meridional flow speed and profile, supergranular diffusivity,\ninitial magnetic field, and radial decay time) that produce the best fit\nbetween observed and simulated butterfly diagrams, weighted by a\nlatitude-dependent error structure which reflects uncertainty in observations.\nDue to the easily adaptable nature of the 2D model, the optimization process is\nrepeated for Cycles 21, 22, and 24 in order to analyse cycle-to-cycle variation\nof the optimal solution. We find that the ranges and optimal solutions for the\nvarious regimes are in reasonable agreement with results from the literature,\nboth theoretical and observational. The optimal meridional flow profiles for\neach regime are almost entirely within observational bounds determined by\nmagnetic feature tracking, with the 2D model being able to accommodate the mean\nobserved profile more successfully. Differences between models appear to be\nimportant in deciding values for the diffusive and decay terms. In like\nfashion, differences in the behaviours of different solar cycles lead to\ncontrasts in parameters defining the meridional flow and initial field\nstrength.\n", "  We analyzed the evolution data of the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment in\nterms of short-baseline active-sterile neutrino oscillations taking into\naccount the theoretical uncertainties of the reactor antineutrino fluxes. We\nfound that oscillations are disfavored at $2.6\\sigma$ with respect to a\nsuppression of the $^{235}\\text{U}$ reactor antineutrino flux and at\n$2.5\\sigma$ with respect to variations of the $^{235}\\text{U}$ and\n$^{239}\\text{Pu}$ fluxes. On the other hand, the analysis of the rates of the\nshort-baseline reactor neutrino experiments favor active-sterile neutrino\noscillations and disfavor the suppression of the $^{235}\\text{U}$ flux at\n$3.1\\sigma$ and variations of the $^{235}\\text{U}$ and $^{239}\\text{Pu}$ fluxes\nat $2.8\\sigma$. We also found that both the Daya Bay evolution data and the\nglobal rate data are well-fitted with composite hypotheses including variations\nof the $^{235}\\text{U}$ or $^{239}\\text{Pu}$ fluxes in addition to\nactive-sterile neutrino oscillations. A combined analysis of the Daya Bay\nevolution data and the global rate data shows a slight preference for\noscillations with respect to variations of the $^{235}\\text{U}$ and\n$^{239}\\text{Pu}$ fluxes. However, the best fits of the combined data are given\nby the composite models, with a preference for the model with an enhancement of\nthe $^{239}\\text{Pu}$ flux and relatively large oscillations.\n", "  We report the results of simulations of magnetic skyrmion stability in\nultrathin magnetic multilayer nanodots with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nexchange interaction (DMI). We found that in presence of the lateral\nconfinement the magnetostatic energy significantly influences the skyrmion\nstability and leads to stabilization of large radius skyrmion even at low\nvalues of the DMI strength, in addition to small radius skyrmion stabilized by\nDMI. In particular, stabilization of the skyrmion state with two different\nradii (bi-stability) is found in dipolarly-coupled (Pt/Co/Ir)$_{n}$ circular\nnanodots with the number of repeats of the unit cell $n$ = 3 and 5. The\nbi-stability range is located at the DMI strength of 0.9-1.1 mJ/m$^2$ or at the\ntotal Co-layer thickness of 2.2-2.6 nm.\n", "  We study reheating in $\\alpha$-attractor models of inflation in which the\ninflaton couples to other scalars or fermions. We show that the parameter space\ncontains viable regions in which the inflaton couplings to radiation can be\ndetermined from the properties of CMB temperature fluctuations, in particular\nthe spectral index. This may be the only way to measure these fundamental\nmicrophysical parameters, which shaped the universe by setting the initial\ntemperature of the hot big bang and contain important information about the\nembedding of a given model of inflation into a more fundamental theory of\nphysics. The method can be applied to other models of single field inflation.\n", "  We derive the crossing conditions at conical intersections between electronic\nstates in coupled cluster theory, and show that if the coupled cluster Jacobian\nmatrix is nondefective, two (three) independent conditions are correctly placed\non the nuclear degrees of freedom for an inherently real (complex) Hamiltonian.\nCalculations using coupled cluster theory on an $2 {^{1}}A' / 3 {^{1}}A'$\nconical intersection in hypofluorous acid illustrate the nonphysical artifacts\nassociated with defects at accidental same-symmetry intersections. In\nparticular, the observed intersection seam is folded about a space of the\ncorrect dimensionality, indicating that minor modifications to the theory are\nrequired for it to provide a correct description of conical intersections in\ngeneral. We find that an accidental symmetry allowed $1 {^{1}}A\" / 2 {^{1}}A\"$\nintersection in hydrogen sulfide is properly described, showing no artifacts as\nwell as linearity of the energy gap to first order in the branching plane.\n", "  The artificial axon is an excitable node built with the basic biomolecular\ncomponents and supporting action potentials. Here we demonstrate coincidence\nfiring (the AND operation) and other basic electrophysiology features such as\nincreasing firing rates for increasing input currents. We construct the basic\nunit for a network by connecting two such excitable nodes through an electronic\nsynapse, producing pre/post synaptic behavior in which one axon induces firing\nin another. We show that the system is well described by the Hodgkin-Huxley\nmodel of nerve excitability, and conclude with a brief outlook for realizing\nlarge networks of such low voltage \"ionics\".\n", "  Recently, Nishiura and the author have proposed a unified quark-lepton mass\nmatrix model under a family symmetry U(3)$\\times$U(3)$'$. The model can give\nexcellent parameter-fitting to the observed quark and neutrino data. The model\nhas a reasonable basis as far as the quark sector, but the form of the\nright-handed neutrino mass matrix $M_R$ does not have a theoretical grand, that\nis, it was nothing but a phenomenological assumption. In this paper, it is\npointed out that the form of $M_R$ is originated in structure of neutrino mass\nmatrix for $(\\nu_i, N_\\alpha)$ where $\\nu_i$ ($i=1,2,3$) and $N_\\alpha$\n($\\alpha=1,2,3$) are U(3)-family and U(3)$'$-family triplets, respectively.\n", "  It is shown that the enthalpy of any close packed structure for a given\nelement can be characterised as a linear expansion in a set of continuous\nvariables $\\alpha_n$ which describe the stacking configuration. This enables us\nto represent the infinite, discrete set of stacking sequences within a finite,\ncontinuous space of the expansion parameters $H_n$. These $H_n$ determine the\nstable structure and vary continuously in the thermodynamic space of pressure,\ntemperature or composition. The continuity of both spaces means that only\ntransformations between stable structures adjacent in the $H_n$ space are\npossible, giving the model predictive and well as descriptive ability. We\ncalculate the $H_n$ using density functional theory and interatomic potentials\nfor a range of materials. Some striking results are found: e.g. the\nLennard-Jones potential model has 11 possible stable structures and over 50\nphase transitions as a function of cutoff range. The very different phase\ndiagrams of Sc, Tl, Y and the lanthanides are understood within a single\ntheory. We find that the widely-reported 9R-fcc transition is not allowed in\nequilibrium thermodynamics, and in cases where it has been reported in\nexperiments (Li, Na), we show that DFT theory is also unable to predict it.\n", "  We study the analytic structure of the resummed graviton propagator, inspired\nby the possible existence of black hole precursors in its spectrum. We find an\ninfinite number of poles with positive mass, but both positive and negative\neffective width, and studied their asymptotic behaviour in the infinite sheet\nRiemann surface. We find that the stability of these precursors depend\ncrucially on the value of the normalisation point scale.\n", "  Heterotic orbifolds can explain the origin of flavor symmetries and the\nflavor representations of matter fields in particle physics as a result of the\ngeometric properties of the associated string states in the compact space.\nAfter a review of the method to obtain flavor symmetries in these models, we\ndetermine the most frequent non-Abelian flavor symmetries appearing in\npromising Abelian heterotic orbifolds. Interestingly, these symmetries\ncorrespond only to D_4, Delta(54) and products of these symmetries and Abelian\nfactors. A large set of promising models exhibits purely Abelian flavor\nsymmetries. We finally explore the phenomenological potential of a sample model\nendowed with Delta(54) assuming certain ad hoc flavon expectation values.\n", "  The optical excitation spectra and excitonic resonances are investigated in\nsystematically functionalized SiC with Fluorine and/or Chlorine utilizing\ndensity functional theory in combination with many-body perturbation theory.\nThe latter is required for a realistic description of the energy band-gaps as\nwell as for the theoretical realization of excitons. Structural, electronic and\noptical properties are scrutinized and show the high stability of the predicted\ntwo-dimensional materials. Their realization in laboratory is thus possible.\nHuge band-gaps of the order of 4 eV are found in the so-called GW\napproximation, with the occurrence of bright excitons, optically active in the\nfour investigated materials. Their binding energies vary from 0.9 eV to 1.75 eV\ndepending on the decoration choice and in one case, a dark exciton is foreseen\nto exist in the fully chlorinated SiC. The wide variety of opto-electronic\nproperties suggest halogenated SiC as interesting materials with potential not\nonly for solar cell applications, anti-reflection coatings or high-reflective\nsystems but also for a possible realization of excitonic Bose-Einstein\ncondensation.\n", "  Featuring spin-valley degree of freedom by a magnetic exchange\nfield-induction to gain transport of charge carriers through a junction based\non superconducting subgap tunneling can provide a new scenario for future\nelectronics. Transmission of low-energy Dirac-like electron (hole)\nquasiparticles through a ferromagnet/superconductor (F/S) interface can be of\nnoticeable importance due to strong spin-orbit coupling in the valence band of\nmonolayer $MoS_2$ (ML-MDS). The magnetic exchange field (MEF) of a\nferromagnetic section on top of ML-MDS may affect the electron (hole)\nexcitations for spin-up and spin-down electrons, differently. Tuning the MEF\nenables one to control either electrical properties (such as band gap, SOC and\netc.) or spin-polarized transport. We study the influence of MEF on the\nchirality of Andreev resonant state (ARS) appearing at the relating F/S\ninterface, in which the induced pairing order parameter is chiral $p$-wave\nsymmetry. The resulting normal conductance is found to be more sensitive to the\nmagnitude of MEF and doping regime of F region. Unconventional spin-triplet\n$p$-wave symmetry features the zero-bias conductance, which strongly depends on\n$p$-doping level of F region in the relating NFS junction.\n", "  A two-step photoionization strategy of an ultracold rubidium beam for\napplication in a focused ion beam instrument is analyzed and implemented. In\nthis strategy the atomic beam is partly selected with an aperture after which\nthe transmitted atoms are ionized in the overlap of a tightly cylindrically\nfocused excitation laser beam and an ionization laser beam whose power is\nenhanced in a build-up cavity. The advantage of this strategy, as compared to\nwithout the use of a build-up cavity, is that higher ionization degrees can be\nreached at higher currents. Optical Bloch equations including the\nphotoionization process are used to calculate what ionization degree and\nionization position distribution can be reached. Furthermore, the ionization\nstrategy is tested on an ultracold beam of $^{85}$Rb atoms. The beam current is\nmeasured as a function of the excitation and ionization laser beam intensity\nand the selection aperture size. Although details are different, the global\ntrends of the measurements agree well with the calculation. With a selection\naperture diameter of 52 $\\mu$m, a current of $\\left(170\\pm4\\right)$ pA is\nmeasured, which according to calculations is 63% of the current equivalent of\nthe transmitted atomic flux. Taking into account the ionization degree the ion\nbeam peak reduced brightness is estimated at $1\\times10^7$ A/(m$^2\\,$sr$\\,$eV).\n", "  Stabilizing vortex solitons with high values of the topological charge, S, is\na challenging issue in optics, studies of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and\nother fields. To develop a new approach to the solution of this problem, we\nconsider a two-dimensional dipolar BEC under the action of an axisymmetric\nradially periodic lattice potential, $V(r)\\sim \\cos (2r+\\delta )$, with dipole\nmoments polarized perpendicular to the system's plane, which gives rise to\nisotropic repulsive dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs). Two radial lattices are\nconsidered, with $\\delta =0$ and $\\pi $, i.e., a potential maximum or minimum\nat $r=0$, respectively. Families of vortex gapsoliton (GSs) with $S=1$ and\n$S\\geq 2$, the latter ones often being unstable in other settings, are\ncompletely stable in the present system (at least, up to $S=11$), being trapped\nin different annular troughs of the radial potential. The vortex solitons with\ndifferent $S$ may stably coexist in sufficiently far separated troughs.\nFundamental GSs, with $S=0$, are found too. In the case of $\\delta =0$, the\nfundamental solitons are ring-shaped modes, with a local minimum at $r=0.$At\n$\\delta =\\pi $, they place a density peak at the center.\n", "  The interplay between Anderson localization and total internal reflection of\nelectromagnetic waves incident near the critical angle on randomly-stratified\ndielectric media is investigated theoretically. Using an exact analytical\nformula for the localization length for the Schr\\\"odinger equation with a\nGaussian $\\delta$-correlated random potential in one dimension, we show that\nwhen the incident angle is equal to the critical angle, the localization length\nfor an incident $s$ wave of wavelength $\\lambda$ is directly proportional to\n$\\lambda^{4/3}$ throughout the entire range of the wavelength, for any value of\nthe disorder strength. This result is different from that of a recent study\nreporting that the localization length at the critical incident angle for a\nbinary multilayer system with random thickness variations is proportional to\n$\\lambda$ in the large $\\lambda$ region. We also discuss the characteristic\nbehaviors of the localization length or the tunneling decay length for all\nother incident angles. Our results are confirmed by an independent numerical\ncalculation based on the invariant imbedding method.\n", "  After reviewing the description of an unstable state in the framework of Lee\nHamiltonians (valid both for Quantum Mechanics (QM) and Quantum Field Theory\n(QFT)), we consider some theoretical aspects of non-exponential decays: the\ncase of two decay channels, the broadening of the energy spectrum at short\ntimes, the effect of an imperfect measurement, the link to QFT, and the decay\nof an unstable moving particle with definite momentum. All the presented\neffects were not confirmed in experiments, hence are at the present stage\npredictions.\n", "  Based on systematic analyses of several popular non-relativistic energy\ndensity functionals with mean-field approximation, we estimate the value of the\nfourth-order symmetry energy $E_{\\text{sym,4}}(\\rho)$ at nuclear normal density\n$\\rho_0$ and its density dependence, and explore the correlation between\n$E_{\\text{sym,4}}(\\rho_0)$ and other macroscopic quantities of nuclear matter\nproperties. We use the empirical values of some nuclear macroscopic quantities\nto construct model parameter sets by Monte Carlo method for the conventional\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model, the extended Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (eSHF) model,\nthe Gogny-Hartree-Fock (GHF) model, and the momentum-dependent interaction\n(MDI) model. The value of $E_{\\text{sym,4}}(\\rho_0)$ is estimated to be\n$1.02\\pm0.49$ MeV for the SHF model, $1.02\\pm0.50$ MeV for the eSHF model,\n$0.70\\pm0.60$ MeV for the GHF model, and $0.74\\pm0.63$ MeV for the MDI model.\nMoreover, our results indicate that the density dependence of\n$E_{\\text{sym,4}}(\\rho)$ is model dependent, especially at higher densities.\nFurthermore, we find that the $E_{\\text{sym},4}(\\rho_0)$ has strong positive\n(negative) correlation with isoscalar (isovector) nucleon effective mass\n$m_{s,0}^*$ ($m_{v,0}^*$) at $\\rho_0$. In particular, for the SHF and eSHF\nmodels, the $E_{\\text{sym,4}}(\\rho)$ is completely determined by the isoscalar\nand isovector nucleon effective masses $m_{s}^*(\\rho)$ and $m_{v}^*(\\rho)$, and\nthe analytical expression is given. In the mean-field models, the magnitude of\n$ E_{\\text{sym,4}}(\\rho_0)$ is generally less than $2$ MeV, and its density\ndependence depends on models, especially at higher densities. $\nE_{\\text{sym,4}}(\\rho_0)$ is strongly correlated with $m_{s,0}^*$ and\n$m_{v,0}^*$.\n", "  Redfield theory provides a closed kinetic description of a quantum system in\nweak contact with a very dense reservoir. Landau-Zener theory does the same for\na time-dependent driven system in contact with a sparse reservoir. Using a\nsimple model, we analyze the validity of these two theories by comparing their\npredictions with exact numerical results. We show that despite their a priori\ndifferent range of validity, these two descriptions can give rise to an\nidentical quantum master equation. Both theories can be used for a\nnonequilibrium thermodynamic description which we show is consistent with exact\nthermodynamic identities evaluated in the full system-reservoir space. We\nemphasize the importance of properly accounting for the system-reservoir\ninteraction energy and of operating in regimes where the reservoir can be\nconsidered as close to ideal.\n", "  Recent discovery of transport anomaly in graphene demonstrated that a system\nknown to be weakly interacting may become strongly correlated if system\nparameter(s) can be tuned such that fermi surface is sufficiently small. We\nstudy the strong correlation effects in the transport coefficients of Dirac\nmaterials doped with magnetic impurity under the magnetic field using\nholographic method. The experimental data of magneto-conductivity are well fit\nby our theory, however, not much data are available for other transports of\nDirac material in such regime. Therefore, our results on heat\ntransport,thermo-electric power and Nernst coefficients are left as predictions\nof holographic theory for generic Dirac materials in the vicinity of charge\nneutral point with possible surface gap. We give detailed look over each\nmagneto-transport observable and 3Dplots to guide future experiments.\n", "  CK Vul is a star whose outburst was observed in 1670-72. A stellar-merger\nevent was proposed to explain its ancient eruption. Aims: We aim to investigate\nthe composition of the molecular gas recently discovered in the remnant of CK\nVul. Methods: We observed millimeter and submillimeter-wave spectra of CK Vul\nusing the IRAM 30m and APEX telescopes. Radiative-transfer modeling of the\nobserved molecular features was performed to yield isotopic ratios for various\nelements. Results: The spectra of CK Vul reveal a very rich molecular\nenvironment of low excitation ($T_{\\rm ex} \\lesssim$12 K). Atomic carbon and\ntwenty seven different molecules, including two ions, were identified. They\nrange from simple diatomic to complex polyatomic species of up to 7 atoms\nlarge. The chemical composition of the molecular gas is indicative of carbon\nand nitrogen-driven chemistry but oxides are also present. Additionally, the\nabundance of F may be enhanced. The spectra are rich in isotopologues that are\nvery rare in most known sources. All stable isotopes of C, N, O, Si, and S are\nobserved and their isotopic ratios are derived. Conclusions: The composition of\nthe remnant's molecular gas is most peculiar and gives rise to a very unique\nmillimeter and submillimeter spectrum. The observation of ions and complex\nmolecules suggests the presence of a photoionizing source but its nature (a\ncentral star or shocks) remains unknown. The elemental and isotopic composition\nof the gas cannot be easily reconciled with standard nucleosynthesis but\nprocessing in hot CNO cycles and partial He burning can explain most of the\nchemical peculiarities. The isotopic ratios of CK Vul are remarkably close to\nthose of presolar nova grains but the link of Nova 1670 to objects responsible\nfor these grains is unclear.\n", "  When a flow of electron passes through a paramagnetic layer with strong\nspin-orbit-coupling such as platinum (Pt), a net spin current is produced via\nspin Hall effect (SHE). This spin current can exert a torque on the\nmagnetization of an adjacent ferromagnetic layer which can be probed via\nmagnetization dynamic response, e.g. spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance\n(ST-FMR). Nevertheless, that effect in lower frequency magnetization dynamic\nregime (MHz) where skin effect occurs in high permeability ferromagnetic\nconductors namely the magneto-impedance (MI) effect can be fundamentally\nimportant which has not been studied so far. Here, by utilizing the MI effect\nin magnetic-ribbon/Pt heterostructure with high magnetic permeability that\nallows the ac current effectively confined at the skin depth of ~100 nm\nthickness, the effect of spin-orbit-torque (SOT) induced by the SHE probed via\nMI measurement is investigated. We observed a systematic MI frequency shift\nthat increases by increasing the applied current amplitude and thickness of the\nPt layer (varying from 0 nm to 20 nm). In addition, the role of Pt layer in\nribbon/Pt heterostructure is evaluated with ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)\neffect representing standard Gilbert damping increase as the result of presence\nof the SHE. Our results unveil the role of SOT in dynamic control of the\ntransverse magnetic permeability probed with impedance spectroscopy as useful\nand valuable technique for detection of future SHE devices.\n", "  Recently introduced angular-memory-effect based techniques enable\nnon-invasive imaging of objects hidden behind thin scattering layers. However,\nboth the speckle-correlation and the bispectrum analysis are based on the\nstatistical average of large amounts of speckle grains, which determines that\nthey can hardly access the important information of the point-spread-function\n(PSF) of a highly scattering imaging system. Here, inspired by notions used in\nastronomy, we present a phase-diversity speckle imaging scheme, based on\nrecording a sequence of intensity speckle patterns at various imaging planes,\nand experimentally demonstrate that in addition to being able to retrieve\ndiffraction-limited image of hidden objects, phase-diversity can also\nsimultaneously estimate the pupil function and the PSF of a highly scattering\nimaging system without any guide-star nor reference.\n", "  We study the properties of two-flavor quark matter in the Dyson-Schwinger\nmodel and investigate the possible consequences for hybrid neutron stars, with\nparticular regard to the two-solar-mass limit. We find that with some extreme\nvalues of the model parameters, the mass fraction of two-flavor quark matter in\nheavy neutron stars can be as high as 30 percent and the possible energy\nrelease during the conversion from nucleonic neutron stars to hybrid stars can\nreach $10^{52}\\;$erg.\n", "  The recent discovery by LHCb of the first doubly-charmed baryon\n$\\Xi_{cc}^{++} = ccu$ at $3621.40 \\pm 0.78$ MeV implies a large binding energy\n$\\sim 130$ MeV between the two $c$ quarks. This strong binding enables a\nquark-rearrangement exothermic reaction $\\,\\Lambda_c \\Lambda_c \\to\n\\Xi_{cc}^{++}\\,n\\,$ with $Q=12$ MeV, which is a quark-level analogue of\ndeuterium-tritium nuclear fusion reaction $DT\\to {}^4{\\rm He}\\,n$. Due to much\nlarger binding energy between two $b$ quarks $\\sim 280$ MeV, the analogous\nreaction with $b$ quarks, $\\,\\Lambda_b \\Lambda_b \\to \\Xi_{bb}\\,N\\,$ is expected\nto have a dramatically larger $Q$-value, $138\\pm 12$ MeV.\n", "  Numerical simulations of turbulent round jets, using explicit-filtered LES\ntechnique, are performed, for three different Reynolds numbers(Re = 3600,\n88000, 400000), to understand the Reynolds number effect on subsonic jets with\nMach number 0.9. Eigth-order compact schemes are used for spatial derivative\nestimation. Second order Runge-Kutta method is used for Time evolution of flow.\nOne-parameter fourth-order compact filter is used for low-pass explicit\nfiltering of transported variables. Decreased centreline axial velocity decay\nrate and reduced turbulence intensities are observed as jet Reynolds number\nincreases. Jet spread-rate is observed to be independent of the Reynolds\nnumber. An early potential-core collapse and transition to turbulent regime is\nobserved in jets with high Reynolds number, for same inflow turbulence seeding.\nRole of increased smaller length scales with increase in Reynolds number is\nanalyzed. It is observed that behavior of turbulent round jets is similar to\nthat of plane jets, irrespective of gain in dimensional freedom. Detailed\ndiscussions of the observations made from numerical experiments are presented.\n", "  We propose an extension of the standard model introducing large $SU(2)_L$\nmultiplet fields which are quartet and septet scalars and quintet Majorana\nfermions. These multiplets can induce the neutrino masses via interactions with\nthe $SU(2)$ doublet leptons. We then find the neutrino masses are suppressed by\nsmall vacuum expectation value of the quartet/septet and an inverse of quintet\nfermion mass relaxing the Yukawa hierarchies among the standard model fermions.\nWe also discuss collider physics at the Large Hadron Collider considering\nproduction of charged particles in these multiplets, and due to effects of\nviolating custodial symmetry, some specific signatures can be found. Then we\ndiscuss the detectability of these signals.\n", "  We conducted a detailed radiative transfer modeling of the dust emission from\nthe circumstellar disk around HL Tau. The goal of our study is to derive the\nsurface density profile of the inner disk and its structure. In addition to the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array images at Band 3 (2.9mm), Band 6\n(1.3mm), and Band 7 (0.87mm), the most recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\n(VLA) observations at 7mm were included in the analysis. A simulated annealing\nalgorithm was invoked to search for the optimum model. The radiative transfer\nanalysis demonstrates that most radial components (i.e., >6AU) of the disk\nbecome optically thin at a wavelength of 7mm, which allows us to constrain, for\nthe first time, the dust density distribution in the inner region of the disk.\nWe found that a homogeneous grain size distribution is not sufficient to\nexplain the observed images at different wavelengths simultaneously, while\nmodels with a shallower grain size distribution in the inner disk work well. We\nfound clear evidence that larger grains are trapped in the first bright ring.\nOur results imply that dust evolution has already taken place in the disk at a\nrelatively young (i.e., ~1Myr) age. We compared the midplane temperature\ndistribution, optical depth, and properties of various dust rings with those\nreported previously. Using the Toomre parameter, we briefly discussed the\ngravitational instability as a potential mechanism for the origin of the dust\nclump detected in the first bright ring via the VLA observations.\n", "  Whilst the performance of small THGEMs is well known, here we consider the\nchallenges in scaling these up to large area charge readouts. We first verify\nthe expected gain of larger THGEMs by reporting experimental Townsend\ncoefficients for a 10 cm diameter THGEM in low-pressure CF$_4$. Large area 50\ncm by 50 cm THGEMs were sourced from a commercial PCB supplier and geometrical\nimperfections were observed which we quantified using an optical camera setup.\nThe large area THGEMs were experimentally characterised at Boulby Underground\nLaboratory through a series of gain calibrations and alpha spectrum\nmeasurements. ANSYS, Magboltz and Garfield++ simulations of the design of a TPC\nbased on the large area THGEMs are presented. We also consider their\nimplications for directional dark matter research and potential applications\nwithin nuclear security.\n", "  Multi-time wave functions are wave functions for multi-particle quantum\nsystems that involve several time variables (one per particle). In this paper\nwe contrast them with solutions of wave equations on a space-time with multiple\ntimelike dimensions, i.e., on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold whose metric has\nsignature such as ${+}{+}{-}{-}$ or ${+}{+}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}$, instead of\n${+}{-}{-}{-}$. Despite the superficial similarity, the two behave very\ndifferently: Whereas wave equations in multiple timelike dimensions are\ntypically mathematically ill-posed and presumably unphysical, relevant\nSchr\\\"odinger equations for multi-time wave functions possess for every initial\ndatum a unique solution on the spacelike configurations and form a natural\ncovariant representation of quantum states.\n", "  In recent work, globally well-defined Type IIB supergravity solutions with\ngeometry $AdS_6 \\times S^2$ warped over a Riemann surface $\\Sigma$ were\nconstructed and conjectured to describe the near-horizon geometry of $(p,q)$\nfive-brane webs in the conformal limit. In the present paper, we offer more\nevidence for this interpretation of the supergravity solutions in terms of\nfive-brane webs. In particular, we explore the behavior of probe\n$(p,q)$-strings in certain families of these $AdS_6 \\times S^2\\times \\Sigma$\nbackgrounds and compare this behavior to that predicted by microscopic, brane\nweb considerations. In the microscopic picture, we argue that the embedding of\na probe string may give rise to the formation of string junctions involving\nopen strings anchored on the branes of the web. We then identify a quantity on\nthe supergravity side that is conjectured to be equivalent to the total\njunction tension in a class of backgrounds corresponding to brane webs with\nfour semi-infinite external five-branes. In the process, we will show that for\ngeneral brane web backgrounds, the minimal energy probe string embeddings do\nnot coincide with the embeddings preserving half of the background\nsupersymmetries.\n", "  The detailed atomistic modeling of electrochemically deposited metal\nmonolayers is challenging due to the complex structure of the metal-solution\ninterface and the critical effects of surface elec- trification during\nelectrode polarization. Accurate models of interfacial electrochemical\nequilibria are further challenged by the need to include entropic effects to\nobtain accurate surface chemical potentials. We present an embedded\nquantum-continuum model of the interfacial environment that addresses each of\nthese challenges and study the underpotential deposition of silver on the gold\n(100) surface. We leverage these results to parameterize a cluster expansion of\nthe electrified in- terface and show through grand canonical Monte Carlo\ncalculations the crucial need to account for variations in the interfacial\ndipole when modeling electrodeposited metals under finite-temperature\nelectrochemical conditions.\n", "  The recently introduced mixed time-averaging semiclassical initial value\nrepresentation molecular dynamics method for spectroscopic calculations [M.\nBuchholz, F. Grossmann, and M. Ceotto, J. Chem. Phys. 144, 094102 (2016)] is\napplied to systems with up to 61 dimensions, ruled by a condensed phase\nCaldeira-Leggett model potential. By calculating the ground state as well as\nthe first few excited states of the system Morse oscillator, changes of both\nthe harmonic frequency and the anharmonicity are determined. The method\nfaithfully reproduces blueshift and redshift effects and the importance of the\ncounter term, as previously suggested by other methods. Differently from\nprevious methods, the present semiclassical method does not take advantage of\nthe specific form of the potential and it can represent a practical tool that\nopens the route to direct ab initio semiclassical simulation of condensed phase\nsystems.\n", "  We extend our recently-developed heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI)\nalgorithm, and our semistochastic algorithm for performing multireference\nperturbation theory, to the calculation of excited-state wavefunctions and\nenergies. We employ time-reversal symmetry, which reduces the memory\nrequirements by more than a factor of two. An extrapolation technique is\nintroduced to reliably extrapolate HCI energies to the Full CI limit. The\nresulting algorithm is used to compute the twelve lowest-lying potential energy\nsurfaces of the carbon dimer using the cc-pV5Z basis set, with an estimated\nerror in energy of 30-50 {\\mu}Ha compared to Full CI. The excitation energies\nobtained using our algorithm have a mean absolute deviation of 0.02 eV compared\nto experimental values. We also calculate the complete active-space (CAS)\nenergies of the S0, S1, and T0 states of tetracene, which are of relevance to\nsinglet fission, by fully correlating active spaces as large as 18 electrons in\n36 orbitals.\n", "  The evanescent field surrounding nano-scale optical waveguides offers an\nefficient interface between light and mesoscopic ensembles of neutral atoms.\nHowever, the thermal motion of trapped atoms, combined with the strong radial\ngradients of the guided light, leads to a time-modulated coupling between atoms\nand the light mode, thus giving rise to additional noise and motional dephasing\nof collective states. Here, we present a dipole force free scheme for coupling\nof the radial motional states, utilizing the strong intensity gradient of the\nguided mode and demonstrate all-optical coupling of the cesium hyperfine ground\nstates and motional sideband transitions. We utilize this to prolong the trap\nlifetime of an atomic ensemble by Raman sideband cooling of the radial motion,\nwhich has not been demonstrated in nano-optical structures previously. Our work\npoints towards full and independent control of internal and external atomic\ndegrees of freedom using guided light modes only.\n", "  Trilobites are exotic giant dimers with enormous dipole moments. They consist\nof a Rydberg atom and a distant ground-state atom bound together by short-range\nelectron-neutral attraction. We show that highly polar, polyatomic trilobite\nstates unexpectedly persist and thrive in a dense ultracold gas of randomly\npositioned atoms. This is caused by perturbation-induced quantum scarring and\nthe localization of electron density on randomly occurring atom clusters. At\ncertain densities these states also mix with a s-state, overcoming selection\nrules that hinder the photoassociation of ordinary trilobites.\n", "  We compute the renormalisation factors (Z-matrices) of the $\\Delta F=2$\nfour-quark operators needed for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) kaon mixing. We\nwork with nf=2+1 flavours of Domain-Wall fermions whose chiral-flavour\nproperties are essential to maintain a continuum-like mixing pattern. We\nintroduce new RI-SMOM renormalisation schemes, which we argue are better\nbehaved compared to the commonly-used corresponding RI-MOM one. We find that,\nonce converted to MS, the Z-factors computed through these RI-SMOM schemes are\nin good agreement but differ significantly from the ones computed through the\nRI-MOM scheme. The RI-SMOM Z-factors presented here have been used to compute\nthe BSM neutral kaon mixing matrix elements in the companion paper [1]. We\nargue that the renormalisation procedure is responsible for the discrepancies\nobserved by different collaborations, we will investigate and elucidate the\norigin of these differences throughout this work.\n", "  The local dynamics of the lead-free relaxor\n$0.964\\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\\mathrm{TiO}_3-0.036\\mathrm{BaTiO}_3$\n(NBT-3.6BT) have been investigated by a combination of quasielastic neutron\nscattering (QENS) and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In a previous\npaper, we were able to show that the tetragonal platelets in the microstructure\nare crucial for understanding the dielectric properties of NBT-3.6BT [F. Pforr\net al., Phys. Rev. B 94, 014105 (2016)]. To investigate their dynamics, ab\ninitio molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using\n$\\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\\mathrm{TiO}_3$ with 001 cation order as a\nsimple model system for the tetragonal platelets in NBT-3.6BT. Similarly,\n111-ordered $\\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\\mathrm{TiO}_3$ was used as a\nmodel for the rhombohedral matrix. The measured single crystal QENS spectra\ncould be reproduced by a linear combination of calculated spectra. We find that\nthe relaxational dynamics of NBT-3.6BT are concentrated in the tetragonal\nplatelets. Chaotic stages, during which the local tilt order changes\nincessantly on the timescale of several picoseconds, cause the most significant\ncontribution to the quasielastic intensity. They can be regarded as an excited\nstate of tetragonal platelets, whose relaxation back into a quasistable state\nmight explain the frequency dependence of the dielectric properties of\nNBT-3.6BT in the 100 GHz to THz range. This substantiates the assumption that\nthe relaxor properties of NBT-3.6BT originate from the tetragonal platelets.\n", "  We show that near-horizon geometries in the presence of a positive\ncosmological constant cannot exist with ring topology. In particular, de Sitter\nblack rings with vanishing surface gravity do not exist. Our result relies on a\nknown mathematical theorem which is a straightforward consequence of a type of\nenergy condition for a modified Ricci tensor, similar to the\ncurvature-dimension conditions for the $m$-Bakry-\\'Emery-Ricci tensor.\n", "  We report the observation of a nonlinear elastoresistivity response for the\nprototypical underdoped iron pnictide Ba(Fe$_{0.975}$Co$_{0.025}$)$_2$As$_2$.\nOur measurements reveal a large quadratic term in the isotropic ($A_{1g}$)\nelectronic response that was produced by a purely shear ($B_{2g}$) strain. The\ndivergence of this quantity upon cooling towards the structural phase\ntransition reflects the temperature dependence of the nematic susceptibility.\nThis observation shows that nematic fluctuations play a significant role in\ndetermining even the isotropic properties of this family of compounds.\n", "  Commented translation of the paper \"Universelle Bedeutung des\nWirkungsquantums\", published by Jun Ishiwara in German in the Proceedings of\nTokyo Mathematico-Physical Society 8 106-116 (1915). In his work, Ishiwara,\ntenured at Sendai University, Japan, proposed - simultaneously with Arnold\nSommerfeld, William Wilson and Niels Bohr in Europe - the pase-space-integral\nquantization, a rule that would be incorporated into the old-quantum-mechanics\nformalism.\n", "  A theoretical analysis for the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) instability\ndriven by two laser beams with certain frequency difference is presented. It is\nfound that strong coupling and enhanced SRS take place only when the unstable\nregions for each beam are overlapped in the wavenumber space. Hence a threshold\nof the beam frequency difference for their decoupling is found as a function of\ntheir intensity and plasma density. Based upon this, a strategy to suppress the\nSRS instability with decoupled broadband lasers (DBLs) is proposed. A DBL can\nbe composed of tens or even hundreds of beamlets, where the beamlets are\ndistributed uniformly in a broad spectrum range such as over 10\\% of the\ncentral frequency. Decoupling among the beamlets is found due to the limited\nbeamlet energy and suitable frequency difference between neighboring beamlets.\nParticle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that SRS can be almost completely\nsuppressed with DBLs under the laser intensity $\\sim10^{15}$ W/cm$^2$. DBLs can\nbe attractive for driving inertial confined fusion.\n", "  We have measured antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) frequency-field\ndependences for aluminum-manganese garnet Mn$_{3}$Al$_{2}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{12}$ at\nfrequencies from 1 to 125 GHz and at the fields up to 60 kOe. Three AFMR modes\nwere observed for all orientations, their zero field gaps are about 40 and 70\nGHz. Andreev-Marchenko hydrodynamic theory [Sov. Phys. Usp. 130, 39 (1980)]\nwell describes experimental frequency-field dependences. We have observed\nhysteresis of resonance absorption as well as history dependence of resonance\nabsorption near gap frequencies below 10 kOe in all three measured field\norientations, which are supposedly due to the sample domain structure.\nObservation of the AFMR signal at the frequencies from 1 to 5 GHz allows to\nestimate repulsion of nuclear and electron modes of spin precession in the\nvicinity of spin-reorientation transition at H||[100].\n", "  Aims: We quantify the effects of twisted magnetic fields on the development\nof the magnetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in transversely oscillating\ncoronal loops. Methods: We modelled a fundamental standing kink mode in a\nstraight, density-enhanced magnetic flux tube using the magnetohydrodynamics\ncode, Lare3d. In order to evaluate the impact of an azimuthal component of the\nmagnetic field, various degrees of twist were included within the flux tube's\nmagnetic field. Results: The process of resonant absorption is only weakly\naffected by the presence of a twisted magnetic field. However, the subsequent\nevolution of the KHI is sensitive to the strength of the azimuthal component of\nthe field. Increased twist values inhibit the deformation of the loop's density\nprofile, which is associated with the growth of the instability. Despite this,\nmuch smaller scales in the magnetic field are generated when there is a\nnon-zero azimuthal component present. Hence, the instability is more energetic\nin cases with (even weakly) twisted fields. Field aligned flows at the loop\napex are established in a twisted regime once the instability has formed.\nConclusions: The KHI may have implications for wave heating in the solar\natmosphere due to the creation of small length scales and the generation of a\nturbulent regime. Whilst magnetic twist does suppress the development of the\nvortices associated with the instability, the formation of the KHI in a twisted\nregime will be accompanied by greater Ohmic dissipation due to the larger\ncurrents that are produced, even if only weak twist is present. The presence of\nmagnetic twist will likely make the instability more difficult to detect in the\ncorona, but will enhance its contribution to heating the solar atmosphere.\n", "  Spin orbit coupling in heavy metals allows conversion of unpolarized light\ninto an open-circuit voltage. We experimentally prove that this photo-spin\nvoltaic effect is due to photo-excitation of carriers in the proximized layer\nand can exist for light in the visible range. While carrying out the\nexperiment, we discovered that, in closed-circuit conditions, the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance of the proximized metal is a function of the light intensity.\nWe name this effect photo-magnetoresistance. A magneto-transport model is\npresented that describes the change of magnetoresistance as a function of the\nlight intensity.\n", "  For photon-counting applications at ultraviolet wavelengths, there are\ncurrently no detectors that combine high efficiency (> 50%), sub-nanosecond\ntiming resolution, and sub-Hz dark count rates. Superconducting nanowire\nsingle-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have seen success over the past decade for\nphoton-counting applications in the near-infrared, but little work has been\ndone to optimize SNSPDs for wavelengths below 400 nm. Here, we describe the\ndesign, fabrication, and characterization of UV SNSPDs operating at wavelengths\nbetween 250 and 370 nm. The detectors have active areas up to 56 ${\\mu}$m in\ndiameter, 70 - 80% efficiency, timing resolution down to 60 ps FWHM, blindness\nto visible and infrared photons, and dark count rates of ~ 0.25 counts/hr for a\n56 ${\\mu}$m diameter pixel. By using the amorphous superconductor MoSi, these\nUV SNSPDs are also able to operate at temperatures up to 4.2 K. These\nperformance metrics make UV SNSPDs ideal for applications in trapped-ion\nquantum information processing, lidar studies of the upper atmosphere, UV\nfluorescent-lifetime imaging microscopy, and photon-starved UV astronomy.\n", "  The butterfly velocity characterizes the spread of correlations in a quantum\nsystem. Recent work has provided a method of calculating the butterfly velocity\nof a class of boundary operators using holographic duality. Utilizing this and\na presumed extension of the canonical holographic correspondence of AdS/CFT, we\ninvestigate the butterfly velocities of operators with bulk duals living in\ngeneral spacetimes. We analyze some ubiquitous issues in calculating butterfly\nvelocities using the bulk effective theory, and then extend the previously\nproposed method to include operators in entanglement shadows. We explicitly\ncompute butterfly velocities for bulk local operators in the holographic theory\nof flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes and find a universal scaling\nbehavior for the spread of operators in the boundary theory, independent of\ndimension and fluid components. This result may suggest that a Lifshitz field\ntheory with z = 4 is the appropriate holographic dual for these spacetimes.\n", "  Phase-change materials (PCMs) have emerged as promising active elements in\nsilicon (Si) photonic systems. In this work, we design, fabricate, and\ncharacterize a hybrid Si-PCM optical modulator. By integrating vanadium dioxide\n(a PCM) within a Si photonic waveguide, in a non-resonant geometry, we\ndemonstrate ~ 10 dB broadband modulation with a PCM length of 500 nm.\n", "  It is known that no quantum process can produce a predetermined superposition\nof unknown arbitrary states. It has already been shown that with some partial\ninformation about the states, one can produce with some probability such\nsuperpositions. Here we show that there are universal machines which can\nproduce superpositions of unknown orthogonal states with unit probability. Our\nconstruction unravels the relation between the no-cloning theorem and the\nno-superposition theorem, that is we show that if a perfect cloning machine\nexists, then a universal superposition machine can also exist.\n", "  We have systematically studied the strong and radiative decays of the\nlow-lying $1P$-wave doubly charmed baryons. Some interesting observations are:\n(i) The states $\\Xi_{cc}^*$ and $\\Omega_{cc}^*$ with $J^P=3/2^+$ have a fairly\nlarge decay rate into the $\\Xi_{cc}\\gamma$ and $\\Omega_{cc}\\gamma$ channels\nwith a width $\\sim 15$ and $\\sim7$ keV, respectively. (ii) The lowest lying\nexcited doubly charmed baryons are dominated by the $1P$ $\\rho$ mode\nexcitations, which should be quite narrow states. They decay into the ground\nstate with $J^P=1/2^+$ through the radiative transitions with a significant\nratio. (iii) The total decay widths of the first orbital excitations of\n$\\lambda$ mode ($1P_{\\lambda}$ states with $J^P=1/2^-$, $3/2^-$, $5/2^-$) are\nabout $\\Gamma\\sim100$ MeV, and the ratio between the radiative and hadronic\ndecay widths is about $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$.\n", "  Integrated optical devices are becoming a common tool in modern optical\nscience and engineering. This devices should be designed to allow for precise\ncontrol and manipulation of light. The femtosecond laser written (FSLW)\nphotonic chips have proven to cope with the most current demands of integrated\nphotonics. However, up to date the polarization degree of freedom has rarely\nbeen exploited in experiments performed on the FSLW integrated platform. The\nmain obstacle is an intrinsically low anisotropy of laser written waveguides,\npreventing the design of polarizing integrated devices with small footprint. In\nthis Letter we demonstrate the approach based on stress-induced anisotropy\nallowing us to decrease the size of polarizing directional couplers fabricated\nwith the FSLW technology by almost an order of magnitude. We provide an\naccurate account for the effects emerging in waveguides written in a close\nproximity to each over.\n", "  We present a comprehensive spectral analysis of the BeXRB GRO J1008-57 over a\nluminosity range of three orders of magnitude using NuSTAR, Suzaku and RXTE\ndata. We find significant evolution of the spectral parameters with luminosity.\nIn particular the photon index hardens with increasing luminosity at\nintermediate luminosities between $10^{36}$ $-$ $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This\nevolution is stable and repeatedly observed over different outbursts. However,\nat the extreme ends of the observed luminosity range, we find that the\ncorrelation breaks down, with a significance level of at least $3.7\\sigma$. We\nconclude that these changes indicate transitions to different accretion\nregimes, which are characterized by different deceleration processes, such as\nCoulomb or radiation breaking. We compare our observed luminosity levels of\nthese transitions to theoretical predications and discuss the variation of\nthose theoretical luminosity values with fundamental neutron star parameters.\nFinally, we present detailed spectroscopy of the unique \"triple peaked\"\noutburst in 2014/15 which does not fit in the general parameter evolution with\nluminosity. The pulse profile on the other hand is consistent with what is\nexpected at this luminosity level, arguing against a change in accretion\ngeometry. In summary, GRO J1008-57 is an ideal target to study different\naccretion regimes due to the well constrained evolution of its broad-band\nspectral continuum over several orders of magnitude in luminosity.\n", "  Charm particle production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN SPS\nenergies is considered within a statistical approach. Namely, the Statistical\nModel of the Early Stage is used to calculate mean multiplicity of charm\nparticles in central Pb+Pb collisions. A small number of produced charm\nparticles necessitates the use of the exact charm conservation law. The model\npredicts a rapid increase of mean charm multiplicity as a function of collision\nenergy. The mean multiplicity calculated for central Pb+Pb collisions at the\ncenter of mass energy per nucleon pair $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=17.3$ GeV exceeds\nsignificantly the experimental upper limit. Thus, in order to describe open\ncharm production model parameters and/or assumptions should be revised.\n", "  We introduce a simple but efficient electronic fitness function (EFF) that\ndescribes the electronic aspect of the thermoelectric performance. This EFF\nfinds materials that overcome the inverse relationship between $\\sigma$ and $S$\nbased on the complexity of the electronic structures regardless of specific\norigin (e.g., isosurface corrugation, valley degeneracy, heavy-light bands\nmixture, valley anisotropy or reduced dimensionality). This function is well\nsuited for application in high throughput screening. We applied this function\nto 75 different thermoelectric and potential thermoelectric materials including\nfull- and half-Heuslers, binary semiconductors and Zintl phases. We find an\nefficient screening using this transport function. The EFF identifies known\nhigh performance $p$- and $n$-type Zintl phases and half-Heuslers. In addition,\nwe find some previously unstudied phases with superior EFF.\n", "  Here we present an analysis of the paper \"Universelle Bedeutung des\nWirkungsquantums\" (The universal meaning of the quantum of action), published\nby Jun Ishiwara in German in the \"Proceedings of Tokyo Mathematico-Physical\nSociety 8 (1915) 106-116\". In his work, Ishiwara, established in the Sendai\nUniversity, Japan, proposed - simultaneously with Arnold Sommerfeld, William\nWilson and Niels Bohr in Europe - the phase-space-integral quantization, a rule\nthat would be incorporated into the old-quantum-theory formalism. The\ndiscussions and analysis render this paper fully accessible to undergraduate\nstudents of physics with elementary knowledge of quantum mechanics.\n", "  We study hadronic molecular states in a coupled system of $J/\\psi N -\n\\Lambda_c\\bar{D}^{(*)} - \\Sigma_c^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ in $I(J^P) =\n\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{3}{2}^-)$ channel, using the complex scaling method combined\nwith the Gaussian expansion method. We construct the potential including one\npion exchange and one $D^{(*)}$ meson exchange with $S$-wave orbital angular\nmomentum. We find that the both mass and width of the pentaquark $P_c(4380)$\ncan be reproduced within a reasonable parameter region, and that its main decay\nmode is $\\Lambda_c\\bar{D}^*$. We extend our analysis to a coupled system of\n$\\Lambda_c D^{(*)} - \\Sigma_c^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ in $I(J^P) =\n\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{3}{2}^-)$ channel. We find that there exists a doubly charmed\nbaryon of $ccqq\\bar{q}$ type as a hadronic molecule, the mass and width of\nwhich are quite close to those of $P_c(4380)$.\n", "  We show that narrow superconducting strips in superconducting (S) and normal\n(N) states are universally described by the model presenting them as lateral\nNSN proximity systems in which the superconducting central band is sandwiched\nbetween damaged edge-bands with suppressed superconductivity.The width of the\nsuperconducting band was experimentally determined from the value of magnetic\nfield at which the band transits from the Meissner state to the static vortex\nstate. Systematic experimental study of 4.9 nm thick NbN strips with widths in\nthe interval from 50 nm to 20 ${\\mu}$m, which are all smaller than the Pearl's\nlength, demonstrates gradual evolution of the temperature dependence of the\ncritical current with the change of the strip width.\n", "  It has been theoretically predicted that light carrying orbital angular\nmomentum, or twisted light, can be tuned to have a strong magnetic-field\ncomponent at optical frequencies. We here consider the interaction of these\npeculiar fields with a semiconductor quantum dot and show that the magnetic\ninteraction results in new types of optical transitions. In particular, a\nsingle pulse of such twisted light can drive light-hole-to-conduction band\ntransitions that are cumbersome to produce using conventional Gaussian beams or\neven twisted light with dominant electric fields.\n", "  The possible existence of light and heavy sterile neutrinos may give rise to\ndirect and indirect unitarity violation of the $3\\times3$ lepton mixing matrix\nrespectively. In the current work we study the potential of future accelerator\nneutrino facilities in probing the unitarity violation effects. Taking DUNE,\nT2HK and a low-energy Neutrino Factory (LENF) as working examples of future\naccelerator neutrino facilities, we study the distinct effects of direct and\nindirect unitarity violation on the discovery reach of the leptonic CP\nviolation and precision measurements of $\\theta_{23}$ in the three neutrino\nframework. In addition, constraints on the additional mixing parameters of\ndirect and indirect unitarity violation are also discussed. Finally, we stress\nthat the combination of experiments with different oscillation channels,\ndifferent neutrino beams and different detector techniques will be an effective\nsolution to the parameter degeneracy problem and give the robust measurement of\nleptonic CP violation even if the direct and indirect unitarity violation are\ntaken into account.\n", "  Tunneling is one of the most bizarre phenomena in quantum mechanics. An\nattempt to understand it led to the next natural question of how long does a\nparticle need to tunnel a barrier. The latter gave rise to several definitions\nsuch as the phase, dwell, Larmor and traversal times among others. A short\nreview of the evolution of these time concepts, followed by an account of\nexperiments involving field-induced tunnel ionization and electron tunneling in\na solid state junction is presented here. Whereas the former experiments use\nsophisticated techniques involving femtosecond laser pulses and determine the\ntunneling time by mapping the angle of rotation of the field vector to time,\nlike the hands of a watch, the latter provides a simpler method through the\nmeasurement of current-voltage characteristics of the junction.\n", "  We investigated the regular multi-horizon black holes in the Einstein\ngravity, $F(R)$ gravity and the 5 dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity, all of them\ncoupled with non-linear electrodynamics. We presented several explicit examples\nof the actions which admit the solutions describing regular black hole\nspace-time with multi-horizons. Thermodynamics of the obtained black hole\nsolutions is studied. The explicit expressions of the temperature, the entropy,\nthe thermodynamical energy and the free energy are obtained. Although the\ntemperature vanishes in the extremal limit where the radii of the two horizons\ncoincide with each other as in the standard multi-horizon black hole like the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\" om black hole or the Kerr black hole, the larger temperature\ncorresponds to the larger horizon radius. This is different from the standard\nblack holes, where the larger temperature corresponds to the smaller horizon\nradius. We also found that the specific heat becomes positive for the large\ntemperature, which is also different from the standard black holes, where the\nspecific heat is negative. It should be also noted that the thermodynamical\nenergy is not identical with the ADM mass. Furthermore in case of the\nGauss-Bonnet gravity, it is demonstrated that the entropy can become negative.\n", "  We describe an all-optical lithography process that can be used to make\nelectrical contact to atomic-precision donor devices made in silicon using\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM). This is accomplished by implementing a\ncleaning procedure in the STM that allows the integration of metal alignment\nmarks and ion-implanted contacts at the wafer level. Low-temperature transport\nmeasurements of a patterned device establish the viability of the process.\n", "  We compare the gauging of the Bargmann algebra, for the case of arbitrary\ntorsion, with the result that one obtains from a null-reduction of General\nRelativity. Whereas the two procedures lead to the same result for\nNewton-Cartan geometry with arbitrary torsion, the null-reduction of the\nEinstein equations necessarily leads to Newton-Cartan gravity with zero\ntorsion. We show, for three space-time dimensions, how Newton-Cartan gravity\nwith arbitrary torsion can be obtained by starting from a Schroedinger field\ntheory with dynamical exponent z=2 for a complex compensating scalar and next\ncoupling this field theory to a z=2 Schroedinger geometry with arbitrary\ntorsion. The latter theory can be obtained from either a gauging of the\nSchroedinger algebra, for arbitrary torsion, or from a null-reduction of\nconformal gravity.\n", "  A comparable study of the quantum van der Waals and Walecka models of nuclear\nmatter is presented. Each model contains two parameters which characterize the\nrepulsive and attractive interactions between nucleons. These parameters are\nfixed in order to reproduce the known properties of the nuclear ground state.\nBoth models predict a first-order liquid-gas phase transition and a very\nsimilar behavior in the vicinity of the critical point. Critical exponents of\nthe quantum van der Waals model are studied both analytically and numerically.\nThere are important differences in the behavior of the thermodynamical\nfunctions of the considered models at large values of the nucleon number\ndensity. At the same time both models fall into the universality class of\nmean-field theory.\n", "  Proposing a system of two rotatable nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence of\nelectromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, using the framework of canonical\nquantization, the electromagnetic and matter fields have been quantized. The\nnon-contact frictional torque, affecting the rotation of NPs due to the\npresence of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations and also by the matter field\nfluctuations have been derived. Considering the distance between NPs less than\n100 nm in the near-field, we observe the rotations are phase locked. It has\nbeen shown that the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations play the role of noises\nto break down the synchronization. Also surprisingly, we find the frictional\ntorque between NPs in the near-field is much bigger than the popular contact\nfriction between them where it causes a robust synchronization in the\nnear-field.\n", "  We report on the fabrication and electrical transport properties of\nsuperconducting junctions made of \\beta-Ag$_{2}$Se topological insulator (TI)\nnanowires in contact with Al superconducting electrodes. The temperature\ndependence of the critical current indicates that the superconducting junction\nbelongs to a short and diffusive junction regime. As a characteristic feature\nof the narrow junction, the critical current decreases monotonously with\nincreasing magnetic field. The stochastic distribution of the switching current\nexhibits the macroscopic quantum tunneling behavior, which is robust up to T =\n0.8 K. Our observations indicate that the TI nanowire-based Josephson junctions\ncan be a promising building block for the development of nanohybrid\nsuperconducting quantum bits.\n", "  In this work we study analytically and numerically the spectrum and\nlocalization properties of three quasi-one-dimensional (ribbons) split-ring\nresonator arrays which possess magnetic flatbands, namely, the stub, Lieb and\nkagome lattices, and how their spectra is affected by the presence of\nperturbations that break the delicate geometrical interference needed for a\nmagnetic flatband to exist. We find that the Stub and Lieb ribbons are stable\nagainst the three types of perturbations considered here, while the kagome\nribbon is, in general, unstable. When losses are incorporated, all flatbands\nremain dispersionless but become complex, with the kagome ribbon exhibiting the\nhighest loss rate.\n", "  We study a deformation of the defocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS)\nequation, the defocusing Camassa- Holm NLS, hereafter referred to as CH-NLS\nequation. We use asymptotic multiscale expansion methods to reduce this model\nto a Boussinesq-like equation, which is then subsequently approximated by two\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations for left- and right-traveling waves. We use\nthe soliton solution of the KdV equation to construct approximate solutions of\nthe CH-NLS system. It is shown that these solutions may have the form of either\ndark or antidark solitons, namely dips or humps on top of a stable\ncontinuous-wave background. We also use numerical simulations to investigate\nthe validity of the asymptotic solutions, study their evolution, and their\nhead-on collisions. It is shown that small-amplitude dark and antidark solitons\nundergo quasi-elastic collisions.\n", "  We propose a radiatively-induced neutrino mass model at one-loop level by\nintroducing a pair of doubly-charged fermions and a few multi-charged bosons.\nWe investigate the contributions of the model to neutrino masses, lepton-flavor\nviolations, muon $g-2$, oblique parameters, and collider signals, and find a\nsubstantial fraction of the parameter space that can satisfy all the\nconstraints. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of detecting the\ndoubly-charged fermions at the LHC.\n", "  We consider a chain of coupled pendula pairs, where each pendulum is\nconnected to the nearest neighbors in the longitudinal and transverse\ndirections. The common strings in each pair are modulated periodically by an\nexternal force. In the limit of small coupling and near the 1:2 parametric\nresonance, we derive a novel system of coupled PT-symmetric discrete nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation, which has Hamiltonian symmetry but has no gauge symmetry.\nBy using the conserved energy, we find the parameter range for the linear and\nnonlinear stability of the zero equilibrium. Numerical experiments illustrate\nhow destabilization of the zero equilibrium takes place when the stability\nconstraints are not satisfied. The central pendulum excites nearest pendula and\nthis process continues until a dynamical equilibrium is reached where each\npendulum in the chain oscillates at a finite amplitude.\n", "  We study one loop quantum gravitational corrections to the long range force\ninduced by the exchange of a massless scalar between two massive scalars. The\nvarious diagrams contributing to the flat space S-matrix are evaluated in a\ngeneral covariant gauge and we show that dependence on the gauge parameters\ncancels at a point considerably {\\it before} forming the full S-matrix, which\nis unobservable in cosmology. It is possible to interpret our computation as a\nsolution to the effective field equations --- which could be done even in\ncosmology --- but taking account of quantum gravitational corrections from the\nsource and from the observer.\n", "  We study a generalized nonlocal theory of gravity which, in specific limits,\ncan become either the curvature non-local or teleparallel non-local theory.\nUsing the Noether Symmetry Approach, we find that the coupling functions coming\nfrom the non-local terms are constrained to be either exponential or linear in\nform. It is well known that in some non-local theories, a certain kind of\nexponential non-local couplings are needed in order to achieve a renormalizable\ntheory. In this paper, we explicitly show that this kind of coupling does not\nneed to by introduced by hand, instead, it appears naturally from the\nsymmetries of the Lagrangian in flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology.\nFinally, we find de-Sitter and power law cosmological solutions for different\nnonlocal theories. The symmetries for the generalized non-local theory is also\nfound and some cosmological solutions are also achieved under the full theory.\n", "  We report on a search for ultra-low-mass axion-like dark matter by analysing\nthe ratio of the spin-precession frequencies of stored ultracold neutrons and\n$^{199}$Hg atoms for an axion-induced oscillating electric dipole moment of the\nneutron and an axion-wind spin-precession effect. No signal consistent with\ndark matter is observed for the axion mass range $10^{-24}~\\textrm{eV} \\le m_a\n\\le 10^{-17}~\\textrm{eV}$. Our null result sets the first laboratory\nconstraints on the coupling of axion dark matter to gluons, which improve on\nastrophysical limits by up to 3 orders of magnitude, and also improves on\nprevious laboratory constraints on the axion coupling to nucleons by up to a\nfactor of 40.\n", "  R-parity and baryon number violating operators can be allowed in the\nSupersymmetric Standard Model and thus lead to interesting baryon number\nviolating processes such as neutron-antineutron oscillations and baryogenesis\nof the Universe via the decay of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP).\nAdopting the LSP baryogenesis mechanism realized by the late decay of the\naxino, we identify a single coupling lambda''_313 as a common origin for the\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe as well as potentially observable\nneutron-antineutron oscillation rates. From this, rather strong constraints on\nthe supersymmetry breaking masses and the axion decay constant are obtained.\nThe favoured parameter space of lambda''_313 ~ 0.1 and sub-TeV masses for the\nrelevant sparticles is readily accessible by the current and future LHC\nsearches.\n", "  We apply the newly derived nonadiabatic golden-rule instanton theory to\nasymmetric models describing electron-transfer in solution. The models go\nbeyond the usual spin-boson description and have anharmonic free-energy\nsurfaces with different values for the reactant and product reorganization\nenergies. The instanton method gives an excellent description of the behaviour\nof the rate constant with respect to asymmetry for the whole range studied. We\nderive a general formula for an asymmetric version of Marcus theory based on\nthe classical limit of the instanton and find that this gives significant\ncorrections to the standard Marcus theory. A scheme is given to compute this\nrate based only on equilibrium simulations. We also compare the rate constants\nobtained by the instanton method with its classical limit to study the effect\nof tunnelling and other quantum nuclear effects. These quantum effects can\nincrease the rate constant by orders of magnitude.\n", "  Hierarchical organization is an important, prevalent characteristic of\ncomplex systems; in order to understand their organization, the study of the\nunderlying (generally complex) networks that describe the interactions between\ntheir constituents plays a central role. Numerous previous works have shown\nthat many real-world networks in social, biologic and technical systems present\nhierarchical organization, often in the form of a hierarchy of community\nstructures. Many artificial benchmark graphs have been proposed in order to\ntest different community detection methods, but no benchmark has been developed\nto throughly test the detection of hierarchical community structures. In this\nstudy, we fill this vacancy by extending the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi\n(LFR) ensemble of benchmark graphs, adopting the rule of constructing\nhierarchical networks proposed by Ravasz and Barab\\'asi. We employ this\nbenchmark to test three of the most popular community detection algorithms, and\nquantify their accuracy using the traditional Mutual Information and the\nrecently introduced Hierarchical Mutual Information. The results indicate that\nthe Ravasz-Barab\\'asi-Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (RB-LFR) benchmark\ngenerates a complex hierarchical structure constituting a challenging benchmark\nfor the considered community detection methods.\n", "  Context. Clouds have already been detected in exoplanetary atmospheres. They\nplay crucial roles in a planet's atmosphere and climate and can also create\nambiguities in the determination of atmospheric parameters such as trace gas\nmixing ratios. Knowledge of cloud properties is required when assessing the\nhabitability of a planet. Aims. We aim to show that various types of cloud\ncover such as polar cusps, subsolar clouds, and patchy clouds on Earth-like\nexoplanets can be distinguished from each other using the polarization and flux\nof light that is reflected by the planet. Methods. We have computed the flux\nand polarization of reflected starlight for different types of (liquid water)\ncloud covers on Earth-like model planets using the adding-doubling method, that\nfully includes multiple scattering and polarization. Variations in cloud-top\naltitudes and planet-wide cloud cover percentages were taken into account.\nResults. We find that the different types of cloud cover (polar cusps, subsolar\nclouds, and patchy clouds) can be distinguished from each other and that the\npercentage of cloud cover can be estimated within 10%. Conclusions. Using our\nproposed observational strategy, one should be able to determine basic orbital\nparameters of a planet such as orbital inclination and estimate cloud coverage\nwith reduced ambiguities from the planet's polarization signals along its\norbit.\n", "  With proposing a unified description of the fields variation at the level of\ngenerating functional, we obtain a new identity for the quark-gluon interaction\nvertex based on gauge symmetry, which is similar to the Slavnov-Taylor\nIdentities(STIs) based on the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin transformation. With\nthese identities, we find that in Landau gauge, the dressing function of the\nghost propagator approaches to a constant as its momentum goes to zero, which\nprovides a strong constraint on the infrared behaviour of ghost propagator.\n", "  Customarily, in-plane auxeticity and synclastic bending behavior (i.e.\nout-of-plane auxeticity) are not independent, being the latter a manifestation\nof the former. Basically, this is a feature of three-dimensional bodies. At\nvariance, two-dimensional bodies have more freedom to deform than\nthree-dimensional ones. Here, we exploit this peculiarity and propose a\ntwo-dimensional honeycomb structure with out-of-plane auxetic behavior opposite\nto the in-plane one. With a suitable choice of the lattice constitutive\nparameters, in its continuum description such a structure can achieve the whole\nrange of values for the bending Poisson coefficient, while retaining a\nmembranal Poisson coefficient equal to 1. In particular, this structure can\nreach the extreme values, $-1$ and $+1$, of the bending Poisson coefficient.\nAnalytical calculations are supported by numerical simulations, showing the\naccuracy of the continuum formulas in predicting the response of the discrete\nstructure.\n", "  Recently several papers extracted $|V_{cb}|$ using the Belle measurement of\nthe exclusive $\\bar B \\to D^* \\ell\\bar\\nu$ unfolded differential decay rates,\navailable for the first time. Depending on the theoretical inputs, some of the\nfits yield higher $|V_{cb}|$ values, compatible with those from inclusive\nsemileptonic $B$ decays. Since these four fits use mostly the same data, if\ntheir correlations were close to 100\\%, the tension between them would be over\n$5\\sigma$. We determine the correlations, find that the tension between the\nresults is less than $3\\sigma$, and explore what might lead to improving the\nconsistency of the fits. We find that fits that yield the higher values of\n$|V_{cb}|$, also suggest large violations of heavy quark symmetry. These fits\nare also in tension with preliminary lattice QCD data on the form factors.\nWithout additional experimental data or lattice QCD input, there are no set of\nassumptions under which the tension between exclusive and inclusive\ndeterminations of $|V_{cb}|$ can be considered resolved.\n", "  Piezoelectrics with negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficients will\ncontract in the direction of an applied electric field. Such piezoelectrics are\nthought to be rare but there is no fundamental physics preventing the\nrealization of negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect in a single-phase\nmaterial. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that several\nhexagonal $ABC$ ferroelectrics possess significant negative longitudinal\npiezoelectric effect. The data mining of a first-principles-based database of\npiezoelectrics reveals that this effect is a general phenomenon. The origin of\nthis unusual piezoelectric response relies on the strong ionic bonds associated\nwith small effective charges and rigid potential energy surfaces. Moreover,\nferroelectrics with negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficients show\nanomalous pressure-enhanced ferroelectricity. Our results offer design\nprinciples to aid the search of new piezoelectrics for novel electromechanical\ndevice applications.\n", "  We performed simulations for solid molecular hydrogen at high pressures\n(250GPa$\\leq$P$\\leq$500GPa) along two isotherms at T=200 K (phases III and VI)\nand at T=414 K (phase IV). At T=200K we considered likely candidates for phase\nIII, the C2c and Cmca12 structures, while at T=414K in phase IV we studied the\nPc48 structure. We employed both Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo (CEIMC) and\nPath Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) based on Density Functional Theory\n(DFT) using the vdW-DF approximation. The comparison between the two methods\nallows us to address the question of the accuracy of the xc approximation of\nDFT for thermal and quantum protons without recurring to perturbation theories.\nIn general, we find that atomic and molecular fluctuations in PIMD are larger\nthan in CEIMC which suggests that the potential energy surface from vdW-DF is\nless structured than the one from Quantum Monte Carlo. We find qualitatively\ndifferent behaviors for systems prepared in the C2c structure for increasing\npressure. Within PIMD the C2c structure is dynamically partially stable for\nP$\\leq$250GPa only: it retains the symmetry of the molecular centers but not\nthe molecular orientation; at intermediate pressures it develops layered\nstructures like Pbcn or Ibam and transforms to the metallic Cmca-4 structure at\nP$\\geq$450GPa. Instead, within CEIMC, the C2c structure is found to be\ndynamically stable at least up to 450GPa; at increasing pressure the molecular\nbond length increases and the nuclear correlation decreases. For the other two\nstructures the two methods are in qualitative agreement although quantitative\ndifferences remain. We discuss various structural properties and the electrical\nconductivity. We find these structures become conducting around 350GPa but the\nmetallic Drude-like behavior is reached only at around 500GPa, consistent with\nrecent experimental claims.\n", "  We analyze spectral properties of two mutually related families of magnetic\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger operators, $H_{\\mathrm{Sm}}(A)=(i \\nabla +A)^2+\\omega^2\ny^2+\\lambda y \\delta(x)$ and $H(A)=(i \\nabla +A)^2+\\omega^2 y^2+ \\lambda y^2\nV(x y)$ in $L^2(R^2)$, with the parameters $\\omega>0$ and $\\lambda<0$, where\n$A$ is a vector potential corresponding to a homogeneous magnetic field\nperpendicular to the plane and $V$ is a regular nonnegative and compactly\nsupported potential. We show that the spectral properties of the operators\ndepend crucially on the one-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators $L=\n-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} +\\omega^2 +\\lambda \\delta (x)$ and $L (V)=\n- \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} +\\omega^2 +\\lambda V(x)$, respectively.\nDepending on whether the operators $L$ and $L(V)$ are positive or not, the\nspectrum of $H_{\\mathrm{Sm}}(A)$ and $H(V)$ exhibits a sharp transition.\n", "  In this paper, we present a new version of the $i$QIST software package,\nwhich is capable of solving various quantum impurity models by using the\nhybridization expansion (or strong coupling expansion) continuous-time quantum\nMonte Carlo algorithm. In the revised version, the software architecture is\ncompletely redesigned. New basis (intermediate representation or singular value\ndecomposition representation) for the single-particle and two-particle Green's\nfunctions is introduced. A lot of useful physical observables are added, such\nas the charge susceptibility, fidelity susceptibility, Binder cumulant, and\nautocorrelation time. Especially, we optimize measurement for the two-particle\nGreen's functions. Both the particle-hole and particle-particle channels are\nsupported. In addition, the block structure of the two-particle Green's\nfunctions is exploited to accelerate the calculation. Finally, we fix some\nknown bugs and limitations. The computational efficiency of the code is greatly\nenhanced.\n", "  We study implications of a recent observation of non-leptonic $B^+_c\\to D^0\nK^+$ decay and a bound on $B^+_c\\to D^0 \\pi^+$ transition on CP-violating\nasymmetries in $B_c$ decays. In the U-spin symmetry limit, we derive a relation\nbetween the CP-asymmetries in the $B^+_c\\to D^0 K^+$ and $B^+_c\\to D^0 \\pi^+$\nchannels and the corresponding branching ratios. We also derive several\nrelations between non-leptonic $B_c$ decays into the final states with $D$\nmesons in the flavor $SU(3)_F$ limit. We point out that a combined study of\n$SU(3)_F$ amplitudes in these decays can be used to constrain the angle\n$\\gamma$ of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix.\n", "  MgB2 tapes with high critical current have a significant technological\npotential, but can experience operational breakdown due to thermomagnetic\ninstability. Using magneto-optical imaging the spatial structure of the\nthermomagnetic avalanches has been resolved, and the reproducibility and\nthresholds for their appearance have been determined. By combining\nmagneto-optical imaging with magnetic moment measurements, it is found that\navalanches appear in a range between 1.7 mT and 2.5 T. Avalanches appearing at\nlow fields are small intrusions at the tape's edge and non-detectable in\nmeasurements of magnetic moment. Larger avalanches have dendritic structures.\n", "  Entanglement of three photons from the decay of ortho-positronium is\nre-analyzed. We use the full three body phase space to write down the entangled\nstates classified according to the spin directions of the ortho-positronium.\nEven in the case when the spin is perpendicular to the decay plane, we find\nnon-negligible phases entering the entangled state. This has not been noticed\nbefore. We advocate a fixed quantization axis of the spin for the sake of\ngenerality. A brief discussion of a three dimensional formalism for photons,\nincluding correlations, versus a two dimensional one is given.\n", "  The analysis of results from HEP experiments often involves the estimates of\nthe composition of the binned data samples, based on Monte Carlo simulations of\nvarious sources. Due to a finite statistic of MC samples they have statistical\nfluctuation. This work proposes the method of incorporating the systematic\nuncertainties due to finite statistics of MC samples with negative weights. The\npossible approximations are discussed and the comparison of different methods\nare presented.\n", "  Proton inelastic scattering off a neutron halo nucleus, 11Li, has been\nstudied in inverse kinematics at the IRIS facility at TRIUMF. The aim was to\nestablish a soft dipole resonance and to obtain its dipole strength. Using a\nhigh quality 66 MeV 11Li beam, a strongly populated excited state in 11Li was\nobserved at Ex=0.80 +/- 0.02 MeV with a width of 1.15 +/- 0.06 MeV. A DWBA\n(distorted-wave Born approximation) analysis of the measured differential cross\nsection with isoscalar macroscopic form factors leads to conclude that this\nobserved state is excited in an electric dipole (E1) transition. Under the\nassumption of isoscalar E1 transition, the strength is evaluated to be\nextremely large amounting to 600 to 2000 Weisskopf units, exhausting 4% to 14%\nof the isoscalar E1 energy-weighted sum rule (EWSR) value. The large observed\nstrength originates from the halo and is consistent with the simple di-neutron\nmodel of 11Li halo.\n", "  We calculate the parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ in the parametrized\npost-Newtonian (PPN) formalism for scalar-tensor gravity (STG) with an\narbitrary potential, under the assumption that the source matter is given by a\nnon-rotating sphere of constant density, pressure and internal energy. For our\ncalculation we write the STG field equations in a form which is manifestly\ninvariant under conformal transformations of the metric and redefinitions of\nthe scalar field. This easily shows that also the obtained PPN parameters are\ninvariant under such transformations. Our result is consistent with the\nexpectation that STG is a fully conservative theory, i.e., only $\\gamma$ and\n$\\beta$ differ from their general relativity values $\\gamma = \\beta = 1$, which\nindicates the absence of preferred frame and preferred location effects. We\nfind that the values of the PPN parameters depend on both the radius of the\ngravitating mass source and the distance between the source and the observer.\nMost interestingly, we find that also at large distances from the source\n$\\beta$ does not approach $\\beta = 1$, but receives corrections due to a\nmodified gravitational self-energy of the source. Finally, we compare our\nresult to a number of measurements of $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ in the Solar System.\nWe find that in particular measurements of $\\beta$ improve the previously\nobtained bounds on the theory parameters, due to the aforementioned\nlong-distance corrections.\n", "  In this work we systematically enumerate genus one fibrations in the class of\n7,890 Calabi-Yau manifolds defined as complete intersections in products of\nprojective spaces, the so-called CICY threefolds. This survey is independent of\nthe description of the manifolds and improves upon past approaches that probed\nonly a particular algebraic form of the threefolds (i.e. searches for \"obvious\"\ngenus one fibrations as in [1,2]). We also study K3-fibrations and nested\nfibration structures. That is, K3 fibrations with potentially many distinct\nelliptic fibrations. To accomplish this survey a number of new geometric tools\nare developed including a determination of the full topology of all CICY\nthreefolds, including triple intersection numbers. In 2,946 cases this involves\nfinding a new \"favorable\" description of the manifold in which all divisors\ndescend from a simple ambient space. Our results consist of a survey of obvious\nfibrations for all CICY threefolds and a complete classification of all genus\none fibrations for 4,957 \"Kahler favorable\" CICYs whose Kahler cones descend\nfrom a simple ambient space. Within the CICY dataset, we find 139,597 obvious\ngenus one fibrations, 30,974 obvious K3 fibrations and 208,987 nested\ncombinations. For the Kahler favorable geometries we find a complete\nclassification of 377,559 genus one fibrations. For one manifold with Hodge\nnumbers (19,19) we find an explicit description of an infinite number of\ndistinct genus-one fibrations extending previous results for this particular\ngeometry that have appeared in the literature. The data associated to this scan\nis available at http://www1.phys.vt.edu/cicydata .\n", "  To predict the mean temperature profiles in turbulent thermal convection, the\nthermal boundary layer (BL) equation including the effects of fluctuations has\nto be solved. In Shishkina et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 (2015), the thermal BL\nequation with the fluctuations taken into account as an eddy thermal\ndiffusivity has been solved for large Prandtl-number fluids for which the eddy\nthermal diffusivity and the velocity field can be approximated respectively as\na cubic and a linear function of the distance from the plate. In the present\nwork we make use of the idea of Prandtl's mixing length model and relate the\neddy thermal diffusivity to the stream function. With this proposed relation,\nwe can solve the thermal BL equation and obtain a closed-form expression for\nthe dimensionless mean temperature profile in terms of two independent\nparameters for fluids with a general Prandtl number. With a proper choice of\nthe parameters, our predictions of the temperature profiles are in excellent\nagreement with the results of our direct numerical simulations for a wide range\nof Prandtl numbers from 0.01 to 2547.9 and Rayleigh numbers from 10^7 to 10^9.\n", "  Using acoustooptic (AO) cells based on TeO2 crystal and silica glass, we have\nexperimentally shown for the first time that the intensity profile and the\nphase structure of the vortex beam are preserved under AO Bragg diffraction. As\na result, the vortex beam can be deflected due to AO diffraction, whereas the\nacoustooptically operated vortex beams can be efficiently used in such novel\nbranches of optical technology as optical trapping and controlled addressing of\nthe beams with different orbital angular momentums.\n", "  We present an open-source plasma fluid code for 2D, cylindrical and 3D\nsimulations of streamer discharges, based on the Afivo framework that features\nadaptive mesh refinement, geometric multigrid methods for Poisson's equation,\nand OpenMP parallelism. We describe the numerical implementation of a fluid\nmodel of the drift-diffusion-reaction type, combined with the local field\napproximation. Then we demonstrate its functionality with 3D simulations of\nlong positive streamers in nitrogen in undervolted gaps, using three examples.\nThe first example shows how a stochastic background density affects streamer\npropagation and branching. The second one focuses on the interaction of a\nstreamer with preionized regions, and the third one investigates the\ninteraction between two streamers. The simulations run on up to $10^8$ grid\ncells within less than a day. Without mesh refinement, they would require\n$4\\cdot 10^{12}$ grid cells.\n", "  For large random matrices $X$ with independent, centered entries but not\nnecessarily identical variances, the eigenvalue density of $XX^*$ is\nwell-approximated by a deterministic measure on $\\mathbb{R}$. We show that the\ndensity of this measure has only square and cubic-root singularities away from\nzero. We also extend the bulk local law in [arXiv:1606.07353] to the vicinity\nof these singularities.\n", "  We consider different sets of AdS$_2$ boundary conditions for the\nJackiw-Teitelboim model in the linear dilaton sector where the dilaton is\nallowed to fluctuate to leading order at the boundary of the Poincar\\'e disk.\nThe most general set of boundary condtions is easily motivated in the gauge\ntheoretic formulation as a Poisson sigma model and has an $\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$\ncurrent algebra as asymptotic symmetries. Consistency of the variational\nprinciple requires a novel boundary counterterm in the holographically\nrenormalized action, namely a kinetic term for the dilaton. The on-shell action\ncan be naturally reformulated as a Schwarzian boundary action. While there can\nbe at most three canonical boundary charges on an equal-time slice, we consider\nall Fourier modes of these charges with respect to the Euclidean boundary time\nand study their associated algebras. Besides the (centerless)\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ current algebra we find for stricter boundary conditions a\nVirasoro algebra, a warped conformal algebra and a $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$ current\nalgebra. In each of these cases we get one half of a corresponding symmetry\nalgebra in three-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative cosmological\nconstant and analogous boundary conditions. However, on-shell some of these\nalgebras reduce to finite-dimensional ones, reminiscent of the on-shell\nbreaking of conformal invariance in SYK. We conclude with a discussion of\nthermodynamical aspects, in particular the entropy and some Cardyology.\n", "  Composite Higgs models with anarchic partial compositeness require a scale of\nnew physics ${\\cal O}(10-100)$ TeV, with the bounds being dominated by the\ndipole moments and $\\epsilon_K$. The presence of anarchic bilinear interactions\ncan change this picture. We show a solution to the SM flavor puzzle where the\nelectron and the Right-handed quarks of the first generation have negligible\nlinear interactions, and the bilinear interactions account for most of their\nmasses, whereas the other chiral fermions follow a similar pattern to anarchic\npartial compositeness. We compute the bounds from flavor and CP violation and\nshow that neutron and electron dipole moments, as well as $\\epsilon_K$ and\n$\\mu\\to e\\gamma$, are compatible with a new physics scale below the TeV.\n$\\Delta F=2$ operators involving Left-handed quarks and $\\Delta F=1$ operators\nwith $d_L$ give the most stringent bounds in this scenario. Their Wilson\ncoefficients have the same origin as in anarchic partial compositeness,\nrequiring the masses of the new states to be larger than ${\\cal O}(6-7)$ TeV.\n", "  Dynamic hybrid optical pumping effects with a radio-frequency-field-driven\nnonlinear magneto-optical rotation (RF NMOR) scheme are studied in a\ndual-species paraffin coated vapor cell. By pumping K atoms and probing\n$^{87}$Rb atoms, we achieve an intrinsic magnetic resonance linewidth of 3 Hz\nand the observed resonance is immune to power broadening and light-shift\neffects. Such operation scheme shows favorable prospects for atomic\nmagnetometry applications.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) at telecom wavelengths (1260-1625nm) has the\npotential for fast deployment due to existing optical fibre infrastructure and\nmature telecom technologies. At these wavelengths, indium gallium arsenide\n(InGaAs) avalanche photodiode (APD) based detectors are the preferred choice\nfor photon detection. Similar to their silicon counterparts used at shorter\nwavelengths, they exhibit fluorescence from recombination of electron-hole\npairs generated in the avalanche breakdown process. This fluorescence may open\nside channels for attacks on QKD systems. Here, we characterize the breakdown\nfluorescence from two commercial InGaAs single photon counting modules, and\nfind a spectral distribution between 1000nm and 1600nm. We also show that by\nspectral filtering, this side channel can be efficiently suppressed.\n", "  Considering structure functions of the streamwise velocity component in a\nframework akin to the extended self-similarity hypothesis (ESS), de Silva\n\\textit{et al.} (\\textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. 823,2017, pp. 498-510) observed\nthat remarkably the \\textit{large-scale} (energy-containing range) statistics\nin canonical wall bounded flows exhibit universal behaviour. In the present\nstudy, we extend this universality, which was seen to encompass also flows at\nmoderate Reynolds number, to Taylor-Couette flow. In doing so, we find that\nalso the transversal structure function of the spanwise velocity component\nexhibits the same universal behaviour across all flow types considered. We\nfurther demonstrate that these observations are consistent with predictions\ndeveloped based on an attached-eddy hypothesis. These considerations also yield\na possible explanation for the efficacy of the ESS framework by showing that it\nrelaxes the self-similarity assumption for the attached eddy contributions. By\ntaking the effect of streamwise alignment into account, the attached eddy model\npredicts different behaviour for structure functions in the streamwise and in\nthe spanwise directions and that this effect cancels in the ESS-framework ---\nboth consistent with the data. Moreover, it is demonstrated here that also the\nadditive constants, which were previously believed to be flow dependent, are\nindeed universal at least in turbulent boundary layers and pipe flow where\nhigh-Reynolds number data are currently available.\n", "  We describe a hands-on accurate demonstrator for cosmic rays realized by six\nhigh school students, whose main aim is to show the relevance and the\nfunctioning of the principal parts of a cosmic rays telescope (muon detector),\nwith the help of two large size wooden artifacts. The first one points out how\ncosmic rays can be tracked in a muon telescope, while the other one shows the\nkey avalanche process of electronic ionization that effectively allows muon\ndetection through a photomultiplier. Incoming cosmic rays are visualized in\nterms of laser beams, whose 3D trajectory is highlighted by the turning on of\nLEDs on two orthogonal matrices. Instead the avalanche ionization process is\ndemonstrated through the avalanche falling of glass marbles on an inclined\nplane, finally turning on a LED. A pictured poster accompanying the\ndemonstrator is as well effective in assisting cosmic rays demonstration and\nits detection. The success of the demonstrator has been fully proven by general\npublic during a Science Festival, the corresponding project winning the\nHonorable Mention in a dedicated competition.\n", "  The dynamics of bouncing universes is characterized by violating certain\ncoordinate invariant restrictions on the total energy-momentum tensor,\ncustomarily referred to as energy conditions. Although there could be epochs\nwhere the null energy condition is locally violated, it may perhaps be enforced\nin an averaged sense. Explicit examples of this possibility are investigated in\ndifferent frameworks.\n", "  We review the question of quantum consistency of N=4 conformal supergravity\nin 4 dimensions. The UV divergences and anomalies of the standard (\"minimal\")\nconformal supergravity where the complex scalar $\\phi$ is not coupled to the\nWeyl graviton kinetic term can be cancelled by coupling this theory to N=4\nsuper Yang-Mills with gauge group of dimension 4. The same turns out to be true\nalso for the \"non-minimal\" N=4 conformal supergravity with the action (recently\nconstructed in arXiv:1609.09083) depending on an arbitrary holomorphic function\n$f(\\phi)$. The special case of the \"non-minimal\" conformal supergravity with\n$f= e^{2\\phi}$ appears in the twistor-string theory. We show that divergences\nand anomalies do not depend on the form of the function $f$ and thus can be\ncancelled just as in the \"minimal\" $f=1$ case by coupling the theory to four\nN=4 vector multiplets.\n", "  This paper deals with the problem of defining off-shell conserved charges in\na set of theories known as Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity (CSLTG). The\nmethod is derived in a general way, which may find applications in a wide set\nof theories, and then specified to the case of Generalized minimal massive\ngravity (GMMG), where known results of the central charge and black hole\nentropy are reproduced. The results for the charges are useful to the community\nand can be applied to all three-dimensional gravity theories within the class\nof CSLTG which includes almost all of them. The given specific examples show a\nconsistency check of the more general method.\n", "  Broadly distributed random variables with a power-law distribution $f(m) \\sim\nm^{-(1+\\alpha)}$ are known to generate condensation effects, in the sense that,\nwhen the exponent $\\alpha$ lies in a certain interval, the largest variable in\na sum of $N$ (independent and identically distributed) terms is for large $N$\nof the same order as the sum itself. In particular, when the distribution has\ninfinite mean ($0<\\alpha<1$) one finds unconstrained condensation, whereas for\n$\\alpha>1$ constrained condensation takes places fixing the total mass to a\nlarge enough value $M=\\sum_{i=1}^N m_i > M_c$. In both cases, a standard\nindicator of the condensation phenomenon is the participation ratio\n$Y_k=\\langle \\sum_i m_i^k / (\\sum_i m_i)^k\\rangle$ ($k>1$), which takes a\nfinite value for $N \\to \\infty$ when condensation occurs. To better understand\nthe connection between constrained and unconstrained condensation, we study\nhere the situation when the total mass is fixed to a superextensive value $M\n\\sim N^{1+\\delta}$ ($\\delta >0$), hence interpolating between the unconstrained\ncondensation case (where the typical value of the total mass scales as $M\\sim\nN^{1/\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha<1$) and the extensive constrained mass. In particular\nwe show that for exponents $\\alpha<1$ a condensate phase for values $\\delta >\n\\delta_c=1/\\alpha-1$ is separated from a homogeneous phase at $\\delta <\n\\delta_c$ by a transition line, $\\delta=\\delta_c$, where a weak condensation\nphenomenon takes place. We focus on the evaluation of the participation ratio\nas a generic indicator of condensation, also recalling or presenting results in\nthe standard cases of unconstrained mass and of fixed extensive mass.\n", "  Compact groups (CGs) provide an environment in which interactions between\ngalaxies and with the intra-group medium enable and accelerate galaxy\ntransitions from actively star forming to quiescent. Galaxies in transition\nfrom active to quiescent can be selected, by their infrared (IR) colors, as\ncanyon or infrared transition zone (IRTZ) galaxies. We used a sample of CG\ngalaxies with IR data from the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)\nallowing us to calculate the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) for\neach galaxy. Furthermore, we present new CO(1-0) data for 27 galaxies and\ncollect data from the literature to calculate the molecular gas mass for a\ntotal sample of 130 galaxies. This data set allows us to study the difference\nin the molecular gas fraction (Mmol/Mstar) and star formation efficiency\n(SFE=SFR/Mmol) between active, quiescent, and transitioning (i.e., canyon and\nIRTZ) galaxies. We find that transitioning galaxies have a mean molecular gas\nfraction and a mean SFE that are significantly lower than those of actively\nstar-forming galaxies. The molecular gas fraction is higher than that of\nquiescent galaxies, whereas the SFE is similar. These results indicate that the\ntransition from actively star-forming to quiescent in CG galaxies goes along\nwith a loss of molecular gas, possibly due to tidal forces exerted from the\nneighboring galaxies or a decrease in the gas density. In addition, the\nremaining molecular gas loses its ability to form stars efficiently, possibly\nowing to turbulence perturbing the gas, as seen in other, well-studied examples\nsuch as Stephan's Quintet and HCG~57. Thus, the amount and properties of\nmolecular gas play a crucial role in the environmentally driven transition of\ngalaxies from actively star forming to quiescent.\n", "  We use holographic duality to study the entanglement entropy (EE) of\nConformal Field Theories (CFTs) in various spacetime dimensions $d$, in the\npresence of various deformations: a relevant Lorentz scalar operator with\nconstant source, a temperature $T$, a chemical potential $\\mu$, a marginal\nLorentz scalar operator with source linear in a spatial coordinate, and a\ncircle-compactified spatial direction. We consider EE between a strip or sphere\nsub-region and the rest of the system, and define the \"entanglement density\"\n(ED) as the change in EE due to the deformation, divided by the sub-region's\nvolume. Using the deformed CFTs above, we show how the ED's dependence on the\nstrip width or sphere radius, $L$, is useful for characterizing states of\nmatter. For example, the ED's small-$L$ behavior is determined either by the\ndimension of the perturbing operator or by the first law of EE. For\nLorentz-invariant renormalization group (RG) flows between CFTs, the \"area\ntheorem\" states that the coefficient of the EE's area law term must be larger\nin the UV than in the IR. In these cases the ED must therefore approach zero\nfrom below as $L \\to \\infty$. However, when Lorentz symmetry is broken and the\nIR fixed point has different scaling from the UV, we find that the ED often\napproaches the thermal entropy density from above, indicating area theorem\nviolation.\n", "  Using $e^+e^-$ annihilation data taken at the CESR collider with the CLEO-c\ndetector, measurements of hyperon pair production cross sections and elastic\nand transition electromagnetic form factors have been made at the charmonium\nresonances: $\\psi(2S)$, $\\sqrt{s}=3.69$ GeV, $|Q^2|=13.6$ GeV$^2$,\n$\\mathcal{L}=48$~pb$^{-1}$; $\\psi(3770)$, $\\sqrt{s}=3.77$ GeV, $|Q^2|=14.2$\nGeV$^2$, $\\mathcal{L}=805$~pb$^{-1}$; and $\\psi(4170)$, $\\sqrt{s}=4.17$ GeV,\n$|Q^2|=17.4$ GeV$^2$, $\\mathcal{L}=586$~pb$^{-1}$. %High efficiency particle\nidentification has resulted in good statistical precision in the results.\nResults with good statistical precision are obtained with high efficiency\nparticle identification. Systematics of pair production cross sections, and\nform factors with respect to the number of strange quarks in the hyperons are\nstudied, and evidence is presented for effects of diquark correlations in\ncomparative results for $\\Lambda^0$ and $\\Sigma^0$, both of which have the same\n$uds$ quark content.\n", "  Horizonless spacetimes describing highly compact exotic objects with\nreflecting (instead of absorbing) surfaces have recently attracted much\nattention from physicists and mathematicians as possible quantum-gravity\nalternatives to canonical classical black-hole spacetimes. Interestingly, it\nhas recently been proved that spinning compact objects with angular momenta in\nthe sub-critical regime ${\\bar a}\\equiv J/M^2\\leq1$ are characterized by an\ninfinite countable set of surface radii, $\\{r_{\\text{c}}({\\bar\na};n)\\}^{n=\\infty}_{n=1}$, that can support asymptotically flat static\nconfigurations made of massless scalar fields. In the present paper we study\nanalytically the physical properties of ultra-spinning exotic compact objects\nwith dimensionless angular momenta in the complementary regime ${\\bar a}>1$. It\nis proved that ultra-spinning reflecting compact objects with dimensionless\nangular momenta in the super-critical regime\n$\\sqrt{1-[{{m}/{(l+2)}}]^2}\\leq|{\\bar a}|^{-1}<1$ are characterized by a finite\ndiscrete family of surface radii, $\\{r_{\\text{c}}({\\bar\na};n)\\}^{n=N_{\\text{r}}}_{n=1}$, distributed symmetrically around $r=M$, that\ncan support spatially regular static configurations of massless scalar fields\n(here the integers $\\{l,m\\}$ are the harmonic indices of the supported static\nscalar field modes). Interestingly, the largest supporting surface radius\n$r^{\\text{max}}_{\\text{c}}({\\bar a})\\equiv \\text{max}_n\\{r_{\\text{c}}({\\bar\na};n)\\}$ marks the onset of superradiant instabilities in the composed\nultra-spinning-exotic-compact-object-massless-scalar-field system.\n", "  The presence of incommensurate spiral spin-density waves (SDW) has been\nproposed to explain the $p$ (hole doping) to $1+p$ jump measured in the Hall\nnumber $n_H$ at a doping $p^*$. Here we explore {\\it collinear} incommensurate\nSDW as another possible explanation of this phenomenon, distinct from the\nincommensurate {\\it spiral} SDW proposal. We examine the effect of different\nSDW strengths and wavevectors and we find that the $n_H\\sim p$ behavior is\nhardly reproduced at low doping. The calculated $n_H$ and Fermi surfaces give\ncharacteristic features that should be observed, thus the lack of these\nfeatures in experiment suggests that the incommensurate collinear SDW is\nunlikely to be a good candidate to explain the $n_H\\sim p$ observed in the\npseudogap regime.\n", "  We show that, in the presence of bulk masses, sterile neutrinos propagating\nin large extra dimensions (LED) can induce electron-neutrino appearance\neffects. This is in contrast to what happens in the standard LED scenario and\nhence LED models with explicit bulk masses have the potential to address the\nMiniBooNE and LSND appearance results, as well as the reactor and Gallium\nanomalies. A special feature in our scenario is that the mixing of the first KK\nmodes to active neutrinos can be suppressed, making the contribution of heavier\nsterile neutrinos to oscillations relatively more important. We study the\nimplications of this neutrino mass generation mechanism for current and future\nneutrino oscillation experiments, and show that the Short-Baseline Neutrino\nProgram at Fermilab will be able to efficiently probe such a scenario. In\naddition, this framework leads to massive Dirac neutrinos and thus precludes\nany signal in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.\n", "  The coupled exciton-vibrational dynamics of a three-site model of the FMO\ncomplex is investigated using the Multi-layer Multi-configuration\nTime-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) approach. Emphasis is put on the effect of\nthe spectral density on the exciton state populations as well as on the\nvibrational and vibronic non-equilibrium excitations. Models which use either a\nsingle or site-specific spectral densities are contrasted to a spectral density\nadapted from experiment. For the transfer efficiency, the total integrated\nHuang-Rhys factor is found to be more important than details of the spectral\ndistributions. However, the latter are relevant for the obtained\nnon-equilibrium vibrational and vibronic distributions and thus influence the\nactual pattern of population relaxation.\n", "  We propose a polarimetric microwave imaging technique that exploits recent\nadvances in computational imaging. We utilize a frequency-diverse cavity-backed\nmetasurface, allowing us to demonstrate high-resolution polarimetric imaging\nusing a single transceiver and frequency sweep over the operational microwave\nbandwidth. The frequency-diverse metasurface imager greatly simplifies the\nsystem architecture compared with active arrays and other conventional\nmicrowave imaging approaches. We further develop the theoretical framework for\ncomputational polarimetric imaging and validate the approach experimentally\nusing a multi-modal leaky cavity. The scalar approximation for the interaction\nbetween the radiated waves and the target---often applied in microwave\ncomputational imaging schemes---is thus extended to retrieve the susceptibility\ntensors, and hence providing additional information about the targets.\nComputational polarimetry has relevance for existing systems in the field that\nextract polarimetric imagery, and particular for ground observation. A growing\nnumber of short-range microwave imaging applications can also notably benefit\nfrom computational polarimetry, particularly for imaging objects that are\ndifficult to reconstruct when assuming scalar estimations.\n", "  We identify an intrinsic mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect for\nnon-symmorphic chiral superconductors. This mechanism relies on both a\nnontrivial multi-band chiral superconducting order parameter, which is a\nmixture of pairings of even and odd angular momentum channels, and a complex\nnormal state inter-sublattice hopping, both of which are consequences of the\nnonsymmorphic group symmetry of the underlying lattice. We apply this mechanism\nto the putative chiral superconducting phase of the heavy-fermion\nsuperconductor $\\mathrm{UPt_3}$ and calculate the anomalous ac Hall\nconductivity in a simplified two-band model. From the ac Hall conductivity and\noptical data we estimate the polar Kerr rotation angle and compare it to the\nmeasured results for $\\mathrm{UPt_3}$ [E. R. Schemm \\textit{et al.}, Science\n\\textbf{345},190(2014)].\n", "  Cobimaximal lepton mixing, i.e. $\\theta_{23} = 45^\\circ$ and $\\delta = \\pm\n90^\\circ$ in the lepton mixing matrix $V$, arises as a consequence of $S V =\nV^\\ast \\mathcal{P}$, where $S$ is the permutation matrix that interchanges the\nsecond and third rows of $V$ and $\\mathcal{P}$ is a diagonal matrix of phase\nfactors. We prove that any such $V$ may be written in the form $V = U R P$,\nwhere $U$ is any predefined unitary matrix satisfying $S U = U^\\ast$, $R$ is an\northogonal, i.e. real, matrix, and $P$ is a diagonal matrix satisfying $P^2 =\n\\mathcal{P}$. Using this theorem, we demonstrate the equivalence of two ways of\nconstructing models for cobimaximal mixing---one way that uses a standard $CP$\nsymmetry and a different way that uses a $CP$ symmetry including $\\mu$--$\\tau$\ninterchange. We also present two simple seesaw models to illustrate this\nequivalence; those models have, in addition to the $CP$ symmetry, flavour\nsymmetries broken softly by the Majorana mass terms of the right-handed\nneutrino singlets. Since each of the two models needs four scalar doublets, we\ninvestigate how to accommodate the Standard Model Higgs particle in them.\n", "  We show for the first time that the generalized seniority scheme explains\nreasonably well the $B(E3)$ systematics for the $(0^+ \\rightarrow 3_1^-)$\ntransitions in the Sn-isotopes, which are odd-tensor $E3$ transitions\nconnecting different seniority states ($\\Delta v = 2$). Additionally, we also\npresent Large Scale Shell Model (LSSM) calculations to support our\ninterpretation. The generalized seniority scheme points to the octupole\ncharacter of these $3^-$ states in Sn isotopes.\n", "  We present vacuum spacetime solutions of first order gravity, which are\ndescribed by the exterior Schwarzschild geometry in one region and by\ndegenerate tetrads in the other. The invertible and noninvertible phases of the\ntetrad meet at an intermediate boundary across which the components of the\nmetric, affine connection and field-strength are all continuous. Within the\ndegenerate spacetime region, the noninvertibility of the tetrad leads to\nnonvanishing torsion. In contrast to the Schwarzschild spacetime which is the\nunique spherically symmetric solution of Einsteinian gravity, all the\nfield-strength components associated with these vacuum geometries remain finite\neverywhere.\n", "  We present observations of the known edge-on debris disk around HIP 79977 (HD\n146897, F star in Upper Sco, 123 pc), taken with the ZIMPOL differential\npolarimeter of the SPHERE instrument in the Very Broad Band filter\n($\\lambda_c=735$ nm, $\\Delta\\lambda=290$ nm) with a spatial resolution of about\n25 mas. We measure the polarization flux along and perpendicular to the disk\nspine of the highly inclined disk for projected separations between 0.2\" (25\nAU) and 1.6\" (200 AU) and investigate the diagnostic potential of such data\nwith model simulations. The polarized flux contrast ratio for the disk is\n$F_{pol}/F_\\ast= (5.5 \\pm 0.9) 10^{-4}$. The surface brightness reaches a\nmaximum of 16.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at a separation of $0.2\"-0.5\"$ along the disk\nspine with a maximum surface brightness contrast of 7.64 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The\npolarized flux has a minimum near the star $<0.2\"$ because no or only little\npolarization is produced by forward or backward scattering in the disk section\nlying in front of or behind the star. The data are modeled as a circular dust\nbelt with an inclination $i=85(\\pm 1.5)^\\circ$ and a radius between $r_0$ = 60\nAU and 90 AU. The radial density dependence is described by $(r/r_0)^{\\alpha}$\nwith a steep power law index $\\alpha=5$ inside $r_0$ and a more shallow index\n$\\alpha=-2.5$ outside $r_0$. The scattering asymmetry factor lies between $g$ =\n0.2 and 0.6 adopting a scattering angle-dependence for the fractional\npolarization as for Rayleigh scattering. Our data are qualitatively very\nsimilar to the case of AU Mic and they confirm that edge-on debris disks have a\npolarization minimum at a position near the star and a maximum near the\nprojected separation of the main debris belt. The comparison of the polarized\nflux contrast ratio $F_{pol}/F_{\\ast}$ with the fractional infrared excess\nprovides strong constraints on the scattering albedo of the dust.\n", "  The spinor helicity formalism (SHF) has been efficiently applied to compute\nperturbative amplitudes in plenty of processes and reactions in gauge theories\n(including gravity), mostly in the massless case. Some work has been done in\norder to extend the SHF to the massive case. We have used these powerful tools\nto evaluate amplitudes in a local supersymmetric model where the gravitino is\nthe lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Two decays have been evaluated in\norder to show the capability of the SHF in the massive extension, namely the\ntwo body neutralino decays $\\tilde{\\chi}_0\\to V\\tilde{\\Psi}^{\\mu}$ with\n$V=\\gamma, Z$. The comparisons of amplitudes with spin-3/2 gravitino and\nspin-1/2 goldstino are also presented.\n", "  A significant fraction of massive stars are found in multiple systems. The\neffect of binarity on stellar evolution is poorly constrained. In particular,\nthe role of tides and mass transfer on surface chemical abundances is not\nconstrained observationally. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect\nof binarity on the stellar properties and surface abundances of massive\nbinaries. We perform a spectroscopic analysis of six Galactic massive binaries.\nThe spectra of individual components are obtained from a spectral disentangling\nmethod and are subsequently analyzed by means of atmosphere models. The stellar\nparameters and CNO surface abundances are determined. Most systems are made of\nmain-sequence stars. Three systems are detached, two are in contact and no\ninformation is available for the sixth system. For eleven out of the twelve\nstars studied the surface abundances are only mildly affected by stellar\nevolution and mixing. They are not different from those of single stars, within\nthe uncertainties. The secondary of XZ~Cep is strongly chemically enriched.\nConsidering previous determinations of surface abundance in massive binary\nsystems suggests that the effect of tides on chemical mixing is limited,\nwhereas mass transfer and removal of outer layers of the mass donor leads to\nthe appearance of chemically processed material at the surface, although this\nis not systematic. The evolutionary masses of the components of our six systems\nare on average 16.5% higher than the dynamical masses. Some systems seem to\nhave reached synchronization, while others may still be in a transitory phase.\n", "  The proper-time regularization of bosonic string reproduces the results of\ncanonical quantization in a special scaling limit where the length in target\nspace has to be renormalized. We repeat the analysis for the Pauli-Villars\nregularization and demonstrate the universality of the results. In the\nmean-field approximation we compute the susceptibility anomalous dimension and\nshow it equals 1/2. We discuss the relation with the previously known results\non lattice strings.\n", "  To investigate whether the dark energy evolves over time, we propose two null\ntests and constrain them using the data combination of cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation, baryonic acoustic oscillations, Type Ia supernovae,\nPlanck-2015 lensing and cosmic chronometers. We find that, for these two\nmodels, there is no evidence of the dynamical dark energy at the $1.2\\sigma$\nconfidence level. Interestingly, both models could slightly alleviate (i) the\ncurrent Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension between the global fitting derivation\nby the Planck collaboration and the local observation by Riess {\\it et al.};\n(ii) the root-mean-square density fluctuations ($\\sigma_8$) tension between the\nPlanck-2015 data and several low-redshift large scale structure probes.\n", "  We analyse the phenomenology of a model of neutrino masses inspired by\n$\\mathrm{E}_{6}$ GUT unification in which the exotic neutrinos can be present\nat low scales. The model introduces vector-like isosinglet down-type quarks,\nvector-like isodoublet leptons, neutrino singlets and two $Z'$ bosons. The\nseesaw mechanism can be achieved with exotic neutrino masses as low as 100 GeV\nand Yukawa couplings of order $10^{-3}$. We find that the lightest $Z'$ boson\nmass is required to be above 2.8 TeV, the exotic quark masses are required to\nbe above 1.3 TeV (810 GeV) if they are collider stable (promptly decaying), and\nthe exotic lepton mass bounds remain at the LEP value of 102 GeV. The model\nalso presents a type-II two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) along with two heavy\nsinglet scalars. The 2HDM naturally has the alignment limit enforced thanks to\nthe large VEVs of the exotic scalars, thereby avoiding most constraints.\n", "  We numerically study a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate placed transiently\nover the critical rotation frequency i.e. in a regime where the rotation\nfrequency is larger than the radial frequency of the confinement. We study the\nreversibility of this process depending on the strength of the interactions and\nthe presence of vortices. We find that the reversibility is broken by the\ninteractions in the absence of vortices but systematically quasi-restored in\nthe presence of a single vortex.\n", "  We suggest that generalized parton distributions can be probed in charged\ncurrent meson production process, $ep\\to\\nu_{e}\\pi^{-}p$. In contrast to pion\nphotoproduction, this process is sensitive to the unpolarized GPDs $H,\\,E$, and\nfor this reason has a very small contamination by higher twist and\nBethe-Heitler type contributions. Since all produced hadrons are charged, we\nexpect that the kinematics of this process could be easily reconstructed. We\nestimated the cross-sections in the kinematics of upgraded 12 GeV Jefferson\nLaboratory experiments and found that thanks to large luminosity the process\ncan be measured with reasonable statistics.\n", "  Context. This research paper contains light curve modelling, spectroscopy and\ndetailed asteroseismic studies for four out of five in total semidetached\neclipsing binaries with a delta Scuti component, that have been detected to\ndate through Kepler mission, namely KIC 06669809, KIC 10581918, KIC 10619109\nand KIC 11175495.\n  Aims. The goal is to study the pulsational characteristics of the oscillating\nstars of the systems as well as to estimate their absolute parameters and\nenrich the so far poor sample of this kind of systems.\n  Methods. Ground based spectroscopic observations provide the means to\nestimate the spectral types of the primary components and to model the light\ncurves with higher certainty. The photometric data are analysed using eclipsing\nbinary modeling techniques, while Fourier analysis is applied on their\nresiduals in order to reveal the pulsation frequency modes.\n  Results. The results of analyses show that the primaries are pulsating stars\nof delta Scuti type and that all systems belong to the group of Algol type\nbinaries with an oscillating star, namely oEA stars. The primaries of KIC\n06669809, KIC 10581918, and KIC 10619109 pulsate in three, two, and five\nfrequencies, respectively and in more than 200 other detected as combinations.\nThe delta Scuti star of KIC 11175495 is the youngest and the fastest pulsator\nin binary systems that has ever been found and it oscillates in three main non\nradial frequencies, while other 153 are also found as depended ones. Moreover,\na comparison of their properties with other systems of the same type as well as\nwith theoretical models of pulsating stars are also presented and discussed.\n", "  In the first stages of inflationary reheating, the temperature of the\nradiation produced by inflaton decays is typically higher than the commonly\ndefined reheating temperature $T_{RH} \\sim (\\Gamma_\\phi M_P)^{1/2}$ where\n$\\Gamma_\\phi$ is the inflaton decay rate. We consider the effect of particle\nproduction at temperatures at or near the maximum temperature attained during\nreheating. We show that the impact of this early production on the final\nparticle abundance depends strongly on the temperature dependence of the\nproduction cross section. For $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\sim T^n/M^{n+2}$, and\nfor $n < 6$, any particle produced at $T_{\\rm max}$ is diluted by the later\ngeneration of entropy near $T_{RH}$. This applies to cases such as gravitino\nproduction in low scale supersymmetric models ($n=0$) or NETDM models of dark\nmatter ($n=2$). However, for $n\\ge6$ the net abundance of particles produced\nduring reheating is enhanced by over an order of magnitude, dominating over the\ndilution effect. This applies, for instance to gravitino production in high\nscale supersymmetry models where $n=6$.\n", "  The kinetics of CH$_2$OO reaction with ozone has been studied by monitoring\nCH$_2$OO with time-resolved infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy, which\nutilized fast chirped IR pulse train from a quantum cascade laser [J. Chem.\nPhys. 146, 244302 (2017)]. CH$_2$OO was prepared by photolyzing a gas mixture\nof CH$_2$I$_2$/O$_2$/O$_3$ at 352 nm; the photolysis wavelength was chosen to\nminimize the photodissociation of O$_3$. The measured rate coefficient at 298 K\nand 30 Torr is (6.7$\\pm$0.5)x10$^{-14}$ cm$^3$sec$^{-1}$, independent of\npressure from 30 to 100 Torr. The result indicates that previous ab initio\ncalculations either underestimated or overestimated this reaction rate by one\norder of magnitude or more. The result also implies that in laboratory studies\nof ozonolysis of alkenes, the reaction of Criegee intermediate with ozone may\nplay a role. However, this reaction would not compete with other CH$_2$OO sinks\nin the atmosphere.\n", "  A database of minima and transition states corresponds to a network where the\nminima represent nodes and the transition states correspond to edges between\nthe pairs of minima they connect via steepest-descent paths. Here we construct\nnetworks for small clusters bound by the Morse potential for a selection of\nphysically relevant parameters, in two and three dimensions. The properties of\nthese unweighted and undirected networks are analysed to examine two features:\nwhether they are small-world, where the shortest path between nodes involves\nonly a small number or edges; and whether they are scale-free, having a degree\ndistribution that follows a power law. Small-world character is present, but\nstatistical tests show that a power law is not a good fit, so the networks are\nnot scale-free. These results for clusters are compared with the corresponding\nproperties for the molecular and atomic structural glass formers\northo-terphenyl and binary Lennard-Jones. These glassy systems do not show\nsmall-world properties, suggesting that such behaviour is linked to the\nstructure-seeking landscapes of the Morse clusters.\n", "  We show that the Casimir effect may lead to a deconfinement phase transition\ninduced by the presence of boundaries in confining gauge theories. Using\nfirst-principle numerical simulations we demonstrate this phenomenon in the\nsimplest case of the compact lattice electrodynamics in two spatial dimensions.\nWe find that the critical temperature of the deconfinement transition in the\nvacuum between two parallel dielectric/metallic wires is a monotonically\nincreasing function of the separation between the wires. At infinite separation\nthe wires do not affect the critical temperature while at small separations the\nvacuum between the wires looses the confinement property due to modification of\nvacuum fluctuations of virtual monopoles.\n", "  We consider an extension of the Higgs sector in the standard model (SM) with\nsix Higgs doublets. The gauge couplings are unified without supersymmetry in\nthis model. The lightest of the extra Higgs particles, being stabilized by a\ndiscrete symmetry imposed from the outset, presents a plausible candidate for\ndark matter. For a specific acceptable benchmark point, we show that the model\nis viable regarding the constraints of relic density, direct detection and\ninvisible Higgs decay. We comment on the mean free path of the dark matter\ncandidate.\n", "  I present the effective potential at three-loop order for a general\nrenormalizable theory, using the \\MSbar renormalization scheme and Landau gauge\nfixing. As applications and illustrative points of reference, the results are\nspecialized to the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model and to the Standard Model.\nIn each case, renormalization group scale invariance provides a consistency\ncheck. In the Wess-Zumino model, the required vanishing of the minimum vacuum\nenergy yields an additional check. For the Standard Model, I carry out the\nresummation of Goldstone boson contributions, which provides yet more\nopportunities for non-trivial checks, and obtain the minimization condition for\nthe Higgs vacuum expectation value at full three-loop order. An infrared\ndivergence due to doubled photon propagators appears in the three-loop Standard\nModel effective potential, but it does not affect the minimization condition or\nphysical observables and can be eliminated by resummation.\n", "  We describe a multivariate classifier for candidate events in a templated\nsearch for gravitational-wave (GW) inspiral signals from\nneutron-star--black-hole (NS-BH) binaries, in data from ground-based detectors\nwhere sensitivity is limited by non-Gaussian noise transients. The standard\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and chi-squared test for inspiral searches use only\nproperties of a single matched filter at the time of an event; instead, we\npropose a classifier using features derived from a bank of inspiral templates\naround the time of each event, and also from a search using approximate\nsine-Gaussian templates. The classifier thus extracts additional information\nfrom strain data to discriminate inspiral signals from noise transients. We\nevaluate a Random Forest classifier on a set of single-detector events obtained\nfrom realistic simulated advanced LIGO data, using simulated NS-BH signals\nadded to the data. The new classifier detects a factor of 1.5 -- 2 more signals\nat low false positive rates as compared to the standard 're-weighted SNR'\nstatistic, and does not require the chi-squared test to be computed.\nConversely, if only the SNR and chi-squared values of single-detector events\nare available, Random Forest classification performs nearly identically to the\nre-weighted SNR.\n", "  Strong dipole-exchange interactions due to spontaneously produced contaminant\nstates can trigger rapid dephasing in many-body Rydberg ensembles [E.\nGoldschmidt et al., PRL 116, 113001 (2016)]. Such broadening has serious\nimplications for many proposals to coherently use Rydberg interactions,\nparticularly Rydberg dressing proposals. The dephasing arises as a runaway\nprocess where the production of the first contaminant atoms facilitates the\ncreation of more contaminant atoms. Here we study the time dependence of this\nprocess with stroboscopic approaches. Using a pump-probe technique, we create\nan excess \"pump\" Rydberg population and probe its effect with a different\n\"probe\" Rydberg transition. We observe a reduced resonant pumping rate and an\nenhancement of the excitation on both sides of the transition as atoms are\nadded to the pump state. We also observe a timescale for population growth\nsignificantly shorter than predicted by homogeneous mean-field models, as\nexpected from a clustered growth mechanism where high-order correlations\ndominate the dynamics. These results support earlier works and confirm that the\ntime scale for the onset of dephasing is reduced by a factor which scales as\nthe inverse of the atom number. In addition, we discuss several approaches to\nminimize these effects of spontaneous broadening, including stroboscopic\ntechniques and operating at cryogenic temperatures. It is challenging to avoid\nthe unwanted broadening effects, but under some conditions they can be\nmitigated.\n", "  We present optical integral field spectroscopy for five $z<0.062$ narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) host galaxies, probing their host galaxies at\n$\\gtrsim 2-3$ kpc scales. Emission lines in the nuclear AGN spectra and the\nlarge-scale host galaxy are analyzed separately, based on an AGN-host\ndecomposition technique. The host galaxy gas kinematics indicates large-scale\ngas rotation in all five sources. At the probed scales of $\\gtrsim 2-3$ kpc,\nthe host galaxy gas is found to be predominantly ionized by star formation\nwithout any evidence of a strong AGN contribution. None of the five objects\nshows specific star formation rates exceeding the main sequence of low-redshift\nstar forming galaxies. The specific star formation rates for MCG-05-01-013 and\nWPVS 007 are roughly consistent with the main sequence, while ESO 399-IG20, MS\n22549-3712, and TON S180 show lower specific star formation rates, intermediate\nto the main sequence and red quiescent galaxies. The host galaxy metallicities,\nderived for the two sources with sufficient data quality (ESO 399-IG20 and\nMCG-05-01-013), indicate central oxygen abundances just below the low-redshift\nmass-metallicity relation. Based on this initial case study, we outline a\ncomparison of AGN and host galaxy parameters as a starting point for future\nextended NLS1 studies with similar methods.\n", "  We present a set of experimentally feasible pulse sequences that implement\nany single-qubit gate on a singlet-triplet spin qubit and demonstrate that\nthese new sequences are up to three times faster than existing sequences in the\nliterature. We show that these sequences can be extended to incorporate\nbuilt-in dynamical error correction, yielding gates that are robust to both\ncharge and magnetic field noise and up to twice as fast as previous dynamically\ncorrected gate schemes. We present a thorough comparison of the performance of\nour new sequences with that of several existing ones using randomized\nbenchmarking, considering both quasistatic and $1/f^\\alpha$ noise models. We\nprovide our results both as a function of evolution time and as a function of\nthe number of gates, which respectively yield both an effective coherence time\nand an estimate of the number of gates that can be performed within this\ncoherence time. We determine which set of pulse sequences gives the best\nresults for a wide range of noise strengths and power spectra. Overall, we find\nthat the traditional, slower sequences perform best when there is no field\nnoise or when the noise contains significant high-frequency components;\notherwise, our new, fast sequences exhibit the best performance.\n", "  We study heat flux avalanches occurring at the first order transition in\nLa(Fe-Mn-Si)$_{13}$-H$_{1.65}$ magnetocaloric material. As the transition is\nassociated to the phase boundaries motion that gives rise to the latent heat,\nwe develop a non equilibrium thermodynamic model. By comparing the model with\nexperimental calorimetry data available for Mn=0.18, we find the values of the\nintrinsic kinetic parameter $R_L$, expressing the damping for the moving\nboundary interface, at different magnetic fields. We conclude that by\nincreasing field, thus approaching the critical point, the avalanches increase\nin number and their kinetics is slowed down.\n", "  Non-Gaussian correlations induced in CMB power spectra by gravitational\nlensing must be included in likelihood analyses for future CMB experiments. We\npresent a simple but accurate likelihood model which includes these\ncorrelations and use it for Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation from\nsimulated lensed CMB maps in the context of $\\Lambda$CDM and extensions which\ninclude the sum of neutrino masses or the dark energy equation of state $w$. If\nlensing-induced covariance is not taken into account for a CMB-S4 type\nexperiment, the errors for one combination of parameters in each case would be\nunderestimated by more then a factor of two and lower limits on $w$ could be\nmisestimated substantially. The frequency of falsely ruling out the true model\nor finding tension with other data sets would also substantially increase. Our\nanalysis also enables a separation of lens and unlensed information from CMB\npower spectra, which provides for consistency tests of the model and, if\ncombined with other such measurements, a nearly lens-sample-variance free test\nfor systematics and new physics in the unlensed spectrum. This parameterization\nalso leads to a simple effective likelihood that can be used to assist model\nbuilding in case consistency tests of $\\Lambda$CDM fail.\n", "  The statistical uncertainties of 13 model parameters in the\nWeizs\\\"acker-Skyrme (WS*) mass model are investigated for the first time with\nan efficient approach, and the propagated errors in the predicted masses are\nestimated. The discrepancies between the predicted masses and the experimental\ndata, including the new data in AME2016, are almost all smaller than the model\nerrors. For neutron-rich heavy nuclei, the model errors increase considerably,\nand go up to a few MeV when the nucleus approaches the neutron drip line. The\nmost sensitive model parameter which causes the largest statistical error is\nanalyzed for all bound nuclei. We find that the two coefficients of symmetry\nenergy term significantly influence the mass predictions of extremely\nneutron-rich nuclei, and the deformation energy coefficients play a key role\nfor well-deformed nuclei around the $\\beta$-stability line.\n", "  The effects of hole injection in amorphous-IGZO is analyzed by means of\nfirst-principles calculations. The injection of holes in the valence band tail\nstates leads to their capture as a polaron, with high self-trapping energies\n(from 0.44 to 1.15 eV). Once formed, they mediate the formation of peroxides\nand remain localized close to the hole injection source due to the presence of\na large diffusion energy barrier (of at least 0.6eV). Their diffusion mechanism\ncan be mediated by the presence of hydrogen. The capture of these holes is\ncorrelated with the low off-current observed for a-IGZO transistors, as well\nas, with the difficulty to obtain a p-type conductivity. The results further\nsupport the formation of peroxides as being the root cause of Negative bias\nillumination stress (NBIS). The strong self-trapping substantially reduces the\ninjection of holes from the contact and limits the creation of peroxides from a\ndirect hole injection. In presence of light, the concentration of holes\nsubstantially rises and mediates the creation of peroxides, responsible for\nNBIS.\n", "  Fluid flows in nature and applications are frequently subject to periodic\nvelocity modulations. Surprisingly, even for the generic case of flow through a\nstraight pipe, there is little consensus regarding the influence of pulsation\non the transition threshold to turbulence: while most studies predict a\nmonotonically increasing threshold with pulsation frequency (i.e. Womersley\nnumber, $\\alpha$), others observe a decreasing threshold for identical\nparameters and only observe an increasing threshold at low $\\alpha$. In the\npresent study we apply recent advances in the understanding of transition in\nsteady shear flows to pulsating pipe flow. For moderate pulsation amplitudes we\nfind that the first instability encountered is subcritical (i.e. requiring\nfinite amplitude disturbances) and gives rise to localized patches of\nturbulence (\"puffs\") analogous to steady pipe flow. By monitoring the impact of\npulsation on the lifetime of turbulence we map the onset of turbulence in\nparameter space. Transition in pulsatile flow can be separated into three\nregimes. At small Womersley numbers the dynamics are dominated by the decay\nturbulence suffers during the slower part of the cycle and hence transition is\ndelayed significantly. As shown in this regime thresholds closely agree with\nestimates based on a quasi steady flow assumption only taking puff decay rates\ninto account. The transition point predicted in the zero $\\alpha$ limit equals\nto the critical point for steady pipe flow offset by the oscillation Reynolds\nnumber. In the high frequency limit puff lifetimes are identical to those in\nsteady pipe flow and hence the transition threshold appears to be unaffected by\nflow pulsation. In the intermediate frequency regime the transition threshold\nsharply drops (with increasing $\\alpha$) from the decay dominated (quasi\nsteady) threshold to the steady pipe flow level.\n", "  We study for the first time the dynamical properties and the growth index of\nlinear matter perturbations of the Finsler-Randers (FR) cosmological model, for\nwhich we consider that the cosmic fluid contains matter, radiation and a scalar\nfield. Initially, for various FR scenarios we implement a critical point\nanalysis and we find solutions which provide cosmic acceleration and under\ncertain circumstances we can have de-Sitter points as stable late-time\nattractors. Then we derive the growth index of matter fluctuations in various\nFinsler-Randers cosmologies. Considering cold dark matter and neglecting the\nscalar field component from the perturbation analysis we find that the\nasymptotic value of the growth index is $\\gamma_{\\infty}^{(FR)}\\approx\\frac\n{9}{16}$, which is close to that of the concordance $\\Lambda$ cosmology,\n$\\gamma^{(\\Lambda)} \\approx\\frac{6}{11}$. In this context, we show that the\ncurrent FR model provides the same Hubble expansion with that of Dvali,\nGabadadze and Porrati (DGP) gravity model. However, the two models can be\ndistinguished at the perturbation level since the growth index of FR model is\n$\\sim18.2\\%$ lower than that of the DPG gravity $\\gamma^{(DGP)} \\approx\n\\frac{11}{16}$. If we allow pressure in the matter fluid then we obtain\n$\\gamma_{\\infty}^{(FR)}\\approx\\frac{9(1+w_{m})(1+2w_{m})}{2[8+3w_{m}%\n(5+3w_{m})]}$, where $w_{m}$ is the matter equation of state parameter.\nFinally, we extend the growth index analysis by using the scalar field and we\nfind that the evolution of the growth index in FR cosmologies is affected by\nthe presence of scalar field.\n", "  We develop a Green's function formalism for spin transport through\nheterostructures that contain metallic leads and insulating ferromagnets. While\nthis formalism in principle allows for the inclusion of various magnonic\ninteractions, we focus on Gilbert damping. As an application, we consider\nballistic spin transport by exchange magnons in a metal-insulator-metal\nheterostructure with and without disorder. For the former case, we show that\nthe interplay between disorder and Gilbert damping leads to spin current\nfluctuations. For the case without disorder, we obtain the dependence of the\ntransmitted spin current on the thickness of the ferromagnet. Moreover, we show\nthat the results of the Green's function formalism agree in the clean and\ncontinuum limit with those obtained from the linearized stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The developed Green's function formalism is a\nnatural starting point for numerical studies of magnon transport in\nheterostructures that contain normal metals and magnetic insulators.\n", "  In this paper, we apply Fokas unified method to study initial-boundary value\nproblems for the two-component Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation formulated on the\nfinite interval with $3 \\times 3$ Lax pairs. The solution can be expressed in\nterms of the solution of a $3\\times3$ Riemann-Hilbert problem. The relevant\njump matrices are explicitly given in terms of three matrix-value spectral\nfunctions $s(\\lambda)$, $S(\\lambda)$ and $S_L(\\lambda)$, which arising from the\ninitial values at $t=0$, boundary values at $x=0$ and boundary values at $x=L$,\nrespectively. Moreover, The associated Dirichlet to Neumann map is analyzed via\nthe global relation. The relevant formulae for boundary value problems on the\nfinite interval can reduce to ones on the half-line as the length of the\ninterval tends to infinity.\n", "  Constraints on cosmological parameters from large-scale structure have\ntraditionally been obtained from two-point statistics. However, non-linear\nstructure formation renders these statistics insufficient in capturing the full\ninformation content available, necessitating the measurement of higher-order\nmoments to recover information which would otherwise be lost. We construct\nquantities based on non-linear and non-local transformations of weakly\nnon-Gaussian fields that Gaussianize the full multivariate distribution at a\ngiven order in perturbation theory. Our approach does not require a model of\nthe fields themselves and takes as input only the first few polyspectra, which\ncould be modelled or measured from simulations or data, making our method\nparticularly suited to observables lacking a robust perturbative description\nsuch as the weak-lensing shear. We apply our method to simulated density\nfields, finding a significantly reduced bispectrum and an enhanced correlation\nwith the initial field. We demonstrate that our method reconstructs a large\nproportion of the linear baryon acoustic oscillations, improving the\ninformation content over the raw field by 35%. We apply the transform to toy\n21cm intensity maps, showing that our method still performs well in the\npresence of complications such as redshift-space distortions, beam smoothing,\npixel noise, and foreground subtraction. We discuss how this method might\nprovide a route to constructing a perturbative model of the fully non-Gaussian\nmultivariate likelihood function.\n", "  We study the polymer quantization of a homogeneous massive scalar field in\nthe early universe using a prescription inequivalent to those previously\nappearing in the literature. Specifically, we assume a Hilbert space for which\nthe scalar field momentum is well defined but its amplitude is not. This is\ncloser in spirit to the quantization scheme of loop quantum gravity, in which\nno unique configuration operator exists. We show that in the semi-classical\napproximation, the main effect of this polymer quantization scheme is to\ncompactify the phase space of chaotic inflation in the field amplitude\ndirection. This gives rise to an effective scalar potential closely resembling\nthat of hybrid natural inflation. Unlike polymer schemes in which the scalar\nfield amplitude is well-defined, the semi-classical dynamics involves a past\ncosmological singularity; i.e., this approach does not mitigate the big bang.\n", "  Magnetic fields are detected in a few percent of white dwarfs. The number of\nsuch magnetic white dwarfs known is now some hundreds. Fields range in strength\nfrom a few kG to several hundred MG. Almost all the known magnetic white dwarfs\nhave a mean field modulus >= 1 MG. We are trying to fill a major gap in\nobservational knowledge at the low field limit (<= 200 kG) using circular\nspectro-polarimetry.\n  In this paper we report the discovery and monitoring of strong, periodic\nmagnetic variability in two previously discovered \"super-weak field\" magnetic\nwhite dwarfs, WD2047+372 and WD2359-434. WD2047+372 has a mean longitudinal\nfield that reverses between about -12 and +15 kG, with a period of 0.243 d,\nwhile its mean field modulus appears nearly constant at 60 kG. The observations\ncan be intepreted in terms of a dipolar field tilted with respect to the\nstellar rotation axis. WD2359-434 always shows a weak positive longitudinal\nfield with values between about 0 and +12 kG, varying only weakly with stellar\nrotation, while the mean field modulus varies between about 50 and 100 kG. The\nrotation period is found to be 0.112 d using the variable shape of the Halpha\nline core, consistent with available photometry. The field of this star appears\nto be much more complex than a dipole, and is probably not axisymmetric.\n  Available photometry shows that WD2359-434 is a light variable with an\namplitude of only 0.005 mag, our own photometry shows that if WD2047+372 is\nphotometrically variable, the amplitude is below about 0.01 mag.\n  These are the first models for magnetic white dwarfs with fields below about\n100 kG based on magnetic measurements through the full stellar rotation. They\nreveal two very different magnetic surface configurations, and that, contrary\nto simple ohmic decay theory, WD2359-434 has a much more complex surface field\nthan the much younger WD2047+372.\n", "  We consider Kohn-Luttinger mechanism for superconductivity in a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas confined to a narrow well between two metallic\nplanes with two occupied subbands with Fermi momenta $k_{FL} > k_{FS}$. On the\nbasis of a perturbative analysis, we conclude that non-s-wave superconductivity\nemerges even when the bands are parabolic. We analyze the conditions that\nmaximize $T_c$ as a function of the distance to the metallic planes, the ratio\n$k_{FL}/k_{FS}$, and $r_s$, which measures the strength of Coulomb\ncorrelations. The largest attraction is in p-wave and d-wave channels, of which\np-wave is typically the strongest. For $r_s = O(1)$ we estimate that the\ndimensionless coupling $\\lambda \\approx 10^{-1}$, but it likely continues\nincreasing for larger $r_s$ (where we lose theoretical control).\n", "  We generalize the mechanism for gravitational baryogensis in the context of\n$f(R)$ theories of gravity, including a nonminimal coupling between curvature\nand matter. In these models, the baryon asymmetry is generated through an\neffective coupling between the Ricci scalar curvature and the net baryon\ncurrent that dynamically breaks Charge Conjugation, Parity and Time Reversal\n(CPT) invariance. We study the combinations of characteristic mass scales and\nexponents for both non-trivial functions present in the modified action\nfunctional and establish the allowed region for these parameters: we find that\nvery small deviations from General Relativity are consistent with the observed\nbaryon asymmetry and lead to temperatures compatible with the subsequent\nformation of the primordial abundances of light elements. In particular, we\nshow the viability of a power-law nonminimal coupling function $f_2(R) \\sim\nR^n$ with $ 0 < n \\lesssim 0.078 $ and determine its characteristic curvature\nscale.\n", "  We analyse the impact of the inverse square law fall-off of the energy\ndensity in a charged isotropic spherically symmetric fluid. Initially we impose\na linear barotropic equation of state $p=\\alpha \\rho$ but this leads to an\nintractable differential equation. Next we consider the neutral isothermal\nmetric of Saslaw, Maharaj and Dadhich (1996) in an electric field and the usual\ninverse square law of energy density and pressure results thus preserving the\nequation of state. Additionally, we discard a linear equation of state and\nendeavour to find new classes of solutions with the inverse square law fall off\nof density. Certain prescribed forms of the spatial and temporal gravitational\nforms result in new exact solutions. An interesting result that emerges is that\nwhile isothermal fluid spheres are unbounded in the neutral case, this is not\nso when charge is involved. Indeed it was found that barotropic equations of\nstate exist and hypersurfaces of vanishing pressure exist establishing a\nboundary in practically all models. One model was studied in depth and found to\nsatisfy other elementary requirements for physical admissability such as a\nsubluminal sound speed as well as gravitational surface redshifts smaller than\n2. The Buchdahl (1959), Bohmer and Harko (2007) and Andreasson (2009)\nmass-radius bounds were also found to be satisfied. Graphical plots utilising\nconstants selected from the boundary conditions established that the model\ndisplayed characteristics consistent with physically viable models.\n", "  We describe some general results that constrain the dynamical fluctuations\nthat can occur in non-equilibrium steady states, with a focus on molecular\ndynamics. That is, we consider Hamiltonian systems, coupled to external heat\nbaths, and driven out of equilibrium by non-conservative forces. We focus on\nthe probabilities of rare events (large deviations). First, we discuss a PT\n(parity-time) symmetry that appears in ensembles of trajectories where a\ncurrent is constrained to have a large (non-typical) value. We analyse the heat\nflow in such ensembles, and compare it with non-equilibrium steady states.\nSecond, we consider pathwise large deviations that are defined by considering\nmany copies of a system. We show how the probability currents in such systems\ncan be decomposed into orthogonal contributions, that are related to\nconvergence to equilibrium and to dissipation. We discuss the implications of\nthese results for modelling non-equilibrium steady states.\n", "  An extensive study of the compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory with a higher\nderivative gauge-fixing term and a suitable counter-term has been undertaken to\ndetermine the nature of the possible continuum limits for a wide range of the\nparameters, especially at strong gauge couplings ($g>1$), adding to our\nprevious study at a single gauge coupling $g=1.3$ \\cite{DeSarkar2016}. Our\nmajor conclusion is that a continuum limit of free massless photons (with the\nredundant pure gauge degrees of freedom decoupled) is achieved at any gauge\ncoupling, not necessarily small, provided the coefficient $\\tilde{\\kappa}$ of\nthe gauge-fixing term is sufficiently large. In fact, the region of continuous\nphase transition leading to the above physics in the strong gauge coupling\nregion is found to be analytically connected to the point $g=0$ and\n$\\tilde{\\kappa} \\rightarrow \\infty$ where the classical action has a global\nunique minimum, around which weak coupling perturbation theory in bare\nparameters is defined, controlling the physics of the whole region. A second\nmajor conclusion is that, local algorithms like Multihit Metropolis fail to\nproduce faithful field configurations with large values of the coefficient\n$\\tilde{\\kappa}$ of the higher derivative gauge-fixing term and at large\nlattice volumes. A global algorithm like Hybrid Monte Carlo, although at times\nslow to move out of metastabilities, generally is able to produce faithful\nconfigurations and has been used extensively in the current study.\n", "  We present a universal theory for the critical behavior of an impurity at the\ntwo-dimensional superfluid-Mott insulator transition. Our analysis is motivated\nby a numerical study of the Bose-Hubbard model with an impurity site by Huang\net al. (Phys. Rev. B 94, 220502 (2016)), who found an impurity phase transition\nas a function of the trapping potential. The bulk theory is described by the\n$O(2)$ symmetric Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory, and we model the\nimpurity by a localized spin-1/2 degree of freedom. We also consider a\ngeneralized model by considering an $O(N)$ symmetric bulk theory coupled to a\nspin-$S$ degree of freedom. We study this field theory using the $\\epsilon = 3\n- d$ expansion, where the impurity-bulk interaction flows to an infrared stable\nfixed point at the critical trapping potential. We determine the scaling\ndimensions of the impurity degree of freedom and the associated critical\nexponents near the critical point. We also determine the universal contribution\nof the impurity to the finite temperature compressibility of the system at\ncriticality. Our results are compared with recent numerical simulations.\n", "  We study the chiral Ising, the chiral XY and the chiral Heisenberg models at\nfour-loop order with the perturbative renormalization group in $4-\\epsilon$\ndimensions and compute critical exponents for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa fixed\npoints to order $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^4)$. Further, we provide Pad\\'e estimates\nfor the correlation length exponent, the boson and fermion anomalous dimension\nas well as the leading correction to scaling exponent in 2+1 dimensions. We\nalso confirm the emergence of supersymmetric field theories at four loops for\nthe chiral Ising and the chiral XY models with $N=1/4$ and $N=1/2$ fermions,\nrespectively. Furthermore, applications of our results relevant to various\nquantum transitions in the context of Dirac and Weyl semimetals are discussed,\nincluding interaction-induced transitions in graphene and surface states of\ntopological insulators.\n", "  We present a holographic bottom up model for the thermal behavior of $ c \\bar\nc$ vector mesons in a finite temperature and density plasma. There is a clear\nphysical interpretation for the three imput energy parameters of the model. Two\nof them are related to the mass spectrum of the heavy meson. Namely the quark\nmass and the string tension of the quark anti-quark interaction. The third\nparameter is a large energy scale associated with the non-hadronic meson decay.\nIn such a process the heavy meson is transformed into a much lighter state by\nelectroweak processes. The corresponding transition amplitude is assumed to\ndepend on the enegy scale associated with this large mass variation. With this\nthree parameter model one can fit the masses and decay constants of $ J / \\Psi\n$ and three radial excitations with an rms error of 20.7 %. Using the geometry\nof a charged black hole, one finds the spectral function for charmonium states\ninside a plasma at finite temperature and density. The charmonium dissociation\nin the medium is represented by the decrease in the height of the spectral\nfunction peaks.\n", "  The angular distributions of $^{8}$Be states in the excitation energy region,\nE$_{x}$ $\\ \\sim$($16.5-18.2$) MeV, produced in the $^{7}$Li($^{3}%\n$He,d)$^{8}$Be proton transfer reaction have been measured at the Orsay\n14.8$-$MV tandem accelerator for $^{3}$He$^{2+}$ ion bombarding energy,\nE$_{lab}$ $=20$ MeV, and forward anglular range,\n$\\theta_{lab}=5^{\\circ}-50^{\\circ}$. A high energy resolution detection system\ncomposed of a split-pole magnetic spectrometer and a $\\Delta E-E$,\\\nposition-sensitive drift chamber was used to record the energy spectra of\noutgoing deuterons. The measured cross section data for the direct reaction\ncomponent have been separated from the compound nucleus one, then analyzed in\nthe framework of the non local, FR-DWBA theory. New values of the $C^{2}S$ and\n($S_{p1/2},$ $S_{p3/2})$ proton absolute and partial spectroscopic factors and\nrelated $\\gamma_{p}^{2}(a)$\\ proton reduced widths versus the p $+$ $^{7}$Li\nchannel radius have been extracted for the $2^{+}(16.626)$ and\n$2^{+}(16.922),T=0+1$ isospin-mixed loosely bound states of astrophysical\ninterest and the $1^{+}(17.640)$, $T=1$ unbound state of $^{8}$Be. They are\ncompared to sparse earlier experimental values and to shell-model predicted\nones from the literature, and are discussed. In particular, the status of the\nspectroscopic information on the $2^{+}$ isospin-mixed doublet is reviewed and\nup-dated. The application in nuclear astrophysics of the DWBA derived results\nis emphasised.\n", "  Monte Carlo techniques have played an important role in understanding\nstrongly-correlated systems across many areas of physics, covering a wide range\nof energy and length scales. Among the many Monte Carlo methods applicable to\nquantum mechanical systems, the path integral Monte Carlo approach with its\nvariants has been employed widely. Since semi-classical or classical approaches\nwill not be discussed in this review, path integral based approaches can for\nour purposes be divided into two categories: approaches applicable to quantum\nmechanical systems at zero temperature and approaches applicable to quantum\nmechanical systems at finite temperature. While these two approaches are\nrelated to each other, the underlying formulation and aspects of the algorithm\ndiffer. This paper reviews the path integral Monte Carlo ground state (PIGS)\napproach, which solves the time-independent Schroedinger equation.\nSpecifically, the PIGS approach allows for the determination of expectation\nvalues with respect to eigen states of the few- or many-body Schroedinger\nequation provided the system Hamiltonian is known. The theoretical framework\nbehind the PIGS algorithm, implementation details, and sample applications for\nsermonic systems are presented.\n", "  The integrated massless vertex operator in an $AdS_5\\times S^5$ background in\nthe pure spinor formalism is constructed in terms of superfields.\n", "  The metamaterial is proposed which supports a mixture of three or more normal\nand backward electromagnetic modes with equal co-directed phase velocities and\nmutually contra-directed energy fluxes. This enables extraordinary three-wave\nmixing, greatly enhanced optical parametric amplification and\nfrequency-changing generation of entangled photons in the reflection direction.\nProof-of-principle numerical simulation of such processes is presented based on\nthe particular example of the wave-guided THz waves contra-propagating in the\nmetamaterial made of carbon nanotubes.\n", "  The second-generation beam combiner at the Very Large Telescope (VLT),\nGRAVITY, observes the stars orbiting the compact object located at the center\nof our galaxy, with an unprecedented astrometric accuracy of 10 $\\mu$as. The\nnature of this compact source is still unknown since black holes are not the\nonly candidates explaining the four million solar masses at the Galactic\ncenter. Boson stars are such an alternative model to black holes. This paper\nfocuses on the study of trajectories of stars orbiting a boson star and a Kerr\nblack hole. We put in light strong differences between orbits obtained in both\nmetrics when considering stars with sufficiently close pericenters to the\ncompact object, typically $\\lesssim 30~M$. Discovery of closer stars to the\nGalactic center than the S2 star by the GRAVITY instrument would thus be a\npowerful tool to possibly constrain the nature of the central source.\n", "  If the FRW metric is a good approximation on large scales, then the distance\nand the expansion rate, as well different notions of distance, satisfy certain\nconsistency conditions. We fit the JLA SNIa distance data to determine the\nexpected amplitude of the violation of these conditions if accelerated\nexpansion is due to backreaction. Adding cosmic clock and BAO expansion rate\ndata, we also model-independently determine the current observational limits on\nsuch violation.\n  We find that the predicted maximum backreaction amplitude $|k_H|\\lesssim1$\n(95% C.I.) is of the same order as the current observational constraints\n$|k_H|\\lesssim1$, the precise numbers depending on the adopted fitting method\n(polynomials or splines) and stellar population evolution model. We also find\nthat constraints on the value of $H_0$ determined from expansion rate data are\nsensitive to the stellar evolution model. We forecast constraints from\nprojected LSST+Euclid-like SNIa plus Euclid galaxy differential age data. We\nfind improvement by factor of 6 for the backreaction case and 3 for the\nmodel-independent case, probing an interesting region of possible signatures.\n", "  Testing, in a non-trivial, model-independent way, the hypothesis that the\nthree-massive-neutrinos paradigm properly describes nature is among the main\ngoals of the current and the next generation of neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. In the coming decade, the DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments\nwill be able to study the oscillation of both neutrinos and antineutrinos with\nunprecedented precision. We explore the ability of these experiments, and\ncombinations of them, to determine whether the parameters that govern these\noscillations are the same for neutrinos and antineutrinos, as prescribed by the\nCPT-theorem. We find that both DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande will be sensitive to\nunexplored levels of leptonic CPT-violation. Assuming the parameters for\nneutrino and antineutrinos are unrelated, we discuss the ability of these\nexperiments to determine the neutrino and antineutrino mass-hierarchies,\natmospheric-mixing octants, and CP-odd phases, three key milestones of the\nexperimental neutrino physics program. Additionally, if the CPT-theorem is\nviolated in nature in a way that is consistent with all present neutrino and\nantineutrino oscillation data, we find that DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande have the\npotential to ultimately establish CPT-invariance violation.\n", "  The 2d Heisenberg model --- or 2d O(3) model --- is popular in condensed\nmatter physics, and in particle physics as a toy model for QCD. Along with\nother analogies, it shares with 4d Yang-Mills theories, and with QCD, the\nproperty that the configurations are divided in topological sectors. In the\nlattice regularisation the topological charge $Q$ can still be defined such\nthat $Q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. It has generally been observed, however, that the\ntopological susceptibility $\\chi_{\\rm t} = \\langle Q^2 \\rangle / V$ does not\nscale properly in the continuum limit, i.e. that the quantity $\\chi_{\\rm t}\n\\xi^2$ diverges for $\\xi \\to \\infty$ (where $\\xi$ is the correlation length in\nlattice units). Here we address the question whether or not this divergence\npersists after the application of the Gradient Flow.\n", "  In position dependent mass (PDM) problems, the quantum dynamics of the\nassociated systems have been understood well in the literature for particular\norderings. However, no efforts seem to have been made to solve such PDM\nproblems for general orderings to obtain a global picture. In this connection,\nwe here consider the general ordered quantum Hamiltonian of an interesting\nposition dependent mass problem, namely the Mathews-Lakshmanan oscillator, and\ntry to solve the quantum problem for all possible orderings including Hermitian\nand non-Hermitian ones. The other interesting point in our study is that for\nall possible orderings, although the Schr\\\"odinger equation of this\nMathews-Lakshmanan oscillator is uniquely reduced to the associated Legendre\ndifferential equation, their eigenfunctions cannot be represented in terms of\nthe associated Legendre polynomials with integral degree and order. Rather the\neigenfunctions are represented in terms of associated Legendre polynomials with\nnon-integral degree and order. We here explore such polynomials and represent\nthe discrete and continuum states of the system. We also exploit the connection\nbetween associated Legendre polynomials with non-integral degree with other\northogonal polynomials such as Jacobi and Gegenbauer polynomials.\n", "  The reconstruction of water wave elevation from bottom pressure measurements\nis an important issue for coastal applications, but corresponds to a difficult\nmathematical problem. In this paper we present the derivation of a method which\nallows the elevation reconstruction of water waves in intermediate and shallow\nwaters. From comparisons with numerical Euler solutions and wave-tank\nexperiments we show that our nonlinear method provides much better results of\nthe surface elevation reconstruction compared to the linear transfer function\napproach commonly used in coastal applications. More specifically, our\nmethodaccurately reproduces the peaked and skewed shape of nonlinear wave\nfields. Therefore, it is particularly relevant for applications on extreme\nwaves and wave-induced sediment transport.\n", "  We compute the 20 lowest frequency radial oscillation modes of strange stars\nadmixed with condensed dark matter. We assume a self-interacting bosonic dark\nmatter, and we model dark matter inside the star as a Bose-Einstein condensate.\nIn this case the equation of state is a polytropic one with index $1+1/n=2$ and\na constant $K$ that is computed in terms of the mass of the dark matter\nparticle and the scattering length. Assuming a mass and a scattering length\ncompatible with current observational bounds for self-interacting dark matter,\nwe have integrated numerically first the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations\nfor the hydrostatic equilibrium, and then the equations for the perturbations\n$\\xi=\\Delta r/r$ and $\\eta=\\Delta P/P$. For a compact object with certain mass\nand radius we have considered here three cases, namely no dark matter at all\nand two different dark matter scenarios. Our results show that i) the\nseparation between consecutive modes increases with the amount of dark matter,\nand ii) the effect is more pronounced for higher order modes. These effects are\nrelevant even for a strange star made of 5\\% dark matter.\n", "  We present a new optical scheme for BB84 protocol quantum key distribution\n(QKD). The proposed setup consists of a compact all-fiber polarization encoding\noptical scheme based on LiNbO3 phase modulators, single laser source and two\nsingle-photon detectors. Optical scheme consists of standard telecommunication\ncomponents and is suitable for both fiber and free-space quantum communication\nchannels. Low losses (~2dB) in Bob's device increase both the key generation\nrate and distance limit. A new technique for solving polarization mode\ndispersion (PMD) issue in LiNbO3 is implemented, allowing two crystals to\nneutralize the effect of each other. Several proof-of-concept experiments have\nbeen conducted at 10 MHz repetition frequency over 50 km of standard optical\nfiber under laboratory conditions and over 30 km of urban fiber with high\nlosses (13dB), which is a link within a QKD network. To achieve this,\ncalibration algorithms have been developed, allowing the system to work\nautonomously and making it promising for practical applications.\n", "  Apoptosis is essential for numerous processes, such as development,\nresistance to infections, and suppression of tumorigenesis. Here, we\ninvestigate the influence of the nutrient sensing and longevity-assuring enzyme\nSIRT6 on the dynamics of apoptosis triggered by serum starvation. Specifically,\nwe characterize the progression of apoptosis in wild type and SIRT6 deficient\nmouse embryonic fibroblasts using time-lapse flow cytometry and computational\nmodelling based on rate-equations and cell distribution analysis. We find that\nSIRT6 deficient cells resist apoptosis by delaying its initiation.\nInterestingly, once apoptosis is initiated, the rate of its progression is\nhigher in SIRT6 null cells compared to identically cultured wild type cells.\nHowever, SIRT6 null cells succumb to apoptosis more slowly, not only in\nresponse to nutrient deprivation but also in response to other stresses. Our\ndata suggest that SIRT6 plays a role in several distinct steps of apoptosis.\nOverall, we demonstrate the utility of our computational model to describe\nstages of apoptosis progression and the integrity of the cellular membrane.\nSuch measurements will be useful in a broad range of biological applications.\nWe describe a computational method to evaluate the progression of apoptosis\nthrough different stages. Using this method, we describe how cells devoid of\nSIRT6 longevity gene respond to apoptosis stimuli, specifically, how they\nrespond to starvation. We find that SIRT6 cells resist apoptosis initiation;\nhowever, once initiated, they progress through the apoptosis at a faster rate.\nThese data are first of the kind and suggest that SIRT6 activities might play\ndifferent roles at different stages of apoptosis. The model that we propose can\nbe used to quantitatively evaluate progression of apoptosis and will be useful\nin studies of cancer treatments and other areas where apoptosis is involved.\n", "  We analyze spectropolarimetric sunspot umbra observations taken in the\nnear-infrared Si i 1082.7 nm line taking NLTE effects into account. The data\nwere obtained with the GRIS instrument installed at the German GREGOR\ntelescope. A point spread function (PSF) was constructed using prior Mercury\nobservations with GRIS and the information provided by the adaptive optics\nsystem of the GREGOR telescope. The data were then deconvolved from the PSF\nusing a principal component analysis deconvolution method and were analyzed via\nthe NICOLE inversion code. The Si i 1082.7 nm line seems to be in emission in\nthe umbra of the observed sunspot after the effects of scattered light are\nremoved. We show how the spectral line shape of umbral profiles changes\ndramatically with the amount of scattered light. Indeed, the continuum levels\nrange, on average, from 44% of the quiet Sun continuum intensity to about 20%.\nThe inferred levels are in line with current model predictions and empirical\numbral models. Current umbral empirical models are not able to reproduce the\nemission in the deconvolved umbral Stokes profiles. The results of the NLTE\ninversions suggests that to obtain the emission in the Si i 1082.7 nm line, the\ntemperature stratification should first have a hump located at about log tau -2\nand start rising at lower heights when moving into the transition region. This\nis, to our knowledge, the first time the Si i 1082.7 nm line is seen in\nemission in sunspot umbrae. The results show that the temperature\nstratification of current umbral models may be more complex than expected with\nthe transition region located at lower heights above sunspot umbrae. Our\nfinding might provide insights into understanding why the sunspot umbra\nemission in the millimeter spectral range is less than that predicted by\ncurrent empirical umbral models.\n", "  Particle scattering and vacuum instability in a constant inhomogeneous\nelectric field of particular peak configuration that consists of two\n(exponentially increasing and exponentially decreasing) independent parts are\nstudied. It presents a new kind of external field where exact solutions of the\nDirac and Klein-Gordon equations can be found. We obtain and analyze in- and\nout-solutions of the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations in this configuration. By\ntheir help we calculate probabilities of particle scattering and\ncharacteristics of the vacuum instability. In particular, we consider in\ndetails three configurations: a smooth peak, a sharp peak, and a strongly\nasymmetric peak configuration. We find asymptotic expressions for total mean\nnumbers of created particles and for vacuum-to-vacuum transition probability.\nWe discuss a new regularization of the Klein step by the sharp peak and compare\nthis regularization with another one given by the Sauter potential.\n", "  We investigate the coupling of spin and thermal currents as a means to rise\nthe thermoelectric efficiency of nanoscale graphene devices. We consider\nnanostructures composed of overlapping graphene nanoribbons with ferromagnetic\ncontacts in different magnetic configurations. Our results show that the charge\nSeebeck effect is greatly enhanced when the magnetic leads are in an\nantiparallel configuration, due to the enlargement of the transport gap.\nHowever, for the optimization of the charge figure of merit ZT it is better to\nchoose a parallel alignment of the magnetization in the leads, because the\nelectron-hole symmetry is broken in this magnetic configuration. We also obtain\nthe spin-dependent Seebeck coefficient and spin figure of merit. In fact, the\nspin ZT can double its value with respect to the charge ZT for a wide\ntemperature range, above 300 K. These findings suggest the potential value of\ngraphene nanosystems as energy harvesting devices employing spin currents.\n", "  We present short review of two methods for obtaining functional equations for\nFeynman integrals. Application of these methods for finding functional\nequations for one- and two- loop integrals is described in detail. It is shown\nthat with the aid of functional equations Feynman integrals in general\nkinematics can be expressed in terms of simpler integrals. Similarities between\nfunctional equations for Feynman integrals and addition theorem for Abel\nintegrals are shortly discussed.\n", "  We present a thorough tight-binding analysis of the band structure of a wide\nvariety of lattices belonging to the class of honeycomb and Kagome systems\nincluding several mixed forms combining both lattices. The band structure of\nthese systems are made of a combination of dispersive and flat bands. The\ndispersive bands possess Dirac cones (linear dispersion) at the six corners (K\npoints) of the Brillouin zone although in peculiar cases Dirac cones at the\ncenter of the zone $(\\Gamma$ point) appear. The flat bands can be of different\nnature. Most of them are tangent to the dispersive bands at the center of the\nzone but some, for symmetry reasons, do not hybridize with other states. The\nobjective of our work is to provide an analysis of a wide class of so-called\nligand-decorated honeycomb Kagome lattices that are observed in 2D\nmetal-organic framework (MOF) where the ligand occupy honeycomb sites and the\nmetallic atoms the Kagome sites. We show that the $p_x$-$p_y$ graphene model is\nrelevant in these systems and there exists four types of flat bands: Kagome\nflat (singly degenerate) bands, two kinds of ligand-centered flat bands (A$_2$\nlike and E like, respectively doubly and singly degenerate) and metal-centered\n(three fold degenerate) flat bands.\n", "  Network models of large-scale electricity systems feature only a limited\nspatial resolution, either due to lack of data or in order to reduce the\ncomplexity of the problem with respect to numerical calculations. In such\ncases, both the network topology, the load and the generation patterns below a\ngiven spatial scale are aggregated into representative nodes. This\ncoarse-graining affects power flows and thus the resulting transmission needs\nof the system. We derive analytical scaling laws for measures of network\ntransmission capacity and cost in coarse-grained renewable electricity\nnetworks. For the cost measure only a very weak scaling with the spatial\nresolution of the system is found. The analytical results are shown to describe\nthe scaling of the transmission infrastructure measures for a simplified, but\ndata-driven and spatially detailed model of the European electricity system\nwith a high share of fluctuating renewable generation.\n", "  Molecular hydrogen is a benchmark system for bound state quantum calculation\nand tests of quantum electrodynamical effects. While spectroscopic measurements\non the stable species have progressively improved over the years, high\nresolution studies on the radioactive isotopologues $\\rm{T_2}$, $\\rm{HT}$ and\n$\\rm{DT}$ have been limited. Here we present an accurate determination of\n$\\rm{T_2}$ $Q(J = 0 - 5)$ transition energies in the fundamental vibrational\nband of the ground electronic state, by means of high resolution Coherent\nAnti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy. With the present experimental uncertainty of\n$0.02\\,\\rm{cm^{-1}}$, which is a fivefold improvement over previous\nmeasurements, agreement with the latest theoretical calculations is\ndemonstrated.\n", "  In this document, we present the global QCD analysis of parton-to-kaon\nfragmentation functions at next-to-leading order accuracy using the latest\nexperimental information on single-inclusive kaon production in\nelectron-positron annihilation, lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering, and\nproton-proton collisions. An extended analysis of this work can be found in\nRef.[1].\n", "  The loop-tree duality (LTD) theorem establishes that loop contributions to\nscattering amplitudes can be computed through dual integrals, which are build\nfrom single cuts of the virtual diagrams. In order to build a complete LTD\nrepresentation of a cross section and to achieve a local cancellation of\nsingularities, it is crucial to include the renormalized self-energy\ncorrections in an unintegrated form. In this document, we calculate the scalar\nfunctions related to the self-energy corrections in QED and QCD in the LTD\nformalism and extract explicitly their UV behaviour.\n", "  Symplectic tomographies of classical and quantum states are shortly reviewed.\nThe concept of nonlinear f-oscillators and their properties are recalled. The\ntomographic probability representations of oscillator coherent states and the\nproblem of entanglement are then discussed. The entanglement of even and odd\nf-coherent states is evaluated by the linear entropy.\n", "  We present a perturbation approach rooted in time-dependent\ndensity-functional theory to calculate electron hole (eh)-pair excitation\nspectra during the non-adiabatic vibrational damping of adsorbates on metal\nsurfaces. Our analysis for the benchmark systems CO on Cu(100) and Pt(111)\nelucidates the surprisingly strong influence of rather short electronic\ncoherence times. We demonstrate how in the limit of short electronic coherence\ntimes, as implicitly assumed in prevalent quantum nuclear theories for the\nvibrational lifetimes as well as electronic friction, band structure effects\nare washed out. Our results suggest that more accurate lifetime or\nchemicurrent-like experimental measurements could characterize the electronic\ncoherence.\n", "  We observed broken-symmetry quantum Hall effects and level crossings between\nspin- and valley- resolved Landau levels (LLs) in Bernal stacked trilayer\ngraphene. When the magnetic field was tilted with respect to sample normal from\n$0^{\\circ}$ to $66^\\circ$, the LL crossings formed at intersections of zeroth\nand second LLs from monolayer-graphene-like and bilayer-graphene-like subbands,\nrespectively, exhibited a sequence of transitions. The results indicate the LLs\nfrom different subbands are coupled by in-plane magnetic fields\n($B_{\\parallel}$), which was explained by developing the tight-binding model\nHamiltonian of trilayer graphene under $B_{\\parallel}$.\n", "  Recently a peak structure was observed near the $K^{-} p p$ threshold in the\nin-flight ${}^{3} {\\rm He} (K^{-} , \\, \\Lambda p) n$ reaction of the E15\nexperiment at J-PARC, which could be a signal of a $\\bar{K} N N$ bound state.\nIn order to investigate what is the origin of this peak, we calculate the cross\nsection of this reaction, in particular based on the scenario that the $\\bar{K}\nN N$ bound state is indeed generated and decays into $\\Lambda p$. We find that\nthe numerical result of the $\\Lambda p$ invariant-mass spectrum in the $\\bar{K}\nN N$ bound scenario is consistent with the J-PARC E15 data.\n", "  The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) one-dimensional Hamiltonian includes a quartic\nterm which guarantees ergodicity of the system in the thermodynamic limit.\nConsistently, the Boltzmann factor $P(\\epsilon) \\sim e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}$\ndescribes its equilibrium distribution of one-body energies, and its velocity\ndistribution is Maxwellian, i.e., $P(v) \\sim e^{- \\beta v^2/2}$. We consider\nhere a generalized system where the quartic coupling constant between sites\ndecays as $1/d_{ij}^{\\alpha}$ $(\\alpha \\ge 0; d_{ij} = 1,2,\\dots)$. Through\n{\\it first-principle} molecular dynamics we demonstrate that, for large\n$\\alpha$ (above $\\alpha \\simeq 1$), i.e., short-range interactions, Boltzmann\nstatistics (based on the {\\it additive} entropic functional $S_B[P(z)]=-k \\int\ndz P(z) \\ln P(z)$) is verified. However, for small values of $\\alpha$ (below\n$\\alpha \\simeq 1$), i.e., long-range interactions, Boltzmann statistics\ndramatically fails and is replaced by q-statistics (based on the {\\it\nnonadditive} entropic functional $S_q[P(z)]=k (1-\\int dz [P(z)]^q)/(q-1)$, with\n$S_1 = S_B$). Indeed, the one-body energy distribution is q-exponential,\n$P(\\epsilon) \\sim e_{q_{\\epsilon}}^{-\\beta_{\\epsilon} \\epsilon} \\equiv\n[1+(q_{\\epsilon} - 1) \\beta_{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}]^{-1/(q_{\\epsilon}-1)}$ with\n$q_{\\epsilon} > 1$, and its velocity distribution is given by $P(v) \\sim\ne_{q_v}^{ - \\beta_v v^2/2}$ with $q_v > 1$. Moreover, within small error bars,\nwe verify $q_{\\epsilon} = q_v = q$, which decreases from an extrapolated value\nq $\\simeq$ 5/3 to q=1 when $\\alpha$ increases from zero to $\\alpha \\simeq 1$,\nand remains q = 1 thereafter.\n", "  We study collective phenomena of self-propagating particles using the\nnonlinear Kramers equation. A solitary wave state appears from an instability\nof the spatially uniform ordered state with nonzero average velocity. Two\nsolitary waves with different heights merge into a larger solitary wave. An\napproximate solution of the solitary wave is constructed using a\nself-consistent method. The phase transition to the solitary wave state is\neither first-order or second-order, depending on the control parameters.\n", "  Two numerical studies, one based on a canonical boundary-value problem and\nthe other based on a reflection-transmission problem, revealed that the\npropagation of high-phase-speed Dyakonov-Tamm (HPSDT) surface waves may be\nsupported by the planar interface of a chiral sculptured thin film and a\ndissipative isotropic dielectric material. Furthermore, many distinct HPSDT\nsurface waves may propagate in a specific direction, each with a phase speed\nexceeding the phase speed of plane waves that can propagate in the isotropic\npartnering material. Indeed, for the particular numerical example considered,\nthe phase speed of an HPSDT surface wave could exceed the phase speed in bulk\nisotropic dielectric material by a factor of as much as 10.\n", "  We describe a method for computing transport coefficients from the direct\nevaluation of large deviation function. This method is general, relying on only\nequilibrium fluctuations, and is statistically efficient, employing trajectory\nbased importance sampling. Equilibrium fluctuations of molecular currents are\ncharacterized by their large deviation functions, which is a scaled cumulant\ngenerating function analogous to the free energy. A diffusion Monte Carlo\nalgorithm is used to evaluate the large deviation functions, from which\narbitrary transport coefficients are derivable. We find significant statistical\nimprovement over traditional Green-Kubo based calculations. The systematic and\nstatistical errors of this method are analyzed in the context of specific\ntransport coefficient calculations, including the shear viscosity, interfacial\nfriction coefficient, and thermal conductivity.\n", "  We demonstrate the simultaneous propagation of slow- and fast-light optical\npulses in a four-wave mixing scheme using warm potassium vapor. We show that\nwhen the system is tuned such that the input probe pulses exhibit slow-light\ngroup velocities and the generated pulses propagate with negative group\nvelocities, the information velocity in the medium is nonetheless constrained\nto propagate at, or less than, c. These results demonstrate that the transfer\nand copying of information on optical pulses to those with negative group\nvelocities obeys information causality, in a manner that is reminiscent of a\nclassical version of the no-cloning theorem. Additionally, these results\nsupport the fundamental concept that points of non-analyticity on optical\npulses correspond to carriers of new information.\n", "  Axions and axion-like particles are a leading model for the dark matter in\nthe Universe; therefore, dark matter halos may be boson stars in the process of\ncollapsing. We examine a class of static boson stars with a non-minimal\ncoupling to gravity. We modify the gravitational density of the boson field to\nbe proportional to an arbitrary power of the modulus of the field, introducing\na non-standard coupling. We find a class of solutions very similar to Newtonian\npolytropic stars that we denote \"quantum polytropes.\" These quantum polytropes\nare supported by a non-local quantum pressure and follow an equation very\nsimilar to the Lane-Emden equation for classical polytropes. Furthermore, we\nderive a simple condition on the exponent of the non-linear gravitational\ncoupling, $\\alpha>8/3$, beyond which the equilibrium solutions are unstable.\n", "  We theoretically analyze and experimentally measure the extrinsic angular\nmomentum contribution of topologically structured darkness found within\nfractional vortex beams, and show that this structured darkness can be\nexplained by evanescent waves at phase discontinuities in the generating optic.\nWe also demonstrate the first direct measurement of the intrinsic orbital\nangular momentum of light with both intrinsic and extrinsic angular momentum,\nand explain why the total orbital angular momenta of fractional vortices do not\nmatch the winding number of their generating phases.\n", "  1T-TaS$_2$ is a layered transition metal dichalgeonide with a very rich phase\ndiagram. At T=180K it undergoes a metal to Mott insulator transition. Mott\ninsulators usually display anti-ferromagnetic ordering in the insulating phase\nbut 1T-TaS$_2$ was never shown to order magnetically. In this letter we show\nthat 1T-TaS$_2$ has a large paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic\nsusceptibility but it does not show any sign of magnetic ordering or freezing\ndown to 20mK, as probed by $\\mu$SR, possibly indicating a quantum spin liquid\nground state. Although 1T-TaS$_2$ exhibits a strong resistive behavior both in\nand out-of plane at low temperatures we find a linear term in the heat capacity\nsuggesting the existence of a Fermi-surface, which has an anomalously strong\nmagnetic field dependence.\n", "  We examine the effect of a wiggly cosmic string for both massless and massive\nparticle propagation along the string axis. We show that the wave equation that\ngoverns the propagation of a scalar field in the neighborhood of a wiggly\nstring is formally equivalent to the quantum wave equation describing the\nhydrogen atom in two dimensions. We further show that the wiggly string\nspacetime behaves as a gravitational waveguide in which the quantized wave\nmodes propagate with frequencies that depend on the mass, string energy\ndensity, and string tension. We propose an analogy with an optical fiber,\ndefining an effective refractive index likely to mimic the cosmic string effect\nin the laboratory.\n", "  The noncentrosymmetric superconductor TaOs has been characterized using x-ray\ndiffraction, resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements.\nMagnetization and specific heat measurements show a bulk superconducting\ntransition at 2.07 K. These measurements suggest that TaOs is a weakly coupled\ntype-II superconductor. The electronic specific heat in the superconducting\nstate can be explained by the single-gap BCS model, suggesting s-wave\nsuperconductivity in TaOs.\n", "  We study Born-Infeld gravity coupled to an anisotropic fluid in a static,\nspherically symmetric background. The free function characterizing the fluid is\nselected on the following grounds: i) recovery of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nsolution of GR at large distances, ii) fulfillment of classical energy\nconditions and iii) inclusion of models of nonlinear electrodynamics as\nparticular examples. Four branches of solutions are obtained, depending on the\nsigns of two parameters on the gravity and matter sectors. On each branch, we\ndiscuss in detail the modifications on the innermost region of the\ncorresponding solutions, which provides a plethora of configurations, including\nnonsingular black holes and naked objects, wormholes and de Sitter cores. The\nregular character of these configurations is discussed according to the\ncompleteness of geodesics and the behaviour of curvature scalars.\n", "  We study $T^2/Z_N$ orbifold models with magnetic fluxes. We propose a\nsystematic way to analyze the number of zero-modes and their wavefunctions by\nuse of modular transformation. Our results are consistent with the previous\nresults, and our approach is more direct and analytical than the previous ones.\nThe index theorem implies that the zero-mode number of the Dirac operator on\n$T^2$ is equal to the index $M$, which corresponds to the magnetic flux in a\ncertain unit. Our results show that the zero-mode number of the Dirac operator\non $T^2/Z_N$ is equal to $\\lfloor M/N \\rfloor +1$ except one case on the\n$T^2/Z_3$ orbifold.\n", "  We show that the velocity and thus the frequency of a signal pulse can be\nadjusted by the use of a control Airy pulse. In particular, we utilize a\nnonlinear Airy pulse which, via cross-phase modulation, creates an effective\npotential for the optical signal. Interestingly, during the interaction, the\nsignal dispersion is suppressed. Importantly, the whole process is controllable\nand by using Airy pulses with different truncations leads to predetermined\nvalues of the frequency shifting. Such a functionality might be useful in\nwavelength division multiplexing networks.\n", "  The intermittency of turbulent superfluid helium is explored systematically\nin a steady wake flow from 1.28 K up to T>2.18K using a local anemometer. This\ntemperature range spans relative densities of superfluid from 96% down to 0%,\nallowing to test numerical predictions of enhancement or depletion of\nintermittency at intermediate superfluid fractions. Using the so-called\nextended self-similarity method, scaling exponents of structure functions have\nbeen calculated. No evidence of temperature dependence is found on these\nscaling exponents in the upper part of the inertial cascade, where turbulence\nis well developed and fully resolved by the probe. This result supports the\npicture of a profound analogy between classical and quantum turbulence in their\ninertial range, including the violation of self-similarities associated with\ninertial-range intermittency.\n", "  The warm inflation scenario in view of the modified Chaplygin gas is studied.\nWe consider the inflationary expansion is driven by a standard scalar field\nwhose decay ratio $\\Gamma$ has a generic power law dependence with the scalar\nfield $\\phi$ and the temperature of the thermal bath $T$. By assuming an\nexponential power law dependence in the cosmic time for the scale factor\n$a(t)$, corresponding to the intermediate inflation model, we solve the\nbackground and perturbative dynamics considering that our model evolves\naccording to (i) weak dissipative regime and (ii) strong dissipative regime.\nSpecifically, we find explicit expressions for the dissipative coefficient,\nscalar potential, and the relevant inflationary observables as the scalar power\nspectrum, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio. The free\nparameters characterizing our model are constrained by considering the\nessential condition for warm inflation, the conditions for the model evolves\naccording to weak or strong dissipative regime, and the 2015 Planck results\nthrough the $n_s-r$ plane.\n", "  We consider a model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with a\npartially composite Goldstone Higgs. The model is based on a\nstrongly-interacting fermionic sector coupled to a fundamental scalar sector\nvia Yukawa interactions. The SU(4) x SU(4) global symmetry of these two sectors\nis broken to a single SU(4) via Yukawa interactions. Electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is dynamically induced by condensation due to the strong interactions\nin the new fermionic sector which further breaks the global symmetry SU(4) to\nSp(4). The Higgs boson arises as a partially composite state which is an exact\nGoldstone boson in the limit where SM interactions are turned off. Terms\nbreaking the SU(4) global symmetry explicitly generate a mass for the Goldstone\nHiggs. The model realizes in different limits both (partially) composite Higgs\nand (bosonic) Technicolor models, thereby providing a convenient unified\nframework for phenomenological studies of composite dynamics. It is also a\ndynamical extension of the recent elementary Goldstone-Higgs model.\n", "  Dyson demonstrated an equivalence between infinite-range Coulomb gas models\nand classical random matrix ensembles for study of eigenvalue statistics. We\nintroduce finite-range Coulomb gas (FRCG) models via a Brownian matrix process,\nand study them analytically and by Monte-Carlo simulations. These models yield\nnew universality classes, and provide a theoretical framework for study of\nbanded random matrices (BRM) and quantum kicked rotors (QKR). We demonstrate\nthat, for a BRM of bandwidth b and a QKR of chaos parameter {\\alpha}, the\nappropriate FRCG model has the effective range d = (b^2)/N = ({\\alpha}^2)/N,\nfor large N matrix dimensionality. As d increases, there is a transition from\nPoisson to classical random matrix statistics.\n", "  We show that, in discrete models of quantum gravity, emergent geometric space\ncan be viewed as the entanglement pattern in a mixed quantum state of the\n\"universe\", characterized by a universal topological network entanglement. As a\nconcrete example we analyze the recently proposed model in which geometry\nemerges due to the condensation of 4-cycles in random regular bipartite graphs,\ndriven by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Using this model we show\nthat the emergence of geometric order decreases the entanglement entropy of\nrandom configurations. The lowest geometric entanglement entropy is realized in\nfour dimensions.\n", "  The one-QRPA method is used to describe simultaneously both double decay beta\nmodes, giving special attention to the partial restoration of spin-isospin\nSU(4) symmetry. To implement this restoration and to fix the model parameters,\nwe resort to the energetics of Gamow-Teller resonances and to the minima of the\nsingle $\\beta^+$-decay strengths. This makes the theory predictive regarding\nthe $\\beta\\beta_{2\\nu}$-decay, producing the $2\\nu$ moments in $^{48}$Ca,\n$^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{128,130}$Te, and $^{150}$Nd,\nthat are of the same order of magnitude as the experimental ones; however, the\nagreement with $\\beta\\beta_{2\\nu}$ data is only modest. To include\ncontributions coming from induced nuclear weak currents, we extend the\n$\\beta\\beta_{0\\nu}$-decay formalism employed previously in C. Barbero et. al,\nNuc. Phys. A628, 170 (1998). The numerical results for the $\\beta\\beta_{0\\nu}$\nmoments in the above mentioned nuclei are similar to those obtained in other\ntheoretical studies although smaller on averag by $\\sim 40\\%$. We attribute\nthis difference basically to the one-QRPA-method, employed here for the first\ntime, instead of the currently used two-QRPA-method. The difference is\npartially due to the way of carrying out the restoration of the spin-isospin\nsymmetry. It is hard to say which is the best way to make the restoration,\nsince the $\\beta\\beta_{0\\nu}$ moments are not experimentally measurable. The\nnumerical uncertainties in the $\\beta\\beta$ moments, related with i) their\nstrong dependence on the residual interaction in the p-p channel when evaluated\nwithin the QRPA, and ii) lack of proper knowledge of single-particle energies,\nhave been quantified. It is concluded that the partial restoration of the SU\n(4) symmetry is crucial in the description of the $\\beta\\beta$-decays,\nregardless of the nuclear model used.\n", "  In this paper we provide an experimental illustration of Page and Wootters'\nquantum time mechanism that is able to describe two-time quantum correlation\nfunctions. This allows us to test a Leggett-Garg inequality, showing a\nviolation from the \"internal\" observer point of view. The \"external\" observer\nsees a time-independent global state. Indeed, the scheme is implemented using a\nnarrow-band single photon where the clock degree of freedom is encoded in the\nphoton's position. Hence, the internal observer that measures the position can\ntrack the flow of time, while the external observer sees a delocalized photon\nthat has no time evolution in the experiment time-scale.\n", "  Background: Elastic scattering is probably the main event in the interactions\nof nucleons with nuclei. Even if this process has been extensively studied in\nthe last years, a consistent description, i.e., starting from microscopic two-\nand many-body forces connected by the same symmetries and principles, is still\nunder development. Purpose: In a previous paper we derived a theoretical\noptical potential from NN chiral potentials at fourth order (N3LO). In the\npresent work we use NN chiral potentials at fifth order (N4LO), with the\npurpose to check the convergence and to assess the theoretical errors\nassociated with the truncation of the chiral expansion in the construction of\nan optical potential. Methods: The optical potential is derived as the\nfirst-order term within the spectator expansion of the nonrelativistic multiple\nscattering theory and adopting the impulse approximation and the optimum\nfactorization approximation. Results: The pp and np Wolfenstein amplitudes and\nthe cross section, analyzing power, and spin rotation of elastic proton\nscattering from 16O, 12C, and 40Ca nuclei are presented at an incident proton\nenergy of 200 MeV. The results obtained with different versions of chiral\npotentials at N4LO are compared. Conclusions: Our results indicate that\nconvergence has been reached at N4LO. The agreement with the experimental data\nis comparable with the agreement obtained in our previous work. We confirm that\nbuilding an optical potential within chiral perturbation theory is a promising\napproach for describing elastic proton-nucleus scattering.\n", "  Ultralight scalars have been predicted in a variety of scenarios, and\nadvocated as a possible component of dark matter. These fields can form compact\nregular structures known as boson stars, or---in the presence of\nhorizons---give rise to nontrivial time-dependent scalar hair and a stationary\ngeometry. Because these fields can be coherent over large spatial extents,\ntheir interaction with \"regular\" matter can lead to very peculiar effects, most\nnotably resonances. Here we study the motion of stars in a background\ndescribing black holes surrounded by non-axially symmetric scalar field\nprofiles. By analyzing the system in a weak-field approach, we find that the\npresence of a scalar field gives rise to secular effects akin to ones existing\nin planetary and accretion disks. Particularly, the existence of resonances\nbetween the orbiting stars and the scalar field may enable angular momentum\nexchange between them, providing mechanisms similar to planetary migration.\nAdditionally, these mechanisms may allow \\textit{floating orbits}, which are\nstable radiating orbits. We also show, in the full relativistic case, that\nthese effects also appear when there is a direct coupling between the scalar\nfield and the stellar matter, which can arise due to the presence of a scalar\ncore in the star or in alternative theories of gravity.\n", "  We propose a generalization of the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV)\nequation from ${\\mathbb R}^n$ to an arbitrary Riemannian manifold. Its form is\nobtained by extending the relation of the WDVV equation with ${\\cal N}{=}\\,4$\nsupersymmetric $n$-dimensional mechanics from flat to curved space. The\nresulting `curved WDVV equation' is written in terms of a third-rank Codazzi\ntensor. For every flat-space WDVV solution subject to a simple constraint we\nprovide a curved-space solution on any isotropic space, in terms of the\nrotationally invariant conformal factor of the metric.\n", "  We demonstrate that a Chern insulator could be realized on a real\ntwo-dimensional lattice of an organic Dirac semimetal {\\alpha}-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 by\nintroducing potential and magnetic modulations in a unit cell. It is a\ntopologically-nontrivial insulator which shows the quantum Hall effect even at\nzero magnetic field. We assumed a pattern of site potential and staggered\nplaquette magnetic flux on the lattice so as to imitate the observed stripe\ncharge ordering pattern. When the magnetic modulation is sufficiently large,\nthe system becomes a Chern insulator, where Berry curvatures around two gapped\nDirac cones have the same sign on each band, and one chiral edge state connects\nthe conduction and valence bands at each crystal edge. The present model is an\norganic version of Haldane's model, which discussed the Chern insulator on the\nhoneycomb lattice with second nearest neighbor couplings.\n", "  Spin accumulation generated by the anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in mesoscopic\nferromagnetic Ni81Fe19 (permalloy or Py) films is detected electrically by a\nnonlocal method. The reciprocal phenomenon, inverse spin Hall effects (ISHE),\ncan also be generated and detected all-electrically in the same structure. For\naccurate quantitative analysis, a series of nonlocal AHE/ISHE structures and\nsupplementary structures are fabricated on each sample substrate to account for\nstatistical variations and to accurately determine all essential physical\nparameters in-situ. By exploring Py thicknesses of 4 nm, 8 nm, and 12 nm, the\nPy spin diffusion length {\\lambda}_Py is found to be much shorter than the film\nthicknesses. The product of {\\lambda}_Py and the Py spin Hall angle {\\alpha}_SH\nis determined to be independent of thickness and resistivity:\n{\\alpha}_SH*{\\lambda}_Py= (0.066 +/- 0.009) nm at 5 K and (0.041 +/- 0.010) nm\nat 295 K. These values are comparable to those obtained from mesoscopic Pt\nfilms.\n", "  We investigate the effects of nanoparticles on the onset of varicose and\nwhipping instabilities in the dynamics of electrified jets. In particular, we\nshow that the non-linear interplay between the mass of the nanoparticles and\nelectrostatic instabilities, gives rise to qualitative changes of the dynamic\nmorphology of the jet, which in turn, drastically affect the final deposition\npattern in electrospinning experiments. It is also shown that even a tiny\namount of excess mass, of the order of a few percent, may more than double the\nradius of the electrospun fiber, with substantial implications for the design\nof experiments involving electrified jets as well as spun organic fibers.\n", "  The energy eigenstates of a spin$-\\frac{1}{2}$ particle in a magnetic field\nconfined to a plane, define a planar spin. If the particle moves adiabatically\naround a loop in this plane, it picks up a topological Berry phase that can\nonly be an integer multiple of $\\pi$. We propose a neutron interferometry test\nof the Berry phase for a circulating planar spin induced by a magnetic field\ncaused by a very long current-carrying straight wire perpendicular to the\nplane. This Berry phase causes destructive interference in the direction of the\nincoming beam of thermal neutrons moving through a triple-Laue interferometer.\n", "  We study the dynamics of dark solitons in an incoherently pumped\nexciton-polariton condensate by means of a system composed by a generalized\nopen-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the polaritons' wavefunction and\na rate equation for the exciton reservoir density. Considering a perturbative\nregime of sufficiently small reservoir excitations, we use the reductive\nperturbation method, to reduce the system to a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation\nwith linear loss. This model is used to describe the analytical form and the\ndynamics of dark solitons. We show that the polariton field supports decaying\ndark soliton solutions with a decay rate determined analytically in the weak\npumping regime. We also find that the dark soliton evolution is accompanied by\na shelf, whose dynamics follows qualitatively the effective KdV picture.\n", "  The lattice response of a prototype Mott insulator, SmTiO3, to hole doping is\ninvestigated with atomic-scale spatial resolution. SmTiO3 films are doped with\nSr on the Sm site with concentrations that span the insulating and metallic\nsides of the filling-controlled Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT). The\nGdFeO3-type distortions are investigated using an atomic resolution scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy technique that can resolve small lattice\ndistortions with picometer precision. We show that these distortions are\ngradually and uniformly reduced as the Sr concentration is increased without\nany phase separation. Significant distortions persist into the metallic state.\nThe results present a new picture of the physics of this prototype\nfilling-controlled MIT, which is discussed.\n", "  In this work we consider the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the electroweak\n$SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ gauge group into $U(1)_{em}$ taken place in the Standard\nModel of particle physics as seen from the point of view of an accelerating\nobserver. According to the Unruh effect that observer detects the Minkowski\nvacuum as a thermal bath at a temperature proportional to the proper\nacceleration $a$. Then we show that (in a certain large $N$ limit) when the\nacceleration is bigger than the critical value $a_c = 4 \\pi v$ (where $v$ is\nthe Higgs vacuum expectation value), the electroweak $SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$\ngauge symmetry is restored and all elementary particles become massless. In\naddition, even observers with $a<a_c$, can see this symmetry restoration in the\nregion close to the Rindler horizon.\n", "  The ease with which domain walls (DWs) in ferroelectric materials can be\nwritten and erased provides a versatile way to dynamically modulate heat\nfluxes. In this work we evaluate the thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of\n180$^{\\circ}$ DWs in prototype ferroelectric perovskite PbTiO$_3$ within the\nnumerical formalisms of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and nonequilibrium\nGreen's functions. An excellent agreement is obtained for the TBR of an\nisolated DW derived from both approaches, which reveals the harmonic character\nof the phonon-DW scattering mechanism. The thermal resistance of the\nferroelectric material is shown to increase up to around 20%, in the system\nsizes here considered, due to the presence of a single DW, and larger\nresistances can be attained by incorporation of more DWs along the path of\nthermal flux. These results, obtained at device operation temperatures, prove\nthe viability of an electrically actuated phononic switch based on\nferroelectric DWs.\n", "  The fundamental active photonic dimer consisting of two coupled quantum well\nlasers is investigated in the context of the rate equation model. Spectral\ntransition properties and exceptional points are shown to occur under general\nconditions, not restricted by PT-symmetry as in coupled mode models, suggesting\na paradigm shift in the field of non-Hermitian photonics. The optical spectral\nsignatures of system bifurcations and exceptional points are manifested in\nterms of self-termination effects and observable drastic variations of the\nspectral line shape that can be controlled in terms of optical detuning and\ninhomogeneous pumping.\n", "  An emergence of Local Parity Breaking (LPB) in central heavy-ion collisions\n(HIC) at high energies is discussed. LPB in the fireball can be produced by a\ndifference between the number densities of right- and left-handed chiral\nfermions (Chiral Imbalance) which is implemented by a chiral (axial) chemical\npotential. The effective meson lagrangian induced by QCD is extended to the\nmedium with Chiral Imbalance and the properties of light scalar and\npseudoscalar mesons ($\\pi, a_0$) are analyzed. It is shown that exotic decays\nof scalar mesons arise as a result of mixing of $ \\pi $ and $ a_0 $ vacuum\nstates in the presence of chiral imbalance. The pion electromagnetic formfactor\nobtains an unusual parity-odd supplement which generates a photon polarization\nasymmetry in pion polarizability. We hope that the above pointed indications of\nLPB can be identified in experiments on LHC, RHIC, CBM FAIR and NICA\naccelerators.\n", "  We study the isothermal Brownian dynamics of a particle in a system with\nspatially varying diffusivity. Due to the heterogeneity of the system, the\nparticle's mean displacement does not vanish even if it does not experience any\nphysical force. This phenomenon has been termed \"noise-induced drift\", and has\nbeen extensively studied for one-dimensional systems. Here, we examine the\nnoise-induced drift in a two-dimensional anisotropic system, characterized by a\nsymmetric diffusion tensor with unequal diagonal elements. A general expression\nfor the mean displacement vector is derived and presented as a sum of two\nvectors, depicting two distinct drifting effects. The first vector describes\nthe tendency of the particle to drift toward the high diffusvity side in each\northogonal principal diffusion direction. This is a generalization of the\nwell-known expression for the noise-induced drift in one-dimensional systems.\nThe second vector represents a novel drifting effect, not found in\none-dimensional system, originating from the spatial rotation in the directions\nof the principal axes. The validity of the derived expressions is verified by\nusing Langevin dynamics simulations. As a specific example, we consider the\nrelative diffusion of two transmembrane proteins, and demonstrate that the\naverage distance between them increases at a surprisingly fast rate of several\ntens of micrometers per second.\n", "  Photothermal effects of gold core-shell nanoparticles and nanorods dispersed\nin water are theoretically investigated using the transient bioheat equation\nand the extended Mie theory. Properly calculating the absorption cross section\nis an extremely crucial milestone to determine the elevation of solution\ntemperature. The nanostructures are assumed to be randomly and uniformly\ndistributed in the solution. Compared to previous experiments, our theoretical\ntemperature increase during laser light illumination provides, in various\nsystems, both reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement. This approach\ncan be a highly reliable tool to predict photothermal effects in experimentally\nunexplored structures. We also validate our approach and discuss its\nlimitations.\n", "  We extend the idea of unimodular gravity to the modified $f(R,T)$ theories. A\nnew class of cosmological solutions, that the unimodular constraint on the\nmetric imposes on the $f(R,T)$ theories, are studied. This extension is done in\nboth Jordan and Einstein frames. We show that while the Lagrange multiplier\n(that imposes the unimodular constraint on the action) depends on the cosmic\ntime in Jordan frame and therefore, can act as an evolving scalar field in the\nuniverse history, in the Einstein frame it acts as a cosmological constant.\nThen a general reconstruction method is used to realize an explicit form of the\nunimodular $f(R,T)$ corresponding to a given cosmological solution. By adopting\na specific form of $f(R,T)$, the issue of cosmological inflation is studied in\nthis setup. To see the observational viability of this model, a numerical\nanalysis on the model parameter space is done in the background of Planck2015\nobservational data.\n", "  The bulk-boundary correspondence establishes a connection between the bulk\ntopological index of an insulator or superconductor, and the number of\ntopologically protected edge bands or states. For topological superconductors\nin two dimensions the first Chern number is related to the number of protected\nbands within the bulk energy gap, and is therefore assumed to give the number\nof Majorana band states in the system. Here we show that this is not\nnecessarily the case. As an example we consider a hexagonal-lattice topological\nsuperconductor based on a model of graphene with Rashba spin orbit coupling,\nproximity induced s-wave superconductivity, and a Zeeman magnetic field. We\nexplore the full Chern number phase diagram of this model, extending what is\nalready known about its parity. We then demonstrate that despite the high Chern\nnumbers that can be seen in some phases these do not strictly always contain\nMajorana bound states.\n", "  We present mass-loss predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfer models\nfor helium (He) stars as a function of stellar mass, down to 2 Msun. Our study\nincludes both massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and low-mass He stars that have\nlost their envelope through interaction with a companion. For these low-mass\nHe-stars we predict mass-loss rates that are an order of magnitude smaller than\nby extrapolation of empirical WR mass-loss rates. Our lower mass-loss rates\nmake it harder for these elusive stripped stars to be discovered via line\nemission, and we should attempt to find them through alternative methods\ninstead. Moreover, lower mass-loss rates will make it less likely that low-mass\nHe stars provide stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) of type Ibc. We express our\nmass-loss predictions as a function of L and Z, and not as a function of the He\nabundance, as we do not consider this physically astute given our earlier work.\nThe exponent of the dM/dt vs. Z dependence is found to be 0.61, which is less\nsteep than relationships derived from recent empirical atmospheric modelling.\nOur shallower exponent will make it more challenging to produce \"heavy\" black\nholes of order 40 Msun, as recently discovered in the gravitational wave event\nGW 150914, making low metallicity for these types of events even more\nnecessary.\n", "  The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is emerging as a powerful engineering tool\nfor aeroacoustic computations. However, the LBM has been shown to present\naccuracy and stability issues in the medium-low Mach number range, that is of\ninterest for aeroacoustic applications. Several solutions have been proposed\nbut often are too computationally expensive, do not retain the simplicity and\nthe advantages typical of the LBM, or are not described well enough to be\nusable by the community due to proprietary software policies. We propose to use\nan original regularized collision operator, based on the expansion in Hermite\npolynomials, that greatly improves the accuracy and stability of the LBM\nwithout altering significantly its algorithm. The regularized LBM can be easily\ncoupled with both non-reflective boundary conditions and a multi-level grid\nstrategy, essential ingredients for aeroacoustic simulations. Excellent\nagreement was found between our approach and both experimental and numerical\ndata on two different benchmarks: the laminar, unsteady flow past a 2D cylinder\nand the 3D turbulent jet. Finally, most of the aeroacoustic computations with\nLBM have been done with commercial softwares, while here the entire theoretical\nframework is implemented on top of an open source library (Palabos).\n", "  The quantization of systems with a position dependent mass (PDM) is studied.\nWe present a method that starts with the study of the existence of Killing\nvector fields for the PDM geodesic motion (Lagrangian with a PDM kinetic term\nbut without any potential) and the construction of the associated Noether\nmomenta. Then the method considers, as the appropriate Hilbert space, the space\nof functions that are square integrable with respect to a measure related with\nthe PDM and, after that, it establishes the quantization, not of the canonical\nmomenta $p$, but of the Noether momenta $P$ instead. The quantum Hamiltonian,\nthat depends on the Noether momenta, is obtained as an Hermitian operator\ndefined on the PDM Hilbert space. In the second part several systems with\nposition-dependent mass, most of them related with nonlinear oscillators, are\nquantized by making use of the method proposed in the first part.\n", "  The dynamics following laser-induced molecular photodissociation of gas-phase\nCH$_{2}$BrI at 271.6 nm were investigated by time-resolved Coulomb explosion\nimaging using intense near-IR femtosecond laser pulses. The observed\ndelay-dependent photofragment momenta reveal that CH$_{2}$BrI undergoes C-I\ncleavage, depositing 65.6% of the available energy into internal product\nstates, and that absorption of a second UV photon breaks the C-Br bond of\nCH$_{2}$Br. Simulations confirm that this mechanism is consistent with previous\ndata recorded at 248 nm, demonstrating the sensitivity of Coulomb explosion\nimaging as a real-time probe of chemical dynamics.\n", "  We combine the theoretical method of calculating spin wave excitation with\nthe finite-temperature modeling and calculate the magnon-phonon relaxation time\nin the technologically important material Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) from first\nprinciples. The finite lifetime of magnon excitation is found to arise from the\nfluctuation of the exchange interaction of magnetic atoms in YIG. At room\ntemperature, the magnon spectra have significant broadening that is used to\nextract the magnon-phonon relaxation time quantitatively. The latter is a\nphenomenological parameter of great importance in YIG-based spintronics\nresearch. We find that the magnon-phonon relaxation time for the optical magnon\nis a constant while that for the acoustic magnon is proportional to $1/k^2$ in\nthe long-wavelength regime.\n", "  We analyze the collective behavior of hydrodynamically coupled molecular\nmotors. We show that the local fluxes induced by motors displacement can induce\nthe experimentally observed bidirectional motion of cargoes and vesicles. By\nmeans of a mean--field approach we show that sustained oscillations as well as\nbistable collective motor motion arise even for very large collection of\nmotors, when thermal noise is irrelevant. The analysis clarifies the physical\nmechanisms responsible for such dynamics by identifying the relevant coupling\nparameter and its dependence on the geometry of the hydrodynamic coupling as\nwell as on system size. We quantify the phase diagram for the different phases\nthat characterize the collective motion of hydrodynamically coupled motors and\nshow that sustained oscillations can be reached for biologically relevant\nparameters, hence demonstrating the relevance of hydrodynamic interactions in\nintracellular transport.\n", "  The first high harmonic spectrum, containing only the odd orders, was\nobserved in experiments 30 years ago (1987). However, a spectrum containing\npure even harmonics has never been observed. We investigate the generation of\npure even harmonics from oriented CO molecules in linearly polarized laser\nfields employing the time-dependent density-functional theory. We find that the\neven harmonics, with no odd orders, are generated with the polarization\nperpendicular to the laser polarization, when the molecular axis of CO is\nperpendicular to the laser polarization. Generation of pure even harmonics\nreveals a type of dipole acceleration originating from the permanent dipole\nmoment. This phenomenon exists in all system with permanent dipole moments,\nincluding bulk crystal and polyatomic molecules.\n", "  We demonstrate from both simulation and experiment a simple scheme for\nselective injection of multiple domain walls in a magnetic nanowire. The\nstructure consists of a side-contact misaligned Hall bar made of\nferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers. The combination of current-induced spin-orbit\ntorque and an external magnetic field allows for the formation of localized\ndomains with specific magnetization direction and length, thereby creating\ndomain walls in predetermined locations. With the side contacts at two sides\nmisaligned for a distance that is comparable to the contact width, it is\npossible to create densely packed domains by simply applying current between\ndifferent pairs of side contacts. Simulation results show that the proposed\nscheme is scalable to a large number of domains with its dimension limited only\nby the domain wall width.\n", "  Gravitational wave source localization problem is important in gravitational\nwave astronomy. Regarding ground-based detector, almost all of the previous\ninvestigations only considered the difference of arrival time among the\ndetector network for source localization. Within the matched filtering\nframework, the information beside the arrival time difference can possibly also\ndo some help on source localization. Especially when an eccentric binary is\nconsidered, the character involved in the gravitational waveform may improve\nthe source localization. We investigate this effect systematically in the\ncurrent paper. During the investigation, the enhanced post-circular (EPC)\nwaveform model is used to describe the eccentric binary coalesce. We find that\nthe source localization accuracy does increase along with the eccentricity\nincreases. But such improvement depends on the total mass of the binary. For\ntotal mass 100M${}_\\odot$ binary, the source localization accuracy may be\nimproved about 2 times in general when the eccentricity increases from 0 to\n0.4. For total mass 65M${}_\\odot$ binary (GW150914-like binary), the\nimprovement factor is about 1.3 when the eccentricity increases from 0 to 0.4.\nFor total mass 22M${}_\\odot$ binary (GW151226-like binary), such improvement is\nignorable.\n", "  We report the high resolution resonant inelastic EUV scattering study of\nquantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet KCoF3. By tuning the EUV photon energy to\ncobalt M23 edge, a complete set of low energy 3d spin-orbital excitations is\nrevealed. These low-lying electronic excitations are modeled using an extended\nmultiplet-based mean field calculation to identify the roles of lattice and\nmagnetic degrees of freedom in modifying the RIXS spectral lineshape. We have\ndemonstrated that the temperature dependence of RIXS features upon the\nantiferromagnetic ordering transition enables us to probe the energetics of\nshort-range spin correlations in this material.\n", "  The main purpose of the present paper is to investigate the nonlinear\nstability of viscous shock waves and rarefaction wave for bipolar\nVlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann (VPB) system. To this end, motivated by the\nmicro-macro decomposition to the Boltzmann equation in [21, 23], we first set\nup a new micro-macro decomposition around the local Maxwellian related to the\nbipolar VPB system and give a unified framework to study the nonlinear\nstability of the basic wave patterns to the system. Then, as the applications\nof this new decomposition, the time-asymptotic stability of the two typical\nnonlinear wave patterns, viscous shock waves and rarefaction wave, are proved\nfor the 1D bipolar Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system. More precisely, it is first\nproved that the linear superposition of two Boltzmann shock profiles in the\nfirst and third characteristic fields is nonlinearly stable to the 1D bipolar\nVPB system up to some suitable shifts without the zero macroscopic mass\nconditions on the initial perturbations. Then the time-asymptotic stability of\nrarefaction wave fan to compressible Euler equations is proved to 1D bipolar\nVPB system. These two results are concerned with the nonlinear stability of\nwave patterns for Boltzmann equation coupled with additional (electric) forces,\nwhich together with spectral analysis made in [18] sheds light on understanding\nthe complicated dynamic behaviors around the wave patterns in the\ntransportation of charged particles under the binary collisions, mutual\ninteractions, and the effect of the electrostatic potential forces.\n", "  We study the rheology of a suspension of soft deformable droplets subjected\nto a pressure-driven flow. Through computer simulations, we measure the\napparent viscosity as a function of droplet concentration and pressure\ngradient, and provide evidence of a discontinuous shear thinning behaviour,\nwhich occurs at a concentration-dependent value of the forcing. We further show\nthat this response is associated with a nonequilibrium transition between a\n`hard' (or less deformable) phase, which is nearly jammed and flows very\nslowly, and a `soft' (or more deformable) phase, which flows much more easily.\nThe soft phase is characterised by flow-induced time dependent shape\ndeformations and internal currents, which are virtually absent in the hard\nphase. Close to the transition, we find sustained oscillations in both the\ndroplet and fluid velocities. Polydisperse systems show similar phenomenology\nbut with a smoother transition, and less regular oscillations.\n", "  We analyze a possibility of macroscopic quantum effects in the form of\ncoupled structural oscillations and shuttle motion of bright two-component\nspin-orbit-coupled striped (one-dimensional, 1D) and semi-vortex\n(two-dimensional, 2D) matter-wave solitons, under the action of linear mixing\n(Rabi coupling) between the components. In 1D, the intrinsic oscillations\nmanifest themselves as flippings between spatially even and odd components of\nstriped solitons, while in 2D the system features periodic transitions between\nzero-vorticity and vortical components of semi-vortex solitons. The\nconsideration is performed by means of a combination of analytical and\nnumerical methods.\n", "  Ultrafast lasers have revolutionized material processing, opening a wealth of\nnew applications in many areas of science. A recent technology that allows the\ncleaving of transparent materials via non-ablative processes is based on\nfocusing and translating a high-intensity laser beam within a material to\ninduce a well-defined internal stress plane. This then enables material\nseparation without debris generation. Here, we use a non-diffracting beam\nengineered to have a transverse elliptical spatial profile to generate high\naspect ratio elliptical channels in glass of dimension 350 nm x 710 nm, and\nsubsequent cleaved surface uniformity at the sub-micron level.\n", "  van der Waals interactions govern the physics of a plethora of molecular\nstructures. It is well known that the leading term in the distance-based London\nexpansion of the van der Waals energy for atomic and molecular dimers decays as\n$1/R^6$, where $R$ is the dimer distance. Using perturbation theory, we find\nthe leading term in the distance-based expansion of the intracule pair density\nat the interatomic distance. Our results unveil a universal $1/R^3$ decay,\nwhich is less prone to numerical errors than the $1/R^6$ dependency, and it is\nconfirmed numerically in H$_2$ and He$_2$ molecules. This \\textit{signature} of\nvan der Waals interactions can be directly used in the construction of\napproximate pair density and energy functionals including vdW corrections.\n", "  We derive the matching conditions between FLRW and generalised Vaidya\nspacetimes with spherical, planar or hyperbolic symmetry, across timelike\nhypersurfaces. We then construct new models of gravitational collapse of FLRW\nspacetimes with a negative cosmological constant having electromagnetic\nradiation in the exterior. The final state of the collapse are asymptotically\nAdS black holes with spherical, toroidal or higher genus topologies. We analyse\nthe collapse dynamics including trapped surface formation, for various\nexamples.\n", "  We study electromagnetic transition rates in the framework of the algebraic\ncluster model. The concept of shape-phase transitions is used to propose a\nmechanism that allows to have interband and intraband quadrupole transitions of\ncomparable strength, as observed in 12C.\n", "  Liquid impact problems for hemispherical fluid domain are considered. By\nusing the concept of pressure impulse we show that the solution of the flow\ninduced by the impact is reduced to the derivation of Laplace's equation in\nspherical coordinates with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The\nstructure of the flow at the impact moment is deduced from the spherical\nharmonics representation of the solution. In particular we show that the slip\nvelocity has a logarithmic singularity at the contact line. The theoretical\npredictions are in very good agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively\nwith the first time step of a numerical simulation with a Navier-Stokes solver\nnamed Gerris.\n", "  The spreading of a cap-shaped spherical droplet of non-Newtonian power-law\nliquids on a flat and a spherical rough and textured substrate is theoretically\nstudied in the capillary-controlled spreading regime. A droplet whose scale is\nmuch larger than that of the roughness of substrate is considered. The\nequilibrium contact angle on a rough substrate is modeled by the Wenzel and the\nCassie-Baxter model. Only the viscous energy dissipation within the droplet\nvolume is considered, and that within the texture of substrate by imbibition is\nneglected. Then, the energy balance approach is adopted to derive the evolution\nequation of the contact angle. When the equilibrium contact angle vanishes, the\nrelaxation of dynamic contact angle $\\theta$ of a droplet obeys a power law\ndecay $\\theta \\sim t^{-\\alpha}$ except for the Newtonian and the non-Newtonian\nshear-thinning liquid of the Wenzel model on a spherical substrate. The\nspreading exponent $\\alpha$ of the non-Newtonian shear-thickening liquid of the\nWenzel model on a spherical substrate is larger than others. The relaxation of\nthe Newtonian liquid of the Wenzel model on a spherical substrate is even\nfaster showing the exponential relaxation. The relaxation of the non-Newtonian\nshear-thinning liquid of Wenzel model on a spherical substrate is fastest and\nfinishes within a finite time. Thus, the topography (roughness) and the\ntopology (flat to spherical) of substrate accelerate the spreading of droplet.\n", "  Injecting magnetized plasma with changes in magnetization or injection rate\nnecessitate a time variable magnetic field at the boundary of the simulation\nbox. Naive implementation will lead to electromagnetic precursor waves that can\naffect the simulation results. The problem is well-known and is described e.g.\nin Lemebege and Dawson 1987. Since then few papers have attempted to deal with\nthis problem and no standard solution exists.\n  In this research note we suggest that the ad-hoc pulse shape that was used in\nthe paper by Lemebege and Dawson 1987 can be replaces by a standard digital low\npass filter. The cut off frequency of this filter should coincide with the gyro\nfrequency in the magnetized plasma, to make use of (Doppler-broadend) resonant\nabsorption caused by gyrating electrons. We illustrate this idea with a code\nexample and demonstrate the efficency of this method throug sample simulations\nwith our electromagnetic particle-in-cell code.\n", "  Detection of ultra-high energy (UHE, $\\gtrsim 1$ PeV) neutrinos from\nastrophysical sources will be a major advancement in identifying and\nunderstanding the sources of UHE cosmic rays (CRs) in nature. Long duration\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) blast waves have been considered as potential\nacceleration sites of UHECRs. These CRs are expected to interact with GRB\nafterglow photons, which is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons\nco-accelerated with CRs in the blast wave, and naturally produce UHE neutrinos.\nFluxes of these neutrinos are uncertain, however, and crucially depend on the\nobserved afterglow modeling. We have selected a sample of 23 long duration GRBs\nwithin redshift 0.5 for which adequate electromagnetic afterglow data are\navailable and which could produce high flux of UHE afterglow neutrinos, being\nnearby. We fit optical, X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray afterglow data with an adiabatic\nblast wave model in a constant density interstellar medium and in a wind\nenvironment where the density of the wind decreases as inverse square of the\nradius from the center of the GRB. The blast wave model parameters extracted\nfrom these fits are then used for calculating UHECR acceleration and $p\\gamma$\ninteractions to produce UHE neutrino fluxes from these GRBs. We have also\nexplored the detectability of these neutrinos by currently running and upcoming\nlarge area neutrino detectors, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube\nGen-2 and KM3NeT observatories. We find that our realistic flux models from\nnearby GRBs will be unconstrained in foreseeable future.\n", "  An exact approach to compute physical properties for general\nmulti-electronic-state (MES) systems in thermal equilibrium is presented. The\napproach is extended from our recent progress on path integral molecular\ndynamics (PIMD) [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 024103 (2016); 147, 034109 (2017)] for\nquantum statistical mechanics when a single potential energy surface is\ninvolved. We first define an effective potential function that is numerically\nfavorable for MES-PIMD, and then derive corresponding estimators in MES-PIMD\nfor evaluating various physical properties. Its application to several\nrepresentative one-dimensional and multi-dimensional models demonstrates that\nMES-PIMD in principle offers a practical tool in either of the diabatic and\nadiabatic representations for studying exact quantum statistics of\ncomplex/large MES systems when the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, Condon\napproximation, and harmonic bath approximation are broken.\n", "  While numerous optical methods exist to probe the dynamics of biological or\ncomplex fluid samples, in recent years digital Fourier microscopy techniques,\nlike differential dynamic microscopy, have emerged as ways to efficiently\ncombine elements of imaging and scattering methods. Here, we demonstrate,\nthrough experiments and simulations, how point-spread function engineering can\nbe used to extend the reach of differential dynamic microscopy.\n", "  Understanding the domain wall dynamics is an important issue in modern\nmagnetism. Here we present results of domain wall displacement in curved\ncylindrical nanowires at a constant magnetic field. We show that the average\nvelocity of a transverse domain wall increases with curvature. Contrary to what\nit is observed in stripes, in a curved wire the transverse domain wall\noscillates along and rotates around the nanowire with the same frequency. These\nresults open the possibility of new oscillation-based applications.\n", "  This paper reports the results of a study into highly efficient sum frequency\ngeneration from 792 and 1556 nm wavelength light to 525 nm wavelength light\nusing either a single or double resonant ring cavity based on a periodically\npoled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal (PPKTP). By optimizing the cavity$'$s\nparameters, the maximum power achieved for the resultant 525 nm laser was 263\nand 373 mW for the single and double resonant cavity, respectively. The\ncorresponding quantum conversion efficiencies were 8 and 77\\% for converting\n1556 nm photons to 525 nm photons with the single and double resonant cavity,\nrespectively. The measured intra-cavity single pass conversion efficiency for\nboth configurations was about 5\\%. The performances of the sum frequency\ngeneration in these two configurations were studied and compared in detail.\nThis work will provide guidelines for optimizing the generation of sum\nfrequency generated laser light for a variety of configurations. The high\nconversion efficiency achieved in this work will help pave the way for\nfrequency up-conversion of non-classical quantum states, such as the squeezed\nvacuum and single photon states. The proposed green laser source will be used\nin our future experiments, which includes a plan to generate two-colour\nentangled photon pairs and achieve the frequency down-conversion of single\nphotons carrying orbital angular momentum.\n", "  Thin films of inorganic materials as Tin-doped indium oxide, titanium oxide,\nNiobium doped titanium oxide, were deposited for comparison on glass and\nPolyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates with a DC sputtering method. These\nthin films have been characterized by different techniques: Dektak Surface\nProfilometer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, (UV/Vis/NIR) spectrophotometer and\nspectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The optical parameters of these films such as\ntransmittance, reflectance, refractive index, extinction coefficient, energy\ngap obtained with different electronic transitions, real and imaginary\n({\\epsilon}_r,{\\epsilon}_i) dielectric constants, were determined in the\nwavelengths range of (200 - 2200) nm. The results were compared with SE\nmeasurements in the ranges of (0.56- 6.19) eV by a new amorphous model with\nsteps of 1 nm. SE measurements of optical constant have been examined and\nconfirm the accuracy of the (UV/Vis/NIR) results. The optical properties\nindicate an excellent transmittance in the visible range of (400 - 800) nm. The\naverage transmittance of films on glass is about (86%, 91%, 85%) for (ITO,\nTiO2, TiO2:Nb (NTO)) respectively and decreases to about (85%, 81%, 82%) for\nPET substrates. For all these materials the optical band gap for direct\ntransition was (3.53, 3.3, 3.6) eV on glass substrates and on PET substrates\nusing two methods (UV and SE). A comparison between optical constants and\nthickness of these ultrathin films observed gives an excellent agreement with\nthe UV results. The deposited films were also analyzed by XRD and showed an\namorphous structure. The structural morphology of these thin films has been\ninvestigated and compared.\n", "  We report a detailed molecular spectroscopy study on the lowest excited\nelectronic states of $^{23}\\rm{Na}^{87}\\rm{Rb}$ for producing ultracold\n$^{23}\\rm{Na}^{87}\\rm{Rb}$ molecules in the electronic, rovibrational and\nhyperfine ground state. Starting from weakly-bound Feshbach molecules, a series\nof vibrational levels of the $A^{1}\\Sigma^{+}-b^{3}\\Pi$ coupled excited states\nwere investigated. After resolving, modeling and interpreting the hyperfine\nstructure of several lines, we successfully identified a long-lived level\nresulting from the accidental hyperfine coupling between the $0^+$ and $0^-$\ncomponents of the $b^3\\Pi$ state, satisfying all the requirements for the\npopulation transfer toward the lowest rovibrational level of the X$^1\\Sigma^+$\nstate. Using two-photon spectroscopy, its binding energy was measured to be\n4977.308(3) cm$^{-1}$, the most precise value to date. We calibrated all the\ntransition strengths carefully and also demonstrated Raman transfer of Feshbach\nmolecules to the absolute ground state.\n", "  Cation disorder is an important design criterion for technologically relevant\ntransition-metal (TM) oxides, such as radiation-tolerant ceramics and Li-ion\nbattery electrodes. In this letter, we use a combination of first-principles\ncalculations, normal mode analysis, and band-structure arguments to pinpoint a\nspecific electronic-structure effect that influences the stability of\ndisordered phases. We find that the electronic configuration of a TM ion\ndetermines to which extent the structural energy is affected by site\ndistortions. This mechanism explains the stability of disordered phases with\nlarge ionic radius differences and provides a concrete guideline for the\ndiscovery of novel disordered compositions.\n", "  The static second hyperpolarizability is derived from the space-fractional\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation in the particle-centric view. The Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn\nsum rule matrix elements and the three-level ansatz determines the maximum\nsecond hyperpolarizability for a space-fractional quantum system. The total\noscillator strength is shown to decrease as the space-fractional parameter\n$\\alpha$ decreases, which reduces the optical response of a quantum system in\nthe presence of an external field. This damped response is caused by the\nwavefunction dependent position and momentum commutation relation. Although the\nmaximum response is damped, we show that the one-dimensional quantum harmonic\noscillator is no longer a linear system for $\\alpha \\neq 1$, where the second\nhyperpolarizability becomes negative before ultimately damping to zero at the\nlower fractional limit of $\\alpha \\rightarrow 1/2$.\n", "  We study operation of a new device, the superconducting differential double\ncontour interferometer (DDCI), in application for the ultra sensitive detection\nof magnetic flux and for digital read out of the state of the superconducting\nflux qubit. DDCI consists of two superconducting contours weakly coupled by\nJosephson Junctions. In such a device a change of the critical current and the\nvoltage happens in a step-like manner when the angular momentum quantum number\nchanges in one of the two contours. The DDCI may outperform traditional\nSuperconducting Quantum Interference Devices when the change of the quantum\nnumber occurs in a narrow magnetic field region near the half of the flux\nquantum due to thermal fluctuations, quantum fluctuations, or the switching a\nloop segment in the normal state for a while by short pulse of an external\ncurrent.\n", "  The Brown-York quasilocal energy is applied to three cosmological problems\nwhich have previously been studied with the Hawking-Hayward quasilocal energy\n(Newtonian simulations of large scale structure formation, turnaround radius in\nthe present accelerating universe, and lensing by the cosmological constant).\nIt is found that, in an appropriate gauge and to first order in the amplitude\nof the cosmological perturbations describing local structures, the\nHawking-Hayward and the Brown-York quasilocal masses predict the same results.\n", "  To search for ultra-high-energy photons in primary cosmic rays, air shower\nobservables are needed that allow a good separation between primary photons and\nprimary hadrons. We present a new observable, $F_\\gamma$, which can be\nextracted from ground-array data in hybrid events, where simultaneous\nmeasurements of the longitudinal and the lateral shower profile are performed.\nThe observable is based on a template fit to the lateral distribution measured\nby the ground array with the template taking into account the complementary\ninformation from the measurement of the longitudinal profile, i.e. the primary\nenergy and the geometry of the shower. $F_\\gamma$ shows a very good\nphoton-hadron separation, which is even superior to the separation given by the\nwell-known $X_\\text{max}$ observable (the atmospheric depth of the shower\nmaximum). At energies around $1\\,\\text{EeV}$ ($10\\,\\text{EeV}$), $F_\\gamma$\nprovides a background rejection better than $97.8\\,\\%$ ($99.9\\,\\%$) at a signal\nefficiency of $50\\,\\%$. Advantages of the observable $F_\\gamma$ are its\ntechnical stability with respect to irregularities in the ground array (i.e.\nmissing or temporarily non-operating stations) and that it can be applied over\nthe full energy range accessible to the air shower detector, down to its\nthreshold energy. Furthermore, $F_\\gamma$ complements nicely to $X_\\text{max}$\nsuch that both observables can well be combined to achieve an even better\ndiscrimination power, exploiting the rich information available in hybrid\nevents.\n", "  Hydrogen (H)-doped LaFeAsO is a prototypical iron-based superconductor.\nHowever, its phase diagram extends beyond the standard framework, where a\nsuperconducting (SC) phase follows an antiferromagnetic (AF) phase upon carrier\ndoping; instead, the SC phase is sandwiched between two AF phases appearing in\nlightly and heavily H-doped regimes. We performed nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) measurements under pressure, focusing on the second AF phase in the\nheavily H-doped regime. The second AF phase is strongly suppressed when a\npressure of 3.0 GPa is applied, and apparently shifts to a highly H-doped\nregime, thereby a \"bare\" quantum critical point (QCP) emerges. A quantum\ncritical regime emerges in a paramagnetic state near the QCP, however, the\ninfluence of the AF critical fluctuations to the SC phase is limited in the\nnarrow doping regime near the QCP. The optimal SC condition ($T_c \\sim$ 48 K)\nis unaffected by AF fluctuations.\n", "  We consider a microswimmer that moves in two dimensions at a constant speed\nand changes the direction of its motion due to a torque consisting of a\nconstant and a fluctuating component. The latter will be modeled by a symmetric\nL\\'evy-stable ($\\alpha$-stable) noise. The purpose is to develop a kinetic\napproach to eliminate the angular component of the dynamics in order to find a\ncoarse grained description in the coordinate space. By defining the joint\nprobability density function of the position and of the orientation of the\nparticle through the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive transport equations for\nthe position-dependent marginal density, the particle's mean velocity and the\nvelocity's variance. At time scales larger than the relaxation time of the\ntorque $\\tau_{\\phi}$ the two higher moments follow the marginal density, and\ncan be adiabatically eliminated. As a result, a closed equation for the\nmarginal density follows. This equation which gives a coarse-grained\ndescription of the microswimmer's positions at time scales $t\\gg \\tau_{\\phi}$,\nis a diffusion equation with a constant diffusion coefficient depending on the\nproperties of the noise. Hence, the long time dynamics of a microswimmer can be\ndescribed as a normal, diffusive, Brownian motion with Gaussian increments.\n", "  Although the Gaia catalogue on its own will be a very powerful tool, it is\nthe combination of this highly accurate archive with other archives that will\ntruly open up amazing possibilities for astronomical research. The advanced\ninteroperation of archives is based on cross-matching, leaving the user with\nthe feeling of working with one single data archive. The data retrieval should\nwork not only across data archives, but also across wavelength domains. The\nfirst step for seamless data access is the computation of the cross-match\nbetween Gaia and external surveys. The matching of astronomical catalogues is a\ncomplex and challenging problem both scientifically and technologically\n(especially when matching large surveys like Gaia). We describe the cross-match\nalgorithm used to pre-compute the match of Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) with a\nselected list of large publicly available optical and IR surveys. The overall\nprinciples of the adopted cross-match algorithm are outlined. Details are given\non the developed algorithm, including the methods used to account for position\nerrors, proper motions, and environment; to define the neighbours; and to\ndefine the figure of merit used to select the most probable counterpart.\nStatistics on the results are also given. The results of the cross-match are\npart of the official Gaia DR1 catalogue.\n", "  The so called Inomata-McKinley spinors are a particular solution of the\nnon-linear Heisenberg equation. In fact, free linear massive (or mass-less)\nDirac fields are well known to be represented as a combination of\nInomata-McKinley spinors. More recently, a subclass of Inomata-McKinley spinors\nwere used to describe neutrino physics. In this paper we show that Dirac\nspinors undergoing this restricted Inomata-McKinley decomposition are\nnecessarily of the first type, according to the Lounesto classification.\nMoreover, we also show that this type one subclass spinors has not an exotic\ncounterpart. Finally, implications of these results are discussed, regarding\nthe understanding of the spacetime background topology.\n", "  The magnetic phases of a triangular-lattice antiferromagnet, CuCrO$_2$, were\ninvestigated in magnetic fields along to the $c$ axis, $H$ // [001], up to 120\nT. Faraday rotation and magneto-absorption spectroscopy were used to unveil the\nrich physics of magnetic phases. An up-up-down (UUD) magnetic structure phase\nwas observed around 90--105 T at temperatures around 10 K. Additional distinct\nanomalies adjacent to the UUD phase were uncovered and the Y-shaped and the\nV-shaped phases are proposed to be viable candidates. These ordered phases are\nemerged as a result of the interplay of geometrical spin frustration, single\nion anisotropy and thermal fluctuations in an environment of extremely high\nmagnetic fields.\n", "  A high order morphing continuum theory (MCT) is introduced to model highly\ncompressible turbulence. The theory is formulated under the rigorous framework\nof rational continuum mechanics. A set of linear constitutive equations and\nbalance laws are deduced and presented from the Coleman-Noll procedure and\nOnsager's reciprocal relations. The governing equations are then arranged in\nconservation form and solved through the finite volume method with a second\norder Lax-Friedrichs scheme for shock preservation. A numerical example of\ntransonic flow over a three-dimensional bump is presented using MCT and the\nfinite volume method. The comparison shows that MCT-based DNS provides a better\nprediction than NS-based DNS with less than 10% of the mesh number when\ncompared with experiments. A MCT-based and frame-indifferent Q-criterion is\nalso derived to show the coherent eddy structure of the downstream turbulence\nin the numerical example. It should be emphasized that unlike the NS-based\nG-criterion, the MCT-based Q-criterion is objective without the limitation of\nGalilean-invariance.\n", "  We consider a dissipative evolution of parametrically-driven qubits-cavity\nsystem under the periodical modulation of coupling energy between two\nsubsystems, which leads to the amplification of counterrotating processes. We\nreveal a very rich dynamical behavior of this hybrid system. In particular, we\nfind that the energy dissipation in one of the subsystems can enhance quantum\neffects in another subsystem. For instance, optimal cavity decay assists to\nstabilize entanglement and quantum correlations between qubits even in the\nsteady state and to compensate finite qubit relaxation. On the contrary, energy\ndissipation in qubit subsystem results in the enhanced photon production from\nvacuum for strong modulation, but destroys both quantum concurrence and quantum\nmutual information between qubits. Our results provide deeper insights to\nnonstationary cavity quantum electrodynamics in context of quantum information\nprocessing and might be of importance for dissipative quantum state\nengineering.\n", "  We present a numerical study of detonation propagation in unconfined\nexplosive charges shaped as an annular arc (rib). Steady detonation in a\nstraight charge propagates at constant speed but when it enters an annular\nsection, it goes through a transition phase and eventually reaches a new steady\nstate of constant angular velocity. This study examines the speed of the\ndetonation wave along the annular charge during the transition phase and at\nsteady state, as well as its dependence on the dimensions of the annulus. The\nsystem is modeled using a recently proposed diffuse-interface formulation which\nallows for the representation of a two-phase explosive and of an additional\ninert material. The explosive considered is the polymer-bonded TATB-based LX-17\nand is modeled using two JWL equations of state and the Ignition and Growth\nreaction rate law. Results show that steady state speeds are in good agreement\nwith experiment. In the transition phase, the evolution of outer detonation\nspeed deviates from the exponential bounded growth function suggested by\nprevious studies. We propose a new description of the transition phase which\nconsists of two regimes. The first is caused by local effects at the outer edge\nof the annulus and leads to a dependence of outer detonation speed on angular\nposition along the arc. The second regime is induced by effects originating\nfrom the inner edge of the annular charge and leads to the deceleration of the\nouter detonation until steady state is reached. The study concludes with a\nparametric study where the dependence of the steady state and the transition\nphase on the dimensions of the annulus is investigated.\n", "  It is understood from the recent experimental studies that prompt/resonant\nbreakup, and transfer followed by breakup in the weakly bound\n$^{6,7}$Li-induced reactions play a significant role in the complete-incomplete\nfusion (CF-ICF), suppression/enhancement in the fusion cross section around the\nCoulomb barrier. Investigation of ICF over CF was done by measuring cross\nsections of the populated residues in the $^{7}$Li-induced reaction on\n$^{\\text{nat}}$Nb target within 3--6.5 MeV/nucleon energy region. Measured\nexcitation functions of different channels were compared with different\nequilibrium (EQ) and preequilibrium (PEQ) models. The enhancement in cross\nsections in the proton ($\\sim$ 20--30 MeV) and $\\alpha$-emitting channels,\nwhich may be ascribed to ICF, was observed in the measured energy range when\ncompared to the Hauser-Feshbach and exciton model calculations using EMPIRE,\nwhich satisfactorily reproduces the neutron channels, compared to the\nWeisskopf-Ewing model and Hybrid Monte Carlo calculations. The increment of the\nincomplete fusion fraction was observed with rising projectile energy.\n", "  We propose two new versions of ghost-free generalized $F(R)$ gravity with\nLagrange multiplier constraint. The first version of such theory for a\nparticular degenerate choice of the Lagrange multiplier, corresponds to mimetic\n$F(R)$ gravity. The second version of such theory is just the Jordan frame\ndescription of mimetic gravity with potential. As we demonstrate, it is\npossible to realize several cosmological scenarios in such theory. In\nparticulary, de Sitter solutions may also be found.\n", "  The question of the number of thermodynamic states present in the\nlow-temperature phase of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Ising spin\nglass is addressed by studying spin and link overlap distributions using\npopulation annealing Monte Carlo simulations. We consider overlaps between\nsystems with the same boundary condition-which are the usual quantities\nmeasured-and also overlaps between systems with different boundary conditions,\nboth for the full systems and also within a smaller window within the system.\nOur results appear to be fully compatible with a single pair of pure states\nsuch as in the droplet/scaling picture. However, our results for whether or not\ndomain walls induced by changing boundary conditions are space filling or not\nare also compatible with scenarios having many thermodynamic states, such as\nthe chaotic pairs picture and the replica symmetry breaking picture. The\ndiffering results for spin overlaps in same and different boundary conditions\nsuggest that finite-size effects are very large for the system sizes currently\naccessible in low-temperature simulations.\n", "  We investigate the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in doped\nsemiconductors. The HHG is simulated with the single-electron time-dependent\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation (TDSE). The results show that the high-order harmonics\nin the second plateau generated from the doped semiconductors is about 1 to 3\norders of magnitude higher than those from the undoped semiconductor. The\nresults are explained based on the analysis of the energy band structure and\nthe time-dependent population imaging. Our work indicates that doping can\neffectively control the HHG in semiconductor.\n", "  This article deals with the Hadamard instability of the so-called $\\mu(I)$\nmodel of dense rapidly-sheared granular flow, as reported recently by Barker et\nal. (2015,this journal, ${\\bf 779}$, 794-818). The present paper presents a\nmore comprehensive study of the linear stability of planar simple shearing and\npure shearing flows, with account taken of convective Kelvin wave-vector\nstretching by the base flow. We provide a closed form solution for the linear\nstability problem and show that wave-vector stretching leads to asymptotic\nstabilization of the non-convective instability found by Barker et al. We also\nexplore the stabilizing effects of higher velocity gradients achieved by an\nenhanced-continuum model based on a dissipative analog of the van der\nWaals-Cahn-Hilliard equation of equilibrium thermodynamics. This model involves\na dissipative hyper-stress, as the analog of a special Korteweg stress, with\nsurface viscosity representing the counterpart of elastic surface tension.\nBased on the enhanced continuum model, we also present a model of steady shear\nbands and their non-linear stability against parallel shearing. Finally, we\npropose a theoretical connection between the non-convective instability of\nBarker et al. and the loss of generalized ellipticity in the quasi-static field\nequations. Apart from the theoretical interest, the present work may suggest\nstratagems for the numerical simulation of continuum field equations involving\nthe $\\mu(I)$ rheology and variants thereof.\n", "  Quadrupole and octupole deformation energy surfaces, low-energy excitation\nspectra and transition rates in fourteen isotopic chains: Xe, Ba, Ce, Nd, Sm,\nGd, Rn, Ra, Th, U, Pu, Cm, Cf, and Fm, are systematically analyzed using a\ntheoretical framework based on a quadrupole-octupole collective Hamiltonian\n(QOCH), with parameters determined by constrained reflection-asymmetric and\naxially-symmetric relativistic mean-field calculations. The microscopic QOCH\nmodel based on the PC-PK1 energy density functional and $\\delta$-interaction\npairing is shown to accurately describe the empirical trend of low-energy\nquadrupole and octupole collective states, and predicted spectroscopic\nproperties are consistent with recent microscopic calculations based on both\nrelativistic and non-relativistic energy density functionals. Low-energy\nnegative-parity bands, average octupole deformations, and transition rates show\nevidence for octupole collectivity in both mass regions, for which a\nmicroscopic mechanism is discussed in terms of evolution of single-nucleon\norbitals with deformation.\n", "  It is shown that standard constituent quark models produce $(\\bar c c qqq)$\nhidden-charm pentaquarks, where $c$ denotes the charmed quark and $q$ a light\nquark, which lie below the lowest threshold for spontaneous dissociation and\nthus are stable in the limit where the internal $\\bar c c$ annihilation is\nneglected. The binding is a cooperative effect of the chromoelectric and\nchromomagnetic components of the interaction, and it disappears in the static\nlimit with a pure chromoelectric potential. Their wave function contains color\nsextet and color octet configurations for the subsystems and can hardly be\nreduced to a molecular state made of two interacting hadrons. These pentaquark\nstates could be searched for in the experiments having discovered or confirmed\nthe hidden-charm meson and baryon resonances.\n", "  The discovery of new families of unconventional superconductors is important\nboth experimentally and theoretically, especially if it challenges current\nmodels and thinking. By using muon spin relaxation in zero-field, time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking has been observed in Re6Hf. Moreover, the temperature\ndependence of the superfluid density exhibits s-wave superconductivity with an\nenhanced electron-phonon coupling. This, coupled with the results from\nisostructural Re6Zr, shows that the Re6X family are indeed a new and important\ngroup of unconventional superconductors.\n", "  The single-$\\Xi^-$ hypernuclei are studied using a quark mean field model. At\nthe quark level, the $\\Xi^-$ hyperon is composed of one $d$ quark and two $s$\nquarks, which are confined by the harmonic oscillator potentials. In the case\nof hadrons, the baryons interact with each other by exchanging $\\sigma,\n~\\omega$, and $\\rho$ mesons between quarks in different baryons. The\nsingle-$\\Xi^-$ binding energies of $\\Xi$ hypernuclei are investigated from\n$\\ce{_{\\Xi^{-}}^{12}Be}$ to $\\ce{^{208}_{\\Xi^-}Tl}$ using different parameter\nsets, which are determined by the ground-state properties of several stable\nnuclei and the empirical values of the single-$\\Lambda$ and $\\Xi$ potentials at\nthe nuclear saturation density. For the bound states of $\\ce{\\Xi^{-}{+}^{14}N}$\n(i.e., $\\ce{^{15}_{\\Xi^-}C}$) system named as KISO event in KEK-E373\nexperiment, it is found that the $\\Xi^-$ binding energies are around\n$5.61-5.89$ MeV for $1s$ state and $0.94-1.21$ MeV for $1p$ state with\nQMF-NK1S, QMF-NK2S, and QMF-NK3S parameter sets, whose single $\\Xi$ potentials\nare $-12$ MeV. These results and those from cluster models with the Gaussian\nexpansion method concerning on the $\\ce{\\Xi^{-}{+}^{12}Be}$ show that in the\nKISO event, the $\\Xi^-$ hyperon may occupy the $1p$ state. Furthermore, the\n$\\Xi^-$ binding energies are achieved around $27$ MeV for the\n$\\ce{\\Xi^{-}{+}^{207}Pb}$ (i.e., $\\ce{^{208}_{\\Xi^-}Tl}$) system. The energies\nwere nearly comparable to the single-$\\Lambda$ binding energy of\n$\\ce{^{208}_{\\Lambda}Pb}$ observed by experiments. It demonstrates that the\n$\\Lambda$ and $\\Xi^-$ hyperons seem to appear simultaneously in a neutron star.\n", "  In this work, based on the recently proposed (Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 (2013)\n064105) continuous nonlocal nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger system with parity-time\nsymmetric Kerr nonlinearity (PTNLSE), a numerical investigation has been\ncarried out for two first order Peregrine solitons as the initial ansatz.\nPeregrine soliton, as an exact solution to the PTNLSE, evokes a very potent\nquestion: what effects does the interaction of two first order Peregrine\nsolitons have on the overall optical field dynamics. Upon numerical\ncomputation, we observe the appearance of Kuznetsov-Ma (KM) soliton trains in\nthe unbroken PT-phase when the initial Peregrine solitons are in phase. In the\nout of phase condition, it shows repulsive nonlinear waves. Quite\ninterestingly, our study shows that within a specific range of the interval\nfactor in the transverse coordinate there exists a string of high intensity\nwell-localized Peregrine rogue waves in the PT unbroken phase. We note that the\ninterval factor as well as the transverse shift parameter play important roles\nin the nonlinear interaction and evolution dynamics of the optical fields. This\ncould be important in developing fundamental understanding of nonlocal\nnon-Hermitian NLSE systems and dynamic wave localization behaviors.\n", "  The recent interest in beta- radionuclides for radio-guided surgery derives\nfrom the feature of the beta radiation to release energy in few millimeters of\ntissue. Such feature can be used to locate residual tumors with a probe located\nin its immediate vicinity, determining the resection margins with an accuracy\nof millimeters. The drawback of this technique is that it does not allow to\nidentify tumors hidden in more than few mm of tissue. Conversely, the\nbremsstrahlung X-rays emitted by the interaction of the beta- radiation with\nthe nuclei of the tissue are relatively penetrating. To complement the beta-\nprobes, we have therefore developed a detector based on cadmium telluride, an\nX-ray detector with a high quantum efficiency working at room temperature. We\nmeasured the secondary emission of bremsstrahlung photons in a target of\nPolymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with a density similar to living tissue. The\nresults show that this device allows to detect a 1 ml residual or lymph-node\nwith an activity of 1 kBq hidden under a layer of 10 mm of PMMA with a 3:1\nsignal to noise, i.e. with a five sigma discrimination in less than 5 s.\n", "  We explore the flavor-changing parameters mediated by a Higgs boson within\nthe THDM-III context. In particular, the $h\\to t^* c$ processes, and check the\nhigh suppression for the FC in the THDM-III context for the low $t_\\beta$\nparameters. Our exploration in the $\\chi_{ij}^{u}-\\chi_{ij}^{d}-$parameter\nspace shows the allowed regions for different $t_\\beta^{}$ values. We explored\ndifferent modes for Higgs decays, considered the experimental constraints to\nget scattering plots for the FC parameters and some relevant decay modes. We\nexpect future results to figure out the FC and its implications in the scalar\nsector.\n", "  We have experimentally and numerically investigated the dispersion of\ncollective spin waves prop-agating through arrays of longitudinally magnetized\nnanowires with periodically modulated width. Two nanowire arrays with\nsingle-side modulation and different periodicity of modulation were studied and\ncompared to the nanowires with homogeneous width. The spin-wave dispersion,\nmeas-ured up to the third Brillouin zone of the reciprocal space, revealed the\npresence of two dispersive modes for the width-modulated NWs, whose amplitude\nof magnonic band depends on the modula-tion periodicity, and a set of\nnondispersive modes at higher frequency. These findings are different from\nthose observed in homogeneous width NWs where only the lowest mode exhibits\nsizeable dis-persion. The measured spin-wave dispersion has been satisfactorily\nreproduced by means of dynam-ical matrix method. Results presented in this work\nare important in view of the possible realization of frequency tunable magnonic\ndevice.\n", "  The significantly screened heavy-quark potential in hot medium provides the\npossibility to study exotic quantum states of three-heavy-quark systems. By\nsolving the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a three-charm-quark system at finite\ntemperature, we found that, there exist Borromean states which might be\nrealized in high energy nuclear collisions, and the binding energies of the\nsystem satisfy precisely the scaling law for Efimov states in the resonance\nlimit.\n", "  After changing optical AGN type from 1.9 to 1 in 1984, the AGN Mrk 1018\nrecently reverted back to its type 1.9 state. Our ongoing monitoring now\nreveals that the AGN has halted its dramatic dimming, reaching a minimum around\nOctober 2016. The minimum was followed by an outburst rising with $\\sim$0.25\nU-band mag/month. The rebrightening lasted at least until February 2017, as\nconfirmed by joint Chandra and Hubble observations. Monitoring was resumed in\nJuly 2017 after the source emerged from sunblock, at which point the AGN was\nfound only $\\sim$0.4 mag brighter than its minimum. The intermittent outburst\nwas accompanied by the appearance of a red wing asymmetry in broad-line shape,\nindicative of an inhomogeneous broad-line region. The current flickering\nbrightness of Mrk 1018 following its rapid fading either suggests that the\nsource has reignited, remains variable at a low level, or may continue dimming\nover the next few years. Distinguishing between these possibilities requires\ncontinuous multiwavelength monitoring.\n", "  We analyze the effect of disorder on the weak-coupling instabilities of\nquadratic band crossing point (QBCP) in two-dimensional Fermi systems, which,\nin the clean limit, display interaction- driven topological insulating phases.\nIn the framework of a renormalization group procedure, which treats fermionic\ninteractions and disorder on the same footing, we test all possible\ninstabilities and identify the corresponding ordered phases in the presence of\ndisorder for both single-valley and two-valley QBCP systems. We find that\ndisorder generally suppresses the critical temperature at which the\ninteraction-driven topologically non-trivial order sets in. Strong disorder can\nalso cause a topological phase transition into a topologically trivial\ninsulating state.\n", "  We present an entanglement swapping process for unknown nonmaximally\nentangled photonic states, where the standard Bell-state measurement is\nreplaced by a three-step quantum walk-like state discrimination process, i.e.,\nthe practically nontrivial coupling element of two photons is replaced by\nmanipulating their trajectories, which will greatly enrich the dynamics of the\ncoupling between photons in realizing quantum computation, and reduce the\nintegration complexity of optical quantum processing. In addition, the output\nstate can be maximally entangled, which allows for entanglement concentration\nas well.\n", "  Topological phases, especially topological crystalline insulators (TCIs),\nhave been intensively explored observed experimentally in three-dimensional\n(3D) materials. However, the two-dimensional (2D) films are explored much less\nthan 3D TCI, and even 2D topological insulators. Based on ab initio\ncalculations, here we investigate the electronic and topological properties of\n2D PbTe(001) few-layers. The monolayer and trilayer PbTe are both intrinsic 2D\nTCIs with a large band gap reaching 0.27 eV, indicating a high possibility for\nroom-temperature observation of quantized conductance. The origin of TCI phase\ncan be attributed to the p band inversion,which is determined by the\ncompetitions of orbital hybridization and quantum confinement. We also observe\na semimetal-TCI-normal insulator transition under biaxial strains, whereas a\nuniaxial strains lead to Z2 nontrivial states. Especially, the TCI phase of\nPbTe monolayer remains when epitaxial grow on NaI semiconductor substrate. Our\nfindings on the controllable quantum states with sizable band gaps present an\nideal platform for realizing future topological quantum devices with ultralow\ndissipation.\n", "  It is known that the stochastic generators of effective processes associated\nwith the unconditioned dynamics of rare events might consist of non-local\ninteractions; however, it can be shown that there are special cases for which\nthese generators can include local interactions. In this paper we investigate\nthis possibility by considering systems of classical particles moving on a\none-dimensional lattice with open boundaries. The particles might have\nhard-core interactions similar to the particles in an exclusion process or\nthere can be arbitrary many particles at single site as in a zero-range\nprocess. Assuming that the interactions in the original process are local and\nsite-independent, we will show that under certain constraints on the\nmicroscopic reaction rules, the stochastic generator of unconditioned process\ncan be local but site-dependent. As two examples, the asymmetric\nzero-temperature Glauber model and the A-model with diffusion are presented and\nstudied under the above mentioned constraints.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the pattern formation observed when a fluid\nflows over a solid substrate that can dissolve or melt. We use a turbulent\nmixing description that includes the effect of the bed roughness. We show that\nthe dissolution instability at the origin of the pattern is associated with an\nanomaly at the transition from a laminar to a turbulent hydrodynamic response\nwith respect to the bed elevation. This anomaly, and therefore the instability,\ndisappears when the bed becomes hydrodynamically rough, above a threshold\nroughness-based Reynolds number. This suggests a possible mechanism for the\nselection of the pattern amplitude. The most unstable wavelength scales as\nobserved in nature on the thickness of the viscous sublayer, with a\nmultiplicative factor that depends on the dimensionless parameters of the\nproblem.\n", "  The Jagiellonian Positron Emission Tomograph (J-PET) is a detector for\nmedical imaging of the whole human body as well as for physics studies\ninvolving detection of electron-positron annihilation into photons. J-PET has\nhigh angular and time resolution and allows for measurement of spin of the\npositronium and the momenta and polarization vectors of annihilation quanta. In\nthis article, we present the potential of the J-PET system for background\nrejection in the decays of positronium atoms.\n", "  In this work we investigate the influence of a Fermi velocity modulation on\nthe Fano factor of periodic and quasi-periodic graphene superlattices. We\nconsider the continuum model and use the transfer matrix method to solve the\nDirac-like equation for graphene where the electrostatic potential, energy gap\nand Fermi velocity are piecewise constant functions of the position x. We found\nthat in the presence of an energy gap, it is possible to tune the energy of the\nFano factor peak and consequently the location of the Dirac point, by a\nmodulations in the Fermi velocity. Hence, the peak of the Fano factor can be\nused experimentally to identify the Dirac point. We show that for higher values\nof the Fermi velocity the Fano factor goes below 1/3 in the Dirac point.\nFurthermore, we show that in periodic superlattices the location of Fano factor\npeaks is symmetric when the Fermi velocity $v_A$ and $v_B$ is exchanged,\nhowever by introducing quasi-periodicity the symmetry is lost. The Fano factor\nusually holds a universal value for a specific transport regime, which reveals\nthat the possibility of controlling it in graphene is a notable result.\n", "  The initial Galactic velocity vector for the recently discovered hyperbolic\nasteroid 1I/'Oumuamua (A/2017 U1) is calculated for before its encounter with\nour solar system. The latest orbit (JPL-13) shows that 'Oumuamua has\neccentricity > 1 at 944\\sigma\\, significance (1.19936 +- 0.00021), i.e. clearly\nunbound. Assuming no non-gravitational forces, the object's inbound Galactic\nvelocity was U, V, W = -11.457, -22.395, -7.746 (+-0.009, +-0.009, +-0.011)\nkm/s (U towards Galactic center), with total heliocentric speed 26.32 +- 0.01\nkm/s. When the velocity is compared to the local stars, 'Oumuamua can be ruled\nout as co-moving with any of the dozen nearest systems, i.e. it does not appear\nto be associated with any local exo-Oort clouds (most notably that of the Alpha\nCentauri triple system). 'Oumuamua's velocity is within 5 km/s of the median\nGalactic velocity of the stars in the solar neighborhood (<25 pc), and within 2\nkm/s of the mean velocity of the local M dwarfs. Its velocity appears to be\nstatistically \"too\" typical for a body whose velocity was drawn from the\nGalactic velocity distribution of the local stars (i.e. less than 1 in 500\nfield stars in the solar neighborhood would have a velocity so close to the\nmedian UVW velocity). In the Local Standard of Rest frame (circular Galactic\nmotion), 'Oumuamua is remarkable for showing both negligible radial (U) and\nvertical (W) motion, while having a slightly sub-Keplerian circular velocity\n(V; by ~11 km/s). These calculations strengthen the interpretation that A/2017\nU1 has a distant extrasolar origin, but not among the very nearest stars. Any\nformation mechanism for this interstellar asteroid should account for the\ncoincidence of 'Oumuamua's velocity being so close to the LSR.\n", "  The creation of a global quantum network is within reach combining satellite\nlinks and quantum memory based approaches. Applications will range from secure\ncommunication and fundamental physics experiments to a future quantum internet.\n", "  We review recent theoretical results, demonstrating breakdown of the\nequivalence between active and passive gravitational masses and energy due to\nquantum effects in General Relativity. In particular, we discuss the simplest\ncomposite quantum body - a hydrogen atom - and define its gravitational masses\noperators. Using Gedanken experiment, we show that the famous Einstein's\nequation, $E =mc^2$, is broken with small probability for passive gravitational\nmass of the atom. It is important that the expectation values of both active\nand passive gravitational masses satisfy the above mentioned equation for\nstationary quantum states. Nevertheless, we stress that, for quantum\nsuperpositions of stationary states in a hydrogen atom, where the expectation\nvalues of energy are constant, the expectation values of the masses oscillate\nin time and, thus, break the Einstein's equation. We briefly discuss\nexperimental possibility to observe the above-mentioned time-dependent\noscillations. In this review, we also improve several drawbacks of the original\npioneering works.\n", "  The Technical Design Report (TDR) of the ILC mainly concentrates on a\nbaseline machine of 500 GeV centre-of-mass with detailed cost and manpower\nestimates consistent with this option. However, the discovery of a Higgs Boson\nwith a mass of 125 GeV opens up the possibility of reducing cost by starting at\na centre-of-mass energy of 250 GeV with the possibility of future upgrades to\n500 GeV or even 1 TeV should the physics case for such an upgrade be\ncompelling. The rest of this paper outlines the options for the design of a 250\nGeV \"Higgs factory\".\n", "  We study the level repulsion and its relationship with the localization\nlength in a disordered one-dimensional quantum wire excited with monochromatic\nlinearly polarized light and described by the Anderson-Floquet model. In the\nhigh frequency regime, the linear scaling between the localization length\ndivided by the length of the system and the spectral repulsion is the same as\nin the one-dimensional Anderson model without driving, although both quantities\ndepend on the parameters of the external field. In the low frequency regime the\nlevel repulsion depends mainly on the value of the amplitude of the field and\nthe proportionality between level repulsion and localization length is lost.\n", "  A high-precision half-life measurement for the superallowed Fermi $\\beta^+$\nemitter $^{22}$Mg was performed at the TRIUMF-ISAC facility using a 4$\\pi$\nproportional gas counter. The result of $T_{1/2} = 3.87400 \\pm 0.00079$ s is a\nfactor of 3 more precise than the previously adopted world average and resolves\na discrepancy between the two previously published $^{22}$Mg half-life\nmeasurements.\n", "  Lobe dynamics and escape from a potential well are general frameworks\nintroduced to study phase space transport in chaotic dynamical systems. While\nthe former approach studies how regions of phase space are transported by\nreducing the flow to a two-dimensional map, the latter approach studies the\nphase space structures that lead to critical events by crossing periodic orbit\naround saddles. Both of these frameworks require computation with curves\nrepresented by millions of points-computing intersection points between these\ncurves and area bounded by the segments of these curves-for quantifying the\ntransport and escape rate. We present a theory for computing these intersection\npoints and the area bounded between the segments of these curves based on a\nclassification of the intersection points using equivalence class. We also\npresent an alternate theory for curves with nontransverse intersections and a\nmethod to increase the density of points on the curves for locating the\nintersection points accurately.The numerical implementation of the theory\npresented herein is available as an open source software called Lober. We used\nthis package to demonstrate the application of the theory to lobe dynamics that\narises in fluid mechanics, and rate of escape from a potential well that arises\nin ship dynamics.\n", "  The Great Pyramid or Khufu's Pyramid was built on the Giza Plateau (Egypt)\nduring the IVth dynasty by the pharaoh Khufu (Cheops), who reigned from 2509 to\n2483 BC. Despite being one of the oldest and largest monuments on Earth, there\nis no consensus about how it was built. To better understand its internal\nstructure, we imaged the pyramid using muons, which are by-products of cosmic\nrays that are only partially absorbed by stone. The resulting cosmic-ray muon\nradiography allows us to visualize the known and potentially unknown voids in\nthe pyramid in a non-invasive way. Here we report the discovery of a large void\n(with a cross section similar to the Grand Gallery and a length of 30 m\nminimum) above the Grand Gallery, which constitutes the first major inner\nstructure found in the Great Pyramid since the 19th century. This void, named\nScanPyramids Big Void, was first observed with nuclear emulsion films installed\nin the Queen's chamber (University of Nagoya), then confirmed with scintillator\nhodoscopes set up in the same chamber (KEK) and re-confirmed with gas detectors\noutside of the pyramid (CEA). This large void has therefore been detected with\na high confidence by three different muon detection technologies and three\nindependent analyses. These results constitute a breakthrough for the\nunderstanding of Khufu's Pyramid and its internal structure. While there is\ncurrently no information about the role of this void, these findings show how\nmodern particle physics can shed new light on the world's archaeological\nheritage.\n", "  We had combined the Neukirch-Marko model that describes the extension, torque\nand supercoiling in single, stretched and twisted DNA of infinite contour\nlength, with a form of the free energy suggested by Sinha and Samuels to\ndescribe short DNA, with contour length only a few times the persistence\nlength. We find that the free energy of the stretched but untwisted DNA, is\nsignificantly modified from its infinitely length value and this in turn\nmodifies significantly the torque and supercoiling. We show that this is\nconsistent with short DNA being more flexible than infinitely long DNA. We hope\nour results will stimulate experimental investigation of torque and\nsupercoiling in short DNA.\n", "  The polytropic hydrodynamic vortex describes an effective $(2+1)$-dimensional\nacoustic spacetime with an inner reflecting boundary at $r=r_{\\text{c}}$. This\nphysical system, like the spinning Kerr black hole, possesses an ergoregion of\nradius $r_{\\text{e}}$ and an inner non-pointlike curvature singularity of\nradius $r_{\\text{s}}$. Interestingly, the fundamental ratio\n$r_{\\text{e}}/r_{\\text{s}}$ which characterizes the effective geometry is\ndetermined solely by the dimensionless polytropic index $N_{\\text{p}}$ of the\ncirculating fluid. It has recently been proved that, in the $N_{\\text{p}}=0$\ncase, the effective acoustic spacetime is characterized by an {\\it infinite}\ncountable set of reflecting surface radii,\n$\\{r_{\\text{c}}(N_{\\text{p}};n)\\}^{n=\\infty}_{n=1}$, that can support static\n(marginally-stable) sound modes. In the present paper we use {\\it analytical}\ntechniques in order to explore the physical properties of the polytropic\nhydrodynamic vortex in the $N_{\\text{p}}>0$ regime. In particular, we prove\nthat in this physical regime, the effective acoustic spacetime is characterized\nby a {\\it finite} discrete set of reflecting surface radii,\n$\\{r_{\\text{c}}(N_{\\text{p}},m;n)\\}^{n=N_{\\text{max}}}_{n=1}$, that can support\nthe marginally-stable static sound modes (here $m$ is the azimuthal harmonic\nindex of the acoustic perturbation field). Interestingly, it is proved\nanalytically that the dimensionless outermost supporting radius\n$r^{\\text{max}}_{\\text{c}}/r_{\\text{e}}$, which marks the onset of superradiant\ninstabilities in the polytropic hydrodynamic vortex, increases monotonically\nwith increasing values of the integer harmonic index $m$ and decreasing values\nof the dimensionless polytropic index $N_{\\text{p}}$.\n", "  The Andreev transport properties of double quantum dot based Cooper pair\nsplitters with one superconducting and two normal leads are studied\ntheoretically in the Kondo regime. The influence of the superconducting pairing\ncorrelations on the local density of states, Andreev transmission coefficient\nand Cooper pair splitting efficiency is thoroughly analyzed. It is shown that\nfinite superconducting pairing potential quickly suppresses the SU(2) Kondo\neffect, which can however reemerge for relatively large values of coupling to\nsuperconductor. In the SU(4) Kondo regime, a crossover from the SU(4) to the\nSU(2) Kondo state is found as the coupling to superconductor is enhanced. The\nanalysis is performed by means of the density-matrix numerical renormalization\ngroup method.\n", "  The origin of extragalactic magnetic fields is still poorly understood. Based\non a dedicated suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with\nthe ENZO code we have performed a survey of different models that may have\ncaused present-day magnetic fields in galaxies and galaxy clusters. The\noutcomes of these models differ in cluster outskirts, filaments, sheets and\nvoids and we use these simulations to find observational signatures of\nmagnetogenesis. With these simulations, we predict the signal of extragalactic\nmagnetic fields in radio observations of synchrotron emission from the cosmic\nweb, in Faraday Rotation, in the propagation of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays,\nin the polarized signal from Fast Radio Bursts at cosmological distance and in\nspectra of distant blazars. In general, primordial scenarios in which\npresent-day magnetic fields originate from the amplification of weak (<nG)\nuniform seed fields result more homogeneous and relatively easier to observe\nmagnetic fields than than astrophysical scenarios, in which present-day fields\nare the product of feedback processes triggered by stars and active galaxies.\nIn the near future the best evidence for the origin of cosmic magnetic fields\nwill most likely come from a combination of synchrotron emission and Faraday\nRotation observed at the periphery of large-scale structures.\n", "  Cosmic rays could be produced via shock acceleration powered by supernovae.\nThe supernova hypothesis implies that each supernova injects on average some\n1e50 erg in cosmic rays, while the shock acceleration model predicts a powerlaw\ncosmic ray spectrum with the slope close to 2. Verification of these\npredictions requires measurements of spectrum and power of cosmic ray injection\nfrom supernova population(s). Here we obtain such measurements based on\ngamma-ray observation of Constellation III region of Large Magellanic Cloud. We\nshow that gamma-ray emission from this young star formation region originates\nfrom cosmic rays injected by approximately two thousand supernovae, rather than\nby massive star wind powered superbubble pre-dating supernova activity. Cosmic\nray injection power is found to be (1.1-0.2+0.5)x 1e50 erg/supernova (for the\nestimated interstellar medium density 0.3/cm3). The spectrum is a powerlaw with\nslope 2.09-0.07+0.06. This agrees with the model of particle acceleration at\nsupernova shocks and provides a direct proof of the supernova origin of cosmic\nrays.\n", "  Vanadium dioxide (VO$_{2}$) undergoes a first-order metal-insulator\ntransition (MIT) upon cooling near room temperature, concomitant with\nstructural change from rutile to monoclinic. Accurate characterization of\nlattice vibrations is vital for elucidating the transition mechanism. To\ninvestigate the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of VO$_{2}$\nacross the MIT, we present a phonon renormalization scheme based on\nself-consistent phonon theory through iteratively refining vibrational free\nenergy. Using this technique, we compute temperature-dependent phonon\ndispersion and lifetimes, and point out the importance of both magnetic and\nvibrational entropy in driving the MIT. The predicted phonon dispersion and\nlifetimes show quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. We\ndemonstrate that lattice thermal conductivity of rutile VO$_{2}$ is nearly\ntemperature independent as a result of strong intrinsic anharmonicity, while\nthat of monoclinic VO$_{2}$ varies according to $1/T$. Due to phonon softening\nand enhanced scattering rates, the lattice thermal conductivity is deduced to\nbe substantially lower in the rutile phase, suggesting that Wiedemann-Franz law\nmight not be strongly violated in rutile VO$_{2}$.\n", "  Sensing, localising and identifying individual nuclear spins or frequency\ncomponents of a signal in the presence of a noisy environments requires the\ndevelopment of robust and selective methods of dynamical decoupling. An\nimportant challenge that remains to be addressed in this context are spurious\nhigher order resonances in current dynamical decoupling sequences as they can\nlead to the misidentification of nuclei or of different frequency components of\nexternal signals. Here we overcome this challenge with engineered quantum\nsensing sequences that achieve both, enhanced robustness and the simultaneous\nsuppression of higher order harmonic resonances. We demonstrate experimentally\nthe principle using a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin sensor which we apply\nto the unambiguous detection of external protons.\n", "  A nematic topological superconductor has an order parameter symmetry, which\nspontaneously breaks the crystalline symmetry in its superconducting state.\nThis state can be observed, for example, by thermodynamic or upper critical\nfield experiments in which a magnetic field is rotated with respect to the\ncrystalline axes. The corresponding physical quantity then directly reflects\nthe symmetry of the order parameter. We present a study on the superconducting\nupper critical field of the Nb-doped topological insulator NbxBi2Se3 for\nvarious magnetic field orientations parallel and perpendicular to the basal\nplane of the Bi2Se3 layers. The data were obtained by two complementary\nexperimental techniques, magnetoresistance and DC magnetization, on three\ndifferent single crystalline samples of the same batch. Both methods and all\nsamples show with perfect agreement that the in-plane upper critical fields\nclearly demonstrate a two-fold symmetry that breaks the three-fold crystal\nsymmetry. The two-fold symmetry is also found in the absolute value of the\nmagnetization of the initial zero-field-cooled branch of the hysteresis loop\nand in the value of the thermodynamic contribution above the irreversibility\nfield, but also in the irreversible properties such as the value of the\ncharacteristic irreversibility field and in the width of the hysteresis loop.\nThis provides strong experimental evidence that Nb-doped Bi2Se3 is a nematic\ntopological superconductor similar to the Cu- and Sr-doped Bi2Se3.\n", "  The capture of K$^-$ mesons on nucleons bound in nuclei offer a chance to\nstudy the $\\Sigma \\pi$ pairs below the kinematic threshold of the\n$\\bar{\\mathrm{K}}$N systems. Various hyperon-pion charged combination are\npresently under investigation by AMADEUS. These data allow to test both isospin\n0 and 1 amplitudes giving the possibility to detect the structure of resonant\n$\\Lambda$(1405) state. Contrasted against similar electro-production data, it\nis possible to detect changes of $\\Lambda$(1405) in nuclear media. Expected\nspectra and their uncertainties are calculated.\n", "  Microscopic theory of the nonradiative energy transfer in a system of III-V\nsemiconductor quantum dots is elaborated in our work. The energy transfer both\ndue to direct Coulomb and due to exchange interactions between two quantum dots\n(energy donor and acceptor) is considered. An analysis of energy transfer\nprocess is performed in the frame of the Kane model that provides the most\nadequate description of the real energy spectra and wave functions of III-V\nsemiconductors. The density-matrix method is applied, which enabled us to\nanalyze the energy transfer rate both in the weak-interaction approximation and\nin the strong-interaction approximation. For the first time the detailed\nanalytical calculations of the exchange energy transfer rate for the quantum\ndot system are performed. The analytical expressions for contributions to the\ntransfer rate are derived. The numerical calculations showed that at nearly\ncontact distances between two quantum dots the rate of the energy transfer due\nto the direct Coulomb interaction as well as by exchange interaction can reach\nthe saturation. At the small distances, these two contributions can be of the\nsame order and can have the same value in the saturation range. It is revealed\nthat the exchange interaction should be taken into consideration in qualitative\ndescribing the energy transfer at small distances between the quantum dot donor\nand the quantum dot acceptor.\n", "  In this article we discuss confinement of electrons in graphene via smooth\nmagnetic fields which are finite everywhere on the plane. We shall consider two\ntypes of magnetic fields leading to systems which are conditionally exactly\nsolvable and quasi exactly solvable. The bound state energies and wave\nfunctions in both cases have been found exactly.\n", "  We study the anomalous $W^+W^-V$ ($V=\\gamma,Z$) couplings in $e^+e^-\\to\nW^+W^-$ using the complete set of polarization observables of $W$ boson with\nlongitudinally polarized beams. We use most general Lorentz invariant form\nfactors parametrization as well as $SU(2)\\times U(1)$ invariant dimension $6$\neffective operators for the effective $W^+W^-V$ couplings. We estimate\nsimultaneous limits on the anomalous couplings in both the parametrizations\nusing cross section, forward backward asymmetry and polarization observables of\n$W$ boson with different kinematical cuts using Markov-Chain--Monte-Carlo\n(MCMC) method for an $e^+e^-$ collider running at centre of mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV and ${\\cal L}=100$ fb$^{-1}$. The best limits on form\nfactors are obtained to be $1 \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-2}$ for $e^-$ and $e^+$\npolarization being $(+0.4,-0.4)$. For operator's coefficients, the best limits\nare obtained to be $1\\sim 16$ TeV$^{-2}$.\n", "  We calculate the emission of protoplanetary disks threaded by a poloidal\nmagnetic field and irradiated by the central star. The radial structure of\nthese disks was studied by Shu and collaborators and the vertical structure was\nstudied by Lizano and collaborators. We consider disks around low mass\nprotostars, T Tauri stars, and FU Ori stars with different mass-to-flux ratios\n$\\lambda_{\\rm sys}$. We calculate the spectral energy distribution and the\nantenna temperature profiles at 1 mm and 7 mm convolved with the ALMA and VLA\nbeams. We find that disks with weaker magnetization (high values of\n$\\lambda_{\\rm sys}$) emit more than disks with stronger magnetization (low\nvalues of $\\lambda_{\\rm sys}$). This happens because the former are denser,\nhotter and have larger aspect ratios, receiving more irradiation from the\ncentral star. The level of magnetization also affects the optical depth at\nmillimeter wavelengths, being larger for disks with high $\\lambda_{\\rm sys}$.\nIn general, disks around low mass protostars and T Tauri stars are optically\nthin at 7 mm while disks around FU Ori are optically thick. A qualitative\ncomparison of the emission of these magnetized disks, including heating by an\nexternal envelope, with the observed millimeter antenna temperature profiles of\nHL Tau indicates that large cm grains are required to increase the optical\ndepth and reproduce the observed 7 mm emission at large radii.\n", "  The momentum distribution of $^{11}$Be fragments produced by the breakup of\n$^{12}$Be interacting with a proton target at 700.5 MeV/$u$ energy has been\nmeasured at GSI Darmstadt. To obtain the structure information on the anomaly\nof the $N=8$ neutron shell, the momentum distribution of $^{11}$Be fragments\nfrom the one-neutron knockout $^{12}$Be(p,pn) reaction, measured in inverse\nkinematics, has been analysed in the distorted wave impulse approximation\n(DWIA) based on a quasi-free scattering scenario. The DWIA analysis shows a\nsurprisingly strong contribution of the neutron $0d_{5/2}$ orbital in $^{12}$Be\nto the transverse momentum distribution of the $^{11}$Be fragments. The\nsingle-neutron $0d_{5/2}$ spectroscopic factor deduced from the present\nknock-out data is 1.39(10), which is significantly larger than that deduced\nrecently from data of $^{12}$Be breakup on a carbon target. This result\nprovides a strong experimental evidence for the dominance of the neutron\n$\\nu(0d_{5/2})^2$ configuration in the ground state of $^{12}$Be.\n", "  The main scientific activity in the field of topological insulators (TIs)\nconsists of determining their electronic structure by means of\nmagneto-transport and electron spectroscopy with a view to devices based on\ntopological transport. There is however a caveat in this approach. There are\nsystematic experimental discrepancies on the electronic structure of the most\npristine surfaces of TI single crystals as determined by Shubnikov de Haas\n(SdH) oscillations and by Angle Resolved PhotoElectron Spectroscopy (ARPES). We\nidentify intense ultraviolet illumination -that is inherent to an ARPES\nexperiment- as the source for these experimental differences. We explicitly\nshow that illumination is the key parameter, or in other words the trigger, for\nenergetic shifts of electronic bands near the surface of a TI crystal. This\nfinding revisits the common belief that surface decoration is the principal\ncause of surface band bending and explains why band bending is not a prime\nissue in the illumination-free magneto-transport studies. Our study further\nclarifies the role of illumination on the electronic band structure of TIs by\nrevealing its dual effect: downward band bending on very small timescales\nfollowed by band flattening at large timescales. Our results therefore allow us\nto present and predict the complete evolution of the band structure of TIs in a\ntypical ARPES experiment. By virtue of our findings, we pinpoint two\nalternatives of how to approach flat band conditions by means of photon-based\ntechniques and we suggest a microscopic mechanism that can explain the\nunderlying phenomena.\n", "  We numerically investigated the plane-wave reflection-transmission\ncharacteristics of a columnar thin film (CTF) whose columns are made from a\ndissipative material but whose void regions are filled with an active material.\nBy computing the reflectances and transmittances, we found that the CTF can\nsimultaneously amplify $s$-polarized incident light and attenuate $p$-polarized\nincident light, or vice versa. This polarization-state-dependent attenuation\nand amplification phenomenon depends upon the angle of incidence and the\nthickness of the CTF.\n", "  This Reply is intended as a refutation of the preceding Comment [Oikonomou\nand Bagci, Phys. Rev. E 96, 056101 (2017)] on our paper [Plastino et al., Phys.\nRev. E 94, 012145 (2016).]. We show that the Tsallis probability distribution\nof our paper does not coincide with the Tsallis distribution studied by\nOikonomou and Bagci. Consequently, their findings do not apply to our paper.\n", "  Highly accurate closed-form approximations are given for the ground state and\nfirst excited state wavefunctions and energies for a nonrelativistic particle\nin a one-dimensional double square well potential with a square barrier in\nbetween (so that the potential is a sequence of five constant pieces that\nalternate in value from being above and below the ground state and first\nexcited state energies), under the assumption that the barrier is sufficiently\nwide that the tunneling across it is very small.\n", "  The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR is a $^{76}$Ge-based neutrinoless double-beta decay\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) experiment. Staged at the 4850 ft level of the Sanford\nUnderground Research Facility, the DEMONSTRATOR operates an array of\nhigh-purity p-type point contact Ge detectors deployed within a graded passive\nshield and an active muon veto system. The present work concerns the\ntwo-neutrino double-beta decay mode ($2\\nu\\beta\\beta$) of $^{76}$Ge. For Ge\ndetectors, having superior energy resolution (0.1%), this mode poses negligible\nbackground to the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ mode, even for a ton-scale experiment.\nHowever, the measurement of the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ mode allows for careful\nsystematics checks of active detector mass, enrichment fraction, and pulse\nshape discrimination cuts related to both the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and\n$2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay modes. A precision measurement of the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$\nshape also allows searches for spectral distortions, possibly indicative of new\nphysics, including $0\\nu\\beta\\beta\\chi$. Work is underway to construct a full\nexperimental background model enabling a Bayesian fit to the measured energy\nspectrum and extraction of a precise $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ spectrum and half-life.\n", "  Gamma-Ray Infrastructure For Fundamental Investigations of Nuclei, GRIFFIN,\nis a new experimental facility for radioactive decay studies at the TRIUMF-ISAC\nlaboratory. This article describes the details of the custom designed GRIFFIN\ndigital data acquisition system. The features of the system that will enable\nhigh-precision half-life and branching ratio measurements with levels of\nuncertainty better than 0.05% are described. The system has demonstrated the\nability to effectively collect signals from High-purity germanium crystals at\ncounting rates up to 50kHz while maintaining good energy resolution, detection\nefficiency and spectral quality.\n", "  Carrier-envelope phase stabilization of optical pulses enables exquisitely\nprecise measurements by way of direct optical-frequency synthesis, absolute\noptical-to-microwave phase conversion, and control of ultrafast waveforms. We\nreport such phase stabilization for Kerr-microresonator frequency combs\nintegrated on silicon chips, and verify their fractional-frequency inaccuracy\nat <3x10-16. Our work introduces an interlocked Kerr-comb configuration\ncomprised of one silicon-nitride and one silica microresonator, which feature\nnearly harmonic repetition frequencies and can be generated with one laser.\nThese frequency combs support an ultrafast-laser regime with few-optical-cycle,\n1-picosecond-period soliton pulses and a total dispersive-wave-enhanced\nbandwidth of 170 THz, while providing a stable phase-link between the optical\nand microwave domains. To accommodate low-power and mobile application\nplatforms, our phase-locked frequency-comb system operates with <250 mW of\nchip-coupled power. Our work establishes Kerr-microresonator combs as a viable\ntechnology for applications like optical-atomic timekeeping, optical synthesis,\nand related directions.\n", "  The energy balance of a partially molten rocky planet can be expressed as a\nnon-linear diffusion equation using mixing length theory to quantify heat\ntransport by both convection and mixing of the melt and solid phases. In this\nformulation the effective or eddy diffusivity depends on the entropy gradient,\n$\\partial S/\\partial r$, as well as entropy. First we present a simplified\nmodel with semi-analytical solutions, highlighting the large dynamic range of\n$\\partial S/\\partial r$, around 12 orders of magnitude, for physically-relevant\nparameters. It also elucidates the thermal structure of a magma ocean during\nthe earliest stage of crystal formation. This motivates the development of a\nsimple, stable numerical scheme able to capture the large dynamic range of\n$\\partial S/\\partial r$ and provide a flexible and robust method for\ntime-integrating the energy equation.\n  We then consider a full model including energy fluxes associated with\nconvection, mixing, gravitational separation, and conduction that all depend on\nthe thermophysical properties of the melt and solid phases. This model is\ndiscretised and evolved by applying the finite volume method (FVM), allowing\nfor extended precision calculations and using $\\partial S/\\partial r$ as the\nsolution variable. The FVM is well-suited to this problem since it is naturally\nenergy conserving, flexible, and intuitive to incorporate arbitrary non-linear\nfluxes that rely on lookup data. Special attention is given to the numerically\nchallenging scenario in which crystals first form in the centre of a magma\nocean.\n  Our computational framework is immediately applicable to modelling high melt\nfraction phenomena in Earth and planetary science research. Furthermore, it\nprovides a template for solving similar non-linear diffusion equations arising\nin other disciplines, particularly for non-linear functional forms of the\ndiffusion coefficient.\n", "  In this paper we present our study on the critical behavior of a stochastic\nanisotropic Bak-Sneppen (saBS) model, in which a parameter $\\alpha$ is\nintroduced to describe the interaction strength among nearest species. We\nestimate the threshold fitness $f_c$ and the critical exponent $\\tau_r$ by\nnumerically integrating a master equation for the distribution of avalanche\nspatial sizes. Other critical exponents are then evaluated from previously\nknown scaling relations. The numerical results are in good agreement with the\ncounterparts yielded by the Monte Carlo simulations. Our results indicate that\nall saBS models with nonzero interaction strength exhibit self-organized\ncriticality, and fall into the same universality class, by sharing the\nuniversal critical exponents.\n", "  We report 33 V-band observations by the Hereford Arizona Observatory (HAO) of\nthe enigmatic star KIC 8462852 during the two week period 3-17 August 2017. We\nfind a striking resemblance of these observations to the Kepler day 1540 dip\nwith HAO observations tracking the Kepler light curve (adjusted for egress\nsymmetry). A possible explanation of this potential repeat transit is a brown\ndwarf and extensive ring system in a 1601-day eccentric orbit. We suggest this\nobject may be detectable through radial velocity observations in October and\nNovember 2017, with an amplitude of ~ 1-2 kms-1.\n", "  LHCb has reported hints of lepton-flavor universality violation in the rare\ndecays $B \\to K^{(*)} \\ell^+\\ell^-$, both in high- and low-$q^2$ bins. Although\nthe high-$q^2$ hint may be explained by new short-ranged interactions, the\nlow-$q^2$ one cannot. We thus explore the possibility that the latter is\nexplained by a new light resonance. We find that LHCb's central value of\n$R_{K^*}$ in the low-$q^2$ bin is achievable in a restricted parameter space of\nnew-physics scenarios in which the new, light resonance decays preferentially\nto electrons and has a mass within approximately $10$ MeV of the di-muon\nthreshold. Interestingly, such an explanation can have a kinematic origin and\ndoes not require a source of lepton-flavor universality violation. A\nmodel-independent prediction is a narrow peak in the differential $B \\to K^*\ne^+e^-$ rate close to the di-muon threshold. If such a peak is observed, other\nobservables, such as the differential $B \\to K e^+e^-$ rate and $R_K$, may be\nemployed to distinguish between models. However, if a low-mass resonance is not\nobserved and the low-$q^2$ anomaly increases in significance, then the case for\nan experimental origin of the lepton-flavor universality violating anomalies\nwould be strengthened. To further explore this, we also point out that, in\nanalogy to $J/\\psi$ decays, $e^+e^-$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decays of $\\phi$ mesons\ncan be used as a cross check of lepton-flavor universality by LHCb with $5$\nfb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyse the topological defects in a deformation of a\nnon-abelian gauge theory using the Polyakov variables. The gauge theory will be\ndeformed by the existence of a minimum measurable length scale in the\nbackground spacetime. We will construct the Polyakov loops for this deformed\nnon-abelian gauge theory, and use these deformed loop space variables for\nobtaining a deformed loop space curvature. It will be demonstrated that this\ncurvature will vanish if the deformed Bianchi identities are satisfied.\nHowever, it is possible that the original Bianchi identities are satisfied, but\nthe deformed Bianchi identities are violated at the leading order in the\ndeformation parameter, due to some topological defects. Thus, topological\ndefects could be produced purely from a deformation of the background geometry.\n", "  A method to study strongly interacting quantum many-body systems at and away\nfrom criticality is proposed. The method is based on a MERA-like tensor network\nthat can be efficiently and reliably contracted on a noisy quantum computer\nusing a number of qubits that is much smaller than the system size. We prove\nthat the outcome of the contraction is stable to noise and that the estimated\nenergy upper bounds the ground state energy. The stability, which we\nnumerically substantiate, follows from the positivity of operator scaling\ndimensions under renormalization group flow. The variational upper bound\nfollows from a particular assignment of physical qubits to different locations\nof the tensor network plus the assumption that the noise model is local. We\npostulate a scaling law for how well the tensor network can approximate ground\nstates of lattice regulated conformal field theories in d spatial dimensions\nand provide evidence for the postulate. Under this postulate, a\n$O(\\log^{d}(1/\\delta))$-qubit quantum computer can prepare a valid\nquantum-mechanical state with energy density $\\delta$ above the ground state.\nIn the presence of noise, $\\delta = O(\\epsilon \\log^{d+1}(1/\\epsilon))$ can be\nachieved, where $\\epsilon$ is the noise strength.\n"]}
