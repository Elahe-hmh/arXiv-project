The method is illustrated with an application to the flavor\nasymmetry of the nucleon sea.\n", "  We present the formalism for a new generation of unquenched quark models for\nbaryons in which the effects of quark-antiquark pairs (u anti-u, d anti-d and s\nanti-s) are taken into account in an explicit form via a microscopic,\nQCD-inspired, quark-antiquark creation mechaniscm. The present approach is an\nextension of the flux-tube breaking model of Geiger and Isgur in which now the\ncontributions of quark-antiquark pairs an be studied for any initial baryon and\nfor any flavor of the q anti-q pair. It is shown that the inclusion of q anti-q\nparis leads to a large contribution of orbital angular momentum to the proton\nspin.\n", "  We discuss the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon in an unquenched quark model\nfor baryons in which the effects of quark-antiquark pairs (u anti-u, d anti-d\nand s anti-s) are taken into account in an explicit form. It is shown that the\ninclusion of q anti-q pairs leads to an excess of anti-d over anti-u quarks in\nthe proton.\n", "  We present evidence of the existence of a new supersymmetric quartet of\nnuclei in the A=190 mass region. The analysis is based on new experimental\ninformation on the odd-odd nucleus 194Ir from transfer and capture reactions.\nThe new data allow the identification of a new supersymmetric quartet,\nconsisting of the 192,193Os and 193,194Ir nuclei.

Finally, we study correlations between different\ntransfer reactions.\n", "  The flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea is discussed in an unquenched quark\nmodel for baryons in which the effects of quark-antiquark pairs (u anti-u, d\nanti-d and s anti-s) are taken into account in an explicit form. The inclusion\nof q anti-q pairs leads automatically to an excess of anti-d over anti-u quarks\nin the proton, in agreement with experimental data.\n", "  We present evidence for a new supersymmetric quartet in the A=190 region of\nthe nuclear mass table.

A set of useful variables are proposed and used in a\nmultivariate technique to separate signal $e^- e^+ \\rightarrow Z/\\gamma\n\\rightarrow t \\bar{q} ~ ( \\bar{t} q )$ from standard model background\nprocesses. The study includes a fast detector simulation based on the {\\sc\ndelphes} package to consider the detector effects. The $3 \\sigma$ discovery\nregions and the upper limits on the FCNC branching ratios at 95\\% confidence\nlevel (CL) in terms of the integrated luminosity are presented. It is shown\nthat with 300 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity of data, FCC-ee would be able\nto exclude the effective coupling strengths above ${\\cal O} (10^{-4}-10^{-5})$\nwhich is corresponding to branching fraction of ${\\cal O}(0.01-0.001)$\\%. We\nshow that moving to a high-luminosity regime leads to a significant improvement\non the upper bounds on the top quark FCNC couplings to a photon or a $Z$ boson.\n", "  In this note, we solve an inverse spectral problem for a class of finite band\nsymmetric matrices. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix\nvalued function to be a spectral function of the operator corresponding to a\nmatrix in our class and give an algorithm for recovering this matrix from the\nspectral function. The reconstructive algorithm is applicable to matrices which\ncannot be treated by known inverse block matrix methods. Our approach to the\ninverse problem is based on the rational interpolation theory developed in a\nprevious paper.\n", "  In this contribution, I discuss an algebraic treatment of alpha-cluster\nnuclei based on the introduction of a spectrum generating algebra for the\nrelative motion of the alpha-clusters. Particular attention is paid to the\ndiscrete symmetry of the geometric arrangement of the alpha-particles, and the\nconsequences for the structure of the rotational bands in the 12C and 16O\nnuclei.\n", "  I present a derivation of form factors in the Algebraic Cluster Model for an\narbitrary number of identical clusters. The form factors correspond to\nrepresentation matrix elements which are derived in closed form for the\nharmonic oscillator and deformed oscillator limits. These results are relevant\nfor applications in nuclear, molecular and hadronic physics.\n", "  In this contribution, we discuss the spin and flavor content of the proton in\nthe framework of the unquenched quark model, and address the role of valence\nand sea quarks in the nucleon.\n", "  We assess the fraction of the Milky Way's circumgalactic medium (CGM) eluding\ndetection due to its velocity being similar to gas in the disk. This is\nachieved using synthetic observations of the CGM in a simulated MW-mass galaxy\nthat shows similar CGM kinematics to the MW and external L$\\sim$L$_*$ galaxies.\nAs viewed by a mock observer at a location similar to the Sun, only 50$\\%$ (by\nmass) of the gas moves at high velocity ($|v_{\\rm LSR}|\\geq$100 km s$^{-1}$ or\n$|v_{\\rm DEV}|\\geq$50 km s$^{-1}$) in the simulated CGM and would be\nobservable. The low velocity gas is thermodynamically similar to the high\nvelocity gas, indicating the 50$\\%$ observable fraction is applicable to\nspectral lines from the radio to the ultraviolet. We apply the observable mass\nfraction (50$\\%$) to current estimates of the MW's CGM, and find a corrected\ntotal mass of 2.8$\\times$10$^{8} M_{\\odot}$ for gas below 10$^6$K within\n$\\sim15$ kpc (this excludes the Magellanic System). This is less than the total\nmass of the CGM extending out to $\\sim$150 kpc in other L$\\sim$L$_*$ galaxies.\nHowever, we find similar OVI column densities when the discrepancy in path\nlength between the MW and external galaxies is considered. The coherent spatial\nand kinematic distribution of low velocity gas in the simulated CGM suggests\nthat current HI observations of the MW's CGM may miss large low velocity HI\ncomplexes. In addition, current mass estimates of the MW's CGM based on\nhigh-velocity line observations with distance constraints may miss a\nnon-negligible fraction of gas in the outer halo which can be obscured if it\nmoves at a velocity similar to the gas in the lower halo.\n", "  Resolving quantum many-body problems represents one of the greatest\nchallenges in physics and physical chemistry, due to the prohibitively large\ncomputational resources that would be required by using classical computers. A\nsolution has been foreseen by directly simulating the time evolution through\nsequences of quantum gates applied to arrays of qubits, i.e. by implementing a\ndigital quantum simulator. Superconducting circuits and resonators are emerging\nas an extremely-promising platform for quantum computation architectures, but a\ndigital quantum simulator proposal that is straightforwardly scalable,\nuniversal, and realizable with state-of-the-art technology is presently\nlacking. Here we propose a viable scheme to implement a universal quantum\nsimulator with hybrid spin-photon qubits in an array of superconducting\nresonators, which is intrinsically scalable and allows for local control. As\nrepresentative examples we consider the transverse-field Ising model, a spin-1\nHamiltonian, and the two-dimensional Hubbard model; for these, we numerically\nsimulate the scheme by including the main sources of decoherence. In addition,\nwe show how to circumvent the potentially harmful effects of inhomogeneous\nbroadening of the spin systems.\n", "  Within the scope of a LRS Bianchi type-I cosmological model we study the role\nof the nonlinear spinor field in the evolution of the Universe. In doing so we\nconsider a polynomial type of nonlinearity that describes different stages of\nthe evolution. Finally we also use the observational data to fix the problem\nparameters that match best with the real picture of the evolution. The\nassessment of the age of the Universe in case of the soft beginning of\nexpansion (initial speed of expansion in a point of singularity is equal to\nzero) the age was found 15 billion years, whereas in case of the hard beginning\n(nontrivial initial speed) it was found that the Universe is 13.7 billion years\nold.\n", "  We explore the topological transformation of quasi-2D Bose-Einstein\ncondensates of dilute atomic gases, and changes in the low-energy\nquasiparticles associated with the geometry of the confining potential. In\nparticular, we show the density profile of the condensate and quantum\nfluctuation follow the transition from a multiply to a simply connected\ngeometry of the confining potential. The thermal fluctuations, in contrast,\nremain multiply connected. The genesis of the key difference lies in the\nstructure of the low-energy quasiparticles. For which we use the\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov, and study the evolution of quasiparticles, the dipole\nor the Kohn mode in particular. We, then employ the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov\ntheory with the Popov approximation to investigate the density and the momentum\ndistribution of the thermal atoms.\n", "  In this contribution, we discuss the strangeness suppression in the proton in\nthe framework of the unquenched quark model. The theoretical results are in\ngood agreement with the values extracted from CERN and JLab experiments.\n", "  As the human brain develops, it increasingly supports coordinated control of\nneural activity. The mechanism by which white matter evolves to support this\ncoordination is not well understood. We use a network representation of\ndiffusion imaging data from 882 youth ages 8 to 22 to show that white matter\nconnectivity becomes increasingly optimized for a diverse range of predicted\ndynamics in development. Notably, stable controllers in subcortical areas are\nnegatively related to cognitive performance. Investigating structural\nmechanisms supporting these changes, we simulate network evolution with a set\nof growth rules. We find that all brain networks are structured in a manner\nhighly optimized for network control, with distinct control mechanisms\npredicted in child versus older youth. We demonstrate that our results cannot\nbe simply explained by changes in network modularity. This work reveals a\npossible mechanism of human brain development that preferentially optimizes\ndynamic network control over static network architecture.\n", "  A one-dimensional time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor hosts a\nMajorana Kramers pair at each end, where time-reversal symmetry acts as a\nsupersymmetry that flips local fermion parity. We examine the transport anomaly\nof such a superconductor, floating and tunnel-coupled to normal leads at its\ntwo ends. We demonstrate the realization of a topologically-protected,\nchannel-symmetric, two-channel Kondo effect without fine-tuning. Whereas the\nnonlocal teleportation vanishes, a lead present at one end telecontrols the\nuniversal transport through the other end.\n", "  The bound derived in the submission (subsequently published in J. Fluid\nMechanics vol 808 p 562-575, 2016) with the above title is incorrect. This\ncorrigendum explains why and also why there can not be any quick fix.\n", "  This paper deals with the propagation of Klein-Gordon particles in flat\nbackground spacetime exhibiting discontinuous metric changes from a Lorentzian\nsignature (-,+,+,+) to a Kleinian signature (-,+,+,-). A formal analogy with\nthe propagation of electrons at a junction between an anisotropic semiconductor\nand an electronic metamaterial is presented. From that analogy, we study the\ndynamics of these particles falling onto planar boundary interfaces between\nthese two families of media and show a mirror-like behavior for the particle\nflux. Finally, the case of a double junction of finite thickness is examined\nand the possibility of tunneling through it is discussed. A physical link\nbetween the metamaterial and the Kleinian slabs is found by calculating the\ntime of flight of the respective traversing particles.\n", "  We discuss an algebraic treatment of four-body clusters which includes both\ncontinuous and discrete symmetries. In particular, tetrahedral configurations\nwith T(d) symmetry are analyzed with respect to the energy spectrum, transition\nform factors and B(EL) values. It is concluded that the low-lying spectrum of\n16O can be described by four alpha-particles at the vertices of a regular\ntetrahedron, not as a rigid structure but rather a more floppy structure with\nrelatively large rotation-vibration interactions and Coriolis forces.\n", "  The algebraic cluster model is is applied to study cluster states in the\nnuclei 12C and 16O. The observed level sequences can be understood in terms of\nthe underlying discrete symmetry that characterizes the geometrical\nconfiguration of the alpha-particles, i.e. an equilateral triangle for 12C, and\na regular tetrahedron for 16O. The structure of rotational bands provides a\nfingerprint of the underlying geometrical configuration of alpha-particles.\n", "  This is the centenary year of general relativity, it is therefore natural to\nreflect on what perspective we have evolved in 100 years. I wish to share here\na novel perspective, and the insights and directions that ensue from it.\n", "  This work studies the interplay between Green functions, the index of\ndeterminacy of spectral measures and interior finite rank perturbations of\nJacobi operators. The index of determinacy quantifies the stability of\nuniqueness of solutions of the moment problem. We give results on the constancy\nof this index in terms of perturbations of the corresponding Jacobi operators.\nThe permanence of the $N$-extremality of a measure is also studied. A measure\n$\\mu$ is $N$-extremal when the polynomials are dense in $L_2(\\mathbb{R},\\mu)$.\nAs a by-product, we give a characterization of the index in terms of cyclic\nvectors. We consider a new inverse problem for Jacobi operators in which\ninformation on the place where the interior perturbation occurs is obtained\nfrom the index of determinacy.\n", "  Using data from the HiggsHunters.org project we investigate the ability of\nnon-expert citizen scientists to identify long-lived particles, and other\nunusual features, in images of LHC collisions recorded by the ATLAS experiment.\nMore than 32,000 volunteers from 179 countries participated, classifying\n1,200,000 features of interest on about 39,000 distinct images. We find that\nthe non-expert volunteers are capable of identifying the decays of long-lived\nparticles with an efficiency and fake-rate comparable to that of the ATLAS\nalgorithms. Volunteers also picked out events with unexpected features,\nincluding what appeared to be an event containing a jet of muons.\n", "  We introduce a simple two-player test which certifies that the players apply\ntensor products of Pauli $\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Z$ observables on the tensor\nproduct of $n$ EPR pairs. The test has constant robustness: any strategy\nachieving success probability within an additive $\\varepsilon$ of the optimal\nmust be $\\mathrm{poly}(\\varepsilon)$-close, in the appropriate distance\nmeasure, to the honest $n$-qubit strategy. The test involves $2n$-bit questions\nand $2$-bit answers. The key technical ingredient is a quantum version of the\nclassical linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld.\n  As applications of our result we give (i) the first robust self-test for $n$\nEPR pairs; (ii) a quantum multiprover interactive proof system for the local\nHamiltonian problem with a constant number of provers and classical questions\nand answers, and a constant completeness-soundness gap independent of system\nsize; (iii) a robust protocol for delegated quantum computation.\n", "  This manuscript is in progress and the first version was removed by decision\nof the autors.\n", "  Intensity mapping of the HI brightness temperature provides a unique way of\ntracing large-scale structures of the Universe up to the largest possible\nscales. This is achieved by using a low angular resolution radio telescopes to\ndetect emission line from cosmic neutral Hydrogen in the post-reionization\nUniverse. We use general relativistic perturbation theory techniques to derive\nfor the first time the full expression for the HI brightness temperature up to\nthird order in perturbation theory without making any plane-parallel\napproximation. We use this result and the renormalization prescription for\nbiased tracers to study the impact of nonlinear effects on the power spectrum\nof HI brightness temperature both in real and redshift space. We show how mode\ncoupling at nonlinear order due to nonlinear bias parameters and redshift space\ndistortion terms modulate the power spectrum on large scales. The large scale\nmodulation may be understood to be due to the effective bias parameter and\neffective shot noise.\n", "  We introduce a set of Bell inequalities for a three-qubit system. Each\ninequality within this set is violated by all generalized GHZ states. More\nentangled a generalized GHZ state is, more will be the violation. This\nestablishes a relation between nonlocality and entanglement for this class of\nstates. Certain inequalities within this set are violated by pure biseparable\nstates. We also provide numerical evidence that at least one of these Bell\ninequalities is violated by a pure genuinely entangled state. These Bell\ninequalities can distinguish between separable, biseparable and genuinely\nentangled pure three-qubit states. We also generalize this set to n-qubit\nsystems and may be suitable to characterize the entanglement of n-qubit pure\nstates.\n", "  We perform the first tests of various proposed explanations for observed\nfeatures of the Moon's argon exosphere, including models of: spatially varying\nsurface interactions; a source that reflects the lunar near-surface potassium\ndistribution; and temporally varying cold trap areas. Measurements from the\nLunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) and the Lunar Atmosphere\nComposition Experiment (LACE) are used to test whether these models can\nreproduce the data. The spatially varying surface interactions hypothesized in\nprevious work cannot reproduce the persistent argon enhancement observed over\nthe western maria. They also fail to match the observed local time of the\nnear-sunrise peak in argon density, which is the same for the highland and mare\nregions, and is well reproduced by simple surface interactions with a\nubiquitous desorption energy of 28 kJ/mol. A localised source can explain the\nobservations, with a trade-off between an unexpectedly localised source or an\nunexpectedly brief lifetime of argon atoms in the exosphere. To match the\nobservations, a point-like source requires source and loss rates of\n~$1.9\\times10^{21}$ atoms/s. A more diffuse source, weighted by the\nnear-surface potassium, requires much higher rates of ~$1.1\\times10^{22}$\natoms/s, corresponding to a mean lifetime of just 1.4 lunar days. We do not\naddress the mechanism for producing a localised source, but demonstrate that\nthis appears to be the only model that can reproduce the observations. Large,\nseasonally varying cold traps could explain the long-term fluctuation in the\nglobal argon density observed by LADEE, but not that by LACE.\n", "  We write the spectral zeta function of the Laplace operator on an equilateral\nmetric graph in terms of the spectral zeta function of the normalized Laplace\noperator on the corresponding discrete graph. To do this, we apply a relation\nbetween the spectrum of the Laplacian on a discrete graph and that of the\nLaplacian on an equilateral metric graph. As a by-product, we determine how the\nmultiplicity of eigenvalues of the quantum graph, that are also in the spectrum\nof the graph with Dirichlet conditions at the vertices, depends on the graph\ngeometry. Finally we apply the result to calculate the vacuum energy and\nspectral determinant of a complete bipartite graph and compare our results with\nthose for a star graph, a graph in which all vertices are connected to a\ncentral vertex by a single edge.\n", "  When a graphene layer is stressed, the strain alters the phase an electron\naccumulates hopping between sites in a way that can be modeled as arising from\na pseudo-magnetic vector potential. We examine the case of an oscillating\ngraphene ribbon and explore a new effect - an oscillating resistance arising\nfrom an oscillating quantum Hall effect. This pseudo-magneto-resistance is\nlarge, and depends upon the frequency and the amplitude of the acoustic\noscillations. We calculate the consequences for experiment.\n", "  We confirm the equivalence of the Schr\\\"odinger representation and the\nholomorphic one, based on previous results of the General Boundary Formulation\n(GBF) of quantum field theory. On a wide class of curved spacetimes, we\nconsider real Klein-Gordon theory in two types of regions: interval regions\n(consisting e.g. of a time interval times all of space), and rod regions (a\nsolid ball of space extended over all of time). Using mode expansions, we\nprovide explicit expressions for the Schr\\\"odinger vacuum (which determines\nthis representation) and for the corresponding complex structure on the space\nof classical solutions (which determines the holomorphic representation). For\nboth representations we give the corresponding coherent states and calculate\nthe generalized free transition amplitudes of the GBF, which coincide and hence\nconfirm the equivalence of the two representations. We also transcribe the\ncomplex structure to phase space and show that it agrees with earlier results.\n", "  Multiple Electrostatic Quadrupole Array Linear Accelerators (MEQALACs)\nprovide an opportunity to realize compact radio-frequency (RF) accelerator\nstructures that can deliver very high beam currents. MEQALACs have been\npreviously realized with acceleration gap distances and beam aperture sizes of\nthe order of centimeters. Through advances in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems\n(MEMS) fabrication, MEQALACs can now be scaled down to the sub-millimeter\nregime and batch processed on wafer substrates. In this paper, we show first\nresults from using three RF stages in a compact MEMS-based ion accelerator. The\nresults presented show proof-of-concept with accelerator structures formed from\nprinted circuit boards using a 3x3 beamlet arrangement and noble gas ions at 10\nkeV. We present a simple model to describe the measured results. The model is\nthen used to examine some of the aspects of this approach, such as possible\neffects of alignment errors. We also discuss some of the scaling behaviour of a\ncompact MEQALAC. The MEMS-based approach enables a low-cost, highly versatile\naccelerator covering a wide range of beam energies and currents. Applications\ninclude ion-beam analysis, mass spectrometry, materials processing, and at very\nhigh beam powers, plasma heating.\n", "  We propose and analyze a protocol to generate two dimensional tensor network\nstates using a single quantum system that sequentially interacts with a 1D\nstring of qubits. This is accomplished by using parts of the string itself as a\nquantum queue memory. As a physical implementation, we consider a single atom\nor atom like system coupled to a 1D waveguide with a distant mirror, where\nguided photons represent the qubits while the mirror allows the implementation\nof the queue memory. We identify the class of many-body quantum states that can\nbe produced using this approach. These include universal resources for\nmeasurement based quantum computation and states associated with topologically\nordered phases. We discuss an explicit protocol to deterministically create a\n2D cluster state in a quantum nanophotonic experiment, that allows for a\nrealization of a quantum computer using a single atom coupled to light.\n", "  Left-right symmetric gauge theory presents a minimal paradigm to accommodate\nmassive neutrinos with all known conserved symmetries duly gauged. The work\npresented here is based on the argument that the see-saw mechanism does not\nforce the new right handed symmetry scale to be very high, and as such some of\nthe species from the spectrum of the new gauge and Higgs bosons can have masses\nwithin a few orders of magnitude of the TeV scale. The scale of the left-right\nparity breaking in turn can be sequestered from the Planck scale by\nsupersymmetry. We have studied several formulations of such Just Beyond\nStandard Model (JBSM) theories for their consistency with cosmology.\nSpecifically the need to eliminate phenomenologically undesirable domain walls\ngives many useful clues. The possibility that the exact left-right symmetry\nbreaks in conjunction with supersymmetry has been explored in the context of\ngauge mediation, placing restrictions on the available parameter space. Finally\nwe have also studied a left-right symmetric model in the context of metastable\nsupersymmetric vacua and obtained constraints on the mass scale of Right handed\nsymmetry. In all the cases studied, The mass scale of right handed neutrino\n$M_R$ remains bounded from above, and in some of the cases the scale $10^9$ GeV\nfavourable for supersymmetric thermal leptogenesis is disallowed. On the other\nhand PeV scale remains a viable option, and the results warrant a more detailed\nstudy of such models for their observability in collider and astroparticle\nexperiments.\n", "  The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in two-dimensional electron system\n(2DES) is an exotic, superfluid-like matter with an emergent topological order.\nFrom the consideration of Aharonov-Bohm interaction of electrons and magnetic\nfield, the ground state of a half-filled lowest Landau level is mathematically\ntransformed to a Fermi sea of composite objects of electrons bound to two flux\nquanta, termed composite fermions (CFs). A strong support for the CF theories\ncomes from experimental confirmation of the predicted Fermi surface at $\\nu$ =\n1/2 (where $\\nu$ is the Landau level filling factor) from the detection of the\nFermi wave vector in the semi-classical geometrical resonance experiments.\nRecent developments in the theory of CFs have led to a prediction of a $\\pi$\nBerry phase for the CF circling around the Fermi surface at half-filling. In\nthis paper we provide the first experimental evidence for the detection of the\nBerry phase of CFs in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Our measurements of\nthe Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of CFs as a function carrier density at a\nfixed magnetic field provide a strong support for an existence of a $\\pi$ Berry\nphase at $\\nu$ = 1/2. We also discover that the conductivity of composite\nfermions at $\\nu$ = 1/2 displays an anomalous linear density dependence, whose\norigin remains mysterious yet tantalizing.\n", "  The description of quantized collective excitations stands as a landmark in\nthe quantum theory of condensed matter. A prominent example occurs in\nconventional magnets, which support bosonic magnons - quantized harmonic\nfluctuations of the ordered spins. In striking contrast is the recent discovery\nthat strongly spin-orbital coupled magnets, such as $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, may\ndisplay a broad excitation continuum inconsistent with conventional magnons.\nDue to incomplete knowledge of the underlying interactions unraveling the\nnature of this continuum remains challenging. The most discussed explanation\nrefers to a coherent continuum of fractional excitations analogous to the\ncelebrated Kitaev spin liquid. Here we present a more general scenario. We\npropose that the observed continuum represents incoherent excitations\noriginating from strong magnetic anharmoniticity that naturally occurs in such\nmaterials. This scenario fully explains the observed inelastic magnetic\nresponse of $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and reveals the presence of nontrivial\nexcitations in such materials extending well beyond the Kitaev state.\n", "  We propose a new type of supersymmetric Twin Higgs model where the SU(4)\ninvariant quartic term is provided by a D-term potential of a new U(1) gauge\nsymmetry. In the model the 125 GeV Higgs mass can be obtained for stop masses\nbelow 1 TeV, and a tuning required to obtain the correct electroweak scale can\nbe as low as 20 %. A stop mass of about 2 TeV is also possible with tuning of\norder O(10) %.\n", "  We report the detection of a largely ionized very-high velocity cloud (VHVC;\n$v_{\\rm LSR}\\sim-350$ km/s) toward M33 with the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic\nOrigin Spectrograph. The VHVC is detected in OI, CII, SiII, and SiIII\nabsorption along five sightlines separated by ~0.06-0.4 degree. On sub-degree\nscales, the velocities and ionic column densities of the VHVC remain relatively\nsmooth with standard deviations of +/-14 km/s and +/-0.15 dex between the\nsightlines, respectively. The VHVC has a metallicity of [OI/HI]=-0.56+/-0.17\ndex (Z=0.28+/-0.11 Z$_{\\odot}$). Despite the position-velocity proximity of the\nVHVC to the ionized Magellanic Stream, the VHVC's higher metallicity makes it\nunlikely to be associated with the Stream, highlighting the complex velocity\nstructure of this region of sky. We investigate the VHVC's possible origin by\nrevisiting its surrounding HI environment. We find that the VHVC may be: (1) a\nMW CGM cloud, (2) related to a nearby HI VHVC -- Wright's Cloud, or (3)\nconnected to M33's northern warp. Furthermore, the VHVC could be a bridge\nconnecting Wright's Cloud and M33's northern warp, which would make it a\nMagellanic-like structure in the halo of M33.\n", "  We develop the full counting statistics of dissipated heat to explore the\nrelation with Landauer's principle. Combining the two-time measurement protocol\nfor the reconstruction of the statistics of heat with the minimal set of\nassumptions for Landauer's principle to hold, we derive a general one-parameter\nfamily of upper and lower bounds on the mean dissipated heat from a system to\nits environment. Furthermore, we establish a connection with the degree of\nnon-unitality of the system's dynamics and show that, if a large deviation\nfunction exists as stationary limit of the above cumulant generating function,\nthen our family of lower and upper bounds can be used to witness and understand\nfirst-order dynamical phase transitions. For the purpose of demonstration, we\napply these bounds to an externally pumped three level system coupled to a\nfinite sized thermal environment.\n", "  As an effective model corresponding to $Z_3$-symmetric QCD ($Z_3$-QCD), we\nconstruct a $Z_3$-symmetric effective Polyakov-line model ($Z_3$-EPLM) by using\nthe logarithmic fermion effective action. Since $Z_3$-QCD tends to QCD in the\nzero temperature limit, $Z_3$-EPLM also agrees with the ordinary effective\nPolyakov-line model (EPLM) there; note that ordinary EPLM does not possess\n$Z_3$ symmetry. Our main purpose is to discuss a sign problem appearing in\n$Z_3$-EPLM. The action of $Z_3$-EPLM is real, when the Polyakov line is not\nonly real but also its $Z_3$ images. This suggests that the sign problem\nbecomes milder in $Z_3$-EPLM than in EPLM. In order to confirm this suggestion,\nwe do lattice simulations for both EPLM and $Z_3$-EPLM by using the reweighting\nmethod with the phase quenched approximation. In the low-temperature region,\nthe sign problem is milder in $Z_3$-EPLM than in EPLM. We also propose a new\nreweighting method. This makes the sign problem very weak in $Z_3$-EPLM.\n", "  We extract the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{cb}$ from the\nexclusive decays of $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda_c\\ell\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ and $\\Lambda_b\\to\n\\Lambda_c M_{(c)}$ with $M=(\\pi^-,K^-)$ and $M_c=(D^-,D^-_s)$, where the\nbranching ratios of $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda M_{(c)}$ measured with high\nprecisions have not been used in the previous studies. Explicitly, we find\n$|V_{cb}|=(44.0\\pm 3.5)\\times 10^{-3}$, which agrees with the value of\n$(42.11\\pm 0.74)\\times 10^{-3}$ from the inclusive $B\\to X_c\\ell\\bar \\nu_\\ell$\ndecays. Furthermore, based on the most recent ratio of $|V_{ub}|/|V_{cb}|$ from\nthe exclusive $\\Lambda_b$ decays, we obtain $|V_{ub}|=(4.2\\pm 0.4)\\times\n10^{-3}$, which is close to the value of $(4.49\\pm 0.24)\\times 10^{-3}$ from\nthe inclusive $B\\to X_u\\ell\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ decays. We conclude that our\ndeterminations of $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ from the exclusive $\\Lambda_b$\ndecays favor the inclusive extractions in the $B$ decays.\n", "  A novel generalization of the Askey-Wilson algebra is presented and shown to\nbe associated with coproducts in the quantum algebra $U_q(su(1,1))$. This\nalgebra has 15 non-commuting generators given by $Q^{(A)}$, with $A\\subset\n\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and their 5 linearly independent inversions generated by the\nalgebra automorphism $q\\rightarrow q^{-1}$, $E\\leftrightarrow F.$ The set of\ngenerators can be split into operators fixed under inversion, and those with an\norientation under this inversion. We then show that the generators will either\ncommute or satisfy q-commutator relations linear in the generators, with the\nrestriction that parity operators commute with generators of opposite parity\nand the q-commutation relations are between those with the same parity.\nFinally, we give a novel algebra expression satisfied by the generators\ninvolving only the natural generators, i.e. those arising from the coupling\nscheme.\n", "  Kinetic plasma turbulence cascade spans multiple scales ranging from\nmacroscopic fluid flow to sub-electron scales. Mechanisms that dissipate large\nscale energy, terminate the inertial range cascade and convert kinetic energy\ninto heat are hotly debated. Here we revisit these puzzles using fully kinetic\nsimulation. By performing scale-dependent spatial filtering on the Vlasov\nequation, we extract information at prescribed scales and introduce several\nenergy transfer functions. This approach allows highly inhomogeneous energy\ncascade to be quantified as it proceeds down to kinetic scales. The pressure\nwork, $-\\left( \\boldsymbol{P} \\cdot \\nabla \\right) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}$, can\ntrigger a channel of the energy conversion between fluid flow and random\nmotions, which is a collision-free generalization of the viscous dissipation in\ncollisional fluid. Both the energy transfer and the pressure work are strongly\ncorrelated with velocity gradients.\n", "  The relationship between international trade and foreign direct investment\n(FDI) is one of the main features of globalization. In this paper we\ninvestigate the effects of FDI on trade from a network perspective, since FDI\ntakes not only direct but also indirect channels from origin to destination\ncountries because of firms' incentive to reduce tax burden, to minimize\ncoordination costs, and to break barriers to market entry. We use a unique data\nset of international corporate control as a measure of stock FDI to construct a\ncorporate control network (CCN) where the nodes are the countries and the edges\nare the corporate control relationships. Based on the CCN, the network\nmeasures, i.e., the shortest path length and the communicability, are computed\nto capture the indirect channel of FDI. Empirically we find that corporate\ncontrol has a positive effect on trade both directly and indirectly. The result\nis robust with different specifications and estimation strategies. Hence, our\npaper provides strong empirical evidence of the indirect effects of FDI on\ntrade. Moreover, we identify a number of interplaying factors such as regional\ntrade agreements and the region of Asia. We also find that the indirect effects\nare more pronounced for manufacturing sectors than for primary sectors such as\noil extraction and agriculture.\n", "  In this paper we establish the accuracy and robustness of a fast estimator\nfor the bispectrum - the \"FFT bispectrum estimator\". The implementation of the\nestimator presented here offers speed and simplicity benefits over a direct\nsampling approach. We also generalise the derivation so it may be easily be\napplied to any order polyspectra, such as the trispectrum, with the cost of\nonly a handful of FFTs. All lower order statistics can also be calculated\nsimultaneously for little extra cost. To test the estimator we make use of a\nnon-linear density field, and for a more strongly non-Gaussian test case we use\na toy-model of reionization in which ionized bubbles at a given redshift are\nall of equal size and are randomly distributed. Our tests find that the FFT\nestimator remains accurate over a wide range of k, and so should be extremely\nuseful for analysis of 21-cm observations. The speed of the FFT bispectrum\nestimator makes it suitable for sampling applications, such as Bayesian\ninference. The algorithm we describe should prove valuable in the analysis of\nsimulations and observations, and whilst we apply it within the field of\ncosmology, this estimator is useful in any field that deals with non-Gaussian\ndata.\n", "  A fundamental quantity in multiple scattering is the transport mean free path\nthe inverse of which describes the scattering strength of a sample. In this\npaper, we emphasize the importance of an appropriate description of the\neffective refractive index $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in multiple light scattering to\naccurately describe the light transport in dense photonic glasses. Using\n$n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ as calculated by the energy-density coherent potential\napproximation we are able to predict the transport mean free path of\nmonodisperse photonic glasses. This model without any fit parameter is in\nqualitative agreement with numerical simulations and in fair quantitative\nagreement with spectrally resolved coherent backscattering measurements on new\nspecially synthesized polystyrene photonic glasses. These materials exhibit\nresonant light scattering perturbed by strong near-field coupling, all captured\nwithin the model. Our model might be used to maximize the scattering strength\nof high index photonic glasses, which are a key in the search for Anderson\nlocalization of light in three dimensions.\n", "  In many observed galaxy clusters, jets launched by the accretion process on\nto supermassive black holes, inflate large-scale cavities filled with\nenergetic, relativistic plasma. This process is thought to be responsible for\nregulating cooling losses, thus moderating the inflow of gas on to the central\ngalaxy, quenching further star formation and maintaining the galaxy in a red\nand dead state. In this paper, we implement a new jet feedback scheme into the\nmoving mesh-code arepo, contrast different jet injection techniques and\ndemonstrate the validity of our implementation by comparing against simple\nanalytical models. We find that jets can significantly affect the intracluster\nmedium (ICM), offset the overcooling through a number of heating mechanisms, as\nwell as drive turbulence, albeit within the jet lobes only. Jet-driven\nturbulence is, however, a largely ineffective heating source and is unlikely to\ndominate the ICM heating budget even if the jet lobes efficiently fill the\ncooling region, as it contains at most only a few per cent of the total\ninjected energy. We instead show that the ICM gas motions, generated by\norbiting substructures, while inefficient at heating the ICM, drive large-scale\nturbulence and when combined with jet feedback, result in line-of-sight\nvelocities and velocity dispersions consistent with the Hitomi observations of\nthe Perseus cluster.\n", "  We analyze the disorder-perturbed transport of quantum states in the absence\nof backscattering. This comprises, for instance, the propagation of edge-mode\nwave packets in topological insulators, or the propagation of photons in\ninhomogeneous media. We quantify the disorder-induced dephasing, which we show\nto be bound. Moreover, we identify a gap condition to remain in the\nbackscattering-free regime despite disorder-induced momentum broadening. Our\nanalysis comprises the full disorder-averaged quantum state, on the level of\nboth populations and coherences, appreciating states as potential carriers of\nquantum information. The well-definedness of states is guaranteed by our\ntreatment of the nonequilibrium dynamics with Lindblad master equations.\n", "  Implementing nonlinear interactions between single photons and single atoms\nis at the forefront of optical physics. Motivated by the prospects of\ndeterministic all-optical quantum logic, many efforts are currently underway to\nfind suitable experimental techniques. Focusing the incident photons onto the\natom with a lens yielded promising results, but is limited by diffraction to\nmoderate interaction strengths. However, techniques to exceed the diffraction\nlimit are known from high-resolution imaging. In this work, we adapt a\nsuper-resolution imaging technique, 4Pi microscopy, to efficiently couple light\nto a single atom. We observe 36.6(3)% extinction of the incident field, and a\nmodified photon statistics of the transmitted field -- indicating nonlinear\ninteraction at the single-photon level.\n", "  I develop an extension of the usual three-flavor quark model to four flavors\n(u, d, s and c), and discuss the classification of pentaquark states with\nhidden charm. This work is motivated by the recent observation of such states\nby the LHCb Collatoration at CERN.\n", "  The observation of micron size spin relaxation makes graphene a promising\nmaterial for applications in spintronics requiring long distance spin\ncommunication. However, spin dependent scatterings at the contact/graphene\ninterfaces affect the spin injection efficiencies and hence prevent the\nmaterial from achieving its full potential. While this major issue could be\neliminated by nondestructive direct optical spin injection schemes, graphenes\nintrinsically low spin orbit coupling strength and optical absorption place an\nobstacle in their realization. We overcome this challenge by creating sharp\nartificial interfaces between graphene and WSe2 monolayers. Application of a\ncircularly polarized light activates the spin polarized charge carriers in the\nWSe2 layer due to its spin coupled valley selective absorption. These carriers\ndiffuse into the superjacent graphene layer, transport over a 3.5 um distance,\nand are finally detected electrically using BN/Co contacts in a non local\ngeometry. Polarization dependent measurements confirm the spin origin of the\nnon local signal.\n", "  We apply a halo-based group finder to four large redshift surveys, the 2MRS,\n6dFGS, SDSS and 2dFGRS, to construct group catalogs in the low-redshift\nUniverse. The group finder is based on that of Yang et al. but with an improved\nhalo mass assignment so that it can be applied uniformly to various redshift\nsurveys of galaxies. Halo masses are assigned to groups according to proxies\nbased on the stellar mass/luminosity of member galaxies. The performances of\nthe group finder in grouping galaxies according to common halos and in halo\nmass assignments are tested using realistic mock samples constructed from\nhydrodynamical simulations and empirical models of galaxy occupation in dark\nmatter halos. Our group finder finds $\\sim 94\\%$ of the correct true member\ngalaxies for $90-95\\%$ of the groups in the mock samples; the halo masses\nassigned by the group finder are un-biased with respect to the true halo\nmasses, and have a typical uncertainty of $\\sim0.2\\,{\\rm dex}$. The properties\nof group catalogs constructed from the observational samples are described and\ncompared with other similar catalogs in the literature.\n", "  We generalize the operational quasiprobability involving sequential\nmeasurements proposed by Ryu {\\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 88}, 052123] to a\ncontinuous-variable system. The quasiprobabilities in quantum optics are\nincommensurate, i.e., they represent a given physical observation in different\nmathematical forms from their classical counterparts, making it difficult to\noperationally interpret their negative values. Our operational quasiprobability\nis {\\em commensurate}, enabling one to compare quantum and classical statistics\non the same footing. We show that the operational quasiprobability can be\nnegative against the hypothesis of macrorealism for various states of light.\nQuadrature variables of light are our examples of continuous variables. We also\ncompare our approach to the Glauber-Sudarshan $\\mathcal{P}$ function. In\naddition, we suggest an experimental scheme to sequentially measure the\nquadrature variables of light.\n", "  In this paper, phase transition of AdS black holes in lorentz breaking\nmassive gravity has been studied in the framework of holography. We find that\nthere is a first order phase transition(FPT) and second order phase\ntransition(SPT) both in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy(BHE)-temperature plane and\nholographic entanglement entropy(HEE)-temperature plane. Furthermore, for the\nFPT, the equal area law is checked and for the SPT, the critical exponent of\nthe heat capacity is also computed. Our results confirm that the phase\nstructure of HEE is similar to that of BHE in lorentz breaking massive gravity,\nwhich implies that HEE and BHE have some potential underlying relationship.\n", "  Recent work has studied the interplay between a galaxy's history and its\nobservable properties using \"genetically modified\" cosmological zoom\nsimulations. The approach systematically generates alternative histories for a\nhalo, while keeping its cosmological environment fixed. Applications to date\naltered linear properties of the initial conditions such as the mean\noverdensity of specified regions; we extend the formulation to include\nquadratic features such as local variance, which determines the overall\nimportance of smooth accretion relative to mergers in a galaxy's history. We\nintroduce an efficient algorithm for this new class of modification and\ndemonstrate its ability to control the variance of a region in a\none-dimensional toy model. Outcomes of this work are two-fold: (i) a\nclarification of the formulation of genetic modifications and (ii) a proof of\nconcept for quadratic modifications leading the way to a forthcoming\nimplementation in cosmological simulations.\n", "  We compute the effects of magnon-phonon coupling on the indirect K-edge\nbimagnon resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) intensity spectrum of a\nsquare lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We analyze the effects of competing\nnearest and next--nearest magnetic and magnon-phonon coupling interaction in\nthe RIXS spectrum, for both the antiferromagnetic (AF) and the collinear\nantiferromagnetic (CAF) phases of the model. Utilizing the Dyson-Maleev\nrepresentation of spin operators, the Bethe-Salpeter ladder approximation\nscheme for the bimagnon interacting channel, and considering the lowest order\nmagnon-phonon-magnon scattering interaction we highlight distinct features in\nthe X-ray spectrum. Considering damping effects, arising due to the presence of\nphonons, we find that in the AF phase the RIXS intensity spectrum attains a\nmaximum value primarily localized around the K $\\left(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pm\n\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ - point. For the CAF phase the intensity is broadly\ndistributed with a significant scattering intensity located around the Y\n$\\left(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0\\right)$ - point. Furthermore, in the CAF phase for\nsuitable anisotropy, nearest-, and next-nearest neighbor interaction parameters\nthe phonon effects can manifest itself as a distinct peak both below and above\nthe bimagnon peak. Such a feature is in contrast to the antiferromagnetic\nspectrum where the effect due to the phonon peak was located consistently\nbeyond the bimagnon peak in the high energy end of the spectrum. Additionally,\nin the CAF phase we find the RIXS bimagnon-phonon spectrum to be more sensitive\nto anisotropy compared to its antiferromagnetic counterpart. We conclude that\nthe ultimate effect of magnon-phonon effects in the indirect K-edge RIXS\nspectrum, in both the antiferromagnetic and the collinear antiferromagnetic\nphase, is an observable effect.\n", "  We present and apply a general-purpose, multi-start algorithm for improving\nthe performance of low-energy samplers used for solving optimization problems.\nThe algorithm iteratively fixes the value of a large portion of the variables\nto values that have a high probability of being optimal. The resulting problems\nare smaller and less connected, and samplers tend to give better low-energy\nsamples for these problems. The algorithm is trivially parallelizable, since\neach start in the multi-start algorithm is independent, and could be applied to\nany heuristic solver that can be run multiple times to give a sample. We\npresent results for several classes of hard problems solved using simulated\nannealing, path-integral quantum Monte Carlo, parallel tempering with\nisoenergetic cluster moves, and a quantum annealer, and show that the success\nmetrics as well as the scaling are improved substantially. When combined with\nthis algorithm, the quantum annealer's scaling was substantially improved for\nnative Chimera graph problems. In addition, with this algorithm the scaling of\nthe time to solution of the quantum annealer is comparable to the Hamze--de\nFreitas--Selby algorithm on the weak-strong cluster problems introduced by\nBoixo et al. Parallel tempering with isoenergetic cluster moves was able to\nconsistently solve 3D spin glass problems with 8000 variables when combined\nwith our method, whereas without our method it could not solve any.\n", "  We review the dimensional reduction procedure in the group cohomology\nclassification of bosonic SPT phases with finite abelian unitary symmetry\ngroup. We then extend this to include general reductions of arbitrary\ndimensions and also extend the procedure to fermionic SPT phases described by\nthe Gu-Wen super-cohomology model. We then show that we can define topological\ninvariants as partition functions on certain closed orientable/spin manifolds\nequipped with a flat connection. The invariants are able to distinguish all\nphases described within the respective models. Finally, we establish a\nconnection to invariants obtained from braiding statistics of the corresponding\ngauged theories.\n", "  We study the $\\pm J$ transverse-field Ising spin glass model at zero\ntemperature on d-dimensional hypercubic lattices and in the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, by series expansions around the strong\nfield limit. In the SK model and in high-dimensions our calculated critical\nproperties are in excellent agreement with the exact mean-field results,\nsurprisingly even down to dimension $d = 6$ which is below the upper critical\ndimension of $d=8$. In contrast, in lower dimensions we find a rich singular\nbehavior consisting of critical and Griffiths-McCoy singularities. The\ndivergence of the equal-time structure factor allows us to locate the critical\ncoupling where the correlation length diverges, implying the onset of a\nthermodynamic phase transition. We find that the spin-glass susceptibility as\nwell as various power-moments of the local susceptibility become singular in\nthe paramagnetic phase $\\textit{before}$ the critical point. Griffiths-McCoy\nsingularities are very strong in two-dimensions but decrease rapidly as the\ndimension increases. We present evidence that high enough powers of the local\nsusceptibility may become singular at the pure-system critical point.\n", "  In this work I have studied the effect of disorder and system size in fiber\nbundle model with a certain range of stress redistribution. The strength of the\nbundle as well as the failure abruptness is observed with varying disorder,\nstress release range and system sizes. With a local stress concentration, the\nstrength of the bundle is observed to decrease with system size. The behavior\nof such decrement changes drastically as disorder strength is tuned. At\nmoderate disorder, the critical stress scales with system size in an inverse\nlogarithmic manner. In low disorder, where the brittle response is highly\nexpected, the strength decreases in a scale free manner. With increasing system\nsize and stress release range the model approaches thermodynamic limit and the\nmean field limit respectively. A detail study expresses different limit in the\nmodel and the corresponding modes of failure on the plane of above mentioned\nparameters.\n", "  Diffraction-free optical beams propagate freely without change in shape and\nscale. Monochromatic beams that avoid diffractive spreading require\ntwo-dimensional transverse profiles, and there are no corresponding solutions\nfor profiles restricted to one transverse dimension. Here, we demonstrate that\nthe temporal degree of freedom can be exploited to efficiently synthesize\none-dimensional pulsed optical sheets that propagate self-similarly in free\nspace. By introducing programmable conical (hyperbolic, parabolic, or\nelliptical) spectral correlations between the beam's spatio-temporal degrees of\nfreedom, a continuum of families of axially invariant pulsed localized beams is\ngenerated. The spectral loci of such beams are the reduced-dimensionality\ntrajectories at the intersection of the light-cone with spatio-temporal\nspectral planes. Far from being exceptional, self-similar axial propagation is\na generic feature of fields whose spatial and temporal degrees of freedom are\ntightly correlated. These one-dimensional `space-time' beams can be useful in\noptical sheet microscopy, nonlinear spectroscopy, and non-contact measurements.\n", "  We derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a class of BPS black holes in\nthe massive type IIA supergravity background AdS$_4 \\times S^6$ from a\nmicroscopic counting of supersymmetric ground states in a holographically dual\nfield theory. The counting is performed by evaluating the topologically twisted\nindex of three-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories\nin the large $N$ limit. The $\\mathcal{I}$-extremization principle is shown to\nmatch the attractor mechanism for the near-horizon geometries constructed in\nthe four-dimensional dyonic $\\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity, that arises as\na consistent truncation of massive type IIA supergravity on $S^6$. In\nparticular, our results prove that the imaginary part of the three-dimensional\npartition functions plays a crucial r\\^ole in holography.\n", "  Comparison of ISM absorption in the UV spectrum of LS 4825, a B1 Ib-II star\nd=21+/-5 kpc from the Sun toward l = 1.67 deg and b = -6.63 deg, with ISM\nabsorption toward an aligned foreground star at d < 7.0+/-1.7 kpc, allows us to\nisolate and study gas associated with the Milky Way nuclear wind. Spectra from\nthe Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) show low ion absorption out to\nd < 7 kpc ( e.g., O I, C II, Mg II, Si II, Fe II, S II) only between 0 and 40\nkm/s, while absorption at d > 7 kpc, ~1 kpc below the galactic plane, is\ncomplex and spans -290 to + 94 km/ s. The intermediate and high ions Si III, C\nIV, Si IV and N V show extremely strong absorption with multiple components\nfrom -283 to 107 km/ s implying that the ISM ~1 kpc below the galactic center\nhas a substantial reservoir of plasma, and more gas containing C IV and N V\nthan in the Carina OB1 association at z = 0 kpc. Abundances and physical\nconditions are presented for many absorption components. The high ion\nabsorption traces cooling transition temperature plasma probably driven by the\noutflowing hot gas, while the extraordinary large thermal pressure, p/k ~ 10^5\ncm^-3 K^-1 in an absorption component at -114 km/s probably arises from the ram\npressure of the outflowing hot gas. The observations are consistent with a flow\nwhose ionization structure in the high ions can be understood through a\ncombination of non-equilibrium radiative cooling and turbulent mixing.\n", "  So-called average subsystem entropies are defined by first taking partial\ntraces over some pure state to define density matrices, then calculating the\nsubsystem entropies, and finally averaging over the pure states to define the\naverage subsystem entropies. These quantities are standard tools in quantum\ninformation theory, most typically applied in bipartite systems. We shall first\npresent some extensions to the usual bipartite analysis, (including a\ncalculation of the average tangle, and a bound on the average concurrence),\nfollow this with some useful results for tripartite systems, and finally extend\nthe discussion to arbitrary multi-partite systems. A particularly nice feature\nof tri-partite and multi-partite analyses is that this framework allows one to\nintroduce an \"environment\" for small subsystems to couple to.\n", "  We present Euclidean wormhole solutions describing possible bridges within\nthe multiverse. The study is carried out in the framework of the third\nquantization. The matter content is modelled through a scalar field which\nsupports the existence of a whole collection of universes. The instanton\nsolutions describe Euclidean solutions that connect baby universes with\nasymptotically de Sitter universes. We compute the tunnelling probability of\nthese processes. Considering the current bounds on the energy scale of\ninflation and assuming that all the baby universes are nucleated with the same\nprobability, we draw some conclusions about what are the universes more likely\nto tunnel and therefore undergo a standard inflationary era.\n", "  Matrix Product States (MPS) are a particular type of one dimensional tensor\nnetwork states, that have been applied to the study of numerous quantum many\nbody problems. One of their key features is the possibility to describe and\nencode symmetries on the level of a single building block (tensor), and hence\nthey provide a natural playground for the study of symmetric systems. In\nparticular, recent works have proposed to use MPS (and higher dimensional\ntensor networks) for the study of systems with local symmetry that appear in\nthe context of gauge theories. In this work we classify MPS which exhibit local\ninvariance under arbitrary gauge groups. We study the respective tensors and\ntheir structure, revealing known constructions that follow known gauging\nprocedures, as well as different, other types of possible gauge invariant\nstates.\n", "  We develop and fully characterize a meshfree Lagrangian (particle) model for\ncontinuum-based numerical modeling of dry and submerged granular flows. The\nmultiphase system of the granular material and the ambient fluid is treated as\na multi-density multi-viscosity system in which the viscous behaviour of the\ngranular phase is predicted using a regularized viscoplastic rheological model\nwith a pressure-dependent yield criterion. The numerical technique is based on\nthe Weakly-Compressible Moving Particle Semi-implicit (WC-MPS) method. The\nrequired algorithms for approximation of the effective viscosity, effective\npressure, and shear stress divergence are introduced. The capability of the\nmodel in dealing with the viscoplasticity is validated for the viscoplastic\nPoiseuille flow between parallel plates. The model is then applied and fully\ncharacterized (with respect to the various rheological and numerical\nparameters) for dry and submerged granular collapses with different aspect\nratios. The numerical results are evaluated in comparison with the available\nexperimental measurement in literature as well as some complementary\nexperimental measurements, performed in this study. The results show the\ncapabilities of the presented model and its potential to deal with a broad\nrange of dry and submerged granular flows. It also revealed the impotent role\nof the regularization, effective pressure, and shear stress divergence\ncalculation methods on the accuracy of the results.\n", "  We study theoretically the topological surface states (TSSs) and the possible\nsurface Andreev bound states (SABSs) of Cu$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ which is known\nto be a topological insulator at $x=0$. The superconductivity (SC) pairing of\nthis compound is assumed to have the broken spin-rotation symmetry, similar to\nthat of the A-phase of $^{3}$He as suggested by recent nuclear-magnetic\nresonance experiments. For both spheroidal and corrugated cylindrical Fermi\nsurfaces with the hexagonal warping terms, we show that the bulk SC gap is\nrather anisotropic; the minimum of the gap is negligibly small as comparing to\nthe maximum of the gap. This would make the fully-gapped pairing effectively\nnodal. For a clean system, our results indicate the bulk of this compound to be\na topological superconductor with the SABSs appearing inside the bulk SC gap.\nThe zero-energy SABSs which are Majorana fermions, together with the TSSs not\ngapped by the pairing, produce a zero-energy peak in the surface density of\nstates (SDOS). The SABSs are expected to be stable against short-range\nnonmagnetic impurities, and the local SDOS is calculated around a nonmagnetic\nimpurity. The relevance of our results to experiments is discussed.\n", "  We propose to realize the two-mode continuous-variable entanglement of\nmicrowave photons in an electro-optic system, consisting of two superconducting\nmicrowave resonators and one or two optical cavities filled with certain\nelectro-optic medium. The cascaded and parallel schemes realize such\nentanglement via coherent control on the dynamics of the system, while the\ndissipative dynamical scheme utilizes the reservoir-engineering approach and\nexploits the optical dissipation as a useful resource. We show that, for all\nthe schemes, the amount of entanglement is determined by the ratio of the\neffective coupling strengths of \"beam-splitter\" and \"two-mode squeezing\"\ninteractions, rather than their amplitudes.\n", "  Inspired by classical results in integrable boundary quantum field theory, we\npropose a definition of integrable initial states for quantum quenches in\nlattice models. They are defined as the states which are annihilated by all\nlocal conserved charges that are odd under space reflection. We show that this\nclass includes the states which can be related to integrable boundary\nconditions in an appropriate rotated channel, in loose analogy with the picture\nin quantum field theory. Furthermore, we provide an efficient method to test\nintegrability of given initial states. We revisit the recent literature of\nglobal quenches in several models and show that, in all of the cases where\nclosed-form analytical results could be obtained, the initial state is\nintegrable according to our definition. In the prototypical example of the XXZ\nspin-s chains we show that integrable states include two-site product states\nbut also larger families of matrix product states with arbitrary bond\ndimension. We argue that our results could be practically useful for the study\nof quantum quenches in generic integrable models.\n", "  $\\gamma$ rays are emitted by cosmic sources by non-thermal processes that\nyield either non-polarized photons, such as those from $\\pi^0$ decay in\nhadronic interactions, or linearly polarized photons from synchrotron radiation\nand the inverse-Compton up-shifting of these on high-energy charged particles.\nPolarimetry in the MeV energy range would provide a powerful tool to\ndiscriminate among \"leptonic\" and \"hadronic\" emission models of blazars, for\nexample, but no polarimeter sensitive above 1\\,MeV has ever been flown into\nspace. Low-$Z$ converter telescopes such as silicon detectors are developed to\nimprove the angular resolution and the point-like sensitivity below 100 MeV. We\nhave shown that in the case of a homogeneous, low-density active target such as\na gas time-projection chamber (TPC), the single-track angular resolution is\neven better and is so good that in addition the linear polarimetry of the\nincoming radiation can be performed. We actually characterized the performance\nof a prototype of such a telescope on beam. Track momentum measurement in the\ntracker would enable calorimeter-free, large effective area telescopes on\nlow-mass space missions. An optimal unbiased momentum estimate can be obtained,\nin the tracker alone, based on the momentum dependence of multiple scattering,\nfrom a Bayesian analysis of the innovations of Kalman filters applied to the\ntracks.\n", "  The article deals with the sin-Gordon model and considers the interaction of\nbreathers localized on moving impurities. Numerical simulation of collective\nbehavior of such objects revealed the analogy between the models properties and\nthe properties of Helium-II anomalous flow. The scheme of the experiment was\nproposed to validate the breather model of superfluidity.\n", "  Deterministic evolutionary game dynamics can lead to stable coexistences of\ndifferent types. Stochasticity, however, drives the loss of such coexistences.\nThis extinction is usually accompanied by population size fluctuations. We\ninvestigate the most probable extinction trajectory under such fluctuations by\nmapping a stochastic evolutionary model to a problem of classical mechanics\nusing the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. Our results show that\nmore abundant types in a coexistence can be more likely to go extinct first\nwell agreed with previous results, and also the distance between the\ncoexistence and extinction point is not a good predictor of extinction.\nInstead, the WKB method correctly predicts the type going extinct first.\n", "  We consider the Heisenberg-Euler action for an electromagnetic field in\nvacuum, which includes quantum corrections to the Maxwell equations induced by\nphoton-photon scattering. We show that, in some configurations, the plane\nmonochromatic waves become unstable, due to the appearance of secularities in\nthe dynamical equations. These secularities can be treated using a multiscale\napproach, introducing a slow time variable. The amplitudes of the plane\nelectromagnetic waves satisfy a system of ordinary differential nonlinear\nequations in the slow time. The analysis of this system shows that, due to the\neffect of photon-photon scattering, in the unstable configurations the\nelectromagnetic waves oscillate periodically between left-hand-sided and\nright-hand-sided polarizations. Finally, we discuss the physical implications\nof this finding, and the possibility of disclosing traces of this effect in\noptical experiments.\n", "  We present calculations of the electron angular distributions in the single\nionization of helium by 1-MeV proton impact at momentum transfer of 0.75 a.u.\nand ejected-electron energy of 6.5 eV. The results using the first and second\nBorn approximations and the 3C model with different trial helium functions are\ncompared to the experimental data. A good agreement between theory and\nexperiment is found in the case of the 3C final state and a strongly correlated\nhelium wave function. The electron-electron correlations in the He atom are\nfound to influence the ratio of the binary and recoil peak intensities.\n", "  Stabilization, by deformation, of the Poincar\\'{e}-Heisenberg algebra\nrequires both the introduction of a fundamental lentgh and the noncommutativity\nof translations which is associated to the gravitational field. The\nnoncommutative geometry structure that follows from the deformed algebra is\nstudied both for the non-commutative tangent space and the full space with\ngravity. The contact points of this approach with the work of David Finkelstein\nare emphasized.\n", "  The gravity-wave energy cascade is investigated using the High-Order Spectral\n(HOS) method.\n", "  The mean-field and effective-field approximations are applied in the study of\nmagnetic and thermodynamic properties of a spin-$1/2$ Ising system containing\nthree layers, each of which is composed exclusively of one out of two possible\ntypes of atoms, \\textbf{A} or \\textbf{B}. The \\textbf{A-A} and \\textbf{B-B}\nbonds are ferromagnetic while the \\textbf{A-B} bonds are antiferromagnetic. The\noccurrence of a compensation phenomenon is verified and the compensation and\ncritical temperatures are obtained as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters.\nWe present phase diagrams dividing the parameter space in regions where the\ncompensation phenomenon is present or absent and a detailed discussion about\nthe influence of each parameter on the overall behavior of the system is made.\n", "  Unlike normal fluorescent methods that use the intensity as a direct\nmeasurement of the localized enhanced field, we use blinking statistics of\nquantum dots (QDs). We have already shown that blinking gives a more accurate\ncharacterization of the near-field. When an emitter is situated close to a\nmetallic surface, non-radiative pathways are opened up, leading to quenching of\nthe exciton. Blinking statistics, however, is only minimally affected by\nquenching, and therefore can be used to probe emitters in close proximity to\nmetallic surfaces. We have expanded our method (COFIBINS) to high densities\nusing superresolution technique SOFI. A proof of principle for SOFI-COFIBINS is\ndemonstrated with a defocused point spread function. The method is then applied\nto surface plasmon polaritons. SOFI-COFIBINS shows excellent agreement with the\naverage fluorescence intensity.\n", "  Dark matter(DM) is the only possible candidate which would be apart from the\nthermal equilibrium before Big Bang nucleosynthesis(BBN) in accordance with\ncurrent DM searches. In this work, we report a generic scenario that primordial\nperturbation of dark matter(PPDM) can be, effectively, generated and encoded\nwith primordial information of very early universe up to the reheating era. We\npresent an analytical solution of the whole evolution of PPDM. A novel and\nstrong constraint on the reheating process imposed by primordial gravitational\nwave(PGW) is obtained for the first time. It indicates the ratio of PGW to\nprimordial curvature perturbation(PCP) is not only dependent on the slow-roll\nspectral index but also, strongly, on the decay process of inflaton at\nreheating. For very generic reheating process, our result provides a natural\nexplanation of the paucity of PGW in current observations.\n", "  Minority carrier diffusion lengths in low-doped n-InGaAs using InP/InGaAs\ndouble-heterostructures are reported using a simple electrical technique. The\ncontributions from heavy and light holes are also extracted using this\nmethodology, including minority carrier mobilities and lifetimes. Heavy holes\nare shown to initially dominate the transport due to their higher valence band\ndensity of states, but at large diffusion distances, the light holes begin to\ndominate due to their larger diffusion length. It is found that heavy holes\nhave a diffusion length of 54.5 +/- 0.6 microns for an n-InGaAs doping of 8.4 x\n10^15 cm-3 at room temperature, whereas light holes have a diffusion length in\nexcess of 140 microns. Heavy holes demonstrate a mobility of 692 +/- 63 cm2/Vs\nand a lifetime of 1.7 +/- 0.2 microsec, whereas light holes demonstrate a\nmobility of 6200 +/- 960 cm-2/Vs and a slightly longer lifetime of 2.6 +/- 1.0\nmicrosec. The presented method, which is limited to low injection conditions,\nis capable of accurately resolving minority carrier transport properties.\n", "  This project investigates how to quantitatively measure equity in small\nstudent groups. We follow several student groups to operationalize how\ndiscourse may be equitable or inequitable. The groups came from a two week,\npre-college program that prepares first generation and deaf/hard-of-hearing\nstudents to major in a STEM field. In the program, students focus on improving\ntheir metacognitive skills and cultural preparation for college life within a\ncontext of model building. We use three methods to measure equity. First, we\nlook at speaking time: who talks, when, and to whom. Second, we look to segment\nstudent discourse by analyzing consistency of group speaking time. Third, we\nanalyze group equality over time changes. We analyze these methods to see how\neffective they are at capturing equity in group discourse.\n", "  The search for heavy Higgs bosons is an important step to probe the parameter\nspace of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. In this work, we classify\nall possible decay modes of the supersymmetric heavy Higgs boson using the\nSModelS framework. We work within the phenomenological MSSM and use the ATLAS\npMSSM study as our viable parameter space. We find that for a bino-like and\nhiggsino-like LSP, a significant region of the parameter space results in\nmono-$X$ ($X$ = $h$, $W$, $Z$) final states. For wino-like LSPs, we demonstrate\nthe existence of displaced vertex signatures with a large signal cross section.\nFinally, we argue that by covering the mono-$X$ final states, a large part of\nheavy Higgs decays can be tested at the LHC.\n", "  The theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) encodes the strong interactions\nthat bind quarks and gluons into nucleons and that bind nucleons into nuclei.\nPredictive control of QCD would allow nuclear structure and reactions as well\nas properties of supernovae and neutron stars to be theoretically studied from\nfirst principles. Lattice QCD can represent generic QCD predictions in terms of\nwell-defined path integrals, but the sign and signal-to-noise problems have\nobstructed lattice QCD calculations of large nuclei and nuclear matter in\npractice. This thesis presents a statistical study of lattice QCD correlation\nfunctions, with a particular focus on characterizing the structure of the noise\nassociated with quantum fluctuations. The signal-to-noise problem in baryon\ncorrelation functions is demonstrated to arise from a sign problem associated\nwith Monte Carlo sampling of complex correlation functions. The phases of\ncomplex correlation functions are analyzed in the framework of circular\nstatistics, and the time evolution of the phase is shown to resemble a\nheavy-tailed random walk on the unit circle. Building on these observations, a\nnew technique called phase reweighting is investigated that involves\ncalculations of phase differences over fixed-length time intervals. Phase\nreweighting allows results for hadronic observables to be extracted from\nlarge-time correlation functions with constant signal-to-noise ratios. The\nsignal-to-noise problem re-emerges as the length of the phase-difference\ninterval is increased. Applications of phase reweighting to meson, baryon, and\ntwo-baryon systems are discussed.\n", "  Measurements approaching the ultimate quantum limits of sensitivity are\ncentral in quantum information processing, quantum metrology, and\ncommunication. Quantum measurements to discriminate multiple states at the\nsingle-photon level are essential for optimizing information transfer in\nlow-power optical communications and quantum communications, and can enhance\nthe capabilities of many quantum information protocols. Here, we theoretically\ninvestigate and experimentally demonstrate the discrimination of multiple\ncoherent states of light with sensitivities surpassing the quantum noise limit\n(QNL) at the single-photon level under realistic conditions of loss and noise\nbased on strategies implementing globally-optimized adaptive measurements with\nsingle photon counting and displacement operations. These discrimination\nstrategies can provide realistic advantages to enhance information transfer at\nlow powers, and are compatible with photon number resolving detection, which\nprovides robustness at high powers, thus allowing for surpassing the QNL at\narbitrary input power levels under realistic conditions.\n", "  This work investigates the existing capabilities and limitations in numerical\nmodeling of fracture problems in functionally graded materials (FGMs) by means\nof the well-known finite element code ABAQUS. Quasi-static crack initiation and\ngrowth in planar FGMs is evaluated. Computational results of fracture\nparameters are compared to experimental results and good agreement is obtained.\nThe importance of the numerical fit of the elastic properties in the FE model\nis analyzed in depth by means of a sensitivity study and a novel method is\npresented. Several key computational issues derived from the continuous change\nof the material properties are also addressed and the source code of a user\nsubroutine USDFLD is provided in the Appendix for an effective implementation\nof the property variation. The crack propagation path is calculated through the\nextended finite element method and subsequently compared to available\nexperimental data. Suitability of local fracture criteria to simulate crack\ntrajectories in FGMs is discussed and a new crack propagation criterion is\nsuggested.\n", "  We propose a method for using ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, to\nform an analog model of a scalar field in five dimensional space-time, where\none of the spatial dimensions is compact. In the analog system the extra\ndimension is discrete, and realized using the internal degrees of freedom of\nthe system. In the low energy regime, the Kaluza-Klein tower of masses is\nrecovered, and the effective radius of the compact dimension is identified.\n", "  This article is a detailed introduction to Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference,\nin which two photons interfere on a beamsplitter in a way that depends on the\nphotons' distinguishability. We begin by considering distinguishability in the\npolarization degree of freedom. We then consider spectral distinguishability,\nand show explicitly how to calculate the HOM dip for three interesting cases:\n1) photons with arbitrary spectral distributions, 2) spectrally entangled\nphotons, and 3) spectrally mixed photons.\n", "  A frequency mixer is a nonlinear device that combines electromagnetic waves\nto create waves at new frequencies. Mixers are ubiquitous components in modern\nradio-frequency technology and are widely used in microwave signal processing.\nThe development of versatile frequency mixers for optical frequencies remains\nchallenging: such devices generally rely on weak nonlinear optical processes\nand, thus, must satisfy phase matching conditions. In this work, we utilize a\nGaAs-based dielectric metasurface to demonstrate an optical frequency mixer\nthat concurrently generates eleven new frequencies spanning the ultraviolet to\nnear-infrared (NIR) spectral range. Our approach combines strong intrinsic\nmaterial nonlinearities, enhanced electromagnetic fields, and relaxed\nphase-matching requirements, to allow seven different nonlinear optical\nprocesses to occur simultaneously. Specifically, when pumped by two femtosecond\nNIR pulses, we observe second-, third- and fourth-harmonic generation,\nsum-frequency generation, two-photon absorption induced photoluminescence,\nfour-wave mixing, and six-wave mixing. Such ultracompact optical mixers may\nenable a plethora of applications in biology, chemistry, sensing,\ncommunications and quantum optics.\n", "  We discuss single-diffractive production of dijets. The cross section is\ncalculated for the first time in the $k_t$-factorization approach, neglecting\ntransverse momentum of the pomeron. We use Kimber-Martin-Ryskin unintegrated\nparton (gluon, quark, antiquark) distributions (UPDF) both in the proton as\nwell as in the pomeron or subleading reggeon. The UPDFs are calculated based on\nconventional MMHT2014nlo PDFs in the proton and H1 collaboration diffractive\nPDFs used previously in the analysis of diffractive structure function and\ndijets at HERA. We try to describe the existing data from Tevatron and make\ndetailed predictions for possible LHC measurements.\n", "  This paper focuses on the recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL)\napplying pattern recognition techniques to the data acquired by the\naccelerometer available in the mobile devices. The recognition of ADL is\ncomposed by several stages, including data acquisition, data processing, and\nartificial intelligence methods. The artificial intelligence methods used are\nrelated to pattern recognition, and this study focuses on the use of Artificial\nNeural Networks (ANN). The data processing includes data cleaning, and the\nfeature extraction techniques to define the inputs for the ANN. Due to the low\nprocessing power and memory of the mobile devices, they should be mainly used\nto acquire the data, applying an ANN previously trained for the identification\nof the ADL. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new method\nimplemented with ANN for the identification of a defined set of ADL with a\nreliable accuracy. This paper also presents a comparison of different types of\nANN in order to choose the type for the implementation of the final method.\nResults of this research probes that the best accuracies are achieved with Deep\nLearning techniques with an accuracy higher than 80%.\n", "  The existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Yang-Mills heat equation\nover domains in Euclidean three space was proven in a previous paper for\ninitial data lying in the Sobolev space of order one-half, which is the\ncritical Sobolev index for this equation. In the present paper the stability of\nthese solutions will be established. The variational equation, which is only\nweakly parabolic, and has highly singular coefficients, will be shown to have\nunique strong solutions up to addition of a vertical solution. Initial data\nwill be taken to be in Sobolev class one-half. The proof relies on an\ninfinitesimal version of the ZDS procedure: one solves first an augmented,\nstrictly parabolic version of the variational equation and then adds to the\nsolution a function which is vertical along the original path. Energy\ninequalities and Neumann domination techniques will be used to establish\napriori initial behavior for solutions.\n", "  The detection of the environment where user is located, is of extreme use for\nthe identification of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). ADL can be identified\nby use of the sensors available in many off-the-shelf mobile devices, including\nmagnetic and motion, and the environment can be also identified using acoustic\nsensors. The study presented in this paper is divided in two parts: firstly, we\ndiscuss the recognition of the environment using acoustic sensors (i.e.,\nmicrophone), and secondly, we fuse this information with motion and magnetic\nsensors (i.e., motion and magnetic sensors) for the recognition of standing\nactivities of daily living. The recognition of the environments and the ADL are\nperformed using pattern recognition techniques, in order to develop a system\nthat includes data acquisition, data processing, data fusion, and artificial\nintelligence methods. The artificial intelligence methods explored in this\nstudy are composed by different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN),\ncomparing the different types of ANN and selecting the best methods to\nimplement in the different stages of the system developed. Conclusions point to\nthe use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with normalized data for the\nidentification of ADL with 85.89% of accuracy, the use of Feedforward neural\nnetworks with non-normalized data for the identification of the environments\nwith 86.50% of accuracy, and the use of DNN with normalized data for the\nidentification of standing activities with 100% of accuracy.\n", "  We address the degree of universality of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence\ninduced by multisoliton fission from a harmonic excitation by analysing the\ncase of the semiclassical defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation, which\nmodels nonlinear wave propagation in a variety of physical settings. Using a\nsuitable Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approach to the solution of the associated\nscattering problem we accurately predict, in full analytical way, the number\nand the features (amplitude and velocity) of soliton-like excitations emerging\npost-breaking, as a function of the dispersion smallness parameter. This also\npermits to predict and analyse the near-recurrences, thereby inferring the\nuniversal character of the mechanism originally discovered for the\nKorteweg-deVries equation. We show, however, that important differences exist\nbetween the two models, arising from the different scaling rules obeyed by the\nsoliton velocities.\n", "  Seeing oceans, continents, quasi-static weather, and other surface features\non exoplanets may allow us to detect and characterize life outside the solar\nsystem. The Proxima b planet resides within the stellar habitable zone allowing\nfor liquid water on its surface, and it may be Earth-like. However, even the\nlargest planned telescopes will not be able to resolve its surface features\ndirectly. Here, we demonstrate an inversion technique to image indirectly\nexoplanet surfaces using observed unresolved reflected light variations over\nthe course of the exoplanets orbital and axial rotation: ExoPlanet Surface\nImaging (EPSI). We show that the reflected light curve contains enough\ninformation to detect both longitudinal and latitudinal structures and to map\nexoplanet surface features. We demonstrate this using examples of Solar system\nplanets and moons as well as simulated planets with Earth-like life and\nartificial megastructures. We also describe how it is possible to infer the\nplanet and orbit geometry from light curves. In particular, we show how albedo\nmaps of Proxima b can be successfully reconstructed for tidally locked,\nresonance, and unlocked axial and orbital rotation. Such albedo maps obtained\nin different wavelength passbands can provide \"photographic\" views of distant\nexoplanets. We estimate the signal-to-noise ratio necessary for successful\ninversions and analyse telescope and detector requirements necessary for the\nfirst surface images of Proxima b and other nearby exoplanets.\n", "  We report the observation of a clear single-mode instability threshold in\ncontinuous-wave Fabry-Perot quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). The instability is\ncharacterized by the appearance of sidebands separated by tens of free spectral\nranges (FSR) from the first lasing mode, at a pump current not much higher than\nthe lasing threshold. As the current is increased, higher-order sidebands\nappear that preserve the initial spacing, and the spectra are suggestive of\nharmonically phase-locked waveforms. We present a theory of the instability\nthat applies to all homogeneously broadened standing-wave lasers. The low\ninstability threshold and the large sideband spacing can be explained by the\ncombination of an unclamped, incoherent Lorentzian gain due to the population\ngrating, and a coherent parametric gain caused by temporal population\npulsations that changes the spectral gain line shape. The parametric term\nsuppresses the gain of sidebands whose separation is much smaller than the\nreciprocal gain recovery time, while enhancing the gain of more distant\nsidebands. The large gain recovery frequency of the QCL compared to the FSR is\nessential to observe this parametric effect, which is responsible for the\nmultiple-FSR sideband separation. We predict that by tuning the strength of the\nincoherent gain contribution, for example by engineering the modal overlap\nfactors and the carrier diffusion, both amplitude-modulated (AM) or\nfrequency-modulated emission can be achieved from QCLs. We provide initial\nevidence of an AM waveform emitted by a QCL with highly asymmetric facet\nreflectivities, thereby opening a promising route to ultrashort pulse\ngeneration in the mid-infrared. Together, the experiments and theory clarify a\ndeep connection between parametric oscillation in optically pumped\nmicroresonators and the single-mode instability of lasers, tying together\nliterature from the last 60 years.\n", "  We first give a new proof of the non-linear stability of the\n$(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime as a solution of the Einstein vacuum\nequation. We then show that the metric admits a full asymptotic expansion at\ninfinity, more precisely at the boundary hypersurfaces (corresponding to\nspacelike, null, and timelike infinity) of a suitable compactification of\n$\\mathbb{R}^4$ adapted to the bending of outgoing light cones. We work in a\nwave map/DeTurck gauge closely related to the standard wave coordinate gauge.\nSimilarly to our previous work on the stability of cosmological black holes, we\nconstruct the solution of the non-linear equation using an iteration scheme in\nwhich we solve a linearized equation globally at each step; to fix the geometry\nof null infinity throughout the iteration scheme, we devise a hyperbolic\nformulation of Einstein's equation which ensures constraint damping. The weak\nnull condition of Lindblad and Rodnianski arises naturally as a nilpotent\ncoupling of certain metric components in a linear model operator at null\ninfinity. Furthermore, we relate the Bondi mass to a logarithmic term in the\nexpansion of the metric at null infinity and prove the Bondi mass loss formula.\n", "  Hybrid improper ferroelectricity (HIF) denotes a new class of polar\ninstability by the mixture of two octahedral-distortion modes and can feature\nthe coexistence of abundant head-to-head and tail-to-tail polar domains, of\nwhich the domain walls tend to be charged due to the respective screening\ncharges with an opposite sign. However, no such coexisting carriers are\navailable in the materials. Using group-theoretical, microscopic, and\nspectroscopic analyses, we established the existence of hidden antipolar order\nparameter in model HIF (Ca,Sr)3Ti2O7 by the condensation of a weak, previously\nunnoticed antipolar lattice instability, turning the order-parameter spaces to\nbe multicomponent with the distinct polar-antipolar intertwining and\naccompanied formation of Neel-type twin-like antipolar domain walls (few nm)\nbetween the head-to-head and tail-to-tail domains. The finite-width Neel walls\nand correlated domain topology inherently lift the polar divergences between\nthe domains, casting an emergent exemplification of charged domain-wall\nscreening by an antipolar ingredient. Comparisons to topological defects in\nimproper-ferroelectrics hexagonal manganites were discussed.\n", "  This work aims at reconsidering several interpretations coexisting in the\nrecent literature concerning non-linear susceptibilities in supercooled\nliquids. We present experimental results on glycerol and propylene carbonate\nshowing that the three independent cubic susceptibilities have very similar\nfrequency and temperature dependences, both for their amplitudes and phases.\nThis strongly suggests a unique physical mechanism responsible for the growth\nof these non-linear susceptibilities. We show that the framework proposed by\ntwo of us [BB, Phys. Rev. B 72, 064204 (2005)], where the growth of non-linear\nsusceptibilities is intimately related to the growth of \"glassy domains\",\naccounts for all the salient experimental features. We then review several\ncomplementary and/or alternative models, and show that the notion of\ncooperatively rearranging glassy domains is a key (implicit or explicit)\ningredient to all of them. This paves the way for future experiments which\nshould deepen our understanding of glasses.\n", "  The effects of pressure on antiferromagnetic (AFM) and superconducting phase\ntransitions of 112-type Ca$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$FeAs$_{2}$ were studied, and the\nin-plane electrical resistivity $\\rho_{ab}$ was measured with an indenter-type\npressure cell. The AFM phase transition temperatures of $T_{\\rm N}$ = 47, 63,\nand 63 K at ambient pressure for $x$ = 0.18, 0.21, and 0.26 was suppressed by\napplying pressure $P$, with superconductivity emerging at critical pressures of\n$P_{\\rm c}$ $\\simeq$ 0, 1.5, and 3.4 GPa, respectively. Correspondingly, the\nslope of $T_{\\rm N}$ against $P$ decreased as $dT_{\\rm N}/P$ $\\simeq$ $-$15 and\n$-$2 K/GPa for $x$ = 0.21 and 0.26, respectively. Thus, although the AFM phase\nwas stabilized with La doping $x$, the AFM phase was suppressed by pressure,\nand superconductivity eventually emerged.\n", "  This paper presents an extension of the hybrid scheme proposed by Wang et al.\n(J. Comput. Phys. 229 (2010) 169-180) for numerical simulation of compressible\nisotropic turbulence to flows with higher turbulent Mach numbers. The scheme\nstill utilizes an 8th-order compact scheme with built-in hyperviscosity for\nsmooth regions and a 7th-order WENO scheme for highly compressive regions, but\nnow both in their conservation formulations and for the latter with the Roe\ntype characteristic-wise reconstruction. To enhance the robustness of the WENO\nscheme without compromising its high-resolution and accuracy, the\nrecursive-order-reduction procedure is adopted, where a new type of\nreconstruction-failure-detection criterion is constructed. To capture the\nupwind direction properly in extreme conditions, the global Lax-Friedrichs\nnumerical flux is used. In addition, a new form of cooling function is\nproposed, which is proved to be positivity-preserving. With these techniques,\nthe new scheme not only inherits the good properties of the original one but\nalso extends largely the computable range of turbulent Mach number, which has\nbeen further confirmed by numerical results.\n", "  Fast sausage modes in solar magnetic coronal loops are only fully contained\nin unrealistically short dense loops. Otherwise they are leaky, losing energy\nto their surrounds as outgoing waves. This causes any oscillation to decay\nexponentially in time. Simultaneous observations of both period and decay rate\ntherefore reveal the eigenfrequency of the observed mode, and potentially\ninsight into the tubes' nonuniform internal structure. In this article, a\nglobal spectral description of the oscillations is presented that results in an\nimplicit matrix eigenvalue equation where the eigenvalues are associated\npredominantly with the diagonal terms of the matrix. The off-diagonal terms\nvanish identically if the tube is uniform. A linearized perturbation approach,\napplied with respect to a uniform reference model, is developed that makes the\neigenvalues explicit. The implicit eigenvalue problem is easily solved\nnumerically though, and it is shown that knowledge of the real and imaginary\nparts of the eigenfrequency is sufficient to determine the width and density\ncontrast of a boundary layer over which the tubes' enhanced internal densities\ndrop to ambient values. Linearized density kernels are developed that show\nsensitivity only to the extreme outside of the loops for radial fundamental\nmodes, especially for small density enhancements, with no sensitivity to the\ncore. Higher radial harmonics do show some internal sensitivity, but these will\nbe more difficult to observe. Only kink modes are sensitive to the tube\ncentres. {Variation in internal and external Alfv\\'en speed along the loop is\nshown to have little effect on the fundamental dimensionless eigenfrequency,\nthough the associated eigenfunction becomes more compact at the loop apex as\nstratification increases, or may even displace from the apex.\n", "  We present a simple scheme for implementing a one-dimensional (1D)\nmagnetic-flux lattice of ultracold fermionic spin-$1/2$ atoms. The resulting\ntight-binding model supports gapped and gapless topological phases, and chiral\ncurrents for Meissner and vortex phases. Its single-particle spectra exhibit\ntopological flat bands at small flux, and the flatness sensitively depends on\nhopping strength. An effective $p$-wave interaction arises in a $s$-wave paired\nsuperfluid. Treating atomic internal states as forming a synthetic dimension\nand balancing the interplay of magnetic flux and Zeeman field, our model\ndescribes a tunable topological Fermi superfluid, which paves the way towards\nexperimental explorations of non-Abelian topological matter in 1D atomic\nquantum gases.\n", "  We consider a complete study of the influence of the cavity size on the\nspontaneous decay of an atom excited state, roughly approximated by a harmonic\noscillator. We confine the oscillator-field system in a spherical cavity of\nradius $R$, perfectly reflective, and work in the formalism of dressed\ncoordinates and states, which allows to perform non-perturbative calculations\nfor the probability of the atom to decay spontaneously from the first excited\nstate to the ground state. In free space, $R\\to\\infty$, we obtain known exact\nresults an for sufficiently small $R$ we have developed a power expansion\ncalculation in this parameter. Furthermore, for arbitrary cavity size radius,\nwe developed numerical computations and showed complete agreement with the\nexact one for $R\\to\\infty$ and the power expansion results for small cavities,\nin this way showing the robustness of our results. We have found that in\ngeneral the spontaneous decay of an excited state of the atom increases with\nthe cavity size radius and vice versa. For sufficiently small cavities the atom\npractically does not suffers spontaneous decay, whereas for large cavities the\nspontaneous decay approaches the free-space $R\\to\\infty$ value. On the other\nhand, for some particular values of the cavity radius, in which the cavity is\nin resonance with the natural frequency of the atom, the spontaneous decay\ntransition probability is increased compared to the free-space case. Finally,\nwe showed how the probability spontaneous decay go from an oscillatory time\nbehaviour, for finite cavity radius, to an almost exponential decay, for free\nspace.\n", "  Antiferromagnetically coupled Ising s =3 spins on a triangular lattice are\nvery close to ordering at zero temperature. The low temperature behaviour of a\ntriangular lattice with Ising spins s =3 has been simulated by using both\nGlauber and Kawasaki dynamics. The formation of misfit clusters, which are\nessential for destabilizing the ordered state, are inhibited by the use of\nKawasaki dynamics. The sublattice susceptibilities and the sublattice order\nparameter are found to depend qualitatively on the dynamics used so that robust\nordering occurs when Kawasaki dynamics are employed. The thermal behaviour that\nis found for the spin model with Kawasaki dynamics gives insight into the\nobserved ordering of side chains seen in a tetraphilic liquid crystal.\n", "  We prepared single crystals in UCo1-xRhxGe and UIr1-xRhxGe systems to\nestablish a complex dU-U-T (dU-U is the shortest interatomic uranium distance\nand T is temperature) magnetic phase diagram. This recognized a characteristic\nmaximum in magnetic susceptibility at temperature Tmax along the b axis as an\nimportant parameter. Three magnetically ordered regions can be distinguished\nwithin this scope; first a ferromagnetic region with Curie temperature < Tmax,\nsecond a ferromagnetic region with Curie temperature = Tmax and finally an\nantiferromagnetic region existing on the UIrGe side with N\\'eel temperature <\nTmax.\n", "  In this paper, we study the robustness of network topologies. We use the\nconcept of percolation as measuring tool to assess the reliability polynomial\nof those systems which can be modeled as a general inhomogeneous random graph\nas well as scale-free random graph.\n", "  The Fermi Gamma-ray Observatory discovered about a thousand extragalactic\nsources emitting energy from 100 MeV to 100 GeV. The majority of these sources\nbelong to the class of blazars characterized by a quasi-featureless optical\nspectrum (BL Lac Objects). This hampers the determination of their redshift and\ntherefore hinders the characterization of this class of objects. To investigate\nthe nature of these sources and to determine their redshift, we are carrying\nout an extensive campaign using the 10m Gran Telescopio Canarias to obtain high\nS/N ratio optical spectra. These observations allow us to confirm the blazar\nnature of the targets, to find new redshifts or to set stringent limits on the\nredshift based on the minimum equivalent width of specific absorption features\nthat can be measured in the spectrum and are expected from their host galaxy,\nassuming it is a massive elliptical galaxy. These results are of importance for\nthe multi-frequencies emission models of the blazars, to test their extreme\nphysics, to shed light on their cosmic evolution and abundance in the far\nUniverse. These gamma emitters are also of great importance for the\ncharacterization of the extragalactic background light through the absorption\nby the IR-optical background photons.\n", "  We investigate the dispersion relation and damping of plasmon modes in a\nbilayer-monolayer graphene heterostructure with carrier densities and at zero\ntemperature within the random-phase-approximation taking into account the\nnonhomogeneity of the dielectric background of the system. We derive analytical\nexpressions for plasmon frequencies by using long wavelength expansion of\nresponse and bare Coulomb interaction functions. We show that optical plasmon\ndispersion curve of the bilayer-monolayer system lies slightly below that of\ndouble-layer graphene (DLG) and the acoustic one lies much lower than that of\nDLG. We find that while decay rates of acoustic modes of the system and DLG are\nremarkably different, those of optical modes in both double-layer systems are\nsimilar. Except the damping rate of acoustic mode, properties of plasmon\nexcitations in considered system depend remarkably on the interlayer distance,\ninhomogeneity of the background, density ratio and spacer dielectric constant,\nespecially at large wave-vectors.\n", "  Discrete particle simulations are widely used to study large-scale\nparticulate flows in complex geometries where particle-particle and\nparticle-fluid interactions require an adequate representation but the\ncomputational cost has to be kept low. In this work, we present a novel\ncoupling approach for such simulations. A lattice Boltzmann formulation of the\ngeneralized Navier-Stokes equations is used to describe the fluid motion. This\npromises efficient simulations suitable for high performance computing and,\nsince volume displacement effects by the solid phase are considered, our\napproach is also applicable to non-dilute particulate systems. The discrete\nelement method is combined with an explicit evaluation of interparticle\nlubrication forces to simulate the motion of individual submerged particles.\nDrag, pressure and added mass forces determine the momentum transfer by\nfluid-particle interactions. A stable coupling algorithm is presented and\ndiscussed in detail. We demonstrate the validity of our approach for dilute as\nwell as dense systems by predicting the settling velocity of spheres over a\nbroad range of solid volume fractions in good agreement with semi-empirical\ncorrelations. Additionally, the accuracy of particle-wall interactions in a\nviscous fluid is thoroughly tested and established. Our approach can thus be\nreadily used for various particulate systems and can be extended\nstraightforward to e.g. non-spherical particles.\n", "  A theory of an optical two-photon breather in a graphene monolayer (or\ngraphene-like two-dimensional material) is constructed. The system of the\nmaterial equations for two-photon transitions and the wave equation for\ntransverse magnetic polarized modes of the surface plasmon polaritons are shown\nto reduce to the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with damping. Explicit\nanalytical expressions for a surface small intensity two-photon breather\n(0$\\pi$ pulse) of self-induced transparency are obtained. It is shown that the\noptical conductivity of graphene reduces the amplitude of the surface\ntwo-photon nonlinear wave during the propagation. The one-photon and two-photon\nbreathers in graphene are compared and have obtained that the differences\nbetween their parameters are significant.\n", "  In an academic landscape where female physicists are still strongly\nunderrepresented, underlying causes like unconscious gender bias deserve\nspecific attention. Members of academia are often not aware of their intrinsic,\nhence unconscious, biases; this can have negative effects on students and staff\nat all career levels. At the Queen's University Belfast, I have developed and\nconducted a workshop on unconscious gender bias awareness at the School of\nMathematics and Physics. The first installment of the workshop was attended by\n63 members of the School, among them 26 academic staff (lecturer level and\nabove). Participants attended an informational talk followed by a discussion\nsession, and then took part in the Harvard Implicit Association Test for\nassociation of gender with science. The participants self-reported their\nresults and their previous expectations, followed by a group discussion. Here I\npresent the observed magnitude of unconscious gender bias and summarise the\ndiscussion points of the participants. The outcomes that bias can have on the\nsuccess of physics students as well as the careers of physicists in an academic\ncontext will be highlighted. Putting the results into context, I discuss steps\nforward to make physics a level playing field for all genders.\n", "  We overview the potential of airborne X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes to probe\nthe axion-like particles parameter space.\n", "  We propose a low noise, triply-resonant, electro-optic (EO) scheme for\nquantum microwave-to-optical conversion based on coupled nanophotonics\nresonators integrated with a superconducting qubit. Our optical system features\na split resonance - a doublet - with a tunable frequency splitting that matches\nthe microwave resonance frequency of the superconducting qubit. This is in\ncontrast to conventional approaches where large optical resonators with\nfree-spectral range comparable to the qubit microwave frequency are used. In\nour system, EO mixing between the optical pump coupled into the low frequency\ndoublet mode and a resonance microwave photon results in an up-converted\noptical photon on resonance with high frequency doublet mode. Importantly, the\ndown-conversion process, which is the source of noise, is suppressed in our\nscheme as the coupled-resonator system does not support modes at that\nfrequency. Our device has at least an order of magnitude smaller footprint than\nthe conventional devices, resulting in large overlap between optical and\nmicrowave fields and large photon conversion rate ($g/2\\pi$) in the range of\n$\\sim$5-15 kHz. Owing to large $g$ factor and doubly-resonant nature of our\ndevice, microwave-to-optical frequency conversion can be achieved with optical\npump powers in the range of tens of microwatts, even with moderate values for\noptical $\\it{Q}$ ($\\sim 10^6$) and microwave $Q$ ($ \\sim10^4$). The performance\nmetrics of our device, with substantial improvement over the previous EO-based\napproaches, promise a scalable quantum microwave-to-optical conversion and\nnetworking of superconducting processors via optical fiber communication.\n", "  We discuss central exclusive diffractive dihadron production in proton-proton\ncollisions at high energies. The calculation is based on a tensor pomeron model\nand the amplitudes for the processes are formulated in an effective\nfield-theoretic approach. We include a purely diffractive dipion continuum, and\nthe scalar and tensor resonances decaying into the $\\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ pairs as\nwell as the photoproduction contributions ($\\rho^{0}$, Drell-S\\\"oding). We\ndiscuss how two pomerons couple to tensor meson $f_{2}(1270)$ and the\ninterference effects of the scalar and tensor resonances and the dipion\ncontinuum. The theoretical results are compared with existing CDF and CMS\nexperimental data. We discuss also the Drell-Hiida-Deck type mechanism with\ncentrally produced $\\rho^{0}$ meson associated with a very forward/backward\n$\\pi N$ system. For the $pp \\to pp \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-} \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ reaction we\nconsider both the $\\sigma \\sigma$ and $\\rho \\rho$ contributions as well as the\ntriple Regge exchange mechanism. Predictions for planned or being carried out\nexperiments (STAR, ALICE, ATLAS, CMS) are presented. We show the influence of\nthe experimental cuts on the integrated cross section and on various\ndifferential distributions for outgoing particles.\n", "  We discuss prompt production of $J/\\psi$ mesons in proton-proton collisions\nat the LHC within NRQCD k$t$-factorization approach using Kimber-Martin-Ryskin\n(KMR) and Kutak-Stasto (KS) unintegrated gluon distribution (UGDF). We include\nboth direct color-singlet production $gg \\to J/\\psi g$ as well as a feed-down\nfrom $\\chi_{c} \\to J/\\psi \\gamma$ and $\\psi' \\to J/\\psi X$. The corresponding\nmatrix elements for $gg \\to J/\\psi$, $gg \\to \\psi'$ and $gg \\to \\chi_{c}$\ninclude parameters of the nonrelativistic space wave functions of the quarkonia\nat $r=0$, which are taken from potential models from the literature. We\ncalculate the ratio of the corresponding cross sections for\n$\\chi_{c2}/\\chi_{c1}$. We compare our results with ATLAS experimental data.\nDifferential distributions in rapidity and transverse momentum of $J/\\psi$ and\n$\\psi'$ are calculated and compared to experimental data of the ALICE and LHCb\ncollaborations. We present results for three different values of energy 2.76\nTeV, 7 TeV and 13 TeV.\n", "  This paper demonstrates analytically and experimentally an acoustic\nlevitation motor which has the ability to levitate and rotate an object in the\nair without mechanical contact. To realize such a device two core methods are\napplied simultaneously; (i) resonance tracking with an Autoresonance feedback\nloop, (ii) generation of controlled structural traveling waves. The purpose of\nthe first method is to achieve near-field acoustic levitation, which can\nlevitate an object of a few kilograms. In this research, this is accomplished\nthrough high amplitude vibration of an aluminum annulus at ultrasonic\nfrequencies (~30kHz). For high efficiency, the annulus is designed to have a\nvery high Q value, and operating even slightly off resonance ceases levitation.\nCompounding this is the fact that the natural frequency constantly drifts as\nambient conditions and loading change. To accommodate such a drift, and produce\nstable levitation automatically, a resonance tracking feedback loop is employed\nhere. Simultaneously, the purpose of the second method is to achieve propulsion\nforces on the levitated object by propagating and controlling traveling waves\nin the aluminum annulus to create a thin layer of rotating air beneath the\nlevitated body. Even though a single vibration mode can produce only standing\nwaves, an axisymmetric structure possesses two modes per natural frequency, and\nexcitation of a doublet mode pair can generate effective travelling waves. The\npresent paper develops the theory behind the use of the Autoresonance feedback\nmethod for achieving constant levitation and propagating travelling waves in\nco- and counter rotating directions. It will be shown that all this can be\naccomplished with only single sensor. The result is a stable, repeatable and a\nhighly controllable contactless acoustic levitation motor.\n", "  Cold, dense filaments, some appearing as infrared dark clouds, are the\nnurseries of stars. Tremendous progress in terms of temperature, density\ndistribution and gas kinematics has been made in understanding the nature of\nthese filaments. However, very little is known about the role played by\nmagnetic fields in the evolution of these filaments. Here, I summarize the\nrecent observational efforts and ongoing projects (POLSTAR survey) in this\ndirection.\n", "  The driving mechanism of protostellar outflows and jets and their effects on\nthe star formation process obtained from recent theoretical and numerical\nstudies are described. Low-velocity outflows are driven by an outer region of\nthe circumstellar disk, while high-velocity jets are driven near an inner edge\nof the disk. The disk angular momentum is effectively transferred by magnetic\neffects in the outflow and jet driving regions where the magnetic field is well\ncoupled with neutral gas. On the other hand, in a high density gas region of\nthe disk (or intermediate region), the magnetic field dissipates and is\ndecoupled from neutral gas. Thus, in such a magnetically inactive region, no\noutward flow appears and the disk angular momentum is not effectively\ntransferred by magnetic effects. Therefore, in the disk intermediate region,\nthe disk surface density continues to increase and gravitational instability\noccurs and produce a non-axisymmetric (or spiral) structure. After spiral arms\nsufficiently develop, the disk angular momentum is transferred by gravitational\ntorque and a large amount of the disk mass accretes onto the central protostar\nfrom the circumstellar disk. The episodic accretion induces time-variable\nhigh-velocity jets. The jets do not significantly contribute to a dynamical\nevolution of the protostar and circumstellar disk, while the low-velocity\noutflows can eject a large fraction of the infalling gas and determine the\nfinal stellar mass.\n", "  We propose the concept of pseudorandom states and study their constructions,\nproperties, and applications. Under the assumption that quantum-secure one-way\nfunctions exist, we present concrete and efficient constructions of\npseudorandom states. The non-cloning theorem plays a central role in our\nstudy---it motivates the proper definition and characterizes one of the\nimportant properties of pseudorandom quantum states. Namely, there is no\nefficient quantum algorithm that can create more copies of the state from a\ngiven number of pseudorandom states. As the main application, we prove that any\nfamily of pseudorandom states naturally gives rise to a private-key quantum\nmoney scheme.\n", "  As data-driven methods rise in popularity in materials science applications,\na key question is how these machine learning models can be used to understand\nmicrostructure. Given the importance of process-structure-property relations\nthroughout materials science, it seems logical that models that can leverage\nmicrostructural data would be more capable of predicting property information.\nWhile there have been some recent attempts to use convolutional neural networks\nto understand microstructural images, these early studies have focused only on\nwhich featurizations yield the highest machine learning model accuracy for a\nsingle data set. This paper explores the use of convolutional neural networks\nfor classifying microstructure with a more holistic set of objectives in mind:\ngeneralization between data sets, number of features required, and\ninterpretability.\n", "  We are undertaking an ALMA survey of molecular gas in galaxies selected for\ntheir strong HI absorption, so-called DLA/sub-DLA galaxies. Here we report\nCO(2-1) detection from a DLA galaxy at z = 0.716. We also present optical and\nnear-infrared spectra of the galaxy revealing [OII], H{\\alpha} and [NII]\nemission lines shifted by ~170 km/s relative to the DLA, and providing an\noxygen abundance 3.2 times solar, similar to the absorption metallicity. We\nreport low unobscured SFR ~1 Msun/yr given the large reservoir of molecular\ngas, and also modest obscured SFR=4.5(+4.4,-2.6) Msun/yr based on far-IR and\nsub-mm data. We determine mass components of the galaxy: log[M*/Msun] =\n10.80(+0.07,-0.14), log[M mol-gas/Msun] = 10.37 +/-0.04, and log[M dust/Msun] =\n8.45(+0.10,-0.30). Surprisingly, this HI absorption-selected galaxy has no\nequivalent objects in CO surveys of flux-selected samples. The galaxy falls off\ncurrent scaling relations for the SFR to molecular gas mass and CO Tully-Fisher\nrelation. Detailed comparison of kinematical components of the absorbing,\nionized and molecular gas, combined with their spatial distribution, suggests\nthat part of the CO gas is both kinematically and spatially de-coupled from the\nmain galaxy. It is thus possible that a major star burst in the past could\nexplain the wide CO profile as well as the low SFR. Support for this also comes\nfrom the SED favouring an instantaneous burst of age ~0.5 Gyr. Our survey will\nestablish whether flux-selected surveys of molecular gas are missing a key\nstage in the evolution of galaxies and their conversion of gas to stars.\n", "  A number of image-processing problems can be formulated as optimization\nproblems. The objective function typically contains several terms specifically\ndesigned for different purposes. Parameters in front of these terms are used to\ncontrol the relative weights among them. It is of critical importance to tune\nthese parameters, as quality of the solution depends on their values. Tuning\nparameter is a relatively straightforward task for a human, as one can\nintelligently determine the direction of parameter adjustment based on the\nsolution quality. Yet manual parameter tuning is not only tedious in many\ncases, but becomes impractical when a number of parameters exist in a problem.\nAiming at solving this problem, this paper proposes an approach that employs\ndeep reinforcement learning to train a system that can automatically adjust\nparameters in a human-like manner. We demonstrate our idea in an example\nproblem of optimization-based iterative CT reconstruction with a pixel-wise\ntotal-variation regularization term. We set up a parameter tuning policy\nnetwork (PTPN), which maps an CT image patch to an output that specifies the\ndirection and amplitude by which the parameter at the patch center is adjusted.\nWe train the PTPN via an end-to-end reinforcement learning procedure. We\ndemonstrate that under the guidance of the trained PTPN for parameter tuning at\neach pixel, reconstructed CT images attain quality similar or better than in\nthose reconstructed with manually tuned parameters.\n", "  The Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) is a method that can be used to infer the\nvalue of an unknown quantity in a set of probability functions. In this work we\nreview two applications of MEP: one giving a precise inference of the Higgs\nboson mass value; and the other one allowing to infer the mass of the axion. In\nparticular, for the axion we assume that it has a decay channel into pairs of\nneutrinos, in addition to the decay into two photons. The Shannon entropy\nassociated to an initial ensemble of axions decaying into photons and neutrinos\nis then built for maximization.\n", "  We analyze the competitive evolution of codimension one and two morphologies\nwithin the $H^{-1}$ gradient flow of the strong Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard\nequation. On a slow time scale a sharp hypersurface reduction yields a\ndegenerate Mullins-Sekerka evolution for both codimension one and two\nhypersurfaces, leading to a geometric flow that depends locally on curvatures\ncouples to the dynamic value of the spatially constant far-field chemical\npotential. Both codimension one and two morphologies admit two classes of\nbifurcations, one leads to pearling, a short-wavelength in-plane modulation of\ninterfacial width, the other flips motion by curvature to the locally-ill posed\nmotion against curvature, which leads to fingering instabilities. We present a\nbifurcation diagram for the morphological competition, and compare our results\nquantitatively to simulations of the full system and qualitatively to\nsimulations of self-consistent mean field models and laboratory experiments;\nilluminating the role of the pearling bifurcation in the development of complex\nnetwork morphologies.\n", "  The concept of complexity as average symmetry is here formalised by\nintroducing a general expression dependent on the relevant symmetry and a\nrelated discrete set of transformations. This complexity has hybrid features of\nboth statistical complexities and of those related to algorithmic complexity.\nLike the former, random objects are not the most complex while they still are\nmore complex than the more symmetric ones (as in the latter). By applying this\ndefinition to the particular case of rotations of binary sequences, we are able\nto find a precise expression for it. In particular, we then analyse the\nbehaviour of this measure in different well-known automatic sequences, where we\nfind interesting new properties. A generalisation of the measure to statistical\nensembles is also presented and applied to the case of i.i.d. random sequences\nand to the equilibrium configurations of the one-dimensional Ising model. In\nboth cases, we find that the complexity is continuous and differentiable as a\nfunction of the relevant parameters and agrees with the intuitive requirements\nwe were looking for.\n", "  We investigate the clustering effect of dark energy (DE) in the formation of\ngalaxy clusters using the spherical collapse model. Assuming a fully clustered\nDE component, the spherical overdense region is treated as an isolated system\nwhich conserves the energy separately for both matter and DE inside the\nspherical region. Then, by introducing a parameter $r$ to characterize the\ndegree of DE clustering, which is defined by the nonlinear density contrast\nratio of matter to DE at turnaround in the recollapsing process, i.e. $r\\equiv\n\\nld_{\\de,\\ta}/\\nld_{\\m,\\ta}$, we are able to uniquely determine the spherical\ncollapsing process and hence obtain the virialized overdensity $\\Dvir$ through\na proper virialization scheme. Estimation of the virialized overdensities from\ncurrent observation on galaxy clusters suggests that $0.5 < r < 0.8$ at\n$1\\sigma$ level for the clustered DE with $w < -0.9$. Also, we compare our\nmethod to the linear perturbation theory that deals with the growth of DE\nperturbation at early times. While both results are consistent with each other,\nour method is practically simple and it shows that the collapse process is\nrather independent of initial DE perturbation and its evolution at early times.\n", "  Here, we explore some peculiar orbital features of the recently discovered\nasteroid A/2017 U1, which is a clear outlier when considering the average value\nof the eccentricity of known hyperbolic comets. As for the orientation of its\norbit in space, the orbital plane of A/2017 U1 seems to be away from any\nobvious clusters present for this population. The orbital nodes of A/2017 U1\nare well away from the paths of the planets of the Solar System and the Sun.\nAll these orbital properties appear to confirm A/2017 U1 as the first known\ninterstellar asteroid.\n", "  We report our current SMA and ALMA studies of disk and planet formation\naround protostars. We have revealed that $r \\gtrsim$100 AU scale disks in\nKeplerian rotation are ubiquitous around Class I sources. These Class I\nKeplerian disks are often embedded in rotating and infalling protostellar\nenvelopes. The infalling speeds of the protostellar envelopes are typically\n$\\sim$ 3-times smaller than the free-fall velocities, and the rotational\nprofiles follow the $r^{-1}$ profile, that is, rotation with the conserved\nspecific angular momentum. Our latest high-resolution ($\\sim$0$\\farcs$5) ALMA\nstudies, as well as the other studies in the literature, have unveiled that $r\n\\sim$100-AU scale Keplerian disks are also present in several Class 0\nprotostars, while in the other Class 0 sources the inferred upper limits of the\nKeplerian disks are very small ($r \\lessim$20 AU). Our recent data analyses of\nthe ALMA long baseline data of the Class I-II source HL Tau have revealed gaps\nin molecular gas as well as in dust in the surrounding disk, suggesting the\npresence of sub-Jovian planets in the disk. These results imply that disk and\nplanet formation should be completed in the protostellar stage.\n", "  Autonomous deployment and shape reconfiguration of structures is a crucial\nfield of research in space exploration with emerging applications in the\nautomotive, building and biomedical industries. Challenges in achieving\nautonomy include: bulky energy sources, imprecise deployment, jamming of\ncomponents and lack of structural integrity. Leveraging advances in the fields\nof shape memory polymers, bistability and 3D multi-material printing, we\npresent a 3D printed programmable actuator that enables the autonomous\ndeployment and shape reconfiguration of structures activated though surrounding\ntemperature change. Using a shape memory polymer as the temperature\ncontrollable energy source and a bistable mechanism as the linear actuator and\nforce amplifier, the structures achieve precise geometric activation and\nquantifiable load bearing capacity. The proposed unit actuator integrates these\ntwo components and is designed to be assembled into larger deployable and shape\nreconfigurable structures. First, we demonstrate that the activation of the\nunit actuator can be sequenced by tailoring each shape memory polymer to a\ndifferent activation time. Next, by changing the configuration of the actuator,\nwe demonstrate an initially flat surface that transforms into a pyramid or a\nhyperbolic paraboloid, thus demonstrating a multi-state structure. Load bearing\ncapability is demonstrated for both during activation and in the operating\nstate.\n", "  We propose a collective stringlike model of pentaquarks with the geometry of\nan equilateral tetrahedron in which the four quarks are located at the four\ncorners and the antiquark in its center. The nonplanar equilibrium\nconfiguration is a consequence of the permutation symmetry of the four quarks.\nIn an application to the spectrum of exotic Theta baryons, we find that the\nground state pentaquark has angular momentum and parity J(p)=1/2(-) and a small\nmagnetic moment of 0.382 nuclear magnetons. The decay width is suppressed by\nthe spatial overlap with the decay products.\n", "  We discuss the properties of the pentaquark in a collective stringlike model\nwith a nonplanar configuration of the four quarks and the antiquark. In an\napplication to the mass spectrum of exotic Theta baryons, we find that the\nground state pentaquark has angular momentum and parity J(p)=1/2(-) and a small\nmagnetic moment of 0.382 nuclear magnetons. The decay width is suppressed by\nthe spatial overlap with the decay products.\n", "  The main ideas behind nuclear supersymmetry are presented, starting from the\nbasic concepts of symmetry and the methods of group theory in physics. We\npropose new, more stringent experimental tests that probe the supersymmetry\nclassification in nuclei and point out that specific correlations should exist\nfor particle transfer intensities among supersymmetric partners. We also\ndiscuss possible ways to generalize these ideas to cases where no dynamical\nsymmetries are present. The combination of these theoretical and experimental\nstudies may play a unifying role in nuclear phenomena.\n", "  In these lecture notes I present a short review of nuclear shapes, shape\ncoexistence and shape-phase transitions in the interacting boson model. In a\nstudy with random interactions it is shown that the appearance of regular\nspectral features is a far more common phenomenon than was previously thought.\nThe origin of these features are explained by studying the relation with the\nunderlying geometric shapes.\n", "  Recent experimental data on space- and time-like form factors of the nucleon\nare analyzed in terms of a two-component model with a quark-like intrinsics\nstructure and a meson cloud. A good overall agreement is found for all\nelectromagnetic form factors with the exception of the neutron magnetic form\nfactor in the time-like region.\n", "  In this contribution, I discuss the role of symmetries and algebraic methods\nin nuclear structure physics. In particular, I review some recent developments\nin nuclear supersymmetry and indicate possible applications for light nuclei in\nthe sd- and pf-shell.\n", "  We apply a symmetry-adapted algebraic model to the vibrational excitations in\nD_3h and T_d molecules. A systematic procedure is used to establish the\nrelation between the algebraic and configuration space formulations. In this\nway we have identified interaction terms that were absent in previous\nformulations of the vibron model. The inclusion of these new interactions leads\nto reliable spectroscopic predictions. We illustrate the method for the D_3h\ntriatomic molecules, H_3^+, Be_3 and Na_3, and the T_d molecules, Be_4 and\nCH_4.\n", "  We present a symmetry-adapted version of the vibron model and discuss an\napplication to D_{3h} triatomic molecules: H_3^+, Be_3 and Na_3^+.\n", "  We discuss a symmetry-adapted algebraic (or vibron) model for molecular\nspectroscopy. The model is formulated in terms of tensor operators under the\nmolecular point group. In this way, we have identified interactions that are\nabsent in previous versions of the vibron model, in which the Hamiltonian is\nexpressed in terms of Casimir operators and their products. The inclusion of\nthese new interactions leads to reliable spectroscopic predictions. As an\nexample we study the vibrational excitations of the methane molecule, and\ncompare our results with those obtained in other algebraic models.\n"]}
