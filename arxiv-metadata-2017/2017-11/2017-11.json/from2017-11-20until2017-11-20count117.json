The\nmethod is based on an adaptation of the method of particular solutions to the\ncase of locally symmetric spaces and on explicit estimates for the\napproximation of eigenfunctions on hyperbolic surfaces by certain basis\nfunctions. It can be applied to check whether or not there is an eigenvalue in\nan \\epsilon-neighborhood of a given number \\lambda>0. This makes it possible to\nfind all the eigenvalues in a specified interval, up to a given precision with\nrigorous error estimates. The method converges exponentially fast with the\nnumber of basis functions used. Combining the knowledge of the eigenvalues with\nthe Selberg trace formula we are able to compute values and derivatives of the\nspectral zeta function again with error bounds. As an example we calculate the\nspectral determinant and the Casimir energy of the Bolza surface and other\nsurfaces.\n", "  We propose a spherically symmetric and anisotropic model for strange quark\nstars within the framework of MIT Bag model. Though the model is found to\ncomply with all the physical requirements of a realistic star satisfying a\nstrange matter equation of state (EOS), the estimated values the Bag constant\nfor different strange star candidates like Her X-1, SAX J 1808.4-3658 and 4U\n1820-30, clearly indicate that the Bag constant need not necessarily lie within\nthe range of 60-80 MeV fm$^{-3}$ as claimed in the literature.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical nature of the collapse process of a spherically\nsymmetric star in quasi-static hydrodynamical equilibrium. The star collapses\nfrom an initial static configuration by dissipating energy in the form of a\nradial heat flux. The dissipation ensures that the singularity is never formed\nand the stellar mass completely evaporates over a finite time.\n", "  We present a new catalog of 118 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and\none Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxy (HLIRG) by crossmatching AKARI all-sky survey\nwith the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS DR10) and the Final\nData Release of the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). 40 of the\nULIRGs and one HLIRG are new identifications. We find that ULIRGs are\ninteracting pair galaxies or ongoing/post mergers. This is consistent with the\nwidely accepted view: ULIRGs are major mergers of disk galaxies. We confirm the\npreviously known positive trend between the AGN fraction and IR luminosity. We\nshow that ULIRGs have a large off-set from the 'main sequence' up to z~1; their\noff-set from the z~2 'main sequence' is relatively smaller. We find a\nconsistent result with the previous studies showing that compared to local star\nforming SDSS galaxies of similar mass, local ULIRGs have lower oxygen\nabundances. We for the first time demonstrate that ULIRGs follow the\nfundamental metallicity relation (FMR). The scatter of ULIRGs around the FMR\n(0.09 dex - 0.5 dex) is comparable with the scatter of z~2-3 galaxies. Their\noptical colors show that ULIRGs are mostly blue galaxies and this agrees with\nprevious findings. We provide the largest local (0.050 < z < 0.487) ULIRG\ncatalog with stellar masses, SFRs, gas metallicities and optical colors. Our\ncatalog provides us active galaxies analogous to high-z galaxies in the local\nUniverse where they can be rigorously scrutinized.\n", "  The nonlinear propagation of dust-acoustic (DA) waves in a magnetized dusty\nplasma with a pair of trapped ions is investigated. Starting from a set of\nhydrodynamic equations for massive dust fluids as well as kinetic Vlasov\nequations for ions, and applying the reductive perturbation technique, a\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV)-like equation with a complex coefficient of\nnonlinearity is derived, which governs the evolution of small-amplitude DA\nwaves in plasmas. The complex coefficient arises due to vortex-like\ndistributions of both positive and negative ions. An analytical as well as\nnumerical solution of the KdV equation are obtained and analyzed with the\neffects of external magnetic field, the dust pressure as well as different mass\nand temperatures of positive and negative ions.\n", "  We present a class of conformally flat solutions of the Einstein's field\nequations for spherical systems undergoing gravitational collapse accompanied\nwith radial heat flux. The interior space-time of the collapsing matter is\nchosen to be conformal to the Robertson-Walker space-time so that its Weyl\ntensor vanishes identically. The conditions which ensure smooth matching of the\ninterior space-time of the collapsing system, across its boundary, with the\nexterior space-time of a radiating star which is described by Vaidya metric\nlead to an equation governing its overall subsequent evolution. New solutions\nof this equation have been shown to provide physically viable models of\ncollapsing stars.\n", "  We present a metallicity analysis of 83 late-type giants within the central 1\npc of the Milky Way. K-band spectroscopy of these stars were obtained with the\nmedium-spectral resolution integral-field spectrograph NIFS on Gemini North\nusing laser-guide star adaptive optics. Using spectral template fitting with\nthe MARCS synthetic spectral grid, we find that there is large variation in\nmetallicity, with stars ranging from [M/H] $<$ -1.0 to above solar metallicity.\nAbout 6\\% of the stars have [M/H] $<$ -0.5. This result is in contrast to\nprevious observations, with smaller samples, that show stars at the Galactic\ncenter have approximately solar metallicity with only small variations. Our\ncurrent measurement uncertainties are dominated by systematics in the model,\nespecially at [M/H] $>$ 0, where there are stellar lines not represented in the\nmodel. However, the conclusion that there are low metallicity stars, as well as\nlarge variations in metallicity is robust. The metallicity may be an indicator\nof the origin of these stars. The low-metallicity population is consistent with\nthat of globular clusters in the Milky Way, but their small fraction likely\nmeans that globular cluster infall is not the dominant mechanism for forming\nthe Milky Way nuclear star cluster. The majority of stars are at or above solar\nmetallicity, which suggests they were formed closer to the Galactic center or\nfrom the disk. In addition, our results indicate that it will be important for\nstar formation history analyses using red giants at the Galactic center to\nconsider the effect of varying metallicity.\n", "  We use a continued fraction approach to compare two statistical ensembles of\nquadrangulations with a boundary, both controlled by two parameters. In the\nfirst ensemble, the quadrangulations are bicolored and the parameters control\ntheir numbers of vertices of both colors. In the second ensemble, the\nparameters control instead the number of vertices which are local maxima for\nthe distance to a given vertex, and the number of those which are not. Both\nensembles may be described either by their (bivariate) generating functions at\nfixed boundary length or, after some standard slice decomposition, by their\n(bivariate) slice generating functions. We first show that the fixed boundary\nlength generating functions are in fact equal for the two ensembles. We then\nshow that the slice generating functions, although different for the two\nensembles, simply correspond to two different ways of encoding the same\nquantity as a continued fraction. This property is used to obtain explicit\nexpressions for the slice generating functions in a constructive way.\n", "  Recent research on temporal networks has highlighted the limitations of a\nstatic network perspective for our understanding of complex systems with\ndynamic topologies. In particular, recent works have shown that i) the specific\norder in which links occur in real-world temporal networks affects causality\nstructures and thus the evolution of dynamical processes, and ii) higher-order\naggregate representations of temporal networks can be used to analytically\nstudy the effect of these order correlations on dynamical processes. In this\narticle we analyze the effect of order correlations on path-based centrality\nmeasures in real-world temporal networks. Analyzing temporal equivalents of\nbetweenness, closeness and reach centrality in six empirical temporal networks,\nwe first show that an analysis of the commonly used static, time-aggregated\nrepresentation can give misleading results about the actual importance of\nnodes. We further study higher-order time-aggregated networks, a recently\nproposed generalization of the commonly applied static, time-aggregated\nrepresentation of temporal networks. Here, we particularly define path-based\ncentrality measures based on second-order aggregate networks, empirically\nvalidating that node centralities calculated in this way better capture the\ntrue temporal centralities of nodes than node centralities calculated based on\nthe commonly used static (first-order) representation. Apart from providing a\nsimple and practical method for the approximation of path-based centralities in\ntemporal networks, our results highlight interesting perspectives for the use\nof higher-order aggregate networks in the analysis of time-stamped network\ndata.\n", "  We present a new derivation of the distance-dependent two-point function of\nrandom planar triangulations. As it is well-known, this function is intimately\nrelated to the generating functions of so-called slices, which are pieces of\ntriangulation having boundaries made of shortest paths of prescribed length. We\nshow that the slice generating functions are fully determined by a direct\nrecursive relation on their boundary length. Remarkably, the kernel of this\nrecursion is some quantity introduced and computed by Tutte a long time ago in\nthe context of a global enumeration of planar triangulations. We may thus rely\non these old results to solve our new recursion relation explicitly in a\nconstructive way.\n", "  We apply a recently developed technique to determine adapted coordinates for\nthe sixth degree Landau-deGennes potential, in which the potential is specially\nsimple, to analyze the possibility of a direct transition between the fully\nsymmetric state and a biaxial phase in nematic liquid crystals. {Our results\nconfirm, with simpler computations, results by Allender and Longa.\n", "  We give a new derivation of the distance-dependent two-point function of\nplanar quadrangulations by solving a new direct recursion relation for the\nassociated slice generating functions. Our approach for both the derivation and\nthe solution of this new recursion is in all points similar to that used\nrecently by the author in the context of planar triangulations.\n", "  The hull perimeter at distance d in a planar map with two marked vertices at\ndistance k from each other is the length of the closed curve separating these\ntwo vertices and lying at distance d from the first one (d<k). We study the\nstatistics of hull perimeters in large random planar triangulations and\nquadrangulations as a function of both k and d. Explicit expressions for the\nprobability density of the hull perimeter at distance d, as well as for the\njoint probability density of hull perimeters at distances d1 and d2, are\nobtained in the limit of infinitely large k. We also consider the situation\nwhere the distance d at which the hull perimeter is measured corresponds to a\nfinite fraction of k. The various laws that we obtain are identical for\ntriangulations and for quadrangulations, up to a global rescaling. Our approach\nis based on recursion relations recently introduced by the author which\ndetermine the generating functions of so-called slices, i.e. pieces of maps\nwith appropriate distance constraints. It is indeed shown that the map\ndecompositions underlying these recursion relations are intimately linked to\nthe notion of hull perimeters and provide a simple way to fully control them.\n", "  In recent years, various doping methods for epitaxial graphene have been\ndemonstrated through atom substitution and adsorption. Here we observe by\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) a coupling-induced Dirac cone\nrenormalization when depositing small amounts of Ti onto epitaxial graphene on\nSiC. We obtain a remarkably high doping efficiency and a readily tunable\ncarrier velocity simply by changing the amount of deposited Ti.\nFirst-principles theoretical calculations show that a strong lateral\n(non-vertical) orbital coupling leads to an efficient doping of graphene by\nhybridizing the 2pz orbital of graphene and the 3d orbitals of the Ti\nadsorbate, which attached on graphene without creating any trap/scattering\nstates. This Ti-induced hybridization is adsorbate-specific and has major\nconsequences for efficient doping as well as applications towards\nadsorbate-induced modification of carrier transport in graphene.\n", "  The amplitude modulation of three dimensional (3D) dust ion-acoustic wave\n(DIAW) packets is studied in a collisionless magnetized plasma with inertial\npositive ions, superthermal electrons and negatively charged immobile dust\ngrains. By using the reductive perturbation technique, a 3D-nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation is derived, which governs the slow modulation of\nDIAW packets. The latter are found to be stable in the low-frequency\n$(\\omega<\\omega_c)$ regime, whereas they are unstable for $\\omega>\\omega_c$,\nand the modulational instability (MI) is related to the modulational\nobliqueness $(\\theta)$. Here, $\\omega~(\\omega_c)$ is the nondimensional wave\n(ion-cyclotron) frequency. It is shown that the superthermal parameter\n$\\kappa$, the frequency $\\omega_c$ as well as the charged dust impurity\n$(0<\\mu<1)$ shift the MI domains around the $\\omega-\\theta$ plane, where $\\mu$\nis the ratio of electron to ion number densities. Furthermore, it is found that\nthe decay rate of instability is quenched by the superthermal parameter\n$\\kappa$ with cut-offs at lower wave number of modulation ($K$), however, it\ncan be higher (lower) with increasing values of $\\mu$ ($\\omega_c$) having\ncut-offs at higher values of $K$.\n", "  A geometrical approach to the calculation of N-point Feynman diagrams is\nreviewed. It is shown that the geometrical splitting yields useful connections\nbetween Feynman integrals with different momenta and masses. It is demonstrated\nhow these results can be used to reduce the number of variables in the\noccurring functions.\n", "  Two-dimensional density-matrix renormalization group method is employed to\nexamine the ground state phase diagram of the Hubbard model on the triangular\nlattice at half filling. The calculation reveals two discontinuities in the\ndouble occupancy with increasing the repulsive Hubbard interaction U at Uc1 =\n7.55 t and Uc2 = 9.65 t (t being the hopping integral), indicating that there\nare three phases separated by first order transitions. The absence of any\nsingularity in physical quantities for 0 < U < Uc1 implies that this phase\ncorresponds to a metallic phase. The local spin density induced by an applied\npinning magnetic field for U > Uc2 exhibits a three sublattice feature, which\nis compatible with the Neel ordered state realized in the strong coupling\nlimit. For Uc1 < U < Uc2, a response to the applied pinning magnetic field is\ncomparable to that in the metallic phase but a relatively large spin\ncorrelation length is found with neither valence bond nor chiral magnetic\norder, suggesting a paramagnetic nature which resembles gapless spin liquid.\nThe calculation also finds that the pair- ing correlation function\nmonotonically decreases with increasing U and thus the superconductivity is\nunlikely in the intermediate phase.\n", "  We study a generalization of the original tree-indexed dyadic model by Katz\nand Pavlovi\\'c for the turbulent energy cascade of three-dimensional Euler\nequation. We allow the coefficients to vary with some restrictions, thus giving\nthe model a realistic spatial intermittency. By introducing a forcing term on\nthe first component, the fixed point of the dynamics is well defined and some\nexplicit computations allow to prove the rich multifractal structure of the\nsolution. In particular the exponent of the structure function is concave in\naccordance with other theoretical and experimental models. Moreover anomalous\nenergy dissipation happens in a fractal set of dimension strictly less than 3.\n", "  New discoveries and developments in almost every area of correlated electron\nphysics were presented at SCES 2016. Here, I provide a personal perspective on\nsome of these developments, highlighting some new ideas in computational\nphysics, discussing the \"hidden order\" challenges of cuprate and heavy electron\nsuperconductors, the mysterious bulk excitations of the topological Kondo\ninsulator SmB$_{6}$ and new progress in research on quantum spin ice, iron\nbased superconductors and quantum criticality.\n", "  In this paper, a quantum Stern-Gerlach thought experiment is introduced\nwhere, in addition to the intrinsic angular momentum of an atom, the magnetic\nfield is also treated quantum mechanically. A freely falling spin polarised\nBose-Einstein condensate passes close to a flux-qubit and interacts with the\nquantum superimposed magnetic field of the flux-qubit. Such an interaction\nresults a macroscopic quantum entanglement of the path of a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate with the magnetic flux quantum state of the flux-qubit. In this\npaper, three regimes of coupling between the flux-qubit and a freely falling\nBose-Einstein condensate are discussed. The decoherence time limit required to\nachieve a strong coupling regime is also estimated. This paper also explores,\nhow to produce a path entangled Bose-Einstein condensate where, the condensate\ncan be located at physically distinct locations simultaneously. Paper provides\nnew fundamental insights about the foundations of the quantum Stern-Gerlach\nexperiment.\n", "  We present a security proof for establishing private entanglement by means of\nrecurrence-type entanglement distillation protocols over noisy quantum\nchannels. We consider protocols where the local devices are imperfect, and show\nthat nonetheless a confidential quantum channel can be established, and used to\ne.g. perform distributed quantum computation in a secure manner. While our\nresults are not fully device independent (which we argue to be unachievable in\nsettings with quantum outputs), our proof holds for arbitrary channel noise and\nnoisy local operations, and even in the case where the eavesdropper learns the\nnoise. Our approach relies on non-trivial properties of distillation protocols\nwhich are used in conjunction with de-Finetti and post-selection-type\ntechniques to reduce a general quantum attack in a non-asymptotic scenario to\nan i.i.d. setting. As a side result, we also provide entanglement distillation\nprotocols for non-i.i.d. input states.\n", "  Next-generation radio interferometers, such as the Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA), will revolutionise our understanding of the universe through their\nunprecedented sensitivity and resolution. However, to realise these goals\nsignificant challenges in image and data processing need to be overcome. The\nstandard methods in radio interferometry for reconstructing images, such as\nCLEAN, have served the community well over the last few decades and have\nsurvived largely because they are pragmatic. However, they produce\nreconstructed inter\\-ferometric images that are limited in quality and\nscalability for big data. In this work we apply and evaluate alternative\ninterferometric reconstruction methods that make use of state-of-the-art sparse\nimage reconstruction algorithms motivated by compressive sensing, which have\nbeen implemented in the PURIFY software package. In particular, we implement\nand apply the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (P-ADMM)\nalgorithm presented in a recent article. First, we assess the impact of the\ninterpolation kernel used to perform gridding and degridding on sparse image\nreconstruction. We find that the Kaiser-Bessel interpolation kernel performs as\nwell as prolate spheroidal wave functions, while providing a computational\nsaving and an analytic form. Second, we apply PURIFY to real interferometric\nobservations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA) and find images recovered by PURIFY are higher quality\nthan those recovered by CLEAN. Third, we discuss how PURIFY reconstructions\nexhibit additional advantages over those recovered by CLEAN. The latest version\nof PURIFY, with developments presented in this work, is made publicly\navailable.\n", "  We derived an analytic structure of the quark mass correction to chiral\nseparation effect (CSE) in small mass regime. We confirmed this structure by a\nD3/D7 holographic model study in a finite density, finite magnetic field\nbackground. The quark mass correction to CSE can be related to correlators of\npseudo-scalar condensate, quark number density and quark condensate in static\nlimit. We found scaling relations of these correlators with spatial momentum in\nthe small momentum regime. They characterize medium responses to electric\nfield, inhomogeneous quark mass and chiral shift. Beyond the small momentum\nregime, we found existence of normalizable mode, which possibly leads to\nformation of spiral phase. The normalizable mode exists beyond a critical\nmagnetic field, whose magnitude decreases with quark chemical potential.\n", "  We consider ensembles of planar maps with two marked vertices at distance k\nfrom each other and look at the closed line separating these vertices and lying\nat distance d from the first one (d<k). This line divides the map into two\ncomponents, the hull at distance d which corresponds to the part of the map\nlying on the same side as the first vertex and its complementary. The number of\nfaces within the hull is called the hull volume and the length of the\nseparating line the hull perimeter. We study the statistics of the hull volume\nand perimeter for arbitrary d and k in the limit of infinitely large planar\nquadrangulations, triangulations and Eulerian triangulations. We consider more\nprecisely situations where both d and k become large with the ratio d/k\nremaining finite. For infinitely large maps, two regimes may be encountered:\neither the hull has a finite volume and its complementary is infinitely large,\nor the hull itself has an infinite volume and its complementary is of finite\nsize. We compute the probability for the map to be in either regime as a\nfunction of d/k as well as a number of universal statistical laws for the hull\nperimeter and volume when maps are conditioned to be in one regime or the\nother.\n", "  This contribution about amplitude analyses in multibody hadronic charm decays\ndeals with some attempts to introduce theoretical constraints. Different\neffective hadronic formalism approaches are mentioned. A recent work, based on\na basic weak interaction process and a Chiral unitary model to account for the\nfinal state interaction, is described in details for the $f_0(980)$ production\nin $D_s^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ and $D_s^+ \\to \\pi^+ K^+ K^- $ decays. Within\nthe framework of the diagrammatic approach and flavor symmetry, a global\nanalysis of two-body $D$ decays into a vector meson and a pseudoscalar meson is\npresented. A quasi-two-body QCD factorization model for $D$ decays into three\nmesons and its recent application to $D^0 \\to K_S^0 \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ is outlined.\nFor processes with final-state pions and kaons and as an alternative to the sum\nof Breit-Wigner amplitudes, often used in experimental Dalitz-plot analyses,\namplitude parametrizations, in term of unitary $\\pi \\pi$, $\\pi K$ and $K \\bar\nK$ form factors, are proposed. These parametrizations are derived from\nquasi-two-body factorization models.\n", "  Quantum metrology allows for a tremendous boost in the accuracy of\nmeasurement of diverse physical parameters. The estimation of a rotation\nconstitutes a remarkable example of this quantum-enhanced precision. The\nrecently introduced Kings of Quantumness are especially germane for this task\nwhen the rotation axis is unknown, as they have a sensitivity independent of\nthat axis and they achieve a Heisenberg-limit scaling. Here, we report the\nexperimental realization of these states by generating up to 21-dimensional\norbital angular momentum states of single photons, and confirm their high\nmetrological abilities.\n", "  We introduce and analyze a new type of decoding algorithm called General\nColor Clustering (GCC), based on renormalization group methods, to be used in\nqudit color codes. The performance of this decoder is analyzed under code\ncapacity depolarizing noise, and is used to obtain the first fault-tolerant\nthreshold estimates for qudit 6-6-6 color codes. The proposed decoder is\ncompared with similar decoding schemes for qudit surface codes as well as the\ncurrent leading qubit decoders for both sets of codes. We find that, as with\nsurface codes, clustering performs sub-optimally for qubit color codes, giving\na threshold of $9.75\\%$ compared to the $11.4\\%$ obtained through surface\nprojection decoding methods. However, the threshold rate increases by up to\n$75\\%$ for large qudit dimensions, plateauing around $17.1\\%$. All the analysis\nis performed using QTop, a new open-source software for simulating and\nvisualizing topological quantum error correcting codes.\n", "  We investigate the nonlinear propagation of multidimensional magnetosonic\nshock waves (MSWs) in a dissipative quantum magnetoplasma. A macroscopic\nquantum magnetohydrodynamic (QMHD) model is used to include the quantum force\nassociated with the Bohm potential, the pressure-like spin force, the exchange\nand correlation force of electrons, as well as the dissipative force due to the\nkinematic viscosity of ions and the magnetic diffusivity. The effects of these\nforces on the properties of arbitrary amplitude MSWs are examined numerically.\nIt is found that the contribution from the exchange-correlation force appears\nto be dominant over those from the pressure gradient and the other similar\nquantum forces, and it results into a transition from monotonic to oscillatory\nshocks in presence of either the ion kinematic viscosity or the magnetic\ndiffusivity.\n", "  We introduce a framework for the modeling of sequential data capturing\npathways of varying lengths observed in a network. Such data are important,\ne.g., when studying click streams in information networks, travel patterns in\ntransportation systems, information cascades in social networks, biological\npathways or time-stamped social interactions. While it is common to apply graph\nanalytics and network analysis to such data, recent works have shown that\ntemporal correlations can invalidate the results of such methods. This raises a\nfundamental question: when is a network abstraction of sequential data\njustified? Addressing this open question, we propose a framework which combines\nMarkov chains of multiple, higher orders into a multi-layer graphical model\nthat captures temporal correlations in pathways at multiple length scales\nsimultaneously. We develop a model selection technique to infer the optimal\nnumber of layers of such a model and show that it outperforms previously used\nMarkov order detection techniques. An application to eight real-world data sets\non pathways and temporal networks shows that it allows to infer graphical\nmodels which capture both topological and temporal characteristics of such\ndata. Our work highlights fallacies of network abstractions and provides a\nprincipled answer to the open question when they are justified. Generalizing\nnetwork representations to multi-order graphical models, it opens perspectives\nfor new data mining and knowledge discovery algorithms.\n", "  Boltzmann machines are physics informed generative models with wide\napplications in machine learning. They can learn the probability distribution\nfrom an input dataset and generate new samples accordingly. Applying them back\nto physics, the Boltzmann machines are ideal recommender systems to accelerate\nMonte Carlo simulation of physical systems due to their flexibility and\neffectiveness. More intriguingly, we show that the generative sampling of the\nBoltzmann Machines can even discover unknown cluster Monte Carlo algorithms.\nThe creative power comes from the latent representation of the Boltzmann\nmachines, which learn to mediate complex interactions and identify clusters of\nthe physical system. We demonstrate these findings with concrete examples of\nthe classical Ising model with and without four spin plaquette interactions.\nOur results endorse a fresh research paradigm where intelligent machines are\ndesigned to create or inspire human discovery of innovative algorithms.\n", "  The aggregation of many independent estimates can outperform the most\naccurate individual judgment. This centenarian finding, popularly known as the\nwisdom of crowds, has been applied to problems ranging from the diagnosis of\ncancer to financial forecasting. It is widely believed that social influence\nundermines collective wisdom by reducing the diversity of opinions within the\ncrowd. Here, we show that if a large crowd is structured in small independent\ngroups, deliberation and social influence within groups improve the crowd's\ncollective accuracy. We asked a live crowd (N=5180) to respond to\ngeneral-knowledge questions (e.g., what is the height of the Eiffel Tower?).\nParticipants first answered individually, then deliberated and made consensus\ndecisions in groups of five, and finally provided revised individual estimates.\nWe found that averaging consensus decisions was substantially more accurate\nthan aggregating the initial independent opinions. Remarkably, combining as few\nas four consensus choices outperformed the wisdom of thousands of individuals.\n", "  In a recent paper, Chapuy conjectured that, for any positive integer k, the\nlaw for the fractions of total area covered by the k Voronoi cells defined by k\npoints picked uniformly at random in the Brownian map of any fixed genus is the\nsame law as that of a uniform k-division of the unit interval. For k=2, i.e.\nwith two points chosen uniformly at random, it means that the law for the ratio\nof the area of one of the two Voronoi cells by the total area of the map is\nuniform between 0 and 1. Here, by a direct computation of the desired law, we\nshow that this latter conjecture for k=2 actually holds in the case of large\nplanar (genus 0) quadrangulations as well as for large general planar maps\n(i.e. maps whose faces have arbitrary degrees). This corroborates Chapuy's\nconjecture in its simplest realizations.\n", "  We introduce and study the adiabatic dynamics of free-fermion models subject\nto a local Lindblad bath and in the presence of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.\nThe merit of these models is that they can be solved exactly, and will help us\nto study the interplay between non-adiabatic transitions and dissipation in\nmany-body quantum systems. After the adiabatic evolution, we evaluate the\nexcess energy (average value of the Hamiltonian) as a measure of the deviation\nfrom reaching the target final ground state. We compute the excess energy in a\nvariety of different situations, where the nature of the bath and the\nHamiltonian is modified. We find a robust evidence of the fact that an optimal\nworking time for the quantum annealing protocol emerges as a result of the\ncompetition between the non-adiabatic effects and the dissipative processes. We\ncompare these results with matrix-product-operator simulations of an Ising\nsystem and show that the phenomenology we found applies also for this more\nrealistic case.\n", "  Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is based on a two-steps\napproach: estimation of the magnetic moments distribution inside the body,\nfollowed by a voxel-by-voxel quantification of the human tissue properties.\nThis splitting simplifies the computations but poses several constraints on the\nmeasurement process, limiting its efficiency. Here, we perform quantitative MRI\nas a one step process; signal localization and parameter quantification are\nsimultaneously obtained by the solution of a large scale nonlinear inversion\nproblem based on first-principles. As a consequence, the constraints on the\nmeasurement process can be relaxed and acquisition schemes that are time\nefficient and widely available in clinical MRI scanners can be employed. We\nshow that the nonlinear tomography approach is applicable to MRI and returns\nhuman tissue maps from very short experiments. Keywords: MR-STAT, quantitative\nMRI, nonlinear tomography, MR Fingerprinting, large scale inversion.\n", "  We present a simple method to control the position of ellipsoidal magnetic\nparticles in microchannel Poiseuille flow using a static uniform magnetic\nfield. The magnetic field is utilized to pin the particle orientation, and the\nhydrodynamic interactions between ellipsoids and channel walls allow control of\nthe transverse position of the particles. We employ a far-field hydrodynamic\ntheory and simulations using the boundary element method and Brownian dynamics\nto show how magnetic particles can be focussed and segregated by size and\nshape. This is of importance for particle manipulation in lab-on-a-chip\ndevices.\n", "  We consider a flavoured $B-L$ gauge symmetry under which only the third\ngeneration fermions are charged. Such a symmetry can survive at low energies\n(~TeV) while still allowing for two superheavy right-handed neutrinos,\nconsistent with neutrino masses via see-saw and leptogenesis. We describe a\nmechanism for generating Yukawa couplings in this model and also discuss the\nlow-energy phenomenology. Interestingly, the new gauge boson could explain the\nrecent hints of lepton universality violation at LHCb, with a gauge coupling\nthat remains perturbative up to the Planck scale. Finally, we discuss more\ngeneral $U(1)$ symmetries and show that there exist only two classes of\nvectorial $U(1)$ that are both consistent with leptogenesis and remain\nphenomenologically viable at low-energies.\n", "  We show that the one-loop quantum deformation of the universal hypermultiplet\nprovides a family of complete $1/4$-pinched negatively curved quaternionic\nK\\\"ahler (i.e. half conformally flat Einstein) metrics $g^c$, $c\\ge 0$, on\n$\\mathbb R^4$. The metric $g^0$ is the complex hyperbolic metric whereas the\nfamily $(g^c)_{c>0}$ is equivalent to a family of metrics $(h^b)_{b>0}$\ndepending on $b=1/c$ and smoothly extending to $b=0$ for which $h^0$ is the\nreal hyperbolic metric. In this sense the one-loop deformation interpolates\nbetween the real and the complex hyperbolic metrics. We also determine the\n(singular) conformal structure at infinity for the above families.\n", "  Effects of Kaluza-Klein excited neutral vector bosons ($Z'$ bosons) in the\ngauge-Higgs unification on $e^+e^- \\to \\bar{q}q, \\ell^+\\ell^-$ cross sections\nare studied, particularly in future $e^+ e^-$ collider experiments with\npolarized beams. Significant deviations in the energy and polarization\ndependence in $\\sigma(\\mu^+\\mu^-)$, the lepton forward-backward asymmetry,\n$R_b(\\mu) \\equiv \\sigma(\\bar{b}b)/\\sigma(\\mu^+\\mu^-)$ and the left-right\nasymmetry from the standard model are predicted.\n", "  We study the possibilities and the implications of a spontaneous breakdown of\ncharge in the MSSM and in the $Z_3$-symmetric NMSSM. The breakdown is triggered\nby the charged states of the Higgs doublets acquiring vacuum expectation\nvalues. In the MSSM, it is known that the presence of a charge conserving\nminimum for the tree-level Higgs potential precludes a deeper (global)\ncharge-breaking minimum. We find that the inclusion of radiative correction to\nthe potential does not alter the situation while a deeper charge-conserving\nminimum could arise, albeit with no major practical consequences. In the NMSSM\nscenario, a charge-breaking global minimum, with or without an accompanying\ncharge-conserving deeper minimum, could appear even with the tree-level Higgs\npotential thanks to the presence of a charge-neutral scalar state which\ntransforms as a singlet under the Standard Model gauge group. Use of the NMSSM\nHiggs potential that includes both quantum and thermal corrections and the\nrequirement of a viable (stable or long-lived) vacuum that breaks the\nelectroweak symmetry, along with its compatibility with the latest Higgs data,\nlead to nontrivial constraints on the NMSSM parameter space.\n", "  Chemical equilibrium is a commonly made assumption in the freeze-out\ncalculation of coannihilating dark matter. We explore the possible failure of\nthis assumption and find a new conversion-driven freeze-out mechanism.\nConsidering a representative simplified model inspired by supersymmetry with a\nneutralino- and sbottom-like particle we find regions in parameter space with\nvery small couplings accommodating the measured relic density. In this region\nfreeze-out takes place out of chemical equilibrium and dark matter\nself-annihilation is thoroughly inefficient. The relic density is governed\nprimarily by the size of the conversion terms in the Boltzmann equations. Due\nto the small dark matter coupling the parameter region is immune to direct\ndetection but predicts an interesting signature of disappearing tracks or\ndisplaced vertices at the LHC. Unlike freeze-in or superWIMP scenarios,\nconversion-driven freeze-out is not sensitive to the initial conditions at the\nend of reheating.\n", "  Dual meson condensates as possible order parameters for deconfinement are\ninvestigated in a Polyakov-loop enhanced linear sigma model of QCD at both zero\nand finite isospin chemical potential $\\mu_I$. We find that the rapid rise of\nthe dual sigma condensate (corresponding to the dressed Polyakov-loop) with $T$\nis driven by the chiral transition, no matter whether the Polyakov-loop\ndynamics is included or not. For $\\mu_I>m_\\pi/2$, the dual sigma condensate\nshows abnormal thermal behavior which even decreases with $T$ below the melting\ntemperature $T_c^{I_3}$ of pion superfluidity; On the other hand, even the dual\npion condensate always increases with $T$, its maximum slope locates exactly at\n$T_c^{I_3}$ rather than the deconfinement temperature $T_c^{P}$ determined by\nthe Polyakov-loop. All these are qualitatively consistent with the previous\nresults obtained in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type models. The dual vector meson\ncondensate for $\\mu_I>m_\\pi/2$ is also calculated. This quantity is more\nsensitive to the chiral transition when taking into account the Dirac-sea\ncontribution. Our study further suggests that it should be cautious to use dual\nobservables to indicate the deconfinement transition, especially in QCD models.\n", "  Some low-$n$ kink-ballooning modes not far from marginal stability are shown\nto exhibit a bifurcation between two very distinct nonlinear paths that depends\nsensitively on the background transport levels and linear perturbation\namplitudes. The particular instability studied in this work is an $n=1$ mode\ndominated by an $m/n=2/1$ component. It is driven by a large pressure gradient\nin weak magnetic shear and can appear in various high-$\\beta,$ hybrid/advanced\nscenarios. Here it is investigated in reversed shear equilibria where the\nregion around the safety-factor minimum provides favorable conditions. For a\ncertain range of parameters, a relatively benign path results in a saturated\n\"long-lived mode\" (LLM) that causes little confinement degradation. At the\nother extreme, the quadrupole geometry of the $2/1$ perturbed pressure field\nevolves into a ballooning finger that subsequently transitions from exponential\nto explosive growth. The finger eventually leads to a fast disruption with\nprecursors too short for any mitigation effort. Interestingly, the saturated\nLLM state is found to be metastable, it also can be driven explosively unstable\nby finite-amplitude perturbations. Similarities to some high-$\\beta$\ndisruptions in reversed-shear discharges are discussed.\n", "  Exotic massless fermionic excitations with non-zero Berry flux, other than\nDirac and Weyl fermions, could exist in condensed matter systems under the\nprotection of crystalline symmetries, such as spin-1 excitations with 3-fold\ndegeneracy and spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl fermions. Herein, by using ab\ninitio density functional theory, we show that these unconventional\nquasiparticles coexist with type-I and type-II Weyl fermions in a family of\ntransition metal silicides, including CoSi, RhSi, RhGe and CoGe, when the\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) is considered. Their non-trivial topology results in\na series of extensive Fermi arcs connecting projections of these bulk\nexcitations on side surface, which is confirmed by (010) surface electronic\nspectra of CoSi. In addition, these stable arc states exist within a wide\nenergy window around the Fermi level, which makes them readily accessible in\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements.\n", "  We study the energetics of nonthermal electrons produced in small\nacceleration episodes in the solar corona. We carried out an extensive survey\nspanning 2004--2015 and shortlisted 6 impulsive electron events detected at 1\nAU that was not associated with large solar flares(GOES soft X-ray class $>$\nC1) or with coronal mass ejections. Each of these events had weak, but\ndetectable hard Xray (HXR) emission near the west limb, and were associated\nwith interplanetary type III bursts. In some respects, these events seem like\nweak counterparts of \"cold/tenuous\" flares. The energy carried by the HXR\nproducing electron population was $\\approx 10^{23}$ -- $10^{25}$ erg, while\nthat in the corresponding population detected at 1 AU was $\\approx\n10^{24}$--$10^{25}$ erg. The number of electrons that escape the coronal\nacceleration site and reach 1 AU constitute 6 % to 148 % of those that\nprecipitate downwards to produce thick target HXR emission.\n", "  The thermodynamics of quantum chromodynamics at low temperatures and in\nsufficiently strong magnetic fields is governed by neutral pions. We analyze\nthe interacting system of neutral pions and photons at zero baryon chemical\npotential using effective field theory. As a consequence of the axial anomaly\nand the external magnetic field, the pions and photons mix with one another.\nThe resulting spectrum contains one usual, relativistic photon state, and two\nnonrelativistic modes, one of which is gapless and the other gapped.\nFurthermore, we calculate the leading, one-loop contribution to the pressure of\nthe system. In the chiral limit, a closed analytic expression for the pressure\nexists, which features an unusual scaling with temperature and magnetic field,\n$T^3B/f_\\pi$, at low temperatures, $T\\ll B/f_\\pi$. Finally, we determine the\npion decay rate as a function of the magnetic field at the tree level. The\nresult is affected by a competition of the anisotropic kinematics and the\nenlarged phase space due to the anomalous mass of the neutral pion. In the\nchiral limit, the decay rate scales as $B^3/f_\\pi^5$.\n", "  We study how the properties of a Lagrangian density for a single real scalar\nfield in flat spacetime change with inclusion of an overall factor depending\nonly on the field. The focus of the paper is to obtain analytical results. So,\nwe show that even though it is possible to perform a field redefinition to get\nan equivalent canonical model, it is not always feasible to write the canonical\nmodel in terms of elementary functions. Also, we investigate the behavior of\nthe energy density and the linear stability of the solutions. Finally, we show\nthat one can find a class of models that present the same energy density and\nthe same stability potential.\n", "  We investigate a theoretical model for effective carrier mobility to\ncomprehensively describe the behavior of the perpendicular carrier transport\nacross multiple quantum well (MQW) structures under applied electric field. The\nanalytical expressions of effective mobilities for thermionic emission, direct\ntunneling, and thermally-assisted tunneling are derived based on the\nquasi-thermal equilibrium approximation and the semi-classical approach.\nEffective electron and hole mobilities in InGaAs/GaAsP MQWs predicted from our\nmodel are in good agreement with the experimental results obtained from the\ncarrier time-of-flight measurement near room temperature. With this concept,\nthe complicated carrier dynamics inside MQWs can be simplified to an effective\nmobility, an equivalent parameter which is more straightforward to handle and\ncan be easily incorporated in the conventional drift-diffusion model.\n", "  We present a study of simultaneous determination of mean distance and\nreddening to the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using the two photometric band RR\nLyrae data. Currently available largest number of highly accurate and precise\nlight curve data of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars (RRab) with better\nareal coverage released by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment\n(OGLE)-IV project observed in the two photometric bands $(V,I)$ were utilised\nsimultaneously in order to determine true distance and reddening independently\nfor each of the individual RRab stars. Different empirical and theoretical\ncalibrations leading to the determination of absolute magnitudes of RRab stars\nin the two bands, $V$ and $I$ along with their mean magnitudes were utilised to\ncalculate the apparent distance moduli of each of these RRab stars in these two\nbands. Decomposing the apparent distance moduli into true distance modulus and\nreddening in each of these two bands, individual RRab distance and reddening\nwere estimated solving the two apparent distance moduli equations. Modeling the\nobserved distributions of the true distance moduli and reddenings of the SMC\nRRab stars as Gaussian, the true mean distance modulus and mean reddening value\nto the SMC were found to be {\\bf $\\mu_{0}=18.909\\pm0.148$ mag and\n$E(B-V)=0.066\\pm0.036$ mag, respectively. This corresponds to a distance of $D\n= 60.506\\pm 4.126$~kpc to the SMC. The three dimensional distribution of the\nSMC RRab stars was approximated as ellipsoid. Then using the principal axes\ntransformation method \\citep{deb14} we find the axes ratios of the SMC:\n$1.000\\pm0.001,1.113\\pm 0.002, 2.986\\pm0.023$ with\n$i=3^{\\circ}.156\\pm0^{\\circ}.188$ and\n$\\theta_{\\text{lon}}=38^{\\circ}.027\\pm0.577$.} These results are in agreement\nwith other recent independent previous studies using different tracers and\nmethodologies.\n", "  We show that the experimental data of $p_T$ spectra of identified hadrons\nreleased recently by ALICE collaboration for $p$-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV exhibit a distinct universal behavior --- the quark\nnumber scaling. We further show that the scaling is a direct consequence of\nquark (re-)combination mechanism of hadronization and can be regarded as a\nstrong indication of the existence of the underlying source with constituent\nquark degree of freedom for the production of hadrons in $p$-Pb collisions at\nsuch high energies. We make also predictions for production of other hadrons.\n", "  Stellar-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBH) have been recently reconsidered as\na Dark Matter (DM) candidate, after the aLIGO discovery of several binary BH\nmergers with masses of tens of $M_\\odot$. Matter accretion on such massive\nobjects leads to the emission of high-energy photons, capable of altering the\nionization and thermal history of the universe. This in turn affects the\nstatistical properties of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies.\nPrevious analyses have assumed spherical accretion. We argue that this\napproximation likely breaks down and that an accretion disk should form in the\ndark ages. Using the most up-to-date tools to compute the energy deposition in\nthe medium, we derive constraints on the fraction of DM in PBH. Provided that\ndisks form early on, even under conservative assumptions for accretion, these\nconstraints exclude a monochromatic distribution of PBH with masses above $\\sim\n2\\, M_\\odot$ as the dominant form of DM. The bound on the median PBH mass gets\nmore stringent if a broad, log-normal mass function is considered. A deepened\nunderstanding of non-linear clustering properties and BH accretion disk physics\nwould permit an improved treatment and possibly lead to more stringent\nconstraints.\n", "  Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the quantification of\ncoherence or other coherence-like concepts within the framework of quantum\nresource theory. However, rigorously defined or not, the notion of coherence or\ndecoherence has already been used by the community for decades since the advent\nof quantum theory. Intuitively, the definitions of coherence and decoherence\nshould be the two sides of the same coin. Therefore, a natural question is\nraised: how can the conventional decoherence processes, such as the von\nNeumann-L\\\"{u}ders (projective) measurement postulation or partially dephasing\nchannels, fit into the bigger picture of the recently established theoretic\nframework? Here we show that the state collapse rules of the von Neumann or\nL\\\"{u}ders-type measurements, as special cases of genuinely incoherent\noperations (GIO), are consistent with the resource theories of quantum\ncoherence. New hierarchical measures of coherence are proposed for the\nL\\\"{u}ders-type measurement and their relationship with measurement-dependent\ndiscord is addressed. Moreover, utilizing the fixed point theory for\n$C^\\ast$-algebra, we prove that GIO indeed represent a particular type of\npartially dephasing (phase-damping) channels which have a matrix representation\nbased on the Schur product. By virtue of the Stinespring's dilation theorem,\nthe physical realizations of incoherent operations are investigated in detail\nand we find that GIO in fact constitute the core of strictly incoherent\noperations (SIO) and generally incoherent operations (IO) and the unspeakable\nnotion of coherence induced by GIO can be transferred to the theories of\nspeakable coherence by the corresponding permutation or relabeling operators.\n", "  Owing to the analogy with the ordinary photons in the visible range of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, the Glauber theory is generalized to address the\nquantum coherence of the gauge field fluctuations parametrically amplified\nduring an inflationary stage of expansion. The first and second degrees of\nquantum coherence of relic photons are then computed beyond the effective\nhorizon defined by the evolution of the susceptibility. In the zero-delay limit\nthe Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations exhibit a super-Poissonian statistics\nwhich is however different from the conventional results of the single-mode\napproximation customarily employed, in quantum optics, to classify the\ncoherence properties of visible light. While in the case of large-scale\ncurvature perturbations the degrees of quantum coherence coincide with the\nnaive expectation of the single-mode approximation, the net degree of\nsecond-order coherence computed for the relic photons diminishes thanks to the\neffect of the polarizations. We suggest that the Hanbury Brown-twiss\ncorrelations are probably the only tool to assess the quantum or classical\norigin of the large-scale magnetic fluctuations and of the corresponding\ncurvature perturbations.\n", "  We present a simple and efficient wave function ansatz for the treatment of\nexcited charge-transfer states in real-space quantum Monte Carlo methods. Using\nthe recently-introduced variation-after-response method [J. Chem. Phys. 145,\n081103 (2016)], this ansatz allows a crucial orbital optimization step to be\nperformed beyond a configuration interaction singles expansion, while only\nrequiring calculation of two Slater determinant objects. We demonstrate this\nansatz for the illustrative example of the stretched LiF molecule, for a range\nof excited states of formaldehyde, and finally for the more challenging\nethylene-tetrafluoroethylene molecule.\n", "  The origin of the Nuclear Star Cluster in the centre of our Galaxy is still\nunknown. One possibility is that it formed after the disruption of stellar\nclusters that spiralled into the Galactic Centre due to dynamical friction. We\ntrace the formation of the Nuclear Star Cluster around the central black hole,\nusing state-of-the-art N-body simulations, and follow the dynamics of the\nneutron stars born in the clusters. We then estimate the number of Millisecond\nPulsars (MSPs) that are released in the Nuclear Star Cluster, during its\nformation. The assembly and tidal dismemberment of globular clusters lead to a\npopulation of MSPs distributed over a radius of about 20 pc, with a peak near 3\npc. No clustering is found on the sub-parsec scale. We simulate the\ndetectability of this population with future radio telescopes like the MeerKAT\nradio telescope and SKA1, and find that about of order ten MSPs can be observed\nover this large volume, with a paucity of MSPs within the central parsec. This\nhelps discriminating this scenario from the in-situ formation model for the\nNuclear Star Cluster that would predict an over abundance of MSPs closer to the\nblack hole. We then discuss the potential contribution of our MSP population to\nthe gamma-ray excess at the Galactic Centre.\n", "  This work addresses the problem of elastic scattering through a localized\nimpurity in a one-dimensional crystal with sublattice freedom degrees. The\nimpurity yields long-range interferences in the local density of states known\nas Friedel oscillations. Here, we show that the internal degrees of freedom of\nBloch waves are responsible for a geometrical phase shift in Friedel\noscillations. The Fourier transform of the energy-resolved interference pattern\nreveals a topological property of this phase shift, which is intrinsically\nrelated to the Bloch band structure topology in the absence of impurity.\nTherefore, Friedel oscillations in the local density of states can be regarded\nas a probe of wave topological properties in a broad class of classical and\nquantum systems, such as acoustic and photonic crystals, ultracold atomic gases\nin optical lattices, and electronic compounds.\n", "  As is well known, one-dimensional systems with interactions restricted to\nfirst nearest neighbors admit a full analytically exact statistical-mechanical\nsolution. This is essentially due to the fact that the knowledge of the first\nnearest-neighbor probability distribution function, $p_1(r)$, is enough to\ndetermine the structural and thermodynamic properties of the system. On the\nother hand, if the interaction between second nearest-neighbor particles is\nturned on, the analytically exact solution is lost. Not only the knowledge of\n$p_1(r)$ is not sufficient anymore, but even its determination becomes a\ncomplex many-body problem. In this work we systematically explore different\napproximate solutions for one-dimensional second nearest-neighbor fluid models.\nWe apply those approximations to the square-well and the attractive two-step\npair potentials and compare them with Monte Carlo simulations, finding an\nexcellent agreement.\n", "  The topological insulator BiSbTeSe$_2$ corresponds to a compensated\nsemiconductor in which strong Coulomb disorder gives rise to the formation of\ncharge puddles, i.e., local accumulations of charge carriers, both in the bulk\nand on the surface. Bulk puddles are formed if the fluctuations of the Coulomb\npotential are as large as half of the band gap. The gapless surface, in\ncontrast, is sensitive to small fluctuations but the potential is strongly\nsuppressed due to the additional screening channel provided by metallic surface\ncarriers. To study the quantitative relationship between the properties of bulk\npuddles and surface puddles, we performed infrared transmittance measurements\nas well as scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the same sample of\nBiSbTeSe$_2$, which is close to perfect compensation. At 5.5 K, we find surface\npotential fluctuations occurring on a length scale $r_s = 40-50$ nm with\namplitude $\\Gamma = 8-14$ meV which is much smaller than in the bulk, where\noptical measurements detect the formation of bulk puddles. In this nominally\nundoped compound, the value of $\\Gamma$ is smaller than expected for pure\nscreening by surface carriers, and we argue that this arises most likely from a\ncooperative effect of bulk screening and surface screening.\n", "  We study the effect of having a finite temperature on the equation of state\nand structure of a white dwarf. In order to keep the treatment as general as\npossible we carry on our discussion for ideal quantum gases obeying to both the\nFermi-Dirac and the Bose-Einstein statistics even if we will only use the\nresults for the free electron gas inside a white dwarf. We discuss the effect\nof temperature on the stability of the star and on the Fermi hole.\n", "  We study the influence of geometric and dynamical anisotropies on the\ndevelopment of flow harmonics and, simultaneously, on the second- and\nthird-order oscillations of femtoscopy radii. The analysis is done within the\nMonte Carlo event generator HYDJET++, which was extended to dynamical\ntriangular deformations. It is shown that the merely geometric anisotropy\nprovides the results which anticorrelate with the experimental observations of\neither $v_2$ (or $v_3$) or second-order (or third-order) oscillations of the\nfemtoscopy radii. Decays of resonances significantly increase the emitting\nareas but do not change the phases of the radii oscillations. In contrast to\nthe spatial deformations, the dynamical anisotropy alone provides the correct\nqualitative description of the flow and the femtoscopy observables\nsimultaneously. However, one needs both types of the anisotropy to match\nquantitatively the experimental data.\n", "  The production of the X(3872) as a hadronic molecule in hadron colliders is\nclarified. We show that the conclusion of Bignamini et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n103 (2009) 162001, that the production of the X(3872) at high $p_T$ implies a\nnon-molecular structure, does not hold. In particular, using the well\nunderstood properties of the deuteron wave function as an example, we identify\nthe relevant scales in the production process.\n", "  We present a package for Mathematica that facilitates the numerical\ncomputation of the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of a black hole/black brane.\nRequiring as input only the QNM equation(s), the application of a single\nMathematica function will compute the spectrum efficiently, by discretizing the\nequation(s) and solving the resulting generalized eigenvalue equation. It is\napplicable to a large variety of black holes, independent of their asymptotics.\nThe package comes fully documented and with several tutorials. Here we present\na self-contained review of the method and consider several applications. We\nillustrate the method in the simplest case of scalar QNMs of a Schwarzschild\nblack brane in anti-de Sitter. Then we go on to look at the scalar QNMs of the\nSchwarzschild black hole in de Sitter, in anti-de Sitter and in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes, finding a novel infinite set of purely imaginary modes in the\nfirst case. We also derive the QNM equations for a generic\nEinstein-Maxwell-scalar background and use these to compute the QNMs of the\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black brane, as a further\nillustration and check of the method.\n", "  We study the effect of resonant absorption of surface sausage and surface\nkink modes under photospheric conditions where the slow surface sausage modes\nundergo resonant damping in the slow continuum and the surface kink modes in\nthe slow and Alfv\\'{e}n continua at the transitional layers. We use recently\nderived analytical formulas to obtain the damping rate (time). By considering\nlinear density and linear pressure profiles for the transitional layers, we\nshow that resonant absorption in the slow continuum could be an efficient\nmechanism for the wave damping of the slow surface sausage and slow surface\nkink modes whilst the damping rate of the slow surface kink mode in the\nAlfv\\'{e}n continuum is weak. It is also found that the resonant damping of the\nfast surface kink mode is much stronger than that of the slow surface kink\nmode, showing a similar efficiency as under coronal conditions. It is worth to\nnotice that the slow body sausage and kink modes can also resonantly damp in\nthe slow continuum for those linear profiles.\n", "  If a system is driven at finite-rate through a phase transition by varying an\nintensive parameter, the order parameter shatters into finite domains. The\nKibble-Zurek mechanism predicts the typical size of these domains, which are\ngoverned only by the rate of driving and the spatial and dynamical critical\nexponents. We show that also the irreversible entropy production fulfills a\nuniversal behavior, which however is determined by an additional critical\nexponent corresponding to the intensive control parameter. Our universal\nprediction is numerically tested in two systems exhibiting noise-induced phase\ntransitions.\n", "  The NA61/SHINE experiment aims to discover the critical point of strongly\ninteracting matter and study the properties of the onset of deconfinement. For\nthese goals a scan of the two dimensional phase diagram ($T$-$\\mu_{B}$) is\nbeing performed at the SPS by measurements of hadron production in\nproton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions as a function of\ncollision energy and system size. In this contribution preliminary results on\ntransverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations expressed in terms of\nstrongly intensive quantities from the Ar+Sc energy scan will be presented.\nThese fluctuations are expected to be sensitive to the existence of a critical\npoint. The results are compared with results from the p+p and Be+Be energy scan\nas well as with NA49 measurements.\n", "  The diversity of halide materials related to important solar energy systems\nsuch as CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) is explored by introducing the transition metal\nelement Fe. In particular a new compound, Cs3Fe2Br9 (space group P6_3/mmc with\na = 7.5427(8) and c = 18.5849(13) {\\AA}), has been synthesized and found to\ncontain 0D face-sharing Fe2Br9 octahedral dimers. Unlike its isomorph,\nCs3Bi2I9, it is black in color, has a low optical bandgap of 1.65 eV and\nexhibits antiferromagnetic behavior below TN = 13 K. Density functional theory\ncalculations shed further light on these properties and also predict that the\nmaterial should have anisotropic transport characteristics.\n", "  It is common practice in molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo computer\nsimulations to run multiple, separately-initialized simulations in order to\nimprove the sampling of independent microstates. Here we examine the utility of\nan extreme case of this strategy, in which we run a large ensemble of $M$\nindependent simulations (a \"swarm\"), each of which is relaxed to equilibrium.\nWe show that if $M$ is of order $10^3$, we can monitor the swarm's relaxation\nto equilibrium, and confirm its attainment, within $\\sim 10\\bar\\tau$, where\n$\\bar\\tau$ is the equilibrium relaxation time. As soon as a swarm of this size\nattains equilibrium, the ensemble of $M$ final microstates from each run is\nsufficient for the evaluation of most equilibrium properties without further\nsampling. This approach dramatically reduces the wall-clock time required,\ncompared to a single long simulation, by a factor of several hundred, at the\ncost of an increase in the total computational effort by a small factor. It is\nalso well-suited to modern computing systems having thousands of processors,\nand is a viable strategy for simulation studies that need to produce\nhigh-precision results in a minimum of wall-clock time. We present results\nobtained by applying this approach to several test cases.\n", "  Inferences of molecular compositions of exoplanetary atmospheres have\ngenerally focused on C, H, and O-bearing molecules. Recently, additional\nabsorption in HST WFC3 transmission spectra around 1.55$\\mu$m has been\nattributed to nitrogen-bearing chemical species: NH$_3$ or HCN. These species,\nif present in significant abundance, would be strong indicators of\ndisequilibrium chemical processes -- e.g. vertical mixing and photochemistry.\nThe derived N abundance, in turn, could also place important constraints on\nplanetary formation mechanisms. Here, we examine the detectability of nitrogen\nchemistry in exoplanetary atmospheres. In addition to the WFC3 bandpass\n(1.1-1.7$\\mu$m), we find that observations in K-band at $\\sim$2.2$\\mu$m,\nachievable with present ground-based telescopes, sample a strong NH$_3$\nfeature, whilst observations at $\\sim$3.1$\\mu$m and $\\sim$4.0$\\mu$m sample\nstrong HCN features. In anticipation of such observations, we predict\nabsorption feature amplitudes due to nitrogen chemistry in the 1-5$\\mu$m\nspectral range possible for a typical hot Jupiter. Finally, we conduct\natmospheric retrievals of 9 hot Jupiter transmission spectra in search of\nnear-infrared absorption features suggestive of nitrogen chemistry. We report\nweak detections of NH$_3$ in WASP-31b (2.2$\\sigma$), HCN in WASP-63b\n(2.3$\\sigma$), and excess absorption that could be attributed to NH$_3$ in HD\n209458b. High-precision observations from 1-5$\\mu$m (e.g., with the James Webb\nSpace Telescope), will enable definitive detections of nitrogen chemistry, in\nturn serving as powerful diagnostics of disequilibrium atmospheric chemistry\nand planetary formation processes.\n", "  Layered transition metal dichalcogenide WTe$_2$ has recently attracted\nsignificant attention due to the discovery of an extremely large\nmagnetoresistance, a predicted type-II Weyl semimetallic state, and the\npressure-induced superconducting state. By a careful measurement of the\nsuperconducting upper critical fields as a function of the magnetic field angle\nat a pressure as high as 98.5 kbar, we provide the first detailed examination\nof the dimensionality of the superconducting condensate in WTe$_2$. Despite the\nlayered crystal structure, the upper critical field exhibits a negligible field\nanisotropy. The angular dependence of the upper critical field can be\nsatisfactorily described by the anisotropic mass model from 2.2 K\n($T/T_c\\sim0.67$) to 0.03 K ($T/T_c\\sim0.01$), with a practically identical\nanisotropy factor $\\gamma\\sim1.7$. The temperature dependence of the upper\ncritical field, determined for both $H\\perp ab$ and $H\\parallel ab$, can be\nunderstood by a conventional orbital depairing mechanism. Comparison of the\nupper critical fields along the two orthogonal field directions results in the\nsame value of $\\gamma\\sim1.7$, leading to a temperature independent anisotropy\nfactor from near $T_c$ to $<0.01T_c$. Our findings thus identify WTe$_2$ as a\nnearly isotropic superconductor, with an anisotropy factor among one of the\nlowest known in superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  The electron scattering has been a vital tool to study the properties of the\ntarget nucleus for over five decades. Though, the particular interest on\n$^{40}$Ar nucleus stemmed from the progress in the accelerator-based\nneutrino-oscillation experiments. The complexity of nuclei comprising the\ndetectors and their weak response turned out to be one of the major hurdles in\nthe quest of achieving unprecedented precision in these experiments. The\nchallenges are further magnified by the use of Liquid Argon Time Projection\nChambers (LArTPCs) in the short- (SBN) and long-baseline (DUNE) neutrino\nprogram, with almost non-existence electron-argon scattering data and hence\nwith no empirical basis to test and develop nuclear models for $^{40}$Ar. In\nlight of these challenges, an electron-argon experiment, E12-14-012, was\nproposed at Jefferson Lab. The experiment has recently successfully completed\ncollecting data for $(e,e'p)$ and $(e,e')$ processes, not just on $^{40}$Ar but\nalso on $^{48}$Ti, and $^{12}$C targets. While the analysis is running with\nfull steam, in this contribution, we present a brief overview of the\nexperiment.\n", "  The two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) model {[}J. Chem. Phys., \\textbf{119},\n11792 (2003){]} provides a promising paradigm to efficiently determine the\nionic entropies of liquids from molecular dynamics (MD). In this model, the\nvibrational density of states (VDoS) of a liquid is decomposed into a diffusive\ngas-like component and a vibrational solid-like component. By treating the\ndiffusive component as hard sphere (HS) gas and the vibrational component as\nharmonic oscillators, the ionic entropy of the liquid is determined. Here we\nexamine three issues crucial for practical implementations of the 2PT model:\n(i) the mismatch between the VDoS of the liquid system and that of the HS gas;\n(ii) the excess entropy of the HS gas; (iii) the partition of the gas-like and\nsolid-like components. Some of these issues have not been addressed before, yet\nthey profoundly change the entropy predicted from the model. Based on these\nfindings, a revised 2PT formalism is proposed and successfully tested in\nsystems with Lennard-Jones potentials as well as many-atom potentials of liquid\nmetals. Aside from being capable of performing quick entropy estimations for a\nwide range of systems, the formalism also supports fine-tuning to accurately\ndetermine entropies at specific thermal states.\n", "  The coexistence curve and molecule number density of a 4-dimensional AdS\ntopological charged black hole in massive gravity is investigated. We find that\nthe analytic expression of the coexistence curve in the reduced parameter space\nis dependent on theory parameters. This is very different from the previous\nresults obtained in other modified gravity such as $f(R)$ gravity and\nGauss-Bonnet gravity. Besides, we derive the explicit expression of the\nphysical quantity which describes the difference of the number densities of AdS\ntopological charged black hole molecules between the small and large black\nhole. It is observed that the difference of the molecule number densities is\nalso dependent on theory parameters. Both the expressions of the coexistence\ncurve and the difference of the molecule number densities can be reduced into a\nform which is similar to a RN-AdS black hole if the mass of graviton $m$ is\nzero. Moreover, we find the shifted temperature under massive gravity. This can\nhighlight the important role played by the mass of graviton and other\nparameters in the phase transitions of AdS black holes in massive gravity.\n", "  The ability to modify light-matter coupling in time (e.g. using external\npulses) opens up the exciting possibility of generating and probing new aspects\nof quantum correlations in many-body light-matter systems. Here we study the\nimpact of such a pulsed coupling on the light-matter entanglement in the Dicke\nmodel as well as the respective subsystem quantum dynamics. Our dynamical\nmany-body analysis exploits the natural partition between the radiation and\nmatter degrees of freedom, allowing us to explore time-dependent\nintra-subsystem quantum correlations by means of squeezing parameters, and the\ninter-subsystem Schmidt gap for different pulse duration (i.e. ramping\nvelocity) regimes -- from the near adiabatic to the sudden quench limits. Our\nresults reveal that both types of quantities indicate the emergence of the\nsuperradiant phase when crossing the quantum critical point. In addition, at\nthe end of the pulse light and matter remain entangled even though they become\nuncoupled, which could be exploited to generate entangled states in\nnon-interacting systems.\n", "  Achieving international food security requires improved understanding of how\ninternational trade networks connect countries around the world through the\nimport-export flows of food commodities. The properties of food trade networks\nare still poorly documented, especially from a multi-network perspective. In\nparticular, nothing is known about the community structure of food networks,\nwhich is key to understanding how major disruptions or 'shocks' would impact\nthe global food system. Here we find that the individual layers of this network\nhave densely connected trading groups, a consistent characteristic over the\nperiod 2001 to 2011. We also fit econometric models to identify social,\neconomic and geographic factors explaining the probability that any two\ncountries are co-present in the same community. Our estimates indicate that the\nprobability of country pairs belonging to the same food trade community depends\nmore on geopolitical and economic factors -- such as geographical proximity and\ntrade agreements co-membership -- than on country economic size and/or income.\nThis is in sharp contrast with what we know about bilateral-trade determinants\nand suggests that food country communities behave in ways that can be very\ndifferent from their non-food counterparts.\n", "  We fabricate a fiber coupled ultrahigh-Q resonator from a {\\mu}droplet per\nse; and experimentally measure stimulated Raman emission showing itself at a\n160{\\mu}W threshold. We observe Raman-laser lines that agree with their related\ncalculated molecular-vibrations, as well as with a control-group experiment\nthat uses a Raman-spectrometer. Yet, unlike spectrometers where emission is\nspontaneous and less directional, our droplet emitter is stimulated,\nsingle-mode-fiber coupled, resonantly enhanced with Q of 250 million, confined\nto a 23 um3 mode volume and has 7 orders of magnitude higher power.\n", "  Elastic strain engineering utilizes stress to realize unusual material\nproperties. For instance, strain can be used to enhance the electron mobility\nof a semiconductor, enabling more efficient solar cells and smaller, faster\ntransistors. In the context of nanomechanics, the pursuit of resonators with\nultra-high coherence has led to intense study of a complementary strain\nengineering technique, \"dissipation dilution\", whereby the stiffness of a\nmaterial is effectively increased without added loss. Dissipation dilution is\nknown to underlie the anomalously high Q factor of Si$_3$N$_4$ nanomechanical\nresonators, including recently-developed \"soft-clamped\" resonators; however,\nthe paradigm has to date relied on weak strain produced during material\nsynthesis. By contrast, the use of geometric strain engineering techniques --\ncapable of producing local stresses near the material yield strength -- remains\nlargely unexplored. Here we show that geometric strain combined with\nsoft-clamping can produce unprecedentedly high Q nanomechanical resonators.\nSpecifically, using a spatially non-uniform phononic crystal pattern, we\ncolocalize the strain and flexural motion of a Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam, while\nincreasing the former to near the yield strength. This combined strategy\nproduces string-like modes with room-temperature Q$\\times$frequency products\napproaching $10^{15}$ Hz, an unprecedented value for a mechanical oscillator of\nany size. The devices we study can have force sensitivities of aN/rtHz, perform\nhundreds of quantum coherent oscillations at room temperature, and attain Q >\n400 million at radio frequencies. These results signal a paradigm shift in the\ncontrol of nanomechanical dissipation, with impact ranging from precision force\nmicroscopy to tests of quantum gravity. Combining the reported approach with\ncrystalline or 2D materials may lead to further improvement, of as yet unknown\nlimitation.\n", "  For static crystals it is well known that electronic states are doubly\ndegenerate in their spin degree of freedom in the presence of time reversal and\ninversion symmetries. This degeneracy can only be lifted by either (i) breaking\ntime reversal symmetry, for example in a ferromagnet, or (ii) breaking\ninversion symmetry and having spin orbit coupling, for example in the Rashba\neffect. We propose that spin degeneracy can be lifted in time reversal and\ninversion symmetric crystals with a combination of lattice vibrations and\nspin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate this effect in the cubic perovskite\nCsPbCl$_3$ by performing first principles calculations of the finite\ntemperature band structure, which, in accordance with our prediction, undergoes\nspin splitting. We also suggest optical and photoemission experiments to\nexamine our predictions. This new understanding dramatically expands the range\nof materials that can exhibit spin splitting, with potential applications in a\nvariety of technologies such as spintronics and photovoltaics.\n", "  We study the properties of a sample of 3967 LINER galaxies selected from\nSDSS-DR7, respect to their proximity to galaxy groups. The host galaxies of\nLINER have been analysed and compared with a well defined control sample of\n3841 non-LINER galaxies matched in redshift, luminosity, colour, morphology,\nage and stellar mass content. We find no difference between LINER and control\ngalaxies in terms of colour and age of stellar population as function of the\nvirial mass and distance to the geometric centre of the group. However, we find\nthat LINER are more likely to populate low density environments in spite of\ntheir morphology, which is typical of high density regions such as rich galaxy\nclusters. For rich (poor) galaxy groups, the occurrence of LINER is $\\sim$2\ntimes lower (higher) than the occurrence of matched, non-LINER galaxies.\nMoreover, LINER hosts do not seem to follow the expected morphology-density\nrelation in groups of high virial mass. The high frequency of LINERS in low\ndensity regions could be due to the combination of a sufficiently ample gas\nreservoir to power the low ionization emission and/or enhanced galaxy\ninteraction rates benefiting the gas flow toward their central regions.\n", "  Inspired by recent experimental advances to generate Abelian flux for neutral\ncold atoms and photons moving in a lattice, we investigate the possible effects\nof the $ \\pi $ flux through a unit cell in the pseudo-spin 1/2 spinor boson\nHubbard model in a square lattice.\n  We find that the $ \\pi $ flux induces a dramatic interplay between the charge\nand the spin which leads to a frustrated superfluid.\n  We develop a new and systematic \"order from quantum disorder\" analysis to\ndetermine not only the true quantum ground state, but also the excitation\nspectrum.\n  The superfluid ground state has a 4 sublattice $ 90^{\\circ} $ coplanar spin\nstructure which supports 4 linear gapless modes with 3 different velocities.\n  We speculate the transition from the weak coupling frustrated SF to the\nstrong coupling Ferromagnetic Mott state to be in a new universality class of\nnon-Ginsburg Landau type.\n  These novel phenomena may be observed in these recent cold atom and photonic\nexperiments.\n", "  We report an approach for three-dimensional imaging of single vacancies using\nhigh precision quantitative high-angle annular dark-field Z-contrast scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (STEM). Vacancies are identified by both the\nreduction in scattered intensity created by the missing atom and the distortion\nof the surrounding atom positions. Vacancy positions are determined laterally\nto a unique lattice site in the image and in depth to within one of two lattice\nsites by dynamical diffraction effects. 35 single La vacancies are identified\nin images of a LaMnO3 thin film sample. The vacancies are randomly distributed\nin depth and correspond to a La vacancy concentration of 0.79%, which is\nconsistent with the level of control of cation stoichiometry within our\nsynthesis process (~1%) and with the equilibrium concentration of La vacancies\nunder the film growth conditions. This work demonstrates an approach to\ncharacterizing low concentrations of vacancies with high spatial resolution.\n", "  It is well accepted that knowing the composition and the orbital evolution of\nasteroids may help us to understand the process of formation of the Solar\nSystem. It is also known that asteroids can represent a threat to our planet.\nSuch important role made space missions to asteroids a very popular topic in\nthe current astrodynamics and astronomy studies. By taking into account the\nincreasingly interest in space missions to asteroids, especially to multiple\nsystems, we present a study aimed to characterize the stable and unstable\nregions around the triple system of asteroids (45) Eugenia. The goal is to\ncharacterize unstable and stable regions of this system and compare with the\nsystem 2001 SN263 - the target of the ASTER mission. Besides, Prado (2014) used\na new concept for mapping orbits considering the disturbance received by the\nspacecraft from all the perturbing forces individually. This method was also\napplied to (45) Eugenia. We present the stable and unstable regions for\nparticles with relative inclination between 0 and 180 degrees. We found that\n(45) Eugenia presents larger stable regions for both, prograde and retrograde\ncases. This is mainly because the satellites of this system are small when\ncompared to the primary body, and because they are not so close to each other.\nWe also present a comparison between those two triple systems, and a discussion\non how these results may guide us in the planning of future missions.\n", "  In the present paper, we consider the optical design of a zoom system for the\nactive refocusing in laser guide star wavefront sensors. The system is designed\naccording to the specifications coming from the Extremely Large Telescope\n(ELT)-HARMONI instrument, the first-light, integral field spectrograph for the\nEuropean (E)-ELT. The system must provide a refocusing of the laser guide as a\nfunction of telescope pointing and large decentring of the incoming beam. The\nsystem considers four moving lens groups, each of them being a doublet with one\naspherical surface. The advantages and shortcomings of such a solution in terms\nof the component displacements and complexity of the surfaces are described in\ndetail. It is shown that the system can provide the median value of the\nresidual wavefront error of 13.8-94.3 nm and the maximum value <206 nm, while\nthe exit pupil distortion is 0.26-0.36% for each of the telescope pointing\ndirections.\n", "  The work presented at this workshop is divided into two parts. In the first\npart, the mass and decay width of the $\\phi$-meson in cold nuclear matter are\ncomputed in an effective Lagrangian approach. The medium dependence of these\nproperties are obtained by evaluating kaon-antikaon loop contributions to the\n$\\phi$-meson self-energy, employing medium-modified kaon masses calculated\nusing the quark-meson coupling model. The loop integral is regularized with a\ndipole form factor, and the sensitivity of the results to the choice of cutoff\nmass in the form factor is investigated. At normal nuclear matter density, we\nfind a downward shift of the $\\phi$ mass by a few percent, while the decay\nwidth is enhanced by an order of magnitude.\n  Our results support the literature which suggest that one should observe a\nsmall downward mass shift and a large broadening of the decay width. In the\nsecond part, we present $\\phi$-meson--nucleus bound state energies and\nabsorption widths for four selected nuclei, calculated by solving the\nKlein-Gordon equation with complex optical potentials. The attractive potential\nfor the $\\phi$-meson in the nuclear medium originates from the in-medium\nenhanced KK loop in the $\\phi$-meson selfenergy. The results suggest that the\n$\\phi$-meson should form bound states with all the nuclei considered. However,\nthe identification of the signal for these predicted bound states will need\ncareful investigation because of their sizable absorption widths.\n", "  Diffusion processes in a social system are governed by external triggers and\ninternal excitations via interactions between individuals over social networks.\nUnderlying mechanisms are crucial to understand emergent phenomena in the real\nworld and accordingly establish effective strategies. However, it is\nchallenging to reveal the dynamics of a target diffusion process due to\ninvisible causality between events and their time-evolving intensity. In this\nstudy, we propose the Latent Influence Point Process model (LIPP) by\nincorporating external heterogeneity and internal dynamics of meta-populations\nbased on human mobility. Our proposed model quantifies the reflexivity of a\nsocial system, which is the level of feedback on event occurrences by its\ninternal dynamics. As an exemplary case study, we investigate dengue outbreaks\nin Queensland, Australia during the last 15 years. We find that abrupt and\nsteady growth of disease outbreaks relate to exogenous and endogenous\ninfluences respectively. Similar diffusion trends between regions reflect\nsynchronous reflexivity of a regional social system, likely driven by human\nmobility.\n", "  We consider the free energy of the bipartite spherical\nSherrington--Kirkpatrick model. We find the critical temperature and prove the\nlimiting free energy for all non-critical temperature. We also show that the\nlaw of the fluctuation of the free energy converges to the Gaussian\ndistribution when the temperature is above the critical temperature, and to the\nGOE Tracy--Widom distribution when the temperature is below the critical\ntemperature. The result is universal, and the analysis is applicable to a more\ngeneral setting including the case where the disorders are non-identically\ndistributed.\n", "  Using the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), we\nmap the temporal variability of water ice absorption bands over the near-polar\nice mound in Louth crater, Mars. The absorption band depth of water ice at 1.5\nmicrons can be used as a proxy for ice grain size and so sudden reductions can\ntime any switches from ablation to condensation. A short period of deposition\non the outer edge of the ice mound during late spring coincides with the\ndisappearance of seasonal water frost from the surrounding regolith suggesting\nthat this deposition is locally sourced. The outer unit at Louth ice mound\ndiffers from its central regions by being rough, finely layered, and lacking\nwind-blown sastrugi. This suggests we are observing a new stabilizing effect\nwherein the outer unit is being seasonally replenished with water ice from the\nsurrounding regolith during spring. We observe the transport distance for water\nmigration at Louth crater to be ~4km, and we use this new finding to address\nwhy no water ice mounds are observed in craters <9km in diameter.\n", "  Recent results on the slope of the $pp$ diffraction cone measured by TOTEM at\n$7$ and $8$ GeV show an unexpected rapid rise in $s$, close to $B(s)\\sim\n\\ln^2$, rather than $\\ln s$, typical of the Regge-pole predictions. We show\nthat the new phenomenon can be accommodated by the inclusion of unitarity\ncorrections to a simple Regge (pomeron) pole exchange. Interestingly, the\nodderon may also promote the acceleration of $B(s)$. The onset of the new\nregime may be indicative of the approach to the asymptotic dynamics of strong\ninteractions. We analyse the new data together with other available forward\nmeasurable in a unitarized Regge dipole. Unitarization proves crucial in\nfitting the data, especially those on the slope $B(s)$ showing a change from\nthe $\\ln (s)$ to $\\ln^2 (s)$ behavior. Having fitted the free parameters of the\nunitarized model to the data, we predict the behavior of the cross sections and\nthe slope at still higher energies, including those asymptotic.\n", "  We present the results obtained from the analysis of dynamic fibrils in NOAA\nactive region (AR) 12132, using high resolution H$\\alpha$ observations from New\nSolar Telescope operating at BBSO. The dynamic fibrils are seen to be moving up\nand down, and most of these dynamic fibrils are periodic and have jet like\nappearance. We found from our observations that the fibrils follows perfect\nparabolic paths at the most in many cases. A statistical measure on the\nproperties of the parabolic paths showing an analysis on deceleration, maximum\nvelocity, duration and kinetic energy of these fibrils is presented here. We\nfound the average maximum velocity to be around 15 km s$^{-1}$ and mean\ndeceleration to be around 100 m s$^{-2}$. The deceleration observed appears to\nbe a fraction of gravity of sun and is not compatible with the path of\nballistic at the gravity of sun. We found positive correlation between the\ndeceleration and the maximum velocity. This correlation is consistent with the\nsimulations done earlier on magnetoacoustic shock waves propagating upward.\n", "  The Galactic center offers us a unique opportunity to test General Relativity\n(GR) with the orbits of stars around a supermassive black hole. Observations of\nthese stars have been one of the great successes of adaptive optics on 8-10 m\ntelescopes, driving the need for the highest angular resolution and astrometric\nprecision. New tests of gravitational physics in the strong gravity regime with\nstellar orbits will be made possible through the leap in angular resolution and\nsensitivity from the next generation of extremely large ground-based\ntelescopes. We present new simulations of specific science cases such as the\ndetection of the GR precession of stars, the measurement of extended dark mass,\nand the distance to the Galactic center. We use realistic models of the\nadaptive optics system for TMT and the IRIS instrument to simulate these\nscience cases. In additions, the simulations include observational issues such\nas the impact of source confusion on astrometry and radial velocities in the\ndense environment of the Galactic center. We qualitatively show how\nimprovements in sensitivity, astrometric and spectroscopic precision, and\nincreasing the number of stars affect the science with orbits at the Galactic\ncenter. We developed a tool to determine the constraints on physical models\nusing a joint fit of over 100 stars that are expected to be observable with\nTMT. These science cases require very high astrometric precision and stability,\nthus they provide some of the most stringent constraints on the planned\ninstruments and adaptive optics systems.\n", "  Marangoni self-contracted droplets are formed by a mixture of two liquids,\none of larger surface tension and larger evaporation rate than the other. Due\nto evaporation, the droplets contract to a stable contact angle instead of\nspreading on a wetting substrate. This gives them unique properties, including\nabsence of pinning force and ability to move under vapor gradients, self- and\nexternally imposed. We first model the dynamics of attraction in an unconfined\ngeometry and then study the effects of confinement on the attraction range and\ndynamics, going from minimal confinement (vertical boundary), to medium\nconfinement (2-D vapor diffusion) and eventually strong confinement (1-D).\n\"Self-induced\" motion is observed when single droplets are placed close to a\nvapor boundary toward which they are attracted, the boundary acting as an image\ndroplet with respect to itself. When two droplets are confined between two\nhorizontal plates, they interact at a longer distance with modified dynamics.\nFinally, confining the droplet in a tunnel, the range of attraction is greatly\nenhanced, as the droplet moves all the way up the tunnel when an external\nhumidity gradient is imposed. \"Self-induced\" motion is also observed, as the\ndroplet can move by itself towards the center of the tunnel. Confinement\ngreatly increase the range at which droplets interact as well as their lifetime\nand thus greatly expands the control and design possibilities for applications\noffered by self-contracted droplets.\n", "  Since the concept of spin superconductor was proposed, all the related\nstudies concentrate on spin-polarized case. Here, we generalize the study to\nspin-non-polarized case. The free energy of non-polarized spin superconductor\nis obtained, and the Ginzburg-Landau-type equations are derived by using the\nvariational method. These Ginzburg-Landau-type equations can be reduced to the\nspin-polarized case when the spin direction is fixed. Moreover, the expressions\nof super linear and angular spin currents inside the superconductor are\nderived. We demonstrate that the electric field induced by super spin current\nis equal to the one induced by equivalent charge obtained from the second\nGinzburg-Landau-type equation, which shows self-consistency of our theory. By\napplying these Ginzburg-Landau-type equations, the effect of electric field on\nthe superconductor is also studied. These results will help us get a better\nunderstanding of the spin superconductor and the related topics such as\nBose-Einstein condensate of magnons and spin superfluidity.\n", "  We study spin transport through a normal metal-spin superconductor junction.\nA spin-flip reflection is demonstrated at the interface, where a spin-up\nelectron incident from the normal metal can be reflected as a spin-down\nelectron and the spin $2\\times \\hbar/2$ will be injected into the spin\nsuperconductor. When the (spin) voltage is smaller than the gap of the spin\nsuperconductor, the spin-flip reflection determines the transport properties of\nthe junction. We consider both graphene-based (linear-dispersion-relation) and\nquadratic-dispersion-relation normal metal-spin superconductor junctions in\ndetail. For the two-dimensional graphene-based junction, the spin-flip\nreflected electron can be along the specular direction (retro-direction) when\nthe incident and reflected electron locates in the same band (different bands).\nA perfect spin-flip reflection can occur when the incident electron is normal\nto the interface, and the reflection coefficient is slightly suppressed for the\noblique incident case. As a comparison, for the one-dimensional\nquadratic-dispersion-relation junction, the spin-flip reflection coefficient\ncan reach 1 at certain incident energies. In addition, both the charge current\nand the spin current under a charge (spin) voltage are studied. The spin\nconductance is proportional to the spin-flip reflection coefficient when the\nspin voltage is less than the gap of the spin superconductor. These results\nwill help us get a better understanding of spin transport through the normal\nmetal-spin superconductor junction.\n", "  Swarm robotic systems are currently being used to address many real-world\nproblems. One interesting application of swarm robotics is the self-organized\nformation of structures and shapes. Some of the key challenges in the swarm\nrobotic systems include swarm size constraint, random motion, coordination\namong robots, localization, and adaptability in a decentralized environment.\nRubenstein et al. presented a system (\"Programmable self-assembly in a\nthousand-robot swarm\", Science, 2014) for thousand-robot swarm able to form\nonly solid shapes with the robots in aggregated form by applying the collective\nbehavior algorithm. Even though agent-based approaches have been presented in\nvarious studies for self-organized formation, however these studies lack\nagent-based modeling (ABM) approach along with the constraints in term of\nstructure complexity and heterogeneity in large swarms with dynamic\nlocalization. The cognitive agent-based computing (CABC) approach is capable of\nmodeling such self-organization based multi-agents systems (MAS). In this\npaper, we develop a simulation model using ABM under CABC approach for\nself-organized shape formation in swarm robots. We propose a shape formation\nalgorithm for validating our model and perform simulation-based experiments for\nsix different shapes including hole-based shapes. We also demonstrate the\nformal specification for our model. The simulation result shows the robustness\nof the proposed approach having the emergent behavior of robots for the\nself-organized shape formation. The performance of the proposed approach is\nevaluated by robots convergence rate.\n", "  Since the spatially extended periodic parity-time (PT) symmetric potential\ncan possess certain unique properties compared to a single PT cell (with only a\npair of coupled gain-loss components), various schemes have been proposed to\nrealize periodic PT-symmetric potentials based on optical lattices. Here, we\nexperimentally construct a spatially periodic PT-symmetric optical potential\nbased on gain-loss arrays induced in a coherently-prepared atomic medium. The\ngain and loss arrays are generated in alternating four-level N-type and\nthree-level $\\Lambda$-type configurations in the same atomic medium,\nrespectively, which do not require discrete diffractions as demonstrated in the\nprevious work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 123601(2016)] and can be easier to realize\nwith more relaxed operating conditions. The dynamical behaviors of the system\nare investigated by measuring the phase difference between two adjacent gain\nand loss channels. The demonstrated PT-symmetric optical lattice with easy\naccessibility and better tunability sets a new stage for further exploiting the\npeculiar physical properties in periodic non-Hermitian systems.\n", "  Interfaces remain one of the major issues in limiting the understanding and\ndesigning polymer nanocomposites due to their complexity and pivotal role in\ndetermining the ultimate composites properties. In this study, we take\nmulti-walled carbon nanotubes/silicone rubber nanocomposites as a\nrepresentative example, and have for the first time studied the correlation\nbetween high-frequency dielectric dispersion and static/dynamic interfacial\ncharacteristics. We have found that the interface together with other\nmeso-structural parameters (volume fraction, dispersion, agglomeration) play\ndecisive role in formulating the dielectric patterns. The calculation of the\nrelaxation times affords the relative importance of interfacial polarization to\ndipolar polarization in resultant dielectric relaxation. Dielectric\nmeasurements coupled with cyclic loading further reveals the remarkable\ncapability of dielectric frequency dispersion in capturing the evolution of\ninterfacial properties, such as a particular interface reconstruction process\noccurred to the surfactant-modified samples. All these results demonstrate that\nhigh-frequency dielectric spectroscopy is instrumental to probing both static\nand dynamic meso-structural characteristics, especially effective for the\ncomposites with relative weak interfaces which remains a mission impossible for\nmany other techniques. The insights provided here based on the analyses of\ndielectric frequency dispersion will pave the way for optimized design and\nprecise engineering of meso-structure in polymer nanocomposites.\n", "  The finite-nuclear size correction to the fine structure of muonic atoms are\nconsidered. The procedure for the analytical calculation of the energies and\nwave functions has been derived in a homogeneously charged sphere nuclear\ncharge distribution approximation. The finite-nuclear size effect was\ncalculated in a first few orders of the perturbation energy, with the accurate\nestimations of the convergence. Finally, we present energies of the low-lying\nelectronic and muonic states with the finite-nuclear size correction,\ncalculated analytically, for ${}^{185}_{75}\\text{Re}$ ion.\n", "  We report on the design and performance of a mixed-signal application\nspecific integrated circuit (ASIC) dedicated to avalanche photodiodes (APDs) in\norder to detect hard X-ray emissions in a wide energy band onboard the\nInternational Space Station. To realize wide-band detection from 20 keV to 1\nMeV, we use Ce:GAGG scintillators, each coupled to an APD, with low-noise\nfront-end electronics capable of achieving a minimum energy detection threshold\nof 20 keV. The developed ASIC has the ability to read out 32-channel APD\nsignals using 0.35 $\\mu$m CMOS technology, and an analog amplifier at the input\nstage is designed to suppress the capacitive noise primarily arising from the\nlarge detector capacitance of the APDs. The ASIC achieves a performance of 2099\ne$^{-}$ + 1.5 e$^{-}$/pF at root mean square (RMS) with a wide 300 fC dynamic\nrange. Coupling a reverse-type APD with a Ce:GAGG scintillator, we obtain an\nenergy resolution of 6.7% (FWHM) at 662 keV and a minimum detectable energy of\n20 keV at room temperature (20 $^{\\circ}$C). Furthermore, we examine the\nradiation tolerance for space applications by using a 90 MeV proton beam,\nconfirming that the ASIC is free of single-event effects and can operate\nproperly without serious degradation in analog and digital processing.\n", "  We unveil the geometric nature of the multiplet of fundamental fermions in\nthe Standard Model of fundamental particles as a noncommutative analogue of de\nRham forms on the internal finite quantum space.\n", "  The method is based on four fundamental features. The total spin precession\nfrequency in the vertical plane due to the electric and magnetic dipole moments\nin an imperfect ring in a vertical plane is measured. The position of the ring\nelements is unchanged from clockwise to counter-clockwise operation. The\ncalibration of the effective Lorentz factor using the polarization precession\nfrequency measurement in the horizontal plane is carried out alternately in\neach CW and CCW operation. And the approximate relationship between the\nfrequencies of the polarization precession in different planes is set to\nexclude them from mixing to the vertical frequency of the expected EDM signal\nat a sensitivity level approaching $10^{-29}$ $e\\cdot cm$.\n", "  We add a confining potential to the Aharonov-Bohm model resulting in no\ncontact of the particle with the solenoid (border); this is characterized by a\nunique self-adjoint extension of the initial Hamiltonian operator. It is shown\nthat the spectrum of such extension is discrete and the first eigenvalue is\nfound to be a nonconstant 1-periodic function of the magnetic flux circulation\nwith a minimum at integers and maximum at half-integer circulations. This is a\nrigorous verification of the effect.\n", "  Motivated by string theory and standard model physics, we discuss the\npossibility of other particles-based quantum information. A special attention\nis put on the consideration of the graviton in light of the gravitational wave\ndetection. This may offer a new take in approaching quantum information using\nmessenger particles. The construction is readily extended to higher dimensional\nqubits where we speculate on possible connections with open and closed string\nsectors in terms of quiver and graph theories, respectively. In particular, we\nreveal that the vectorial qubits could be associated with skeleton diagrams\nconsidered as extended quivers.\n", "  In an effort to achieve our aims (getting larger quantum system) in the\nrecent reformulation of quantum mechanics without potential function [1-5], we\nobtained a new quantum system associated with Meixner Pollaczek Orthogonal\npolynomial class (hereby called Meixner - Pollaczek Quantum system). The energy\nspectrum and wave function of the quantum system were given. To the best of our\nknowledge, this quantum system is not found in physics literatures.\n", "  In this paper we deal with the well-known nonlinear Lorenz system that\ndescribes the deterministic chaos phenomenon. We consider an interesting\nproblem with time-varying phenomena in quantum optics. Then we establish from\nthe motion equations the passage to the Lorenz system. Furthermore, we show\nthat the reduction to the third order non linear equation can be performed.\nTherefore, the obtained differential equation can be analytically solved in\nsome special cases and transformed to Abel, Dufing, Painlev\\'{e} and\ngeneralized Emden-Fowler equations. So, a motivating technique that permitted a\ncomplete and partial integrability of the Lorenz system is presented.\n", "  Recent work has shown that the planets in the $Kepler$ Mission's population\nof multi-transiting systems show surprising uniformity in both mass and radius.\nIn this brief note, I show that this intra-system mass uniformity extends to\nmultiple-planet systems detected with the Doppler velocity technique, thereby\navoiding possible biases associated with masses determined by transit timing. I\nalso show that intra-system mass uniformity breaks down when a system contains\none or more giant planets.\n", "  Variational analysis techniques in lattice QCD are powerful tools that give\naccess to the full spectrum of QCD. At zero momentum, these techniques are well\nestablished and can cleanly isolate energy eigenstates of either positive or\nnegative parity. In order to compute the form factors of a single energy\neigenstate, we must perform a variational analysis at non-zero momentum. When\nwe do this with baryons, we run into issues with parity mixing in the Dirac\nspinors, as boosted baryons are not eigenstates of parity. Due to this parity\nmixing, care must be taken to ensure that the projected correlation functions\nprovided by the variational analysis correspond to the same states at zero\nmomentum. This can be achieved through the parity-expanded variational analysis\n(PEVA) technique, a novel method developed at the University of Adelaide for\nensuring the successful and consistent isolation of boosted baryons. Utilising\nthis technique, we are able to compute the form factors of baryon excitations\nwithout contamination from other states. We present world-first calculations of\nexcited state nucleon form factors using this new technique.\n", "  Raman scattering spectra of zigzag spin chain TaFe$_{1.25}$Te$_3$ single\ncrystal are presented in a temperature range from 80 to 300 K. Nine Raman\nactive modes of $A_g$ and $B_g$ symmetry are clearly observed and assigned by\nprobing different scattering channels, which is confirmed by lattice dynamics\ncalculations. Temperature dependence of the Raman modes linewidth is mainly\ngoverned by the lattice anharmonicity. The only deviation from the conventional\nbehavior is observed for $A_g$ symmetry modes in a vicinity of the magnetic\nphase transition at $T_N \\approx 200$ K. This implies that the electron-phonon\ninteraction weakly changes with temperature and magnetic ordering, whereas\nsmall changes in the spectra near the critical temperature can be ascribed to\nspin fluctuations.\n", "  In this QCD analysis, we investigate the impact of recent measurements of\nheavy-flavor charm and beauty cross sections data sets on the simultaneous\ndetermination of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and the strong coupling,\n$\\alpha_s(M^2_Z)$. We perform three different fits based on Variable-Flavour\nNumber Scheme (VFNS) at the Leading Order (LO) and Next-to-Leading Order (NLO)\nand choose the full HERA run I and II combined data as a new measurement of\ninclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) cross sections for our base data set.\nWe show that including charm and beauty cross sections data reduces the\nuncertainty of gluon distribution and improves the fit quality up to 4.1\\% from\nleading order to next-to-leading order and up to 1.7\\% for only NLO without and\nwith beauty and charm data contributions.\n", "  Research-based assessments (RBAs), such as the Force Concept Inventory, have\nplayed central roles in many course transformations from traditional\nlecture-based instruction to research-based teaching methods. In order to\nsupport instructors in assessing their courses, the online Learning About STEM\nStudent Outcomes (LASSO) platform simplifies administering, scoring, and\ninterpreting RBAs. Reducing the barriers to using RBAs will support more\ninstructors in objectively assessing the efficacy of their courses and,\nsubsequently, transforming their courses to improve student outcomes. The\npurpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which RBAs administered\nonline and outside of class with the LASSO platform provided equivalent data to\ntraditional paper and pencil tests administered in class. Research indicates\nthat these two modes of administering assessments provide equivalent data for\ngraded exams that are administered in class. However, little research has\nfocused on ungraded (low-stakes) exams that are administered outside of class.\nWe used an experimental design to investigate the differences between these two\ntest modes. Results indicated that the LASSO platform provided equivalent data\nto paper and pencil tests.\n", "  High-stakes assessments, such the Graduate Records Examination, have\ntransitioned from paper to computer administration. Low-stakes Research-Based\nAssessments (RBAs), such as the Force Concept Inventory, have only recently\nbegun this transition to computer administration with online services. These\nonline services can simplify administering, scoring, and interpreting\nassessments, thereby reducing barriers to instructors' use of RBAs. By\nsupporting instructors' objective assessment of the efficacy of their courses,\nthese services can stimulate instructors to transform their courses to improve\nstudent outcomes. We investigate the extent to which RBAs administered outside\nof class with the online Learning About STEM Student Outcomes (LASSO) platform\nprovide equivalent data to tests administered on paper in class, in terms of\nboth student participation and performance. We use an experimental design to\ninvestigate the differences between these two assessment conditions with 1,310\nstudents in 25 sections of 3 college physics courses spanning 2 semesters.\nAnalysis conducted using Hierarchical Linear Models indicates that student\nperformance on low-stakes RBAs is equivalent for online (out-of-class) and\npaper-and-pencil (in-class) administrations. The models also show differences\nin participation rates across assessment conditions and student grades, but\nthat instructors can achieve participation rates with online assessments\nequivalent to paper assessments by offering students credit for participating\nand by providing multiple reminders to complete the assessment. We conclude\nthat online out-of-class administration of RBAs can save class and instructor\ntime while providing participation rates and performance results equivalent to\nin-class paper-and-pencil tests.\n", "  We present in this document the Lebesgue and Sobolev propagation of\nexponential tails for solutions of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation for hard\nand Maxwell interactions. In addition, we show the $L^{p}$-integrability\ncreation of such tails in the case of hard interactions. The document also\npresents a result on exponentially-fast convergence to thermodynamical\nequilibrium and propagation of singularities and regularization of such\nsolutions. All these results are valid under the mere Grad's cut-off condition\nfor the angular scattering kernel. Highlights of this contribution include: (1)\nfull range of $L^{p}$-norms with $p\\in[1,\\infty]$, (2) analysis for the\ncritical case of Maxwell interactions, (3) propagation of fractional Sobolev\nexponential tails using pointwise conmutators, and (4) time asymptotic and\npropagation of regularity and singularities under general physical data. In\nmany ways, this work is an improvement and an extension of several classical\nworks in the area; we use known techniques and introduce new and flexible ideas\nthat achieve the proofs in an elementary manner.\n", "  Optical nanoantennas can efficiently confine light into nanoscopic hotspots,\nenabling single-molecule detection sensitivity at biological relevant\nconditions. This innovative approach to breach the diffraction limit offers a\nversatile platform to investigate the dynamics of individual biomolecules in\nliving cell membranes and their partitioning into cholesterol-dependent lipid\nnanodomains. Here, we present optical nanoantenna arrays with accessible\nsurface hotspots to study the characteristic diffusion dynamics of\nphosphoethanolamine (PE) and sphingomyelin (SM) in the plasma membrane of\nliving cells at the nanoscale. Fluorescence burst analysis and fluorescence\ncorrelation spectroscopy performed on nanoantennas of different gap sizes show\nthat, unlike PE, SM is transiently trapped in cholesterol-enriched nanodomains\nof 10 nm diameter with short characteristic times around 100 {\\mu}s. The\nremoval of cholesterol led to the free diffusion of SM, consistent with the\ndispersion of nanodomains. Our results are consistent with the existence of\nhighly transient and fluctuating nanoscale assemblies enriched by cholesterol\nand sphingolipids in living cell membranes, also known as lipid rafts.\nQuantitative data on sphingolipids partitioning into lipid rafts is crucial to\nunderstand the spatiotemporal heterogeneous organization of transient molecular\ncomplexes on the membrane of living cells at the nanoscale. The proposed\ntechnique is fully biocompatible and thus provides various opportunities for\nbiophysics and live cell research to reveal details that remain hidden in\nconfocal diffraction-limited measurements.\n", "  Many unconventional quantum matters, such as fractional quantum Hall effect\nand $d$-wave high-Tc superconductor, are discovered in strongly interacting\nsystems. Understanding quantum many-body systems with strong interaction and\nthe unconventional phases therein is one of the most challenging problems in\nphysics nowadays. Cold atom systems possess a natural way to create strong\ninteraction by bringing the system to the vicinity of a scattering resonance.\nAlthough this has been a focused topic in cold atom physics for more than a\ndecade, these studies have so far mostly been limited for $s$-wave resonance.\nHere we report the experimental observation of a broad $d$-wave shape resonance\nin degenerate ${}^{41}$K gas. We further measure the molecular binding energy\nthat splits into three branches as a hallmark of $d$-wave molecules, and find\nthat the lifetime of this many-body system is reasonably long at strongly\ninteracting regime. From analyzing the breathing mode excited by ramping\nthrough this resonance, it suggests that a quite stable low-temperature atom\nand molecule mixture is produced. Putting all the evidence together, our system\noffers great promise to reach a $d$-wave molecular superfluid.\n", "  The isothermal nucleation kinetics in Al-Sm metallic glasses with low Sm\nconcentrations (xSm) was studied using molecular dynamics simulations in order\nto calculate time-temperature-transformation curves. The average delay time of\nAl nanocrystal nucleation was found to increase exponentially with xSm, whereas\nthe estimated critical cooling rate necessary to avoid crystallization\ndecreases exponentially with xSm. Sm solutes were found to suppress Al\nnucleation by increasing the attachment barrier and therefore by reducing the\nattachment frequency. The analysis shows that the attachment of Al to the\nevolving nucleus has the same characteristics as Al diffusion within the\namorphous matrix and they both take place heterogeneously via collective\nmovement of a group of Al atoms.\n", "  Liquid crystalline phases of matter permeate nature and technology, with\nexamples ranging from cell membranes to liquid-crystal displays. Remarkably,\nelectronic liquid crystal phases can exist in two-dimensional electron systems\n(2DES) at half Landau level filling in the quantum Hall regime. Theory has\npredicted the existence of a liquid crystal smectic phase that breaks both\nrotational and translational symmetries. However, previous experiments in 2DES\nare most consistent with an anisotropic nematic phase breaking only rotational\nsymmetry. Here we report three transport phenomena at half-filling in ultra-low\ndisorder 2DES: a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the sample resistance,\ndramatic onset of large time-dependent resistance fluctuations, and a sharp\nfeature in the differential resistance suggestive of depinning. These data\nsuggest that a sequence of symmetry-breaking phase transitions occurs as\ntemperature is lowered: first a transition from an isotropic liquid to a\nnematic phase and finally to a liquid crystal smectic phase.\n", "  Security for machine learning has begun to become a serious issue for present\nday applications. An important question remaining is whether emerging quantum\ntechnologies will help or hinder the security of machine learning. Here we\ndiscuss a number of ways that quantum information can be used to help make\nquantum classifiers more secure or private. In particular, we demonstrate a\nform of robust principal component analysis that, under some circumstances, can\nprovide an exponential speedup relative to robust methods used at present. To\ndemonstrate this approach we introduce a linear combinations of unitaries\nHamiltonian simulation method that we show functions when given an imprecise\nHamiltonian oracle, which may be of independent interest. We also introduce a\nnew quantum approach for bagging and boosting that can use quantum\nsuperposition over the classifiers or splits of the training set to aggregate\nover many more models than would be possible classically. Finally, we provide a\nprivate form of $k$--means clustering that can be used to prevent an all\npowerful adversary from learning more than a small fraction of a bit from any\nuser. These examples show the role that quantum technologies can play in the\nsecurity of ML and vice versa. This illustrates that quantum computing can\nprovide useful advantages to machine learning apart from speedups.\n", "  We compute the magneto-conductance of a short junction made out of a Weyl\nsemi-metal. We show that it displays quantum oscillations at low magnetic field\nand low temperature, before reaching a universal high-field regime where it\nincreases linearly with the field. Besides identifying a new characterization\nof the physics of materials with Weyl singularities in their energy spectrum,\nthis ballistic regime corresponds to the simplest setup to study and understand\nthe manifestation of the so-called chiral anomaly of massless relativistic\nparticles in condensed matter. At low fields the algebraic in field\nmagneto-conductance incorporates contributions besides the anomalous chiral\ncurrent while the linear conductance at higher fields constitutes an\nunambiguous signature of the chiral anomaly in a Weyl conductor. Finally, we\nstudy the dependence of the ballistic magneto-conductance on the chemical\npotential, and discuss the cross-over towards the diffusive regime when elastic\nscattering is present.\n", "  In this work, we report on the atom probe tomography analysis of two metallic\nhydrides formed by pressurized charging using an ex situ hydrogen charging\ncell, in the pressure range of 200-500 kPa (2-5 bar). Specifically we report on\nthe deuterium charging of Pd/Rh and V systems. Using this ex situ system, we\ndemonstrate the successful loading and subsequent atom probe analysis of\ndeuterium within a Pd/Rh alloy, and demonstrate that deuterium is likely\npresent within the oxide-metal interface of a native oxide formed on vanadium.\nThrough these experiments, we demonstrate the feasibility of ex situ hydrogen\nanalysis for hydrides via atom probe tomography, and thus a practical route to\nthree-dimensional imaging of hydrogen in hydrides at the atomic scale.\n", "  The installation of a new sub-detector has improved the ability of LHCb to\nmeasure central exclusive production in Run 2 at the LHC. A measurement of\ncentral exclusive $J/\\psi$ production is presented and improvements for the\nanalysis of hadronic final states are discussed.\n"]}
