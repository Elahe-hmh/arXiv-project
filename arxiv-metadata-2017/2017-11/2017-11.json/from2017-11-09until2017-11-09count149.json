In 2002,\nProfessors Gudder and Greechie proved that each $\\sigma$-sequential effect\nalgebra is sharply dominating. In 2005, Professor Gudder presented 25 open\nproblems in International Journal of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 44, 2199-2205,\nthe 3th problem asked: Is each sequential effect algebra sharply dominating?\nNow, we construct an example to answer the problem negatively.\n", "  A sequential effect algebra $(E,0,1, \\oplus, \\circ)$ is an effect algebra on\nwhich a sequential product $\\circ$ with certain physics properties is defined,\nin particular, sequential effect algebra is an important model for studying\nquantum measurement theory. In 2005, Gudder asked the following problem: If $a,\nb\\in (E,0,1,\\oplus, \\circ)$ and $a\\bot b$ and $a\\circ b\\bot a\\circ b$, is it\nthe case that $2(a\\circ b)\\leq a^2\\oplus b^2$ ? In this paper, we construct an\nexample to answer the problem negatively.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate the explicit expression for the fugacity for two-\nand three-dimensional weakly interacting Bose and Fermi gases from their\nequations of state in isochoric and isobaric processes, respectively, based on\nthe mathematical result of the boundary problem of analytic functions --- the\nhomogeneous Riemann-Hilbert problem. We also discuss the Bose-Einstein\ncondensation phase transition of three-dimensional hard-sphere Bose gases.\n", "  In this paper, we study generalized quantum operations and almost sharp\nquantum effects, our results generalize and improve some important conclusions\nin [2] and [3].\n", "  By using the sequential effect algebra theory, we establish the partitions\nand refinements of quantum logics and study their entropies.\n", "  We prove that the interval topology of an Archimedean atomic lattice effect\nalgebra $E$ is Hausdorff whenever the set of all atoms of $E$ is almost\northogonal. In such a case $E$ is order continuous. If moreover $E$ is complete\nthen order convergence of nets of elements of $E$ is topological and hence it\ncoincides with convergence in the order topology and this topology is compact\nHausdorff compatible with a uniformity induced by a separating function family\non $E$ corresponding to compact and cocompact elements. For block-finite\nArchimedean atomic lattice effect algebras the equivalence of almost\northogonality and s-compact generation is shown. As the main application we\nobtain the state smearing theorem for these effect algebras, as well as the\ncontinuity of $\\oplus$-operation in the order and interval topologies on them.\n", "  In this paper, the following results are proved: (1) $ $ If $E$ is a complete\natomic lattice effect algebra, then $E$ is (o)-continuous iff $E$ is\norder-topological iff $E$ is totally order-disconnected iff $E$ is algebraic.\n(2) $ $ If $E$ is a complete atomic distributive lattice effect algebra, then\nits Frink ideal topology $\\tau_{id}$ is Hausdorff topology and $\\tau_{id}$ is\nfiner than its order topology $\\tau_{o}$, and $\\tau_{id}=\\tau_o$ iff 1 is\nfinite iff every element of $E$ is finite iff $\\tau_{id}$ and $\\tau_o$ are both\ndiscrete topologies. (3) $ $ If $E$ is a complete (o)-continuous lattice effect\nalgebra and the operation $\\oplus$ is order topology $\\tau_o$ continuous, then\nits order topology $\\tau_{o}$ is Hausdorff topology. (4) $ $ If $E$ is a\n(o)-continuous complete atomic lattice effect algebra, then $\\oplus$ is order\ntopology continuous.\n", "  Using the general sequential product proposed by Shen and Wu in [J. Phys. A:\nMath. Theor. 42, 345203, 2009], we derive three criteria for describing\nnon-disturbance between quantum measurements that may be unsharp with such new\nsequential products, which generalizes Gudder's results.\n", "  In a recent study we demonstrated the emergence of turbulence in a trapped\nBose-Einstein condensate of Rb-87 atoms. An intriguing observation in such a\nsystem is the behavior of the turbulent cloud during free expansion.The aspect\nratio of the cloud size does not change in the way one would expect for an\nordinary non-rotating (vortex-free) condensate. Here we show that the anomalous\nexpansion can be understood, at least qualitatively, in terms of the presence\nof vorticity distributed throughout the cloud, effectively counteracting the\nusual reversal of the aspect ratio seen in free time-of-flight expansion of\nnon-rotating condensates.\n", "  To further understand their nature, micro cavitation bubbles were\nsystematically diffused around the exterior of a test body (tube) fully\nsubmerged in a water tank. The primary purpose was to assess the feasibility of\napplying micro cavitation as a means of depth control for underwater vehicles,\nmainly but not limited to submarines. Ideally, the results would indicate the\nuse of micro cavitation as a more efficient alternative to underwater vehicle\ndepth control than the conventional ballast tank method. The current approach\nutilizes the Archimedes' principle of buoyancy to alter the density of the\nobject affected, making it less than, or greater than the density of the\nsurrounding fluid. However, this process is too slow for underwater vehicles to\nreact to sudden obstacles inherent in their environment. Rather than altering\nits internal density, this experiment aimed to investigate the response that\nwould occur if the density of its environment was manipulated instead. In\ntheory, and in a hydrostatic fluid, diffusing micro air bubbles from the top\nsurface of the submarine would dilute the column of water above it with air\ncavities, thus lowering the density of the water. The resulting pressure\ndifferential would then cause the submarine to gain buoyancy.\n", "  We present the results of a photometric study of 85 objects from the updated\nsample of galaxies residing in the nearby Lynx--Cancer void. We perform our\nphotometry on u, g, r, and i-band images of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We\ndetermine model-independent galaxy parameters such as the integrated magnitudes\nand colors, effective radii and the corresponding surface brightness values,\noptical radii and Holmberg radii. We analyze the radial surface brightness\nprofiles to determine the central brightness values and scale lengths of the\nmodel discs. We analyze the colors of the outer parts of the galaxies and\ncompare them with model evolutionary tracks computed using the PEGASE2 software\npackage. This allowed us to estimate the time T_SF elapsed since the onset of\nstar formation, which turned out to be on the order of the cosmological time\nT_0 for the overwhelming majority of the galaxies studied. However, for 13\ngalaxies of the sample the time T_SF does not exceed T_0/2 ~ 7 Gyr, and for 7\nof them T_SF < 3.5 Gyr. The latter are mostly unevolved objects dominated by\nlow-luminosity galaxies with M_B > -13.2. We use the integrated magnitudes and\ncolors to estimate the stellar masses of the galaxies. We estimate the\nparameter M(HI)/L_B and the gas mass fractions for void galaxies with known\nHI-line fluxes. A small subgroup (about 10%) of the gas-richest void galaxies\nwith M(HI)/L_B > 2.5 has gas mass fractions that reach 94-99%. The outer\nregions of many of these galaxies show atypically blue colors. To test various\nstatistical differences between void galaxies and galaxies from the samples\nselected using more general criteria, we compare some of the parameters of void\ngalaxies with similar data for the sample of 195 galaxies from the Equatorial\nSurvey (ES) based on a part of the HIPASS blind HI survey. abridged\n", "  We present a proof of the Riemannian Penrose inequality with charge in the\ncontext of asymptotically flat initial data sets for the Einstein-Maxwell\nequations, having possibly multiple black holes with no charged matter outside\nthe horizon, and satisfying the relevant dominant energy condition. The proof\nis based on a generalization of Hubert Bray's conformal flow of metrics adapted\nto this setting.\n", "  For a quantum state $\\rho$, let $E_{f}(\\rho)$ be the entanglement of\nformation. Professors Horodecki proved the following important results: If\n$\\rho$ is composed of the locally orthogonal pure state ensemble\n$\\{\\out{\\psi_{i}}{\\psi_{i}}\\}_{i=1}^K$ with probability distribution $p=(p_i)$\nsuch that $\\rho =\\sum_{i=1}^{K}p_{i}\\out{\\psi_{i}}{\\psi_{i}}$, then\n$$E_{f}(\\rho) = \\sum_{i}p_{i}E_{f}(\\out{\\psi_{i}}{\\psi_{i}}).$$ In this paper,\nwe generalize the conclusion to quantum state $\\rho$ which is composed of\nlocally orthogonal quantum state ensemble $\\{\\rho_{a}\\}_{a\\in\\Sigma}$. Finally,\nwe present an interesting example to show that the conditions of these\nconclusions are existence.\n", "  A review of three-dimensional waves on deep-water is presented. Three forms\nof three dimensionality, namely oblique, forced and spontaneous type, are\nidentified. An alternative formulation for these three-dimensional waves is\ngiven through cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. The periodic solutions of\nthe cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation are found using Weierstrass elliptic\n$\\wp$ functions. It is shown that the classification of solutions depends on\nthe boundary conditions, wavenumber and frequency. For certain parameters,\nWeierstrass $\\wp$ functions are reduced to periodic, hyperbolic or Jacobi\nelliptic functions. It is demonstrated that some of these solutions do not have\nany physical significance. An analytical solution of cubic nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with wind forcing is also obtained which results in how\ngroups of waves are generated on the surface of deep water in the ocean. In\nthis case the dependency on the energy-transfer parameter, from wind to waves,\nmake either the groups of wave to grow initially and eventually dissipate, or\nsimply decay or grow in time.\n", "  This is the first paper in a series where we study collisions of nucleated\nbubbles taking into account the effects of small initial (quantum) fluctuations\nin a fully 3+1-dimensional setting. In this paper, we consider the evolution of\nlinear fluctuations around highly symmetric though inhomogeneous backgrounds.\nWe demonstrate that a large degree of asymmetry develops over time from tiny\nfluctuations superposed upon planar and SO(2,1) symmetric backgrounds. These\nfluctuations arise from zero-point vacuum oscillations, so excluding them by\nenforcing a spatial symmetry is inconsistent in a quantum treatment. We\nconsider the limit of two colliding planar walls, with fluctuation mode\nfunctions characterized by the wavenumber transverse to the collision direction\nand a longitudinal shape along the collision direction $x$, which we solve for.\nInitially, the fluctuations obey a linear wave equation with a time- and\nspace-dependent mass $m_{eff}(x,t)$. When the walls collide multiple times,\n$m_{eff}$ oscillates in time. We use Floquet theory to study the fluctuations\nand generalize techniques familiar from preheating to the case with many\ncoupled degrees of freedom. This inhomogeneous case has bands of unstable\ntransverse wavenumbers $k_\\perp$ with exponentially growing mode functions.\nFrom the detailed spatial structure of the mode functions in $x$, we identify\nboth broad and narrow parametric resonance generalizations of the homogeneous\n$m_{eff}(t)$ case of preheating. The unstable $k_\\perp$ modes are\nlongitudinally localized, yet can be described as quasiparticles in the\nBogoliubov sense. We define an effective occupation number to show they are\ncreated in bursts for the case of well-defined collisions in the background.\nThe transverse-longitudinal coupling accompanying nonlinearity radically breaks\nthis localized particle description, with nonseparable 3D modes arising.\n", "  A dilaton potential is adjusted to recently confirmed lattice QCD\nthermodynamics data in the temperature range $(0.7 \\ldots 3.5) T_c$ where $T_c\n= 155 \\text{MeV}$ is the pseudo-critical temperature. The employed holographic\nmodel is based on a gravity--single-field dilaton dual. We discuss conditions\nfor enforcing (for the pure gluon plasma) or avoiding (for the QCD quark-gluon\nplasma) a first-order phase transition, but still keeping a softest point\n(minimum of sound velocity).\n", "  We study collisions between nearly planar domain walls including the effects\nof small initial nonplanar fluctuations. These perturbations represent the\nsmall fluctuations that must exist in a quantum treatment of the problem. In a\nprevious paper, we demonstrated that at the linear level a subset of these\nfluctuations experience parametric amplification as a result of their coupling\nto the planar symmetric background. Here we study the full three-dimensional\nnonlinear dynamics using lattice simulations, including both the early time\nregime when the fluctuations are well described by linear perturbation theory\nas well as the subsequent stage of fully nonlinear evolution. We find that the\nnonplanar fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the overall evolution of the\nsystem. Specifically, once these fluctuations begin to interact nonlinearly the\nsplit into a planar symmetric part of the field and the nonplanar fluctuations\nloses its utility. At this point the colliding domain walls dissolve, with the\nendpoint of this being the creation of a population of oscillons in the\ncollision region. The original (nearly) planar symmetry has been completely\ndestroyed at this point and an accurate study of the system requires the full\nthree-dimensional simulation.\n", "  We study collisions between pairs of bubbles nucleated in an ambient false\nvacuum. For the first time, we include the effects of small initial (quantum)\nfluctuations around the instanton profiles describing the most likely initial\nbubble profile. Past studies of this problem neglect these fluctuations and\nwork under the assumption that the collisions posess an exact SO(2,1) symmetry.\nWe use three-dimensional lattice simulations to demonstrate that for\ndouble-well potentials, small initial perturbations to this symmetry can be\namplified as the system evolves. Initially the amplification is well-described\nby linear perturbation theory around the SO(2,1) background, but the onset of\nstrong nonlinearities amongst the fluctuations quickly leads to a drastic\nbreaking of the original SO(2,1) symmetry and the production of oscillons in\nthe collision region. We explore several single-field models, and we find it is\nhard to both realize inflation inside of a bubble and produce oscillons in a\ncollision. Finally, we extend our results to a simple two-field model. The\nadditional freedom allowed by the second field allows us to construct viable\ninflationary models that allow oscillon production in collisions. The breaking\nof the SO(2,1) symmetry allows for a new class of observational signatures from\nbubble collisions that do not posess azimuthal symmetry, including the\nproduction of gravitational waves which cannot be supported by an SO(2,1)\nspacetime.\n", "  Distance measures between quantum states like the trace distance and the\nfidelity can naturally be defined by optimizing a classical distance measure\nover all measurement statistics that can be obtained from the respective\nquantum states. In contrast, Petz showed that the measured relative entropy,\ndefined as a maximization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence over projective\nmeasurement statistics, is strictly smaller than Umegaki's quantum relative\nentropy whenever the states do not commute. We extend this result in two ways.\nFirst, we show that Petz' conclusion remains true if we allow general positive\noperator valued measures. Second, we extend the result to Renyi relative\nentropies and show that for non-commuting states the sandwiched Renyi relative\nentropy is strictly larger than the measured Renyi relative entropy for $\\alpha\n\\in (\\frac12, \\infty)$, and strictly smaller for $\\alpha \\in [0,\\frac12)$. The\nlatter statement provides counterexamples for the data-processing inequality of\nthe sandwiched Renyi relative entropy for $\\alpha < \\frac12$. Our main tool is\na new variational expression for the measured Renyi relative entropy, which we\nfurther exploit to show that certain lower bounds on quantum conditional mutual\ninformation are superadditive.\n", "  Geometric approaches to network analysis combine simply defined models with\ngreat descriptive power. In this work we provide a method for embedding\ndirected acyclic graphs into Minkowski spacetime using Multidimensional scaling\n(MDS). First we generalise the classical MDS algorithm, defined only for\nmetrics with a Euclidean signature, to manifolds of any metric signature. We\nthen use this general method to develop an algorithm to be used on networks\nwhich have causal structure allowing them to be embedded in Lorentzian\nmanifolds. The method is demonstrated by calculating embeddings for both causal\nsets and citation networks in Minkowski spacetime. We finally suggest a number\nof applications in citation analysis such as paper recommendation, identifying\nmissing citations and fitting citation models to data using this geometric\napproach.\n", "  Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have immense potential for\nfuture spintronic and valleytronic applications due to their two-dimensional\nnature and long spin/valley lifetimes. We investigate the origin of these\nlong-lived states in n-type WS2 using time-resolved Kerr rotation microscopy\nand photoluminescence microscopy with ~1 micron spatial resolution. Comparing\nthe spatial dependence of the Kerr rotation signal and the photoluminescence\nreveals a correlation with neutral exciton emission, which is likely due to the\ntransfer of angular momentum to resident conduction electrons with long\nspin/valley lifetimes. In addition, we observe an unexpected anticorrelation\nbetween the Kerr rotation and trion emission, which provides evidence for the\npresence of long-lived spin/valley-polarized dark trions. We also find that the\nspin/valley polarization in WS2 is robust to magnetic fields up to 700 mT,\nindicative of spins and valleys that are stabilized with strong spin-orbit\nfields.\n", "  We construct integral representations of solutions to the boundary quantum\nKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. These are difference equations taking values\nin tensor products of Verma modules of quantum affine $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$, with\nthe K-operators acting diagonally. The integrands in question are products of\nscalar-valued elliptic weight functions with vector-valued trigonometric weight\nfunctions (boundary Bethe vectors). These integrals give rise to a basis of\nsolutions of the boundary qKZ equations over the field of quasi-constant\nmeromorphic functions in weight subspaces of the tensor product.\n", "  The dilaton is a possible inflaton candidate following recent CMB data\nallowing a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci curvature scalar in the early\nUniverse. In this paper, we introduce an approach that has seldom been used in\nthe literature, namely dilaton inflation with non-local features. More\nconcretely, employing non-local features expressed in J. High Energy Phys. 04\n(2007) 029, we study quadratic variations around a de Sitter geometry of an\neffective action with a non-local dilaton. The non-locality refers to an\ninfinite derivative kinetic term involving the operator\n$\\mathcal{F}\\left(\\Box\\right)$. Algebraic roots of the characteristic equation\n$\\mathcal{F}(z)=0$ play a crucial role in determining the properties of the\ntheory. We subsequently study the cases when $\\mathcal{F}\\left(\\Box\\right)$ has\none real root and one complex root, from which we retrieve two concrete\neffective models of inflation. In the first case we retrieve a class of single\nfield inflations with universal prediction of $n_{s}\\sim0.967$ with any value\nof the tensor to scalar ratio $r<0.1$ intrinsically controlled by the root of\nthe characteristic equation. The second case involves a new class of two field\nconformally invariant models with a peculiar quadratic cross-product of scalar\nfields. In this latter case, we obtain Starobinsky like inflation through a\nspontaneously broken conformal invariance. Furthermore, an uplifted minimum of\nthe potential, which accounts for the vacuum energy after inflation is produced\nnaturally through this mechanism intrinsically within our approach.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the final stages of the black hole evaporation for\nHayward solutions. Our results show that the behavior of Hawking's radiation\nchanges considerably at the small radii regime such that the black hole does\nnot evaporate completely and a stable remnant is left. We show that stability\nconditions hold for the Hayward solutions found in the Einstein gravity coupled\nwith nonlinear electrodynamics. We analyse the effect that an inspired model of\nthe noncommutativity of spacetime can have on the thermodynamics of Hayward\nspacetimes. This has been done by applying the noncommutative effects to the\nnon-rotating and rotating Hayward black holes. In this setup, all point\nstructures get replaced by smeared distributions owing to this inspired\napproach. The noncommutative effects result in a colder black hole in the small\nradii regime as Hayward's free parameter $g$ increases. As well as the effects\nof noncommutativity and the rotation factor, the configuration of the remnant\ncan be substantially affected by the parameter $g$. However, in the rotating\nsolution it is not so sensitive to $g$ with respect to the non-rotating case.\nAs a consequence, Hayward's parameter, the noncommutativity and the rotation\nmay raise the minimum value of energy for the possible formation of black holes\nin TeV-scale collisions. This observation can be used as a potential\nexplanation for the absence of black holes in the current energy scales\nproduced at particle colliders. However, it is also found that if extra\ndimensions do exist, then the possibility of the black hole production at\nenergy scales accessible at the LHC for large numbers of extra dimensions will\nbe larger.\n", "  Generalized Dirac monopoles in momentum space are constructed in even d+1\ndimensions from the Weyl Hamiltonian in terms of Green's functions. In 3+1\nspacetime dimensions, the (unit) charge of the monopole is equal to both the\nwinding number and the Chern number, expressed as the integral of the Berry\ncurvature. Based on the equivalence of the Chern and winding numbers, a\nchirally coupled field theory action is proposed for the Weyl semimetal phase.\nAt the one loop order, the effective action yields both the chiral magnetic\neffect and the anomalous Hall effect. The Chern number appears as a coefficient\nin the conductivity, thus emphasizes the role of topology. The anomalous\ncontribution of chiral fermions to transport phenomena is reflected as the\ngauge anomaly with the topological term $(\\bm{E}\\cdot\\bm{B})$. Relevance of\nmonopoles and Chern numbers for the semiclassical chiral kinetic theory is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Berry phases and gauge structures in parameter spaces of quantum systems are\nthe foundation of a broad range of quantum effects such as quantum Hall effects\nand topological insulators. The gauge structures of interacting many-body\nsystems, which often present exotic features, are particularly interesting.\nWhile quantum systems are intrinsically linear due to the superposition\nprinciple, nonlinear quantum mechanics can arise as an effective theory for\ninteracting systems (such as condensates of interacting bosons). Here we show\nthat gauge structures similar to curved spacetime can arise in nonlinear\nquantum systems where the superposition principle breaks down. In the canonical\nformalism of the nonlinear quantum mechanics, the geometric phases of quantum\nevolutions can be formulated as the classical geometric phases of a harmonic\noscillator that represents the Bogoliubov excitations. We find that the\nclassical geometric phase can be described by a de Sitter universe. The\nfundamental frequency of the harmonic oscillator plays the role of the cosmic\nscale factor and the classical geometric phase is an integral of a differential\nangle 2-form, which is half of the curvature 2-form of the associated de Sitter\nuniverse. While the gauge structure of a linear quantum system presents\nmonopole singularity at energy level degeneracy points, nonlinear quantum\nsystems, corresponding to their quantum critical surfaces in the parameter\nspaces, exhibits a conic singularity in their gauge structure, which mimics the\ncasual singularity at the big bang of the de Sitter universe. This finding\nopens up a new approach to studying the gauge and topological structures of\ninteracting quantum systems and sets up a new stage for quantum simulation of\nfundamental physics.\n", "  Recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on FeSe and\nFe(Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$), have sparked intense debate over the nature of the ground\nstate in these materials. Here we propose an effective bilinear-biquadratic\nspin model which is shown to consistently describe the evolution of low-energy\nspin excitations in FeSe, both under applied pressure and upon Se/Te\nsubstitution. The phase diagram, studied using a combination of variational\nmean-field, flavor-wave calculations, and density-matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG), exhibits a sequence of transitions between the columnar antiferromagnet\ncommon to the iron pnictides, the non-magnetic ferroquadrupolar phase\nattributed to FeSe, and the double-stripe antiferromagnetic order known to\nexist in Fe$_{1+y}$Te. The calculated spin structure factor in these phases\nmimics closely that observed with INS in the Fe(Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$), series. In\naddition to the experimentally established phases, the possibility of\nincommensurate magnetic order is also predicted.\n", "  The method of flow tracing follows the power flow from net-generating sources\nthrough the network to the net-consuming sinks, which allows to assign the\nusage of the underlying transmission infrastructure to the system participants.\nThis article presents a reformulation that is applicable to arbitrary\ncompositions of inflow appearing naturally in models of large-scale electricity\nsystems with a high share of renewable power generation. We propose an\napplication which allows to associate power flows on the grid to specific\nregions or generation technologies, and emphasizes the capability of this\ntechnique to disentangle the spatio-temporal patterns of physical imports and\nexports occurring in such systems. The analytical potential of this method is\nshowcased for a scenario based on the IEEE 118 bus network.\n", "  Modified Gravity (MOG) and Non-Local Gravity (NLG) are two alternative\ntheories to General Relativity. They are able to explain the rotation curves of\nspiral galaxies and clusters of galaxies without including dark matter (Moffat\n& Rahvar 2013, 2014; Rahvar & Mashhoon 2014). In the weak-field approximation\nthese two theories have similar forms, with an effective gravitational\npotential that has two components: (i) Newtonian gravity with the gravitational\nconstant enhanced by a factor $(1+\\alpha)$ and (ii) a Yukawa type potential\nthat produces a repulsive force with length scale $1/\\mu$. In this work we\ncompare the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies in the LITTLE THINGS catalog with\npredictions of MOG, NLG and Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We find that\nthe universal parameters of these theories, can fit the rotation curve of dwarf\ngalaxies with a larger stellar mass to the light ratio compared to the nearby\nstars in the Milky Way galaxy. Future direct observations of mass function of\nstars in the dwarf galaxies can examine different modified gravity models.\n", "  Multilayer networks are a useful way to capture and model multiple, binary or\nweighted relationships among a fixed group of objects. While community\ndetection has proven to be a useful exploratory technique for the analysis of\nsingle-layer networks, the development of community detection methods for\nmultilayer networks is still in its infancy. We propose and investigate a\nprocedure, called Multilayer Extraction, that identifies densely connected\nvertex-layer sets in multilayer networks. Multilayer Extraction makes use of a\nsignificance based score that quantifies the connectivity of an observed\nvertex-layer set through comparison with a fixed degree random graph model.\nMultilayer Extraction directly handles networks with heterogeneous layers where\ncommunity structure may be different from layer to layer. The procedure can\ncapture overlapping communities, as well as background vertex-layer pairs that\ndo not belong to any community. We establish consistency of the vertex-layer\nset optimizer of our proposed multilayer score under the multilayer stochastic\nblock model. We investigate the performance of Multilayer Extraction on three\napplications and a test bed of simulations. Our theoretical and numerical\nevaluations suggest that Multilayer Extraction is an effective exploratory tool\nfor analyzing complex multilayer networks. Publicly available R software for\nMultilayer Extraction is available at\nhttps://github.com/jdwilson4/MultilayerExtraction.\n", "  We present a class of inflationary potentials which are invariant under a\nspecial symmetry, which depends on the parameters of the models. As we show, in\ncertain limiting cases, the inverse symmetric potentials are qualitatively\nsimilar to the $\\alpha$-attractors models, since the resulting observational\nindices are identical. However, there are some quantitative differences which\nwe discuss in some detail. As we show, some inverse symmetric models always\nyield results compatible with observations, but this strongly depends on the\nasymptotic form of the potential at large $e$-folding numbers. In fact when the\nlimiting functional form is identical to the one corresponding to the\n$\\alpha$-attractors models, the compatibility with the observations is\nguaranteed. Also we find the relation of the inverse symmetric models with the\nStarobinsky model and we highlight the differences. In addition, an alternative\ninverse symmetric model is studied and as we show, not all the inverse\nsymmetric models are viable. Moreover, we study the corresponding $F(R)$\ngravity theory and we show that the Jordan frame theory belongs to the $R^2$\nattractor class of models. Finally we discuss a non-minimally coupled theory\nand we show that the attractor behavior occurs in this case too.\n", "  Single-photon detection with high efficiency, high timing resolution, low\ndark counts and high photon detection-rates is crucial for a wide range of\noptical measurements. Although efficient detectors have been reported before,\ncombining all performance parameters in a single device remains a challenge.\nHere, we show a broadband NbTiN superconducting nanowire detector with an\nefficiency exceeding 92%, over 150MHz photon detection-rate, a dark count-rate\nbelow 130Hz, operated in a Gifford-McMahon cryostat. Furthermore, with careful\noptimization of the detector design and readout electronics, we reach an\nultra-low system timing jitter of 14.80ps (13.95ps decoupled) while maintaining\nhigh detection efficiencies.\n", "  We establish the conjectured area-angular momentum-charge inequality for\nstable apparent horizons in the presence of a positive cosmological constant,\nand show that it is saturated precisely for extreme Kerr-Newman-de Sitter\nhorizons. As with previous inequalities of this type, the proof is reduced to\nminimizing an `area functional' related to a harmonic map energy; in this case\nmaps are from the 2-sphere to the complex hyperbolic plane. The proof here is\nsimplified compared to previous results for less embellished inequalities, due\nto the observation that the functional is convex along geodesic deformations in\nthe target.\n", "  This note describes the design and testing of a programmable pulsatile flow\npump using an Arduino micro-controller. The goal of this work is to build a\ncompact and affordable system that can relatively easily be programmed to\ngenerate physiological waveforms. The system described here was designed to be\nused in an in-vitro set-up for vascular access hemodynamics research, and hence\nincorporates a gear pump that can deliver up to 1.5 l/min in a test flow loop.\nAfter a number of simple identification experiments to assess the dynamic\nbehaviour of the system, a feed-forward control routine was implemented. The\nresulting system was shown to be able to produce the targeted patient-specific\nwaveform with less than 3.6% error. Finally, we outline how to further increase\nthe accuracy of the system, and how to adapt it to specific user needs.\n", "  We quantify the coupling asymptotics for the Lyapunov-exponent of a\none-frequency quasi-periodic Schr\\\"odinger operator with analytic potential\nsampling function. The result refines the well-known lower bound of the\nLyapunov-exponent by Sorets and Spencer.\n", "  This work contains a detailed qualitative analysis, in General Relativity and\nin Loop Quantum Cosmology, of the dynamics in the associated phase space of a\nscalar field minimally coupled with gravity, whose potential mimics the\ndynamics of a perfect fluid with a linear Equation of State (EoS). Dealing with\nthe orbits (solutions) of the system, we will see that there are analytic ones,\nwhich lead to the same dynamics as the perfect fluid, and our goal is to check\ntheir stability, depending on the value of the EoS parameter, i.e., to show\nwhether the other orbits converge or diverge to these analytic solutions at\nearly and late times.\n", "  The $\\alpha + \\mathrm{core}$ structure is investigated in even-even Cr\nisotopes from the viewpoint of the local potential model. The comparison of\n$Q_{\\alpha}/A$ values for even-even Cr isotopes and even-even $A = 46,54,56,58$\nisobars indicates that $^{46}$Cr and $^{54}$Cr are the most favorable even-even\nCr isotopes for $\\alpha$-clustering. The ground state bands of the two Cr\nisotopes are calculated through a local $\\alpha + \\mathrm{core}$ potential with\ntwo variable parameters. The calculated spectra give a very good description of\nmost experimental $^{46}$Cr and $^{54}$Cr levels. The reduced $\\alpha $-widths,\nrms intercluster separations and $B(E2)$ transition rates are determined for\nthe ground state bands. The calculations reproduce the order of magnitude of\nthe available experimental $B(E2)$ values without using effective charges and\nindicate that the first members of the ground state bands present a stronger\n$\\alpha$-cluster character. The volume integral per nucleon pair and rms radius\nobtained for the $\\alpha+^{50}$Ti potential are consistent with those reported\npreviously in the analysis of $\\alpha$ elastic scattering on $^{50}$Ti.\n", "  Traveling wave solutions to Kawahara equation (KE), transmission line (TL),\nand Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation are found by using an elliptic function\nmethod which is more general than the $\\mathrm{tanh}$-method. The method works\nby assuming that a polynomial ansatz satisfies a Weierstrass equation, and has\ntwo advantages: first, it reduces the number of terms in the ansatz by an order\nof two, and second, it uses Weierstrass functions which satisfy an elliptic\nequation for the dependent variable instead of the hyperbolic tangent functions\nwhich only satisfy the Riccati equation with constant coefficients.\n  When the polynomial ansatz in the traveling wave variable is of first order,\nthe equation reduces to the KdV equation with only a cubic dispersion term,\nwhile for the KE which includes a fifth order dispersion term the polynomial\nansatz must necessary be of quadratic type.\n  By solving the elliptic equation with coefficients that depend on the\nboundary conditions, velocity of the traveling waves, nonlinear strength, and\ndispersion coefficients, in the case of KdV equation we find the well-known\nsolitary waves (solitons) for zero boundary conditions, as well as wave-trains\nof cnoidal waves for nonzero boundary conditions. Both solutions are either\ncompressive (bright) or rarefactive (dark), and either propagate to the left or\nright with arbitrary velocity.\n", "  We design a heat engine with multi-heat-reservoir, ancillary system and\nquantum memory. We then derive an inequality related with the second law of\nthermodynamics, and give a new limitation about the work gain from the engine\nby analyzing the entropy change and quantum mutual information change during\nthe process. In addition and remarkably, by combination of two independent\nengines and with the help of the entropic uncertainty relation with quantum\nmemory, we find that the total maximum work gained from those two heat engines\nshould be larger than a quantity related with quantum entanglement between the\nancillary state and the quantum memory. This result provides a lower bound for\nthe maximum work extracted, in contrast with the upper bound in the\nconventional second law of thermodynamics. However, the validity of this\ninequality depends on whether the maximum work can achieve the upper bound.\n", "  The relaxation of a system to a steady state is a central point of interest\nin many attempts to advance control over the quantum world. In this paper, we\nconsider control through instantaneous Gaussian unitary operations on the\nubiquitous lossy channel, and find locally optimal conditions for the cooling\nand heating of a multimode Gaussian state subject to losses and possibly\nthermal noise. This is done by isolating the parameters that encode entropy and\ntemperature and by deriving an equation for their evolution. This equation is\nin such a form that it grants clear insight into how relaxation may be helped\nby instantaneous quantum control. It is thus shown that squeezing is a crucial\nelement in optimising the rate of change of entropic properties under these\nchannels. Exact relaxation times for heating and cooling are derived, up to an\narbitrarily small distance from the fixed point of the lossy channel with\nlocally optimal strategies.\n", "  The magnetic signature of an urban environment is investigated using a\ngeographically distributed network of fluxgate magnetometers deployed in and\naround Berkeley, California. The system hardware and software are described and\nresults from initial operation of the network are reported. The sensors sample\nthe vector magnetic field with a 4 kHz resolution and are sensitive to\nfluctuations below 0.1 $\\textrm{nT}/\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$. Data from separate\nstations are synchronized to around $\\pm100$ $\\mu{s}$ using GPS and computer\nsystem clocks. Data from all sensors are automatically uploaded to a central\nserver. Anomalous events, such as lightning strikes, have been observed. A\nwavelet analysis is used to study observations over a wide range of temporal\nscales up to daily variations that show strong differences between weekend and\nweekdays. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is identified as the most dominant\nsignal from these observations and a superposed epoch analysis is used to study\nand extract the BART signal. Initial results of the correlation between sensors\nare also presented.\n", "  We study $N$-particle systems in R^d whose interactions are governed by a\nhypersingular Riesz potential $|x-y|^{-s}$, $s>d$, and subject to an external\nfield. We provide both macroscopic results as well as microscopic results in\nthe limit as $N\\to \\infty$ for random point configurations with respect to the\nassociated Gibbs measure at scaled inverse temperature $\\beta$. We show that a\nlarge deviation principle holds with a rate function of the form\n`$\\beta$-Energy +Entropy', yielding that the microscopic behavior (on the scale\n$N^{-1/d}$) of such $N$-point systems is asymptotically determined by the\nminimizers of this rate function. In contrast to the asymptotic behavior in the\nintegrable case $s<d$, where on the macroscopic scale $N$-point empirical\nmeasures have limiting density independent of $\\beta$, the limiting density for\n$s>d$ is strongly $\\beta$-dependent.\n", "  The possible compatibility of density matrices for single-party subsystems is\ndescribed by linear constraints on their respective spectra. Whenever some of\nthose quantum marginal constraints are saturated, the total quantum state has a\nspecific, simplified structure. We prove that these remarkable global\nimplications of extremal local information are stable, i.e. they hold\napproximately for spectra close to the boundary of the allowed region.\nApplication of this general result to fermionic quantum systems allows us to\ncharacterize natural extensions of the Hartree-Fock ansatz and to quantify\ntheir accuracy by resorting to one-particle information, only: The fraction of\nthe correlation energy not recovered by such an ansatz can be estimated from\nabove by a simple geometric quantity in the occupation number picture.\n", "  Transitions between different charge density wave (CDW) states in\nquasi-two-dimensional materials may be accompanied also by changes in the\ninter-layer stacking of the CDW. Using MeV ultrafast electron diffraction, the\nout-of-plane stacking order dynamics in the quasi-two-dimensional\ndichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$ is investigated for the first time. From the\nintensity of the CDW satellites aligned around the commensurate $l$ = 1/6\ncharacteristic stacking order, it is found out that this phase disappears with\na 0.5 ps time constant. Simultaneously, in the same experiment, the emergence\nof the incommensurate phase, with a slightly slower 2.0 ps time constant, is\ndetermined from the intensity of the CDW satellites aligned around the\nincommensurate $l$ = 1/3 characteristic stacking order. These results might be\nof relevance in understanding the metallic character of the laser-induced\nmetastable \"hidden\" state recently discovered in this compound.\n", "  We investigate the properties of a stochastic gravitational wave background\nproduced by a first-order electroweak phase transition in the regime of extreme\nsupercooling. We study a scenario whereby the percolation temperature that\nsignifies the completion of the transition, $T_p$, can be as low as a few MeV\n(nucleosynthesis temperature), while most of the true vacuum bubbles are formed\nmuch earlier at the nucleation temperature, $T_n\\sim 50$ GeV. This implies that\nthe gravitational wave spectrum is mainly produced by the collisions of large\nbubbles and characterised by a large amplitude and a peak frequency as low as\n$f \\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-7}$ Hz. We show that such a scenario can occur in (but not\nlimited to) a model based on a non-linear realisation of the electroweak gauge\ngroup, such that the Higgs vacuum configuration is altered by a cubic coupling.\nIn order to carefully quantify the evolution of the phase transition of this\nmodel over such a wide temperature range, we go beyond the usual fast\ntransition approximation, taking into account the expansion of the Universe as\nwell as the behaviour of the nucleation probability at low temperatures. Our\ncomputation shows that there exists a range of parameters for which the\ngravitational wave spectrum lies at the edge between the exclusion limits of\ncurrent pulsar timing array experiments and the detection band of the future\nSquare Kilometre Array observatory.\n", "  We generalize the method of computing functional determinants with a single\nexcluded zero eigenvalue developed by McKane and Tarlie to differential\noperators with multiple zero eigenvalues. We derive general formulas for such\nfunctional determinants of $r\\times r$ matrix second order differential\noperators $O$ with $0 < n \\leqslant 2r$ linearly independent zero modes. We\nseparately discuss the cases of the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions,\nwhen the number of zero modes cannot exceed $r$, and the case of twisted\nboundary conditions, including the periodic and anti-periodic ones, when the\nnumber of zero modes is bounded above by $2r$. In all cases the determinants\nwith excluded zero eigenvalues can be expressed only in terms of the $n$ zero\nmodes and other $r-n$ or $2r-n$ (depending on the boundary conditions)\nsolutions of the homogeneous equation $O h=0$, in the spirit of Gel'fand-Yaglom\napproach. In instanton calculations, the contribution of the zero modes is\ntaken into account by introducing the so-called collective coordinates. We show\nthat there is a remarkable cancellation of a factor (involving scalar products\nof zero modes) between the Jacobian of the transformation to the collective\ncoordinates and the functional fluctuation determinant with excluded zero\neigenvalues. This cancellation drastically simplifies instanton calculations\nwhen one uses our formulas.\n", "  In a full theory of quantum gravity, local physics is expected to be\napproximate rather than innate. It is therefore important to understand how\napproximate locality emerges in the semiclassical limit. Here we show that any\nnotion of locality emergent from a holographic theory of quantum gravity is\n\"all or nothing\": local data is not obtained gradually from subregions of the\nboundary, but is rather obtained all at once when enough of the boundary is\naccessed. Our assumptions are mild and thus this feature is quite general; in\nthe special case of AdS/CFT, a slightly different manifestation follows from\nwell-known and familiar properties.\n", "  We discuss the linkage between dark matter mass in the one-loop radiative\nseesaw model and the effective neutrino mass for the neutrino less double beta\ndecay. This linkage, which has been already numerically suggested, is confirmed\nto be a reasonable relationship by deriving analytical expressions for two zero\nflavor neutrino mass texture.\n", "  To explore the capabilities of metallic spintronic thin-film stacks as a\nsource of intense and broadband terahertz electromagnetic fields, we excite a\nW/CoFeB/Pt trilayer on a large-area glass substrate (diameter of 7.5 cm) by a\nfemtosecond laser pulse (energy 5.5 mJ, duration 40 fs, wavelength 800 nm).\nAfter focusing, the emitted terahertz pulse is measured to have a duration of\n230 fs, a peak field of 300 kV cm$^{-1}$ and an energy of 5 nJ. In particular,\nthe waveform exhibits a gapless spectrum extending from 1 to 10 THz at 10% of\namplitude maximum, thereby facilitating nonlinear control over matter in this\ndifficult-to-reach frequency range and on the sub-picosecond time scale.\n", "  In this work we present our findings performing low frequency Raman\nmeasurements over temperature in a tellurite-tungstate glass sample. The\nspectra could be fitted by using only two log-Gaussians, which suggests that\nquasi-elastic light scattering is negligible. The positions of the peaks have\nthe same temperature behavior, being the higher frequency one refered as Boson\nPeak in literature. The similar temperature behavior and depolarization ratio\nindicates that the peaks may have the same origin, being linked to the\ntranversal and longitudinal vibrations of some unit.\n", "  We demonstrate site-resolved imaging of a strongly correlated quantum system\nwithout relying on laser-cooling techniques during fluorescence imaging. We\nobserved the formation of Mott shells in the insulating regime and realized\nthermometry on the atomic cloud. This work proves the feasibility of the\nnoncooled approach and opens the door to extending the detection technology to\nnew atomic species.\n", "  Utilizing discrete phase distribution to fit continuous phase distribution\nhas been a primary routine for designing metasurfaces. In the existing method,\nthe validation of the discrete designs is guaranteed only by using the\nsub-wavelength condition of unit cells, which is insufficient, especially for\narbitrary phase distribution. Herein, we proposed an analytical method to\ndesign metasurfaces via estimating the width of the source in a unit cell.\nAlso, by calculating field patterns in both real- and momentum-space, we\nprovided four guidelines to direct future applications of metasurfaces, such as\nan arbitrary multi-foci lens with the same strength of each focus, a\nconvex-concave double lens, and a lens with a large numerical aperture that can\nprecisely prevent undesired diffraction orders. Besides metalens, this\nmethodology can provide a wide platform for designing tailored and\nmultifunctional metasurfaces in future, especially large-area ones in practical\napplications.\n", "  The vast amount of data and increase of computational capacity have allowed\nthe analysis of texts from several perspectives, including the representation\nof texts as complex networks. Nodes of the network represent the words, and\nedges represent some relationship, usually word co-occurrence. Even though\nnetworked representations have been applied to study some tasks, such\napproaches are not usually combined with traditional models relying upon\nstatistical paradigms. Because networked models are able to grasp textual\npatterns, we devised a hybrid classifier, called labelled subgraphs, that\ncombines the frequency of common words with small structures found in the\ntopology of the network, known as motifs. Our approach is illustrated in two\ncontexts, authorship attribution and translationese identification. In the\nformer, a set of novels written by different authors is analyzed. To identify\ntranslationese, texts from the Canadian Hansard and the European parliament\nwere classified as to original and translated instances. Our results suggest\nthat labelled subgraphs are able to represent texts and it should be further\nexplored in other tasks, such as the analysis of text complexity, language\nproficiency, and machine translation.\n", "  In the effective field theory framework, quantum gravity can induce effective\ndimension-5 operators, which have important impacts on grand unified theories.\nInterestingly, one of main effects is the modification of the usual gauge\ncoupling unification condition. We investigate the gauge coupling unification\nin $E_{6}$ under modified gauge coupling unification condition at scales $M_X$\nin the presence of one or more dimension-5 operators. It is shown that\nnonsupersymmetric models of $E_6$ unification can be obtained and can easily\nsatisfy the constraints from the proton lifetime. For constructing these\nmodels, we consider several maximal subgroups $H=SO(10)\\times U(1),\nH=SU(3)\\times SU(3)\\times SU(3)$, and $H=SU(2)\\times SU(6)$ of $E_{6}$ and the\nusual breaking chains for a specific maximal subgroup, and derive all of the\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\Phi^{(r)}_{s,z}$ associated with $E_6$ breaking\nto the Standard Model, which are given in Appendix A.\n", "  We study the entanglement entropy between (possibly distinct) topological\nphases across an interface using an Abelian Chern-Simons description with\ntopological boundary conditions (TBCs) at the interface. From a microscopic\npoint of view, these TBCs correspond to turning on particular gapping\ninteractions between the edge modes across the interface. However, in studying\nentanglement in the continuum Chern-Simons description, we must confront the\nproblem of non-factorization of the Hilbert space, which is a standard property\nof gauge theories. We carefully define the entanglement entropy by using an\nextended Hilbert space construction directly in the continuum theory. We show\nhow a given TBC isolates a corresponding gauge invariant state in the extended\nHilbert space, and hence compute the resulting entanglement entropy. We find\nthat the sub-leading correction to the area law remains universal, but depends\non the choice of topological boundary conditions. This agrees with the\nmicroscopic calculation of \\cite{Cano:2014pya}. Additionally, we provide a\nreplica path integral calculation for the entropy. In the case when the\ntopological phases across the interface are taken to be identical, our\nconstruction gives a novel explanation of the equivalence between the\nleft-right entanglement of (1+1)d Ishibashi states and the spatial entanglement\nof (2+1)d topological phases.\n", "  Terahertz emission spectroscopy of ultrathin multilayers of magnetic and\nheavy metals has recently attracted much interest. This method not only\nprovides fundamental insights into photoinduced spin transport and spin-orbit\ninteraction at highest frequencies but has also paved the way to applications\nsuch as efficient and ultrabroadband emitters of terahertz electromagnetic\nradiation. So far, predominantly standard ferromagnetic materials have been\nexploited. Here, by introducing a suitable figure of merit, we systematically\ncompare the strength of terahertz emission from X/Pt bilayers with X being a\ncomplex ferro-, ferri- and antiferromagnetic metal, that is, dysprosium cobalt\n(DyCo$_5$), gadolinium iron (Gd$_{24}$Fe$_{76}$), Magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$) and\niron rhodium (FeRh). We find that the performance in terms of spin-current\ngeneration not only depends on the spin polarization of the magnet's conduction\nelectrons but also on the specific interface conditions, thereby suggesting\nterahertz emission spectroscopy to be a highly surface-sensitive technique. In\ngeneral, our results are relevant for all applications that rely on the optical\ngeneration of ultrafast spin currents in spintronic metallic multilayers.\n", "  We demonstrate the parallel and non-destructive readout of the hyperfine\nstate for optically trapped $^{87}$Rb atoms. The scheme is based on\nstate-selective fluorescence imaging and achieves detection fidelities $>$98%\nwithin 10$\\,$ms, while keeping 99% of the atoms trapped. For the read-out of\ndense arrays of neutral atoms in optical lattices, where the fluorescence\nimages of neighboring atoms overlap, we apply a novel image analysis technique\nusing Bayesian inference to determine the internal state of multiple atoms. Our\nmethod is scalable to large neutral atom registers relevant for future quantum\ninformation processing tasks requiring fast and non-destructive readout and can\nalso be used for the simultaneous read-out of quantum information stored in\ninternal qubit states and in the atoms' positions.\n", "  We evaluate the mass of the black holes of GW150914 at their event horizons\nvia quasi-local energy approach and obtain the values of 71 and 57 solar\nmasses, compared to their asymptotic values of 36 and 29 units, respectively,\nas reported by LIGO. A higher mass at the event horizon is compulsory in order\nto overcome the huge negative gravitational potential energy surrounding the\nblack holes and allow for the emission of gravitational waves during merging.\nWe estimate the initial mass of the stars which collapsed to form the black\nholes from the horizon mass and obtain the impressive values of 95 and 76 solar\nmasses for these progenitor stars.\n", "  We propose new gradient flows that define Lefschetz thimbles and do not blow\nup in a finite flow time. We study analytic properties of these gradient flows,\nand confirm them by numerical tests in simple examples.\n", "  We present a general analytical formalism to determine the energy spectrum of\na quantum particle in a cubic lattice subject to translationally invariant\ncommensurate magnetic fluxes and in the presence of a general space-independent\nnon-Abelian gauge potential. We first review and analyze the case of purely\nAbelian potentials, showing also that the so-called Hasegawa gauge yields a\ndecomposition of the Hamiltonian into sub-matrices having minimal dimension.\nExplicit expressions for such matrices are derived, also for general\nanisotropic fluxes. Later on, we show that the introduction of a translational\ninvariant non-Abelian coupling for multi-component spinors does not affect the\ndimension of the minimal Hamiltonian blocks, nor the dimension of the magnetic\nBrillouin zone. General formulas are presented for the U(2) case and explicit\nexamples are investigated involving $\\pi$ and $2\\pi/3$ magnetic fluxes.\nFinally, we numerically study the effect of random flux perturbations.\n", "  We report the first evidence for isospin violation in $B \\to K^* \\gamma$ and\nthe first measurement of difference of $CP$ asymmetries between $B^+ \\to K^{*+}\n\\gamma$ and $B^0 \\to K^{*0} \\gamma$. This analysis is based on the data sample\ncontaining $772 \\times 10^6 B\\bar{B}$ pairs that was collected with the Belle\ndetector at the KEKB energy-asymmetric $e^+ e^-$ collider. We find evidence for\nthe isospin violation with a significance of 3.1$\\sigma$, $\\Delta_{0+} = (+6.2\n\\pm 1.5 ({\\rm stat.}) \\pm 0.6 ({\\rm syst.}) \\pm 1.2 (f_{+-}/f_{00}))$\\%, where\nthe third uncertainty is due to the uncertainty on the fraction of $B^+B^-$ to\n$B^0\\bar{B}^0$ production in $\\Upsilon(4S)$ decays. The measured value is\nconsistent with predictions of the SM. The result for the difference of $CP$\nasymmetries is $\\Delta A_{CP} = (+2.4 \\pm 2.8({\\rm stat.}) \\pm 0.5({\\rm\nsyst.}))$\\%, consistent with zero. The measured branching fractions and $CP$\nasymmetries for charged and neutral $B$ meson decays are the most precise to\ndate. We also calculate the ratio of branching fractions of $B^0 \\to K^{*0}\n\\gamma$ to $B_s^0 \\to \\phi \\gamma$.\n", "  A search is performed for anomalous interactions of the recently discovered\nHiggs boson using matrix element techniques with the information from its decay\nto four leptons and from associated Higgs boson production with two quark jets\nin either vector boson fusion or associated production with a vector boson. The\ndata were recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy\nof 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 38.6 inverse\nfemtobarns. These data are combined with the data collected at center-of-mass\nenergies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and\n19.7 inverse femtobarns, respectively. All observations are consistent with the\nexpectations for the standard model Higgs boson.\n", "  We revisit the confinement-induced p-wave resonance in quasi-one-dimensional\n(quasi-1D) atomic gases and study the induced molecules near resonance. We\nderive the reduced 1D interaction parameters and show that they can well\npredict the binding energy of shallow molecules in quasi-1D system.\nImportantly, these shallow molecules are found to be much more spatially\nextended compared to those in three dimensions (3D) without transverse\nconfinement. Our results strongly indicate that a p-wave interacting atomic gas\ncan be much more stable in quasi-1D near the induced p-wave resonance, where\nmost weight of the molecule lies outside the short-range regime and thus the\natom loss could be suppressed.\n", "  When a single cell senses a chemical gradient and chemotaxes, stochastic\nreceptor-ligand binding can be a fundamental limit to the cell's accuracy. For\nclusters of cells responding to gradients, however, there is a critical\ndifference: even genetically identical cells have differing responses to\nchemical signals. With theory and simulation, we show collective chemotaxis is\nlimited by cell-to-cell variation in signaling. We find that when different\ncells cooperate the resulting bias can be much larger than the effects of\nligand-receptor binding. Specifically, when a strongly-responding cell is at\none end of a cell cluster, cluster motion is biased toward that cell. These\nerrors are mitigated if clusters average measurements over times long enough\nfor cells to rearrange. In consequence, fluid clusters are better able to sense\ngradients: we derive a link between cluster accuracy, cell-to-cell variation,\nand the cluster rheology. Because of this connection, increasing the noisiness\nof individual cell motion can actually increase the collective accuracy of a\ncluster by improving fluidity.\n", "  We perform a combined analysis of cosmic shear tomography, galaxy-galaxy\nlensing tomography, and redshift-space multipole power spectra (monopole and\nquadrupole) using 450 deg$^2$ of imaging data by the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS)\noverlapping with two spectroscopic surveys: the 2-degree Field Lensing Survey\n(2dFLenS) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We restrict\nthe galaxy-galaxy lensing and multipole power spectrum measurements to the\noverlapping regions with KiDS, and self-consistently compute the full\ncovariance between the different observables using a large suite of $N$-body\nsimulations. We methodically analyze different combinations of the observables,\nfinding that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements are particularly useful in\nimproving the constraint on the intrinsic alignment amplitude (by 30%, positive\nat $3.5\\sigma$ in the fiducial data analysis), while the multipole power\nspectra are useful in tightening the constraints along the lensing degeneracy\ndirection (e.g. factor of two stronger matter density constraint in the\nfiducial analysis). The fully combined constraint on $S_8 \\equiv \\sigma_8\n\\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3} = 0.742 \\pm 0.035$, which is an improvement by 20%\ncompared to KiDS alone, corresponds to a $2.6\\sigma$ discordance with Planck,\nand is not significantly affected by fitting to a more conservative set of\nscales. Given the tightening of the parameter space, we are unable to resolve\nthe discordance with an extended cosmology that is simultaneously favored in a\nmodel selection sense, including the sum of neutrino masses, curvature,\nevolving dark energy, and modified gravity. The complementarity of our\nobservables allows for constraints on modified gravity degrees of freedom that\nare not simultaneously bounded with either probe alone, and up to a factor of\nthree improvement in the $S_8$ constraint in the extended cosmology compared to\nKiDS alone.\n", "  Some of the dark matter in the Universe is made up of massive neutrinos.\nTheir impact on the formation of large scale structure can be used to determine\ntheir absolute mass scale from cosmology, but to this end accurate numerical\nsimulations have to be developed. Due to their relativistic nature, neutrinos\npose additional challenges when one tries to include them in N-body simulations\nthat are traditionally based on Newtonian physics. Here we present the first\nnumerical study of massive neutrinos that uses a fully relativistic approach.\nOur N-body code, gevolution, is based on a weak-field formulation of general\nrelativity that naturally provides a self-consistent framework for relativistic\nparticle species. This allows us to model neutrinos from first principles,\nwithout invoking any ad-hoc recipes. Our simulation suite comprises some of the\nlargest neutrino simulations performed to date. We study the effect of massive\nneutrinos on the nonlinear power spectra and the halo mass function, focusing\non the interesting mass range between 0.06 eV and 0.3 eV and including a case\nfor an inverted mass hierarchy.\n", "  Recent LENS experiment on a 3D Fermi gas has reported a negative effective\nmass ($m^*<0$) of Fermi polarons in the strongly repulsive regime. There\nnaturally arise a question whether the negative $m^*$ is a precursor of the\ninstability towards phase separation (or itinerant ferromagnetism). In this\nwork, we make use of the exact solutions to study the ground state and\nexcitation properties of repulsive Fermi polarons in 1D, which can also exhibit\na negative $m^*$ in the super Tonks-Girardeau regime. By analyzing the total\nspin, quasi-momentum distribution and pair correlations, we conclude that the\nnegative $m^*$ is irrelevant to the instability towards ferromagnetism or phase\nseparation, but rather an intrinsic feature of collective excitations for\nfermions in the strongly repulsive regime. Surprisingly, for large and negative\n$m^*$, such excitation is accompanied with a spin density modulation when the\nmajority fermions move closer to the impurity rather than being repelled far\naway, contrary to the picture of phase separation. These results suggest an\nalternative interpretation of negative $m^*$ as observed in recent LENS\nexperiment.\n", "  We consider the Faddeev formulation of general relativity (GR), which can be\ncharacterized by a kind of $d$-dimensional tetrad (typically $d$=10) and a\nnon-Riemannian connection. This theory is invariant w. r. t. the global, but\nnot local, rotations in the $d$-dimensional space. There can be configurations\nwith a smooth or flat metric, but with the tetrad that changes abruptly at\nsmall distances, a kind of \"antiferromagnetic\" structure.\n  Previously, we discussed a first order representation for the Faddeev\ngravity, which uses the orthogonal connection in the $d$-dimensional space as\nan independent variable. Using the discrete form of this formulation, we\nconsidered the spectrum of (elementary) area. This spectrum turns out to be\nphysically reasonable just on a classical background with large connection like\nrotations by $\\pi$, that is, with such an \"antiferromagnetic\" structure.\n  In the discrete first order Faddeev gravity, we consider such a structure\nwith periodic cells and large connection and strongly changing tetrad field\ninside the cell. We show that this system in the continuum limit reduces to a\ngeneralization of the Faddeev system. The action is a sum of related actions of\nthe Faddeev type and is still reduced to the GR action.\n", "  This work presents recent the progress in the development of the Concurrent\nAtomistic-Continuum (CAC) method for coarse-grained space- and time-resolved\natomistic simulations of phonon transport. Application examples, including heat\npulses propagating across grain boundaries and phase interfaces, as well as the\ninteractions between phonons and moving dislocations, are provided to\ndemonstrate the capabilities of CAC. The simulation results provide visual\nevidence and reveal the underlying physics of a variety of phenomena including:\nphonon focusing, wave interference, dislocation drag, interfacial Kapitza\nresistance caused by quasi-ballistic phonon transport, etc. A new method to\nquantify fluxes in transient transport processes is also introduced.\n", "  Recently, entropy corrections on nonorientable manifolds such as the Klein\nbottle are proposed as a universal characterization of critical systems with an\nemergent conformal field theory (CFT). We show that entropy correction on the\nKlein bottle can be interpreted as a boundary effect via transforming the Klein\nbottle into an orientable manifold with nonlocal boundary interactions. The\ninterpretation reveals the conceptual connection of the Klein bottle entropy\nwith the celebrated Affleck-Ludwig entropy in boundary CFT. We propose a\ngeneric scheme to extract these universal boundary entropies from quantum Monte\nCarlo calculation of partition function ratios in lattice models. Our numerical\nresults on the Affleck-Ludwig entropy and Klein bottle entropy for the\n$q$-state quantum Potts chains with $q=2,3$ show excellent agreement with the\nCFT predictions. For the quantum Potts chain with $q=4$, the Klein bottle\nentropy slightly deviates from the CFT prediction, which is possibly due to\nmarginally irrelevant terms in the low-energy effective theory.\n", "  Color-code quantum computation seamlessly combines Majorana-based hardware\nwith topological error correction. Specifically, as Clifford gates are\ntransversal in two-dimensional color codes, they enable the use of the\nMajoranas' nonabelian statistics for gate operations at the code level. Here,\nwe discuss the implementation of color codes in arrays of Majorana nanowires\nthat avoid branched networks such as T-junctions, thereby simplifying their\nrealization. We show that, in such implementations, nonabelian statistics can\nbe exploited without ever performing physical braiding operations. Physical\nbraiding operations are replaced by Majorana tracking, an entirely\nsoftware-based protocol which appropriately updates the Majoranas involved in\nthe color-code stabilizer measurements. This approach minimizes the required\nhardware operations for single-qubit Clifford gates. For Clifford completeness,\nwe combine color codes with surface codes, and use color-to-surface-code\nlattice surgery for long-range multi-target CNOT gates which have a time\noverhead that grows only logarithmically with the physical distance separating\ncontrol and target qubits. With the addition of magic state distillation, our\narchitecture describes a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer in systems\nsuch as networks of tetrons, hexons, or Majorana box qubits, but can also be\napplied to non-topological qubit platforms.\n", "  Periodic structures with Bloch dispersion relation supporting a stationary\ninflection point (SIP) can display a unique scattering feature, the frozen mode\nregime (FMR). The FMR is much more robust than common cavity resonances; it is\nmuch less sensitive to the boundary conditions, structural imperfections, and\nlosses. Using perturbation theory, we analyze the FMR in the realistic case of\na finite fragment of a periodic structure. We show that in close proximity of\nSIP frequency, the character of the FMR is qualitatively different from the\nknown case of a semi-infinite structure.\n", "  We present a statistical analysis of music scores from different composers\nusing detrended fluctuation analysis. We find different fluctuation profiles\nthat correspond to distinct auto-correlation structures of the musical pieces.\nFurther, we reveal evidence for the presence of nonlinear auto-correlations by\nestimating the detrended fluctuation analysis of the magnitude series, a result\nvalidated by a corresponding study of appropriate surrogate data. The amount\nand the character of nonlinear correlations vary from one composer to another.\nFinally, we performed a simple experiment in order to evaluate the pleasantness\nof the musical surrogate pieces in comparison with the original music and find\nthat nonlinear correlations could play an important role in the aesthetic\nperception of a musical piece.\n", "  We search for passive galaxies at $z>3$ in the GOODS-South field, using\ndifferent techniques based on photometric data, and paying attention to develop\nmethods that are sensitive to objects that have become passive shortly before\nthe epoch of observation. We use CANDELS HST catalogues, ultra-deep $Ks$ data\nand new IRAC photometry, performing spectral energy distribution fitting using\nmodels with abruptly quenched star formation histories. We then single out\ngalaxies which are best fitted by a passively evolving model, and having only\nlow probability $( < 5 \\%)$ star-forming solutions. We verify the effects of\nincluding nebular lines emission, and we consider possible solutions at\ndifferent redshifts. The number of selected sources dramatically depends on the\nmodels used in the SED fitting. Without including emission lines and with\nphotometric redshifts fixed at the CANDELS estimate, we single out 30\ncandidates; the inclusion of nebular lines emission reduces the sample to 10\nobjects; allowing for solutions at different redshifts, only 2 galaxies survive\nas robust candidates. Most of the candidates are not far-infrared emitters,\ncorroborating their association with passive galaxies. Our results translate\ninto an upper limit in the number density of $\\sim 0.173$ arcmin$^2$ above the\ndetection limit. However, we conclude that the selection of passive galaxies at\n$z>3$ is still subject to significant uncertainties, being sensitive to\nassumptions in the SED modeling adopted and to the relatively low S/N of the\nobjects. By means of dedicated simulations, we show that JWST will greatly\nenhance the accuracy, allowing for a much more robust classification.\n", "  The degrees of quantum coherence of cosmological perturbations of different\nspins are computed in the large-scale limit and compared with the standard\nresults holding for a single mode of the electromagnetic field in an optical\ncavity. The degree second-order coherence of curvature inhomogeneities (and,\nmore generally, of the scalar modes of the geometry) reproduces faithfully the\noptical limit. For the vector and tensor fluctuations the numerical values of\nthe normalized degrees of second-order coherence in the zero-time delay limit\nare always larger than unity (which is the Poisson benchmark value) but differ\nfrom the corresponding expressions obtainable in the framework of the\nsingle-mode approximation. General lessons are drawn on the quantum coherence\nof large-scale cosmological fluctuations.\n", "  Optical microscopy offers a unique insight of biological structures with a\nsub-micrometer resolution and a minimum invasiveness. However, the\ninhomogeneities of the specimen itself can induce multiple scattering of light\nand optical aberrations which limit the observation to depths close to the\nsurface. To predict quantitatively the penetration depth in microscopy, we\ntheoretically derive the single-to-multiple scattering ratio in reflection.\nFrom this key quantity, the multiple scattering limit is deduced for various\nmicroscopic imaging techniques such as confocal microscopy, optical coherence\ntomography and related methods.\n", "  This work is aimed to explore the dark dynamical effects of $f(R,T)$ modified\ngravity theory on the dynamics of compact celestial star. We have taken the\ninterior geometry as spherical star which is filled with imperfect fluid\ndistribution. The modified field equations are explored by taking a particular\nform of $f(R,T)$ model, i.e., $f(R,T)=f_1(R)+f_2(R)f_3(T)$. These equations are\nthen utilized to formulate the well-known structure scalars under the dark\ndynamical effects of this higher order gravity theory. Also, the evolution\nequations for expansion and shear are formulated with the help of these scalar\nvariables. Further, all this analysis have been made under the condition of\nconstant $R$ and $T$. We found a crucial significance of dark source terms and\ndynamical variables on the evolution and density inhomogeneity of compact\nobjects.\n", "  We report ALMA observations in 0.87 mm continuum and $^{12}$CO ($J$ = 3--2)\ntoward a very low-luminosity ($<$0.1 $L_{\\odot}$) protostar, which is deeply\nembedded in one of the densest core MC27/L1521F, in Taurus with an indication\nof multiple star formation in a highly dynamical environment. The beam size\ncorresponds to $\\sim$20 AU, and we have clearly detected blueshifted/redshifted\ngas in $^{12}$CO associated with the protostar. The spatial/velocity\ndistributions of the gas show there is a rotating disk with a size scale of\n$\\sim$10 AU, a disk mass of $\\sim$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\\odot}$ and a central stellar\nmass of $\\sim$0.2 $M_{\\odot}$. The observed disk seems to be detached from the\nsurrounding dense gas, although it is still embedded at the center of the core\nwhose density is $\\sim$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$. The current low-outflow activity and\nthe very low luminosity indicate that the mass accretion rate onto the\nprotostar is extremely low in spite of a very early stage of star formation. We\nmay be witnessing the final stage of the formation of $\\sim$0.2 $M_{\\odot}$\nprotostar. However, we cannot explain the observed low luminosity with the\nstandard pre-main-sequence evolutionary track unless we assume cold accretion\nwith an extremely small initial radius of the protostar ($\\sim$0.65 $R_\\odot$).\nThese facts may challenge our current understanding of the low mass star\nformation, in particular the mass accretion process onto the protostar and the\ncircumstellar disk.\n", "  We present a statistical characterization of the $\\gamma$-ray emission from\nthe four \\emph{Fermi}-LAT sources: FR I radio galaxy NGC 1275, BL Lac Mrk 421,\nFSRQs B2 1520+31 and PKS 1510-089 detected almost continuously over a time\nintegration of 3-days between August 2008 - October 2015. The observed flux\nvariation is large, spanning $\\gtrsim 2$ orders of magnitude between the\nextremes except for Mrk~421. We compute the flux distributions and compare with\nGaussian and lognormal ones. We find that the 3 blazars have distribution\nconsistent with a lognormal, suggesting that the variability is of a\nnon-linear, multiplicative nature. This is further supported by the computation\nof the flux-rms relation, which is observed to be linear for the 3 blazars.\nHowever, for NGC 1275, the distribution does not seem to be represented either\nby a lognormal or a Gaussian, while its flux-rms relation is still found to be\nlinear. We also compute the power spectra, which suggest the presence of a\nbreak, but are consistent with typical scale-free power-law shot noise. The\nresults are broadly consistent with the statistical properties of the magnetic\nreconnection powered minijets-in-a-jet model. We discuss other possible\nscenarios and implications of these observations on jet processes and\nconnections with the central engine.\n", "  We investigated the effect of the tensile strain on the spin splitting at the\nn-type interface in LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ in terms of the spin-orbit coupling\ncoefficient $\\alpha$ and spin texture in the momentum space using\nfirst-principles calculations. We found that the $\\alpha$ could be controlled\nby the tensile strain and be enhanced up to 5 times for the tensile strain of\n7%, and the effect of the tensile strain leads to a persistent spin helix,\nwhich has a long spin lifetime. These results support that the strain effect on\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ is important for various applications such as spinFET and\nspin-to-charge conversion.\n", "  We study the impact of inherent mode coupling between clockwise (CW) and\ncounter-clockwise (CCW) modes on Kerr comb generation in a small\nwhispering-gallery mode microcavity. Our numerical analysis using a coupled\nLugiato-Lefever equation reveals the range of the coupling strength in which a\nsoliton pulse can be obtained in the CW direction. It also showed that CCW comb\npower depends on the coupling strength between the CW and CCW modes. In\naddition to the simulation, we conducted an experiment to confirm that the\npower ratio between the CW and CCW comb modes depends on the coupling strength,\nand the experimental results agree well with the simulation results. This study\nhelps us to understand the relationship between CW and CCW mode coupling and\nKerr comb generation, and the effect on soliton formation.\n", "  This article provides a method for quick computation of galaxy two-point\ncorrelation function(2pCF) from redshift surveys using python. One of the\nsalient features of this approach is that it can be used for calculating galaxy\nclustering for any arbitrary geometry (or Cosmology) model. Being efficient\nenough to run fast on a low-spec desktop computer, this `recipe' can be used\nfor quick validation of alternative models and for pedagogical purposes.\n", "  A model is presented of s-wave np elastic scattering as proceeding through an\nintermediate, off-shell dibaryon d*, with corrections to the npd vertex and d*\npropagator. The model relies on plausible conjectures and hypotheses to match\nidentically the form of the simple amplitude given by the shape-independent\neffective range theory (SI ERT), which exactly describes the extant np elastic\ndata (within errors) to at least 3 MeV. The result provides insight into the\nmechanisms involved in np scattering, which go beyond what ERT can reveal\nbecause ERT is a product of wave-mechanics and is therefore generally\nindependent of mechanism. For example, in this model, the signs of the triplet\nand singlet scattering lengths are determined by the (opposite) spatial\nsymmetries of the triplet and singlet np wavefunctions and pion exchange in the\nvertex corrections.\n", "  Yes! Very much so.\n  A chimera state refers to the coexistence of a coherent-incoherent dynamical\nevolution of identically coupled oscillators. We investigate the impact of\nmultiplexing of a lyer having repulsively coupled oscillators on occurrence of\nchimeras in the layer having attractively coupled identical oscillators. We\nreport that there exists an enhancement in the appearance of chimera state in\none layer of multiplex network in the presence of repulsive coupling in the\nother layer. Furthermore, we show that a small amount of inhibition or\nrepulsive coupling in one layer is sufficient to yield chimera state in another\nlayer by destroying its synchronized behavior. These results can be used to get\ninsight into dynamical behaviors of those systems where both attractive and\nrepulsive coupling exist among their constituents.\n", "  For some theoretical and experimental considerations, the relatively light\nMajorana neutrinos at the GeV scale have been attracting some interest. In this\narticle we consider a scenario with only one Majorana neutrino $N$, negligible\nmixing with the active neutrinos $\\nu_{L}$, where the Majorana neutrino\ninteractions could be described in a model independent approach based on an\neffective theory. Under such a framework, we particularly study the feasibility\nof observing the $N$ with mass in the range 0$-$30 GeV via the process $e^+ e^-\n\\to \\nu N \\to\\gamma + \\slashed E$ in the future Belle-II and ILC experiments.\nThe results show that it is unpromising for Belle-II to observe the signal,\nwhile ILC may easily make a discovery for the Majorana neutrino.\n", "  Pairs of pseudoscalar neutral mesons from decays of vector resonances are\nstudied as bipartite systems in the framework of density operator.\nTime-dependent quantum entanglement is quantified in terms of the entanglement\nentropy and these dependences are demonstrated on data on correlated pairs of K\nand B mesons, as measured by the KLOE and Belle experiments . Another\ninteresting characteristics of such bipartite systems are moments of the CP\ndistributions. These moments are directly measurable and they appear to be very\nsensitive to the initial degree of entanglement of a pair.\n", "  Fluid dynamics accompanies with the entropy production thus increases the\nlocal temperature, which plays an important role in charged systems such as the\nion channel in biological environment and electrodiffusion in\ncapacitors/batteries. In this article, we propose a general framework to derive\nthe transport equations with heat flow through the Energetic Variational\nApproach. According to thermodynamic first law, the total energy is conserved\nand we can then use the Least Action Principle to derive the conservative\nforces. From thermodynamic second law, the entropy increases and the\ndissipative forces can be computed with the Maximum Dissipation Principle.\nCombining these two laws, we then conclude with the force balance equations and\na temperature equation. To emphasis, our method provide a self consistent\nprocedure to obtain dynamical equations satisfying proper energy laws and it\nnot only works for the charge systems but also for general systems.\n", "  We study phase ordering kinetics in symmetric and asymmetric binary mixtures,\nundergoing an order-disorder transition below the critical temperature.\nMicroscopically, we model the kinetics via antiferromagnetic Ising model with\nKawasaki spin-exchange kinetics. This conserves the composition while the\norder-parameter (staggered magnetization) is not conserved. The order-parameter\ncorrelation function and structure factor show dynamical scaling, and the\nscaling functions are independent of the mixture composition. The average\ndomain size shows a power-law growth: $L_\\sigma(t)\\sim t^\\alpha$. The\nasymptotic growth regime has $\\alpha=1/2$, though there can be prolonged\ntransients with $\\alpha<1/2$ for asymmetric mixtures. Our unambiguous\nobservation of the asymptotic universal regime is facilitated by using an\naccelerated Monte Carlo technique. We also obtain the coarse-grained free\nenergy from the Hamiltonian, as a function of two order-parameters. The\nevolution of these order-parameters is modeled by using \\textit{Model C}\nkinetics. Similar to the microscopic dynamics, the average domain size of the\nnonconserved order-parameter (staggered magnetization) field exhibits a\npower-law growth: $L_m(t)\\sim t^{1/2}$ at later times, irrespective of the mean\nvalue of the conserved order-parameter (composition) field.\n", "  The paper addresses the stability of the co-authorship networks in time. The\nanalysis is done on the networks of Slovenian researchers in two time periods\n(1991-2000 and 2001-2010). Two researchers are linked if they published at\nleast one scientific bibliographic unit in a given time period. As proposed by\nKronegger et al. (2011), the global network structures are examined by\ngeneralized blockmodeling with the assumed\nmulti-core--semi-periphery--periphery blockmodel type. The term core denotes a\ngroup of researchers who published together in a systematic way with each\nother.\n  The obtained blockmodels are comprehensively analyzed by visualizations and\nthrough considering several statistics regarding the global network structure.\nTo measure the stability of the obtained blockmodels, different adjusted\nmodified Rand and Wallace indices are applied. Those enable to distinguish\nbetween the splitting and merging of cores when operationalizing the stability\nof cores. Also, the adjusted modified indices can be used when new researchers\noccur in the second time period (newcomers) and when some researchers are no\nlonger present in the second time period (departures). The research disciplines\nare described and clustered according to the values of these indices.\nConsidering the obtained clusters, the sources of instability of the research\ndisciplines are studied (e.g., merging or splitting of cores, newcomers or\ndepartures). Furthermore, the differences in the stability of the obtained\ncores on the level of scientific disciplines are studied by linear regression\nanalysis where some personal characteristics of the researchers (e.g., age,\ngender), are also considered.\n", "  Large-eddy simulation (LES) of a turbulent flow through an array of\nbuilding-like obstacles is an idealized model to study transport of\ncontaminants in the urban atmospheric boundary layer (UABL). A reasonably\naccurate LES prediction of turbulence in such an UABL must resolve a\nsignificant proportion of the small but energetic eddies in the roughness\nsublayer, which remains prohibitive even though computational power has been\nincreased significantly. In this article, we present a large-eddy simulation\nmethodology to study turbulence in UABLs, where the turbulence closure is based\non coupling the eddy viscosity method with the canopy stress method. Unlike the\nclassical Smagorinsky model that considers only the strain portion of the\nvelocity gradient tensor, we consider both the strain tensor and the rotation\ntensor to compute the eddy viscosity. This allows us to dynamically adapt the\nrate of energy dissipation to the scales of the energetic eddies in the\nroughness sublayer. Without employing a mesh conforming to the urban roughness\nelements, the effect of such solid bodies are represented in the LES model\nthrough a canopy stress method in which the loss of pressure and the sink of\nmomentum due to the interaction between eddies and roughness elements are\nparameterized using the instantaneous velocity field. Simulation results of the\nproposed canopy stress method is compared with that of a conventional\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method employing a block-structured mesh\nconforming around the roughness elements. For urban flow simulations, the\nresults demonstrate that the proposed canopy stress model is accurate in\npredicting vertical profiles of mean and variance, as well as the temporal\nintermittency of coherent structures.\n", "  We investigate black holes with toroidal horizons in (d +1)-dimensional\nspace-time. Using the solution phase space method, we calculated conserved\ncharges for these black holes before exploring some features of this metric\nincluding its entropy and thermodynamic quantities. Another aspect of the study\ninvolves obtaining a general exact static interior solution for uncharged black\nholes with toroidal horizons in (d+1)-dimensional space-time. Finally, an\ninterior solution for charged black holes is obtained.\n", "  Flavour-changing neutral currents are extremely rare processes in the\nstandard model that can be sensitive to various new physics effects. The\nsummary of the latest experimental results from the LHC experiments is given.\nPreliminary results of sensitivity studies for future colliders are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We explore the application of Bayesian image analysis to infer the properties\nof an SDSS early-type galaxy sample including AGN. We use GALPHAT (Yoon et al.\n2010) with a Bayes-factor model comparison to photometrically infer an AGN\npopulation and verify this using spectroscopic signatures. Our combined\nposterior sample for the SDSS sample reveals distinct low and high\nconcentration modes after the point-source flux is modeled. This suggests that\nETG parameters are intrinsically bimodal. The bimodal signature was weak when\nanalyzed by GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002, 2010). This led us to create several\nensembles of synthetic images to investigate the bias of inferred structural\nparameters and compare with GALFIT. GALPHAT inferences are less biased,\nespecially for high-concentration profiles: GALPHAT S\\'ersic index $n$, $r_{e}$\nand MAG deviate from the true values by $6\\%$, $7.6\\%$ and $-0.03\n\\,\\mathrm{mag}$, respectively, while GALFIT deviates by $15\\%$, $22\\%$ and\n$-0.09$\\, mag, respectively. In addition, we explore the reliability for the\nphotometric detection of AGN using Bayes factors. For our SDSS sample with\n$r_{e}\\ge 7.92\\,$arcsec, we correctly identify central point sources with\n$\\mathrm{Mag_{PS}}-\\mathrm{Mag_{Sersic}}\\le 5$ for $n\\le6$ and\n$\\mathrm{Mag_{PS}}-\\mathrm{Mag_{Sersic}}\\le 3$ for $n>6$. The magnitude range\nincreases and classification error decreases with increasing resolution,\nsuggesting that this approach will excel for upcoming high-resolution surveys.\nFuture work will extend this to models that test hypotheses of galaxy evolution\nthrough the cosmic time.\n", "  The Johannsen-Psaltis spacetime is a perturbation of the Kerr spacetime\ndesigned to avoid pathologies like naked singularities and closed timelike\ncurves. This spacetime depends not only on the mass and the spin of the compact\nobject, but also on extra parameters, making the spacetime deviate from Kerr;\nin this work we consider only the lowest order physically meaningful extra\nparameter. We use numerical examples to show that geodesic motion in this\nspacetime can exhibit chaotic behavior. We study the corresponding phase space\nby using Poincar\\'{e} sections and rotation numbers to show chaotic behavior,\nand we use Lyapunov exponents to directly estimate the sensitivity to initial\nconditions for chaotic orbits.\n", "  Every supernova hitherto observed has been considered to be the terminal\nexplosion of a star. Moreover, all supernovae with absorption lines in their\nspectra show those lines decreasing in velocity over time, as the ejecta expand\nand thin, revealing slower moving material that was previously hidden. In\naddition, every supernova that exhibits the absorption lines of hydrogen has\none main light-curve peak, or a plateau in luminosity, lasting approximately\n100 days before declining. Here we report observations of iPTF14hls, an event\nthat has spectra identical to a hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova, but\ncharacteristics that differ extensively from those of known supernovae. The\nlight curve has at least five peaks and remains bright for more than 600 days;\nthe absorption lines show little to no decrease in velocity; and the radius of\nthe line-forming region is more than an order of magnitude bigger than the\nradius of the photosphere derived from the continuum emission. These\ncharacteristics are consistent with a shell of several tens of solar masses\nejected by the star at supernova-level energies a few hundred days before a\nterminal explosion. Another possible eruption was recorded at the same position\nin 1954. Multiple energetic pre-supernova eruptions are expected to occur in\nstars of 95-130 solar masses, which experience the pulsational pair\ninstability. That model, however, does not account for the continued presence\nof hydrogen, or the energetics observed here. Another mechanism for the violent\nejection of mass in massive stars may be required.\n", "  We investigate the performance of a quantum algorithm for solving classical\n3-SAT problems. A cycle of post-selected measurements drives the computer's\nregister monotonically toward a steady state which is correlated to the\nclassical solution(s). An internal parameter $\\theta$ determines both the\ndegree of correlation and the success probability, thus controlling the\nalgorithm's runtime. Optionally this parameter can be gradually evolved during\nthe algorithm's execution to create a Zeno-like effect; this can be viewed as\nan adiabatic evolution of a Hamiltonian which remains frustration-free at all\npoints, and we lower-bound the corresponding gap. In exact numerical\nsimulations of small systems up to 34 qubits our approach competes favourably\nwith a high-performing classical 3-SAT solver, which itself outperforms a\nbrute-force application of Grover's search.\n", "  I study the measurement of the influence of scientists based on bibliographic\ndata. I propose a new measure that accounts for indirect influence and allows\nto compare scientists across different fields of science. By contrast, common\nmeasures of influence that \"count citations\", such as the h-index, are unable\nto satisfy either of these two properties. I use the axiomatic method in two\nopposite ways: to highlight the two limitations of citation-counting schemes\nand their independence, and to carefully justify the assumptions made in the\nconstruction of the proposed measure.\n", "  The crystallographic and magnetic properties of the cleavable 4d3 transition\nmetal compound a-MoCl3 are reported, with a focus on the behavior above room\ntemperature. Crystals were grown by chemical vapor transport and characterized\nusing temperature dependent x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and\nmagnetization measurements. A structural phase transition occurs near 585 K, at\nwhich the Mo-Mo dimers present at room temperature are broken. A nearly regular\nhoneycomb net of Mo is observed above the transition, and an optical phonon\nassociated with the dimerization instability is identified in the Raman data\nand in first-principles calculations. The crystals are diamagnetic at room\ntemperature in the dimerized state, and the magnetic susceptibility increases\nsharply at the structural transition. Moderately strong paramagnetism in the\nhigh-temperature structure indicates the presence of local moments on Mo. This\nis consistent with results of spin-polarized density functional theory\ncalculations using the low- and high-temperature structures. Above the\nmagnetostructural phase transition the magnetic susceptibility continues to\nincrease gradually up to the maximum measurement temperature of 780 K, with a\ntemperature dependence that suggests two-dimensional antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations.\n", "  In a recent letter [1], Zaitsev et al. report observations of evaporating\nwater micro-droplets over a heated solid substrate and suggest a model for the\nmechanisms of both droplet levitation and inter-droplet interaction. According\nto their model, the reflection of the Stefan flow (due to droplet evaporation)\noff the substrate is the mechanism of levitation, while the same Stefan flow\nalso results in droplet repulsion preventing them from merging. They further\napply their model to explain the levitation of droplets over a liquid surface\nand suggest the h/R~R^-3/2 dependency for the droplet radius R vs. the height\nof its center above the surface, h. While there is no doubt that the\nexperimentally observed phenomenon is of interest, here we show that the\nobservations should be interpreted differently.\n", "  We review methods used in recent works for constructing handlebody solutions\nof Einstein's equations in 2+1 dimensions. Additionally, we provide a\nMathematica package for computing the action and the boundary moduli of these\nsolutions in a canonical conformal frame.\n", "  The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), launched in June 2012,\nflies two conical approximation Wolter-I mirrors at the end of a 10.15m mast.\nThe optics are coated with multilayers of Pt/C and W/Si that operate from 3--80\nkeV. Since the optical path is not shrouded, aperture stops are used to limit\nthe field of view from background and sources outside the field of view.\nHowever, there is still a sliver of sky (~1.0--4.0 degrees) where photons may\nbypass the optics altogether and fall directly on the detector array. We term\nthese photons Stray-light. Additionally, there are also photons that do not\nundergo the focused double reflections in the optics and we term these Ghost\nRays. We present detailed analysis and characterization of these two components\nand discuss how they impact observations. Finally, we discuss how they could\nhave been prevented and should be in future observatories.\n", "  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) hosts a large number of candidate stellar\ncluster pairs. Binary stellar clusters provide important clues about cluster\nformation processes and the evolutionary history of the host galaxy. However,\nto properly extract and interpret this information, it is crucial to fully\nconstrain the fraction of real binary systems and their physical properties.\nHere we present a detailed photometric analysis based on ESO-FORS2 images of\nthree candidate cluster multiplets in the LMC, namely SL349-SL353,\nSL385-SL387-NGC1922 and NGC1836-BRHT4b-NGC1839. For each cluster we derived\nages, structural parameters and morphological properties. We have also\nestimated the degree of filling of their Roche lobe, as an approximate tool to\nmeasure the strength of the tidal perturbations induced by the LMC. We find\nthat the members of the possible pairs SL349-SL353 and BRHT4b-NGC1839 have a\nsimilar age ($t = 1.00 \\pm 0.12$ Gyr and $t = 140 \\pm 15$ Myr, respectively),\nthus possibly hinting to a common origin of their member systems We also find\nthat all candidate pairs in our sample show evidence of intra-cluster\noverdensities that can be a possible indication of real binarity. Particularly\ninteresting is the case of SL349-SL353. In fact, SL353 is relatively close to\nthe condition of critical filling, thus suggesting that these systems might\nactually constitute an energetically bound pair. It is therefore key to pursue\na detailed kinematic screening of such clusters, without which, at present, we\ndo not dare making a conclusive statement about the true nature of this\nputative pair.\n", "  We investigate the implications of integrability for the existence of quantum\ndisentangled liquid (QDL) states in the half-filled one-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel. We argue that there exist finite energy-density eigenstates that exhibit\nQDL behaviour in the sense of J. Stat. Mech. P10010 (2014). These states are\natypical in the sense that their entropy density is smaller than that of\nthermal states at the same energy density. Furthermore, we show that thermal\nstates in a particular temperature window exhibit a weaker form of the QDL\nproperty, in agreement with recent results obtained by strong-coupling\nexpansion methods in arXiv:1611.02075. This article is part of the themed issue\n`Breakdown of ergodicity in quantum systems: from solids to synthetics matter'.\n", "  We implement a procedure to simulate the drainage and imbibition in random,\ntwo-dimensional, square networks. We compute the resistivity index, the\nrelative permeability, and the characteristic lengths of a correlated network\nat various saturation states, under the assumption that the surface\nconductivity can be neglected. These parameters exhibit a hysteretic behaviour.\nThen, we calculate the Spectral Induced Polarization (SIP) response of the\nmedium, under the assumption that the electrical impedance of each tube follows\na local Warburg conductivity model, with identical DC conductivity and\nchargeability for all the tubes. We evidence that the shape of the SIP spectra\ndepends on the saturation state. The analysis of the evolution of the\nmacroscopic Cole-Cole parameters of the spectra in function of the saturation\nalso behaves hysteretically, except for the Cole-Cole exponent. We also observe\na power-law relationship between the macroscopic DC conductivity and time\nconstant and the relative permeability. We also show that the frequency peak of\nthe phase spectra is directly related to the characteristic length and to the\nrelative permeability, underlining the potential interest of SIP measurements\nfor the estimation of the permeability of unsaturated media.\n", "  We review several aspects of anti-De Sitter (AdS) spaces in different\ndimensions, and of four dimensional Schwarzschild anti-De Sitter (SAdS) black\nhole.\n", "  A short version of the recent proposal to measure elastic scattering of\nprotons at the Protvino proton synchrocyclotron U-70.\n", "  Layered materials have uncommonly anisotropic thermal properties due to their\nstrong in-plane covalent bonds and weak out-of-plane van der Waals\ninteractions. Here we examine heat flow in graphene (graphite), h-BN, MoS2, and\nWS2 monolayers and bulk films, from diffusive to ballistic limits. We determine\nthe ballistic thermal conductance limit (Gball) both in-plane and out-of-plane,\nbased on full phonon dispersions from first-principles calculations. An overall\nphonon mean free path ({\\lambda}) is expressed in terms of Gball and the\ndiffusive thermal conductivity, consistent with kinetic theory if proper\naveraging of phonon group velocity is used. We obtain a size-dependent thermal\nconductivity k(L) in agreement with available experiments, and find that k(L)\nonly converges to >90% of the diffusive thermal conductivity for sample sizes L\n> 16{\\lambda}, which ranges from ~140 nm for MoS2 cross-plane to ~10 um for\nsuspended graphene in-plane. These results provide a deeper understanding of\nmicroscopic thermal transport, revealing that device scales below which thermal\nsize effects should be taken into account are generally larger than previously\nthought.\n", "  We present a blind multiframe image-deconvolution method based on robust\nstatistics. The usual shortcomings of iterative optimization of the likelihood\nfunction are alleviated by minimizing the M-scale of the residuals, which\nachieves more uniform convergence across the image. We focus on the\ndeconvolution of astronomical images, which are among the most challenging due\nto their huge dynamic ranges and the frequent presence of large noise-dominated\nregions in the images. We show that high-quality image reconstruction is\npossible even in super-resolution and without the use of traditional\nregularization terms. Using a robust \\r{ho}-function is straightforward to\nimplement in a streaming setting and, hence our method is applicable to the\nlarge volumes of astronomy images. The power of our method is demonstrated on\nobservations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Stripe 82) and we briefly\ndiscuss the feasibility of a pipeline based on Graphical Processing Units for\nthe next generation of telescope surveys.\n", "  The re-analysis of measured $^{238}U$ integrated electron spectrum reveals a\nshape mismatch with respect to the so called ab initio calculation and the\nratio resembles well with the recently observed reactor antineutrino shoulder\nor bump around 5 MeV prompt energy when plotted in a reduced scale where the\nfirst two moments (area and average) of the spectrum are made identical (KNO\ntype scaling). However, such bumps are not seen in case of other actinides like\n$^{235}U$ and $^{239,241}Pu$ isotopes. Since the magnitude of the bump in\n$^{238}U$ is comparable with the experimental observations, $^{238}U$ can not\nbe the only source of anomaly unless similar contributions come from other\nuranium and plutonium isotopes as well. Therefore, it is strongly conjectured\nthat the integrated electron spectra of uranium and plutonium isotopes\nparticularly in the $6$ MeV to $8$ MeV energy range may have additional\ncontributions coming from the harder part of the reactor neutron spectrum which\nmay not be present in the thermal measurements.\n", "  We report a controllable and precision approach in manipulating catalytic\nnanomotors by strategically applied electric (E-) fields in three dimensions\n(3-D). With the high controllability, the catalytic nanomotors have\ndemonstrated new versa-tility in capturing, delivering, and releasing of cargos\nto designated locations as well as in-situ integration with nanome-chanical\ndevices (NEMS) to chemically power the actuation. With combined AC and DC\nE-fields, catalytic nanomotors can be accurately aligned by the AC E-fields and\ninstantly change their speeds by the DC E-fields. Within the 3-D orthog-onal\nmicroelectrode sets, the in-plane transport of catalytic nanomotors can be\nswiftly turned on and off, and these cata-lytic nanomotors can also move in the\nvertical direction. The interplaying nanoforces that govern the propulsion and\nalignment are investigated. The modeling of catalytic nanomotors proposed in\nprevious works has been confirmed quan-titatively here. Finally, the prowess of\nthe precision manipulation of catalytic nanomotors by E-fields is demonstrated\nin two applications: the capture, transport, and release of cargos to\npre-patterned microdocks, and the assembly of catalytic nanomotors on NEMS to\npower the continuous rotation. The innovative concepts and approaches reported\nin this work could further advance ideal applications of catalytic nanomotors,\ne.g. for assembling and powering nanomachines, nano-robots, and complex NEMS\ndevices.\n", "  The LHC did not discover new particles beyond the Standard Model Higgs boson\nat 7 and 8 TeV, or in the first data samples at 13 TeV. However, the\ncomplementary nature of physics with $e^+e^-$ collisions still offers many\ninteresting scenarios in which new particles can be discovered at the ILC.\nThese scenarios take advantage of the capability of $e^+e^-$ collisions to\nobserve particles with missing energy and small mass differences, to observe\nmono-photon events with precisely controlled backgrounds, and to observe the\nfull range of exotic decay modes of the Higgs boson. The searches that an\n$e^+e^-$ collider makes possible are particularly important for models of dark\nmatter involving a dark sector with particles above the modest energy reach of\nfixed-target experiments. In this talk, we will review the opportunities that\nthe ILC offers for new particle discovery.\n", "  There are indications that the beam energy region $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\approx 10$\nGeV for heavy-ion collisions is an interesting one. The final state has the\nhighest net baryon density at this beam energy. A transition from a baryon\ndominated to a meson dominated final state takes place around this beam energy.\nRatios of strange particles to mesons show clear and pronounced maxima around\nthis beam energy. The theoretical interpretation can be clarified by covering\nfully this energy region. In particular the strangeness content needs to be\ndetermined, data covering the full phase space ($4 \\pi$) would be helpful to\nestablish the properties of this energy region.\n", "  Transient interaction of magnetic dipole with plasma flow carrying southward\nmagnetic field is studied in laboratory experiment. The flow with transverse\nfrozen-in field is generated by means of laser-produced plasma cross-field\nexpansion into background plasma which fills vacuum chamber along externally\napplied magnetic field prior to interaction. Probe measurements showed that at\nrealized plasma parameters effective collisionless Larmor coupling takes place\nresulting in formation of strong compressive perturbation which propagates in\nbackground with super-Alfvenic velocity and generates in laboratory frame\ntransverse electric field comparable in value to expected induction one.\nCompression pulse with southward field after short propagation interacts with\ndipole and creates well defined magnetosphere. Comparison of magnetospheres\ncreated by laser-produced plasma expanding in vacuum field and in magnetized\nbackground revealed fundamental differences in structure and behavior of\nelectric potential in plasma. In presence of frozen-in southward field direct\n{\\guillemotleft}sub-solar{\\guillemotright} penetration of outside electric\npotential deep inside of magnetosphere was observed taking place with velocity\nclose to upstream Alfven speed.\n", "  Our understanding of stars through asteroseismic data analysis is limited by\nour ability to take advantage of the huge amount of observed stars provided by\nspace missions such as CoRoT, Kepler, K2, and soon TESS and PLATO. Global\nseismic pipelines provide global stellar parameters such as mass and radius\nusing the mean seismic parameters, as well as the effective temperature. These\npipelines are commonly used automatically on thousands of stars observed by K2\nfor 3 months (and soon TESS for at least around 1 month). However, pipelines\nare not immune from misidentifying noise peaks and stellar oscillations.\nTherefore, new validation techniques are required to assess the quality of\nthese results. We present a new metric called FliPer (Flicker in Power), which\ntakes into account the average variability at all measured time scales. The\nproper calibration of FliPer enables us to obtain good estimations of global\nstellar parameters such as surface gravity that are robust against the\ninfluence of noise peaks and hence are an excellent way to find faults in\nasteroseismic pipelines.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the dynamics of two- scalar-field cosmological\nmodels. Unlike in the situation of exponential potential, we find that there\nare late-time attractors in which one scalar field dominates the energy density\nof universe and the other one decay. We also discuss the possibility of\nmultiple attractors model which is useful to realize the evolution of the\nuniverse from a scaling era to recent acceleration era. We also give the\nconditions of the existence of multiple attractors.\n", "  Recent advances in intense short pulse laser interaction with thin foil\nenable us to accelerates the ions upto relativistic velocity in a controlled\nway. The accelerated ion beams can be utilized to generate the ion vortex beam\nin a similar way as it has been done for electron, neutron and photon vortex\nbeam case. We present a theoretical demonstration of ion vortex beam with\norbital angular mo- mentum (OAM) generated from a relativistic laser-matter\ninteraction rearranged into vortex beam by using phase shifter or computer\ngenerated holography. We show that a Laguerre-Gaussian beam exit for\nSchrodinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac particles. This study will motivate to\nexplore the existence of ion vortex beam experimentally.\n", "  We study the shadow of rotating charge black holes in the presence of\nquintessence. The shadow of a rotating black hole is a distorted circle and in\nour study, we find that the shape and size of the black hole shadow depend upon\nfour parameters, i.e., charge $q$, spin parameter $a$, quintessential field\nparameter $\\omega_q$ and normalization factor $c$. The parameter $\\omega_q$ can\ntake the value between $-1<\\omega_q<-1/3$ and related with pressure $p$ and\ndensity $\\rho_q$ by the equation of state $p=\\omega_q \\rho_q$. We derive the\ncomplete geodesic structure of photon near black hole using the Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation and Carter constant separable method. We relate celestial coordinate\nto geodesics equation and plot the contour of the black hole shadow for the\ncase $\\omega_q=-2/3$. We compare our results with the standard Kerr-Newman\nblack hole and find that for a fix value of $a$ and $q$, the black hole shadow\ndecreases and get distorted with $c$. The area of the photon sphere is equal to\nthe high-energy absorption cross section due to the optical properties of the\nblack hole. On the basis of this assumption we calculate the energy emission\nrate of the black hole.\n", "  A concept for the efficient generation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)\nwith a duration of very few cycles is presented. The scheme is based on grating\ncoupling and laser pulses with wavefront rotation (WFR), so that the resonance\ncondition for SPP excitation is satisfied only for a time window shorter than\nthe driving pulse. The feasibility and robustness of the technique is\ninvestigated by means of simulations with realistic parameters. In optimal\nconditions, we find that a $29.5$~fs pulse with $800$~nm wavelength can excite\na $3.8$~fs SPP ($\\sim 1.4$ laser cycles) with a peak field amplitude $2.7$\ntimes the peak value for the laser pulse.\n", "  Superconducting (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe films are attractive for both the basic\nresearch and practical application. However, the conventional vapor deposition\ntechniques are not applicable in synthesizing the films of such a complex\nsystem. So no intrinsic charge transport measurements on the films are\navailable so far to reveal the nature of charge carriers, which is fundamental\nto understanding the iron-based superconductivity mechanism. Herein we report a\nsoft chemical film technique (matrix-assisted hydrothermal epitaxial growth),\nby which we have succeeded in growing a series of (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe films\ncovering the whole superconducting regime, with the superconducting transition\ntemperature (Tc) from 4 K up to 42 K. This film technique opens up a new way\nfor fabricating other complex functional materials as well. Furthermore, our\nsystematic transport investigation on the film samples indicates that both the\nelectron and hole carriers contribute to the charge transport, with the\nscattering rates deviating from the Fermi liquid. We find that the\nsuperconductivity occurs upon the electron and hole mobility becoming\ndivergent. And in the high Tc samples, the electron carriers are found much\nmore mobile than the holes, a feature distinct from the low Tc samples. Hence,\nour transport results provide key insights into the underlying physics for\niron-based high-Tc superconductivity.\n", "  In a recent article [Phys. Rev. A 94, 052128 (2016)], the authors compute the\npredictions of two collapse models on the transition probabilities of neutral\nmesons. Notably, they claim to find an influence on the decay rates and attempt\nto prove that a new parameter $\\theta(0)$ is required to fully characterize the\nnoise of standard collapse models. These two claims are incorrect and motivated\nby flawed computations. This comment derives the correct transition\nprobabilities exactly from the master equation, explains how they could be\ncomputed perturbatively in a safe way and finally shows where the main mistake\nof the authors of the original article was made.\n", "  We report on a recent calculation of the complete NLO QCD and electroweak\ncorrections to the process $pp\\to\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu e^+\\nu_ejj$, i.e. like-sign\ncharged vector-boson scattering. The computation is based on the complete\namplitudes involving two different orders of the strong and electroweak\ncoupling constants at tree level and three different orders at one-loop level.\nWe find electroweak corrections of $-13\\%$ for the fiducial cross section that\nare an intrinsic feature of the vector-boson scattering process. For\ndifferential distributions, the corrections reach up to $-40\\%$ in the\nphase-space regions explored. At the NLO level a unique separation between\nvector-boson scattering and irreducible background processes is not possible\nany more at the level of Feynman diagrams.\n", "  The Large Hadron Collider has entered a new era in Run 2, with centre-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV and instantaneous luminosity reaching\n$\\mathcal{L}_\\textrm{inst} = 1.4\\times$10$^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for pp\ncollisions. In order to cope with those harsher conditions, the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations have improved their online selection infrastructure to keep a\nhigh efficiency for important physics processes - like W, Z and Higgs bosons in\ntheir leptonic and diphoton modes - whilst keeping the size of data stream\ncompatible with the bandwidth and disk resources available. In this note, we\ndescribe some of the trigger improvements implemented for Run 2, including\nalgorithms for selection of electrons, photons, muons and hadronic final\nstates.\n", "  Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict a parallel\nsector of a new U(1) symmetry, giving rise to hidden photons. These hidden\nphotons are candidate particles for cold dark matter. They are expected to\nkinetically mix with regular photons, which leads to a tiny oscillating\nelectric-field component accompanying dark matter particles. A conducting\nsurface can convert such dark matter particles into photons which are emitted\nalmost perpendicularly to the surface. The corresponding photon frequency\nfollows from the mass of the hidden photons. In this contribution we present a\npreliminary result on a hidden photon search in the visible and near-UV\nwavelength range that was done with a large, 14 m2 spherical metallic mirror\nand discuss future dark matter searches in the eV and sub-eV range by\napplication of different detectors for electromagnetic radiation.\n", "  The aim of this work is to study the non-equilibrium dynamics of electrons in\na coupled quantum well pair. To achieve this aim, we consider a non-symmetric\ndistribution of electrons in a double quantum well. We derive the nonlinear\ndynamical evolution of the carrier wave functions considering electron-phonon\ninteractions and a time-dependent Hartree potential in multielectron quantum\ndots. We show the possibility of having an electrostatic trap for part of the\nelectrons which are injected into one of the quantum wells.\n", "  It has been proposed that an additional U(1) sector of hidden photons could\naccount for the Dark Matter observed in the Universe. When passing through an\ninterface of materials with different dielectric properties, hidden photons can\ngive rise to photons whose wavelengths are related to the mass of the hidden\nphotons. In this contribution we report on measurements covering the visible\nand near-UV spectrum that were done with a large, 14 m2 spherical metallic\nmirror and discuss future dark-matter searches in the eV and sub-eV range by\napplication of different electromagnetic radiation detectors.\n", "  We present the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the antiferromagnet\nCeAg$_2$Si$_2$ established via resistivity and calorimetry measurements under\nquasi-hydrostatic conditions up to 22.5~GPa. With increasing pressure, the\nN\\'eel temperature [$T_{\\mathrm{N}}(p=0)=8.6$~K] slowly increases up to\n$T_{\\mathrm{N}}=13.4$~K at 9.4~GPa and then vanishes abruptly at the magnetic\ncritical pressure $p_{\\mathrm{c}}\\sim13$~GPa. For the first time, heavy fermion\nsuperconductivity is observed in CeAg$_2$Si$_2$ . Superconductivity emerges at\n$\\sim 11$~GPa and persists over roughly 10~GPa. Partial- and bulk-transition\ntemperatures are highest at $p=16$~GPa, with a maximal $T_{\\mathrm{c}^{\\rm\nbulk}}=1.25$~K. In the pressure region of superconductivity, Kondo and\ncrystal-field splitting energies become comparable and resistivity exhibits\nclear signatures of a Ce-ion valence crossover. The crossover line is located\nat a rapid collapse in resistivity as function of pressure and extrapolates to\na valence transition critical endpoint at critical pressure and temperature of\n$p_{\\rm cr}\\sim 17$~GPa and $T_{\\rm cr}\\sim-13~K$, respectively. Both critical\nspin and valence fluctuations may build up superconductivity in CeAg$_2$Si$_2$.\n", "  In social tagging systems, the diversity of tag vocabulary and the popularity\nof such tags continue to increase as they are exposed to selection pressure\nderived from our cognitive nature and cultural preferences. This is analogous\nto living ecosystems, where mutation and selection play a dominant role. Such\npopulation dynamism, which yields a scaling law, is mathematically modeled by a\nsimple stochastic process---the Yule--Simon process, which describes how new\nwords are introduced to the system and then grow. However, in actual web\nservices, we have observed that a large fluctuation emerges in the popularity\ngrowth of individual tags that cannot be explained by the ordinary selection\nmechanism. We introduce a scaling factor to quantify the degree of the\ndeviation in the popularity growth from the mean-field solution of the\nYule--Simon process, and we discuss possible triggers of such anomalous\npopularity behavior.\n", "  In this paper, we describe the one-loop contributions in QED with Rashba\ncoupling. We show that all purely nonminimal contributions are explicitly\nfinite, so, the whole theory is one-loop renormalizable.\n", "  In these lecture notes of the Autumn School on Correlated Electrons 2017 I\ndiscuss the relationships among the Kondo physics and the Mott transition.\n", "  The principal of linear superposition is investigated in the computational\nsystem of a solid spherical absorber immersed in a transparent aqueous medium\nand illuminated by a laser pulse. The absorber is exposed to a single top-hat\npulse and to a fraction of the pulse from which a superimposed response is\ncalculated. The results clearly show the transition of the system from a low\nfluence linear state where superposition is valid to a high fluence nonlinear\nstate where the superposition is violated. The procedure described in the text\ncan be used to find the transition to nonlinearity in a given excited system.\nThis work can lead to better understanding and quantifying the transition from\nlinear to non-linear regimes in complex systems.\n", "  It is described a nonlocal interaction between entangled quantum objects,\nwhich is initiated by a process different from the reduction of the wave\nfunction. The scheme of an experiment realizing a deterministic nonlocal\nquantum evolution is proposed. In the case of the negative result of the\nexperiment, the universal character of the integral wave equation with a kernel\nin the form of a path integral is questionable, otherwise faster-then-light\ncommunication is possible\n", "  In this paper we compare two different notions of 'power', both of which\nattempt to provide a realist understanding of quantum mechanics grounded on the\npotential mode of existence. For this propose we will begin by introducing two\ndifferent notions of potentiality present already within Aristotelian\nmetaphysics, namely, irrational potentiality and rational potentiality. After\ndiscussing the role played by potentiality within classical and quantum\nmechanics, we will address the notion of causal power which is directly related\nto irrational potentiality and has been adopted by many interpretations of QM.\nWe will then present the notion of immanent power which relates to rational\npotentiality and argue that this new concept presents important advantages\nregarding the possibilities it provides for understanding in a novel manner the\ntheory of quanta. We end our paper with a comparison between both notions of\n'power', stressing some radical differences between them.\n", "  We consider a quantum mechanical model for the high-order harmonic generation\nin bulk solids. The bandgap is assumed to be considerably larger than the\nexciting photon energy. Using dipole approximation, the dynamical equations for\ndifferent initial Bloch states are decoupled in the velocity gauge. Although\nthere is no quantum mechanical interference between the time evolution of\ndifferent initial states, the complete harmonic radiation results from the\ninterference of fields emitted by all the initial (valence band) states. In\nparticular, this interference is shown to be responsible for the suppression of\nthe even order harmonics. The number of the observable harmonics (essentially\nthe cutoff) is also determined by electromagnetic field interference.\n", "  The Cepheid Period-Luminosity law is a key rung on the extragalactic distance\nladder. However, numerous Cepheids are known to undergo period variations.\nMonitoring, refining, and understanding these period variations allows us to\nbetter determine the parameters of the Cepheids themselves and of the\ninstability strip in which they reside, and to test models of stellar\nevolution. VZ Cyg, a classical Cepheid pulsating at $\\sim$4.864 days, has been\nobserved for over 100 years. Combining data from literature observations, the\nKilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) transit survey, and new targeted\nobservations with the Robotically Controlled Telescope (RCT) at Kitt Peak, we\nfind a period change rate of $dP/dt = -0.0642 \\pm 0.0018$ sec yr$^{-1}$.\nHowever, when only the recent observations are examined, we find a much higher\nperiod change rate of $dP/dt = - 0.0923 \\pm 0.0110$ sec yr$^{-1}$. This higher\nrate could be due to an apparent long-term (P $\\approx$ 26.5 yr) cyclic period\nvariation. The possible interpretations of this single Cepheid's complex period\nvariations underscore both the need to regularly monitor pulsating variables,\nand the important benefits that photometric surveys such as KELT can have on\nthe field. Further monitoring of this interesting example of Cepheid\nvariability is recommended to confirm and better understand the possible cyclic\nperiod variations. Further, Cepheid timing analyses are necessary to fully\nunderstand their current behaviors and parameters, as well as their\nevolutionary histories.\n", "  We introduce an inhomogeneous bosonic mixture composed of two kinds of\nhard-core and semi-hard-core bosons with different nilpotency conditions and\ndemonstrate that in contrast with the standard hard-core Bose-Hubbard model,\nour bosonic mixture with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions on a\nsquare lattice develops the checkerboard supersolid phase characterized by the\nsimultaneous superfluid and checkerboard solid orders. Our bosonic mixture is\ncreated from a two-orbital Bose-Hubbard model including two kinds of bosons: a\nsingle-orbital boson and a two-orbital boson. By mapping the bosonic mixture to\nan anisotropic inhomogeneous spin model in the presence of a magnetic field, we\nstudy the ground-state phase diagram of the model by means of cluster mean\nfield theory and linear spin-wave theory and show that various phases such as\nsolid, superfluid, supersolid, and Mott insulator appear in the phase diagram\nof the mixture. Competition between the interactions and magnetic field causes\nthe mixture to undergo different kinds of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions. By studying the behavior of the spin-wave excitations, we find the\nreasons of all first- and second-order phase transitions. We also obtain the\ntemperature phase diagram of the system using cluster mean field theory. We\nshow that the checkerboard supersolid phase persists at finite temperature\ncomparable with the interaction energies of bosons.\n", "  Well-ordered stepped semiconductor surfaces attract intense attention owing\nto the regular arrangements of their atomic steps that makes them perfect\ntemplates for the growth of one- dimensional systems, e.g. nanowires. Here, we\nreport on the atomic structure of the vicinal Si(111) surface with 10 degree\nmiscut investigated by a joint frequency-modulation scanning force microscopy\n(FM-SFM) and ab initio approach. This popular stepped surface contains 7 x\n7-reconstructed terraces oriented along the Si(111) direction, separated by a\nstepped region. Recently, the atomic structure of this triple step based on\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images has been subject of debate. Unlike\nSTM, SFM atomic resolution capability arises from chemical bonding of the tip\napex with the surface atoms. Thus, for surfaces with a corrugated density of\nstates such as semiconductors, SFM provides complementary information to STM\nand partially removes the dependency of the topography on the electronic\nstructure. Our FM-SFM images with unprecedented spatial resolution on steps\nconfirm the model based on a (7 7 10) orientation of the surface and reveal\nstructural details of this surface. Two different FM-SFM contrasts together\nwith density functional theory calculations explain the presence of defects,\nbuckling and filling asymmetries on the surface. Our results evidence the\nimportant role of charge transfers between adatoms, restatoms, and dimers in\nthe stabilisation of the structure of the vicinal surface.\n", "  Results obtained in the past for free boson systems at zero and nonzero\ntemperature are revisited to clarify the physical meaning of current algebra\nreducible functionals which are associated to systems with density\nfluctuations, leading to observable effects on phase transitions. To use\ncurrent algebra as a tool for the formulation of quantum statistical mechanics\namounts to the construction of unitary representations of diffeomorphism\ngroups. Two mathematical equivalent procedures exist for this purpose. One\nsearches for quasi-invariant measures on configuration spaces, the other for a\ncyclic vector in Hilbert space. Here, one argues that the second approach is\ncloser to the physical intuition when modelling complex systems. An example of\napplication of the current algebra methodology to the pairing phenomenon in\ntwo-dimensional fermion systems is discussed.\n", "  Caprock integrity is one of the chief concerns in the successful development\nof a CO$_2$ storage site. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the\npermeability of fractured shale, the potential for mitigation of CO$_2$ leakage\nby sorption to shale, and the detection by acoustic methods of CO$_2$\ninfiltration into shale. Although significant concerns have been raised about\nthe potential for induced seismicity to damage caprock, relatively little is\nknown about the permeability of the damaged shale. We present a summary of\nrecent experimental work that shows profound differences in permeability of up\nto three orders of magnitude between brittle and ductile fracture permeability.\nIn the ductile regime, it is possible that shale caprock could accommodate\ndeformation without a significant loss of CO$_2$ from the storage reservoir. In\ncases where CO$_2$ does migrate through damaged shale caprock, CO$_2$ sorption\nonto shale mineralogy may have a mitigating impact. Measured total storage\ncapacities range from 1 to 45 kg-CO$_2$/tonne-shale. Once CO$_2$ is in the\ncaprock, changes in the acoustic properties of CO$_2$-saturated shale that are\npredicted by Gassmann fluid substitution calculations show a significant\nreduction of the bulk modulus of CO$_2$-saturated shale.\n", "  Measurements of $D^{*}(2010)$ meson production in diffractive deep inelastic\nscattering $(5<Q^{2}<100~{\\rm GeV}^{2})$ are presented which are based on HERA\ndata recorded at a centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s} = 319{\\rm~GeV}$ with an\nintegrated luminosity of $287$ pb$^{-1}$ collected by the H1 detector. The\nreaction $ep \\rightarrow eXY$ is studied, where the system $X$, containing at\nleast one $D^{*}(2010)$ meson, is separated from a leading low-mass proton\ndissociative system $Y$ by a large rapidity gap. The kinematics of $D^{*}$\ncandidates are reconstructed in the $D^{*}\\rightarrow K \\pi\\pi$ decay channel.\nThe measured cross sections compare favourably with next-to-leading order QCD\npredictions, where charm quarks are produced via boson-gluon fusion and they\nare independently fragmented to the $D^{*}$ mesons. The calculations rely on\nthe collinear factorisation theorem and are based on diffractive parton\ndensities previously obtained by H1 from fits to inclusive diffractive cross\nsections. The data are further used to determine the diffractive to inclusive\n$D^{*}$ production ratio in deep inelastic scattering.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an active gel droplet with imposed orientational\nanchoring (normal or planar) at its surface. We find that if the activity is\nlarge enough droplets subject to strong anchoring spontaneously start to\nrotate, with the sense of rotation randomly selected by fluctuations.\nContractile droplets rotate only for planar anchoring and extensile ones only\nfor normal anchoring. This is because such a combination leads to a pair of\nstable elastic deformations which creates an active torque to power the\nrotation. Interestingly, under these conditions there is a conflict between the\nanchoring promoted thermodynamically and that favoured by activity. By tuning\nactivity and anchoring strength, we find a wealth of qualitatively different\ndroplet morphologies and spatiotemporal patterns, encompassing steady\nrotations, oscillations, and more irregular trajectories. The spontaneous\nrotations we observe are fundamentally different from previously reported\ninstances of rotating defects in active fluids as they require the presence of\nstrong enough anchoring and entail significant droplet shape deformations.\n", "  In the past years the observational evidence that s-process elements from Sr\nto Pb are produced by stars ascending the socalled Asymptotic Giant Branch (or\nAGB) could not be explained by self-consistent models, forcing researchers to\nextensive parameterizations. The crucial point is to understand how protons can\nbe injected from the envelope into the He-rich layers, yielding the formation\nof 13C and then the activation of the 13C(a,n)16O reaction. Only recently,\nattempts to solve this problem started to consider quantitatively\nphysically-based mixing mechanisms. Among them, MHD processes in the plasma\nwere suggested to yield mass transport through magnetic buoyancy. In this\nframework, we compare results of nucleosynthesis models for Low Mass AGB Stars\n(M<=3Mo), developed from the MHD scenario, with the record of isotopic\nabundance ratios of s-elements in presolar SiC grains, which were shown to\noffer precise constraints on the 13C reservoir. We find that n-captures driven\nby magnetically-induced mixing can indeed account for the SiC data quite well\nand that this is due to the fact that our 13C distribution fulfils the above\nconstraints rather accurately. We suggest that similar tests should be now\nperformed using different physical models for mixing. Such comparisons would\nindeed improve decisively our understanding of the formation of the neutron\nsource.\n", "  Rate processes are often modeled using Markov-State Models (MSM). Suppose you\nknow a prior MSM, and then learn that your prediction of some particular\nobservable rate is wrong. What is the best way to correct the whole MSM? For\nexample, molecular dynamics simulations of protein folding may sample many\nmicrostates, possibly giving correct pathways through them, while also giving\nthe wrong overall folding rate, when compared to experiment. Here, we describe\nCaliber Corrected Markov Modeling (C2M2): an approach based on the principle of\nmaximum entropy for updating a Markov model by imposing state- and trajectory-\nbased constraints. We show that such corrections are equivalent to asserting\nposition-dependent diffusion coefficients in continuous-time continuous-space\nMarkov processes modeled by a Smoluchowski equation. We derive the functional\nform of the diffusion coefficient explicitly in terms of the trajectory-based\nconstraints. We illustrate with examples of 2D particle diffusion and an\noverdamped harmonic oscillator.\n", "  Granular materials jam when developing a network of contact forces able to\nresist the applied stresses. Through numerical simulations of the dynamics of\nthe jamming process, we show that the jamming transition does not occur when\nthe kinetic energy vanishes. Rather, as the system jams, the kinetic energy\nbecomes dominated by rattlers particles, that scatter withing their cages. The\nrelaxation of the kinetic energy in the jammed configuration exhibits a double\npower-law decay, which we interpret in terms of the interplay between backbone\nand rattlers particles.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the main dehydrogenation processes of two\ndibenzopyrene cation (C24H14+) isomers, namely dibenzo(a,e)pyrene (AE+) and\ndibenzo(a,l)pyrene (AL+). First, action spectroscopy under VUV photons was\nperformed using synchrotron radiation in the 8-20 eV range. We observed lower\ndissociation thresholds for the non-planar molecule (AL+) than for the planar\none (AE+) for the main dissociation pathways: H and 2H/H2 loss. In order to\nrationalize the experimental results, dissociation paths were investigated by\nmeans of density functional theory calculations. In the case of H loss, which\nis the dominant channel at the lowest energies, the observed difference between\nthe two isomers can be explained by the presence in AL+ of two C-H bonds with\nconsiderably lower adiabatic dissociation energies. In both isomers the 2H/H2\nloss channels are observed only at about 1 eV higher than H loss. We suggest\nthat this is due to the propensity of bay H atoms to easily form H2. In\naddition, in the case of AL+, we cannot exclude a competition between 2H and H2\nchannels. In particular, the formation of a stable dissociation product with a\nfive-membered ring could account for the low energy sequential loss of 2\nhydrogens. This work shows the potential role of non-compact PAHs containing\nbay regions in the production of H2 in space.\n", "  In this work, Fe100-xNix nanoparticle systems in the invar region (x = 29,\n32, and 37) were prepared by the method of chemical co-precipitation. X-Ray\nDiffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed the coexistence of both bcc and fcc phases\nfor x = 29 and 32. However, only fcc phase was observed for x = 37. Scanning\nElectron Microscope (SEM) images indicated that the particle size is ~ 120-500\nnm, and is almost independent of x. M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy (MS) on the\nprepared nanoparticles indicated the development of a paramagnetic phase\ncharacteristic of the low-spin (antitaenite) fcc phase, in addition to the\nmagnetic components characteristic of the bcc phase and the high-spin fcc\nphases. Since it is not possible to resolve the low- spin fcc phase from the\nhigh-spin fcc phase in XRD patterns, MS proves to be an effective tool for\nstudying the prepared nanoparticle systems.\n", "  The magnetic properties of the alloy system Fe3-xMnxSi have been studied by\nmeasuring magnetization for samples with x = 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and by thermal\nscanning techniques for samples with x = 0, 0.1. The results reveal that the\nsystem is ferromagnetic in this composition range. Zero field cooling and field\ncooling magnetization measurements indicate a similar magnetic ordering and\nmagnetic anisotropy in all samples. The saturation magnetization for the\nannealed samples was higher than that for as prepared samples. This is\nattributed to the reduction of magnetic domain boundaries rather than to\nimproving magnetic order as a result of annealing. Further, TC values\ndetermined from thermal DSC measurements are in good agreement with previously\nreported results based on magnetic measurements.\n", "  In this article, the thermomagnetic properties of a system of Ga-substituted\nbarium hexaferrite nanoparticles ( ) prepared by ball milling were\ninvestigated. The thermomagnetic curves for the samples with x ranging from 0.0\nto 1.0 exhibited sharp peaks with high magnetization just below TC (Hopkinson\npeaks). The height of the peak for our samples was similar or larger than\npreviously observed or calculated values. Theoretical treatment of the\nexperimental data demonstrated that the peaks are due to the effect of\nsuperparamagnetic relaxations of the magnetic particle. This effect was\nconfirmed by hysteresis measurements at, and just below the temperature at\nwhich the peak occurred. Consequently, the particle diameters were calculated\nfrom the experimental data using a theoretical model based on the\nsuperparamagnetic behavior of a system of uniaxial, randomly oriented, single\ndomain, non-interacting particles. The calculated diameters of 11 - 26 nm are\nless than the physical diameters determined from TEM measurements. The factors\nresponsible for the low calculated values are discussed.\n", "  By extrapolating the number of detections made during the first LIGO science\nrun, tenths of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers are\nanticipated in upcoming LIGO Virgo science runs. Finding an electromagnetic\ncounterpart from compact binary merger events would be a capital achievement.\nWe evaluate the ability of current wide-field X- and gamma-ray telescopes\naboard INTEGRAL to find such counterparts thanks to an end-to-end simulation\nfor estimating the fraction of the sources that can be followed up and/or\ndetected.\n", "  Galaxy clusters can potentially induce sub-$\\mu$K polarization signals in the\nCMB with characteristic scales of a few arcminutes in nearby clusters. We\nexplore four such polarization signals induced in a rich nearby cluster and\ncalculate the likelihood for their detection by the currently operational\nSPTpol, advanced ACTpol, and the upcoming Simons Array. In our feasibility\nanalysis we include instrumental noise, primordial CMB anisotropy, statistical\nthermal SZ cluster signal, and point source confusion, assuming a few percent\nof the nominal telescope observation time of each of the three projects. Our\nanalysis indicates that the thermal SZ intensity can be easily mapped in rich\nnearby clusters, and that the kinematic SZ intensity can be measured with high\nstatistical significance toward a fast moving nearby cluster. The detection of\npolarized SZ signals will be quite challenging, but could still be feasible\ntowards several very rich nearby clusters with exceptionally high SZ intensity.\nThe polarized SZ signal from a sample of $\\sim 20$ clusters can be\nstatistically detected at $S/N \\sim 3$, if observed for several months.\n"]}
