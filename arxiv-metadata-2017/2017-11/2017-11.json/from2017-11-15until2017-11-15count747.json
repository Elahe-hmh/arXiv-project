While the total spin-density is found to possess the topology of the\nnon-magnetic prototypical structures, in some cases the spin-polarized\ndensities are characterized by unique topologies; for example, the\nspin-polarized charge densities of bcc and high-spin fcc iron are atypical of\nany known for non-magnetic materials. In these cases, the two spin-densities\nare correlated: the spin-minority electrons have directional bond paths with\ndeep minima in the minority density, while the spin-majority electrons fill\nthese holes, reducing bond directionality. The presence of two distinct spin\ntopologies suggests that a well-known magnetic phase transition in iron can be\nfruitfully reexamined in light of these topological changes. We show that the\ntwo phase changes seen in fcc iron (paramagnetic to low-spin and low-spin to\nhigh-spin) are different. The former follows the Landau symmetry-breaking\nparadigm and proceeds without a topological transformation, while the latter\nalso involves a topological catastrophe.\n", "  Scattering theory for p-forms on manifolds with cylindrical ends has a direct\ninterpretation in terms of cohomology. Using the Hodge isomorphism,the\nscattering matrix at low energy may be regarded as operator on the cohomology\nof the boundary. Its value at zero describes the image of the absolute\ncohomology in the cohomology of the boundary. We show that the so-called\nscattering length, the Eisenbud-Wigner time delay at zero energy, has a\ncohomological interpretation as well. Namely, it relates the norm of a\ncohomology class on the boundary to the norm of its image under the connecting\nhomomorphism in the long exact sequence in cohomology. An interesting\nconsequence of this is that one can estimate the scattering lengths in terms of\ngeometric data like the volumes of certain homological systoles.\n", "  Galaxies accrete their mass by means of both smooth accretion from the cosmic\nweb, and the mergers of smaller entities. We wish to quantify the respective\nrole of these two modes of accretion, which could determine the morphological\ntypes of galaxies observed today. Multi-zoom cosmological simulations are used\nto estimate as a function of time the evolution of mass in bound systems, for\ndark matter as well as baryons. The baryonic contents of dark matter haloes are\nstudied. Merger histories are followed as a function of external density, and\nthe different ways in which mass is assembled in galaxies and the stellar\ncomponent accumulated are quantified. We find that most galaxies assemble their\nmass through smooth accretion, and only the most massive galaxies also grow\nsignificantly through mergers. The mean fraction of mass assembled by accretion\nis 77 %, and by mergers 23 %. We present typical accretion histories of\nhundreds of galaxies: masses of the most massive galaxies increase\nmonotonically in time, mainly through accretion, many intermediate-mass objects\nalso experience mass-loss events such as tidal stripping and evaporation.\nHowever, our simulations suffer from the overcooling of massive galaxies caused\nby the neglect of active galaxy nuclei (AGN) feedback. The time by which half\nof the galay mass has assembled, both in dark matter and baryons, is a\ndecreasing function of mass, which is compatible with the observations of a\nso-called downsizing. At every epoch in the universe, there are low-mass\ngalaxies actively forming stars, while more massive galaxies form their stars\nover a shorter period of time within half the age of the universe.\n", "  We perform a fully relativistic analysis of odd-type linear perturbations\naround a static and spherically symmetric solution in the most general\nscalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations in four-dimensional\nspacetime. It is shown that, as in the case of general relativity, the\nquadratic action for the perturbations reduces to the one having only a single\ndynamical variable, from which concise formulas for no-ghost and no-gradient\ninstability conditions are derived. Our result is applicable to all the\ntheories of gravity with an extra scalar degree of freedom. We demonstrate how\nthe generic formulas can be applied to some particular examples such as the\nBrans-Dicke theory, $f(R)$ models, and Galileon gravity.\n", "  Using a Monte Carlo method on a lattice model of a vicinal surface with\nshort-range step-step attraction, we show that, at low temperature and near\nequilibrium, there is an inhibition of the motion of macro-steps. This\ninhibition leads to a pinning of steps without defects, adsorbates, or\nimpurities (self-pinning of steps). We show that this inhibition of the\nmacro-step motion is caused by faceted steps, which are macro-steps that have a\nsmooth side surface. The faceted steps result from discontinuities in the\nanisotropic surface tension (the surface free energy per area). The\ndiscontinuities are brought into the surface tension by the short-range\nstep-step attraction. The short-range step-step attraction also originates\n`step-droplets', which are locally merged steps, at higher temperatures. We\nderive an analytic equation of the surface stiffness tensor for the vicinal\nsurface around the (001) surface. Using the surface stiffness tensor, we show\nthat step-droplets roughen the vicinal surface. Contrary to what we expected,\nthe step-droplets slow down the step velocity due to the diminishment of kinks\nin the merged steps (smoothing of the merged steps).\n", "  Galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe,\nare thought to grow by accreting mass from their surroundings through\nlarge-scale virial shocks. Due to electron acceleration in such a shock, it\nshould appear as a $\\gamma$-ray, hard X-ray, and radio ring, elongated towards\nthe large-scale filaments feeding the cluster, coincident with a cutoff in the\nthermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal. However, no such signature was found\nuntil now, and the very existence of cluster virial shocks has remained a\ntheory. We find preliminary evidence for a large, $\\sim 5$ Mpc minor axis\n$\\gamma$-ray ring around the Coma cluster, elongated towards the large scale\nfilament connecting Coma and Abell 1367, detected at the nominal $2.7\\sigma$\nconfidence level ($5.1\\sigma$ using control signal simulations). The\n$\\gamma$-ray ring correlates both with a synchrotron signal and with the SZ\ncutoff, but not with Galactic tracers. The $\\gamma$-ray and radio signatures\nagree with analytic and numerical predictions, if the shock deposits $\\sim 1\\%$\nof the thermal energy in relativistic electrons over a Hubble time, and $\\sim\n1\\%$ in magnetic fields. The implied inverse-Compton and synchrotron cumulative\nemission from similar shocks can significantly contribute to the diffuse\nextragalactic $\\gamma$-ray and low frequency radio backgrounds. Our results, if\nconfirmed, reveal the prolate structure of the hot gas in Coma, the feeding\npattern of the cluster, and properties of the surrounding large scale voids and\nfilaments. The anticipated detection of such shocks around other clusters would\nprovide a powerful new cosmological probe.\n", "  In this paper, we study linear cellular automata (CAs) on Cayley tree of\norder 2 over the field $\\mathbb F_p$ (the set of prime numbers modulo $p$). We\nconstruct the rule matrix corresponding to finite cellular automata on Cayley\ntree. Further, we analyze the reversibility problem of this cellular automaton\nfor some given values of $a,b,c,d\\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}\\setminus \\{0\\}$ and the\nlevels $n$ of Cayley tree. We compute the measure-theoretical entropy of the\ncellular automata which we define on Cayley tree. We show that for CAs on\nCayley tree the measure entropy with respect to uniform Bernoulli measure is\ninfinity.\n", "  The coupled cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (CNLS) equations are used to study\nmodulational instabilities of a pair of nonlinearly interacting two-dimensional\nwaves in deep water. It has been shown that the full dynamics of these\ninteracting waves gives rise to localized large-amplitude wavepackets (wave\nfocusing). In this short letter we attempt to verify this result numerically\nusing a Fourier spectral method for the CNLS equations.\n", "  Flat lens concept based on negative refraction proposed by Veselago in 1968\nhas been mostly investigated in monochromatic regime. It was recently\nrecognized that time development of the super-lensing effect discovered in 2000\nby Pendry is yet to be assessed and may spring surprises: Time-dependent\nillumination could improve the spatial resolution of the focusing. We\ninvestigate dynamics of flexural wave focusing by a 45\\degre-tilted square\nlattice of circular holes drilled in a Duraluminium plate. Time-resolved\nexperiments reveal that the focused image shrinks with time below diffraction\nlimit, with a lateral resolution increasing from 0.8 $\\lambda$ to 0.35\n$\\lambda$, whereas focusing under harmonic excitation remains diffraction\nlimited. Modal analysis reveals the role in pulse reconstruction of radiating\nlens resonances, which repeatedly self-synchronize at the focal spot to shape a\nsuper-oscillating field.\n", "  Microstates of colinear black holes embedded in a multi-center Taub-NUT\nspacetime are sought in 4 dimensions. A set of coupled ordinary partial\ndifferential equations are obtained and solved for almost-BPS states, where\nsome supersymmetry is preserved in the context of N=2 supergravity in 4\ndimensions. The regularity of solutions is being carefully considered and we\nensure that no CTC (closed time-like curves) are present. The larger framework\nis that of 11-dimensional N=2 supergravity and the current theory is obtained\nby compactifying down to 4 dimensions.\n", "  In the thermoelastic regime, photoacoustic sensing of optical absorption\nrelies on conversion from light to acoustic energy via the coefficient of\nthermal expansion \\beta. In this work, we confront confront experimental\nmeasurements to theoretical predictions of nonlinear photoacoustic generation\nbased on the dynamic variation of \\beta(T) during the optical excitation of\nabsorbers in aqueous solution. The photoacoustic generation from solutions of\norganic dye and gold nanospheres (with same optical densities), illuminated\nwith 532 nm nanosecond pulses, was detected using a high frequency ultrasound\ntransducer (center frequency 20 MHz). Photoacoustic emission was observed with\ngold nanospheres at low fluence (a few mJ/cm2) for an equilibrium temperature\naround 4{\\deg}C, where the linear photoacoustic effect in water vanishes,\nhighlighting the nonlinear emission from the solution of nanospheres. Under the\nsame condition, no emission was observed with the absorbing organic dye. At a\nfixed fluence of 5 mJ/cm2, the photoacoustic amplitude was studied as a\nfunction of the equilibrium temperature from 2{\\deg}C to 20{\\deg}C. While the\nphotoacoustic amplitude from the organic dye followed \\beta(T) in water and\nvanished around 4{\\deg}C, the photoacoustic amplitude from the gold nanospheres\nremained significant over the whole temperature range. These experimental\nresults are shown to be in qualitative agreement with theoretical calculations\nbased on the nanoscale and nanosecond transient changes of the coefficient of\nthermal expansion of water around the gold nanospheres. Our results suggest\nthat in the context of high frequency photoacoustic imaging, nanoparticles may\nbe discriminated from molecular absorbers based on either the nonlinear\nfluence-dependence or the equilibrium temperature-dependence of the\nphotoacoustic amplitude.\n", "  We examine how generalised geometries can be associated with a labelled\nDynkin diagram built around a gravity line. We present a series of new\ngeneralised geometries based on the groups\n$\\mathit{Spin}(d,d)\\times\\mathbb{R}^+$ for which the generalised tangent space\ntransforms in a spinor representation of the group. In low dimensions these all\nappear in subsectors of maximal supergravity theories. The case $d=8$ provides\na geometry for eight-dimensional backgrounds of M theory with only seven-form\nflux, which have not been included in any previous geometric construction. This\ngeometry is also one of a series of \"half-exceptional\" geometries, which\n\"geometrise\" a six-form gauge field. In the appendix, we consider examples of\nother algebras appearing in gravitational theories and give a method to derive\nthe Dynkin labels for the \"section condition\" in general. We argue that\ngeneralised geometry can describe restrictions and subsectors of many\ngravitational theories.\n", "  The equations of a relative equilibrium in a pure Yang--Mills gauge theory\nwith the Coulomb gauge fixing are obtained. They are derived as a direct\nconsequence of the results of our previous work on Wong's equations in gauge\ntheory.The obtained equations are similar to the equations of a relative\nequilibrium in reducible finite-dimensional dynamical systems with a symmetry.\nIn all these equations, the description of the reduced motion is performed by\nmaking use of the dependent coordinates.\n", "  Cosmology is entering an era of percent level precision due to current large\nobservational surveys. This precision in observation is now demanding more\naccuracy from numerical methods and cosmological simulations. In this paper, we\nstudy the accuracy of $N$-body numerical simulations and their dependence on\nchanges in the initial conditions and in the simulation algorithms. For this\npurpose, we use a series of cosmological $N$-body simulations with varying\ninitial conditions. We test the influence of the initial conditions, namely the\npre-initial configuration (preIC), the order of the Lagrangian perturbation\ntheory (LPT), and the initial redshift, on the statistics associated with the\nlarge scale structures of the universe such as the halo mass function, the\ndensity power spectrum, and the maximal extent of the large scale structures.\nWe find that glass or grid pre-initial conditions give similar results at\n$z\\lesssim 2$. However, the initial excess of power in the glass initial\nconditions yields a subtle difference in the power spectra and the mass\nfunction at high redshifts. The LPT order used to generate the ICs of the\nsimulations is found to play a crucial role. First-order LPT (1LPT) simulations\nunderestimate the number of massive haloes with respect to second-order (2LPT)\nones, typically by 2% at $10^{14} h^{-1} M_\\odot$ for an initial redshift of\n23, and the small-scale power with an underestimation of 6% near the Nyquist\nfrequency for $z_\\mathrm{ini} = 23$. Moreover, at higher redshifts, the\nhigh-mass end of the mass function is significantly underestimated in 1LPT\nsimulations. On the other hand, when the LPT order is fixed, the starting\nredshift has a systematic impact on the low-mass end of the halo mass function.\n", "  We implement the photoacoustic transmission-matrix approach on a\ntwo-dimensional photoacoustic imaging system, using a 15 MHz linear ultrasound\narray. Using a black leaf skeleton as a complex absorbing structure, we\ndemonstrate that the photoacoustic transmission-matrix approach allows to\nreveal structural features that are invisible in conventional photoacoustic\nimages, as well as to selectively control light focusing on absorbing targets,\nleading to a local enhancement of the photoacoustic signal.\n", "  We study the pattern of oscillations in the primordial power spectrum in\naxion monodromy inflation, accounting for drifts in the oscillation period that\ncan be important for comparing to cosmological data. In these models the\npotential energy has a monomial form over a super-Planckian field range, with\nsuperimposed modulations whose size is model-dependent. The amplitude and\nfrequency of the modulations are set by the expectation values of moduli\nfields. We show that during the course of inflation, the diminishing energy\ndensity can induce slow adjustments of the moduli, changing the modulations. We\nprovide templates capturing the effects of drifting moduli, as well as drifts\narising in effective field theory models based on softly broken discrete shift\nsymmetries, and we estimate the precision required to detect a drifting period.\nA non-drifting template suffices over a wide range of parameters, but for the\nhighest frequencies of interest, or for sufficiently strong drift, it is\nnecessary to include parameters characterizing the change in frequency over the\ne-folds visible in the CMB. We use these templates to perform a preliminary\nsearch for drifting oscillations in a part of the parameter space in the Planck\nnominal mission data.\n", "  Combining our knowledge of halo structure and internal kinematics from\ncosmological dark matter simulations and the distribution of halo interlopers\nin projected phase space measured in cosmological galaxy simulations, we\ndevelop MAGGIE, a prior- and halo-based, probabilistic, abundance matching (AM)\ngrouping algorithm for doubly complete subsamples (in distance and luminosity)\nof flux-limited samples. We test MAGGIE-L and MAGGIE-M (in which group masses\nare derived from AM applied to the group luminosities and stellar masses,\nrespectively) on groups of at least three galaxies extracted from a mock Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Legacy redshift survey, incorporating realistic\nobservational errors on galaxy luminosities and stellar masses. In comparison\nwith the optimal Friends-of-Friends (FoF) group finder, groups extracted with\nMAGGIE are much less likely to be secondary fragments of true groups; in\nprimary fragments, its galaxy memberships (relative to the virial sphere of the\nreal-space group) are much more complete and usually more reliable, and its\nmasses are much less biased and usually with less scatter, as are its group\nluminosities and stellar masses (computed in MAGGIE using the membership\nprobabilities as weights). FoF outperforms MAGGIE only for high-mass clusters:\nfor the reliability of the galaxy population and the dispersion of its total\nmass. In comparison with our implementation of the Yang et al. group finder,\nMAGGIE reaches much higher completeness and slightly lower group fragmentation\nand dispersion on group total masses, luminosities and stellar masses, but\nslightly greater bias in the latter two and lower reliabilities. MAGGIE should\ntherefore lead to sharper trends of environmental effects on galaxies and more\naccurate mass/orbit modelling.\n", "  We consider the non-unitary Lee-Yang minimal model ${\\cal M}(2,5)$ in three\ndifferent finite geometries: (i) on the interval with integrable boundary\nconditions labelled by the Kac labels $(r,s)=(1,1),(1,2)$, (ii) on the circle\nwith periodic boundary conditions and (iii) on the periodic circle including an\nintegrable purely transmitting defect. We apply $\\varphi_{1,3}$ integrable\nperturbations on the boundary and on the defect and describe the flow of the\nspectrum. Adding a $\\Phi_{1,3}$ integrable perturbation to move off-criticality\nin the bulk, we determine the finite size spectrum of the massive scattering\ntheory in the three geometries via Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations.\nWe derive these integral equations for all excitations by solving, in the\ncontinuum scaling limit, the TBA functional equations satisfied by the transfer\nmatrices of the associated $A_{4}$ RSOS lattice model of Forrester and Baxter\nin Regime III. The excitations are classified in terms of $(m,n)$ systems. The\nexcited state TBA equations agree with the previously conjectured equations in\nthe boundary and periodic cases. In the defect case, new TBA equations confirm\npreviously conjectured transmission factors.\n", "  Starting from a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we develop a new\nframework for constructing observables and their evolution in theories\ninvariant under global time reparametrizations. Our proposal relaxes the usual\nDirac prescription for the observables of a totally constrained system\n(`perennials') and allows one to recover the influential partial and complete\nobservables approach in a particular limit. Difficulties such as the\nnon-unitary evolution of the complete observables in terms of certain partial\nobservables are explained as a breakdown of this limit. Identification of our\nobservables (`mutables') relies upon a physical distinction between gauge\nsymmetries that exist at the level of histories and states (`Type 1'), and\nthose that exist at the level of histories and not states (`Type 2'). This\ndistinction resolves a tension in the literature concerning the physical\ninterpretation of the partial observables and allows for a richer class of\nobservables in the quantum theory. There is the potential for the application\nof our proposal to the quantization of gravity when understood in terms of the\nShape Dynamics formalism.\n", "  We demonstrate the ability to guide high-frequency photoacoustic waves\nthrough thick tissue with a water-filled silica-capillary (150 \\mu m inner\ndiameter and 30 mm long). An optical-resolution photoacoustic image of a 30 \\mu\nm diameter absorbing nylon thread was obtained by guiding the acoustic waves in\nthe capillary through a 3 cm thick fat layer. The transmission loss through the\ncapillary was about -20 dB, much lower than the -120 dB acoustic attenuation\nthrough the fat layer. The overwhelming acoustic attenuation of high-frequency\nacoustic waves by biological tissue can therefore be avoided by the use of a\nsmall footprint capillary acoustic waveguide for remote detection. We finally\ndemonstrate that the capillary can be used as a dual optical-in acoustic-out\nwaveguide, paving the way for the development of minimally invasive\noptical-resolution photoacoustic endoscopes free of any acoustic or optical\nelements at their imaging tip.\n", "  A common assumption in analyses of error thresholds and quantum computing in\ngeneral is that one applies fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC)\nafter every gate. This, however, is known not to always be optimal if the FTQEC\nprocedure itself can introduce errors. We investigate the effect of varying the\nnumber of logical gates between FTQEC operations, and in particular the case\nwhere failure of a postselection condition in FTQEC may cause FTQEC to be\nskipped with high probability.\n  By using a simplified model of errors induced in FTQEC, we derive an\nexpression for the logical error rate as a function of error-correction\nfrequency, and show that in this model the optimal frequency is relatively\ninsensitive to postselection failure probability for a large range of such\nprobabilities. We compare the model to data derived from Monte Carlo simulation\nfor the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code.\n", "  Interactions such as mergers and flybys play a fundamental role in shaping\ngalaxy morphology. Using the Horizon Run 4 cosmological N-body simulation, we\nstudied the frequency and type of halo interactions, and their redshift\nevolution as a function of the environment defined by the large-scale density,\npair separation, mass ratio, and target halo mass. Most interactions happen at\nlarge-scale density contrast $\\delta \\approx 20$, regardless of the redshift,\ncorresponding to groups and relatively dense part of filaments. However, the\nfraction of interacting target is maximum at $\\delta \\approx 1000$. We provide\na new empirical fitting form for the interaction rate as a function of the halo\nmass, large-scale density, and redshift. We also report the existence of two\nmodes of interactions from the distributions of mass ratio and relative\ndistance, implying two different physical origins of the interaction. Satellite\ntargets lose their mass as they proceed deeper into the host halo. The relative\nimportance of these two trends strongly depends on the large-scale density,\ntarget mass, and redshift.\n", "  The spectral property of the supersymmetric (SUSY) antiferromagnetic\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with an even number of spins is studied. The\nsupercharges of the model are explicitly constructed. By using the exact form\nof the supersymmetric ground state we introduce simple trial variational states\nfor first excited states. It is demonstrated numerically that they provide a\nrelatively accurate upper bound for the spectral gap (the energy difference\nbetween the ground state and first excited states) in all parameter ranges.\nHowever, being an upper bound, it does not allow us to determine vigorously\nwhether the model is gapped or gapless. Here, we provide a non-trivial lower\nbound for the spectral gap and thereby show that the antiferromagnetic SUSY LMG\nmodel is gapped for any even number of spins.\n", "  Determining accurate absolute surface energies for polar surfaces of\nsemiconductors has been a great challenge in decades. Here, we propose\npseudo-hydrogen passivation to calculate them, using density functional theory\napproaches. By calculating the energy contribution from pseudo-hydrogen using\neither a pseudo molecule method or a tetrahedral cluster method, we obtained\n(111) surfaces energies of Si, GaP, and ZnS with high self-consistency. This\nmethod quantitatively confirms that surface energy is determined by the number\nand the energy of dangling bonds of surface atoms. Our findings may greatly\nenhance the basic understandings of different surfaces and lead to novel\nstrategies in the crystal growth.\n", "  Interference of standing waves in electromagnetic resonators forms the basis\nof many technologies, from telecommunications and spectroscopy to detection of\ngravitational waves. However, unlike the confinement of light waves in vacuum,\nthe interference of electronic waves in solids is complicated by boundary\nproperties of the crystal, notably leading to electron guiding by atomic-scale\npotentials at the edges. Understanding the microscopic role of boundaries on\ncoherent wave interference is an unresolved question due to the challenge of\ndetecting charge flow with submicron resolution. Here we employ Fraunhofer\ninterferometry to achieve real-space imaging of cavity modes in a graphene\nFabry-Perot resonator, embedded between two superconductors to form a Josephson\njunction. By directly visualizing current flow using Fourier methods, our\nmeasurements reveal surprising redistribution of current on and off resonance.\nThese findings provide direct evidence of separate interference conditions for\nedge and bulk currents and reveal the ballistic nature of guided edge states.\nBeyond equilibrium, our measurements show strong modulation of the multiple\nAndreev reflection amplitude on an off resonance, a direct measure of the\ngate-tunable change of cavity transparency. These results demonstrate that,\ncontrary to the common belief, electron interactions with realistic disordered\nedges facilitate electron wave interference and ballistic transport.\n", "  Finite pieces of locally isostatic networks have a large number of floppy\nmodes because of missing constraints at the surface. Here we show that by\nimposing suitable boundary conditions at the surface, the network can be\nrendered effectively isostatic. We refer to these as anchored boundary\nconditions. An important example is formed by a two-dimensional network of\ncorner sharing triangles, which is the focus of this paper. Another way of\nrendering such networks isostatic, is by adding an external wire along which\nall unpinned vertices can slide (sliding boundary conditions). This approach\nalso allows for the incorporation of boundaries associated with internal holes\nand complex sample geometries, which are illustrated with examples. The recent\nsynthesis of bilayers of vitreous silica has provided impetus for this work.\nExperimental results from the imaging of finite pieces at the atomic level\nneeds such boundary conditions, if the observed structure is to be\ncomputer-refined so that the interior atoms have the perception of being in an\ninfinite isostatic environment.\n", "  The Horizon Run 4 is a cosmological $N$-body simulation designed for the\nstudy of coupled evolution between galaxies and large-scale structures of the\nUniverse, and for the test of galaxy formation models. Using $6300^3$\ngravitating particles in a cubic box of $L_{\\rm box} = 3150 ~h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$,\nwe build a dense forest of halo merger trees to trace the halo merger history\nwith a halo mass resolution scale down to $M_s = 2.7 \\times 10^{11} h^{-1}{\\rm\nM_\\odot}$. We build a set of particle and halo data, which can serve as\ntestbeds for comparison of cosmological models and gravitational theories with\nobservations. We find that the FoF halo mass function shows a substantial\ndeviation from the universal form with tangible redshift evolution of amplitude\nand shape. At higher redshifts, the amplitude of the mass function is lower,\nand the functional form is shifted toward larger values of $\\ln (1/\\sigma)$. We\nalso find that the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature in the two-point\ncorrelation function of mock galaxies becomes broader with a peak position\nmoving to smaller scales and the peak amplitude decreasing for increasing\ndirectional cosine $\\mu$ compared to the linear predictions. From the halo\nmerger trees built from halo data at 75 redshifts, we measure the half-mass\nepoch of halos and find that less massive halos tend to reach half of their\ncurrent mass at higher redshifts. Simulation outputs including snapshot data,\npast lightcone space data, and halo merger data are available at\nhttp://sdss.kias.re.kr/astro/Horizon-Run4/.\n", "  We analyze the stress-energy tensor for the self-coupled Maxwell-Dirac system\nin the bilinear current formalism, using two independent approaches. The first\nmethod used is that attributed to Belinfante: starting from the spinor form of\nthe action, the well-known canonical stress-energy tensor is augmented, by\nextending the Noether symmetry current to include contributions from the\nLorentz group, to a manifestly symmetric form. This form admits a transcription\nto bilinear current form. The second method used is the variational derivation\nbased on the covariant coupling to general relativity. The starting point here\nat the outset is the transcription of the action using, as independent field\nvariables, both the bilinear currents, together with a gauge invariant vector\nfield (a proxy for the electromagnetic vector potential). A central feature of\nthe two constructions is that they both involve the mapping of the Dirac\ncontribution to the stress-energy from the spinor fields to the equivalent set\nof bilinear tensor currents, through the use of appropriate Fierz identities.\nAlthough this mapping is done at quite different stages, nonetheless we find\nthat the two forms of the bilinear stress-energy tensor agree. Finally, as an\napplication, we consider the reduction of the obtained stress-energy tensor in\nbilinear form, under the assumption of spherical symmetry.\n", "  This paper describes a fully covariant approach to harmonic superspace. It is\nbased on the conformal superspace description of conformal supergravity and\ninvolves extending the supermanifold M^{4|8} by the tangent bundle of CP^1. The\nresulting superspace M^{4|8} x TCP^1 can be identified in a certain gauge with\nthe conventional harmonic superspace M^{4|8} x S^2. This approach not only\nmakes the connection to projective superspace transparent, but simplifies\ncalculations in harmonic superspace significantly by eliminating the need to\ndeal directly with supergravity prepotentials. As an application of the\ncovariant approach, we derive from harmonic superspace the full component\naction for the sigma model of a hyperkahler cone coupled to conformal\nsupergravity. Further applications are also sketched.\n", "  Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a promising photovoltaic absorber material with earth\nabundant and nontoxic elements. However, the detrimental native defects and\nsecondary phases of CSTS will largely reduce the energy conversion\nefficiencies. To understand the origin of these problems during the growth of\nCZTS, we investigated the kinetic processes on CZTS (-1-1-2) surface, using\nfirst principles calculations. A surface Zn atom was found to occupy the\nsubsurface Cu site easily due to a low reaction barrier, which may lead to a\nhigh ZnCu concentration and a secondary phase of ZnS. These n-type defects may\ncreate deep electron traps near the interface and become detrimental to device\nperformance. To reduce the population of ZnCu and the secondary phase, we\npropose to use K as a surfactant to alter surface kinetic processes.\nImprovements on crystal quality and device performance based on this surfactant\nare consistent with early experimental observations.\n", "  We revisit the early work of Minkowski and Sommerfeld concerning hyperbolic\nmotion, and we describe some geometrical aspects of the electrodynamic\ninteraction. We discuss the advantages of a time symmetric formulation in which\nthe material points are replaced by infinitesimal length elements.\n", "  We show that for any von Neumann measurement, we can construct a logically\nreversible measurement such that Shannon entropies and quantum discords induced\nby the two measurements have compact connections. In particular, we prove that\nquantum discord for the logically reversible measurement is never less than\nthat for the von Neumann measurement.\n", "  We discuss the combined effect of QED and QCD corrections to the evolution of\nparton distributions. We extend the available knowledge of the Altarelli-Parisi\nsplitting functions to one order higher in QED, and provide explicit\nexpressions for the splitting kernels up to ${\\cal O}(\\alpha \\,\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{S}})$. The results presented in this article allow to perform a\nparton distribution function analysis reaching full NLO QCD-QED combined\nprecision.\n", "  We investigate the degree of entanglement between an atom and a driven cavity\nmode, in the presence of dissipation. Previous work has shown that in the limit\nof weak driving fields, the steady state entanglement is proportional to the\nsquare of the driving intensity. This quadratic dependence is due to the\ngeneration of entanglement by the creation of pairs of photons/excitations. In\nthis work we investigate the entanglement between an atom and a cavity in the\npresence of multiple photons. Nonlinearity of the atomic response is needed to\ngenerate entanglement, but as that nonlinearity saturates the entanglement\nvanishes. We posit that this is due to spontaneous emission, which puts the\natom in the ground state and the atom-field state into a direct product state.\nAn intermediate value of the driving field, near the field that saturates the\natomic response, optimizes the atom-field entanglement. In a parameter regime\nfor which multiphoton resonances occur, we find that entanglement recurs at\nthose resonances. \\cite{Shamailov-10} In this regime, we find that the\nentanglement decreases with increaing photon number. We also investigate, in\nthe bimodal regime of Alsing et. al.\\cite{Alsing-91-DressedState}\n\\cite{Alsing-92-DSS}\\cite{Carm-15-X}, the entanglement as a function of atom\nand/or cavity detuning. Here we find that there is evidence of a phase\ntransition in the entanglement, which occurs at $2\\epsilon/g \\geq 1$.\n", "  Plasmonic metamaterials support the localized surface plasmon resonance\n(LSPR), which is sensitive to the change in the dielectric environment and\nhighly desirable for ultrasensitive biochemical sensing. In this work, a novel\ndesign of supercell metamaterials of four mutually rotating split ring\nresonators (SRRs) is proposed, where simultaneous excitations of odd (N=1 and N\n= 3) and even (N=2) resonance modes are realized due to additional asymmetry\nfrom the rotation and show insensitivity to two orthogonal polarizations. The\nfull utilization of these three resonance dips show bright prospects for\nmultispectral application. As a refractive index (RI) sensor, ultrahigh\nsensitivities ~1000nm/RIU for LC mode (N=1) and ~500nm/RIU for plasmon mode\n(N=2) are obtained in near infrared (NIR) spectrum.\n", "  The canonical formalism of general relativity affords a particularly\ninteresting characterisation of the infamous hole argument. It also provides a\nnatural formalism in which to relate the hole argument to the problem of time\nin classical and quantum gravity. In this paper, we examine the connection\nbetween these two much discussed problems in the foundations of spacetime\ntheory along two interrelated lines. First, from a formal perspective, we\nconsider the extent to which the two problems can and cannot be precisely and\ndistinctly characterised. Second, from a philosophical perspective, we consider\nthe implications of various responses to the problems, with a particular focus\nupon the viability of a `deflationary' attitude to the\nrelationalist/substantivalist debate regarding the ontology of spacetime.\nConceptual and formal inadequacies within the representative language of\ncanonical gravity will be shown to be at the heart of both the canonical hole\nargument and the problem of time. Interesting and fruitful work at the\ninterface of physics and philosophy relates to the challenge of resolving such\ninadequacies.\n", "  Hyperbolic lattices interpolate between finite-dimensional lattices and Bethe\nlattices and are interesting in their own right with ordinary percolation\nexhibiting not one, but two, phase transitions. We study four constraint\npercolation models---$k$-core percolation (for $k=1,2,3$) and force-balance\npercolation---on several tessellations of the hyperbolic plane. By comparing\nthese four different models, our numerical data suggests that all of the\n$k$-core models, even for $k=3$, exhibit behavior similar to ordinary\npercolation, while the force-balance percolation transition is discontinuous.\nWe also provide a proof, for some hyperbolic lattices, of the existence of a\ncritical probability that is less than unity for the force-balance model, so\nthat we can place our interpretation of the numerical data for this model on a\nmore rigorous footing. Finally, we discuss improved numerical methods for\ndetermining the two critical probabilities on the hyperbolic lattice for the\n$k$-core percolation models.\n", "  An adiabatic time evolution of a closed quantum system connects eigenspaces\nof initial and final Hermitian Hamiltonians for slowly driven systems, or,\nunitary Floquet operators for slowly modulated driven systems. We show that the\nconnection of eigenspaces depends on a topological property of the adiabatic\npaths for given initial and final points. An example in slowly modulated\nperiodically driven systems is shown. These analysis are based on the\ntopological analysis of the exotic quantum holonomy in adiabatic closed paths.\n", "  We present a newly, fully automated, data pipeline: Solvepol, designed to\nreduce and analyze polarimetric data. It has been optimized for imaging data\nfrom the Instituto de Astronomia, Geofisica e Ciencias Atmosfericas (IAG) of\nthe University of Sao Paulo (USP), calcite Savart prism plate-based IAGPOL\npolarimeter. Solvepol is also the basis of a reduction pipeline for the\nwide-field optical polarimeter that will execute SOUTH POL, a survey of the\npolarized Southern sky. Solvepol was written using the interactive data\nlanguage (IDL) and is based on the image reduction and analysis facility (IRAF)\ntask pccdpack, developed by our polarimetry group. We present and discuss\nreduced data from standard stars and other fields and compare these results\nwith those obtained in the IRAF environment. Our analysis shows that Solvepol,\nin addition to being a fully automated pipeline, produces results consistent\nwith those reduced by pccdpack and reported in the literature.\n", "  We propose a novel approach to probe new fundamental interactions using\nisotope shift spectroscopy in atomic clock transitions. As concrete toy example\nwe focus on the Higgs boson couplings to the building blocks of matter: the\nelectron and the up and down quarks. We show that the attractive Higgs force\nbetween nuclei and their bound electrons, that is poorly constrained, might\ninduce effects that are larger than the current experimental sensitivities.\nMore generically, we discuss how new interactions between the electron and the\nneutrons, mediated via light new degrees of freedom, may lead to measurable\nnon-linearities in a King plot comparison between isotope shifts of two\ndifferent transitions. Given state-of-the-art accuracy in frequency comparison,\nisotope shifts have the potential of being measured with sub-Hz accuracy, thus\npotentially enabling the improvement of current limits on new fundamental\ninteractions. Candidate atomic system for this measurement require two\ndifferent clock transitions and four zero nuclear spin isotopes. We identify\nseveral systems that satisfy this requirement and also briefly discuss existing\nmeasurements. We consider the size of the effect related to the Higgs force and\nthe requirements for it to produce an observable signal.\n", "  In this work we study a non-linear generalization based on affine\ntransformations of probabilistic and quantum automata proposed recently by\nD\\'iaz-Caro and Yakary{\\i}lmaz \\cite{DCY16A} referred as affine automata.\nFirst, we present efficient simulations of probabilistic and quantum automata\nby means of affine automata which allows us to characterize the class of\nexclusive stochastic languages. Then, we initiate a study on the succintness of\naffine automata. In particular, we show that an infinite family of unary\nregular languages can be recognized by 2-state affine automata but the state\nnumbers of quantum and probabilistic automata cannot be bounded. Finally, we\npresent the characterization of all (regular) unary languages recognized by\ntwo-state affine automata.\n", "  Feedback control of quantum mechanical systems is rapidly attracting\nattention not only due to fundamental questions about quantum measurements but\nalso because of its novel applications in many fields in physics. Quantum\ncontrol has been studied intensively in quantum optics but recently progress\nhas been made in the control of solid-state qubits as well. In quantum\ntransport only a few active and passive feedback experiments have been realized\non the level of single-electrons, though theoretical proposals exist. Here we\ndemonstrate the suppression of shot noise in a single-electron transistor,\nusing an exclusively electronic closed-loop feedback to monitor and adjust the\ncounting statistics. With increasing feedback response we observe a stronger\nsuppression and faster freezing of charge current fluctuations. Our technique\nis analog to the generation of squeezed light with in-loop photodetection as\nused in quantum optics. Sub-Poisson single-electron sources will pave the way\nfor high precision measurements in quantum transport similar to its optical or\nopto-mechanical equivalent.\n", "  Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional we derive an expression for the\noscillatory part of the grand potential of a two dimensional Dirac system in a\nmagnetic field. We perform the computation for the clean and the disordered\nsystem, and we study the effect of electron-electron interactions on the\noscillations. Unlike in the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG), a finite\ntemperature and impurity scattering also affects the oscillation frequency.\nFurthermore, we find that in graphene, compared to the 2DEG, additional\ninteraction induced damping effects occur: to two-loop order electron-electron\ninteractions do lead to an additional damping factor in the amplitude of the\nLifshitz-Kosevich-formula.\n", "  Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has been intensively studied and widely\nemployed for light trapping and absorption enhancement. In the mid-infrared and\nterahertz (THz) regime, graphene supports the tunable SPR via manipulating its\nFermi energy and enhances light-matter interaction at the selective wavelength.\nIn this work, periodic arrays of graphene rings are proposed to introduce\ntunable light trapping with good angle polarization tolerance and enhance the\nabsorption in the light-absorbing materials nearby to more than one order.\nMoreover, the design principle here could be set as a template to achieve\nmulti-band plasmonic absorption enhancement by introducing more graphene\nconcentric rings into each unit cell. This work not only opens up new ways of\nemploying graphene SPR, but also leads to practical applications in\nhigh-performance simultaneous multi-color photodetection with high efficiency\nand tunable spectral selectivity.\n", "  For short wavelengths, it is well known that the linearized Wigner-Moyal\nequation predicts wave damping due to wave-particle interaction, where the\nresonant velocity shifted from the phase velocity by a velocity $v_q = \\hbar\nk/2m$. Here $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $k$ is the wavenumber and\n$m$ is the electron mass. Going beyond linear theory, we find additional\nresonances with velocity shifts $n v_q$, $n = 2, 3, \\ldots$, giving rise to a\nnew wave-damping mechanism that we term \\emph{multi-plasmon damping}, as it can\nbe seen as the simultaneous absorption (or emission) of multiple plasmon\nquanta. Naturally this wave damping is not present in classical plasmas. For a\ntemperature well below the Fermi temperature, if the linear ($n = 1$) resonant\nvelocity is outside the Fermi sphere, the number of linearly resonant particles\nis exponentially small, while the multi-plasmon resonances can be located in\nthe bulk of the distribution. We derive sets of evolution equations for the\ncase of two-plasmon and three-plasmon resonances for Langmuir waves in the\nsimplest case of a fully degenerate plasma. By solving these equations\nnumerically for a range of wave-numbers we find the corresponding damping\nrates, and we compare them to results from linear theory to estimate the\napplicability. Finally, we discuss the effects due to a finite temperature.\n", "  The nuclear matrix elements for the momentum quadrupole operator are\nimportant for the interpretation of precision atomic physics experiments that\nsearch for violations of local Lorentz and CPT symmetry and for new\nspin-dependent forces. We use the configuration-interaction nuclear shell model\nand self-consistent mean field theory to calculate these matrix elements in\n$^{21}$Ne, $^{23}$Na, $^{131}$Xe, $^{173}$Yb and $^{201}$Hg. These are the\nfirst microscopic calculations of the nuclear matrix elements for the momentum\nquadrupole tensor that go beyond the single-particle estimate. We show that\nthey are strongly suppressed by the many-body correlations, in contrast to the\nwell known enhancement of the spatial quadrupole nuclear matrix elements.\n", "  We prove that estimating the ground state energy of a\ntranslationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian on a 1D spin chain is\nQMAEXP-complete, even for systems of low local dimension (roughly 40). This is\nan improvement over the best previously-known result by several orders of\nmagnitude, and it shows that spin-glass-like frustration can occur in\ntranslationally-invariant quantum systems with a local dimension comparable to\nthe smallest-known non-translationally-invariant systems with similar\nbehaviour.\n  While previous constructions of such systems rely on standard models of\nquantum computation, we construct a new model that is particularly well-suited\nfor encoding quantum computation into the ground state of a\ntranslationally-invariant system. This allows us to shift the proof burden from\noptimizing the Hamiltonian encoding a standard computational model to proving\nuniversality of a simple model.\n  Previous techniques for encoding quantum computation into the ground state of\na local Hamiltonian allow only a linear sequence of gates, hence only a linear\n(or nearly linear) path in the graph of all computational states. We extend\nthese techniques by allowing significantly more general paths, including\nbranching and cycles, thus enabling a highly efficient encoding of our\ncomputational model. However, this requires more sophisticated techniques for\nanalysing the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian. To address this, we\nintroduce a framework of graphs with unitary edge labels. After relating our\nHamiltonian to the Laplacian of such a unitary labelled graph, we analyse its\nspectrum by combining matrix analysis and spectral graph theory techniques.\n", "  Perturbation theory of thermodynamic potentials in QCD at $T>T_c$ is\nconsidered with the nonperturbative background vacuum taken into account. It is\nshown that the magnetic confinement in the QCD vacuum prevents the infrared\ncatastrophe of the perturbation theory present in the case of the free vacuum\n(the \"Linde problem\"). A short discussion is given of the applicability of the\nnonperturbative formalism at large $T$ and of the relation with the HTL\ntheory.The observation of A.D.Linde, that the terms $O(g^n), n>6$ contribute to\nthe order $O(g^6)$ is confirmed also with the account of the colormagnetic\nconfinement, and it is shown that the latter makes these terms IR convergent,\nand summable. As a result one obtains the selfconsistent theory of the gluon\nplasma.\n", "  There are two types of models that explain the appearance of the\nquasi-blackbody radiation during the impulsive phase of stellar flares. Grinin\nand Sobolev [Astrophysics, Vol. 13, 348 (1977)] argue that the blue component\nof the optical continuum is formed in \"the transition layer between the\nchromosphere and the photosphere.\" Katsova et al. [Astrophysics, Vol. 17, 156\n(1981)] have \"raised\" the source of the white-light continuum up to a dense\nregion in the perturbed chromosphere. In the present contribution (the main\npaper is published in \"Astrophysics\" [Vol. 59, 475 (2016); arXiv:1710.08008],\nwe show that this statement in the work of Katsova et al. is erroneous.\n", "  The spin state transition in LaCoO$_3$ has eluded description for decades\ndespite concerted theoretical and experimental effort. In this study, we\napproach this problem using fully charge self-consistent Density Functional\nTheory + Embedded Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DFT+DMFT). We show from first\nprinciples that LaCoO$_3$ cannot be described by a single, pure spin state at\nany temperature. Instead, we observe a gradual change in the population of\nhigher spin multiplets with increasing temperature, with the high spin\nmultiplets being excited at the onset of the spin state transition followed by\nthe intermediate spin multiplets being excited at the metal insulator\ntransition temperature. We explicitly elucidate the critical role of lattice\nexpansion and oxygen octahedral rotations in the spin state transition. We also\nreproduce, from first principles, that the spin state transition and the\nmetal-insulator transition in LaCoO$_3$ occur at different temperature scales.\nIn addition, our results shed light on the importance of electronic entropy in\ndriving the spin state transition, which has so far been ignored in all first\nprinciples studies of this material.\n", "  We analyze the shape and amplitude of oscillatory features in the primordial\npower spectrum and non-Gaussianity induced by periodic production of heavy\ndegrees of freedom coupled to the inflaton $\\phi$. We find that non-adiabatic\nproduction of particles can contribute effects which are detectable or\nconstrainable using cosmological data even if their time-dependent masses are\nalways heavier than the scale $\\dot \\phi^{1/2}$, much larger than the Hubble\nscale. This provides a new role for UV completion, consistent with the criteria\nfrom effective field theory for when heavy fields cannot be integrated out.\nThis analysis is motivated in part by the structure of axion monodromy, and\nleads to an additional oscillatory signature in a subset of its parameter\nspace. At the level of a quantum field theory model that we analyze in detail,\nthe effect arises consistently with radiative stability for an interesting\nwindow of couplings up to of order $\\lesssim 1$. The amplitude of the\nbispectrum and higher-point functions can be larger than that for Resonant\nNon-Gaussianity, and its signal/noise may be comparable to that of the\ncorresponding oscillations in the power spectrum (and even somewhat larger\nwithin a controlled regime of parameters). Its shape is distinct from\npreviously analyzed templates, but was partly motivated by the oscillatory\nequilateral searches performed recently by the {\\it Planck} collaboration. We\nalso make some general comments about the challenges involved in making a\nsystematic study of primordial non-Gaussianity.\n", "  Classical imaging works by scattering photons from an object to be imaged,\nand achieves resolution scaling as $1/\\sqrt{t}$, with $t$ the imaging time. By\ncontrast, the laws of quantum mechanics allow one to utilize quantum coherence\nto obtain imaging resolution that can scale as quickly as $1/t$ -- the\nso-called \"Heisenberg limit.\" However, ambiguities in the obtained signal often\npreclude taking full advantage of this quantum enhancement, while imaging\ntechniques designed to be unambiguous often lose this optimal Heisenberg\nscaling. Here, we demonstrate an imaging technique which combines unambiguous\ndetection of the target with Heisenberg scaling of the resolution. We also\ndemonstrate a binary search algorithm which can efficiently locate a coherent\ntarget using the technique, resolving a target trapped ion to within 0.3% of\nthe $1/e^2$ diameter of the excitation beam.\n", "  We compute the two-loop QED corrections to the Altarelli-Parisi (AP)\nsplitting functions by using a deconstructive algorithmic Abelianization of the\nwell-known NLO QCD corrections. We present explicit results for the full set of\nsplitting kernels in a basis that includes the leptonic distribution functions\nthat, starting from this order in the QED coupling, couple to the partonic\ndensities. Finally, we perform a phenomenological analysis of the impact of\nthese corrections in the splitting functions.\n", "  Perturbations of all sorts destabilise the rotation of a small body and leave\nit in a non-principal spin state. In such a state, the body experiences\nalternating stresses generated by the inertial forces. This yields nutation\nrelaxation, i.e., evolution of the spin towards the principal rotation about\nthe maximal-inertia axis. Knowledge of the timescales needed to damp the\nnutation is crucial in studies of small bodies' dynamics. In the literature\nhitherto, nutation relaxation has always been described with aid of an\nempirical quality factor $\\,Q\\,$ introduced to parameterise the energy\ndissipation rate.\n  Among the drawbacks of this approach was its inability to describe the\ndependence of the relaxation rate upon the current nutation angle. This\ninability stemmed from our lack of knowledge of the quality factor's dependence\non the forcing frequency. In this article, we derive our description of\nnutation damping directly from the rheological law obeyed by the material. This\nrenders us the nutation damping rate as a function of the current nutation\nangle, as well as of the shape and the rheological parameters of the body. In\ncontradistinction from the approach based on an empirical $\\,Q\\,$-factor, our\ndevelopment gives a zero damping rate in the spherical-shape limit. Our method\nis generic and applicable to any shape and to any linear rheological law.\nHowever, to simplify the developments, here we consider a dynamically oblate\nrotator with a Maxwell rheology.\n", "  This paper provides a prospectus for a new way of thinking about the\nwavefunction of the universe: a $\\Psi$-epistemic quantum cosmology. We present\na proposal that, if successfully implemented, would resolve the cosmological\nmeasurement problem and simultaneously allow us to think sensibly about\nprobability and evolution in quantum cosmology. Our analysis draws upon recent\nwork on the problem of time in quantum gravity, upon causally-symmetric local\nhidden variable theories, and upon a dynamical origin for the cosmological\narrow of time. Our conclusion weighs the strengths and weaknesses of the\napproach and points towards paths for future development.\n", "  Verifiable blind quantum computing allows a client with poor quantum devices\nto delegate universal quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a\nway that the client's privacy is protected and the honesty of the server is\nverified. In existing protocols, the client has to send single-qubit states to\nthe server. These states might be decohered by the channel noise. Furthermore,\nthe client hides some \"trap\" qubits in the server's register so that the client\ncan detect the server's deviation. In reality, however, these trap qubits are\ndisturbed by imperfect operations by the server, which reduces the probability\nthat the client accepts the honest server. To solve these problems, we propose\na new gadget that allows the client to remotely prepare encoded logical\nsingle-qubit states in the server's place. Importantly, in our fault-tolerant\nverifiable blind quantum computing protocol, the client needs only the ability\nof physical single-qubit measurements in $X$ and $Z$ bases.\n", "  It is proposed to employ the P,T-odd Faraday effect, i.e. rotation of the\npolarization plane of the light propagating through a medium in presence of the\nelectric field, as a tool for observation of P,T-odd effects caused by CP\nviolation within the Standard Model. For this purpose the vapors of heavy atoms\nlike Tl, Pb, Bi are most suitable. Estimates within the Standard Model show:\nprovided that applied field is about 10^5 V/cm and the optical length can be as\nlarge as 70000 km, the rotation angle may reach the value corresponding to the\nrecently observable values (10^{-9} rad). These estimates demonstrate that the\nP,T-odd Faraday effect observations may effectively compete with the recent\nmeasurements of the electron spin rotation in an external electric field,\nperformed with diatomic molecules. These measurements exclude the P,T-odd\neffects at the level 9 orders of magnitude higher than the predictions of the\nStandard Model.\n", "  We develop the two-instanton approximation to the current-voltage\ncharacteristic of a single electron transistor within the\nAmbegaokar-Eckern-Sch\\\"on model. We determine the temperature and gate voltage\ndependence of the Coulomb blockade oscillations of the conductance and the\neffective charge. We find that a small (in comparison with the charging energy)\nbias voltage leads to significant suppression of the Coulomb blockade\noscillations and to appearance of the bias-dependent phase shift.\n", "  Electrical transport in double quantum dots (DQDs) illuminates many\ninteresting features of the dots' carrier states. Recent advances in silicon\nquantum information technologies have renewed interest in the valley states of\nelectrons confined in silicon. Here we show measurements of DC transport\nthrough a mesa-etched silicon double quantum dot. Comparing bias triangles\n(i.e., regions of allowed current in DQDs) at positive and negative bias\nvoltages we find a systematic asymmetry in the size of the bias triangles at\nthe two bias polarities. Asymmetries of this nature are associated with\nblocking of tunneling events due to the occupation of a metastable state.\nSeveral features of our data lead us to conclude that the states involved are\nnot simple spin states. Rather, we develop a model based on selective filling\nof valley states in the DQD that is consistent with all of the qualitative\nfeatures of our data.\n", "  We examine the correlations between rings in random network glasses in two\ndimensions as a function of their separation. Initially, we use the topological\nseparation (measured by the number of intervening rings), but this leads to\npseudo-long-range correlations due to a lack of topological charge neutrality\nin the shells surrounding a central ring. This effect is associated with the\nnon-circular nature of the shells. It is, therefore, necessary to use the\ngeometrical distance between ring centers. Hence we find a generalization of\nthe Aboav-Weaire law out to larger distances, with the correlations between\nrings decaying away when two rings are more than about 3 rings apart.\n", "  In the Solar system, a quasi-satellite is an object that follows a\nheliocentric path with an orbital period that matches almost exactly with that\nof a host body (planetary or not). The trajectory is of such nature that,\nwithout being gravitationally attached, the value of the angular separation\nbetween host and quasi-satellite as seen from the Sun remains confined within\nrelatively narrow limits for time-spans that exceed the length of the host's\nsidereal orbital period. Here, we show that under these conditions, a\nquasi-satellite traces an analemma in the sky as observed from the host in a\nmanner similar to that found for geosynchronous orbits. The analemmatic curve\n(figure-eight-, teardrop-, ellipse-shaped) results from the interplay between\nthe tilt of the rotational axis of the host and the properties of the orbit of\nthe quasi-satellite. The analemma criterion can be applied to identify true\nquasi-satellite dynamical behaviour using observational or synthetic astrometry\nand it is tested for several well-documented quasi-satellites. For the\nparticular case of 15810 (1994 JR1), a putative accidental quasi-satellite of\ndwarf planet Pluto, we show explicitly that this object describes a complex\nanalemmatic curve for several Plutonian sidereal periods, confirming its\ntransient quasi-satellite status.\n", "  A number of Earth co-orbital asteroids experience repeated transitions\nbetween the quasi-satellite and horseshoe dynamical states. Asteroids 2001 GO2,\n2002 AA29, 2003 YN107 and 2015 SO2 are well-documented cases of such a\ndynamical behaviour. These transitions depend on the gravitational influence of\nother planets, owing to the overlapping of a multiplicity of secular\nresonances. Here, we show that the recently discovered asteroid (469219) 2016\nHO3 is a quasi-satellite of our planet -the fifth one, joining the ranks of\n(164207) 2004 GU9, (277810) 2006 FV35, 2013 LX28 and 2014 OL339. This new Earth\nco-orbital also switches repeatedly between the quasi-satellite and horseshoe\nconfigurations. Its current quasi-satellite episode started nearly 100 yr ago\nand it will end in about 300 yr from now. The orbital solution currently\navailable for this object is very robust and our full N-body calculations show\nthat it may be a long-term companion (time-scale of Myr) to our planet. Among\nthe known Earth quasi-satellites, it is the closest to our planet and as such,\na potentially accessible target for future in situ study. Due to its presumably\nlengthy dynamical relationship with the Earth and given the fact that at\npresent and for many decades this transient object remains well positioned with\nrespect to our planet, the results of spectroscopic studies of this small body,\n26-115 m, may be particularly useful to improve our understanding of the\norigins -local or captured- of Earth's co-orbital asteroid population. The\nnon-negligible effect of the uncertainty in the value of the mass of Jupiter on\nthe stability of this type of co-orbitals is also briefly explored.\n", "  We employ large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to study a particle-hole\nsymmetric site-diluted quantum rotor model in two dimensions. The ground state\nphase diagram of this system features two distinct quantum phase transitions\nbetween the superfluid and the insulating (Mott glass) phases. They are\nseparated by a multicritical point. The generic transition for dilutions below\nthe lattice percolation threshold is driven by quantum fluctuations while the\ntransition across the percolation threshold is due to the geometric\nfluctuations of the lattice. We determine the location of the multicritical\npoint between these two transitions and find its critical behavior. The\nmulticritical exponents read $z=1.72(2)$, $\\beta/\\nu=0.41(2)$, and\n$\\gamma/\\nu=2.90(5)$ . We compare our results to other quantum phase\ntransitions in disordered systems, and we discuss experiments.\n", "  The Giant Impact is currently accepted as the leading theory for the\nformation of Earth's Moon. Successful scenarios for lunar origin should be able\nto explain the chemical composition of the Moon (volatile content and stable\nisotope ratios), the Moon's initial thermal state, and the system's bulk\nphysical and dynamical properties. Hydrocode simulations of the formation of\nthe Moon have long been able to match the bulk properties, but recent, more\ndetailed work on the evolution of the protolunar disk has yielded great insight\ninto the origin of the Moon's chemistry, and its early thermal history. Here, I\nshow that the community has constructed the elements of an end-to-end theory\nfor lunar origin that matches the overwhelming majority of observational\nconstraints. In spite of the great progress made in recent years, new samples\nof the Moon, clarification of processes in the impact-generated disk, and a\nbroader exploration of impact parameter space could yield even more insights\ninto this fundamental and uniquely challenging geophysical problem.\n", "  We study theoretically single electron loss from helium-like highly charged\nions involving excitation and decay of autoionizing states of the ion. Electron\nloss is caused by either photo absorption or the interaction with a fast atomic\nparticle (a bare nucleus, a neutral atom, an electron). The interactions with\nthe photon field and the fast particles are taken into account in the first\norder of perturbation theory. Two initial states of the ion are considered:\n$1s^2$ and $(1s2s)_{J=0}$. We analyze in detail how the shape of the emission\npattern depends on the atomic number $Z_{I}$ of the ion discussing, in\nparticular, the inter-relation between electron loss via photo absorption and\ndue to the impact of atomic particles in collisions at modest relativistic and\nextreme relativistic energies. According to our results, in electron loss from\nthe $1s^2$ state autoionization may substantially influence the shape of the\nemission spectra only up to $Z_{I} \\approx 35-40$. A much more prominent role\nis played by autoionization in electron loss from $(1s2s)_{J=0}$ where it not\nonly strongly affect the shape of the emission pattern but also may\nsubstantially increase the total loss cross section.\n", "  Measurement-based quantum computing enables universal quantum computing with\nonly adaptive single-qubit measurements on certain many-qubit states, such as\nthe graph state, the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state, and several\ntensor-network states. Finding new resource states of measurement-based quantum\ncomputing is a hard task, since for a given state there are exponentially many\npossible measurement patterns on the state. In this paper, we consider the\nproblem of deciding, for a given state and a set of unitary operators, whether\nthere exists a way of measurement-based quantum computing on the state that can\nrealize all unitaries in the set, or not. We show that the decision problem is\nQCMA-hard, which means that finding new resource states of measurement-based\nquantum computing is harder than quantum computing itself (unless BQP is equal\nto QCMA). We also derive an upperbound of the decision problem: the problem is\nin a quantum version of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.\n", "  NoAM for \"No Action Method\" is a framework for reconstructing the past orbits\nof observed tracers of the large scale mass density field. It seeks exact\nsolutions of the equations of motion (EoM), satisfying initial homogeneity and\nthe final observed particle (tracer) positions. The solutions are found\niteratively reaching a specified tolerance defined as the RMS of the distance\nbetween reconstructed and observed positions. Starting from a guess for the\ninitial conditions, NoAM advances particles using standard N-body techniques\nfor solving the EoM. Alternatively, the EoM can be replaced by any\napproximation such as Zel'dovich and second order perturbation theory (2LPT).\nNoAM is suitable for billions of particles and can easily handle non-regular\nvolumes, redshift space, and other constraints. We implement NoAM to\nsystematically compare Zel'dovich, 2LPT, and N-body dynamics over diverse\nconfigurations ranging from idealized high-res periodic simulation box to\nrealistic galaxy mocks. Our findings are (i) Non-linear reconstructions with\nZel'dovich, 2LPT, and full dynamics perform better than linear theory only for\nidealized catalogs in real space. For realistic catalogs, linear theory is the\noptimal choice for reconstructing velocity fields smoothed on scales > 5 Mpc/h.\n(ii) all non-linear back-in-time reconstructions tested here, produce\ncomparable enhancement of the baryonic oscillation signal in the correlation\nfunction.\n", "  Much of the novel physics predicted to be observable in the ultrastrong\nlight-matter coupling regime rests on the hybridisation between states with\ndifferent numbers of excitations, leading to a population of virtual photons in\nthe system's ground state. In this article, exploiting an exact diagonalization\napproach, we derive both analytical and numerical results for the population of\nvirtual photons in presence of arbitrary losses. Specialising our results to\nthe case of Lorentzian resonances we then show that the virtual photon\npopulation is only quantitatively affected by losses, even when those become\nthe dominant energy scale. Our results demonstrate most of the\nultrastrong-coupling phenomenology can be observed in loss-dominated systems\nwhich are not even in the standard strong coupling regime. We thus open the\npossibility to investigate ultrastrong-coupling physics to platforms that were\npreviously considered unsuitable due to their large losses.\n", "  We study the behavior of a single laser-driven trapped ion inside a\nmicroscopic optical Fabry-Perot cavity. In particular, we demonstrate a fiber\nFabry-Perot cavity operating on the principal $S_{1/2}\\to P_{1/2}$ electric\ndipole transition of an Yb$^+$ ion at $369\\,$nm with an atom-ion coupling\nstrength of $g=2\\pi\\times 67(1)\\,$MHz. We employ the cavity to study the\ngeneration of single photons and observe cavity-induced back-action in the\nPurcell-enhanced emission of photons. Tuning of the amplitude and phase of the\nback-action allows us to enhance or suppress the total rate of photoemission\nfrom the ion-cavity system.\n", "  Standard projective measurements represent a subset of all possible\nmeasurements in quantum physics, defined by positive-operator-valued measures.\nWe study what quantum measurements are projective simulable, that is, can be\nsimulated by using projective measurements and classical randomness. We first\nprove that every measurement on a given quantum system can be realised by\nclassical processing of projective measurements on the system plus an ancilla\nof the same dimension. Then, given a general measurement in dimension two or\nthree, we show that deciding whether it is projective-simulable can be solved\nby means of semi-definite programming. We also establish conditions for the\nsimulation of measurements using projective ones valid for any dimension. As an\napplication of our formalism, we improve the range of visibilities for which\ntwo-qubit Werner states do not violate any Bell inequality for all\nmeasurements. From an implementation point of view, our work provides bounds on\nthe amount of noise a measurement tolerates before losing any advantage over\nprojective ones.\n", "  Gravel-river beds typically have an \"armored\" layer of coarse grains on the\nsurface, which acts to protect finer particles underneath from erosion. River\nbed-load transport is a kind of dense granular flow, and such flows are known\nto vertically segregate grains. The contribution of granular physics to\nriver-bed armoring, however, has not been investigated. Here we examine these\nconnections in a laboratory river with bimodal sediment size, by tracking the\nmotion of particles from the surface to deep inside the bed, and find that\narmor develops by two distinct mechanisms. Bed-load transport in the\nnear-surface layer drives rapid segregation, with a vertical advection rate\nproportional to the granular shear rate. Creeping grains beneath the bed-load\nlayer give rise to slow but persistent segregation, which is diffusion\ndominated and insensitive to shear rate. We verify these findings with a\ncontinuum phenomenological model and discrete element method simulations. Our\nresults suggest that river beds armor by granular segregation from below ---\nrather than fluid-driven sorting from above --- while also providing new\ninsights on the mechanics of segregation that are relevant to a wide range of\ngranular flows.\n", "  First-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations are performed on 6 and\n12% Na in dense liquid N. A detailed description of structural and electronic\nproperties leading to an understanding of the effect of Na-doping on the\npolymerization phase transition of N is presented. Compression of the mixtures\nfrom 5 to 90 GPa shows three distinct regions of characteristic local order\nseparated by pressures near 30 and 65 GPa. Computation of Gibbs free energies\nof mixing shows that these mixtures are thermodynamically stable beyond 20 and\n15 GPa for 6 and 12 % Na respectively.\n", "  Achieving strong interactions between individual photons enables a wide\nvariety of exciting possibilities in quantum information science and many-body\nphysics. Cold atoms interfaced with nanophotonic structures have emerged as a\nplatform to realize novel forms of nonlinear interactions. In particular, when\natoms are coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW), long-range atomic\ninteractions can arise that are mediated by localized atom-photon bound states.\nWe theoretically show that in such a system, the absorption of a single photon\ncan change the band structure for a subsequent photon. This occurs because the\nfirst photon affects the atoms in the chain in an alternating fashion, thus\nleading to an effective period doubling of the system and a new optical band\nstructure for the composite atom-nanophotonic system. We demonstrate how this\nmechanism can be engineered to realize a single-photon switch, where the first\nincoming photon switches the system from being highly transmissive to highly\nreflective, and analyze how signatures can be observed via non-classical\ncorrelations of the outgoing photon field.\n", "  Persistent photon echoes are seen for the case of a large number of two-level\nmolecules (TLMs) prepared initially in the all-down state (large negative spin)\ninteracting with a photon distribution with a small mean photon number in a\nlossless cavity. This case is interesting since 1) it has not been\nsignificantly addressed in the past; 2) the characteristic times associated\nwith revival are not what is seen for the more frequently addressed problem of\na few TLMs interacting with a photon distribution with a large mean photon\nnumber; 3) long after the echoes die out, they re-emerge completely at a much\nlater time; and 4) the existence of echoes is not predicated on the initial\nphoton distribution being the coherent state or Glauber distribution. Entropy,\nentanglement, and the Q function are considered. It is found that\ndisentanglement only occurs at the revival times as evidenced by the entropy\ngoing to 0 and the Q function returning to the value seen at time=0. Comparison\nto the more normally seen results for large mean photon number and small\nnumbers of TLMs are discussed. Finally this paper acts as a general reference\nfor future refereed publications.\n", "  The well-defined but intricate course of time evolution exhibited by many\nnaturally occurring phenomena suggests some source of dynamic order sustaining\nit. In spite of its obviousness as a problem, it has remained absent from the\nscientific debate due to the lack of candidates for a proper answer. Here we\npropose a general explanation based on the oscillatory possibilities of the\ndynamical systems, as demonstrated with a family of differential equations\nexhibiting self-sustained oscillations of unbounded complexity: complex\nevolutions by nonlinear mixing of an arbitrarily large number of oscillation\nmodes, in which the different modes describe specific dynamical activities and\ntheir combination articulates the interactive conjunction of such activities\ninto the whole functioning. The dynamical scenario is rather generic since it\nis exclusively based on the reiterative occurrence of the two most standard\nmechanisms of nonlinear dynamics: the saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations, and\nits extraordinary richness makes feasible the well-defined occurrence of\nordered features over enormously complex dynamical activities as simply arising\nfrom the proper structure of dynamical relations among the system components,\ni.e., without requiring any other physical cause than those involved in such\nrelations.\n", "  We consider the possibility of Majorana neutrinos production at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) by studying the $pp \\rightarrow l_i^{+} l_j^{+} +2~jets$\n($l_j\\equiv e ,\\mu$) process which, due to leptonic number violation, is a\nclear signature for intermediate Majorana neutrino contributions. The\ninteractions between Majorana neutrinos and the Standard Model particles are\nobtained from an effective lagrangian approach. Majorana neutrinos with masses\nof a few $GeV$ are long-lived neutral particles, and we take advantage of its\nmeasurable decay length: in the same-sign dilepton channel, we exploit this\nfact imposing cuts that reject the $SM$ background, and analyze the\ndistribution corresponding to the angle between the final leptons, using a\nforward-backward asymmetry to study the effects of the different gauge\ninvariant operators. We also study the $pp\\rightarrow l_i^+ \\nu \\gamma$\nprocess, which is dominant for low $m_N$ masses if tensorial one-loop generated\nnew physics contributions are present. This channel could be observed at the\nLHC with the aid of non-pointing photons observables and cuts on the\ndisplacement between the prompt lepton and the photon.\n", "  Mechanical strain can lead to a synthetic gauge field that controls the\ndynamics of electrons in graphene sheets as well as light in photonic crystals.\nHere, we show how to engineer an analogous synthetic gauge field for lattice\nvibrations. Our approach relies on one of two strategies: shearing a honeycomb\nlattice of masses and springs or patterning its local material stiffness. As a\nresult, vibrational spectra with discrete Landau levels are generated. Upon\ntuning the strength of the gauge field, we can control the density of states\nand transverse spatial confinement of sound in the metamaterial. We also use\nthe gauge field to design waveguides in which sound propagates robustly, as a\nconsequence of the change in topological polarization that occurs along a\ndomain wall in the bulk of the metamaterial. By introducing dissipation, we can\nselectively enhance the domain-wall-bound topological sound mode, a feature\nthat may be exploited for the design of sound amplification by stimulated\nemission of radiation - SASERs, the mechanical analogs of lasers.\n", "  Liquids composed of self-propelled particles have been experimentally\nrealized using molecular, colloidal, or macroscopic constituents. These active\nliquids can flow spontaneously even in the absence of an external drive. Unlike\nspontaneous active flow, the propagation of density waves in confined active\nliquids is not well explored. Here, we exploit a mapping between density waves\non top of a chiral flow and electrons in a synthetic gauge field to lay out\ndesign principles for artificial structures termed topological active\nmetamaterials. We design metamaterials that break time-reversal symmetry using\nlattices composed of annular channels filled with a spontaneously flowing\nactive liquid. Such active metamaterials support topologically protected sound\nmodes that propagate unidirectionally, without backscattering, along either\nsample edges or domain walls and despite overdamped particle dynamics. Our work\nillustrates how parity-symmetry breaking in metamaterial structure combined\nwith microscopic irreversibility of active matter leads to novel\nfunctionalities that cannot be achieved using only passive materials.\n", "  We give explicitly in the closed formulae the genus zero primary potentials\nof the three 6-dimensional FJRW theories of the simple-elliptic singularity\n$\\tilde E_7$ with the non-maximal symmetry groups. For each of these FJRW\ntheories we establish the CY/LG correspondence to the Gromov-Witten theory of\nthe orbifold $[\\mathcal{E}/ (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})]$ --- the orbifold\nquotient of the elliptic curve by the hyperelliptic involution. Namely, we give\nexplicitly the Givental's group elements, whose actions on the partition\nfunction of the Gromov--Witten theory of $[\\mathcal{E}/\n(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})]$ give up to a linear change of the variables the\npartition functions of the FJRW theories mentioned. We keep track of the linear\nchanges of the variables needed. We show that using only the axioms of\nFan--Jarvis--Ruan, the genus zero potential can only be reconstructed up to a\nscaling.\n", "  This paper starts with a brief historical review about the PNLF and its use\nas a distance indicator. Then the PNLF distances are compared with Surface\nBrightness Fluctuations (SBF) distances and Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)\ndistances. A Monte Carlo method to generate simulated PNLFs is described,\nleading to the last subject: recent progress in reproducing the expected\nmaximum final mass in old stellar populations, a stellar astrophysics enigma\nthat has been challenging us for quite some time.\n", "  We present a general mathematical framework for trajectory stratification for\nsimulating rare events. Trajectory stratification involves decomposing\ntrajectories of the underlying process into fragments limited to restricted\nregions of state space (strata), computing averages over the distributions of\nthe trajectory fragments within the strata with minimal communication between\nthem, and combining those averages with appropriate weights to yield averages\nwith respect to the original underlying process. Our framework reveals the full\ngenerality and flexibility of trajectory stratification, and it illuminates a\ncommon mathematical structure shared by existing algorithms for sampling rare\nevents. We demonstrate the power of the framework by defining strata in terms\nof both points in time and path-dependent variables for efficiently estimating\naverages that were not previously tractable.\n", "  We propose a new universal mechanism that makes it possible to drive an\nindividual atomic spin using a spin polarized scanning tunnel microscope (STM)\nwith an oscillating electric signal. We show that the combination of the\ndistance dependent exchange with the magnetic tip and the electrically driven\nmechanical oscillation of the surface spins permits to control their quantum\nstate. Based on a combination of density functional theory and multiplet\ncalculations, we show that the proposed mechanism is essential to account for\nthe recently observed electrically driven paramagnetic spin resonance (ESR) of\nan individual Fe atom on a MgO/Ag(100) surface. Our findings set the foundation\nto deploy the ESR-STM quantum sensing technique to a much broader class of\nsystems.\n", "  Despite years of effort, the impact of central star binarity on planetary\nnebula formation and shaping remains unclear. This is hampered by the fact that\ndetecting central star binarity is inherently difficult, and requires very\nprecise observations. The fraction of planetary nebulae with binary central\nstars therefore remains elusive. This work presents initial results of central\nstar analysis using data from the VST H$\\alpha$ Survey of the Southern Galactic\nPlane and Bulge (VPHAS+). The true central star of PN Hf 38 has been revealed,\nand it exhibits a 0.465$\\pm$0.334 $i$ band magnitude excess, indicative of a\nM0V companion.\n", "  Cosmological simulations involving the fully covariant gravitational dynamics\nmay prove relevant in understanding relativistic/non-linear features and,\ntherefore, in taking better advantage of the upcoming large scale structure\nsurvey data. We propose a new 3+1 integration scheme for General Relativity in\nthe case where the matter sector contains a minimally-coupled perfect fluid\nfield. The original feature is that we completely eliminate the fluid\ncomponents through the constraint equations, thus remaining with a set of\nunconstrained evolution equations for the rest of the fields. This procedure\ndoes not constrain the lapse function and shift vector, so it holds in\narbitrary gauge and also works for arbitrary equation of state. An important\nadvantage of this scheme is that it allows one to define and pass an adaptation\nof the robustness test to the cosmological context, at least in the case of\npressureless perfect fluid matter, which is the relevant one for late-time\ncosmology.\n", "  Circumstellar envelopes (CEs) around evolved stars are an active site for the\nproduction of molecules. After evolving through the Asymptotic Giant Branch\n(AGB), proto-planetary nebula (PPN), to planetary nebula (PN) phases, CEs\nultimately merge with the interstellar medium (ISM). The study of molecules in\nPNe, therefore, is essential to understanding the transition from stellar to\ninterstellar materials. So far, over 20 molecular species have been discovered\nin PNe. The molecular composition of PNe is rather different from those of AGB\nand PPNe, suggesting that the molecules synthesized in PN progenitors have been\nheavily processed by strong ultraviolet radiation from the central star.\nIntriguingly, fullerenes and complex organic compounds having aromatic and\naliphatic structures can be rapidly formed and largely survive during the\nPPN/PN evolution. The similar molecular compositions in PNe and diffuse clouds\nas well as the detection of C$_{60}^+$ in the ISM reinforce the view that the\nmass-loss from PNe can significantly enrich the ISM with molecular species,\nsome of which may be responsible for the diffuse interstellar bands. In this\ncontribution, I briefly summarize some recent observations of molecules in PNe,\nwith emphasis on their implications on circumstellar chemistry.\n", "  In this paper, we build upon the successes of the ultraviolet (UV) completion\nof the Starobinsky model of inflation. This involves an extension of the\nEinstein-Hilbert term by an infinite covariant derivative theory of gravity,\nwhich is quadratic in curvature. It has been shown that such a theory can\npotentially resolve the cosmological singularity for a flat, homogeneous and\nisotropic geometry, and now it can also provide a successful cosmological\ninflation model, which in the infrared matches all the predictions of the\nStarobinsky model of inflation. The aim of this note is to show that the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio is modified by the scale of non-locality, and in general\na wider range of tensor-to-scalar ratios can be obtained in this class of\nmodel, which can put a lower bound on the scale of non-locality for the first\ntime as large as the O$(10^{14})$ GeV.\n", "  We describe a quantum limit to measurement of classical spacetimes.\nSpecifically, we formulate a quantum Cramer-Rao lower bound for estimating the\nsingle parameter in any one-parameter family of spacetime metrics. We employ\nthe locally covariant formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime,\nwhich allows for a manifestly background-independent derivation. The result is\nan uncertainty relation that applies to all globally hyperbolic spacetimes.\nAmong other examples, we apply our method to detection of gravitational waves\nusing the electromagnetic field as a probe, as in laser-interferometric\ngravitational-wave detectors. Other applications are discussed, from\nterrestrial gravimetry to cosmology.\n", "  The discrepancy between abundances computed using optical recombination lines\n(ORLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs) is a major, unresolved problem\nwith significant implications for the determination of chemical abundances\nthroughout the Universe. In planetary nebulae (PNe), the most common\nexplanation for the discrepancy is that two different gas phases coexist: a hot\ncomponent with standard metallicity, and a much colder plasma enhanced in heavy\nelements. This dual nature is not predicted by mass loss theories, and direct\nobservational support for it is still weak. In this work, we present our recent\nfindings that demonstrate that the largest abundance discrepancies are\nassociated with close binary central stars. OSIRIS-GTC tunable filter imaging\nof the faint O II ORLs and MUSE-VLT deep 2D spectrophotometry confirm that O II\nORL emission is more centrally concentrated than that of [O III] CELs and,\ntherefore, that the abundance discrepancy may be closely linked to binary\nevolution.\n", "  In Planetary Nebulae (PNe) and HII regions ionic abundances can be derived by\nusing collisionally excited lines (CELs) or recombination lines (ORLs). Such\nabundances do not coincide for the same ion and usually abundances from ORLs\nare larger than those from CELs by factors of 2 or larger. The origin of the\ndiscrepancy, known as the Abundance Discrepancy Factor is an open problem in\nastrophysics of gaseous nebulae. It has been attributed to temperature\nfluctuations in the plasma, tiny metal-rich inclusions embedded in the H-rich\nplasma, gas inhomogeneities or other processes. In this work we analyze the\nkinematical behavior of CELs and ORLs in two PNe ionized by [WC] stars, finding\nthat kinematics of ORLS is incompatible with the kinematics of CELs. In\nparticular the expansion velocities from CELs and ORLs for the same ion are\ndifferent, indicating that ORLs seem to be produced in zones nearer the central\nstar than CELs. This is in agreement with results found by other authors for\nindividual PNe.\n", "  Measurements of the associated production of a Z boson with at least one jet\noriginating from a b quark in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV are\npresented. Differential cross sections are measured with data collected by the\nCMS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.8 inverse\nfemtobarns. Z bosons are reconstructed through their decays to electrons and\nmuons. Cross sections are measured as a function of observables characterizing\nthe kinematics of the b jet and the Z boson. Ratios of differential cross\nsections for the associated production with at least one b jet to the\nassociated production with any jet are also presented. The production of a Z\nboson with two b jets is investigated, and differential cross sections are\nmeasured for the dijet system. Results are compared to theoretical predictions,\ntesting two different flavour schemes for the choice of initial-state partons.\n", "  To characterize the absorption properties of this circumgalactic medium (CGM)\nand its relation to the LG we present the so-far largest survey of metal\nabsorption in Galactic high-velocity clouds (HVCs) using archival ultraviolet\n(UV) spectra of extragalactic background sources. The UV data are obtained with\nthe Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nand are supplemented by 21 cm radio observations of neutral hydrogen. Along 270\nsightlines we measure metal absorption in the lines of SiII, SiIII, CII, and\nCIV and associated HI 21 cm emission in HVCs in the velocity range\n|v_LSR|=100-500 km s^-1. With this unprecedented large HVC sample we were able\nto improve the statistics on HVC covering fractions, ionization conditions,\nsmall-scale structure, CGM mass, and inflow rate. For the first time, we\ndetermine robustly the angular two point correlation function of the\nhigh-velocity absorbers, systematically analyze antipodal sightlines on the\ncelestial sphere, and compare the absorption characteristics with that of\nDamped Lyman alpha absorbers (DLAs) and constrained cosmological simulations of\nthe LG. Our study demonstrates that the Milky Way CGM contains sufficient\ngaseous material to maintain the Galactic star-formation rate at its current\nlevel. We show that the CGM is composed of discrete gaseous structures that\nexhibit a large-scale kinematics together with small-scale variations in\nphysical conditions. The Magellanic Stream clearly dominates both the cross\nsection and mass flow of high-velocity gas in the Milky Way's CGM. The possible\npresence of high-velocity LG gas underlines the important role of the local\ncosmological environment in the large-scale gas-circulation processes in and\naround the Milky Way (abridged).\n", "  We identified voids in the completed VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift\nSurvey (VIPERS), using an algorithm based on searching for empty spheres. We\nmeasured the cross-correlation between the centres of voids and the complete\ngalaxy catalogue. The cross-correlation function exhibits a clear anisotropy in\nboth VIPERS fields (W1 and W4), which is characteristic of linear redshift\nspace distortions. By measuring the projected cross-correlation and then\ndeprojecting it we are able to estimate the undistorted cross-correlation\nfunction. We propose that given a sufficiently well measured cross-correlation\nfunction one should be able to measure the linear growth rate of structure by\napplying a simple linear Gaussian streaming model for the redshift space\ndistortions (RSD). Our study of voids in 306 mock galaxy catalogues mimicking\nthe VIPERS fields would suggest that VIPERS is capable of measuring $\\beta$\nwith an error of around $25\\%$. Applying our method to the VIPERS data, we find\na value for the redshift space distortion parameter, $\\beta =\n0.423^{+0.104}_{-0.108}$, which given the bias of the galaxy population we use\ngives a linear growth rate of $f\\sigma_8 = 0.296^{+0.075}_{-0.078}$ at $z =\n0.727$. These results are consistent with values observed in parallel VIPERS\nanalysis using standard techniques.\n", "  Under various conditions of the growth process, when the presumably\nunconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ (SRO) contains micro-inclusions of\nRu metal, the superconducting critical temperature increases significantly. An\nSTEM study shows a sharp interface geometry which allows crystals of SRO and of\nRu-metal to grow side by side by forming a commensurate superlattice structure\nat the interface. In an attempt to shed light as to why this happens, we\ninvestigated the atomic structure and electronic properties of the interface\nbetween the oxide and the metal micro-inclusions using density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations. Our results support the observed structure\nindicating that it is energetically favored over other types of Ru-metal/SRO\ninterfaces. We find that a $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ orbital mixing occurs at the\ninterface with significantly enhanced magnetic moments. Based on our findings,\nwe argue that an inclusion mediated interlayer coupling reduces phase\nfluctuations of the superconducting order parameter which could explain the\nobserved enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in SRO samples\ncontaining micro-inclusions.\n", "  The resonant interaction of the $\\phi^4$ kink with a periodic\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric perturbation is observed in the frame of the continuum\nmodel and with the help of a two degree of freedom collective variable model\nderived in PRA 89, 010102(R). When the kink interacts with the perturbation,\nthe kink's internal mode is excited with the amplitude varying in time\nquasiperiodically. The maximal value of the amplitude was found to grow when\nthe kink velocity is such that it travels one period of perturbation is nearly\none period of the kink's internal mode. It is also found that the kink's\ntranslational and vibrational modes are coupled in a way that an increase in\nthe kink's internal mode amplitude results in a decrease in kink velocity. The\nresults obtained with the collective variable method are in a good qualitative\nagreement with the numerical simulations for the continuum model. The results\nof the present study suggest that kink dynamics in open systems with balanced\ngain and loss can have new features in comparison with the case of conservative\nsystems.\n", "  In this brief invited review, I will attempt to summarise some of the key\nareas of interest in the study of central stars of planetary nebulae which\n(probably) won't be covered by other speakers' proceedings. The main focus\nwill, inevitably, be on the subject of multiplicity, with special emphasis on\nrecent results regarding triple central star systems as well as wide binaries\nwhich avoid a common-envelope phase. Furthermore, in light of the upcoming\nrelease of Kepler's Campaign 11 data, I will discuss a few of the prospects\nfrom that data including the unique possibility to detect merger products.\n", "  A detailed examination of new high quality radio catalogues (e.g. Cornish) in\ncombination with available mid-infrared (MIR) satellite imagery (e.g. Glimpse)\nhas allowed us to find 70 new planetary nebula (PN) candidates based on\nexisting knowledge of their typical colors and fluxes. To further examine the\nnature of these sources, multiple diagnostic tools have been applied to these\ncandidates based on published data and on available imagery in the HASH (Hong\nKong/ AAO/ Strasbourg H{\\alpha} planetary nebula) research platform. Some\ncandidates have previously-missed optical counterparts allowing for\nspectroscopic follow-up. Indeed, the single object spectroscopically observed\nso far has turned out to be a bona fide PN.\n", "  Harnessing multimode waves allows high information capacity through modal\nexpansions. Although passive multimode devices including waveguides, couplers,\nand multiplexers have been demonstrated for broadband responses in momentum or\nfrequency domains, collective switching of multimodes remains a challenge, due\nto the difficulty in imposing consistent dynamics on all eigenmodes. Here we\novercome this limitation by realizing digital switching of spatially random\nwaves, based on supersymmetric pairs of multimode potentials. We reveal that\nsupersymmetric transformations of any parity-symmetric potential derive the\nparity reversal of all eigenmodes, which allows the complete isolation of\nrandom waves at the 'off' state. Building blocks for binary and many-valued\nlogics are then demonstrated for random waves: a harmonic pair for binary\nswitching of arbitrary wavefronts and a P\\\"oschl-Teller pair for multi-level\nswitching which implements the fuzzy membership function. Our results\nestablishing global phase matching conditions for multimode dynamics will lay\nthe foundation of multi-channel digital photonics.\n", "  Nearly 50 years ago, in the proceedings of the first IAU symposium on\nplanetary nebulae, Lawrence H. Aller and Stanley J. Czyzak said that \"the\nproblem of determination of the chemical compositions of planetary and other\ngaseous nebulae constitutes one of the most exasperating problems in\nastrophysics\". Although the situation has greatly improved over the years, many\nimportant problems are still open and new questions have arrived to the field,\nwhich still is an active field of study. Here I will review some of the main\naspects related to the determination of gaseous abundances in PNe and some\nrelevant results derived in the last five years, since the last IAU symposium\non PNe.\n", "  A subset of Post-AGB (PAGB) objects are the highly luminous RV Tauri\nvariables that show similarities to Type-II Cepheids. By using a sample of\nknown RV Tauri stars from the Magellanic Clouds we are able to determine period\nluminosity relationships (PLRs) in various bands that have been used to\ndetermine the luminosities of their Galactic counterparts. We have gathered all\navailable photometry in order to generate an SED for each object and determine\nthe total integrated flux. This total flux combined with a calculated or\ninferred intrinsic luminosity leads to a distance (Vickers et al. 2015). This\ndistance catalogue has allowed us to begin to constrain the physical parameters\nof this poorly understood evolutionary phase and to determine links between\nthese physical characteristics as a function of their stellar population.\n", "  The HASH (Hong Kong/ AAO/ Strasbourg/ H{\\alpha}) planetary nebula research\nplatform is a unique data repository with a graphical interface and SQL\ncapability that offers the community powerful, new ways to undertake Galactic\nPN studies. HASH currently contains multi-wavelength images, spectra,\npositions, sizes, morphologies and other data whenever available for 2401 true,\n447 likely, and 692 possible Galactic PNe, for a total of 3540 objects. An\nadditional 620 Galactic post-AGB stars, pre-PNe, and PPN candidates are\nincluded. All objects were classified and evaluated following the precepts and\nprocedures established and developed by our group over the last 15 years. The\ncomplete database contains over 6,700 Galactic objects including the many\nmimics and related phenomena previously mistaken or confused with PNe. Curation\nand updating currently occurs on a weekly basis to keep the repository as up to\ndate as possible until the official release of HASH v1 planned in the near\nfuture.\n", "  We developed a model for wind-blown bubbles with temperature and density\nprofiles based on self-similar solutions including thermal conduction. We\nconstructed also heat-conduction bubbles with chemical discontinuities. The\nX-ray emission is computed using the well-documented CHIANTI code (v6.0.1).\nThese bubble models are used to (re)analyse the high-resolution X-ray spectrum\nof the hot bubble of BD+30{\\deg}3639, and they appeared to be much superior to\nconstant temperature approaches.\n  We found for the X-ray emission of BD+30{\\deg}3639 that temperature-sensitive\nand abundance-sensitive line ratios computed on the basis of heat-conducting\nwind-blown bubbles and with abundances as found in the stellar photosphere/wind\ncan only be reconciled with the observations if the hot bubble of\nBD+30{\\deg}3639 is chemically stratified, i.e. if it contains also a small mass\nfraction ($\\simeq$ 3 %) of hydrogen-rich matter immediately behind the\nconduction front. Neon appears to be strongly enriched, with a mass fraction of\nat least about 0.06.\n", "  The Hong Kong/AAO/Strasbourg Halpha (HASH) planetary nebula database is an\nonline research platform providing free and easy access to the largest and most\ncomprehensive catalogue of known Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) and a\nrepository of observational data (imaging and spectroscopy) for these and\nrelated astronomical objects. The main motivation for creating this system is\nresolving some of long standing problems in the field e.g. problems with mimics\nand dubious and/or misidentifications, errors in observational data and\nconsolidation of the widely scattered data-sets. This facility allows\nresearchers quick and easy access to the archived and new observational data\nand creating and sharing of non-redundant PN samples and catalogues.\n", "  Determining the demographics of the Galactic planetary nebula (PN) population\nis an important goal to further our understanding of this intriguing phase of\nstellar evolution. The Galactic population has more than doubled in number over\nthe last 15 years, particularly from narrowband \\ha\\ surveys along the plane.\nIn this review I will summarise these results, with emphasis on the time\ninterval since the last IAU Symposium. These primarily optical surveys are not\nwithout their limitations and new surveys for PNe in the infrared similarly\nface a number of challenges. I will discuss the need for multi-wavelength\napproaches to discovery and analysis. The desire to have accurate\nvolume-limited samples of Galactic PNe at our disposal is emphasised, which\nwill be impacted with new data from the Gaia satellite mission. We need robust\nsurveys of PNe and their central stars, especially volume-limited surveys, in\norder to clarify and quantify their evolutionary pathways.\n", "  Recent work (Corradi et al. 2015, Jones et al. 2016) has shown that the\nphenomenon of extreme abundance discrepancies, where recombination line\nabundances exceed collisionally excited line abundances by factors of 10 or\nmore, seem to be strongly associated with planetary nebulae with close binary\ncentral stars. To further investigate, we have obtained spectra of a sample of\nnebulae with known close binary central stars, using FORS2 on the VLT, and we\nhave discovered several new extreme abundance discrepancy objects. We did not\nfind any non-extreme discrepancies, suggesting that a very high fraction of\nnebulae with close binary central stars also have an extreme abundance\ndiscrepancy.\n", "  We estimate differential rapidity cross sections for $J/\\Psi$, $\\Psi(2S)$,\n$\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(2S)$, and $\\Upsilon(3S)$ production via Pb-Pb\ncollisions at proton-proton energy $\\equiv \\sqrt{s_{pp}}$ =5.02 TeV. For the\n$\\Psi(2S)$, $\\Upsilon(3S)$ states we use the mixed heavy quark hyrid theory,\nwith these states being approximately 50\\% standard and 50\\% hybrid charmonium,\nbottomonium meson states. This is an extension of previous work on heavy quark\nstate production via Cu-Cu and Au-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{pp}}$=200 GeV.\n", "  The $^3$He isotope is important to many fields of astrophysics, including\nstellar evolution, chemical evolution, and cosmology. The isotope is produced\nin stars which evolve through the planetary nebula phase. Planetary nebulae are\nthe final evolutionary phase of low- and intermediate-mass stars, where the\nextensive mass lost by the star on the asymptotic giant branch is ionised by\nthe emerging white dwarf. This ejecta quickly disperses and merges with the\nsurrounding ISM. The abundance of $^3$He can only be derived from the hyperfine\ntransition of the ionised $^3$He, which is represented as $^3$He$^+$, these\ntransition can be observed in the radio at the rest frequency of 8.665 GHz.\n$^3$He abundances in PNe can help test models of the chemical evolution of the\nGalaxy. Many hours have been put into trying to detect this line, using\ntelescopes like Effelsberg a 100m dish from the Max Planck Institute for Radio\nAstronomy, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) 140-foot telescope,\nthe NRAO Very Large Array, the Arecibo antenna, the Green Bank Telescope, and\nonly just recently, the Deep Space Station 63 antenna from the Madrid Deep\nSpace Communications Complex.\n", "  We review the state of our chemical evolution models for spiral and low mass\ngalaxies. We analyze the consequences of using different stellar yields, infall\nrate laws and star formation prescriptions in the time/redshift evolution of\nthe radial distributions of abundances, and other quantities as star formation\nrate or gas densities, in the Milky Way Galaxy; In particular we will study the\nevolution of the Oxygen abundance radial gradient analyzing its relation with\nthe ratio SFR/infall. We also compare the results with our old chemical\nevolution models, cosmological simulations and with the existing data, mainly\nwith the planetary nebulae abundances.\n", "  One in 5 planetary nebulae are ejected from common envelope binary\ninteractions but Kepler Space Telescope results are already showing this\nproportion to be larger. Their properties, such as abundances can be starkly\ndifferent from those of the general population, so they should be considered\nseparately when using PN as chemical or population probes. Unfortunately\npost-common envelope PN cannot be discerned using only their morphologies, but\nthis will change once we couple our new common envelope simulations with PN\nformation models.\n", "  While most of the low-mass stars stay hydrogen-rich on their surface\nthroughout their evolution, a considerable fraction of white dwarfs as well as\ncentral stars of planetary nebulae have a hydrogen-deficient surface\ncomposition. The majority of these H-deficient central stars exhibit spectra\nvery similar to massive Wolf-Rayet stars of the carbon sequence, i.e. with\nbroad emission lines of carbon, helium, and oxygen. In analogy to the massive\nWolf-Rayet stars, they are classified as [WC] stars. Their formation, which is\nrelatively well understood, is thought to be the result of a (very) late\nthermal pulse of the helium burning shell.\n  It is therefore surprising that some H-deficient central stars which have\nbeen found recently, e.g. IC 4663 and Abell 48, exhibit spectra that resemble\nthose of the massive Wolf-Rayet stars of the nitrogen sequence, i.e. with\nstrong emission lines of nitrogen instead of carbon. This new type of central\nstars is therefore labelled [WN]. We present spectral analyses of these objects\nand discuss the status of further candidates as well as the evolutionary status\nand origin of the [WN] stars.\n", "  The understanding of astronomical nebulae is based on observational data\n(images, spectra, 3D data-cubes) and theoretical models. In this review, I\npresent my very biased view on photoionization modeling of planetary nebulae,\nfocusing on 1D multi-component models, on 3D models and on big database of\nmodels.\n", "  In this work, we obtain the Raychaudhuri equations for various types of\nFinsler spaces as the Finsler-Randers (FR) space-time and in a more general\ngeometrical structure of the space-time manifold which contains two fibres that\nare two scalars which represent inflaton fields $\\phi^{(1)}, \\phi^{(2)}.$In\naddition, the energy-conditions are studied in a FR cosmology and are\ncorrelated with FRW model. Finally an application of Raychaudhuri equation for\nthe model $M \\times \\{ \\phi^{(1)} \\} \\times \\{ \\phi^{(2)} \\}$ with M a FRW\nspace is given.\n", "  We measure pressure and entropy of ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical\nlattice for a range of interaction strengths, temperatures and fillings. Our\nmeasurements demonstrate that, for low enough temperatures, entropy-rich\nregions form locally in the metallic phase which are in contact with a\nMott-insulating phase featuring lower entropy. In addition, we also measure the\nreduced density matrix of a single lattice site, and from the comparison\nbetween the local and thermodynamic entropies we determine the mutual\ninformation between a single lattice site and the rest of the system. For low\nlattice fillings, we find the mutual information to be independent of\ninteraction strength, however, for half filling we find that strong\ninteractions suppress the correlations between a single site and the rest of\nthe system.\n", "  Gravitational wave searches to date have largely focused on non-precessing\nsystems. Including precession effects greatly increases the number of templates\nto be searched over. This leads to a corresponding increase in the\ncomputational cost and can increase the false alarm rate of a realistic search.\nOn the other hand, there might be astrophysical systems that are entirely\nmissed by non-precessing searches. In this paper we consider the problem of\nconstructing a template bank using stochastic methods for\nneutron-star--black-hole binaries allowing for precession, but with the\nrestrictions that the orientation of the total angular momentum of the binary\nis pointing towards the detector and that the neutron-star spin is negligible\nrelative to that of the black-hole. We quantify the number of templates\nrequired for the search, and we explicitly construct the template bank. We show\nthat despite the large number of templates, stochastic methods can be adapted\nto solve the problem. We quantify the parameter space region over which the\nnon-precessing search might miss signals.\n", "  We study the problem of transforming a tripartite pure state to a bipartite\none using stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). It\nis known that the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC convertibility is characterized\nby the maximal Schmidt rank of the given tripartite state, i.e. the largest\nSchmidt rank over those bipartite states lying in the support of the reduced\ndensity operator. In this paper, we further study this problem and exhibit\nnovel results in both multi-copy and asymptotic settings. In the multi-copy\nregime, we observe that the maximal Schmidt rank is strictly\nsuper-multiplicative, i.e. the maximal Schmidt rank of the tensor product of\ntwo tripartite pure states can be strictly larger than the product of their\nmaximal Schmidt ranks. We then provide a full characterization of those\ntripartite states whose maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative\nwhen taking tensor product with itself. In the asymptotic setting, we focus on\ndetermining the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC entanglement transformation rate,\nwhich turns out to be equivalent to computing the asymptotic maximal Schmidt\nrank of the tripartite state, defined as the regularization of its maximal\nSchmidt rank. Despite the difficulty caused by the super-multiplicative\nproperty, we provide explicit formulas for evaluating the asymptotic maximal\nSchmidt ranks of two important families of tripartite pure states, by resorting\nto certain results of the structure of matrix spaces, including the study of\nmatrix semi-invariants. These formulas give a sufficient and necessary\ncondition to determine whether a given tripartite pure state can be transformed\nto the bipartite maximally entangled state under SLOCC, in the asymptotic\nsetting. Applying the recent progress on the non-commutative rank problem, we\ncan verify this condition in deterministic polynomial time.\n", "  We have detected 13 new runaway-star candidates of spectral type O combining\nthe TGAS (Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution) proper motions from Gaia Data\nRelease 1 (DR1) and the sample from GOSSS (Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic\nSurvey). We have also combined TGAS and Hipparcos proper motions to check that\nour technique recovers many of the previously known O-type runaways in the\nsample.\n", "  Neutron(n)-capture elements are produced by s-process nucleosynthesis in low-\nand intermediate-mass AGB stars, and therefore can be enriched in planetary\nnebulae (PNe). In the last ten years, n-capture elements have been detected in\nmore than 100 PNe in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. In some objects,\nseveral different n-capture elements have been detected, providing valuable\nconstraints to models of AGB nucleosynthesis and evolution. These detections\nhave motivated theoretical and experimental investigations of the atomic data\nneeded to derive accurate n-capture element abundances. In this review, I\ndiscuss the methods and results of these atomic data studies, and their\napplication to abundance determinations in PNe.\n", "  A Lie-Hamilton system is a nonautonomous system of first-order ordinary\ndifferential equations describing the integral curves of a $t$-dependent vector\nfield taking values in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra, a Vessiot-Guldberg Lie\nalgebra, of Hamiltonian vector fields relative to a Poisson structure. Its\ngeneral solution can be written as an autonomous function, the superposition\nrule, of a generic finite family of particular solutions and a set of\nconstants. We pioneer the study of Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian spaces\n(sphere, Euclidean and hyperbolic plane), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de\nSitter, de Sitter, and Minkowski spacetimes) as well as on semi-Riemannian\nspaces (Newtonian spacetimes). Their corresponding constants of motion and\nsuperposition rules are obtained explicitly in a geometric way. This work\nextends the (graded) contraction of Lie algebras to a contraction procedure for\nLie algebras of vector fields, Hamiltonian functions, and related symplectic\nstructures, invariants, and superposition rules.\n", "  We present the results of our search for low- and intermediate mass evolved\nstars in the outer Galaxy using AllWISE catalogue photometry. We show that the\n[3.4]-[12] versus [4.6]-[22] colour-colour diagram is most suitable for\nseparating C-rich/O-rich AGB and post- AGB star candidates. We are able to\nselect 2,510 AGB and 24,821 post-AGB star candidates. However, the latter are\nseverely mixed with the known young stellar objects in this diagram.\n", "  The existence of significant anisotropies in the distributions of the\ndirections of perihelia and orbital poles of the known extreme trans-Neptunian\nobjects (ETNOs) has been used to claim that trans-Plutonian planets may exist.\nAmong the known ETNOs, the pair (474640) 2004 VN112-2013 RF98 stands out. Their\norbital poles and the directions of their perihelia and their velocities at\nperihelion/aphelion are separated by a few degrees, but orbital similarity does\nnot necessarily imply common physical origin. In an attempt to unravel their\nphysical nature, visible spectroscopy of both targets was obtained using the\nOSIRIS camera-spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). From\nthe spectral analysis, we find that 474640-2013 RF98 have similar spectral\nslopes (12 vs. 15 %/0.1um), very different from Sedna's but compatible with\nthose of (148209) 2000 CR105 and 2012 VP113. These five ETNOs belong to the\ngroup of seven linked to the Planet Nine hypothesis. A dynamical pathway\nconsistent with these findings is dissociation of a binary asteroid during a\nclose encounter with a planet and we confirm its plausibility using N-body\nsimulations. We thus conclude that both the dynamical and spectroscopic\nproperties of 474640-2013 RF98 favour a genetic link and their current orbits\nsuggest that the pair was kicked by a perturber near aphelion.\n", "  The separation of different kind of plastic particles is required in the\nprocess of waste recycling. For the separation drum processes passed through by\na liquid are applicable. Thereby the separation is based on the principle that\nparticles either sink or float in a liquid depending on their densities. In\nthis study the aforementioned process is numerically analysed for the\nseparation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from polypropylene (PP)\nparticles. The Discrete Element Method coupled with the Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics method (DEM-SPH) is used for modelling purposes. The employment\nof the SPH for the modelling of the liquid let us exploit the strong side of\nthis mesh-less method, namely, the relative easiness to model large movements\nof the fluid together with free surfaces and moving boundaries. The used\ntheoretical model is presented and validation tests are performed, where a\ndam-break problem is considered as an example. Simulations of the plastic\nparticle separation in the rotating drum are performed thereafter. The\ninfluence of the different operational and design parameters, such as the\nrotational velocity, the feed rate, the number of lifters etc., on the\nresultant purity of the plastic is estimated. It is expected that in the future\nthe performed analysis will allow to optimise drum separation processes.\n", "  Transition metal oxides are well known for their complex magnetic and\nelectrical properties. When brought together in heterostructure geometries,\nthey show particular promise for spintronics and colossal magnetoresistance\napplications. In this letter, we propose a new mechanism for the coupling\nbetween layers of itinerant ferromagnetic materials in heterostructures. The\ncoupling is mediated by charge carriers that strive to maximally delocalize\nthrough the heterostructure to gain kinetic energy. In doing so, they force a\nferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling between the constituent layers. To\nillustrate this, we focus on heterostructures composed of SrRuO$_3$ and\nLa$_{1-x}$A$_{x}$MnO$_3$ (A=Ca/Sr). Our mechanism is consistent with\nantiferromagnetic alignment that is known to occur in multilayers of\nSrRuO$_3$-La$_{1-x}$A$_{x}$MnO$_3$. To support our assertion, we present a\nminimal Kondo-lattice model which reproduces the known magnetization properties\nof such multilayers. In addition, we discuss a quantum well model for\nheterostructures and argue that the spin-dependent density of states determines\nthe nature of the coupling. As a smoking gun signature, we propose that\nbilayers with the same constituents will oscillate between ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic coupling upon tuning the relative thicknesses of the layers.\n", "  In this paper, we report a new type of instability of electron holes (EHs)\ninteracting with passing ions. The nonlinear interaction of EHs and ions is\ninvestigated using a new theory of hole kinematics. It is shown that the\noscillation in the velocity of the EH parallel to the magnetic field direction\nbecomes unstable when the hole velocity in the ion frame is slower than a few\ntimes the cold ion sound speed. This instability leads to the emission of\nion-acoustic waves from the solitary hole and decay in its magnitude. The\ninstability mechanism can drive significant perturbations in the ion density.\nThe instability threshold, oscillation frequency and instability growth rate\nderived from the theory yield quantitative agreement with the observations from\na novel high-fidelity hole-tracking Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code.\n", "  We study vortex patterns in a prototype nonlinear optical system:\ncounterpropagating laser beams in a photorefractive crystal, with or without\nthe background photonic lattice. The vortices are effectively planar and\ndescribed by the winding number and the \"flavor\" index, stemming from the fact\nthat we have two parallel beams propagating in opposite directions. The problem\nis amenable to the methods of statistical field theory and generalizes the\nBerezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of the XY model to the \"two-flavor\"\ncase. In addition to the familiar conductor and insulator phases, we also have\nthe perfect conductor (vortex proliferation in both beams/\"flavors\") and the\nfrustrated insulator (energy costs of vortex proliferation and vortex\nannihilation balance each other). In the presence of disorder in the background\nlattice, a novel phase appears which shows long-range correlations and absence\nof long-range order, thus being analogous to spin glasses. An important benefit\nof this approach is that qualitative behavior of patterns can be known without\nintensive numerical work over large areas of the parameter space. More\ngenerally, we would like to draw attention to connections between the\n(classical) pattern-forming systems in photorefractive optics and the methods\nof (quantum) condensed matter and field theory: on one hand, we use the\nfield-theoretical methods (renormalization group, replica formalism) to analyze\nthe patterns; on the other hand, the observed phases are analogous to those\nseen in magnetic systems, and make photorefractive optics a fruitful testing\nground for condensed matter systems. As an example, we map our system to a\ndoped $O(3)$ antiferromagnet with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ defects, which has the same\nstructure of the phase diagram.\n", "  An empirical relation indicates that an increase of living standard decreases\nthe Total Fertility Rate (TFR), but this trend was broken in highly developed\ncountries in 2005. The reversal of the TFR was associated with the continuous\neconomic and social development expressed by the Human Development Index (HDI).\nWe have investigated how universal and persistent the TFR reversal is. The\nresults show that in highly developed countries, $ \\mathrm{HDI}>0.85 $, the TFR\nand the HDI are not correlated in 2010-2014. Detailed analyses of correlations\nand differences of the TFR and the HDI indicate a decrease of the TFR if the\nHDI increases in this period. However, we found that a reversal of the TFR as a\nconsequence of economic development started at medium levels of the HDI, i.e. $\n0.575<\\mathrm{HDI}<0.85 $, in many countries. Our results show a transient\nnature of the TFR reversal in highly developed countries in 2010-2014 and a\nrelative stable trend of the TFR increase in medium developed countries in\nlonger time periods. We believe that knowledge of the fundamental nature of the\nTFR is very important for the survival of medium and highly developed\nsocieties.\n", "  This review presents the latest advances in the nebular studies of post-AGB\nobjects. Post-AGB stars are great tools to test nucleosynthesis and evolution\nmodels for stars of low and intermediate masses, and the evolution of dust in\nharsh environment. I will present the newly discovered class of post-RGB stars,\nformed via binary interaction on the RGB. Binary systems can also lead to the\nformation of two class of aspherical post-AGB, the Proto-Planetary Nebulae and\nthe naked post-AGBs (dusty RV Taus , a.k.a. Van Winckel's stars).\n", "  We use the Horizon Run 4 cosmological N -body simulation to study the effects\nof distant and close interactions on the alignments of the shapes, spins, and\norbits of targets haloes with their neighbours, and their dependence on the\nlocal density environment and neighbour separation. Interacting targets have a\nsignificantly lower spin and higher sphericity and oblateness than all targets.\nInteracting pairs initially have anti-parallel spins, but the spins develop\nparallel alignment as time goes on. Neighbours tend to evolve in the plane of\nrotation of the target, and in the direction of the major axis of prolate\nhaloes. Moreover, interactions are preferentially radial, while pairs with\nnon-radial orbits are preferentially prograde. The alignment signals are\nstronger at high-mass and for close separations, and independent on the\nlarge-scale density. Positive alignment signals are found at redshifts up to 4,\nand increase with decreasing redshifts. Moreover, the orbits tend to become\nprograde at low redshift, while no alignment is found at high redshift (z = 4).\n", "  In the outer Solar system, primordial Trojan asteroids may have remained\ndynamically stable for billions of years. Several thousands of them accompany\nJupiter in its journey around the Sun and a similarly large population may be\nhosted by Neptune. In addition, recently captured or transient Jovian and\nNeptunian Trojans are not uncommon. In contrast, no Trojans of Saturn have been\nfound yet and just one Uranian Trojan is known, 2011 QF99. Here, we discuss the\nidentification of a second Trojan of Uranus: 2014 YX49. Like 2011 QF99, 2014\nYX49 is a transient L4 Trojan although it orbits at higher inclination (25.55\ndegrees versus 10.83 degrees), is larger (absolute magnitude of 8.5 versus 9.7)\nand its libration period is slightly shorter (5.1 versus 5.9 kyr); contrary to\n2011 QF99, its discovery was not the result of a targeted survey. It is less\nstable than 2011 QF99; our extensive N-body simulations show that 2014 YX49 may\nhave been following a tadpole trajectory ahead of Uranus for about 60 kyr and\nit can continue doing so for another 80 kyr. Our analysis suggests that it may\nremain as co-orbital for nearly 1 Myr. As in the case of 2011 QF99, the\nlong-term stability of 2014 YX49 is controlled by Jupiter and Neptune, but it\nis currently trapped in the 7:20 mean motion resonance with Saturn.\nConsistently, the dynamical mechanism leading to the capture into and the\nejection from the Trojan state involves ephemeral multibody mean motion\nresonances.\n", "  Motzkin spin chains are frustration-free models whose ground-state is a\ncombination of Motzkin paths. The weight of such path contributions can be\ncontrolled by a deformation parameter t. As a function of the latter these\nmodels, beside the formation of domain wall structures, exhibit a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition for t=1 and gapped Haldane\ntopological orders with constant decay of the string order parameters for t <\n1. By means of numerical calculations we show that the topological properties\nof the Haldane phases depend on the spin value. This allows to classify\ndifferent kinds of hidden antiferromagnetic Haldane gapped regimes associated\nto nontrivial features like symmetry-protected topological order. Our results\nfrom one side allow to clarify the physical properties of Motzkin\nfrustration-free chains and from the other suggest them as a new interesting\nand paradigmatic class of local spin Hamiltonians.\n", "  It is well known that the addition of noise to a multistable dynamical system\ncan induce random transitions from one stable state to another. For low noise,\nthe times between transitions have an exponential tail and Kramers' formula\ngives an expression for the mean escape time in the asymptotic limit. If a\nnumber of multistable systems are coupled into a network structure, a\ntransition at one site may change the transition properties at other sites. We\nstudy the case of escape from a \"quiescent\" attractor to an \"active\" attractor\nin which transitions back can be ignored. There are qualitatively different\nregimes of transition, depending on coupling strength. For small coupling\nstrengths the transition rates are simply modified but the transitions remain\nstochastic. For large coupling strengths transitions happen approximately in\nsynchrony - we call this a \"fast domino\" regime. There is also an intermediate\ncoupling regime some transitions happen inexorably but with a delay that may be\narbitrarily long - we call this a \"slow domino\" regime. We characterise these\nregimes in the low noise limit in terms of bifurcations of the potential\nlandscape of a coupled system. We demonstrate the effect of the coupling on the\ndistribution of timings and (in general) the sequences of escapes of the\nsystem.\n", "  This article presents an overview of the published results for planetary\nnebulae based on images and spectroscopy from the PACS, SPIRE, and HIFI\ninstruments on board the Herschel satellite.\n", "  V4334 Sgr (a.k.a. Sakurai's object) is the central star of an old planetary\nnebula that underwent a very late thermal pulse a few years before its\ndiscovery in 1996. We have been monitoring the evolution of the optical\nemission line spectrum since 2001. The goal is to improve the evolutionary\nmodels by constraining them with the temporal evolution of the central star\ntemperature. In addition the high resolution spectral observations obtained by\nX-shooter and ALMA show the temporal evolution of the different morphological\ncomponents.\n", "  Thanks to incredible advances in instrumentation, surveys like the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey have been able to find and catalog billions of objects,\nranging from local M dwarfs to distant quasars. Machine learning algorithms\nhave greatly aided in the effort to classify these objects; however, there are\nregimes where these algorithms fail, where interesting oddities may be found.\nWe present here an X-ray bright quasar misidentified as a red supergiant/X-ray\nbinary, and a subsequent search of the SDSS quasar catalog for X-ray bright\nstars misidentified as quasars.\n", "  Reliable and energy efficient magnetization switching by electrically-induced\nspin-orbit torques is of crucial technological relevance for spintronic devices\nimplementing memory and logic functionality. Here we predict that the strength\nof spin-orbit torques and the related Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in\ntopologically non-trivial magnetic insulators can exceed by far that of\nconventional metallic magnets. In analogy to the quantum anomalous Hall effect,\nwe explain this extraordinary response in absence of longitudinal currents as a\nhallmark of magnetic monopoles in the electronic structure of systems that are\ninterpreted most naturally within the framework of mixed Weyl semimetals. We\nthereby launch the effect of spin-orbit torque into the field of topology and\nreveal its crucial role in mediating the topological phase transitions arising\ndue to the complex interplay between magnetization direction and momentum-space\ntopology. The concepts presented here may be exploited to understand and\nutilize magneto-electric coupling phenomena in insulating ferromagnets and\nantiferromagnets.\n", "  As part of a multi-year survey for Wolf-Rayet stars in the Magellanic Clouds,\nwe have discovered a new type of Wolf-Rayet star with both strong emission and\nabsorption. While one might initially classify these stars as WN3+O3V binaries\nbased on their spectra, such a pairing is unlikely given their faint visual\nmagnitudes. Spectral modeling suggests effective temperatures and bolometric\nluminosities similar to those of other early-type LMC WNs but with mass-loss\nrates that are three to five times lower than expected. They additionally\nretain a significant amount of hydrogen, with nitrogen at its CNO-equilibrium\nvalue (10x enhanced). Their evolutionary status remains an open question. Here\nwe discuss why these stars did not evolve through quasi-homogeneous evolution.\nInstead we suggest that based on a link with long-duration gamma ray bursts,\nthey may form in lower metallicity environments. A new survey in M33, which has\na large metallicity gradient, is underway.\n", "  We establish the Haag-Kastler axioms for a class of models on the\ntwo-dimensional de Sitter space, including the ${\\mathscr P} (\\varphi)_2$\nmodel.\n", "  We have realized encapsulated trilayer MoS$_2$ devices with gated graphene\ncontacts. In the bulk, we observe an electron mobility as high as\n7000~cm$^{2}$/(V s) at a density of 3 $\\times$ 10$^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$ at a\ntemperature of 1.9~K. Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations start at magnetic fields\nas low as 0.9~T. The observed 3-fold Landau level degeneracy can be understood\nbased on the valley Zeeman effect. Negatively biased split gate electrodes\nallow us to form a channel that can be completely pinched off for sufficiently\nlarge gate voltages. The measured conductance displays plateau-like features.\n", "  Binary stars can interact via mass transfer when one member (the primary)\nascends onto a giant branch. The amount of gas ejected by the binary and the\namount of gas accreted by the secondary over the lifetime of the primary\ninfluence the subsequent binary phenomenology. Some of the gas ejected by the\nbinary will remain gravitationally bound and its distribution will be closely\nrelated to the formation of planetary nebulae. We investigate the nature of\nmass transfer in binary systems containing an AGB star by adding radiative\ntransfer to the AstroBEAR AMR Hydro/MHD code.\n", "  We summarize here recent work in identifying and characterizing red\nsupergiants (RSGs) in the galaxies of the Local Group.\n", "  Graphene has emerged as a promising building block in the modern optics and\noptoelectronics due to its novel optical and electrical properties. In the\nmid-infrared and terahertz (THz) regime, graphene behaves like metals and\nsupports surface plasmon resonances (SPRs). Moreover, the continuously tunable\nconductivity of graphene enables active SPRs and gives rise to a range of\nactive applications. However, the interaction between graphene and metal-based\nresonant metamaterials has not been fully understood. In this work, a\nsimulation investigation on the interaction between the graphene layer and THz\nresonances supported by the two-gap split ring metamaterials is systematically\nconducted. The simulation results show that the graphene layer can\nsubstantially reduce the Fano resonance and even switch it off, while leave the\ndipole resonance nearly unaffected, which phenomenon is well explained with the\nhigh conductivity of graphene. With the manipulation of graphene conductivity\nvia altering its Fermi energy or layer number, the amplitude of the Fano\nresonance can be modulated. The tunable Fano resonance here together with the\nunderlying physical mechanism can be strategically important in designing\nactive metal-graphene hybrid metamaterials. In addition, the \"sensitivity\" to\nthe graphene layer of the Fano resonance is also highly appreciated in the\nfield of ultrasensitive sensing, where the novel physical mechanism can be\nemployed in sensing other graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) materials or\nbiomolecules with the high conductivity.\n", "  The rapid progress in quantum technology enables the implementation of\nartificial many-body systems with correlated photons and polaritons. A\nmulticonnected Jaynes-Cummings (MCJC) lattice can be constructed by connecting\nqubits and cavities alternatively. Such kind of models can be realized with\nsuperconducting qubits coupled to superconducting microwave resonators or with\nquantum dots coupled to optical nanocavities. We study physical properties of\nthe one-dimensional MCJC lattice using the density-matrix renormalization group\nmethod. This model has an intrinsic symmetry between the left and right\nqubit-cavity couplings. The competition between these couplings may drive the\nground state either to a Mott-insulating or to a superfluid phase at an integer\nfilling. We calculate the single-particle and density-density correlation\nfunctions, the correlation lengths in the Mott-insulating phase and the\nLuttinger parameters in the superfluid phase, and determine accurately the\ncritical points that separate these two phases.\n", "  We investigate the observational constraints on an interacting vacuum energy\nscenario with two different neutrino schemes (with and without a sterile\nneutrino) using the most recent data from CMB temperature and polarization\nanisotropy, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), type Ia supernovae from JLA\nsample and structure growth inferred from cluster counts. We find that\ninclusion of the galaxy clusters data with the minimal data combination CMB +\nBAO + JLA suggests an interaction in the dark sector, implying the decay of\ndark matter particles into dark energy, since the constraints obtained by\nincluding the galaxy clusters data yield a non-null and negative coupling\nparameter between the dark components at 99\\% confidence level. We deduce that\nthe current tensions on the parameters $H_0$ and $\\sigma_8$ can be alleviated\nwithin the framework of the interacting as well as non-interacting vacuum\nenergy models with sterile neutrinos.\n", "  Nuclear recoil backgrounds are one of the most dangerous backgrounds for many\ndark matter experiments. A primary source of nuclear recoils is radiogenic\nneutrons produced in the detector material itself. These neutrons result from\nfission and $(\\alpha,n)$ reactions originating from uranium and thorium\ncontamination. In this paper, we discuss neutron yields from these sources. We\ncompile a list of $(\\alpha,n)$ yields for many materials common in\nlow-background detectors, calculated using NeuCBOT, a new tool introduced in\nthis paper, available at https://github.com/shawest/neucbot. These calculations\nare compared to computations made using data compilations and SOURCES-4A\n", "  As the size of quantum systems becomes bigger, more complicated hardware is\nrequired to control these systems. In order to reduce the complexity, I discuss\nthe amount of parallelism required for a fault-tolerant quantum computer and\nwhat computation speed can be achieved in different architectures. To build a\nlarge-scale quantum computer, one can use architectural principles, from\nclassical computer architecture, like multiplexing or pipelining. In this\ndocument, a Quantum von Neumann architecture is introduced which uses\nspecialized hardware for the different tasks of a quantum computer, like\ncomputation or storage. Furthermore, it requires long qubit coherence and the\ncapability to move quantum information between the different parts of the\nquantum computer. As an example, a Quantum von Neumann architecture for trapped\nions is presented which incorporates multiplexing in the memory region for\nlarge-scale quantum computation. To illustrate the capability of this\narchitecture, a model trapped ion quantum computer based on Quantum von Neumann\narchitecture, the Quantum 4004, is introduced. Its hardware is optimized for\nsimplicity and uses the classical Intel 4004 CPU from 1971 as a blueprint. The\nQuantum 4004 has only a single processing zone and is structured in 4 qubit\npackages. Its quantum memory can store up to 32768 qubit ions and its\ncomputation speed is 10 $\\mu$s for single qubit operations and 20 $\\mu$s for\ntwo-qubit operations.\n", "  Quantum technologies can be presented to the public with or without\nintroducing a strange trait of quantum theory responsible for their\nnon-classical efficiency. Traditionally the message was centered on the\nsuperposition principle, while entanglement and properties such as\ncontextuality have been gaining ground recently. A less theoretical approach is\nfocused on simple protocols that enable technological applications. It results\nin a pragmatic narrative built with the help of the resource paradigm and\nprinciple-based reconstructions. I discuss the advantages and weaknesses of\nthese methods. To illustrate the importance of new metaphors beyond the\nSchr\\\"odinger cat, I briefly describe a non-mathematical narrative about\nentanglement that conveys an idea of some of its unusual properties. If quantum\ntechnologists are to succeed in building trust in their work, they ought to\nprovoke an aesthetic perception in the public commensurable with the\nmathematical beauty of quantum theory experienced by the physicist. The power\nof the narrative method lies in its capacity to do so.\n", "  We present VLT/MUSE observations of NGC 2070, the dominant ionizing nebula of\n30 Doradus in the LMC, plus HST/STIS spectroscopy of its central star cluster\nR136. Integral Field Spectroscopy (MUSE) and pseudo IFS (STIS) together\nprovides a complete census of all massive stars within the central 30x30\nparsec^2 of the Tarantula. We discuss the integrated far-UV spectrum of R136,\nof particular interest for UV studies of young extragalactic star clusters.\nStrong HeII 1640 emission at very early ages (1-2 Myr) from very massive stars\ncannot be reproduced by current population synthesis models, even those\nincorporating binary evolution and very massive stars. A nebular analysis of\nthe integrated MUSE dataset implies an age of ~4.5 Myr for NGC 2070. Wolf-Rayet\nfeatures provide alternative age diagnostics, with the primary contribution to\nthe integrated Wolf-Rayet bumps arising from R140 rather than the more numerous\nH-rich WN stars in R136. Caution should be used when interpreting spatially\nextended observations of extragalactic star-forming regions.\n", "  This paper provides a brief look at dynamo scaling relationships for the\ndegree of equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies. Two simple\nmodels are examined, where one that assumes magnetostrophy and another that\nincludes the effects of inertia. These models are then compared to a suite of\nconvective dynamo simulations of the convective core of a main-sequence B-type\nstar and applied to its later evolutionary stages.\n", "  Large-scale dipolar surface magnetic fields have been detected in a fraction\nof OB stars, however only few stellar evolution models of massive stars have\nconsidered the impact of these fossil fields. We are performing 1D\nhydrodynamical model calculations taking into account evolutionary consequences\nof the magnetospheric-wind interactions in a simplified parametric way. Two\neffects are considered: i) the global mass-loss rates are reduced due to\nmass-loss quenching, and ii) the surface angular momentum loss is enhanced due\nto magnetic braking. As a result of the magnetic mass-loss quenching, the mass\nof magnetic massive stars remains close to their initial masses. Thus magnetic\nmassive stars - even at Galactic metallicity - have the potential to be\nprogenitors of `heavy' stellar mass black holes. Similarly, at Galactic\nmetallicity, the formation of pair instability supernovae is plausible with a\nmagnetic progenitor.\n", "  With red supergiants (RSGs) predicted to end their lives as Type IIP core\ncollapse supernova (CCSN), their behaviour before explosion needs to be fully\nunderstood. Mass loss rates govern RSG evolution towards SN and have strong\nimplications on the appearance of the resulting explosion. To study how the\nmass-loss rates change with the evolution of the star, we have measured the\namount of circumstellar material around 19 RSGs in a coeval cluster. Our study\nhas shown that mass loss rates ramp up throughout the lifetime of an RSG, with\nmore evolved stars having mass loss rates a factor of 40 higher than early\nstage RSGs. Interestingly, we have also found evidence for an increase in\ncircumstellar extinction throughout the RSG lifetime, meaning the most evolved\nstars are most severely affected. We find that, were the most evolved RSGs in\nNGC2100 to go SN, this extra extinction would cause the progenitor's initial\nmass to be underestimated by up to 9M$_\\odot$.\n", "  The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts a large number of high-mass X-ray\nbinaries, and in particular of Be/X-ray Binaries (BeXRBs; neutron stars\norbiting OBe-type stars), offering a unique laboratory to address the effect of\nmetalicity. One key property of their optical companion is H{\\alpha} in\nemission, which makes them bright sources when observed through a narrow-band\nH{\\alpha} filter. We performed a survey of the SMC Bar and Wing regions using\nwide-field cameras (WFI@MPG/ESO and MOSAIC@CTIO/Blanco) in order to identify\nthe counterparts of the sources detected in our XMM-Newton survey of the same\narea. We obtained broad-band R and narrow-band H{\\alpha} photometry, and\nidentified ~10000 H{\\alpha} emission sources down to a sensitivity limit of\n18.7 mag (equivalent to ~B8 type Main Sequence stars). We find the fraction of\nOBe/OB stars to be 13% down to this limit, and by investigating this fraction\nas a function of the brightness of the stars we deduce that H{\\alpha} excess\npeaks at the O9-B2 spectral range. Using the most up-to-date numbers of SMC\nBeXRBs we find their fraction over their parent population to be ~0.002-0.025\nBeXRBs/OBe, a direct measurement of their formation rate.\n", "  In the last decades, stellar atmosphere models have become a key tool in\nunderstanding massive stars. Applied for spectroscopic analysis, these models\nprovide quantitative information on stellar wind properties as well as\nfundamental stellar parameters. The intricate non-LTE conditions in stellar\nwinds dictate the development of adequate sophisticated model atmosphere codes.\nThe increase in both, the computational power and our understanding of physical\nprocesses in stellar atmospheres, led to an increasing complexity in the\nmodels. As a result, codes emerged that can tackle a wide range of stellar and\nwind parameters. After a brief address of the fundamentals of stellar\natmosphere modeling, the current stage of clumped and line-blanketed model\natmospheres will be discussed. Finally, the path for the next generation of\nstellar atmosphere models will be outlined. Apart from discussing\nmultidimensional approaches, I will emphasize on the coupling of hydrodynamics\nwith a sophisticated treatment of the radiative transfer. This next generation\nof models will be able to predict wind parameters from first principles, which\ncould open new doors for our understanding of the various facets of massive\nstar physics, evolution, and death.\n", "  Observations with powerful X-ray telescopes, such as XMM-Newton and Chandra,\nsignificantly advance our understanding of massive stars. Nearly all early-type\nstars are X-ray sources. Studies of their X-ray emission provide important\ndiagnostics of stellar winds. High-resolution X-ray spectra of O-type stars are\nwell explained when stellar wind clumping is taking into account, providing\nfurther support to a modern picture of stellar winds as non-stationary,\ninhomogeneous outflows. X-ray variability is detected from such winds, on time\nscales likely associated with stellar rotation. High-resolution X-ray\nspectroscopy indicates that the winds of late O-type stars are predominantly in\na hot phase. Consequently, X-rays provide the best observational window to\nstudy these winds. X-ray spectroscopy of evolved, Wolf-Rayet type, stars allows\nto probe their powerful metal enhanced winds, while the mechanisms responsible\nfor the X-ray emission of these stars are not yet understood.\n", "  The recent discovery of a gravitational wave from the merging of two black\nholes of about 30 solar masses each challenges our incomplete understanding of\nmassive stars and their evolution. Critical ingredients comprise mass-loss,\nrotation, magnetic fields, internal mixing, and mass transfer in close binary\nsystems. The imperfect knowledge of these factors implies large uncertainties\nfor models of stellar populations and their feedback. In this contribution we\nsummarize our empirical studies of Wolf-Rayet populations at different\nmetallicities by means of modern non-LTE stellar atmosphere models, and\nconfront these results with the predictions of stellar evolution models. At the\nmetallicity of our Galaxy, stellar winds are probably too strong to leave\nremnant masses as high as 30 solar masses, but given the still poor agreement\nbetween evolutionary tracks and observation even this conclusion is debatable.\nAt the low metallicity of the Small Magellanic Cloud, all WN stars which are\n(at least now) single are consistent with evolving quasi-homogeneously. O and\nB-type stars, in contrast, seem to comply with standard evolutionary models\nwithout strong internal mixing. Close binaries which avoided early merging\ncould evolve quasi-homogeneously and lead to close compact remnants of\nrelatively high masses that merge within a Hubble time.\n", "  The main focus of this article is to obtain various transport coefficients\nfor a hot QCD medium that is produced while colliding two heavy nuclei\nultra-relativistically. As the hot QCD medium follows dissipative hydrodynamics\nwhile undergoing space-time evolution, the knowledge of the transport\ncoefficients such as thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, shear and\nbulk viscosities are essential to understand the underlying physics there. The\napproach adopted here is semi-classical transport theory. The determination of\nall these transport coefficients requires knowledge of the medium away from\nequilibrium. In this context, we setup the linearized transport equation\nemploying the Chapman-Enskog technique from kinetic theory of many particle\nsystem with a collision term that includes the binary collisions of\nquarks/antiquarks and gluons. In order to include the effects of a strongly\ninteracting, thermal medium, a quasi-particle description of realistic hot QCD\nequation of state has been employed through the equilibrium modeling of the\nmomentum distributions of gluons and quarks with non-trivial dispersion\nrelations while extending the model for finite but small quark chemical\npotential. The effective coupling for strong interaction has been redefined\nfollowing the charge renormalization under the scheme of the quasiparticle\nmodel. The consolidated effects on transport coefficients are seen to have\nsignificant impact on their temperature dependence. The relative significances\nof momentum and heat transfer as well as charge diffusion processes in hot QCD\nhave been investigated by studying the ratios of the respective transport\ncoefficients.\n", "  Blue supergiant stars of B and A spectral types are amongst the visually\nbrightest non-transient astronomical objects. Their intrinsic brightness makes\nit possible to obtain high quality optical spectra of these objects in distant\ngalaxies, enabling the study not only of these stars in different environments,\nbut also to use them as tools to probe their host galaxies. Quantitative\nanalysis of their optical spectra provide tight constraints on their evolution\nin a wide range of metallicities, as well as on the present-day chemical\ncomposition, extinction laws and distances to their host galaxies. We review in\nthis contribution recent results in this field.\n", "  Strong winds from massive stars are a topic of interest to a wide range of\nastrophysical fields. In High-Mass X-ray Binaries the presence of an accreting\ncompact object on the one side allows to infer wind parameters from studies of\nthe varying properties of the emitted X-rays; but on the other side the\naccretor's gravity and ionizing radiation can strongly influence the wind flow.\nBased on a collaborative effort of astronomers both from the stellar wind and\nthe X-ray community, this presentation attempts to review our current state of\nknowledge and indicate avenues for future progress.\n", "  Astrophysical compact binary systems consisting of neutron stars and\nblackholes are an important class of gravitational wave (GW) sources for\nadvanced LIGO detectors. Accurate theoretical waveform models from the\ninspiral, merger and ringdown phases of such systems, are used to filter\ndetector data under the template based matched filtering paradigm. An efficient\ngrid over the parameter space at a fixed minimal match has a direct impact on\nthe overall time taken by these searches. We present a new hybrid\ngeometric-random template placement algorithm for signals described by two\nmasses and one spin magnitude parameters. Such template banks could potentially\nbe used in GW searches from binary neutron stars and neutron star-blackhole\nsystems. The template placement is robust and is able to automatically\naccommodate curvature and boundary effects with no fine tuning. We also compare\nthese banks against vanilla-stochastic template banks and show that while both\nare equally efficient in the fitting-factor sense, the bank sizes are $\\sim 25\n\\%$ larger in the stochastic method. Further, we show that the generation of\nthe proposed hybrid banks can be sped-up by nearly an order of magnitude over\nthe stochastic bank. Generic issues related to optimal implementation are\ndiscussed in detail. These improvements are expected to directly reduce the\ncomputational cost of gravitational wave searches.\n", "  Over the last decade, tremendous strides have been achieved in our\nunderstanding of magnetism in main sequence hot stars. In particular, the\nstatistical occurrence of their surface magnetism has been established (~10%)\nand the field origin is now understood to be fossil. However, fundamental\nquestions remain: how do these fossil fields evolve during the post-main\nsequence phases, and how do they influence the evolution of hot stars from the\nmain sequence to their ultimate demise? Filling the void of known magnetic\nevolved hot (OBA) stars, studying the evolution of their fossil magnetic fields\nalong stellar evolution, and understanding the impact of these fields on the\nangular momentum, rotation, mass loss, and evolution of the star itself, is\ncrucial to answering these questions, with far reaching consequences, in\nparticular for the properties of the precursors of supernovae explosions and\nstellar remnants. In the framework of the BRITE spectropolarimetric survey and\nLIFE project, we have discovered the first few magnetic hot supergiants. Their\nlongitudinal surface magnetic field is very weak but their configuration\nresembles those of main sequence hot stars. We present these first\nobservational results and propose to interpret them at first order in the\ncontext of magnetic flux conservation as the radius of the star expands with\nevolution. We then also consider the possible impact of stellar structure\nchanges along evolution.\n", "  The explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae is a long-standing\nproblem in stellar astrophysics. We briefly outline the main contenders for a\nsolution and review recent efforts to model core-collapse supernova explosions\nby means of multi-dimensional simulations. We discuss several suggestions for\nsolving the problem of missing or delayed neutrino-driven explosions in\nthree-dimensional supernova models, including -- among others -- variations in\nthe microphysics and large seed perturbations in convective burning shells.\nFocusing on the neutrino-driven mechanism, we summarise currents efforts to\npredict supernova explosion and remnant properties based on first-principle\nmodels and on more phenomenological approaches.\n", "  Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) can be accelerated by tidal disruption\nevents of stars by black holes. We suggest a novel mechanism for UHECR\nacceleration wherein white dwarfs (WDs) are tidally compressed by\nintermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), leading to their ignition and subsequent\nexplosion as a supernova. Cosmic rays accelerated by the supernova may receive\nan energy boost when crossing the accretion-powered jet. The rate of encounters\nbetween WDs and IMBHs can be relatively high, as the number of IMBHs may be\nsubstantially augmented once account is taken of their likely presence in dwarf\ngalaxies. Here we show that this kind of tidal disruption event naturally\nprovides an intermediate composition for the observed UHECRs, and suggest that\ndwarf galaxies and globular clusters are suitable sites for particle\nacceleration to ultra-high energies.\n", "  We theoretically investigate superfluidity in a strongly interacting Fermi\ngas confined to two dimensions at finite temperature. Using a Gaussian pair\nfluctuation theory in the superfluid phase, we calculate the superfluid density\nand determine the critical temperature and chemical potential at the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We propose that the transition can\nbe unambiguously demonstrated in cold-atom experiments by stirring the\nsuperfluid Fermi gas using a red detuned laser beam, to identify the\ncharacteristic jump in the local Landau critical velocity at the\nsuperfluid-normal interface, as the laser beam moves across the cloud.\n", "  We explore the collective electronic excitations of bilayer molybdenum\ndisulfide (MoS$_2$) using the density functional theory together with the\nrandom phase approximation. The many-body dielectric function and electron\nenergy-loss spectra are calculated using an {\\it ab initio} based model\ninvolving material-realistic physical properties. The electron energy-loss\nfunction of bilayer MoS$_2$ system is found to be sensitive to either electron\nor hole doping and it is owing to the fact that the Kohn-Sham band dispersions\nare not symmetric for energies above and below the zero Fermi level. Three\nplasmon modes are predicted. A damped high-energy mode, one optical mode\n(in-phase mode) for which the plasmon dispersion exhibits $\\sqrt q $ in the\nlong wavelength limit originating from low-energy electron scattering and\nfinally a highly damped acoustic mode (out-of-phase mode).\n", "  Observations of star-forming galaxies in the distant Universe (z > 2) are\nstarting to confirm the importance of massive stars in shaping galaxy emission\nand evolution. Inevitably, these distant stellar populations are unresolved,\nand the limited data available must be interpreted in the context of stellar\npopulation synthesis models. With the imminent launch of JWST and the prospect\nof spectral observations of galaxies within a gigayear of the Big Bang, the\nuncertainties in modelling of massive stars are becoming increasingly important\nto our interpretation of the high redshift Universe. In turn, these\nobservations of distant stellar populations will provide ever stronger tests\nagainst which to gauge the success of, and flaws in, current massive star\nmodels.\n", "  Possible formation mechanisms of massive close binary black holes that can\nmerge in the Hubble time to produce powerful gravitational wave bursts detected\nduring advanced LIGO O1 science run are briefly discussed. The pathways include\nthe evolution from field low-metallicity massive binaries, the dynamical\nformation in globular clusters and primordial black holes. Low effective black\nhole spins inferred for LIGO GW150914 and LTV151012 events are discussed.\nPopulation synthesis calculations of the expected spin and chirp mass\ndistributions from the standard field massive binary formation channel are\npresented for different metallicities (from zero-metal Population III stars up\nto solar metal abundance). We conclude that that merging binary black holes can\ncontain systems from different formation channels, discrimination between which\ncan be made with increasing statistics of mass and spin measurements from\nongoing and future gravitational wave observations.\n", "  Using thermodynamic measurements, neutron diffraction, nuclear magnetic\nresonance, and muon spin relaxation, we establish putative quantum spin-liquid\nbehavior in Ba$_3$InIr$_2$O$_9$, where unpaired electrons are localized on\nmixed-valence Ir$_2$O$_9$ dimers with Ir$^{4.5+}$ ions. Despite the\nantiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature on the order of 10 K, neither\nlong-range magnetic order nor spin freezing are observed down to at least 20\nmK, such that spins are short-range correlated and dynamic over nearly three\ndecades in temperature. Quadratic power-law behavior of both the spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate and specific heat indicates the gapless nature of the ground\nstate. We envisage that this exotic behavior may be related to an unprecedented\ncombination of the triangular and buckled honeycomb geometries of\nnearest-neighbor exchange couplings in the mixed-valence setting.\n", "  Magnetic massive stars comprise approximately 10% of the total OB star\npopulation. Modern spectropolarimetry shows these stars host strong, stable,\nlarge-scale, often nearly dipolar surface magnetic fields of 1 kG or more.\nThese global magnetic fields trap and deflect outflowing stellar wind material,\nforming an anisotropic magnetosphere that can be probed with wind-sensitive UV\nresonance lines. Recent HST UV spectra of NGC 1624-2, the most magnetic O star\nobserved to date, show atypically unsaturated P-Cygni profiles in the Civ\nresonant doublet, as well as a distinct variation with rotational phase. We\nexamine the effect of non-radial, magnetically-channeled wind outflow on\nP-Cygni line formation, using a Sobolev Exact Integration (SEI) approach for\ndirect comparison with HST UV spectra of NGC 1624-2. We demonstrate that the\naddition of a magnetic field desaturates the absorption trough of the P-Cygni\nprofiles, but further efforts are needed to fully account for the observed line\nprofile variation. Our study thus provides a first step toward a broader\nunderstanding of how strong magnetic fields affect mass loss diagnostics from\nUV lines.\n", "  We revisit the so-called \"Geodesic Witten Diagrams\" (GWDs) \\cite{ScalarGWD},\nproposed to be the holographic dual configuration of scalar conformal partial\nwaves, from the perspectives of CFT operator product expansions. To this end,\nwe explicitly consider three point GWDs which are natural building blocks of\nall possible four point GWDs, discuss their gluing procedure through\nintegration over spectral parameter, and this leads us to a direct\nidentification with the integral representation of CFT conformal partial waves.\nAs a main application of this general construction, we consider the holographic\ndual of the conformal partial waves for external primary operators with spins.\nMoreover, we consider the closely related \"split representation\" for the bulk\nto bulk spinning propagator, to demonstrate how ordinary scalar Witten diagram\nwith arbitrary spin exchange, can be systematically decomposed into scalar\nGWDs. We also discuss how to generalize to spinning cases.\n", "  Verlinde derived gravity as an emergent force from the information flow,\nthrough two-dimensional surfaces and recently, by a priori postulating the\nentanglement of information in 3D space, he derived the effect of the\ngravitational potential from dark matter (DM) as the entropy displacement of\ndark energy by baryonic matter. In Emergent Gravity (EG) this apparent DM\ndepends only on the baryonic mass distribution and the present-day value of the\nHubble parameter. In this paper we test the EG proposition, formalized by\nVerlinde for a spherical and isolated mass distribution, using the central\nvelocity dispersion, $\\sigma$ and the light distribution in a sample of 4260\nmassive and local early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the SPIDER sample. Our\nresults remain unaltered if we consider the sample of 807 roundest field\ngalaxies. We derive the predictions by EG for the stellar mass-to-light ratio\n(M/L) and the Initial Mass Function (IMF), and compare them with the same\ninferences derived from a) DM-based models, b) MOND and c) stellar population\nmodels. We demonstrate that, consistently with a classical Newtonian framework\nwith a DM halo component, or alternative theories of gravity as MOND, the\ncentral dynamics can be fitted if the IMF is assumed non-universal. The results\ncan be interpreted with a IMF lighter than a standard Chabrier at low-$\\sigma$,\nand bottom-heavier IMFs at larger $\\sigma$. We find lower, but still\nacceptable, stellar M/L in EG theory, if compared with the DM-based NFW model\nand with MOND. The results from EG are comparable to what is found if the DM\nhaloes are adiabatically contracted and with expectations from spectral\ngravity-sensitive features. If the strain caused by the entropy displacement\nwould be not maximal, as adopted in the current formulation, then the dynamics\nof ETGs could be reproduced with larger M/L. (abridged)\n", "  The double distance and metallicity frontier marked by the SMC has been\nfinally broken with the aid of powerful multi-object spectrographs installed at\n8-10m class telescopes. VLT, GTC and Keck have enabled studies of massive stars\nin dwarf irregular galaxies of the Local Group with poorer metal content than\nthe SMC. The community is working to test the predictions of evolutionary\nmodels in the low-metallicity regime, set the new standard for the metal-poor\nhigh-redshift Universe, and test the extrapolation of the physics of massive\nstars to environments of decreasing metallicity. In this paper, we review\ncurrent knowledge on this topic.\n", "  In this paper an explicit cosmological model which allows cosmological\nsingularities are discussed. The generalized power-law and asymptotic\nexpansions of the baro-tropic fluid index $\\omega$ and equivalently the\ndeceleration parameter $q$, in terms of cosmic time $'t'$ are considered.\nFinally, the strength of the found singularities is discussed.\n", "  State measurement of a quantum harmonic oscillator is essential in quantum\noptics and quantum information processing. In a system of trapped ions, we\nexperimentally demonstrate the projective measurement of the state of the ions'\nmotional mode via an effective cross-Kerr coupling to another motional mode.\nThis coupling is induced by the intrinsic nonlinearity of the Coulomb\ninteraction between the ions. We spectroscopically resolve the frequency shift\nof the motional sideband of the first mode due to presence of single phonons in\nthe second mode and use it to reconstruct the phonon number distribution of the\nsecond mode.\n", "  Planetary nebulae retain the signature of the nucleosynthesis and mixing\nevents that occurred during the previous AGB phase. Observational signatures\ncomplement observations of AGB and post-AGB stars and their binary companions.\nThe abundances of the elements heavier than iron such as Kr and Xe in planetary\nnebulae can be used to complement abundances of Sr/Y/Zr and Ba/La/Ce in AGB\nstars, respectively, to determine the operation of the slow neutron-capture\nprocess (the s process) in AGB stars. Additionally, observations of the Rb\nabundance in Type I planetary nebulae may allow us to infer the initial mass of\nthe central star. Several noble gas components present in meteoritic stardust\nsilicon carbide (SiC) grains are associated with implantation into the dust\ngrains in the high-energy environment connected to the fast winds from the\ncentral stars during the planetary nebulae phase.\n", "  A thorough account of electromagnetic interactions of massive neutrinos in\nthe theoretical formulation of low-energy elastic neutrino-electron scattering\nis given. The formalism of neutrino charge, magnetic, electric, and anapole\nform factors defined as matrices in the mass basis is employed under the\nassumption of three-neutrino mixing. The flavor change of neutrinos traveling\nfrom the source to the detector is taken into account and the role of the\nsource-detector distance is inspected. The effects of neutrino\nflavor-transition millicharges and charge radii in the scattering experiments\nare pointed out.\n", "  Achieving high accuracy and precision in stellar parameter and chemical\ncomposition determinations is challenging in massive star spectroscopy. On one\nhand, the target selection for an unbiased sample build-up is complicated by\nseveral types of peculiarities that can occur in individual objects. On the\nother hand, composite spectra are often not recognized as such even at\nmedium-high spectral resolution and typical signal-to-noise ratios, despite\nmultiplicity among massive stars is widespread. In particular, surveys that\nproduce large amounts of automatically reduced data are prone to oversight of\ndetails that turn hazardous for the analysis with techniques that have been\ndeveloped for a set of standard assumptions applicable to a spectrum of a\nsingle star. Much larger systematic errors than anticipated may therefore\nresult because of the unrecognized true nature of the investigated objects, or\nmuch smaller sample sizes of objects for the analysis than initially planned,\nif recognized. More factors to be taken care of are the multiple steps from the\nchoice of instrument over the details of the data reduction chain to the choice\nof modelling code, input data, analysis technique and the selection of the\nspectral lines to be analyzed. Only when avoiding all the possible pitfalls, a\nprecise and accurate characterization of the stars in terms of fundamental\nparameters and chemical fingerprints can be achieved that form the basis for\nfurther investigations regarding e.g. stellar structure and evolution or the\nchemical evolution of the Galaxy. The scope of the present work is to provide\nthe broader community with criteria to evaluate spectroscopic investigations of\nmassive stars before interpreting them in a broader context. The discussion is\nguided by our experiences made over a decade of studies of massive star\nspectroscopy ranging from the simplest single objects to multiple systems.\n", "  A fractal bears a complex structure that is reflected in a scaling hierarchy,\nindicating that there are far more small things than large ones. This scaling\nhierarchy can be effectively derived using head/tail breaks - a clustering and\nvisualization tool for data with a heavy-tailed distribution - and quantified\nby an ht-index, indicating the number of clusters or hierarchical levels, a\nhead/tail breaks-induced integer. However, this integral ht-index has been\nfound to be less precise for many fractals at their different phrases of\ndevelopment. This paper refines the ht-index as a fraction to measure the\nscaling hierarchy of a fractal more precisely within a coherent whole, and\nfurther assigns a fractional ht-index - the fht-index - to an individual data\nvalue of a data series that represents the fractal. We developed two case\nstudies to demonstrate the advantages of the fht-index, in comparison with the\nht-index. We found that the fractional ht-index or fractional hierarchy in\ngeneral can help characterize a fractal set or pattern in a much more precise\nmanner. The index may help create intermediate map scales between two\nconsecutive map scales.\n  Keywords: Ht-index, fractal, scaling, complexity, fht-index\n", "  We show that the phase of the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)\nis immune to the effects of nonlinear evolution. This suggests that any new\nphysics that contributes to the initial phase of the BAO spectrum, such as\nextra light species in the early universe, can be extracted reliably at late\ntimes. We provide three arguments in support of our claim: First, we point out\nthat a phase shift of the BAO spectrum maps to a characteristic sign change in\nthe real space correlation function and that this feature cannot be generated\nor modified by nonlinear dynamics. Second, we confirm this intuition through an\nexplicit computation, valid to all orders in cosmological perturbation theory.\nFinally, we provide a nonperturbative argument using general analytic\nproperties of the linear response to the initial oscillations. Our result\nmotivates measuring the phase of the BAO spectrum as a robust probe of new\nphysics.\n", "  We study the holographic entanglement entropy and mutual information for\nLorentz boosted subsystems. In holographic CFTs at zero and finite temperature,\nwe find that the mutual information gets divergent in a universal way when the\nend points of two subsystems are light-like separated. In Lifshitz and\nhyperscaling violating geometries dual to non-relativistic theories, we show\nthat the holographic entanglement entropy is not well-defined for Lorentz\nboosted subsystems in general. This strongly suggests that in non-relativistic\ntheories, we cannot make a real space factorization of the Hilbert space on a\ngeneric time slice except the constant time slice, as opposed to relativistic\nfield theories.\n", "  In this paper, we detail an orthogonalization procedure that allows for the\nquantification of the amount of coherence present an arbitrary superposition of\ncoherent states. The present construction is based on the quantum coherence\nresource theory introduced by Baumgratz et al., and the coherence resource\nmonotone that we identify is found to characterize the nonclassicality\ntraditionally analyzed via the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$ distribution. This\nsuggests that identical quantum resources underlie both quantum coherence in\nthe discrete finite dimensional case and the nonclassicality of quantum light.\nWe show that our construction belongs to a family of resource monotones within\nthe framework of a resource theory of linear optics, thus establishing deeper\nconnections between the class of incoherent operations in the finite\ndimensional regime and linear optical operations in the continuous variable\nregime.\n", "  Massive stars like company. Here, we provide a brief overview of progresses\nmade over the last 5 years by a number of medium and large surveys. These\nresults provide new insights on the observed and intrinsic multiplicity\nproperties of main sequence massive stars and on the initial conditions for\ntheir future evolution. They also bring new interesting constraints on the\noutcome of the massive star formation process.\n", "  Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the most advanced stage in the evolution of the\nmost massive stars. The strong feedback provided by these objects and their\nsubsequent supernova (SN) explosions are decisive for a variety of\nastrophysical topics such as the cosmic matter cycle. Consequently,\nunderstanding the properties of WR stars and their evolution is indispensable.\nA crucial but still not well known quantity determining the evolution of WR\nstars is their mass-loss rate. Since the mass loss is predicted to increase\nwith metallicity, the feedback provided by these objects and their spectral\nappearance are expected to be a function of the metal content of their host\ngalaxy. This has severe implications for the role of massive stars in general\nand the exploration of low metallicity environments in particular. Hitherto,\nthe metallicity dependence of WR star winds was not well studied. In this\ncontribution, we review the results from our comprehensive spectral analyses of\nWR stars in environments of different metallicities, ranging from slightly\nsuper-solar to SMC-like metallicities. Based on these studies, we derived\nempirical relations for the dependence of the WN mass-loss rates on the\nmetallicity and iron abundance, respectively.\n", "  We point out that in generic TeV scale seesaw models for neutrino masses with\nlocal $B-L$ symmetry breaking, there is a phenomenologically allowed range of\nparameters where the Higgs field responsible for $B-L$ symmetry breaking leaves\na physical real scalar field with mass around GeV scale. This particle (denoted\nhere by $H_3$) is weakly mixed with the Standard Model Higgs field ($h$) with\nmixing $\\theta_1\\lesssim m_{H_3}/m_h$, barring fine-tuned cancellation. In the\nspecific case when the $B-L$ symmetry is embedded into the TeV scale left-right\nseesaw scenario, we show that the bounds on the $h-H_3$ mixing $\\theta_1$\nbecome further strengthened due to low energy flavor constraints, thus forcing\nthe light $H_3$ to be long lived, with displaced vertex signals at the LHC. The\nproperty of left-right TeV scale seesaw models are such that they make the\n$H_3$ decay to two photons as the dominant mode. This is in contrast with a\ngeneric light scalar that mixes with the SM Higgs boson, which could also have\nleptonic and hadronic decay modes with comparable or larger strength. We\ndiscuss the production of this new scalar field at the LHC and show that it\nleads to testable displaced vertex signals of collimated photon jets, which is\na new distinguishing feature of the left-right seesaw model. We also study a\nsimpler version of the model where the $SU(2)_R$ breaking scale is much higher\nthan the ${\\cal O}$(TeV) $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking scale, in which case the\nproduction and decay of $H_3$ proceed differently, but its long lifetime\nfeature is still preserved for a large range of parameters. Thus, the search\nfor such long-lived light scalar particles provides a new way to probe TeV\nscale seesaw models for neutrino masses at colliders.\n", "  It has been argued that the 0.7 anomaly in quantum point contacts (QPCs) is\ndue to an enhanced density of states at the top of the QPC-barrier (van Hove\nridge), which strongly enhances the effects of interactions. Here, we analyze\ntheir effect on dynamical quantities. We find that they pin the van Hove ridge\nto the chemical potential when the QPC is subopen; cause a temperature\ndependence for the linear conductance that qualitatively agrees with\nexperiment; strongly enhance the magnitude of the dynamical spin\nsusceptibility; and significantly lengthen the QPC traversal time. We conclude\nthat electrons traverse the QPC via a slowly fluctuating spin structure of\nfinite spatial extent.\n", "  Breaking the up-down symmetry of the tokamak poloidal cross-section can\nsignificantly increase the spontaneous rotation due to turbulent momentum\ntransport. In this work, we optimize the shape of flux surfaces with both\ntilted elongation and tilted triangularity in order to maximize this drive of\nintrinsic rotation. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations demonstrate that adding\noptimally-tilted triangularity can double the momentum transport of a tilted\nelliptical shape. This work indicates that tilting the elongation and\ntriangularity in an ITER-like device can reduce the energy transport and drive\nintrinsic rotation with an Alfv\\'{e}n Mach number on the order of $1\\%$. This\nrotation is four times larger than the rotation expected in ITER and is\nsufficient to stabilize MHD instabilities. It is shown that this optimal shape\ncan be created using the shaping coils of several experiments.\n", "  In order to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation, tight evaluation of\nerror threshold under practical noise models is essential. While non-Clifford\nnoise is ubiquitous in experiments, the error threshold under non-Clifford\nnoise cannot be efficiently treated with known approaches. We construct an\nefficient scheme for estimating the error threshold of one-dimensional quantum\nrepetition code under non-Clifford noise. To this end, we employ non-unitary\nfree-fermionic formalism for efficient simulation of the one-dimensional\nrepetition code under coherent noise. This allows us to evaluate the effect of\ncoherence in noise on the error threshold without any approximation. The result\nshows that the error threshold becomes one third when noise is fully coherent.\nOur scheme is also applicable to the surface code undergoing a specific\ncoherent noise model. The dependence of the error threshold on noise coherence\ncan be explained with a leading-order analysis with respect to coherence terms\nin the noise map. We expect that this analysis is also valid for the surface\ncode since it is a two-dimensional extension of the one-dimensional repetition\ncode. Moreover, since the obtained threshold is accurate, our results can be\nused as a benchmark for approximation or heuristic schemes for non-Clifford\nnoise.\n", "  Exactly solvable models have played an important role in establishing the\nsophisticated modern understanding of equilibrium many-body physics. And\nconversely, the relative scarcity of solutions for non-equilibrium models\ngreatly limits our understanding of systems away from thermal equilibrium. We\nstudy a family of non-equilibrium models, some of which can be viewed as\ndissipative analogues of the transverse-field Ising model, in that an\neffectively classical Hamiltonian is frustrated by dissipative processes that\ndrive the system toward states that do not commute with the Hamiltonian.\nSurprisingly, a broad and experimentally relevant subset of these models can be\nsolved efficiently in any number of spatial dimensions. We leverage these\nsolutions to prove a no-go theorem on steady-state phase transitions in a\nmany-body model that can be realized naturally with Rydberg atoms or trapped\nions, and to compute the effects of decoherence on a canonical\ntrapped-ion-based quantum computation architecture.\n", "  Single-electron pumps based on semiconductor quantum dots are promising\ncandidates for the emerging quantum standard of electrical current. They can\ntransfer discrete charges with part-per-million (ppm) precision in nanosecond\ntime scales. Here, we employ a metal-oxide-semiconductor silicon quantum dot to\nexperimentally demonstrate high-accuracy gigahertz single-electron pumping in\nthe regime where the number of electrons trapped in the dot is determined by\nthe thermal distribution in the reservoir leads. In a measurement with\ntraceability to primary voltage and resistance standards, the averaged pump\ncurrent over the quantized plateau, driven by a \\mbox{$1$-GHz} sinusoidal wave\nin the absence of magnetic field, is equal to the ideal value of $ef$ within a\nmeasurement uncertainty as low as $0.27$~ppm.\n", "  We investigate anomalous strong lens systems, particularly the effects of\nweak lensing by structures in the line of sight, in models with long-lived\nelectrically charged massive particles (CHAMPs). In such models, matter density\nperturbations are suppressed through the acoustic damping and the flux ratio of\nlens systems are impacted, from which we can constrain the nature of CHAMPs.\nFor this purpose, first we perform $N$-body simulations and develop a fitting\nformula to obtain non-linear matter power spectra in models where cold neutral\ndark matter and CHAMPs coexist in the early Universe. By using the observed\nanomalous quadruple lens samples, we obtained the constraints on the lifetime\n($\\tau_{\\rm Ch}$) and the mass density fraction ($r_{\\rm Ch}$) of CHAMPs. We\nshow that, for $r_{\\rm Ch}=1$, the lifetime is bounded as $\\tau_{\\rm Ch} <\n0.96\\,$yr (95% confidence level), while a longer lifetime $\\tau_{\\rm Ch} =\n10\\,$yr is allowed when $r_{\\rm Ch} < 0.5$ at the 95% confidence level.\nImplications of our result for particle physics models are also discussed.\n", "  We introduce the continuity equation for the electromagnetic spin angular\nmomentum (SAM) in matter and discuss the torque associated with the SAM\ntransfer in terms of effective spin forces acting in a material. In plasmonic\nmetal, these spin forces result in plasmogalvanic phenomenon which is pinning\nthe plasmon-induced electromotive force to atomically-thin layer at the metal\ninterface.\n", "  Recent experiments [Schaeffer 2015] have shown that lithium presents an\nextremely anomalous isotope effect in the 15-25 GPa pressure range. In this\narticle we have calculated the anharmonic phonon dispersion of $\\mathrm{^7Li}$\nand $\\mathrm{^6Li}$ under pressure, their superconducting transition\ntemperatures, and the associated isotope effect. We have found a huge\nanharmonic renormalization of a transverse acoustic soft mode along $\\Gamma$K\nin the fcc phase, the expected structure at the pressure range of interest. In\nfact, the anharmonic correction dynamically stabilizes the fcc phase above 25\nGPa. However, we have not found any anomalous scaling of the superconducting\ntemperature with the isotopic mass. Additionally, we have also analyzed whether\nthe two lithium isotopes adopting different structures could explain the\nobserved anomalous behavior. According to our enthalpy calculations including\nzero-point motion and anharmonicity it would not be possible in a stable\nregime.\n", "  A simple junior-level electrodynamics problem is used to illustrate the\ninterference between a source-free standing plane wave and a wave generated by\na pulse in a current sheet. Depending upon the relative phases between the\nstanding wave and the current pulse and also upon the relative magnitudes, we\ncan find quite different patterns of emitted energy and momentum. If the source\ngives a large radiation pulse so that the source-free plane wave can be\nneglected, then the radiation spreads out symmetrically on either side of the\ncurrent sheet. However, if the radiation sheet gives a pulse with fields\ncomparable to those of the standing wave, then we can find a single radiation\npulse moving to the right while the current sheet recoils to the left, or the\nsituation with the directions reversed. The example is a crude illustration of\nparticle-like behavior arising from conventional classical electromagnetic\nbehavior in the presence of source-free radiation. The discussion makes contact\nwith the ideas of photons in modern physics.\n", "  We theoretically address spin chain analogs of the Kitaev quantum spin model\non the honeycomb lattice. The emergent quantum spin liquid phases or Anderson\nresonating valence bond (RVB) states can be understood, as an effective model,\nin terms of p-wave superconductivity and Majorana fermions. We derive a\ngeneralized phase diagram for the two-leg ladder system with tunable\ninteraction strengths between chains allowing us to vary the shape of the\nlattice (from square to honeycomb ribbon or brickwall ladder). We evaluate the\nwinding number associated with possible emergent (topological) gapless modes at\nthe edges. In the Az phase, as a result of the emergent Z2 gauge fields and\npi-flux ground state, one may build spin-1/2 (loop) qubit operators by analogy\nto the toric code. In addition, we show how the intermediate gapless B phase\nevolves in the generalized ladder model. For the brickwall ladder, the $B$\nphase is reduced to one line, which is analyzed through perturbation theory in\na rung tensor product states representation and bosonization. Finally, we show\nthat doping with a few holes can result in the formation of hole pairs and\nleads to a mapping with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in polyacetylene; a\nsuperconducting-insulating quantum phase transition for these hole pairs is\naccessible, as well as related topological properties.\n", "  We study the properties of dark matter haloes in a wide range of modified\ngravity models, namely, $f(R)$, DGP, and interacting dark energy models. We\nstudy the effects of modified gravity and dark energy on the internal\nproperties of haloes, such as the spin and the structural parameters. We find\nthat $f(R)$ gravity enhance the median value of the Bullock spin parameter, but\ncould not detect such effects for DGP and coupled dark energy. $f(R)$ also\nyields a lower median sphericity and oblateness, while coupled dark energy has\nthe opposite effect. However, these effects are very small. We then study the\ninteraction rate of haloes in different gravity, and find that only strongly\ncoupled dark energy models enhance the interaction rate. We then quantify the\nenhancement of the alignment of the spins of interacting halo pairs by modified\ngravity. Finally, we study the alignment of the major axes of haloes with the\nlarge-scale structures. The alignment of the spins of interacting pairs of\nhaloes in DGP and coupled dark energy models show no discrepancy with GR, while\n$f(R)$ shows a weaker alignment. Strongly coupled dark energy shows a stronger\nalignment of the halo shape with the large-scale structures.\n", "  In this article we study the MSSM with stops and Higgs scalars much lighter\nthan gluinos and squarks of the first two generations. In this setup, one\nshould use an effective field theory with partial supersymmetry in which the\ngluino and heavy squarks are integrated out in order to connect SUSY parameters\n(given at a high scale) to observables in the stop sector. In the construction\nof this effective theory, valid below the gluino mass scale, we take into\naccount $O(\\alpha_3)$ and $O(Y_{t,b}^2)$ effects and calculate the matching as\nwell as the renormalization group evolution. As a result, the running of the\nparameters for the stop sector is modified with respect to the full MSSM and\nSUSY relations between parameters are broken. We show that for some couplings\nsizable numerical differences exist between the effective field theory approach\nand the naive calculation based on the MSSM running.\n", "  This paper investigates d-dimensional CFTs in the presence of a\ncodimension-one boundary and CFTs defined on real projective space RP^d. Our\nanalysis expands on the alpha space method recently proposed for\none-dimensional CFTs in arXiv:1702.08471. In this work we establish integral\nrepresentations for scalar two-point functions in boundary and crosscap CFTs\nusing plane-wave-normalizable eigenfunctions of different conformal Casimir\noperators. CFT consistency conditions imply integral equations for the spectral\ndensities appearing in these decompositions, and we study the relevant integral\nkernels in detail. As a corollary, we find that both the boundary and crosscap\nkernels can be identified with special limits of the d=1 crossing kernel.\n", "  We consider layered decorated honeycomb lattices at two-thirds filling, as\nrealized in some trinuclear organometallic complexes. Localized $S=1$ moments\nwith a single-spin anisotropy emerge from the interplay of Coulomb repulsion\nand spin molecular-orbit coupling (SMOC). Magnetic anisotropies with bond\ndependent exchange couplings occur in the honeycomb layers when the direct\nintracluster exchange and the spin molecular-orbital coupling are both present.\nWe find that the effective spin exchange model within the layers is an XXZ +\n120$^\\circ$ honeycomb quantum compass model. The intrinsic non-spherical\nsymmetry of the multinuclear complexes leads to very different transverse and\nlongitudinal spin molecular-orbital couplings, which greatly enhances the\nsingle-spin and exchange coupling anisotropies. The interlayer coupling is\ndescribed by a XXZ model with anisotropic biquadratic terms. As the correlation\nstrength increases the systems becomes increasingly one-dimensional. Thus, if\nthe ratio of SMOC to the interlayer hopping is small this stabilizes the\nHaldane phase. However, as the ratio increases there is a quantum phase\ntransition to the topologically trivial `$D$-phase'. We also predict a quantum\nphase transition from a Haldane phase to a magnetically ordered phase at\nsufficiently strong external magnetic fields.\n", "  Random geometric graphs in hyperbolic spaces explain many common structural\nand dynamical properties of real networks, yet they fail to predict the correct\nvalues of the exponents of power-law degree distributions observed in real\nnetworks. In that respect, random geometric graphs in asymptotically de Sitter\nspacetimes, such as the Lorentzian spacetime of our accelerating universe, are\nmore attractive as their predictions are more consistent with observations in\nreal networks. Yet another important property of hyperbolic graphs is their\nnavigability, and it remains unclear if de Sitter graphs are as navigable as\nhyperbolic ones. Here we study the navigability of random geometric graphs in\nthree Lorentzian manifolds corresponding to universes filled only with dark\nenergy (de Sitter spacetime), only with matter, and with a mixture of dark\nenergy and matter as in our universe. We find that these graphs are navigable\nonly in the manifolds with dark energy. This result implies that, in terms of\nnavigability, random geometric graphs in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes\nare as good as random hyperbolic graphs. It also establishes a connection\nbetween the presence of dark energy and navigability of the discretized causal\nstructure of spacetime, which provides a basis for a different approach to the\ndark energy problem in cosmology.\n", "  We show that the realizations of noncommutative coordinates that are linear\nin the Lorentz generators form a closed Lie algebra under certain conditions.\nThe star product and the coproduct for the momentum generators are obtained for\nthese Lie algebras and the corresponding twist satisfies the cocycle and\nnormalization conditions. We also obtain the twisted flip operator and the\n$\\mathcal R$-matrix that define the statistics of particles or quantum fields\npropagating in these noncommutative spacetimes. The Lie algebra obtained in\nthis work contains a special case which has been used in the literature to put\nbounds on noncommutative parameters from the experimental limits on Pauli\nforbidden transitions. The general covariant framework presented here is\nsuitable for analyzing the properties of particles or quantum fields at the\nPlanck scale.\n", "  Jet energy scale measurements and their systematic uncertainties are reported\nfor jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collision data\nwith a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ collected during 2015 at the LHC. Jets\nare reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of\ncalorimeter cells, using the anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm with radius parameter $R =\n0.4$. Jets are calibrated with a series of simulation-based corrections and in\nsitu techniques. In situ techniques exploit the transverse momentum balance\nbetween a jet and a reference object such as a photon, $Z$ boson, or multijet\nsystem for jets with $20 < p_{T} < 2000$ GeV and pseudorapidities of\n$|\\eta|<4.5$, using both data and simulation. An uncertainty in the jet energy\nscale of less than 1% is found in the central calorimeter region ($|\\eta| <\n1.2$) for jets with $100 < p_{T} < 500$ GeV. An uncertainty of about 4.5% is\nfound for low-$p_{T}$ jets with $p_{T} = 20$ GeV in the central region,\ndominated by uncertainties in the corrections for multiple proton-proton\ninteractions. The calibration of forward jets ($|\\eta| > 0.8$) is derived from\ndijet $p_{T}$ balance measurements. For jets of $p_{T} = 80$ GeV, the\nadditional uncertainty for the forward jet calibration reaches its largest\nvalue of about 2% in the range $|\\eta| > 3.5$ and in a narrow slice of $2.2 <\n|\\eta| < 2.4$.\n", "  Understanding how topological constraints affect the dynamics of polymers in\nsolution is at the basis of any polymer theory and it is particularly needed\nfor melts of rings. These polymers fold as crumpled and space-filling objects\nand, yet, they display a large number of topological constraints. To understand\ntheir role, here we systematically probe the response of solutions of rings at\nvarious densities to \"random pinning\" perturbations. We show that these\nperturbations trigger non-Gaussian and heterogeneous dynamics, eventually\nleading to non-ergodic and glassy behaviours. We then derive universal scaling\nrelations for the values of solution density and polymer length marking the\nonset of vitrification in unperturbed solutions. Finally, we directly connect\nthe heterogeneous dynamics of the rings with their spatial organisation and\nmutual interpenetration. Our results suggest that deviations from the typical\nbehaviours observed in systems of linear polymers may originate from\narchitecture-specific (threading) topological constraints.\n", "  Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have recently attracted a great deal of attention as\nthey provide condensed matter realization of chiral anomaly, feature\ntopologically protected Fermi arc surface states and sustain sharp chiral Weyl\nquasiparticles up to a critical disorder at which a continuous quantum phase\ntransition (QPT) drives the system into a metallic phase. We here numerically\ndemonstrate that with increasing strength of disorder the Fermi arc gradually\nlooses its sharpness, and close to the WSM-metal QPT it completely dissolves\ninto the metallic bath of the bulk. Predicted topological nature of the\nWSM-metal QPT and the resulting bulk-boundary correspondence across this\ntransition can directly be observed in\nangle-resolved-photo-emmision-spectroscopy (ARPES) and Fourier transformed\nscanning-tunneling-microscopy (STM) measurements by following the continuous\ndeformation of the Fermi arcs with increasing disorder in recently discovered\nWeyl materials.\n", "  The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for\nprobabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large\ndatasets. Gaussian Processes are a popular class of models used for this\npurpose but, since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of\nthe number of data points, their application has been limited to small\ndatasets. In this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process\nmodeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly\nwith the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to\nsimulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are\nexamples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic\noscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits\nstructure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture\nof complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or\nuniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a\nmixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a\nphysical motivation for and interpretation of this choice -- but we also\ndemonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We\npresent a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing\nscalable Gaussian Process methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a\nrange of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond.\nWe provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this\nmethod in C++, Python, and Julia.\n", "  To achieve high degree of quantum noise squeezing, an optical cavity is often\nemployed to enhance the interaction time between light and matter. Here, we\npropose to utilize the effect of coherent population trapping (CPT) to directly\ngenerate squeezed light without any optical cavity. Combined with the slow\npropagation speed of light in a CPT medium, a coherent state passing through an\natomic ensemble with a high optical density (OD) can evolve into a highly\nsqueezed state even in a single passage. Our study reveals that noise squeezing\nof more than $10$ dB can be achieved with an OD of 1,000, which is currently\navailable in experiments. A larger OD can further increase the degree of\nsqueezing. As the light intensity and two-photon detuning are key factors in\nthe CPT interaction, we also demonstrate that the minimum variance at a given\nOD can be reached for a wide range of these two factors, showing the proposed\nscheme is flexible and robust. Furthermore, there is no need to consider the\nphase-matching condition in the CPT scheme. Our introduction of high OD in\natomic media not only brings a long light-matter interaction time comparable to\noptical cavities, but also opens new avenue in the generation of squeezed light\nfor quantum interface.\n", "  With the recent discovery of Weyl semimetals, the phenomenon of negative\nmagnetoresistance (MR) is attracting renewed interest. While small negative MR\ncan occur due to the suppression of spin scattering or weak localization, large\nnegative MR is rare in materials, and when it happens, it is usually related to\nmagnetism. The large negative MR in Weyl semimetals is peculiar in that it is\nunrelated to magnetism and comes from chiral anomaly. Here we report that there\nis a new mechanism for large negative MR which is not related to magnetism but\nis related to disorder. In the newly-synthesized bulk-insulating topological\ninsulator TlBi$_{0.15}$Sb$_{0.85}$Te$_2$, we observed gigantic negative MR\nreaching 98% in 14 T at 10 K, which is unprecedented in a nonmagnetic system.\nSupported by numerical simulations, we argue that this phenomenon is likely due\nto the Zeeman effect on a barely percolating current path formed in the\ndisordered bulk. Since disorder can also lead to non-saturating linear MR in\nAg$_{2+\\delta}$Se, the present finding suggests that disorder engineering in\nnarrow-gap systems is useful for realizing gigantic MR in both positive and\nnegative directions.\n", "  Whether planetary nebulae (PNe) are predominantly the product of binary\nstellar evolution as some population synthesis models (PSM) suggest remains an\nopen question. Around 50 short period binary central stars ($P\\sim1$ d) are\nknown, but with only four with measured orbital periods over 10 d, our\nknowledge is severely incomplete. Here we report on the first discovery from a\nsystematic SALT HRS survey for long period binary central stars. We find a 142\nd orbital period from radial velocities of the central star of NGC~1360,\nHIP~16566. NGC~1360 appears to be the product of common-envelope (CE)\nevolution, with nebula features similar to post-CE PNe, albeit with an orbital\nperiod considerably longer than expected to be typical of post-CE PSM. The most\nstriking feature is a newly-identified ring of candidate low-ionisation\nstructures (LIS). Previous spatio-kinematic modelling of the nebula gives a\nnebula inclination of $30\\pm10$ deg, and assuming the binary nucleus is\ncoplanar with the nebula, multi-wavelength observations best fit a more\nmassive, evolved WD companion. A WD companion in a 142 d orbit is not the focus\nof many PSM, making NGC~1360 a valuable system with which to improve future PSM\nwork. HIP~16566 is amongst many central stars in which large radial velocity\nvariability was found by low-resolution surveys. The discovery of its binary\nnature may indicate long period binaries may be more common than PSM models\npredict.\n", "  We investigate terahertz emission from two-color fs-laser-induced\nmicroplasmas. Under strongest focusing conditions, microplasmas are shown to\nact as point-sources for broadband terahertz-to-far-infrared radiation, where\nthe emission bandwidth is determined by the plasma density. Semi-analytical\nmodeling allows us to identify scaling laws with respect to important laser\nparameters. In particular, we find that the optical-to-THz conversion\nefficiency crucially depends on the focusing conditions. We use this insight to\ndemonstrate by means of Maxwell-consistent 3D simulations, that for only\n10-$\\mu$J laser energy a conversion efficiency well above $10^{-4}$ can be\nachieved.\n", "  Close-contact melting refers to the process of a heat source melting its way\ninto a phase-change material. Of special interest is the close-contact melting\nvelocity, or more specifically the relative velocity between the heat source\nand the phase-change material. In this work, we present a novel numerical\napproach to simulate quasi-steady, heat flux driven close-contact melting. It\nextends existing approaches found in the literature, and, for the first time,\nallows to study the impact of a spatially varying heat flux distribution. We\nwill start by deriving the governing equations in a Lagrangian reference frame\nfixed to the heat source. Exploiting the narrowness of the melt film enables us\nto reduce the momentum balance to the Reynolds equation, which is coupled to\nthe energy balance via the velocity field. We particularize our derivation for\ntwo simple, yet technically relevant geometries, namely a 3d circular disc and\na 2d planar heat source. An iterative solution procedure for the coupled system\nis described in detail and discussed on the basis of a convergence study.\nFurthermore, we present an extension to allow for rotational melting modes.\nVarious test cases demonstrate the proficiency of our method. In particular, we\nwill utilize the method to assess the efficiency of the close-contact melting\nprocess and to quantify the model error introduced if convective losses are\nneglected. Finally, we will draw conclusions and present an outlook to future\nwork.\n", "  The macroscopic friction of particulate materials often weakens as the flow\nrate is increased, leading to potentially disastrous intermittent phenomena\nincluding earthquakes and landslides. We theoretically and numerically study\nthis phenomenon in simple granular materials. We show that velocity-weakening,\ncorresponding to a non-monotonic behavior in the friction law $\\mu(I)$, is\npresent even if the dynamic and static microscopic friction coefficients are\nidentical, but disappears for softer particles. We argue that this instability\nis induced by endogenous acoustic noise, which tends to make contacts slide,\nleading to faster flow and increased noise. We show that soft spots, or\nexcitable regions in the materials, correspond to rolling contacts that are\nabout to slide, whose density is described by a nontrivial exponent $\\theta_s$.\nWe build a microscopic theory for the non-monotonicity of $\\mu(I)$, which also\npredicts the scaling behavior of acoustic noise, the fraction of sliding\ncontacts $\\chi$ and the sliding velocity, in terms of $\\theta_s$. Surprisingly,\nthese quantities have no limit when particles become infinitely hard, as\nconfirmed numerically. Our analysis rationalizes previously unexplained\nobservations and makes new experimentally testable predictions.\n", "  The first billion years of the Universe is a pivotal time: stars, black holes\n(BHs) and galaxies form and assemble, sowing the seeds of galaxies as we know\nthem today. Detecting, identifying and understand- ing the first galaxies and\nBHs is one of the current observational and theoretical challenges in galaxy\nformation. In this paper we present a population synthesis model aimed at\ngalaxies, BHs and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. The model\nbuilds a population based on empirical relations. Galaxies are characterized by\na spectral energy distribution determined by age and metallicity, and AGNs by a\nspectral energy distribution determined by BH mass and accretion rate. We\nvalidate the model against observational constraints, and then predict\nproperties of galaxies and AGN in other wavelength and/or luminosity ranges,\nestimating the contamination of stellar populations (normal stars and high-mass\nX-ray binaries) for AGN searches from the infrared to X-rays, and vice-versa\nfor galaxy searches. For high-redshift galaxies, with stellar ages < 1 Gyr, we\nfind that disentangling stellar and AGN emission is challenging at restframe\nUV/optical wavelengths, while high-mass X-ray binaries become more important\nsources of confusion in X-rays. We propose a color-color selection in JWST\nbands to separate AGN vs star-dominated galaxies in photometric observations.\nWe also esti- mate the AGN contribution, with respect to massive, hot,\nmetal-poor stars, at driving high ionization lines, such as C IV and He II.\nFinally, we test the influence of the minimum BH mass and occupa- tion fraction\nof BHs in low mass galaxies on the restframe UV/near-IR and X-ray AGN\nluminosity function.\n", "  We present a more general form of the Schr\\\"odinger equation in curvilinear\nspace that is exposed to external fields. Thereby, we solve the wave equation\nwith the Cornell plus harmonic potentials (CHP) under the influence of the\nmagnetic and Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux fields using curvilinear coordinates\nsystem in such space. With this requirement, the energy spectrum and the\ncorresponding wave functions are calculated by means of the series method. The\nmass spectrum of both charmonium and bottomonium states consisting of quark and\nantiquark are calculated. In addition, the main thermodynamic functions such as\nthe free energy, the mean energy, the entropy, the specific heat, the\npersistent currents and magnetization are obtained by using the characteristic\nfunction. We draw the resulting energy states and the thermodynamic quantities\nversus some potential parameters, magnetic field and temperature to see their\nnumerical behaviors. Finally, we give some discussions to our results.\n", "  The Noble Prize in physics 2016 motivates one to study different aspects of\ntopological properties and topological defects as their related objects.\nConsidering the significant role of the topological defects (especially\nmagnetic strings) in cosmology, here, we will investigate three dimensional\nhorizonless magnetic solutions in the presence of two generalizations: massive\ngravity and nonlinear electromagnetic field. The effects of these two\ngeneralizations on properties of the solutions and their geometrical structure\nare investigated. The differences between de Sitter and anti de Sitter\nsolutions are highlighted and conditions regarding the existence of phase\ntransition in geometrical structure of the solutions are studied.\n", "  We present the discovery of a substellar companion to the primary host lens\nin the microlensing event MOA-2012-BLG-006. The companion-to-host mass ratio is\n0.016, corresponding to a companion mass of $\\approx8~M_{\\rm Jup}\n(M_*/0.5M_\\odot)$. Thus, the companion is either a high-mass giant planet or a\nlow-mass brown dwarf, depending on the mass of the primary $M_*$. The companion\nsignal was separated from the peak of the primary event by a time that was as\nmuch as four times longer than the event timescale. We therefore infer a\nrelatively large projected separation of the companion from its host of\n$\\approx10~{\\rm a.u.}(M_*/0.5M_\\odot)^{1/2}$ for a wide range (3-7 kpc) of host\nstar distances from the Earth. We also challenge a previous claim of a\nplanetary companion to the lens star in microlensing event OGLE-2002-BLG-045.\n", "  We calculate the charge distributions of $d^*(2380)$. Two different\ninterpretations of the $d^*$ are considered for a comparison. One is a compact\nexplanation with coupled $\\Delta\\Delta+CC$ two-channel approximation in the\nchiral constituent quark model. Another is a resonance state of $D_{12}\\pi$.\nThe remarkable differences of the charge distributions in the two pictures are\nshown and it is expected that the future experiments may provide a clear test\nfor the different theoretical interpretations.\n", "  By performing first principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport\nequations, we calculate the thermoelectric power factor (PF) of Bi-Sb-Te and\nBi-Te-Se ternary alloys as a function of alloy composition ratio, carrier\nconcentration, and temperature. The point defect formation energy calculations\nalso perform to search potential n-type dopant candidates in ternaries.\n", "  Using large-scale simulations based on matrix product state and quantum Monte\nCarlo techniques, we study the superfluid to Bose glass-transition for\none-dimensional attractive hard-core bosons at zero temperature, across the\nfull regime from weak to strong disorder. As a function of interaction and\ndisorder strength, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical line\nwith two different regimes. At small attraction where critical disorder is weak\ncompared to the bandwidth, the critical Luttinger parameter $K_c$ takes its\nuniversal Giamarchi-Schulz value $K_{c}=3/2$. Conversely, a non-universal\n$K_c>3/2$ emerges for stronger attraction where weak-link physics is relevant.\nIn this strong disorder regime, the transition is characterized by self-similar\npower-law distributed weak links with a continuously varying characteristic\nexponent $\\alpha$.\n", "  Femtosecond laser written patterns at the surface of brittle materials may\nshow a regenerative random transition from self-organized to disordered\nstructures. Here, we show that this random intermittent behaviour carries\nrelevant fracture statistics information, such as the so-called Weibull\nparameters. Furthermore, we draw a phenomenological analogy with idle and busy\nperiods arising in queueing systems that we used to establish that these\nsuccessive laser generated cycles are statistically independent. Based on this\nanalogy and together with microscopic observations, we propose an experimental\nmethod bypassing the need for many specimens to build-up statistically relevant\nensembles of fracture tests. This method is potentially generic as it may apply\nto a broad number of brittle materials.\n", "  The Casimir force between macroscopic bodies is well understood, but not the\nCasimir stress inside bodies. Suppose empty space or a uniform medium meets a\nsoft wall where the refractive index is continuous but its derivative jumps.\nFor this situation we predict a characteristic power law for the stress inside\nthe soft wall and close to its edges. Our result shows that such edges are not\ntolerated in the aggregation of liquids at surfaces, regardless whether the\nliquid is attracted or repelled.\n", "  We study the generation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of three\npath-encoded photons. Inspired by the seminal work of Bouwmeester et al. [1] on\npolarization-entangled GHZ states, we find a corresponding path representation\nfor the photon states of an optical circuit, identify the elements required for\nthe state generation, and propose a possible implementation of our strategy.\nBesides the practical advantage of employing an integrated system that can be\nfabricated with proven lithographic techniques, our example suggests that it is\npossible to enhance the generation efficiency by using microring resonators.\n", "  We describe the phenomenology of the classical q-path entropy of a\nphase-space curve. This allows one to disclose an entropic force-like mechanism\nthat is able to mimic some phenomenological aspects of the strong force, such\nas confinement, hard core, and asymptotic freedom.\n", "  We report on Hybrid-Monte-Carlo simulations at finite spin density of the\n$\\pi$-band electrons in monolayer graphene with realistic inter-electron\ninteractions. Unlike simulations at finite charge-carrier density, these are\nnot affected by a fermion-sign problem. Our results are in qualitative\nagreement with an interaction-induced warping of the Fermi contours, and a\nreduction of the bandwidth as observed in angle resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy experiments on charge-doped graphene systems. Furthermore, we find\nevidence that the neck-disrupting Lifshitz transition, which occurs when the\nFermi level traverses the van Hove singularity (VHS), becomes a true quantum\nphase transition due to interactions. This is in-line with an instability of\nthe VHS towards the formation of electronic ordered phases, which has been\npredicted by a variety of different theoretical approaches.\n", "  The theory of generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) was recently developed as a new\ntool for the study of inhomogeneous time evolution in many-body interacting\nsystems with infinitely many conserved charges. In this letter, we show that it\nsupersedes the widely used conventional hydrodynamics (CHD) of one-dimensional\nBose gases. We illustrate this by studying \"nonlinear sound waves\" emanating\nfrom initial density accumulations in the Lieb-Liniger model. We show that, at\nzero temperature and in the absence of shocks, GHD reduces to CHD, thus for the\nfirst time justifying its use from purely hydrodynamic principles. We show that\nsharp profiles, which appear in finite times in CHD, immediately dissolve into\na higher hierarchy of reductions of GHD, with no sustained shock. CHD thereon\nfails to capture the correct hydrodynamics. We establish the correct\nhydrodynamic equations, which are finite-dimensional reductions of GHD\ncharacterized by multiple, disjoint Fermi seas. We further verify that at\nnonzero temperature, CHD fails at all nonzero times. Finally, we numerically\nconfirm the emergence of hydrodynamics at zero temperature by comparing its\npredictions with a full quantum simulation performed using the NRG-TSA-ABACUS\nalgorithm. The analysis is performed in the full interaction range, and is not\nrestricted to either weak- or strong-repulsion regimes.\n", "  We give a brief overview of where we stand with respect to some old and new\nquestions bearing on how massive stars evolve and end their lifetime. We focus\non the following key points that are further discussed by other contributions\nduring this conference: convection, mass losses, rotation, magnetic field and\nmultiplicity. For purpose of clarity, each of these processes are discussed on\nits own but we have to keep in mind that they are all interacting between them\noffering a large variety of outputs, some of them still to be discovered.\n", "  One-dimensional (1D) electronic states were discovered on 1D surface atomic\nstructure of Bi fabricated on semiconductor InSb(001) substrates by\nangle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). The 1D state showed steep,\nDirac-cone-like dispersion along the 1D atomic structure with a finite direct\nbandgap opening as large as 150 meV. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES revealed the\nspin polarization of the 1D unoccupied states as well as that of the occupied\nstates, the orientation of which inverted depending on the wave vector\ndirection parallel to the 1D array on the surface. These results reveal that a\nspin-polarized quasi-1D carrier was realized on the surface of 1D Bi with\nhighly efficient backscattering suppression, showing promise for use in future\nspintronic and energy-saving devices.\n", "  We examine the role of the large--scale anisotropy of the high--energy cosmic\nray distribution in a search for the heavy decaying dark matter (DM) signal.\nUsing recent anisotropy measurements from the extensive air shower (EAS)\nobservatories we constrain the lifetime of the DM particles with masses\n$10^{7}~\\leq~M_X~\\leq~10^{16}$ GeV. These constraints appear to be weaker than\nthat obtained with the high energy gamma-ray limits. We also estimate the\ndesired precision level for the anisotropy measurements to discern the decaying\nDM signal marginally allowed by the gamma-ray limits and discuss the prospects\nof the DM search with the modern EAS facilities.\n", "  Lead halide perovskite semiconductors are soft, polar, materials. The strong\ndriving force for polaron formation (the dielectric electron-phonon coupling)\nis balanced by the light band effective-masses, leading to a\nstrongly-interacting large-polaron. A first-principles prediction of mobility\nwould help understand the fundamental mobility limits. Theories of mobility\nneed to consider the polaron (rather than free-carrier) state due to the strong\ninteractions. In this material we expect that at room temperature polar-optical\nphonon mode scattering will dominate, and so limit mobility. We calculate the\ntemperature-dependent polaron mobility of hybrid halide perovskites by\nvariationally solving the Feynman polaron model with the finite-temperature\nfree-energies of \\=Osaka. This model considers a simplified effective-mass\nband-structure interacting with a continuum dielectric of characteristic\nresponse frequency. We parametrise the model fully from electronic-structure\ncalculations. In methylammonium lead iodide at 300 K we predict electron and\nhole mobilities of 133 and 94 cm^2/V/s respectively. These are in acceptable\nagreement with single-crystal measurements, suggesting that the intrinsic limit\nof the polaron charge carrier state has been reached. Repercussions for\nhot-electron photo-excited states are discussed. As well as mobility, the model\nalso exposes the dynamic structure of the polaron. This can be used to\ninterpret impedance measurements of the charge-carrier state. We provide the\nphonon-drag mass-renormalisation, and scattering time constants. These could be\nused as parameters for larger-scale device models and band-structure dependent\nmobility simulations.\n", "  The two-dimensional Terry-Horton equation is shown to exhibit the Dimits\nshift when suitably modified to capture both the nonlinear enhancement of\nzonal/drift-wave interactions and the existence of residual Rosenbluth-Hinton\nstates. This phenomenon persists through numerous simplifications of the\nequation, including a quasilinear approximation as well as a four-mode\ntruncation. It is shown that the use of an appropriate adiabatic electron\nresponse, for which the electrons are not affected by the flux-averaged\npotential, results in an $\\boldsymbol{E}\\boldsymbol{\\times}\\boldsymbol{B}$\nnonlinearity that can efficiently transfer energy nonlocally to length scales\non the order of the sound radius. The size of the shift for the nonlinear\nsystem is heuristically calculated and found to be in excellent agreement with\nnumerical solutions. The existence of the Dimits shift for this system is then\nunderstood as an ability of the unstable primary modes to efficiently couple to\nstable modes at smaller scales, and the shift ends when these stable modes\neventually destabilize as the density gradient is increased. This nonlocal\nmechanism of energy transfer is argued to be generically important even for\nmore physically complete systems.\n", "  Direct imaging of exoplanets represents a challenge for astronomical\ninstrumentation due to the high-contrast ratio and small angular separation\nbetween the host star and the faint planet. Multi-star systems pose additional\nchallenges for coronagraphic instruments due to the diffraction and aberration\nleakage caused by companion stars. Consequently, many scientifically valuable\nmulti-star systems are excluded from direct imaging target lists for exoplanet\nsurveys and characterization missions. Multi-star wavefront control (MSWC) is a\ntechnique that uses a coronagraphic instrument's deformable mirror (DM) to\ncreate high-contrast regions in the focal plane in the presence of multiple\nstars. Our previous paper introduced the Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control (SNWC)\ntechnique that uses a diffraction grating to enable the DM to generate\nhigh-contrast regions beyond the nominal region correctable by the DM. These\ntwo techniques can be combined to generate high-contrast regions for multi-star\nsystems at any angular separation. As a case study, a high-contrast wavefront\ncontrol (WC) simulation that applies these techniques shows that the habitable\nregion of the Alpha Centauri system can be imaged reaching at least $8 \\times\n10^{-9}$ mean contrast in 10\\% broadband light in one-sided dark holes from\n1.6-5.5$\\lambda/D$.\n", "  We study stochastic thermodynamics for a quantum system of interest whose\ndynamics are described by a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map as\na result of its interaction with a thermal bath. We define CPTP maps with\nequilibrium as CPTP maps with an invariant state such that the entropy\nproduction due to the action of the map on the invariant state vanishes.\nThermal maps are a subgroup of CPTP maps with equilibrium. In general, for CPTP\nmaps, the thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy production or work\nperformed on the system, depend on the combined state of the system plus its\nenvironment. We show that these quantities can be written in terms of system\nproperties for maps with equilibrium. The relations that we obtain are valid\nfor arbitrary coupling strengths between the system and the thermal bath. The\nfluctuations of thermodynamic quantities are considered in the framework of a\ntwo-point measurement scheme. We derive the entropy production fluctuation\ntheorem for general maps and a fluctuation relation for the stochastic work on\na system that starts in the Gibbs state. Some simplifications for the\nprobability distributions in the case of maps with equilibrium are presented.\nWe illustrate our results by considering spin 1/2 systems under thermal maps,\nnon-thermal maps with equilibrium, maps with non-equilibrium steady states and\nconcatenations of them. Finally, we consider a particular limit in which the\nconcatenation of maps generates a continuous time evolution in Lindblad form\nfor the system of interest, and we show that the concept of maps with and\nwithout equilibrium translates into Lindblad equations with and without quantum\ndetailed balance, respectively. The consequences for the thermodynamic\nquantities in this limit are discussed.\n", "  Automatic nuclear emulsion readout systems have seen remarkable progress\nsince the original idea was developed almost 40 years ago. After the success of\nits full application to a large-scale neutrino experiment, OPERA, a much faster\nreadout system, the hyper-track selector (HTS), has been developed. HTS, which\nhas an extremely wide-field objective lens, reached a scanning speed of 4700\ncm$^2$/h, which is nearly 100 times faster than the previous system and\ntherefore strongly promotes many new experimental projects. We will describe\nthe concept, specifications, system structure, and achieved performance in this\npaper.\n", "  In the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole (WH) metrics the motion of a particle along\ncurved rotating channels is studied. By taking into account a prescribed shape\nof a trajectory we derive the reduced $1+1$ metrics, obtain the corresponding\nLangrangian of a free particle and analytically and numerically solve the\ncorresponding equations of motion. We have shown that if the channels are\ntwisted and lag behind rotation, under certain conditions beads might\nasymptotically reach infinity, leaving the WH, which is not possible for\nstraight co-rotating trajectories. The analytical and numerical study is\nperformed for two and three dimensional cases and initial conditions of\nparticles are analysed in the context of possibility of passing through the WH.\n", "  The emergence of complex and fascinating states of quantum matter in the\nneighborhood of zero temperature phase transitions suggests that such quantum\nphenomena should be studied in a variety of settings. Advanced technologies of\nthe future may be fabricated from materials where the cooperative behavior of\ncharge, spin and current can be manipulated at cryogenic temperatures. The\npropagating lattice dynamics of displacive ferroelectrics make them appealing\nfor the study of quantum critical phenomena that is characterized by both\nspace- and time-dependent quantities. In this Key Issues article we aim to\nprovide a self-contained overview of ferroelectrics near quantum phase\ntransitions. Unlike most magnetic cases, the ferroelectric quantum critical\npoint can be tuned experimentally to reside at, above or below its upper\ncritical dimension; this feature allows for detailed interplay between\nexperiment and theory using both scaling and self-consistent field models.\nEmpirically, the sensitivity of the ferroelectrics $T_c$s to external to\nchemical pressure gives practical access to a broad range of temperature\nbehavior over several hundreds of Kelvin. Additional degrees of freedom like\ncharge and spin can be added and characterized systematically. Satellite\nmemories, electrocaloric cooling and low-loss phased-array radar are among\npossible applications of low-temperature ferroelectrics. We end with open\nquestions for future research that include textured polarization states and\nunusual forms of superconductivity that remain to be understood theoretically.\n", "  We study the effect of Hund's splitting of repulsive interactions on\nelectronic phase transitions in the multiorbital topological crystalline\ninsulator Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Te, when the chemical potential is tuned to the\nvicinity of low-lying Type-II Van Hove singularities. Nontrivial Berry phases\nassociated with the Bloch states impart momentum-dependence to electron\ninteractions in the relevant band. We use a multipatch parquet renormalization\ngroup (RG) analysis for studying the competition of different electronic\nphases, and find that if the dominant fixed-point interactions correspond to\nantiparallel spin configurations, then a chiral $p$-wave\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(FFLO) state is favored, otherwise, none of the\ncommonly encountered electronic instabilities occur within the one-loop parquet\nRG approach.\n", "  We analyze the spectra of 300,000 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) with stellar\nmasses $M_* \\gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$ from the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS). By studying their star-formation histories, we\nfind two main evolutionary paths converging into the same quiescent galaxy\npopulation at $z\\sim0.55$. Fast-growing LRGs assemble $80\\%$ of their stellar\nmass very early on ($z\\sim5$), whereas slow-growing LRGs reach the same\nevolutionary state at $z\\sim1.5$. Further investigation reveals that their\nclustering properties on scales of $\\sim$1-30 Mpc are, at a high level of\nsignificance, also different. Fast-growing LRGs are found to be more strongly\nclustered and reside in overall denser large-scale structure environments than\nslow-growing systems, for a given stellar-mass threshold. Our results imply a\ndependence of clustering on stellar-mass assembly history (naturally connected\nto the mass-formation history of the corresponding halos) for a homogeneous\npopulation of similar mass and color, which constitutes a strong observational\nevidence of galaxy assembly bias.\n", "  Based on first-principle calculations and $k\\cdot p$ model analysis, we show\nthat the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating phase can be realized in the\nfunctionalized hematite (or $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) nanosheet and the obtained\ntopological gap can be as large as $\\sim$300 meV. The driving force of the\ntopological phase is the strong interactions of localized Fe 3$d$ electrons\noperating on the quadratic band crossing point of the non-interacting band\nstructures. Such interaction driven QAH insulator is different from the single\nparticle band topology mechanism in experimentally realized QAH insulator, the\nmagnetic ion doped topological insulator film. Depending on the thickness of\nthe nanosheet, topological insulating state with helical-like or chiral edge\nstates can be realized. Our work provides a realization of the\ninteraction-driven QAH insulating state in a realistic material.\n", "  We consider $d\\times d$ tensors $A(x)$ that are symmetric, positive\nsemi-definite, and whose row-divergence vanishes identically. We establish\nsharp inequalities for the integral of $(\\det A)^{\\frac1{d-1}}$. We apply them\nto models of compressible inviscid fluids: Euler equations, Euler--Fourier,\nrelativistic Euler, Boltzman, BGK, etc... We deduce an {\\em a priori} estimate\nfor a new quantity, namely the space-time integral of $\\rho^{\\frac1n}p$, where\n$\\rho$ is the mass density, $p$ the pressure and $n$ the space dimension. For\nkinetic models, the corresponding quantity generalizes Bony's functional.\n", "  We survey the theory of Poisson traces (or zeroth Poisson homology) developed\nby the authors in a series of recent papers. The goal is to understand this\nsubtle invariant of (singular) Poisson varieties, conditions for it to be\nfinite-dimensional, its relationship to the geometry and topology of symplectic\nresolutions, and its applications to quantizations. The main technique is the\nstudy of a canonical D-module on the variety. In the case the variety has\nfinitely many symplectic leaves (such as for symplectic singularities and\nHamiltonian reductions of symplectic vector spaces by reductive groups), the\nD-module is holonomic, and hence the space of Poisson traces is\nfinite-dimensional. As an application, there are finitely many irreducible\nfinite-dimensional representations of every quantization of the variety.\nConjecturally, the D-module is the pushforward of the canonical D-module under\nevery symplectic resolution of singularities, which implies that the space of\nPoisson traces is dual to the top cohomology of the resolution. We explain many\nexamples where the conjecture is proved, such as symmetric powers of du Val\nsingularities and symplectic surfaces and Slodowy slices in the nilpotent cone\nof a semisimple Lie algebra. We compute the D-module in the case of surfaces\nwith isolated singularities, and show it is not always semisimple. We also\nexplain generalizations to arbitrary Lie algebras of vector fields, connections\nto the Bernstein-Sato polynomial, relations to two-variable special polynomials\nsuch as Kostka polynomials and Tutte polynomials, and a conjectural\nrelationship with deformations of symplectic resolutions. In the appendix we\ngive a brief recollection of the theory of D-modules on singular varieties that\nwe require.\n", "  The famous three-body problem can be traced back to Isaac Newton in 1680s. In\nthe 300 years since this \"three-body problem\" was first recognized, only three\nfamilies of periodic solutions had been found, until 2013 when \\v{S}uvakov and\nDmitra\\v{s}inovi\\'c [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 114301 (2013)] made a breakthrough\nto numerically find 13 new distinct periodic orbits, which belong to 11 new\nfamilies of Newtonian planar three-body problem with equal mass and zero\nangular momentum. In this paper, we numerically obtain 695 families of\nNewtonian periodic planar collisionless orbits of three-body system with equal\nmass and zero angular momentum in case of initial conditions with isosceles\ncollinear configuration, including the well-known Figure-eight family found by\nMoore in 1993, the 11 families found by \\v{S}uvakov and Dmitra\\v{s}inovi\\'c in\n2013, and more than 600 new families that have been never reported, to the best\nof our knowledge. With the definition of the average period $\\bar{T} = T/L_f$,\nwhere $L_f$ is the length of the so-called \"free group element\", these 695\nfamilies suggest that there should exist the quasi Kepler's third law $\n\\bar{T}^* \\approx 2.433 \\pm 0.075$ for the considered case, where $\\bar{T}^*=\n\\bar{T} |E|^{3/2}$ is the scale-invariant average period and $E$ is its total\nkinetic and potential energy, respectively. The movies of these 695 periodic\norbits in the real space and the corresponding close curves on the \"shape\nsphere\" can be found via the website:\nhttp://numericaltank.sjtu.edu.cn/three-body/three-body.htm\n", "  We discuss $Z$ -production in the deep inelastic process $e + P \\to e + Z +\nX$ in the context of the Standard Model using the Parton Model. In contrast to\nthe deep inelastic $eP$-scattering ($e + P \\to e + X$), where the choice of\n$\\tilde{Q}^{2} $ is unambiguous, in this case is not clear since the momentum\ntransfer square, at the quark level, depends on the reaction mechanism. Our aim\nin this work is to show that the total cross section depends strongly on the\nprescription used for the scale parameter $\\tilde{Q}^{2}$ and on a different\noption that we have taken for making the convolution of the parton distribution\nfunctions and the amplitude of the quark processes. We present results for the\ntotal cross section as a function of the total energy $\\sqrt{s}$ of the system\n$eP$, in the range $300 \\leq \\sqrt{s} \\leq 1300$ GeV. We find differences of up\nto 25\\% in the rates of the total cross section for the different prescriptions\nthat we have taken, for $\\sqrt{s} \\approx 1300$ GeV, which is the expected\nmaximal total energy of the system $eP$ to be reached at the LHeC. Taking an\nintegrated luminosity of $ab^{-1}$, such a difference (25\\%) corresponds to\n$\\approx 10^4$ produced $Z$ bosons. Finally, we propose to modify slightly the\nParton Model in order to do a simple and practical prescription for the\ncalculation without ambiguities of the $Z$-production in the deep inelastic\n$eP$ scattering.\n", "  We present a cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing map produced from a\nlinear combination of South Pole Telescope (SPT) and \\emph{Planck} temperature\ndata. The 150 GHz temperature data from the $2500\\ {\\rm deg}^{2}$ SPT-SZ survey\nis combined with the \\emph{Planck} 143 GHz data in harmonic space, to obtain a\ntemperature map that has a broader $\\ell$ coverage and less noise than either\nindividual map. Using a quadratic estimator technique on this combined\ntemperature map, we produce a map of the gravitational lensing potential\nprojected along the line of sight. We measure the auto-spectrum of the lensing\npotential $C_{L}^{\\phi\\phi}$, and compare it to the theoretical prediction for\na $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology consistent with the \\emph{Planck} 2015 data set,\nfinding a best-fit amplitude of $0.95_{-0.06}^{+0.06}({\\rm Stat.})\\!\n_{-0.01}^{+0.01}({\\rm Sys.})$. The null hypothesis of no lensing is rejected at\na significance of $24\\,\\sigma$. One important use of such a lensing potential\nmap is in cross-correlations with other dark matter tracers. We demonstrate\nthis cross-correlation in practice by calculating the cross-spectrum,\n$C_{L}^{\\phi G}$, between the SPT+\\emph{Planck} lensing map and Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (\\emph{WISE}) galaxies. We fit $C_{L}^{\\phi G}$ to a\npower law of the form $p_{L}=a(L/L_{0})^{-b}$ with $a=2.15 \\times 10^{-8}$,\n$b=1.35$, $L_{0}=490$, and find $\\eta^{\\phi G}=0.94^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, which is\nmarginally lower, but in good agreement with $\\eta^{\\phi\nG}=1.00^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$, the best-fit amplitude for the cross-correlation of\n\\emph{Planck}-2015 CMB lensing and \\emph{WISE} galaxies over $\\sim67\\%$ of the\nsky. The lensing potential map presented here will be used for\ncross-correlation studies with the Dark Energy Survey (DES), whose footprint\nnearly completely covers the SPT $2500\\ {\\rm deg}^2$ field.\n", "  X-ray magnetic circular and linear dichroism (XMCD and XMLD) have been used\nto investigate the Fe magnetic response during the spin reorientation\ntransition (SRT) in TmFeO3. These experiments are complemented with resonant\nmagnetic diffraction experiments at the Tm M5 edge to study simultaneously the\ninduced magnetic order in the Tm 4f shell and the behavior of the Tm orbitals\nthrough the SRT. Comparing the Fe XMLD results with neutron diffraction and\nmagnetization measurements on the same sample indicate that the SRT has an\nenhanced temperature range in the near surface region. This view is supported\nby the resonant soft x-ray diffraction results at the Tm M5 edge. These find an\ninduced magnetic moment on the Tm sites, which is well-described by a dipolar\nmean field model originating from the Fe moments. Even though such a model can\ndescribe the 4f response in the experiments, it is insufficient to describe the\nSRT even when considering a change in the 4f anisotropy. Moreover, the results\nof the Fe XMCD are indicative of a decoupling of spin canting and\nantiferromagnetic spin rotation in the near surface regime close to the SRT,\nwhich remains to be understood.\n", "  Forward amplitude analyses constitute an important approach in the\ninvestigation of the energy dependence of the total hadronic cross-section\n$\\sigma_{tot}$ and the $\\rho$ parameter. The standard picture indicates for\n$\\sigma_{tot}$ a leading log-squared dependence at the highest c.m. energies,\nin accordance with the Froissart-Lukaszuk-Martin bound. Beyond this log-squared\n(L2) leading dependence, other amplitude analyses have considered a\nlog-raised-to-gamma form (L$\\gamma$), with $\\gamma$ as a real free fit\nparameter. In this case, analytic connections with $\\rho$ can be obtained\neither through dispersion relations (derivative forms), or asymptotic\nuniqueness (Phragm\\'en-Lindel\\\"off theorems). In this work we present a\ndetailed discussion on the similarities and mainly the differences between the\nDerivative Dispersion Relation (DDR) and Asymptotic Uniqueness (AU) approaches\nand results, with focus on the L$\\gamma$ and L2 leading terms. We also develop\nnew Regge-Gribov fits with updated dataset on $\\sigma_{tot}$ and $\\rho$ from\n$pp$ and $\\bar{p}p$ scattering, in the region 5 GeV-8 TeV. The recent tension\nbetween the TOTEM and ATLAS results at 7 TeV and mainly 8 TeV is considered in\nthe data reductions. Our main conclusions are: (1) all fit results present\nagreement with the experimental data analyzed and the goodness-of-fit is\nslightly better in case of the DDR approach; (2) by considering only the TOTEM\ndata at the LHC region, the fits with L$\\gamma$ indicate $\\gamma\\sim 2.0\\pm\n0.2$ (AU) and $\\gamma\\sim 2.3\\pm 0.1$ (DDR); (3) by including the ATLAS data\nthe fits provide $\\gamma\\sim 1.9\\pm 0.1$ (AU) and $\\gamma\\sim 2.2\\pm 0.2$\n(DDR); (4) in the formal and practical contexts, the DDR approach is more\nadequate for the energy interval investigated than the AU approach. A review on\nthe analytic results for $\\sigma_{tot}$ and $\\rho$ from the Regge-Gribov, DDR\nand AU approaches is presented.\n", "  The surfaces of growing biological tissues, swelling gels, and compressed\nrubbers do not remain smooth, but frequently exhibit highly localized inward\nfolds. We reveal the morphology of this surface folding in a novel experimental\nsetup, which permits to deform the surface of a soft gel in a controlled\nfashion. The interface first forms a sharp furrow, whose tip size decreases\nrapidly with deformation. Above a critical deformation, the furrow bifurcates\nto an inward folded crease of vanishing tip size. We show experimentally and\nnumerically that both creases and furrows exhibit a universal cusp-shape, whose\nwidth scales like $y^{3/2}$ at a distance $y$ from the tip. We provide a\nsimilarity theory that captures the singular profiles before and after the\nself-folding bifurcation, and derive the length of the fold from large\ndeformation elasticity.\n", "  An ideal preamplifier for qubit measurement must not only provide high gain\nand near quantum-limited noise performance, but also isolate the delicate\nquantum circuit from noisy downstream measurement stages while producing\nnegligible backaction. Here we use a Superconducting Low-inductance Undulatory\nGalvanometer (SLUG) microwave amplifier to read out a superconducting transmon\nqubit, and we characterize both reverse isolation and measurement backaction of\nthe SLUG. For appropriate dc bias, the SLUG achieves reverse isolation that is\nbetter than that of a commercial cryogenic isolator. Moreover, SLUG backaction\nis dominated by thermal emission from dissipative elements in the device. When\nthe SLUG is operated in pulsed mode, it is possible to characterize the\ntransmon qubit using a measurement chain that is free from cryogenic isolators\nor circulators with no measurable degradation of qubit performance.\n", "  One way to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of solids is to induce\nadditional phonon surface scattering through nanostructures. However, how\nphonons interact with boundaries, especially at the atomic level, is not well\nunderstood. In this work, we performed two-dimensional atomistic wave packet\nsimulations to investigate the phonon surface interaction. Emphasis has been\ngiven to the angular-resolved phonon reflection at smooth, periodically rough,\nand amorphous surfaces. We found that the acoustic phonon reflection at a\nsmooth surface is not simply specular. Mode conversion can occur after\nreflection, and the detailed energy distribution after reflection will\ndependent on surface condition and polarization of incident phonon. At\nperiodically rough surfaces, the reflected wave packet distribution does not\nfollow the well-known Ziman's model, but shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the\ndepth of surface roughness. When an amorphous layer is attached to the surface,\nthe incident wave packet will be absorbed by the amorphous region, and results\nin quite diffusive reflection. Our results clearly show that the commonly used\nspecular-diffusive model is not enough to describe the phonon reflection at a\nperiodically rough surface, while an amorphous layer can induce strong\ndiffusive reflection. This work provides a careful analysis of phonon\nreflection at a surface with different morphology, which is important to a\nbetter understanding of thermal transport in various nanostructures.\n", "  We present inferences on the geometry and kinematics of the broad-Hbeta\nline-emitting region in four active galactic nuclei monitored as a part of the\nfall 2010 reverberation mapping campaign at MDM Observatory led by the Ohio\nState University. From modeling the continuum variability and response in\nemission-line profile changes as a function of time, we infer the geometry of\nthe Hbeta- emitting broad line regions to be thick disks that are close to\nface-on to the observer with kinematics that are well-described by either\nelliptical orbits or inflowing gas. We measure the black hole mass to be log\n(MBH) = 7.25 (+/-0.10) for Mrk 335, 7.86 (+0.20, -0.17) for Mrk 1501, 7.84\n(+0.14, -0.19) for 3C 120, and 6.92 (+0.24, -0.23) for PG 2130+099. These black\nhole mass measurements are not based on a particular assumed value of the\nvirial scale factor f, allowing us to compute individual f factors for each\ntarget. Our results nearly double the number of targets that have been modeled\nin this manner, and investigate the properties of a more diverse sample by\nincluding previously modeled objects. We measure an average scale factor f in\nthe entire sample to be log10(f) = 0.54 +/- 0.17 when the line dispersion is\nused to characterize the line width, which is consistent with values derived\nusing the normalization of the MBH-sigma relation. We find that the scale\nfactor f for individual targets is likely correlated with the black hole mass,\ninclination angle, and opening angle of the broad line region but we do not\nfind any correlation with the luminosity.\n", "  We discuss the implications of studies of partition function zeros and\nequimodular curves for the analytic properties of the Ising model on a square\nlattice in a magnetic field. In particular we consider the dense set of\nsingularities in the susceptibility of the Ising model at $H=0$ found by Nickel\nand its relation to the analyticity of the field theory computations of Fonseca\nand Zamolodchikov.\n", "  Controlled quantum systems such as ultracold atoms can provide powerful\nplatforms to study non-equilibrium dynamics of closed many-body quantum\nsystems, especially since a complete theoretical description is generally\nchallenging. In this Letter, we present a detailed study of the rich\nout-of-equilibrium dynamics of an adjustable number $N$ of uncorrelated\ncondensates after connecting them in a ring-shaped optical trap. We observe the\nformation of long-lived supercurrents and confirm the scaling of their winding\nnumber with $N$ in agreement with the geodesic rule. Moreover, we provide\ninsight into the microscopic mechanism that underlies the smoothening of the\nphase profile.\n", "  Understanding the controlling mechanisms underlying injection-induced\nseismicity is important for optimizing reservoir productivity and addressing\nseismicity-related concerns related to hydraulic stimulation in Enhanced\nGeothermal Systems. Hydraulic stimulation enhances permeability through\nelevated pressures, which cause normal deformations, and the shear slip of\npre-existing fractures. Previous experiments indicate that fracture deformation\nin the normal direction reverses as the pressure decreases, e.g., at the end of\nstimulation. We hypothesize that this normal closure of fractures enhances\npressure propagation away from the injection region and significantly increases\nthe potential for post-injection seismicity. To test this hypothesis, hydraulic\nstimulation is modeled by numerically coupling fracture deformation, pressure\ndiffusion and stress alterations for a synthetic geothermal reservoir in which\nthe flow and mechanics are strongly affected by a complex three-dimensional\nfracture network. The role of the normal closure of fractures is verified by\ncomparing simulations conducted with and without the normal closure effect.\n", "  The first precise localization of a fast radio burst (FRB), leading to an\nassociation with a low metallicity dwarf galaxy at $z=0.193$, has began to shed\nlight on the nature of these mysterious bursts and the physical mechanisms that\npower them. Increasing the sample of FRBs with robust host galaxy associations\nis the key impetus behind on-going and upcoming searches and facilities. Here,\nwe quantify the robustness of FRB-host galaxy associations as a function of\nlocalization area and galaxy apparent magnitude. We also explore the use of FRB\ndispersion measures to constrain the source redshift, thereby reducing the\nnumber of candidate hosts. We further use these results to demonstrate that\neven in the absence of a robust unique association, a constraint can be placed\non the maximum luminosity of a host galaxy as a function of localization area\nand DM. We examine these results in the context of existing and future FRB\nfacilities. We find that localizations of $\\lesssim 0.5''$ are required for a\nchance coincidence probability of $\\lesssim 1\\%$ for dwarf galaxies at\n$z\\gtrsim 0.1$; if some hosts have luminosities of $\\sim L^*$, then\nlocalizations of up to $\\approx 3''$ may suffice at $z\\sim 0.1$ (but $\\lesssim\n1''$ at $z\\approx 1$). Constraints on the redshift from the DM only marginally\nimprove the association probability, unless the DM is low, $\\lesssim 400$ pc\ncm$^{-3}$ ($z\\lesssim 0.5$). This approach also relies on the determination of\ngalaxy redshifts, which is challenging at $z\\gtrsim 0.5$ if the hosts are\ngenerally dwarf galaxies. Finally, interesting limits on the maximum host\nluminosity (for example, sufficient to demonstrate that the hosts are generally\ndwarf galaxies) require localizations of $\\lesssim 5''$ at $z\\gtrsim 0.1$. Even\na few such localizations will shed light on the nature of FRB progenitors,\ntheir possible diversity, and their use as cosmological tools.\n", "  We present a new model of the optical nebular emission from HII regions by\ncombin- ing the results of the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (bpass)\ncode with the photoion- ization code cloudy (Ferland et al. 1998). We explore a\nvariety of emission-line diagnostics of these star-forming HII regions and\nexamine the effects of metallicity and interacting binary evo- lution on the\nnebula emission-line production. We compare the line emission properties of HII\nregions with model stellar populations, and provide new constraints on their\nstellar populations and supernova progenitors. We find that models including\nmassive binary stars can successfully match all the observational constraints\nand provide reasonable age and mass estimation of the HII regions and supernova\nprogenitors.\n", "  In this theoretical work we investigate superexchange, as a means of indirect\nexchange interaction between two single electron spin qubits, each embedded in\na single semiconductor quantum dot (QD). The exchange interaction is mediated\nby an intermediate, empty QD. Our findings suggest the existence of first order\n\"super sweet spots\", in which the qubit operations implemented by superexchange\ninteraction are simultaneously insensitive to charge noise and errors due to\nspin-orbit interaction. We also find that the sign of the superexchange can be\nchanged by varying the energy detunings between the QDs.\n", "  The recent experimental realization of spin-orbit coupling for ultracold\natomic gases provides a powerful platform for exploring many interesting\nquantum phenomena. In these studies, spin represents spin vector (spin-1/2 or\nspin-1) and orbit represents linear momentum. Here we propose a scheme to\nrealize a new type of spin-tensor--momentum coupling (STMC) in spin-1 ultracold\natomic gases. We study the ground state properties of interacting Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) with STMC and find interesting new types of stripe\nsuperfluid phases and multicritical points for phase transitions. Furthermore,\nSTMC makes it possible to study quantum states with dynamical stripe orders\nthat display density modulation with a long tunable period and high visibility,\npaving the way for direct experimental observation of a new dynamical\nsupersolid-like state.. Our scheme for generating STMC can be generalized to\nother systems and may open the door for exploring novel quantum physics and\ndevice applications.\n", "  The cosmological black holes are black holes living not in an asymptotically\nflat universe but in an expanding spacetime. They have a rich dynamics in\nparticular for their mass and horizon. In this article we perform a natural\nstep in investigating this new type of black hole: we consider the possibility\nof a \\textit{charged} cosmological black hole. We derive the general equations\nof motion governing its dynamics and report a new analytic solution for the\nspecial case of the charged Lema\\^itre-Tolman-Bondi equations of motion that\ndescribe a charged cosmological black hole. We then study various relevant\nquantities for the characterization of the black hole such as the C-function,\nthe effect of the charge on the black hole flux and the nature of the\nsingularity. We also perform numerical investigations to strengthen our\nresults. Finally we challenge a model of gamma ray burst within our framework.\n", "  We here conjecture that two much-studied aspects of quantum gravity,\ndimensional flow and spacetime fuzziness, might be deeply connected. We\nillustrate the mechanism, providing first evidence in support of our\nconjecture, by working within the framework of multifractional theories, whose\nkey assumption is an anomalous scaling of the spacetime dimension in the\nultraviolet and a slow change of the dimension in the infrared. This sole\ningredient is enough to produce a scale-dependent deformation of the\nintegration measure with also a fuzzy spacetime structure. We also compare the\nmultifractional correction to lengths with the types of Planckian uncertainty\nfor distance and time measurements that was reported in studies combining\nquantum mechanics and general relativity heuristically. This allows us to fix\ntwo free parameters of the theory and leads, in one of the scenarios we\ncontemplate, to a value of the ultraviolet dimension which had already found\nsupport in other quantum-gravity analyses. We also formalize a picture such\nthat fuzziness originates from a fundamental discrete scale invariance at short\nscales and corresponds to a stochastic spacetime geometry.\n", "  Solutions of the forced Navier-Stokes equation have been conjectured to\nthermalize at scales larger than the forcing scale, similar to an absolute\nequilibrium obtained for the spectrally-truncated Euler equation. Using direct\nnumeric simulations of Taylor-Green flows and general-periodic helical flows,\nwe present results on the probability density function, energy spectrum,\nauto-correlation function and correlation time that compare the two systems. In\nthe case of highly helical flows, we derive an analytic expression describing\nthe correlation time for the absolute equilibrium of helical flows that is\ndifferent from the $E^{-1/2}k^{-1}$-scaling law of weakly helical flows. This\nmodel predicts a new helicity-based scaling law for the correlation time as\n$\\tau(k)\\sim H^{-1/2}k^{-1/2}$. This scaling law is verified in simulations of\nthe truncated Euler equation. In simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations the\nlarge scale modes of forced Taylor-Green symmetric flows (with zero total\nhelicity and large separation of scales) follow the same properties as absolute\nequilibrium including a $\\tau(k) \\sim E^{-1/2}k^{-1}$ scaling for the\ncorrelation time. General-periodic helical flows also show similarities between\nthe two systems, however the largest scales of the forced flows deviate from\nthe absolute equilibrium solutions.\n", "  We present the first study of the QCD corrections to the color-singlet (CS)\n$J/\\psi$ production in deeply inelastic $ep$ scattering at HERA. The $K$-factor\nranges from $0.85$ to $2.38$ in the kinematic regions we study. In low\ntransverse momentum regions, the $K$-factors is even smaller, and close to 1,\nwhich indicates good convergence of the perturbative expansion. With the QCD\ncorrections, the CS cross section is still below the data. At least at QCD\nnext-to-leading order, the color-octet mechanism is necessary to describe the\ndata.\n", "  Neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) around rotating stellar-mass black\nholes (BHs) are plausible candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs). NDAFs are hyperaccretion disks with accretion rates in the range\nof around 0.001-10 $M_\\odot ~\\rm s^{-1}$, which have high density and\ntemperature and therefore are extremely optically thick and geometrically slim\nor even thick. We review the theoretical progresses in studying the properties\nof NDAFs as well as their applications to the GRB phenomenology. The topics\ninclude: the steady radial and vertical structure of NDAFs and the implications\nfor calculating neutrino luminosity and annihilation luminosity, jet power due\nto neutrino-antineutrino annihilation and Blandford-Znajek mechanism and their\ndependences on parameters such as BH mass, spin, and accretion rate, time\nevolution of NDAFs, effect of magnetic fields, applications of NDAF theories to\nthe GRB phenomenology such as lightcurve variability, extended emission, X-ray\nflares, kilonovae, etc., as well as probing NDAFs using multi-messenger signals\nsuch as MeV neutrinos and gravitational waves.\n", "  We present a procedure for reconstructing the decision function of an\nartificial neural network as a simple function of the input, provided the\ndecision function is sufficiently symmetric. In this case one can easily deduce\nthe quantity by which the neural network classifies the input. The procedure is\nembedded into a pipeline of machine learning algorithms able to detect the\nexistence of different phases of matter, to determine the position of phase\ntransitions and to find explicit expressions of the physical quantities by\nwhich the algorithm distinguishes between phases. We assume no prior knowledge\nabout the Hamiltonian or the order parameters except Monte Carlo-sampled\nconfigurations. The method is applied to the Ising Model and SU(2) lattice\ngauge theory. In both systems we deduce the explicit expressions of the known\norder parameters from the decision functions of the neural networks.\n", "  We extend Noether's theorem to the setting of multisymplectic geometry by\nexhibiting a correspondence between conserved quantities and continuous\nsymmetries on a multi-Hamiltonian system. We show that a homotopy co-momentum\nmap interacts with this correspondence in a way analogous to the moment map in\nsymplectic geometry.\n  We apply our results to generalize the theory of the classical momentum and\nposition functions from the phase space of a given physical system to the\nmultisymplectic phase space. We also apply our results to manifolds with a\ntorsion-free $G_2$ structure.\n", "  Several theories of the glass transition propose that the structural\nrelaxation time {\\tau}{\\alpha} is controlled by a growing static length scale\n{\\xi} that is determined by the free energy landscape but not by the local\ndynamical rules governing its exploration. We argue, based on recent\nsimulations using particle-radius-swap dynamics, that only a modest factor in\nthe increase in {\\tau}{\\alpha} on approach to the glass transition may stem\nfrom the growth of a static length, with a vastly larger contribution\nattributable instead to a slowdown of local dynamics. This reinforces arguments\nthat we base on the observed strong coupling of particle diffusion and density\nfluctuations in real glasses\n", "  By applying invariant-based inverse engineering in the small-oscillations\nregime, we design the time dependence of the control parameters of an overhead\ncrane (trolley displacement and rope length), to transport a load between two\npositions at different heights with minimal final energy excitation for a\nmicrocanonical ensemble of initial conditions. The analogies between ion\ntransport in multisegmented traps or neutral atom transport in moving optical\nlattices and load manipulation by cranes opens a route for a useful transfer of\ntechniques among very different fields.\n", "  In weakly interacting organic semiconductors, static and dynamic disorder\noften have an important impact on transport properties. Describing charge\ntransport in these systems requires an approach that correctly takes structural\nand electronic fluctuations into account. Here, we present a multiscale method\nbased on a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, electronic structure\ncalculations, and a transport theory that uses time-dependent non-equilibrium\nGreen's functions. We apply the methodology to investigate the charge transport\nin C$_{60}$-containing self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), which are used in\norganic field-effect transistors.\n", "  A method to construct multi-indexed exceptional Laguerre polynomials using\nisospectral deformation technique and quantum Hamilton-Jacobi (QHJ) formalism\nis presented. We construct generalized superpotentials using singularity\nstructure analysis, which lead to rational potentials with multi-indexed\npolynomials as solutions. We explicitly construct such rational extensions of\nthe radial oscillator and their solutions, which involve exceptional Laguerre\northogonal polynomials having two indices. The exact expressions for the $L1$,\n$L2$ and $L3$ type polynomials, along with their weight functions are\npresented. We also discuss the possibility of constructing more rational\npotentials with interesting solutions.\n", "  We introduce ScannerBit, the statistics and sampling module of the public,\nopen-source global fitting framework GAMBIT. ScannerBit provides a standardised\ninterface to different sampling algorithms, enabling the use and comparison of\nmultiple computational methods for inferring profile likelihoods, Bayesian\nposteriors, and other statistical quantities. The current version offers\nrandom, grid, raster, nested sampling, differential evolution, Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) and ensemble Monte Carlo samplers. We also announce the\nrelease of a new standalone differential evolution sampler, Diver, and describe\nits design, usage and interface to ScannerBit. We subject Diver and three other\nsamplers (the nested sampler MultiNest, the MCMC GreAT, and the native\nScannerBit implementation of the ensemble Monte Carlo algorithm T-Walk) to a\nbattery of statistical tests. For this we use a realistic physical likelihood\nfunction, based on the scalar singlet model of dark matter. We examine the\nperformance of each sampler as a function of its adjustable settings, and the\ndimensionality of the sampling problem. We evaluate performance on four\nmetrics: optimality of the best fit found, completeness in exploring the\nbest-fit region, number of likelihood evaluations, and total runtime. For\nBayesian posterior estimation at high resolution, T-Walk provides the most\naccurate and timely mapping of the full parameter space. For profile likelihood\nanalysis in less than about ten dimensions, we find that Diver and MultiNest\nscore similarly in terms of best fit and speed, outperforming GreAT and T-Walk;\nin ten or more dimensions, Diver substantially outperforms the other three\nsamplers on all metrics.\n", "  We apply the first-principles density functional theory + dynamical mean\nfield theory framework to evaluate the crystal field splitting on rare earth\nsites in hard magnetic intermetallics. An atomic (Hubbard-I) approximation is\nemployed for local correlations on the rare earth 4$f$ shell and\nself-consistency in the charge density is implemented. We reduce the density\nfunctional theory self-interaction contribution to the crystal field splitting\nby properly averaging the 4$f$ charge density before recalculating the\none-electron Kohn-Sham potential. Our approach is shown to reproduce the\nexperimental crystal field splitting in the prototypical rare earth hard magnet\nSmCo$_5$. Applying it to $R$Fe$_{12}$ and $R$Fe$_{12}X$ hard magnets ($R=$Nd,\nSm and $X=$N, Li), we obtain in particular a large positive value of the\ncrystal field parameter $A_2^0\\langle r^2\\rangle$ in NdFe$_{12}$N resulting in\na strong out-of-plane anisotropy observed experimentally. The sign of\n$A_2^0\\langle r^2\\rangle$ is predicted to be reversed by substituting N with\nLi, leading to a strong out-of-plane anisotropy in SmFe$_{12}$Li. We discuss\nthe origin of this strong impact of N and Li interstitials on the crystal field\nsplitting on rare earth sites.\n", "  Quasi--local scalar variables approach is applied to a spherically symmetric\ninhomogeneous Lema\\^\\i tre--Tolman--Bondi metric containing a mixture of\nnon-relativistic cold dark matter and coupled dark energy with constant\nequation of state. The quasi--local coupling term considered is proportional to\nthe quasi--local cold dark matter energy density and a quasi--local Hubble\nfactor-like scalar via a coupling constant $\\alpha$. The autonomous numerical\nsystem obtained from the evolution equations is classified for different\nchoices of the free parameters: the adiabatic constant of the dark energy $w$\nand $\\alpha$. The presence of a past attractor in a non-physical region of the\nenergy densities phase-space of the system makes the coupling term non physical\nwhen the energy flows from the matter to the dark energy in order to avoid\nnegative values of the dark energy density in the past. On the other hand, if\nthe energy flux goes from dark energy to dark matter, the past attractor lays\nin a physical region. The system is also numerically solved for some\ninteresting initial profiles leading to different configurations: an ever\nexpanding mixture, a scenario where the dark energy is completely consumed by\nthe non-relativistic matter by means of the coupling term, a scenario where the\ndark energy disappears in the inner layers while the outer layers expand as a\nmixture of both sources, and, finally, a structure formation toy model\nscenario, where the inner shells containing the mixture collapse while the\nouter shells expand.\n", "  In this paper we present a hydrodynamic model to describe the dynamics of\npara- and orthoexcitons in cuprous oxide at ultralow temperatures inside a\nstress induced potential trap. We take into account the finite lifetime of the\nexcitons, the excitation process and exciton-phonon as well as exciton-exciton\ninteraction. Furthermore, we model the two-body loss mechanism assuming an\nAuger-like effect and compare it to an alternative explanation which relies on\nthe formation of biexcitons. We discuss in detail the influence on the\nnumerical results and compare the predictions to experimental data.\n", "  A future Electron Ion Collider (EIC) will be able to provide collisions of\npolarized electrons with protons and heavy ions over a wide range of\ncenter-of-mass energies (20 $\\mathrm{GeV}$ to 140 $\\mathrm{GeV}$) at an\ninstanteous luminosity of $10^{33} - 10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. One of its\npromising physics programs is the study of the partonic structure of quasi-real\nphotons. Measuring di-jets in quasi-real photoproduction events, one can\neffectively access the underlying parton dynamics of the photons. In this\npaper, we discuss the feasibility of tagging resolved photon processes and\nmeasuring the di-jet cross section as a function of jet transverse momentum in\nthe range of $0.01<x_{\\gamma}^{rec}<1$ at an EIC. It will be shown that both\nunpolarized and polarized parton distributions in the photon can be extracted,\nand that the flavor of the parton can be tagged at an EIC.\n", "  Here we report small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements and\ntheoretical modeling of U$_3$Al$_2$Ge$_3$. Analysis of the SANS data reveals a\nphase transition to sinusoidally modulated magnetic order, at\n$T_{\\mathrm{N}}=63$~K to be second order, and a first order phase transition to\nferromagnetic order at $T_{\\mathrm{c}}=48$~K. Within the sinusoidally modulated\nmagnetic phase ($T_{\\mathrm{c}} < T < T_{\\mathrm{N}}$), we uncover a dramatic\nchange, by a factor of three, in the ordering wave-vector as a function of\ntemperature. These observations all indicate that U$_3$Al$_2$Ge$_3$ is a close\nrealization of the three-dimensional Axial Next-Nearest-Neighbor Ising model, a\nprototypical framework for describing commensurate to incommensurate phase\ntransitions in frustrated magnets.\n", "  Metamaterial analogues of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) have\nbeen intensively studied and widely employed for slow light and enhanced\nnonlinear effects. In particular, the active modulation of the EIT analogue and\nwell-controlled group delay in metamaterials have shown great prospects in\noptical communication networks. Previous studies have focused on the optical\ncontrol of the EIT analogue by integrating the photoactive materials into the\nunit cell, however, the response time is limited by the recovery time of the\nexcited carriers in these bulk materials. Graphene has recently emerged as an\nexceptional optoelectronic material. It shows an ultrafast relaxation time on\nthe order of picosecond and its conductivity can be tuned via manipulating the\nFermi energy. Here we integrate a monolayer graphene into metal-based terahertz\n(THz) metamaterials, and realize a complete modulation in the resonance\nstrength of the EIT analogue at the accessible Fermi energy. The physical\nmechanism lies in the active tuning the damping rate of the dark mode resonator\nthrough the recombination effect of the conductive graphene. Note that the\nmonolayer morphology in our work is easier to fabricate and manipulate than\nisolated fashion. This work presents a novel modulation strategy of the EIT\nanalogue in the hybrid metamaterials, and pave the way towards designing very\ncompact slow light devices to meet future demand of ultrafast optical signal\nprocessing.\n", "  The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) or nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation relevant to\nultracold atomic gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates possess a modified\nSchr\\\"odinger symmetry in two spatial dimensions, in the presence of a harmonic\ntrapping potential, an (artificial) constant magnetic field (or rotation) and\nan electric field of a quadratic electrostatic potential. We find that a\nvariance and a center of a trapped gas with or without a vorticity can be\nregarded as massive Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with spontaneous\nbreaking of the modified Schr\\\"odinger symmetry. We show that the Noether\ntheorem for the modified Schr\\\"odinger symmetry gives universal equations of\nmotion which describe exact time-evolutions of the trapped gases such as a\nharmonic oscillation, a cyclotron motion and a breathing oscillation with\nfrequencies determined by the symmetry independently of the details of the\nsystem. We further construct an exact effective action for all the NG modes.\n", "  We show that magnetic zero-modes of the Dirac operator on $\\mathbb{R}^3$\nwhich obey an additional non-linear equation are closely related to vortex\nconfigurations on the 2-sphere, and that both are best understood in terms of\nthe geometry induced on the 3-sphere via pull-back of the round geometry with\nbundle maps of the Hopf fibration. We use this viewpoint to deduce a manifestly\nsmooth formula for square-integrable magnetic zero-modes in terms of two\nhomogeneous polynomials in two complex variables.\n", "  Dynamic scaling analyses of linear and nonlinear ac susceptibilities in a\nmodel magnet of the long-rang RKKY Ising spin glass (SG)\nDy$_{x}$Y$_{1-x}$Ru$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ were examined. The obtained set of the\ncritical exponents, $\\gamma$ $\\sim$ 1, $\\beta$ $\\sim$ 1, $\\delta$ $\\sim$ 2, and\n$z\\nu$ $\\sim$ 3.4, indicates the SG phase transition belongs to a different\nuniversality class from either the canonical (Heisenberg) or the short-range\nIsing SGs. The analyses also reveal a finite-temperature SG transition with the\nsame critical exponents under a magnetic field and the phase transition line\n$T_{\\mbox{g}}(H)$ described by $T_{\\mbox{g}}(H)$ $=$\n$T_{\\mbox{g}}(0)(1-AH^{2/\\phi})$ with $\\phi$ $\\sim$ 2. The crossover exponent\n$\\phi$ obeys the scaling relation $\\phi$ $=$ $\\gamma + \\beta$ within the margin\nof errors. These results strongly suggest the spontaneous\nreplica-symmetry-breaking (RSB) with a {\\it non- or marginal-mean-field\nuniversality class} in the long-range RKKY Ising SG.\n", "  We study the z=0 gas kinematics, morphology, and angular momentum content of\nisolated galaxies in a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE\nproject spanning $M_{\\star}=10^{6-11}M_{\\odot}$. Gas becomes increasingly\nrotationally supported with increasing galaxy mass. In the lowest-mass galaxies\n($M_{\\star}<10^{8}M_{\\odot}$), gas fails to form a morphological disk and is\nprimarily dispersion and pressure supported. At intermediate masses\n($M_{\\star}=10^{8-10}M_{\\odot}$), galaxies display a wide range of gas\nkinematics and morphologies, from thin, rotating disks, to irregular spheroids\nwith negligible net rotation. All the high-mass\n($M_{\\star}=10^{10-11}M_{\\odot}$) galaxies form rotationally supported gas\ndisks. Many of the halos whose galaxies fail to form disks harbor high angular\nmomentum gas in their circumgalactic medium. The ratio of the specific angular\nmomentum of gas in the central galaxy to that of the dark-matter halo increases\nsignificantly with galaxy mass, from $j_{\\rm gas}/j_{\\rm DM}\\sim0.1$ at\n$M_{\\star}=10^{6-7}M_{\\odot}$ to $j_{\\rm gas}/j_{\\rm DM}\\sim2$ at\n$M_{\\star}=10^{10-11}M_{\\odot}$. The reduced rotational support in the\nlowest-mass galaxies owes to (a) stellar feedback and the UV background\nsuppressing the accretion of high-angular momentum gas at late times, and (b)\nstellar feedback driving large non-circular gas motions. We broadly reproduce\nthe observed scaling relations between galaxy mass, gas rotation velocity,\nsize, and angular momentum, but may somewhat underpredict the incidence of\ndisky, high-angular momentum galaxies at the lowest observed masses\n($M_{\\star}=(10^{6}-2\\times10^{7})M_{\\odot}$). In our simulations, stars are\nuniformly less rotationally supported than gas. The common assumption that\nstars follow the same rotation curve as gas thus substantially overestimates\ngalaxies' stellar angular momentum, particularly at low masses.\n", "  There is ongoing interest in adopting various tools and ideas from general\nrelativity for optical applications and the study of light propagation through\nnatural or engineered media. Here, the covariant kinematics of light\npropagating through arbitrary dielectric media in curved space-times are\nderived, allowing for analysis and tracing of congruences of light through\nmedia that may smoothly vary in character between vacuum, positively\nrefracting, and negatively refracting; or null, timelike, and spacelike with\nrespect to the background metric. The kinematics are then used to generalize\nthe Raychaudhuri equation -- an important tool in general relativity that\ndescribes the focus of a congruence. These results will be useful for the\nanalysis of optical devices, particularly those designed using transformation\noptics, and serve as theoretical tools to study generalized concepts in general\nrelativity.\n", "  In dynamical systems, the full stability of fixed point solutions is\ndetermined by their basin of attraction. Characterizing the structure of these\nbasins is, in general, a complicated task, especially in high dimensionality.\nRecent works have advocated to quantify the non-linear stability of fixed\npoints of dynamical systems through the relative volumes of the associated\nbasins of attraction [D. A. Wiley {\\it et al.} Chaos {\\bf 16}, 015103 (2006),\nP. J. Menck {\\it et al.} Nat. Phys. {\\bf 9}, 89 (2013)]. Here we revisit this\nissue and propose an efficient numerical method to estimate these volumes. The\nalgorithm first identifies stable fixed points. Second, a set of initial\nconditions is considered that are randomly distributed at the surface of\nhypercubes centered on each fixed point. These initial conditions are\ndynamically evolved. The linear size of each basin of attraction is finally\ndetermined by the proportion of initial conditions which converge back to the\nfixed point. Armed with this algorithm, we revisit the problem considered by\nWiley et al. in a seminal paper [D. A. Wiley {\\it et al.} Chaos {\\bf 16},\n015103 (2006)] that inspired the title of the present manuscript, and consider\nthe equal-frequency Kuramoto model on a cycle. Fixed points of this model are\ncharacterized by an integer winding number $q$ and the number $n$ of\noscillators. We find that the basin volumes scale as $(1-4q/n)^n$, contrasting\nwith the Gaussian behavior postulated in Wiley et al.'s paper. Finally, we show\nthe applicability of our method to complex models of coupled oscillators with\ndifferent natural frequencies and on meshed networks.\n", "  We construct the symmetric-gapped surface states of a fractional topological\ninsulator with electromagnetic $\\theta$-angle $\\theta_{em} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and\na discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ gauge field. They are the proper generalizations of\nthe T-pfaffian state and pfaffian/anti-semion state and feature an extended\nperiodicity compared with their of \"integer\" topological band insulators\ncounterparts. We demonstrate that the surface states have the correct anomalies\nassociated with time-reversal symmetry and charge conservation.\n", "  We present multiband photometry of 60 spectroscopically-confirmed supernovae\n(SN): 39 SN II/IIP, 19 IIn, one IIb and one that was originally classified as a\nIIn but later as a Ibn. Forty-six have only optical photometry, six have only\nnear infrared (NIR) photometry and eight have both optical and NIR. The median\nredshift of the sample is 0.016. We also present 192 optical spectra for 47 of\nthe 60 SN. All data are publicly available. There are 26 optical and two NIR\nlight curves of SN II/IIP with redshifts z > 0.01, some of which may give rise\nto useful distances for cosmological applications. All photometry was obtained\nbetween 2000 and 2011 at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO), via the\n1.2m and 1.3m PAIRITEL telescopes for the optical and NIR, respectively. Each\nSN was observed in a subset of the $u'UBVRIr'i'JHK_s$ bands. There are a total\nof 2932 optical and 816 NIR light curve points. Optical spectra were obtained\nusing the FLWO 1.5m Tillinghast telescope with the FAST spectrograph and the\nMMT Telescope with the Blue Channel Spectrograph. Our photometry is in\nreasonable agreement with other samples from the literature. Comparison with\nPan-STARRS shows that two-thirds of our individual star sequences have\nweighted-mean V offsets within $\\pm$0.02 mag. In comparing our standard-system\nSN light curves with common Carnegie Supernova Project objects using their\ncolor terms, we found that roughly three-quarters have average differences\nwithin $\\pm$0.04 mag. The data from this work and the literature will provide\ninsight into SN II explosions, help with developing methods for photometric SN\nclassification, and contribute to their use as cosmological distance\nindicators.\n", "  The dynamical systems found in Nature are rarely isolated. Instead they\ninteract and influence each other. The coupling functions that connect them\ncontain detailed information about the functional mechanisms underlying the\ninteractions and prescribe the physical rule specifying how an interaction\noccurs. Here, we aim to present a coherent and comprehensive review\nencompassing the rapid progress made recently in the analysis, understanding\nand applications of coupling functions. The basic concepts and characteristics\nof coupling functions are presented through demonstrative examples of different\ndomains, revealing the mechanisms and emphasizing their multivariate nature.\nThe theory of coupling functions is discussed through gradually increasing\ncomplexity from strong and weak interactions to globally-coupled systems and\nnetworks. A variety of methods that have been developed for the detection and\nreconstruction of coupling functions from measured data is described. These\nmethods are based on different statistical techniques for dynamical inference.\nStemming from physics, such methods are being applied in diverse areas of\nscience and technology, including chemistry, biology, physiology, neuroscience,\nsocial sciences, mechanics and secure communications. This breadth of\napplication illustrates the universality of coupling functions for studying the\ninteraction mechanisms of coupled dynamical systems.\n", "  This is a tutorial-style selective review explaining basic concepts of forced\nmagnetic reconnection. It is based on a celebrated model of forced reconnection\nsuggested by J. B. Taylor. The standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory of\nthis process has been pioneered by Hahm & Kulsrud (Phys. Fluids 28, 2412,\n1985). Here we also discuss several more recent developments related to this\nproblem. These include energetics of forced reconnection, its Hall-mediated\nregime, and nonlinear effects with the associated onset of the secondary\ntearing (plasmoid) instability.\n", "  By means of Bayesian techniques, we study how a premature ending of\ninflation, motivated by geometrical destabilization, affects the observational\nevidences of typical inflationary models. Large field models are worsened, and\ninflection point potentials are drastically improved for a specific range of\nthe field-space curvature characterizing the geometrical destabilization. For\nother models we observe shifts in the preferred values of the model parameters.\nFor quartic hilltop models for instance, contrary to the standard case, we find\npreference for theoretically natural sub-Planckian hill widths. Eventually, the\nBayesian ranking of models becomes substantially reordered with a premature end\nof inflation. Such a phenomenon also modifies the constraints on the reheating\nexpansion history, which has to be properly accounted for since it determines\nthe position of the observational window with respect to the end of inflation.\nOur results demonstrate how the interpretation of cosmological data in terms of\nfundamental physics is considerably modified in the presence of premature end\nof inflation mechanisms.\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo simulations offer an unbiased means to study the static\nand dynamic properties of quantum critical systems, while quantum field theory\nprovides direct analytical results. We study three dimensional, critical\nquantum antiferromagnets by performing a combined analysis using both quantum\nfield theory calculations and quantum Monte Carlo data. Explicitly, we analyze\nthe order parameter (staggered magnetization), N\\'eel temperature,\nquasiparticle gaps, and the susceptibilities in the scalar and vector channels.\nWe connect the two approaches by deriving descriptions of the quantum Monte\nCarlo observables in terms of the quasiparticle excitations of the field\ntheory. The remarkable agreement not only unifies the description of the static\nand dynamic properties of the system, but also constitutes a thorough test of\nperturbative O(3) quantum field theory and opens new avenues for the analytical\nguidance of detailed numerical studies.\n", "  High storage density and high data rate are two of the most desired\nproperties of modern hard disk drives. Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR)\nis believed to achieve both. Recording media, consisting of exchange coupled\ngrains with a high and a low $T_{\\mathrm{C}}$ part, were shown to have low DC\nnoise, but increased AC noise, compared to hard magnetic single phase grains,\nlike FePt [1]. In this work we extensively investigate the influence of an FeRh\ninterlayer on the magnetic noise in exchange coupled grains. We find an optimal\ngrain design that reduces the jitter in down-track direction by up to 30 % and\nin off-track direction by up to 50 %, depending on the head velocity, compared\nto the same structures without FeRh. Further, the mechanisms causing this\njitter reduction are demonstrated. Additionally, we show that for ultrashort\nheat pulses and low write temperatures the switching time distribution of the\nanalyzed grain structure is reduced by a factor of four, compared to the same\nstructure without FeRh layer. This feature could be interesting for HAMR with a\npulsed laser spot and could resume the discussion about this HAMR technique.\n", "  We investigate the baryon number susceptibilities up to fourth order along\ndifferent freeze-out lines in a holographic QCD model with the critical end\npoint (CEP), and we propose that the peaked baryon number susceptibilities\nalong the freeze-out line can be used as a clean signature to locate the CEP in\nthe QCD phase diagram. On the temperature and baryon chemical potential plane,\nthe ratio of the baryon number susceptibilities (up to fourth order) forms a\nridge along the phase boundary, and develops a sword shape mountain standing\nupright around the CEP in a narrow and oblate region. This feature is model\nindependent and universal if the CEP exists. The measurement of the baryon\nnumber susceptibilities from heavy-ion collision experiment is along the\nfreeze-out line. If the freeze-out line crosses the foot of the CEP mountain,\nthen one can observe the peaked baryon number susceptibilities along the\nfreeze-out line, and the kurtosis of the baryon number distributions has the\ntallest magnitude. The data from the first phase of beam energy scan program at\nthe Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions indicates that a peak of the kurtosis of\nthe baryon number distribution would show up at the collision energy around 5\nGeV, which suggests that the freeze-out line crosses the foot of the CEP\nmountain and the summit of the CEP would be located nearby around the collision\nenergy of 3 GeV.\n", "  Many-body systems with multiple emergent time scales arise in various\ncontexts, including classical critical systems, correlated quantum materials,\nand ultra-cold atoms. We investigate such non-trivial quantum dynamics in a new\nsetting: a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain. It has a solvable entangled\ngroundstate, but a gapless excitation spectrum that is poorly understood. By\nusing large-scale DMRG simulations, we find that the lowest excitations have a\ndynamical exponent $z$ that varies from 2 to 3.2 as we vary a coupling in the\nHamiltonian. We find an additional gapless mode with a continuously varying\nexponent $2\\leq z <2.7$, which establishes the presence of multiple dynamics.\nIn order to explain these striking properties, we construct a continuum\nwavefunction for the groundstate, which correctly describes the correlations\nand entanglement properties. We also give a continuum parent Hamiltonian, but\nshow that additional ingredients are needed to capture the excitations of the\nchain. By using an exact mapping to the non-equilibrium dynamics of a classical\nspin chain, we find that the large dynamical exponent is due to subdiffusive\nspin motion. Finally, we discuss the connections to other spin chains and to a\nfamily of quantum critical models in 2d.\n", "  A puzzling excess in gamma-rays at GeV energies has been observed in the\ncenter of our galaxy using Fermi-LAT data. Its origin is still unknown, but it\nis well fitted by Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) annihilations\ninto quarks with a cross section around $10^{-26}{\\rm cm^3 s^{-1}}$ with masses\nof $20-50$~GeV, scenario which is promptly revisited. An excess favoring\nsimilar WIMP properties has also been seen in anti-protons with AMS-02 data\npotentially coming from the Galactic Center as well. In this work, we explore\nthe possibility of fitting these excesses in terms of semi-annihilating dark\nmatter, dubbed as semi-Hooperon, with the process ${\\rm WIMP\\, WIMP \\rightarrow\nWIMP\\, X}$ being responsible for the gamma-ray excess, where X=h,Z. An\ninteresting feature of semi-annihilations is the change in the relic density\nprediction compared to the standard case, and the possibility to alleviate\nstringent limits stemming from direct detection searches. Moreover, we discuss\nwhich models might give rise to a successful semi-Hooperon setup in the context\nof $\\mathcal{Z}_3$,$\\mathcal{Z}_4$ and extra \"dark\" gauge symmetries.\n", "  Ultracold Fermi atoms confined in optical lattices coupled to quantized modes\nof an optical cavity are an ideal scenario to engineer quantum simulators in\nthe strongly interacting regime. The system has both short range and cavity\ninduced long range interactions. We propose such a scheme to investigate the\ncoexistence of superfluid pairing, density order and quantum domains having an-\ntiferromagnetic or density order in the Hubbard model in a high finesse optical\ncavity at T = 0. We demonstrate that those phases can be accessed by properly\ntuning the linear polarizer of an external pump beam via the cavity back-action\neffect, while modulating the system doping. This allows emulate the typical\nscenarios of analog strongly correlated electronic systems.\n", "  Influenza remains a significant burden on health systems. Effective responses\nrely on the timely understanding of the magnitude and the evolution of an\noutbreak. For monitoring purposes, data on severe cases of influenza in England\nare reported weekly to Public Health England. These data are both readily\navailable and have the potential to provide valuable information to estimate\nand predict the key transmission features of seasonal and pandemic influenza.\nWe propose an epidemic model that links the underlying unobserved influenza\ntransmission process to data on severe influenza cases. Within a Bayesian\nframework, we infer retrospectively the parameters of the epidemic model for\neach seasonal outbreak from 2012 to 2015, including: the effective reproduction\nnumber; the initial susceptibility; the probability of admission to intensive\ncare given infection; and the effect of school closure on transmission. The\nmodel is also implemented in real time to assess whether early forecasting of\nthe number of admission to intensive care is possible. Our model of admissions\ndata allows reconstruction of the underlying transmission dynamics revealing:\nincreased transmission during the season 2013/14 and a noticeable effect of\nChristmas school holiday on disease spread during season 2012/13 and 2014/15.\nWhen information on the initial immunity of the population is available,\nforecasts of the number of admissions to intensive care can be substantially\nimproved. Readily available severe case data can be effectively used to\nestimate epidemiological characteristics and to predict the evolution of an\nepidemic, crucially allowing real-time monitoring of the transmission and\nseverity of the outbreak.\n", "  We investigate the ground-state properties and the collective modes of a\ntwo-dimensional two-component Rydberg-dressed Fermi liquid in the\ndipole-blockade regime. We find instability of the homogeneous system toward\nphase separated and density ordered phases, using the Hartree-Fock and\nrandom-phase approximations, respectively. The spectral weight of collective\ndensity oscillations in the homogenous phase also signals the emergence of\ndensity-wave instability. We examine the effect of exchange-hole on the\ndensity-wave instability and on the collective mode dispersion using the\nHubbard local-field factor.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate room-temperature storage of quantum\nentanglement using two nuclear spins weakly coupled to the electronic spin\ncarried by a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We realize universal\nquantum gate control over the three-qubit spin system and produce entangled\nstates encoded within the decoherence-free subspace of the two nuclear spins.\nBy injecting arbitrary collective noise, we demonstrate that the\ndecoherence-free entangled state has coherence time longer than that of other\nentangled states by an order of magnitude in our experiment.\n", "  We explain how the calculations of arXiv:1704.08648, which provided the first\nevidence for non-trivial structures of Gaussian correlators in tensor models,\nare efficiently performed with the help of the (Hurwitz) character calculus.\nThis emphasizes a close similarity between technical methods in matrix and\ntensor models and supports a hope to understand the emerging structures in very\nsimilar terms. We claim that the $2m$-fold Gaussian correlators of rank $r$\ntensors are given by $r$-linear combinations of dimensions with the Young\ndiagrams of size $m$. The coefficients are made from the characters of the\nsymmetric group $S_m$ and their exact form depends on the symmetries of the\nmodel. As the simplest application of this new knowledge, we provide simple\nexpressions for correlators in the Aristotelian tensor model as tri-linear\ncombinations of dimensions.\n", "  State-of-the-art methods for sensing weak AC fields are only efficient in the\nlow frequency domain (< 10 MHz). The inefficiency of sensing high frequency\nsignals is due to the lack of ability to use dynamical decoupling. In this\npaper we show that dynamical decoupling can be incorporated into high frequency\nsensing schemes and by this we demonstrate that the high sensitivity achieved\nfor low frequency can be extended to the whole spectrum. While our scheme is\ngeneral and suitable to a variety of atomic and solid-state systems, we\nexperimentally demonstrate it with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. For\na diamond with natural abundance of $^{13}$C we achieve coherence times up to\n1.43 ms resulting in a smallest detectable magnetic field strength of 4 nT at\n1.6 GHz. Attributed to the inherent nature of our scheme, we observe an\nadditional increase in coherence time due to the signal itself.\n", "  Foreshock transients upstream of Earth's bow shock have been recently\nobserved to accelerate electrons to many times their thermal energy. How such\nacceleration occurs is unknown, however. Using THEMIS case studies, we examine\na subset of acceleration events (31 of 247 events) in foreshock transients with\ncores that exhibit gradual electron energy increases accompanied by low\nbackground magnetic field strength and large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations.\nUsing the evolution of electron distributions and the energy increase rates at\nmultiple spacecraft, we suggest that Fermi acceleration between a converging\nforeshock transient's compressional boundary and the bow shock is responsible\nfor the observed electron acceleration. We then show that a one-dimensional\ntest particle simulation of an ideal Fermi acceleration model in fluctuating\nfields prescribed by the observations can reproduce the observed evolution of\nelectron distributions, energy increase rate, and pitch-angle isotropy,\nproviding further support for our hypothesis. Thus, Fermi acceleration is\nlikely the principal electron acceleration mechanism in at least this subset of\nforeshock transient cores.\n", "  We study spreading of a non-motile bacteria colony on a hard agar plate by\nusing agent-based and continuum models. We show that the spreading dynamics\ndepends on the initial nutrient concentration, the motility and the inherent\ndemographic noise. Population fluctuations are inherent in an agent based model\nwhereas, for the continuum model we model them by using a stochastic Langevin\nequation. We show that the intrinsic population fluctuations coupled with\nnon-linear diffusivity lead to a transition from Diffusion Limited Aggregation\n(DLA) type morphology to an Eden-like morphology on decreasing the initial\nnutrient concentration.\n", "  We present a new set of horizontal-branch (HB) models computed with the MESA\nstellar evolution code. The models adopt $\\alpha$-enhanced \\cite{ags09} metals\nmixtures and include the gravitational settling of He. They are used in our HB\npopulation synthesis tool to generate theoretical distributions of HB stars in\norder to describe the multiple stellar populations in the globular clusters\n47Tuc, M3, and M13. The observed HB in 47Tuc is reproduced very well by our\nsimulations for [Fe/H] $= -0.70$ and [$\\alpha$/Fe] $= +0.4$ if the initial\nhelium mass fraction varies by $\\Delta Y_0 \\sim 0.03$ and approximately 21%,\n37%, and 42% of the stars have $Y_0 = 0.257$, 0.270, and 0.287, respectively.\nThese simulations yield $(m-M)_V = 13.27$, implying an age near 13.0 Gyr. In\nthe case of M3 and M13, our synthetic HBs for [Fe/H] $= -1.55$ and\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] $= 0.4$ match the observed ones quite well if M3 has $\\Delta Y_0\n\\sim 0.01$ and $(m-M)_V = 15.02$, resulting in an age of 12.6 Gyr, whereas M13\nhas $\\Delta Y_0 \\sim 0.08$ and $(m-M)_V = 14.42$, implying an age of 12.9 Gyr.\nMass loss during giant-branch evolution and $\\Delta Y_0$ appear to be the\nprimary second parameters for M3 and M13. New observations for 7 of the 9 known\nRR Lyrae in M13 are also reported. Surprisingly, periods predicted for the\n$c$-type variables tend to be too high (by up to $\\sim 0.1$~d).\n", "  We examine the dynamics of a neutral particle around a Kerr-Newman black\nhole, and in particular focus on the effects of the charge of the spinning\nblack hole on the motion of the particle. We first consider the innermost\nstable circular orbits (ISCO) on the equatorial plane. It is found that the\npresence of the charge of the black hole leads to the effective potential of\nthe particle with stronger repulsive effects as compared with the Kerr black\nhole. As a result, the radius of ISCO decreases as charge $Q$ of the black hole\nincreases for a fixed value of black hole's angular momentum $a$. We then\nconsider a kick on the particle from its initial orbit out of the equatorial\nmotion. The perturbed motion of the particle will eventually be bounded, or\nunbounded so that it escapes to spatial infinity. Even more, the particle will\nlikely be captured by the black hole. Thus we analytically and numerically\ndetermine the parameter regions of the corresponding motions, in terms of the\ninitial radius of the orbital motion and the strength of the kick. The\ncomparison will be made with the motion of a neutral particle in the Kerr black\nhole.\n", "  The theoretical description of the thermodynamics of water is challenged by\nthe structural transition towards tetrahedral symmetry at ambient conditions.\nAs perturbation theories typically assume a spherically symmetric reference\nfluid, they are incapable of accurately describing the liquid properties of\nwater at ambient conditions. In this paper we solve this problem, by\nintroducing the concept of an associated reference perturbation theory (APT).\nIn APT we treat the reference fluid as an associating hard sphere fluid which\ntransitions to tetrahedral symmetry in the fully hydrogen bonded limit. We\ncalculate this transition in a theoretically self-consistent manner without\nappealing to molecular simulations. This associated reference provides the\nreference fluid for a second order Barker-Hendersen perturbative treatment of\nthe long-range attractions. We demonstrate that this new approach gives a\nsignificantly improved description of water as compared to standard\nperturbation theories.\n", "  We present a numerical study of rotational dynamics in AdS$_5$ with equal\nangular momenta in the presence of a complex doublet scalar field. We determine\nthat the endpoint of gravitational collapse is a Myers-Perry black hole for\nhigh energies and a hairy black hole for low energies. We investigate the\ntimescale for collapse at low energies $E$, keeping the angular momenta\n$J\\propto E$ in AdS length units. We find that the inclusion of angular momenta\ndelays the collapse time, but retains a $t\\sim1/E$ scaling. We perturb and\nevolve rotating boson stars, and find that boson stars near AdS appear stable,\nbut those sufficiently far from AdS are unstable. We find that the dynamics of\nthe boson star instability depend on the perturbation, resulting either in\ncollapse to a Myers-Perry black hole, or development towards a stable\noscillating solution.\n", "  We consider the phantom braneworld model in the context of the maximum turn\naround radius, $R_{\\rm TA,max}$, of a stable, spherical cosmic structure with a\ngiven mass. The maximum turn around radius is the point where the attraction\ndue to the central inhomogeneity gets balanced with the repulsion of the\nambient dark energy, beyond which a structure cannot hold any mass, thereby\ngiving the maximum upper bound on the size of a stable structure. In this work\nwe derive an analytical expression of $R_{\\rm TA,max}$ for this model using\ncosmological scalar perturbation theory. Using this we numerically constrain\nthe parameter space, including a bulk cosmological constant and the Weyl fluid,\nfrom the mass versus observed size data for some nearby, non-virial cosmic\nstructures. We use different values of the matter density parameter $\\Omega_m$,\nboth larger and smaller than that of the $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$, as the input in\nour analysis. We show in particular, that a) with a vanishing bulk cosmological\nconstant the predicted upper bound is always greater than what is actually\nobserved; similar conclusion holds if the bulk cosmological constant is\nnegative b) if it is positive, the predicted maximum size can go considerably\nbelow than what is actually observed and owing to the involved nature of the\nfield equations, it leads to interesting constraints on not only the bulk\ncosmological constant itself but on the whole parameter space of the theory.\n", "  The electron-positron annihilation into two photons is a standard technology\nin medicine to observe e.g. metabolic processes in human bodies. A new\ntomograph will provide the possibility to observe not only direct $e^+ e^-$\nannihilations but also the $3$ photons from the decay of ortho-positronium\natoms formed in the body. We show in this contribution that the three-photon\nstate with respect to polarisation degrees of freedom depends on the angles\nbetween the photons and exhibits various specific entanglement features. In\nparticular genuine multipartite entanglement, a type of entanglement involving\nall degrees of freedoms, is subsistent if the positronium was in a definite\nspin eigenstate. Remarkably, when all spin eigenstates are mixed equally,\nentanglement --and even stronger genuine multipartite entanglement-- survives.\nDue to a \"\\textit{symmetrization}\" process, however, $Dicke$-type of\nentanglement remains whereas $GHZ$-type of entanglement vanishes. The survival\nof particular entanglement properties in the mixing scenario may make it\npossible to extract quantum information in form of distinct entanglement\nfeatures, e.g., from metabolic processes in human bodies.\n", "  Photoassociation of ultracold atoms is shown to lead to alignment of the\nproduct molecules along the excitation laser polarization axis. We\ntheoretically investigate pulsed photoassociation of $^{87}Rb$ atoms into a\nspecific weakly-bound level of the a $^3\\Sigma_u^+$ metastable electronic state\nand find both stationary and time-dependent field-free alignment. Although a\ntransform-limited pulse yields significant alignment, a frequency-chirped pulse\ndramatically enhances the molecular formation rate at the cost of a slight\ndecrease in the alignment. Employing multiple pulses synchronized with the\nvibrational and rotational periods leads to coherent enhancement of both\npopulation and alignment of the target state.\n", "  One of the open questions in modern cosmology is the small scale crisis of\nthe cold dark matter paradigm. Increasing attention has recently been devoted\nto self-interacting dark matter models as a possible answer. However, solving\nthe so-called \"missing satellites\" problem requires in addition the presence of\nan extra relativistic particle (dubbed dark radiation) scattering with dark\nmatter in the early universe. Here we investigate the impact of different\ntheoretical models devising dark matter dark radiation interactions on large\nscale cosmological observables. We use cosmic microwave background data to put\nconstraints on the dark radiation component and its coupling to dark matter. We\nfind that the values of the coupling allowed by the data imply a cut-off scale\nof the halo mass function consistent with the one required to match the\nobservations of satellites in the Milky Way.\n", "  We derive a minimal continuum model to investigate the hydrodynamic mechanism\nbehind the fingering instability recently discovered in a suspension of\nmicrorollers near a floor [Driscoll et al. Nature Physics, 2016]. Our model,\nconsisting of two continuous lines of rotlets, exhibits a linear instability\ndriven only by hydrodynamics interactions, and reproduces the lengthscale\nselection observed in large scale particle simulations and in experiments. By\nadjusting only one parameter, the distance between the two lines, our\ndispersion relation exhibits quantitative agreement with the simulations and\nqualitative agreement with experimental measurements. Our linear stability\nanalysis indicate that this instability is caused by the combination of the\nadvective and transverse flows generated by the microrollers near a no-slip\nsurface. Our simple model offers an interesting formalism to characterize other\nhydrodynamic instabilities that have not been yet well understood, such as size\nscale selection in suspensions of particles sedimenting adjacent to a wall, or\nthe recently observed formations of traveling phonons in systems of confined\ndriven particles.\n", "  Motivated by the recent growing interest about the thermodynamic cost of\nShortcuts to Adiabaticity (STA), we consider the cost of driving a classical\nsystem by the so-called Counterdiabatic Driving (CD). To do so, we proceed in\nthree steps: first we review a general definition recently put forward in the\nliterature for the thermodynamic cost of driving a Hamiltonian system; then we\nprovide a new complementary definition of cost, which is of particular\nrelevance for cases where the average excess work vanishes; finally, we apply\nour general framework to the case of CD. Interestingly, we find that in such\ncase our results are the exact classical counterparts of those reported in Funo\net al. PRL, 118(10):100602, 2017. In particular we show that a universal\ntrade-off between speed and cost for CD also exists in the classical case. To\nillustrate our points we consider the example of a time-dependent harmonic\noscillator subject to different strategies of adiabatic control.\n", "  In this series of papers, we model the formation and evolution of the\nphotoionized region and its observational signatures during massive star\nformation. Here we focus on the early break out of the photoionized region into\nthe outflow cavity. Using results of 3-D magnetohydrodynamic-outflow\nsimulations and protostellar evolution calculations, we perform post-processing\nradiative-transfer. The photoionized region first appears at a protostellar\nmass of 10Msun in our fiducial model, and is confined to within 10-100AU by the\ndense inner outflow, similar to some observed very small hypercompact HII\nregions. Since the ionizing luminosity of the massive protostar increases\ndramatically as Kelvin-Helmholz (KH) contraction proceeds, the photoionized\nregion breaks out to the entire outflow region in <10,000yr. Accordingly, the\nradio free-free emission brightens significantly in this stage. In our fiducial\nmodel, the radio luminosity at 10 GHz changes from 0.1 mJy kpc2 at m=11Msun to\n100 mJy kpc2 at 16Msun, while the infrared luminosity increases by less than a\nfactor of two. The radio spectral index also changes in the break-out phase\nfrom the optically thick value of 2 to the partially optically thin value of\n0.6. Additionally, we demonstrate that short-timescale variation in free-free\nflux would be induced by an accretion burst. The outflow density is enhanced in\nthe accretion burst phase, which leads to a smaller ionized region and weaker\nfree-free emission. The radio luminosity may decrease by one order of magnitude\nduring such bursts, while the infrared luminosity is much less affected, since\ninternal protostellar luminosity dominates over accretion luminosity after KH\ncontraction starts. Such variability may be observable on timescales as short\n10-100 yr, if accretion bursts are driven by disk instabilities.\n", "  The long gamma ray bursts (GRBs) may arise from the core collapse of massive\nstars. However, the long GRB rate does not follow the star formation rate (SFR)\nat high redshifts. In this Letter, we focus on the binary merger model and\nconsider the high spin helium stars after the merger as the progenitor of long\nGRBs. With this scenario, we estimate the GRB rate by the population synthesis\nmethod with the metallicity evolution. Low metallicity binaries are easier to\nbecome long GRB progenitors than those for solar metallicity due to the weak\nwind mass loss and the difference in the stellar evolution. In our results, the\nlong GRB rate roughly agrees with the observed rate, and shows a similar\nbehavior to the observed redshift evolution.\n", "  We propose a simple many-body based screening mixing strategy to considerably\nenhance the performance of the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) approach for prediction of\nexcitation energies of molecular systems. This strategy enables us to nearly\nreproduce results of highly correlated equation of motion coupled cluster\nsingles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) through optimal use of cancellation effects.\n", "  Colloidal glasses form from hard spheres, nearly hard spheres, ellipsoids and\nplatelets or their attractive variants have been studied in detail.\nComplementing and checking theoretical approaches and simulations, the many\ndifferent types of model systems have significantly advanced our understanding\nof the glass transition in general. Despite their early prediction, however, no\nexperimental charged sphere glasses have been found at low density, where the\ncompeting process of crystallization prevails. We here report the formation of\na transient amorphous solid formed from charged polymer spheres suspended in\nthoroughly deionized water at volume fractions of 0.0002-0.01. From optical\nexperiments, we observe the presence of short-range order and an enhanced shear\nrigidity as compared to the stable polycrystalline solid of body centred cubic\nstructure. On a density dependent time scale of hours to days, the amorphous\nsolid transforms into this stable structure. We further present preliminary\ndynamic light scattering data showing the evolution of a second slow relaxation\nprocess possibly pointing to a dynamic heterogeneity known from other colloidal\nglasses and gels.We compare our findings to the predicted phase behaviour of\ncharged sphere suspensions and discuss possible mechanisms for the formation of\nthis peculiar type of colloidal glass.\n", "  Scalar condensates with large expectation values can form in the early\nuniverse, for example, in theories with supersymmetry. The condensate can\nundergo fragmentation into Q-balls before decaying. If the Q-balls dominate the\nenergy density for some period of time, statistical fluctuations in their\nnumber density can lead to formation of primordial black holes (PBH). In the\ncase of supersymmetry the mass range is limited from above by $10^{23}$g. For a\ngeneral charged scalar field, this robust mechanism can generate black holes\nover a much broader mass range, including the black holes with masses of 1-100\nsolar masses, which is relevant for LIGO observations of gravitational waves.\nTopological defects can lead to formation of PBH in a similar fashion.\n", "  The bulk of the stellar growth over cosmic time is dominated by IR luminous\ngalaxies at cosmic noon (z=1-2), many of which harbor a hidden active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). We use state of the art infrared color diagnostics, combining\nSpitzer and Herschel observations, to separate dust-obscured AGN from dusty\nstar forming galaxies (SFGs) in the CANDELS and COSMOS surveys. We calculate 24\nmicron counts of SFGs, AGN/star forming \"Composites\", and AGN. AGN and\nComposites dominate the counts above 0.8 mJy at 24 micron, and Composites form\nat least 25% of an IR sample even to faint detection limits. We develop methods\nto use the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST to identify dust-obscured AGN\nand Composite galaxies from z~1-2. With the sensitivity and spacing of MIRI\nfilters, we will detect >4 times as many AGN hosts than with Spitzer/IRAC\ncriteria. Any star formation rates based on the 7.7 micron PAH feature (likely\nto be applied to MIRI photometry) must be corrected for the contribution of the\nAGN, or the SFR will be overestimated by ~35% for cases where the AGN provides\nhalf the IR luminosity and ~50% when the AGN accounts for 90% of the\nluminosity. Finally, we demonstrate that our MIRI color technique can select\nAGN with an Eddington ratio of $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}\\sim0.01$ and will identify\nAGN hosts with a higher sSFR than X-ray techniques alone. JWST/MIRI will enable\ncritical steps forward in identifying and understanding dust-obscured AGN and\nthe link to their host galaxies.\n", "  In this paper we skim the true phenomenological requirements behind the\nconcept of inflationary squeezing. We argue that all that is required is that\nat horizon re-entry the fluctuations form standing waves with the correct\ntemporal phase (specifically, sine waves). We quantify this requirement and\nrelate it to the initial conditions fed into the radiation dominated epoch by\nwhatever phase of the Universe produced the fluctuations. The only relevant\nquantity turns out to be the degree of suppression of the momentum, $p$, of the\nfluctuations, $y$, which we measure by $\\sigma\\sim \\omega^2 |y|^2/|p|^2$. Even\nthough $\\sigma$ equals the squeezing parameter, $s$, in the case of inflation\nand bimetric varying speed of light scenarios, this is not true in general,\nspecifically in some bouncing Universe models. It is also not necessary to\nproduce a large $\\sigma$ at the end of the primordial phase: it is enough that\n$\\sigma$ be not too small. This is the case with scenarios based on modified\ndispersion relations (MDR) emulating the dispersion relations of\nHorava-Lifshitz theory, which produce $\\sigma\\sim 1$, enough to comply with the\nobservational requirements. Scenarios based on MDR leading to a slightly red\nspectrum are also examined, and shown to satisfy the observational constraints.\n", "  We perform a measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, using the latest\nbaryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from galaxy surveys of 6dFGS,\nSDSS DR7 Main Galaxy Sample, BOSS DR12 sample, and eBOSS DR14 quasar sample, in\nthe framework of a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model. Based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence, we examine the consistency of $H_0$ values derived from various\ndata sets. We find that our measurement is consistent with that derived from\nPlanck and with the local measurement of $H_0$ using the Cepheids and type Ia\nsupernovae. We perform forecasts on $H_0$ from future BAO measurements, and\nfind that the uncertainty of $H_0$ determined by future BAO data alone,\nincluding complete eBOSS, DESI and Euclid-like, is comparable with that from\nlocal measurements.\n", "  In a class of new physics models, an extended Higgs sector and new\nCP-violating sources are simultaneously present in order to explain the baryon\nasymmetry in the Universe. The aim of this work is to study the implications of\nbeyond the Standard Model (SM) CP violation for the searches of heavy scalars\nat the LHC. In particular, we focus on the diphoton channel searches in the\nCP-violating two-Higgs-doublet model (CPV 2HDM). To have a sizable CPV in the\nscalar sector, the two heavy neutral scalars in 2HDM tend to be nearly\ndegenerate. The theoretical constraints of unitarity, perturbativity and vacuum\nstability are considered, which requires that the heavy scalars $M_H \\lesssim\n1$ TeV in a large region of the parameter space. The experimental limits are\nalso taken into account, including the direct searches of heavy neutral scalars\nin the final state of the SM $h$, $W$ and $Z$ bosons, the differential\n$t\\bar{t}$ data, those from the charged scalar sector which is implied by the\noblique $T$ parameter, as well as the precise measurements of the electric\ndipole moments of electron and mercury. The quantum interference effects\nbetween the resonances and the SM background are crucially important for the\ndiphoton signals, and the CPV mixing of the quasi-degenerate heavy scalars\ncould enhance significantly the resonance peak. With an integrated luminosity\nof 3000 fb$^{-1}$ at the LHC, almost the whole parameter space of CPV 2HDM\ncould be probed in the diphoton channel, and the CPV could also be directly\ndetected via the diphoton spectrum.\n", "  One way to study the physical plausibility of closed timelike curves (CTCs)\nis to examine their computational power. This has been done for Deutschian CTCs\n(D-CTCs) and post-selection CTCs (P-CTCs), with the result that they allow for\nthe efficient solution of problems in PSPACE and PP, respectively. Since these\nare extremely powerful complexity classes, which are not expected to be\nsolvable in reality, this can be taken as evidence that these models for CTCs\nare pathological. This problem is closely related to the nonlinearity of this\nmodels, which also allows for example cloning quantum states, in the case of\nD-CTCs, or distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states, in the case of P-CTCs.\nIn contrast, the process matrix formalism allows one to model indefinite causal\nstructures in a \\emph{linear} way, getting rid of these effects, and raising\nthe possibility that its computational power is rather tame. In this paper we\nshow that process matrices correspond to a linear particular case of P-CTCs,\nand therefore that its computational power is upperbounded by that of PP. We\nshow, furthermore, a family of processes that can violate causal inequalities\nbut nevertheless can be simulated by a causally ordered quantum circuit with\nonly a constant overhead, showing that indefinite causality is not necessarily\nhard to simulate.\n", "  Turbulent Richtmyer--Meshkov instability (RMI) is investigated through a\nseries of high resolution three dimensional smulations of two initial\nconditions with eight independent codes. The simulations are initialised with a\nnarrowband perturbation such that instability growth is due to non-linear\ncoupling/backscatter from the energetic modes, thus generating the lowest\nexpected growth rate from a pure RMI. By independently assessing the results\nfrom each algorithm, and computing ensemble averages of multiple algorithms,\nthe results allow a quantification of key flow properties as well as the\nuncertainty due to differing numerical approaches. A new analytical model\npredicting the initial layer growth for a multimode narrowband perturbation is\npresented, along with two models for the linear and non-linear regime combined.\nOverall, the growth rate exponent is determined as $\\theta=0.292 \\pm 0.009$, in\ngood agreement with prior studies; however, the exponent is decaying slowly in\ntime. $\\theta$ is shown to be relatively insensitive to the choice of mixing\nlayer width measurement. The asymptotic integral molecular mixing measures\n$\\Theta=0.792\\pm 0.014$, $\\Xi=0.800 \\pm 0.014$ and $\\Psi=0.782\\pm 0.013$ which\nare lower than some experimental measurements but within the range of prior\nnumerical studies. The flow field is shown to be persistently anisotropic for\nall algorithms, at the latest time having between 49\\% and 66\\% higher kinetic\nenergy in the shock parallel direction compared to perpendicular and does not\nshow any return to isotropy. The plane averaged volume fraction profiles at\ndifferent time instants collapse reasonably well when scaled by the integral\nwidth, implying that the layer can be described by a single length scale and\nthus a single $\\theta$. Quantitative data given for both ensemble averages and\nindividual algorithms provide useful benchmark results for future research.\n", "  The advent of nodal-line semi-metals, i.e. systems in which the conduction\nand valence bands cross each other along a closed trajectory (line or loop)\ninside the Brillouin zone, has opened up a new arena for the exploration of\ntopological condensed matter in which, due to a vanishing density of states\nnear the Fermi level, electron correlation effects may also play an important\nrole. In spite of this conceptual richness however, material realization of\nnodal-line (loop) fermions is rare, with PbTaSe2, ZrSiS and PtSn4 the only\npromising known candidates. Here we report the synthesis and physical\nproperties of a new compound PdSn4 that is isostructural with PtSn4 yet\npossesses quasiparticles with significantly enhanced effective masses. In\naddition, PdSn4 displays an unusual polar angular magnetoresistance which at a\ncertain field orientation, varies linearly with field up to 55 Tesla. Our study\nsuggests that, in association with its homologue PtSn4 whose low-lying\nexcitations were recently claimed to possess Dirac node arcs, PdSn4 may be a\npromising candidate in the search for novel topological states with enhanced\ncorrelation effects.\n", "  A white neutron beam line using the back-streaming neutrons from the\nspallation target at China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is under\nconstruction. Different spectrometers mainly for nuclear data measurements to\nbe installed in the so-called Back-n beam line are also under development in\nphases. The physics design of the beam line includes the overview of the\ncharacteristics of the neutron beam including energy spectrum, flux and time\nstructure, and the optimizations of neutron beam spots and in-hall background\nwith the help of a complicated collimation system and a sophisticated neutron\ndump. The wide neutron energy range of 1 eV~100 MeV is very good to support\ndifferent applications, especially for nuclear data measurements. At\nEndstation#2 where is about 80 m from the target, the main properties include\nneutron flux of 106 n/cm2/s, time resolution of a few per mille over almost the\nwhole energy range, in-hall background about 0.01 /cm2/s for both neutron and\ngamma. With its completion in late 2017, Back-n will be not only the first\nhigh-performance white neutron source in China, but also among the best white\nneutron sources in the world.\n", "  The fluctuation-dissipation relation, a central result in non-equilibrium\nstatistical physics, relates equilibrium fluctuations in a system to its linear\nresponse to external forces. Here we provide a direct experimental verification\nof this relation for viscously coupled oscillators, as realized by a pair of\noptically trapped colloidal particles. A theoretical analysis, in which\ninteractions mediated by slow viscous flow are represented by non-local\nfriction tensors, matches experimental results and reveals a frequency maximum\nin the amplitude of the mutual response which is a sensitive function of the\ntrap stiffnesses and the friction tensors. This allows for its location and\nwidth to be tuned and suggests the utility of the trap setup for accurate\ntwo-point microrheology.\n", "  Scanning tunneling microscopy visualizations of quasiparticle interference\n(QPI) enable powerful insights into the k-space properties of superconducting,\ntopological, Rashba and other exotic electronic phases, but their reliance on\nimpurities acting as scattering centers is rarely scrutinized. Here we\ninvestigate QPI at the vacuum-cleaved (001) surface of the Dirac semimetal\nZrSiS. We find that interference patterns around impurities located on the Zr\nand S lattice sites appear very different, and can be ascribed to selective\nscattering of different sub-sets of the predominantly Zr 4d-derived band\nstructure, namely the m = 0 and m = +/-1 components. We show that the\nselectivity of scattering channels requires an explanation beyond the different\nbands' orbital characteristics and their respective charge density\ndistributions over Zr and S lattices sites. Importantly, this result shows that\nthe usual assumption of generic scattering centers allowing observations of\nquasiparticle interference to shed light indiscriminately and isotropically\nupon the \\textit{q}-space of scattering events does not hold, and that the\nscope and interpretation of QPI observations can therefore be be strongly\ncontingent on the material defect chemistry. This finding promises to spur new\ninvestigations into the quasiparticle scattering process itself, to inform\nfuture interpretations of quasiparticle interference observations, and\nultimately to aid the understanding and engineering of quantum electronic\ntransport properties.\n", "  The accumulation of impurities in the core of magnetically confined plasmas,\nresulting from standard collisional transport mechanisms, is a known threat to\ntheir performance as fusion energy sources. Whilst the axisymmetric tokamak\nsystems have been shown to benefit from the effect of temperature screening,\nthat is an outward flux of impurities driven by the temperature gradient,\nimpurity accumulation in stellarators was thought to be inevitable, driven\nrobustly by the inward pointing electric field characteristic of hot fusion\nplasmas. We have shown in Helander et. al. (2017b) that such screening can in\nprinciple also appear in stellarators, in the experimentally relevant mixed\ncollisionality regime, where a highly collisional impurity species is present\nin a low collisionality bulk plasma. Details of the analytic calculation are\npresented here, along with the effect of the impurity on the bulk ion flow,\nwhich will ultimately affect the bulk contribution to the bootstrap current.\n", "  It is a longstanding desire of cosmologists, and particle physicists as well,\nto connect inflation to low energy physics, culminating, for instance, in what\nis known as Higgs inflation. The condition for the standard Higgs boson playing\nthe role of the inflaton, and driving successfully inflation, is that it\ncouples nonminimally with gravity. Nevertheless, cosmological constraints\nimpose that the nonminimal coupling be large. This causes the loss of\nperturbative unitarity in a scale of energy far below the Planck one. Our aim\nin this work is to point out that inflaton potential containing a particular\ntype of trilinear coupling involving the inflaton may circumvent this problem\nby realizing Higgs inflation with tiny nonminimal coupling of the inflaton with\ngravity. We then develop the idea within a toy model and implement it in the\ninverse type-II seesaw mechanism for small neutrinos masses.\n", "  Intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies have been recognized as one of the most\nserious contaminants to weak lensing. These systematics need to be isolated and\nmitigated in order for ongoing and future lensing surveys to reach their full\npotential. The IA self-calibration (SC) method was shown in previous studies to\nbe able to reduce the GI contamination by up to a factor of 10 for the 2-point\nand 3-point correlations. The SC method does not require to assume an IA model\nin its working and can extract the GI signal from the same photo-z survey\noffering the possibility to test and understand structure formation scenarios\nand their relationship to IA models. In this paper, we study the effects of the\nIA SC mitigation method on the precision and accuracy of cosmological parameter\nconstraints from future cosmic shear surveys LSST, WFIRST and Euclid. We\nperform analytical and numerical calculations to estimate the loss of precision\nand the residual bias in the best fit cosmological parameters after the\nself-calibration is performed. We take into account uncertainties from\nphotometric redshifts and the galaxy bias. We find that the confidence contours\nare slightly inflated from applying the SC method itself while a significant\nincrease is due to the inclusion of the photo-z uncertainties. The bias of\ncosmological parameters is reduced from several-$\\sigma$, when IA is not\ncorrected for, to below 1-$\\sigma$ after SC is applied. These numbers are\ncomparable to those resulting from applying the method of marginalizing over IA\nmodel parameters despite the fact that the two methods operate very\ndifferently. We conclude that implementing the SC for these future cosmic-shear\nsurveys will not only allow one to efficiently mitigate the GI contaminant but\nalso help to understand their modeling and link to structure formation.\n", "  We use zoom hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the properties of\nsatellites within galaxy-sized dark-matter haloes with different assembly\nhistories. We consider two classes of haloes at redshift $z=0$: `stalled'\nhaloes that assembled at $z>1$ and `accreting' ones that are still forming\nnowadays. Previously, we showed that the stalled haloes are embedded within\nthick filaments of the cosmic web while the accreting ones lie where multiple\nthin filaments converge. We find that satellites in the two classes have both\nsimilar and different properties. Their mass spectra, radial count profiles,\nbaryonic and stellar content, and the amount of material they shed are\nindistinguishable. However, the mass fraction locked in satellites is\nsubstantially larger for the accreting haloes as they experience more mergers\nat late times. The largest difference is found in the satellite kinematics.\nSubstructures fall towards the accreting haloes along quasi-radial trajectories\nwhereas an important tangential velocity component is developed, before\naccretion, while orbiting the filament that surrounds the stalled haloes. Thus,\nthe velocity anisotropy parameter of the satellites ($\\beta$) is positive for\nthe accreting haloes and negative for the stalled ones. This signature enables\nus to tentatively categorize the Milky Way halo as stalled based on a recent\nmeasurement of $\\beta$. Half of our haloes contain clusters of satellites with\naligned orbital angular momenta corresponding to flattened structures in space.\nThese features are not driven by baryonic physics and are only found in haloes\nhosting grand-design spiral galaxies, independently of their assembly history.\n", "  Recently, the synchronization on multi-layer networks has drawn a lot of\nattention. In this work, we study the stability of the complete synchronization\non duplex networks. We investigate effects of coupling function on the complete\nsynchronization on duplex networks. We propose two approximation methods to\ndeal with the stability of the complete synchronization on duplex networks. In\nthe first method, we introduce a modified master stability function and, in the\nsecond method, we only take into consideration the contributions of a few most\nunstable transverse modes to the stability of the complete synchronization. We\nfind that both methods work well for predicting the stability of the complete\nsynchronization for small networks. For large networks, the second method still\nworks pretty well.\n", "  We investigate the CMB $\\mu$ distortion in models where two uncorrelated\nsources contribute to primordial perturbations. We parameterise each source by\nan amplitude, tilt, running and running of the running. We perform a detailed\nanalysis of the distribution signal as function of the model parameters,\nhighlighting the differences compared to single-source models. As a specific\nexample, we also investigate the mixed inflaton-curvaton scenario. We find that\nthe $\\mu$ distortion could efficiently break degeneracies of curvaton\nparameters especially when combined with future sensitivity of probing the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. For example, assuming bounds $\\mu < 0.5 \\times\n10^{-8}$ and $r<0.01$, the curvaton contribution should either vanish or the\ncurvaton should dominate primordial perturbations and its slow-roll parameter\n$\\eta_{\\chi}$ is constrained to the interval $-0.007 < \\eta_{\\chi}< 0.045$.\n", "  We demonstrate optically induced switching between bright and dark charged\ndivacancy defects in 4H-SiC. Photoluminescence excitation and time-resolved\nphotoluminescence measurements reveal the excitation conditions for such charge\nconversion. For an energy below ~1.3 eV (above ~950 nm), the PL is suppressed\nby more than two orders of magnitude. The PL is recovered in the presence of a\nhigher energy repump laser with a time-averaged intensity less than 0.1% that\nof the excitation field. Under a repump of 2.33 eV (532 nm), the PL increases\nrapidly, with a time constant ~30 $\\mu$s. By contrast, when the repump is\nswitched off, the PL decreases first within ~100-200 $\\mu$s, followed by a much\nslower decay of a few seconds. We attribute these effects to the conversion\nbetween two different charge states. Under an excitation at energy levels below\n1.3 eV, V$_{Si}$V$_C$$^0$ are converted into a dark charge state. A repump\nlaser with an energy above 1.3 eV can excite this charged state and recover the\nbright neutral state. This optically induced charge switching can lead to\ncharge-state fluctuations but can be exploited for long-term data storage or\nnuclear-spin-based quantum memory.\n", "  Context: Large cavities in disks are important testing grounds for the\nmechanisms proposed to drive disk evolution and dispersion, such as dynamical\nclearing by planets and photo-evaporation. Aims: We aim to resolve the large\ncavity in the disk around HD 34282, such as has been predicted by previous\nstudies modeling the spectral energy distribution Methods: Using ALMA band 7\nobservations we study HD 34282 with a spatial resolution of 0.10\\arcsec x\n0.17\\arcsec at 345 GHz. Results: We resolve the disk around HD 34282 into a\nring between 0.24\\arcsec and 1.15\\arcsec (78 and 374 au adopting a distance of\n325 pc). The emission in this ring shows azimuthal asymmetry centered at a\nradial distance of 0.46\\arcsec and a position angle of 135 degrees and an\nazimuthal FWHM of 51 degrees. We detect CO emission both inside the disk cavity\nand as far out as 2.7 times the radial extent of the dust emission.\nConclusions: Both the large disk cavity and the azimuthal structure in the disk\naround HD 34282 can be explained by the presence of a 50 jupiter mass brown\ndwarf companion at a separation of ~ 0.1\\arcsec.\n", "  We study massless cosmic strings which are one-dimensional objects moving\nwith the speed of light. Perturbations of velocities of test bodies and\nanisotropy of cosmic microwave background generated by massless cosmic strings\nare analysed. These phenomena are analogous to the string wake effect and the\nKaiser-Stebbins effect for standard (massive) cosmic strings. There are two\nregimes depending on the energy $E$ of a massless string per unit length. At\nlow energies, $EG/c^4\\ll 1$, massless and massive strings act similarly. At\nhigh energies, $EG/c^4 \\sim 1$, massless string effects are quite different.\nOur work provides a method to describe different physical phenomena on\nspacetimes of massless strings which take into account the presence of a\nparabolic holonomy.\n", "  We study the average coincidence-count signal at the output of a two-mode\nsqueezing device with $|N\\rangle\\otimes|\\alpha\\rangle$ as the two input modes.\nWe show that the input photon-number can be resolved from the average\ncoincidence counts. In particular, we show jumps in the average\ncoincidence-count signal as a function of input photon-number $N$. Therefore,\nwe propose that such a device may be deployed as photon-number-resolving\ndetector at room temperature with high efficiency.\n", "  The Hamiltonian of Intrinsic Time Gravity is elucidated. The theory describes\nSchrodinger evolution of our universe with respect to the fractional change of\nthe total spatial volume. Heat kernel regularization is employed to demonstrate\nthat Einstein's Ricci scalar potential emerges naturally from the simple\npositive-definite self-adjoint Hamiltonian of the theory.\n", "  We consider a model of Dirac fermions in $2+1$ dimensions with dynamically\ngenerated, anticommuting SO(3) N\\'eel and Z$_2$ Kekul\\'e mass terms that\npermits sign-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The phase diagram is\nobtained from finite-size scaling and includes a direct and continuous\ntransition between the N\\'eel and Kekul\\'e phases. The fermions remain gapped\nacross the transition, and our data support an emergent SO(4) symmetry unifying\nthe two order parameters. While the bare symmetries of our model do not allow\nfor spinon-carrying Z$_3$ vortices in the Kekul\\'e mass, the emergent SO(4)\ninvariance permits an interpretation of the transition in terms of deconfined\nquantum criticality. The phase diagram also features a tricritical point at\nwhich N\\'eel, Kekul\\'e, and semimetallic phases meet. The present, sign-free\napproach can be generalized to a variety of other mass terms and thereby\nprovides a new framework to study exotic critical phenomena.\n", "  We introduce a phase-field crystal model that creates an array of complex\nthree- and two-dimensional crystal structures via a numerically tractable\nthree-point correlation function. The three-point correlation function is\ndesigned in order to energetically favor the principal interplanar angles of a\ntarget crystal structure. This is achieved via an analysis performed by\nexamining the crystal's structure factor. This approach successfully yields\nenergetically stable simple cubic, diamond cubic, simple hexagonal, graphene\nlayers, and CaF$_2$ crystals. To illustrate the ability of the method to yield\na particularly complex and technologically important crystal structure, we show\nhow this three-point correlation function method can be used to generate\nperovskite crystals.\n", "  Surface stresses have recently emerged as a key player in the mechanics of\nhighly compliant solids. The classic theories of contact mechanics describe\nadhesion with a compliant substrate as a competition between surface energies\ndriving deformation to establish contact and bulk elasticity resisting this.\nHowever, it has recently been shown that surface stresses provide an additional\nrestoring force that can compete with and even dominate over elasticity in\nhighly compliant materials, especially when length scales are small compared to\nthe ratio of the surface stress to the elastic modulus, $\\Upsilon/E$. Here, we\ninvestigate experimentally the contribution of surface stresses to the force of\nadhesion. We find that the elastic and capillary contributions to the adhesive\nforce are of similar magnitude, and that both are required to account for\nmeasured adhesive forces between rigid silica spheres and compliant, silicone\ngels. Notably, the strain-dependence of the solid surface stress contributes\nsignificantly to the stiffness of soft solid contacts.\n", "  We have investigated the properties of the ergosphere and the energy\nextraction by Penrose process in a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black\nhole spacetime. We find that the ergosphere becomes thin and the maximum\nefficiency of energy extraction decreases as the deformation parameter\nincreases. For the case with $a<M$, the positive deformation parameter yields\nthat the maximum efficiency is lower than that in the Kerr black hole with the\nsame rotation parameter. However, for the superspinning case with $a>M$, we\nfind that the maximum efficiency can reach so high that it is almost unlimited\nas the positive deformation parameter is close to zero, which is a new feature\nof energy extraction in such kind of rotating non-Kerr black hole spacetime.\n", "  The method of counting loops for calculating the partition function of the\nIsing model on the two dimensional square lattice is extended to lacunary\nplanar lattices, especially scale invariant fractal lattices, the Sierpi\\'nsky\ncarpets with different values of the scale invariance ratio and of the number\nof deleted sites. The critical temperature of the Ising model on these lattices\nis exactly calculated for finite iteration steps, and for a range of the scale\ninvariance ratio $n$ from 3 to 1000 and of the number of deleted sites from\n$(n-2)^2$ to $(n-10)^2$. The critical temperature at the limit of an infinite\nnumber of iteration of the segmentation process is asymptotically extrapolated.\nComparison is made with results obtained previously by numerical methods.\nThermodynamical functions are also calculated and the fractal spectra of the\nIsing partition functions on several examples of Sierpi\\'nski carpets are\nillustrated.\n", "  Qubit(s) transfer through a helical chain is studied. We consider the\ntransfer of a single state and Bell states across a multiferroic spin chain and\nthe possibility of an electric field control of the fidelity of the single\nstate and the Bell pairs. We analyze pure and imperfect multiferroic spin\nchains. A scheme for an efficient transfer of spin states through a\nmultiferroic channel relies on kicking by appropriate electric field pulses at\nregular interval. This electric field pulse sequence undermines the effect of\nimpurity on the fidelity and improves the state transfer through the helical\nchain.\n", "  We introduce a quantum key distribution protocol designed to expose fake\nusers that connect to Alice or Bob for the purpose of monopolising the link and\ndenying service. It inherently resists attempts to exhaust Alice and Bob's\ninitial shared secret, and is 100% efficient, regardless of the number of\nqubits exchanged above the finite key limit. Additionally, secure key can be\ngenerated from two-photon pulses, without having to make any extra\nmodifications. This is made possible by relaxing the security of BB84 to that\nof the quantum-safe block cipher used for day-to-day encryption, meaning the\noverall security remains unaffected for useful real-world cryptosystems such as\nAES-GCM being keyed with quantum devices.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of an electron in an infinite disordered metallic\nwire. We derive exact expressions for the probability of diffusive return to\nthe starting point in a given time. The result is valid for wires with or\nwithout time-reversal symmetry and allows for the possibility of topologically\nprotected conducting channels. In the absence of protected channels, Anderson\nlocalization leads to a nonzero limiting value of the return probability at\nlong times, which is approached as a negative power of time with an exponent\ndepending on the symmetry class. When topologically protected channels are\npresent (in a wire of either unitary or symplectic symmetry), the probability\nof return decays to zero at long time as a power law whose exponent depends on\nthe number of protected channels. Technically, we describe the electron\ndynamics by the one-dimensional supersymmetric non-linear sigma model. We\nderive an exact identity that relates any local dynamical correlation function\nin a disordered wire of unitary, orthogonal, or symplectic symmetry to a\ncertain expectation value in the random matrix ensemble of class AIII, CI, or\nDIII, respectively. The established exact mapping from one- to zero-dimensional\nsigma model is very general and can be used to compute any local observable in\na disordered wire.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to compare different sources of stochasticity in the\nsolar system. More precisely we study the importance of the long term influence\nof asteroids on the chaotic dynamics of the solar system. We show that the\neffects of asteroids on planets is similar to a white noise process, when those\neffects are considered on a time scale much larger than the correlation time\n$\\tau_{\\varphi}\\simeq10^{4}$ yr of asteroid trajectories. We compute the time\nscale $\\tau_{e}$ after which the effects of the stochastic evolution of the\nasteroids lead to a loss of information for the initial conditions of the\nperturbed Laplace\\textendash Lagrange secular dynamics. The order of magnitude\nof this time scale is precisely determined by theoretical argument. This time\nscale should be compared with the Lyapunov time $\\tau_{i}$ of the solar system\nwithout asteroids (intrinsic chaos). We conclude that $\\tau_{i}\\simeq10\\,\n\\text{Myr} \\ll \\tau_{e} \\simeq10^{4}\\, \\text{Myr}$, showing that the external\nsources of chaoticity arise as a small perturbation in the stochastic secular\nbehavior of the solar system, rather due to intrinsic chaos.\n", "  A new relative orbit solution with new dynamical masses is determined for the\nnearby white dwarf - red dwarf pair 40 Eri BC. The period is 230.09+/-0.68y. It\nis predicted to close slowly over the next half-century getting as close as\n1.32\" in early 2066. We determine masses of 0.575+/-0.018 $m_\\odot$ for the\nwhite dwarf and 0.2041+/-0.0064 $m_\\odot$ for the red dwarf companion. The\ninconsistency of the masses determined by gravitational redshift and dynamical\ntechniques, due to a premature orbit calculation, no longer exists.\n", "  The compounds Sr$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$O$_{8}$ and Ba$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$O$_{8}$ are\ninsulating dimerized antiferromagnets with Cr$^{5+}$ magnetic ions. These\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ ions form hexagonal bilayers with a strong intradimer\nantiferromagnetic interaction, that leads to a singlet ground state and gapped\ntriplet states. We report on the effect on the magnetic properties of\nSr$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$O$_{8}$ by introducing chemical disorder upon replacing Sr by\nBa. Two single crystals of Ba$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Cr$_{2}$O$_{8}$ with $x=2.9$\n(3.33\\% of $mixing$) and $x=2.8$ (6.66\\%) were grown in a four-mirror type\noptical floating-zone furnace. The magnetic properties on these compounds were\nstudied by magnetization measurements. Inelastic neutron scattering\nmeasurements on Ba$_{0.1}$Sr$_{2.9}$Cr$_{2}$O$_{8}$ were performed in order to\ndetermine the interaction constants and the spin gap for $x=2.9$. The\nintradimer interaction constant is found to be $J_0$=5.332(2) meV, about 4\\%\nsmaller than that of pure Sr$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$O$_{8}$, while the interdimer\nexchange interaction $J_e$ is smaller by 6.9\\%. These results indicate a\nnoticeable change in the magnetic properties by a random substitution effect.\n", "  We introduce massive black holes (BHs) in the Feedback In Realistic\nEnvironments project and perform high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations of quasar-mass halos ($M_{\\rm halo}(z=2) \\approx\n10^{12.5}\\,\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$) down to $z=1$. These simulations model stellar\nfeedback by supernovae, stellar winds, and radiation, and BH growth using a\ngravitational torque-based prescription tied to resolved properties of galactic\nnuclei. We do not include BH feedback. We show that early BH growth occurs\nthrough short ($\\lesssim 1\\,$Myr) accretion episodes that can reach or even\nexceed the Eddington rate. In this regime, BH growth is limited by bursty\nstellar feedback continuously evacuating gas from galactic nuclei, and BHs\nremain under-massive relative to the local $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_{\\rm bulge}$\nrelation. BH growth is more efficient at later times, when the nuclear stellar\npotential retains a significant gas reservoir, star formation becomes less\nbursty, and galaxies settle into a more ordered state, with BHs rapidly\nconverging onto the scaling relation when the host reaches $M_{\\rm bulge} \\sim\n10^{10}\\,\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$. Our results are not sensitive to the details of the\naccretion model so long as BH growth is tied to the gas content within $\\sim\n100\\,$pc of the BH. Our simulations imply that bursty stellar feedback has\nstrong implications for BH and AGN demographics, especially in the early\nUniverse and for low-mass galaxies.\n", "  We discuss a procedure to build new sequences of magnetised, equilibrium tori\naround Kerr black holes which combines two approaches previously considered in\nthe literature. For simplicity we assume that the test-fluid approximation\nholds, and hence we neglect the self-gravity of the fluid. The models are built\nassuming a particular form of the angular momentum distribution from which the\nlocation and morphology of equipotential surfaces can be computed. This ansatz\nincludes, in particular, the constant angular momentum case originally employed\nin the construction of thick tori - or Polish doughnuts - and it has already\nbeen used to build equilibrium sequences of purely hydrodynamical models. We\ndiscuss the properties of the new models and their dependence on the initial\nparameters. These new sequences can be used as initial data for\nmagnetohydrodynamical evolutions in general relativity.\n", "  We review our recent theoretical results for mesoscopic fluctuations of the\nlocal density of states in the presence of electron-electron interaction. We\nfocus on the two specific cases: (i) a vicinity of interacting critical point\ncorresponding to Anderson-Mott transition, and (ii) a vicinity of\nnon-interacting critical point in the presence of a weak electron-electron\nattraction. In both cases strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the local density\nof states exist.\n", "  We have observed period-tripling subharmonic oscillations, in a\nsuperconducting coplanar waveguide resonator operated in the quantum regime,\n$k_B T \\ll \\hbar\\omega$. The resonator is terminated by a tunable inductance\nthat provides a Kerr-type nonlinearity. We detected the output field\nquadratures at frequencies near the fundamental mode, $\\omega/2\\pi \\sim\n5\\,$GHz, when the resonator was driven by a current at $3\\omega$ with an\namplitude exceeding an instability threshold. The output radiation was\nred-detuned from the fundamental mode. We observed three stable radiative\nstates with equal amplitudes and phase-shifted by $120^\\circ$. The\ndownconversion from $3\\omega$ to $\\omega$ is strongly enhanced by resonant\nexcitation of the second mode of the resonator, and the cross-Kerr effect. Our\nexperimental results are in quantitative agreement with a model for the driven\ndynamics of two coupled modes.\n", "  The simplest analyses of halo bias assume that halo mass alone determines\nhalo clustering. However, if the large scale environment is fixed, then halo\nclustering is almost entirely determined by environment, and is almost\ncompletely independent of halo mass. We show why. Our analysis is useful for\nstudies which use the environmental dependence of clustering to constrain\ncosmological and galaxy formation models. It also shows why many correlations\nbetween galaxy properties and environment are merely consequences of the\nunderlying correlations between halos and their environments, and provides a\nframework for quantifying such inherited correlations.\n", "  We perform a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of 105 presumably single O\ndwarf stars in 30 Doradus, located within the Large Magellanic Cloud. We use\nmid-to-high resolution multi-epoch optical spectroscopic data obtained within\nthe VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey. Stellar and wind parameters are derived by\nmeans of the automatic tool IACOB-GBAT, which is based on a large grid of\nFASTWIND models. We also benefit from the Bayesian tool BONNSAI to estimate\nevolutionary masses. We provide a spectral calibration for the effective\ntemperature of O dwarf stars in the LMC, deal with the mass discrepancy problem\nand investigate the wind properties of the sample.\n", "  In this article, we discuss the non-trivial collective charge excitations\n(plasmons) of the extended square-lattice Hubbard model. Using a fully\nnon-perturbative approach, we employ the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm to\nsimulate the system at half-filling. A modified Backus-Gilbert method is\nintroduced to obtain the spectral functions via numerical analytic\ncontinuation. We directly compute the single-particle density of states which\ndemonstrates the formation of Hubbard bands in the strongly-correlated phase.\nThe momentum-resolved charge susceptibility is also computed on the basis of\nthe Euclidean charge density-density correlator. In agreement with previous\nEDMFT studies, we find that at large strength of the electron-electron\ninteraction, the plasmon dispersion develops two branches.\n", "  We find that the multicritical fixed point structure of the O($N$) models is\nmuch more complicated than widely believed. In particular, we find new\nnonperturbative fixed points in three dimensions ($d=3$) as well as at\n$N=\\infty$. These fixed points come together with an intricate double-valued\nstructure when they are considered as functions of $d$ and $N$. Many features\nfound for the O($N$) models are shared by the O($N)\\otimes$O(2) models relevant\nto frustrated magnetic systems.\n", "  We investigate whether a Gaussian likelihood, as routinely assumed in the\nanalysis of cosmological data, is supported by simulated survey data. We define\ntest statistics, based on a novel method that first destroys Gaussian\ncorrelations in a dataset, and then measures the non-Gaussian correlations that\nremain. This procedure flags pairs of datapoints which depend on each other in\na non-Gaussian fashion, and thereby identifies where the assumption of a\nGaussian likelihood breaks down. Using this diagnostic, we find that\nnon-Gaussian correlations in the CFHTLenS cosmic shear correlation functions\nare significant. With a simple exclusion of the most contaminated datapoints,\nthe posterior for $s_8$ is shifted without broadening, but we find no\nsignificant reduction in the tension with $s_8$ derived from Planck Cosmic\nMicrowave Background data. However, we also show that the one-point\ndistributions of the correlation statistics are noticeably skewed, such that\nsound weak lensing data sets are intrinsically likely to lead to a\nsystematically low lensing amplitude being inferred. The detected\nnon-Gaussianities get larger with increasing angular scale such that for future\nwide-angle surveys such as Euclid or LSST, with their very small statistical\nerrors, the large-scale modes are expected to be increasingly affected. The\nshifts in posteriors may then not be negligible and we recommend that these\ndiagnostic tests be run as part of future analyses.\n", "  Langevin dynamics has become a popular tool to simulate the Boltzmann\nequilibrium distribution. When the repartition of the Langevin equation\ninvolves the exact realization of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, in addition to\nthe conventional density evolution, there exists another type of discrete\nevolution that may not correspond to a continuous, real dynamical counterpart.\nThis virtual dynamics case is also able to produce the desired stationary\ndistribution. Different types of repartition lead to different numerical\nschemes, of which the accuracy and efficiency are investigated through studying\nthe harmonic oscillator potential, an analytical solvable model. By analyzing\nthe asymptotic distribution and characteristic correlation time that are\nderived by either directly solving the discrete equations of motion or using\nthe related phase space propagators, it is shown that the optimal friction\ncoefficient resulting in the minimal characteristic correlation time depends on\nthe time interval chosen in the numerical implementation. When the recommended\n\"middle\" scheme is employed, both analytical and numerical results demonstrate\nthat for a good numerical performance in efficiency as well as accuracy, one\nmay choose a friction coefficient in a wide range from around the optimal value\nto the high friction limit.\n", "  The Sun is the most constrained and well-studied of all stars. As a\nconsequence, the physical ingredients entering solar models are used as a\nreference to study all other stars observed in the Universe. However, our\nunderstanding of the solar structure is still imperfect, as illustrated by the\ncurrent debate on the heavy element abundances in the Sun. We wish to provide\nadditional information on the solar structure by carrying out structural\ninversions of a new physical quantity, a proxy of the entropy of the solar\nplasma which properties are very sensitive to the temperature gradient below\nthe convective zone. We use new structural kernels to carry out direct\ninversions of an entropy proxy of the solar plasma and compare the solar\nstructure to various standard solar models built using various opacity tables\nand chemical abundances. We also link our results to classical tests commonly\nfound in the literature. Our analysis allows us to probe more efficiently the\nuncertain regions of the solar models, just below the convective zone, paving\nthe way for new in-depth analyses of the Sun taking into account additional\nphysical uncertainties of solar models beyond the specific question of chemical\nabundances.\n", "  In recent decades, a great variety of researches and applications concerning\nBell nonlocality have been developed with the advent of quantum information\nscience. Providing that Bell nonlocality can be revealed by the violation of a\nfamily of Bell inequalities, finding maximal Bell violation (MBV) for unknown\nquantum states becomes an important and inevitable task during Bell\nexperiments. In this paper we introduce a self-guide method to find MBVs for\nunknown states using a stochastic gradient ascent algorithm (SGA), by\nparameterizing the corresponding Bell operators. For all the investigated\nsystems (2-qubit, 3-qubit and 2-qutrit), this method can ascertain the MBV\naccurately within 100 iterations. Moreover, SGA exhibits significant\nsuperiority in efficiency, robustness and versatility compared to other\npossible methods.\n", "  We studied timing jitter in the appearance of photon counts in meandering\nnanowires with different fractional amount of bends. Timing jitter, which is\nthe probability density of the random time delay between photon absorption in\ncurrent-carrying superconducting nanowire and appearance of the normal domain,\nreveals two different underlying physical scenarios. In the deterministic\nregime, which is realized at large currents and photon energies, jitter is\ncontrolled by position dependent detection threshold in straight parts of\nmeanders and decreases with the current. At small photon energies, jitter\nincreases and its current dependence disappears. In this probabilistic regime\njitter is controlled by Poisson process in that magnetic vortices jump randomly\nacross the wire in areas adjacent to the bends.\n", "  The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will provide high precision\ntime-series photometry for millions of stars with at least a half-hour cadence.\nOf particular interest are the circular regions of 12-degree radius centered\naround the ecliptic poles that will be observed continuously for a full year.\nSpectroscopic stellar parameters are desirable to characterize and select\nsuitable targets for TESS, whether they are focused on exploring exoplanets,\nstellar astrophysics, or Galactic archaeology. Here, we present spectroscopic\nstellar parameters ($T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H], $v \\sin i$, $v_{\\rm\nmicro}$) for about 16,000 dwarf and subgiant stars in TESS' southern continuous\nviewing zone. For almost all the stars, we also present Bayesian estimates of\nstellar properties including distance, extinction, mass, radius, and age using\ntheoretical isochrones. Stellar surface gravity and radius are made available\nfor an additional set of roughly 8,500 red giants. All our target stars are in\nthe range $10<V<13.1$. Among them, we identify and list 227 stars belonging to\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud. The data were taken using the the High Efficiency\nand Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph (HERMES, R $\\sim 28,000$) at the\nAnglo-Australian Telescope as part of the TESS-HERMES survey. Comparing our\nresults with the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) shows that the TIC is generally\nefficient in separating dwarfs and giants, but it has flagged more than hundred\ncool dwarfs ($T_{\\rm eff}< 4800$ K) as giants, which ought to be high-priority\ntargets for the exoplanet search. The catalog can be accessed via\nhttp://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/tess-hermes/ , or at MAST via\nhttps://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/tess-hermes/ .\n", "  We consider gedanken experiments to destroy an extremal or nearly extremal\nKerr-Newman black hole by causing it to absorb matter with sufficient charge\nand/or angular momentum as compared with energy that it cannot remain a black\nhole. It was previously shown by one of us that such gedanken experiments\ncannot succeed for test particle matter entering an extremal Kerr-Newman black\nhole. We generalize this result here to arbitrary matter entering an extremal\nKerr-Newman black hole, provided only that the non-electromagnetic contribution\nto the stress-energy tensor of the matter satisfies the null energy condition.\nWe then analyze the gedanken experiments proposed by Hubeny and others to\nover-charge and/or over-spin an initially slightly non-extremal Kerr-Newman\nblack hole. Analysis of such gedanken experiments requires that we calculate\nall effects on the final mass of the black hole that are second-order in the\ncharge and angular momentum carried into the black hole, including all\nself-force effects. We obtain a general formula for the full second order\ncorrection to mass, $\\delta^2 M$, which allows us to prove that no gedanken\nexperiments of the generalized Hubeny type can ever succeed in over-charging\nand/or over-spinning a Kerr-Newman black hole, provided only that the\nnon-electromagnetic stress-energy tensor satisfies the null energy condition.\nOur analysis is based upon Lagrangian methods, and our formula for the\nsecond-order correction to mass is obtained by generalizing the canonical\nenergy analysis of Hollands and Wald to the Einstein-Maxwell case. Remarkably,\nwe obtain our formula for $\\delta^2 M$ without having to explicitly compute\nself-force or finite size effects. Indeed, in an appendix, we show explicitly\nthat our formula incorporates both the self-force and finite size effects for\nthe special case of a charged body slowly lowered into an uncharged black hole.\n", "  A tidal disruption event (TDE) is an astronomical phenomenon in which a\npreviously dormant black hole (BH) destroys a star passing too close to its\ncentral part. We analyzed the flaring episode detected from the TDE sources,\nSwift~J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05 using RXTE, Swift and Suzaku data. The\nspectra are well fitted by the so called Bulk Motion Comptonization model for\nwhich the best-fit photon index Gamma varies from 1.1 to 1.8. We have firmly\nestablished the saturation of Gamma versus mass accretion rate at Gamma_{sat}\nabout 1.7 -- 1.8. The saturation of Gamma is usually identified as a signature\nof a BH now established in Swift~J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05. In Swift~J1644+57\nwe found the relatively low Gamma_{sat} values which indicate a high electron\n(plasma) temperature, kT_e ~ 30 -- 40 keV. This is also consistent with high\ncutoff energies, E_{cut} ~ 60 -- 80 keV found using best fits of the RXTE\nspectra. Swift~J2058+05 shows a lower electron temperature, kT_e ~ 4-10 keV\nthan that for Swift~J1644+57. For the BH mass estimate we used the scaling\ntechnique taking the Galactic BHs, GRO J1655--40, GX~339--4, Cyg~X--1 and\n4U~1543--47 as reference sources and found that the BH mass in Swift~J1644+57\nis M_{BH}> 7x10^6 solar masses assuming the distance to this of 1.5 Gpc. For\nSwift J2058+05 we obtain M_{BH}> 2x 10^7 solar masses assuming the distance to\nthis source of 3.7 Gpc.\n", "  A search for heavy pseudoscalar ($A$) and scalar ($H$) Higgs bosons decaying\ninto a top quark pair ($t\\bar{t}$) has been performed with 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of\nproton--proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large\nHadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV. Interference\neffects between the signal process and Standard Model $t\\bar{t}$ production,\nwhich are expected to distort the signal shape from a single peak to a\npeak--dip structure, are taken into account. No significant deviation from the\nStandard Model prediction is observed in the $t\\bar{t}$ invariant mass spectrum\nin final states with an electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum,\nand at least four jets. The results are interpreted within the context of a\ntype-II two-Higgs-doublet model. Exclusion limits on the signal strength are\nderived as a function of the mass $m_{A/H}$ and the ratio of the vacuum\nexpectation values of the two Higgs fields, $\\tan\\beta$, for $m_{A/H} > 500$\nGeV.\n", "  The requirement for an ultraviolet completable theory to be well-behaved upon\ncompactification has been suggested as a guiding principle for distinguishing\nthe landscape from the swampland. Motivated by the weak gravity conjecture and\nthe multiple point principle, we investigate the vacuum structure of the\nstandard model compactified on $S^1$ and $T^2$. The measured value of the Higgs\nmass implies, in addition to the electroweak vacuum, the existence of a new\nvacuum where the Higgs field value is around the Planck scale. We explore two-\nand three-dimensional critical points of the moduli potential arising from\ncompactifications of the electroweak vacuum as well as this high scale vacuum,\nin the presence of Majorana/Dirac neutrinos and/or axions. We point out\npotential sources of instability for these lower dimensional critical points in\nthe standard model landscape. We also point out that a high scale $AdS_4$\nvacuum of the Standard Model, if exists, would be at odd with the conjecture\nthat all non-supersymmetric $AdS$ vacua are unstable. We argue that, if we\nrequire a degeneracy between three- and four-dimensional vacua as suggested by\nthe multiple point principle, the neutrinos are predicted to be Dirac, with the\nmass of the lightest neutrino O(1-10) meV, which may be tested by future CMB,\nlarge scale structure and $21$cm line observations.\n", "  360-degree videos are a new type of movie that renders over all 4$\\pi$\nsteradian. Video sharing sites such as YouTube now allow this unique content to\nbe shared via virtual reality (VR) goggles, hand-held smartphones/tablets, and\ncomputers. Creating 360$^\\circ$ videos from astrophysical simulations is not\nonly a new way to view these simulations as you are immersed in them, but is\nalso a way to create engaging content for outreach to the public. We present\nwhat we believe is the first 360$^\\circ$ video of an astrophysical simulation:\na hydrodynamics calculation of the central parsec of the Galactic centre. We\nalso describe how to create such movies, and briefly comment on what new\nscience can be extracted from astrophysical simulations using 360$^\\circ$\nvideos.\n", "  A search for heavy resonances decaying to a $W$ or $Z$ boson and a Higgs\nboson in the $q\\bar{q}^{(\\prime)}b\\bar{b}$ final state is described. The search\nuses 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV\ncollected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and\n2016. The data are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations, with the\nlargest excess found at a resonance mass of 3.0 TeV with a local (global)\nsignificance of 3.3 (2.1) $\\sigma$. The results are presented in terms of\nconstraints on a simplified model with a heavy vector triplet. Upper limits are\nset on the production cross-section times branching ratio for resonances\ndecaying to a $W$ ($Z$) boson and a Higgs boson, itself decaying to $b\\bar{b}$,\nin the mass range between 1.1 and 3.8 TeV; the limits range between 83 and 1.6\nfb (77 and 1.1 fb) at 95% confidence level.\n", "  We provide expressions for the nonperturbative matching of the effective\nfield theory describing dark matter interactions with quarks and gluons to the\neffective theory of nonrelativistic dark matter interacting with\nnonrelativistic nucleons. We give the leading and subleading order expressions\nin chiral counting. In general, a single partonic operator already matches onto\nseveral nonrelativistic operators at leading order in chiral counting. Thus,\nkeeping only one operator at the time in the nonrelativistic effective theory\ndoes not properly describe the scattering in direct detection. Moreover, the\nmatching of the axial--axial partonic level operator, as well as the matching\nof the operators coupling DM to the QCD anomaly term, naively include momentum\nsuppressed terms. However, these are still of leading chiral order due to pion\npoles and can be numerically important. We illustrate the impact of these\neffects with several examples.\n", "  Exciton condensation in an electron-hole bilayer system of monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides is analyzed at three different levels of\ntheory to account for screening and quasiparticle renormalization. The large\neffective masses of the transition metal dichalcogenides place them in a strong\ncoupling regime. In this regime, mean field (MF) theory with either an\nunscreened or screened interlayer interaction predicts a room temperature\ncondensate. Interlayer and intralayer interactions renormalize the\nquasiparticle dispersion, and this effect is included in a GW approximation.\nThe renormalization reverses the trends predicted from the unscreened or\nscreened MF theories. In the strong coupling regime, intralayer interactions\nhave a large impact on the magnitude of the order parameter and its functional\ndependencies on effective mass and carrier density.\n", "  We consider 5d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ $Sp(1)$ gauge theory based on a brane\nconfiguration with an O5-plane. At the UV fixed point, the theory with no\nmatter enjoys enhanced global symmetry $SU(2)$ or $U(1)$ depending on the\ndiscrete theta angle $\\theta=0, \\pi$ (mod $2\\pi$). A naive brane configuration\nwith an O5-plane, however, does not distinguish two different theories, as it\ndescribes the weak coupling region. We devise a technique for computing 5d\nSeiberg-Witten curve of the two theories from the brane web with an O5-plane.\nTheir Seiberg-Witten curves show that their M5 configurations under the\npresence of OM5-planes are different. The decompactification limit of each\nSeiberg-Witten curve also shows distinct phase structures in their Coulomb\nbranch leading to significantly different $(p,q)$ 5-brane configurations with\nan O5-plane in the strong coupling region.\n", "  Aims. We define a small and large chemical network which can be used for the\nquantitative simultaneous analysis of molecular emission from the near-IR to\nthe submm. We revise reactions of excited molecular hydrogen, which are not\nincluded in UMIST, to provide a homogeneous database for future applications.\nMethods. We use the thermo-chemical disk modeling code ProDiMo and a standard T\nTauri disk model to evaluate the impact of various chemical networks, reaction\nrate databases and sets of adsorption energies on a large sample of chemical\nspecies and emerging line fluxes from the near-IR to the submm wavelength\nrange. Results. We find large differences in the masses and radial distribution\nof ice reservoirs when considering freeze-out on bare or polar ice coated\ngrains. Most strongly the ammonia ice mass and the location of the snow line\n(water) change. As a consequence molecules associated to the ice lines such as\nN2H+ change their emitting region; none of the line fluxes in the sample\nconsidered here changes by more than 25% except CO isotopologues, CN and N2H+\nlines. The three-body reaction N+H2+M plays a key role in the formation of\nwater in the outer disk. Besides that, differences between the UMIST 2006 and\n2012 database change line fluxes in the sample considered here by less than a\nfactor 2 (a subset of low excitation CO and fine structure lines stays even\nwithin 25%); exceptions are OH, CN, HCN, HCO+ and N2H+ lines. However,\ndifferent networks such as OSU and KIDA 2011 lead to pronounced differences in\nthe chemistry inside 100 au and thus affect emission lines from high excitation\nCO, OH and CN lines. H2 is easily excited at the disk surface and\nstate-to-state reactions enhance the abundance of CH+ and to a lesser extent\nHCO+. For sub-mm lines of HCN, N2H+ and HCO+, a more complex larger network is\nrecommended. ABBREVIATED\n", "  A search for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson (A) produced in association\nwith bottom quarks and decaying into a muon pair is reported. The search uses\n19.7 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy\nof 8 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment. No signal is observed in the dimuon\nmass range from 25 to 60 GeV. Upper limits on the cross section times branching\nfraction, sigma(pp to b bbar A) B(A to mu mu), are set.\n", "  The resolution of photoacoustic imaging deep inside scattering media is\nlimited by the acoustic diffraction limit. In this work, taking inspiration\nfrom super-resolution imaging techniques developed to beat the optical\ndiffraction limit, we demonstrate that the localization of individual optical\nabsorbers can provide super-resolution photoacoustic imaging well beyond the\nacoustic diffraction limit. As a proof-of-principle experiment, photoacoustic\ncross-sectional images of microfluidic channels were obtained with a 15 MHz\nlinear CMUT array while absorbing beads were flown through the channels. The\nlocalization of individual absorbers allowed to obtain super-resolved\ncross-sectional image of the channels, by reconstructing both the channel width\nand position with an accuracy better than $\\lambda/10$. Given the discrete\nnature of endogenous absorbers such as red blood cells, or that of exogenous\nparticular contrast agents, localization is a promising approach to push the\ncurrent resolution limits of photoacoustic imaging.\n", "  We extensively study the evolution and distinct signatures of cosmological\nmodels, in which dark energy interacts directly with dark matter. We first\nfocus on the imprints of these coupled models on the cosmic microwave\nbackground temperature power spectrum, in which we discuss the multipole peak\nseparation together with the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also address the\ngrowth of matter perturbations, and disentangle the interacting dark energy\nmodels using the expansion history together with the growth history. We find\nthat a disformal coupling between dark matter and dark energy induces\nintermediate-scales and time-dependent damped oscillatory features in the\nmatter growth rate function, a unique characteristic of this coupling. Apart\nfrom the disformal coupling, we also consider conformally coupled models,\ntogether with models which simultaneously make use of both couplings.\n", "  Blazars, a type of Active Galactic Nuclei, present a particular orientation\nof their jets close to the line ofsight. Their radiation is thus\nrelativistically beamed, giving rise to extreme behaviors, specially strong\nvariability on very short time-scales (i.e., microvariability). Here we present\nsimultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations of two relatively nearby\nblazars, 1ES 1959+650 and HB89 2201+044, that were obtained using the Calar\nAlto Faint Object Spectrograph mounted at the 2.2 m telescope in Calar Alto,\nSpain. An outstanding characteristic of these two blazars is the presence of\nwell resolved host galaxies. This particular feature allows us to produce a\nstudy of their intrinsic polarization, a measurement of the polarization state\nof the galactic nucleus unaffected by the host galaxy. To carry out this work,\nwe computed photometric fluxes from which we calculated the degree and\norientation of the blazars polarization. Then, we analyzed the depolarizing\neffect introduced by the host galaxy with the main goal to recover the\nintrinsic polarization of the galactic nucleus, carefully taking into\nconsideration the spurious polarimetric variability introduced by changes in\nseeing along the observing nights. We find that the two blazars do not present\nintra-night photo-polarimetric variability, although we do detect a significant\ninter-night variability. Comparing polarimetric values before and after\naccounting for the host galaxies, we observe a significant difference in the\npolarization degree of about 1 % in the case of 1ES 1959+650, and 0.3 % in the\ncase of HB89 2201+044, thus evidencing the non-negligible impact introduced by\nthe host galaxies. We note that this host galaxy effect depends on the\nweaveband, and varies with changing seeing conditions, so it should be\nparticularly considered when studying frequency-dependent polarization in\nblazars.\n", "  Electron spin dephasing in a singly charged semiconductor quantum dot can\npartially be suppressed by periodic laser pulsing. We propose a semi-classical\napproach describing the decoherence of the electron spin polarization governed\nby the hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins as well as the\nprobabilistic nature of the photon absorption. We use the steady-state Floquet\ncondition to analytically derive two subclasses of resonance conditions\nexcellently predicting the peak locations in the part of the Overhauser field\ndistribution which is projected in the direction of the external magnetic\nfield. As a consequence of the periodic pulsing, a non-equilibrium distribution\ndevelops as a function of time. The numerical simulation of the coupled\ndynamics reveals the influence of the hyperfine coupling constant distribution\nonto the evolution of the electron spin polarisation before the next laser\npulse. Experimental indications are provided for both subclasses of resonance\nconditions.\n", "  Background: Odd-odd nuclei, around doubly closed shells, have been\nextensively used to study proton-neutron interactions. However, the evolution\nof these interactions as a function of the binding energy, ultimately when\nnuclei become unbound, is poorly known. The $^{26}$F nucleus, composed of a\ndeeply bound $\\pi0d\\_{5/2}$ proton and an unbound $\\nu0d\\_{3/2}$ neutron on top\nof an $^{24}$O core, is particularly adapted for this purpose. The coupling of\nthis proton and neutron results in a $J^{\\pi} = 1^{+}\\_1 - 4^{+}\\_1$ multiplet,\nwhose energies must be determined to study the influence of the proximity of\nthe continuum on the corresponding proton-neutron interaction. The $J^{\\pi} =\n1^{+}\\_1, 2^{+}\\_1,4^{+}\\_1$ bound states have been determined, and only a\nclear identification of the $J^{\\pi} =3^{+}\\_1$ is missing.Purpose: We wish to\ncomplete the study of the $J^{\\pi} = 1^{+}\\_1 - 4^{+}\\_1$ multiplet in\n$^{26}$F, by studying the energy and width of the $J^{\\pi} =3^{+}\\_1$ unbound\nstate. The method was firstly validated by the study of unbound states in\n$^{25}$F, for which resonances were already observed in a previous\nexperiment.Method: Radioactive beams of $^{26}$Ne and $^{27}$Ne, produced at\nabout $440A$\\,MeV by the FRagment Separator at the GSI facility, were used to\npopulate unbound states in $^{25}$F and $^{26}$F via one-proton knockout\nreactions on a CH$\\_2$ target, located at the object focal point of the\nR$^3$B/LAND setup. The detection of emitted $\\gamma$-rays and neutrons, added\nto the reconstruction of the momentum vector of the $A-1$ nuclei, allowed the\ndetermination of the energy of three unbound states in $^{25}$F and two in\n$^{26}$F. Results: Based on its width and decay properties, the first unbound\nstate in $^{25}$F is proposed to be a $J^{\\pi} = 1/2^-$ arising from a\n$p\\_{1/2}$ proton-hole state. In $^{26}$F, the first resonance at 323(33)~keV\nis proposed to be the $J^{\\pi} =3^{+}\\_1$ member of the $J^{\\pi} = 1^{+}\\_1 -\n4^{+}\\_1$ multiplet. Energies of observed states in $^{25,26}$F have been\ncompared to calculations using the independent-particle shell model, a\nphenomenological shell-model, and the ab initio valence-space in-medium\nsimilarity renormalization group method.Conclusions: The deduced effective\nproton-neutron interaction is weakened by about 30-40\\% in comparison to the\nmodels, pointing to the need of implementing the role of the continuum in\ntheoretical descriptions, or to a wrong determination of the atomic mass of\n$^{26}$F.\n", "  We compute the thermal X-ray emission from hydrodynamic simulations of the 30\nWolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting within a parsec of Sgr A$^*$, with the aim of\ninterpreting the Chandra X-ray observations of this region. The model well\nreproduces the spectral shape of the observations, indicating that the shocked\nWR winds are the dominant source of this thermal emission. The model X-ray flux\nis tied to the strength of the Sgr A$^*$ outflow, which clears out hot gas from\nthe vicinity of Sgr A$^*$. A moderate outflow best fits the present-day\nobservations, even though this supermassive black hole (SMBH) outflow ended\n$\\sim$100 yr ago.\n", "  We present high energy X-ray diffraction studies on the structural phases of\nan optimal high-$T_c$ superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{4+y}$ tailored by\nco-hole-doping. This is specifically done by varying the content of two very\ndifferent chemical species, Sr and O, respectively, in order to study the\ninfluence of each. A superstructure known as staging is observed in all\nsamples, with the staging number $n$ increasing for higher Sr dopings $x$. We\nfind that the staging phases emerge abruptly with temperature, and can be\ndescribed as a second order phase transition with transition temperatures\nslightly depending on the Sr doping. The Sr appears to correlate the\ninterstitial oxygen in a way that stabilises the reproducibility of the staging\nphase both in terms of staging period and volume fraction in a specific sample.\nThe structural details as investigated in this letter appear to have no direct\nbearing on the electronic phase separation previously observed in the same\nsamples. This provides new evidence that the electronic phase separation is\ndetermined by the overall hole concentration rather than specific Sr/O content\nand concommittant structural details.\n", "  Huygens sources are elements that scatter light in the forward direction as\nused in the Huygens-Fresnel principle. They have remained fictitious until\nrecently where experimental systems have been fabricated. In this letter, we\npropose isotropic meta-atoms that act as Huygens sources. Using clusters of\nplasmonic or dielectric colloidal particles, Huygens dipoles that resonate at\nvisible frequencies can be achieved with scattering cross-sections as high as 5\ntimes the geometric cross-section of the particle surpassing anything\nachievable with a hypothetical simple spherical particle. Examples are given\nthat predict extremely broadband scattering in the forward direction over a\n1000 nm wavelength range at optical frequencies. These systems are important to\nthe fields of nanoantennas, metamaterials and wave physics in general as well\nas any application that requires local control over the radiation properties of\na system as in solar cells or bio-sensing.\n", "  It is by now well established that noise itself can be useful for performing\nquantum information processing tasks. We present results which show how one can\neffectively reduce the error rate associated with a noisy quantum channel, by\ncounteracting its detrimental effects with another form of noise. In\nparticular, we consider the effect of adding on top of a purely Markovian\n(Lindblad) dynamics, a more general form of dissipation, which we refer to as\ngeneralized-Markovian noise. This noise has an associated memory kernel and the\nresulting dynamics is described by an integro-differential equation. The\noverall dynamics are characterized by decay rates which depend not only on the\noriginal dissipative time-scales, but also on the new integral kernel. We find\nthat one can engineer this kernel such that the overall rate of decay is\nlowered by the addition of this noise term. We illustrate this technique for\nthe case where the bare noise is described by a dephasing Pauli channel. We\nanalytically solve this model, and show that one can effectively double (or\neven triple) the length of the channel, whilst achieving the same fidelity,\nentanglement, and error threshold. We numerically verify this scheme can also\nbe used to protect against thermal Markovian noise (at non-zero temperature),\nwhich models spontaneous emission and excitation processes. A physical\ninterpretation of this scheme is discussed, whereby the added\ngeneralized-Markovian noise causes the system to become periodically decoupled\nfrom the background Markovian noise.\n", "  Because of vast volume of data being produced by today's scientific\nsimulations and experiments, lossy data compressor allowing user-controlled\nloss of accuracy during the compression is a relevant solution for\nsignificantly reducing the data size. However, lossy compressor developers and\nusers are missing a tool to explore the features of scientific datasets and\nunderstand the data alteration after compression in a systematic and reliable\nway. To address this gap, we have designed and implemented a generic framework\ncalled Z-checker. On the one hand, Z-checker combines a battery of data\nanalysis components for data compression. On the other hand, Z-checker is\nimplemented as an open-source community tool to which users and developers can\ncontribute and add new analysis components based on their additional analysis\ndemands. In this paper, we present a survey of existing lossy compressors. Then\nwe describe the design framework of Z-checker, in which we integrated\nevaluation metrics proposed in prior work as well as other analysis tools.\nSpecifically, for lossy compressor developers, Z-checker can be used to\ncharacterize critical properties of any dataset to improve compression\nstrategies. For lossy compression users, Z-checker can detect the compression\nquality, provide various global distortion analysis comparing the original data\nwith the decompressed data and statistical analysis of the compression error.\nZ-checker can perform the analysis with either coarse granularity or fine\ngranularity, such that the users and developers can select the best-fit,\nadaptive compressors for different parts of the dataset. Z-checker features a\nvisualization interface displaying all analysis results in addition to some\nbasic views of the datasets such as time series. To the best of our knowledge,\nZ-checker is the first tool designed to assess lossy compression\ncomprehensively for scientific datasets.\n", "  The transition between a metallic and a pseudogap phase in high-$T_c$ cuprate\nsuperconductors is the subject of experimental investigations but has not been\nsettled theoretically, even within the context of the Hubbard model. We apply\nthe Cluster Dynamical Impurity Approximation (CDIA) to the anisotropic Hubbard\nmodel on the square lattice at zero temperature and finite doping. This\napproach can detect a first-order transition between two metallic states: a\npseudogap state at low doping, with a depleted density of states at the Fermi\nlevel, and a correlated metal at higher doping. This transition was first seen\nin Cluster dynamical mean field theory at finite temperature by Sordi et al on\nthe isotropic Hubbard model. Here we investigate this transition at zero\ntemperature and a as function of on-site interaction $U$, anisotropy $t_y/t_x$\nand doping. We find a first-order transition line which ends at a quantum\ncritical point, which occurs around $t_y/t_x\\sim 0.5$.\n", "  We calculate the decay rate and spectrum for the decay of parapositronium\ninto three photons. This process violates charge conjugation symmetry. It is\nforbidden within quantum electrodynamics but proceeds through the weak\ninteraction. The branching ratio we find is fifty orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the previous estimate.\n", "  We report on magnetic field dependence of half-integer quantized conductance\nplateaus (HQPs) in InAs quantum wires. We observed HQPs at zero applied\nmagnetic field in InAs quantum wires fabricated from a high-quality InAs\nquantum well. The application of in-plane magnetic field causes Zeeman\nsplitting of the HQP features, indicating that the origin of the observed HQP\nis not spontaneous spin polarization. Additionally we observe that conductance\nof the split HQPs decreases gradually as the in-plane magnetic field increases.\nWe finally assume electron-electron interaction as a possible mechanism to\naccount for the zero-field HQPs and the anomalous field dependence.\n", "  Modern high-resolution images obtained with space observatories display\nextremely strong intensity variations across images on all spatial scales.\nSource extraction in such images with methods based on global thresholding may\nbring unacceptably large numbers of spurious sources in bright areas while\nfailing to detect sources in low-background or low-noise areas. It would be\nhighly beneficial to subtract background and equalize the levels of small-scale\nfluctuations in the images before extracting sources or filaments. This paper\ndescribes getimages, a new method of background derivation and image\nflattening. It is based on median filtering with sliding windows that\ncorrespond to a range of spatial scales from the observational beam size up to\na maximum structure width $X_{\\lambda}$. The latter is a single free parameter\nof getimages that can be evaluated manually from the observed image\n$\\mathcal{I}_{\\lambda}$. The median filtering algorithm provides a background\nimage $\\tilde{\\mathcal{B}}_{\\lambda}$ for structures of all widths below\n$X_{\\lambda}$. The same median filtering procedure applied to an image of\nstandard deviations $\\mathcal{D}_{\\lambda}$ derived from a\nbackground-subtracted image $\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_{\\lambda}$ results in a\nflattening image $\\tilde{\\mathcal{F}}_{\\lambda}$. Finally, a flattened\ndetection image\n$\\mathcal{I}_{{\\lambda}\\mathrm{D}}{\\,=\\,}\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}_{\\lambda}{/}\\tilde{\\mathcal{F}}_{\\lambda}$\nis computed, whose standard deviations are uniform outside sources and\nfilaments. Detecting sources in such greatly simplified images results in much\ncleaner extractions that are more complete and reliable. As a bonus, getimages\nreduces various observational and map-making artifacts and equalizes noise\nlevels between independent tiles of mosaicked images.\n", "  Recent observations of the debris disk of AU Mic have revealed asymmetric,\nfast outward-moving arch-like structures above the disk midplane. No model can\nreadily explain the characteristics of these features. We present a model\naiming to reproduce the dynamics of these structures, more specifically their\nhigh projected speeds and their apparent position. We test the hypothesis of\ndust emitted by a point source and then expelled from the system by the strong\nstellar wind of this young, M-type star. In this model, we make the assumption\nthat the dust grains follow the same dynamics as the structures. We perform\nnumerical simulations of test particle trajectories to explore the available\nparameter space, in particular the radial location $R_{0}$ of the dust\nproducing parent body and the size of the dust grains as parameterized by\n$\\beta$ (ratio of stellar wind and radiation pressure forces over gravitation).\nWe consider both the case of a static and an orbiting parent body. We find\nthat, for all considered scenarii, there is always a set of ($R_0, \\beta$)\nparameters able to fit the observed features. The common characteristics of\nthese solutions is that they all require a high value of $\\beta$, of around 6.\nThis means that the star is probably very active and the grains composing the\nstructures are sub-micronic, in order to reach such high $\\beta$ values. As for\nthe location of the hypothetical parent body, we constrain it to lie around 8\nau (orbiting case) or 28 au (static case). We show that the scenario of\nsequential dust releases by an unseen, punctual parent body is able to explain\nthe radial behaviour of the observed structures. We predict the evolution of\nthe structures to help future observations to discriminate between the\ndifferent parent body configurations that have been considered. We expect new\nstructures to appear on the northwest side of the disk in the coming years.\n", "  HD 189733 is an exoplanetary system consisting of a transiting hot Jupiter\nand an active K2V-type main sequence star. We aim to use VLT/UVES high\nresolution echelle spectra to study a stellar flare. We have performed\nsimultaneous analyses of the temporal evolution in several chromospheric\nstellar lines, namely, the Ca II H and K lines, Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta,\nHepsilon, the Ca II infrared triplet line, and He I D3. Observations were\ncarried out with a time resolution of approximately 1 min for a duration of\nfour hours, including a complete planetary transit. We determine the energy\nreleased during the flare in all studied chromospheric lines combined to be\nabout 8.7e31 erg, which puts this event at the upper end of flare energies\nobserved on the Sun. Our analysis does not reveal any significant delay of the\nflare peak observed in the Balmer and Ca II H and K lines, although we find a\nclear difference in the temporal evolution of these lines. The He I D3 shows\nadditional absorption possibly related to the flare event. Based on the flux\nreleased in Ca II H and K lines during the flare, we estimate the soft X-ray\nflux emission to be 7e30 erg. The observed flare can be ranked as a moderate\nflare on a K-type star and confirms a rather high activity level of HD 189733\nhost star. The cores of the studied chromospheric lines demonstrate the same\nbehavior and let us study the flare evolution. We demonstrate that the activity\nof an exoplanet host star can play an important role in the detection of\nexoplanet atmospheres, since these are frequently discovered as an additional\nabsorption in the line cores. A possible star-planet interaction responsible\nfor a flare occurrence during a transit can neither be confirmed nor ruled out.\n", "  The dynamic polarization of nuclear spins by photoexcited electrons is\nstudied in a high quality GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. We find a surprisingly high\nefficiency of the spin transfer from the electrons to the nuclei as reflected\nby a maximum nuclear field of 0.9 T in a tilted external magnetic field of 1 T\nstrength only. This high efficiency is due to a low leakage of spin out of the\npolarized nuclear system, because mechanisms of spin relaxation other than the\nhyperfine interaction are strongly suppressed, leading to a long nuclear\nrelaxation time of up to 1000 s. A key ingredient to that end is the low\nimpurity concentration inside the heterostructure, while the electrostatic\npotential from charged impurities in the surrounding barriers becomes screened\nthrough illumination by which the spin relaxation time is increased compared to\nkeeping the system in the dark. This finding indicates a strategy for obtaining\nhigh nuclear spin polarization as required for long-lasting carrier spin\ncoherence.\n", "  While the atomistic Green's function (AGF) method has the potential to\ncompute spectrally resolved phonon transport across interfaces, most prior\nformulations of the AGF method provide only the total phonon transmission\nfunction that includes contributions from all phonon branches or channels. In\nthis work, we present a formulation of the conventional AGF technique in terms\nof phonon eigenspectra that provides a natural decomposition of the total\ntransmission function into contributions from various phonon modes. The method\ninvolves the use of Dyson and Lippmann-Schwinger equations to determine surface\nGreen's functions from the phonon eigenspectrum of the bulk, and establishes a\ndirect connection between the transmission function and the bulk phonon spectra\nof the materials forming the interface. We elucidate our formulation of the AGF\ntechnique through its application to a microscopic picture of phonon mode\nconversion at Si-Ge interfaces with atomic intermixing. Intermixing of atoms\nnear the interface is shown to increase the phase space available for phonon\nmode conversion and to enhance thermal interface conductance at moderate levels\nof atomic mixing. The eigenspectrum-based AGF (EAGF) method should be useful in\ndetermination of microscopic mechanisms of phonon scattering and identification\nof the specific modes that dominate thermal transport across an interface.\n", "  Several observational works have shown the existence of Jupiter-mass planets\ncovering a wide range of semi-major axes around Sun-like stars. We aim to\nanalyse the planetary formation processes around Sun-like stars that host a\nJupiter-mass planet at intermediate distances ranging from $\\sim$1 au to 2 au.\nOur study focusses on the formation and evolution of terrestrial-like planets\nand water delivery in the habitable zone (HZ) of the system. Our goal is also\nto analyse the long-term dynamical stability of the resulting systems. A\nsemi-analytic model was used to define the properties of a protoplanetary disk\nthat produces a Jupiter-mass planet around the snow line, which is located at\n$\\sim$2.7 au for a solar-mass star. Then, it was used to describe the evolution\nof embryos and planetesimals during the gaseous phase up to the formation of\nthe Jupiter-mass planet, and we used the results as the initial conditions to\ncarry out N-body simulations of planetary accretion. Our simulations produce\nthree different classes of planets in the HZ: 'water worlds', with masses\nbetween 2.75 $M_{\\oplus}$ and 3.57 $M_{\\oplus}$ and water contents of 58% and\n75% by mass, terrestrial-like planets, with masses ranging from 0.58\n$M_{\\oplus}$ to 3.8 $M_{\\oplus}$ and water contents less than 1.2% by mass, and\n'dry worlds', simulations of which show no water. A relevant result suggests\nthe efficient coexistence in the HZ of a Jupiter-mass planet and a\nterrestrial-like planet with a percentage of water by mass comparable to the\nEarth. Moreover, our study indicates that these planetary systems are\ndynamically stable for at least 1 Gyr. Systems with a Jupiter-mass planet\nlocated at 1.5 au - 2 au around solar-type stars are of astrobiological\ninterest. These systems are likely to harbour terrestrial-like planets in the\nHZ with a wide diversity of water contents.\n", "  We review multiwavelength properties of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) created by\nsupersonically moving pulsars and the effects of pulsar motion on the PWN\nmorphologies and the ambient medium. Supersonic pulsar wind nebulae (SPWNe) are\ncharacterized by bow-shaped shocks around the pulsar and/or cometary tails\nfilled with the shocked pulsar wind. In the past several years significant\nadvances in SPWN studies have been made in deep observations with the Chandra\nand XMM-Newton X-ray Observatories as well as the Hubble Space Telescope. In\nparticular, these observations have revealed very diverse SPWN morphologies in\nthe pulsar vicinity, different spectral behaviors of long pulsar tails, the\npresence of puzzling outflows misaligned with the pulsar velocity, and far-UV\nbow shocks. Here we review the current observational status focusing on recent\ndevelopments and their implications.\n", "  A direct $Q_{EC}$-value measurement of the superallowed $\\beta^+$ emitter\n$^{22}$Mg was performed using TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science\n(TITAN). The direct ground-state to ground-state atomic mass difference between\n$^{22}$Mg and $^{22}$Na was determined to be $Q_{EC}=4781.40(22)$~keV,\nrepresenting the most precise single measurement of this quantity to date. In a\ncontinued push towards calculating superallowed isospin-symmetry-breaking (ISB)\ncorrections from first principles, ab-initio shell-model calculations of the\n$A=22$ IMME are also presented for the first time using the valence-space\nin-medium similarity renormalization group formalism. With particular starting\ntwo- and three-nucleon forces, this approach demonstrates a level of agreement\nwith the experimental data that suggests reliable ab-initio calculations of\nsuperallowed ISB corrections are now possible.\n", "  The Thirring model is a four-fermion theory with a current-current\ninteraction and $U(2N)$ chiral symmetry. It is closely related to\nthree-dimensional QED and other models used to describe properties of graphene.\nIn addition it serves as a toy model to study chiral symmetry breaking. In the\nlimit of flavour number $N \\to 1/2$ it is equivalent to the Gross-Neveu model,\nwhich shows a parity-breaking discrete phase transition. The model was already\nstudied with different methods, including Dyson-Schwinger equations, functional\nrenormalisation group methods and lattice simulations. Most studies agree that\nthere is a phase transition from a symmetric phase to a spontaneously broken\nphase for a small number of fermion flavours, but no symmetry breaking for\nlarge $N$. But there is no consensus on the critical flavour number\n$N^\\text{cr}$ above which there is no phase transition anymore and on further\ndetails of the critical behaviour. Values of $N$ found in the literature vary\nbetween $2$ and $7$.\n  All earlier lattice studies were performed with staggered fermions. Thus it\nis questionable if in the continuum limit the lattice model recovers the\ninternal symmetries of the continuum model. We present new results from lattice\nMonte Carlo simulations of the Thirring model with SLAC fermions which exactly\nimplement all internal symmetries of the continuum model even at finite lattice\nspacing. If we reformulate the model in an irreducible representation of the\nClifford algebra, we find, in contradiction to earlier results, that the\nbehaviour for even and odd flavour numbers is very different: For even flavour\nnumbers, chiral and parity symmetry are always unbroken. For odd flavour\nnumbers parity symmetry is spontaneously broken below the critical flavour\nnumber $N_\\text{ir}^\\text{cr}=9$ while chiral symmetry is still unbroken.\n", "  We suggest that the Majorana neutrino should be regarded as a Bogoliubov\nquasiparticle that is consistently understood only by use of a relativistic\nanalogue of the Bogoliubov transformation. The unitary charge conjugation\ncondition ${\\cal C}\\psi{\\cal C}^{\\dagger}=\\psi$ is not maintained in the\ndefinition of a quantum Majorana fermion from a Weyl fermion. This is remedied\nby the Bogoliubov transformation accompanying a redefinition of the charge\nconjugation properties of vacuum, such that a C-noninvariant fermion number\nviolating term (condensate) is converted to a Dirac mass. We also comment on\nthe chiral symmetry of a Majorana fermion; a massless Majorana fermion is\ninvariant under a global chiral transformation $\\psi\\rightarrow\n\\exp[i\\alpha\\gamma_{5}]\\psi$ and different Majorana fermions are distinguished\nby different chiral $U(1)$ charge assignments. The reversed process, namely,\nthe definition of a Weyl fermion from a well-defined massless Majorana fermion\nis also briefly discussed.\n", "  Core collapse supernova simulations can be sensitive to neutrino interactions\nnear the neutrinosphere. This is the surface of last scattering. We model the\nneutrinosphere region as a warm unitary gas of neutrons. A unitary gas is a low\ndensity system of particles with large scattering lengths. We calculate\nmodifications to neutrino scattering cross sections because of the universal\nspin and density correlations of a unitary gas. These correlations can be\nstudied in laboratory cold atom experiments. We find significant reductions in\ncross sections, compared to free space interactions, even at relatively low\ndensities. These reductions could reduce the delay time from core bounce to\nsuccessful explosion in multidimensional supernova simulations.\n", "  Singularities, i.e. places of discontinuities of parameters are extremely\ngeneral objects appearing in electromagnetic waves and thus are the key to\nunderstanding fundamental wave processes. These structures commonly occur in\npurely coherent, highly directional waves, such as laser beams, determining\nadditional spatial or \"`topological\"' properties of the wave fields\nindependently of their propagational dynamics. For instance, topologies of wave\nfronts, called phase singularities, add orbital degrees of freedom to\nelectromagnetic waves. These singularities are common to all types of scalar\nwaves described only by their intensity and phase distributions. As the\nelectromagnetic wave is a vector wave, its topological properties generally\ndepend on all field components leading to complex field patterns in space and\ntime. These patterns may contain singular points of undefined instantaneous\norientation of the vector field, i.e. the instantaneous field (IF)\nsingularities. In zero-order paraxial approximation of purely transverse\nelectromagnetic waves, some instantaneous field distributions may carry\napparent topological monopoles, when the originally source-free wave exhibits\nspatial structure associated with the 2D \"virtual\" sources of electromagnetic\nfields. Here we present systematic description of topological singularities in\nboth electric and magnetic field of the electromagnetic waves in a paraxial\napproximation. We also consider the important types of paraxial electromagnetic\nwaves with complex transverse field structures containing instantaneous field\nsingularities.\n", "  The use of the spotless days to predict the future solar activity is here\nrevised based on the new version of the sunspot number index with a 24-month\nfilter. Data from Solar Cycle (SC) 10 are considered because from this solar\ncycle the temporal coverage of the records is 100 %. The interrelationships of\nthe timing characteristics of spotless days and their comparison with sunspot\ncycle parameters are explored, in some cases finding very strong correlations.\nSuch is the case for the relationship between the minimum time between spotless\ndays either side of a given solar maximum and the maximum time between spotless\ndays either side in the previous solar minimum, with r = -0.91 and a p-value <\n0.001. However, the predictions for SC 24 or 23 made by other authors in\nprevious works using the spotless days as a predictor of solar activity are not\ngood since it has not been fulfilled. Although there seems to be a pattern of\nstrong correlation for some relationships between the parameters studied,\nprediction of future solar cycles from these parameters defined as functions of\nthe spotless days should be made with caution because sometimes the estimated\nvalues are far from the observed ones. Finally, SC 23 seems to show a mode\nchange, a break respect to the behavior of their previous solar cycles and more\nsimilar to SC 10-15.\n", "  We study the two-step spin crossover in a double-layered elastic model based\non transition metal complexes each taking high spin (HS) and low spin (LS)\nstates. Here, only the simplest elastic interactions between adjacent molecules\nare considered and the system is exposed to the external pressure within the\nframework of $NPT$-Monte Carlo method. As a certain amount of pressure is\napplied, the first order thermal transition between uniform HS and LS phases\ntransforms to a two-step transition with an emergent intermediate spin (IS)\nphase, where the HS and LS molecules are paired face to face between layers and\nform diagonally striped clusters within the layer. The difference in the size\nof HS and LS molecules is reflected both in the elastic interactions and in the\nenthalpy, and the IS phase could gain the latter over the loss of the former by\nsignificantly reducing its volume. The present pressure effect is interpreted\nto the chemical one in double-layered transition metal materials, which\nactually reveals a variety of multistep spin crossover transitions relevant to\nour numerical result.\n", "  One of the striking features of QED is that charged particles create a\ncoherent cloud of photons. The resultant coherent state vectors of photons\ngenerate a non-trivial representation of the localized algebra of observables\nthat do not support a representation of the Lorentz group: Lorentz symmetry is\nspontaneously broken. We show in particular that Lorentz boost generators\ndiverge in this representation, a result shown also in [1] (See also [2]).\nLocalization of observables, for example in the Rindler wedge, uses Poincar\\'e\ninvariance in an essential way [3]. Hence in the presence of charged fields,\nthe photon observables cannot be localized in the Rindler wedge.\n  These observations may have a bearing on the black hole information loss\nparadox, as the physics in the exterior of the black hole has points of\nresemblance to that in the Rindler wedge.\n", "  Small solids embedded in gaseous protoplanetary disks are subject to strong\ndust-gas friction. Consequently, tightly-coupled dust particles almost follow\nthe gas flow. This near conservation of dust-to-gas ratio along streamlines is\nanalogous to the near conservation of entropy along flows of (dust-free) gas\nwith weak heating and cooling. We develop this thermodynamic analogy into a\nframework to study dusty gas dynamics in protoplanetary disks. We show that an\nisothermal dusty gas behaves like an adiabatic pure gas; and that finite\ndust-gas coupling may be regarded as an effective heating/cooling. We exploit\nthis correspondence to deduce that 1) perfectly coupled, thin dust layers\ncannot cause axisymmetric instabilities; 2) radial dust edges are unstable if\nthe dust is vertically well-mixed; 3) the streaming instability necessarily\ninvolves a gas pressure response that lags behind dust density; 4) dust-loading\nintroduces buoyancy forces that generally stabilizes the vertical shear\ninstability associated with global radial temperature gradients. We also\ndiscuss dusty analogs of other hydrodynamic processes (e.g. Rossby wave\ninstability, convective overstability, and zombie vortices), and how to\nsimulate dusty protoplanetary disks with minor tweaks to existing codes for\npure gas dynamics.\n", "  Calibration of the Advanced LIGO detectors is the quantification of the\ndetectors' response to gravitational waves. Gravitational waves incident on the\ndetectors cause phase shifts in the interferometer laser light which are read\nout as intensity fluctuations at the detector output. Understanding this\ndetector response to gravitational waves is crucial to producing accurate and\nprecise gravitational wave strain data. Estimates of binary black hole and\nneutron star parameters and tests of general relativity require well-calibrated\ndata, as miscalibrations will lead to biased results. We describe the method of\nproducing calibration uncertainty estimates for both LIGO detectors in the\nfirst and second observing runs.\n", "  We evaluate the two-photon exchange correction to the elastic electron-proton\nscattering cross section within a dispersive framework. Besides the elastic\ncontribution, we account for all $\\pi N$ intermediate state contributions using\nthe phenomenological MAID fit as an input. We develop a novel method for the\nanalytical continuation of the two-photon exchange amplitudes into the\nunphysical region and generalize our previous work to the momentum transfer\nregion $ 0.064~\\mathrm{GeV}^2 \\lesssim Q^2 \\lesssim 1~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$. We\ncompare our results with recent OLYMPUS, CLAS and VEPP-3 data as well as with\nempirical fits and estimates in the forward angular region.\n", "  A long-standing problem in magnetic reconnection is to explain why it tends\nto proceed at or below a normalized rate of 0.1. This article gives a review of\nobservational and numerical evidence for this rate and discusses recent\ntheoretical work addressing this problem. Some remaining open questions are\nsummarized.\n", "  Using the spectroscopic imaging capabilities of the Swedish Solar Telescope,\nwe aim to provide the first investigation on the nature and dynamics of\nelongated absorption features (fibrils) observed in H$\\alpha$ in the\ninternetwork. We observe and identify a number of internetwork fibrils, which\nform away from the kilogauss, network magnetic flux, and we provide a synoptic\nview on their behaviour. The internetwork fibrils are found to support\nwave-like behaviour, which we interpret as Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink\nwaves. The properties of these waves, that is, amplitude, period, and\npropagation speed, are measured from time-distance diagrams and we attempt to\nexploit them via magneto-seismology in order to probe the variation of plasma\nproperties along the wave-guides. We found that the Internetwork (IN) fibrils\nappear, disappear, and re-appear on timescales of tens of minutes, suggesting\nthat they are subject to repeated heating. No clear photospheric footpoints for\nthe fibrils are found in photospheric magnetograms or H$\\alpha$ wing images.\nHowever, we suggest that they are magnetised features as the majority of them\nshow evidence of supporting propagating MHD kink waves, with a modal period of\n$120$~s. Additionally, one IN fibril is seen to support a flow directed along\nits elongated axis, suggesting a guiding field. The wave motions are found to\npropagate at speeds significantly greater than estimates for typical\nchromospheric sound speeds. Through their interpretation as kink waves, the\nmeasured speeds provide an estimate for local average Alfv\\'en speeds.\nFurthermore, the amplitudes of the waves are also found to vary as a function\nof distance along the fibrils, which can be interpreted as evidence of\nstratification of the plasma in the neighbourhood of the IN fibril.\n", "  We reconstruct $F(\\mathcal{G})$ gravity theory with an exponential scale\nfactor to realize the bouncing behavior in the early universe and examine the\nasymptotic behaviour of late-time solutions in this model. We propose an\napproach to the construction of asymptotic expansions of solutions of the\nFriedmann equations on the basis of Puiseux series.\n", "  Quantum tomography is the standard method of reconstructing the Wigner\nfunction of quantum states of light by means of balanced homodyne detection.\nThe reconstruction quality strongly depends on the photodetectors quantum\nefficiency and other losses in the measurement setup. In this article we\nanalyse in detail a protocol of enhanced quantum tomography, proposed by\nLeonhardt and Paul in 1994, which allows one to reduce the degrading effect of\ndetection losses. It is based on phase sensitive parametric amplification, with\nthe phase of the amplified quadrature being scanned synchronously with the\nlocal oscil- lator phase. Although with sufficiently strong amplification the\nprotocol enables overcoming any detection inefficiency, it was so far not\nimplemented in experiment, probably due to the losses in the amplifier. Here we\ndiscuss a possible proof-of-principle experiment with a traveling-wave\nparametric amplifier. We show that with the state-of-the art optical elements,\nthe protocol enables high-fidelity tomographic reconstruction of bright\nnonclassical states of light. We consider two examples: bright squeezed vacuum\nand squeezed single-photon state, with the latter being a non-Gaussian state\nand both strongly affected by the losses.\n", "  The diffusion-controlled growth and microstructural evolution at the\ninterface of aluminide coatings and different substrates such as Ni-base\nsuperalloys and steel are reviewed. Quantitative diffusion analysis indicates\nthat the diffusion rates of components in the beta-NiAl phase increases with\nthe addition of Pt. This directly reflects on the growth rate of the\ninterdiffusion zone. The thickness and formation of precipitates between the\nbond coat and the superalloys increase significantly with the Pt addition.\nMainly Fe2Al5 phase grows during hot dip aluminization of steel along with few\nother phases with very thin layer. Chemical vapor deposition process is being\nestablished for a better control of the composition of the Fe-aluminide coating\non steel.\n", "  In our previous work (Paper I) we applied several models of high-frequency\nquasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) to estimate the spin of the central\ncompact object in three Galactic microquasars assuming the possibility that the\ncentral compact body is a super-spinning object (or a naked singularity) with\nexternal spacetime described by Kerr geometry with a dimensionless spin\nparameter $a\\equiv cJ/GM^2>1$. Here we extend our consideration, and in a\nconsistent way investigate implications of a set of ten resonance models so far\ndiscussed only in the context of $a<1$. The same physical arguments as in Paper\nI are applied to these models, i.e. only a small deviation of the spin estimate\nfrom $a=1$, $a\\gtrsim 1$, is assumed for a favoured model. For five of these\nmodels that involve Keplerian and radial epicyclic oscillations we find the\nexistence of a unique specific QPO excitation radius. Consequently, there is a\nsimple behaviour of dimensionless frequency $M\\times\\nu_{U}(a)$ represented by\na single continuous function having solely one maximum close to $a\\gtrsim1$.\nOnly one of these models is compatible with the expectation of $a\\gtrsim 1$.\nThe other five models that involve the radial and vertical epicyclic\noscillations imply the existence of multiple resonant radii. This signifies a\nmore complicated behaviour of $M\\times\\nu_{U}(a)$ that cannot be represented by\nsingle functions. Each of these five models is compatible with the expectation\nof $a\\gtrsim 1$.\n", "  We carried out temperature-dependent (20 - 550 K) measurements of resonant\ninelastic X-ray scattering on LaCoO$_3$ to investigate the evolution of its\nelectronic structure across the spin-state crossover. In combination with\ncharge-transfer multiplet calculations, we accurately quantized the\nrenormalized crystal-field excitation energies and spin-state populations. We\nshow that the screening of the on-site Coulomb interaction of 3d electrons is\norbital selective and coupled to the spin-state crossover in LaCoO$_3$. The\nresults establish that the gradual spin-state crossover is associated with a\nrelative change of Coulomb energy versus bandwidth, leading to a Mott-type\ninsulator-to-metal transition.\n", "  Two signatures of quantum effects on radiation reaction in the collision of a\n~GeV electron-beam with a high-intensity (>3x10^20W/cm^2) laser-pulse have been\nconsidered. We show that the decrease in the average energy of the\nelectron-beam may be used to measure the Gaunt factor g for synchrotron\nemission. We derive an equation for the evolution of the variance in the energy\nof the electron-beam in the quantum regime, i.e. quantum efficiency parameter\neta > 0.1$. We show that the evolution of the variance may be used as a direct\nmeasure of the quantum stochasticity of the radiation reaction and determine\nthe parameter regime where this is observable. For example, stochastic emission\nresults in a 25% increase in the standard deviation of the energy spectrum of a\nGeV electron beam, 1 fs after it collides with a laser pulse of intensity 10^21\nW/cm^2. This effect should therefore be measurable using current high-intensity\nlaser systems.\n", "  Hot collisionless accretion flows, such as the one in Sgr A$^{*}$ at our\nGalactic center, provide a unique setting for the investigation of magnetic\nreconnection. Here, protons are non-relativistic while electrons can be\nultra-relativistic. By means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations,\nwe investigate electron and proton heating in the outflows of\ntrans-relativistic reconnection (i.e., $\\sigma_w\\sim 0.1-1$, where the\nmagnetization $\\sigma_w$ is the ratio of magnetic energy density to enthalpy\ndensity). For both electrons and protons, we find that heating at high\n$\\beta_{\\rm i}$ (here, $\\beta_{\\rm i}$ is the ratio of proton thermal pressure\nto magnetic pressure) is dominated by adiabatic compression ('adiabatic\nheating'), while at low $\\beta_{\\rm i}$ it is accompanied by a genuine increase\nin entropy ('irreversible heating'). For our fiducial $\\sigma_w=0.1$, the\nirreversible heating efficiency at $\\beta_{\\rm i}\\lesssim 1$ is nearly\nindependent of the electron-to-proton temperature ratio $T_{\\rm e}/T_{\\rm i}$\n(which we vary from $0.1$ up to $1$), and it asymptotes to $\\sim 2\\%$ of the\ninflowing magnetic energy in the low-$\\beta_{\\rm i}$ limit. Protons are heated\nmore efficiently than electrons at low and moderate $\\beta_{\\rm i}$ (by a\nfactor of $\\sim7$), whereas the electron and proton heating efficiencies become\ncomparable at $\\beta_{\\rm i}\\sim 2$ if $T_{\\rm e}/T_{\\rm i}=1$, when both\nspecies start already relativistically hot. We find comparable heating\nefficiencies between the two species also in the limit of relativistic\nreconnection ($\\sigma_w\\gtrsim 1$). Our results have important implications for\nthe two-temperature nature of collisionless accretion flows, and may provide\nthe sub-grid physics needed in general relativistic MHD simulations.\n", "  The damping process of a homogeneous oscillating scalar field that indirectly\ninteracts with a thermal bath through a mediator field is investigated over a\nwide range of model parameters. We consider two types of mediator fields, those\nthat can decay to the thermal bath and those that are individually stable but\npair annihilate. The former case has been extensively studied in the literature\nby treating the damping as a local effect after integrating out the assumed\nclose-to-equilibrium mediator field. The same approach does not apply if the\nmediator field is stable and freezes out of equilibrium. To account for the\nlatter case, we adopt a non-local description of damping that is only\nmeaningful when we consider full half-oscillations of the field being damped.\nThe damping rates of the oscillating scalar field and the corresponding heating\nrate of the thermal bath in all bulk parameter regions are calculated in both\ncases, corroborating previous results in the direct decay case. Using the\nobtained results, the time it takes for the amplitude of the scalar field to be\nsubstantially damped is estimated.\n", "  There is now substantial evidence that the progenitors of some core-collapse\nsupernovae undergo enhanced or extreme mass loss prior to explosion. The\nimprint of this mass loss is observed in the spectra and dynamics of the\nexpanding blastwave on timescales of days to years after core-collapse, and the\neffects on the spectral and dynamical evolution may linger long after the\nsupernova has evolved into the remnant stage. In this paper, we present for the\nfirst time, largely self-consistent end-to-end simulations for the evolution of\na massive star from the pre-main sequence, up to and through core collapse, and\ninto the remnant phase. We present three models and compare and contrast how\nthe progenitor mass loss history impacts the dynamics and spectral evolution of\nthe supernovae and supernova remnants. We study a model which only includes\nsteady mass loss, a model with enhanced mass loss over a period of $\\sim$ 5000\nyears prior to core-collapse, and a model with extreme mass loss over a period\nof $\\sim$ 500 years prior to core collapse. The models are not meant to address\nany particular supernova or supernova remnant, but rather to highlight the\nimportant role that the progenitor evolution plays in the observable qualities\nof supernovae and supernova remnants. Through comparisons of these three\ndifferent progenitor evolution scenarios, we find that the mass loss in late\nstages (during and after core carbon burning) can have a profound impact on the\ndynamics and spectral evolution of the supernova remnant centuries after\ncore-collapse.\n", "  We investigate the effects of Fe and Co substitutions on the phase stability\nof the martensitic phase, mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties of\nmagnetic shape memory system Mn$_{2}$NiGa by first-principles Density\nfunctional theory(DFT) calculations. The evolution of these aspects upon\nsubstitution of Fe and Co at different crystallographic sites are investigated\nby computing the electronic structure, mechanical properties and magnetic\nexchange parameters. We find that the martensitic phase of Mn$_{2}$NiGa\ngradually de-stabilises with increase in concentration of Fe/Co due to the\nweakening of the minority spin hybridisation of Ni and Mn atoms occupying\ncrystallographically equivalent sites. The interplay between relative\nstructural stability and the compositional changes are understood from the\nvariations in the elastic modulii and electronic structures. We find that the\nelastic shear modulus C$^{\\prime}$ can be considered as a predictor of\ncomposition dependence of martensitic transformation temperature in substituted\nMn$_{2}$NiGa. The magnetic properties of Mn$_{2}$NiGa are found to be greatly\nimproved by the substitutions due to stronger ferromagnetic interactions in the\ncompounds. The gradually weaker(stronger) Jahn-Teller distortion (covalent\nbonding) in the minority spin densities of states due to substitutions lead to\na half-metallic like gap in these compounds resulting in materials with high\nspin-polarisation when the substitutions are complete. The substitutions at the\nGa site result in two new compounds Mn$_{2}$NiFe and Mn$_{2}$NiCo with very\nhigh magnetic moments and Curie temperatures. Thus, our work indicates that\nalthough the substitutions de-stabilise the martensitic phase in Mn$_{2}$NiGa,\nnew magnetic materials with very good magnetic parameters and potentially\nuseful for novel magnetic applications can be obtained.\n", "  The exchange interaction between magnetic ions and charge carriers in\nsemiconductors is considered as prime tool for spin control. Here, we solve a\nlong-standing problem by uniquely determining the magnitude of the long-range\n$p-d$ exchange interaction in a ferromagnet-semiconductor (FM-SC) hybrid\nstructure where a 10~nm thick CdTe quantum well is separated from the FM Co\nlayer by a CdMgTe barrier with a thickness on the order of 10~nm. The exchange\ninteraction is manifested by the spin splitting of acceptor bound holes in the\neffective magnetic field induced by the FM. The exchange splitting is directly\nevaluated using spin-flip Raman scattering by analyzing the dependence of the\nStokes shift $\\Delta_S$ on the external magnetic field $B$. We show that in\nstrong magnetic field $\\Delta_S$ is a linear function of $B$ with an offset of\n$\\Delta_{pd} = 50-100~\\mu$eV at zero field from the FM induced effective\nexchange field. On the other hand, the $s-d$ exchange interaction between\nconduction band electrons and FM, as well as the $p-d$ contribution for free\nvalence band holes, are negligible. The results are well described by the model\nof indirect exchange interaction between acceptor bound holes in the CdTe\nquantum well and the FM layer mediated by elliptically polarized phonons in the\nhybrid structure.\n", "  Extensions beyond the Standard Model allow for a gauge singlet scalar to be\nkinetically coupled with the Higgs. We consider kinetic mixing between a Dark\nscalar gauge singlet \\emph{nearly degenerate} with the Higgs, focusing on the\n\\emph{dynamical} aspects of the mixing phenomena. The renormalization program\nis carried out by obtaining the one-loop effective action which yields an\neffective non-hermitian Hamiltonian to study the dynamics of mixing. The scalar\nHiggs becomes a coherent superposition of the mass eigenstates, thus kinetic\nmixing leads to oscillations and common decay channels in striking similarity\nwith neutral meson mixing. Near degeneracy yields an \\emph{enhancement} of the\nkinetic coupling. For small kinetic mixing we find that the mass eigenstates\nfeature different lifetimes which result in a wide separation of time scales of\nevolution along with important coherence aspects from Dark scalar-Higgs\ninterference. The wide separation of scales is manifest as displaced decay\nvertices which could potentially be a telltale experimental signal of kinetic\nmixing.\n", "  In previous papers of this series, we presented a formalism able to account\nfor both statistical equilibrium of a multilevel atom and coherent and\nincoherent scatterings (partial redistribution). aims: This paper provides\ntheoretical expressions of the redistribution function for the two-term atom.\nThis redistribution function includes both coherent (R_II) and incoherent\n(R_III) scattering contributions with their branching ratios. methods: The\nexpressions were derived by applying the formalism outlined above. The\nstatistical equilibrium equation for the atomic density matrix is first\nformally solved in the case of the two-term atom with unpolarized and\ninfinitely sharp lower levels. Then the redistribution function is derived by\nsubstituting this solution for the expression of the emissivity. results:\nExpressions are provided for both magnetic and non-magnetic cases. Atomic fine\nstructure is taken into account. Expressions are also separately provided under\nzero and non-zero hyperfine structure. conclusions: Redistribution functions\nare widely used in radiative transfer codes. In our formulation, collisional\ntransitions between Zeeman sublevels within an atomic level (depolarizing\ncollisions effect) are taken into account when possible (i.e., in the\nnon-magnetic case). However, the need for a formal solution of the statistical\nequilibrium as a preliminary step prevents us from taking into account\ncollisional transfers between the levels of the upper term. Accounting for\nthese collisional transfers could be done via a numerical solution of the\nstatistical equilibrium equation system.\n", "  We develop the general theory of spinning particles with electric and\nmagnetic dipole moments moving in arbitrary electromagnetic, inertial and\ngravitational fields. Both the quantum-mechanical and classical dynamics is\ninvestigated. We start from the covariant Dirac equation extended to a\nspin-${\\frac 12}$ fermion with anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments\nand then perform the relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This\ntransformation allows us to obtain the quantum-mechanical equations of motion\nfor the physical operators in the Schr\\\"odinger form and to establish the\nclassical limit of relativistic quantum mechanics. The results obtained are\nthen compared to the general classical description of the spinning particle\ninteracting with electromagnetic, inertial and gravitational fields. The\ncomplete agreement between the quantum mechanics and the classical theory is\nproven in the general case. As an application of the results obtained, we\nconsider the dynamics of a spinning particle in a gravitational wave and\nanalyze the prospects of using the magnetic resonance setup to find possible\nmanifestations of the gravitational wave on spin.\n", "  Many systems in nature and laboratories are far from equilibrium and exhibit\nsignificant fluctuations, invalidating the key assumptions of small\nfluctuations and short memory time in or near equilibrium. A full knowledge of\nProbability Distribution Functions (PDFs), especially time-dependent PDFs,\nbecomes essential in understanding far-from-equilibrium processes. We consider\na stochastic logistic model with multiplicative noise, which has gamma\ndistributions as stationary PDFs. We numerically solve the transient relaxation\nproblem, and show that as the strength of the stochastic noise increases the\ntime-dependent PDFs increasingly deviate from gamma distributions. For\nsufficiently strong noise a transition occurs whereby the PDF never reaches a\nstationary state, but instead forms a peak that becomes ever more narrowly\nconcentrated at the origin. The addition of an arbitrarily small amount of\nadditive noise regularizes these solutions, and re-establishes the existence of\nstationary solutions. In addition to diagnostic quantities such as mean value,\nstandard deviation, skewness and kurtosis, the transitions between different\nsolutions are analyzed in terms of entropy and information length, the total\nnumber of statistically distinguishable states that a system passes through in\ntime.\n", "  The extreme temperatures and non-thermal nature of the solar corona and solar\nwind arise from an unidentified physical mechanism that preferentially heats\ncertain ion species relative to others. Spectroscopic indicators of unequal\ntemperatures commence within a fraction of a solar radius above the surface of\nthe Sun, but the outer reach of this mechanism has yet to be determined. Here\nwe present an empirical procedure for combining interplanetary solar wind\nmeasurements and a modeled energy equation including Coulomb relaxation to\nsolve for the typical outer boundary of this zone of preferential heating.\nApplied to two decades of observations by the Wind spacecraft, our results are\nconsistent with preferential heating being active in a zone extending from the\ntransition region in the lower corona to an outer boundary 20-40 solar radii\nfrom the Sun, producing a steady state super-mass-proportional\n$\\alpha$-to-proton temperature ratio of $5.2-5.3$. Preferential ion heating\ncontinues far beyond the transition region and is important for the evolution\nof both the outer corona and the solar wind. The outer boundary of this zone is\nwell below the orbits of spacecraft at 1 AU and even closer missions such as\nHelios and MESSENGER, meaning it is likely that no existing mission has\ndirectly observed intense preferential heating, just residual signatures. We\npredict that {Parker Solar Probe} will be the first spacecraft with a perihelia\nsufficiently close to the Sun to pass through the outer boundary, enter the\nzone of preferential heating, and directly observe the physical mechanism in\naction.\n", "  Periodically driven (Floquet) systems have been under active theoretical and\nexperimental investigations. This paper aims at a systematic study in the\nfollowing aspects of Floquet systems: (i) A systematic formulation of\ntopological invariants of Floquet systems based on the cooperation of topology\nand symmetries. Topological invariants are constructed for the ten symmetry\nclasses in all spatial dimensions, for both homogeneous Floquet systems\n(Floquet topological insulators and superconductors) and Floquet topological\ndefects. Meanwhile, useful representative Dirac Hamiltonians for all the\nsymmetry classes are obtained and studied. (ii) A general theory of Floquet\ntopological defects, based on the proposed topological invariants. (iii) Models\nand proposals of Floquet topological defects in low dimensions. Among other\ndefect modes, we investigate Floquet Majorana zero modes and Majorana Pi modes\nin vortices of topologically trivial superconductors under a periodic drive. In\naddition, we clarified several notable issues about Floquet topological\ninvariants. Among other issues, we prove the equivalence between the\neffective-Hamiltonian-based band topological invariants and the\nfrequency-domain band topological invariants.\n", "  Context: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are anisotropic objects surrounded by\nan optically thick equatorial medium whose true geometry still defy observers.\nAims: In this paper, we aim to explore the optical, scattering-induced,\npolarization emerging from clumpy and warped dusty tori to check whether they\ncan fit with the unified model predictions. Methods: We run polarized radiative\ntransfer simulations in a set of warped and non warped clumpy tori to explore\nthe differences induced by distorted dust distributions. We then include warped\ntori in a more complex model representative of an AGN to check, using\npolarimetry and imaging methods, if warps can reproduce the expected\npolarization dichotomy between Seyfert-1 and Seyfert-2 AGN. Results: The main\nresults from our simulations highlight that isolated warped structures imprint\nthe polarization degree and angle with distinctive signatures at Seyfert-1\norientations. Included in an AGN model, the signatures of warps are easily (but\nnot always) washed out by multiple scattering in a clumpy environment. Imaging\npolarimetry may help to detect warped tori but we prove that warps can exist in\nAGN circumnuclear regions without contradicting observations. Conclusions: Two\nwarped tori with a non significant difference in geometry in terms of\nphotometry or spectroscopy can have totally different signatures in\npolarimetry. Testing the geometry of any alternative model to the usual dusty\ntorus using polarized radiative transfer is a necessary approach to verify or\nreject a hypothesis.\n", "  We study the decoherence dynamics of dipole-coupled two-level quantum systems\nin Ramsey-type experiments. We focus on large networks of two-level systems,\nconfined to two spatial dimensions and with positional disorder giving rise to\ndisordered dipolar couplings. This setting is relevant for modeling the\ndecoherence dynamics of the rotational excitations of polar molecules confined\nto deep optical lattices, where disorder arises from the random filling of\nlattice sites with occupation probability $p$. We show that the decoherence\ndynamics exhibits a phase transition at a critical filling $p_c\\simeq 0.15$.\nFor $p<p_c$ the dynamics is disorder-dominated and the Ramsey interference\nsignal decays on a timescale $T_2 \\propto p^{-3/2}$. For $p>p_c$ the dipolar\ninteractions dominate the disorder, and the system behaves as a collective\nspin-ordered phase, representing synchronization of the two-level systems and\npersistent Ramsey oscillations with divergent $T_2$ for large systems. For a\nfinite number of two-level systems, $N$, the spin-ordered phase at $p> p_c$\nundergoes a crossover to a collective spin-squeezed state on a timescale\n$\\tau_{\\rm sq} \\propto \\sqrt{N}$. We develop a self-consistent mean-field\ntheory that is capable of capturing the synchronization transition at $p_c$,\nand provide an intuitive theoretical picture that describes the phase\ntransition in the long-time dynamics. We also show that the decoherence\ndynamics appear to be ergodic in the vicinity of $p_c$, the long-time behaviour\nbeing well described by the predictions of equilibrium thermodynamics. The\nresults are supported by the results of exact diagonalization studies of small\nsystems.\n", "  In this article we describe the incoherent and coherent spin and charge\ndynamics of a single electron quantum dot. We use a stochastic master equation\nto model the state of the system, as inferred by an observer with access to\nonly the measurement signal. Measurements obtained during an interval of time\ncontribute, by a past quantum state analysis, to our knowledge about the system\nat any time $t$ within that interval. Such analysis permits precise estimation\nof physical parameters, and we propose and test a modification of the classical\nBaum-Welch parameter re-estimation method to systems driven by both coherent\nand incoherent processes.\n", "  Thin film synthesis methods developed over the past decades have unlocked\nemergent interface properties ranging from conductivity to ferroelectricity.\nHowever, our attempts to exercise precise control over interfaces are\nconstrained by a limited understanding of growth pathways and kinetics. Here we\ndemonstrate that shuttered molecular beam epitaxy induces rearrangements of\natomic planes at a polar / non-polar junction of LaFeO$_3$ (LFO) /\n$n$-SrTiO$_3$ (STO) depending on the substrate termination. Surface\ncharacterization confirms that substrates with two different (TiO$_2$ and SrO)\nterminations were prepared prior to LFO deposition; however, local electron\nenergy loss spectroscopy measurements of the final heterojunctions show a\npredominantly LaO / TiO$_2$ interfacial junction in both cases. Ab initio\nsimulations suggest that the interfaces can be stabilized by trapping extra\noxygen (in LaO / TiO$_2$) and forming oxygen vacancies (in FeO$_2$ / SrO),\nwhich points to different growth kinetics in each case and may explain the\napparent disappearance of the FeO$_2$ / SrO interface. We conclude that\njudicious control of deposition timescales can be used to modify growth\npathways, opening new avenues to control the structure and properties of\ninterfacial systems.\n", "  We reexamine the relationship between the path integral and canonical\nformulation of quantum general relativity. In particular, we present a formal\nderivation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation from the path integral for quantum\ngeneral relativity by way of boundary variations. One feature of this approach\nis that it does not require an explicit 3+1 splitting of spacetime in the bulk.\nFor spacetimes with a spatial boundary, we show that the dependence of the\ntransition amplitudes on spatial boundary conditions is determined by a\nWheeler-DeWitt equation for the spatial boundary surface. We find that\nvariations in the induced metric at the spatial boundary can be used to\ndescribe time evolution---time evolution in quantum general relativity is\ntherefore governed by boundary conditions on the gravitational field at the\nspatial boundary. We then briefly describe a formalism for computing the\ndependence of transition amplitudes on spatial boundary conditions. Finally, we\nargue that for nonsmooth boundaries, meaningful transition amplitudes must\ndepend on boundary conditions at the joint surfaces.\n", "  With decreasing temperature Sr$_2$VO$_4$ undergoes two structural phase\ntransitions, tetragonal-to-orthorhombic-to-tetragonal, without long-range\nmagnetic order. Recent experiments suggest, that only at very low temperature\nSr$_{2}$VO$_{4}$ might enter some, yet unknown, phase with long-range magnetic\norder, but without orthorhombic distortion. By combining relativistic density\nfunctional theory with an extended spin-1/2 compass-Heisenberg model we find an\nantiferromagnetic single-stripe ground state with highly competing exchange\ninteractions, involving a non negligible inter-layer coupling, which places the\nsystem at the crossover between between the XY and Heisenberg picture. Most\nstrikingly, we find a strong two-site \"spin-compass\" exchange anisotropy which\nis relieved by the orthorhombic distortion induced by the spin stripe order.\nBased on these results we discuss the origin of the hidden order phase and the\npossible formation of a spin-liquid at low temperatures.\n", "  Measurements of $\\sigma_8$ from large scale structure observations show a\ndiscordance with the extrapolated $\\sigma_8$ from Planck CMB parameters using\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Similar discordance is found in the value of $H_0$ and\n$\\Omega_m$. In this paper, we show that the presence of viscosity in cold dark\nmatter, shear or bulk or combination of both, can remove the above mentioned\nconflicts simultaneously. This indicates that the data from Planck CMB\nobservation and different LSS observations prefer small but non-zero amount of\nviscosity in cold dark matter fluid.\n", "  Conformal and Disformal couplings between a scalar field and matter occur\nnaturally in general scalar-tensor theories. In D-brane models of cosmology and\nparticle physics, these couplings originate from the D-brane action describing\nthe dynamics of its transverse (the scalar) and longitudinal (matter)\nfluctuations, which are thus coupled. During the post-inflationary regime and\nbefore the onset of big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), these couplings can modify\nthe expansion rate felt by matter, changing the predictions for the thermal\nrelic abundance of dark matter particles and thus the annihilation rate\nrequired to satisfy the dark matter content today. We study the D-brane-like\nconformal and disformal couplings effect on the expansion rate of the universe\nprior to BBN and its impact on the dark matter relic abundance and annihilation\nrate. For a purely disformal coupling, the expansion rate is always enhanced\nwith respect to the standard one. This gives rise to larger cross-sections when\ncompared to the standard thermal prediction for a range of dark matter masses,\nwhich will be probed by future experiments. In a D-brane-like scenario, the\nscale at which the expansion rate enhancement occurs depends on the string\ncoupling and the string scale.\n", "  This work focuses on the analysis of the Casimir effect for pistons subject\nto transmittal boundary conditions. In particular we consider, as piston\nconfiguration, a direct product manifold of the type $I\\times N$ where $I$ is a\nclosed interval of the real line and $N$ is a smooth compact Riemannian\nmanifold. By utilizing the spectral zeta function regularization technique, we\ncompute the Casimir energy of the system and the Casimir force acting on the\npiston. Explicit results for the force are provided when the manifold $N$ is a\n$d$-dimensional ball.\n", "  Microscopic heat engines are microscale systems that convert energy flows\nbetween heat reservoirs into work or systematic motion. We have experimentally\nrealized a minimal microscopic heat engine. It consists of a colloidal Brownian\nparticle optically trapped in an elliptical potential well and simultaneously\ncoupled to two heat baths at different temperatures acting along perpendicular\ndirections. For a generic arrangement of the principal directions of the baths\nand the potential, the symmetry of the system is broken, such that the heat\nflow drives a systematic gyrating motion of the particle around the potential\nminimum. Using the experimentally measured trajectories, we quantify the\ngyrating motion of the particle, the resulting torque that it exerts on the\npotential, and the associated heat flow between the heat baths. We find\nexcellent agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical\npredictions.\n", "  Recently the question of phonon angular momentum has been raised : phonon\nangular momentum in a magnetic crystal could play an important role in the\nangular momentum balance in the Einstein-de Haas effect. This proposition is\nquite natural and understandable, however the idea of phonon spin seems\nambiguous in the literature. In 1988 McLellan presented phonon angular momentum\nstates for circular and elliptical polarizations of phonons that represent\norbital angular momentum and also pointed out analogy to isotropic quantum\nharmonic oscillator. In view of its fundamental importance we investigate this\nissue and conclude that phonon spin hypothesis is physically untenable, and the\nphonon angular momentum has to be interpreted as orbital. The photon-phonon\nanalogy is also misleading. It is argued that Cosserat elastic medium having\ninternal torque may have lattice excitations different from phonons having spin\none or spin two that we term as Cosseratons. In addition a new source of\nangular momentum balance originationg from anomalous electron magnetic moment\nis suggested.\n", "  To understand globular clusters (GCs) we need to comprehend how their\nformation process was able to produce their abundance distribution of light\nelements. In particular, we seek to figure out which stars imprinted the\npeculiar chemical signature of GCs. One of the best ways is to study the\nlight-element anti-correlations in a large sample of GCs that are analysed\nhomogeneously. As part of our spectroscopic survey of GCs with FLAMES, we\npresent here the results of our study of about 30 red giant member stars in the\nlow-mass, low-metallicity Milky Way cluster NGC 6535. We measured the\nmetallicity (finding [Fe/H]=-1.95, rms=0.04 dex in our homogeneous scale) and\nother elements of the cluster and, in particular, we concentrate here on O and\nNa abundances. These elements define the normal Na-O anti-correlation of\nclassical GCs, making NGC 6535 perhaps the lowest mass cluster with a confirmed\npresence of multiple populations. We updated the census of Galactic and\nextragalactic GCs for which a statement on the presence or absence of multiple\npopulations can be made on the basis of high-resolution spectroscopy\npreferentially, or photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy otherwise; we\nalso discuss the importance of mass and age of the clusters as factors for\nmultiple populations.\n", "  We explore the phenomenon of the recently discovered inverse transfer of\nenergy from small to large scales in decaying magnetohydrodynamical turbulence\nby Brandenburg et al. (2015) even for nonhelical magnetic fields. For this\ninvestigation we mainly employ the Pencil-Code performing a parameter study,\nwhere we vary the Prandtl number, the kinematic viscosity and the initial\nspectrum. We find that in order to get a decay which exhibits this inverse\ntransfer, large Reynolds numbers ($\\mathcal{O}\\sim 10^{3}$) are needed and low\nPrandtl numbers of the order unity $Pr = 1$ are preferred. Compared to helical\nMHD turbulence, though, the inverse transfer is much less efficient in\ntransferring magnetic energy to larger scales than the well-known effect of the\ninverse cascade. Hence, applying the inverse transfer to the magnetic field\nevolution in the Early Universe, we question whether the nonhelical inverse\ntransfer is effective enough to explain the observed void magnetic fields if a\nmagneto- genesis scenario during the electroweak phase transition is assumed.\n", "  We revisit double neutron star (DNS) formation in the classical binary\nevolution scenario in light of the recent LIGO/Virgo DNS detection (GW170817).\nThe observationally estimated Galactic DNS merger rate of $R_{\\rm\nMW}=21^{+28}_{-14}$ Myr$^{-1}$, based on 3 Galactic DNS systems, fully supports\nour standard input physics model with $R_{\\rm MW} =24$ Myr$^{-1}$. This\nestimate for the Galaxy translates in a non-trivial way (due to cosmological\nevolution of progenitor stars in chemically evolving Universe) into a local\n($z\\approx0$) DNS merger rate density of $R_{\\rm local}=48$\nGpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which {\\em is not} consistent with the current LIGO/Virgo\nDNS merger rate estimate ($1540^{+3200}_{-1220}$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$). Within\nour study of the parameter space we find solutions that allow for DNS merger\nrates as high as $R_{\\rm local} \\approx 600^{+600}_{-300}$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$\nwhich are thus consistent with the LIGO/Virgo estimate. However, our\ncorresponding BH-BH merger rates for the models with high DNS merger rates\nexceed the current LIGO/Virgo estimate of local BH-BH merger rate ($12$-$213$\nGpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$). Apart from being particularly sensitive to the common\nenvelope treatment, DNS merger rates are rather robust against variations of\nseveral of the key factors probed in our study (e.g. mass transfer, angular\nmomentum loss, natal kicks). This might suggest that either common envelope\ndevelopment/survival works differently for DNS ($\\sim$ 10-20 Msun stars) than\nfor BH-BH ($\\sim$ 40-100 Msun stars) progenitors, or high BH natal kicks are\nneeded to meet observational constraints for both types of binaries. Note that\nour conclusion is based on a limited number of (21) evolutionary models and is\nvalid only within this particular DNS and BH-BH isolated binary formation\nscenario.\n", "  A simple DNA-based data storage scheme is demonstrated in which information\nis written using \"addressing\" oligonucleotides. In contrast to other methods\nthat allow arbitrary code to be stored, the resulting DNA is suitable for\ndownstream enzymatic and biological processing. This capability is crucial for\nDNA computers, and may allow for a diverse array of computational operations to\nbe carried out using this DNA. Although here we use gel-based methods for\ninformation readout, we also propose more advanced methods involving\nprotein/DNA complexes and atomic force microscopy/nano-pore schemes for data\nreadout.\n", "  Non-Holomorphic MSSM (NHSSM) shows various promising features that are not\neasily obtained in MSSM. However, the additional Non-Holomorphic (NH) trilinear\ninteractions that attribute to the interesting phenomenological features, also\nmodify the effective scalar potential of the model significantly. We derive\nanalytic constraints involving trilinear parameters $A_t'$ and $A_b'$ that\nexclude global charge and color breaking minima (CCB). Since the analytic\nconstraints are obtained considering specific directions in the\nmulti-dimensional field space, we further probe the applicability of these\nconstraints by exhaustive scan over NH parameter space with two different\nregimes of $\\tan\\beta$ and delineate the nature of metastability by considering\nvacuum expectation values for third generation squarks. We adhere to a natural\nscenario by fixing Higgsino mass parameter ($\\mu$) to a low value and estimate\nthe allowed ranges of NH trilinear parameters by considering vacuum stability\nand observed properties of Higgs as the determining criteria.\n", "  We investigate the modes of oscillation of heterogeneous ring-networks of\nquadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with non-local, space-dependent coupling.\nPerturbations of the equilibrium state with a particular wave number produce\ntransient standing waves with a specific frequency, analogous to those in a\ntense string. In the neuronal network, the equilibrium corresponds to a\nspatially homogeneous, asynchronous state. Perturbations of this state excite\nthe network's oscillatory modes, which reflect the interplay of episodes of\nsynchronous spiking with the excitatory-inhibitory spatial interactions. In the\nthermodynamic limit, an exact low-dimensional neural field model describing the\nmacroscopic dynamics of the network is derived. This allows us to obtain\nformulas for the Turing eigenvalues of the spatially-homogeneous state, and\nhence to obtain its stability boundary. We find that the frequency of each\nTuring mode depends on the corresponding Fourier coefficient of the synaptic\npattern of connectivity. The decay rate instead, is identical for all\noscillation modes as a consequence of the heterogeneity-induced\ndesynchronization of the neurons. Finally, we numerically compute the spectrum\nof spatially-inhomogeneous solutions branching from the Turing bifurcation,\nshowing that similar oscillatory modes operate in neural bump states, and are\nmaintained away from onset.\n", "  We propose that the properties of the capacity of entanglement (COE) in\ngapless systems can efficiently be investigated through the use of the\ndistribution of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix (RDM). The COE is\ndefined as the fictitious heat capacity calculated from the entanglement\nspectrum. Its dependence on the fictitious temperature can reflect the\nlow-temperature behavior of the physical heat capacity, and thus provide a\nuseful probe of gapless bulk or edge excitations of the system. Assuming a\npower-law scaling of the COE with an exponent $\\alpha$ at low fictitious\ntemperatures, we derive an analytical formula for the distribution function of\nthe RDM eigenvalues. We numerically test the effectiveness of the formula in\nrelativistic free scalar boson in two spatial dimensions, and find that the\ndistribution function can detect the expected $\\alpha=3$ scaling of the COE\nmuch more efficiently than the raw data of the COE. We also calculate the\ndistribution function in the ground state of the half-filled Landau level with\nshort-range interactions, and find a better agreement with the $\\alpha=2/3$\nformula than with the $\\alpha=1$ one, which indicates a non-Fermi-liquid nature\nof the system.\n", "  Pump-probe electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) with femtosecond temporal\nresolution will be a transformative research tool for studying non-equilibrium\nchemistry and electronic dynamics of matter. In this paper, we propose a new\nconcept of femtosecond EELS utilizing mega-electron-volt electron beams from a\nradio-frequency (rf) photocathode source. The high acceleration gradient and\nhigh beam energy of the rf gun are critical to the generation of 10-femtosecond\nelectron beams, which enables improvement of the temporal resolution by more\nthan one order of magnitude beyond the state of the art. The major innovation\nin our proposal - the `reference-beam technique', relaxes the energy stability\nrequirement on the rf power source by roughly two orders of magnitude.\nRequirements on the electron beam quality, photocathode, spectrometer and\ndetector are also discussed. Supported by particle-tracking simulations, we\ndemonstrate the feasibility of achieving sub-electron-volt energy resolution\nand ~10-femtosecond temporal resolution with existing or near-future hardware\nperformances.\n", "  Charge transport is crucial to the performance of hybrid halide perovskite\nsolar cells. A theoretical model based on large polarons is proposed to\nelucidate charge transport properties in the perovskites. Critical new physical\ninsights are incorporated into the model, including the recognitions that\nacoustic phonons as opposed to optical phonons are responsible for the\nscattering of the polarons; these acoustic phonons are fully excited due to the\n\"softness\" of the perovskites, and the temperature-dependent dielectric\nfunction underlies the temperature dependence of charge carrier mobility. This\nwork resolves key controversies in literature and forms a starting point for\nmore rigorous first-principles predictions of charge transport.\n", "  Polyethylene and copper samples were exposed to the underground air at SNOLAB\nfor approximately three months while several environmental factors were\nmonitored. Predictions of the radon-daughter plate-out rate are compared to the\nresulting surface activities, obtained from high-sensitivity measurements of\nalpha emissivity using the XIA UltraLo-1800 spectrometer at SMU. From these\nmeasurements, we determine an average $^{210}$Pb plate-out rate of 249 and 423\natoms/day/cm$^{2}$ for polyethylene and copper, respectively, when exposed to\nradon activity of 135 Bq/m$^{3}$ at SNOLAB. A time-dependent model of alpha\nactivity is discussed for these materials placed in similar environmental\nconditions.\n", "  We present finite temperature Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov (FTDHB) calculations\nfor the tin isotope chain to study the dependence of pseudospin on the nuclear\ntemperature. In the FTDHB calculation, the density dependence of the\nself-consistent relativistic mean fields, the pairing, and the vapor phase that\ntakes into account the unbound nucleon states are considered self-consistently.\nThe mean field potentials obtained in the FTDHB calculations are fit by\nWoods-Saxon (WS) potentials to examine how the WS parameters are related to the\nenergy splitting of the pseudospin pairs as the temperature increases. We find\nthat the nuclear potential surface diffuseness is the main driver for the\npseudospin splittings and that it increases as the temperature grows. We\nconclude that pseudospin symmetry is better realized when the nuclear\ntemperature increases. The results confirm the findings of previous works using\nRMF theory at $T=0$, namely that the correlation between the pseudospin\nsplitting and the parameters of the Woods-Saxon potentials implies that\npseudospin symmetry is a dynamical symmetry in nuclei. We show that the\ndynamical nature of the pseudospin symmetry remains when the temperature is\nconsidered in a realistic calculation of the tin isotopes, such as that of the\nDirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov formalism.\n", "  Using the kinematically unbiased technique described in Binks, Jeffries &\nMaxted (2015), we present optical spectra for a further 122 rapidly-rotating\n(rotation periods < 6 days), X-ray active FGK stars, selected from the\nSuperWASP survey. We identify 17 new examples of young, probably single stars\nwith ages of < 200 Myr and provide additional evidence for a new northern\nhemisphere kinematic association: the Pisces Moving Group (MG). The group\nconsists of 14 lithium-rich G- and K-type stars, that have a dispersion of only\n$\\sim $3 kms$^{-1}$ in each Galactic space velocity coordinate. The group\nmembers are approximately co-eval in the colour-magnitude diagram, with an age\nof 30-50 Myr, and have similar, though not identical, kinematics to the\nOctans-Near MG.\n", "  Recently, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides,\nnamely, MXenes have attracted lots of attention for electronic and energy\nstorage applications. Due to a large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the\nexistence of a Dirac-like band at the Fermi energy, it has been theoretically\nproposed that some of the MXenes will be topological insulators (TIs). Up to\nnow, all of the predicted TI MXenes belong to transition metal carbides, whose\ntransition metal atom is W, Mo or Cr. Here, on the basis of first-principles\nand Z2 index calculations, we demonstrate that some of the MXene nitrides can\nalso be TIs. We find that Ti3N2F2 is a 2D TI, whereas Zr3N2F2 is a semimetal\nwith nontrivial band topology and can be turned into a 2D TI when the lattice\nis stretched. We also find that the tensile strain can convert Hf3N2F2\nsemiconductor into a 2D TI. Since Ti is one of the mostly used transition metal\nelement in the synthesized MXenes, we expect that our prediction can advance\nthe future application of MXenes as TI devices.\n", "  Here, the dispersion of edge surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes is\nexpressed in terms of the elements of the conductivity tensor.\n", "  When one tries to take into account the non-trivial vacuum structure of\nQuantum Field Theory, the standard functional-integral tools such as generating\nfunctionals or transitional amplitudes, are often quite inadequate for such\npurposes. Here we propose a generalized generating functional for Green's\nfunctions which allows to easily distinguish among a continuous set of vacua\nthat are mutually connected via unitary canonical transformations. In order to\nkeep our discussion as simple as possible, we limit ourselves to Quantum\nMechanics where the generating functional of Green's functions is constructed\nby means of phase-space path integrals. The quantum-mechanical setting allows\nto accentuate the main logical steps involved without embarking on technical\ncomplications such as renormalization or inequivalent representations that\nshould otherwise be addressed in the full-fledged Quantum Field Theory. We\nillustrate the inner workings of the generating functional obtained by\ndiscussing Green's functions among vacua that are mutually connected via\ntranslations and dilatations. Salient issues, including connection with Quantum\nField Theory, vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitudes and perturbation expansion\nin the vacuum parameter are also briefly discussed.\n", "  Searching for two-dimensional (2D) organic Dirac materials, which have more\nadaptable practical applications in comparing with inorganic ones, is of great\nsignificance and has been ongoing. However, only two kinds of these materials\nwith low Fermi velocity have been discovered so far. Herein, we report the\ndesign of an organic monolayer with C$_4$N$_3$H stoichiometry which possesses\nfascinating structure and good stability in its free-standing state. More\nimportantly, we demonstrate that this monolayer is a semimetal with anisotropic\nDirac cones and very high Fermi velocity. This Fermi velocity is roughly one\norder of magnitude larger than that in 2D organic Dirac materials ever\nreported, and is comparable to that in graphene. The Dirac states in this\nmonolayer arise from the extended $\\pi$-electron conjugation system formed by\nthe overlapping 2\\emph{p}$_z$ orbitals of carbon and nitrogen atoms. Our\nfinding opens a door for searching more 2D organic Dirac materials with high\nFermi velocity.\n", "  Multiwavelength monitoring of Be/X-ray binaries is crucial to understand the\nmechanisms producing their outbursts. H 1145-619 is one of these systems, which\nhas recently displayed X-ray activity. We investigate the correlation between\nthe optical emission and the X-ray activity to predict the occurrence of new\nX-ray outbursts from the inferred state of the circumstellar disc. We have\nperformed a multiwavelength study of H 1145-619 from 1973 to 2017 and present\nhere a global analysis of its variability over the last 40 years. We have used\noptical spectra from the SAAO, SMARTS and SALT telescopes and optical\nphotometry from INTEGRAL/OMC and ASAS. We also used X-ray observations from\nINTEGRAL/JEM-X, and IBIS to generate the light curves and combined them with\nSwift/XRT to extract the X-ray spectra. In addition, we have compiled archival\nobservations and measurements from the literature to complement these data.\nComparing the evolution of the optical continuum emission with the Halpha line\nvariability, we have identified three different patterns of optical\nvariability: Global increases and decreases of the optical brightness (observed\nfrom 1982 to 1994 and from 2009 to 2017) that can be explained by the\ndissipation and replenishment of the circumstellar disc, superorbital\nvariations with a period of Psuperorb~590 days (observed in 2002-2009) which\nseems to be related with the circumstellar disc, and optical outbursts\n(observed in 1998-1999 and 2002-2005) that we interpret as mass ejections. We\nhave discovered the presence of a retrograde one-armed density wave, which\nappeared in 2016 and is still present in the circumstellar disc. We have\ncarried out the most complete long-term optical study of the Be/X-ray binary H\n1145-619 in correlation with its X-ray activity. We found for the fist time the\npresence of a retrograde density perturbation in the circumstellar disc of a\nBe/X-ray binary.\n", "  We present the experimental and numerical studies of a 2D sheared amorphous\nmaterial constituted of bidisperse photo-elastic disks. We analyze the\nstatistics of avalanches during shear including the local and global\nfluctuations in energy and changes in particle positions and orientations. We\nfind scale free distributions for these global and local avalanches denoted by\npower-laws whose cut-offs vary with inter-particle friction and packing\nfraction. Different exponents are found for these power-laws depending on the\nquantity from which variations are extracted. An asymmetry in time of the\navalanche shapes is evidenced along with the fact that avalanches are mainly\ntriggered from the shear bands. A simple relation independent from the\nintensity, is found between the number of local avalanches and the global\navalanches they form. We also compare these experimental and numerical results\nfor both local and global fluctuations to predictions from meanfield and\ndepinning theories.\n", "  Aims. We describe the design and first light observations from the $\\beta$\nPictoris b Ring (\"bRing\") project. The primary goal is to detect photometric\nvariability from the young star $\\beta$ Pictoris due to circumplanetary\nmaterial surrounding the directly imaged young extrasolar gas giant planet\n\\bpb. Methods. Over a nine month period centred on September 2017, the Hill\nsphere of the planet will cross in front of the star, providing a unique\nopportunity to directly probe the circumplanetary environment of a directly\nimaged planet through photometric and spectroscopic variations. We have built\nand installed the first of two bRing monitoring stations (one in South Africa\nand the other in Australia) that will measure the flux of $\\beta$ Pictoris,\nwith a photometric precision of $0.5\\%$ over 5 minutes. Each station uses two\nwide field cameras to cover the declination of the star at all elevations.\nDetection of photometric fluctuations will trigger spectroscopic observations\nwith large aperture telescopes in order to determine the gas and dust\ncomposition in a system at the end of the planet-forming era. Results. The\nfirst three months of operation demonstrate that bRing can obtain better than\n0.5\\% photometry on $\\beta$ Pictoris in five minutes and is sensitive to\nnightly trends enabling the detection of any transiting material within the\nHill sphere of the exoplanet.\n", "  We present the Herschel Bright Sources (HerBS) sample, a sample of bright,\nhigh-redshift Herschel sources detected in the 616.4 square degree H-ATLAS\nsurvey. The HerBS sample contains 209 galaxies, selected with a 500 {\\mu}m flux\ndensity greater than 80 mJy and an estimated redshift greater than 2. The\nsample consists of a combination of HyLIRGs and lensed ULIRGs during the epoch\nof peak cosmic star formation. In this paper, we present SCUBA-2 observations\nat 850 ${\\mu}$m of 189 galaxies of the HerBS sample, 152 of these sources were\ndetected. We fit a spectral template to the Herschel-SPIRE and 850 ${\\mu}$m\nSCUBA-2 flux densities of 22 sources with spectroscopically determined\nredshifts, using a two-component modified blackbody spectrum as a template. We\nfind a cold- and hot-dust temperature of 21.29 K and 45.80 K, a cold-to-hot\ndust mass ratio of 26.62 and a $\\beta$ of 1.83. The poor quality of the fit\nsuggests that the sample of galaxies is too diverse to be explained by our\nsimple model. Comparison of our sample to a galaxy evolution model indicates\nthat the fraction of lenses is high. Out of the 152 SCUBA-2 detected galaxies,\nthe model predicts 128.4 $\\pm$ 2.1 of those galaxies to be lensed (84.5%). The\nSPIRE 500 ${\\mu}$m flux suggests that out of all 209 HerBS sources, we expect\n158.1 $\\pm$ 1.7 lensed sources, giving a total lensing fraction of 76 per cent.\n", "  A handful of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have shown strong spectral\nvariations in the optical band between epochs that are years apart. The\nappearance or disappearance of broad emission lines in their spectra completely\nchanges their classification. Since their nucleus orientation cannot change in\nsuch short timescales another physical interpretation has to be found. Several\nscenarios are competing to explain their changing-look nature and, for the\nfirst time, we conduct polarized radiative transfer Monte Carlo simulations for\nall the models. We demonstrate that all interpretations have distinctive\nfeatures in both total optical flux and continuum polarization such as proposed\nby Hutsem\\'ekers and collaborators. Distinguishing between the different\nscenarios is thus straightforward. We apply our results on the changing-look\nquasar J1011+5442 and confirm the conclusions found by Hutsem\\'ekers and\ncollaborators: in this specific case, the disappearance of the broad emission\nlines is due to a change in accretion rate.\n", "  It is shown that the redshift between two Cauchy surfaces in a globally\nhyperbolic spacetime equals the ratio of the associated contact forms on the\nspace of light rays of that spacetime.\n", "  Inferring the directionality of interactions between cellular processes is a\nmajor challenge in systems biology. Time-lagged correlations allow to\ndiscriminate between alternative models, but they still rely on assumed\nunderlying interactions. Here, we use the transfer entropy (TE), an\ninformation-theoretic quantity that quantifies the directional influence\nbetween fluctuating variables in a model-free way. We present a theoretical\napproach to compute the transfer entropy, even when the noise has an extrinsic\ncomponent or in the presence of feedback. We re-analyze the experimental data\nfrom Kiviet et al. (2014) where fluctuations in gene expression of metabolic\nenzymes and growth rate have been measured in single cells of E. coli. We\nconfirm the formerly detected modes between growth and gene expression, while\nprescribing more stringent conditions on the structure of noise sources. We\nfurthermore point out practical requirements in terms of length of time series\nand sampling time which must be satisfied in order to infer optimally transfer\nentropy from times series of fluctuations.\n", "  The generalized thimble method to treat field theories with sign problems\nrequires repeatedly solving the computationally-expensive holomorphic flow\nequations. We present a machine learning technique to bypass this problem. The\ncentral idea is to obtain a few field configurations via the flow equations to\ntrain a feed-forward neural network. The trained network defines a new manifold\nof integration which reduces the sign problem and can be rapidly sampled. We\npresent results for the $1+1$ dimensional Thirring model with Wilson fermions\non sizable lattices. In addition to the gain in speed, the parameterization of\nthe integration manifold we use avoids the \"trapping\" of Monte Carlo chains\nwhich plagues large-flow calculations, a considerable shortcoming of the\nprevious attempts.\n", "  Using the Belle data on the decay $\\Upsilon(10860)\\to\n\\Upsilon(1S)f_0(980)\\to\\Upsilon(1S)\\pi^+\\pi^-$, we estimate the fraction of the\nprocess $\\Upsilon(10860)\\to\\Upsilon(1S)f_0(980)\\to \\Upsilon(1S)\\eta\\pi^0$,\ncaused by the mixing of $a^0_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ resonances that breaks the\nisotopic invariance due to the $K^+$ and $K^0$ meson mass difference. With an\ninstantaneous luminosity of $8\\times10^{35}$ cm$^2\\cdot$\\,s$^{-1}$ at the\nSuperKEKB collider, one can collect with the Belle II detector about a hundred\n$\\Upsilon(10860)\\to\\Upsilon(1S)\\eta\\pi^0$ events in the narrow region of the\n$\\eta\\pi^0$ invariant mass near the $K\\bar K$ thresholds in a time roughly\nspent on the present Belle experiment.\n", "  We present the results of photometric and spectroscopic follow-ups of the\nlowest mass member candidates in the nearest OB association, Upper Scorpius\n(5-10 Myr; 145+/-17 pc), with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC) and\nEuropean Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT). We confirm the\nmembership of the large majority (>80%) of the candidates selected originally\nphotometrically and astrometrically based on their spectroscopic features, weak\nequivalent widths of gravity-sensitive doublets, and radial velocities.\nConfirmed members follow a sequence over a wide magnitude range (J=17.0-19.3\nmag) in several colour-magnitude diagrams with optical, near-, and mid-infrared\nphotometry, and have near-infrared spectral types in the L1-L7 interval with\nlikely masses below 15 Jupiter masses. We find that optical spectral types tend\nto be earlier than near-infrared spectral types by a few subclasses for\nspectral types later than M9. We investigate the behaviour of spectral indices\ndefined in the literature as a function of spectral type and gravity by\ncomparison with values reported in the literature for young and old dwarfs. We\nalso derive effective temperatures in the 1900-1600K from fits of synthetic\nmodel-atmosphere spectra to the observed photometry but we caution the\nprocedure carries large uncertainties. We determine bolometric corrections for\nyoung L dwarfs with ages of ~5-10 Myr (Upper Sco association) and find them\nsimilar in the J-band but larger by 0.1-0.4 mag in the K-band with respect to\nfield L dwarfs. Finally, we discovered two faint young L dwarfs,\nVISTAJ1607-2146 (L4.5) and VISTAJ1611-2215 (L5) that have H$\\alpha$ emission\nand possible flux excesses at 4.5 microns, pointing towards the presence of\naccretion from a disk onto the central objects of mass below ~15 Jupiter masses\nat the age of 5-10 Myr.\n", "  We numerically demonstrate a novel monolayer graphene-based perfect\nabsorption multi-layer photonic structure by the mechanism of critical coupling\nwith guided resonance, in which the absorption of graphene can significantly\nclose to 99% at telecommunication wavelengths. The highly efficient absorption\nand spectral selectivity can be obtained with designing structural parameters\nin the near infrared ranges. Compared to previous works, we achieve the\ncomplete absorption of single-atomic-layer graphene in the perfect absorber for\nthe first time, which not only opens up new methods of enhancing the\nlight-graphene interaction, but also makes for practical applications in\nhigh-performance optoelectronic devices, such as modulators and sensors.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of spin-velocity injection (SVI) of a pure\nspin current (PSC) induced by a linearly polarized light that impinges normally\non the surface of two 50\\% hydrogenated noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional (2D)\ngraphene structures. The first structure, hydrogenated at only one side,\nlabeled Up, also known as graphone, and the second, labelled Alt, is 25\\%\nhydrogenated at both sides. The hydrogenation opens an energy gap in both\nstructures. We analyze two possibilities: in the first, the spin is fixed along\na chosen direction, and the resulting SVI is calculated; in the second, we\nchoose the SVI direction along the surface plane, and calculate the resulting\nspin orientation. This is done by changing the energy $\\hbar\\omega$ and\npolarization angle $\\alpha$ of the incoming light. The results are calculated\nwithin a full electronic band structure scheme using the Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) in the Local Density Approximation (LDA). The maxima of the\nspin-velocities are reached when $\\hbar\\omega=0.084$\\,eV and $\\alpha=35^\\circ$\nfor the Up structure, and $\\hbar\\omega=0.720$\\,eV and $\\alpha=150^\\circ$ for\nthe Alt geometry. We find a speed of 668\\,Km/s and 645\\,Km/s for the Up and the\nAlt structures, respectively, when the spin points perpendicularly to the\nsurface. Also, the response is maximized by fixing the spin-velocity direction\nalong a high symmetry axis, obtaining a speed of 688Km/s with the spin pointing\nat $13^\\circ$ from the surface normal, for the Up, and 906 Km/s and the spin\npointing at $60^\\circ$ from the surface normal, for the Alt system. These speed\nvalues are of order of magnitude larger than those of bulk semiconductors, such\nas CdSe and GaAs, thus making the hydrogenated graphene structures excellent\ncandidates for spintronics applications.\n", "  Effects of superconducting fluctuation (SCF) on thermodynamic properties of\nelectron systems in the so-called BCS-BEC-crossover regime are studied. As the\nattractive interaction between electrons becomes stronger upon approaching the\nBCS-BEC-crossover regime, importance of the mode coupling between SCF\ndrastically increases. The enhanced mode coupling leads to lowering of both the\nzero-field superconducting critical temperature and the depairing field\n$B_\\text{c2} (T)$. Consequently, SCF-induced contributions to the specific heat\nand the diamagnetic susceptibility can seemingly exceed the corresponding\nvalues in the Gaussian approximation. We discuss relevance of the present\nresults to the anomalous SCF-induced diamagnetic response observed in the iron\nselenide (FeSe).\n", "  Simultaneously and coherently studying the large-scale magnetic field and the\nstellar pulsations of a massive star provides strong complementary diagnostics\nsuitable for detailed stellar modelling. This hybrid method is called\nmagneto-asteroseismology and permits the determination of the internal\nstructure and conditions within magnetic massive pulsators, for example the\neffect of magnetism on non-standard mixing processes. Here, we overview this\ntechnique, its requirements, and list the currently known suitable stars to\napply the method.\n", "  $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions can be realized in a strongly interacting quantum\nspin Hall Josephson junction or in a spin Hall Josephson junction strongly\ncoupled to an impurity spin. In this paper we study a system that has both\nfeatures, but with weak (repulsive) interactions and a weakly coupled spin. We\nshow that for a strongly anisotropic exchange interaction, at low temperatures\nthe system enters a strong coupling limit in which it hosts two $\\mathbb{Z}_4$\nparafermions, characterizing a fourfold degeneracy of the ground state. We\nconstruct the parafermion operators explicitly, and show that they facilitate\nfractional $e/2$ charge tunneling across the junction. The dependence of the\neffective low-energy spectrum on the superconducting phase difference reveals\nan $8\\pi$ periodicity of the supercurrent.\n", "  In this study, we present the investigation of eleven recurring solar jets\noriginated from two different sites (site 1 and site 2) close to each other (~\n11 Mm) in the NOAA active region (AR) 12035 during 15--16 April 2014. The jets\nwere observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) telescope onboard the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite. Two jets were observed by the\nAryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital,\nIndia telescope in H-alpha. On 15 April flux emergence is important in site 1\nwhile on 16 April flux emergence and cancellation mechanisms are involved in\nboth sites. The jets of both sites have parallel trajectories and move to the\nsouth with a speed between 100 and 360 km/s. We observed some connection\nbetween the two sites with some transfer of brightening. The jets of site 2\noccurred during the second day and have a tendency to move towards the jets of\nsite 1 and merge with them. We conjecture that the slippage of the jets could\nbe explained by the complex topology of the region with the presence of a few\nlow-altitude null points and many quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), which could\nintersect with one another.\n", "  I put forward a continuum theory for active nematic gels, defined as fluids\nor suspensions of orientable rodlike objects endowed with active dynamics, that\nis based on symmetry arguments and compatibility with thermodynamics. The\nstarting point is our recent theory that models (passive) nematic liquid\ncrystals as relaxing nematic elastomers. The interplay between viscoelastic\nresponse and active dynamics of the microscopic constituents is naturally taken\ninto account. By contrast with standard theories, activity is not introduced as\nan additional term of the stress tensor, but it is added as an external\nremodeling force that competes with the passive relaxation dynamics and drags\nthe system out of equilibrium. In a simple one-dimensional channel geometry, we\nshow that the interaction between non-uniform nematic order and activity\nresults in either a spontaneous flow of particles or a self-organization into\nsub-channels flowing in opposite directions.\n", "  We present a new processing technique aimed at significantly improving the\nangular differential imaging method (ADI) in the context of high-contrast\nimaging of faint objects nearby bright stars in observations obtained with\nextreme adaptive optics (EXAO) systems. This technique, named \"SFADI\" for\n\"Speckle-Free ADI\", allows to improve the achievable contrast by means of\nspeckles identification and suppression. This is possible in very high cadence\ndata, which freeze the atmospheric evolution. Here we present simulations in\nwhich synthetic planets are injected into a real millisecond frame rate\nsequence, acquired at the LBT telescope at visible wavelength, and show that\nthis technique can deliver low and uniform background, allowing unambiguous\ndetection of $10^{-5}$ contrast planets, from $100$ to $300$ mas separations,\nunder poor and highly variable seeing conditions ($0.8$ to $1.5$ arcsec FWHM)\nand in only $20$ min of acquisition. A comparison with a standard ADI approach\nshows that the contrast limit is improved by a factor of $5$. We extensively\ndiscuss the SFADI dependence on the various parameters like speckle\nidentification threshold, frame integration time, and number of frames, as well\nas its ability to provide high-contrast imaging for extended sources, and also\nto work with fast acquisitions.\n", "  We investigate the electronic structure and defect properties of Sn- and Ge-\ndoped ZnTe by first-principles calculations within the DFT+$GW$ formalism. We\nfind that $(\\text{Sn}_\\text{Zn})$ and $(\\text{Ge}_\\text{Zn})$ introduce\nisolated energy levels deep in the band gap of ZnTe, derived from Sn-5s and\nGe-4s states, respectively. Moreover, the incorporation of Sn and Ge on the Zn\nsite is favored in p-type ZnTe, in both Zn-rich and Te-rich environments. The\noptical absorption spectra obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nreveals that sub-bandgap absorptance is greatly enhanced due to the formation\nof the intermediate band. Our results suggest that Sn- and Ge-doped ZnTe would\nbe a suitable material for the development of intermediate-band solar cells,\nwhich have the potential to achieve efficiencies beyond the single-junction\nlimit.\n", "  We study continuous-variable entanglement of bright quantum states in a pair\nof evanescently coupled nonlinear $\\chi^{(2)}$ waveguides operating in the\nregime of degenerate down-conversion. We consider the case where only the\nenergy of the nonlinearly generated fields is exchanged between the waveguides\nwhile the pump fields stay independently guided in each original waveguide. We\nshow that this device, when operated in the depletion regime, entangles the two\nnon-interacting bright pump modes due to a nonlinear cascade effect. It is also\nshown that two-colour quadripartite entanglement can be produced when certain\nsystem parameters are appropriately set. This device works in the\ntraveling-wave configuration, such that the generated quantum light shows a\nbroad spectrum. The proposed device can be easily realized with current\ntechnology and therefore stands as a good candidate for a source of bipartite\nor multipartite entangled states for the emerging field of optical\ncontinuous-variable quantum information processing.\n", "  The so-called H$\\alpha$ third emission occurs around pulsation phase\n$\\varphi$=0.30. It has been observed for the first time in 2011 in some RR\nLyrae stars. The emission intensity is very weak, and its profile is a tiny\npersistent hump in the red side-line profile. We report the first observation\nof the H$\\alpha$ third emission in RR Lyr itself (HD 182989), the brightest RR\nLyrae star in the sky. New spectra were collected in 2013-2014 with the\nAurelie}spectrograph (resolving power R=22$\\,$700, T152, Observatoire de\nHaute-Provence, France) and in 2016-2017 with the eShel spectrograph\n(R=11$\\,$000, T035, Observatoire de Chelles, France). In addition, observations\nobtained in 1997 with the Elodie spectrograph (R=42$\\,$000, T193, Observatoire\nde Haute-Provence, France) were reanalyzed. The H$\\alpha$ third emission is\nclearly detected in the pulsation phase interval $\\varphi$=0.188-0.407, that\nis, during about 20% of the period. Its maximum flux with respect to the\ncontinuum is about 13%. The presence of this third emission and its strength\nboth seem to depend only marginally on the Blazhko phase. The physical origin\nof the emission is probably due to the infalling motion of the highest\natmospheric layers, which compresses and heats the gas that is located\nimmediately above the rising shock wave. The infalling velocity of the hot\ncompressed region is supersonic, almost 50 km$\\cdot$s$^{-1}$, while the shock\nvelocity may be much lower in these pulsation phases. When the H$\\alpha$ third\nemission appears, the shock is certainly no longer radiative because its\nintensity is not sufficient to produce a blueshifted emission component within\nthe H$\\alpha$ profile. At phase $\\varphi$=0.40, the shock wave is certainly\nclose to its complete dissipation in the atmosphere.\n", "  We conjecture a formula which expresses charges of infinitely long states of\nthe Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain model. Several arguments are provided which\nsupport the proposal.\n", "  The formation of self-consistent crystalline structure is a well-known\nphenomenon in complex plasmas. In most experiments the pressure and rf power\nare the main controlling parameters in determining the phase of the system. We\nhave studied the effect of externally applied magnetic field on the\nconfiguration of plasma crystals, suspended in the sheath of a radio-frequency\ndischarge using the Magnetized Dusty Plasma Experiment (MDPX) device.\nExperiments are performed at a fixed pressure and rf power where a crystalline\nstructure is formed within a confining ring. The magnetic field is then\nincreased from 0 to 1.28 T. We report on the breakdown of the crystalline\nstructure with increasing magnetic field. The magnetic field affects the\ndynamics of the plasma particles and first leads to a rotation of the crystal.\nAt higher magnetic field, there is a radial variation (shear) in the angular\nvelocity of the moving particles which we believe leads to the melting of the\ncrystal. This melting is confirmed by evaluating the variation of the pair\ncorrelation function as a function of magnetic field.\n", "  It is considered the problem of spin physics related with the difference of\nrepresentation of the elastic interaction between the neutron and proton. In\nthe first case the charge-exchange reaction $np\\to pn$ under the angle $\\theta$\nis supposed, in the second --- the simple elastic scattering of $np\\to np$,\nwhen the neutron is going in opposite direction $\\pi-\\theta$. The transition\nfrom one representation to another is provided by the Majorana operator. In the\nframework of impulse approximation it is twice calculated the quasi-elastic\ncharge-exchange reaction of a neutron on a deuteron. In the frame of $nd\\to\np(nn)$ scattering of proton to the angle $\\theta$ it gives the well-known Dean\nformula. Using other representation $nd\\to (nn)p$ as a neutron elastic\nscattering under the angle $\\pi-\\theta$ (together with neutron-spectator in\n$nn$-pair) the alternative formula is presented.\n", "  We study the effect of vortices on the tunneling decay of a symmetry-breaking\nfalse vacuum in three spacetime dimensions with gravity. The scenario\nconsidered is one in which the initial state, rather than being the homogeneous\nfalse vacuum, contains false vortices. The question addressed is whether, and,\nif so, under which circumstances, the presence of vortices has a significant\ncatalyzing effect on vacuum decay. After studying the existence and properties\nof vortices, we study their decay rate through quantum tunneling using a\nvariety of techniques. In particular, for so-called thin-wall vortices we\ndevise a one-parameter family of configurations allowing a quantum-mechanical\ncalculation of tunneling. Also for thin-wall vortices, we employ the Israel\njunction conditions between the interior and exterior spacetimes. Matching\nthese two spacetimes reveals a decay channel which results in an unstable,\nexpanding vortex. We find that the tunneling exponent for vortices, which is\nthe dominant factor in the decay rate, is half that for Coleman-de Luccia\nbubbles. This implies that vortices are short-lived, making them cosmologically\nsignificant even for low vortex densities. In the limit of the vanishing\ngravitational constant we smoothly recover our earlier results for the decay of\nthe false vortex in a model without gravity.\n", "  The Langmuir Probe instrument on Rosetta monitored the photoelectron emission\ncur- rent of the probes during the Rosetta mission at comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in essence acting as a photodiode monitoring the\nsolar ultraviolet radiation at wave- lengths below 250 nm. We have used three\nmethods of extracting the photoelectron saturation current from the Langmuir\nprobe measurements. The resulting dataset can be used as an index of the solar\nfar and extreme ultraviolet at the Rosetta spacecraft position, including\nflares, in wavelengths that are important for photoionisation of the cometary\nneutral gas. Comparing the photoemission current to data measurements by\nMAVEN/EUVM and TIMED/SEE, we find good correlation when 67P was at large\nheliocentric distances early and late in the mission, but up to 50 percent\ndecrease of the expected photoelectron current at perihelion. We discuss\npossible reasons for the photoemission decrease, including scattering and\nabsorption by nanograins created by disintegration of cometary dust far away\nfrom the nucleus.\n", "  We propose a physical scheme for the realization of two-dimensional\ntopological odd-parity superfluidity in a spin-independent bond-centered square\noptical lattice based upon interband fermion pairing. The D4 point-group\nsymmetry of the lattice protects a quadratic band crossing, which allows one to\nprepare a Fermi surface of spin-up fermions with odd parity close to the\ndegeneracy point. In the presence of spin-down fermions with even parity\npopulating a different energetically well separated band, odd-parity pairing is\nfavored. Strikingly, as a necessary prerequisite for pairing both Fermi\nsurfaces can be tuned to match well. As a result, topological superfluid phases\nemerge in the presence of merely s-wave interaction. Due to the Z2 symmetry of\nthese odd-parity superfluids, we infer their topological features simply from\nthe symmetry and the Fermi-surface topology as confirmed numerically.\n", "  The theory of quantum fields propagating on an isotropic cosmological quantum\nspacetime is reexamined by generalizing the scalar test field to an\nelectromagnetic (EM) vector field. For any given polarization of the EM field\non the classical background, the Hamiltonian can be written in the form of the\nHamiltonian of a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators, each corresponding to a\nsingle mode of the field. In transition from the classical to quantum spacetime\nbackground, following the technical procedure given by Ashtekar {\\em et al.}\n[Phys. Rev. D 79, 064030 (2009)], a quantum theory of the test EM field on an\neffective (dressed) spacetime emerges. The nature of this emerging dressed\ngeometry is independent of the chosen polarization, but it may depend on the\nenergy of the corresponding field mode. Specifically, when the backreaction of\nthe field on the quantum geometry is negligible (i.e., a test field\napproximation is assumed), all field modes probe the same effective background\nindependent of the mode's energy. However, when the backreaction of the field\nmodes on the quantum geometry is significant, by employing a Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation, it is shown that a rainbow (i.e., a mode-dependent) metric\nemerges. The emergence of this mode-dependent background in the Planck regime\nmay have a significant effect on the creation of quantum particles. The\nproduction amount on the dressed background is computed and is compared with\nthe familiar results on the classical geometry.\n", "  We present the results of Very Large Array NH$_{3}$ $(J,K)=(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$\nobservations of the HH 111/HH 121 protostellar system. HH 111, with a\nspectacular collimated optical jet, is one of the most well-known Herbig-Haro\nobjects. We report the detection of a new source (NH$_{3}-$S) in the vicinity\nof HH 111/HH 121 ($\\sim$0.03 pc from the HH 111 jet source) in two epochs of\nthe ammonia observations. This constitutes the first detection of this source,\nin a region which has been thoroughly covered previously by both continuum and\nspectral line interferometric observations. We study the kinematic and physical\nproperties of HH 111 and the newly discovered NH$_{3}-$S. We also use HCO$^{+}$\nand HCN $(J=4-3)$ data obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and\narchival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array $^{13}$CO, $^{12}$CO, and\nC$^{18}$O $(J=2-1)$, N$_2$D$^{+}$ $(J=3-2)$, and $^{13}$CS $(J=5-4)$ data to\ngain insight into the nature of NH$_{3}-$S. The chemical structure of NH$_3-$S\nshows evidence for \"selective freeze-out\", an inherent characteristic of dense\ncold cores. The inner part of NH$_3-$S shows subsonic non-thermal velocity\ndispersions indicating a \"coherent core\", while they increase in the direction\nof the jets. Archival near- to far-infrared data show no indication of any\nembedded source in NH$_3-$S. The properties of NH$_3-$S and its location in the\ninfrared dark cloud suggest that it is a starless core located in a turbulent\nmedium with turbulence induced by Herbig-Haro jets and associated outflows.\nMore data is needed to fully understand the physical and chemical properties of\nNH$_3-$S and if/how its evolution is affected by nearby jets.\n", "  Recent observations of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Be star HD\n100546 show two bright features in infrared (H and L' bands) at about 50 AU,\nwith one so far unexplained. We explore the observational signatures of a high\nmass planet causing shock heating in order to determine if it could be the\nsource of the unexplained infrared feature in HD 100546. More fundamentally, we\nidentify and characterize planetary shocks as an extra, hitherto ignored,\nsource of luminosity in transition disks. The RADMC-3D code is used to perform\ndust radiative transfer calculations on the hydrodynamical disk models,\nincluding volumetric heating. A stronger shock heating rate by a factor 20\nwould be necessary to qualitatively reproduce the morphology of the second\ninfrared source. Instead, we find that the outer edge of the gap carved by the\nplanet heats up by about 50% relative to the initial reference temperature,\nwhich leads to an increase in the scale height. The bulge is illuminated by the\ncentral star, producing a lopsided feature in scattered light, as the outer gap\nedge shows an asymmetry in density and temperature attributable to a secondary\nspiral arm launched not from the Lindblad resonances but from the 2:1\nresonance. We conclude that high-mass planets lead to shocks in disks that may\nbe directly observed, particularly at wavelengths of 10 mm or longer, but that\nthey are more likely to reveal their presence in scattered light by puffing up\ntheir outer gap edges and exciting multiple spiral arms.\n", "  Linearly polarized Balmer line emissions from supernova remnant shocks are\nstudied taking into account the energy loss of the shock owing to the\nproduction of nonthermal particles. The polarization degree depends on the\ndownstream temperature and the velocity difference between upstream and\ndownstream regions. The former is derived once the line width of the broad\ncomponent of the H$\\alpha$ emission is observed. Then, the observation of the\npolarization degree tells us the latter. At the same time, the estimated value\nof the velocity difference independently predicts adiabatic downstream\ntemperature that is derived from Rankine-Hugoniot relations for adiabatic\nshocks. If the actually observed downstream temperature is lower than the\nadiabatic temperature, there is a missing thermal energy which is consumed for\nparticle acceleration. It is shown that a larger energy loss rate leads to more\nhighly polarized H$\\alpha$ emission. Furthermore, we find that polarized\nintensity ratio of H$\\beta$ to H$\\alpha$ also depends on the energy loss rate\nand that it is independent of uncertain quantities such as electron\ntemperature, the effect of Lyman line trapping and our line of sight.\n", "  We present first results from pilot observations using a phased array feed\n(PAF) mounted on the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. The observations presented\nhere cover a frequency range from 1150 to 1480 MHz and are used to show the\nability of PAFs to suppress standing wave problems by a factor of $\\sim10$\nwhich afflict normal feeds. We also compare our results with previous HIPASS\nobservations and with previous HI images of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Drift\nscan observations of the GAMA G23 field resulted in direct HI detections at\n$z=0.0043$ and $z=0.0055$ of HIPASS galaxies J2242-30 and J2309-30. Our new\nmeasurements generally agree with archival data in spectral shape and flux\ndensity, with small differences being due to differing beam patterns. We also\ndetect signal in the stacked HI data of 1094 individually undetected galaxies\nin the GAMA G23 field in the redshift range $0.05 \\leq z \\leq 0.075$. Finally,\nwe use the low standing wave ripple and wide bandwidth of the PAF to set a\n$3\\sigma$ upper limit to any positronium recombination line emission from the\nGalactic Centre of $<0.09$ K, corresponding to a recombination rate of\n$<3.0\\times10^{45}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n", "  We present final natural system optical (ugriBV) and near-infrared (YJH)\nphotometry of 134 supernovae (SNe) with probable white dwarf progenitors that\nwere observed in 2004-2009 as part of the first stage of the Carnegie Supernova\nProject (CSP-I). The sample consists of 123 Type Ia SNe, 5 Type Iax SNe, 2\nsuper-Chandrasekhar SN candidates, 2 Type Ia SNe interacting with circumstellar\nmatter, and 2 SN 2006bt-like events. The redshifts of the objects range from z\n= 0.0037 to 0.0835; the median redshift is 0.0241. For 120 (90%) of these SNe,\nnear-infrared photometry was obtained. Average optical extinction coefficients\nand color terms are derived and demonstrated to be stable during the five CSP-I\nobserving campaigns. Measurements of the CSP-I near-infrared bandpasses are\nalso described, and near-infrared color terms are estimated through synthetic\nphotometry of stellar atmosphere models. Optical and near-infrared magnitudes\nof local sequences of tertiary standard stars for each supernova are given, and\na new calibration of Y-band magnitudes of the Persson et al. (1998) standards\nin the CSP-I natural system is presented.\n", "  We carry out analyses of some parameters of the galactic spiral arms, in the\ncurrently available samples. We present a catalog of the observed pitch angle\nfor each spiral arm in the Milky Way disk. For each long spiral arm in the\nMilky Way, we investigate for each individual arm its pitch angle, as measured\nthrough different methods (parallaxes, twin-tangent arm, kinematical, etc), and\nassess their answers.\n  Second, we catalog recent advances in the cartography of the Galaxy (global\nmean arm pitch, arm number, arm shape, interarm distance at the Sun). We\nstatistically compare the results over a long time frame, from 1980 to 2017.\nHistograms of about 90 individual results published in recent years (since\nmid-2015) are compared to 66 earlier results (from 1980 to 2005), showing the\nratio of primary to secondary peaks to have increased by almost a factor of 3.\nSimilarly, many earlier discrepancies (expressed in r.m.s.) have been reduced\nby almost a factor 3.\n", "  Very-high-energy (VHE; $>$ 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission from the blazar RGB\nJ2243+203 was discovered with the VERITAS Cherenkov telescope array, during the\nperiod between 21 and 24 December 2014. The VERITAS energy spectrum from this\nsource can be fit by a power law with a photon index of $4.6 \\pm 0.5$, and a\nflux normalization at 0.15 TeV of $(6.3 \\pm 1.1) \\times 10^{-10} ~\n\\textrm{cm}^{-2} \\textrm{s}^{-1} \\textrm{TeV}^{-1}$. The integrated\n\\textit{Fermi}-LAT flux from 1 GeV to 100 GeV during the VERITAS detection is\n$(4.1 \\pm 0.8) \\times 10^{\\textrm{-8}}\n~\\textrm{cm}^{\\textrm{-2}}\\textrm{s}^{\\textrm{-1}}$, which is an order of\nmagnitude larger than the four-year-averaged flux in the same energy range\nreported in the 3FGL catalog, ($4.0 \\pm 0.1 \\times 10^{\\textrm{-9}} ~\n\\textrm{cm}^{\\textrm{-2}}\\textrm{s}^{\\textrm{-1}}$). The detection with VERITAS\ntriggered observations in the X-ray band with the \\textit{Swift}-XRT. However,\ndue to scheduling constraints \\textit{Swift}-XRT observations were performed 67\nhours after the VERITAS detection, not simultaneous with the VERITAS\nobservations. The observed X-ray energy spectrum between 2 keV and 10 keV can\nbe fitted with a power-law with a spectral index of $2.7 \\pm 0.2$, and the\nintegrated photon flux in the same energy band is $(3.6 \\pm 0.6) \\times\n10^{-13} ~\\textrm{cm}^{-2} \\textrm{s}^{-1}$. EBL model-dependent upper limits\nof the blazar redshift have been derived. Depending on the EBL model used, the\nupper limit varies in the range from z $<~0.9$ to z $<~1.1$.\n", "  Rare weak decays of $\\eta^\\prime\\to K\\pi$ have been investigated in the\nframework of the $U(3)$ chiral perturbation theory at the leading order. Our\nstudy shows that the branching ratio ${\\cal B}(\\eta^\\prime\\to K\\pi)$ is of the\norder of $10^{-11}$, which is far below the present experimental upper bound\ngiven by the BESIII Collaboration. By further analysis of $\\eta^\\prime\\to\nK^+\\pi^-$ and $\\eta^\\prime\\to K^0\\pi^0$, the ratio of isospin amplitudes is\nfound that $|A_{1/2}/A_{3/2}|\\simeq 35$, which supports that the $\\Delta I=1/2$\ntransition enhancement, namely, the $\\Delta I=1/2$ rule, could be functional in\n$\\eta^\\prime$ weak decays.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength data analysis of the extended star-forming\nregion S235 (hereafter E-S235), where two molecular clouds are present. In\nE-S235, using the 12CO (1-0) and 13CO (1-0) line data, a molecular cloud linked\nwith the site \"S235main\" is traced in a velocity range [-24, -18] km s^{-1},\nwhile the other one containing the sites S235A, S235B, and S235C (hereafter\n\"S235ABC\") is depicted in a velocity range [-18, -13] km s^{-1}. In the\nvelocity space, these two clouds are separated by ~4 km s^{-1}, and are\ninterconnected by a lower intensity intermediate velocity emission, tracing a\nbroad bridge feature. In the velocity channel maps, a possible complementary\nmolecular pair at [-21, -20] km s^{-1} and [-16, -15] km s^{-1} is also\nevident. The sites, \"S235ABC\", East 1, and South-West are spatially seen in the\ninterface of two clouds. Together, these observed features are consistent with\nthe predictions of numerical models of the cloud-cloud collision (CCC) process,\nfavoring the onset of the CCC in E-S235 about 0.5 Myr ago. Deep UKIDSS\nnear-infrared photometric analysis of point-like sources reveals significant\nclustering of young stellar populations toward the sites located at the\njunction, and the \"S235main\". The sites, \"S235ABC\" harbor young compact H II\nregions having dynamical ages of ~0.06-0.22 Myr, and these sites (including\nSouth-West and East 1) also contain dust clumps (having M_clump ~40 to 635\nM_sun). Our observational findings suggest that the star formation activities\n(including massive stars) appear to be influenced by the CCC mechanism at the\njunction.\n", "  We discuss the idea that the Tsallis-type (q-additive) entropic chain rule\nallows for a wider class of entropic functionals than previously thought. In\nparticular, we point out that the ensuing entropy solutions (e.g., Tsallis\nentropy) can be determined uniquely only when one fixes the prescription for\nhandling conditional entropies. Our point is substantiated with the Dar\\'otzy's\nmapping theorem and DeFinetti-Kolmogorov theorem for escort distributions and\nillustrated with a number of examples. Connection with Landsberg's\nclassification of non-extensive thermodynamical systems is also briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Observations of the fluorescent Fe K-alpha emission line from the inner\naccretion flows of stellar mass black holes in X-ray binaries and supermassive\nblack holes in Active Galactic Nuclei have become an important tool to study\nthe magnitude and inclination of the black hole spin, and the structure of the\naccretion flow close to the event horizon of the black hole. Modeling spectral,\ntiming, and soon also X-ray polarimetric observations of the Fe K-alpha\nemission requires to calculate the specific intensity in the rest frame of the\nemitting plasma. We revisit the derivation of the equation used for calculating\nthe illumination of the accretion disk by the corona. We present an alternative\nderivation leading to a simpler equation, and discuss the relation to the\npreviously published results.\n", "  We review the unconventional photon blockade mechanism. This quantum effect\nremarkably enables a strongly sub-Poissonian light statistics, even from a\nsystem characterized by a weak single photon nonlinearity. We revisit the past\nresults, which can be interpreted in terms of quantum interferences or optimal\nsqueezing, and show how recent developments on input-output field mixing can\novercome the limitations of the original schemes towards passive and integrable\nsingle photon sources. We finally present some valuable alternative schemes for\nwhich the unconventional blockade can be directly adapted.\n", "  We present observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko acquired in\nsupport of the $Rosetta$ mission. We obtained usable data on 68 nights from\n2014 September until 2016 May, with data acquired regularly whenever the comet\nwas observable. We collected an extensive set of near-IR $J$, $H$, and $Ks$\ndata throughout the apparition plus visible-light images in $g'$, $r'$, $i'$,\nand $z'$ when the comet was fainter. We also obtained broadband $R$ and\nnarrowband $CN$ filter observations when the comet was brightest using\ntelescopes at Lowell Observatory. The appearance was dominated by a central\ncondensation and the tail until 2015 June. From 2015 August onwards there were\nclear asymmetries in the coma, which enhancements revealed to be due to the\npresence of up to three features (i.e., jets). The features were similar in all\nbroadband filters; $CN$ images did not show these features but were instead\nbroadly enhanced in the southeastern hemisphere. Modeling using the parameters\nfrom Vincent et al. (2013) replicated the dust morphology reasonably well,\nindicating that the pole orientation and locations of active areas have been\nrelatively unchanged over at least the last three apparitions. The dust\nproduction, as measured by $A(0^{\\circ})f{\\rho}$ peaked $\\sim$30 days after\nperihelion and was consistent with predictions from previous apparitions.\n$A(0^{\\circ})f{\\rho}$ as a function of heliocentric distance was well fit by a\npower-law with slope $-$4.2 from 35-120 days post-perihelion. We detected\nphotometric evidence of apparent outbursts on 2015 August 22 and 2015 September\n19, although neither was discernible morphologically in this dataset.\n", "  L dwarfs exhibit low-level, rotationally-modulated photometric variability\ngenerally associated with heterogeneous, cloud-covered atmospheres. The\nspectral character of these variations yields insight into the particle sizes\nand vertical structure of the clouds. Here we present the results of a high\nprecision, ground-based, near-infrared, spectral monitoring study of two\nmid-type L dwarfs that have variability reported in the literature, 2MASS\nJ08354256-0819237 and 2MASS J18212815+1414010, using the SpeX instrument on the\nInfrared Telescope Facility. By simultaneously observing a nearby reference\nstar, we achieve <0.15% per-band sensitivity in relative brightness changes\nacross the 0.9--2.4um bandwidth. We find that 2MASS J0835-0819 exhibits\nmarginal (< ~0.5% per band) variability with no clear spectral dependence,\nwhile 2MASS J1821+1414 varies by up to +/-1.5% at 0.9 um, with the variability\namplitude declining toward longer wavelengths. The latter result extends the\nvariability trend observed in prior HST/WFC3 spectral monitoring of 2MASS\nJ1821+1414, and we show that the full 0.9-2.4 um variability amplitude spectrum\ncan be reproduced by Mie extinction from dust particles with a log-normal\nparticle size distribution with a median radius of 0.24 um. We do not detect\nstatistically significant phase variations with wavelength. The different\nvariability behavior of 2MASS J0835-0819 and 2MASS J1821+1414 suggests\ndependencies on viewing angle and/or overall cloud content, underlying factors\nthat can be examined through a broader survey.\n", "  AX J1745.6-2901 is a high-inclination (eclipsing) transient neutron star (NS)\nLow Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) showcasing intense ionised Fe K absorption. We\npresent here the analysis of 11 XMM-Newton and 15 NuSTAR new data-sets\n(obtained between 2013-2016), therefore tripling the number of observations of\nAX J1745.6-2901 in outburst. Thanks to simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR\nspectra, we greatly improve on the fitting of the X-ray continuum. During the\nsoft state the emission can be described by a disk black body ($kT\\sim1.1-1.2$\nkeV and inner disc radius $r_{DBB}\\sim14$ km), plus hot ($kT\\sim2.2-3.0$ keV)\nblack body radiation with a small emitting radius ($r_{BB}\\sim0.5-0.8$ km)\nlikely associated with the boundary layer or NS surface, plus a faint\nComptonisation component. Imprinted on the spectra are clear absorption\nfeatures created by both neutral and ionised matter. Additionally, positive\nresiduals suggestive of an emission Fe K$\\alpha$ disc line and consistent with\nrelativistic ionised reflection are present during the soft state, while such\nresiduals are not significant during the hard state. The hard state spectra are\ncharacterised by a hard ($\\Gamma\\sim1.9-2.1$) power law, showing no evidence\nfor a high energy cut off ($kT_e>60-140$ keV) and implying a small optical\ndepth ($\\tau<1.6$). The new observations confirm the previously witnessed trend\nof exhibiting strong Fe K absorption in the soft state, that significantly\nweakens during the hard state. Optical (GROND) and radio (GMRT) observations\nsuggest for AX J1745.6-2901 a standard broad band SED as typically observed in\naccreting neutron stars.\n", "  Near Infrared (NIR) and optical photometry and spectroscopy are presented for\nthe nova V1831 Aquilae, covering the early decline and dust forming phases\nduring the first $\\sim$90 days after its discovery. The nova is highly reddened\ndue to interstellar extinction. Based solely on the nature of NIR spectrum we\nare able to classify the nova to be of the Fe II class. The distance and\nextinction to the nova are estimated to be 6.1 $\\pm$ 0.5 kpc and $A_{\\rm v}$\n$\\sim$ 9.02 respectively. Lower limits of the electron density, emission\nmeasure and ionized ejecta mass are made from a Case B analysis of the NIR\nBrackett lines while the neutral gas mass is estimated from the optical [OI]\nlines. We discuss the cause for a rapid strengthening of the He I 1.0830 $\\mu$m\nline during the early stages. V1831 Aql formed a modest amount of dust fairly\nearly ($\\sim$ 19.2 days after discovery); the dust shell is not seen to be\noptically thick. Estimates are made of the dust temperature, dust mass and\ngrain size. Dust formation commences around day 19.2 at a condensation\ntemperature of 1461 $\\pm$ 15 K, suggestive of a carbon composition, following\nwhich the temperature is seen to gradually decrease to 950K. The dust mass\nshows a rapid initial increase which we interpret as being due to an increase\nin the number of grains, followed by a period of constancy suggesting the\nabsence of grain destruction processes during this latter time. A discussion is\nmade of the evolution of these parameters, including certain peculiarities seen\nin the grain radius evolution.\n", "  The hyperbolic phonon-polaritons within the Reststrahlen band of hBN are of\ngreat interest for applications in nanophotonics as they are capable of\npropagating light signals with low losses over large distances. However, due to\nthe phononic nature of the polaritons in hBN, amplitude modulation of its\nsignal proves to be difficult and has been underexplored. In this paper, we\npropose theoretically a broadband efficient amplitude modulator for hyperbolic\nrays in hBN operating in the frequency range between 1450 cm$^{-1}$ and 1550\ncm$^{-1}$. The modulating region comprises a few tens of nanometers wide gap\ncarved within the hBN slab and covered by a graphene layer, where\nelectrostatically gated graphene serves as a mediator that facilitates the\ncoupling between phonon-polaritons on each side of the gap through plasmonic\nmodes within graphene. We demonstrate that such an ultra compact modulator has\ninsertion losses as low as 3 dB and provides modulation depth varying between\n14 and 20 dB within the type-II hyperbolicity region of hBN.\n", "  Simulations of purely self-gravitating N-body systems are often used in\nastrophysics and cosmology to study the collisionless limit of such systems.\nTheir results for macroscopic quantities should then converge well for\nsufficiently large N. Using a study of the evolution from a simple space of\nspherical initial conditions - including a region characterised by so-called\n\"radial orbit instability\" - we illustrate that the values of N at which such\nconvergence is obtained can vary enormously. In the family of initial\nconditions we study, good convergence can be obtained up to a few dynamical\ntimes with N $ \\sim 10^3$ - just large enough to suppress two body relaxation -\nfor certain initial conditions, while in other cases such convergence is not\nattained at this time even in our largest simulations with N $\\sim 10^5$. The\nqualitative difference is due to the stability properties of fluctuations\nintroduced by the N-body discretisation, of which the initial amplitude depends\non N. We discuss briefly why the crucial role which such fluctuations can\npotentially play in the evolution of the N-body system could, in particular,\nconstitute a serious problem in cosmological simulations of dark matter.\n", "  We investigated the electronic structure of the vacancy-ordered 4d-transition\nmetal monoxide NbO (Nb3O3) using angle-integrated soft- and hard-x-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy as well as ultra-violet angle-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy. We found that density-functional-based band structure\ncalculations can describe the spectral features accurately provided that\nself-interaction effects are taken into account. In the angle-resolved spectra\nwe were able to identify the so-called vacancy band that characterizes the\nordering of the vacancies. This together with the band structure results\nindicates the important role of the very large inter-Nb-4d hybridization for\nthe formation of the ordered vacancies and the high thermal stability of the\nordered structure of niobium monoxide.\n", "  New and more reliable distances and proper motions of a large number of stars\nin the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) catalogue allow to calculate the\nlocal matter density distribution more precisely than earlier. We devised a\nmethod to calculate the stationary gravitational potential distribution\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane by comparing the vertical probability\ndensity distribution of a sample of observed stars with the theoretical\nprobability density distribution computed from their vertical coordinates and\nvelocities. We applied the model to idealised test stars and to the real\nobservational samples. Tests with two mock datasets proved that the method is\nviable and provides reasonable results. Applying the method to TGAS data we\nderived that the total matter density in the Solar neighbourhood is $0.09\\pm\n0.02 \\text{M}_\\odot\\text{pc}^{-3}$ being consistent with the results from\nliterature. The matter surface density within $|z|\\le 0.75 \\text{kpc}$ is\n$42\\pm 4 \\text{M}_\\odot\\text{pc}^{-2}$. This is slightly less than the results\nderived by other authors but within errors is consistent with previous\nestimates. Our results show no firm evidence for significant amount of dark\nmatter in the Solar neighbourhood. However, we caution that our calculations at\n$|z| \\leq 0.75$ kpc rely on an extrapolation from the velocity distribution\nfunction calculated at $|z| \\leq 25$ pc. This extrapolation can be very\nsensitive to our assumption that the stellar motions are perfectly decoupled in\nR and z, and to our assumption of equilibrium. Indeed, we find that $\\rho (z)$\nwithin $|z|\\le 0.75$ kpc is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane at\ndistances $|z| = 0.1-0.4$ kpc indicating that the density distribution may be\ninfluenced by density perturbations.\n", "  We investigate galaxy evolution in protoclusters using a semi-analytic model\napplied to the Millennium Simulation, scaled to a Planck cosmology. We show\nthat the model reproduces the observed behaviour of the star formation history\n(SFH) both in protoclusters and the field. The rate of star formation peaks\n$\\sim0.7\\,{\\rm Gyr}$ earlier in protoclusters than in the field and declines\nmore rapidly afterwards. This results in protocluster galaxies forming\nsignificantly earlier: 80% of their stellar mass is already formed by $z=1.4$,\nbut only 45% of the field stellar mass has formed by this time. The model\npredicts that field and protocluster galaxies have similar average specific\nstar-formation rates (sSFR) at $z>3$, and we find evidence of an enhancement of\nstar formation in the dense protoclusters at early times. At $z<3$,\nprotoclusters have lower sSFRs, resulting in the disparity between the SFHs. We\nshow that the stellar mass functions of protoclusters are top-heavy compared\nwith the field due to the early formation of massive galaxies, and the\ndisruption and merging of low-mass satellite galaxies in the main haloes. The\nfundamental cause of the different SFHs and mass functions is that dark matter\nhaloes are biased tracers of the dark matter density field: the high density of\nhaloes and the top-heavy halo mass function in protoclusters result in the\nearly formation then rapid merging and quenching of galaxies. We compare our\nresults with observations from the literature, and highlight which observables\nprovide the most informative tests of galaxy formation.\n", "  In order to investigate the formation mechanisms of the rare compact\nelliptical galaxies (cE) we have compiled a sample of 25 cEs with good SDSS\nspectra, covering a range of stellar masses, sizes and environments. They have\nbeen visually classified according to the interaction with their host,\nrepresenting different evolutionary stages. We have included clearly disrupted\ngalaxies, galaxies that despite not showing signs of interaction are located\nclose to a massive neighbor (thus are good candidates for a stripping process),\nand cEs with no host nearby. For the latter, tidal stripping is less likely to\nhave happened and instead they could simply represent the very low-mass, faint\nend of the ellipticals. We study a set of properties (structural parameters,\nstellar populations, star formation histories and mass ratios) that can be used\nto discriminate between an intrinsic or stripped origin. We find that one\ndiagnostic tool alone is inconclusive for the majority of objects. However, if\nwe combine all the tools a clear picture emerges. The most plausible origin, as\nwell as the evolutionary stage and progenitor type, can be then determined. Our\nresults favor the stripping mechanism for those galaxies in groups and clusters\nthat have a plausible host nearby, but favors an intrinsic origin for those\nrare cEs without a plausible host and that are located in looser environments.\n", "  Magnetorotational instability (MRI) has a potential to generate the vigorous\nturbulence in protoplanetary disks, although its turbulence strength and\naccretion stress remains debatable because of the uncertainty of MRI with low\nionization fraction. We focus on the heating of electrons by strong electric\nfields which amplifies nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects. The heated\nelectrons frequently collide with and stick to dust grains, which in turn\ndecreases the ionization fraction and is expected to weaken the turbulent\nmotion driven by MRI. In order to quantitatively investigate the nonlinear\nevolution of MRI including the electron heating, we perform\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulation with the unstratified shearing box. We\nintroduce a simple analytic resistivity model depending on the current density\nby mimicking resistivity given by the calculation of ionization. Our simulation\nconfirms that the electron heating suppresses magnetic turbulence when the\nelectron heating occurs with low current density. We find a clear correlation\nbetween magnetic stress and its current density, which means that the magnetic\nstress is proportional to the squared current density. When the turbulent\nmotion is completely suppressed, laminar accretion flow is caused by ordered\nmagnetic field. We give an analytical description of the laminar state by using\na solution of linear perturbation equations with resistivity. We also propose a\nformula that successfully predicts the accretion stress in the presence of the\nelectron heating.\n", "  Black hole (BH) mass of Type I active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be measured\nor estimated through either reverberation mapping (RM) or empirical $R-L$\nrelation, however, both of them suffer from uncertainties of the virial factor\n($f_{\\rm BLR}$), thus limiting the measurement accuracy. In this letter, we\nmake an effort to investigate $f_{\\rm BLR}$ through polarised spectra of the\nbroad-line regions (BLR) arisen from electrons in the equatorial plane. Given\nthe BLR composed of discrete clouds with Keplerian velocity around the central\nBH, we simulate a large number of spectra of total and polarised flux with wide\nranges of parameters of the BLR model and equatorial scatters. We find that the\n$f_{\\rm BLR}$-distribution of polarised spectra is much narrower than that of\ntotal ones. This provides a way of n accurately estimating BH mass from single\nspectropolarimetric observations of type I AGN whose equatorial scatters are\nidentified.\n", "  With the aim of exploring the Higgs sector of the Two Higgs Doublet Model\n(2HDM), we have chosen the exact and soft $Z_2$ symmetry breaking versions of\nthe 2HDM with non-zero vacuum expectation values for both Higgs doublets (Mixed\nModel). We consider two SM-like scenarios: with 125 GeV $h$ and 125 GeV $H$. We\nhave applied the condition for cancellation of quadratic divergences in the\ntype II 2HDM in order to derive masses of the heavy scalars. Solutions of two\nrelevant conditions were found in the considered SM-like scenarios. After\napplying the current LHC data for the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson, the\nprecision electroweak data test and lower limits on the mass of $H^+$, the\nallowed region of parameters shrink strongly.\n", "  Extended gaps in the debris disks of both Vega and Fomalhaut have been\nobserved. These structures have been attributed to tidal perturbations by\nmultiple super-Jupiter gas giant planets. Within the current observational\nlimits, however, no such massive planets have been detected. Here we propose a\nless stringent `lone-planet' scenario to account for the observed structure\nwith a single eccentric gas giant and suggest that clearing of these wide gaps\nis induced by its sweeping secular resonance. During the depletion of the disk\ngas, the planet's secular resonance propagates inward and clears a wide gap\nover an extended region of the disk. Although some residual intermediate-size\nplanetesimals may remain in the gap, their surface density is too low to either\nproduce super-Earths or lead to sufficiently frequent disruptive collisions to\ngenerate any observable dusty signatures. The main advantage of this\nlone-planet sweeping-secular-resonance model over the previous multiple gas\ngiant tidal truncation scenario is the relaxed requirement on the number of gas\ngiants. The observationally inferred upper mass limit can also be satisfied\nprovided the hypothetical planet has a significant eccentricity. A significant\nfraction of solar or more massive stars bear gas giant planets with significant\neccentricities. If these planets acquired their present-day kinematic\nproperties prior to the depletion of their natal disks, their sweeping secular\nresonance would effectively impede the retention of neighboring planets and\nplanetesimals over a wide range of orbital semi-major axes.\n", "  We present VLA images and HST/STIS spectra of sources within the center of\nthe brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in Abell 2261. These observations were\nobtained to test the hypothesis that its extremely large, flat core reflects\nthe ejection of its supermassive black hole. Spectra of three of the four most\nluminous \"knots\" embedded in the core were taken to test whether one may\nrepresent stars bound to a displaced massive black hole. The three knots have\nradial velocity offsets dV < ~150 km/s from the BCG. Knots 2 and 3 show\nkinematics, colors, and stellar masses consistent with infalling low-mass\ngalaxies or larger stripped cluster members. Large errors in the stellar\nvelocity dispersion of Knot 1, however, mean that we cannot rule out the\nhypothesis that it hosts a high-mass black hole. A2261-BCG has a compact, relic\nradio-source offset by 6.5 kpc (projected) from the optical core's center, but\nno active radio core that would pinpoint the galaxy's central black hole to a\ntight 10 GHz flux limit <3.6 uJy. Its spectrum and morphology are suggestive of\nan active galactic nucleus that switched off >48 Myr ago, with an equipartition\ncondition magnetic field of 15 uG. These observations are still consistent with\nthe hypothesis that the nuclear black hole has been ejected from its core, but\nthe critical task of locating the supermassive black hole or demonstrating that\nA2261-BCG lacks one remains to be done.\n", "  We use observations made with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to\nprobe the neutral hydrogen (HI) gas content of field galaxies in the VIMOS VLT\nDeep Survey (VVDS) 14h field at $z \\approx 0.32$. Because the HI emission from\nindividual galaxies is too faint to detect at this redshift, we use an HI\nspectral stacking technique using the known optical positions and redshifts of\nthe 165 galaxies in our sample to co-add their HI spectra and thus obtain the\naverage HI mass of the galaxies. Stacked HI measurements of 165 galaxies show\nthat 95 per cent of the neutral gas is found in blue, star-forming galaxies.\nAmong these galaxies, those having lower stellar mass are more gas-rich than\nmore massive ones. We apply a volume correction to our HI measurement to\nevaluate the HI gas density at $z \\approx 0.32$ as $\\Omega_{HI}=(0.50\\pm0.18)\n\\times 10^{-3}$ in units of the cosmic critical density. This value is in good\nagreement with previous results at z < 0.4, suggesting no evolution in the\nneutral hydrogen gas density over the last $\\sim 4$ Gyr. However the $z \\approx\n0.32$ gas density is lower than that at $z \\sim 5$ by at least a factor of two.\n", "  We demonstrate a quasi optical cycling for the $X(v=0)\\to A(v'=0)$ transition\nand a radiative force induced deflection on the buffer-gas cooled BaF molecular\nbeam. The laser induced fluorescence enhancement with additional sidebands and\na polarization modulation scheme indicates that the hyperfine states and the\nZeeman sublevels are closed. The quasi optical cycling by repumping the\n$X(v=1)\\to A(v'=0)$ leads to a $\\sim$ 0.8 mm deflection of the beam via\nscattering $\\sim$ 150 photons per molecule, in good agreement with the\npredictions from our multi-level rate equation model. Further improvement by\nclosing the leakage $X(v=2)$ and $\\Delta$ state allows scattering thousands of\nphotons, and laser cooling and slowing of BaF.\n", "  The origin of the observed morphological and kinematic substructure of young\nstar forming regions is a matter of debate. We offer a new analysis of data\nfrom simulations of globally gravitationally collapsing clouds of progenitor\ngas to answer questions about sub-structured star formation in the context of\ncold collapse. As a specific example, we compare our models to recent radial\nvelocity survey data from the IN-SYNC survey of Orion and new observations of\ndense gas kinematics, and offer possible interpretations of kinematic and\nmorphological signatures in the region. In the context of our model, we find\nthe frequently-observed hub-filament morphology of the gas naturally arises\nduring gravitational evolution, as well as the dynamically-distinct kinematic\nsubstructure of stars. We emphasize that the global and not just the local\ngravitational potential plays an important role in determining the dynamics of\nboth clusters and filaments.\n", "  We examine limits to the energy to which cosmic rays can be accelerated by\nrelativistic shocks, showing that acceleration of light ions as high as 100 EeV\nis unlikely. The implication of our estimates is that if ultra-high energy\ncosmic rays are accelerated by shocks, then those shocks are probably not\nrelativistic.\n", "  So-called `non-factorisable' toroidal orbifolds can be rewritten in a\nfactorised form as a product of three two-tori by imposing an additional shift\nsymmetry. This finding of Blaszczyk et al., arXiv:1111.5852, provides a new\navenue to Conformal Field Theory methods, by which the vector-like massless\nmatter spectrum - and thereby the type of gauge group enhancement on\norientifold invariant fractional D6-branes - and the one-loop corrections to\nthe gauge couplings in Type IIA orientifold theories can be computed in\naddition to the well-established chiral matter spectrum derived from\ntopological intersection numbers among three-cycles. We demonstrate this\nframework for the $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\Omega\\mathcal{R}$ orientifolds on the\n$A_3 \\times A_1 \\times B_2$-type torus. As observed before for factorisable\nbackgrounds, also here the one-loop correction can drive the gauge groups to\nstronger coupling as demonstrated by means of a four-generation Pati-Salam\nexample.\n", "  In this paper, we stack neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) spectra for 9,720 star\nforming galaxies along the mass-metallicity relation. The sample is selected\naccording to stellar mass (10$^9 \\leq$ M$_{\\star}$/M$_{\\odot}\\leq$10$^{11}$)\nand redshift ($0.02 \\leq z \\leq 0.05$) from the overlap of the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey and Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. We confirm and quantify the\nstrong anti-correlation between HI mass and gas-phase metallicity at fixed\nstellar mass. Furthermore, we show for the first time that the relationship\nbetween gas content and metallicity is consistent between different metallicity\nestimators, contrary to the weaker trends found with star formation which are\nknown to depend on the observational techniques used to derive oxygen\nabundances and star formation rates. When interpreted in the context of\ntheoretical work, this result supports a scenario where galaxies exist in an\nevolving equilibrium between gas, metallicity and star formation. The fact that\ndeviations from this equilibrium are most strongly correlated with gas mass\nsuggests that the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation is primarily driven\nby fluctuations in gas accretion.\n", "  We investigate the population of high-redshift ($3\\leq z < 6$) AGN selected\nin the two deepest X-ray surveys, the 7 Ms \\textit{Chandra} Deep Field-South\nand 2 Ms \\textit{Chandra} Deep Field-North. Their outstanding sensitivity and\nspectral characterization of faint sources allow us to focus on the sub-$L_*$\nregime (log$L_{\\mathrm{X}}\\lesssim44$), poorly sampled by previous works using\nshallower data, and the obscured population. Taking fully into account the\nindividual photometric-redshift probability distribution functions, the final\nsample consists of $\\approx102$ X-ray selected AGN at $3\\leq z < 6$. The\nfraction of AGN obscured by column densities log$N_{\\mathrm{H}}>23$ is\n$\\sim0.6-0.8$, once incompleteness effects are taken into account, with no\nstrong dependence on redshift or luminosity. We derived the high-redshift AGN\nnumber counts down to\n$F_{\\mathrm{0.5-2\\,keV}}=7\\times10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$,\nextending previous results to fainter fluxes, especially at $z>4$. We put the\ntightest constraints to date on the low-luminosity end of AGN luminosity\nfunction at high redshift. The space-density, in particular, declines at $z>3$\nat all luminosities, with only a marginally steeper slope for low-luminosity\nAGN. By comparing the evolution of the AGN and galaxy densities, we suggest\nthat such a decline at high luminosities is mainly driven by the underlying\ngalaxy population, while at low luminosities there are hints of an intrinsic\nevolution of the parameters driving nuclear activity. Also, the black-hole\naccretion rate density and star-formation rate density, which are usually found\nto evolve similarly at $z\\lesssim3$, appear to diverge at higher redshifts.\n", "  Meridional circulation is a crucial component of the Sun's internal dynamics,\nbut its inference in the deep interior is complicated by a systematic\ncenter-to-limb effect in helioseismic measurement techniques. Previously, an\nempirical method, removing travel-time shifts measured for east-west traveling\nwaves in the equatorial area from those measured for north-south traveling\nwaves in the central meridian area, was used, but its validity and accuracy\nneed to be assessed. Here we develop a new method to separate the\ncenter-to-limb effect, \\delta\\tau_CtoL, and meridional-flow-induced travel-time\nshifts, \\delta\\tau_MF, in a more robust way. Using 7-yr observations of the\nSDO/HMI, we exhaustively measure travel-time shifts between two surface\nlocations along the solar disk's radial direction for all azimuthal angles and\nall skip distances. The measured travel-time shifts are a linear combination of\n\\delta\\tau_CtoL and \\delta\\tau_MF, which can be disentangled through solving\nthe linear equation set. The \\delta\\tau_CtoL is found isotropic relative to the\nazimuthal angle, and the \\delta\\tau_MF are then inverted for the meridional\ncirculation. Our inversion results show a three-layer flow structure, with\nequatorward flow found between about 0.82 and 0.91 R_sun for low latitude areas\nand between about 0.85 and 0.91 R_sun for higher latitude areas. Poleward flows\nare found below and above the equatorward flow zones, indicating a double-cell\ncirculation in each hemisphere.\n", "  The planar arrangement of nearly half the satellite galaxies of M31 has been\na source of mystery and speculation since it was discovered. With a growing\nnumber of other host galaxies showing these satellite galaxy planes, their\nstability and longevity have become central to the debate on whether the\npresence of satellite planes are a natural consequence of prevailing\ncosmological models, or represent a challenge. Given the dependence of their\nstability on host halo shape, we look into how a galaxy plane's dark matter\nenvironment influences its longevity. An increased number of dark matter\nsubhalos results in increased interactions that hasten the deterioration of an\nalready-formed plane of satellite galaxies in spherical dark halos. The role of\ntotal dark matter mass fraction held in subhalos in dispersing a plane of\ngalaxies present non trivial effects on plane longevity as well. But any\nmisalignments of plane inclines to major axes of flattened dark matter halos\nlead to their lifetimes being reduced to < 3 Gyrs. Distributing > 40% of total\ndark mass in subhalos in the overall dark matter distribution results in a\nplane of satellite galaxies that is prone to change through the 5 Gyr\nintegration time period.\n", "  The X-ray plateau followed by a steep decay (\"internal plateau\") has been\nobserved in both long and short gamma-ray burst (GRBs), implying a millisecond\nmagnetar operating in some GRBs. The sharp decay at the end of plateau, marking\nthe abrupt cessation of the magnetar central engine, has been considered as the\ncollapse of a supra-massive magnetar to a black hole (BH) when it spins down.\nIf \"internal plateau\" is indeed the evidence of a magnetar central engine, a\nnatural expectation is a signature from the new-born BH in some candidates. In\nthis work, we find that GRB 070110 is a particular case, which shows a small\nX-ray bump following its \"internal plateau\". We interpret the plateau with a\nspin-down supra-massive magnetar and the X-ray bump with a fall-back BH\naccretion. This indicates that the new-born BH is likely active in some GRBs.\nTherefore, GRB 070110-like events may provide a further support to the magnetar\ncentral engine model and enable us to investigate the properties of the\nmagnetar as well as the new-born BH.\n", "  We propose an efficient scheme for the generation of tunable optical\nwaveguide based on atomic vapor in N -type configuration. We exploit both\ncontrol field induced transparency and Kerr field induced absorption to produce\na flexible probe transparency window otherwise not feasible. We employ a\nsuitable spatial profile of control and Kerr beams to create a high contrast\nrefractive in- dex modulation that holds the key to guiding a weak narrow probe\nbeam. Further we numerically demonstrate that high contrast tunable waveguide\npermits the propagation of different modes of probe beam to several Rayleigh\nlengths without diffraction. This efficient guiding of narrow opti- cal beam\nmay have important applications in large density image processing, and high\nresolution imaging.\n", "  According to the current paradigm of circumstellar disk evolution, gas-rich\nprimordial disks evolve into gas-poor debris disks compose of second-generation\ndust. To explore the transition between these phases, we searched for\n$^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O emission in seven dust-rich debris disks\naround young A-type stars, using ALMA in Band 6. We discovered molecular gas in\nthree debris disks. In all these disks, the $^{12}$CO line was optically thick,\nhighlighting the importance of less abundant molecules in reliable mass\nestimates. Supplementing our target list by literature data, we compiled a\nvolume-limited sample of dust-rich debris disks around young A-type stars\nwithin 150 pc. We obtained a CO detection rate of 11/16 above a $^{12}$CO\nJ=2$-$1 line luminosity threshold of $\\sim 1.4 \\times 10 ^4$ Jykms$^{-1}$pc$^2$\nin the sample. This high incidence implies that the presence of CO gas in\nbright debris disks around young A-type stars is likely more the rule than the\nexception. Interestingly, dust-rich debris disks around young FG-type stars\nexhibit, with the same detectability threshold as for A-type stars,\nsignificantly lower gas incidence. While the transition from protoplanetary to\ndebris phase is associated with a drop of dust content, our results exhibit a\nlarge spread in the CO mass in our debris sample, with peak values comparable\nto those in protoplanetary Herbig Ae disks. In the particularly CO-rich debris\nsystems the gas may have primordial origin, characteristic of a hybrid disk.\n", "  We present a new quantum bit commitment (QBC) protocol based on\ncounterfactual quantum cryptography. We analyze the security of this protocol,\nfind that it can resist the attack presented by QBC's no-go theorem. Our\nprotocol is simple, and probably give a new way of constructing QBC protocol.\n", "  Hot exozodiacal dust emission was detected in recent surveys around two dozen\nmain sequence stars at distances of less than $1\\,\\text{au}$ using H and K band\ninterferometry. Due to the high contrast as well as the small angular distance\nbetween the circumstellar dust and the star, direct observation of this dust\ncomponent is challenging. An alternative way to explore the hot exozodiacal\ndust is provided by mid-infrared interferometry. We analyze the L, M and N band\ninterferometric signature of this emission in order to find stronger\nconstraints for the properties and the origin of the hot exozodiacal dust.\nConsidering the parameters of nine debris disc systems derived previously, we\nmodel the discs in each of these bands. We find that the M band possesses the\nbest conditions to detect hot dust emission, closely followed by L and N bands.\nThe hot dust in three systems - HD 22484 (10 Tau), HD 102647 ($\\beta$ Leo) and\nHD 177724 ($\\zeta$ Aql) - shows a strong signal in the visibility functions\nwhich may even allow one to constrain the dust location. In particular,\nobservations in the mid-infrared could help to determine whether the dust piles\nup at the sublimation radius or is located at radii up to $1\\,\\text{au}$. In\naddition, we explore observations of the hot exozodiacal dust with the upcoming\nmid-infrared interferometer MATISSE at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer\n(VLTI).\n", "  We study the kinematic properties of the Eastern Banded Structure (EBS) and\nHydra I overdensity using exquisite proper motions derived from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Gaia source catalog. Main sequence turn-off stars\nin the vicinity of the EBS are identified from SDSS photometry; we use the\nproper motions and, where applicable, spectroscopic measurements of these stars\nto probe the kinematics of this apparent stream. We find that the EBS and Hydra\nI share common kinematic and chemical properties with the nearby Monoceros\nRing. In particular, the proper motions of the EBS, like Monoceros, are\nindicative of prograde rotation (V_phi ~ 180-220 km/s), which is similar to the\nGalactic thick disc. The kinematic structure of stars in the vicinity of the\nEBS suggest that it is not a distinct stellar stream, but rather marks the\n\"edge\" of the Monoceros Ring. The EBS and Hydra I are the latest substructures\nto be linked with Monoceros, leaving the Galactic anti-centre a mess of\ninterlinked overdensities which likely share a unified, Galactic disc origin.\n", "  We performed a multiwavelength study towards HII region Sh2-104. New maps of\n12CO J=1-0 and 13CO J=1-0 were obtained from the Purple Mountain Observatory\n(PMO) 13.7 m radio telescope. Sh2-104 displays a double-ring structure. The\nouter ring with a radius of 4.4 pc is dominated by 12 um, 500 um, 12CO J=1-0,\nand 13CO J=1-0 emission, while the inner ring with a radius of 2.9 pc is\ndominated by 22 um and 21 cm emission. We did not detect CO emission inside the\nouter ring. The north-east portion of the outer ring is blueshifted, while the\nsouth-west portion is redshifted. The present observations have provided\nevidence that the collected outer ring around Sh2-104 is a two-dimensional\nstructure. From the column density map constructed by the Hi-GAL survey data,\nwe extract 21 clumps. About 90\\% of all the clumps will form low-mass stars. A\npower-law fit to the clumps yields M=281Msun(r/pc)^1.31. The selected YSOs are\nassociated with the collected material on the edge of Sh2-104. The derived\ndynamical age of Sh2-104 is 1.6*10^6 yr. Compared the Sh2-104 dynamical age\nwith the YSOs timescale and the fragmentation time of the molecular ring, we\nfurther confirm that collect-and-collapse process operates in this region,\nindicating a positive feedback from a massive star for surrounding gas.\n", "  We present stellar-dynamical measurements of the central supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) in the S0 galaxy NGC 307, using adaptive-optics IFU data from\nVLT-SINFONI. We investigate the effects of including dark-matter haloes as well\nas multiple stellar components with different mass-to-light (M/L) ratios in the\ndynamical modeling. Models with no halo and a single stellar component yield a\nrelatively poor fit with a low value for the SMBH mass ($7.0 \\pm 1.0 \\times\n10^{7} M_{\\odot}$) and a high stellar M/L ratio (K-band M/L = $1.3 \\pm 0.1$).\nAdding a halo produces a much better fit, with a significantly larger SMBH mass\n($2.0 \\pm 0.5 \\times 10^{8} M_{\\odot}$) and a lower M/L ratio ($1.1 \\pm 0.1$).\nA model with no halo but with separate bulge and disc components produces a\nsimilarly good fit, with a slightly larger SMBH mass ($3.0 \\pm 0.5 \\times\n10^{8} M_{\\odot}$) and an identical M/L ratio for the bulge component, though\nthe disc M/L ratio is biased high (disc M/L $ = 1.9 \\pm 0.1$). Adding a halo to\nthe two-stellar-component model results in a much more plausible disc M/L ratio\nof $1.0 \\pm 0.1$, but has only a modest effect on the SMBH mass ($2.2 \\pm 0.6\n\\times 10^{8} M_{\\odot}$) and leaves the bulge M/L ratio unchanged. This\nsuggests that measuring SMBH masses in disc galaxies using just a single\nstellar component and no halo has the same drawbacks as it does for elliptical\ngalaxies, but also that reasonably accurate SMBH masses and bulge M/L ratios\ncan be recovered (without the added computational expense of modeling haloes)\nby using separate bulge and disc components.\n", "  Sensitive, imaging observations of the 1.1 mm dust continuum emission from a\n1 deg^2 area collected with the AzTEC bolometer camera on the Large Millimeter\nTelescope are presented. A catalog of 1545 compact sources is constructed based\non a Wiener-optimization filter. These sources are linked to larger clump\nstructures identified in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey. Hydrogen column\ndensities are calculated for all sources and mass and mean volume densities are\nderived for the subset of sources for which kinematic distances can be\nassigned. The AzTEC sources are localized, high density peaks within the\nmassive clumps of molecular clouds and comprise 5-15% of the clump mass. We\nexamine the role of the gravitational instability in generating these fragments\nby comparing the mass of embedded AzTEC sources to the Jeans' mass of the\nparent BGPS object. For sources with distances less than 6 kpc the fragment\nmasses are comparable to the clump Jeans' mass, despite having isothermal Mach\nnumbers between 1.6 and 7.2. AzTEC sources linked to ultra-compact HII regions\nhave mass surface densities greater than the critical value implied by the\nmass-size relationship of infrared dark clouds with high mass star formation\nwhile AzTEC sources associated with Class II methanol masers have mass surface\ndensities greater than 0.7 g cm^{-2} that approaches the proposed threshold\nrequired to form massive stars.\n", "  We present the results of deep optical imaging of the radio/$\\gamma$-ray\npulsar PSR J2043+2740, obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). With\na characteristic age of 1.2 Myr, PSR J2043+2740 is one of the oldest (non\nrecycled) pulsars detected in $\\gamma$-rays, although with still a quite high\nrotational energy reservoir ($\\dot{E}_{\\rm rot} = 5.6 \\times 10^{34}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$). The presumably close distance (a few hundred pc), suggested by the\nhydrogen column density ($N_{\\rm H} \\lesssim 3.6 \\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$),\nwould make it a viable target for deep optical observations, never attempted\nuntil now. We observed the pulsar with the Large Binocular Camera of the LBT.\nThe only object (V=25.44$\\pm$0.05) detected within ~3\" from the pulsar radio\ncoordinates is unrelated to it. PSR J2043+2740 is, thus, undetected down to\nV~26.6 (3-$\\sigma$), the deepest limit on its optical emission. We discuss the\nimplications of this result on the pulsar emission properties.\n", "  We analyze the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in the first Galactic quadrant from\nl=18deg to 40deg using radio recombination line (RRL) data from the Green Bank\nTelescope. These data allow us to distinguish DIG emission from HII region\nemission and thus study the diffuse gas essentially unaffected by confusion\nfrom discrete sources. We find that the DIG has two dominant velocity\ncomponents, one centered around 100km/s associated with the luminous HII region\nW43, and the other centered around 45km/s not associated with any large HII\nregion. Our analysis suggests that the two velocity components near W43 may be\ncaused by non-circular streaming motions originating near the end of the\nGalactic bar. At lower Galactic longitudes, the two velocities may instead\narise from gas at two distinct distances from the Sun, with the most likely\ndistances being ~6kpc for the 100km/s component and ~12kpc for the 45km/s\ncomponent. We show that the intensity of diffuse Spitzer GLIMPSE 8.0um emission\ncaused by excitation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is correlated with\nboth the locations of discrete HII regions and the intensity of the RRL\nemission from the DIG. This implies that the soft ultra-violet photons\nresponsible for creating the infrared emission have a similar origin as the\nharder ultra-violet photons required for the RRL emission. The 8.0um emission\nincreases with RRL intensity but flattens out for directions with the most\nintense RRL emission, suggesting that PAHs are partially destroyed by the\nenergetic radiation field at these locations.\n", "  Two blue-straggler sequences discovered in globular cluster M30 provide a\nstrong constraint on the formation mechanisms of blue stragglers. We study the\nformation of the blue-straggler binaries through binary evolution, and find\nthat binary evolution can contribute to the blue stragglers in both of the\nsequences. Whether a blue straggler is located in the blue sequence or red\nsequence depends on the contribution of the mass donor to the total luminosity\nof the binary, which is generally observed as a single star in globular\nclusters. The blue stragglers in the blue sequence have a cool white-dwarf\ncompanion, while the majority ($\\sim 60\\%$) of the objects in the red sequence\nare the binaries that are still experiencing mass transfer, but there are also\nsome objects that the donors have just finished the mass transfer (the\nstripped-core stars, $\\sim 10\\%$) or the blue stragglers (the accretors) have\nevolved away from the blue sequence ($\\sim 30\\%$). Meanwhile, W UMa contact\nbinaries found in both sequences may be explained by various mass ratios, that\nis, W UMa contact binaries in the red sequence have two components with\ncomparable masses (e.g. mass ratio $q\\sim$ 0.3-1.0), while those in the blue\nsequence have low mass ratio (e.g. $q<$ 0.3). However, the fraction of blue\nsequence in M30 cannot be reproduced by binary population synthesis if we\nassumed the initial parameters of a binary sample to be the same as that of the\nfield. This possible indicates that dynamical effects on binary systems is very\nimportant in globular clusters.\n", "  We present a survey of 56 massive star-forming regions in the 44 GHz methanol\nmaser transition made with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA); 24 of the\n56 fields showed maser emission. The data allow us to demonstrate associations,\nat arcsecond precision, of the Class I maser emission with outflows, HII\nregions, and shocks traced by 4.5 micron emission. We find a total of 83 maser\ncomponents with linewidths ranging from 0.17 to 3.3 km s$^{-1}$ with a nearly\nflat distribution and a median value of 1.1 km s$^{-1}$. The relative\nvelocities of the masers with respect to the systemic velocity of the host\nclouds range from $-$2.5 to 3.1 km s$^{-1}$ with a distribution peaking near\nzero. We also study the correlation between the masers and the so-called\nextended green objects (EGOs) from the GLIMPSE survey. Multiple sources in each\nfield are revealed from IR images as well as from centimeter continuum emission\nfrom VLA archival data; in the majority of cases the 44 GHz masers are\npositionally correlated with EGOs which seem to trace the younger sources in\nthe fields. We report a possible instance of a 44 GHz maser associated with a\nlow-mass protostar. If confirmed, this region will be the fifth known\nstar-forming region that hosts Class I masers associated with low-mass\nprotostars. We discuss three plausible cases of maser variability.\n", "  We present the result of microlensing event MOA-2016-BLG-290, which received\nobservations from the two-wheel Kepler (K2), Spitzer, as well as ground-based\nobservatories. A joint analysis of data from K2 and the ground leads to two\ndegenerate solutions of the lens mass and distance. This degeneracy is\neffectively broken once the (partial) Spitzer light curve is included.\nAltogether, the lens is found to be an extremely low-mass star located in the\nGalactic bulge. MOA-2016-BLG-290 is the first microlensing event for which we\nhave signals from three well-separated ($\\sim1$ AU) locations. It demonstrates\nthe power of two-satellite microlensing experiment in reducing the ambiguity of\nlens properties, as pointed out independently by S. Refsdal and A. Gould\nseveral decades ago.\n", "  We present a detailed investigation of the Doppler shift oscillations in a\nhot loop during an M7.1 flare on 2014 October 27 observed by the Interface\nRegion Imaging Spectrograph. The periodic oscillations are observed in the\nDoppler shift of Fe XXI 1354.09 A (logT~7.05), and the dominant period is about\n3.1 minutes. However, such 3.1-min oscillations are not found in the\nline-integrated intensity of Fe XXI 1354.09 A, AIA EUV fluxes, or microwave\nemissions. SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT imaging observations indicate that the\nDoppler shift oscillations locate at the hot loop-top region (> 11MK).\nMoreover, the differential emission measure (DEM) results show that the\ntemperature is increasing rapidly when the Doppler shift oscillates, but the\nnumber density does not exhibit the corresponding increases nor oscillations,\nimplying that the flare loop is likely to oscillate in an incompressible mode.\nAll these facts suggest that the Doppler shift oscillations at the shorter\nperiod are most likely the standing kink oscillations in a flare loop.\nMeanwhile, a longer period of about 10 minutes is identified in the time series\nof Doppler shift and line-integrated intensity, GOES SXR fluxes and AIA EUV\nlight curves, indicating the periodic energy release in this flare, which may\nbe caused by a slow mode wave.\n", "  Nearby, active stars with relatively rapid rotation and large starspot\nstructures offer the opportunity to compare interferometric, spectroscopic, and\nphotometric imaging techniques. In this paper, we image a spotted star with\nthree different methods for the first time. The giant primary star of the RS\nCanum Venaticorum binary $\\sigma$ Geminorum ($\\sigma$ Gem) was imaged for two\nepochs of interferometric, high-resolution spectroscopic, and photometric\nobservations. The light curves from the reconstructions show good agreement\nwith the observed light curves, supported by the longitudinally-consistent spot\nfeatures on the different maps. However, there is strong disagreement in the\nspot latitudes across the methods.\n", "  The recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a experiences annual eruptions, contains a\nnear-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf, and has the largest mass accretion rate in\nany nova system. In this paper, we present Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nWFC3/UVIS photometry of the late decline of the 2015 eruption. We couple these\nnew data with archival HST observations of the quiescent system and Keck\nspectroscopy of the 2014 eruption. The late-time photometry reveals a rapid\ndecline to a minimum luminosity state, before a possible recovery /\nre-brightening in the run-up to the next eruption. Comparison with accretion\ndisk models supports the survival of the accretion disk during the eruptions,\nand uncovers a quiescent disk mass accretion rate of the order of\n$10^{-6}\\,M_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which may rise beyond\n$10^{-5}\\,M_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ during the super-soft source phase - both\nof which could be problematic for a number of well-established nova eruption\nmodels. Such large accretion rates, close to the Eddington limit, might be\nexpected to be accompanied by additional mass loss from the disk through a wind\nand even collimated outflows. The archival HST observations, combined with the\ndisk modeling, provide the first constraints on the mass donor;\n$L_\\mathrm{donor}=103^{+12}_{-11}\\,L_\\odot$,\n$R_\\mathrm{donor}=14.14^{+0.46}_{-0.47}\\,R_\\odot$, and $T_\\mathrm{eff,\ndonor}=4890\\pm110$ K, which may be consistent with an irradiated M31 red-clump\nstar. Such a donor would require a system orbital period $\\gtrsim5$ days. Our\nupdated analysis predicts that the M31N 2008-12a WD could reach the\nChandrasekhar mass in < 20 kyr.\n", "  We report the detection of widespread CH$_2$OHCHO and HOCH$_2$CH$_2$OH\nemission in Galactic center giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2 using the\nShanghai Tianma 65m Radio Telescope. Our observations show for the first time\nthat the spatial distribution of these two important prebiotic molecules\nextends over 15 arc-minutes, corresponding to a linear size of approximately 36\npc. These two molecules are not just distributed in or near the hot cores. The\nabundance of these two molecules seems to decrease from the cold outer region\nto the central region associated with star-formation activity. Results present\nhere suggest that these two molecules are likely to form through a low\ntemperature process. Recent theoretical and experimental studies demonstrated\nthat prebiotic molecules can be efficiently formed in icy grain mantles through\nseveral pathways. However, these complex ice features cannot be directly\nobserved, and most constraints on the ice compositions come from millimeter\nobservations of desorbed ice chemistry products. These results, combined with\nlaboratory studies, strongly support the existence of abundant prebiotic\nmolecules in ices.\n", "  We examine the propagation and interaction properties of three successive\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs) from 2001 November 21-22, with a focus on their\nconnection with the behaviors of the associated long-duration complex type II\nradio burst. In combination with coronagraph and multi-point in situ\nobservations, the long-duration type II burst provides key features for\nresolving the propagation and interaction complexities of the three CMEs. The\ntwo CMEs from November 22 interacted first and then overtook the November 21\nCME at a distance of about 0.85 AU from the Sun. The time scale for the shock\noriginally driven by the last CME to propagate through the preceding two CMEs\nis estimated to be about 14 and 6 hr, respectively. We present a simple\nanalytical model without any free parameters to characterize the whole\nSun-to-Earth propagation of the shock, which shows a remarkable consistency\nwith all the available data and MHD simulations even out to the distance of\nUlysses (2.34 AU). The coordination of in situ measurements at the Earth and\nUlysses, which were separated by about $71.4^{\\circ}$ in latitude, gives\nimportant clues for the understanding of shock structure and the interpretation\nof in situ signatures. The results also indicate means to increase\ngeo-effectiveness with multiple CMEs, which can be considered as another\nmanifestation of the \"perfect storm\" scenario proposed by [liu14a] although the\ncurrent case is not \"super\" in the same sense as the 2012 July 23 event.\n", "  The occurrence of the low-lying charge-exchange non spin-flip dipole modes\nbelow the giant resonance in neutron-rich nuclei is predicted on the basis of\nnuclear density functional theory. The ground and excited states are described\nin the framework of the self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and the\nproton-neutron quasiparticle-random-phase approximation employing a Skyrme-type\nenergy density functional. The model calculations are performed for the\nspherical neutron-rich Ca, Ni, and Sn isotopes. It is found that the low-lying\nstates appear sensitively to the shell structure associated with the $-1 \\hbar\n\\omega_0$ excitation below the Gamow-Teller states. Furthermore, the pygmy\nresonance emerges below the giant resonance when the neutrons occupy the\nlow-$\\ell (\\ell \\leq 2 -3)$ orbitals analogous to the pygmy resonance seen in\nthe electric dipole response.\n", "  We compute the gravitational effective action by integrating out quantum\nmatter fields in a weak gravitational field, using the Schwinger-Keldysh\n(in-in) formalism. We pay particular attention to the role of the initial\nquantum state in the structure of the nonlocal terms in the effective action,\nwith an eye to nonlinear completions of the theory that may be relevant in\nastrophysics and cosmology. In this first paper we consider a quantum scalar\nfield in thermal equilibrium, in a stationary gravitational field. We obtain a\ncovariant expression for the nonlocal effective action, that can be expressed\nin terms of the curvature tensor, the four-velocity of the thermal bath and the\nlocal Tolman temperature. We discuss the connection between the results for\nultrastatic and static metrics through conformal transformations, and the main\nfeatures of the thermal corrections to the semiclassical Einstein equations.\n", "  The maximum efficiency for photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric generator\n(TEG) systems without concentration is investigated. Both a combined system\nwhere the TEG is mounted directly on the back of the PV and a tandem system\nwhere the incoming sunlight is split, and the short wavelength radiation is\nsent to the PV and the long wavelength to the TEG, are considered. An\nanalytical model based on the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit for PVs and\nthe TEG figure of merit parameter $zT$ is presented. It is shown that for\nnon-concentrated sunlight, even if the TEG operates at the Carnot efficiency\nand the PV performance is assumed independent of temperature, the maximum\nincrease in efficiency is 4.5 percentage points (pp.) for the combined case and\n1.8 pp. for the tandem case compared to a stand alone PV. For a more realistic\ncase with a temperature dependent PV and a realistic TEG, the gain in\nperformance is much lower. For the combined PV and TEG system it is shown that\na minimum $zT$ value is needed in order for the system to be more efficient\nthan a stand alone PV system.\n", "  Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) are the most powerful relativistic jets\nseen from supermassive black holes (BHs) accreting via a radiatively efficient\nthin disc. Their high energy emission is well modelled by highly relativistic\nelectrons in the jet Compton upscattering an external source of seed photons,\nprimarily from the broad line region. Strong Doppler boosting by the jet bulk\nmotion makes these FSRQs readily detectable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope.\nWe combine jet spectral models with scaling relations for the jet physical\nparameters as a function of mass and accretion rate. This does not match well\nto the Gamma-ray loud Narrow Line Seyfert 1s, assuming their low BH masses are\nreliable, but is able to predict much of the spectral evolution observed along\nthe Blazar sequence. We use these models in conjunction with cosmological\nsimulations of efficiently accreting BH number densities, and find that they\noverpredict the observed number of FSRQs by 2 orders of magnitude if all of\nthese objects produce a FSRQ jet. We can better reproduce the observed numbers\nif jets are only produced by high spin BHs and BH spin is built from\nchaotically aligned accretion episodes so that high spin BHs are rare. However,\nthis does not reproduce the observed redshift and mass accretion rate\ndistributions of the FSRQs. This may indicate a redshift dependence in\naccretion mode, with sustained alignment accretion episodes being more\nprevalent at higher redshift, or that there is some other trigger for FSRQ\njets.\n", "  [Abridged] Typical disc galaxies forming in a LambdaCDM cosmology encounter a\nviolent environment, where they often experience mergers with massive\nsatellites. The fact that disc galaxies are ubiquitous in the local Universe\nsuggests that a quiescent history is not necessary for their formation. Modern\ncosmological simulations can now obtain relatively realistic populations of\ndisc galaxies, but it still remains to be clarified how discs manage to survive\nmassive mergers. Here we use a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations set in a LambdaCDM cosmology to elucidate the fate of discs\nencountering massive mergers. We extract a sample of approximately 100 disc\ngalaxies and follow the changes in their post-merger morphologies, as tracked\nby their disc-to-total ratios (D/T). We also examine the relations between\ntheir present-day morphology, assembly history and gas fractions. We find that\napproximately half of present-day disc galaxies underwent at least one merger\nwith a satellite of total mass exceeding the host system's stellar mass, a\nthird had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding 3 times the host's stellar\nmass, and approximately one-sixth had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding\n10 times of the host's stellar mass. These mergers lead to a sharp, but often\ntemporary, decrease in the D/T of the hosts, implying that discs are usually\ndisrupted but then quickly re-grow. To do so, high cold gas fractions are\nrequired post-merger, as well as a relatively quiescent recent history (over a\nfew Gyrs before z=0). Our results show that discs can form via diverse merger\npathways and that quiescent histories are not the dominant mode of disc\nformation.\n", "  We present the discovery of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is turning\noff and then on again in the z=0.06 galaxy SDSS J1354+1327. This episodic\nnuclear activity is the result of discrete accretion events, which could have\nbeen triggered by a past interaction with the companion galaxy that is\ncurrently located 12.5 kpc away. We originally targeted SDSS J1354+1327 because\nits Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum has narrow AGN emission lines that\nexhibit a velocity offset of 69 km s$^{-1}$ relative to systemic. To determine\nthe nature of the galaxy and its velocity-offset emission lines, we observed\nSDSS J1354+1327 with Chandra/ACIS, Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3,\nApache Point Observatory optical longslit spectroscopy, and Keck/OSIRIS\nintegral-field spectroscopy. We find a ~10 kpc cone of photoionized gas south\nof the galaxy center and a ~1 kpc semi-spherical front of shocked gas, which is\nresponsible for the velocity offset in the emission lines, north of the galaxy\ncenter. We interpret these two outflows as the result of two separate AGN\naccretion events; the first AGN outburst created the southern outflow, and then\n$<10^5$ yrs later the second AGN outburst launched the northern shock front.\nSDSS J1354+1327 is the galaxy with the strongest evidence for an AGN that has\nturned off and then on again, and it fits into the broader context of AGN\nflickering that includes observations of AGN light echoes.\n", "  We analyze the properties of a multiply-imaged Lyman-alpha (Lya) emitter at\nz=5.75 identified through SHARDS Frontier Fields intermediate-band imaging of\nthe Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) cluster Abell 370. The source, A370-L57, has\nlow intrinsic luminosity (M_UV~-16.5), steep UV spectral index\n(\\beta=-2.4+/-0.1), and extreme rest-frame equivalent width of Lya\n(EW(Lya)=420+180-120 \\AA). Two different gravitational lens models predict high\nmagnification (\\mu~10--16) for the two detected counter-images, separated by\n7\", while a predicted third counter-image (\\mu~3--4) is undetected. We find\ndifferences of ~50% in magnification between the two lens models, quantifying\nour current systematic uncertainties. Integral field spectroscopy of A370-L57\nwith MUSE shows a narrow (FWHM=204+/-10 km/s) and asymmetric Lya profile with\nan integrated luminosity L(Lya)~10^42 erg/s. The morphology in the HST bands\ncomprises a compact clump (r_e<100 pc) that dominates the Lya and continuum\nemission and several fainter clumps at projected distances <1 kpc that coincide\nwith an extension of the Lya emission in the SHARDS F823W17 and MUSE\nobservations. The latter could be part of the same galaxy or an interacting\ncompanion. We find no evidence of contribution from AGN to the Lya emission.\nFitting of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population models\nfavors a very young (t<10 Myr), low mass (M*~10^6.5 Msun), and metal poor\n(Z<4x10^-3) stellar population. Its modest star formation rate (SFR~1.0\nMsun/yr) implies high specific SFR (sSFR~2.5x10^-7 yr^-1) and SFR density\n(Sigma_SFR ~ 7-35 Msun/yr/kpc^2). The properties of A370-L57 make it a good\nrepresentative of the population of galaxies responsible for cosmic\nreionization.\n", "  We apply an analytic Markov Chain Monte Carlo model to a sample of 18\nAGN-driven biconical outflows that we identified from a sample of active\ngalaxies with double-peaked narrow emission lines at z < 0.1 in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. We find that 8/18 are best described as asymmetric bicones,\n8/18 are nested bicones, and 2/18 are symmetric bicones. From the geometry and\nkinematics of the models, we find that these moderate-luminosity AGN outflows\nare large and energetic. The biconical outflows axes are randomly oriented with\nrespect to the photometric major axis of the galaxy, implying a randomly\noriented and clumpier torus to collimate the outflow, but the torus also allows\nsome radiation to escape equatorially. We find that 16/18 (89%) outflows are\nenergetic enough to drive a two-staged feedback process in their host galaxies.\nAll of these outflows geometrically intersect the photometric major axis of the\ngalaxy, and 23% of outflow host galaxies are significantly redder or have\nsignificantly lower specific star formation rates when compared to a matched\nsample of active galaxies.\n", "  Star formation is a hierarchical process, forming young stellar structures of\nstar clusters, associations, and complexes over a wide scale range. The\nstar-forming complex in the bar region of the Large Magellanic Cloud is\ninvestigated with upper main-sequence stars observed by the VISTA Survey of the\nMagellanic Clouds. The upper main-sequence stars exhibit highly non-uniform\ndistributions. Young stellar structures inside the complex are identified from\nthe stellar density map as density enhancements of different significance\nlevels. We find that these structures are hierarchically organized such that\nlarger, lower-density structures contain one or several smaller, higher-density\nones. They follow power-law size and mass distributions as well as a lognormal\nsurface density distribution. All these results support a scenario of\nhierarchical star formation regulated by turbulence. The temporal evolution of\nyoung stellar structures is explored by using subsamples of upper main-sequence\nstars with different magnitude and age ranges. While the youngest subsample,\nwith a median age of log($\\tau$/yr)~=~7.2, contains most substructure,\nprogressively older ones are less and less substructured. The oldest subsample,\nwith a median age of log($\\tau$/yr)~=~8.0, is almost indistinguishable from a\nuniform distribution on spatial scales of 30--300~pc, suggesting that the young\nstellar structures are completely dispersed on a timescale of $\\sim$100~Myr.\nThese results are consistent with the characteristics of the 30~Doradus complex\nand the entire Large Magellanic Cloud, suggesting no significant environmental\neffects. We further point out that the fractal dimension may be\nmethod-dependent for stellar samples with significant age spreads.\n", "  We present a study of the average X-ray spectral properties of the sources\ndetected by the NuSTAR extragalactic survey, comprising observations of the\nE-CDFS, EGS and COSMOS fields. The sample includes 182 NuSTAR sources (64\ndetected at 8-24 keV), with 3-24 keV fluxes ranging between $f_{\\rm 3-24\nkeV}\\approx10^{-14}$ and $6\\times10^{-13}$ erg/cm$^2$/s ($f_{\\rm 8-24\nkeV}\\approx3\\times10^{-14}-3\\times10^{-13}$ erg/cm$^2$/s) and redshifts of\n$z=0.04-3.21$. We produce composite spectra from the Chandra+NuSTAR data\n($E\\approx2-40$ keV, rest frame) for all the sources with redshift\nidentifications (95%) and investigate the intrinsic, average spectra of the\nsources, divided into broad-line (BL) and narrow-line (NL) AGN, and also in\ndifferent bins of X-ray column density and luminosity. The average power-law\nphoton index for the whole sample is $\\Gamma=1.65_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$, flatter\nthan $\\Gamma\\approx1.8$ typically found for AGN. While the spectral slope of BL\nand X-ray unabsorbed AGN is consistent with typical values\n($\\Gamma=1.79_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$), a significant flattening is seen in NL AGN and\nheavily-absorbed sources ($\\Gamma=1.60_{-0.05}^{+0.08}$ and\n$\\Gamma=1.38_{-0.12}^{+0.12}$, respectively), likely due to the effect of\nabsorption and to the contribution from Compton reflection to the high-energy\nflux (E>10 keV). We find that the typical reflection fraction in our spectra is\n$R\\approx0.5$ (for $\\Gamma=1.8$), with a tentative indication of an increase of\nthe reflection strength with column density. While there is no significant\nevidence for a dependence of the photon index with X-ray luminosity in our\nsample, we find that $R$ decreases with luminosity, with relatively high levels\nof reflection ($R\\approx1.2$) for $L_{\\rm 10-40 keV}<10^{44}$ erg/s and\n$R\\approx0.3$ for $L_{\\rm 10-40 keV}>10^{44}$ erg/s AGN, assuming $\\Gamma=1.8$.\n", "  Quasars are galaxies hosting accreting supermassive black holes; due to their\nbrightness, they are unique probes of the early universe. To date, only few\nquasars have been reported at $z > 6.5$ ($<$800 Myr after the Big Bang). In\nthis work, we present six additional $z \\gtrsim 6.5$ quasars discovered using\nthe Pan-STARRS1 survey. We use a sample of 15 $z \\gtrsim 6.5$ quasars to\nperform a homogeneous and comprehensive analysis of this highest-redshift\nquasar population. We report four main results: (1) the majority of\n$z\\gtrsim$6.5 quasars show large blueshifts of the broad CIV\n1549\\AA$\\,$emission line compared to the systemic redshift of the quasars, with\na median value $\\sim$3$\\times$ higher than a quasar sample at $z\\sim$1; (2) we\nestimate the quasars' black hole masses (M$\\rm_{BH}\\sim$0.3$-$5 $\\times$\n10$^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$) via modeling of the MgII 2798\\AA$\\,$emission line and\nrest-frame UV continuum; we find that quasars at high redshift accrete their\nmaterial (with $\\langle (L_{\\mathrm{bol}}/L_{\\mathrm{Edd}}) \\rangle = 0.39$) at\na rate comparable to a luminosity-matched sample at lower$-$redshift, albeit\nwith significant scatter ($0.4$ dex); (3) we recover no evolution of the\nFeII/MgII abundance ratio with cosmic time; (4) we derive near zone sizes;\ntogether with measurements for $z\\sim6$ quasars from recent work, we confirm a\nshallow evolution of the decreasing quasar near zone sizes with redshift.\nFinally, we present new millimeter observations of the [CII] 158 $\\mu$m\nemission line and underlying dust continuum from NOEMA for four quasars, and\nprovide new accurate redshifts and [CII]/infrared luminosities estimates. The\nanalysis presented here shows the large range of properties of the most distant\nquasars.\n", "  RR Lyr stars are ideal massless tracers that can be used to study the total\nmass and dark matter content of the outer halo of the Milky Way. This is\nbecause they are easy to find in the light curve databases of large stellar\nsurveys and their distances can be determined with only knowledge of the light\ncurve. We present here a sample of 112 RR Lyr beyond 50 kpc in the outer halo\nof the Milky Way, excluding the Sgr streams, for which we have obtained\nmoderate resolution spectra with Deimos on the Keck 2 Telescope. Four of these\nhave distances exceeding 100 kpc. These were selected from a much larger set of\n447 candidate RR Lyr which were datamined using machine learning techniques\napplied to the light curves of variable stars in the Palomar Transient Facility\ndatabase. The observed radial velocities taken at the phase of the variable\ncorresponding to the time of observation were converted to systemic radial\nvelocities in the Galactic standard of rest. From our sample of 112 RR Lyr we\ndetermine the radial velocity dispersion in the outer halo of the Milky Way to\nbe ~90 km/s at 50 kpc falling to about 65 km/s near 100 kpc once a small number\nof major outliers are removed. With reasonable estimates of the completeness of\nour sample of 447 candidates and assuming a spherical halo, we find that the\nstellar density in the outer halo declines as the -4 power of r.\n", "  We study the effects of a truncated band structure on the linear and\nnonlinear optical response of crystals using four methods. These are\nconstructed by (i) choosing either length or velocity gauge for the\nperturbation and (ii) computing the current density either directly or via the\ntime-derivative of the polarization density. In the infinite band limit, the\nresults of all four methods are identical, but basis truncation breaks their\nequivalence. In particular, certain response functions vanish identically and\nunphysical low-frequency divergences are observed for few-band models in the\nvelocity gauge. Using hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayer as a case study,\nwe analyze the problems associated with all methods and identify the optimal\none. Our results show that the length gauge calculations provide the fastest\nconvergence rates as well as the most accurate spectra for any basis size and,\nmoreover, that low-frequency divergences are eliminated.\n", "  We present our statistical study of near infrared (NIR) variability of X-ray\nselected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the COSMOS field, using UltraVISTA\ndata. This is the largest sample of AGN light curves in YJHKs bands, making\npossible to have a global description of the nature of AGN for a large range of\nredshifts, and for different levels of obscuration. To characterize the\nvariability properties of the sources we computed the Structure Function. Our\nresults show that there is an anti-correlation between the Structure Function\n$A$ parameter (variability amplitude) and the wavelength of emission, and a\nweak anti-correlation between $A$ and the bolometric luminosity. We find that\nBroad Line (BL) AGN have a considerably larger fraction of variable sources\nthan Narrow Line (NL) AGN, and that they have different distributions of the\n$A$ parameter. We find evidence that suggests that most of the low luminosity\nvariable NL sources correspond to BL AGN, where the host galaxy could be\ndamping the variability signal. For high luminosity variable NL, we propose\nthat they can be examples of \"True type II\" AGN or BL AGN with limited spectral\ncoverage which results in missing the Broad Line emission. We also find that\nthe fraction of variable sources classified as unobscured in the X-ray is\nsmaller than the fraction of variable sources unobscured in the optical range.\nWe present evidence that this is related to the differences in the origin of\nthe obscuration in the optical and X-ray regimes.\n", "  Motivated by the observed differences in the nebular emission of nearby and\nhigh-redshift galaxies, we carry out a set of direct numerical simulations of\nturbulent astrophysical media exposed to a UV background. The simulations\nassume a metallicity of $Z/Z_{\\odot}$=0.5 and explicitly track ionization,\nrecombination, charge transfer, and ion-by-ion radiative cooling for several\nastrophysically important elements. Each model is run to a global steady state\nthat depends on the ionization parameter $U$, and the one-dimensional turbulent\nvelocity dispersion, $\\sigma_{\\rm 1D}$, and the turbulent driving scale. We\ncarry out a suite of models with a T=42,000K blackbody spectrum, $n_e$ = 100\ncm$^{-3}$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm 1D}$ ranging between 0.7 to 42 km s$^{-1},$\ncorresponding to turbulent Mach numbers varying between 0.05 and 2.6. We report\nour results as several nebular diagnostic diagrams and compare them to\nobservations of star-forming galaxies at a redshift of $z\\approx$2.5, whose\nhigher surface densities may also lead to more turbulent interstellar media. We\nfind that subsonic, transsonic turbulence, and turbulence driven on scales of 1\nparsec or greater, have little or no effect on the line ratios. Supersonic,\nsmall-scale turbulence, on the other hand, generally increases the computed\nline emission. In fact with a driving scale $\\approx 0.1$ pc, a moderate amount\nof turbulence, $\\sigma_{\\rm 1D}$=21-28 km s$^{-1},$ can reproduce many of the\ndifferences between high and low redshift observations without resorting to\nharder spectral shapes.\n", "  The globular cluster systems of galaxies are well-known to extend to large\ngalactocentric radii. Here we quantify the size of GC systems using the half\nnumber radius of 22 GC systems around early-type galaxies from the literature.\nWe compare GC system sizes to the sizes and masses of their host galaxies. We\nfind that GC systems typically extend to 4$\\times$ that of the host galaxy\nsize, however this factor varies with galaxy stellar mass from about 3$\\times$\nfor M$^{\\ast}$ galaxies to 5$\\times$ for the most massive galaxies in the\nuniverse. The size of a GC system scales approximately linearly with the virial\nradius (R$_{200}$) and with the halo mass (M$_{200}$) to the 1/3 power. The GC\nsystem of the Milky Way follows the same relations as for early-type galaxies.\nFor Ultra Diffuse Galaxies their GC system size scales with halo mass and\nvirial radius as for more massive, larger galaxies. UDGs indicate that the\nlinear scaling of GC system size with stellar mass for massive galaxies\nflattens out for low stellar mass galaxies. Our scalings are different to those\nreported recently by Hudson \\& Robison (2017).\n", "  Sun-like and low-mass stars possess high temperature coronae and lose mass in\nthe form of stellar winds, driven by thermal pressure and complex\nmagnetohydrodynamic processes. These magnetized outflows probably do not\nsignificantly affect the star's structural evolution on the Main Sequence, but\nthey brake the stellar rotation by removing angular momentum, a mechanism known\nas magnetic braking. Previous studies have shown how the braking torque depends\non magnetic field strength and geometry, stellar mass and radius, mass-loss\nrate, and the rotation rate of the star, assuming a fixed coronal temperature.\nFor this study we explore how different coronal temperatures can influence the\nstellar torque. We employ 2.5D, axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamic simulations,\ncomputed with the PLUTO code, to obtain steady-state wind solutions from\nrotating stars with dipolar magnetic fields. Our parameter study includes 30\nsimulations with variations in coronal temperature and surface-magnetic-field\nstrength. We consider a Parker-like (i.e. thermal-pressure-driven) wind, and\ntherefore coronal temperature is the key parameter determining the velocity and\nacceleration profile of the flow. Since the mass loss rates for these types of\nstars are not well constrained, we determine how torque scales for a vast range\nof stellar mass loss rates. Hotter winds lead to a faster acceleration, and we\nshow that (for a given magnetic field strength and mass-loss rate) a hotter\noutflow leads to a weaker torque on the star. We derive new predictive torque\nformulae for each temperature, which quantifies this effect over a range of\npossible wind acceleration profiles.\n", "  We wish to constrain the possible contribution of a magnetohydrodynamic disk\nwind (DW) to the HH212 molecular jet. We mapped the flow base with ALMA Cycle 4\nat 0.13\"$\\sim$ 60 au resolution and compared these observations with synthetic\nDW predictions. We identified, in SO/SO$_2$, a rotating flow that is wider and\nslower than the axial SiO jet. The broad outflow cavity seen in C$^{34}$S is\nnot carved by a fast wide-angle wind but by this slower agent. Rotation\nsignatures may be fitted by a DW of a moderate lever arm launched out to $\\sim$\n40 au with SiO tracing dust-free streamlines from 0.05-0.3 au. Such a DW could\nlimit the core-to-star efficiency to $\\leq$50%.\n", "  We present an 8 pc x 5 pc resolution view of the central ~ 200 pc region of\nthe nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253, based on ALMA Band 7 ({\\lambda} ~ 0.85 mm\nor {\\nu} ~ 350 GHz) observations covering 11 GHz. We resolve the nuclear\nstarburst of NGC 253 into eight dusty star-forming clumps, 10 pc in scale, for\nthe first time. These clumps, each of which contains (4-10) x 10^4 M_sun of\ndust (assuming that the dust temperature is 25 K) and up to 6 x 10^2 massive\n(O5V) stars, appear to be aligned in two parallel ridges, while they have been\nblended in previous studies. Despite the similarities in sizes and dust masses\nof these clumps, their line spectra vary drastically from clump to clump\nalthough they are separated by only ~ 10 pc. Specifically, one of the clumps,\nClump 1, exhibits line confusion-limited spectra with at least 36 emission\nlines from 19 molecules (including CH3OH, HNCO, H2CO, CH3CCH, H2CS, and H3O+)\nand a hydrogen recombination line (H26{\\alpha}), while much fewer kinds of\nmolecular lines are detected in some other clumps where fragile species, such\nas complex organic molecules and HNCO, completely disappear from their spectra.\nWe demonstrate the existence of hot molecular gas ($T_rot (SO2) = 90 {\\pm} 11\nK) in the former clump, which suggests that the hot and chemically rich\nenvironments are localized within a 10-pc scale star-forming clump.\n", "  The neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are usually thought to\nbe weakly magnetized objects accreting matter from their low-mass companions in\nthe form of a disk. Albeit weak as compared to those in young neutron-star\nsystems, the neutron-star magnetospheres in LMXBs can play an important role in\ndetermining the correlations between spectral and temporal properties. Parallel\ntracks appearing in the plane of kilohertz (kHz) quasi-periodic oscillation\n(QPO) frequency versus X-ray flux can be used as a tool to study the\nmagnetosphere-disk interaction in neutron-star LMXBs. For dynamically important\nweak fields, the formation of a non-Keplerian magnetic boundary layer at the\ninnermost disk truncated near the surface of the neutron star is highly likely.\nSuch a boundary region may harbor oscillatory modes of frequencies in the kHz\nrange. We generate parallel tracks using the boundary region model of kHz QPOs.\nWe also present the direct application of our model to the reproduction of the\nobserved parallel tracks of individual sources such as 4U 1608--52, 4U\n1636--53, and Aql X-1. We reveal how the radial width of the boundary layer\nmust vary in the long-term flux evolution of each source to regenerate the\nparallel tracks. The run of the radial width looks similar for different\nsources and can be fitted by a generic model function describing the average\nsteady behavior of the boundary region in the long term. The parallel tracks\nthen correspond to the possible quasi-steady states the source can occupy\naround the average trend.\n", "  The study of d+d reactions is of major interest since their reaction rates\naffect the predicted abundances of D, 3He, and 7Li. In particular, recent\nmeasurements of primordial D/H ratios call for reduced uncertainties in the\ntheoretical abundances predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Different\nauthors have studied reactions involved in BBN by incorporating new\nexperimental data and a careful treatment of systematic and probabilistic\nuncertainties. To analyze the experimental data, Coc et al. (2015) used results\nof ab initio models for the theoretical calculation of the energy dependence of\nS-factors in conjunction with traditional statistical methods based on Chi-2\nminimization. Bayesian methods have now spread to many scientific fields and\nprovide numerous advantages in data analysis. Astrophysical S-factors and\nreaction rates using Bayesian statistics were calculated by Iliadis et al.\n(2016). Here we present a similar analysis for two d+d reactions, d(d,n)3He and\nd(d,p)3H, that has been translated into a total decrease of the predicted D/H\nvalue by 0.16%.\n", "  The young cluster NGC 6231 (stellar ages ~2-7 Myr) is observed shortly after\nstar-formation activity has ceased. Using the catalog of 2148 probable cluster\nmembers obtained from Chandra, VVV, and optical surveys (Paper I), we examine\nthe cluster's spatial structure and dynamical state. The spatial distribution\nof stars is remarkably well fit by an isothermal sphere with moderate\nelongation, while other commonly used models like Plummer spheres, multivariate\nnormal distributions, or power-law models are poor fits. The cluster has a core\nradius of $1.2\\pm0.1$ pc and a central density of ~200 stars pc$^{-3}$. The\ndistribution of stars is mildly mass segregated. However, there is no radial\nstratification of the stars by age. Although most of the stars belong to a\nsingle cluster, a small subcluster of stars is found superimposed on the main\ncluster, and there are clumpy non-isotropic distributions of stars outside ~4\ncore radii. When the size, mass, and age of NGC 6231 are compared to other\nyoung star clusters and subclusters in nearby active star-forming regions, it\nlies at the high-mass end of the distribution but along the same trend line.\nThis could result from similar formation processes, possibly hierarchical\ncluster assembly. We argue that NGC 6231 has expanded from its initial size but\nthat it remains gravitationally bound.\n", "  ALMA imaging of the cold molecular medium in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC\n1808 is presented. The observations reveal the distribution of molecular gas,\ntraced by $^{12}$CO (1-0) and $^{12}$CO (3-2), and continuum (93 and 350 GHz)\nacross the central 1 kpc starburst region at high resolution of $\\sim1$ arcsec.\nA molecular gas torus (radius $\\sim30$ pc) is discovered in the circumnuclear\ndisk (CND; central 100 pc), with a high CO (3-2)/CO (1-0) ratio of $\\sim1$,\nsurrounded by massive ($10^6$-$10^7$ $M_\\odot$) clouds with high star formation\nefficiency (SFE$\\sim10^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$), molecular spiral arms, and a 500 pc\npseudoring. The CND harbors a continuum core and molecular gas exhibiting\npeculiar motion. The new data confirm the line splitting along the minor\ngalactic axis, interpreted as a nuclear gas outflow with average velocity\n$\\sim180$ km s$^{-1}$, and show evidence of a velocity gradient of $\\sim+0.4$\nkm s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ along the axis. In addition, supershells expanding from\nthe 500 pc ring with maximum velocities of $\\sim75$ km s$^{-1}$ are revealed.\nThe distribution and CO luminosities of molecular clouds in the central 1 kpc\nstarburst region indicate an evolutionary sequence, from gas accretion onto the\n500 pc ring from the large-scale bar, to enhanced star formation in the ring,\nand outflow as feedback.\n", "  We report hints for the correlation between the X-ray and gamma-ray emission\nin the nearby galaxy NGC 4945, which harbors both an active galactic nucleus\nand a nuclear starburst region. We have divided the Fermi/LAT observations of\nNGC 4945 into two datasets, comprising events detected during the low (L) and\nhigh (H) level of X-ray emission from the active nucleus of this galaxy,\ndetermined using the Swift/BAT light curve. Both datasets contain an equal\namount of 3.8 years of LAT data and NGC 4945 is detected with a similar\nstatistical significance of ~15 $\\sigma$ in L and 14 $\\sigma$ in H. However,\nthe slope of the gamma-ray spectrum hardens with the increase of the X-ray\nflux, with the photon index $\\Gamma$ = 2.47 +/- 0.07 in L and 2.11 +/- 0.08 in\nH. The change is confirmed by a systematic variation of the spectral energy\ndistribution as well as a substantial reversal of the gamma-ray signal in\nsignificance maps for low and high gamma-ray energies. The X/gamma-ray\ncorrelation indicates that the gamma-ray production is dominated by the active\nnucleus rather than by cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. We\ndiscuss possible locations of the gamma-ray source. We also compare NGC 4945\nwith other starburst galaxies detected by LAT and we note similarities between\nthose with active nuclei, e.g. unlikely high efficiencies of gamma-ray\nproduction in starburst scenario, which argues for a significant contribution\nof their active nuclei to the gamma-ray emission.\n", "  Using the superfield formalism, we propose a non-local extension of the\nsupersymmetric gauge theory coupled to massless chiral matter. Two different\nnon-local models are considered. For these models, we explicitly calculate the\none-loop K\\\"{a}lerian effective potential.\n", "  We present in this work the development of a solar data assimilation method\nbased on an axisymmetric mean field dynamo model and magnetic surface data, our\nmid-term goal is to predict the solar quasi cyclic activity. Here we focus on\nthe ability of our algorithm to constrain the deep meridional circulation of\nthe Sun based on solar magnetic observations. To that end, we develop a\nvariational data assimilation technique. Within a given assimilation window,\nthe assimilation procedure minimizes the differences between data and the\nforecast from the model, by finding an optimal meridional circulation in the\nconvection zone, and an optimal initial magnetic field, via a quasi-Newton\nalgorithm. We demonstrate the capability of the technique to estimate the\nmeridional flow by a closed-loop experiment involving 40 years of synthetic,\nsolar-like data. By assimilating the synthetic magnetic proxies annually, we\nare able to reconstruct a (stochastic) time-varying meridional circulation\nwhich is also slightly equatorially asymmetric. We show that the method is\nrobust in estimating a flow whose level of fluctuation can reach 30% about the\naverage, and that the horizon of predictive capability of the method is of the\norder of 1 cycle length.\n", "  The extended hot X-ray emitting gaseous halo of the Milky Way has an optical\ndepth $\\sim1$ for the dominant emission lines of \\ion{O}{7} and \\ion{O}{8},\nwhich are used to infer the halo properties. To improve on halo gas properties,\nwe treat optical depth effects with a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer model,\nwhich leads to slightly steeper density profiles ($\\beta \\approx 0.5$) than if\noptical depths effects were ignored. For the preferred model where the halo is\nrotating on cylinders at $180$ km s$^{-1}$, independent fits to both lines lead\nto identical results, where the core radius is $2.5$ kpc and the turbulent\ncomponent of the Doppler b parameter is $100-120$ km s$^{-1}$; the turbulent\npressure is $20\\%$ of the thermal pressure. The fit is improved when emission\nfrom a disk is included, with a radial scale length of $3$ kpc (assumed) and a\nfitted vertical scale height of approximately $1.3$ kpc. The disk component is\na minor mass constituent and has low optical depth, except at low latitudes.\nThe gaseous mass is $3-4\\times10^{10}\\,M_{\\odot}$ within $250\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$,\nsimilar to our previous determinations and significantly less than the missing\nbaryons of $1.7\\times10^{11}\\,M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  Active Region (AR) 12192 is the biggest AR observed in solar cycle 24 so far.\nThis was a long-lived AR which survived for four Carrington rotations (CR) and\nexhibited several unusual phenomena. We measure the horizontal subsurface flows\nin this active region in multiple rotation using the ring-diagram technique of\nlocal helioseismology and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG+)\nDopplergrams, and investigate how different was the plasma flow in AR 12192\nfrom that in AR 10486. Both regions produced several high M- and X-class flares\nbut had different CME productivity. Our analysis suggests that these ARs had\nunusually large horizontal flow amplitude with distinctly different directions.\nWhile meridional flow in AR 12192 was poleward that supports the flux transport\nto poles, it was equatorward in AR 10486. Furthermore, there was a sudden\nincrease in the magnitude of estimated zonal flow in shallow layers in AR 12192\nduring the X3.1 flare, however, it reversed direction in AR 10486 with X17.2\nflare. These flow patterns produced strong twists in horizontal velocity with\ndepth in AR 10486 that persisted throughout the disk passage as opposed to AR\n12192, which produced a twist only after the eruption of the X3.1 flare that\ndisappeared soon after. Our study indicates that the sunspot rotation combined\nwith the re-organization of magnetic field in AR 10486 was not sufficient to\ndecrease the flow energy even after several large flares that might have\ntriggered CMEs. Furthermore, in the absence of sunspot rotation in AR 12192,\nthis re-organization of magnetic field contributed significantly to the\nsubstantial release of flow energy after the X3.1 flare.\n", "  The physical processes driving the chemical evolution of galaxies in the last\n$\\sim 11\\, \\rm{Gyr}$ cannot be understood without directly probing the\ndust-obscured phase of star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. This\nphase, hidden to optical tracers, represents the bulk of star formation and\nblack hole accretion activity in galaxies at $1 < z < 3$. Spectroscopic\nobservations with a cryogenic infrared (IR) observatory like SPICA will be\nsensitive enough to peer through the dust-obscured regions of galaxies and\naccess the rest-frame mid- to far-IR range in galaxies at high-$z$. This\nwavelength range contains a unique suite of spectral lines and dust features\nthat serve as proxies for the abundances of heavy elements and the dust\ncomposition, providing tracers with a feeble response to both extinction and\ntemperature. In this work, we investigate how SPICA observations could be\nexploited to understand key aspects in the chemical evolution of galaxies: the\nassembly of nearby galaxies based on the spatial distribution of heavy element\nabundances, the global content of metals in galaxies reaching the knee of the\nluminosity function up to $z \\sim 3$, and the dust composition of galaxies at\nhigh-$z$. Possible synergies with facilities available in the late 2020s are\nalso discussed.\n", "  The strong, nearly wavelength-independent absorption cross section of\naerosols produces featureless exoplanet transmission spectra, limiting our\nability to characterize their atmospheres. Here we show that even in the\npresence of featureless spectra, we can still characterize certain atmospheric\nproperties. Specifically, we constrain the upper and lower pressure boundaries\nof aerosol layers, and present plausible composition candidates. We study the\ncase of the bloated Saturn-mass planet WASP-49b, where near-infrared\nobservations reveal a flat transmission spectrum between 0.7 and 1.0\n{\\microns}. First, we use a hydrodynamic upper-atmosphere code to estimate the\npressure reached by the ionizing stellar high-energy photons at $10^{-8}$ bar,\nsetting the upper pressure boundary where aerosols could exist. Then, we\ncombine HELIOS and Pyrat Bay radiative-transfer models to constrain the\ntemperature and photospheric pressure of atmospheric aerosols, in a Bayesian\nframework. For WASP-49b, we constrain the transmission photosphere (hence, the\naerosol deck boundaries) to pressures above $10^{-5}$ bar (100$\\times$ solar\nmetallicity), $10^{-4}$ bar (solar), and $10^{-3}$ bar (0.1$\\times$ solar) as\nlower boundary, and below $10^{-7}$ bar as upper boundary. Lastly, we compare\ncondensation curves of aerosol compounds with the planet's pressure-temperature\nprofile to identify plausible condensates responsible for the absorption. Under\nthese circumstances, we find as candidates: Na$_{2}$S (at 100$\\times$ solar\nmetallicity); Cr and MnS (at solar and 0.1$\\times$ solar); and forsterite,\nenstatite, and alabandite (at 0.1$\\times$ solar).\n", "  Atom interferometers employing optical cavities to enhance the beam splitter\npulses promise significant advances in science and technology, notably for\nfuture gravitational wave detectors. Long cavities, on the scale of hundreds of\nmeters, have been proposed in experiments aiming to observe gravitational waves\nwith frequencies below 1 Hz, where laser interferometers, such as LIGO, have\npoor sensitivity. Alternatively, short cavities have also been proposed for\nenhancing the sensitivity of more portable atom interferometers. We explore the\nfundamental limitations of two-mirror cavities for atomic beam splitting, and\nestablish upper bounds on the temperature of the atomic ensemble as a function\nof cavity length and three design parameters: the cavity g-factor, the\nbandwidth, and the optical suppression factor of the first and second order\nspatial modes. A lower bound to the cavity bandwidth is found which avoids\nelongation of the interaction time and maximizes power enhancement. An upper\nlimit to cavity length is found for symmetric two-mirror cavities, restricting\nthe practicality of long baseline detectors. For shorter cavities, an upper\nlimit on the beam size was derived from the geometrical stability of the\ncavity. These findings aim to aid the design of current and future\ncavity-assisted atom interferometers.\n", "  We present multi-epoch VLT/SPHERE observations of the protoplanetary disk\naround HD 135344B (SAO 206462). The $J$-band scattered light imagery reveal,\nwith high spatial resolution ($\\sim$41 mas, 6.4 au), the disk surface beyond\n$\\sim$20 au. Temporal variations are identified in the azimuthal brightness\ndistributions of all epochs, presumably related to the asymmetrically shading\ndust distribution in the inner disk. These shadows manifest themselves as\nnarrow lanes, cast by localized density enhancements, and broader features\nwhich possibly trace the larger scale dynamics of the inner disk. We acquired\nvisible and near-infrared photometry which shows variations up to 10% in the\n$JHK$ bands, possibly correlated with the presence of the shadows. Analysis of\narchival VLTI/PIONIER $H$-band visibilities constrain the orientation of the\ninner disk to $i = 18.2\\deg^{+3.4}_{-4.1}$ and ${\\rm PA} = 57.3\\deg \\pm\n5.7\\deg$, consistent with an alignment with the outer disk or a minor disk warp\nof several degrees. The latter scenario could explain the broad,\nquasi-stationary shadowing in N-NW direction in case the inclination of the\nouter disk is slightly larger. The correlation between the shadowing and the\nnear-infrared excess is quantified with a grid of radiative transfer models.\nThe variability of the scattered light contrast requires extended variations in\nthe inner disk atmosphere ($H/r \\lesssim 0.2$). Possible mechanisms that may\ncause asymmetric variations in the optical depth ($\\Delta\\tau\\lesssim1$)\nthrough the atmosphere of the inner disk include turbulent fluctuations,\nplanetesimal collisions, or a dusty disk wind, possibly enhanced by a minor\ndisk warp. A fine temporal sampling is required to follow day-to-day changes of\nthe shadow patterns which may be a face-on variant of the UX Orionis\nphenomenon.\n", "  In the cold pulse experiments in J-TEXT, not only are the rapid electron\ntemperature increases in core observed, but also the steep rises of inner\ndensity are found. Moreover, the core toroidal rotation is also accelerated\nduring the non-local transport process of electron temperature. These new\nfindings of cold pulse experiments in J-TEXT reveal that turbulence spreading\nis the possible mechanism for the non-local transport dynamics.\n", "  Protoplanetary disk mass is a key parameter controlling the process of\nplanetary system formation. CO molecular emission is often used as a tracer of\ngas mass in the disk. In this study we consider the ability of CO to trace the\ngas mass over a wide range of disk structural parameters and search for\nchemical species that could possibly be used as alternative mass tracers to CO.\nSpecifically, we apply detailed astrochemical modeling to a large set of models\nof protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, to select molecules with\nabundances correlated with the disk mass and being relatively insensitive to\nother disk properties. We do not consider sophisticated dust evolution models,\nrestricting ourselves with the standard astrochemical assumption of $0.1~\\mu $m\ndust. We find that CO is indeed the best molecular tracer for total gas mass,\ndespite the fact that it is not the main carbon carrier, provided reasonable\nassumptions about CO abundance in the disk are used. Typically, chemical\nreprocessing lowers the abundance of CO by a factor of 3, compared to the case\nof photo-dissociation and freeze-out as the only ways of CO depletion. On\naverage only 13% C-atoms reside in gas-phase CO, albeit with variations from 2\nto 30%. CO$_2$, H$_2$O and H$_2$CO can potentially serve as alternative mass\ntracers, the latter two being only applicable if disk structural parameters are\nknown.\n", "  We present an ultraviolet spectroscopic survey of strong H I absorbers in the\nintergalactic medium, probing their evolution over the last 6-7 Gyr at\nredshifts $0.24 \\leq z \\leq 0.84$. We measure column densities $N_{\\rm HI} \\,(\n{\\rm cm}^{-2})$ from the pattern of Lyman-series absorption lines and flux\ndecrement at the Lyman limit (LL) when available. We analyzed 220 H I absorbers\nin ultraviolet spectra of 102 active galactic nuclei (AGN) taken by the Cosmic\nOrigins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope with G130M/G160M\ngratings (1134-1795 \\AA). For 158 absorbers with $\\log N_{\\rm HI} \\geq 15$, the\nmean frequency is $d {\\cal N}/dz = 4.95 \\pm 0.39$ over pathlength $\\Delta z =\n31.94$ ($0.24 \\leq z \\leq 0.84)$. We identify 8 Lyman Limit Systems (LLS, $\\log\nN_{\\rm HI} \\geq 17.2$) and 54 partial systems (pLLS) with $16.0 \\leq \\log\nN_{\\rm HI} < 17.2$. Toward 159 AGN between $0.01 < z_{\\rm abs} < 0.84$ with\n$\\Delta z \\approx 48$, we find four damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers (DLA) with $(d\n{\\cal N}/dz)_{\\rm DLA} = 0.083^{+0.066}_{-0.040}$ at $\\langle z \\rangle =\n0.18$. The mean LLS frequency between $z = 0.24-0.48$ is $(d {\\cal N}/dz)_{\\rm\nLLS} = 0.36^{+0.20}_{-0.13}$ fitted to $N(z) =\n(0.25^{+0.13}_{-0.09})(1+z)^{1.14}$. For 54 pLLS we find $(d {\\cal N}/dz)_{\\rm\npLLS} = 1.69\\pm0.23$ at $\\langle z \\rangle = 0.39$, a frequency consistent with\ngaseous halo sizes $R \\approx 100 h^{-1}~{\\rm kpc}$ for ($0.3-3L^*$) galaxies.\nA maximum-likelihood analysis yields a distribution $f(N,z) = C_0 N^{-\\beta}\n(1+z)^{\\gamma}$ with $\\beta = 1.48 \\pm 0.05$ and $\\gamma =\n1.14^{+0.88}_{-0.89}$ for $15 \\leq \\log N_{\\rm HI} \\leq 17.5$. The far-UV\nopacity gradient is $d \\tau_{\\rm eff} / dz \\approx (0.444)(1+z)^{1.14}$ over\nthe range $15 \\leq \\log N_{\\rm HI} \\leq 17$, implying mean LyC optical depth\n$\\tau_{\\rm eff} \\approx 0.3-0.5$ toward sources at $z = 1-2$.\n", "  The thermal phase curve of 55 Cancri e is the first measurement of the\ntemperature distribution of a tidally locked Super-Earth, but raises a number\nof puzzling questions about the planet's climate. The phase curve has a high\namplitude and peak offset, suggesting that it has a significant eastward\nhot-spot shift as well as a large day-night temperature contrast. We use a\ngeneral circulation model to model potential climates, and investigate the\nrelation between bulk atmospheric composition and the magnitude of these\nseemingly contradictory features. We confirm theoretical models of tidally\nlocked circulation are consistent with our numerical model of 55 Cnc e, and\nrule out certain atmospheric compositions based on their thermodynamic\nproperties. Our best-fitting atmosphere has a significant hot-spot shift and\nday-night contrast, although these are not as large as the observed phase\ncurve. We discuss possible physical processes which could explain the\nobservations, and show that night-side cloud formation from species such as SiO\nfrom a day-side magma ocean could potentially increase the phase curve\namplitude and explain the observations. We conclude that the observations could\nbe explained by an optically thick atmosphere with a low mean molecular weight,\na surface pressure of several bar and a strong eastward circulation, with\nnight-side cloud formation a possible explanation for the difference between\nour model and the observations.\n", "  Eclipsing binaries are vital for directly determining stellar parameters\nwithout reliance on models or scaling relations. Spectroscopically derived\nparameters of detached and semi-detached binaries allow us to determine\ncomponent masses that can inform theories of stellar and binary evolution. Here\nwe present moderate resolution ground-based spectra of stars in close binary\nsystems with and without (detected) tertiary companions observed by NASA's\nKepler mission and analyzed for eclipse timing variations. We obtain radial\nvelocities and spectroscopic orbits for five single-lined and 35 double-lined\nsystems, and confirm one false positive eclipsing binary. For the double-lined\nspectroscopic binaries we also determine individual component masses and\nexamine the mass ratio M_2/M_1 distribution, which is dominated by binaries\nwith like-mass pairs and semi-detached classical Algol systems that have\nundergone mass transfer. Finally, we constrain the mass of the tertiary\ncomponent for five double-lined binaries with previously detected companions.\n", "  We present optical and near-infrared stellar polarization observations toward\nthe dark filamentary clouds associated with IC5146. The data allow us to\ninvestigate the dust properties (this paper) and the magnetic field structure\n(Paper II). A total of 2022 background stars were detected in $R_{c}$-, $i'$-,\n$H$-, and/or $K$-bands to $A_V \\lesssim 25$ mag. The ratio of the polarization\npercentage at different wavelengths provides an estimate of $\\lambda_{max}$,\nthe wavelength of peak polarization, which is an indicator of the small-size\ncutoff of the grain size distribution. The grain size distribution seems to\nsignificantly change at $A_V \\sim$ 3 mag, where both the average and dispersion\nof $P_{R_c}/P_{H}$ decrease. In addition, we found $\\lambda_{max}$ $\\sim$\n0.6-0.9 $\\mu$m for $A_V>2.5$ mag, which is larger than the $\\sim$ 0.55 $\\mu$m\nin the general ISM, suggesting that grain growth has already started in low\n$A_V$ regions. Our data also reveal that polarization efficiency (PE $\\equiv\nP_{\\lambda}/A_V$) decreases with $A_V$ as a power-law in $R_c$-, $i'$-, and\n$K$-bands with indices of -0.71$\\pm$0.10, -1.23$\\pm$0.10 and -0.53$\\pm$0.09.\nHowever, $H$-band data show a power index change; the PE varies with $A_V$\nsteeply (index of -0.95$\\pm$0.30) when $A_V < 2.88\\pm0.67$ mag but softly\n(index of -0.25$\\pm$0.06) for greater $A_V$ values. The soft decay of PE in\nhigh $A_V$ regions is consistent with the Radiative Aligned Torque model,\nsuggesting that our data trace the magnetic field to $A_V \\sim 20$ mag.\nFurthermore, the breakpoint found in $H$-band is similar to the $A_V$ where we\nfound the $P_{R_c}/P_{H}$ dispersion significantly decreased. Therefore, the\nflat PE-$A_V$ in high $A_V$ regions implies that the power index changes result\nfrom additional grain growth.\n", "  We report experimental evidence for a crossover between a liquid-like state\nand a gas-like state in fluid methane (CH4). This crossover is observed in all\nof our experiments, up to 397 K temperature; 2.1 times the critical temperature\nof methane. The crossover has been characterized with both Raman spectroscopy\nand X-ray diffraction in a number of separate experiments, and confirmed to be\nreversible. We associate this crossover with the Frenkel line - a recently\nhypothesized crossover in dynamic properties of fluids extending to arbitrarily\nhigh pressure and temperature, dividing the phase diagram into separate regions\nwhere the fluid possesses liquid-like and gas-like properties. On the\nliquid-like side the Raman-active vibration increases in frequency linearly as\npressure is increased, as expected due to the repulsive interaction between\nadjacent molecules. On the gas-like side this competes with the attractive Van\nder Waals potential leading the vibration frequency to decrease as pressure is\nincreased.\n", "  An otherwise dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a galactic nucleus\nflares up when it tidally disrupts a star passing by. Most of the tidal\ndisruption events (TDEs) and candidates discovered in the optical/UV have broad\noptical emission lines with complex and diverse profiles of puzzling origin. In\nthis Letter, we show that the double-peaked broad Halpha line of the TDE\ncandidate PTF09djl can be well modelled with a relativistic elliptical\naccretion disk and the peculiar substructures with one peak at the line rest\nwavelength and the other redshifted to about 3.5x10^4 km/s are mainly due to\nthe orbital motion of the emitting matter within the disk plane of large\ninclination 88\\degr and pericenter orientation nearly vertical to the observer.\nThe accretion disk has an extreme eccentricity 0.966 and semimajor axis of 340\nBH Schwarzschild radii. The viewing angle effects of large disk inclination\nlead to significant attenuation of He emission lines originally produced at\nlarge electron scattering optical depth and to the absence/weakness of He\nemission lines in the spectra of PTF09djl. Our results suggest that the\ndiversities of line intensity ratios among the line species in optical TDEs are\nprobably due to the differences of disk inclinations.\n", "  We study the electrocaloric effect in the classic ferroelectric BaTiO3\nthrough a series of phase transitions driven by applied electric field and\ntemperature. We find both negative and positive electrocaloric effects, with\nthe negative electrocaloric effect, where temperature decreases with applied\nfield, in monoclinic phases. Macroscopic polarization rotation is evident\nthrough the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases under applied field, and is\nresponsible for the negative electrocaloric effect.\n", "  We systematically analyze X-ray variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\nin the 7~Ms \\textit{Chandra} Deep Field-South survey. On the longest timescale\n($\\approx~17$ years), we find only weak (if any) dependence of X-ray\nvariability amplitudes on energy bands or obscuration. We use four different\npower spectral density (PSD) models to fit the anti-correlation between\nnormalized excess variance ($\\sigma^2_{\\rm nxv}$) and luminosity, and obtain a\nbest-fit power law index $\\beta=1.16^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ for the low-frequency\npart of AGN PSD. We also divide the whole light curves into 4 epochs in order\nto inspect the dependence of $\\sigma^2_{\\rm nxv}$ on these timescales, finding\nan overall increasing trend. The analysis of these shorter light curves also\ninfers a $\\beta$ of $\\sim 1.3$ that is consistent with the above-derived\n$\\beta$, which is larger than the frequently-assumed value of $\\beta=1$. We\nthen investigate the evolution of $\\sigma^2_{\\rm nxv}$. No definitive\nconclusion is reached due to limited source statistics but, if present, the\nobserved trend goes in the direction of decreasing AGN variability at fixed\nluminosity toward large redshifts. We also search for transient events and find\n6 notable candidate events with our considered criteria. Two of them may be a\nnew type of fast transient events, one of which is reported here for the first\ntime. We therefore estimate a rate of fast outbursts $\\langle\\dot{N}\\rangle =\n1.0^{+1.1}_{-0.7}\\times 10^{-3}~\\rm galaxy^{-1}~yr^{-1}$ and a tidal disruption\nevent~(TDE) rate $\\langle\\dot{N}_{\\rm TDE}\\rangle=8.6^{+8.5}_{-4.9}\\times\n10^{-5}~\\rm galaxy^{-1}~yr^{-1}$ assuming the other four long outbursts to be\nTDEs.\n", "  We propose theoretically an effective scheme for braiding Majorana bound\nstates by manipulating the point potential. The vortex pinning effect is\ncarefully elucidated. This effect may be used to control the vortices and\nMajorana bound states in topological superconductors. The exchange of two\nvortices induced by moving the potentials is simulated numerically. The\nzero-energy state in the vortex core is robust with respect to the strength of\nthe potential. The Majorana bound states in a pinned vortex are identified\nnumerically.\n", "  Damping in magnetization dynamics characterizes the dissipation of magnetic\nenergy and is essential for improving the performance of spintronics-based\ndevices. While the damping of ferromagnets has been well studied and can be\nartificially controlled in practice, the damping parameters of\nantiferromagnetic materials are nevertheless little known for their physical\nmechanisms or numerical values. Here we calculate the damping parameters in\nantiferromagnetic dynamics using the generalized scattering theory of\nmagnetization dissipation combined with the first-principles transport\ncomputation. For the PtMn, IrMn, PdMn and FeMn metallic antiferromagnets, the\ndamping coefficient associated with the motion of magnetization ($\\alpha_m$) is\none to three orders of magnitude larger than the other damping coefficient\nassociated with the variation of the N\\'eel order ($\\alpha_n$), in sharp\ncontrast to the assumptions made in the literature.\n", "  At optical wavelengths, Titan's brightness for large Sun-Titan-observer phase\nangles significantly exceeds its dayside brightness. The brightening that\noccurs near back-illumination is due to moderately large haze particles in the\nmoon's extended atmosphere that forward-scatter the incident sunlight.\nMotivated by this phenomenon, here we investigate the forward scattering from\ncurrently known exoplanets, its diagnostics possibilities, the observational\nrequirements to resolve it, and potential implications. An analytical\nexpression is derived for the amount of starlight forward-scattered by an\nexponential atmosphere that takes into account the finite angular size of the\nstar. We use this expression to tentatively estimate how prevalent this\nphenomenon may be. Based on numerical calculations that consider exoplanet\nvisibility, we identify numerous planets with predicted out-of-transit forward\nscattering signals of up to tens of parts-per-million provided that aerosols of\n$>$1 micron size form over an extended vertical region near the optical radius\nlevel. We propose that the interpretation of available optical phase curves\nshould be revised to constrain the strength of this phenomenon that might\nprovide insight into aerosol scale heights and particle sizes. For the\nrelatively general atmospheres considered here, forward scattering reduces the\ntransmission-only transit depth by typically less than the equivalent to a\nscale height. For short-period exoplanets the finite angular size of the star\nseverely affects the amount of radiation scattered towards the observer at\nmid-transit.\n", "  We discuss the renormalization of the polarizability of a nanoparticle in the\npresence of either (i) a continuous graphene sheet or (ii) a plasmonic graphene\ngrating, taking into account retardation effects. Our analysis demonstrates\nthat the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons in graphene produces a large\nenhancement of the real and imaginary parts of the renormalized polarizability.\nWe show that the imaginary part can be changed by a factor of up to 100\nrelatively to its value in the absence of graphene. We also show that the\nresonance in the case of the grating is narrower than in the continuous sheet.\nIn the case of the grating it is shown that the resonance can be tuned by\nchanging the grating geometric parameters.\n", "  New observations performed at IRAM Plateau de Bure reveal the absence of\nmolecular gas next to Andromeda's black hole. We derived a 3 sigma upper limit\non the molecular gas mass of 4300 Msol for the linewidth of 1000 km/s. This is\ncompatible with infra-red observations which reveal a hole in dust emission\nnext to the black hole. Some gas from stellar feedback is expected from the old\neccentric stellar disc population, but it is not accreted close to the black\nhole. This absence of gas explains the absence of stellar formation observed in\nthis region contrary to what is observed next to Sgr A* in the Milky Way.\nEither the gas has been swallowed by the black hole, or a feedback mechanism\nhas pushed the gas outside the central 1 pc. Nevertheless, we detect a small\nclump of gas with a very small velocity dispersion at 2.4\" from the black hole.\nIt is probable that this clumpy gas is seen in projection, as it does not\nfollow the rotation of the disk surrounding the black hole, its velocity\ndispersion is ten times smaller than the expected velocity gradient and the\ntidal shear from the black hole requires a gas density for this clump that is\nnot compatible with our observations.\n", "  We present an optical system based on two toroidal mirrors in a Wolter\nconfiguration to focus broadband XUV radiation. Optimization of the focusing\noptics alignment is carried out with the aid of an XUV wavefront sensor.\nBack-propagation of the optimized wavefront to the focus yields a focal spot of\n3.6$\\times$4.0 $\\mu$m$^2$ full width at half maximum, which is consistent with\nray-tracing simulations that predict a minimum size of 3.0$\\times$3.2\n$\\mu$m$^2$. This work is important for optimizing the intensity of focused\nhigh-order harmonics in order to reach the nonlinear interaction regime.\n", "  Ice mantles detected on the surface of dust grains toward the coldest regions\nof the interstellar medium can be photoprocessed by the secondary ultraviolet\n(UV) field present in dense cloud interiors. In this work, we present\nUV-irradiation experiments under astrophysically relevant conditions of pure\nNH3 ice samples in an ultra-high vacuum chamber where solid samples were\ndeposited onto a substrate at 8 K. The ice analogs were subsequently\nphotoprocessed with a microwave-discharged hydrogen- flow lamp. The induced\nradiation and photochemistry led to the production of H2, N2 and N2H4. In\naddition, photodesorption to the gas phase of the original ice component, NH3,\nand two of the three detected photoproducts, H2 and N2, was observed thanks to\na quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). Calibration of the QMS allowed\nquantifica- tion of the photodesorption yields, leading to Ypd(NH3)=2.1+2.1-1.0\nx 10^-3 molecules per incident photon, which remained constant during the whole\nexperiments, while photodesorption of H2 and N2 increased with fluence,\npointing toward an indirect photodesorption mecha- nism involving energy\ntransfer for these species. Photodesorption yield of N2 molecules after a\nfluence equivalent to that experienced by ice mantles in space was similar to\nthat of the NH3 molecules (Ypd (N2) = 1.7+1.7-0.9 x 10^-3 molecules incident\nphoton ).\n", "  We present a study of NGC 4993, the host galaxy of the GW170817 gravitational\nwave event, the GRB170817A short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) and the AT2017gfo\nkilonova. We use Dark Energy Camera imaging, AAT spectra and publicly available\ndata, relating our findings to binary neutron star (BNS) formation scenarios\nand merger delay timescales. NGC4993 is a nearby (40 Mpc) early-type galaxy,\nwith $i$-band S\\'ersic index $n=4.0$ and low asymmetry ($A=0.04\\pm 0.01$).\nThese properties are unusual for sGRB hosts. However, NGC4993 presents\nshell-like structures and dust lanes indicative of a recent galaxy merger, with\nthe optical transient located close to a shell. We constrain the star formation\nhistory (SFH) of the galaxy assuming that the galaxy merger produced a star\nformation burst, but find little to no on-going star formation in either\nspatially-resolved broadband SED or spectral fitting. We use the best-fit SFH\nto estimate the BNS merger rate in this type of galaxy, as $R_{NSM}^{gal}=\n5.7^{+0.57}_{-3.3} \\times 10^{-6} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$. If star formation is the only\nconsidered BNS formation scenario, the expected number of BNS mergers from\nearly-type galaxies detectable with LIGO during its first two observing seasons\nis $0.038^{+0.004}_{-0.022}$, as opposed to $\\sim 0.5$ from all galaxy types.\nHypothesizing that the binary system formed due to dynamical interactions\nduring the galaxy merger, the subsequent time elapsed can constrain the delay\ntime of the BNS coalescence. By using velocity dispersion estimates and the\nposition of the shells, we find that the galaxy merger occurred $t_{\\rm\nmer}\\lesssim 200~{\\rm Myr}$ prior to the BNS coalescence.\n", "  We examine the metallicity trends in the Milky Way (MW) bulge - using APOGEE\nDR13 data - and explore their origin by comparing two N-body models of isolated\ngalaxies which develop a bar and a boxy/peanut (b/p) bulge. Both models have\nbeen proposed as scenarios for reconciling a disc origin of the MW bulge with a\nnegative vertical metallicity gradient. The first model is a superposition of\nco-spatial, i.e. overlapping, disc populations with different scaleheights,\nkinematics and metallicities. In this model the thick, metal-poor, and\ncentrally concentrated disc populations contribute significantly to the stellar\nmass budget in the inner galaxy. The second model is a single disc with an\ninitial steep radial metallicity gradient, which is mapped by the bar into the\nb/p bulge in such a way that the vertical metallicity gradient of the MW bulge\nis reproduced -- as shown already in previous works in the literature. However,\nas we show here, the latter model does not reproduce the positive longitudinal\nmetallicity gradient of the inner disc, nor the metal-poor innermost regions of\nthe Bulge seen in the data. On the other hand, the model with co-spatial thin\nand thick disc populations reproduces all the aforementioned trends. We\ntherefore see that it is possible to reconcile a (primarily) disc origin for\nthe MW bulge with the observed trends in metallicity by mapping the inner thin\nand thick discs of the MW into a b/p. For this scenario to reproduce the\nobservations, the $\\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor, thick disc populations must\nhave a significant mass contribution in the inner regions -- as has been\nsuggested for the Milky Way.\n", "  Highly uniform and ordered nanodot arrays are crucial for high performance\nquantum optoelectronics including new semiconductor lasers and single photon\nemitters, and for synthesizing artificial lattices of interacting\nquasiparticles towards quantum information processing and simulation of\nmany-body physics. Van der Waals heterostructures of 2D semiconductors are\nnaturally endowed with an ordered nanoscale landscape, i.e. the moir\\'e pattern\nthat laterally modulates electronic and topographic structures. Here we find\nthese moir\\'e effects realize superstructures of nanodot confinements for\nlong-lived interlayer excitons, which can be either electrically or strain\ntuned from perfect arrays of quantum emitters to excitonic superlattices with\ngiant spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Besides the wide range tuning of emission\nwavelength, the electric field can also invert the spin optical selection rule\nof the emitter arrays. This unprecedented control arises from the gauge\nstructure imprinted on exciton wavefunctions by the moir\\'e, which underlies\nthe SOC when hopping couples nanodots into superlattices. We show that the\nmoir\\'e hosts complex-hopping honeycomb superlattices, where exciton bands\nfeature a Dirac node and two Weyl nodes, connected by spin-momentum locked\ntopological edge modes.\n", "  We present an alternative form of master equation, applicable on the analysis\nof non-equilibrium dynamics of fermionic open quantum systems. The formalism\nconsiders a general scenario, composed by a multipartite quantum system in\ncontact with several reservoirs, each one with a specific chemical potential\nand in thermal equilibrium. With the help of Jordan-Wigner transformation, we\nperform a fermion-to-qubit mapping to derive a set of Lindblad superoperators\nthat can be straightforwardly used on a wide range of physical setups.To\nillustrate our approach, we explore the effect of a charge sensor, acting as a\nprobe, over the dynamics of electrons on coupled quantum molecules. The probe\nconsists on a quantum dot attached to source and drain leads, that allows a\ncurrent flow. The dynamics of populations, entanglement degree and purity show\nhow the probe is behind the sudden deaths and rebirths of entanglement, at\nshort times. Then, the evolution leads the system to an asymptotic state being\na statistical mixture. Those are signatures that the probe induces dephasing, a\nprocess that destroys the coherence of the quantum system.\n", "  We study the connection between the observed star formation rate-stellar mass\n(SFR-$M_*$) relation and the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) by\nmeans of a subhalo abundance matching technique coupled to merger trees\nextracted from a N-body simulation. Our approach consist of forcing the model\nto match the observed SMF at redshift $z \\sim 2.3$, and let it evolve down to\n$z \\sim 0.3$ according to a $\\tau$ model, an exponentially declining functional\nform which describes the star formation rate decay of both satellite and\ncentral galaxies. In this study, we use three different sets of SMFs: ZFOURGE\ndata from Tomczak et al.; UltraVISTA data from Ilbert et al. and COSMOS data\nfrom Davidzon et al. We also build a mock survey combining UltraVISTA with\nZFOURGE. Our modelling of quenching timescales is consistent with the evolution\nof the SMF down to $z \\sim 0.3$, with different accuracy depending on the\nparticular survey used for calibration. We tested our model against the\nobserved SMFs at low redshift and it predicts residuals (observation versus\nmodel) within $1\\sigma$ observed scatter along most of the stellar mass range\ninvestigated, and with mean residuals below 0.1 dex in the range $\\sim\n[10^{8.7}-10^{11.7}] M_{\\odot}$. We then compare the SFR-$M_*$ relation\npredicted by the model with the observed one at different redshifts. The\npredicted SFR-$M_*$ relation underpredicts the median SFR at fixed stellar mass\nrelative to observations at all redshifts. Nevertheless, the shapes are\nconsistent with the observed relations up to intermediate-mass galaxies,\nfollowed by a rapid decline for massive galaxies.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations, we report that ZrO is a topological\nmaterial with the coexistence of three pairs of type-II triply degenerate nodal\npoints (TNPs) and three nodal rings (NRs), when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is\nignored. Noticeably, the TNPs reside around Fermi energy with large linear\nenergy range along tilt direction (> 1 eV) and the NRs are formed by three\nstrongly entangled bands. Under symmetry-preserving strain, each NR would\nevolve into four droplet-shaped NRs before fading away, producing distinct\nevolution compared with that in usual two-band NR. When SOC is included, TNPs\nwould transform into type-II Dirac points while all the NRs have gaped.\nRemarkably, the type-II Dirac points inherit the advantages of TNPs: residing\naround Fermi energy and exhibiting large linear energy range. Both features\nfacilitate the observation of interesting phenomena induced by type-II\ndispersion. The symmetry protections and low-energy Hamiltonian for the\nnontrivial band crossings are discussed.\n", "  Recently, some very tight constraints of annihilating dark matter have been\nobtained from gamma-ray data of the Milky Way and Milky Way dwarf spheroidal\nsatellite galaxies. In this article, we report that there are two excellent\ngalaxy clusters (A2877 and Fornax) which can provide interesting constraints\nfor annihilating dark matter. The lower limits of the dark matter mass for the\nthermal relic annihilation cross section are 25 GeV, 6 GeV, 130 GeV and 100 GeV\nrespectively for the $e^+e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and $b\\bar{b}$\nchannels. For some configuration of our working assumptions, our results\nimprove the Fermi-LAT upper limits of annihilation cross sections by a factor\nof $1.3-1.8$ for wide ranges of dark matter mass for $e^+e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and\n$b\\bar{b}$ channels, and a factor of $1.2-1.8$ for $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channel with\ndark matter mass $\\le 100$ GeV. These limits basically rule out most of the\nexisting popular dark matter interpretation of the GeV excess in the Milky Way.\n", "  Magnetic refrigeration based on the magnetocaloric effect at room temperature\nis one of the most attractive alternative to the current gas\ncompression/expansion method routinely employed. Nevertheless, in giant\nmagnetocaloric materials, optimal refrigeration is restricted to the narrow\ntemperature window of the phase transition (Tc). In this work, we present the\npossibility of varying this transition temperature into a same giant\nmagnetocaloric material by ion irradiation. We demonstrate that the transition\ntemperature of iron rhodium thin films can be tuned by the bombardment of ions\nof Ne 5+ with varying fluences up to 10 14 ions cm --2 , leading to optimal\nrefrigeration over a large 270--380 K temperature window. The Tc modification\nis found to be due to the ion-induced disorder and to the density of new\npoint-like defects. The variation of the phase transition temperature with the\nnumber of incident ions opens new perspectives in the conception of devices\nusing giant magnetocaloric materials.\n", "  The observed magnetic field on the solar surface is characterized by a very\ncomplex spatial and temporal behavior. Although feature-tracking algorithms\nhave allowed us to deepen our understanding of this behavior, subjectivity\nplays an important role in the identification and tracking of such features. In\nthis paper, we continue studies Gorobets, A. Y., Borrero, J. M., & Berdyugina,\nS. 2016, ApJL, 825, L18 of the temporal stochasticity of the magnetic field on\nthe solar surface without relying either on the concept of magnetic features or\non subjective assumptions about their identification and interaction. We\npropose a data analysis method to quantify fluctuations of the line-of-sight\nmagnetic field by means of reducing the temporal field's evolution to the\nregular Markov process. We build a representative model of fluctuations\nconverging to the unique stationary (equilibrium) distribution in the long time\nlimit with maximum entropy. We obtained different rates of convergence to the\nequilibrium at fixed noise cutoff for two sets of data. This indicates a strong\ninfluence of the data spatial resolution and mixing-polarity fluctuations on\nthe relaxation process. The analysis is applied to observations of magnetic\nfields of the relatively quiet areas around an active region carried out during\nthe second flight of the Sunrise/IMaX and quiet Sun areas at the disk center\nfrom the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory satellite.\n", "  Far-infrared and (sub)millimeter fluxes can be used to study dust in\nprotoplanetary disks, the building blocks of planets. Here, we combine\nobservations from the Herschel Space Observatory with ancillary data of 284\nprotoplanetary disks in the Taurus, Chamaeleon I, and Ophiuchus star-forming\nregions, covering from the optical to mm/cm wavelengths. We analyze their\nspectral indices as a function of wavelength and determine their\n(sub)millimeter slopes when possible. Most disks display observational evidence\nof grain growth, in agreement with previous studies. No correlation is found\nbetween other tracers of disk evolution and the millimeter spectral indices. A\nsimple disk model is used to fit these sources, and we derive posterior\ndistributions for the optical depth at 1.3 mm and 10 au, the disk temperature\nat this same radius, and the dust opacity spectral index. We find the fluxes at\n70 microns to correlate strongly with disk temperatures at 10 au, as derived\nfrom these simple models. We find tentative evidence for spectral indices in\nChamaeleon I being steeper than those of disks in Taurus/Ophiuchus, although\nmore millimeter observations are needed to confirm this trend and identify its\npossible origin. Additionally, we determine the median spectral energy\ndistribution of each region and find them to be similar across the entire\nwavelength range studied, possibly due to the large scatter in disk properties\nand morphologies.\n", "  The $Y(4220)$ production in the process of $p\\bar{p} \\to Y(4220)\\pi^0$ is\nstudied within the effective Lagrangian approach. We first study the $e^+e^-\\to\nY(4220) \\to p\\bar{p}\\pi^0$ reaction at center-of-mass energy $4.258$ GeV with\nthe assumption that the $Y(4220)$ is a $\\psi(4S)$ state. We show that the\ninclusion of nucleon and nucleon resonance leads to a quite good description of\nthe experimental data of $\\pi^0 p$ and $\\pi^0 \\bar{p}$ invariant mass\ndistributions. Then, the total and angular distributions of the $p\\bar{p} \\to\nY(4220)\\pi^0$ reaction are investigated. It is shown that the nucleon pole is\ndominant but the contributions from excited nucleon resonances are\nnon-negligible. The $p\\bar{p} \\to Y(4220)\\pi^0$ reaction is useful for studying\nthe property of $Y(4220)$ and our calculated results may be tested at the\nforthcoming $\\overline{\\mbox{P}}$ANDA experiments.\n", "  We report the study of far-IR sizes of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in\nrelation to their dust-obscured star formation rate (SFR) and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) presence, determined using mid-IR photometry. We determined the\nmillimeter-wave ($\\lambda_{\\rm obs}=1100 \\mu$m) sizes of 69 ALMA-identified\nSMGs, selected with $\\geq10$$\\sigma$ confidence on ALMA images ($F_{\\rm 1100\n\\mu m}=1.7$--7.4 mJy). We found that all the SMGs are located above an\navoidance region in the millimeter size-flux plane, as expected by the\nEddington limit for star formation. In order to understand what drives the\ndifferent millimeter-wave sizes in SMGs, we investigated the relation between\nmillimeter-wave size and AGN fraction for 25 of our SMGs at $z=1$--3. We found\nthat the SMGs for which the mid-IR emission is dominated by star formation or\nAGN have extended millimeter-sizes, with respective median $R_{\\rm c,e} =\n1.6^{+0.34}_{-0.21}$ and 1.5$^{+0.93}_{-0.24}$ kpc. Instead, the SMGs for which\nthe mid-IR emission corresponds to star-forming/AGN composites have more\ncompact millimeter-wave sizes, with median $R_{\\rm c,e}=1.0^{+0.20}_{-0.20}$\nkpc. The relation between millimeter-wave size and AGN fraction suggests that\nthis size may be related to the evolutionary stage of the SMG. The very compact\nsizes for composite star-forming/AGN systems could be explained by supermassive\nblack holes growing rapidly during the SMG coalescing, star-formation phase.\n", "  We present an analysis of physical and morphological properties of an\ninteracting pair of dwarf galaxies UGC 4703 located at the vicinity of an\nisolated Milky-Way (MW) type spiral galaxy NGC 2718. Based on the comparison of\nphysical and morphological properties with that of the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), we report that the UGC 4703 pair-NGC 2718\nsystem is probably an LMC-SMC-MW analogue. Located at a sky projected distance\nof 81 kpc from NGC 2718, we find that UGC 4703 is clearly interacting with its\nnearby smaller mass companion UGC 4703B forming a bridge of stellar stream\nbetween them. Total B-band luminosity of UGC 4703 and its companion is -17.75\nand -16.25 mag, respectively. We obtained HI 21-cm line data of UGC 4703 using\nthe GMRT to get a more detailed view of neutral hydrogen (HI) emission. The HI\nimage revealed evidence of interaction between the dwarf galaxy pair but no\nextended emission, like Magellanic Stream (MS), was detected between NGC 2781\nand the UGC 4703 dwarf pair. We also detected star-forming regions along the\nUGC 4703/ 4703B bridge with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{7}$ M$_{\\odot}$. While\ncomparing the optical and HI morphology of the interacting dwarf pairs (UGC\n4703-4703B and LMC-SMC) we discuss possible difference in interaction histories\nof these systems.\n", "  We present a multi-spin solution to the Yang-Baxter equation. The solution\ncorresponds to the integrable lattice spin model of statistical mechanics with\npositive Boltzmann weights and parameterized in terms of the basic\nhypergeometric functions. We obtain this solution from a non-trivial basic\nhypergeometric sum-integral identity which originates from the equality of\nsupersymmetric indices for certain three-dimensional N=2 Seiberg dual theories.\n", "  Superconducting hot-electron bolometers are presently the best performing\nmixing devices for the frequency range beyond 1.2 THz, where good quality\nsuperconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) devices do not exist. Their\nphysical appearance is very simple: an antenna consisting of a normal metal,\nsometimes a normal metal-superconductor bilayer, connected to a thin film of a\nnarrow, short superconductor with a high resistivity in the normal state. The\ndevice is brought into an optimal operating regime by applying a dc current and\na certain amount of local- oscillator power. Despite this technological\nsimplicity its operation has been found to be controlled by many different\naspects of superconductivity, all occurring simultaneously. A core ingredient\nis the understanding that there are two sources of resistance in a\nsuperconductor: a charge conversion resistance occurring at an\nnormal-metal-superconductor interface and a resistance due to time- dependent\nchanges of the superconducting phase. The latter is responsible for the actual\nmixing process in a non-uniform superconducting environment set up by the\nbias-conditions and the geometry. The present understanding indicates that\nfurther improvement needs to be found in the use of other materials with a\nfaster energy-relaxation rate. Meanwhile several empirical parameters have\nbecome physically meaningful indicators of the devices, which will facilitate\nthe technological developments.\n", "  ALMA is providing us essential information on where certain molecules form.\nObserving where these molecules emission arises from, the physical conditions\nof the gas, and how this relates with the presence of other species allows us\nto understand the formation of many species, and to significantly improve our\nknowledge of the chemistry that occurs in the space. We studied the molecular\ndistribution of NaCN around IRC +10216, a molecule detected previously, but\nwhose origin is not clear. High angular resolution maps allow us to model the\nabundance distribution of this molecule and check suggested formation paths. We\nmodeled the emission of NaCN assuming local thermal equilibrium (LTE)\nconditions. These profiles were fitted to azimuthal averaged intensity profiles\nto obtain an abundance distribution of NaCN. We found that the presence of NaCN\nseems compatible with the presence of CN, probably as a result of the\nphotodissociation of HCN, in the inner layers of the ejecta of IRC +10216.\nHowever, similar as for CH 3 CN, current photochemical models fail to reproduce\nthis CN reservoir. We also found that the abundance peak of NaCN appears at a\nradius of 3 x 10 15 cm, approximately where the abundance of NaCl, suggested to\nbe the parent species, starts to decay. However, the abundance ratio shows that\nthe NaCl abundance is lower than that obtained for NaCN. We expect that the LTE\nassumption might result in NaCN abundances higher than the real ones. Updated\nphotochemical models, collisional rates, and reaction rates are essential to\ndetermine the possible paths of the NaCN formation.\n", "  It has long been known that a uniform distribution of matter cannot produce a\nPoisson distribution of density fluctuations on very large scales $1/k > ct$ by\nthe motion of discrete particles over timescale $t$. The constraint is part of\nwhat is sometimes referred to as the Zel'dovich bound. We investigate in this\npaper the transport of energy by the propagation of waves emanating {\\it\nincoherently} from a regular and infinite lattice of oscillators, each having\nthe same finite amount of energy reserve initially. The model we employ does\nnot involve the expansion of the Universe -- the scales of interest are all\ndeeply sub-horizon -- but the size of regions over which perturbations are\nevaluated far exceed $ct$, where $t$ is the time elapsed since the start of\nemission (it is assumed that $t$ greatly exceeds the duration of emission). We\nfind that to lowest order, when only wave fields $\\propto 1/r$ are included,\nthere is exact compensation between the energy loss of the oscillators and the\nenergy emitted into space, which means $P(0)=0$ for the power spectrum of\ndensity fluctuations on the largest scales. This is consistent with the\nZel'dovich bound. To the next order when near fields $\\propto r^{-2}$ are\nincluded, however, $P(0)$ settles at late times to a positive value that\ndepends only on time, as $t^{-2}$ (the same applies to an energy non-conserving\nterm). Even though this effect looks like superluminal energy transport, there\nis no violation of causality because the two-point function vanishes completely\nfor $r>t$ if the emission of each oscillator is truncated beyond some duration.\nThe result calls to question any need of enlisting cosmic inflation to seed\nlarge scale density perturbations. When applied to fast radio bursts --\nuniformly distributed transients (to lowest order) that repeat at other\nlocations -- the result supports Hoyle's hypothesis of constant energy\ninjection.\n", "  Despite numerous studies the exact nature of the order parameter in\nsuperconducting Sr2RuO4 remains unresolved. We have extended previous\nsmall-angle neutron scattering studies of the vortex lattice in this material\nto a wider field range, higher temperatures, and with the field applied close\nto both the <100> and <110> basal plane directions. Measurements at high field\nwere made possible by the use of both spin polarization and analysis to improve\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. Rotating the field towards the basal plane causes a\ndistortion of the square vortex lattice observed for H // <001>, and also a\nsymmetry change to a distorted triangular symmetry for fields close to <100>.\nThe vortex lattice distortion allows us to determine the intrinsic\nsuperconducting anisotropy between the c-axis and the Ru-O basal plane,\nyielding a value of ~60 at low temperature and low to intermediate fields. This\ngreatly exceeds the upper critical field anisotropy of ~20 at low temperature,\nreminiscent of Pauli limiting. Indirect evidence for Pauli paramagnetic effects\non the unpaired quasiparticles in the vortex cores are observed, but a direct\ndetection lies below the measurement sensitivity. The superconducting\nanisotropy is found to be independent of temperature but increases for fields >\n1 T, indicating multiband superconductvity in Sr2RuO4. Finally, the temperature\ndependence of the scattered intensity provides further support for gap nodes or\ndeep minima in the superconducting gap.\n", "  In the paper possible local and nonlocal reductions of the\nAblowitz-Kaup-Newell-Suger (AKNS) hierarchy are collected, including the\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV) hierarchy, modified KdV hierarchy and their nonlocal\nversions, nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger hierarchy and their nonlocal versions,\nsine-Gordon equation in nonpotential form and its nonlocal forms. A reduction\ntechnique for solutions is employed, by which exact solutions in double\nWronskian form are obtained for these reduced equations from those double\nWronskian solutions of the AKNS hierarchy. As examples of dynamics we\nillustrate new interaction of two-soliton solutions of the reverse-$t$\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. Although as a single soliton it is always\nstationary, two solitons travel along completely symmetric trajectories in\n$\\{x,t\\}$ plane and their amplitudes are affected by phase parameters.\nAsymptotic analysis is given as demonstration. The approach and relation\ndescribed in this paper are systematic and general and can be used to other\nnonlocal equations.\n", "  A new exact solution of the hydrodynamic equations is obtained in the form of\nthe Burgers vortex generalization (BVG)accounting for the medium rotation as a\nwhole and linear uniform friction. The nonlinear dissipative-centrifugal\ninstability(DCI)condition, associated with some superthreshold rotation angular\nvelocity and nonzero friction, for solid-body rotating core of BVG is obtained.\nThe new effect of cyclone-anticyclone vortex asymmetry, arising during DCI of\nBVG vortex core, is shown to be similar to that observed for the atmospheres of\nhigh speed rotating planets and laboratory experiments.\n", "  Extragalactic radio sources with projected linear size larger than one\nMegaparsec 1 Mpc = 3.09e22 m = 3.3e6 light years) are called Giant Radio\nGalaxies (GRGs) or quasars (GRQs). Over the past few years our search for such\nobjects by visual inspection of large-scale radio surveys like the NRAO VLA Sky\nSurvey (NVSS) and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST)\nhas allowed us to quadruple the number of GRGs published in literature. Here we\nreport the discovery of 7 new GRGs in two recent surveys, the JVLA 1-2 GHz\nSnapshot Survey of SDSS Stripe82 and the 150-MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey\nPreliminary Data Release (LoTSS-PDR).\n", "  A new honeycomb battery package structure is designed and optimized in this\nstudy. It is a honeycomb structure which uses grid to reinforce the strength.\nTo obtain the highly accurate finite element (FE) model, the material\nparameters of 18650 cylindrical Li-ion battery are identified by using\noptimization techniques based on flat compression test data. Due to the\nexpensive cost of finite element evaluation, the space mapping (SM) algorithm\nis suggested to optimize the structure of the package. Compared with other\nspace mapping algorithms, the coarse model of space mapping in this work is\nbased on a pseudo-plane-strain model. Moreover, to guarantee the reliability,\nthe mean and variance values of battery stress are used to be the objective\nfunction. The final optimum solution is obtained in 3 days, and it shows the\nmagnitude of stress and the distribution of stress are improved significantly\ncompared with initial structure. Moreover, the computational cost of\noptimization for the problem is decreased greatly.\n", "  We report the discovery of an extremely young protostar, SMM11, located in\nthe associated submillimeter condensation SMM11 in the Serpens Main cluster\nusing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) during its Cycle\n3 at 1.3 mm and an angular resolution of ~0.5\"~210 AU. SMM11 is a Class 0\nprotostar without any counterpart at 70 um or shorter wavelengths. The ALMA\nobservations show 1.3 mm continuum emission associated with a collimated 12CO\nbipolar outflow. Spitzer and Herschel data show that SMM11 is extremely cold\n(T_bol=26 K) and faint (L_bol<~0.9 Lsun). We estimate the inclination angle of\nthe outflow to be ~80 deg, almost parallel to the plane of the sky, from simple\nfitting using wind-driven-shell model. The continuum visibilities consist of\nGaussian and power-law components, suggesting a spherical envelope with a\nradius of ~600 AU around the protostar. The estimated low C18O abundance,\nX(C18O)=1.5-3x10^-10, is also consistent with its youth. The high outflow\nvelocity, a few 10 kms^-1 at a few 1000 AU, is much higher than theoretical\nsimulations of first hydrostatic cores and we suggest that SMM11 is a\ntransitional object right after the second collapse of the first core.\n", "  We present a method and preliminary results of the image reconstruction in\nthe Jagiellonian PET tomograph. Using GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomographic\nEmission), interactions of the 511 keV photons with a cylindrical detector were\ngenerated. Pairs of such photons, flying back-to-back, originate from e+e-\nannihilations inside a 1-mm spherical source. Spatial and temporal coordinates\nof hits were smeared using experimental resolutions of the detector. We\nincorporated the algorithm of the 3D Filtered Back Projection, implemented in\nthe STIR and TomoPy software packages, which differ in approximation methods.\nConsistent results for the Point Spread Functions of ~5/7,mm and ~9/20, mm were\nobtained, using STIR, for transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively,\nwith no time of flight information included.\n", "  We use unpolarized and polarized neutron scattering to study the temperature\nand polarization dependence of low-energy magnetic fluctuations in\nnearly-optimal-doped NaFe$_{0.9785}$Co$_{0.0215}$As, with coexisting\nsuperconductivity ($T_{\\rm c}\\approx19$ K) and weak antiferromagnetic order\n($T_{\\rm N}\\approx30$ K, ordered moment $\\approx0.02$ $\\mu_{\\rm B}$/Fe). A\nsingle spin resonance mode with intensity tracking the superconducting order\nparameter is observed, although energy of the mode only softens slightly on\napproaching $T_{\\rm c}$. Polarized neutron scattering reveals that the single\nresonance is mostly isotropic in spin space, similar to overdoped\nNaFe$_{0.935}$Co$_{0.045}$As but different from optimal electron-, hole-, and\nisovalent-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$ compounds, all featuring an additional prominent\nanisotropic component. Spin anisotropy in NaFe$_{0.9785}$Co$_{0.0215}$As is\ninstead present at energies below the resonance, which becomes partially gapped\nbelow $T_{\\rm c}$, similar to the situation in optimal-doped\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.9}$. Our results indicate that anisotropic spin fluctuations\nin NaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$As appear in the form of a resonance in the underdoped\nregime, become partially gapped below $T_{\\rm c}$ near optimal doping and\ndisappear in overdoped compounds.\n", "  The efficiency gap formula was introduced in to measure political\ngerrymandering. It played a key role in the Gill v. Whitford case whose appeal\nis currently before the Supreme Court, but it was very recently shown by\nBernstein and Duchin to have some problematic mathematical properties. We\npropose a new relative version of the efficiency gap formula that inherits its\ndesirable but not its undesirable features. Instead of measuring the difference\nbetween the number of votes wasted by the two parties, we measure the\ndifference between the proportions of their votes that the two parties wasted.\n", "  The widespread prevalence of close-in, nearly coplanar super-Earth- and\nsub-Neptune-sized planets in multiple-planet systems was one of the most\nsurprising results from the Kepler mission. By studying a uniform sample of\nKepler \"multis\" with mass measurements from transit timing variations (TTVs),\nwe show that a given planetary system tends to harbor a characteristic type of\nplanet. That is, planets in a system have both masses and radii that are far\nmore similar than if the system were assembled randomly from planets in the\npopulation. This finding has two important ramifications. First, the large\nintrinsic compositional scatter in the planet mass-radius relation is dominated\nby system-to-system variance rather than intra-system variance. Second, if\nprovided enough properties of the star and primordial protoplanetary disk,\nthere may be a substantial degree of predictability in the outcome of the\nplanet formation process. We show that stellar mass and metallicity account for\nof order $20\\%$ of the variation in outcomes; the remainder is as-yet unknown.\n", "  We present a number of notable results from the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey\n(VFTS), an ESO Large Program during which we obtained multi-epoch\nmedium-resolution optical spectroscopy of a very large sample of over 800\nmassive stars in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\nThis unprecedented data-set has enabled us to address some key questions\nregarding atmospheres and winds, as well as the evolution of (very) massive\nstars. Here we focus on O-type runaways, the width of the main sequence, and\nthe mass-loss rates for (very) massive stars. We also provide indications for\nthe presence of a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) in 30 Dor.\n", "  When generalized from plane waves to general vector beams, the notion of\npolarization described by the Stokes parameters turns out to be defined in a\nmomentum-associated system that is fixed by the so-called Stratton vector. As\nthe true intrinsic degree of freedom in the language of quantum mechanics, the\npolarization of light beams in any fixed momentum-associated system is able to\ncharacterize their vectorial feature in the laboratory reference system. The\nStratton vector is therefore the degree of freedom to distinguish the vectorial\nfeature of light beams that have the same \"polarization\". Such an observable\neffect of the Stratton vector helps to understand why plane waves of the same\nhelicity and the same momentum can be different by a Berry phase. This might be\nthe first time to reveal the physical origin of the Berry phase.\n", "  The Jagiellonian Positron Emission Tomograph (J-PET) is the first PET built\nfrom plastic scintillators. J-PET prototype consists of 192 detection modules\narranged axially in three layers forming a cylindrical diagnostic chamber with\nthe inner diameter of 85 cm and the axial field-of-view of 50 cm. An axial\narrangement of long strips of plastic scintillators, their small light\nattenuation, superior timing properties, and relative ease of the increase of\nthe axial field-of-view opens promising perspectives for the cost effective\nconstruction of the whole-body PET scanner, as well as construction of MR and\nCT compatible PET inserts. Present status of the development of the J-PET\ntomograph will be presented and discussed.\n", "  The hypothesis of the scale invariance of the macroscopic empty space, which\nintervenes through the cosmological constant, has led to new cosmological\nmodels. They show an accelerated cosmic expansion and satisfy several major\ncosmological tests. No unknown particles are needed. Developing the weak field\napproximation, we find that the here derived equation of motion corresponding\nto Newton's equation also contains a small outwards acceleration term. The new\nterm is particularly significant for very low density systems.\n  A modified virial theorem is derived and applied to clusters of galaxies. For\nthe Coma and Abell 2029 clusters, the dynamical masses are about a factor of 5\nto 10 smaller than in the standard case. This tends to let no room for dark\nmatter in these clusters. Then, the two-body problem is studied and an equation\ncorresponding to the Binet equation is obtained. The results are applied to the\nrotation curve of the outer layers of the Milky Way. Starting backwards from\nthe present rotation curve, we calculate the past evolution of the galactic\nrotation and find that, in the early stages, it was steep and Keplerian. Thus,\nthe flat rotation curves of galaxies appears as an age effect, a result\nconsistent with recent observations of distant galaxies by Genzel et al. (2017)\nand Lang et al. (2017). Finally, in an Appendix we also study the long-standing\nproblem of the increase with age of the vertical velocity dispersion in the\nGalaxy. The observed increase appears to result from the new small acceleration\nterm in the equation of the harmonic oscillator describing stellar motions\naround the galactic plane. Thus, we tend to conclude that neither the dark\nenergy, nor the dark matter seem to be needed in the proposed theoretical\ncontext.\n", "  A nontrivial conformally invariant model is obtained via generalization the\nmethod of obtaining conformally invariant models in $2D$ Euclidean space to the\nEuclidean space with dimension $D>2$. This method was previously developed by\nE.S. Fradkin and M.Ya. Palchik (see [7] and reference therein). The partial\nwave expansion of a four-point function $\\langle\nj_{\\mu}(x_{1})j_{\\nu}(x_{2})\\varphi(x_{3})\\varphi(x_{4})\\rangle$ containing two\nconserved vector fields $j_{\\mu}$ and two scalars $\\varphi$ of dimension $ d $\nin a $D$ -dimensional Euclidean space is considered. The requirement of the\nabsence the vector operator of the dimension $d + 1$ in this expansion allows\nus to find the relationship between all the coupling constants in such a model.\n", "  In this paper we extend the state-of-the-art filtered backprojection (FBP)\nmethod with application of the concept of Total Variation regularization. We\ncompare the performance of the new algorithm with the most common form of\nregularizing in the FBP image reconstruction via apodizing functions. The\nmethods are validated in terms of cross-correlation coefficient between\nreconstructed and real image of radioactive tracer distribution using standard\nDerenzo-type phantom. We demonstrate that the proposed approach results in\nhigher cross-correlation values with respect to the standard FBP method.\n", "  We present the first fully differential next-to-leading order QCD calculation\nfor lepton production in transversely polarized hadronic collisions, pp -> l X\n, where the lepton arises from the decay of an electroweak gauge boson. The\ncalculation is implemented in the Monte-Carlo like code `CHE' that already\nincludes the unpolarized and longitudinally polarized cross sections and may be\nreadily used to perform a comparison to experimental data and to extract\ninformation on the related parton distributions. We analyze the perturbative\nstability of the cross-section and double spin asymmetry A_TT at RHIC\nkinematics. We find that the QCD corrections are non-negligible even at the\nlevel of asymmetries and that they strongly depend on the lepton kinematics.\nFurthermore, we present two scenarios for transversely polarized parton\ndistributions, based on the de Florian-Sassot-Stratmann-Vogelsang (DSSV) set of\nlongitudinally parton densities and fully evolved to NLO accuracy, that can be\nused for the evaluation of different observables involving transverse\npolarization.\n", "  The combination of strong correlation and emergent lattice can be achieved\nwhen quantum gases are confined in a superradiant Fabry-Perot cavity. In\naddition to the discoveries of exotic phases, such as density wave ordered Mott\ninsulator and superfluid, a surprising kink structure is found in the slope of\nthe cavity strength as a function of the pumping strength. In this Letter, we\nshow that the appearance of such a kink is a manifestation of a liquid-gas like\ntransition between two superfluids with different densities. The slopes in the\nimmediate neighborhood of the kink become divergent at the liquid-gas critical\npoints and display a critical scaling law with a critical exponent 1 in the\nquantum critical region. Our predictions could be tested in current\nexperimental set-up.\n", "  We aim to study the formation and evolution of solar spicules by means of\nnumerical simulations of the solar atmosphere. With the use of newly developed\nJOANNA code, we numerically solve two-fluid (for ions + electrons and neutrals)\nequations in 2D Cartesian geometry. We follow the evolution of a spicule\ntriggered by the time-dependent signal in ion and neutral components of gas\npressure launched in the upper chromosphere. We use the potential magnetic\nfield, which evolves self-consistently, but mainly plays a passive role in the\ndynamics. Our numerical results reveal that the signal is steepened into a\nshock that propagates upward into the corona. The chromospheric cold and dense\nplasma lags behind this shock and rises into the corona with a mean speed of\n20-25 km s$^{-1}$. The formed spicule exhibits the upflow/downfall of plasma\nduring its total lifetime of around 3-4 minutes, and it follows the typical\ncharacteristics of a classical spicule, which is modeled by\nmagnetohydrodynamics. The simulated spicule consists of a dense and cold core\nthat is dominated by neutrals. The general dynamics of ion and neutral spicules\nare very similar to each other. Minor differences in those dynamics result in\ndifferent widths of both spicules with increasing rarefaction of the ion\nspicule in time.\n", "  Polarization during a lunar eclipse is a forgotten mystery. Coyne & Pellicori\n(1970) reported the detection of significant polarization during the lunar\neclipse on 1968 April 13. Multiple scattering during the first transmission\nthrough the Earth's atmosphere was suggested as a possible cause of the\npolarization, but no conclusive determination was made. No further\ninvestigations on polarization during a lunar eclipse are known. We revisit\nthis mystery with an interest in possible application to extrasolar planets, if\nplanetary transmitted light is indeed polarized, it may be possible to\ninvestigate an exoplanet atmosphere using \"transit polarimetry.\" Here we report\nresults of the first spectropolarimetry for the Moon during a lunar eclipse on\n2015 April 4. We observed polarization degrees of 2-3% at wavelengths of\n500-600 nm, in addition, an enhanced feature was detected at the O$_2$ A band\nnear 760 nm. The observed time variation and wavelength dependence are\nconsistent with an explanation of polarization caused by double scattering\nduring the first transmission through the Earth's atmosphere, accompanied by\nlatitudinal atmospheric inhomogeneity. Transit polarimetry for exoplanets may\nbe useful to detect O$_2$ gas and to probe the latitudinal atmospheric\ninhomogeneity, and it is thus worthy of serious consideration.\n", "  We investigate the restructuring of the magnetic field in sunspots associated\nwith two flares: the X6.5 flare on 6 December 2006 and the X2.2 flare on 15\nFebruary 2011. The observed changes were evaluated with respect to the\nso-called twist-removal model, in which helicity (twist) is removed from the\ncorona as the result of an eruption. Since no vector magnetograms were\navailable for the X6.5 flare, we applied the azimuthal symmetry approach to\nline-of-sight magnetograms to reconstruct the pseudo-vector magnetic field and\ninvestigate the changes in average twist and inclination of magnetic field in\nthe sunspot around the time of the flare. For the X2.2 flare, results from the\nfull vector magnetograms were compared with the pseudo-vector field data. For\nboth flares, the data show changes consistent with the twist-removal scenario.\nWe also evaluate the validity of the azimuthal symmetry approach on simple\nisolated round sunspots. In general, the derivations based on the azimuthal\nsymmetry approach agree with true-vector field data though we find that even\nfor symmetric sunspots the distribution of the magnetic field may deviate from\nan axially symmetric distribution.\n", "  The shape evolutions of the pear-shaped nuclei $^{224}$Ra and even-even\n$^{144-154}$Ba with temperature are investigated by the finite-temperature\nrelativistic mean field theory with the treatment of pairing correlations by\nthe BCS approach. The free energy surfaces as well as the bulk properties\nincluding deformations, pairing gaps, excitation energy, and specific heat for\nthe global minimum are studied. For $^{224}$Ra, three discontinuities found in\nthe specific heat curve indicate the pairing transition at temperature 0.4 MeV,\nand two shape transitions at temperatures 0.9 and 1.0 MeV, namely one from\nquadrupole-octupole deformed to quadrupole deformed, and the other from\nquadrupole deformed to spherical. Furthermore, the gaps at $N=$136 and $Z=$88\nare responsible for stabilizing the octupole-deformed global minimum at low\ntemperatures. Similar pairing transition at $T\\sim$0.5 MeV and shape\ntransitions at $T$=0.5-2.2 MeV are found for even-even $^{144-154}$Ba. The\ntransition temperatures are roughly proportional to the corresponding\ndeformations at the ground states.\n", "  We investigate the process of spin squeezing in a ferromagnetic dipolar\nspin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate under the driven oneaxis twisting scheme, with\nemphasis on the detrimental effect of noisy environments (stray magnetic\nfields) which completely destroy the spin squeezing. By applying concatenated\ndynamical decoupling pulse sequences with a moderate bias magnetic field to\nsuppress the effect of the noisy environments, we faithfully reconstruct the\nspin squeezing process under realistic experimental conditions. Our\nnoise-resistant method is ready to be employed to generate the spin squeezed\nstate in a dipolar spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate and paves a feasible way to\nthe Heisenberg-limit quantum metrology\n", "  A polarization measurement carried out for the $\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(2S)$\nand $\\Upsilon(3S)$ mesons produced in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 7 and 8 TeV\nis presented. Data samples used for the polarization measurement were collected\nby the LHCb experiment during the 2011 and 2012 data taking runs with\nintegrated luminosities of 1 and 2 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. The measurement has\nbeen performed in three polarization frames, using an angular distribution\nanalysis of the $\\Upsilon\\to\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decays in the kinematic region of\nthe $\\Upsilon$ transverse momentum $p_{T}^{\\Upsilon}<30$ GeV/c and rapidity\n$2.2<y^{\\Upsilon}<4.5$. No large polarization is observed.\n", "  We present a model that unifies the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR),\nobtained through the hierarchical structure formation scenario, with the\n(Galactic) local star formation rate (SFR). It is possible to use the SFR to\ngenerate a CSFR mapping through the density probability distribution functions\n(PDFs) commonly used to study the role of turbulence in the star-forming\nregions of the Galaxy. We obtain a consistent mapping from redshift $z\\sim 20$\nup to the present ($z = 0$). Our results show that the turbulence exhibits a\ndual character, providing high values for the star formation efficiency\n($\\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle \\sim 0.32$) in the redshift interval $z\\sim 3.5-20$\nand reducing its value to $\\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle = 0.021$ at $z = 0$. The\nvalue of the Mach number ($\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm crit}$), from which\n$\\langle\\varepsilon\\rangle$ rapidly decreases, is dependent on both the\npolytropic index ($\\Gamma$) and the minimum density contrast of the gas. We\nalso derive Larson's first law associated with the velocity dispersion\n($\\langle V_{\\rm rms}\\rangle$) in the local star formation regions. Our model\nshows good agreement with Larson's law in the $\\sim 10-50\\,{\\rm pc}$ range,\nproviding typical temperatures $T_{0} \\sim 10-80\\,{\\rm K}$ for the gas\nassociated with star formation. As a consequence, dark matter halos of great\nmass could contain a number of halos of much smaller mass, and be able to form\nstructures similar to globular clusters. Thus, Larson's law emerges as a result\nof the very formation of large-scale structures, which in turn would allow the\nformation of galactic systems, including our Galaxy.\n", "  Cosmic rays provide an unique approach to study hadronic interactions at high\nenergies in the kinematic forward direction. The KASCADE air shower experiment\nwas the first to conduct quantitative tests of hadronic interactions with air\nshower data. A brief overview is given on results from KASCADE and its\nextension KASCADE-Grande with respect to investigations of hadronic\ninteractions and the properties of cosmic rays.\n", "  The paper proposes the method to analyze the internal dynamics of nanoscopic\nsystems by periodic modulation of the electrochemical potentials of the\nattached leads and measuring the time-averaged current. The idea is presented\nusing the example of the a double quantum dot coupled to one nonmagnetic and\none spin-polarized lead. The current flowing through the molecule is shown to\ndepend on both the frequency of the modulation and the exchange coupling\nbetween the electrons occupying the molecule. In particular, one can observe a\npronounced oscillatory behavior of the current-frequency dependence, which\nreveals the coherent oscillations between the spin states of the system.\n", "  We report on observation of the unusual kind of solar microflares, presumably\nassociated with the so-called \"topological trigger\" of magnetic reconnection,\nwhich was theoretically suggested long time ago by Gorbachev et al. (Sov. Ast.\n1988, v.32, p.308) but has not been clearly identified so far by observations.\nAs can be seen in pictures by Hinode SOT in CaII line, there may be a bright\nloop connecting two sunspots, which looks at the first sight just as a magnetic\nfield line connecting the opposite poles. However, a closer inspection of SDO\nHMI magnetograms shows that the respective arc is anchored in the regions of\nthe same polarity near the sunspot boundaries. Yet another peculiar feature is\nthat the arc flashes almost instantly as a thin strip and then begins to expand\nand decay, while the typical chromospheric flares in CaII line are much wider\nand propagate progressively in space. A qualitative explanation of the unusual\nflare can be given by the above-mentioned model of topological trigger. Namely,\nthere are such configurations of the magnetic sources on the surface of\nphotosphere that their tiny displacements result in the formation and fast\nmotion of a 3D null point along the arc located well above the plane of the\nsources. So, such a null point can quickly ignite a magnetic reconnection along\nthe entire its trajectory. Pictorially, this can be presented as flipping the\nso-called two-dome magnetic-field structure (which is just the reason why such\nmechanism was called topological). The most important prerequisite for the\ndevelopment of topological instability in the two-dome structure is a cruciform\narrangement of the magnetic sources in its base, and this condition is really\nsatisfied in the case under consideration.\n", "  We use KMOS Deep Survey (KDS) galaxies, combined with results from a range of\nspectroscopic studies in the literature, to investigate the evolution of the\nstellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation since z ~ 4. We determine the slope and\nnormalisation of the local rotation-velocity -- stellar-mass (Vc - $M_{\\star}$)\nrelationship using a reference sample of local spiral galaxies; thereafter we\nfix the slope, and focus on the evolution of velocity normalisation with\nredshift. The rotation-dominated KDS galaxies at z ~ 3.5 have rotation\nvelocities ~ -0.1 dex lower than local reference galaxies at fixed stellar\nmass. By fitting 16 distant comparison samples spanning 0 < z < 3 (containing ~\n1200 galaxies), we show that the size and sign of the inferred Vc offset\ndepends sensitively on the fraction of the parent samples used in the\nTully-Fisher analysis, and how strictly the criterion of 'rotation dominated'\nis enforced. Confining attention to subsamples of galaxies that are especially\n'disky' results in a consistent positive offset in Vc of ~ +0.1 dex, however\nthese galaxies are not representative of the evolving-disk population at z > 1.\nWe investigate the addition of pressure support, traced by intrinsic velocity\ndispersion ($\\sigma_{int}$) to the KDS dynamical mass budget by adopting a\n'total' effective velocity of form $V_{tot} = (Vc^{2} +\n4.0\\sigma_{int}^{2})^{0.5}$. The rotation-dominated and dispersion-dominated\nKDS galaxies fall on the same locus in the total-velocity versus stellar-mass\nplane, removing the need for debate over the precise selection threshold for\nrotation-dominated galaxies. The comparison sample offsets are in the range\n+0.08 to +0.15 dex in total-velocity zero-point (-0.30 to -0.55 dex in\nstellar-mass zero-point) from the local Tully-Fisher relation at z > 1,\nconsistent with steady evolution of the ratio of dynamical to stellar mass with\ncosmic time.\n", "  We explore the use of weak quantum measurements for single-qubit quantum\nstate tomography processes. Weak measurements are those where the coupling\nbetween the qubit and the measurement apparatus is weak; this results in the\nquantum state being disturbed less than in the case of a projective\nmeasurement. We employ a weak measurement tomography protocol developed by Das\nand Arvind, which they claim offers a new method of extracting information from\nquantum systems. We test the Das-Arvind scheme for various measurement\nstrengths, and ensemble sizes, and reproduce their results using a sequential\nstochastic simulation. Lastly, we place these results in the context of current\nunderstanding of weak and projective measurements.\n", "  In this paper we propose definitions and examples of categorical enhancements\nof the data involved in the $2d$-$4d$ wall-crossing formulas which generalize\nboth Cecotti-Vafa and Kontsevich-Soibelman motivic wall-crossing formulas.\n", "  Exclusive light meson production processes possible to be measured at RHIC\nand LHC accelerators are briefly described. This includes Pomeron and photon\ninduced continuum of pions and kaons as well as $f_0$ and $\\rho^0$ resonant\nproduction. Next, GenEx, a new Monte Carlo generator recently developed in\nCracow, is presented. Its purpose is to generate resonant and non-resonant pion\nand kaon production and diffractive Bremsstrahlung. Its future development will\ntake into account spin (polarization) effects and simulate corrections due to\nabsorption and re-scattering.\n", "  Giant stellar clumps are ubiquitous in high-redshift galaxies. They are\nthought to play an important role in the build-up of galactic bulges and as\ndiagnostics of star formation feedback in galactic discs. Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) blank field imaging surveys have estimated that these clumps\nhave masses up to 10$^{9.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and linear sizes larger than ~1 kpc.\nRecently, gravitational lensing has also been used to get higher spatial\nresolution. However, both recent lensed observations and models suggest that\nthe clumps properties may be overestimated by the limited resolution of\nstandard imaging techniques. A definitive proof of this observational bias is\nnevertheless still missing. Here we investigate directly the effect of\nresolution on clump properties by analysing multiple gravitationally-lensed\nimages of the same galaxy at different spatial resolutions, down to 30 pc. We\nshow that the typical mass and size of giant clumps, generally observed at\n$\\sim$1 kpc resolution in high-redshift galaxies, are systematically\noverestimated. The high spatial resolution data, only enabled by strong\ngravitational lensing using currently available facilities, support smaller\nscales of clump formation by fragmentation of the galactic gas disk via\ngravitational instabilities.\n", "  We study a model of strongly-correlated systems that incorporates phases such\nas Fermi liquids, non-Fermi liquids, and superconductivity, in addition to\npotential intertwined orders. The model describes Fermi surfaces of spinful\nelectron gas or electron liquid coupled to bosons via an intermediate gauge\nfield. Effectively, the coupling imposes constraints and interactions between\nthe fermion spin and the local boson density. This grants the bosons the\nmeaning as the Schwinger boson of the magnetic order and allows us to probe a\nlarger phase space, rather than around the quantum critical point. We design\nthe initial model so that after the boson and gauge fields are integrated out\nexactly, the resulting fermion-only effective theory only consists of several\nlocal interactions, allowing controlled weak-coupling interpretation for\ncertain parameter regions. Consequently, we find a non-Fermi liquid whose\ndegrees of freedom in the effective theory take the form of an \\emph{emergent}\nFermi surface that has a different Luttinger volume from the original fermions,\ntherefore explicitly violates the Luttinger theorem. Further, this allows a\n$d$-wave superconducting instability if the effective interacting induced by\nboson coupling is in the relevant pairing channel. When the emergent Fermi\nsurface undergoes a Lifshitz transition, the carrier type changes. In addition,\nwe attribute the Mott insulating behavior in the strong coupling limit to the\nloss of emergent Fermi surface and argue the possibility of coexisting magnetic\norder. Our effective theory also suggests the possibility of charge density\nwaves as a consequence of \\emph{effective} strong repulsion and is independent\nof the Fermi-surface-nesting scenario. We discuss the possible optimal\nconditions for higher superconducting transition temperature and potential\nrelevances and implications for realistic materials.\n", "  We analyze the parsec-scale jet kinematics from 2007 June to 2013 January of\na sample of $\\gamma$-ray bright blazars monitored roughly monthly with the Very\nLong Baseline Array at 43~GHz. In a total of 1929 images, we measure apparent\nspeeds of 252 emission knots in 21 quasars, 12 BL~Lacertae objects (BLLacs),\nand 3 radio galaxies, ranging from 0.02$c$ to 78$c$; 21\\% of the knots are\nquasi-stationary. Approximately 1/3 of the moving knots execute non-ballistic\nmotions, with the quasars exhibiting acceleration along the jet within 5~pc\n(projected) of the core, and knots in the BLLacs tending to decelerate near the\ncore. Using apparent speeds of components and timescales of variability from\ntheir light curves, we derive physical parameters of 120 superluminal knots,\nincluding variability Doppler factors, Lorentz factors, and viewing angles. We\nestimate the half-opening angle of each jet based on the projected opening\nangle and scatter of intrinsic viewing angles of knots. We determine\ncharacteristic values of physical parameters for each jet and AGN class based\non the range of values obtained for individual features. We calculate intrinsic\nbrightness temperatures of the cores, $T_{\\rm b,int}^{\\rm core}$, at all\nepochs, finding that the radio galaxies usually maintain equipartition\nconditions in the cores, while $\\sim$30\\% of $T_{\\rm b,int}^{\\rm core}$\nmeasurements in the quasars and BLLacs deviate from equipartition values by a\nfactor $>$10. This probably occurs during transient events connected with\nactive states. In the Appendix we briefly describe the behavior of each blazar\nduring the period analyzed.\n", "  Recently it was shown that classical \"relativistic\" particle dynamics was\nimplicit in physics going back to Maxwell. The demonstration utilized a simple\nmodification of a 1906 thought experiment by which Einstein established the\nmass equivalence of energy, independently of the relativity postulates. The\nmodified thought experiment leads directly to correct expressions for the\nmomentum and kinetic energy of a particle at high speed. In the present paper,\none additional ingredient is added, namely, the Bohr quantization rule of the\nold quantum theory. It is found that a semi-classical model of a hydrogen atom\nand a hydrogen molecule ion exhibit, respectively, time dilation and length\ncontraction.\n", "  Potassium-40 (${}^{40}$K) is a background in many rare-event searches and may\nwell play a role in interpreting results from the DAMA dark-matter search. The\nelectron-capture decay of ${}^{40}$K to the ground state of ${}^{40}$Ar has\nnever been measured and contributes an unknown amount of background. The KDK\n(potassium decay) collaboration will measure this branching ratio using a\n${}^{40}$K source, an X-ray detector, and the Modular Total Absorption\nSpectrometer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n", "  This is a brief review of various families of coherent and squeezed states\n(and their generalizations) for a charged particle in a magnetic field, that\nhave been constructed for the past 50 years. Although the main attention is\npaid to the Gaussian states, various families of non-Gaussian states are also\ndiscussed, and the list of relevant references is provided.\n", "  In this paper, we proposed an procedure to construct the completion of the\nintegrable system by adding a perturbation to the generalized matrix problem,\nwhich can be used to continuous integrable couplings, discrete integrable\ncouplings and super integrable couplings. As example, we construct the\ncompletion of the Kaup-Newell (KN) integrable coupling, the\nWadati-Konno-Ichikawa (WKI) integrable couplingsis, vector\nAblowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (vAKNS) integrable couplings, the Volterra\nintegrable couplings, Dirac type integrable couplings and NLS-mKdV type\nintegrable couplings.\n", "  Aims. We present a multiwavelength study of two southern Galactic H II\nregions G346.056-0.021 and G346.077-0.056 which are located at a distance of\n10.9 kpc. The distribution of ionized gas, cold and warm dust and the stellar\npopulation associated with the two H II regions are studied in detail using\nmeasurements at near-infrared, mid-infrared, far-infrared, submillimeter and\nradio wavelengths.\n  Methods. The radio continuum maps at 1280 and 610 MHz were obtained using the\nGiant Metrewave Radio Telescope to probe the ionized gas. The dust temperature,\ncolumn density and dust emissivity maps were generated by using modified\nblackbody fits in the far-infrared wavelength range 160 - 500 {\\mu}m. Various\nnear- and mid-infrared colour and magnitude criteria were adopted to identify\ncandidate ionizing star(s) and the population of young stellar objects in the\nassociated field.\n  Results. The radio maps reveal the presence diffuse ionized emission\ndisplaying distinct cometary morphologies. The 1280 MHz flux densities\ntranslate to ZAMS spectral types in the range O7.5V - O7V and O8.5V - O8V for\nthe ionizing stars of G346.056-0.021 and G346.077-0.056, respectively. A few\npromising candidate ionizing star(s) are identified using near-infrared\nphotometric data. The column density map shows the presence of a large, dense\ndust clump enveloping G346.077-0.056. The dust temperature map shows peaks\ntowards the two H II regions. The submillimetre image shows the presence of two\nadditional clumps one being associated with G346.056-0.021. The masses of the\nclumps are estimated to range between {\\sim} 1400 to 15250 M{\\sun}. Based on\nsimple analytic calculations and the correlation seen between the ionized gas\ndistribution and the local density structure, the observed cometary morphology\nin the radio maps is better explained invoking the champagne-flow model.\n", "  Quantum coherence is a fundamental characteristic to distinguish quantum\nsystems from their classical counterparts. Though quantum coherence persists in\nisolated non-interacting systems, interactions inevitably lead to decoherence,\nwhich is in general believed to cause the lost of quantum correlations. Here,\nwe show that, accompanying to the single-particle decoherence, interactions\nbuild up quantum correlations on the two-, three-, and multi-particle levels.\nUsing the quantitative solutions of the quantum dynamics of a condensate\noccupying two modes, such as two bands of an optical lattice, we find out that\nsuch dynamically emergent multi-particle correlations not only reveal how\ninteractions control the quantum coherence of a many-body system in a highly\nintriguing means, but also evince the rise of exotic fragmented condensates,\nwhich are difficult to access at the ground state. We further develop a generic\ninterferometry that can be used in experiments to measure high order\ncorrelation functions directly.\n", "  The electronic and magneto transport properties of reduced anatase TiO2\nepitaxial thin films are analyzed considering various polaronic effects.\nUnexpectedly, with increasing carrier concentration, the mobility increases,\nwhich rarely happens in common metallic systems. We find that the screening of\nthe electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling by excess carriers is necessary to explain\nthis unusual dependence. We also find that the magnetoresistance (MR) could be\ndecomposed into a linear and a quadratic component, separately characterizing\nthe transport and trap behavior of carriers as a function of temperature. The\nvarious transport behaviors could be organized into a single phase diagram\nwhich clarifies the nature of large polaron in this material.\n", "  The study of variations in solar activity is important for understanding the\nunderlying mechanism of solar activity and for predicting the level of activity\nin view of the activity impact on space weather and global climate. Here we\nhave used the amplitudes (the peak values of the 13-month smoothed\ninternational sunspot number) of Solar Cycles 1-24 to predict the relative\namplitudes of the solar cycles during the rising phase of the upcoming\nGleissberg cycle. We fitted a cosine function to the amplitudes and times of\nthe solar cycles after subtracting a linear fit of the amplitudes. The best\ncosine fit shows overall properties (periods, maxima, minima, etc.) of\nGleissberg cycles, but with large uncertainties. We obtain a pattern of the\nrising phase of the upcoming Gleissberg cycle, but there is considerable\nambiguity. Using the epochs of violations of the Gnevyshev-Ohl rule (G-O rule)\nand the `tentative inverse G-O rule' of solar cycles during the period\n1610-2015, and also using the epochs where the orbital angular momentum of the\nSun is steeply decreased during the period 1600-2099, we infer that Solar Cycle\n25 will be weaker than Cycle 24. Cycles 25 and 26 will have almost same\nstrength, and their epochs are at the minimum between the current and upcoming\nGleissberg cycles. In addition, Cycle 27 is expected to be stronger than Cycle\n26 and weaker than Cycle 28, and Cycle 29 is expected to be stronger than both\nCycles 28 and 30. The maximum of Cycle 29 is expected to represent the next\nGleissberg maximum. Our analysis also suggests a much lower value (30-40) for\nthe maximum amplitude of the upcoming Cycle 25.\n", "  A software for processing sets of full-color images of biological tissue\nhistological sections is developed. We used histological sections obtained by\nthe method of high-precision layer-by-layer grinding of frozen biological\ntissues. The software allows restoring the image of the tissue for an arbitrary\ncross-section of the tissue sample. Thus, our method is designed to create a\nfull-color 3D reconstruction of the biological tissue structure. The resolution\nof 3D reconstruction is determined by the quality of the initial histological\nsections. The newly developed technology available to us provides a resolution\nof up to 5 - 10 {\\mu}m in three dimensions.\n", "  A new measure based on the tripartite information diagram is proposed for\nidentifying quantum discord in tripartite systems. The proposed measure\ngeneralizes the mutual information underlying discord from bipartite to\ntripartite systems, and utilizes both one-particle and two-particle projective\nmeasurements to reveal the characteristics of the tripartite quantum discord.\nThe feasibility of the proposed measure is demonstrated by evaluating the\ntripartite quantum discord for systems with states close to\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger, W, and biseparable states. In addition, the\nconnections between tripartite quantum discord and two other quantum\ncorrelations---namely genuine tripartite entanglement and genuine tripartite\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering---are briefly discussed. The present study\nconsiders the case of quantum discord in tripartite systems. However, the\nproposed framework can be readily extended to general N-partite systems.\n", "  The polarization controlled optical signal routing has many important\napplications in photonics such as polarization beam splitter. By using\ntwo-dimensional transmission lines with lumped elements, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the selective excitation of guided modes in waveguides composed of\ntwo kinds of single-negative metamaterials. A localized, circularly polarized\nemitter placed near the interface of the two kinds of single-negative\nmetamaterials only couples with one guided mode with a specific propagating\ndirection determined by the polarization handedness of the source. Moreover,\nthis optical spin-orbit locking phenomenon, also called the photonic spin Hall\neffect, is robust against interface fluctuations, which may be very useful in\nthe manipulation of electromagnetic signals.\n", "  ThunderKAT is the image-plane transients programme for MeerKAT. The goal as\noutlined in 2010, and still today, is to find, identify and understand\nhigh-energy astrophysical processes via their radio emission (often in concert\nwith observations at other wavelengths). Through a comprehensive and\ncomplementary programme of surveying and monitoring Galactic synchrotron\ntransients (across a range of compact accretors and a range of other explosive\nphenomena) and exploring distinct populations of extragalactic synchrotron\ntransients (microquasars, supernovae and possibly yet unknown transient\nphenomena) - both from direct surveys and commensal observations - we will\nrevolutionise our understanding of the dynamic and explosive transient radio\nsky. As well as performing targeted programmes of our own, we have made\nagreements with the other MeerKAT large survey projects (LSPs) that we will\nalso search their data for transients. This commensal use of the other surveys,\nwhich remains one of our key programme goals in 2016, means that the combined\nMeerKAT LSPs will produce by far the largest GHz-frequency radio transient\nprogramme to date.\n", "  The problem of a particle of mass m in the field of the inverse square\npotential is studied in quantum mechanics with a generalized uncertainty\nprinciple, characterized by the existence of a minimal length. Using the\ncoordinate representation, for a specific form of the generalized uncertainty\nrelation, we solve the deformed Schr\\\"odinger equation analytically in terms of\nconfluent Heun functions. We explicitly show the regularizing effect of the\nminimal length on the singularity of the potential. We discuss the problem of\nbound states in detail and we derive an expression for the energy spectrum in a\nnatural way from the square integrability condition; the results are in\ncomplete agreement with the literature.\n", "  In the recent paper, Ref. 1, the l-waves Schr\\\"odinger equation for the\nCornell's potential is solved in quantum mechanics with a generalized\nuncertainty principle by following Ref. 2. It is showed here that the approach\nof Ref. 2 can only be used for the s-waves, and then the solution given in Ref.\n1 would be true only in the special case l=0. Furthermore, it is highlighted\nthat the abstract and the conclusion of Ref. 1 do not accurately reflect the\nresults of the paper.\n", "  Magnon-polaritons are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles originating from the\nstrong coupling between magnons and photons. They have emerged as a potential\ncandidate for implementing quantum transducers and memories. Owing to the\ndampings of both photons and magnons, the polaritons have limited lifetimes.\nHowever, stationary magnon-polariton states can be reached by a dynamical\nbalance between pumping and losses, so the intrinsical nonequilibrium system\nmay be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Here we design a tunable\ncavity quantum electrodynamics system with a small ferromagnetic sphere in a\nmicrowave cavity and engineer the dissipations of photons and magnons to create\ncavity magnon-polaritons which have non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies. By\ntuning the magnon-photon coupling strength, we observe the polaritonic coherent\nperfect absorption and demonstrate the phase transition at the exceptional\npoint. Our experiment offers a novel macroscopic quantum platform to explore\nthe non-Hermitian physics of the cavity magnon-polaritons.\n", "  We review the essentials of the formalism of quantum mechanics based on a\ndeformed Heisenbeg algebra, leading to the existence of a minimal length scale.\nWe compute in this context, the energy spectra of the pseudoharmonic oscillator\nand Kratzer potentials by using a perturbative approach. We derive the\nmolecular constants, which characterize the vibration--rotation energy levels\nof diatomic molecules, and investigate the effect of the minimal length on each\nof these parameters for both potentials. We confront our result to experimental\ndata for the hydrogen molecule to estimate an order of magnitude of this\nfundamental scale in molecular physics.\n", "  In recent years, attempts to generalize lattice gauge theories to model\ntopological order have been carried out through the so called $2$-gauge\ntheories. These have opened the door to interesting new models and new\ntopological phases which are not described by previous schemes of\nclassification. In this paper we show that we can go beyond the $2$-gauge\nconstruction when considering chain complexes of abelian groups. Based on\nelements of homological algebra we are able to greatly simplify already known\nconstructions for abelian theories under a single all encompassing framework.\nFurthermore, this formalism allows us to systematize the computation of the\ncorresponding topological degeneracies of the ground states and establishes a\nconnection between them and a known cohomology, which conveniently\ncharacterizes them with a suitable set of quantum numbers.\n", "  Although recent advances have made it possible to manipulate electromagnetic\nand acoustic wavefronts with sub-wavelength metasurface slabs, the design of\nelastodynamic counterparts remains challenging. We introduce a novel but simple\ndesign approach to control SV-waves in elastic solids. The proposed metasurface\ncan be fabricated by cutting an array of aligned parallel cracks in a solid\nsuch that the materials between the cracks act as plate-like waveguides in the\nbackground medium. The plate array is capable of modulating the phase change of\nSV-wave while keeping the phase of P-wave unchanged. An analytical model for\nSV-wave incidence is established to calculate the transmission coefficient and\nthe transmitted phase through the plate-like waveguide explicitly. A complete\n$2\\pi$ range of phase delay is achieved by selecting different thicknesses for\nthe plates. An elastic metasurface for splitting SV- and P-waves is designed\nand demonstrated using full wave finite element (FEM) simulations. Two\nmetasurfaces for focusing plane and cylindrical SV-waves are also presented.\n", "  This chapter presents a descriptive and illustrative account of phase\nbehavior in the seven naturally occurring petroleum fluids and ties all the\nknown eleven phase-transition concepts in a unified narrative. The figures and\ntables contained in this report are designed so that they could effectively\nsupport the discussion about molecular make-up of petroleum fluids, P- and\nT-effects on phase behavior and phase transition points.\n  Seven naturally occurring hydrocarbon fluids are known as petroleum fluids.\nThey include, in the order of their fluidity, natural gas, gas-condensate\n(NGL), light crude, intermediate crude, heavy oil, tar sand and oil shale. In\nthis report we present a generalized description of the various phase\ntransitions, which may occur in petroleum fluids with emphasis on heavy\norganics deposition.\n  At first the nature of every petroleum fluid is presented. Their constituents\nincluding their socalled impurities are identified and categorized. Heavy\nfractions in petroleum fluids are discussed and their main families of\nconstituents are presented including petroleum wax, diamondoids, asphaltenes\nand petroleum resins. Then the generalized petroleum fluids phase behavior is\ndiscussed in light of the known theory of phase transitions. The effects of\nvariations of composition, temperature and pressure on the phase behavior of\npetroleum fluids are introduced. Finally eleven distinct phase-transition\npoints of petroleum fluids are presented and their relation with state\nvariables and constituents of petroleum fluids are identified. This report is\nto generalize and relate phase behaviors of all the seven naturally occurring\npetroleum fluids into a unified perspective. This work is the basis to develop\na comprehensive computational model for phase behavior prediction of all the\npetroleum fluids, which is of major interest in the petroleum industry.\n", "  Observations of KIC 8462852 (aka Boyajian's Star) reveal a yearlong fade\npattern that is remarkably similar to the fade pattern derived from Kepler\nmission observations. The ground-based observations reported here can be\ndescribed as a gradual fade that ended in late 2016 with the beginning of a\nyearlong U-shaped fade of 1.1 percent. Near the end of this U-shaped fade a\nseries of very brief dips occurred. The Kepler data exhibit a similar pattern\n1600 days earlier, except with an abrupt end of observations before the U-shape\nrecovery. Observations lasting many years are needed, especially during our\npredicted repeat of the U-shape and short dip pattern in 2021.\n", "  This paper proposes a feedback guidance law to move the instantaneous impact\npoint (IIP) of a rocket to a desired location. Analytic expressions relating\nthe time derivatives of an IIP with the external acceleration of the rocket are\nintroduced. A near time-optimal feedback-form guidance law to determine the\ndirection of the acceleration for guiding the IIP is developed using the\nde-rivative expressions. The effectiveness of the proposed guidance law, in\ncomparison with the results of open-loop trajectory optimization, was\ndemonstrated through IIP pointing case studies.\n", "  In this work we have revisited a few principal formulae about one-tangle of\nmultipartite entanglement of fermionic systems in noninertial frames calculated\nin the paper [Phys. Rev. A 83, 022314(2011)] and given their correct\nexpressions.\n", "  The importance of the first-class constraint algebra of general relativity is\nnot limited just by its self-contained description of the gauge nature of\nspacetime, but it also provides conditions to properly evolve the geometry by\nselecting a gauge only once throughout the whole evolution of a gravitational\nsystem. This must be a property of all background independent theories. In this\npaper we consider gravitational theories which arise from deformations of the\nfundamental canonical variables of general relativity where the proposed\ndeformations are inspired by modifications of gravity. These variable\ndeformations result in new theories when the deformation is not a canonical\ntransformation. The new theory must preserve the first-class structure of the\nalgebra, which is a non-trivial restriction for generic deformations. In this\nvein we present a general deformation scheme along with consistency conditions,\nso that the algebra of constraints is still satisfied in the resulting theory.\nThis is illustrated both in metric theory as well as in tetrad theory.\n", "  The successful LHC operation suggests going beyond the search of excess of\nevents for the quest of new physics. We demonstrate that the eight multipole\nparameters describing the spin state of the W or Z bosons are able to\ndisentangle their hidden production mechanism. They can be separately extracted\nfrom well defined angular asymmetries in the leptonic distribution of boson\ndecays. The discriminating power of this analysis is well illustrated by: (i)\npolarised top quark decays, (ii) two body decay of heavy resonances, (iii)\nDrell-Yan production of Z plus jets, (iv) Z boson plus missing transverse\nenergy.\n", "  Massive neutrinos demand to ask whether they are Dirac or Majorana particles.\nMajorana neutrinos are an irrefutable proof of physics beyond the Standard\nModel. Neutrinoless double electron capture is not a process but a virtual\n$\\Delta L=2$ mixing between a parent $^AZ$ atom and a daughter $^A(Z-2)$\nexcited atom with two electron holes. As a mixing between two neutral atoms and\nthe observable signal in terms of emitted two-hole X-rays, the strategy,\nexperimental signature and background are different from neutrinoless double\nbeta decay. The mixing is resonantly enhanced for almost degeneracy and, under\nthese conditions, there is no irreducible background from the standard\ntwo-neutrino channel. We reconstruct the natural time history of a nominally\nstable parent atom since its production either by nature or in the laboratory.\nAfter the time periods of atom oscillations and the decay of the short-lived\ndaughter atom, at observable times the relevant \"stationary\" states are the\nmixed metastable long-lived state and the short-lived excited state, as well as\nthe ground state of the daughter atom. Their natural population inversion is\nmost appropriate for exploiting the bosonic nature of the observed X-rays by\nmeans of stimulating X-ray beams. Among different observables of the atom\nMajorana mixing, we include the enhanced rate of stimulated X-ray emission from\nthe long-lived metastable state by a high-intensity X-ray beam. A gain factor\nof 100 can be envisaged in a facility like European XFEL.\n", "  A semi-analytical study of the dynamics of incompressible flow of a Newtonian\nfluid past a circular cylinder with zero surface shear stress has been\nperformed. Essentially, the modified flow field is considered to be a perturbed\nflow field over the irrotational flow description around a circular cylinder in\nan uniform cross flow. At finite Reynolds number, the perturbation over\nirrotational flow field is confined within a thin boundary layer, rear\nstagnation and wake regions. Equations governing the flow-field in boundary\nlayer are linearized Navier-Stokes equations which is solved by adopting\nanalytical route. Solution is shown to be superposition of infinite\nself-similar terms. Behind the circular cylinder, a stagnation region is formed\nwhere the perturbation and irrotational flow velocity components are shown to\nbe of equal order. Vorticity produced in boundary layer is convected downstream\nthrough stagnation region to form a narrow wake. Similar to boundary layer\nanalysis, governing equation in wake is also linearized to facilitate the\nanalytical study. Solution in wake region is obtained by matching the solution\nfrom boundary layer near the stagnation region. Far wake solution is shown to\nbe consistent with the leading order drag coefficient estimated from the\nmomentum deficit in the far wake. Next, drag coefficient is estimated by\ncalculating the net-dissipation over the entire flow field. Asymptotic\nexpansion of drag coefficient in terms of boundary layer thickness is shown to\nhave a logarithmic singularity. We show that at very high Reynolds number, flow\npast a circular cylinder with shear-free boundary will cause a net increase in\ndissipation of energy over the viscous irrotational flow, which stands in stark\ncontrast to the case of spherical geometry (Moore[1]). Results from present\nanalysis is validated against computational results.\n", "  Several multiscale methods account for sub-grid scale features using coarse\nscale basis functions. For example, in the Multiscale Finite Volume method the\ncoarse scale basis functions are obtained by solving a set of local problems\nover dual-grid cells. We introduce a data-driven approach for the estimation of\nthese coarse scale basis functions. Specifically, we employ a neural network\npredictor fitted using a set of solution samples from which it learns to\ngenerate subsequent basis functions at a lower computational cost than solving\nthe local problems. The computational advantage of this approach is realized\nfor uncertainty quantification tasks where a large number of realizations has\nto be evaluated. We attribute the ability to learn these basis functions to the\nmodularity of the local problems and the redundancy of the permeability patches\nbetween samples. The proposed method is evaluated on elliptic problems yielding\nvery promising results.\n", "  Polaritons in 2D and van der Waals (vdW) materials have been investigated in\nseveral recent works as an innovative platform for light-matter interaction,\nrich of new physical phenomena.Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN), in particular,\nis an out of plane anisotropic material (while it is in-plane isotropic) with\ntwo very strong phonon polaritons bands where the permittivity becomes\nnegative. In the first restrahlen band (RS1, 780-830 cm-1) the relative out of\nplane permittivity is negative, while in the second restrahlen band (RS2,\n1370-1610 cm-1) the relative in-plane permittivity is negative. Due to these\noptical properties, thin h-BN flakes support guided modes which have been\nobserved experimentally both via far field and near field methods. In this\nwork, we show how selectively excite the more confined modes in the RS1 and RS2\nbands. The supported guided modes have phase and group velocities respectively\ntens and hundreds of times slower than the speed of light. We also show the\npossibility of full hyperspectral nano-imaging of modes in RS1 band by means of\nphoto-induced force microscopy (PiFM). Moreover, a direct comparison of (PiFM)\nand scattering-type near-field microscopy (s-SNOM) is obtained by imaging the\nmodes of the RS2 band with both techniques implemented on the same platform.\nThe possibility of addressing ultraslow (ultraconfined) polaritonic modes of\nh-BN crystal flakes together with the possibility of optical nano-imaging in\nboth the restrahlen bands have many innovative aspects that can lead to\nunprecedented schemes for strong light-matter interaction, slow and confined\nlight.\n", "  Employing density functional theory based calculations, we investigate\nstructural, vibrational and strain-dependent electronic properties of an\nultra-thin CdTe crystal structure that can be de- rived from its bulk\ncounterpart. It is found that this ultra-thin crystal has an 8-atom primitive\nunit cell with considerable surface reconstructions. Dynamic stability of the\nstructure is predicted based on its calculated vibrational spectrum. Electronic\nband structure calculations reveal that both electrons and holes in single\nlayer CdTe possess anisotropic in-plane masses and mobilities. Moreover, we\nshow that the ultra-thin CdTe has some interesting electromechanical features,\nsuch as strain-dependent anisotropic variation of the band gap value, and its\nrapid increase under per- pendicular compression. The direct band gap\nsemiconducting nature of the ultra-thin CdTe crystal remains unchanged under\nall types of applied strain. With a robust and moderate direct band gap,\nsingle-layer CdTe is a promising material for nanoscale strain dependent device\napplications.\n", "  Coulomb effects on charged pion transverse momentum spectra produced in Au+Au\ncollisions at RHIC-BES energies are investigated. From these spectra the\n{\\pi}-/{\\pi}+ ratios as a function of transverse momentum are obtained and used\nto extract the Coulomb kick (a momentum change due to Coulomb interaction) and\ninitial pion ratio for three different collision energies and various\ncentrality classes. The Coulomb kick shows a decrease with the increase of beam\nenergy and a clear centrality dependence, with larger values for the most\ncentral collisions. The results are connected with the kinetic freeze-out\ndynamics and discussed.\n", "  1I/'Oumuamua, formerly known as A/2017 U1, is a sizable body currently\npassing through the solar system. It is generally considered to be a rocky\nasteroid-like object that came from another planetary system in the Milky Way.\nWe point out that 1I/'Oumuamua may instead be a chunk of dark matter, a\n\"macro,\" possibly as massive as $10^{25}$g if it is of nuclear density. If so,\nthen its passage will have caused measurable deviations in the orbits of\nMercury, the Earth and Moon.\n", "  Mathematical models are used extensively for diverse tasks including\nanalysis, optimization, and decision making. Frequently, those models are\nprincipled but imperfect representations of reality. This is either due to\nincomplete physical description of the underlying phenomenon (simplified\ngoverning equations, defective boundary conditions, etc.), or due to numerical\napproximations (discretization, linearization, round-off error, etc.). Model\nmisspecification can lead to erroneous model predictions, and respectively\nsuboptimal decisions associated with the intended end-goal task. To mitigate\nthis effect, one can amend the available model using limited data produced by\nexperiments or higher fidelity models. A large body of research has focused on\nestimating explicit model parameters. This work takes a different perspective\nand targets the construction of a correction model operator with implicit\nattributes. We investigate the case where the end-goal is inversion and\nillustrate how appropriate choices of properties imposed upon the correction\nand corrected operator lead to improved end-goal insights.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the perturbed Laguerre unitary ensemble described\nby the weight function of $$w(x,t)=(x+t)^{\\lambda}x^{\\alpha}e^{-x}$$ with $\nx\\geq 0,\\ t>0,\\ \\alpha>0,\\ \\alpha+\\lambda+1 > 0.$ The Deift-Zhou nonlinear\nsteepest descent approach is used to analyze the limit of the eigenvalue\ncorrelation kernel. It was found that under the double scaling $s=4nt,$ $n\\to\n\\infty,$ $t\\to 0 $ such that $s$ is positive and finite, at the hard edge, the\nlimiting kernel can be described by the $\\varphi$-function related to a\nthird-order nonlinear differential equation, which is equivalent to a\nparticular Painlev\\'e V (shorted as P$_{\\rm V}$) transcendent via a simple\ntransformation. Moreover, this P$_{\\rm V}$ transcendent is equivalent to a\ngeneral Painlev\\'e P$_{\\rm III}$ transcendent. For large $s,$ the P$_{\\rm V}$\nkernel reduces to the Bessel kernel $\\mathbf{J}_{\\alpha+\\lambda}.$ For small\n$s,$ the P$_{\\rm V}$ kernel reduces to another Bessel kernel\n$\\mathbf{J}_\\alpha.$ At the soft edge, the limiting kernel is the Airy kernel\nas the classical Laguerre weight.\n", "  A new probabilistic model for protons has been created using episode\nintegrated fluences. This model will allow the user to choose a mission start\ndate, mission duration, and confidence level to construct a mission-specific,\nbounding case spectrum for proton fluences at a distance of 1 $AU$ from the\nsun. A new database of episode integrated fluences will be created for this\nmodel. The database will contain 29 channels that span the energy range\n0.88-485 $MeV$. This database will cover the period from November 1, 1973 to\nDecember 31, 2013, making it the largest database on solar activity.\n", "  We demonstrate efficient, low power, continuous-wave four-wave mixing in the\nC-band, using a high index doped silica glass micro ring resonator having a\nQ-factor of 1.2 million. A record high conversion efficiency for this kind of\ndevice is achieved over a bandwidth of 20nm. We show theoretically that the\ncharacteristic low dispersion enables phase-matching over a bandwidth > 160nm.\n", "  In this review paper we introduce at first the cage nature of diamondoid\nmolecules, the variety of their crystalline lattice structures, the nature of\ntheir structural isomers, their stereoisomers, and their other molecular\nspecificities. The natural occurrence of diamondoids in petroleum fluids and\nhow they come to be present in such fluids is introduced. Field experiences of\nphase transitions and depositions as well as techniques for separation,\ndetection and measurement of diamondoids from petroleum fluids is presented and\ndiscussed. It is demonstrated that due to their six or more linking groups\ndiamondoids have found major applications as templates and as molecular\nbuilding blocks in polymers synthesis, nanotechnology, drug delivery, drug\ntargeting, DNA directed assembly, DNA-amino acid nanostructure formation and in\nhost-guest chemistry.\n", "  We calculate the spectral function in pseudoscalar (scalar) channel in the\nhigh temperature phase of QCD in presence of a background magnetic field.\nSpatial and temporal screening masses are determined from the long distance\nbehavior of the corresponding correlation functions.\n", "  A perturbation theory modification of the Flory-Huggins polymer solution\ntheory is presented. The proposed perturbation equation utilizes the results by\nTukur et al [J. Chem. Phys. 110 (7), 3463, 1999] for hard-sphere binary mixture\nat infinite size ratio. The resulting perturbation theory equations are used to\npredict properties of three different polymers with different molecular weights\nin different solvents. Comparison of the proposed perturbation calculations\nwith those of the Flory-Huggins theory and the experimental data indicate that\nthe proposed perturbation method appreciably improves prediction of polymer\nsolution properties especially at large polymer / solvent size ratios.\n", "  A new amplification method based on the optical Kerr instability is suggested\nand theoretically analyzed, with emphasis on the near to mid-infrared\nwavelength regime. Our analysis for CaF2 and KBr crystals shows that one to two\ncycle pulse amplification by 3-4 orders of magnitude in the wavelength range\nfrom 1-14 microns is feasible with currently available laser sources. At 14\nmicrons final output energies in the 0.05 mJ range are achievable corresponding\nto about 0.2-0.25% of the pump energy. The Kerr instability presents a\npromising process for the amplification of ultrashort mid-infrared pulses.\n", "  We provide a simple solution to the $\\mu$-$B_\\mu$ problem in the\n\"$R$-invariant direct gauge mediation model\". With the solution, the Higgsino\nand gluino are predicted to be light as $\\mathcal{O}(100)$GeV and\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$TeV, respectively. Those gluino and Higgsino can be accessible\nat the LHC and future collider experiments. Moreover, dangerous dimension five\noperators inducing rapid proton decays are naturally suppressed by the\n$R$-symmetry.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize the storage and retrieval of light pulses in a\nfast-light medium via a mechanism of active Raman gain (ARG). The system under\nconsideration is a four-level atomic gas interacting with three (pump, signal\nand control) laser fields. We show that a stable propagation of signal light\npulses with superluminal velocity (i.e. fast-light pulses) is possible in such\nsystem through the ARG contributed by the pump field and the quantum\ninterference effect induced by the control field. We further show that a robust\nstorage and retrieval of light pulses in such fast-light medium can be\nimplemented by switching on and off the pump and the control fields\nsimultaneously. The results reported here may have potential applications for\nlight information processing and transmission using fast-light media.\n", "  This is the second paper in a series where we build a self-consistent model\nto simulate the mass-loss process of a close-orbit magnetized giant exoplanet,\nso-called hot Jupiter (HJ). In this paper we generalize the hydrodynamic (HD)\nmodel of an HJ expanding hydrogen atmosphere, proposed in the first paper, to\ninclude the effects of intrinsic planetary magnetic field. The proposed\nself-consistent axisymmetric 2D magnetohydrodynamics model incorporates\nradiative heating and ionization of the atmospheric gas, basic hydrogen\nchemistry for the appropriate account of major species composing HJ's upper\natmosphere and related radiative energy deposition, and H3+ and Ly{\\alpha}\ncooling processes. The model also takes into account a realistic solar-type\nX-ray/EUV spectrum for calculation of intensity and column density distribution\nof the radiative energy input, as well as gravitational and rotational forces\nacting in a tidally locked planet-star system. An interaction between the\nexpanding atmospheric plasma and an intrinsic planetary magnetic dipole field\nleads to the formation of a current-carrying magnetodisk that plays an\nimportant role for topology and scaling of the planetary magnetosphere. A\ncyclic character of the magnetodisk behavior, composed of consequent phases of\nthe disk formation followed by the magnetic reconnection with the ejection of a\nring-type plasmoid, has been discovered and investigated. We found that the\nmass-loss rate of an HD 209458b analog planet is weakly affected by the\nequatorial surface field <0.3 G, but is suppressed by an order of magnitude at\nthe field of 1 G.\n", "  A magnetosphere comparable in size to ion inertial length, known as a\nmini-magnetosphere, possesses unusual features which have been predicted by\nnumerical simulations and shown in recent experiments. In the present paper we\nstudy a pronounced difference between the west and east flanks of a\nmini-magnetosphere observed for the first time in pioneering terrella\nexperiments of 60 s duration. It manifests itself in plasma penetration deep\ninside the west flank and the formation of a return current that effects the\nmagnetic structure, in contrast to the east flank which has a well-defined\nboundary layer and plasma cavity. We propose that the plasma penetration and\nthe return current can be understood in the framework of a test-particle model.\nThis model serves to illustrate in simple terms the Hall physics which was\nfound to be behind similar features at the frontal part and the tail of the\nmini-magnetosphere observed in our previous experiments. Because of the large\ngyroradius, ions tend to be deflected by the dipole field at the east flank and\ndrawn into the west flank. To verify that the return electric current in the\nmagnetospheric plasma is carried by ions, we measured it directly using a\nRogovski coil and compared it with the ion flux measured by Langmuir probe.\n", "  Nanowires are perfect transducers for ultra-sensitive detections of force and\nmass. For small mass sensing, recent advances in detecting more properties than\ntheir masses with high sensitivity for absorbed particles onto a nanowire rely\non identifications of two orthogonal flexural vibration modes of the nanowire.\nThe directions of these orthogonal flexural vibrations with respect to\nmeasurement direction are crucial parameters of vibration modes. However,\nprevious method, which determines a nanowire's vibration direction using\nthermal vibrations, requires simultaneously detecting of two orthogonal\nflexural vibrations of the nanowire with sufficient sensitivity. In this work,\nwe propose and realize a method for the determination of directions of a\nnanowire's flexural vibrations by micro-lens optical fiber interferometer. Our\nmethod combines the light interference and light scattering of the nanowire. It\ndoes not require detecting a pair of degenerated orthogonal flexural vibration\nmodes. Therefore, our method is expected to have wide usages in characterizing\nnanowire's vibrations and their applications.\n", "  We investigate the impact of an external pressure on the structure of\nself-gravitating polytropes for axially symmetric ellipsoids and rings. The\nconfinement of the fluid by photons is accounted for through a boundary\ncondition on the enthalpy $H$. Equilibrium configurations are determined\nnumerically from a generalised \"Self-Consistent-Field\"-method. The new\nalgorithm incorporates an intra-loop re-scaling operator ${\\cal R}(H)$, which\nis essential for both convergence and getting self-normalised solutions. The\nmain control parameter is the external-to-core enthalpy ratio. In the case of\nuniform rotation rate and uniform surrounding pressure, we compute the mass,\nthe volume, the rotation rate and the maximum enthalpy. This is repeated for a\nfew polytropic indices $n$. For a given axis ratio, over-pressurization\nglobally increases all output quantities, and this is more pronounced for large\n$n$. Density profiles are flatter than in the absence of an external pressure.\nWhen the control parameter asymptotically tends to unity, the fluid converges\ntoward the incompressible solution, whatever the index, but becomes\ngeometrically singular. Equilibrium sequences, obtained by varying the axis\nratio, are built. States of critical rotation are greatly exceeded or even\ndisappear. The same trends are observed with differential rotation. Finally,\nthe typical response to a photon point source is presented. Strong irradiation\nfavours sharp edges. Applications concern star forming regions and matter\norbiting young stars and black holes.\n", "  Over the last decade, single-molecule optical microscopy has become the\ngold-standard approach to decipher complex molecular processes in cellular\nenvironments. [1-3] Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy has several\nadvantages such as ease of application, high sensitivity, low invasiveness and\nversatility due the large number of available fluorescent probes. It bears\nhowever some drawbacks related to the poor photostability of organic dye\nmolecules [4] and auto-fluorescent proteins [5-7] and and to the relatively\nlarge size of semiconductor nanoparticles in the context of live cell\napplications. [4,8,9] The overall size of the functional biomarkers is a\ngeneral issue for any imaging approach because of steric hindrance effects in\nconfined cell regions. Small red-shifted nano-emitters that are highly\nphotostable are not currently available, while they would combine the best\nphysical and optical penetration properties in biological tissues. Although\nsingle-molecule absorption microscopy was early used to detect single-molecules\n[10] at cryogenic temperatures, it is only with the advent of photothermal\nmicroscopy [11,12] that practical applications of absorption microscopy were\ndeveloped in single-molecule research. Photothermal imaging (PhI)\n", "  Cascading failure models are typically used to capture the phenomenon where\nfailures possibly trigger further failures in succession, causing knock-on\neffects. In many networks this ultimately leads to a disintegrated network\nwhere the failure propagation continues independently across the various\ncomponents. In order to gain insight in the impact of network splitting on\ncascading failure processes, we extend a well-established cascading failure\nmodel for which the number of failures obeys a power-law distribution. We\nassume that a single line failure immediately splits the network in two\ncomponents, and examine its effect on the power-law exponent. The results\nprovide valuable qualitative insights that are crucial first steps towards\nunderstanding more complex network splitting scenarios.\n", "  The interaction of water with $\\alpha$-alumina (i.e. $\\alpha$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$\nsurfaces is important in a variety of applications and a useful model for the\ninteraction of water with environmentally abundant aluminosilicate phases.\nDespite its significance, studies of water interaction with\n$\\alpha$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ surfaces other than the $(0001)$ are extremely\nlimited. Here we characterize the interaction of water (D$_{2}$O) with a well\ndefined $\\alpha$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$$(1\\bar{1}02)$ surface in UHV both\nexperimentally, using temperature programmed desorption and surface-specific\nvibrational spectroscopy, and theoretically, using periodic-slab density\nfunctional theory calculations. This combined approach makes it possible to\ndemonstrate that water adsorption occurs only at a single well defined surface\nsite (the so-called 1-4 configuration) and that at this site the barrier\nbetween the molecularly and dissociatively adsorbed forms is very low: 0.06 eV.\nA subset of OD stretch vibrations are parallel to this dissociation coordinate,\nand thus would be expected to be shifted to low frequencies relative to an\nuncoupled harmonic oscillator. To quantify this effect we solve the vibrational\nSchr\\\"odinger equation along the dissociation coordinate and find fundamental\nfrequencies red-shifted by more than 1,500 cm$^{\\text{-1}}$. Within the context\nof this model, at moderate temperatures, we further find that some fraction of\nsurface deuterons are likely delocalized: dissociatively and molecularly\nabsorbed states are no longer distinguishable.\n", "  The objective of this work is to numerically integrate in space and time the\neffective-mass Schrodinger equation for an excitonic wave packet in a coupled\nquantum-well system under a time-dependent electric field. Taking as a starting\npoint a time-dependent Hartree potential, we derive the nonlinear dynamical\nevolution of the excitonic wave function. We found that the system resonant\ncondition can be modified owing to the reaction field generated by a charge\ndynamically trapped in the quantum-well pair. As a result, this study raises a\nbroader question: is it possible to create an electrostatic trap for indirect\nexcitons at high ac frequencies? We conclude there is a possibility of having\nanother kind of terahertz electromagnetic radiation emerging from an excitonic\ntrap.\n", "  Samples of uterine leiomyomatis and normal tissues taken from patients after\nsurgery were investigated using the Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy\n(PALS). Significant differences in all PALS parameters between normal and\ndiseased tissues were observed. For all studied patients, it was found that the\nvalues of the free annihilation and ortho-positronium lifetime are larger for\nthe tumorous tissues than for the healthy ones. For most of the patients, the\nintensity of the free annihilation and ortho-positronium annihilation was\nsmaller for the tumorous than for the healthy tissues. For the first time, in\nthis kind of studies, the $3\\gamma$ fraction of positron annihilation was\ndetermined to describe changes in the tissue porosity during morphologic\nalteration.\n", "  We explore the leading effective interactions between the Standard Model and\na generic singlet CP-odd (pseudo)Goldstone boson in two frameworks for\nelectroweak symmetry breaking: linear and non-linear realizations, determining\nthe basis of leading effective operators for the latter. New bounds are\nobtained and prospects of signals at colliders are explored. Mono-Z, mono-W,\nand aW{\\gamma} are signals expected in both frameworks while non-standard Higgs\ndecays and mono-h signals may point to non-linear EWSB realizations.\n", "  Two-particle correlations as a function of $\\Delta\\eta$ and $\\Delta\\varphi$\nare used in all collision systems to study a wide range of physical phenomena.\nExamples include the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma medium,\njets, quantum statistics or Coulomb effects, conservation laws, and resonance\ndecays. In this work, measurements of the correlations of identified particles\nand their antiparticles (for $\\pi$, K, p, $\\Lambda$) are reported in pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV at low transverse momenta. The analysis reveals\ndifferences in particle production between baryons and mesons. The correlation\nfunctions for mesons exhibit the expected peak dominated by effects of mini-jet\nfragmentation and are reproduced well by general purpose Monte Carlo\ngenerators. For baryon pairs where both particles have the same baryon number,\na near-side anti-correlation structure is observed instead of a peak; our\nexperimental observation present a challenge to the contemporary models\n(PYTHIA, PHOJET). This effect is further interpreted in the context of baryon\nproduction mechanisms in the fragmentation processes.\n", "  In this paper, we study $P-V$ criticality for the charged accelerating AdS\nblack hole and determine some critical quantities. Here, we consider two\ndifferent approaches as heat capacity and thermodynamic geometry and\ninvestigate phase transition of corresponding black hole in nonextended and\nextended phase space. We show that in canonical ensemble (fixed electric\ncharge), the heat capacity approach give us two types of phase transition as\ntype one and two. Then we study thermodynamic geometry of the black hole by two\nseparate methods as thermodynamic metric and metric independent way. By\ncomparing the obtained results, we notice that the thermodynamic metric\napproach can not describe both phase transition simultaneously and also\ndivergent point of Ricci scalar do'nt coincide with phase transition point for\nsome cases. By investigation of metric independent way we find that curvature\nscalar (of equilibrium state space geometry) is singular at the point where\nspecific heat diverges and this method is suitable approach to describe\nthermodynamic geometry of accelerating charged black hole.\n", "  We report on the investigation of modifications of basic properties of K$^+$\nand K$^-$ mesons emitted from collisions of Ni+Ni at beam energy of 1.91A GeV.\nExperimental K$^-$/K$^+$ ratio are presented in a wide range of phase space\nparameterized by kinetic energy and emission angle in the nucleon-nucleon\ncentre of mass. The $v_1$ component of the azimuthal distribution was extracted\nas a function of rapidity and transverse momentum for central, and\nsemi-peripheral collisions. A comparison of these patterns with the HSD\ntransport model favours the existence of the kaon-nucleon in-medium potential.\nFor the IQMD model, this interaction scenario is confirmed in case of K$^-$,\nwhereas for K$^+$ the picture is less clear.\n", "  Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) hosted in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can\nbe characterized by multi-accreting periods as the attractors interact with the\nenvironment during their life-time. These multi-accretion episodes should leave\ntraces in the matter orbiting the attractor. Counterrotating and even\nmisaligned structures orbiting around the SMBHs would be consequences of these\nepisodes. Our task in this work is to consider situations where such accretions\noccur and to trace their remnants represented by several toroidal accreting\nfluids, corotating or counterrotating relative to the central Kerr attractor,\nand created in various regimes during the evolution of matter configurations\naround SMBHs. We focus particularly on the emergence of matter instabilities,\ni.e., tori collisions, accretion onto the central Kerr black hole, or creation\nof jet-like structures (proto-jets). Each orbiting configuration is governed by\nthe general relativistic hydrodynamic Boyer condition of equilibrium\nconfigurations of rotating perfect fluid. We prove that sequences of\nconfigurations and hot points, where an instability occurs, characterize the\nKerr SMBHs, depending mainly on their spin-mass ratios. The occurrence of tori\naccretion or collision are strongly constrained by the fluid rotation with\nrespect to the central black hole and the relative rotation with respect to\neach other. Our investigation provides characteristic of attractors where\ntraces of multi-accreting episodes can be found and observed.\n", "  We report on the development of an ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscope\nbased on a cold field emission source which can operate in either DC or\nultrafast mode. Electron emission from a tungsten nanotip is triggered by\nfemtosecond laser pulses which are tightly focused by optical components\nintegrated inside a cold field emission source close to the cathode. The\nproperties of the electron probe (brightness, angular current density,\nstability) are quantitatively determined. The measured brightness is the\nlargest reported so far for UTEMs. Examples of imaging, diffraction and\nspectroscopy using ultrashort electron pulses are given. Finally, the potential\nof this instrument is illustrated by performing electron holography in the\noff-axis configuration using ultrashort electron pulses.\n", "  The response of fermionic system to external gauge fields in presence of\nnon-quantized magnetic field is determined by current-current correlation\nfunction $\\Pi_{\\mu\\nu}({\\bf B})$. We study $2D$ dimensional Dirac electron\nsystem and calculate current-current correlation function in a presence of\nmagnetic field $B$, chemical potential $\\eta$ and gap $m$.\n", "  A classical problem in fluid mechanics is the motion of an axisymmetric\nvortex sheet evolving under the action of surface tension, surrounded by an\ninviscid fluid. Lagrangian descriptions of these dynamics are well-known,\ninvolving complex nonlocal expressions for the radial and longitudinal\nvelocities in terms of elliptic integrals. Here we use these prior results to\narrive at a remarkably compact and exact Eulerian evolution equation for the\nsheet radius $r(z,t)$ in an explicit flux form associated with the conservation\nof enclosed volume. The flux appears as an integral involving the pairwise\nmutual induction formula for vortex loop pairs first derived by Helmholtz and\nMaxwell. We show how the well-known linear stability results for cylindrical\nvortex sheets in the presence of surface tension and streaming flows [A.M.\nSterling and C.A. Sleicher, $J.~Fluid~Mech.$ ${\\bf 68}$, 477 (1975)] can be\nobtained directly from this formulation. Furthermore, the inviscid limit of the\nempirical model of Eggers and Dupont [$J.~Fluid~Mech.$ $\\textbf{262}$ 205\n(1994); $SIAM~J.~Appl.~Math.$ ${\\bf 60}$, 1997 (2000)], which has served as the\nbasis for understanding singularity formation in droplet pinchoff, is derived\nwithin the present formalism as the leading order term in an asymptotic\nanalysis for long slender axisymmetric vortex sheets, and should provide the\nstarting point for a rigorous analysis of singularity formation.\n", "  Active interferometers use amplifying elements for beam splitting and\nrecombination. We experimentally implement such a device by using spin exchange\nin a Bose-Einstein condensate. The two interferometry modes are initially empty\nspin states that get spontaneously populated in the process of parametric\namplification. This nonlinear mechanism scatters atoms into both modes in a\npairwise fashion and generates a nonclassical state. Finally, a matched second\nperiod of spin exchange is performed that nonlinearly amplifies the output\nsignal and maps the phase onto readily detectable first moments. Depending on\nthe accumulated phase this nonlinear readout can reverse the initial dynamics\nand deamplify the entangled state back to empty spin states. This sequence is\ndescribed in the framework of SU(1,1) mode transformations and compared to the\nSU(2) angular momentum description of passive interferometers.\n", "  A convenient framework for dealing with hadron structure and hadronic physics\nin the few-GeV energy range is relativistic quantum mechanics. Unlike\nrelativistic quantum field theory, one deals with a fixed, or at least\nrestricted number of degrees of freedom while maintaining relativistic\ninvariance. For systems of interacting particles this is achieved by means of\nthe, so called, \"Bakamjian-Thomas construction\", which is a systematic\nprocedure for implementing interaction terms in the generators of the Poincare\ngroup such that their algebra is preserved. Doing relativistic quantum\nmechanics in this way one, however, faces a problem connected with the physical\nrequirement of cluster separability as soon as one has more than two\ninteracting particles. Cluster separability, or sometimes also termed\n\"macroscopic causality\", is the property that if a system is subdivided into\nsubsystems which are then separated by a sufficiently large spacelike distance,\nthese subsystems should behave independently. In the present contribution we\ndiscuss the problem of cluster separability and sketch the procedure to resolve\nit.\n", "  Under shock loading, metals have been found to melt and with reflection of\nthe shock wave from the material free surface, cavities nucleate and grow. This\nprocess is referred to as micro spall and has been studied experimentally with\nanalytical models describing debris sizes. Measurements during the cavity\ngrowth phase are not possible at present and we present here the Direct\nNumerical Simulation of an idealized problem where we assume an inviscid,\nincompressible liquid subject to a constant expansion rate with cavities at a\nvanishing vapour pressure.\n  In order to allow for a time-varying gas volume a free-surface interface\ncondition has been implemented in an existing incompressible multiphase\nNavier-Stokes solver, PARIS Simulator, using a volume-of-fluid method. The gas\nflow remains unsolved and is instead assumed to have a fixed pressure which is\napplied to the liquid through a Dirichlet boundary condition on the arbitrary\nliquid-gas interface. Gas bubbles are tracked individually, allowing the gas\npressure to be prescribed using a suitable equation of state.\n  Simulations with hundreds of bubbles have been performed in a fixed domain\nunder a constant rate of expansion. A bubble competition is observed: larger\nbubbles tend to expand more rapidly at the demise of smaller ones. The time\nscale of competition is shown to depend on a modified Weber number.\n", "  Recent all-sky surveys have led to the discovery of new types of transients.\nThese include stars disrupted by the central supermassive black hole, and\nsupernovae that are 10-100 times more energetic than typical ones. However, the\nnature of even more energetic transients that apparently occur in the innermost\nregions of their host galaxies is hotly debated. Here we report the discovery\nof the most energetic of these to date: PS1-10adi, with a total radiated energy\nof ~ 2.3 x 10^52 erg. The slow evolution of its light curve and persistently\nnarrow spectral lines over ~3 yr are inconsistent with known types of recurring\nblack hole variability. The observed properties imply powering by shock\ninteraction between expanding material and large quantities of surrounding\ndense matter. Plausible sources of this expanding material are a star that has\nbeen tidally disrupted by the central black hole, or a supernova. Both could\nsatisfy the energy budget. For the former, we would be forced to invoke a new\nand hitherto unseen variant of a tidally disrupted star, while a supernova\norigin relies principally on environmental effects resulting from its nuclear\nlocation. Remarkably, we also discovered that PS1-10adi is not an isolated\ncase. We therefore surmise that this new population of transients has\npreviously been overlooked due to incorrect association with underlying central\nblack hole activity.\n", "  The ability to reliably predict critical transitions in dynamical systems is\na long-standing goal of diverse scientific communities. Previous work focused\non early warning signals related to local bifurcations (critical slowing down)\nand non-bifurcation type transitions. We extend this toolbox and report on a\ncharacteristic scaling behavior (critical attractor growth) which is indicative\nof an impending global bifurcation, an interior crisis in excitable systems. We\ndemonstrate our early warning signal in a conceptual climate model as well as\nin a model of coupled neurons known to exhibit extreme events. We observed\ncritical attractor growth prior to interior crises of chaotic as well as\nstrange-nonchaotic attractors. These observations promise to extend the classes\nof transitions that can be predicted via early warning signals.\n", "  We report on some recent advances in calculating the Wigner distributions for\nquarks and gluons, using overlaps of light-front wave functions.\n", "  Cutting off the tail of the Woods-Saxon and generalized Woods-Saxon\npotentials changes the distribution of the poles of the $S$-matrix\nconsiderably. Here we modify the tail of the cut-off Woods-Saxon (CWS) and\ncut-off generalized Woods-Saxon (CGWS) potentials by attaching Hermite\npolynomial tails to them beyond the cut. The tails reach the zero value more or\nless smoothly at the finite ranges of the potential. Reflections of the\nresonant wave functions can take place at different distances. The starting\npoints of the pole trajectories have been reproduced not only for the real\nvalues and the moduli of the starting points but also for the imaginary parts.\n", "  We report the $a~posteriori$ confirmation of two large-scale filaments along\nthe sight-line of the blazar 1ES~1553+113, which correspond to Warm-Hot\nIntergalactic Medium (WHIM) absorption features in the X-ray and far\nultraviolet. We use the WISE-SuperCOSMOS photometric catalog to map the\ncosmic-web in the direction of the blazar, and find significant filaments at\nredshifts of $z=0.23\\pm0.02$ and $z=0.31\\pm0.02$, which roughly align with the\nabsorption redshifts. A third X-ray absorption feature at $z_X=0.133$ did not\nhave any corresponding structures in the photometric catalog.\n", "  Quantum mechanical tunneling of electrons across ultrathin insulating oxide\nbarriers has been studied extensively for decades due to its great potential in\nelectronic device applications. In the few-nanometer-thick epitaxial oxide\nfilms, atomic-scale structural imperfections, such as the ubiquitously existed\none-unit-cell-high terrace edges, can dramatically affect the tunneling\nprobability and device performance. However, the underlying physics has not\nbeen investigated adequately. Here, taking ultrathin BaTiO3 films as a model\nsystem, we report an intrinsic tunneling conductance enhancement near the\nterrace edges. Scanning probe microscopy results demonstrate the existence of\nhighly-conductive regions (tens of nanometers-wide) near the terrace edges.\nFirst-principles calculations suggest that the terrace edge geometry can\ntrigger an electronic reconstruction, which reduces the effective tunneling\nbarrier width locally. Furthermore, such tunneling conductance enhancement can\nbe discovered in other transition-metal-oxides and controlled by surface\ntermination engineering. The controllable electronic reconstruction could\nfacilitate the implementation of oxide electronic devices and discovery of\nexotic low-dimensional quantum phases.\n", "  In this paper, we formulate a velocity operator approach to a\nthree-dimensional (3D) Fermion system. Following Sunakawa, introducing density\nand velocity operators, we treat 3D quantum fluid dynamics in the system. We\nget a collective Hamiltonian in terms of collective variables. The lowest order\ncollective Hamiltonian is diagonalized. This diagonalization leads us to a\nBogoliubov transformation for Boson-like operators.\n", "  We define the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) weak interpretation as the dBB\ninterpretation restricted to particles in unbound states whose wave function is\ndefined in the three-dimensional physical space, and the dBB strong\ninterpretation as the usual dBB interpretation applied to all wave functions,\nin particular to particles in bound states whose wave function is defined in a\n3N-dimensional configuration space in which N is the number of particules. We\nshow that the current criticisms of the dBB interpretation do not apply to this\nweak interpretation and that, furthermore, there are theoritical and\nexperimental reasons to justify the weak dBB interpretation. Theoretically, the\nmain reason concern the continuity existing for such particles between quantum\nmechanics and classical mechanics: we demonstrate in fact that the density and\nthe phase of the wave function of a single-particle (or a set of identical\nparticles without interaction), when the Planck constant tends to 0, converges\nto the density and the action of a set of unrecognizable prepared classical\nparticles that satisfy the statistical Hamilton-Jacobi equations. As the\nHamilton-Jacobi action pilots the particle in classical mechanics, this\ncontinuity naturally concurs with the weak dBB interpretation. Experimentally,\nwe show that the measurement results of the main quantum experiments (Young's\nslits experiment, Stern and Gerlach, EPR-B) are compatible with the de\nBroglie-Bohm weak interpretation and everything takes place as if these\nunbounded particles had trajectories. In addition, we propose two potential\nsolutions to complete the dBB weak interpretation.\n", "  Classifying states which exhibiting different statistical correlations is\namong the most important problems in quantum information science and quantum\nmany-body physics. In bipartite case, there is a clear hierarchy of states with\ndifferent correlations: total correlation (T) $\\supsetneq$ discord (D)\n$\\supsetneq$ entanglement (E) $\\supsetneq$ steering (S) $\\supsetneq$\nBell~nonlocality (NL). However, very little is known about genuine multipartite\ncorrelations (GM$\\mathcal{C}$) for both conceptual and technical difficulties.\nIn this work, we show that, for any $N$-partite qudit states, there also exist\nsuch a hierarchy: genuine multipartite total correlations (GMT) $\\supseteq$\ngenuine multipartite discord (GMD) $\\supseteq$ genuine multipartite\nentanglement (GME) $\\supseteq$ genuine multipartite steering (GMS) $\\supseteq$\ngenuine multipartite nonlocality (GMNL). Furthermore, by constructing precise\nstates, we show that GMT, GME and GMS are inequivalent with each other, thus\nGMT $\\supsetneq$ GME $\\supsetneq$ GMS.\n", "  Recent work has provided ample evidence that global climate dynamics at\ntime-scales between multiple weeks and several years can be severely affected\nby the episodic occurrence of both, internal (climatic) and external\n(non-climatic) perturbations. Here, we aim to improve our understanding on how\nregional to local disruptions of the \"normal\" state of the global surface air\ntemperature field affect the corresponding global teleconnectivity structure.\nSpecifically, we present an approach to quantify teleconnectivity based on\ndifferent characteristics of functional climate network analysis. Subsequently,\nwe apply this framework to study the impacts of different phases of the El\nNi\\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as well as the three largest volcanic\neruptions since the mid 20th century on the dominating spatiotemporal\nco-variability patterns of daily surface air temperatures. Our results confirm\nthe existence of global effects of ENSO which result in episodic breakdowns of\nthe hierarchical organization of the global temperature field. This is\nassociated with the emergence of strong teleconnections. At more regional\nscales, similar effects are found after major volcanic eruptions. Taken\ntogether, the resulting time-dependent patterns of network connectivity allow a\ntracing of the spatial extents of the dominating effects of both types of\nclimate disruptions. We discuss possible links between these observations and\ngeneral aspects of atmospheric circulation.\n", "  Notwithstanding the usefulness of system dynamics in analyzing complex policy\nproblems, policy design is far from straightforward and in many instances\ntrial-and-error driven. To address this challenge, we propose to combine system\ndynamics with network controllability, an emerging field in network science, to\nfacilitate the detection of effective leverage points in system dynamics models\nand thus to support the design of influential policies. We illustrate our\napproach by analyzing a classic system dynamics model: the World Dynamics\nmodel. We show that it is enough to control only 53% of the variables to steer\nthe entire system to an arbitrary final state. We further rank all variables\naccording to their importance in controlling the system and we validate our\napproach by showing that high ranked variables have a significantly larger\nimpact on the system behavior compared to low ranked variables.\n", "  We present the Fr\\\"ohlich-Spencer proof of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our treatment includes the proof of\ndelocalization for the integer-valued discrete Gaussian free field at high\ntemperature and the proof of existence of a phase with power-law decay of\ncorrelations in the plane rotator model with Villain interaction, both in two\ndimensions. The treatment differs from the original in various technical points\nand we hope it will be of benefit to the community.\n", "  We develop a technique for counting the number of stress tensor multiplets in\na 4D $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT. This provides a simple diagnostic for when an\nisolated (non-Lagrangian) SCFT is a product of two (or more) such theories. In\nclass-S, the basic building blocks are the isolated SCFTs arising from the\ncompactification of a 6D (2,0) theory on a 3-punctured sphere (\"fixture\"). We\napply our technique to determine when a fixture is a product SCFT. The answer\nis that this phenomenon is surprisingly rare. In the low-rank $A_{N-1}$, $D_N$\ntheories and the $E_6$ theory studied by the first author and his\ncollaborators, it occurs less than $1\\%$ of the time. Of the 2979 fixtures in\nthe (untwisted and twisted) $E_6$ theory, only 23 are product SCFTs. Of these,\n22 were known to the original authors. The new one is a product of the\n${(E_7)}_8$ Minahan-Nemeschansky theory and a new rank-2 SCFT.\n", "  As far as we know, a useful quantum computer will require fault-tolerant\ngates, and existing schemes demand a prohibitively large space and time\noverhead. We argue that a first generation quantum computer will be very\nvaluable to design, test, and optimize fault-tolerant protocols tailored to the\nnoise processes of the hardware. Our argument is essentially a critical\nanalysis of the current methods envisioned to optimize fault-tolerant schemes,\nwhich rely on hardware characterization, noise modelling, and numerical\nsimulations. We show that, even within a very restricted set of noise models,\nerror correction protocols depend strongly on the details of the noise model.\nCombined to the intrinsic difficulty of hardware characterization and of\nnumerical simulations of fault-tolerant protocols, we arrive at the conclusion\nthat the currently envisioned optimization cycle is of very limited scope. On\nthe other hand, the direct characterization of a fault-tolerant scheme on a\nsmall quantum computer bypasses these difficulties, and could provide a\nbootstrapping path to full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.\n", "  The otherwise exponential high-energy proton-proton diffraction cone has two\nprominent structures, which are namely the \"break\" staying fixed around $t\n\\approx -0.1$ GeV$^2$ and the \"dip\" moving with increasing energy\nlogarithmically towards smaller $|t|$ values. While at the ISR the two\nstructures are separated by a distance of about $1$ GeV$^2$, at the LHC the dip\ncomes close to the periphery of the \"break\", thus affecting its\nparametrization. The Regge theory gives some opportunity to describe these\nphenomena which have still disputable and quite different physics.\n", "  We combined deep U-band imaging from the KPNO-4m/MOSAIC camera with very deep\nmulti-waveband data from the optical to infrared, to select Lyman Break\nGalaxies (LBGs) at z~3 using U-V and V-R colors in the Subaru Deep Field. With\nthe resulting sample of 5161 LBGs, we construct the UV luminosity function down\nto $M_{UV} = -18$ and find a steep faint-end slope of $\\alpha=-1.78 \\pm 0.05$.\nWe analyze rest-frame UV-to-IR spectral energy distributions generated from the\nmedian optical photometry and photometry on median-stacked IR images. In the\nstacks of faint LBGs, we find a background depression centered on the galaxy.\nThis deficit results from the systematic difficulty of SExtractor in finding\nfaint galaxies in regions with higher-than-average surface densities of\nforeground galaxies. We corrected our stacked magnitudes for this. Best-fit\nstellar population templates for the stacked LBG SEDs indicate stellar masses\nand star-formation rates of log M*/Msun = 10 and 50 M$_\\odot$/yr at i' = 24,\ndown to log M*/Msun = 8 and = 3 M$_\\odot$/yr at i' = 27. For the faint stacked\nLBGs there is a 1-mag excess over the expected stellar continuum in the K-band,\nwhich we attribute to redshifted [OIII]4959+5007 and H$\\beta$ lines. Their\nimplied equivalent widths increase with decreasing mass, reaching $\\rm{EW_0([O\nIII]4959,5007+H\\beta)}$ =1500A in the faintest bin. Such strong [OIII] emission\nis seen only in a miniscule fraction of the most extreme local emission-line\ngalaxies, but it probably universal in the faint galaxies that reionized the\nuniverse. Finally, we analyze clustering by computing the angular correlation\nfunction and performing halo occupation distribution (HOD) analysis. We find a\nmean dark halo mass of log(Mhalo/h) Msun = 11.29$\\pm 0.12$ for the full sample\nof LBGs, and log(Mhalo/h) Msun = 11.49$\\pm 0.1$ for the brightest half.\n", "  NGC 7582 is an SB(s)ab galaxy which displays evidences of simultaneous\nnuclear activity and star formation in its centre. Previous optical\nobservations revealed, besides the H II regions, an ionization cone and a gas\ndisc in its central part. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in both optical\nand infrared bands show the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and a few compact\nstructures that are possibly associated with young stellar clusters. In order\nto study in detail both the AGN and evidence for star formation, we analyse\noptical (Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph) and near-infrared (Spectrograph for\nIntegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared) archival data cubes. We\ndetected five nebulae with strong He II$\\lambda$4686 emission in the same\nregion where an outflow is detected in the [O III]$\\lambda$5007 kinematic map.\nWe interpreted this result as clouds that are exposed to high-energy photons\nemerging from the AGN throughout the ionization cone. We also detected\nWolf$-$Rayet features which are related to emission of one of the compact\nclusters seen in the \\textit{HST} image. Broad H$\\alpha$ and Br$\\gamma$\ncomponents are detected at the position of the nucleus. [Fe II]$\\lambda$1.644\n$\\mu$m, H$_2\\lambda$2.122 $\\mu$m and Br$\\gamma$ flux maps show two blobs, one\nnorth and the other south from the nucleus, that seem to be associated with\nfive previously detected mid-infrared sources. Two of the five He II nebulae\nare partially ionized by photons from starbursts. However, we conclude that the\nmain source of excitation of these blobs is the AGN jet/disc. The jet\norientation indicates that the accretion disc is nearly orthogonal to the dusty\ntorus.\n", "  Phoresis, the drift of particles induced by scalar gradients in a flow, can\nresult in an effective compressibility, bringing together or repelling\nparticles from each other. Here, we ask whether this effect can affect the\ntransport of particles in a turbulent flow. To this end, we study how the\ndispersion of a cloud of phoretic particles is modified when injected in the\nflow, together with a blob of scalar, whose effect is to transiently bring\nparticles together, or push them away from the center of the blob. The\nresulting phoretic effect can be quantified by a single dimensionless number.\nPhenomenological considerations lead to simple predictions for the mean\nseparation between particles, which are consistent with results of direct\nnumerical simulations. Using the numerical results presented here, as well as\nthose from previous studies, we discuss quantitatively the experimental\nconsequences of this work and the possible impact of such phoretic mechanisms\nin natural systems.\n", "  The RoboPol instrument and the relevant program was developed in order to\nconduct a systematic study of the optical polarisation variability of blazars.\nDriven by the discovery that long smooth rotations of the optical polarisation\nplane can be associated with the activity in other bands and especially in\ngamma rays, the program was meant to investigate the physical mechanisms\ncausing them and quantify the optical polarisation behaviour in blazars. Over\nthe first three nominal observing seasons (2013, 2014 and 2015) RoboPol\ndetected 40 rotations in 24 blazars by observing a gamma-ray-loud and\ngamma-ray-quite unbiassed sample of blazars, providing a reliable set of events\nfor exploring the phenomenon. The obtain datasets provided the ground for a\nsystematic quantification of the variability of the optical polarisation in\nsuch systems. In the following after a brief review of the discoveries that\nrelate to the gamma-ray loudness of the sources we move on to discuss a simple\njet model that explains the observed dichotomy in terms of polarisation between\ngamma-ray-loud and quite sources and the dependence of polarisation and the\nstability of the polarisation angle on the synchrotron peak frequency.\n", "  Active swimmers are ubiquitous in nature, found in many diverse biological\nsystems ranging from bacteria to vertebrate fish. Of particular importance are\nsperm cells which are swimmers that are crucial for the survival of many\nspecies including humans. Despite decades of work, the fluid physics of sperm\nin complex micro-environments such as the cervical tract, or the microfluidic\ndevices used in assistive reproductive technologies remains illusive. Recently,\na novel microfluidic device featuring periodic post arrays has been developed,\nand shown to select sperm cells with better motility, morphology and DNA\nintegrity, more efficiently than existing approaches. Motivated by this, here\nwe present a multi-scale model that aims to provide insight physical insight\ninto the motility behavior of sperm in such periodic geometries. Our model\ncombines a fluctuating hydrodynamic model of sperm with a probabilistic\ndiscrete-time lattice approach, and we show how hydrodynamic and boundary\ninteractions facilitate both the enhancement of speed and persistence length of\nsperm cells in this post array. We then discuss how this enhancement of\nflagellar transport is related to its propensity, and develop a phase diagram.\nOur findings not only shed light into the fluid physics of flagellar swimmers\nin periodic arrays, but also have direct implications in a broad range of areas\nbeyond fertility, including bio-inspired robotics, disease detection and drug\ndelivery.\n", "  Halide perovskites are currently under intense investigation due to their\npotential applications in optoelectronics and solar cells. Among them several\ncrystallize in low symmetry lattice structures like trigonal, hexagonal,\northorhombic and monoclinic. Employing \\textit{ab-initio} electronic structure\ncalculations in conjunction with generalized gradient approximation and hybrid\nfunctionals we study a series of perovskites with the formula A$_3$B$_2$X$_9$\nwhich have been grown experimentally. A stands for a monovalent cation like Cs,\nRb, K or the organic methylammonium molecule (MA), B is Sb or Bi, and X is a\nhalogen. Moreover we include in our study both the effect of spin-orbit\ncoupling in the halide perovskites and the influence of the orientation\ndisorder of the MA cation on the energy band gaps of these compounds. Most\ncompounds under study exhibit absorption in or close to the optical regime and\nthus can find application in various optoelectronic devices. Our results pave\nthe way for further investigation on the use of these materials in technology\nrelevant applications.\n", "  Scattering amplitudes of partons in QCD contain infrared divergences which\ncan be resummed to all orders in terms of an anomalous dimension.\nIndependently, in the limit of high-energy forward scattering, large logarithms\nof the energy can be resummed using Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov theory. We\nuse the latter to analyze the infrared-singular part of amplitudes to all\norders in perturbation theory and to next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy in the\nhigh-energy limit, resumming the two-Reggeon contribution. Remarkably, we find\na closed form for the infrared-singular part, predicting the Regge limit of the\nsoft anomalous dimension to any loop order.\n", "  The evolution of Physics between the second half of the XIX century and the\nbeginning of the XX century is presented coupling art and science, in the\nframework of Ferrara. The main characters are Giuseppe Bongiovanni, Professor\nof Experimental Physics and Giorgio de Chirico, artist founder of the\nMetaphysical art movement.\n", "  In this paper, we have used the concepts of the fractional derivative of\nrough curves to characterize ECG of LVH patients and compared the results with\nnormal ECGs. In mathematical language, an ECG is a rough curve having Q, R, S\npoints as non-differentiable points where classical derivatives do not exist\nbut fractional derivatives exist. We have calculated both left and right\nmodified Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives and their differences termed\nas phase transition at those non-differentiable points of V1, V2, V5, and V6\nleads.Investigation shows that phase transition is higher for LVH patients than\nnormal ones. This may be a method of determination of risk factor of LVH\npatients before doing Echocardiogram.\n", "  The growing interest of people in science events, the projects supported by\nthe Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research to foster STEM\nteaching in different levels of the education system and the introduction of\nmodern physics in some Italian high schools, contributed to the strengthening\nof interaction between schools, universities and research centers. This\ninteraction realized in dedicated activities characterized by innovative\ncommunication and education strategies.This paper presents the events of\nscience dissemination organized in the last years by the University of Ferrara\nand the National Institute for Nuclear Physics taking into account some case\nstudy differentiated by contents, recipients and education strategies.\n", "  While the planet-metallicity correlation for FGK main-sequence stars hosting\ngiant planets is well established, the results are not so clear for M-dwarf\nstars, for which precise metallicity measurements are not straightforward.\nHowever, new techniques using near infrared spectra show promising results.\nUsing these, we determine stellar parameters and metallicities for a sample of\n16 M-dwarf stars, 11 of which host planets, with near-infrared spectra from the\nGemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS). We find that M-dwarfs with planets\nare preferentially metal-rich compared to those without planets. This result,\nbased on GNIRS spectra, is supported by the analysis of a relatively larger\nsample of M stars with planets (18 in total) and a control sample of 213 M\nstars without known planets, obtained from the catalogue of Terrien et al.\n(2015). This, on the one hand, coincides with the trend (not only for M- but\nalso for solar-type stars) reported in the literature and, on the other hand,\ndemonstrates the utility of GNIRS spectra to obtain reliable stellar parameters\nof M stars. We also find that M dwarfs that harbor giant planets are\npreferentially more metallic than those associated with low-mass planets\n(Neptune or super-Earth type). This trend also agrees with that previously\nreported for solar-type stars. These results would favor the core accretion\nmodel for planetary formation.\n", "  We discuss practical methods to ensure near wirespeed performance from\nclusters with either one or two Intel(R) Omni-Path host fabric interfaces (HFI)\nper node, and Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) 72xx (Knight's Landing) processors, and\nusing the Linux operating system.\n  The study evaluates the performance improvements achievable and the required\nprogramming approaches in two distinct example problems: firstly in Cartesian\ncommunicator halo exchange problems, appropriate for structured grid PDE\nsolvers that arise in quantum chromodynamics simulations of particle physics,\nand secondly in gradient reduction appropriate to synchronous stochastic\ngradient descent for machine learning. As an example, we accelerate a published\nBaidu Research reduction code and obtain a factor of ten speedup over the\noriginal code using the techniques discussed in this paper. This displays how a\nfactor of ten speedup in strongly scaled distributed machine learning could be\nachieved when synchronous stochastic gradient descent is massively parallelised\nwith a fixed mini-batch size.\n  We find a significant improvement in performance robustness when memory is\nobtained using carefully allocated 2MB \"huge\" virtual memory pages, implying\nthat either non-standard allocation routines should be used for communication\nbuffers. These can be accessed via a LD\\_PRELOAD override in the manner\nsuggested by libhugetlbfs. We make use of a the Intel(R) MPI 2019 library\n\"Technology Preview\" and underlying software to enable thread concurrency\nthroughout the communication software stake via multiple PSM2 endpoints per\nprocess and use of multiple independent MPI communicators. When using a single\nMPI process per node, we find that this greatly accelerates delivered bandwidth\nin many core Intel(R) Xeon Phi processors.\n", "  Gravitational lensing time-delays using standard candles can provide\ntremendous leverage to cosmology. A recently discovered gravitationally lensed\ntype Ia supernova, iPTF16geu, may yield a precise and accurate measurement of\nthe Hubble constant.\n", "  In this article we study the problem of localization of eigenvalues for the\nnon-homogeneous hierarchical Anderson model. More specifically, given the\nhierarchical Anderson model with spectral dimension $0<d<1$ with a random\npotential acting on the diagonal of non i.i.d. random variables, sufficient\nconditions on the disorder are provided in order to obtain the two main\nresults: the weak convergence of the counting measure for almost all\nrealization of the random potential and the weak convergence of the re-scaled\neigenvalue counting measure to a Poisson point process. The technical part\nimproves the already existing arguments of Kritchevski , who studied the\nhierarchical model with a disorder acting on the diagonal, with independent and\nidentically distributed random variables, by using the argument of Minami . At\nthe end of this article, we study an application example that allows us to\nunderstand some relations between the spectral dimension of the hierarchical\nLaplacian and the magnitude of the disorder.\n", "  Cosmic rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere to produce $^{14}$C, which\ncan be absorbed by trees. Therefore, rapid increases of $^{14}$C in tree rings\ncan be used to probe previous cosmic-ray events. By this method, three $^{14}$C\nrapidly increasing events have been found. Plausible causes of these events\ninclude large solar proton events, supernovae or short gamma-ray bursts.\nHowever, due to the lack of measurements of $^{14}$C by year, the occurrence\nfrequency of such $^{14}$C rapidly increasing events is poorly known. In\naddition, rapid increases may be hidden in the IntCal13 data with five-year\nresolution. Here we report the result of $^{14}$C measurements using an ancient\nburied tree during the period between BC 3388 and 3358. We find a rapid\nincrease of about 9\\textperthousand~ in the $^{14}$C content from BC 3372 to BC\n3371. We suggest that this event could originate from a large solar proton\nevent.\n", "  We have characterized the growth of ZnO using sequential infiltration\nsynthesis (SiS) on PS-b-PMMA block copolymers (BCP) of spherical and\ncylindrical sub-20nm morphologies and studied how the photoluminescence of\nthese nanostructures varies per its seed layer. Investigation of these\nstructures was done using atomic force microscopy (AFM), spectrofluorometry,\nRaman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We report\nblue-shifted photoemission at 335 nm (3.70 eV), suggesting quantum confinement\neffects. This UV-photoluminescence can be translated into emitter sizes of\nroughly 1.5nm in radius. Furthermore, samples of ZnO prepared with an alumina\nseed layer showed additional defect state photoemission at 470 nm and 520 nm\nfor spherical and cylindrical BCP morphologies, respectively. Defect\nphotoemission was not observed in samples prepared without a seed layer. Raman\nand EXAFS data suggest lack of long range order between the ZnO nanostructures\nduring early stages of infiltrated ZnO growth and therefore supports the blue\nshift emission is due to confinement. Our work demonstrates that ZnO\nnanostructures grown on PS-b-PMMA via infiltration are advantageous in\nuniformity and size, and exhibit unique fluorescence properties. These\nobservations suggest that infiltrated ZnO in PS-b-PMMA nanostructures lends\nitself to a new regime of applications in photonics and quantum materials.\n", "  We study spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a diamond-like-decorated\nsquare lattice perturbed by two kinds of further neighbor couplings. In our\nprevious study [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 85, 094002 (2016)], the second-order\neffective Hamiltonian for the Heisenberg model perturbed by a further neighbor\ncoupling was found to be a square-lattice quantum-dimer model with a finite\nhopping amplitude, t>0, and no dimer-dimer interaction, v=0. In this study, we\nintroduce another kind of further neighbor coupling and show that it leads to\nan attractive interaction between dimers, which suggests the stabilization of\nthe columnar phase of the square-lattice quantum-dimer model. The calculated\nv/t is presented as a function of the ratio of the two exchange parameters in\nthe Heisenberg model.\n", "  We present a closed-form expression for the time dynamics of a balanced Fermi\nsuperfluid with s-wave pairing and Rashba spin-orbit (SO) coupling. Solving the\nassociated self-consistency conditions for an initial number density given by a\nGaussian and an initial gap containing a vortex dipole, we show that Rashba SO\ncoupling results in precession of the vortex dipole. The integrated\nself-consistent gap decays as a function of time, characterising a \"transient\nFermi superfluid\". Our analytic solution forms a starting point for studies of\nvortex dynamics -- in particular braiding of Majorana fermions -- in Fermi\nsuperfluids in the presence of spin population imbalance and two-dimensional SO\ncoupling, which are both required to realize a topological atomic Fermi gas in\nexperiments.\n", "  The first Weyl semimetal was recently discovered in the NbP class of\ncompounds. Although the topology of these novel materials has been identified,\nthe surface properties are not yet fully understood. By means of scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy, we find that NbPs (001) surface hosts a pair of Dirac\ncones protected by mirror symmetry. Through our high resolution spectroscopic\nmeasurements, we resolve the quantum interference patterns arising from these\nnovel Dirac fermions, and reveal their electronic structure, including the\nlinear dispersions. Our data, in agreement with our theoretical calculations,\nuncover further interesting features of the Weyl semimetal NbPs already exotic\nsurface. Moreover, we discuss the similarities and distinctions between the\nDirac fermions here and those in topological crystalline insulators in terms of\nsymmetry protection and topology.\n", "  We deal with the time-harmonic acoustic waves scattered by a large number of\nsmall holes, of maximal radius $a, a<<1$, arbitrary (i.e. not necessarily\nperiodically) distributed in a bounded part of a homogeneous background.\n  We show that as their number $M$ grows following the law $M:=M(a):=O(a^{-s}),\n\\; a<<1$, the collection of these holes has one of the following behaviors:\n  1. if $s<1$, then the scattered fields tend to vanish as $a$ tends to zero,\ni.e. the cluster is a soft one.\n  2. if $s=1$, then the cluster behaves as an equivalent medium modeled by a\nrefraction index, supported in a given bounded domain $\\Omega$, which is\ndescribed by certain geometry properties of the holes and their local\ndistribution. The cluster is a moderate (or intermediate) one.\n  3. if $s>1$, then the cluster behaves as a totally reflecting extended body,\nmodeled by a bounded and smooth domain $\\Omega$, i.e. the incident waves are\ntotally reflected by the surface of this extended body. The cluster is a rigid\none. These approximations are provided with explicit error estimates in terms\nof $a,\\; a<<1$.\n", "  Mn-Ni-Si precipitates (MNSPs) are known to be responsible for\nirradiation-induced hardening and embrittlement in structural alloys used in\nnuclear reactors. Studies have shown that precipitation of the MNSPs in 9-Cr\nferritic-martensitic (F-M) alloys, such as T91, is strongly associated with\nheterogeneous nucleation on dislocations, coupled with radiation-induced solute\nsegregation to these sinks. Therefore it is important to develop advanced\npredictive models for Mn-Ni-Si precipitation in F-M alloys under irradiation\nbased on an understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here we use a cluster\ndynamics model, which includes multiple effects of dislocations, to study the\nevolution of MNSPs in a commercial F-M alloy T91. The model predictions are\ncalibrated by data from proton irradiation experiments at 400 {\\deg}C.\nRadiation induced solute segregation at dislocations is evaluated by a\ncontinuum model that is integrated into the cluster dynamics simulations,\nincluding the effects of dislocations as heterogeneous nucleation sites. The\nresult shows that MNSPs in T91 are primarily irradiation-induced and, in\nparticular, both heterogeneous nucleation and radiation-induced segregation at\ndislocations are necessary to rationalize the experimental observations.\n", "  Since the discovery of the first radio pulsar fifty years ago, the population\nof neutron stars in our Galaxy has grown to over 2,600. A handful of these\nsources, exclusively seen in X-rays, show properties that are not observed in\nnormal pulsars. Despite their scarcity, they are key to understanding aspects\nof the neutron star phenomenology and evolution. The forthcoming all-sky survey\nof eROSITA will unveil the X-ray faint end of the neutron star population at\nunprecedented sensitivity; therefore, it has the unique potential to constrain\nevolutionary models and advance our understanding of the sources that are\nespecially silent in the radio and $\\gamma$-ray regimes. In this contribution I\ndiscuss the expected role of eROSITA, and the challenges it will face, at\nprobing the galactic neutron star population.\n", "  In this paper we propose a new sequential data assimilation method for\nnon-linear ordinary differential equations with compact state space. The method\nis designed so that the Lyapunov exponents of the corresponding estimation\nerror dynamics are negative, i.e. the estimation error decays exponentially\nfast. The latter is shown to be the case for generic regular flow maps if and\nonly if the observation matrix H satisfies detectability conditions: the rank\nof H must be at least as great as the number of nonnegative Lyapunov exponents\nof the underlying attractor. Numerical experiments illustrate the exponential\nconvergence of the method and the sharpness of the theory for the case of\nLorenz96 and Burgers equations with incomplete and noisy observations.\n", "  An original setup combining a very stable loading stage, an atomic force\nmicroscope and an environmental chamber, allows to obtain very stable\nsub-critical fracture propagation in oxide glasses under controlled\nenvironment, and subsequently to finely characterize the nanometric roughness\nproperties of the crack surfaces. The analysis of the surface roughness is\nconducted both in terms of the classical root mean square roughness to compare\nwith the literature, and in terms of more physically adequate indicators\nrelated to the self-affine nature of the fracture surfaces. Due to the\ncomparable nanometric scale of the surface roughness, the AFM tip size and the\ninstrumental noise, a special care is devoted to the statistical evaluation of\nthe metrologic properties. The 2 roughness amplitude of several oxide glasses\nwas shown to decrease as a function of the stress intensity factor, to be quite\ninsensitive to the relative humidity and to increase with the degree of\nheterogeneity of the glass. The results are discussed in terms of several\nmodeling arguments concerning the coupling between crack propagation,\nmaterial's heterogeneity, crack tip plastic deformation and water diffusion at\nthe crack tip. A synthetic new model is presented combining the predictions of\na model by Wiederhorn et al. [1] on the effect of the material's heterogeneity\non the crack tip stresses with the self-affine nature of the fracture surfaces.\n", "  It is a computationally hard task to certify genuine multipartite\nentanglement (GME). We investigate the relation between the norms of the\ncorrelation vectors and the detection of GME for tripartite quantum systems. A\nsufficient condition for GME and an effective lower bound for the GME\nconcurrence are derived. Several examples are considered to show the\neffectiveness of the criterion and the lower bound of GME concurrence.\n", "  We have recognized that 2D codes, i.e., a group of strongly connected\nneurosomes that can be simultaneously excited, are the basic data carriers for\nmemory in a brain. An echoing mechanism between two neighboring layers of\nneurosomes is assumed to establish temporary memory, and repeating processes\nenhance the formation of long-term memory. Creation and degradation of memory\ninformation are statistically. The maximum capacity of memory storage in a\nhuman brain is estimated to be one billion of 2D codes. By triggering one or\nmore neurosomes in a neurosome-based 2D code, the whole strongly connected\nneurosome network is capable of exciting simultaneously and projecting its\nexcitation onto an analysis layer of neurons in cortex, thus retrieving the\nstored memory data. The capability of comparing two 2D codes in the analysis\nlayer is one of the major brain functions.\n", "  The observational manifestation of a neutron star is strongly connected with\nthe properties of its magnetic field. During the star's lifetime, the field\nstrength and its changes dominate the thermo-rotational evolution and the\nsource phenomenology across the electromagnetic spectrum. Signatures of\nmagnetic field evolution are best traced among elusive groups of X-ray emitting\nisolated neutron stars (INSs), which are mostly quiet in the radio and\n$\\gamma$-ray wavelengths. It is thus important to investigate and survey INSs\nin X-rays in the hope of discovering peculiar sources and the long-sought\nmissing links that will help us to advance our understanding of neutron star\nevolution. The Extended R\\\"ontgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array\n(\\eROS), the primary instrument on the forthcoming Spectrum-RG mission, will\nscan the X-ray sky with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. The survey\nhas thus the unique potential to unveil the X-ray faint end of the neutron star\npopulation and probe sources that cannot be assessed by standard pulsar\nsurveys.\n", "  Our goal was to compare the open cluster photometric distance scale of the\nglobal survey of star clusters in the Milky Way (MWSC) with the distances\nderived from trigonometric parallaxes from the Gaia DR1/TGAS catalogue and to\ninvestigate to which degree and extent both scales agree. We compared the\nparallax-based and photometry-based distances of 5743 cluster stars selected as\nmembers of 1118 clusters based on their kinematic and photometric MWSC\nmembership probabilities. We found good overall agreement between trigonometric\nand photometric distances of open cluster stars. The residuals between them\nwere small and unbiased up to $\\log (d,[pc]) \\approx 2.8$. If we considered\nonly the most populated clusters and used cluster distances obtained from the\nmean trigonometric parallax of their MWSC members, the good agreement of the\ndistance scales continued up to $\\log (d,[pc]) \\approx 3.3$.\n", "  In this work we demonstrate the synthesis of millimetre-sized single-crystals\nof graphene, achievable in a commercially-available cold-wall CVD reactor, and\nseveral different approaches to transfer it from the growth substrate to a\ntarget substrate of choice. We confirm the high crystal quality of this\nmaterial using various characterisation techniques, including optical and\nscanning electron microscopy as well as Raman spectroscopy. By performing field\neffect and quantum Hall effect measurements we demonstrate that the electronic\nproperties of such single-crystals are comparable to those of ideal\nmechanically exfoliated flakes of graphene. Several applications of this\nhigh-quality material are also reviewed.\n", "  I describe a project to open a new territory of quantum field theory where\nthe fields live not on a space-time manifold but on certain complete metric\nspaces of (n-1)-dimensional objects (defects) in a 2n-dimensional space-time M.\nThese metric spaces are \"quasi Riemann surfaces\"; they are formally analogous\nto Riemann surfaces. Every construction of a 2d conformal field theory is to\ngive an analogous construction of a cft on the quasi Riemann surfaces, and\nthereby a cft on M. The global symmetry group of the 2d cft becomes a local\ngauge symmetry. Ordinary local quantum fields in space-time are constructed by\nrestricting to small objects. The project is based on writing the free n-form\nin 2n dimensions as the 2d gaussian model on the quasi Riemann surfaces. This\nnote is a summary of the main points of arXiv:1605.03279.\n", "  In this Letter we follow the short-ranged Syrian refugees' migration to\nLebanon as documented by the UNHCR. We propose a model inspired by the\nDebye-H\\\"{u}ckel theory and show that it properly predicts the refugees'\nmobility while the gravity model fails. We claim that the interaction between\norigin cities attenuates and/or extenuates the flux to destinations, and\nconsequently, in analogy with the effective charges of interacting particles in\na plasma, these source cities are characterized by effective populations\ndetermined by their pairwise remoteness/closeness and defined by areas of\ncontrol between the fighting parties.\n", "  Meta-conformal transformations are constructed as dynamical symmetries of the\nlinear transport equation in $d$ spatial dimensions. In one and two dimensions,\nthe associated Lie algebras are infinite-dimensional and isomorphic to the\ndirect sum of either two or three Virasoro algebras. Co-variant two-point\ncorrelators are derived and possible physical applications are discussed.\n", "  The Future Circular Collider (FCC) is a crucial step forward to study new\nPhysics beyond the standard model and to test fundamental aspects as space-time\nminimal length and Lorentz violations. As an example, a possible enhancement of\n$e^+e^-$ pair production due to non-commutative effects, catalyzed by the huge\nmagnetic field produced at the beginning of a heavy ion collision at FCC, is\ndiscussed. In noncommutative electrodynamics a free photon in the magnetic\nbackground can produce a $e^+e^-$ pair. In particular for hard photons with\ntransverse energy $100-600$ GeV at the beginning of the collision and for a\nparticular kinematical setting of the pair , i.e. large total transverse\nmomentum in the reaction plane and invariant mass in the range $200-400$ MeV,\nthe non-commutative contribution, evaluated with the present bound of the\nnon-commuativity fundamental area , can be significant. Other, more exotic,\npossible signatures of space-time non-commutativity are also considered.\n", "  Using the signal and idler photons produced by parametric downconversion, we\nreport an experimental observation of a violation of the Bell inequality for\nenergy and time based purely on the geometric phases of the signal and idler\nphotons. We thus show that energy-time entanglement between the signal and\nidler photons can be explored by means of their geometric phases. These results\nmay have important practical implications for quantum information science by\nproviding an additional means by which entanglement can be manipulated.\n", "  In spite of great appeal of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors for\nelectronics and optoelectronics, to achieve required charge carrier\nconcentrations by means of chemical doping remains a challenge, due to large\ndefect ionization energies (IEs). Here by decomposing the defect IEs into the\nneutral single-electron defect level, the structural relaxation energy gain,\nand the electronic relaxation energy cost, we propose a conceptual picture that\nthe large defect IEs are caused by two effects of reduced dimensionality. While\nthe quantum confinement effect (QCE) makes the neutral single-electron point\ndefect levels deep, the reduced screening effect (RE) leads to high energy cost\nfor the electronic relaxation. The first-principles calculations for monolayer,\nfew-layer, and bulk black phosphorus (BP), MoS2, and ReS2 with strong, medium,\nand weak interlayer interactions, respectively, as examples, do demonstrate the\ngeneral trend. Based on the gained insight into defect behaviors, strategies\ncan be envisaged for reducing defect IEs and improving charge carrier doping.\nUsing BP monolayer either embedded into dielectric continuum or encapsulated\nbetween two h-BN layers, as practical examples, we demonstrate the feasibility\nof increasing the screening to reduce the defect IEs and boost carrier\nconcentration. Our analysis is expected to help achieving effective carrier\ndoping and thus to open ways towards more extensive applications of 2D\nsemiconductors.\n", "  Despite increasing focus on data publication and discovery in materials\nscience and related fields, the global view of materials data is highly sparse.\nThis sparsity encourages training models on the union of multiple datasets, but\nsimple unions can prove problematic as (ostensibly) equivalent properties may\nbe measured or computed differently depending on the data source. These hidden\ncontextual differences introduce irreducible errors into analyses,\nfundamentally limiting their accuracy. Transfer learning, where information\nfrom one dataset is used to inform a model on another, can be an effective tool\nfor bridging sparse data while preserving the contextual differences in the\nunderlying measurements. Here, we describe and compare three techniques for\ntransfer learning: multi-task, difference, and explicit latent variable\narchitectures. We show that difference architectures are most accurate in the\nmulti-fidelity case of mixed DFT and experimental band gaps, while multi-task\nmost improves classification performance of color with band gaps. For\nactivation energies of steps in NO reduction, the explicit latent variable\nmethod is not only the most accurate, but also enjoys cancellation of errors in\nfunctions that depend on multiple tasks. These results motivate the publication\nof high quality materials datasets that encode transferable information,\nindependent of industrial or academic interest in the particular labels, and\nencourage further development and application of transfer learning methods to\nmaterials informatics problems.\n", "  The structural analysis of shape boundaries leads to the characterization of\nobjects as well as to the understanding of shape properties. The literature on\ngraphs and networks have contributed to the structural characterization of\nshapes with different theoretical approaches. We performed a study on the\nrelationship between the shape architecture and the network topology\nconstructed over the shape boundary. For that, we used a method for network\nmodeling proposed in 2009. Firstly, together with curvature analysis, we\nevaluated the proposed approach for regular polygons. This way, it was possible\nto investigate how the network measurements vary according to some specific\nshape properties. Secondly, we evaluated the performance of the proposed shape\ndescriptor in classification tasks for three datasets, accounting for both\nreal-world and synthetic shapes. We demonstrated that not only degree related\nmeasurements are capable of distinguishing classes of objects. Yet, when using\nmeasurements that account for distinct properties of the network structure, the\nconstruction of the shape descriptor becomes more computationally efficient.\nGiven the fact the network is dynamically constructed, the number of iterations\ncan be reduced. The proposed approach accounts for a more robust set of\nstructural measurements, that improved the discriminant power of the shape\ndescriptors.\n", "  A forward-looking facility such as the next generation Very Large Array\n(ngVLA) requires forward-looking science. The ngVLA will enable stellar wind\ndetections or robust constraints on upper limits sufficient to bridge the gap\nbetween current radio upper limits on cool stellar mass loss and current\nindirect estimates of stellar mass loss from astrospheric measurements. This\nwill aid in understanding the interplay between the rotational spindown of\nstars and wind mass loss rates, important for an understanding not just of\nstellar astrophysics but the impact on planet formation and planetary dynamos.\nRadio observations are currently the only way to explore accelerated particles\nin cool stellar environments. The upgraded sensitivity of the ngVLA will enable\nthe detection and characterization of essentially all classes of radio-active\ncool stars in the galaxy. This will open up new fields of study and contribute\nto the understanding of the stellar contribution to exo-space weather,\nespecially with the emphasis on sensitivity above a frequency of about 10 GHz,\nwhere the transition to optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission occurs. These\ntopics connect and extend the key science topics in the cradle of life, in an\narea which there is both high academic as well as popular interest, and which\nis expected to continue into the next several decades.\n", "  Multilevel self-assembly involving small structured groups of nano-particles\nprovides new routes to development of functional materials with a sophisticated\narchitecture. Apart from the inter-particle forces, the geometrical shapes and\ncompatibility of the building blocks are decisive factors in each phase of\ngrowth. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of these processes is\nessential for the design of large assemblies of desired properties. Here, we\nintroduce a computational model for cooperative self-assembly with simultaneous\nattachment of structured groups of particles, which can be described by\nsimplexes (connected pairs, triangles, tetrahedrons and higher order cliques)\nto a growing network, starting from a small seed. The model incorporates\ngeometric rules that provide suitable nesting spaces for the new group and the\nchemical affinity $\\nu$ of the system to accepting an excess number of\nparticles. For varying chemical affinity, we grow different classes of\nassemblies by binding the cliques of distributed sizes. Furthermore, to\ncharacterise the emergent large-scale structures, we use the metrics of graph\ntheory and algebraic topology of graphs, and 4-point test for the intrinsic\nhyperbolicity of the networks. Our results show that higher Q-connectedness of\nthe appearing simplicial complexes can arise due to only geometrical factors,\ni.e., for $\\nu = 0$, and that it can be effectively modulated by changing the\nchemical potential and the polydispersity of the size of binding simplexes. For\ncertain parameters in the model we obtain networks of mono-dispersed clicks,\ntriangles and tetrahedrons, which represent the geometrical descriptors that\nare relevant in quantum physics and frequently occurring chemical clusters.\n", "  For most stochastic dynamical systems, variables which are tightly regulated\ntend to respond slowly to external changes. This idea is often discussed for\napplicable systems, within a linear response regime, through the Fluctuation\nDissipation Theorem (FDT). In a previous paper, we proposed a phenomenological\nmodel for the response of the cell cycle duration distribution to environmental\nchanges which correlated the width of this distribution to response efficiency\nwhen FDT was not applicable. Here we emphasize how that model may be used to\nillustrate this general principle, that the stochasticity of a variable while\ninversely proportional to stability is often directly proportional to lability.\nComparisons are made between this discrete-time model and the simple harmonic\noscillator. We then consider a simple continuous dynamical system, the 'Active\nOscillator', which illustrates this principle in another fashion.\n", "  Acoustic metamaterials have become a novel and effective way to control sound\nwaves and design acoustic devices. In this study, we design a 3D acoustic\nmetamaterial lens (AML) to achieve point-to-point acoustic communication in\nair: any acoustic source (i.e. a speaker) in air enclosed by such an AML can\nproduce an acoustic image where the acoustic wave is focused (i.e. the field\nintensity is at a maximum, and the listener can receive the information), while\nthe acoustic field at other spatial positions is low enough that listeners can\nhear almost nothing. Unlike a conventional elliptical reflective mirror, the\nacoustic source can be moved around inside our proposed AML. Numerical\nsimulations are given to verify the performance of the proposed AML.\n", "  We demonstrate that, in a quantum simulation protocol based on the Hubbard\nmodel, correlated noise in the Hubbard parameters leads to arbitrarily long\nplateaux in the state-preparation fidelity as a function of elapsed time. We\nargue that this correlated-noise scenario is the generic one in the cold-atom\ncontext, since all of the Hubbard-model parameters ultimately depend on the\nsame set of lasers. We explain the formation of such a plateau using the\nBloch-sphere representation, deriving analytical expressions for its start and\nend times and its height.\n", "  We present an approach to achieve efficient single-photon frequency\nconversion in the microwave domain based on coherent control in superconducting\nquantum circuits, which consist of a driven artificial atom coupled to a\nsemi-infinite transmission line. Using the full quantum-mechanical method, we\nanalyze the single-photon scattering process in this system and find that\nsingle-photon frequency up- or down-conversion with efficiency close to unity\ncan be achieved by adjusting the parameters of the control field applied to the\nartificial atom. We further show that our approach is experimentally feasible\nin currently available superconducting flux qubit circuits.\n", "  Multidimensional numerical simulations of a homogeneous, chemically reactive\ngas were used to study ignition, flame stability, and\ndeflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in a supersonic combustor. The\nconfiguration studied was a rectangular channel with a supersonic inflow of\nstoichiometric ethylene-oxygen and a transimissive outflow boundary. The\ncalculation is initialized with a velocity in the computational domain equal to\nthat of the inflow, which is held constant for the duration of the calculation.\nThe compressible reactive Navier-Stokes equations were solved by a high-order\nnumerical algorithm on an adapting mesh. This paper describes two calculations,\none with a Mach 3 inflow and one with Mach 5.25. In the Mach 3 case, the\nfuel-oxidizer mixture does not ignite and the flow reaches a steady-state\noblique shock train structure. In the Mach 5.25 case, ignition occurs in the\nboundary layers and the flame front becomes unstable due to a Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability at the interface between the burned and unburned gas. Growth of the\nreaction front and expansion of the burned gas compress and preheat the\nunburned gas. DDT occurs in several locations, initiating both at the flame\nfront and in the unburned gas, due to an energy-focusing mechanism. The growth\nof the flame instability that leads to DDT is analyzed using the Atwood number\nparameter.\n", "  It is known that gas bubbles on the surface bounding a fluid flow can change\nthe coefficient of friction and affect the parameters of the boundary layer. In\nthis paper, we propose a method that allows us to create, in the near-wall\nregion, a thin layer of liquid filled with bubbles. It will be shown that if\nthere is an oscillating piezoelectric plate on the surface bounding a liquid,\nthen, under certain conditions, cavitation develops in the boundary layer. The\nrelationship between the parameters of cavitation and the characteristics of\nthe piezoelectric plate oscillations is obtained. Possible applications are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We propose to use neural networks to estimate the rates of coherent and\nincoherent processes in quantum systems from continuous measurement records. In\nparticular, we adapt an image recognition algorithm to recognize the patterns\nin experimental signals and link them to physical quantities. We demonstrate\nthat the parameter estimation works unabatedly in the presence of detector\nimperfections which complicate or rule out Bayesian filter analyses.\n"]}
