In this work we\ndiscuss the general properties of the radio emission expected in a wide range\nof dark matter halos, from local dwarf spheroidal galaxies to large and distant\ngalaxy clusters with the aim to determine the neutralino dark matter detection\nprospects of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The analysis of the SKA\ndetection of dark matter(DM)-induced radio emission is presented for structures\nspanning a wide range of masses and redshifts, and we also analyze the limits\nthat the SKA can set on the thermally averaged neutralino annihilation\ncross-section in the event of non-detection. To this aim, we construct a model\nof the redshift evolution of the radio emissions of dark matter halos and apply\nit to generate predicted fluxes from a range of neutralino masses and\nannihilation channels for the dark matter halos surrounding dwarf galaxies,\ngalaxies and galaxy clusters. Using the available SKA performance predictions\nand its ability to determine an independent measure of the magnetic field in\ncosmic structures, we explore both the detailed detection prospects and the\nupper-bounds that might be placed on the neutralino annihilation cross-section\nin the event of non-detection. We find that the SKA can access a neutralino\nparameter space far larger than that of any preceding indirect-detection\nexperiment, also improving on the realistic CTA detection prospects, with the\npossibility of setting cross-section upper-bounds up to four orders of\nmagnitude below the thermal relic density bound. Additionally, we find that\nneutralino radio emissions carry redshift-independent signatures of the\ndominant annihilation channel and of neutralino mass, offering therefore a\nmeans to identify such non-thermal emissions within the observing frequency\nrange of the SKA.\n", "  We derive a novel and rigorous correction to the classical Reynolds\nlubrication approximation for fluids with viscosity depending upon the\npressure. Our analysis shows that the pressure dependence of viscosity leads to\nadditional nonlinear terms related to the shear-rate and arising from a non\nnegligible cross-film pressure. We present a numerical comparison between the\nclassical Reynolds equation and our modified equation and conclude that the\nmodified equation leads to the prediction of higher pressures and viscosities\nin the flow domain.\n", "  We recalculate the magnetic moment of neutrinos in a hot and dense medium.\nThe magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos is modified at high temperature and\nchemical potential. We show that the magnetic dipole moment of electron\nneutrino does not get a significant contribution from thermal background to\nmeet the cosmological bound. However, chemical potential contribution to the\nmagnetic moment is non-ignorable even when chemical potential is an order of\nmagnitude greater than the electron mass. It is demonstrated that this effect\nis more significant in the models with an extended Higgs sector through\nneutrino mixing.\n", "  Particle collisions are considered within the context of $f(R)$ gravity\ndescribed by $f(R)=R+2\\alpha\\sqrt{R}$, where $R$ stands for the Ricci scalar\nand $\\alpha$ is a non-zero constant. The center of mass (CM) energy of head-on\ncolliding particles moving in opposite radial directions near the naked\nsingularity/horizon are considered. Collision of particles in the same\ndirection near the event horizon yields finite energy while the energy of\noppositely moving particles grows unbounded. Addition of a cosmological\nconstant does not change the feature. Collision of a massless outgoing photon\nwith an infalling particle and collision of two oppositely moving photons\nfollowing null-geodesics are also taken into account.\n", "  The recently proposed centre of mass decoherence of composite objects due to\ngravitational time-dilation [Pikovski et al., Nat.Phys. 15. June (2015);\narXiv:1311.1095] is confronted with the principle of equivalence between\ngravity and observer's acceleration. In the laboratory frame, a positional\nsuperposition $\\vert x_1\\rangle+\\vert x_2\\rangle$ can quickly decohere whereas\nin the free-falling frame, as I argue, the superposition can survive for almost\narbitrary long times. The paradoxical result is explained by the so far\nunappreciated feature of the proposed model: the centre of mass canonical\nsubsystem is ambiguous, it is different in the laboratory and the free-falling\nframes, respectively.\n  As long as the centre-of-mass motion of the composite object is\nnon-relativistic, a simple Galilean-covariant Hamiltonian represents the\nPikovski {\\it et al} theory with exactly the same physical predictions. We\nemphasize the power of this Hamiltonian to understand essential features of the\nPikovski {\\it et al} theory and to moderate a few divergent statements in\nrecent works.\n", "  The correct description of nondynamic correlation by electronic structure\nmethods not belonging to the multireference family is a challenging issue. The\ntransition of $D_{2h}$ to $D_{4h}$ symmetry in H$_4$ molecule is among the most\nsimple archetypal examples to illustrate the consequences of missing nondynamic\ncorrelation effects. The resurge of interest in density matrix functional\nmethods has brought several new methods including the family of Piris Natural\nOrbital Functionals (PNOF). In this work we compare PNOF5 and PNOF6, which\ninclude nondynamic electron correlation effects to some extent, with other\nstandard ab initio methods in the H$_4$ $D_{4h}/D_{2h}$ potential energy\nsurface. Thus far, the wrongful behavior of single-reference methods at the\n$D_{2h}-D_{4h}$ transition of H$_4$ has been attributed to wrong account of\nnondynamic correlation effects, whereas in geminal-based approaches it has been\nassigned to a wrong coupling of spins and the localized nature of the orbitals.\nWe will show that actually $\\textit{interpair}$ nondynamic correlation is the\nkey to a cusp-free qualitatively correct description of H$_4$ PES. By\nintroducing $\\textit{interpair}$ nondynamic correlation, PNOF6 is shown to\navoid cusps and provide the correct smooth PES features at distances close to\nequilibrium, total and local spin properties along with the correct electron\ndelocalization, as reflected by natural orbitals and multicenter delocalization\nindices.\n", "  The Fermi-LAT observation of a gamma-ray excess from the galactic-centre, as\nwell as the PAMELA, AMS, and AMS-2 anti-particle excesses, and the recent claim\nof a Fermi-LAT excess in the Reticulum-2 dwarf galaxy have been put forward as\nsignatures compatible with of neutralino dark matter. These are of particular\ninterest as the neutralino annihilation models which fit these observations\nmight have observable consequences from radio to gamma-ray emission. Since dark\nmatter is expected to be a major matter constituent of cosmic structure, these\nmulti-frequency consequences should also be common to structures across the\nmass spectrum. Thus, in this work we make predictions for the multi-frequency\nspectra of three well-known sources dominated by dark matter, e.g. the Coma\ncluster, the galaxy M81, and the Draco dwarf galaxy using models favoured by\ndark matter interpretations of the aforementioned observations. We pay special\nattention to the consequences for these models when their cross-sections are\nrenormalised to reproduce the recent gamma-ray excess observed in the\nReticulum-2 dwarf galaxy, which throw a dark matter interpretation of this\nexcess into doubt. We find that the multi-frequency data of Coma and Draco\ndisfavour the dark matter interpretation of the AMS, PAMELA and Fermi\nanti-particle excess. Models derived from Fermi-LAT galactic centre\nobservations present somewhat lesser conflicts. We determine the detection\nprospects of the Square Kilometre Array, the Cherenkov Telescope Array, as well\nas the ASTROGAM and ASTRO-H satellites for the studied models. This\ndemonstrates that ASTRO-H is well positioned to probe the X-ray emissions from\nneutralino annihilation. Thus, multi-frequency observation with the next\ngeneration experiments will allow for unprecedented sensitivity to the\nneutralino parameter space.\n", "  The aim of this article is to investigate how various Riemann Hypotheses\nwould follow only from properties of the prime numbers. To this end, we\nconsider two classes of $L$-functions, namely, non-principal Dirichlet and\nthose based on cusp forms. The simplest example of the latter is based on the\nRamanujan tau arithmetic function. For both classes we prove that if a\nparticular trigonometric series involving sums of multiplicative characters\nover primes is $O(\\sqrt{N})$, then the Euler product converges in the right\nhalf of the critical strip. When this result is combined with the functional\nequation, the non-trivial zeros are constrained to lie on the critical line. We\nargue that this $\\sqrt{N}$ growth is a consequence of the series behaving like\na one-dimensional random walk. Based on these results we obtain an equation\nwhich relates every individual non-trivial zero of the $L$-function to a sum\ninvolving all the primes. Finally, we briefly mention important differences for\nprincipal Dirichlet $L$-functions due to the existence of the pole at $s=1$, in\nwhich the Riemann $\\zeta$-function is a particular case.\n", "  Mainly due to their outstanding performance the position sensitive silicon\ndetectors are widely used in the tracking systems of High Energy Physics\nexperiments such as the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb at LHC, the world's largest\nparticle physics accelerator at CERN, Geneva. The foreseen upgrade of the LHC\nto its high luminosity (HL) phase (HL-LHC scheduled for 2023), will enable the\nuse of maximal physics potential of the facility. After 10 years of operation\nthe expected fluence will expose the tracking systems at HL-LHC to a radiation\nenvironment that is beyond the capacity of the present system design. Thus, for\nthe required upgrade of the all-silicon central trackers extensive measurements\nand simulation studies for silicon sensors of different designs and materials\nwith sufficient radiation tolerance have been initiated within the RD50\nCollaboration.\n  Supplementing measurements, simulations are in vital role for e.g. device\nstructure optimization or predicting the electric fields and trapping in the\nsilicon sensors. The main objective of the device simulations in the RD50\nCollaboration is to develop an approach to model and predict the performance of\nthe irradiated silicon detectors using professional software. The first\nsuccessfully developed quantitative models for radiation damage, based on two\neffective midgap levels, are able to reproduce the experimentally observed\ndetector characteristics like leakage current, full depletion voltage and\ncharge collection efficiency (CCE). Recent implementations of additional traps\nat the SiO$_2$/Si interface or close to it have expanded the scope of the\nexperimentally agreeing simulations to such surface properties as the\ninterstrip resistance and capacitance, and the position dependency of CCE for\nstrip sensors irradiated up to $\\sim$$1.5\\times10^{15}$\nn$_{\\textrm{eq}}\\textrm{cm}^{-2}$.\n", "  We obtain exact solutions to the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator in a\nnon-commutative complex phase space to first order in the non-commutativity\nparameter. We derive the exact non-commutative energy levels and show that the\nenergy levels split to $2m$ levels. We find that the non-commutativity plays\nthe role of a magnetic field interacting automatically with the spin of a\nparticle induced by the non-commutativity of complex phase space. The effect of\nthe non-commutativity parameter on the thermal properties is discussed. It is\nfound that the dependence of the heat capacity $C_V$ on the non-commutative\nparameter gives rise to a negative quantity. Phenomenologically, this\neffectively confirms the presence of the effects of self-gravitation induced by\nthe non-commutativity of complex phase space.\n", "  The lowest-lying states of LiH have been widely used to develop and calibrate\nmany different methods in quantum mechanics. In this paper we show that the\nelectron-transfer processes occurring in these two states are a difficult test\nfor chemical bonding descriptors and can be used to assess new bonding\ndescriptors on its ability to recognize the harpoon mechanism. To this aim, we\nstudy the bond formation mechanism in a series of diatomic molecules. In all\nstudied electron-reorganization mechanisms, the maximal electron-transfer\nvariation point along the bond formation path occurs when about half electron\nhas been transferred from one atom to another. If the process takes places\nthrough a harpoon mechanism, this point of the reaction path coincides with the\navoided crossing. The electron sharing indices and one-dimensional plots of the\nelectron localization function and the Laplacian of the electron density along\nthe molecular axis can be used to monitor the bond formation in diatomics and\nprovide a distinction between the harpoon mechanism and a regular\nelectron-reorganization process.\n", "  A simple comparison between the exact and approximate correlation components\nU of the electron-electron repulsion energy of several states of few-electron\nharmonium atoms with varying confinement strengths provides a superior\nvalidation tool for 1-matrix functionals. The robustness of this tool is\nclearly demonstrated in a survey of 14 known functionals, which reveals their\nsubstandard performance within different electron correlation regimes. Unlike\nspot-testing that employs dissociation curves of diatomic molecules or more\nextensive benchmarking against experimental atomization energies of molecules\ncomprising one of standard sets, the present approach not only uncovers the\nflaws and patent failures of the functionals but, even more importantly, allows\nfor pinpointing their root causes. Since the approximate values of U are\ncomputed at exact 1-densities, the testing requires minimal programming, and\nthus is particularly useful in quick screening of new functionals.\n", "  We introduce a new electronic aromaticity index, AV1245, consisting in the\naverage of the 4-center MCI values along the ring that keep a positional\nrelationship of 1,2,4,5. AV1245 measures the extent of transferability of the\ndelocalized electrons between bonds 1-2 and 4-5, which is expected to be large\nin conjugated circuits and, therefore, in aromatic molecules. A new algorithm\nfor the calculation of MCI for large rings is also introduced and used to\nproduce the data for the calibration of the new aromaticity index. AV1245 does\nnot rely on reference values, does not suffer from large numerical precision\nerrors, and it does not present any limitation on the nature of atoms, the\nmolecular geometry or the level of calculation. It is a size-extensive measure\nwith a small computational cost that grows linearly with the number of ring\nmembers. Therefore, it is specially suitable to study the aromaticity of large\nmolecular rings as those occurring in belt-shaped M\\\"obius structures or\nporphyrins.\n", "  In this paper, we describe the generation of the CPT-even, aether-like terms\nvia the new CPT-even magnetic-like coupling. We carry out a study the loop\ncorrections generated by this coupling. Previous investigations has been\ninitiated on this issue and we have extended them to studying of higher-point\nfunctions, of quantum corrections to vertices of the interaction and to\ntwo-point function of the spinor field.\n", "  We report the discovery of a statistically significant hardening in the\nFermi-LAT $\\gamma$-ray spectrum of Centaurus A's core, with the spectral index\nhardening from $\\Gamma_{1}=2.73 \\pm 0.02$ to $\\Gamma_{1}=2.29 \\pm 0.07$ at a\nbreak energy of ($2.6 \\pm 0.3$) GeV. Using a likelihood analysis, we find no\nevidence for flux variability in Cen A's core lightcurve above or below the\nspectral break when considering the entire 8 year period. Interestingly,\nhowever, the first $\\sim3.5$ years of the low energy lightcurve shows evidence\nof flux variability at the $\\sim3.5 \\sigma$ confidence level. To understand the\norigin of this spectral break, we assume that the low energy component below\nthe break feature originates from leptons in Centaurus A's radio jet and we\ninvestigate the possibility that the high energy component above the spectral\nbreak is due to an additional source of very high energy particles near the\ncore of Cen A. We show for the first time that the observed $\\gamma$-ray\nspectrum of an Active Galactic Nucleus is compatible with either a very large\nlocalized enhancement (referred to as a spike) in the dark matter halo profile\nor a population of millisecond pulsars. Our work constitutes the first robust\nindication that new $\\gamma$-ray production mechanisms can explain the emission\nfrom active galaxies and could provide tantalizing first evidence for the\nclustering of heavy dark matter particles around black holes.\n", "  We introduce a fast and accurate heuristic for adaptive tomography that\naddresses many of the limitations of prior methods. Previous approaches were\neither too computationally intensive or tailored to handle special cases such\nas single qubits or pure states. By contrast, our approach combines the\nefficiency of online optimization with generally applicable and well-motivated\ndata-processing techniques. We numerically demonstrate these advantages in\nseveral scenarios including mixed states, higher-dimensional systems, and\nrestricted measurements.\n", "  We show how the change from Eulerian to Lagrangian coordinates for the\ntwo-component Camassa-Holm system can be understood in terms of certain\nreparametrizations of the underlying isospectral problem. The respective\ncoordinates correspond to different normalizations of an associated first order\nsystem. In particular, we will see that the two-component Camassa-Holm system\nin Lagrangian variables is completely integrable as well.\n", "  The non-monotonic behavior of the electron repulsion energy and the\ninterelectronic distance, as a function of the internuclear separation, in the\n$^{3}\\Pi_{u}$ excited state of the hydrogen molecule has been assessed by\nexplicitly calculation and analysis of the electron-pair density distribution\nfunctions from high level ab initio Full Configuration Interaction wave\nfunctions, for both the $^{3}\\Pi_{u}$ and the $^{1}\\Pi_{u}$ states.\nAdditionally, the Hund's rule as applied to these two states has been accounted\nfor in terms of simple electronic shielding effects induced by wave function\nantisymmetrization.\n", "  Most existing cosmological entanglement studies are focused on the isotropic\nRobertson-Walker (RW) spacetime. Here we go beyond this limitation and study\nthe influence of anisotropy on entanglement generated by dynamical spacetime.\nSince the isotropic spacetime is viewed as a background medium and the\nanisotropy is incorporated as perturbation, we decompose entanglement entropy\ninto isotropic and anisotropic contributions. The latter is shown to be\nnon-negligible by analyzing two cosmological models with weak and conformal\ncoupling. We also show the possibility of using entanglement to infer about\nuniverse features.\n", "  Several recent results on thermodynamics have been obtained using the tools\nof quantum information theory and resource theories. So far, the resource\ntheories utilised to describe thermodynamics have assumed the existence of an\ninfinite thermal reservoir, by declaring that thermal states at some background\ntemperature come for free. Here, we propose a resource theory of quantum\nthermodynamics without a background temperature, so that no states at all come\nfor free. We apply this resource theory to the case of many non-interacting\nsystems, and show that all quantum states are classified by their entropy and\naverage energy, even arbitrarily far away from equilibrium. This implies that\nthermodynamics takes place in a two-dimensional convex set that we call the\nenergy-entropy diagram. The answers to many resource-theoretic questions about\nthermodynamics can be read off from this diagram, such as the efficiency of a\nheat engine consisting of finite reservoirs, or the rate of conversion between\ntwo states. This allows us to consider a resource theory which puts work and\nheat on an equal footing, and serves as a model for other resource theories.\n", "  Using 567 $pb^{-1}$ of data collected with the BESIII detector at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=$ 4.599 $GeV$, near the\n$\\Lambda_{c}^{+}\\Lambda_{c}^{-}$ threshold, we study the singly\nCabibbo-suppressed decays $\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to p\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ and\n$\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to pK^{+}K^{-}$. By normalizing with respect to the\nCabibbo-favored decay $\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to pK^{-}\\pi^{+}$, we obtain ratios of\nbranching fractions: $\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to\np\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-})}{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to pK^{-}\\pi^{+})}$ = $(6.70 \\pm\n0.48 \\pm 0.25)\\%$, $\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to\np\\phi)}{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to pK^{-}\\pi^{+})}$ = $(1.81 \\pm 0.33 \\pm\n0.13)\\%$, and $\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to\npK^{+}K^{-}_{\\text{non-}\\phi})}{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to pK^{-}\\pi^{+})}$ =\n$(9.36 \\pm 2.22 \\pm 0.71)\\times10^{-3}$, where the uncertainties are\nstatistical and systematic, respectively. The absolute branching fractions are\nalso presented. Among these measurements, the decay $\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to\np\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ is observed for the first time, and the precision of the\nbranching fraction for $\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to pK^{+}K^{-}_{\\text{non-}\\phi}$ and\n$\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to p\\phi$ is significantly improved.\n", "  The exchange-correlation hole density of the infinitely stretched\n(dissociated) hydrogen molecule can be cast into a closed analytical form by\nusing its exact wave function. This permits to obtain an explicit\nexchange-correlation energy functional of the electron density which allows for\nits functional derivation to yield the corresponding Kohh-Sham effective\nexchange-correlation potential. We have shown that this exchange-correlation\nfunctional is exact for the dissociated hydrogen molecule, yields its\ndissociation energy correctly, and its corresponding exchange-correlation\npotential has the correct $-1/r$ asymptotic behavior.\n", "  The Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA) electronic energy partition is an\nimportant method in the field of quantum chemical topology which has given\nimportant insights of different systems and processes in physical chemistry.\nThere have been several attempts to include Electron Correlation (EC) in the\nIQA approach, for example, through DFT and Hartree-Fock/Coupled-Cluster (HF/CC)\ntransition densities. This work addresses the separation of EC in Fermi and\nCoulomb correlation and its effect upon the IQA analysis by taking into account\nspin-dependent one- and two-electron matrices $D^{\\mathrm{HF/CC}}_{p\\sigma q\n\\sigma}$ and $d^{\\mathrm{HF/CC}}_{p\\sigma q\\sigma r\\tau s\\tau}$ wherein\n$\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ represent either of the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ spin\nprojections. We illustrate this approach by considering BeH$_2$,BH, CN$^-$, HF,\nLiF, NO$^+$, LiH, H$_2$O$\\cdots$H$_2$O and C$_2$H$_2$, which comprise non-polar\ncovalent, polar covalent, ionic and hydrogen bonded systems. The same and\ndifferent spin contributions to ($i$) the net, interaction and\nexchange-correlation IQA energy components and ($ii$) delocalisation indices\ndefined in the quantum theory of atoms in molecules are carefully examined and\ndiscussed. Overall, we expect that this kind of analysis will yield important\ninsights about Fermi and Coulomb correlation in covalent bonding,\nintermolecular interactions and electron delocalisation in physical chemistry.\n", "  It is well known that in a two-slit interference experiment, if the\ninformation, on which of the two paths the particle followed, is stored in a\nquantum path detector, the interference is destroyed. However, in a setup where\nthis path information is \"erased\", the interference can reappear. Such a setup\nis known as a quantum eraser. A generalization of quantum eraser to a\nthree-slit interference is theoretically analyzed. It is shown that three\ncomplementary interference patterns can arise out of the quantum erasing\nprocess.\n", "  The standard electroweak interaction is here re-assessed to accommodate two\ndifferent situations in Particle Physics. The first one is a $Z'$-model at the\nTeV-scale physics. The second one tackles the recent discussion of a possible\nfifth force mediated by a $17$-MeV X-boson associated with an electron-positron\nemission in the transition of an excited 8-Beryllium to its ground state. The\nanomaly-free model that provides these two scenarios is based on an $SU_{L}(2)\n\\times U_{R}(1)_{J} \\times U(1)_{K}$-symmetry. It yields a new massive neutral\nboson, an exotic massive neutral fermion, right-neutrinos and an additional\nneutral Higgs particle, which stems from a supplementary Higgs field,\nintroduced along with the usual Higgs doublet responsible for the electroweak\nbreaking and the masses of $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$. Yukawa interactions of the\ntwo scalars generate the masses of the Standard Model leptons, neutrinos and a\nnew exotic fermion of the model. The vacuum expectation values of the Higgses\nfix up two independent energy scales. One of them is the well-confirmed\nelectroweak scale, $246 \\, \\mbox{GeV}$, whereas the other one is set up by\nadopting an experimental estimate for the $Z'$-mass.\n", "  The stellar enhancement of the cluster NGC 110 is investigated in various\noptical and infrared (IR) bands. The radial density profile of the IR region\ndoes not show a stellar enhancement in the central region of the cluster. This\nstellar deficiency may be occurring by undetected fainter stars due to the\ncontamination effect of massive stars. Since, our analysis is not indicating\nthe stellar enhancement below 16.5 mag of I band, therefore the cluster is\nassumed to be a group of fainter stars. The proposed magnitude scatter factor\nwould be an excellent tool to understand the characteristic of\ncolour-scattering of stars. The most probable members do not coincide with the\nmodel isochronic fitting in the optical bands due to poor data quality of P P\nMXL catalogue. The different values of the mean proper motions are found for\nthe fainter stars of the cluster and field regions, whereas similar values are\nobtained for radial zones of the cluster. The symmetrical distribution of\nfainter stars of the core are found around the best solution of isochrone. The\nmass function and mass segregation studies are not possible due to higher\nuncertainty of the photometric data. The number of the massive stars of the\ncluster region is low in comparison with the field region due to completed\nevolution life of the massive stars.\n", "  The soft-wall model, emerging as bottom-up holographic scenario anchored in\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence, displays the disappearance of normalisable modes\nreferring to vector mesons at a temperature $T_{\\dis}$ depending on the\nchemical potential $\\mu$, $T_{\\dis}(\\mu)$. We explore options for making\n$T_{\\dis}(\\mu)$ consistent with the freeze-out curve $T_{\\rm f.o.}(\\mu)$ from\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions and the cross-over curve $T_{\\rm c}(\\mu)$\nfrom QCD at small values of $\\mu$.\n", "  The local environment is ideal for searching out compact dark structures via\nthe microlensing and multi-frequency emissions as these objects are expected to\nbe faint and microlensing experiments have already hinted at their possibility.\nIn the case that these objects are composed of Dark Matter (DM) then there are\nboth few limits on their abundance but many consequences of their existence or\nnon-existence on both local and cosmic scales. In this work we examine the\npossibility of Ultra-Compact Mini-Halos (UCMHs) formed in the early universe.\nThese objects can persist to the present epoch due to their large central\ndensity inuring them to the worst effects of later tidal stripping. As such,\nthese objects could constitute probes of many details of early universe\nphysics, such as primordial phase-transitions, inflation, small scale\nexploration of the primordial density perturbation field and non-Gaussianity of\nthese density perturbations. The fact that they are also highly dark\nmatter-dominated objects means that they are attractive objects of study in the\ncontinuing hunt for the nature of Dark Matter (DM) through indirect detection.\nAnother reason to study such objects in the local environment is found in the\nconjecture that encounters with UCMHs could induce catastrophic events on\nplanets within our solar system, e.g. mass-extinction events on Earth. We will\noutline a strategy for multi-frequency UCMH searches within the region of the\nMilky-Way in which Gaia can accurately reconstruct microlens masses. This\nmethodology ensures that any candidate UCMH DM emission should correlate to\nsome unidentified microlensing object with determinable mass and demonstrate\nthat large-scale volcanic extinctions on Earth due to UCMHs are unlikely but\nthat it is possible for loss of the Martian geodynamo to be driven encounters\nwith such compact objects.\n", "  In this work, we present a subdomain discontinuous least-squares (SDLS)\nscheme for neutronics problems. Least-squares (LS) methods are known to be\ninaccurate for problems with sharp total-cross section interfaces. In addition,\nthe least-squares scheme is known not to be globally conservative in\nheterogeneous problems. In problems where global conservation is important,\ne.g. k-eigenvalue problems, conservative treatment must be applied. We, in this\nstudy, proposed a SDLS method that retains global conservation. Such a method\nresembles the LS formulation in each subdomain without material interface and\ndiffers from LS in that an additional least-squares interface term appears for\neach interface. Scalar flux is continuous in each subdomain with continuous\nfinite element method (CFEM) while discontinuous on interfaces for every pair\nof contiguous subdomains. SDLS numerical results are compared with those\nobtained from other numerical methods with test problems having material\ninterfaces. High accuracy of scalar flux in fixed-source problems and\n$k_\\mathrm{eff}$ in eigenvalue problems are demonstrated.\n", "  In this paper, we theoretically propose an optomechanical scheme to explore\nthe possibility of simulating the propagation of the collective excitations of\nthe photon fluid in a curved spacetime. For this purpose, we introduce two\ntheoretical models for two-dimensional photon gas in a planar optomechanical\nmicrocavity and a two-dimensional array of coupled optomechanical systems. In\nthe reversed dissipation regime (RDR) of cavity optomechanics where the\nmechanical oscillator reaches equilibrium with its thermal reservoir much\nfaster than the cavity modes, the mechanical degrees of freedom can\nadiabatically be eliminated. The adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode\nprovides an effective nonlinear Kerr-type photon-photon interaction. Using the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE), we show that the phase fluctuations\nin the two-dimensional photon fluid obey the Klein-Gordon equation for a\nmassless scalar field propagating in a curved spacetime. The results reveal\nthat the photon fluid as well as the corresponding metric can be controlled by\nmanipulating the system parameters.\n", "  We use the correspondence between three-dimensional asymptotically flat\nspacetimes and two-dimensional contracted conformal field theories (CCFTs) to\nderive the stress tensor correlators of CCFT$_2$. On the gravity side we use\nthe metric formulation instead of the Chern-Simons formulation of\nthree-dimensional gravity. This method can also be used for four-dimensional\ncase where there is no Chern-Simons formulation for the bulk theory.\n", "  Starting from an idea of S.L. Adler~\\cite{Adler2015}, we develop a novel\nmodel of gravity-induced spontaneous wave-function collapse. The collapse is\ndriven by complex stochastic fluctuations of the spacetime metric. After\nderiving the fundamental equations, we prove the collapse and amplification\nmechanism, the two most important features of a consistent collapse model.\nUnder reasonable simplifying assumptions, we constrain the strength $\\xi$ of\nthe complex metric fluctuations with available experimental data. We show that\n$\\xi\\geq 10^{-26}$ in order for the model to guarantee classicality of\nmacro-objects, and at the same time $\\xi \\leq 10^{-20}$ in order not to\ncontradict experimental evidence. As a comparison, in the recent discovery of\ngravitational waves in the frequency range 35 to 250 Hz, the (real) metric\nfluctuations reach a peak of $\\xi \\sim 10^{-21}$.\n", "  We discuss the algebraic quantization of a real, massive scalar field in the\nPoincar\\'e patch of the (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, with\narbitrary boundary conditions. By using the functional formalism, we show that\nit is always possible to associate to such system an algebra of observables\nenjoying the standard properties of causality, time-slice axiom and F-locality.\nIn addition, we characterize the wavefront set of the ground state associated\nto the system under investigation. As a consequence, we are able to generalize\nthe definition of Hadamard states and construct a global algebra of Wick\npolynomials.\n", "  Recently (Science, 355, 6320, 2017, 49-52) it was argued that density\nfunctionals stray from the path towards exactness due to errors in densities\n(\\rho) of 14 atoms and ions computed with several recent functionals. However,\nthis conclusion rests on very compact \\rho\\ of highly charged 1s2 and 1s22s2\nsystems, the divergence is due to one particular group's recently developed\nfunctionals, whereas other recent functionals perform well, and errors in \\rho\\\nwere not compared to actual energies E[\\rho] of the same distinct, compact\nsystems, but to general errors for diverse systems. As argued here, a true path\ncan only be defined for E[\\rho] and \\rho\\ for the same systems: By computing\nerrors in E[\\rho], it is shown that different functionals show remarkably\nlinear error relationships between \\rho\\ and E[\\rho] on well-defined but\ndifferent paths towards exactness, and the ranking in Science, 355, 6320, 2017,\n49-52 breaks down. For example, M06-2X, said to perform poorly, performs very\nwell on the E,\\rho\\ paths defined here, and local (non-GGA) functionals rapidly\nincrease errors in E[\\rho] due to the failure to describe dynamic correlation\nof compact systems without the gradient. Finally, a measure of \"exactness\" is\ngiven by the product of errors in E[\\rho] and \\rho; these relationships may be\nmore relevant focus points than a time line if one wants to estimate exactness\nand develop new exact functionals.\n", "  The coalescence of compact objects is one of the most promising sources of\ngravitational waves for ground-based interferometric detectors, such as\nadvanced LIGO and Virgo. Generically, com- pact objects in binaries are\nexpected to be spinning with spin angular momenta misaligned with the orbital\nangular momentum, causing the orbital plane to precess. This precession adds\nrich structure to the gravitational waves, introducing such complexity that an\nanalytic closed-form description has been unavailable until now. We here\nconstruct the first closed-form frequency- domain gravitational waveforms that\nare valid for generic spin-precessing quasicircular compact binary inspirals.\nWe first construct time-domain gravitational waves by solving the\npost-Newtonian precession equations of motion with radiation reaction through\nmultiple scale analysis. We then Fourier transform these time-domain waveforms\nwith the method of shifted uniform asymptotics to obtain closed-form\nexpressions for frequency-domain waveforms. We study the accuracy of these\nanalytic, frequency-domain waveforms relative to waveforms obtained by\nnumerically evolving the post-Newtonian equations of motion and find that they\nare suitable for unbiased parameter estimation for 99.2%(94.6%) of the binary\nconfigurations we studied at a signal-to-noise ratio of 10(25). These new\nfrequency-domain waveforms could be used for detection and parameter estimation\nstudies due to their accuracy and low computational cost.\n", "  A new method is proposed to reconstruct the neutrinos in the $e^+e^-\\to Zh$\nprocess followed by the $h\\to\\tau\\tau$ decay. With the help of a refined Higgs\nmomentum reconstruction from the recoiling system and the impact parameters,\nhigh precision in the determination of the momentum of neutrinos can be\nachieved. The prospect of measuring the Higgs CP mixing angle with the\n$h\\to\\tau\\tau$ decay at future $e^+e^-$ colliders is studied with the new\nmethod. The analysis is based on a detailed detector simulation of the signal\nand backgrounds. The fully reconstructed neutrinos and also other visible\nproducts from the tau decay are used to build matrix element (ME) based CP\nobservables. With 5 $ab^{-1}$ of data at $E_{\\text{CM}}=250$ GeV, a precision\nof $2.9^\\circ$ can be achieved for the CP mixing angle with three main\none-prong decay modes of the taus. The precision is found to be about 35\\%\nbetter than the other methods.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of constructing exponentially localized\ncomposite Wannier bases, or equivalently smooth periodic Bloch frames, for\n3-dimensional time-reversal symmetric topological insulators, both of bosonic\nand of fermionic type, so that the bases in question are also compatible with\ntime-reversal symmetry. This problem is translated in the study, of independent\ninterest, of homotopy classes of continuous, periodic, and time-reversal\nsymmetric families of unitary matrices. We identify three $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued\ncomplete invariants for these homotopy classes. When these invariants vanish,\nwe provide an algorithm which constructs a \"multi-step\" logarithm that is\nemployed to continuously deform the given family into a constant one,\nidentically equal to the identity matrix. This algorithm leads to a\nconstructive procedure to produce the composite Wannier bases mentioned above.\n", "  Nowadays projective quantum states can be constructed for a number of field\ntheories including Loop Quantum Gravity. However, these states are kinematic in\nthis sense that their construction does not take into account the dynamics of\nthe theories. In particular, the construction neglects constraints on phase\nspaces. Here we present projective quantum states for a \"toy-theory\" called\ndegenerate Plebanski gravity which satisfy a constraint of this theory.\n", "  Fifty years ago Walter Kohn speculated that a zero-gap semiconductor might be\nunstable against the spontaneous generation of excitons---electron-hole pairs\nbound together by Coulomb attraction. The reconstructed ground state would then\nopen a gap breaking the symmetry of the underlying lattice, a genuine\nconsequence of electronic correlations. Here we show that this excitonic\ninsulator is realized in zero-gap carbon nanotubes by performing\nfirst-principles calculations through many-body perturbation theory as well as\nquantum Monte Carlo. The excitonic order modulates the charge between the two\ncarbon sublattices opening an experimentally observable gap, which scales as\nthe inverse of the tube radius and weakly depends on the axial magnetic field.\nOur findings call into question the Luttinger liquid paradigm for nanotubes and\nprovide tests to experimentally discriminate between excitonic and Mott\ninsulator.\n", "  The low-frequency vibrational and low-temperature thermal properties of\namorphous solids are markedly different from those of crystalline solids. This\nsituation is counter-intuitive because any solid material is expected to behave\nas a homogeneous elastic body in the continuum limit, in which vibrational\nmodes are phonons following the Debye law. A number of phenomenological\nexplanations have been proposed, which assume elastic heterogeneities, soft\nlocalized vibrations, and so on. Recently, the microscopic mean-field theories\nhave been developed to predict the universal non-Debye scaling law. Considering\nthese theoretical arguments, it is absolutely necessary to directly observe the\nnature of the low-frequency vibrations of amorphous solids and determine the\nlaws that such vibrations obey. Here, we perform an extremely large-scale\nvibrational mode analysis of a model amorphous solid. We find that the scaling\nlaw predicted by the mean-field theory is violated at low frequency, and in the\ncontinuum limit, the vibrational modes converge to a mixture of phonon modes\nfollowing the Debye law and soft localized modes following another universal\nnon-Debye scaling law.\n", "  As is well known, dark matter direct detection experiments will ultimately be\nlimited by a \"neutrino floor,\" due to the scattering of nuclei by MeV neutrinos\nfrom, e.g., nuclear fusion in the Sun. Here we point out the existence of a new\n\"neutrino floor\" that will similarly limit indirect detection with the Sun, due\nto high-energy neutrinos from cosmic-ray interactions with the solar\natmosphere. We have two key findings. First, solar atmospheric neutrinos\n$\\lesssim 1$ TeV cause a sensitivity floor for standard WIMP scenarios, for\nwhich higher-energy neutrinos are absorbed in the Sun. This floor will be\nreached once the present sensitivity is improved by just one order of\nmagnitude. Second, for neutrinos $\\gtrsim 1$ TeV, which can be isolated by muon\nenergy loss rate, solar atmospheric neutrinos should soon be detectable in\nIceCube. Discovery will help probe the complicated effects of solar magnetic\nfields on cosmic rays. These events will be backgrounds to WIMP scenarios with\nlong-lived mediators, for which higher-energy neutrinos can escape from the\nSun.\n", "  Careful tailoring the quantum state of probes offers the capability of\ninvestigating matter at unprecedented precisions. Rarely, however, the\ninteraction with the sample is fully encompassed by a single parameter, and the\ninformation contained in the probe needs to be partitioned on multiple\nparameters. There exist then practical bounds on the ultimate joint-estimation\nprecision set by the unavailability of a single optimal measurement for all\nparameters. Here we discuss how these considerations are modified for two-level\nquantum probes - qubits - by the use of two copies and entangling measurements.\nWe find that the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion benefits from\nsuch collective measurement, while for multiple phases, no enhancement can be\nobserved. We demonstrate this in a proof-of-principle photonics setup.\n", "  Scientific collaborations shape ideas as well as innovations and are both the\nsubstrate for, and the outcome of, academic careers. Recent studies show that\ngender inequality is still present in many scientific practices ranging from\nhiring to peer-review processes and grant applications. In this work, we\ninvestigate gender-specific differences in collaboration patterns of more than\none million computer scientists over the course of 47 years. We explore how\nthese patterns change over years and career ages and how they impact scientific\nsuccess. Our results highlight that successful male and female scientists\nreveal the same collaboration patterns: compared to scientists in the same\ncareer age, they tend to collaborate with more colleagues than other\nscientists, seek innovations as brokers and establish longer-lasting and more\nrepetitive collaborations. However, women are on average less likely to adapt\nthe collaboration patterns that are related with success, more likely to embed\ninto ego networks devoid of structural holes, and they exhibit stronger gender\nhomophily as well as a consistently higher dropout rate than men in all career\nages.\n", "  Finding a fluorescent target in a biological environment is a common and\npressing microscopy problem. This task is formally analogous to the canonical\nsearch problem. In ideal (noise-free, truthful) search problems, the well-known\nbinary search is optimal. The case of half-lies, where one of two responses to\na search query may be deceptive, introduces a richer, R\\'enyi-Ulam problem and\nis particularly relevant to practical microscopy. We analyse microscopy in the\ncontexts of R\\'enyi-Ulam games and half-lies, developing a new family of\nheuristics. We show the cost of insisting on verification by positive result in\nsearch algorithms; for the zero-half-lie case bisectioning with verification\nincurs a 50% penalty in the average number of queries required. The optimal\npartitioning of search spaces directly following verification in the presence\nof random half-lies is determined. Trisectioning with verification is shown to\nbe the most efficient heuristic of the family in a majority of cases.\n", "  We study optical counterparts of a new-born pulsar in a double neutron star\nsystem like PSR J0737-3039A/B. This system is believed to eject a small amount\nof mass of $\\mathcal{O}(0.1M_{\\odot})$ at the second core-collapse supernova.\nWe argue that the initial spin of the new-born pulsar can be determined by the\norbital period at the time when the second supernova occurs. The spin angular\nmomentum of the progenitor is expected to be similar to that of the He-burning\ncore, which is tidally synchronized with the orbital motion, and then the\nsecond remnant may be born as a millisecond pulsar. If the dipole magnetic\nfield strength of the nascent pulsar is comparable to that inferred from the\ncurrent spin-down rate of PSR J0737-3039B, the initial spin-down luminosity is\ncomparable to the luminosity of super-luminous supernovae. We consider thermal\nemission arising from the supernova ejecta driven by the relativistic wind from\nsuch a new-born pulsar. The resulting optical light curves have a rising time\n$\\sim 10$ days and peak luminosity $\\sim 10^{44}$ erg/s. The optical emission\nmay last for a month to several months, due to the reprocessing of X-rays and\nUV photons via photoelectric absorption. These features are broadly consistent\nwith those of the rapidly-rising optical transients. The high spin-down\nluminosity and small ejecta mass are favorable for the progenitor of the\nrepeating fast radio burst, FRB 121102. We discuss a possible connection\nbetween newborn double pulsars and fast radio bursts.\n", "  Dark Matter (DM) remains a vital, but elusive, component in our current\nunderstanding of the universe. Accordingly, many experimental searches are\ndevoted to uncovering its nature. However, both the existing direct detection\nmethods, and the prominent $\\gamma$-ray search with the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (Fermi-LAT), are most sensitive to DM particles with masses below 1\nTeV, and are significantly less sensitive to the hard spectra produced in\nannihilation via heavy leptons. The High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) has\nhad some success in improving on the Fermi-LAT search for higher mass DM\nparticles, particularly annihilating via heavy lepton states. However, the\nrecent discovery of high J-factor dwarf spheroidal galaxies by the Dark Energy\nSurvey (DES) opens up the possibility of investing more HESS observation time\nin the search for DM $\\gamma$-ray signatures in dwarf galaxies. This work\nexplores the potential of HESS to extend its current limits using these new\ntargets, as well as the future constraints derivable with the up-coming\nCherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). These limits are further compared with those\nwe derived at low radio frequencies for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).\nFinally, we explore the impact of HESS, CTA, and Fermi-LAT on the phenomenology\nof the \"Madala\" boson hypothesized based on anomalies in the data from the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) run 1. The power of these limits from differing\nfrequency bands is suggestive of a highly effective multi-frequency DM hunt\nstrategy making use of both existing and up-coming Southern African telescopes.\n", "  The recent Madala hypothesis, a conjecture that seeks to explain anomalies\nwithin Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data (particularly in the transverse\nmomentum of the Higgs boson), is interesting for more than just a statistical\nhint at unknown and unpredicted physics. This is because the model itself\ncontains additional new particles that may serve as Dark Matter (DM)\ncandidates. These particles interact with the Standard Model via a scalar\nmediator boson $S$. More interesting still, the conjectured mass range for the\nDM candidate ($65$ - $100$ GeV) lies within the region of models viable to try\nexplain the recent Galactic Centre (GC) gamma-ray excess seen by Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS).\nTherefore, assuming $S$ decays promptly, it should be possible to check what\nconstraints are imposed upon the effective DM annihilation cross-section in the\nMadala scenario by hunting signatures of $S$ decay that follows DM annihilation\nwithin dense astrophysical structures. In order to make use of existing data,\nwe use the Reticulum II dwarf galaxy and the galactic centre gamma-ray excess\ndata sets from Fermi-LAT, and compare these to the consequences of various\ndecay paths for $S$ in the aforementioned environments. We find that, based on\nthis existing data, we can limit $\\tau$ lepton, quark, direct gamma-ray, and\nweak boson channels to levels below the canonical relic cross-section. This\nallows us to set new limits on the branching ratios of $S$ decay, which can\nrule out a Higgs-like decay branching for $S$, in the case where the Madala DM\ncandidate is assumed to comprise all DM.\n", "  We introduce a biparametric Fisher-R\\'enyi complexity measure for general\nprobability distributions and we discuss its properties. This notion, which is\ncomposed of two entropy-like components (the R\\'enyi entropy and the\nbiparametric Fisher information), generalizes the basic Fisher-Shannon measure\nand the previous complexity quantifiers of Fisher-R\\'enyi type. Then, we\nillustrate the usefulness of this notion by carrying out a\ninformation-theoretical analysis of the spectral energy density of a\n$d$-dimensional blackbody at temperature $T$. It is shown that the biparametric\nFisher-R\\'enyi measure of this quantum system has a universal character in the\nsense that it does not depend on temperature nor on any physical constant\n(e.g., Planck constant, speed of light, Boltzmann constant), but only on the\nspace dimensionality $d$. Moreover, it decreases when $d$ is increasing, but\nexhibits a non trivial behavior for a fixed $d$ and a varying parameter, which\nsomehow brings up a non standard structure of the blackbody $d$-dimensional\ndensity distribution.\n", "  We investigate the single qubit transformations under several typical\ncoherence-free operations, such as, incoherent operation (IO), strictly\nincoherent operation (SIO), physically incoherent operation (PIO), and\ncoherence preserving operation (CPO). Quantitative connection has been built\nbetween IO and SIO in single qubit systems. Moreover, these coherence-free\noperations have a clear hierarchical relationship in single qubit systems: CPO\n$\\subset$ PIO $\\subset$ SIO=IO. A new and explicit proof for the necessary and\nsufficient condition of single qubit transformation via IO or SIO has been\nprovided, which indicates that SIO with only two Kraus operators are enough to\nrealize this transformation. The transformation regions of single qubits via\nCPO and PIO are also given. Our method provides a geometric illustration to\nanalyze single qubit coherence transformations by introducing the Bloch sphere\ndepiction of the transformation regions, and tells us how to construct the\ncorresponding coherence-free operations.\n", "  We present an experimental study of seeded four-wave mixing (4WM) using a\ndiamond excitation scheme (with states from the 5S$_{1/2}$, 5P$_{1/2}$,\n5P$_{3/2}$ and 5D$_{3/2}$ terms) in a thermal vapour of $^{87}$Rb atoms. We\ninvestigate the 4WM spectra under the application of a strong magnetic field\n(0.6 T). The Zeeman interaction is strong enough to realise the hyperfine\nPaschen-Back regime, which has the effect of separating the optical transitions\nby more than the Doppler width, thereby significantly simplifying the spectral\nfeatures. We show that this facilitates a quantitative comparison, even in the\nregime of strong dressing, between experimental data and a simple theoretical\nmodel based only on four-level optical Bloch equations.\n", "  We calculate the high energy photon production from the Pb+Pb collisions for\ndifferent centrality classes at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) energy. The jet energy loss in the jet fragmentation, jet-photon\nconversion and jet bremsstrahlung is considered by using the\nWang-Huang-Sarcevic (WHS) and Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff (BDMPS)\nmodels. We use the (1+1)-dimensional ideal relativistic hydrodynamics to study\nthe collective transverse flow and space-time evolution of the quark gluon\nplasma (QGP). The numerical results agree well with the ALICE data of the\ndirect photons from the Pb+Pb collisions ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV) for 0-20\\%,\n20-40\\% and 40-80\\% centrality classes.\n", "  In this work we present for the first time predictions for top-quark pair\ndifferential distributions at the LHC at NNLO QCD accuracy and including EW\ncorrections. For the latter we include not only contributions of ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha_s^2 \\alpha)$, but also those of order ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s \\alpha^2)$\nand ${\\cal O}( \\alpha^3)$. Besides providing phenomenological predictions for\nall main differential distributions with stable top quarks, we also study the\nfollowing issues. 1) The effect of the photon PDF on top-pair spectra: we find\nit to be strongly dependent on the PDF set used -- especially for the top $p_T$\ndistribution. 2) The difference between the additive and multiplicative\napproaches for combining QCD and EW corrections: with our scale choice, we find\nrelatively small differences between the central predictions, but reduced scale\ndependence within the multiplicative approach. 3) The potential effect from the\nradiation of heavy bosons on inclusive top-pair spectra: we find it to be,\ntypically, negligible.\n", "  Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ remains a puzzling case among the extensively studied\nfrustrated compounds of the rare-earth pyrochlore family. Indeed, while a first\norder transition towards a long-range antiferromagnetic state with the\nso-called Palmer-Chalker structure is theoretically predicted, it has not been\nobserved yet, leaving the issue, as to whether it is a spin-liquid candidate,\nopen. We report on neutron scattering and magnetization measurements which\nevidence a second order transition towards this Palmer-Chalker ordered state\naround 108 mK. Extreme care was taken to ensure a proper thermalization of the\nsample, which has proved to be crucial to successfully observe the magnetic\nBragg peaks. At the transition, a gap opens in the excitations, superimposed on\na strong quasielastic signal. The exchange parameters, refined from a spin wave\nanalysis in applied magnetic field, confirm that Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ is a\nrealization of the dipolar XY pyrochlore antiferromagnet. The proximity of\ncompeting phases and the strong XY anisotropy of the Er$^{3+}$ magnetic moment\nmight be at the origin of enhanced fluctuations, leading to the unexpected\nnature of the transition, the low ordering temperature, and the observed\nmulti-scale dynamics.\n", "  Phosphorene is a bidimensional material that has properties useful for\nsemiconductor devices. In this work we studied the electronic and optical\nproperties of this material using the $GW$ approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation (BSE) methods. We stress the importance of a careful convergence study\nof the most relevant parameters, and we show how they affect the result of the\ncalculations. A comparison with previous results is given. The QP band gap\nobtained was 2.06 eV and it is in good agreement with experimental results. BSE\ncalculations were performed on top of $G_0W_0$ to include excitonic effects.\nThe absorption spectrum was analysed and an optical gap of 1.22 eV was\nobtained. The calculated excitonic binding energy is 0.84 eV, also in good\nagreement with experimental results.\n", "  We show via tensor network methods that the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian for\nhard-core bosons on a square geometry supports a topological phase realizing\nthe $\\nu=1/2$ fractional quantum Hall effect on the lattice. We address the\nrobustness of the ground state degeneracy and of the energy gap, measure the\nmany-body Chern number, and characterize the system using Green functions,\nshowing that they decay algebraically at the edges of open geometries,\nindicating the presence of gapless edge modes. Moreover, we estimate the\ntopological entanglement entropy by taking a combination of lattice\nbipartitions that reproduces the topological structure of the original\nproposals by Kitaev and Preskill, and Levin and Wen. The numerical results show\nthat the topological contribution is compatible with the expected value $\\gamma\n= 1/2$. Our results provide extensive evidence that FQH states are within reach\nof state-of-the-art cold atom experiments.\n", "  We show that the energy-transport efficiency in a chain of two-level emitters\ncan be drastically enhanced by the presence of a photonic topological insulator\n(PTI). This is obtained by exploiting the peculiar properties of its\nnonreciprocal surface plasmon polariton (SPP), which is unidirectional, and\nimmune to backscattering, and propagates in the bulk band gap. This\namplification of transport efficiency can be as much as 2 orders of magnitude\nwith respect to reciprocal SPPs. Moreover, we demonstrate that despite the\npresence of considerable imperfections at the interface of the PTI, the\nefficiency of the SPP-assisted energy transport is almost unaffected by\ndiscontinuities. We also show that the SPP properties allow energy transport\nover considerably much larger distances than in the reciprocal case, and we\npoint out a particularly simple way to tune the transport. Finally, we analyze\nthe specific case of a two-emitter chain and unveil the origin of the\nefficiency amplification. The efficiency amplification and the practical\nadvantages highlighted in this work might be particularly useful in the\ndevelopment of new devices intended to manage energy at the atomic scale.\n", "  The paper is concerned with the number of open gaps in spectra of periodic\nquantum graphs. The well-known conjecture by Bethe and Sommerfeld (1933) says\nthat the number of open spectral gaps for a system periodic in more than one\ndirection is finite. To the date its validity is established for numerous\nsystems, however, it is known that quantum graphs do not comply with this law\nas their spectra have typically infinitely many gaps, or no gaps at all. These\nfacts gave rise to the question about the existence of quantum graphs with the\n`Bethe-Sommerfeld property', that is, featuring a nonzero finite number of gaps\nin the spectrum. In this paper we prove that the said property is impossible\nfor graphs with the vertex couplings which are either scale-invariant or\nassociated to scale-invariant ones in a particular way. On the other hand, we\ndemonstrate that quantum graphs with a finite number of open gaps do indeed\nexist. We illustrate this phenomenon on an example of a rectangular lattice\nwith a $\\delta$ coupling at the vertices and a suitable irrational ratio of the\nedges. Our result allows to find explicitly a quantum graph with any prescribed\nexact number of gaps, which is the first such example to the date.\n", "  Thermalized elastic membranes without distant self-avoidance are believed to\nundergo a crumpling transition when the microscopic bending stiffness is\ncomparable to $kT$, the scale of thermal fluctuations. Most potential physical\nrealizations of such membranes have a bending stiffness well in excess of\nexperimentally achievable temperatures and are therefore unlikely ever to\naccess the crumpling regime. We propose a mechanism to tune the onset of the\ncrumpling transition by altering the geometry and topology of the sheet itself.\nWe carry out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of perforated sheets with\na dense periodic array of holes and observe that the critical temperature is\ncontrolled by the total fraction of removed area, independent of the precise\narrangement and size of the individual holes. The critical exponents for the\nperforated membrane are compatible with those of the standard crumpling\ntransition.\n", "  Recent discovery of pyrite FeO$_2$, which can be an important ingredient of\nthe Earth's lower mantle and which in particular may serve as an extra source\nof water in the Earth's interior, opens new perspectives for geophysics and\ngeochemistry, but this is also an extremely interesting material from physical\npoint of view. We found that in contrast to naive expectations Fe is nearly 3+\nin this material, which strongly affects its magnetic properties and makes it\nqualitatively different from well known sulfide analogue - FeS$_2$. Doping,\nwhich is most likely to occur in the Earth's mantle, makes FeO$_2$ much more\nmagnetic. In addition we show that unique electronic structure places FeO$_2$\n\"in between\" the usual dioxides and peroxides making this system interesting\nboth for physics and solid state chemistry.\n", "  We study the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons within jets, where\nthe transverse momentum is defined with respect to the standard jet axis. We\nconsider the case where the jet substructure measurement is performed for an\ninclusive jet sample $pp\\to\\text{jet}+X$. We demonstrate that this observable\nprovides new opportunities to study transverse momentum dependent fragmentation\nfunctions (TMDFFs) which are currently poorly constrained from data, especially\nfor gluons. The factorization of the cross section is obtained within Soft\nCollinear Effective Theory (SCET), and we show that the relevant TMDFFs are the\nsame as for the more traditional processes semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nscattering (SIDIS) and electron-positron annihilation. Different than in SIDIS,\nthe observable for the in-jet fragmentation does not depend on TMD parton\ndistribution functions which allows for a cleaner and more direct probe of\nTMDFFs. We present numerical results and compare to available data from the\nLHC.\n", "  The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI), derived under the assumption of realism,\nacts as the temporal Bell's inequality. It is studied in electromagnetic and\nstrong interaction like photonics, superconducting qu-bits and nuclear spin.\nUntil the weak interaction two-state oscillations of neutrinos affirmed the\nviolation of Leggett-Garg-type inequalities (LGtI). We make an empirical test\nfor the deviation of experimental results with the classical limits by\nanalyzing the survival probability data of reactor neutrinos at a distinct\nrange of baseline dividing energies, as an analog to a single neutrino detected\nat different time. A study of the updated data of Daya-Bay experiment\nunambiguously depicts an obvious cluster of data over the classical bound of\nLGtI and shows a $6.1\\sigma$ significance of the violation of them.\n", "  We investigate of the relationship between the entanglement and subsystem\nHamiltonians in the perturbative regime of strong coupling between subsystems.\nOne of the two conditions that guarantees the proportionality between these\nHamiltonians obtained by using the nondegenerate perturbation theory within the\nfirst order is that the unperturbed ground state has a trivial entanglement\nHamiltonian. Furthermore, we study the entanglement Hamiltonian of the\nHeisenberg ladders in a time-dependent magnetic field using the degenerate\nperturbation theory, where couplings between legs are considered as a\nperturbation. In this case, when the ground state is two-fold degenerate, and\nthe entanglement Hamiltonian is proportional to the Hamiltonian of a chain\nwithin first-order perturbation theory, even then also the unperturbed ground\nstate has a nontrivial entanglement spectrum.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of inflationary models with a coupling of the\ninflaton $\\phi$ to gauge fields of the form $\\phi F \\tilde{F}/f$, as in the\ncase of axions. It is known that this leads to an instability, with exponential\namplification of gauge fields, controlled by the parameter $\\xi=\n\\dot{\\phi}/(2fH)$, which can strongly affect the generation of cosmological\nperturbations and even the background. We show that scattering rates involving\ngauge fields can become larger than the expansion rate $H$, due to the very\nlarge occupation numbers, and create a thermal bath of particles of temperature\n$T$ during inflation. In the thermal regime, energy is transferred to smaller\nscales, radically modifying the predictions of this scenario. We thus argue\nthat previous constraints on $\\xi$ are alleviated. If the gauge fields have\nStandard Model interactions, which naturally provides reheating, they\nthermalize already at $\\xi\\gtrsim2.9$, before perturbativity constraints and\nalso before backreaction takes place. In absence of SM interactions (i.e. for a\ndark photon), we find that gauge fields and inflaton perturbations thermalize\nif $\\xi\\gtrsim3.4$; however, observations require $\\xi\\gtrsim6$, which is above\nthe perturbativity and backreaction bounds and so a dedicated study is\nrequired. After thermalization, though, the system should evolve non-trivially\ndue to the competition between the instability and the gauge field thermal\nmass. If the thermal mass and the instabilities equilibrate, we expect an\nequilibrium temperature of $T_{eq} \\simeq \\xi H/\\bar{g}$ where $\\bar{g}$ is the\neffective gauge coupling. Finally, we estimate the spectrum of perturbations if\n$\\phi$ is thermal and find that the tensor to scalar ratio is suppressed by\n$H/(2T)$, if tensors do not thermalize.\n", "  The mutual intensity and its equivalent phase-space representations quantify\nan optical field's state of coherence and are important tools in the study of\nlight propagation and dynamics, but they can only be estimated indirectly from\nmeasurements through a process called coherence retrieval, otherwise known as\nphase-space tomography. As practical considerations often rule out the\navailability of a complete set of measurements, coherence retrieval is usually\na challenging high-dimensional ill-posed inverse problem. In this paper, we\npropose a trace-regularized optimization model for coherence retrieval and a\nprovably-convergent adaptive accelerated proximal gradient algorithm for\nsolving the resulting problem. Applying our model and algorithm to both\nsimulated and experimental data, we demonstrate an improvement in\nreconstruction quality over previous models as well as an increase in\nconvergence speed compared to existing first-order methods.\n", "  In this work, we consider the so-called $\\Lambda(\\alpha)$CDM cosmology with\n$\\Lambda\\propto\\alpha^{-6}$ while the fine-structure \"constant\" $\\alpha$ is\nvarying. In this scenario, the accelerated expansion of the universe is driven\nby the cosmological \"constant\" $\\Lambda$ (equivalently the vacuum energy), and\nthe varying $\\alpha$ is driven by a subdominant scalar field $\\phi$ coupling\nwith the electromagnetic field. The observational constraints on the varying\n$\\alpha$ and $\\Lambda\\propto\\alpha^{-6}$ models with various couplings\n$B_F(\\phi)$ between the subdominant scalar field $\\phi$ and the electromagnetic\nfield are considered.\n", "  Marginally stable solids have peculiar physical properties that were\ndiscovered and analyzed in the context of the jamming transition. We\ntheoretically investigate the existence of marginal stability in a prototypical\nmodel for structural glass-formers, combining analytical calculations in\ninfinite dimensions to computer simulations in three dimensions. While\nmean-field theory predicts the existence of a Gardner phase transition towards\na marginally stable glass phase at low temperatures, simulations show no hint\nof diverging timescales or lengthscales, but reveal instead the presence of\nsparse localized defects. Our results suggest that the Gardner transition is\ndeeply affected by finite dimensional fluctuations, and raise issues about the\nrelevance of marginal stability in structural glasses far away from jamming.\n", "  We study the phenomenological credibility of a vectorial dark matter, coupled\nto a $Z'$ portal through Chern-Simons interaction. We scrutinize two\npossibilities of connecting a $Z'$ with the Standard Model: (1) through kinetic\nmixing and (2) from a second Chern-Simons interaction. Both scenarios are\ncharacterized by suppressed nuclear recoil scatterings, rendering direct\ndetection searches not promising. Indirect detection experiments, on the other\nhand, furnish complementary limits for TeV scale masses, specially with the\nCTA. Searches for mono-jet and dileptons signals at the LHC are important to\npartially probe the kinetic mixing setup. Finally we propose an UV completion\nof the Chern-Simons Dark Matter framework.\n", "  We report results from the first search for sterile neutrinos mixing with\nactive neutrinos through a reduction in the rate of neutral-current\ninteractions over a baseline of 810\\,km between the NOvA detectors. Analyzing a\n14-kton detector equivalent exposure of 6.05$\\times$10$^{20}$ protons-on-target\nin the NuMI beam at Fermilab, we observe 95 neutral-current candidates at the\nFar Detector compared with $83.5 \\pm 9.7 \\mbox{(stat.)} \\pm 9.4 \\mbox{(syst.)}$\nevents predicted assuming mixing only occurs between active neutrino species.\nNo evidence for $\\nu_{\\mu} \\rightarrow \\nu_{s}$ transitions is found.\nInterpreting these results within a 3+1 model, we place constraints on the\nmixing angles $\\theta_{24}<20.8^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{34}<31.2^{\\circ}$ at the\n90% C.L. for $0.05~eV^2\\leq \\Delta m^2_{41}\\leq 0.5~eV^2$, the range of mass\nsplittings that produce no significant oscillations over the Near Detector\nbaseline.\n", "  Chaos and complexity entail an entropic and computational obstruction to\ndescribing a system, and thus are intrinsically difficult to characterize. In\nthis paper, we consider time evolution by Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE)\nHamiltonians and analytically compute out-of-time-ordered correlation functions\n(OTOCs) and frame potentials to quantify scrambling, Haar-randomness, and\ncircuit complexity. While our random matrix analysis gives a qualitatively\ncorrect prediction of the late-time behavior of chaotic systems, we find\nunphysical behavior at early times including an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ scrambling\ntime and the apparent breakdown of spatial and temporal locality. The salient\nfeature of GUE Hamiltonians which gives us computational traction is the\nHaar-invariance of the ensemble, meaning that the ensemble-averaged dynamics\nlook the same in any basis. Motivated by this property of the GUE, we introduce\n$k$-invariance as a precise definition of what it means for the dynamics of a\nquantum system to be described by random matrix theory. We envision that the\ndynamical onset of approximate $k$-invariance will be a useful tool for\ncapturing the transition from early-time chaos, as seen by OTOCs, to late-time\nchaos, as seen by random matrix theory.\n", "  The exactly solvable Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice has recently\nreceived enormous attention linked to the hope of achieving novel spin-liquid\nstates with fractionalized Majorana-like excitations. In this review, we\nanalyze the mechanism proposed by G. Jackeli and G. Khaliullin to identify\nKitaev materials based on spin-orbital dependent bond interactions and provide\na comprehensive overview of its implications in real materials. We set the\nfocus on experimental results and current theoretical understanding of planar\nhoneycomb systems (Na$_2$IrO$_3$, $\\alpha$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, and\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$), three-dimensional Kitaev materials ($\\beta$- and\n$\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$), and other potential candidates, completing the review\nwith the list of open questions awaiting new insights.\n", "  We study the impact of thermal inflation on the formation of cosmological\nstructures and present astrophysical observables which can be used to constrain\nand possibly probe the thermal inflation scenario. These are dark matter halo\nabundance at high redshifts, satellite galaxy abundance in the Milky Way, and\nfluctuation in the 21-cm radiation background before the epoch of reionization.\nThe thermal inflation scenario leaves a characteristic signature on the matter\npower spectrum by boosting the amplitude at a specific wavenumber determined by\nthe number of e-foldings during thermal inflation ($N_{\\rm bc}$), and strongly\nsuppressing the amplitude for modes at smaller scales. For a reasonable range\nof parameter space, one of the consequences is the suppression of minihalo\nformation at high redshifts and that of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way.\nWhile this effect is substantial, it is degenerate with other cosmological or\nastrophysical effects. The power spectrum of the 21-cm background probes this\nimpact more directly, and its observation may be the best way to constrain the\nthermal inflation scenario due to the characteristic signature in the power\nspectrum. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in phase 1 (SKA1) has sensitivity\nlarge enough to achieve this goal for models with $N_{\\rm bc}\\gtrsim 26$ if a\n10000-hr observation is performed. The final phase SKA, with anticipated\nsensitivity about an order of magnitude higher, seems more promising and will\ncover a wider parameter space.\n", "  In order to make results of computational scientific research findable,\naccessible, interoperable and re-usable, it is necessary to decorate them with\nstandardised metadata. However, there are a number of technical and practical\nchallenges that make this process difficult to achieve in practice. Here the\nimplementation of a protocol is presented to tag crystal structures with their\ncomputed properties, without the need of human intervention to curate the data.\nThis protocol leverages the capabilities of AiiDA, an open-source platform to\nmanage and automate scientific computational workflows, and TCOD, an\nopen-access database storing computed materials properties using a well-defined\nand exhaustive ontology. Based on these, the complete procedure to deposit\ncomputed data in the TCOD database is automated. All relevant metadata are\nextracted from the full provenance information that AiiDA tracks and stores\nautomatically while managing the calculations. Such a protocol also enables\nreproducibility of scientific data in the field of computational materials\nscience. As a proof of concept, the AiiDA-TCOD interface is used to deposit 170\ntheoretical structures together with their computed properties and their full\nprovenance graphs, consisting in over 4600 AiiDA nodes.\n", "  We study the properties of tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies in the\ncontext of a catalog of ~500,000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We\nexplore whether selection effects can account for the overrepresentation of\nTDEs in E+A/post-starburst galaxies by creating matched galaxy samples.\nAccounting for possible selection effects due to black hole (BH) mass, redshift\ncompleteness, strong AGN presence, bulge colors, and surface brightness can\nreduce the apparent overrepresentation of TDEs in E+A host galaxies by a factor\nof ~4 (from ~$\\times$100-190 to ~$\\times$25-48), but cannot fully explain the\npreference. We find that TDE host galaxies have atypical photometric properties\ncompared to similar, \"typical\" galaxies. In particular, TDE host galaxies tend\nto live in or near the \"green valley\" between star-forming and passive\ngalaxies, and have bluer bulge colors ($\\Delta (g-r) \\approx 0.3$ mag), lower\nhalf-light surface brightnesses (by ~1 mag/arcsec$^2$), higher Sersic indices\n($\\Delta n_{\\rm g} \\approx 3$), and higher bulge-to-total-light ratios ($\\Delta\nB/T \\approx 0.5$) than galaxies with matched BH masses. We find that TDE host\ngalaxies appear more centrally concentrated and that all have high galaxy\nSersic indices and $B/T$ fractions---on average in the top 10% of galaxies of\nthe same BH mass---suggesting a higher nuclear stellar density. We identify a\nregion in Sersic index and BH mass parameter space that contains ~2% of our\nreference catalog galaxies but $\\ge\\!60\\%$ of TDE host galaxies. The unique\nphotometric properties of TDE host galaxies may be useful for selecting\ncandidate TDEs for spectroscopic follow-up observations in large transient\nsurveys.\n", "  We show that the evolution of two-component particles governed by a\ntwo-dimensional spin-orbit lattice Hamiltonian can reveal transitions between\ntopological phases. A kink in the mean width of the particle distribution\nsignals the closing of the band gap, a prerequisite for a quantum phase\ntransition between topological phases. Furthermore, for realistic and\nexperimentally motivated Hamiltonians the density profile in topologically\nnon-trivial phases displays characteristic rings in the vicinity of the origin\nthat are absent in trivial phases. The results are expected to have immediate\napplication to systems of ultracold atoms and photonic lattices.\n", "  A search is conducted for new resonant and non-resonant high-mass phenomena\nin dielectron and dimuon final states. The search uses 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of\nproton-proton collision data, collected at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. No significant deviation from the\nStandard Model prediction is observed. Upper limits at 95% credibility level\nare set on the cross-section times branching ratio for resonances decaying into\ndileptons, which are converted to lower limits on the resonance mass, up to 4.1\nfor the E$_{6}$-motivated Z'$_{\\chi}$. Lower limits on the $qq \\ell\\ell$\ncontact interaction scale are set between 24 TeV and 40 TeV, depending on the\nmodel.\n", "  The exact suppression of backscattering from rotationally symmetric objects\nrequires dual symmetric materials where ${\\epsilon_r} = {\\mu_r}$. This prevents\ntheir design at many frequency bands, including the optical one, because\nmagnetic materials are not available. Electromagnetically small non-magnetic\nspheres of large permittivity offer an alternative. They can be tailored to\nexhibit balanced electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities, which result in\napproximate zero backscattering. In this case, the effect is inherently\nnarrowband. Here, we put forward a different alternative that allows broadband\nfunctionality: Electromagnetically large spheres made from low permittivity\nmaterials. The effect occurs in a parameter regime that approaches the trivial\n${\\epsilon_r} \\to {\\mu_r} =1$ case, where approximate duality is met in a\nweakly wavelength dependence fashion. Despite the low permittivity, the overall\nscattering response of the spheres is still significant. Radiation patterns\nfrom these spheres are shown to be highly directive across an octave spanning\nband. The effect is analytically and numerically shown using the Mie\ncoefficients.\n", "  The cubic double perovskites A2ZnWO6 (A = Ba, Sr and Ca) are studied to\nunderstand the effect of A cation site, using the density functional theory\n(DFT) based full potential augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW) with GGA and\nmBJ exchange correlation potentials. The structural robustness and stability\nare investigated using the bond lengths and the total energy. The band\nstructure and density of states suggest that all these cubic double perovskites\nare indirect wide band gap semiconductors. The band gap varies from 3.90 eV\n(2.97 eV) for Ba2ZnWO6 system to 3.40 eV (2.8 eV) for Ca2ZnWO6 system using mBJ\n(GGA) exchange correlation potentials. Our studies suggest that cation site\nmodification has a strong effect on physical and electronic properties, in\ncontrast to the structural robustness. The lattice parameter decreases from\n8.19 Angstrom to 7.9 Angstrom from Ba to Ca at alkali cation site and the\nelectronic band gap variation follows the common cation rule. The charge\ndensities show enhanced localization of charges near the zinc and oxygen sites\nwith increasing alkali cation atomic radii. In addition, we discuss the impact\nof A site cation modification on the dielectric and optical properties for\nA2ZnWO6 double perovskites.\n", "  We compare complex networks built from the game of go and obtained from\ndatabases of human-played games with those obtained from computer-played games.\nOur investigations show that statistical features of the human-based networks\nand the computer-based networks differ, and that these differences can be\nstatistically significant on a relatively small number of games using specific\nestimators. We show that the deterministic or stochastic nature of the computer\nalgorithm playing the game can also be distinguished from these quantities.\nThis can be seen as tool to implement a Turing-like test for go simulators.\n", "  In IV-VI semiconductor heterojunctions with band-inversion, such as those\nmade of Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Te or Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se, interface states are\nproperly described by a two-band model, predicting the appearance of a Dirac\ncone in single junctions. However, in quantum wells the interface dispersion is\nquadratic in momentum and the energy spectrum presents a gap. We show that the\ninterface gap shrinks under an electric field parallel to the growth direction.\nTherefore, the interface gap can be dynamically tuned in experiments on\ndouble-gated quantum wells based on band-inverted compounds.\n", "  Nonlinear Compton scattering (NCS) and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler (NBW) process\nare strongly multi-photon and highly nonlinear processes. In ultra intense\nlasers (normalized field amplitude $a_0 \\gg 1$), radiation formation length is\nmuch shorter than a period and single NCS/NBW cannot be described as\nscatterings of electrons dressing plane waves with $\\gamma$ photons for what\nthey feel is a local constant crossed field. However, present theories in\nconstant crossed fields are hard to give some important quantum features due to\ndivergence problems, such as number of laser photons involved, instantaneous\nangular distribution and detailed spectrum. As an alternative, present\nunderstanding of single NCS/NBW in ultra intense lasers includes several\nclassical and semi-quantum ideas such as forward emission, recoil reaction and\nspectrum cutoff. We investigated multi-photon effects on NCS/NBW in ultra\nintense lasers by extracting the number of laser photons involved in a single\nprocess in ultra intense lasers from formulae of existing theories. New\nfeatures of single NCS in ultra intense lasers including fixed emission angle\nto instantaneous electron momentum, instantaneous deflection of electron, and\ndisappearance of spectrum cutoff are deduced. Similar features of single NBW in\nultra intense lasers including non-vanishing emission angles to instantaneous\n$\\gamma$ photon momentum, disappearance of spectrum cutoff and appearance of\nspectrum lower limit are also obtained. Simulations show that corresponding\nsignals of multi-photon effects are significant on $10$PW scale and stronger\nlasers.\n", "  The transport of a steel sphere on top of two dimensional periodic magnetic\npatterns is studied experimentally. Transport of the sphere is achieved by\nmoving an external permanent magnet on a closed loop around the two dimensional\ncrystal. The transport is topological i.e. the steel sphere is transported by a\nprimitive unit vector of the lattice when the external magnet loop winds around\nspecific directions. We experimentally determine the set of directions the\nloops must enclose for nontrivial transport of the steel sphere into various\ndirections.\n", "  We discuss inflation and dark matter in the inert doublet model coupled\nnon-minimally to gravity where the inert doublet is the inflaton and the\nneutral scalar part of the doublet is the dark matter candidate. We calculate\nthe various inflationary parameters like $n_s$, $r$ and $P_s$ and then proceed\nto the reheating phase where the inflaton decays into the Higgs and other gauge\nbosons which are non-relativistic owing to high effective masses. These bosons\nfurther decay or annihilate to give relativistic fermions which are finally\nresponsible for reheating the universe. At the end of the reheating phase, the\ninert doublet which was the inflaton enters into thermal equilibrium with the\nrest of the plasma and its neutral component later freezes out as cold dark\nmatter with a mass of about 2 TeV.\n", "  The past twenty years have seen a resurgence of interest in nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics, thanks to advances in the theory of stochastic processes and in\ntheir thermodynamic interpretation. Fluctuation theorems provide fundamental\nconstraints on the dynamics of systems arbitrarily far from thermal\nequilibrium. Thermodynamic uncertainty relations bound the dissipative cost of\nprecision in a wide variety of processes. Concepts of excess work and excess\nheat provide the basis for a complete thermodynamics of nonequilibrium steady\nstates, including generalized Clausius relations and thermodynamic potentials.\nBut these general results carry their own limitations: fluctuation theorems\ninvolve exponential averages that can depend sensitively on unobservably rare\ntrajectories; steady-state thermodynamics makes use of a dual dynamics that\nlacks any direct physical interpretation. This review aims to present these\ncentral results of contemporary nonequilibrium thermodynamics in such a way\nthat the power of each claim for making physical predictions can be clearly\nassessed, using examples from current topics in soft matter and biophysics.\n", "  A rare decay $K_L \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^- $ has been measured precisely, while a rare\ndecay $K_S \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^- $ will be observed by an upgrade of the LHCb\nexperiment. Although both processes are almost CP-conserving decays, we point\nout that an interference contribution between $K_L$ and $K_S$ in the kaon beam\nemerges from a genuine direct CP violation. It is found that the interference\ncontribution can change $K_S \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ standard-model predictions at\n$\\mathcal{O}(60\\%)$. We also stress that an unknown sign of $\\mathcal{A}(K_L\n\\to \\gamma \\gamma)$ can be determined by a measurement of the interference,\nwhich can much reduce a theoretical uncertainty of $\\mathcal{B}(K_L \\to \\mu^+\n\\mu^-)$. We also investigate the interference in a new physics model, where the\n$\\epsilon'_K / \\epsilon_K$ tension is explained by an additional $Z$-penguin\ncontribution.\n", "  Results of a comprehensive shell model (SM) analyses, within the full\n$f_{5/2}pg_{9/2}$ model space, of the recently available experimental data [P.\nRuotsalainen et al., Phy. Rec. C {88}, 024320 (2013)] with four $T=0$ bands and\none $T=1$ band in the odd-odd $N=Z$ nucleus $^{66}$As are presented. The\ncalculations are performed using jj44b effective interaction developed recently\nby B.A. Brown and A.F. Lisetskiy for this model space. For the lowest two $T=0$\nbands and the $T=1$ band, the results are in reasonable agreement with\nexperimental data and deformed shell model is used to identify their intrinsic\nstructure. For the $T=1$ band, structural change at $8^+$ is predicted. For the\nthird $9^+$ band with $T=0$, the shell model $B(E2)$ values and quadrupole\nmoments (in addition to energies) are consistent with the interpretation in\nterms of aligned isoscalar $np$ pair in $g_{9/2}$ orbit coupled to the\n$^{64}$Ge ground band. Similarly, the $9^+$ level of band 4 and a close lying\n$5^+$ level are found to be isomeric states in the analysis. Finally, energies\nof the band 5 members calculated using shell model with both positive and\nnegative parity show that the observed levels are most likely negative parity\nlevels. The SM results with jj44b are also compared with the results obtained\nusing JUN45 interaction.\n", "  Periodic driving is used to operate machines that go from standard\nmacroscopic engines to small non-equilibrium micro-sized systems. Two classes\nof such systems are small heat engines driven by periodic temperature\nvariations and molecular pumps driven by external stimuli. Well known results\nthat are valid for nonequilibrium steady states of systems driven by fixed\nthermodynamic forces, instead of an external periodic driving, have been\ngeneralized to periodically driven heat engines only recently. These results\ninclude a general expression for entropy production in terms of currents and\naffinities and symmetry relations for the Onsager coefficients from linear\nresponse theory. For nonequilibrium steady states, the Onsager reciprocity\nrelations can be obtained from the more general fluctuation theorem for the\ncurrents. We prove a fluctuation theorem for the currents for periodically\ndriven systems. We show that this fluctuation theorem implies a fluctuation\ndissipation relation, symmetry relations for Onsager coefficients and further\nrelations for nonlinear response coefficients. The setup in this paper is more\ngeneral than previous studies, i.e., our results are valid for both heat\nengines and molecular pumps. The external protocol is assumed to be stochastic\nin our framework, which leads to a particularly convenient way to treat\nperiodically driven systems.\n", "  In this paper we consider the frame-like formulation for the so called\ninfinite (continuous) spin representations of the Poincare algebra. In the\nthree dimensional case we give explicit Lagrangian formulation for bosonic and\nfermionic infinite spin fields (including the complete sets of the gauge\ninvariant objects and all the necessary extra fields). Moreover we find the\nsupertransformations for the supermultiplet containing one bosonic and one\nfermionic fields leaving the sum of their Lagrangians invariant. Properties of\nsuch fields and supermultiplets in four and higher dimensions are also briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  A pair-normalized two-particle covariance versus the rapidity of the two\nparticles, called R$_2$, was originally studied in ISR and FNAL data in the\n1970's. This variable has recently seen renewed interest for the study of the\ndynamics of heavy-ion collisions in the longitudinal direction. These rapidity\ncorrelations can be decomposed into a basis set of Legendre polynomials with\nprefactors $\\langle a_{mn}\\rangle$, which can be considered the rapidity analog\nof the decomposition of azimuthal anisotropies into a set of cosine functions\nwith prefactors v$_{\\rm n}$. The $\\langle a_{mn}\\rangle$ values have been\nsuggested to be sensitive to the number of particle emitting sources, baryon\nstopping, viscosities, and critical behavior. The rapidity correlations have\nbeen measured by the STAR collaboration as a function of the beam energy for\n0-5% central Au$+$Au collisions with beam energies ranging from 7.7 to 200\n$\\mathrm{GeV}$. The experimental results and comparisons to the UrQMD model are\npresented.\n", "  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the 10 million to 10 billion\n$M_\\odot$ range form in galaxy mergers, and live in galactic nuclei with large\nand poorly constrained concentrations of gas and stars. There are currently no\nobservations of merging SMBHBs--- it is in fact possible that they stall at\ntheir final parsec of separation and never merge. While LIGO has detected high\nfrequency GWs, SMBHBs emit GWs in the nanohertz to millihertz band. This is\ninaccessible to ground-based interferometers, but possible with Pulsar Timing\nArrays (PTAs). Using data from local galaxies in the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey,\ntogether with galaxy merger rates from Illustris, we find that there are on\naverage $91\\pm7$ sources emitting GWs in the PTA band, and $7\\pm2$ binaries\nwhich will never merge. Local unresolved SMBHBs can contribute to GW background\nanisotropy at a level of $\\sim20\\%$, and if the GW background can be\nsuccessfully isolated, GWs from at least one local SMBHB can be detected in 10\nyears.\n", "  Density-functional theory (DFT) has revolutionized computational prediction\nof atomic-scale properties from first principles in physics, chemistry and\nmaterials science. Continuing development of new methods is necessary for\naccurate predictions of new classes of materials and properties, and for\nconnecting to nano- and mesoscale properties using coarse-grained theories.\nJDFTx is a fully-featured open-source electronic DFT software designed\nspecifically to facilitate rapid development of new theories, models and\nalgorithms. Using an algebraic formulation as an abstraction layer, compact\nC++11 code automatically performs well on diverse hardware including GPUs. This\ncode hosts the development of joint density-functional theory (JDFT) that\ncombines electronic DFT with classical DFT and continuum models of liquids for\nfirst-principles calculations of solvated and electrochemical systems. In\naddition, the modular nature of the code makes it easy to extend and interface\nwith, facilitating the development of multi-scale toolkits that connect to ab\ninitio calculations, e.g. photo-excited carrier dynamics combining electron and\nphonon calculations with electromagnetic simulations.\n", "  Single-shot qubit readout typically combines high readout contrast with\nlong-lived readout signals, leading to large signal-to-noise ratios and high\nreadout fidelities. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that both readout\ncontrast and readout signal lifetime, and thus the signal-to-noise ratio, can\nbe enhanced by forcing the qubit state to transition through intermediate\nstates. In this work, we demonstrate that the sub-Poissonian relaxation\nstatistics introduced by intermediate states can reduce the single-shot readout\nerror rate by orders of magnitude even when there is no increase in\nsignal-to-noise ratio. These results hold for moderate values of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio ($\\mathcal{S} \\lesssim 100$) and a small number of\nintermediate states ($N \\lesssim 10$). The ideas presented here could have\nimportant implications for readout schemes relying on the detection of\ntransient charge states, such as spin-to-charge conversion schemes for\nsemiconductor spin qubits and parity-to-charge conversion schemes for\ntopologically protected Majorana qubits.\n", "  Mapping of fundamental branes to their worldsheet (ws) multiplets originating\nfrom spontaneous breaking of the Poincare symmetry is studied. The interaction\nLagrangian for fields of the Nambu-Goldstone multiplet is shown to encode $R^2$\ngravity on the ws. The power law $k_{p}\\sim T_{p}^{\\frac{3-p}{2(p+1)}}$ for the\nSO(D-p-1) gauge coupling $k_{p}$ as the function of the p-brane tension $T_{p}$\nis assumed. It points to the presence of asymptotic freedom and confinement\nphases in brane matter. Their connection with collapse and inflation of the\nbranes is discussed.\n", "  We reveal new aspects of the interaction between plasmons and phonons in 2D\nmaterials that go beyond a mere shift and increase in plasmon width due to\ncoupling to either intrinsic vibrational modes of the material or phonons in a\nsupporting substrate. More precisely, we predict strong plasmon splitting due\nto this coupling, resulting in a characteristic avoided crossing scheme. We\nbase our results on a computationally efficient approach consisting in\nincluding many-body interactions through the electron self-energy. We specify\nthis formalism for a description of plasmons based upon a tight-binding\nelectron Hamiltonian combined with the random-phase approximation. This\napproach is accurate provided vertex corrections can be neglected, as is is the\ncase in conventional plasmon-supporting metals and Dirac-fermion systems. We\nillustrate our method by evaluating plasmonic spectra of doped graphene\nnanotriangles with varied size, where we predict remarkable peak splittings and\nother radical modifications in the spectra due to plasmons interactions with\nintrinsic optical phonons. Our method is equally applicable to other 2D\nmaterials and provides a simple approach for investigating coupling of plasmons\nto phonons, excitons, and other excitations in hybrid thin nanostructures.\n", "  Photonic data routing in optical networks overcomes the limitations of\nelectronic routers with respect to data rate, latency, and energy consumption\nwhile suffering from dynamic power consumption, non-simultaneous usage of\nmultiple wavelength channels, and large footprints. Here we show the first\nhybrid photonic-plasmonic, non-blocking, broadband 5x5 router. The compact\nfootprint (<250 {\\mu}m2) enables high operation speed (480 GHz) requiring only\n82 fJ/bit (1.9 dB) of averaged energy consumption (routing loss). The router\nsupports multi-wavelength up to 206 nm in the telecom band. Having a\ndata-capacity of >70 Tbps, thus demonstrating key features required by future\nhigh data-throughput optical networks.\n", "  In this paper, we present the project of the heliogyro solar sail unit for\ndeployment of CubeSat constellation and satellite deorbiting. The ballistic\ncalculations show that constellation deployment period can vary from 0.18 years\nfor 450km initial orbit and 2 CubeSats up to 1.4 years for 650km initial orbit\nand 8 CubeSats. We also describe the structural and electrical design of the\nunit and consider aspects of its integration into a standard CubeSat frame.\n", "  We measured mid-infrared polarization of protoplanetary discs to gain new\ninsight into their magnetic fields. Using CanariCam at the 10.4 m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias, we detected linear polarization at 8.7, 10.3, and 12.5\n$\\mu$m from discs around eight Herbig Ae/Be stars and one T-Tauri star. We\nanalyzed polarimetric properties of each object to find out the most likely\ninterpretation of the data. While the observed mid-infrared polarization from\nmost objects is consistent with polarized emission and/or absorption arising\nfrom aligned dust particles, we cannot rule out polarization due to dust\nscattering for a few objects in our sample. For those objects for which\npolarization can be explained by polarized emission and/or absorption, we\nexamined how the derived magnetic field structure correlates with the disc\nposition angle and inclination. We found no preference for a certain type of\nmagnetic field. Instead, various configurations (toroidal, poloidal, or\ncomplex) are inferred from the observations. The detection rate (64 per cent)\nof polarized mid-infrared emission and/or absorption supports the expectation\nthat magnetic fields and suitable conditions for grain alignment are common in\nprotoplanetary discs around Herbig Ae/Be stars.\n", "  We investigate systematics of the freezeout surface in heavy ion collisions\ndue to the hadron spectrum. The role of suspected resonance states that are yet\nto be confirmed experimentally in identifying the freezeout surface has been\ninvestigated. We have studied two different freezeout schemes - unified\nfreezeout scheme where all hadrons are assumed to freezeout at the same thermal\nstate and a flavor dependent sequential freezeout scheme with different\nfreezeout thermal states for hadrons with or without valence strange quarks.\nThe data of mean hadron yields as well as scaled variance of net proton and net\ncharge distributions have been analysed. We find the freezeout temperature $T$\nto drop by $\\sim5\\%$ while the dimensionless freezeout parameters $\\mu_B/T$ and\n$VT^3$ ($\\mu_B$ and $V$ are the baryon chemical potential and the volume at\nfreezeout respectively) are insensitive to the systematics of the input hadron\nspectrum. The observed hint of flavor hierarchy in $T$ and $VT^3$ with only\nconfirmed resonances survives the systematics of the hadron spectrum. It is\nmore prominent between $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim10 - 100$ GeV where the maximum\nhierarchy in $T\\sim10\\%$ and $VT^3\\sim40\\%$. However, the uncertainties in the\nthermal parameters due to the systematics of the hadron spectrum and their\ndecay properties do not allow us to make a quantitative estimate of the flavor\nhierarchy yet.\n", "  The addition or subtraction of a photon from a Gaussian state of light is a\nversatile and experimentally feasible procedure to create non-Gaussian states.\nIn multimode setups, these states manifest a wide range of phenomena when the\nphoton is added or subtracted in a mode-tunable way. In this contribution, we\nderive the truncated correlations, which are multimode generalisations of\ncumulants, between quadratures in different modes as statistical signatures of\nthese states. These correlations are then used to obtain the full multimode\nWigner function, the properties of which are subsequently studied. In\nparticular we investigate the effect of impurity in the subtraction or addition\nprocess, and evaluate its impact on the negativity of the Wigner function.\nFinally, we elaborate on the generation of inherent entanglement through\nsubtraction or addition of a photon from a pure squeezed vacuum.\n", "  We report electron spin resonance spectroscopy measurements performed at\nmillikelvin temperatures in a custom-built spectrometer comprising a\nsuperconducting micro-resonator at $7$ GHz and a Josephson parametric\namplifier. Owing to the small ${\\sim}10^{-12}\\lambda^3$ magnetic resonator mode\nvolume and to the low noise of the parametric amplifier, the spectrometer\nsensitivity reaches $260\\pm40$ spins$/$echo and $65\\pm10$\n$\\mathrm{spins}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$, respectively.\n", "  F-theory requires a new Virasoro algebra, including $\\kappa$-symmetry, with a\nworldvolume coordinate for each generator. (Similar is implied for the\nsuperstring.) Doubles of the spacetime coordinates are eliminated by\nselfduality, which now applies to all currents.\n", "  The Liouville integrability of the generalised type II defects is\ninvestigated. Full integrability is not considered, only the existence of an\ninfinite number of conserved quantities associated with a system containing a\ndefect. For defects in affine Toda field theories (ATFTs) it is shown that\nmomentum conservation is very likely to be a necessary condition for\nintegrability. The defect Lax matrices which guarantee zero curvature, and so\nan infinite number of conserved quantities, are calculated for the momentum\nconserving Tzitz\\'eica defect and the momentum conserving $D_4$ ATFT defect.\nSome additional calculations pertaining to the $D_4$ defect are also carried\nout to find a more complete set of defect potentials than has appeared\npreviously.\n", "  The first direct detection of the asteroidal YORP effect, a phenomenon that\nchanges the spin states of small bodies due to thermal reemission of sunlight\nfrom their surfaces, was obtained for (54509) YORP 2000 PH5. Such an alteration\ncan slowly increase the rotation rate of asteroids, driving them to reach their\nfission limit and causing their disruption. This process can produce binaries\nand unbound asteroid pairs. Secondary fission opens the door to the eventual\nformation of transient but genetically-related groupings. Here, we show that\nthe small near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 2017 FZ2 was a co-orbital of our planet of\nthe quasi-satellite type prior to their close encounter on 2017 March 23.\nBecause of this flyby with the Earth, 2017 FZ2 has become a non-resonant NEA.\nOur N-body simulations indicate that this object may have experienced\nquasi-satellite engagements with our planet in the past and it may return as a\nco-orbital in the future. We identify a number of NEAs that follow similar\npaths, the largest named being YORP, which is also an Earth's co-orbital. An\napparent excess of NEAs moving in these peculiar orbits is studied within the\nframework of two orbit population models. A possibility that emerges from this\nanalysis is that such an excess, if real, could be the result of mass shedding\nfrom YORP itself or a putative larger object that produced YORP. Future\nspectroscopic observations of 2017 FZ2 during its next visit in 2018 (and of\nrelated objects when feasible) may be able to confirm or reject this\ninterpretation.\n", "  The entropic moments of the probability density of a quantum system in\nposition and momentum spaces describe not only some fundamental and/or\nexperimentally accessible quantities of the system, but also the entropic\nuncertainty measures of R\\'enyi type which allow one to find the most relevant\nmathematical formalizations of the position-momentum Heisenberg's uncertainty\nprinciple, the entropic uncertainty relations. It is known that the solution of\ndifficult three-dimensional problems can be very well approximated by a series\ndevelopment in $1/D$ in similar systems with a non-standard dimensionality $D$;\nmoreover, several physical quantities of numerous atomic and molecular systems\nhave been numerically shown to have values in the large-$D$ limit comparable to\nthe corresponding ones provided by the three-dimensional numerical\nself-consistent field methods. The $D$-dimensional hydrogenic atom is the main\nprototype of the physics of multidimensional many-electron systems. In this\nwork we rigorously determine the leading term of the R\\'enyi entropies of the\n$D$-dimensional hydrogenic atom at the limit of large $D$. As a byproduct, we\nshow that our results saturate the known position-momentum\nR\\'enyi-entropy-based uncertainty relations.\n", "  It is now widely recognized that large Bjorken $x$ data play an important\nrole in global analyses of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) even at\ncollider energies, through perturbative QCD evolution. For values of the scale\nof the reaction, $Q^2$, in the multi-GeV region the structure functions at\nlarge $x$ present resonance structure. Notwithstanding, these data can be\nincorporated in the analyses by using quark-hadron duality or approximate\nscaling of the structure function data averaged over their resonance structure.\nSeveral averaging methods have been proposed using either the PDFs Mellin\nmoments, or their truncated moments. We propose an alternative method using\nBernstein polynomials integrals, or Bernstein moments. Bernstein moments render\na smooth form of the structure function in the resonance region. Furthermore,\nbeing based on a different averaging criterion than the methods adopted so far,\nthey provide a new framework for understanding the possible mechanisms giving\norigin to the phenomenon of quark-hadron duality.\n", "  Since its launch in 1999, the Chandra X-ray observatory has discovered\nseveral dozen X-ray jets associated with powerful quasars. In many cases the\nX-ray spectrum is hard and appears to come from a second spectral component.\nThe most popular explanation for the kpc-scale X-ray emission in these cases\nhas been inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nphotons by relativistic electrons in the jet (the IC/CMB model). Requiring the\nIC/CMB emission to reproduce the observed X-ray flux density inevitably\npredicts a high level of gamma-ray emission which should be detectable with the\nFermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). In previous work, we found that gamma-ray\nupper limits from the large scale jets of 3C 273 and PKS 0637-752 violate the\npredictions of the IC/CMB model. Here we present Fermi/LAT flux density upper\nlimits for the X-ray jets of four additional sources: PKS 1136-135, PKS\n1229-021, PKS 1354+195, and PKS 2209+080, and show that these limits violate\nthe IC/CMB predictions at a very high significance level. We also present new\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the quasar PKS 2209+080 showing a\nnewly detected optical jet, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) band 3 and 6 observations of all four sources, which provide key\nconstraints on the spectral shape that enable us to rule out the IC/CMB model.\n", "  Inspired by 5d supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories placed on the compact space\n$\\mathbb{S}^5$, we propose an intriguing algebraic construction for the\n$q$-Virasoro algebra. We show that, when multiple $q$-Virasoro \"chiral\" sectors\nhave to be fused together, a natural $\\mathrm{SL}(3,\\mathbb{Z})$ structure\narises. This construction, which we call the modular triple, is consistent with\nthe observed triple factorization properties of supersymmetric partition\nfunctions derived from localization arguments. We also give a 2d CFT-like\nconstruction of the modular triple, and conjecture for the first time a\n(non-local) Lagrangian formulation for a $q$-Virasoro model, resembling\nordinary Liouville theory.\n", "  Position-sensitive detectors for cold and ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) are in\nuse in fundamental research. In particular, measuring the properties of the\nquantum states of bouncing neutrons requires micro-metric spatial resolution.\nTo this end, a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) coated with a thin conversion layer\nthat allows a real time detection of neutron hits is under development at LPSC.\nIn this paper, we present the design and performance of a dedicated electronic\nboard designed to read-out eight CCDs simultaneously and operating under\nvacuum.\n", "  Based on the modification to area-law due to thermal fluctuation at small\nhorizon radius, we investigate the thermodynamics of charged quasitopological\nand charged rotating quasitopological black holes. In particular, we derive the\nleading-order corrections to the Gibbs free energy, charge and total mass\ndensities. In order to analyse the behavior of the thermal fluctuations on the\nthermodynamics of small black holes, we draw a comparative analysis between the\nfirst-order corrected and original thermodynamical quantities. We also examine\nthe stability and bound points of such black holes under effect of\nleading-order corrections.\n", "  We discuss diphoton semi(exclusive) production in ultraperipheral lead-lead\ncollisions at energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV (LHC) and in proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{pp}}$ = 7 TeV (LHC) and $\\sqrt{s_{pp}}$ = 100 TeV\n(FCC). The nuclear calculations are based on equivalent photon approximation in\nthe impact parameter space. The cross sections for elementary $\\gamma\\gamma \\to\n\\gamma\\gamma$ subprocess are calculated including three different mechanisms:\nbox diagrams with leptons and quarks in the loops, a VDM-Regge contribution\nwith virtual intermediate hadronic excitations of the photons and the two-gluon\nexchange contribution. We get relatively high cross sections in heavy ion\ncollisions. This opens a possibility to study the light-by-light (quasi)elastic\nscattering at the LHC. We find that the cross section for elastic\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ scattering could be measured in the lead-lead collisions for the\ndiphoton invariant mass up to $W_{\\gamma\\gamma} \\approx$ 15 - 20 GeV. Our\nStandard Model predictions are compared to a recent ATLAS experimental result.\nWe present differential distributions for PbPb$\\to$PbPb$\\gamma\\gamma$ and\npp$\\to$pp$\\gamma\\gamma$ reaction.\n", "  Structural and electronic properties of pristine and transition metal doped\nZnS monolayer are investigated within the framework of density functional\ntheory. The pristine ZnS monolayer is showing direct band gap of about 2.8 eV.\nThe investigated transition metal doping showed the transition from\nnon-magnetic semiconductor to a magnetic system e.g. magnetic semiconductor for\nCo doped ZnS and half metal for Ni doped ZnS monolayers. The Co doped ZnS\nmonolayer showed higher formation energy, confirming the strong bonding than\nthat of Ni doped ZnS monolayer. The electron difference density shows the\ncharge sharing between transition metal (Ni and Co) and S, confirming the\ncovalent bond formation.\n", "  Time-resolved ultrafast x-ray scattering from photo-excited matter is an\nemerging method to image ultrafast dynamics in matter with atomic-scale spatial\nand temporal resolutions. For a correct and rigorous understanding of current\nand upcoming imaging experiments, we present the theory of time-resolved x-ray\nscattering from an incoherent electronic mixture using quantum electrodynamical\ntheory of light-matter interaction. We show that the total scattering signal is\nan incoherent sum of the individual scattering signals arising from different\nelectronic states and therefore heterodyning of the individual signals is not\npossible for an ensemble of gas-phase photo-excited molecules. We scrutinize\nthe information encoded in the total signal for the experimentally important\nsituation when pulse duration and coherence time of the x-ray pulse are short\nin comparison to the timescale of the vibrational motion and long in comparison\nto the timescale of the electronic motion, respectively. Finally, we show that\nin the case of an electronically excited crystal the total scattering signal\nimprints the interference of the individual scattering amplitudes associated\nwith different electronic states and heterodyning is possible.\n", "  We describe a model of tidal disruption events (TDEs) with input physical\nparameters that include the black hole (BH) mass $M_{\\bullet}$, the specific\norbital energy $E$, the angular momentum $J$, the star mass $M_{\\star}$ and\nradius $R_{\\star}$. We calculate the rise time of the TDEs, the peak bolometric\nluminosity in terms of these physical parameters and a typical light curve of\nTDEs for various All Sky Survey (ASS) and Deep Sky Survey (DSS) missions. We\nthen derive the expected detection rates and discuss the follow up of TDEs\nthrough observations in various spectral bands from X-rays to radio\nwavelengths.\n", "  Public key quantum money can be seen as a version of the quantum no-cloning\ntheorem that holds even when the quantum states can be verified by the\nadversary. In this work, investigate quantum lightning, a formalization of\n\"collision-free quantum money\" defined by Lutomirski et al. [ICS'10], where\nno-cloning holds even when the adversary herself generates the quantum state to\nbe cloned. We then study quantum money and quantum lightning, showing the\nfollowing results:\n  - We demonstrate the usefulness of quantum lightning by showing several\npotential applications, such as generating random strings with a proof of\nentropy, to completely decentralized cryptocurrency without a block-chain,\nwhere transactions is instant and local.\n  - We give win-win results for quantum money/lightning, showing that either\nsignatures/hash functions/commitment schemes meet very strong recently proposed\nnotions of security, or they yield quantum money or lightning.\n  - We construct quantum lightning under the assumed multi-collision resistance\nof random degree-2 systems of polynomials.\n  - We show that instantiating the quantum money scheme of Aaronson and\nChristiano [STOC'12] with indistinguishability obfuscation that is secure\nagainst quantum computers yields a secure quantum money scheme\n", "  We describe how the holographic, BPST Pomeron can be used to describe\ninclusive central production at the LHC.\n", "  In this chapter, we present an overview of sources of biologically relevant\nastrophysical radiation and effects of that radiation on organisms and their\nhabitats. We consider both electromagnetic and particle radiation, with an\nemphasis on ionizing radiation and ultraviolet light, all of which can impact\norganisms directly as well as indirectly through modifications of their\nhabitats. We review what is known about specific sources, such as supernovae,\ngamma-ray bursts, and stellar activity, including the radiation produced and\nlikely rates of significant events. We discuss both negative and potential\npositive impacts on individual organisms and their environments and how\nradiation in a broad context affects habitability.\n", "  We present an analysis of the average spectral properties of 12,000 SDSS\nquasars as a function of accretion disc inclination, as measured from the\nequivalent width of the [O III] 5007{\\AA} line. The use of this indicator on a\nlarge sample of quasars from the SDSS DR7 has proven the presence of\norientation effects on the features of UV/optical spectra, confirming the\npresence of outflows in the NLR gas and that the geometry of the BLR is\ndisc-like. Relying on the goodness of this indicator, we are now using it to\ninvestigate other bands/components of AGN. Specifically, the study of the\nUV/optical/IR SED of the same sample provides information on the obscuring\n\"torus\". The SED shows a decrease of the IR fraction moving from face-on to\nedge-on sources, in agreement with models where the torus is co-axial with the\naccretion disc. Moreover, the fact we are able to observe the broad emission\nlines also in sources in an edge-on position, suggests that the torus is rather\nclumpy than smooth as in the Unified Model. The behaviour of the SED as a\nfunction of EW[OIII] is in agreement with the predictions of the clumpy torus\nmodels as well.\n", "  NGC 4258 is an SABbc Seyfert galaxy, located at a distance of $7.2 \\pm 0.3$\nMpc. This object is well known by its nearly edge-on molecular nuclear disc,\nlocated between 0.16 and 0.28 pc from the nucleus, whose H$_2$O maser emission\nallows a very precise measurement of the central supermassive black hole mass\n($M_{\\bullet}(maser) = 3.78 \\pm 0.01 \\times 10^7$ Mo). We analyse the emission\nline properties and the stellar kinematics in a data cube of the central region\nof NGC 4258, obtained, in the K band, with the Near-Infrared Integral Field\nSpectrograph, at the Gemini-north telescope. The nuclear spectrum, after the\nstarlight subtraction, shows only the H$_2 \\lambda 2.1218$ $\\mu$m and\nBr$\\gamma$ emission lines, the latter having a broad component with\nFWHM$_{Br\\gamma}(broad) = 1600 \\pm 29$ km s$^{-1}$. The spatial morphology and\nkinematics of the H$_2 \\lambda 2.1218$ $\\mu$m line are consistent with a\nrotating molecular disc around the supermassive black hole, with an upper limit\nfor its diameter of 15.7 pc. The inner radio jet in this object is, in\nprojection, almost perpendicular to the H$_2$ emitting disc detected in this\nwork, and also to the H$_2$O maser emitting disc. The main features of the maps\nof the stellar kinematic parameters are well reproduced by a model of a thin\nrotating stellar circular disc. The supermassive black hole mass provided by\nthis dynamical modelling ($M_{\\bullet}(disc) = 2.8 \\pm 1.0 \\times 10^7$ Mo) is\ncompatible, at 1$\\sigma$ level, with the precise measurement resulting from the\nH$_2$O maser emission.\n", "  Geosciences is a field of great societal relevance that requires solutions to\nseveral urgent problems facing our humanity and the planet. As geosciences\nenters the era of big data, machine learning (ML) -- that has been widely\nsuccessful in commercial domains -- offers immense potential to contribute to\nproblems in geosciences. However, problems in geosciences have several unique\nchallenges that are seldom found in traditional applications, requiring novel\nproblem formulations and methodologies in machine learning. This article\nintroduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these\nchallenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for\nadvancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical\nsources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make it\nchallenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describe\nsome of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can\nplay a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directions\nfor methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussing\nsome of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicable\nacross all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deep\ncollaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic\nadvancements in both disciplines.\n", "  Macroscopic spontaneous coherence of exciton-polariton in semiconductor\ncavity is one important research field in condensed matter physics.\nAll-inorganic micro/nanowire Fabry-P\\'erot cavity with excellent optical\nperformance makes it possible to realize strong coupling and lasing of\nexciton-photon at room temperature. In this work, we demonstrated strong\ncoupling of exciton-photon and polariton lasing in CsPbBr3 micro/nanowires\nsynthesized by CVD method. By exploring spatial resolved PL spectra of CsPbBr3\ncavity, we observed mode volume dependent coupling strength , as well as\nsignificant increase in group index. Moreover, low threshold polariton lasing\nwas achieved at room temperature within strong coupling regime; the polariton\ncharacteristic is confirmed by comparing lasing spectra with waveguided output\nspectra and the dramatically reduced lasing threshold. Our present results\nprovide new avenues to achieve high coupling strengths potentially enabling\napplication of exciting phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation of\npolaritons, efficient light-emitting diodes and lasers.\n", "  In this paper, the influence of fan-shaped buffer zone on the performance of\nthe toll plaza is researched. A two-dimensional traffic flow model and a\ncomprehensive evaluation model based on mechanical model and psychological\nfield are established. The traffic flow model is simulated by creating\ncoordinate system.\n  We first establish queue theory model to analyze vehicles when entering toll\nplaza. Then, a two-dimensional steadily car-following model is established\nbased on psychological field for the analysis of vehicles when leaving toll\nplaza. According to psychological field theory, we analyze the force condition\nof each vehicle. The force of each vehicle is contributed by the vehicles in\nits observation area and obstacles. By projecting these vehicles and obstacles\nvia the equipotential line in the psychological field, the influence on the\nvalue and direction acceleration of following vehicles is obtained.\nConsequently, the changes of each vehicle's speed and position are obtained as\nwell. Next, we establish simulation based on the states of vehicles and make\nthe rules of vehicle state-changing. By simulating the system, we obtain the\nthroughput of the toll plaza's input and output. Then we obtained the bearing\npressure on the road by the max throughput and the demand of the roads. Using\nthe number of cars in per unit area as the safety factor. Then a comprehensive\nevaluation model is established based on bearing pressure on the road, cost and\nsafety factor.\n", "  Nowadays, the current threat of international terrorism is set to a severe\nlevel, demanding worldwide enhanced security. Radioactive materials that could\nbe fashioned into a radiation dispersal device typically emit gamma rays, while\nfissile materials such as uranium and plutonium emit both neutrons and gamma\nrays via spontaneous or induced fission. Therefore, the detection and\nidentification of hazardous materials has become increasingly important. We\npresent the results of GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation of an active neutron\ninterrogation system based on highly segmented neutron/gamma-ray detector and\npulsed neutron generator. This system is capable of detecting and imaging\nradioactive and special nuclear materials, explosives and drugs. The segmented\nscintillation detector works as a scatter camera, allowing selection of a gamma\nray events that undergo multiple interaction in detector blocks for radioactive\nsource localization. The detector consist of blocks made of plastic\nscintillator which provide scattering and blocks of CsI, used as an absorber,\nused as an absorber, which has to be efficient to detect the characteristic\ngamma radiation for the identification. Because of this imaging capability\nbackground events can be significantly rejected, decreasing the number of\nevents required for high confidence detection and thereby greatly improving its\nsensitivity. A scatter imager for the detection of shielded radioactive\nmaterials has been conceptualized, simulated, and refined to maximize\nsensitivity while minimizing cost.\n", "  Applications of Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) modeling are becoming\nincreasingly prevalent in engineering analyses involving fractured rock masses.\nFor example, kinematic evaluations of slope or underground excavation stability\nand the modeling of fluid flow in fractured rock have been shown to benefit\nsignificantly from the explicit representation of DFN realizations in the\nsimulations. In practice, due to high computing costs, namely time, a balance\nmust be struck that limits analyses to the consideration of only a few\nrealizations as input. As a stochastic representation, a single realization is\nonly one possibility. It is therefore critical that the selected realizations\n(possibilities) are able to summarize the range of variations present in the\ninput parameters adequately for the purpose of study or practice. That is, the\nsignificance of diversity (dissimilarity) in the generated fracture networks is\nof great importance and should be assessed prior to further often\ntime-consuming processing stages. We demonstrate here a novel development in\nthe analysis of the similarity between three-dimensional fracture networks,\nwhich provides an accurate, efficient and practical solution with comprehensive\ncoverage of model variations. Several examples are presented together with a\ncomparison between the proposed three-dimensional method and existing methods\nlimited to two-dimensional assumptions. It is shown that the two-dimensional\nsimilarity methods despite their popularity are heavily biased and poorly\nrepresent the reality.\n", "  The recent development of sensitive, high time resolution instruments at\nradio telescopes has enabled the discovery of millisecond duration fast radio\nbursts (FRBs). The FRB class encompasses a number of single pulses, many unique\nin their own way, so far hindering the development of a consensus for their\norigin. The key to demystifying FRBs lies in discovering many of them in\nrealtime in order to localise them and identity commonalities. Despite rigorous\nfollow-up, only one FRB has been seen to repeat suggesting the possibility of\nthere being two independent classes of FRBs and thus two classes of possible\nprogenitors. This paper discusses recent developments in the field, the FRB-GRB\nconnection, some of the open questions in FRB astronomy and how the next\ngeneration telescopes are vital in the quest to understand this enigmatic\npopulation.\n", "  This review analyzes the state and advancement of the dark matter halo\nconcentrations over the last two decades. It begins with presenting the article\nthat brought the field to the limelight and then follows through with other\nresearch works that studied the concentrations of dark matter haloes over the\nages. Besides the discussion of the halo mass-concentration relation and its\nevolution, we examine the effects of cosmology, subhaloes and environment on\nthe relation. In addition to theoretical halo concentrations, observational\ndark matter halo concentrations are also considered. This review synthesizes\nthe progress in this field into a clear piece of article.\n", "  We provide a fast method for computing constraints on impactor pre-impact\norbits, applying this to the late giant impacts in the Solar System. These\nconstraints can be used to make quick, broad comparisons of different collision\nscenarios, identifying some immediately as low-probability events, and\nnarrowing the parameter space in which to target follow-up studies with\nexpensive N-body simulations. We benchmark our parameter space predictions,\nfinding good agreement with existing N-body studies for the Moon. We suggest\nthat high-velocity impact scenarios in the inner Solar System, including all\ncurrently proposed single impact scenarios for the formation of Mercury, should\nbe disfavoured. This leaves a multiple hit-and-run scenario as the most\nprobable currently proposed for the formation of Mercury.\n", "  The Gamma-Ray Infrastructure For Fundamental Investigations of Nuclei,\nGRIFFIN, is a new experimental facility for radioactive decay studies at the\nTRIUMF-ISAC laboratory. The performance of the 16 high-purity germanium (HPGe)\nclover detectors that will make up the GRIFFIN spectrometer is reported. The\nenergy resolution, efficiency, timing resolution, crosstalk and preamplifier\nproperties of each crystal were measured using a combination of analogue and\ndigital data acquisition techniques. The absolute efficiency and add-back\nfactors are determined for the energy range of 80 - 3450 keV. The detectors\nshow excellent performance with an average over all 64 crystals of a FWHM\nenergy resolution of 1.89(6) keV and relative efficiency with respect to a\n3\"x3\" NaI detector of 41(1)% at 1.3 MeV.\n", "  We present a new simple algorithm for efficient, and relatively accurate\ncomputation of the Faddeyeva function w(z). The algorithm carefully exploits\nprevious approximations by Hui et al [1978] and Humlicek [1982] along with\nasymptotic expressions from Laplace continued fractions. Over a wide and fine\ngrid of the complex argument, z=x+iy, numerical results from the present\napproximation show a maximum relative error less than 4.0x10-5 for both real\nand imaginary parts of w while running in a relatively shorter execution time\nthan other competitive techniques. In addition to the calculation of the\nFaddeyeva function, w, partial derivatives of the real and imaginary parts of\nthe function can easily be calculated and returned as optional output.\n", "  First proposed by Paczynski in 1986, microlensing has been instrumental in\nthe search of compact dark matter as well as discovery and characterization of\nexoplanets. In this article, we provide a brief history of microlensing,\nespecially on the discoveries of compact objects and exoplanets. We then review\nthe basics of microlensing and how astrometry can help break the degeneracy,\nproviding a more robust determination of the nature of the microlensing events.\nWe also outline prospects that will be made by on-going and forth-coming\nexperiments/observatories\n", "  To rank nodes in quasi-hierarchical networks of social nature, it is\nnecessary to carry out a detailed analysis of the network and evaluate the\nresults obtained according to all the given criteria and identify the most\ninfluential nodes. Existing ranking algorithms in the overwhelming majority\nestimate such networks in general, which does not allow to clearly determine\nthe influence of nodes among themselves. In the course of the study, an\nanalysis of the results of known algorithms for ranking the nodes of HITS,\nPageRank and compares the obtained data with the expert evaluation of the\nnetwork. For the effective analysis of quasi-hierarchical networks, the basic\nalgorithm of HITS is modified, which allows to evaluate and rank nodes\naccording to the given criteria (the number of input and output links among\nthemselves), which corresponds to the results of expert evaluation. It is shown\nthat the received method in some cases provides results that correspond to the\nreal social relation, and the indexes of the authorship of the nodes -\npre-assigned social roles.\n", "  Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) are known for its ability to capture CO2.\nAlthough many FLPs have been reported experimentally and several theoretical\nstudies have been carried out to address the reaction mechanism, the individual\nroles of Lewis acids and bases of FLP in the capture of CO2 is still unclear.\nIn this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) based metadynamics\nsimulations to investigate the complete path for the capture of CO2 by\ntBu3P/B(C6F5)3 pair, and to understand the role of the Lewis acid and base.\nInterestingly, we have found out that the Lewis acids play more important role\nthan Lewis bases. Specifically, the Lewis acids are crucial for catalytical\nproperties and are responsible for both kinetic and thermodynamics control. The\nLewis bases, however, have less impact on the catalytic performance and are\nmainly responsible for the formation of FLP systems. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a thumb of rule for the future synthesis of FLP-based catalyst for\nthe utilization of CO2.\n", "  This overview provides a historical perspective highlighting the pioneering\nrole which the fairly modest observational facilities of ARIES have played\nsince the 1990s in systematically characterizing the optical variability on\nhour-like time scale (intra-night optical variability, or INOV) of several\nmajor types of high-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Such information\nwas previously available only for blazars. Similar studies have since been\ninitiated in at least a dozen countries, giving a boost to AGN variability\nresearch.\n  Our work has, in particular, provided strong indication that mild INOV occurs\nin radio-quiet QSOs (amplitude up to $\\sim 3-5\\%$ and duty cycle $\\sim 10\\%$)\nand, moreover, has demonstrated that similarly mild INOV is exhibited even by\nthe vast majority of radio-loud quasars which possess powerful relativistic\njets (even including many that are beamed towards us). The solitary outliers\nare blazars, the tiny strongly polarized subset of powerful AGN, which\nfrequently exhibit a pronounced INOV. Among the blazars, BL Lac objects often\nshow a bluer-when-brighter chromatic behavior, while the flat spectrum radio\nquasars seem not to. Quantifying any differences of INOV among the major\nsubclasses of non-blazar type AGNs will require dedicated monitoring programs\nusing $2-3$ metre class telescopes.\n", "  We present design and construction of a large low-mass Triple-GEM detector\nprototype for forward tracking at a future Electron-Ion Collider. In this\nenvironment, multiple scattering of forward and backward tracks must be\nminimized so that electron tracks can be cleanly matched to calorimeter\nclusters and so that hadron tracks can efficiently seed RICH ring\nreconstruction for particle identification. Consequently, the material budget\nfor the forward tracking detectors is critical. The construction of the\ndetector builds on the mechanical foil stretching and assembly technique\npioneered by CMS for the muon endcap GEM upgrade. As an innovation, this\ndetector implements drift and readout electrodes on thin large foils instead of\non PCBs. These foils get stretched mechanically together with three GEM foils\nin a single stack. This reduces the radiation length of the total detector\nmaterial in the active area by a factor seven from over 4% to below 0.6%. It\nalso aims at improving the uniformity of drift and induction gap sizes across\nthe detector and consequently signal response uniformity. Thin outer frames\ncustom-made from carbon-fiber composite material take up the tension from the\nstretched foil stack and provide detector rigidity while keeping the detector\nmass low. The gas volume is closed with thin aluminized polyimide foils. The\ntrapezoidal detector covers an azimuthal angle of 30.1 degrees and a radius\nfrom 8 cm to 90 cm. It is read out with radial zigzag strips with pitches of\n1.37 mrad at the outer radius and 4.14 mrad at the inner radius that reduce the\nnumber of required electronics channels and associated cost while maintaining\ngood spatial resolution. All front-end readout electronics is located away from\nthe active area at the outer radius of the trapezoid.\n", "  Using the B\\\"{u}ttiker-Landauer formulation of transport theory in the linear\nresponse regime, the valley currents and non-local resistances of bilayer\ngraphene nanostructures with broken inversion symmetry are calculated. It is\nshown that broken inversion symmetry in bilayer graphene nanostructures leads\nto striking enhancement of the non-local 4-terminal resistance and to valley\ncurrents several times stronger than the conventional electric current when the\nFermi energy is in the spectral gap close to the energy of Dirac point. The\nscaling relation between local and non-local resistances is investigated as the\ngate voltage varies at zero Fermi energy and a power-law is found to be\nsatisfied. The valley velocity field and valley accumulation in four-terminal\nbilayer graphene nanostructures are evaluated in the presence of inversion\nsymmetry breaking. The valley velocity and non-local resistance are found to\nscale differently with the applied gate voltage. The unit cell-averaged valley\naccumulation is found to exhibit a dipolar spatial distribution consistent with\nthe accumulation arising from the valley currents. We define and calculate a\n{\\em valley capacitance} that characterizes the valley accumulation response to\nvoltages applied to the nanostructure's contacts.\n", "  We develop a probabilistic method for tracking glacier surface motion based\non time-lapse imagery, which works by sequentially resampling a stochastic\nstate-space model according to a likelihood determined through correlation\nbetween reference and test images. The method is robust due to its natural\nhandling of periodic occlusion and its capacity to follow multiple hypothesis\ndisplacements between images, and can improve estimates of velocity magnitude\nand direction through the inclusion of observations from an arbitrary number of\ncameras. We apply the method to an annual record of images from two cameras\nnear the terminus of Columbia Glacier. While the method produces velocities at\ndaily resolution, we verify our results by comparing eleven-day means to\nTerraSar-X. We find that Columbia Glacier transitions between a winter state\ncharacterized by moderate velocities and little temporal variability, to an\nearly summer speed-up in which velocities are sensitive to increases in melt-\nand rainwater, to a fall slowdown, where velocities drop to below their winter\nmean and become insensitive to external forcing, a pattern consistent with the\ndevelopment and collapse of efficient and inefficient subglacial hydrologic\nnetworks throughout the year.\n", "  Spin-orbit torques (SOT) allow the electrical control of magnetic states.\nCurrent-induced SOT switching of the perpendicular magnetization is of\nparticular technological importance. The SOT consists of damping-like and\nfield-like torques so that the efficient SOT switching requires to understand\ncombined effects of the two torque-components. Previous quasi-static\nmeasurements have reported an increased switching probability with the width of\ncurrent pulses, as predicted with considering the damping-like torque only.\nHere we report a decreased switching probability at longer pulse-widths, based\non time-resolved measurements. Micromagnetic analysis reveals that this\nanomalous SOT switching results from domain wall reflections at sample edges.\nThe domain wall reflection is found to strongly depend on the field-like torque\nand its relative sign to the damping-like torque. Our result demonstrates a key\nrole of the field-like torque in the deterministic SOT switching and notifies\nthe importance of sign correlation of the two torque-components, which may shed\nlight on the SOT switching mechanism.\n", "  Deterministic magnetization switching using spin-orbit torque (SOT) has\nrecently emerged as an efficient means to electrically control the magnetic\nstate of ultrathin magnets. The SOT switching still lacks in oscillatory\nswitching characteristics over time, therefore, it is limited to bipolar\noperation where a change in polarity of the applied current or field is\nrequired for bistable switching. The coherent rotation based oscillatory\nswitching schemes cannot be applied to SOT because the SOT switching occurs\nthrough expansion of magnetic domains. Here, we experimentally achieve\noscillatory switching in incoherent SOT process by controlling domain wall\ndynamics. We find that a large field-like component can dynamically influence\nthe domain wall chirality which determines the direction of SOT switching.\nConsequently, under nanosecond current pulses, the magnetization switches\nalternatively between the two stable states. By utilizing this oscillatory\nswitching behavior we demonstrate a unipolar deterministic SOT switching scheme\nby controlling the current pulse duration.\n", "  We present the first results of a search for transient hard X-ray (HXR)\nemission in the quiet solar corona with the \\textit{Nuclear Spectroscopic\nTelescope Array} (\\textit{NuSTAR}) satellite. While \\textit{NuSTAR} was\ndesigned as an astrophysics mission, it can observe the Sun above 2~keV with\nunprecedented sensitivity due to its pioneering use of focusing optics.\n\\textit{NuSTAR} first observed quiet Sun regions on 2014 November 1, although\nout-of-view active regions contributed a notable amount of background in the\nform of single-bounce (unfocused) X-rays. We conducted a search for quiet Sun\ntransient brightenings on time scales of 100 s and set upper limits on emission\nin two energy bands. We set 2.5--4~keV limits on brightenings with time scales\nof 100 s, expressed as the temperature T and emission measure EM of a thermal\nplasma. We also set 10--20~keV limits on brightenings with time scales of 30,\n60, and 100 s, expressed as model-independent photon fluxes. The limits in both\nbands are well below previous HXR microflare detections, though not low enough\nto detect events of equivalent T and EM as quiet Sun brightenings seen in soft\nX-ray observations. We expect future observations during solar minimum to\nincrease the \\textit{NuSTAR} sensitivity by over two orders of magnitude due to\nhigher instrument livetime and reduced solar background.\n", "  We analyze the magnetically ordered phases in the Kondo lattice model on a\nsquare lattice around quarter filling using the dynamical mean field theory. We\nfind that close to quarter filling besides the paramagnetic phase, at least\nthree magnetic phases compete. These phases are a ferromagnetic state, a\npartial Kondo screened state, which is a combination of charge order and\nmagnetic order, and a striped magnetic phase, which is ferromagnetically\nordered in one direction and antiferromagnetically in the other direction. We\nanalyze the spectral properties of these states and show that the PKS state is\ninsulating with a flat band above the Fermi energy, while the other states are\nmetallic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the energy gain by the Kondo effect\nis larger in the PKS state, while the striped magnetic state can gain more\nenergy from the RKKY interaction. Thus, while the striped magnetic state is\nstable at weak coupling, the PKS state becomes stable at intermediate coupling.\n", "  We report the synthesis of Co2FeGa/SiO2 nanoparticles by sol-gel method and\ncharacterization using x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) and magnetic measurements. The Rietveld refinements of XRD\ndata with space group Fm-3m clearly show the formation of A2 disorder single\nphase and the lattice constant is found to be 5.738 {\\AA}. The\nenergy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirm the elemental composition\nclose the desired values. The value of coercivity is found to be around 283 Oe\nand 126 Oe, measured at 10 K and 300 K, respectively. We observed the\nsaturation magnetization significantly lower than expected from Slater-Pauling\nrule. This decrease in the magnetic moment might be due to the presence of\namorphous SiO2 during the synthesis process. A large content of small size SiO2\nparticles along with Co2FeGa nanoparticles are also found in TEM study.\n", "  We study the crossed Andreev effects in two-dimensional\nconductor/superconductor hybrid systems under a perpendicular magnetic field.\nBoth a graphene/superconductor hybrid system and an electron gas/superconductor\none are considered. It is shown that an exclusive crossed Andreev reflection,\nwith other Andreev reflections being completely suppressed, is obtained in a\nhigh magnetic field because of the chiral edge states in the quantum Hall\nregime. Importantly, the exclusive crossed Andreev reflection not only holds\nfor a wide range of system parameters, e.g., the size of system, the width of\ncentral superconductor, and the quality of coupling between the graphene and\nthe superconductor, but also is very robust against disorder. When the applied\nbias is within the superconductor gap, a robust Cooper-pair splitting process\nwith high-efficiency can be realized in this system.\n", "  As an in-house instrument developmental activity at ARIES, the 4Kx4K CCD\nImager is designed and developed as a first-light instrument for the axial port\nof the 3.6m DOT. The f/9 beam of the telescope having a plate-scale of ~ 6.4\narc-sec/mm is utilized to conduct deeper photometry within the central 10\narc-min field of view. The pixel size of the blue-enhanced liquid Nitrogen\ncooled STA4150 4Kx4K CCD chip is 15 micron, with options to select gain and\nspeed values to utilize the dynamic range. Using the Imager, it is planned to\nimage the central ~ 6.5x6.5 arc-min^2 field of view of the telescope for\nvarious science goals by getting deeper images in several broad-band filters\nfor point sources and objects with low surface brightness. The fully assembled\nImager along with automated filter wheels having Bessel UBVRI and SDSS ugriz\nfilters was tested in late 2015 at the axial port of the 3.6m DOT. This\ninstrument was finally mounted at the axial port of the 3.6m DOT on 30th March\n2016 when the telescope was technically activated jointly by the Prime\nMinisters of India and Belgium. This instrument is expected to serve as a\ngeneral purpose multi-band deep imaging instrument for variety of science goals\nincluding studies of cosmic transients, active galaxies, star clusters and\noptical monitoring of X-ray sources discovered by the newly launched Indian\nspace-mission called ASTROSAT and follow-up of radio bright objects discovered\nby the GMRT.\n", "  We present a general method for reconstruction of a network of nonlinearly\ncoupled neural fields from the observations. A prominent example of such a\nsystem is a dynamical random neural network model studied by Sompolinsky et. al\n[Phys. Rev. Lett., v. 61, 259 (1988)]. We develop a technique for inferring the\nproperties of the system from the observations of the chaotic voltages. Only\nthe structure of the model is assumed to be known, while the nonlinear gain\nfunctions of the interactions, the matrix of the coupling constants, and the\ntime constants of the local dynamics are reconstructed from the time series.\n", "  A review is given of the experimental situation and theoretical predictions\nconcerning unconventional magnetic ordering in dense Kondo 4f- and 5f-systems,\nincluding recently investigated on cerium, ytterbium, and actinide based\nternary systems. This unconventional ordering is characterized by a small\nmagnetic moment and exhibits features typical of both localized-spin and\nitinerant-electron magnets. Particular attention is paid to ferromagnetic\nsystems and the competition among different types of magnetic ordering. The\nperturbation theory method, renormalization group approach, and auxiliary\npseudofermion representation are considered as tools for describing the\nformation of the Kondo lattice ground state. The problem of non-Fermi-liquid\nbehavior is also discussed.\n", "  In the iron-based high-Tc bulk superconductors, Tc above 50K was only\nobserved in the electron-doped 1111-type compounds. Here we revisit the\nelectron-doped SmFeAsO polycrystals to make a further investigation for the\nhighest T-c in these materials. To introduce more electron carriers and less\ncrystal lattice distortions, we study the Th and F codoping effects into the\nSm-O layers with heavy electron doping. Dozens of Sm1-x Th-x FeAsO1-y F-y\nsamples are synthesized through the solid state reaction method, and these\nsamples are carefully characterized by the structural, resistive, and magnetic\nmeasurements. We find that the codoping of Th and F clearly enhances the\nsuperconducting T-c more than the Th or F single-doped samples, with the\nhighest record T-c up to 58.6K when x= 0.2 and y= 0.225. Further element doping\ncauses more impurities and lattice distortions in the samples with a weakened\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  Human migration is a type of human mobility, where a trip involves a person\nmoving with the intention of changing their home location. Predicting human\nmigration as accurately as possible is important in city planning applications,\ninternational trade, spread of infectious diseases, conservation planning, and\npublic policy development. Traditional human mobility models, such as gravity\nmodels or the more recent radiation model, predict human mobility flows based\non population and distance features only. These models have been validated on\ncommuting flows, a different type of human mobility, and are mainly used in\nmodeling scenarios where large amounts of prior ground truth mobility data are\nnot available. One downside of these models is that they have a fixed form and\nare therefore not able to capture more complicated migration dynamics. We\npropose machine learning models that are able to incorporate any number of\nexogenous features, to predict origin/destination human migration flows. Our\nmachine learning models outperform traditional human mobility models on a\nvariety of evaluation metrics, both in the task of predicting migrations\nbetween US counties as well as international migrations. In general, predictive\nmachine learning models of human migration will provide a flexible base with\nwhich to model human migration under different what-if conditions, such as\npotential sea level rise or population growth scenarios.\n", "  We report the synthesis, crystal structure, superconductivity and physical\nproperty characterizations of the ternary equiatomic compound ScRuSi.\nPolycrystalline samples of ScRuSi were prepared by an arc-melting method. The\nas-prepared samples were identified as the orthorhombic Co2P-type o-ScRuSi by\nthe powder X-ray diffraction analysis. Electrical resistivity measurement shows\no-ScRuSi to be a metal which superconducts below a Tc of 3.1 K, and the upper\ncritical field {\\mu}0Hc2(0) is estimated to be 0.87 T. The magnetization and\nspecific heat measurements confirm the bulk type-II superconductivity in\no-ScRuSi, with the specific heat jump within the BCS weak coupling limit.\no-ScRuSi is the first Co2P-type superconductor containing scandium. After\nannealing at 1273 K for a week, o-ScRuSi transforms into the hexagonal\nFe2P-type h-ScRuSi, and the latter is a Pauli-paramagnetic metal with no\nsuperconductivity observed above 1.8 K.\n", "  In this note we revisit the Kovacs effect, concerning the way in which the\nvolume of a glass-forming liquid, which has been driven out of equilibrium,\nchanges with time while the system evolves towards a metastable state. The\ntheoret- ical explanation of this phenomenon has attracted much interest even\nin recent years, because of its relation with some subtle aspects of the still\nelusive nature of the glass transition. In fact, even if there is a rather\ngeneral consensus on the fact that what is experimentally observed on cooling\nis the dramatic effect produced by the dynam- ical arrest of slower degrees of\nfreedom over the experimental time scale, it is not yet clear whether this\nphenomenology can be justified upon assuming the existence of an underlying\n(possibly, high order) phase transition at lower temperatures.\n", "  We use two different methods, the Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo simulation\nand the slave-boson mean field analysis to estimate the effect of spin-orbit\ncoupling on the Kondo temperature in a quantum wire. In quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulation, we calculate the product of spin susceptibility and temperature for\ndifferent spin-orbit couplings and impurity energies. The variation of the\nKondo temperature is estimated via the low temperature universal curves. In the\nmean field analysis, the Kondo temperature is estimated as the condensation\ntemperature of slave-boson. Both the two methods demonstrate that the Kondo\ntemperature is almost a linear function of the spin-orbit energy, and that the\nKondo temperature is suppressed by the spin-orbit coupling. Our results are\ndramatically different from those given by the perturbative renormalization\ngroup analysis.\n", "  Recently, the progression toward more exact density functional theory has\nbeen questioned, implying a need for more formal ways to systematically measure\nprogress, i.e. a path. Here I use the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and the\ndefinition of normality by Burke et al. to define a path toward exactness and\nstraying from the path by separating errors in \\r{ho} and E[\\r{ho}]. A\nconsistent path toward exactness involves minimizing both errors. Second, a\nsuitably diverse test set of trial densities \\r{ho}' can be used to estimate\nthe significance of errors in \\r{ho} without knowing the exact densities which\nare often computationally inaccessible. To illustrate this, the systems\npreviously studied by Medvedev et al., the first ionization energies of atoms\nwith Z = 1 to 10, the ionization energy of water, and the bond dissociation\nenergies of five diatomic molecules were investigated and benchmarked against\nCCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z. A test set of four functionals of distinct designs was\nused: B3LYP, PBE, M06, and S-VWN. For atomic cations regardless of charge and\ncompactness up to Z = 10, the energy effects of variations in \\r{ho} are < 4\nkJ/mol (chemical accuracy) defined here as normal, even though these four\nfunctionals ranked very differently in the previous test. Thus, the off-path\nbehavior for such cations is energy-wise insignificant and in fact,\nindeterminate because of noise from other errors. An interesting oscillating\nbehavior in the density sensitivity is observed vs. Z, explained by orbital\noccupation effects. Finally, it is shown that even large normal problems such\nas the Co-C bond energy of cobalamins can use simpler (e.g. PBE) trial\ndensities to drastically speed up computation by loss of a few kJ/mol in\naccuracy.\n", "  Skyrmions in ultrathin ferromagnetic metal (FM)/heavy metal (HM) multilayer\nsystems produced by conventional sputtering methods have recently generated\nhuge interest due to their applications in the field of spintronics. The\nsandwich structure with two correctly-chosen heavy metal layers provides an\nadditive interfacial exchange interaction which promotes domain wall or\nskyrmion spin textures that are N\\'eel in character and with a fixed chirality.\nLorentz transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a high resolution method\nideally suited to quantitatively image such chiral magnetic configurations.\nWhen allied with physical and chemical TEM analysis of both planar and\ncross-sectional samples, key length scales such as grain size and the chiral\nvariation of the magnetisation variation have been identified and measured. We\npresent data showing the importance of the grain size (mostly < 10nm) measured\nfrom direct imaging and its potential role in describing observed behaviour of\nisolated skyrmions (diameter < 100nm). In the latter the region in which the\nmagnetization rotates is measured to be around 30 nm. Such quantitative\ninformation on the multiscale magnetisation variations in the system is key to\nunderstanding and exploiting the behaviour of skyrmions for future device\napplications.\n", "  One of the important issues regarding the final evolution of stars is the\nimpact of binarity. A rich zoo of peculiar, evolved objects are born from the\ninteraction between the loosely bound envelope of a giant, and the\ngravitational pull of a companion. However, binary interactions are not\nunderstood from first principles, and the theoretical models are subject to\nmany assumptions. It is currently agreed upon that hot subdwarf stars can only\nbe formed through binary interaction, either through common envelope ejection\nor stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) near the tip of the red giant branch\n(RGB). These systems are therefore an ideal testing ground for binary\ninteraction models. With our long term study of wide hot subdwarf (sdB)\nbinaries we aim to improve our current understanding of stable RLOF on the RGB\nby comparing the results of binary population synthesis studies with the\nobserved population. In this article we describe the current model and possible\nimprovements, and which observables can be used to test different parts of the\ninteraction model.\n", "  The magnetic properties of a system of three interacting magnetic elliptical\ndiscs are examined. For the various levels of uniaxial anisotropy investigated\na complicated series of phase transitions exist. These are marked by the\ncritical lines of stability (CLS) that are demonstrated in an applied magnetic\nfield plane diagram.\n", "  Recent measurements have highlighted that spatially shaped photons travel\nslower than c, the speed of monochromatic, plane waves in vacuum. Here we\ninvestigate the intrinsic delay introduced by `twisting' a photon, i.e. by\nintroducing orbital angular momentum (OAM). In order to do this we use a\nHong-Ou-Mandel interferometer to measure the change in delay of single photons\nwhen we introduce OAM on a ring-shaped beam that is imaged through a focusing\ntelescope. Our findings show that when all other parameters are held constant\nthe addition of OAM reduces the delay (accelerates) with respect to the same\nbeam with no OAM. We support our results using a theoretical method to\ncalculate the group velocity and gain an intuitive understanding of the\nmeasured OAM acceleration by considering a geometrical ray-tracing approach.\n", "  It has been recently suggested that the nonlinear optical processes in\nplasmonic nanoantennas allow for a substantial boost in the sensitivity of\nplasmonic sensing platforms. Here we present a sensing device based on an array\nof non-centrosymmetric plasmonic nanoantennas featuring enhanced second\nharmonic generation (SHG) integrated in a microfluidic chip. We evaluate its\nsensitivity both in the linear and nonlinear regime using a figure of merit\n(FOM = $(\\Delta I/I)/\\Delta n$) that accounts for the relative change in the\nmeasured intensity, \\textit{I}, against the variation of the environmental\nrefractive index \\textit{n}. While the signal-to-noise ratio achieved in both\nregimes allows the detection of a minimum refractive index variation $\\Delta\nn_{min} \\approx 10^{-3}$, the platform operation in the nonlinear regime\nfeatures a sensitivity (i.e. the FOM) that is at least 3 times higher than the\nlinear one. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of plasmon-enhanced SHG, our\nresults show that the development of such SHG sensing platforms with\nsensitivity performances exceeding those of their linear counterparts is within\nreach.\n", "  While the Kes 73/1E 1841-045 system had been confirmed as an extended GeV\nsource, whether its morphology depends on the photon energy or not deserves our\nfurther investigation. Adopting data collected by Fermi Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) again, we look into the extensions of this source in three energy bands\nindividually: 0.3-1 GeV, 1-3 GeV and 3-200 GeV. We find that the 0.3-1 GeV\nmorphology is point-like and is quite different from those in the other two\nbands, although we cannot robustly reject a unified morphology for the whole\nLAT band.\n", "  In this seven-part paper, we show that gravitational waves (classical and\nquantum) produce the accelerated de Sitter expansion at the start and at the\nend of the cosmological evolution of the Universe. In these periods, the\nUniverse contains no matter fields but contains classical and quantum metric\nfluctuations, i.e., it is filled with classical and quantum gravitational\nwaves. In such evolution of the Universe, dominated by gravitational waves, the\nde Sitter state is the exact solution to the self-consistent equations for\nclassical and quantum gravitational waves and background geometry for the empty\nspace-time with FLRW metric. In both classical and quantum cases, this solution\nis of the instanton origin since it is obtained in the Euclidean space of\nimaginary time with the subsequent analytic continuation to real time. The\ncosmological acceleration from gravitational waves provides a transparent\nphysical explanation to the coincidence, threshold and 'old cosmological\nconstant' paradoxes of dark energy avoiding recourse to the anthropic\nprinciple. The cosmological acceleration from virtual gravitons at the start of\nthe Universe evolution produces inflation, which is consistent with the\nobservational data on CMB anisotropy. Section 1 is devoted to cosmological\nacceleration from classical gravitational waves. Section 2 is devoted to the\ntheory of virtual gravitons in the Universe. Section 3 is devoted to\ncosmological acceleration from virtual gravitons. Section 4 discusses the\nconsistency of the theory with observational data on dark energy and inflation.\nThe discussion of mechanism of acceleration and cosmological scenario are\ncontained in Sections 5 and 6. Appendix contains the theory of stochastic\nnonlinear gravitational waves of arbitrary wavelength and amplitude in an\nisotropic Universe.\n", "  A novel general purpose Finite Element framework is presented to study\nsmall-scale metal plasticity. A distinct feature of the adopted distortion\ngradient plasticity formulation, with respect to strain gradient plasticity\ntheories, is the constitutive inclusion of the plastic spin, as proposed by\nGurtin (2004) through the prescription of a free energy dependent on Nye's\ndislocation density tensor. The proposed numerical scheme is developed by\nfollowing and extending the mathematical principles established by Fleck and\nWillis (2009). The modeling of thin metallic foils under bending reveals a\nsignificant influence of the plastic shear strain and spin due to a mechanism\nassociated with the higher-order boundary conditions allowing dislocations to\nexit the body. This mechanism leads to an unexpected mechanical response in\nterms of bending moment versus curvature, dependent on the foil length, if\neither viscoplasticity or isotropic hardening are included in the model. In\norder to study the effect of dissipative higher-order stresses, the mechanical\nresponse under non-proportional loading is also investigated.\n", "  The recently proposed Hamiltonian Adaptive Resolution Scheme (H-AdResS)\nallows to perform molecular simulations in an open boundary framework. It\nallows to change on the fly the resolution of specific subset of molecules\n(usually the solvent), which are free to diffuse between the atomistic region\nand the coarse-grained reservoir. So far, the method has been successfully\napplied to pure liquids. Coupling the H-AdResS methodology to hybrid models of\nproteins, such as the Molecular Mechanics/Coarse-Grained (MM/CG) scheme, is a\npromising approach for rigorous calculations of ligand binding free energies in\nlow-resolution protein models. Towards this goal, here we apply for the first\ntime H-AdResS to two atomistic proteins in dual-resolution solvent, proving its\nability to reproduce structural and dynamic properties of both the proteins and\nthe solvent, as obtained from atomistic simulations.\n", "  In this work hydrogen diffusion towards the fracture process zone is examined\naccounting for local hardening due to geometrically necessary dislocations\n(GNDs) by means of strain gradient plasticity (SGP). Finite element\ncomputations are performed within the finite deformation theory to characterize\nthe gradient-enhanced stress elevation and subsequent diffusion of hydrogen\ntowards the crack tip. Results reveal that GNDs, absent in conventional\nplasticity predictions, play a fundamental role on hydrogen transport ahead of\na crack. SGP estimations provide a good agreement with experimental\nmeasurements of crack tip deformation and high levels of lattice hydrogen\nconcentration are predicted within microns to the crack tip. The important\nimplications of the results in the understanding of hydrogen embrittlement\nmechanisms are thoroughly discussed.\n", "  The $\\beta$-decay half-lives of $^{128\\text{--}130}$Cd have been measured\nwith the newly commissioned GRIFFIN $\\gamma$-ray spectrometer at the\nTRIUMF-ISAC facility. The time structures of the most intense $\\gamma$-rays\nemitted following the $\\beta$-decay were used to determine the half-lives of\n$^{128}$Cd and $^{130}$Cd to be $T_{1/2}= 246.2(21)$ ms and $T_{1/2}= 126(4)$\nms, respectively. The half-lives of the 3/2$^+$ and 11/2$^-$ states of\n$^{129}$Cd were measured to be $T_{1/2}(3/2^+)= 157(8)$ ms and\n$T_{1/2}(11/2^-)= 147(3)$ ms. The half-lives of the Cd isotopes around the\n$N=82$ shell closure are an important ingredient in astrophysical simulations\nto derive the magnitude of the second $r$-process abundance peak in the\n$A\\sim130$ region. Our new results are compared with recent literature values\nand theoretical calculations.\n", "  In a recent publication the importance of measuaring light clusters at future\nNICA and FAIR experiments as \"rare probes\" for in-medium characteristics was\npresented. Within theoretical conciderations is shown how clusters would be\naffected by medium affects as given collider energies.\n", "  The dynamics of drop impact on solid surfaces can be changed significantly by\ntuning the elasticity of the solid. Most prominently, the substrate deformation\ncauses an increase in the splashing threshold as compared to impact onto\nperfectly rigid surfaces, and can thus lead to splash suppression. Here, we\nexperimentally determine the splashing threshold for impact on thin membranes\nas a function of the tension in the membrane and its elastic properties. The\ndrop dynamics is correlated to the membrane deformation, which is\nsimultaneously measured using a laser profilometry technique. The experimental\nresults enable us to adapt current models for splashing, showing quantitatively\nhow substrate deformation alters the splashing threshold.\n", "  Both natural and artificial small-scale swimmers may often self-propel in\nenvironments subject to complex geometrical constraints. While most past\ntheoretical work on low-Reynolds number locomotion addressed idealised\ngeometrical situations, not much is known on the motion of swimmers in\nheterogeneous environments. As a first theoretical model, we investigate\nnumerically the behaviour of a single spherical micro-swimmer located in an\ninfinite, periodic body-centred cubic lattice consisting of rigid inert spheres\nof the same size as the swimmer. Running a large number of simulations we\nuncover the phase diagram of possible trajectories as a function of the\nstrength of the swimming actuation and the packing density of the lattice. We\nthen use hydrodynamic theory to rationalise our computational results and show\nin particular how the far-field nature of the swimmer (pusher vs. puller)\ngoverns even the behaviour at high volume fractions.\n", "  Peritrichous bacteria swim in viscous fluids by rotating multiple helical\nflagellar filaments. As the bacterium swims forward, all its flagella rotate in\nsynchrony behind the cell in a helical bundle. When the bacterium changes its\ndirection, the flagellar filaments unbundle and reorient the cell for a short\nperiod of time before returning to their bundled state and resuming swimming.\nThis rapid bundling and unbundling is, at its heart, a mechanical process\nwhereby hydrodynamic interactions balance with elasticity to determine the\ntime-varying deformation of the filaments. Inspired by this biophysical\nproblem, we present in this paper what is perhaps the simplest model of\nbundling whereby two, or more, straight elastic filaments immersed in a viscous\nfluid rotate about their centreline, inducing rotational flows which tend to\nbend the filaments around each other. We derive an integro-differential\nequation governing the shape of the filaments resulting from mechanical balance\nin a viscous fluid at low Reynolds number. We show that such equation may be\nevaluated asymptotically analytically in the long-wavelength limit, leading to\na local partial differential equation governed by a single dimensionless\nBundling number. A numerical study of the dynamics predicted by the model\nreveals the presence of two configuration instabilities with increasing\nBundling numbers: first to a crossing state where filaments touch at one point\nand then to a bundled state where filaments wrap along each other in a helical\nfashion. We next provide an intuitive physical model for the crossing\ninstability and show that it may be used to predict analytically its threshold,\nand adapted to address the transition to a bundling state. We then use a\nmacro-scale experimental implementation of the two-filament configuration in\norder to validate our theoretical predictions and obtain excellent agreement.\n", "  We present a Heisenberg-Langevin formalism to study the effective dynamics of\na superconducting qubit coupled to an open multimode resonator, without\nresorting to the rotating wave, two level, Born or Markov approximations. Our\neffective equations are derived by eliminating resonator degrees of freedom\nwhile encoding their effect in the Green's function of the electromagnetic\nbackground. We account for the openness of the resonator exactly by employing a\nspectral representation for the Green's function in terms of a set of\nnon-Hermitian modes. A well-behaved time domain perturbation theory is derived\nto systematically account for the nonlinearity of weakly nonlinear qubits like\ntransmon. We apply this method to the problem of spontaneous emission,\ncapturing accurately the non-Markovian features of the qubit dynamics, valid\nfor any qubit-resonator coupling strength. Any discrete-level quantum system\ncoupled to the electromagnetic continuum is subject to radiative decay and\nrenormalization of its energy levels. When inside a cavity, these quantities\ncan be strongly modified with respect to vacuum. Generally, this modification\ncan be captured by including only the closest resonant cavity mode. In\ncircuit-QED architecture, with substantial coupling strengths, it is however\nfound that such rates are strongly influenced by far off-resonant modes. A\nmultimode calculation over the infinite set of cavity modes leads to\ndivergences unless an artificial cutoff is imposed. Previous studies have not\npointed out what the source of this divergence is. We show that unless the\neffect of $A^2$ is accounted for up to all orders exactly, any multimode\ncalculations of circuit-QED quantities is bound to diverge. Subsequently, we\npresent the calculation of finite radiative corrections to qubit properties\nthat is free of an artificially introduced high frequency cut-off.\n", "  We reveal the mechanism of subdiffusion which emerges in a straightforward,\none dimensional classical nonequilibrium dynamics of a Brownian ratchet driven\nby both a time-periodic force and Gaussian white noise. In a tailored parameter\nset for which the deterministic counterpart is in a non-chaotic regime,\nsubdiffusion is a long-living transient whose lifetime can be many, many orders\nof magnitude larger than characteristic time scales of the setup thus being\namenable to experimental observations. As a reason for this subdiffusive\nbehaviour in the coordinate space we identify thermal noise induced dynamical\nlocalization in the velocity (momentum) space. This novel idea is distinct from\nexisting knowledge and has never been reported for any classical or quantum\nsystems. It suggests reconsideration of generally accepted opinion that\nsubdiffusion is due to road distributions or strong correlations which reflect\ndisorder, trapping, viscoelasticity of the medium or geometrical constraints.\n", "  Can live music events generate complex contagion in music streaming? This\npaper finds evidence in the affirmative, but only for the most popular artists.\nWe generate a novel dataset from Last.fm, a music tracking website, to analyse\nthe listenership history of 1.3 million users over a two-month time horizon. We\nuse daily play counts along with event attendance data to run a regression\ndiscontinuity analysis in order to show the causal impact of concert attendance\non music listenership among attendees and their friends network. First, we show\nthat attending a music artist's live concert increases that artist's\nlistenership among the attendees of the concert by approximately 1 song per day\nper attendee (p-value<0.001). Moreover, we show that this effect is contagious\nand can spread to users who did not attend the event. However, the extent of\ncontagion depends on the type of artist. We only observe contagious increases\nin listenership for well-established, popular artists (.06 more daily plays per\nfriend of an attendee [p<0.001]), while the effect is absent for emerging\nstars. We also show that the contagion effect size increases monotonically with\nthe number of friends who have attended the live event.\n", "  The emergence of preferred classical variables within a many-body\nwavefunction is encoded in its entanglement structure in the form of redundant\nclassical information shared between many spatially local subsystems. We show\nhow such structure can be generated via cosmological dynamics from the vacuum\nstate of a massless field, causing the wavefunction to branch into classical\nfield configurations on large scales. An accelerating epoch first excites the\nvacuum into a superposition of classical fields as well as a highly sensitive\nbath of squeezed super-horizon modes. During a subsequent decelerating epoch,\ngravitational interactions allow these modes to collect information about\nlonger-wavelength fluctuations. This information disperses spatially, creating\nlong-range redundant correlations in the wavefunction. The resulting classical\nobservables, preferred basis for decoherence, and system/environment\ndecomposition emerge from the translation invariant wavefunction and\nHamiltonian, rather than being fixed by hand. We discuss the role of squeezing,\nthe cosmological horizon scale, and phase information in the wavefunction, as\nwell as aspects of wavefunction branching for continuous variables and in field\ntheories.\n", "  Taken individually, magnetic monopoles and axions are both well-motivated\naspects of physics beyond the Standard Model. We demonstrate that by virtue of\nthe Witten effect, their interplay is furthermore nontrivial; monopoles break\nthe corresponding axial symmetries explicitly and result in an axion potential\nlacking the usual instanton-derived exponential suppression factor. As axions\nare distinguished by their extremely weak interactions, any regime where their\neffects are enhanced may be of interest. As an application of these findings,\nwe demonstrate that a phenomenologically acceptable population of\ngrand-unification monopoles in the early Universe can efficiently suppress both\nthe QCD axion dark matter abundance and CMB isocurvature contribution.\n", "  We present a radial velocity analysis of 20 solar neighborhood RR Lyrae and 3\nPopulation II Cepheids variables. We obtained high-resolution, moderate-to-high\nsignal-to-noise ratio spectra for most stars and obtained spectra were covering\ndifferent pulsation phases for each star. To estimate the gamma\n(center-of-mass) velocities of the program stars, we use two independent\nmethods. The first, `classic' method is based on RR Lyrae radial velocity curve\ntemplates. The second method is based on the analysis of absorption line\nprofile asymmetry to determine both the pulsational and the gamma velocities.\nThis second method is based on the Least Squares Deconvolution (LSD) technique\napplied to analyze the line asymmetry that occurs in the spectra. We obtain\nmeasurements of the pulsation component of the radial velocity with an accuracy\nof $\\pm$ 3.5 km s$^{-1}$. The gamma velocity was determined with an accuracy\n$\\pm$ 10 km s$^{-1}$, even for those stars having a small number of spectra.\nThe main advantage of this method is the possibility to get the estimation of\ngamma velocity even from one spectroscopic observation with uncertain pulsation\nphase. A detailed investigation of the LSD profile asymmetry shows that the\nprojection factor $p$ varies as a function of the pulsation phase -- this is a\nkey parameter which converts observed spectral line radial velocity variations\ninto photospheric pulsation velocities. As a byproduct of our study, we present\n41 densely-spaced synthetic grids of LSD profile bisectors that are based on\natmospheric models of RR Lyr covering all pulsation phases.\n"]}
