"abstract": ["  Recent formulation of the Zaller model of mass opinion is generalized to\ninclude the interaction between agents. The mechanism of interaction is close\nto the bounded confidence model. The outcome of the simulation is the\nprobability distribution of opinions on a given issue as dependent on the\nmental capacity of agents. Former result was that a small capacity leads to a\nstrong belief. Here we show that an intensive interaction between agents also\nleads to a consensus, accepted without doubts.\n", "  A community of agents is subject to a stream of messages, which are\nrepresented as points on a plane of issues. Messages are sent by media and by\nagents themselves. Messages from media shape the public opinion. They are\nunbiased, i.e. positive and negative opinions on a given issue appear with\nequal frequencies. In our previous work, the only criterion to receive a\nmessage by an agent is if the distance between this message and the ones\nreceived earlier does not exceed the given value of the tolerance parameter.\nHere we introduce a possibility to address a message to a given neighbour. We\nshow that this option reduces the unanimity effect, what improves the\ncollective performance.\n", "  Low-temperature MnBi (hexagonal NiAs phase) exhibits anomalies in the lattice\nconstants (a, c) and bulk elastic modulus (B) below 100 K, spin reorientation\nand magnetic susceptibility maximum near 90 K, and, importantly for\nhigh-temperature magnetic applications, an increasing coercivity (unique to\nMnBi) above 180 K. We calculate the total energy and magneto-anisotropy energy\n(MAE) versus (a, c) using DFT+U methods. We reproduce and explain all the above\nanomalies. We predict that coercivity and MAE increase due to increasing a,\nsuggesting means to improve MnBi permanent magnets.\n", "  Nitinol (NiTi), the most widely used shape-memory alloy, exhibits an\naustenite phase that has yet to be identified. The usually assumed austenite\nstructure is cubic B2, which has imaginary phonon modes, hence it is unstable.\nWe suggest a stable austenite structure that on average has B2 symmetry\n(observed by X-ray and neutron diffraction), but exhibits finite atomic\ndisplacements from the ideal B2 sites. The proposed structure has a phonon\nspectrum that agrees with that from neutron scattering, has diffraction spectra\nin agreement with XRD, and has an energy relative to the ground state that\nagrees with calorimetry data.\n", "  Understanding how sea ice melts is critical to climate projections. In the\nArctic, melt ponds that develop on the surface of sea ice floes during the late\nspring and summer largely determine their albedo -- a key parameter in climate\nmodeling. Here we explore the possibility of a conceptual sea ice climate model\npassing through a bifurcation point -- an irreversible critical threshold as\nthe system warms, by incorporating geometric information about melt pond\nevolution. This study is based on a bifurcation analysis of the energy balance\nclimate model with ice - albedo feedback as the key mechanism driving the\nsystem to bifurcation points.\n", "  The Myers-Perry black holes are higher-dimensional generalizations of the\nusual (3+1)-dimensional rotating Kerr black hole. They are of considerable\ninterest in Kaluza-Klein models, specifically within the context of brane-world\nversions thereof. In the present article we shall consider the greybody factors\nassociated with scalar field excitations of the Myers-Perry spacetimes, and\ndevelop some rigorous bounds on these greybody factors. These bounds are of\nrelevance for characterizing both the higher-dimensional Hawking radiation, and\nthe super-radiance, that is expected for these spacetimes.\n", "  Infographics are a form of data visualization combining data, information,\nand statistics. Over the last ten years, infographics have become a popular\nmethod for displaying concise information, where infographics are a useful tool\nfor classroom instruction. A high-quality infographic presents complex data in\nan aesthetically pleasing and simplistic format that allows student to\nunderstand more rapidly. Research within mathematics and climate science uses\nmany elements of infographics. This work presents a series of electronic\nposters in an infographics style which explain hot topics in the mathematics of\nclimate. These posters are designed to be used within standard undergraduate\nmathematical courses to provide students with concrete examples of how\nmathematics is incorporated within the climate sciences.\n", "  We calculate negative moments of the $N$-dimensional Laguerre distribution\nfor the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic symmetries. These moments\ncorrespond to those of the proper delay times, which are needed to determine\nthe statistical fluctuations of several transport properties through\nclassically chaotic cavities, like quantum dots and microwave cavities with\nideal coupling.\n", "  Is the Hawking flux \"thermal\"? Unfortunately, the answer to this seemingly\ninnocent question depends on a number of often unstated, but quite crucial,\ntechnical assumptions built into modern (mis-)interpretations of the word\n\"thermal\". The original 1850's notions of thermality --- based on classical\nthermodynamic reasoning applied to idealized \"black bodies\" or \"lamp black\nsurfaces\" --- when supplemented by specific basic quantum ideas from the early\n1900's, immediately led to the notion of the black-body spectrum, (the\nPlanck-shaped spectrum), but \"without\" any specific assumptions or conclusions\nregarding correlations between the quanta. Many (not all) modern authors (often\nimplicitly and unintentionally) add an extra, and quite unnecessary, assumption\nthat there are no correlations in the black-body radiation; but such usage is\nprofoundly ahistorical and dangerously misleading. Specifically, the Hawking\nflux from an evaporating black hole, (just like the radiation flux from a leaky\nfurnace or a burning lump of coal), is only \"approximately\" Planck-shaped over\na bounded frequency range. Standard physics (phase space and adiabaticity\neffects) explicitly bound the frequency range over which the Hawking flux is\n\"approximately\" Planck-shaped from both above and below --- the Hawking flux is\ncertainly not exactly Planckian, and there is no compelling physics reason to\nassume the Hawking photons are uncorrelated.\n", "  NiTi is the most used shape-memory alloy, nonetheless, a lack of\nunderstanding remains regarding the associated structures and transitions,\nincluding their barriers. Using a generalized solid-state nudge elastic band\n(GSSNEB) method implemented via density-functional theory, we detail the\nstructural transformations in NiTi relevant to shape memory: those between\nbody-centered orthorhombic (BCO) groundstate and a newly identified stable\naustenite (\"glassy\" B2-like) structure, including energy barriers (hysteresis)\nand intermediate structures (observed as a kinetically limited R-phase), and\nbetween martensite variants (BCO orientations). All results are in good\nagreement with available experiment. We contrast the austenite results to those\nfrom the often-assumed, but unstable B2. These high- and low-temperature\nstructures and structural transformations provide much needed atomic-scale\ndetail for transitions responsible for NiTi shape-memory effects.\n", "  The nudged-elastic band (NEB) method is modified with concomitant two\nclimbing images (C2-NEB) to find a transition state (TS) in complex energy\nlandscapes, such as those with serpentine minimal energy path (MEP). If a\nsingle climbing image (C1-NEB) successfully finds the TS, C2-NEB finds it with\nhigher stability and accuracy. However, C2-NEB is suitable for more complex\ncases, where C1-NEB misses the TS because the MEP and NEB directions near the\nsaddle point are different. Generally, C2-NEB not only finds the TS but\nguarantees that the climbing images approach it from the opposite sides along\nthe MEP, and it estimates accuracy from the three images: the highest-energy\none and its climbing neighbors. C2-NEB is suitable for fixed-cell NEB and the\ngeneralized solid-state NEB (SS-NEB).\n", "  In this paper, we propose to use the decoy-state technique to improve the\nsecurity of the quantum key distribution (QKD) systems based on homodyne\ndetection against the photon number splitting (PNS) attack. The decoy-state\ntechnique is a powerful tool that can significantly boost the secure\ntransmission range of the QKD systems. However it has not yet been applied to\nthe systems that use coherent detection. After adapting this theory to the\nsystems based on homodyne detection, we quantify the secure performance and\ntransmission range of the resulting system.\n", "  The coexistence pressure of two phases is a well-defined point at fixed\ntemperature. In experiment, however, due to non-hydrostatic stresses and a\nstress-dependent potential energy barrier, different measurements yield\ndifferent ranges of pressure with a hysteresis. Accounting for these effects,\nwe propose an inequality for comparison of the theoretical value to a plurality\nof measured intervals. We revisit decades of pressure experiments on the bcc -\nhcp transformations in iron, which are sensitive to non-hydrostatic conditions\nand sample size. From electronic-structure calculations, we find a bcc - hcp\ncoexistence pressure of 8.4 GPa. We construct the equation of state for\ncompeting phases under hydrostatic pressure, compare to experiments and other\ncalculations, and address the observed pressure hysteresis and range of onset\npressures of the nucleating phase.\n", "  Spectroscopic analysis of large biomolecules is critical in a number of\napplications, including medical diagnostics and label-free biosensing.\nRecently, it has been shown that Raman spectroscopy of proteins can be used to\ndiagnose some diseases, including a few types of cancer. These experiments have\nhowever been performed using traditional Raman spectroscopy and the development\nof the Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) assays suitable for large\nbiomolecules could lead to a substantial decrease in the amount of specimen\nnecessary for these experiments. We present a new method to achieve high local\nfield enhancement in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy through the\nsimultaneous adjustment of the lattice plasmons and localized surface plasmon\npolaritons, in a periodic bilayer nanoantenna array resulting in a high\nenhancement factor over the sensing area, with relatively high uniformity. The\nproposed plasmonic nanostructure is comprised of two interacting nanoantenna\nlayers, providing a sharp band-edge lattice plasmon mode and a wide-band\nlocalized surface plasmon for the separate enhancement of the pump and emitted\nRaman signals. We demonstrate the application of the proposed nanostructure for\nthe spectral analysis of large biomolecules by binding a protein (streptavidin)\nselectively on the hot-spots between the two stacked layers, using a low\nconcentration solution (100 nM) and we successfully acquire its SERS spectrum.\n", "  In a universe where, according to the standard cosmological models, some 97%\nof the total mass-energy is still \"missing in action\" it behooves us to spend\nat least a little effort critically assessing and exploring radical\nalternatives. Among possible, (dare we say plausible), nonstandard but\nsuperficially viable models, those spacetimes conformal to the standard\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker class of cosmological models play a very\nspecial role --- these models have the unique and important property of\npermitting large non-perturbative geometric deviations from\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology without unacceptably distorting\nthe cosmic microwave background. Performing a \"cosmographic\" analysis, (that\nis, temporarily setting aside the Einstein equations, since the question of\nwhether or not the Einstein equations are valid on galactic and cosmological\nscales is essentially the same question as whether or not dark matter/dark\nenergy actually exist), and using both supernova data and information about\ngalactic structure, one can nevertheless place some quite significant\nobservational constraints on any possible conformal mode --- however there is\nstill an extremely rich range of phenomenological possibilities for both\ncosmologists and astrophysicists to explore.\n", "  A rapid, or prompt response, of an electromagnetic nature, is found in an\nelastic wave scattering experiment. The experiment is performed with torsional\nelastic waves in a quasi-one-dimensional cavity with one port, formed by a\nnotch grooved at a certain distance from the free end of a beam. The stationary\npatterns are diminished using a passive vibration isolation system at the other\nend of the beam. The measurement of the resonances is performed with\nnon-contact electromagnetic-acoustic transducers outside the cavity. In the\nArgand plane, each resonance describes a circle over a base impedance curve\nwhich comes from the electromagnetic components of the equipment. A model,\nbased on a variation of Poisson's kernel is developed. Excellent agreement\nbetween theory and experiment is obtained.\n", "  We diagonalize Q-operators for rational homogeneous sl(2)-invariant\nHeisenberg spin chains using the algebraic Bethe ansatz. After deriving the\nfundamental commutation relations relevant for this case from the Yang-Baxter\nequation we demonstrate that the Q-operators act diagonally on the Bethe\nvectors if the Bethe equations are satisfied. In this way we provide a direct\nproof that the eigenvalues of the Q-operators studied here are given by\nBaxter's Q-functions.\n", "  We extend the solid-state nudged elastic band method to handle a\nnon-conserved order parameter - in particular, magnetization, that couples to\nvolume and leads to many observed effects in magnetic systems. We apply this\nformalism to the well-studied magneto-volume collapse during the\npressure-induced transformation in iron - from ferromagnetic body-centered\ncubic (bcc) austenite to hexagonal close-packed (hcp) martensite. We find a\nbcc-hcp equilibrium coexistence pressure of 8.4 GPa, with the transition-state\nenthalpy of 156 meV/Fe at this pressure. A discontinuity in magnetization and\ncoherent stress occurs at the transition state, which has a form of a cusp on\nthe potential-energy surface (yet all the atomic and cell degrees of freedom\nare continuous); the calculated pressure jump of 25 GPa is related to the\nobserved 25 GPa spread in measured coexistence pressures arising from\nmartensitic and coherency stresses in samples. Our results agree with\nexperiments, but necessarily differ from those arising from drag and restricted\nparametrization methods having improperly constrained or uncontrolled degrees\nof freedom.\n", "  The Hawking flux from a black hole, (at least as seen from asymptotic\ninfinity), is extremely sparse and thin, with the average time between emission\nof the successive Hawking quanta being many times larger than the natural\ntimescale set by the energies of the emitted quanta. While this result has been\nknown for over 30 years, it has largely been forgotten. We shall focus on the\nearly-stage low-temperature regime, and shall confront numerical estimates with\nsemi-analytic approximations based on a naive Planck spectrum. First we shall\nidentify several natural dimensionless figures of merit, and thereby compare\nthe mean time between emission of successive Hawking quanta to several distinct\nbut quite natural timescales that can be associated with the emitted quanta,\ndemonstrating that very large ratios are typical for emission of massless\nquanta from a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore these ratios are\nindependent of the mass of the black hole as it slowly evolves. We shall then\nshow that the situation for the more general Reissner-Nordstrom and generic\n\"dirty'' black holes is even worse, at least as long as the surrounding matter\nsatisfies some suitable energy conditions. The situation for the Kerr and\nKerr--Newman black holes (or even for charged particle emission from a\nReissner--Nordstrom black hole) is considerably trickier, and depends on a\ncareful accounting of the super-radiant modes. Overall, the Hawking quanta are\nseen to be dribbling out of the black hole one at a time, in an extremely slow\ncascade of 2-body decays. Among other things, this implies that the Hawking\nflux is subject to \"shot noise''. Observationally, the Planck spectrum of the\nHawking flux can only be determined by collecting and integrating data over a\nvery long timescale. We conclude by connecting these points back to various\nkinematic aspects of the Hawking evaporation process.\n", "  A metric projective structure is a manifold equipped with the unparametrised\ngeodesics of some pseudo-Riemannian metric. We make acomprehensive treatment of\nsuch structures in the case that there is a projective Weyl curvature nullity\ncondition. The analysis is simplified by a fundamental and canonical 2-tensor\ninvariant that we discover. It leads to a new canonical tractor connection for\nthese geometries which is defined on a rank $(n+1)$-bundle. We show this\nconnection is linked to the metrisability equations that govern the existence\nof metrics compatible with the structure. The fundamental 2-tensor also leads\nto a new class of invariant linear differential operators that are canonically\nassociated to these geometries; included is a third equation studied by Gallot\net al.\n  We apply the results to study the metrisability equation, in the nullity\nsetting described. We obtain strong local and global results on the nature of\nsolutions and also on the nature of the geometries admitting such solutions,\nobtaining classification results in some cases. We show that closed Sasakian\nand K\\\"ahler manifold do not admit nontrivial solutions. We also prove that, on\na closed manifold, two nontrivially projectively equivalent metrics cannot have\nthe same tracefree Ricci tensor. We show that on a closed manifold a metric\nhaving a nontrivial solution of the metrisablity equation cannot have\ntwo-dimensional nullity space at every point. In these statements the meaning\nof trivial solution is dependent on the context.\n  There is a function $B$ naturally appearing if a metric projective structure\nhas nullity. We analyse in detail the case when this is not a constant, and\ndescribe all nontrivially projectively equivalent Riemannian metrics on closed\nmanifolds with nonconstant $B$.\n", "  This work proposes deuteronated PAH (DPAH+ ) molecules as a potential carrier\nof the 4.4 and 4.65 {\\mu}m mid infrared emission bands that have been\nobservationally detected towards the Orion and M17 regions. Density Functional\nTheory calculations have been carried out on DPAH+ molecules to see the\nvariations in the spectral behaviour from that of a pure PAH. DPAH+ molecules\nshow features that arise due to the stretching of the aliphatic C-D bond.\nDeuterated PAHs have been previously reported as carriers for such features.\nHowever, preferred conditions of ionization of PAHs in the interstellar medium\n(ISM) indicates the possibility of the formation of DPAH+ molecules. Comparison\nof band positions of DPAH+ s shows reasonable agreement with the observations.\nWe report the effect of size of the DPAH+ molecules on band positions and\nintensities. This study also reports a D/H ratio ([D/H]sc ; the ratio of C-D\nstretch and C-H stretch bands per [D/H]num ) that is decreasing with the\nincreasing size of DPAH+ s. It is noted that large DPAH+ molecules (no. of C\natoms ~ 50) match the D/H ratio that has been estimated from observations. This\nratio offers prospects to study the deuterium abundance and depletion in the\nISM.\n", "  Contrary to praxis, we provide an analytical expression, for a physical\nlocally periodic structure, of the average $\\langle S\\rangle$ of the scattering\nmatrix, called optical $S$ matrix in the nuclear physics jargon, and\nfundamentally present in all scattering processes. This is done with the help\nof a strictly analogous nonlinear dynamical mapping where iteration time is the\nnumber $N$ of scatterers. The ergodic property of chaotic attractors implies\nthe existence and analyticity of $\\langle S\\rangle$. We find that the optical\n$S$ matrix depends only on the transport properties of a single cell, and that\nthe Poisson kernel is the distribution of the scattering matrix $S_N$ in the\nlarge size limit $N\\rightarrow \\infty$. The theoretical distribution shows\nperfect agreement with numerical results for a chain of delta potentials. A\nconsequence of our findings is the a priori knowledge of $\\langle S\\rangle$\nwithout resort to experimental data.\n", "  We find solutions $E:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}^3$ of the problem \\begin{eqnarray*}\n  \\left\\{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  &\\nabla\\times(\\mu(x)^{-1}\\nabla\\times E) - \\omega^2\\epsilon(x) E = \\partial_E\nF(x,E) &&\\quad \\text{in }\\Omega\\\\%\\newline\n  &\\nu\\times E = 0 &&\\quad \\text{on }\\partial\\Omega\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\right. \\end{eqnarray*} on a bounded Lipschitz domain\n$\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3$ with exterior normal\n$\\nu:\\partial\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}^3$. Here $\\nabla\\times$ denotes the curl\noperator in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The equation describes the propagation of the\ntime-harmonic electric field $\\Re\\{E(x)e^{i\\omega t}\\}$ in an anisotropic\nmaterial with a magnetic permeability tensor $\\mu(x)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times3}$\nand a permittivity tensor $\\epsilon(x)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times3}$. The boundary\nconditions are those for $\\Omega$ surrounded by a perfect conductor. It is\nrequired that $\\mu(x)$ and $\\epsilon(x)$ are symmetric and positive definite\nuniformly for $x\\in\\Omega$, and that $\\mu,\\epsilon\\in\nL^{\\infty}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times 3})$. The nonlinearity\n$F:\\Omega\\times\\mathbb{R}^3\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is superquadratic and subcritical in\n$E$, the model nonlinearity being of Kerr-type: $F(x,E)=|\\Gamma(x)E|^p$ for\nsome $2<p<6$ with $\\Gamma(x)\\in GL(3)$ invertible for every $x\\in\\Omega$ and\n$\\Gamma,\\Gamma^{-1}\\in L^\\infty(\\Omega, \\mathbb{R}^{3\\times 3})$. We prove the\nexistence of a ground state solution and of bound states if $F$ is even in $E$.\nMoreover if the material is uniaxial we find two types of solutions with\ncylindrical symmetries.\n", "  Lecture script of a one-semester course that aims to develop an understanding\nand appreciation of fundemental concepts in modern physics for students who are\ncomfortable with calculus. This document contains the first six lessons that\nwill walk you through the special theory of relativity.\n", "  In this paper, we report large-scale configuration interaction (CI)\ncalculations of linear optical absorption spectra of various isomers of\nmagnesium clusters Mg$_{n}$ (n=2--5), corresponding to valence transitions.\nGeometry optimization of several low-lying isomers of each cluster was carried\nout using coupled-cluster singles doubles (CCSD) approach, and these geometries\nwere subsequently employed to perform ground and excited state calculations\nusing either the full-CI (FCI) or the multi-reference singles-doubles\nconfiguration interaction (MRSDCI) approach, within the frozen-core\napproximation. Our calculated photoabsorption spectrum of magnesium dimer\n(Mg$_{2}$) isomer is in excellent agreement with the experiments both for peak\npositions, and intensities. Owing to the sufficiently inclusive\nelectron-correlation effects, these results can serve as benchmarks against\nwhich future experiments, as well as calculations performed using other\ntheoretical approaches, can be tested.\n", "  As titanium is a highly utilized metal for structural light-weighting, its\nphases, transformation pathways (transition states), and structures have\nscientific and industrial importance. Impurities, pressure, and temperature\ncontrol the phase stability and transition barriers in most industrial and\ngeophysical materials - in Ti, interstitial O, N, or C retard while\nsubstitutional Al and V suppress the $\\omega$ phase. Using a proper solid-state\nnudged elastic band (SS-NEB) method employing double-climbing images (C2-NEB)\ncombined with density-function theory (DFT+U) methods for accurate energetics,\nwe detail the pressure-induced $\\alpha$ (ductile) to $\\omega$ (brittle)\ntransformation at the coexistence pressure. We find two transition states along\nthe minimal-enthalpy path (MEP) and discover a metastable body-centered\northorhombic (bco) structure, with stable phonons, a lower density than the\nendpoint phases, and decreasing stability with increasing pressure.\n", "  The vibrational properties of two-dimensional phononic crystals are studied\nwith large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and finite element method\ncalculation. The vibrational band structure derived from the molecular dynamics\nsimulations shows the existence of partial acoustic band gaps along the\n$\\Gamma$-M direction. The band structure is in excellent agreement with the\nresults from the finite element model, proving that molecular dynamics\nsimulations can be used to study the vibrational properties of such complex\nsystems. An analysis of the structure of the vibrational modes reveals how the\nacoustic modes deviate from the homogeneous bulk behaviour for shorter\nwavelengths and hints towards a decoupling of vibrations in the phononic\ncrystal.\n", "  Burning something, (e.g. the proverbial lump of coal, or an encyclopaedia for\nthat matter), in a blackbody furnace leads to an approximately Planck emission\nspectrum with an average entropy/information transfer of approximately $3.9 \\pm\n2.5$ bits per emitted photon. This quantitative and qualitative result depends\nonly on the underlying unitarity of the quantum physics of burning, combined\nwith the statistical mechanics of blackbody radiation. The fact that the\nutterly standard and unitarity preserving process of burning something (in\nfact, burning anything) nevertheless *has* an associated entropy/information\nbudget, and the quantitative *size* of that entropy/information budget, is a\nseverely under-appreciated feature of standard quantum statistical physics.\n", "  By an inductive reasoning, and based on recent results of the joint moments\nof proper delay times of open chaotic systems for ideal coupling to leads, we\nobtain a general expression for the distribution of the partial delay times for\nan arbitrary number of channels and any symmetry. This distribution was not\ncompletely known for all symmetry classes. Our theoretical distribution is\nverified by random matrix theory simulations of ballistic chaotic cavities.\n", "  We discuss the most general Finsler spacetime geometry obeying the\ncosmological symmetry group $\\mathrm{SO}(4)$. On this background geometry we\nderive the equations of motion for the most general kinetic fluid obeying the\nsame cosmological symmetry. For this purpose we propose a set of coordinates on\nthe tangent bundle of the spacetime manifold which greatly simplifies the\ncosmological symmetry generators.\n", "  Cosmological hysteresis, has interesting and vivid implications in the\nscenario of a cyclic bouncy universe. This, purely thermodynamical in nature,\nis caused by the asymmetry in the equation of state parameter during expansion\nand contraction phase of the universe, due to the presence of a single scalar\nfield. When applied to variants of modified gravity models this phenomenon\nleads to the increase in amplitude of the consecutive cycles of the universe,\nprovided we have physical mechanisms to make the universe bounce and\nturnaround. This also shows that the conditions which creates a universe with\nan ever increasing expansion, depend on the signature of $\\oint pdV$ and on\nmodel parameters.\n", "  We investigate whether a spontaneously-broken gauge theory of the group\n$SU(2,2)$ may be a genuine competitor to General Relativity. The basic\ningredients of the theory are an $SU(2,2)$ gauge field $A_{\\mu}$ and a Higgs\nfield $W$ in the adjoint representation of the group with the Higgs field\nproducing the symmetry breaking $SU(2,2)\\rightarrow SO(1,3)\\times SO(1,1)$. The\naction for gravity is polynomial in $\\{A_{\\mu},W\\}$ and the field equations are\nfirst-order in derivatives of these fields. The new $SO(1,1)$ symmetry in the\ngravitational sector is interpreted in terms of an emergent scale symmetry and\nthe recovery of conformalized General Relativity and fourth-order Weyl\nconformal gravity as limits of the theory- following imposition of Lagrangian\nconstraints- is demonstrated. Maximally symmetric spacetime solutions to the\nfull theory are found and stability of the theory around these solutions is\ninvestigated; it is shown that regions of the theory's parameter space describe\nperturbations identical to that of General Relativity coupled to a massive\nscalar field and a massless one-form field. The coupling of gravity to matter\nis considered and it is shown that actions for all fields are naturally\ngauge-invariant, polynomial in fields and yield first-order field equations; no\nauxiliary fields are introduced. Familiar Yang-Mills and Klein-Gordon type\nLagrangians are recovered on-shell in the General-Relativistic limit of the\ntheory. In this formalism, the General-Relativistic limit and the breaking of\nscale invariance appear as two sides of the same coin and it is shown that the\nlatter generates mass terms for Higgs and spinor fields.\n", "  The predicted Lense-Thirring perihelion precession of Mercury induced by the\nSun's angular momentum through its general relativistic gravitomagnetic field\namounts to 2 milliarcseconds per century. It turned out to be compatible with\nthe latest experimental determinations of the supplementary perihelion\nprecession of Mercury with the INPOP15a ephemerides, whose accuracy level has\nnowadays reached the magnitude of the predicted relativistic effect itself\nthanks to the analysis of some years of tracking data of the MESSENGER\nspacecraft, which orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015. A dedicated analysis of\nthree years of MESSENGER data with the DE ephemerides allowed for a $25\\%$\ndetermination of the Sun's angular momentum by means of the Lense-Thirring\neffect, which turned out to be highly correlated with the signature due to the\nSolar quadrupole mass moment $J_2^{\\odot}$.\n", "  Under normal circumstances most members of the general relativity community\nfocus almost exclusively on the local properties of spacetime, such as the\nlocally Euclidean structure of the manifold and the Lorentzian signature of the\nmetric tensor. When combined with the classical Einstein field equations this\ngives an extremely successful empirical model of classical gravity and\nclassical matter --- at least as long as one does not ask too many awkward\nquestions about global issues, (such as global topology and global causal\nstructure). We feel however that this is a tactical error --- even without\ninvoking full-fledged \"quantum gravity\" we know that the standard model of\nparticle physics is also an extremely good representation of some parts of\nempirical reality; and we had better be able to carry over all the good\nfeatures of the standard model of particle physics --- at least into the realm\nof semi-classical quantum gravity. Doing so gives us some interesting global\nfeatures that spacetime should possess: On physical grounds spacetime should be\nspace-orientable, time-orientable, and spacetime-orientable, and it should\npossess a globally defined tetrad (vierbein, or in general a globally defined\nvielbein/n-bein). So on physical grounds spacetime should be parallelizable.\nThis strongly suggests that the metric is not the fundamental physical\nquantity; a very good case can be made for the tetrad being more fundamental\nthan the metric. Furthermore, a globally-defined \"almost complex structure\" is\nalmost unavoidable. Ideas along these lines have previously been mooted, but\nmuch is buried in the pre-arXiv literature and is either forgotten or\ninaccessible. We shall revisit these ideas taking a perspective very much based\non empirical physical observation.\n", "  During the transition from solar cycle 23 to 24 from 2006 to 2009, the Sun\nwas in an unusual solar minimum with very low activity over a long period.\nThese exceptional conditions included a very low interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) strength and a high tilt angle, which both play an important role in the\nmodulation of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) in the heliosphere. Thus, the radial\nand latitudinal gradients of GCRs are very much expected to depend not only on\nthe solar magnetic epoch, but also on the overall modulation level. We\ndetermine the non-local radial and the latitudinal gradients of protons in the\nrigidity range from ~0.45 to 2 GV. This was accomplished by using data from the\nsatellite-borne experiment Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and\nLight-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) at Earth and the Kiel Electron Telescope\n(KET) onboard Ulysses on its highly inclined Keplerian orbit around the Sun\nwith the aphelion at Jupiter's orbit. In comparison to the previous A>0 solar\nmagnetic epoch, we find that the absolute value of the latitudinal gradient is\nlower at higher and higher at lower rigidities. This energy dependence is\ntherefore a crucial test for models that describe the cosmic ray transport in\nthe inner heliosphere.\n", "  We consider the quantum vertex algebra associated with the double Yangian in\ntype A as defined by Etingof and Kazhdan. We show that its center is a\ncommutative associative algebra and construct algebraically independent\nfamilies of topological generators of the center at the critical level.\n", "  We present a derivation of the kinetic equation describing the secular\nevolution of spatially inhomogeneous systems with long-range interactions, the\nso-called inhomogeneous Landau equation, by relying on a functional integral\nformalism. We start from the BBGKY hierarchy derived from the Liouville\nequation. At the order ${1/N}$, where $N$ is the number of particles, the\nevolution of the system is characterised by its 1-body distribution function\nand its 2-body correlation function. Introducing associated auxiliary fields,\nthe evolution of these quantities may be rewritten as a traditional functional\nintegral. By functionally integrating over the 2-body autocorrelation, one\nobtains a new constraint connecting the 1-body DF and the auxiliary fields.\nWhen inverted, this constraint allows us to obtain the closed non-linear\nkinetic equation satisfied by the 1-body distribution function. This derivation\nprovides an alternative to previous methods, either based on the direct\nresolution of the truncated BBGKY hierarchy or on the Klimontovich equation. It\nmay turn out to be fruitful to derive more accurate kinetic equations, e.g.,\naccounting for collective effects, or higher order correlation terms.\n", "  Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been long proposed to be\na major carrier of 'Unidentified Infrared' (UIR) emission bands that have been\nobserved ubiquitously in various astrophysical environments. These molecules\ncan potentially be an efficient reservoir of deuterium. Once the infrared\nproperties of the deuterium- containing PAHs are well understood both\nexperimentally and theoretically, the interstellar UIR bands can be used as a\nvaluable tool to infer the cause of the deuterium depletion in the ISM.\n  Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out on\ndeuterium-containing ovalene variants to study the infrared properties of these\nmolecules. These include deuterated ovalene, cationic deuterated ovalene,\ndeuteronated ovalene and deuterated-deuteronated ovalene. We present a D/H\nratio calculated from our theoretical study to compare with the observationally\nproposed D/H ratio.\n", "  We study the spatial distribution of the density of states (DOS) at zero bias\nN(r) in the mixed state of single and multigap superconductors. We provide an\nanalytic expression for N(r) based on deGennes' relation between DOS and the\norder parameter that reproduces well Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) data\nin several superconducting materials. In the single gap superconductor\n$\\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, we find that N(r) is governed by a length scale\n$\\xi_H=\\sqrt{\\phi_0/2\\pi H}$, which decreases in rising fields. The vortex core\nsize $\\cal C$, defined via the slope of the order parameter at the vortex\ncenter, $\\cal C$ $\\propto (d \\Delta /dr |_{r \\to 0})^{-1}$, differs from\n$\\xi_H$ by a material dependent numerical factor. For two gap superconductors\n2H-NbSe$_{1.8}$S$_{0.2}$ and 2H-NbS$_2$, we find that $\\cal C$ is field\nindependent and has the same value for both bands. We conclude that,\nindependently of the magnetic field induced variation of the order parameter\nvalues in both bands, the spatial variation of the order parameter close to the\nvortex core is the same for all bands.\n", "  We present a brief derivation of the kinetic equation describing the secular\nevolution of point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics, by relying on a\nfunctional integral formalism. We start from Liouville's equation which\ndescribes the exact dynamics of a two-dimensional system of point vortices. At\nthe order ${1/N}$, the evolution of the system is characterised by the first\ntwo equations of the BBGKY hierarchy involving the system's 1-body distribution\nfunction and its 1-body correlation function. Thanks to the introduction of\nauxiliary fields, these two evolution constraints may be rewritten as a\nfunctional integral. When functionally integrated over the 2-body correlation\nfunction, this rewriting leads to a new constraint coupling the 1-body\ndistribution function and the two auxiliary fields. Once inverted, this\nconstraint provides, through a new route, the closed non-linear kinetic\nequation satisfied by the 1-body distribution function. Such a method sheds new\nlights on the origin of these kinetic equations complementing the traditional\nderivation methods.\n", "  We initiate a mathematical analysis of hidden effects induced by binning\nspike trains of neurons. Assuming that the original spike train has been\ngenerated by a discrete Markov process, we show that binning generates a\nstochastic process which is not Markov any more, but is instead a Variable\nLength Markov Chain (VLMC) with unbounded memory. We also show that the law of\nthe binned raster is a Gibbs measure in the DLR (Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle)\nsense coined in mathematical statistical mechanics. This allows the derivation\nof several important consequences on statistical properties of binned spike\ntrains. In particular, we introduce the DLR framework as a natural setting to\nmathematically formalize anticipation, i.e. to tell \"how good\" our nervous\nsystem is at making predictions. In a probabilistic sense, this corresponds to\ncondition a process by its future and we discuss how binning may affect our\nconclusions on this ability. We finally comment what could be the consequences\nof binning in the detection of spurious phase transitions or in the detection\nof wrong evidences of criticality.\n", "  We suggest to study the $B_{s}$ and its excitations $B_{sJ}$ in the $B_c$\ndecays. We calculate the $B_c\\to B_{sJ}$ and $B_c\\to B_{J}$ form factors within\nthe covariant light-front quark model, where the $B_{sJ}$ and $B_{J}$ denote an\ns-wave or p-wave $\\bar bs$ and $\\bar bd$ meson, respectively. The form factors\nat $q^2=0$ are directly computed while their $q^2$-distributions are obtained\nby the extrapolation. The derived form factors are then used to study\nsemileptonic $B_c\\to (B_{sJ},B_{J})\\bar\\ell\\nu$ decays, and nonleptonic $B_c\\to\nB_{sJ}\\pi$. Branching fractions and polarizations are predicted in the standard\nmodel. We find that the branching fractions are sizable and might be accessible\nat the LHC experiment and future high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders with a high\nluminosity at the $Z$-pole. The future experimental measurements are helpful to\nstudy the nonperturbative QCD dynamics in the presence of a heavy spectator and\nalso of great value for the spectroscopy study.\n", "  On the basis of quasipotential approach in quantum electrodynamics we\ncalculate vacuum polarization and quadrupole corrections in first and second\norders of perturbation theory in hyperfine structure of P-states in muonic\ndeuterium. All corrections are presented in integral form and evaluated\nanalytically and numerically. The obtained results can be used for the\nimprovement of the transition frequencies between levels 2P and 2S.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the boson/vortex duality by mapping the (3+1)D\nGross-Pitaevskii theory into an effective string theory in the presence of\nboundaries. Via the effective string theory, we find the Seiberg-Witten map\nbetween the commutative and the noncommutative tachyon field theories, and\nconsequently identify their soliton solutions with $D$-branes in the effective\nstring theory. We perform various checks of the duality map and the\nidentification of soliton solutions. This new insight between the\nGross-Pitaevskii theory and the effective string theory explains the similarity\nof these two systems at quantitative level.\n", "  Solar prominences are magnetic structures incarcerating cool and dense gas in\nan otherwise hot solar corona. Prominences can be categorized as quiescent and\nactive. Their origin and the presence of cool gas (~$10^4$K) within the hot\n(~$10^6$K) solar corona remains poorly understood. The structure and dynamics\nof solar prominences was investigated in a large number of observational and\ntheoretical (both analytical and numerical) studies. In this paper, an analytic\nmodel of quiescent solar prominence is developed and used to demonstrate that\nthe prominence velocity increases exponentially, which means that some gas\nfalls downward towards the solar surface, and that Alfven waves are naturally\npresent in the solar prominences. These theoretical predictions are consistent\nwith the current observational data of solar quiescent prominences.\n", "  We construct the action of the q-deformed W-algebra on its level r\nrepresentation geometrically, using the moduli space of U(r) instantons on the\nplane and the double shuffle algebra. We give an explicit LDU decomposition for\nthe action of W-algebra currents in the fixed point basis of the level r\nrepresentation, and prove a relation between the Carlsson-Okounkov Ext operator\nand intertwiners for the deformed W-algebra. We interpret this result as a\nq-deformed version of the AGT-W relations.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalized representation of a\n$3$-Lie algebra, by which we obtain a generalized semidirect product $3$-Lie\nalgebra. Moreover, we develop the corresponding cohomology theory. Various\nexamples of generalized representations of 3-Lie algebras and computation of\n2-cocycles of the new cohomology are provided. Also, we show that a split\nabelian extension of a 3-Lie algebra is isomorphic to a generalized semidirect\nproduct $3$-Lie algebra. Furthermore, we describe general abelian extensions of\n3-Lie algebras using Maurer-Cartan elements.\n", "  The search for time-harmonic solutions of nonlinear Maxwell equations in the\nabsence of charges and currents leads to the elliptic equation\n$$\\nabla\\times\\left(\\mu(x)^{-1} \\nabla\\times u\\right) - \\omega^2\\varepsilon(x)u\n= f(x,u)$$ for the field $u:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}^3$ in a domain\n$\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3$. Here $\\varepsilon(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3\\times3}$ is\nthe (linear) permittivity tensor of the material, and $\\mu(x) \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times3}$ denotes the magnetic permeability tensor. The\nnonlinearity $f:\\Omega\\times\\mathbb{R}^3\\to\\mathbb{R}^3$ comes from the\nnonlinear polarization. If $f=\\nabla_uF$ is a gradient then this equation has a\nvariational structure. The goal of this paper is to give an introduction to the\nproblem and the variational approach, and to survey recent results on ground\nand bound state solutions. It also contains refinements of known results and\nsome new results.\n", "  We have grown the MoAs$_2$ single crystal which crystallizes in a monoclinic\nstructure with C2/m space group. Transport measurements show that MoAs$_2$\ndisplays a metallic behavior at zero field and undergoes a\nmetal-to-semiconductor crossover at low temperatures when the applied magnetic\nfield is over 5 T. A robust resistivity plateau appears below 18 K and persists\nfor the field up to 9 T. A large positive magnetoresistance (MR), reaching\nabout 2600\\% at 2 K and 9 T, is observed when the field is perpendicular to the\ncurrent.The MR becomes negative below 40 K when the field is rotated to be\nparallel to the current. The Hall resistivity shows the non-linear\nfield-dependence below 70 K. The analysis using two-band model indicates a\ncompensated electron-hole carrier density at low temperatures. A combination of\nthe breakdown of Kohler's rule, the abnormal drop and the cross point in Hall\ndata implies that a possible Lifshitz transition has occurred between 30 K and\n60 K, likely driving the compensated electron-hole density, the large MR as\nwell as the metal-semiconductor transition in MoAs$_2$. Our results indicate\nthat the family of centrosymmetric transition-metal dipnictides has rich\ntransport behavior which can in general exhibit variable metallic and\ntopological features.\n", "  This progress report covers recent developments in the area of quantum\nrandomness, which is an extraordinarily interdisciplinary area that belongs not\nonly to physics, but also to philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and\ntechnology. For this reason the article contains three parts that will be\nessentially devoted to different aspects of quantum randomness, and even\ndirected, although not restricted, to various audiences: a philosophical part,\na physical part, and a technological part. For these reasons the article is\nwritten on an elementary level, combining very elementary and non-technical\ndescriptions with a concise review of more advanced results. In this way\nreaders of various provenances will be able to gain while reading the article.\n", "  We take advantage of a recently established equivalence, between the\nintermittent dynamics of a deterministic nonlinear map and the scattering\nmatrix properties of a disorderless double Cayley tree lattice of connectivity\n$K$, to obtain general electronic transport expressions and expand our\nknowledge of the scattering properties at the mobility edge. From this we\nprovide a physical interpretation of the generalized localization length.\n", "  Motivated by the successes of relativistic theories in studies of\natomic/molecular and nuclear systems and the need for a relativistic chiral\nforce in relativistic nuclear structure studies, we explore a new relativistic\nscheme to construct the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the framework of\ncovariant chiral effective field theory. The chiral interaction is formulated\nup to leading order with covariant power counting and a Lorentz invariant\nchiral Lagrangian. We find that the relativistic scheme induces all six spin\noperators needed to describe the nuclear force. A detailed investigation of the\npartial wave potentials shows a better description of the $^1S_0$ and $^3P_0$\nphase shifts than the leading order Weinberg approach, and similar to that of\nthe next-to-leading order Weinberg approach. For the other partial waves with\nangular momenta $J\\geq 1$, the relativistic results are almost the same as\ntheir leading order non-relativistic counterparts.\n", "  We study a description of the large N limit of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)\nmodel in terms of quantum mechanics without quenched disorder. Instead of\nrandom couplings, we introduce massive scalar fields coupled to fermions, and\nstudy a small mass limit of the theory. We show that, under a certain\ncondition, the correlation functions of fermions reproduce those of the SYK\nmodel with a temperature dependent coupling constant in the large N limit. We\nalso discuss a supersymmetric generalization of our quantum mechanical model.\nAs a byproduct, we develop an efficient way of estimating the large N behavior\nof correlators in the SYK model.\n", "  Recently proposed exceptional field theories (EFTs) making manifest the\nduality $E_{n(n)}$ symmetry, first observed as nonlinearly realized symmetries\nof the maximal $d=3,4,...,9$ supergravity ($n=11-d$) and containing 11D and\ntype IIB supergravity as sectors, were formulated in enlarged spacetimes. In\nthe case of $E_{7(7)}$ EFT such an enlarged spacetime can be identified with\nthe bosonic body of the $d=4$ central charge superspace $\\Sigma^{(60|32)}$, the\n${\\cal N}=8$ $d=4$ superspace completed by 56 additional bosonic coordinates\nassociated to central charges of the maximal $d=4$ supersymmetry algebra.\n  In this paper we show how the hypothesis on the relation of all the known\n$E_{n(n)}$ EFTs, including $n=8$, with supersymmetry leads to the conjecture on\nexistence of 11D exceptional field theory living in 11D tensorial central\ncharge superspace $\\Sigma^{(528|32)}$ and underlying all the $E_{n(n)}$ EFTs\nwith $n=2,...,8$, and probably the double field theory (DFT). We conjecture the\npossible form of the section conditions of such an 11D EFT and show that quite\ngeneric solutions of these can be generated by superparticle models the ground\nstates of which preserve from one half to all but one supersymmetry. The\nproperties of these superparticle models are briefly discussed. We argue that,\nupon quantization, their quantum states should describe free massless\nnon-conformal higher spin fields in D=11.\n  We also discuss some relevant representations of the M-theory superalgebra\nwhich, in the present context, describes supersymmetry of the 11D EFT.\n", "  Based on the first-principles calculations, we theoretically propose\ntopologically non-trivial states in a recently experimentally discovered\nsuperconducting material CaSn$_3$. When the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is\nignored, the material is a host to three-dimensional topological nodal-line\nsemimetal states. Drumhead like surface states protected by the coexistence of\ntime-reversal and mirror symmetry emerge within the two-dimensional regions of\nthe surface Brillouin zone connecting the nodal lines. When SOC is included,\nunexpectedly, each nodal line evolves into two Weyl nodes (W1, W2) in this\ncentrosymmetric material. Berry curvature calculations show that these nodes\noccur in a pair and act as either a source or sink of Berry flux. The material\nalso has unique surface states in the form of Fermi arcs, which unlike other\nknown Weyl semimetal, form closed loops of surface states on the Fermi surface.\nOur theoretical realization of topologically non-trivial states in a\nsuperconducting material paves the way towards unraveling the interconnection\nbetween topological physics and superconductivity.\n", "  We develop the formal tools needed to construct helicity amplitudes for\nmassive gravitino in N=1 SUGRA. We start by considering the helicity states for\nmassive spin-3/2 particles, which involves the solutions of Rarita-Schwinger\nequation. These solutions are written in terms of the helicity bra-ket notation\nand are used then to derive the interactions of gravitino with matter and gauge\nsupermultiplets within N=1 Supergravity. The corresponding interactions of\ngoldstinos are discussed too, relying on the goldstino-gravitino equivalence\ntheorem. Finally to appreciate the power of our methods we evaluate the decay\nwidth chi_0 -> \\gamma G, as well as the cross sections for e^+ e- -> GG.\n", "  Relativistic nuclear response theory is formulated for the proton-neutron\npairing, or deuteron transfer, channel. The approach is based on the\nmeson-nucleon Lagrangian of Quantum Hadrodynamics (QHD) and advances the\nrelativistic field theory to connect consistently the high-energy scale of\nheavy mesons, the medium-energy range of the pion and the low-energy domain of\nemergent collective vibrations (phonons) in a parameter-free way. Mesons and\nphonons build up the in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction in spin-isospin\ntransfer channels, in particular, the phonon-exchange part takes care of the\nleading-order retardation effects. In this framework, we explore $J^{\\pi} =\n0^+$ and $J^{\\pi} = 1^+$ channels of the nuclear response to the proton-neutron\npair removal and addition in $^{56}$Ni and $^{100}$Sn with a special focus on\nthe lowest (soft) modes as precursors of deuteron condensate and candidates for\nbeing the mediators of the proton-neutron pairing interaction.\n", "  It is common to use Galilean rotational transformation to investigate the\nUnruh effect for uniformly rotating observers. However, the rotating observer\nin this subject is an eccentric observer while Galilean rotational\ntransformation is only valid for centrally rotating observers. Thus, the\nreliability of the results of applying Galilean rotational transformation to\nthe study of the Unruh effect might be considered as questionable. In this work\nthe rotational analog of the Unruh effect is investigated by employing two\nrelativistic rotational transformations corresponding to the eccentric rotating\nobserver, and it is shown that in both cases the detector response function is\nnon-zero. It is also shown that although consecutive Lorentz transformations\ncan not give a frame within which the canonical construction can be carried\nout, the expectation value of particle number operator in canonical approach\nwill be zero if we use modified Franklin transformation. These conclusions\nreinforce the claim that correspondence between vacuum states defined via\ncanonical field theory and a detector is broken for rotating observers. Some\nprevious conclusions are commented on and some controversies are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Recent high energy CERN LHC experiments on transverse momenta distributions\nof produced particles seem to show the existence of some (small but persistent)\nlog-periodic oscillation in the ratios $R = \\sigma_{data}\\left(\np_T\\right)/\\sigma_{fit}\\left( p_T\\right)$. We argue that they can provide us\nwith so far unnoticed information on the production process, which can be\ninterpreted as the presence of some kind of sound waves formed during the\ncollision process in the bulk of the produced high density matter.\n", "  The third law of thermodynamics in the form of the unattainability principle\nstates that exact ground-state cooling requires infinite resources. Here we\ninvestigate the amount of non-equilibrium resources needed for approximate\ncooling. We consider as resource any system out of equilibrium, allowing for\nresources beyond the i.i.d. assumption and including the input of work as a\nparticular case. We establish in full generality a sufficient and a necessary\ncondition for cooling and show that for a vast class of non-equilibrium\nresources these two conditions coincide, providing a single necessary and\nsufficient criterion. Such conditions are expressed in terms of a single\nfunction playing a similar role for the third law to the one of the free energy\nfor the second law. From a technical point of view we provide new results about\nconcavity/convexity of certain Renyi-divergences, which might be of independent\ninterest.\n", "  Vortex-split sudden stratospheric warmings (S-SSWs) are investigated by using\nthe Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), a spherical barotropic\nquasi-geostrophic (QG) model, and equilibrium statistical mechanics. The QG\nmodel reproduces well the evolution of the composite potential vorticity (PV)\nfield obtained from JRA-55 by considering a time-dependent effective topography\ngiven by the composite height field of the 550 K potential temperature surface.\nThe zonal-wavenumber-2 component of the effective topography is the most\nessential feature required to observe the vortex splitting. The\nstatistical-mechanics theory predicts a large-scale steady state as the most\nprobable outcome of turbulent stirring, and such a state can be computed\nwithout solving the QG dynamics. The theory is applied to a disk domain, which\nis modeled on the north polar cap in the stratosphere. The equilibrium state is\nobtained by computing the maximum of an entropy functional. In the range of\nparameters relevant to the winter stratosphere, this state is anticyclonic. By\ncontrast, cyclonic states are quasi-stationary states corresponding to saddle\npoints of the entropy functional. The theoretical calculations are compared\nwith the results of the quasi-static experiment in which the wavenumber-2\ntopographic amplitude is increased linearly and slowly with time. The results\nsuggest that S-SSWs can be qualitatively interpreted as the transition from the\ncyclonic quasi-stationary state toward the anticyclonic equilibrium state. The\npolar vortex splits during the transition toward the equilibrium state. Without\nany forcing such as radiative cooling, the anticyclonic equilibrium state would\nbe realized sufficiently after an S-SSW.\n", "  Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) solar flare emissions evolve in time as the\nemitting plasma heats and then cools. Although accurately modeling this\nevolution has been historically difficult, especially for empirical\nrelationships, it is important for understanding processes at the Sun, as well\nas for their influence on planetary atmospheres. With a goal to improve\nempirical flare models, a new simple empirical expression is derived to predict\nhow cool emissions will evolve based on the evolution of a hotter emission.\nThis technique is initially developed by studying 12 flares in detail observed\nby the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO). Then, over 1100 flares observed by EVE are analyzed to validate these\nrelationships. The Cargill and Enthalpy Based Thermal Evolution of Loops\n(EBTEL) flare cooling models are used to show that this empirical relationship\nimplies the energy radiated by a population of hotter formed ions is\napproximately proportional to the energy exciting a population of cooler formed\nions emitting when the peak formation temperatures of the two lines are up to\n72% of each other and above 2 MK. These results have practical implications for\nimproving flare irradiance empirical modeling and for identifying key emission\nlines for future monitoring of flares for space weather operations; and also\nprovide insight into the cooling processes of flare plasma.\n", "  Massive and massless potentials play an essential role in the perturbative\nformulation of particle interactions. Many difficulties arise due to the\nindefinite metric in gauge theoretic approaches, or the increase with the spin\nof the UV dimension of massive potentials. All these problems can be evaded in\none stroke: modify the potentials by suitable terms that leave unchanged the\nfield strengths, but are not polynomial in the momenta. This feature implies a\nweaker localization property: the potentials are \"string-localized\". In this\nsetting, several old issues can be solved directly in the physical Hilbert\nspace of the respective particles: We can control the separation of helicities\nin the massless limit of higher spin fields and conversely we recover massive\npotentials with 2s+1 degrees of freedom by a smooth deformation of the massless\npotentials (\"fattening\"). We construct stress-energy tensors for massless\nfields of any helicity (thus evading the Weinberg-Witten theorem). We arrive at\na simple understanding of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity\nconcerning, e.g., the distinction between a massless or a very light graviton.\nFinally, the use of string-localized fields opens new perspectives for\ninteracting quantum field theories with, e.g., vector bosons or gravitons.\n", "  Recently a cubic Galileon cosmological model was derived by the assumption\nthat the field equations are invariant under the action of point\ntransformations. The cubic Galileon model admits a second conservation law\nwhich means that the field equations form an integrable system. The analysis of\nthe critical points for this integrable model is the main subject of this work.\nTo perform the analysis, we work on dimensionless variables different from that\nof the Hubble normalization. New critical points are derived while the\ngravitational effects which follow from the cubic term are studied.\n", "  We study vortex lattices (VLs) in superconducting weak-pinning platelet-like\ncrystals of $\\beta$-Bi$_{2}$Pd in tilted fields with a Scanning Tunneling\nMicroscope. We show that vortices exit the sample perpendicular to the surface\nand are thus bent beneath the surface. The structure and orientation of tilted\nVL in the bulk are, for large tilt angles, strongly affected by Coulomb-type\nintervortex repulsion at the surface due to stray fields.\n", "  We study the ground-state phase diagram of two-dimensional two-component (or\npseudospin-1/2) Bose gases in a high synthetic magnetic field in the space of\nthe total filling factor and the ratio of the intercomponent coupling\n$g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}$ to the intracomponent one $g>0$. Using exact\ndiagonalization, we find that when the intercomponent coupling is attractive\n($g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}<0$), the product states of a pair of nearly\nuncorrelated quantum Hall states are remarkably robust and persist even when\n$|g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}|$ is close to $g$. This contrasts with the case of an\nintercomponent repulsion, where a variety of spin-singlet quantum Hall states\nwith high intercomponent entanglement emerge for $g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}\\approx\ng$. We interpret this marked dependence on the sign of $g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}$\nin light of pseudopotentials on a sphere, and also explain recent numerical\nresults in two-component Bose gases in mutually antiparallel magnetic fields\nwhere a qualitatively opposite dependence on the sign of\n$g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}$ is found. Our results thus unveil an intriguing\nconnection between multicomponent quantum Hall systems and quantum spin Hall\nsystems in minimal setups.\n", "  We present pySecDec, a new version of the program SecDec, which performs the\nfactorisation of dimensionally regulated poles in parametric integrals, and the\nsubsequent numerical evaluation of the finite coefficients. The algebraic part\nof the program is now written in the form of python modules, which allow a very\nflexible usage. The optimization of the C++ code, generated using FORM, is\nimproved, leading to a faster numerical convergence. The new version also\ncreates a library of the integrand functions, such that it can be linked to\nuser-specific codes for the evaluation of matrix elements in a way similar to\nanalytic integral libraries.\n", "  We compute cosmological perturbations for a generic self-gravitating media\ndescribed by four derivatively- coupled scalar fields. Depending on the\ninternal symmetries of the action for the scalar fields, one can describe\nperfect fluids, superfluids, solids and supersolids media. Symmetries dictate\nboth dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the media. Generically, scalar\nperturbations include, besides the gravitational potential, an additional\nnon-adiabatic mode associated with the entropy per particle {\\sigma}. While\nperfect fluids and solids are adiabatic with {\\sigma} constant in time,\nsuperfluids and supersolids feature a non-trivial dynamics for {\\sigma}.\nSpecial classes of isentropic media with zero {\\sigma} can also be found.\nTensor modes become massive for solids and supersolids. Such an effective\napproach can be used to give a very general and symmetry driven modelling of\nthe dark sector.\n", "  In topological semimetals, the valence band and conduction band meet at\nzero-dimensional nodal points or one-dimensional nodal rings, which are\nprotected by band topology and symmetries. In this Rapid Communication, we\nintroduce \"nodal-link semimetals\", which host linked nodal rings in the\nBrillouin zone. We put forward a general recipe based on the Hopf map for\nconstructing models of nodal-link semimetal. The consequences of nodal ring\nlinking in the Landau levels and Floquet properties are investigated.\n", "  The generalized Chaplygin gas cosmology provides a prime example for the\nclass of unified dark matter models, which substitute the two dark components\nof the standard cosmological LCDM concordance model by a single dark component.\nThe equation of state of the generalized Chaplygin gas is characterised by a\nparameter alpha such that the standard LCDM model is recovered in the case\nalpha=0 with respect to the background dynamics and the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) statistics. This allows to investigate the concordance of\ndifferent cosmological data sets with respect to alpha. We compare the\nsupernova data of the Supernova Cosmology Project, the data of the baryon\noscillation spectroscopic survey (BOSS) of the third Sloan digital sky survey\n(SDSS-III) and the CMB data of the Planck 2015 data release. The importance of\nthe BOSS Lyman alpha forest BAO measurements is investigated. It is found that\nthese data sets possess a common overlap of the confidence domains only for\nChaplygin gas cosmologies very close to the LCDM model.\n", "  Pulsars have at least two impressive applications. First, they can be used as\nhighly accurate clocks, comparable in stability to atomic clocks; secondly, a\nsmall subset of pulsars, millisecond X-ray pulsars, provide all the necessary\ningredients for a passive galactic positioning system. This is known in\nastronautics as X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV). XNAV is comparable to\nGPS, except that it operates on a galactic scale. I propose a SETI-XNAV\nresearch program to test the hypothesis that this pulsar positioning system\nmight be an instance of galactic-scale engineering by extraterrestrial beings\n(section 4). The paper starts by exposing the basics of pulsar navigation\n(section 2), continues with a critique of the rejection of the extraterrestrial\nhypothesis when pulsars were first discovered (section 3). The core section 4\nproposes lines of inquiry for SETI-XNAV, related to: the pulsar distribution\nand power in the galaxy; their population; their evolution; possible pulse\nsynchronizations; pulsar usability when navigating near the speed of light;\ndecoding galactic coordinates; directed panspermia; and information content in\npulses. Even if pulsars are natural, they are likely to be used as standards by\nETIs in the galaxy (section 5). I discuss possible objections and potential\nbenefits for humanity, whether the research program succeeds or not (section\n6).\n", "  Structural, electronic, ferroelectric, and optical properties of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) BiN monolayer material with phosphorene-like structure are\nstudied in terms of the density functional theory and modern Berry phase\nferroelectric method. Both phonon spectra and molecular dynamics simulations\nindicate that the BiN monolayer is a room-temperature stable 2D ferroelectric\nwith polarization as large as 580 pC/m. Further studies show that the\npolarization in the BiN monolayer can be easily switched from [100] to [010]\ndirection over the bridging saddle phase by applying a tensile [010] stress of\n2.54 N/m or compressive [100] stress of -1.18 N/m. This phase transition makes\nits lattice constants vary in a large range compared to other non-ferroelectric\n2D materials. Moreover, through applying uniaxial tensile stress parallel to\nthe polarization, one can fix the polarization and change the semiconductor\nenergy gap from direct to indirect one. The optical properties feature a very\nstrong anisotropy in reflectivity below the photon energy of 4 eV. All these\nsignificant ferroelectric, electronic, and optical properties make us believe\nthat the 2D BiN monolayer can be used to make stretchable electronic devices\nand optical applications.\n", "  Among dynamical modeling techniques, the made-to-measure (M2M) method for\nmodeling steady-state systems is among the most flexible, allowing\nnon-parametric distribution functions in complex gravitational potentials to be\nmodeled efficiently using N-body particles. Here we propose and test various\nimprovements to the standard M2M method for modeling observed data, illustrated\nusing the simple setup of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. We demonstrate\nthat nuisance parameters describing the modeled system's orientation with\nrespect to the observer---e.g., an external galaxy's inclination or the Sun's\nposition in the Milky Way---as well as the parameters of an external\ngravitational field can be optimized simultaneously with the particle weights.\nWe develop a method for sampling from the high-dimensional uncertainty\ndistribution of the particle weights. We combine this in a Gibbs sampler with\nsamplers for the nuisance and potential parameters to explore the uncertainty\ndistribution of the full set of parameters. We illustrate our M2M improvements\nby modeling the vertical density and kinematics of F-type stars in Gaia DR1.\nThe novel M2M method proposed here allows full probabilistic modeling of\nsteady-state dynamical systems, allowing uncertainties on the non-parametric\ndistribution function and on nuisance parameters to be taken into account when\nconstraining the dark and baryonic masses of stellar systems.\n", "  The Shannon entropy in the atomic, molecular and chemical physics context is\npresented by using as test cases the hydrogenic-like atoms $H_c$, ${He_c}^+$\nand ${Li_c}^{2+}$ confined by an impenetrable spherical box. Novel expressions\nfor entropic uncertainty relation and Shannon entropies $S_r$ and $S_p$ are\nproposed to ensure their physical dimensionless characteristic. The electronic\nground state energy and the quantities $S_r$, $S_p$ and $S_t$ are calculated\nfor the hydrogenic-like atoms to different confinement radii by using a\nvariational method. The global behavior of these quantities and different\nconjectures are analyzed. The results are compared, when available, with those\npreviously published.\n", "  The use of Eulerian 'standard perturbation theory' to describe mass assembly\nin the early universe has traditionally been limited to modes with k $\\lesssim$\n0.1 h/Mpc at z = 0. At larger k the SPT power spectrum deviates from\nmeasurements made using N-body simulations. Recently, there has been progress\nin extending the reach of perturbation theory to larger k using ideas borrowed\nfrom effective field theory. We revisit the computation of the redshift-space\nmatter power spectrum within this framework, including for the first time the\nfull one-loop time dependence. We use a resummation scheme proposed by Vlah et\nal. to account for damping of baryonic acoustic oscillations due to large-scale\nrandom motions and show that this has a significant effect on the multipole\npower spectra. We renormalize by comparison to a suite of custom N-body\nsimulations matching the MultiDark MDR1 cosmology. At z = 0 and for scales k\n$\\lesssim$ 0.4 h/Mpc we find that the EFT furnishes a description of the\nreal-space power spectrum up to $\\sim$2%, for the $\\ell$ = 0 mode up to\n$\\sim$5%, and for the $\\ell$ = 2, 4 modes up to $\\sim$25%. We argue that, in\nthe MDR1 cosmology, positivity of the $\\ell$ = 0 mode gives a firm upper limit\nof k $\\approx$ 0.75 h/Mpc for the validity of the one-loop EFT prediction in\nredshift space using only the lowest-order counterterm. We show that replacing\nthe one-loop growth factors by their Einstein-de Sitter counterparts is a good\napproximation for the $\\ell$ = 0 mode, but can induce deviations as large as 2%\nfor the $\\ell$ = 2, 4 modes. An accompanying software bundle, distributed under\nopen source licenses, includes Mathematica notebooks describing the\ncalculation, together with parallel pipelines capable of computing both the\nnecessary one-loop SPT integrals and the effective field theory counterterms.\n", "  Correlations between spacelike separated measurements on entangled quantum\nsystems are stronger than any classical correlations and are at the heart of\nnumerous quantum technologies. In practice, however, spacelike separation is\noften not guaranteed and we typically face situations where measurements have\nan underlying time order. Here we aim to provide a fair comparison of classical\nand quantum models of temporal correlations on a single particle, as well as\ntimelike-separated correlations on multiple particles. We use a causal modeling\napproach to show, in theory and experiment, that quantum correlations\noutperform their classical counterpart when allowed equal, but limited\ncommunication resources. This provides a clearer picture of the role of quantum\ncorrelations in timelike separated scenarios, which play an important role in\nfoundational and practical aspects of quantum information processing.\n", "  In this contribution we report a recently developed Anomalous-Viscous Fluid\nDynamics (AVFD) framework, which simulates the evolution of fermion currents in\nQGP on top of the bulk expansion from data-validated VISHNU hydrodynamics. With\nreasonable estimates of initial conditions and magnetic field lifetime, the\npredicted CME signal is quantitatively consistent with change separation\nmeasurements in 200GeV Au-Au collisions at RHIC. We further develop the\nevent-by-event AVFD simulations that allow direct evaluation of two-particle\ncorrelations arising from CME signal as well as the non-CME backgrounds.\nFinally we report predictions from AVFD simulations for the upcoming isobaric\n(Ru-Ru v.s. Zr-Zr ) collisions that could provide the critical test of the CME\nin heavy ion collisions.\n", "  The entanglement entropy in clean, as well as in random quantum spin chains\nhas a logarithmic size-dependence at the critical point. Here, we study the\nentanglement of composite systems that consist of a clean and a random part,\nboth being critical. In the composite, antiferromagnetic XX-chain with a sharp\ninterface, the entropy is found to grow in a double-logarithmic fashion ${\\cal\nS}\\sim \\ln\\ln(L)$, where $L$ is the length of the chain. We have also\nconsidered an extended defect at the interface, where the disorder penetrates\ninto the homogeneous region in such a way that the strength of disorder decays\nwith the distance $l$ from the contact point as $\\sim l^{-\\kappa}$. For\n$\\kappa<1/2$, the entropy scales as ${\\cal S}(\\kappa) \\simeq (1-2\\kappa){\\cal\nS}(\\kappa=0)$, while for $\\kappa \\ge 1/2$, when the extended interface defect\nis an irrelevant perturbation, we recover the double-logarithmic scaling. These\nresults are explained through strong-disorder RG arguments.\n", "  In the framework of the quasipotential method in quantum electrodynamics we\ncalculate the contribution of pseudoscalar mesons to the interaction operator\nof a muon and a proton in muonic hydrogen atom. The parametrization of the\ntransition form factor of two photons into $\\pi$, $\\eta$ mesons, based on the\nexperimental data on the transition form factors and QCD asymptotics is used.\nNumerical estimates of the contributions to the hyperfine structure of the\nspectrum of the S and P levels are presented.\n", "  Linear perturbation of general relativistic accretion of low angular momentum\nhydrodynamic fluid onto a Kerr black hole leads to the formation of curved\nacoustic geometry embedded within the background flow. Characteristic features\nof such sonic geometry depend on the black hole spin. Such dependence can be\nprobed by studying the correlation of the acoustic surface gravity $\\kappa$\nwith the Kerr parameter $a$. The $\\kappa - a$ relationship further gets\ninfluenced by the geometric configuration of the accretion flow structure. In\nthis work, such influence has been studied for multitransonic shocked accretion\nwhere linear perturbation of general relativistic flow profile leads to the\nformation of two analogue black hole type horizons formed at the sonic points\nand one analogue white hole type horizon which is formed at the shock location\nproducing divergent acoustic surface gravity. Dependence of the $\\kappa - a$\nrelationship on the geometric configuration has also been studied for\nmonotransonic accretion, over the entire span of the Kerr parameter including\nretrograde flow. For accreting astrophysical black holes, the present work thus\ninvestigates how the salient features of the embedded relativistic sonic\ngeometry may be determined not only by the background space-time, but also by\nthe flow configuration of the embedding matter.\n", "  A novel design of large bandwidth, fabrication tolerant, CMOS-compatible\ncompact tapers (15 um) have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated in\nsilicon-on-insulator. The proposed taper along with linear grating couplers for\nspot-size conversion exhibits no degradation in the coupling efficiency\ncompared to a standard focusing grating in 1550 nm band. A single taper design\nhas a broadband operation over 600 nm that can be used in O, C and L-band. The\nproposed compact taper is highly tolerant to fabrication variations; 80 nm\nchange in the taper width and 200 nm in end waveguide width varies the taper\ntransmission by <0.4 dB. The footprint of the device i.e. taper along with the\nlinear gratings is ~ 250 {\\mu}m2; this is 20X smaller than the adiabatic taper\nand 2X smaller than the focusing grating coupler.\n", "  [Abridged] In its standard formulation, the $f(T)$ field equations are not\ninvariant under local Lorentz transformations, and thus the theory does not\ninherit the causal structure of special relativity. A locally Lorentz covariant\n$f(T)$ gravity theory has been devised recently, and this local causality\nproblem has been overcome. The nonlocal question, however, is left open. If\ngravitation is to be described by this covariant $f(T)$ gravity theory there\nare a number of issues that ought to be examined in its context, including the\nquestion as to whether its field equations allow homogeneous G\\\"odel-type\nsolutions, which necessarily leads to violation of causality on nonlocal scale.\nHere, to look into the potentialities and difficulties of the covariant $f(T)$\ntheories, we examine whether they admit G\\\"odel-type solutions. We take a\ncombination of a perfect fluid with electromagnetic plus a scalar field as\nsource, and determine a general G\\\"odel-type solution, which contains special\nsolutions in which the essential parameter of G\\\"odel-type geometries, $m^2$,\ndefines any class of homogeneous G\\\"odel-type geometries. We extended to the\ncontext of covariant $f(T)$ gravity a theorem, which ensures that any\nperfect-fluid homogeneous G\\\"odel-type solution defines the same set of G\\\"odel\ntetrads $h_A^{~\\mu}$ up to a Lorentz transformation. We also shown that the\nsingle massless scalar field generates G\\\"odel-type solution with no closed\ntimelike curves. Even though the covariant $f(T)$ gravity restores Lorentz\ncovariance of the field equations and the local validity of the causality\nprinciple, the bare existence of the G\\\"odel-type solutions makes apparent that\nthe covariant formulation of $f(T)$ gravity does not preclude non-local\nviolation of causality in the form of closed timelike curves.\n", "  We have surveyed the core regions of the z = 1.46 cluster XCS J2215.9-1738\nwith the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the MUSE-GALACSI\nspectrograph on the VLT. We obtained high spatial resolution observations with\nALMA of the 1.2 mm dust continuum and molecular gas emission in the central\nregions of the cluster. These observations detect 14 significant millimetre\nsources in a region with a projected diameter of just ~500kpc (~1'). For six of\nthese galaxies we also obtain 12 CO(2-1) and 12 CO(5-4) line detections,\nconfirming them as cluster members, and a further five of our millimetre\ngalaxies have archival 12CO(2-1) detections which also place them in the\ncluster. An additional two millimetre galaxies have photometric redshifts\nconsistent with cluster membership, although neither show strong line emission\nin the MUSE spectra. This suggests that the bulk (> 11/14, ~80%) of the\nsubmillimetre sources in the field are in fact luminous infrared galaxies lying\nwithin this young cluster. We then use our sensitive new observations to\nconstrain the dust-obscured star formation activity and cold molecular gas\nwithin this cluster. We find hints that the cooler dust and gas components\nwithin these galaxies may have been influenced by their environment reducing\nthe gas reservoir available for their subsequent star formation. We also find\nthat these actively star- forming galaxies have the dynamical masses and\nstellar population ages expected for the progenitors of massive, early-type\ngalaxies in local clusters potentially linking these populations.\n", "  The analytical method of QCD running coupling constant is extended to a model\nwith an all-order beta function which is inspired by the famous\nNovikov-Shifman-Vai\\-n\\-s\\-htein-Zakharov beta function of N=1 supersymmetric\ngau\\-g\\-e theories. In the approach presented here, the running coupling is\ndetermined by a transcendental equation with non-elementary integral of the\nrunning scale $\\mu$. In our approach $\\alpha_{an}(0)$, which reads 0.30642,\ndoes not rely on any dimensional parameters. This is in accordance with results\nin the literature on the analytical method of QCD running coupling constant.\nThe new \"analytically im\\-p\\-roved\" running coupling constant is also\ncompatible with the property of asymptotic freedom.\n", "  Classical point particles in Newtonian gravity obey, as they do in general\nrelativity, the universality of free fall. However classical structured\nparticles, (for instance with a mass quadrupole moment), need not obey the\nuniversality of free fall. Quantum mechanically, an elementary \"point\" particle\n(in the particle physics sense) can be described by a localized wave-packet,\nfor which we can define a probability quadrupole moment. This probability\nquadrupole can, under plausible hypotheses, affect the universality of free\nfall. (So point-like elementary particles, in the particle physics sense, can\nand indeed must nevertheless have structure in the general relativistic sense\nonce wave-packet effects are included.) This raises an important issue of\nprinciple, as possible quantum violations of the universality of free fall\nwould fundamentally impact on our ideas of what \"quantum gravity\" might look\nlike. I will present an estimate of the size of the effect, and discuss where\nif at all it might be measured.\n", "  Electrons at relativistic speeds, diffusing in magnetic fields, cause copious\nemission at radio frequencies in both clusters of galaxies and radio galaxies,\nthrough the non-thermal radiation emission called synchrotron. However, the\ntotal power radiated through this mechanism is ill constrained, as the lower\nlimit of the electron energy distribution, or low-energy cutoffs, for radio\nemission in galaxy clusters and radio galaxies have not yet been determined.\nThis lower limit, parametrized by the lower limit of the electron momentum -\npmin - is critical for estimating the energetics of non-thermal electrons\nproduced by cluster mergers or injected by radio galaxy jets, which impacts the\nformation of large-scale structure in the universe, as well as the evolution of\nlocal structures inside galaxy clusters. The total pressure due to the\nrelativistic, non-thermal population of electrons is critically dependent on\npmin, making the measurement of this non-thermal pressure a promising technique\nto estimate the electron low-energy cutoff. We present here the first\nunambiguous detection of this pressure for a non-thermal population of\nelectrons in a radio galaxy jet/lobe, located at a significant distance away\nfrom the center of the Bullet cluster of galaxies.\n", "  We present a microscopic derivation of the space charge limited current for\nthe motion of non-relativistic charged particles inside a parallel vacuum tube\ndiode taking into account the radiation reaction force. We study the space\ncharged limited current for two different limiting cases. Our results reveal\nthat in the low field regime the space charge current does not follow the\nChild-Langmuir law, while in the high field regime the space charge current\nfollows the Child-Langmuir law with and effective electrostatic field, i.e. the\nso called modified Child-Langmuir law.\n", "  We demonstrate that the selective equal spin Andreev reflection (SESAR)\nspectroscopy can be used in STM experiments to distinguish the zero-energy\nMajorana quasiparticles from the ordinary fermionic states of the Rashba chain.\nSuch technique, designed for probing the p-wave superconductivity, could be\napplied to the intersite pairing of equal-spin electrons in the chain of\nmagnetic Fe atoms deposited on the superconducting Pb substrate. Our\ncalculations of the effective pairing amplitude for individual spin components\nimply the magnetically polarized Andreev conductance, which can be used to\n`filter' the Majorana quasiparticles from the ordinary in-gap states, although\nthe pure spin current (i.e., perfect polarization) is impossible.\n", "  We find the complete phase diagram of a generalised XY model that includes\nhalf-vortices. The model possesses superfluid, pair-superfluid and disordered\nphases, separated by Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transitions for both the\nhalf-vortices and ordinary vortices, as well as an Ising-type transition. There\nalso occurs an unusual deconfining phase transition, where the disordered to\nsuperfluid transition is of Ising rather than KT type. We show by analytical\narguments and extensive numerical simulations that there is a point in the\nphase diagram where the KT transition line meets the deconfining Ising phase\ntransition. We find that the latter extends into the disordered phase not as a\nphase transition, but rather solely as a deconfinement transition. It is best\nunderstood in the dual height model, where on one side of the transition height\nsteps are bound into pairs while on the other they are unbound. We also extend\nthe phase diagram of the dual model, finding both O(2) loop model and\nantiferromagnetic Ising transitions.\n", "  As a collective quasiparticle excitation of the magnetic order in magnetic\nmaterials, spin wave, or magnon when quantized, can propagate in both\nconducting and insulating materials. Like the manipulation of its optical\ncounterpart, the ability to manipulate spin wave polarization is not only\nimportant but also fundamental for magnonics. With only one type of magnetic\nlattice, ferromagnets can only accommodate the right-handed circularly\npolarized spin wave modes, which leaves no freedom for polarization\nmanipulation. In contrast, antiferromagnets, with two opposite magnetic\nsublattices, have both left and right circular polarizations, and all linear\nand elliptical polarizations. Here we demonstrate theoretically and confirm by\nmicromagnetic simulations that, in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction, an antiferromagnetic domain wall acts naturally as a spin wave\npolarizer or a spin wave retarder (waveplate). Our findings provide extremely\nsimple yet flexible routes toward magnonic information processing by harnessing\nthe polarization degree of freedom of spin wave.\n", "  We report on the effect of the lateral confinement and a perpendicular\nmagnetic field on isolated room-temperature magnetic skyrmions in sputtered\nPt/Co/MgO nanotracks and nanodots. We show that the skyrmions size can be\neasily tuned by playing on the lateral dimensions of the nanostructures and by\nusing external magnetic field amplitudes of a few mT, which allow to reach\nsub-100 nm diameters. Our XMCD-PEEM observations also highlight the important\nrole of the pinning on the skyrmions size and stability under an out-of-plane\nmagnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the effect of local\npinning can be well accounted for by considering the thin film grain structure\nwith local anisotropy variations and reproduce well the dependence of the\nskyrmion diameter on the magnetic field and the geometry.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a self-coupled microring resonator for resonance\nsplitting by mutual mode coupling of cavity mode and counter-propagating mode\nin Silicon-on-Insulator platform The resonator is constructed with a\nself-coupling region that can excite counter-propagating mode. We\nexperimentally study the effect of self-coupling on the resonance splitting,\nresonance extinction, and quality-factor evolution and stability. Based on the\ncoupling, we achieve 72% of FSR splitting for a cavity with FSR 2.1 nm with <\n5% variation in the cavity quality factor. The self-coupled resonance splitting\nshows highly robust spectral characteristic that can be exploited for sensing\nand optical signal processing.\n", "  The theoretical proposal of chiral fermions in topological semimetals has led\nto a significant effort towards their experimental realization. In particular,\nthe Fermi surfaces of chiral semimetals carry quantized Chern numbers, making\nthem an attractive platform for the observation of exotic transport and optical\nphenomena. While the simplest example of a chiral fermion in condensed matter\nis a conventional $|C|=1$ Weyl fermion, recent theoretical works have proposed\na number of unconventional chiral fermions beyond the Standard Model which are\nprotected by unique combinations of topology and crystalline symmetries.\nHowever, materials candidates for experimentally probing the transport and\nresponse signatures of these unconventional fermions have thus far remained\nelusive. In this paper, we propose the RhSi family in space group (SG) $\\#$198\nas the ideal platform for the experimental examination of unconventional chiral\nfermions. We find that RhSi is a filling-enforced semimetal that features near\nits Fermi surface a chiral double six-fold-degenerate spin-1 Weyl node at $R$\nand a previously uncharacterized four-fold-degenerate chiral fermion at\n$\\Gamma$. Each unconventional fermion displays Chern number $\\pm4$ at the Fermi\nlevel. We also show that RhSi displays the largest possible momentum separation\nof compensative chiral fermions, the largest proposed topologically nontrivial\nenergy window, and the longest possible Fermi arcs on its surface. We conclude\nby proposing signatures of an exotic bulk photogalvanic response in RhSi.\n", "  We revisit the definition and some of the characteristics of quadratic\ntheories of gravity with torsion. We start from the most general Lagrangian\ndensity quadratic in the curvature and torsion tensors. By assuming that\nGeneral Relativity should be recovered when torsion vanishes and investigating\nthe behaviour of the vector and pseudovector torsion fields in the weak-gravity\nregime, we present a set of necessary conditions for the stability of these\ntheories. Moreover, we explicitly obtain the gravitational field equations\nusing the Palatini variational principle with the metricity condition\nimplemented via a Lagrange multiplier.\n", "  The production of J/$\\psi$ mesons is studied in proton-lead collisions at the\ncentre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=8.16$ TeV with the\nLHCb detector at the LHC. The double differential cross-sections of prompt and\nnonprompt J/$\\psi$ production are measured as functions of the J/$\\psi$\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass frame.\nForward-to-backward ratios and nuclear modification factors are determined. The\nresults are compared with theoretical calculations based on collinear\nfactorisation using nuclear parton distribution functions, on the colour glass\ncondensate or on coherent energy loss models.\n", "  Non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is essential to describe new devices\nthat operate far from the regime where the usual thermodynamical laws are\nobeyed. When quantum fluctuations dominate, defining and measuring work and\nheat, two central concepts in classical thermodynamics, is non-trivial. For\ndriven, but otherwise isolated, quantum systems, work is a random variable\nassociated with the change in the internal energy, as the first law of\nthermodynamics indicates. In this paper we present the design and the\nexperimental implementation of a quantum work meter (QWM) operating on an\nensemble of cold atoms. Our QWM not only directly measures work but also\ndirectly samples its probability distribution. As the work probability\ndistribution plays a central role in the fluctuation theorems of\nnon-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics, the QWM is an ideal tool to test their\nvalidity. In particular, we use it to verify the Jarzynski identity.\n", "  A search for physics beyond the standard model in the final state with two\nsame-flavour leptons (electrons or muons) and two quarks produced in\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV is presented. The data were\nrecorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. The observed data are in good agreement\nwith the standard model background prediction. The results of the measurement\nare interpreted in the framework of a recently proposed model in which a heavy\nMajorana neutrino, N(l), stems from a composite-fermion scenario. Exclusion\nlimits are set for the first time on the mass of the heavy composite Majorana\nneutrino, m[N(l)], and the compositeness scale Lambda. For the case m[N(l)] =\nLambda, the existence of N(e) (N(mu)) is excluded for masses up to 4.60 (4.70)\nTeV at 95% confidence level.\n", "  On the path towards quantum gravity, we find friction between temporal\nrelations in quantum mechanics (QM) (where they are fixed and\nfield-independent), and in general relativity (where they are field-dependent\nand dynamic). This paper aims to attenuate that friction, by encoding gravity\nin the timeless configuration space of spatial fields with dynamics given by a\npath integral. The framework demands that boundary conditions for this path\nintegral be uniquely given, but unlike other approaches where they are\nprescribed --- such as the no-boundary and the tunneling proposals --- here I\npostulate basic principles to identify boundary conditions in a large class of\ntheories. Uniqueness arises only if a reduced configuration space can be\ndefined and if it has a profoundly asymmetric fundamental structure. These\nrequirements place strong restrictions on the field and symmetry content of\ntheories encompassed here; shape dynamics is one such theory. Also as in other\nboundary proposals, Time, including space-time, emerges as an effective\nconcept; valid for certain curves in configuration space but not assumed from\nthe start. When some such notion of time becomes available, conservation of\n(positive) probability currents ensues. I show that, in the appropriate limits,\na Schroedinger equation dictates the evolution of weakly coupled source fields\non a classical gravitational background. Due to the asymmetry of reduced\nconfiguration space, these probabilities and currents avoid a known difficulty\nof standard WKB approximations for Wheeler DeWitt in minisuperspace: the\nselection of a unique Hamilton-Jacobi solution to serve as background. I\nillustrate these constructions with a simple example of a full quantum\ngravitational theory (i.e. not in minisuperspace) for which the formalism is\napplicable, and give a formula for calculating gravitational semi-classical\nrelative probabilities in it.\n", "  Scanning probe microscopy using nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has\nbecome a versatile tool with applications in physics, chemistry, life sciences\nand earth and planetary sciences. However, the fabrication of diamond scanning\nprobes with high photon collection efficiency, NV centers with long coherence\ntimes and integrated radio frequency (RF) remains challenging due to the small\nphysical dimensions of the probes and the complexity of the fabrication\ntechniques. In this work, we present a simple and robust method to reliably\nfabricate probes that can be integrated with conventional quartz tuning fork\nbased sensors as well as commercial silicon AFM cantilevers. For the first\ntime, an integrated RF micro-antenna for NV center spin manipulation is\ndirectly fabricated onto the probe making the design versatile and compatible\nwith virtually all AFM instruments. This integration marks a complete sensor\npackage for NV center-based magnetometry, and opens up this newly developed\nscanning probe technique to the broader scientific community.\n", "  In Neutrinophilic Two Higgs Doublet Models, Dirac neutrino masses are\nobtained by forbidding a Majorana mass term for the right-handed neutrinos via\na symmetry. We study a variation of such models in which that symmetry is taken\nto be a local U(1), leading naturally to the typical Lagrangian of the inverse\nseesaw scenario. The presence of a new gauge boson and of an extended scalar\nsector result in a rich phenomenology, including modifications to Z, Higgs and\nkaon decays as well as to electroweak precision parameters, and a pseudoscalar\nassociated to the breaking of lepton number.\n", "  We derive a class of non-static inhomogeneous dust solutions in f(R) gravity\ndescribed by the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric. The field equations are\nfully integrated for all parameter subcases and compared with analogous\nsubcases of LTB dust solutions of GR. Since the solutions do not admit regular\nsymmetry centres, we have two possibilities: (i) a spherical dust cloud with\nangle deficit acting as the source of a vacuum Schwarzschild-like solution\nassociated with a global monopole, or (ii) fully regular dust wormholes without\nangle deficit, whose rest frames are homeomorphic to the Schwarzschild-Kruskal\nmanifold or to a 3d torus. The compatibility between the LTB metric and generic\nf(R) ansatzes furnishes an \"inverse procedure\" to generate LTB solutions whose\nsources are found from the f(R) geometry. While the resulting fluids may have\nan elusive physical interpretation, they can be used as exact non--perturbative\ntoy models in theoretical and cosmological applications of f(R) theories.\n", "  Magnetotransport properties of the high-quality FeSe crystal, measured in a\nwide temperature range and in magnetic fields up to 50 T, show the symmetry of\nthe main holelike and electronlike bands in this compound. In addition to the\nmain two bands, there is also a tiny, highly mobile, electronlike band which is\nresponsible for the non-linear behavior of $\\rho_{xy}$(B) at low temperatures\nand some other peculiarities of FeSe. We observe the inversion of the\n$\\rho_{xx}$ temperature coeficient at a magnetic field higher than about 20 T\nwhich is an implicit conformation of the electron-hole symmetry in the main\nbands.\n", "  Several extensions of the Standard Model predict associated production of\ndark-matter particles with a Higgs boson. Such processes are searched for in\nfinal states with missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying to a\n$b\\bar b$ pair with the ATLAS detector using 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions\nat a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC. The observed data are in\nagreement with the Standard Model predictions and limits are placed on the\nassociated production of dark-matter particles and a Higgs boson.\n", "  We address the computation of ground-state properties of chemical systems and\nrealistic materials within the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. The\nphase constraint to control the fermion phase problem requires the random walks\nin Slater determinant space to be open-ended with branching. This in turn makes\nit necessary to use back-propagation (BP) to compute averages and correlation\nfunctions of operators that do not commute with the Hamiltonian. Several BP\nschemes are investigated and their optimization with respect to the phaseless\nconstraint is considered. We propose a modified BP method for the computation\nof observables in electronic systems, discuss its numerical stability and\ncomputational complexity, and assess its performance by computing ground-state\nproperties for several substances, including constituents of the primordial\nterrestrial atmosphere and small organic molecules.\n", "  We have tested some simple quintessential inflation models, imposing that\nthey match with the recent observational data provided by the BICEP and\nPlanck's team and leading to a reheating temperature, which is obtained via\ngravitational particle production after inflation, supporting the\nnucleosynthesis success. Moreover, for the models coming from supergravity one\nneeds to demand low temperatures in order to avoid problems such as the\ngravitino overproduction or the gravitational production of moduli fields,\nwhich are obtained only when the reheating temperature is due to the production\nof massless particles with a coupling constant very close to its conformal\nvalue.\n", "  We investigate the performance of a simple Bayesian fitting approach to\ncorrect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization for\ngravitational lensing effects in the recovered probability distribution of the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio. We perform a two-dimensional power spectrum fit of the\namplitude of the primordial B-modes (tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$) and the\namplitude of the lensing B-modes (parameter $A_{lens}$), jointly with the\nestimation of the astrophysical foregrounds including both synchrotron and\nthermal dust emissions. Using this Bayesian framework, we forecast the ability\nof the proposed CMB space mission LiteBIRD to constrain $r$ in the presence of\nrealistic lensing and foreground contributions. We compute the joint posterior\ndistribution of $r$ and $A_{lens}$, which we improve by adopting a prior on\n$A_{lens}$ taken from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) measurement. As it applies\nto the power spectrum, this approach cannot mitigate the uncertainty on $r$\nthat is due to E-mode cosmic variance transferred to B-modes by lensing, unlike\nstandard delensing techniques that are performed on maps. However, the method\nallows to correct for the bias on $r$ induced by lensing, at the expense of a\nlarger uncertainty due to the increased volume of the parameter space. We\nquantify, for different values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the trade-off\nbetween bias correction and increase of uncertainty on $r$. For LiteBIRD\nsimulations, which include foregrounds and lensing contamination, we find that\ncorrecting the foreground-cleaned CMB B-mode power spectrum for the lensing\nbias, not the lensing cosmic variance, still guarantees a $3\\sigma$ detection\nof $r=5\\times 10^{-3}$. The significance of the detection is increased to\n$6\\sigma$ when the current SPT prior on $A_{lens}$ is adopted.\n", "  The contribution from the axial-vector meson exchange to the potential of the\nmuon-proton interaction in muonic hydrogen induced by anomalous axial-vector\nmeson coupling to two photon state is calculated. It is shown that such\ncontribution to the hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen is large and\nimportant for a comparison with precise experimental data. In the light of our\nresult, the proton radius \"puzzle\" is discussed.\n", "  We calculate the K-edge indirect bimagnon resonant inelastic X-ray scattering\n(RIXS) intensity spectra of the bicollinear antiferromagnetic order known to\noccur in the $\\alpha$-FeTe chalcogenide system. Utilizing linear spin wave\ntheory for this large-S spin system we find that the bimagnon spectrum contains\nfour scattering channels (two intraband and two interband). We find from our\ncalculations that for suitable energy-momentum combination the RIXS spectra can\nexhibit a one-, two- or three- peak structure. The number of peaks provides a\nclue on the various bimagnon excitation processes that can be supported both in\nand within the acoustic and optical magnon branches of the bicollinear\nantiferromagnet. Unlike the RIXS response of the antiferromagnetic or the\ncollinear antiferromagnetic spin ordering, the RIXS intensity spectrum of the\nbicollinear antiferromagnet does not vanish at the magnetic ordering wave\nvector $(\\pi/2,-\\pi/2)$. It is also sensitive to next-next nearest neighbor and\nbiquadratic coupling interactions. Our predicted RIXS spectrum can be utilized\nto understand the role of multi-channel bimagnon spin excitations present in\nthe $\\alpha$-FeTe chalcogenide.\n", "  Statistics of photons emitted by mobile excitons in individual carbon\nnanotubes are investigated. Photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to identify\nthe chiralities and suspended lengths of air-suspended nanotubes, and photon\ncorrelation measurements are performed at room temperature on\ntelecommunication-wavelength nanotube emission with a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss\nsetup. We obtain zero-delay second-order correlation $g^{(2)}(0)$ less than\n0.5, indicating single photon generation. Excitation power dependence of the\nphoton antibunching characteristics is examined for nanotubes with various\nchiralities and suspended lengths, where we find that the minimum value of\n$g^{(2)}(0)$ is obtained at the lowest power. The influence of exciton\ndiffusion and end quenching is studied by Monte Carlo simulations, and we\nderive an analytical expression for the minimum value of $g^{(2)}(0)$. Our\nresults indicate that mobile excitons in micron-long nanotubes can in principle\nproduce high-purity single photons, leading to new design strategies for\nquantum photon sources.\n", "  By means of symmetry analysis, density functional theory calculations, and\nMonte Carlo simulations we show that goethite, $\\alpha$-FeOOH, is a linear\nmagnetoelectric below its N\\'{e}el temperature $T_{\\rm N}=400$ K. The\nexperimentally observed magnetic field induced spin-flop phase transition\nresults in either change of direction of electric polarization or its\nsuppression. Calculated value of magnetoelectric coefficient is 0.24 $\\mu$C\nm$^{-2}$ T$^{-1}$. The abundance of goethite in nature makes it arguably the\nmost widespread magnetoelectric material.\n", "  Motivated by the recent LHCb observation of doubly-charmed baryon\n$\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ in the $\\Lambda_c^+ K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ final state, we analyze the\nweak decays of doubly heavy baryons $\\Xi_{cc}$, $\\Omega_{cc}$, $\\Xi_{bc}$,\n$\\Omega_{bc}$, $\\Xi_{bb}$ and $\\Omega_{bb}$ under the flavor SU(3) symmetry.\nDecay amplitudes for various semileptonic and nonleptonic decays are\nparametrized in terms of a few SU(3) irreducible amplitudes. We find a number\nof relations or sum rules between decay widths and CP asymmetries, which can be\nexamined in future measurements at experimental facilities like LHC, Belle II\nand CEPC. Moreover once a few decay branching fractions are measured in future,\nsome of these relations may provide hints for exploration of new decay modes.\n", "  Scalar and pseudo-scalar resonances decaying to top quarks are common\npredictions in several scenarios beyond the standard model (SM) and are\nextensively searched for by LHC experiments. Challenges on the experimental\nside require optimising the strategy based on accurate predictions. Firstly,\nQCD corrections are known to be large both for the SM QCD background and for\nthe pure signal scalar production. Secondly, leading order and approximate\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) calculations indicate that the interference between\nsignal and background is large and drastically changes the lineshape of the\nsignal, from a simple peak to a peak-dip structure. Therefore, a robust\nprediction of this interference at NLO accuracy in QCD is necessary to ensure\nthat higher-order corrections do not alter the lineshapes. We compute the exact\nNLO corrections, assuming a point-like coupling between the scalar and the\ngluons and consistently embedding the calculation in an effective field theory\nwithin an automated framework, and present results for a representative set of\nbeyond the SM benchmarks. The results can be further matched to parton shower\nsimulation, providing more realistic predictions. We find that NLO corrections\nare important and lead to a significant reduction of the uncertainties. We also\ndiscuss how our computation can be used to improve the predictions for physics\nscenarios where the gluon-scalar loop is resolved and the effective approach is\nless applicable.\n", "  A scheme for secure multiparty quantum summation was proposed by Run-hau Shi\net al.,(SCIENTIFIC REPORTS, 6:19655, DOI:10.1038/srep19655). IBM Corporation\nhas released a superconductivity based 5-qubit quantum computer named \"Quantum\nExperience\" and placed it on \"cloud\". In this paper we take advantage of the\nonline availability of this real quantum processor(ibmqx2) and carry out the\nabove protocol that has never been experimentally demonstrated earlier. Here,\nwe set up experiments for secure quantum summation of one-qubit secret states .\nBesides, we propose a protocol for square and cubic summation and also simulate\nthe proposed protocol for both cases. Experimental implementation of secure\nmultiparty quantum summation protocol for two or more qubit secret state and\nthe proposed protocol for square(and cubic) summation are not possible using\nthe available 5-qubit quantum processor(ibmqx2). IBM has recently placed a\n16-qubit quantum processor(ibmqx3) on the cloud but it is still not accessible\nfor all users. We describe a simulation for two and three qubit secret state\nand proposed protocol for square(and cubic) summation using a simulator(Custom\nTopology) which is provided by IBM Corporation.\n", "  We consider a zero-temperature one-dimensional system of bosons interacting\nvia the soft-shoulder potential in the continuum, typical of dressed Rydberg\ngases. We employ quantum Monte Carlo simulations, which allow for the exact\ncalculation of imaginary-time correlations, and a stochastic analytic\ncontinuation method, to extract the dynamical structure factor. At finite\ndensities, in the weakly-interacting homogeneous regime, a rotonic spectrum\nmarks the tendency to clustering. With strong interactions, we indeed observe\ncluster liquid phases emerging, characterized by the spectrum of a composite\nharmonic chain. Luttinger theory has to be adapted by changing the reference\nlattice density field. In both the liquid and cluster liquid phases, we find\nconvincing evidence of a secondary mode, which becomes gapless only at the\ntransition. In that region, we also measure the central charge and observe its\nincrease towards c = 3/2, as recently evaluated in a related extended\nBose-Hubbard model, and we note a fast reduction of the Luttinger parameter.\nFor 2-particle clusters, we then interpret such observations in terms of the\ncompresence of a Luttinger liquid and a critical transverse Ising model,\nrelated to the instability of the reference lattice density field towards\ncoalescence of sites, typical of potentials which are flat at short distances.\nEven in the absence of a true lattice, we are able to evaluate the spatial\ncorrelation function of a suitable pseudo-spin operator, which manifests\nferromagnetic order in the cluster liquid phase, exponential decay in the\nliquid phase, and algebraic order at criticality.\n", "  Aluminium plays a key role in studies of the chemical enrichment of the\nGalaxy and of globular clusters. However, strong deviations from LTE (non-LTE)\nare known to significantly affect the inferred abundances in giant and\nmetal-poor stars. We present NLTE modeling of aluminium using recent and\naccurate atomic data, in particular utilizing new transition rates for\ncollisions with hydrogen atoms, without the need for any astrophysically\ncalibrated parameters. For the first time, we perform 3D NLTE modeling of\naluminium lines in the solar spectrum. We also compute and make available\nextensive grids of abundance corrections for lines in the optical and\nnear-infrared using one-dimensional model atmospheres, and apply grids of\nprecomputed departure coefficients to direct line synthesis for a set of\nbenchmark stars with accurately known stellar parameters. Our 3D NLTE modeling\nof the solar spectrum reproduces observed center-to-limb variations in the\nsolar spectrum of the 7835 {\\AA} line as well as the mid-infrared photospheric\nemission line at 12.33 micron. We infer a 3D NLTE solar photospheric abundance\nof A(Al) = 6.43+-0.03, in exact agreement with the meteoritic abundance. We\nfind that abundance corrections vary rapidly with stellar parameters; for the\n3961 {\\AA} resonance line, corrections are positive and may be as large as +1\ndex, while corrections for subordinate lines generally have positive sign for\nwarm stars but negative for cool stars. Our modeling reproduces the observed\nline profiles of benchmark K-giants, and we find abundance corrections as large\nas -0.3 dex for Arcturus. Our analyses of four metal-poor benchmark stars yield\nconsistent abundances between the 3961 {\\AA} resonance line and lines in the\nUV, optical and near-infrared regions. Finally, we discuss implications for the\ngalactic chemical evolution of aluminium.\n", "  I examine the evolution of nuclear forces under the similarity\nrenormalization group (SRG) using traces of the many-body configuration-space\nHamiltonian. While SRG is often said to \"soften\" the nuclear interaction, I\nprovide numerical examples which paint a complementary point of view: the\nprimary effect of SRG, using the kinetic energy as the generator of the\nevolution, is to shift downward the diagonal matrix elements in the model\nspace, while the off-diagonal elements undergo significantly smaller changes.\nBy employing traces, I argue that this is a very natural outcome as one\ndiagonalizes a matrix, and helps one to understand the success of SRG.\n", "  There is an ongoing search for a physical or operational definition for\nquantum mechanics. Several informational principles have been proposed which\nare satisfied by a theory less restrictive than quantum mechanics. Here, we\nintroduce the principle of \"many-box locality\", which is a refined version of\nthe previously proposed \"macroscopic locality\". These principles are based on\ncoarse-graining the statistics of several copies of a given box. The set of\nbehaviors satisfying many-box locality for $N$ boxes is denoted $MBL_N$. We\nstudy these sets in the bipartite scenario with two binary measurements, in\nrelation with the sets $\\mathcal{Q}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}_{1+AB}$ of quantum and\n\"almost quantum\" correlations. We find that the $MBL_N$ sets are in general not\nconvex. For unbiased marginals, by working in the Fourier space we can prove\nanalytically that $MBL_{N}\\subsetneq\\mathcal{Q}$ for any finite $N$, while\n$MBL_{\\infty}=\\mathcal{Q}$. Then, with suitably developed numerical tools, we\nfind an example of a point that belongs to $MBL_{16}$ but not to\n$\\mathcal{Q}_{1+AB}$. Among the problems that remain open, is whether\n$\\mathcal{Q}\\subset MBL_{\\infty}$.\n", "  We consider known examples of non-supersymmetric AdS$_7$ and AdS$_4$\nsolutions arising from compactifications of massive type IIA supergravity and\nstudy their stability, taking into account the coupling between closed- and\nopen-string sector excitations. Generically, open strings are found to develop\nmodes with masses below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound. We comment on\nthe relation with the Weak Gravity Conjecture, and how this analysis may play\nan important role in examining the validity of non-supersymmetric constructions\nin string theory.\n", "  The test of gravitational force on antimatter in the field of the matter\ngravitational field, produced by earth, can be done by a free fall experiment\nwhich involves only General Relativity, and with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer\nwhich involves Quantum Mechanics. This article presents a new method to produce\na tunable low energy (Ps ) beam suitable for trapping the (Hbar + ) ion in a\nfree fall experiment, and suitable for a gravity Mach-Zehnder interferometer\nwith (Ps). The low energy (Ps) beam is tunable in the [10 eV, 100 eV] range.\n", "  We consider an excitatory population of subthreshold Izhikevich neurons which\ncannot fire spontaneously without noise. As the coupling strength passes a\nthreshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced burstings. This neuronal\npopulation has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the absence of STDP, stochastic\nburst synchronization (SBS) between noise-induced burstings of subthreshold\nneurons was previously found to occur over a large range of intermediate noise\nintensities. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on the SBS by varying\nthe noise intensity $D$ in the Barab\\'asi-Albert scale-free network (SFN) for\nthe case of symmetric preferential attachment. This type of SFN exhibits a\npower-law degree distribution, and hence it becomes an inhomogeneous one with a\nfew \"hubs\" (i.e., super-connected nodes). Occurrence of a \"Matthew\" effect in\nsynaptic plasticity is found to occur due to a positive feedback process. Good\nburst synchronization gets better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic\nstrengths, while bad burst synchronization gets worse via long-term depression\n(LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs by changing\n$D$, in contrast to a relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. In\nthe presence of additive STDP, we also investigate the effects of network\narchitecture on the SBS for a fixed $D$. Emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic\nstrengths are investigated in details via microscopic studies based on both the\ndistributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the\npost-synaptic neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the\npost-synaptic IIBRs (instantaneous individual burst rates). Finally, a\nmultiplicative STDP case (depending on states) is also investigated in\ncomparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states).\n", "  Magnetorotational instability (MRI) is one of the fundamental processes in\nastrophysics, driving angular momentum transport and mass accretion in a wide\nvariety of cosmic objects. Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory. Using direct numerical simulations, in\nthis paper we investigate the nonlinear development and saturation properties\nof the helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) -- a relative of the\nstandard MRI -- in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow at very low magnetic\nPrandtl number (correspondingly at low magnetic Reynolds number) relevant to\nliquid metals. For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known that the Elsasser\nnumber, or interaction parameter determines its growth rate and plays a special\nrole in the dynamics. We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem. By increasing its value, a sudden transition from weakly\nnonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear stability threshold,\nto strongly nonlinear, or turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature. Although the contribution of non-axisymmetric modes increases\nmoderately with the Elsasser number, their total energy remains much smaller\nthan that of the axisymmetric ones.\n", "  Up to now, Einstein's general theory of relativity has passed all\nexperimental tests. But yet we know that it is not a fundamental theory and\nthat it is incompatible with quantum theory. While several extended and\nimproved gravitational theories on classical and quantum level are nowadays\navailable, it is a great challenge to find experimental setups to check their\nsignatures.\n  We discuss recent developments in direct observation of black holes\ncomprising gravitational waves from black hole mergers, radio interferometry\nimages of black hole shadows, and Hawking radiation of black holes in particle\naccelerators. These investigations cover the full black hole mass range from\nmicroscopic to stellar and supermassive black holes. We comment on the\nassociated strong-field tests of Einstein's general theory of relativity and\nimplications for quantum gravity.\n  Special emphasis lies upon the physics of large extra dimensions and black\nhole evaporation, the existence of a minimal black hole mass, and the cross\nsections of higher-dimensional black holes. We complete this short review with\nthe latest experimental constraints at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  Kinematic space can be used as an intermediate step in the AdS/CFT dictionary\nand lends itself naturally to the description of diffeomorphism invariant\nquantities. From the bulk it has been defined as the space of boundary anchored\ngeodesics, and from the boundary as the space of pairs of CFT points. When the\nbulk is not globally AdS$_3$ the appearance of non-minimal geodesics leads to\nambiguities in these definitions. In this work conical defect spacetimes are\nconsidered as an example where non-minimal geodesics are common. From the bulk\nit is found that the conical defect kinematic space can be obtained from the\nAdS$_3$ kinematic space by the same quotient under which one obtains the defect\nfrom AdS$_3$. The resulting kinematic space is one of many equivalent\nfundamental regions. From the boundary the conical defect kinematic space can\nbe determined by breaking up OPE blocks into contributions from individual bulk\ngeodesics. A duality is established between partial OPE blocks and bulk fields\nintegrated over individual geodesics, minimal or non-minimal.\n", "  We report measurements of the temperature dependence specific heat, magnetic\nsusceptibility in single crystals of the series of intermetallic compounds\nTb$_{1-x}$Y$_x$RhIn$_5$ (nominal concentrations $x= 0.15, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50$ and\n$0.70$). A mean field approximation to simulate the macroscopic properties\nalong the series has been used. Neutron diffraction data in powdered sample of\nnominal concentration Tb$_{0.6}$Y$_{0.4}$RhIn$_5$ reveal AFM propagation vector\n$k=[\\frac{1}{2}~0~\\frac{1}{2}]$ with the magnetic moments oriented close to the\ntetragonal \\textit{c} axis. We discuss the role of combined effects of\ncrystalline electric field (CEF) perturbations and dilution in the magnetic\nproperties evolution with Y content. In particular, we suggest that changes in\nthe Tb-In first neighbors distances, i.e. the TbIn$_3$ cuboctahedra distortion,\nare responsible for changes in the Tb crystalline potential and the possible\nreorientation of Tb magnetic moments for $x>$0.4. This reflects non negligible\nvariations of the $B^{m}_{n}$ crystal field parameters and the energy levels\nsplitting with \\textit{x}.\n", "  By using variational wave functions and quantum Monte Carlo techniques, we\ninvestigate the interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon\ninteractions in the two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model. Here, the\nground-state phase diagram is triggered by several energy scales, i.e., the\nelectron hopping $t$, the on-site electron-electron interaction $U$, the phonon\nenergy $\\omega_0$, and the electron-phonon coupling $g$. At half filling, the\nground state is an antiferromagnetic insulator for $U \\gtrsim 2g^2/\\omega_0$,\nwhile it is a charge-density-wave (or bi-polaronic) insulator for $U \\lesssim\n2g^2/\\omega_0$. In addition to these phases, we find a superconducting phase\nthat intrudes between them. For $\\omega_0/t=1$, superconductivity emerges when\nboth $U/t$ and $2g^2/t\\omega_0$ are small; then, by increasing the value of the\nphonon energy $\\omega_0$, it extends along the transition line between\nantiferromagnetic and charge-density-wave insulators. Away from half filling,\nphase separation occurs when doping the charge-density-wave insulator, while a\nuniform (superconducting) ground state is found when doping the superconducting\nphase. In the analysis of finite-size effects, it is extremely important to\naverage over twisted boundary conditions, especially in the weak-coupling limit\nand in the doped case.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a two-dimensional harmonically-trapped gas of\nidentical atoms with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and no interatomic\ninteractions. In analogy with the spin Hall effect in uniform space, the gas\nexhibits a spin Hall mode. In particular, in response to a displacement of the\ncenter-of-mass of the system, spin-dipole moment oscillations occur. We\ndetermine the properties of these oscillations exactly, and find that their\namplitude strongly depends on the spin-orbit coupling strength and the quantum\nstatistics of the particles.\n", "  We investigate the properties of magnon edge states in a ferromagnetic\nhoneycomb lattice with armchair boundaries. In contrast with fermionic\ngraphene, we find novel edge states due to the missing bonds along the boundary\nsites. After introducing an external on-site potential at the outermost sites\nwe find that the energy spectra of the edge states are tunable. Additionally,\nwhen a non-trivial gap is induced, we find that some of the edge states are\ntopologically protected and also tunable. Our results may explain the origin of\nthe novel edge states recently observed in photonic lattices. We also discuss\nthe behavior of these edge states for further experimental confirmations\n", "  String-localized quantum fields transforming in Wigner's infinite-spin\nrepresentations were introduced by Mund, Schroer and Yngvason. We construct\nthese fields as limits of fields of finite mass $m\\to 0$ and finite spin\n$s\\to\\infty$. We determine a string-localized infinite-spin quantum\nstress-energy tensor with a novel prescription that does not refer to a\nclassical Lagrangean.\n", "  Power-law distributions are ubiquitous in nature. Random multiplicative\nprocesses are a basic model for the generation of power-law distributions. It\nis known that, for discrete-time systems, the power-law exponent decreases as\nthe autocorrelation time of the multiplier increases. However, for\ncontinuous-time ystems, it has not yet been elucidated as to how the temporal\ncorrelation affects the power-law behavior. Herein, we have analytically\ninvestigated a multiplicative Langevin equation with colored noise. We show\nthat the power-law exponent depends on the details of the multiplicative noise,\nin contrast to the case of discrete-time systems.\n", "  Parametric Subharmonic Instability (PSI) is one of the most important\nmechanisms that transfer energy from tidally-generated long internal waves to\nshort steep waves. Breaking of these short waves results in diapycnal mixing\nthrough which oceanic abyssal stratification is maintained. It has long been\nbelieved that PSI is strongest between a primary internal wave and perturbative\nwaves of half the frequency of the primary wave. Here, we rigorously show that\nthis is not the case. Specifically, we show that neither the initial growth\nrate nor the maximum long-term amplification occur at the half frequency, and\ndemonstrate that the dominant subharmonic waves have much longer wavelengths\nthan previously thought.\n", "  Simultaneous differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric (TG)\nmeasurements with copper oxide/aluminum oxide mixtures were performed in\natmospheres with varying oxygen partial pressures and with crucibles made of\ndifferent materials. Only sapphire and platinum crucibles proved to be stable\nunder conditions that are useful for the growth of CuAlO$_2$ delafossite single\ncrystals. Then the ternary phase diagram Al$_2$O$_3$-CuO-Cu and its isopleth\nsection Cu$_2$O-Al$_2$O$_3$ were redetermined. Millimeter sized crystals could\nbe obtained from copper oxide melts with 1-2 mol % addition of aluminum oxide\nthat are stable in platinum crucibles held in oxidizing atmosphere containing\n15-21 % oxygen.\n", "  We present X-ray light curves of Cygnus X-3 as measured by the recently\nlaunched AstroSat satellite. The light curve folded over the binary period of\n4.8 hours shows a remarkable stability over the past 45 years and we find that\nwe can use this information to measure the zero point to better than 100 s. We\nrevisit the historical binary phase measurements and examine the stability of\nthe binary period over 45 years. We present a new binary ephemeris with the\nperiod and period derivative determined to an accuracy much better than\npreviously reported. We do not find any evidence for a second derivative in the\nperiod variation. The precise binary period measurements, however, indicate a\nhint of short term episodic variations in periods. Interestingly, these short\nterm period variations coincide with the period of enhanced jet activity\nexhibited by the source. We discuss the implications of these observations on\nthe nature of the binary system.\n", "  We have recently presented a manifestly local and general coordinate\ninvariant formulation of a nonlocal approach to the cosmological constant\nproblem. In this article, we investigate quantum effects from both matter and\ngravitational fields in this formulation. In particular, we pay our attention\nto the gravitational loop effects and show that the effective cosmological\nconstant is radiatively stable even in the presence of the gravitational loop\neffects in addition to matter loop effects. For this purpose we need to add the\n$R^2$ term and the corresponding topological action as an total action, which\nshould be contrasted with the work by Kaloper and Padilla where the topological\nGauss-Bonnet term is added instead of the $R^2$ term. The advantages of our new\nformulation compared to that by Kaloper and Padilla are that not only we do not\nhave to assume the scale invariance which is required to render the space-time\naverage of the square of the Weyl curvature vanishing, but also our formulation\nwould lead to the $R^2$ inflation in a natural manner.\n", "  The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Polarization plays an important role in\ncurrent cosmological studies. CMB B-mode polarization is the most effective\nprobe to primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) and a test of the inflation as\nwell as other theories of the early universe such as bouncing and cyclic\nuniverse. So far, major ground-based CMB polarization experiments are located\nin the southern hemisphere.Recently, China has launched the Ali CMB\nPolarization Telescope (AliCPT) in Tibetan Plateau to measure CMB B mode\npolarization and detect the PGWs in northern hemisphere. AliCPT include two\nstages, the first one is to build a telescope at the 5250m site (AliCPT-1) and\nthe second one is to have a more sensitive telescope at a higher altitude of\nabout 6000m (AliCPT-2). In this paper, we report the atmospherical conditions,\nsky coverage and the current infrastructure associated with AliCPT. We analyzed\nthe reanalysis data from MERRA-2 together with radiosonde data from the Ali\nMeteorological Service and found that the amount of water vapor has a heavy\nseasonal variation and October to March is the suitable observation time. We\nalso found 95/150 GHz to be feasible for AliCPT-1 and higher frequencies to be\npossible for AliCPT-2. Then we analyzed the observable sky and the target\nfields, and showed that Ali provides us a unique opportunity to observe CMB\nwith less foreground contamination in the northern hemisphere and is\ncomplementary to the existed southern CMB experiments. Together with the\ndeveloped infrastructure, we point out that Ali opens a new window for CMB\nobservation and will be one of the major sites in the world along with\nAntarctic and Atacama.\n", "  We investigate the texture structures of lepton mass matrices with four\n(five) non-zero elements in the charged lepton mass matrix and three (four)\nvanishing cofactors in the neutrino mass matrix. Using weak basis\ntransformations, all possible textures for three and four vanishing cofactors\nin $M_{\\nu}$ are grouped into 7 classes and predictions for the unknown\nparameters such as the Dirac CP violating phase and the effective Majorana mass\nfor the phenomenologically allowed textures have been obtained. We, also,\nillustrate how such texture structures can be realized using discrete Abelian\nflavor symmetries.\n", "  We discuss the possibility that the Higgs potential and electroweak scale are\ngenerated radiatively in a type-I seesaw scenario. A Higgs potential consistent\nwith experimental constraints can be obtained in this hypothesis for a Majorana\nmass scale $m_N\\sim 10-500$ PeV and with neutrino Yukawa couplings of order\n$|\\omega|\\sim 10^{-4.5}-10^{-6}$. Remarkably, neutrino masses and mixings can\nbe simultaneously accommodated within this parameter space. This framework,\nthat ties together Higgs phenomenology, precision top quark mass measurements\nand neutrino physics, represents an alternative approach to the hierarchy\nproblem, in which the Higgs mass is not stabilized around the TeV scale, but\nrather determined by radiative corrections at higher energies. Traditional\nhurdles in overcoming the hierarchy problem are then traded for the new\nchallenge of generating PeV Majorana masses while suppressing the tree-level\nscalar potential in the UV.\n", "  I present a scenario wherein heavy neutral vector bosons Z', predicted by\nGUT-inspired U(1)' models, decay into supersymmetric final states, besides the\nStandard Model channels investigated at the LHC. It is found that accounting\nfor such decays lowers the exclusion limits on the Z' mass at 13 TeV by about\n200-300 GeV.\n", "  Event patterns extracted from anisotropic spectra of charged particles\nproduced in lead-lead collisions at 2.76 TeV are investigated. We use an\ninverse power-law resulted from the QCD calculus to describe the transverse\nmomentum spectrum in the hard scattering process, and a revised Erlang\ndistribution resulted from a multisource thermal model to describe the\ntransverse momentum spectrum and anisotropic flow in the soft excitation\nprocess. The pseudorapidity distribution is described by a three-Gaussian\nfunction which is a revision of the Landau hydrodynamic model. Thus, the event\npatterns at the kinetic freeze-out are displayed by the scatter plots of the\nconsidered particles in the three-dimensional velocity, momentum, and rapidity\nspaces.\n", "  Maximal supergravity in four dimensions admits two inequivalent dyonic\ngaugings of the group $\\mathrm{SO}(4) \\times \\mathrm{SO}(2,2) \\ltimes T^{16}$.\nBoth admit a Minkowski vacuum with residual $\\mathrm{SO}(4) \\times\n\\mathrm{SO}(2)^2$ symmetry and identical spectrum. We explore these vacua and\ntheir deformations. Using exceptional field theory, we show that the\nfour-dimensional theories arise as consistent truncations from IIA and IIB\nsupergravity, respectively, around a $\\mathrm{Mink}_4\\times S^3\\times H^3$\ngeometry. The IIA/IIB truncations are efficiently related by an outer\nautomorphism of $\\mathrm{SL}(4) \\subset \\mathrm{E}_{7(7)}$. As an application,\nwe give an explicit uplift of the moduli of the vacua into a 4-parameter family\nof ten-dimensional solutions.\n", "  Binary stars commonly pass through phases of direct interaction which result\nin the rapid loss of mass, energy, and angular momentum. Though crucial to\nunderstanding the fates of these systems, including their potential as\ngravitational wave sources, this short-lived phase is poorly understood and has\nthus far been unambiguously observed in only a single event, V1309 Sco. Here we\nshow that the complex and previously-unexplained photometric behavior of V1309\nSco prior to its main outburst results naturally from the runaway loss of mass\nand angular momentum from the outer Lagrange point, which lasts for thousands\nof orbits prior to the final dynamical coalescence, much longer than predicted\nby contemporary models. This process enshrouds the binary in a \"death spiral\"\noutflow, which affects the amplitude and phase modulation of its light curve,\nand contributes to driving the system together. The total amount of mass lost\nduring this gradual phase ($\\sim 0.05 M_\\odot$) rivals the mass lost during the\nsubsequent dynamical interaction phase, which has been the main focus of\n\"common envelope\" modeling so far. Analogous features in related transients\nsuggest that this behavior is ubiquitous.\n", "  JWST was conceived and built to answer one of the most fundamental questions\nthat humans can address empirically: \"How did the Universe make its first\nstars?\". Our First Lights At REionization (FLARE) project transforms the quest\nfor the epoch of reionization from the static to the time domain. It targets\nthe complementary question: \"What happened to those first stars?\". It will be\nanswered by observations of the most luminous events: supernovae and accretion\non to black holes formed by direct collapse from the primordial gas clouds.\nThese transients provide direct constraints on star-formation rates (SFRs) and\nthe truly initial Initial Mass Function (IMF), and they may identify possible\nstellar seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Furthermore, our knowledge\nof the physics of these events at ultra-low metallicity will be much expanded.\nJWST's unique capabilities will detect these most luminous and earliest cosmic\nmessengers easily in fairly shallow observations. However, these events are\nvery rare at the dawn of cosmic structure formation and so require large area\ncoverage. Time domain astronomy can be advanced to an unprecedented depth by\nmeans of a shallow field of JWST reaching 27 mag AB in 2 and 4.4 microns over a\nfield as large as 0.1 square degree visited multiple times each year. Such a\nsurvey may set strong constraints or detect massive Pop III SNe at redshifts\nbeyond 10, pinpointing the redshift of the first stars, or at least their\ndeath. Based on our current knowledge of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), such\na survey will find one or more SLSNe at redshifts above 6 in five years and\npossibly several direct collapse black holes. Although JWST is not designed as\na wide field survey telescope, we show that such a wide field survey is\npossible with JWST and is critical in addressing several of its key scientific\ngoals.\n", "  In this dissertation we study hidden symmetries within the framework of\nstring theory. There are two kinds of hidden symmetries investigated in this\nwork: the first type is associated with dynamics of quantum fields and the\nsecond type is related to integrability of strings on various backgrounds. The\ngoals of this thesis are twofold: extension of hidden symmetries known in\ngeneral relativity to stringy backgrounds in higher dimensions and construction\nof new integrable string theories.\n  In the context of the first goal we study hidden symmetries of stringy\nbackgrounds, with and without supersymmetry. For supersymmetric geometries\nproduced by D--branes we identify the backgrounds with solvable equations for\ngeodesics, which can potentially give rise to integrable string theories.\nRelaxing the requirement of supersymmetry, we also study charged black holes in\nhigher dimensions and identify their hidden symmetries encoded in so--called\nKilling(-Yano) tensors. We construct the explicit form of the Killing(-Yano)\ntensors for the charged rotating black hole in arbitrary number of dimensions,\nstudy behavior of such tensors under string dualities, and use the analysis of\nhidden symmetries to explain why exact solutions for black rings (black holes\nwith non-spherical event horizons) in more than five dimensions remain elusive.\nAs a byproduct we identify the standard parameterization of AdSp x S^q\nbackgrounds with elliptic coordinates on a flat base.\n  The second goal of this work is construction of new integrable string\ntheories by applying continuous deformations of known examples. We use the\nrecent developments called (generalized) lambda-deformation to construct new\nintegrable backgrounds depending on several continuous parameters and study\nanalytical properties of the such deformations.\n", "  On their way through the heliosphere, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) are\nmodulated by various effects before they can be detected at Earth. This process\ncan be described by the Parker equation, which calculates the phase space\ndistribution of GCRs depending on the main modulation processes: convection,\ndrifts, diffusion and adiabatic energy changes. A first order approximation of\nthis equation is the force field approach, reducing it to a one-parameter\ndependency, the solar modulation potential $\\phi$. Utilizing this approach, it\nis possible to reconstruct $\\phi$ from ground based and spacecraft\nmeasurements. However, it has been shown previously that $\\phi$ depends not\nonly on the Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) but also on the energy range of\ninterest. We have investigated this energy dependence further, using published\nproton intensity spectra obtained by PAMELA as well as heavier nuclei\nmeasurements from IMP-8 and ACE/CRIS. Our results show severe limitations at\nlower energies including a strong dependence on the solar magnetic epoch. Based\non these findings, we will outline a new tool to describe GCR proton spectra in\nthe energy range from a few hundred MeV to tens of GeV over the last solar\ncycles. In order to show the importance of our modification, we calculate the\nglobal production rates of the cosmogenic radionuclide $^{10}$Be which is a\nproxy for the solar activity ranging back thousands of years.\n", "  Using the framework of category theory, we formalize the heuristic principles\nthat physicists employ in constructing the Hamiltonians for open classical\nsystems as sums of Hamiltonians of subsystems. First we construct a category\nwhere the objects are symplectic manifolds and the morphisms are spans whose\nlegs are surjective Poisson maps. Using a slight variant of Fong's theory of\n\"decorated\" cospans, we then decorate the apices of our spans with\nHamiltonians. This gives a category where morphisms are open classical systems,\nand composition allows us to build these systems from smaller pieces. We repeat\nthis process to construct another category that allows us to study classical\nsystems from a Lagrangian perspective. Finally, using Fong's work, we build a\nsymmetric monoidal functor between the two categories in hopes of studying open\nclassical systems from both a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian perspective.\n", "  Asphaltenes constitute the heaviest, most polar and aromatic fraction of\npetroleum crucial to the formation of highly-stable water- in-crude oil\nemulsions. The latter occur during crude oil production as well as spills and\ncause difficulties to efficient remediation practice. It is thought that in\nnanoaggregate form, asphaltenes create elastic layers around water droplets\nenhancing stability of the emulsion matrix. Ultrasonic characterisation is a\nhigh-resolution non-invasive tool in colloidal analysis shown to successfully\nidentify asphaltene nanoaggregation in toluene. The high sensitivity of\nacoustic velocity to molecular rearrangements and ease in implementation\nrenders it an attractive method to study asphaltene phase properties.\nCurrently, aggregation is thought to correspond to an intersection of two\nconcentration-ultrasonic velocity regressions. Our measurements indicate a\nvariation in the proximity of nanoaggregation which is not accounted for by\npresent models. We attribute this uncertainty to physico-chemical heterogeneity\nof the asphaltene fraction driven by variation in molecular size and propose a\ncritical nanoaggregation region. We treated asphaltenes from North and South\nAmerican crude oils with ruthenium ion catalysed oxidation to characterise\ntheir n-alkyl appendages attached to aromatic cores. Principal component\nanalysis was performed to investigate the coupling between asphaltene\nstructures and velocity measurements and their impact on aggregation.\n", "  Transport networks are crucial to the functioning of natural and\ntechnological systems. Nature features transport networks that are adaptive\nover a vast range of parameters, thus providing an impressive level of\nrobustness in supply. Theoretical and experimental studies have found that\nreal-world transport networks exhibit both tree-like motifs and cycles. When\nthe network is subject to load fluctuations, the presence of cyclic motifs may\nhelp to reduce flow fluctuations and, thus, render supply in the network more\nrobust. While previous studies considered network topology via optimization\nprinciples, here, we take a dynamical systems approach and study a simple model\nof a flow network with dynamically adapting weights (conductances). We assume a\nspatially non-uniform distribution of rapidly fluctuating loads in the sinks\nand investigate what network configurations are dynamically stable. The network\nconverges to a spatially non-uniform stable configuration composed of both\ncyclic and tree-like structures. Cyclic structures emerge locally in a\ntranscritical bifurcation as the amplitude of the load fluctuations is\nincreased. The resulting adaptive dynamics thus partitions the network into two\ndistinct regions with cyclic and tree-like structures. The location of the\nboundary between these two regions is determined by the amplitude of the\nfluctuations. These findings may explain why natural transport networks display\ncyclic structures in the micro-vascular regions near terminal nodes, but\ntree-like features in the regions with larger veins.\n", "  We study the mathematical structure underlying the concept of locality which\nlies at the heart of classical and quantum field theory, and develop a\nmachinery used to preserve locality during the renormalisation procedure.\nViewing renormalisation in the framework of Connes and Kreimer as the algebraic\nBirkhoff factorisation of characters on a Hopf algebra with values in a\nRota-Baxter algebra, we build locality variants of these algebraic structures,\nleading to a locality variant of the algebraic Birkhoff factorisation. This\nprovides an algebraic formulation of the conservation of locality while\nrenormalising.\n  As an application in the context of the Euler-Maclaurin formula on cones, we\nrenormalise the exponential generating function which sums over the lattice\npoints in convex cones. For a suitable multivariate regularisation,\nrenormalisation from the algebraic Birkhoff factorisation amounts to\ncomposition by a projection onto holomorphic multivariate functions.\n", "  We study the nonlocal modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations obtained\nfrom AKNS scheme by Ablowitz-Musslimani type nonlocal reductions. We first find\nsoliton solutions of the coupled mKdV system by using the Hirota direct method.\nThen by using the Ablowitz-Musslimani reduction formulas, we find one-, two-,\nand three-soliton solutions of local and nonlocal complex mKdV and mKdV\nequations. The soliton solutions of these equations are of two types. We give\none-soliton solutions of both types and present only first type of two- and\nthree-soliton solutions. We illustrate our soliton solutions by plotting their\ngraphs for particular values of the parameters.\n", "  The transport of deformable objects including polymer particles, vesicles and\ncells, has been a subject of interest for several decades where the majority of\nexperimental and theoretical studies have been focused on circular tubes. Due\nto advances in microfluidics, there is a need to study the transport of\nindividual deformable particles in rectangular microchannels where corner flows\ncan be important. In this study, we report measurements of hydrodynamic\nmobility of confined polymeric particles, vesicles and cancer cells in a linear\nmicrochannel with square cross-section. Our operating conditions are such that\nthe mobility is measured as a function of geometric confinement over the range\n0.3 < l < 1.5 and at specified particle Reynolds numbers that are within 0.1 <\nRep < 2.5. The experimental mobility data of each of these systems is compared\nwith the circular-tube theory of Hestroni, Haber and Wacholder (J. of Fluid\nMech., 1970) with modifications made for a square cross-section. For polymeric\nparticles, we find that the mobility data agrees well over a large confinement\nrange with the theory but under predicts for vesicles. The mobility of vesicles\nis higher in a square channel than in a circular tube, and does not depend\nsignificantly on membrane mechanical properties. The mobility of cancer cells\nis in good agreement with the theory up to l approaches 0.8, after which it\ndeviates. Comparison of the mobility data of the three systems reveals that\ncancer cells have higher mobility than rigid particles but lower than vesicles,\nsuggesting that the cell membrane frictional properties are in between a\nsolid-like interface and a fluid bilayer. We explain further the differences in\nthe mobility of the three systems by considering their shape deformation and\nsurface flow on the interface. The results of this study may find potential\napplications in drug delivery and biomedical diagnostics.\n", "  The most popular way to produce graphene nowadays is chemical vapor\ndeposition, where, surprisingly, H$_2$ gas is routinely supplied even though it\nis a byproduct itself. In this study, by identifying dominant growing pathways\nvia multiscale simulations, we unambiguously reveal the central role hydrogen\nplayed in graphene growth. Hydrogen can saturate the edges of a growing\ngraphene island to some extent, depending on the H$_2$ pressure. Although\ngraphene etching by hydrogen has been observed in experiment, hydrogen\nsaturation actually stabilizes graphene edges by reducing the detachment rates\nof carbon-contained species. Such a new picture well explains some puzzling\nexperimental observations and is also instrumental in growth protocol\noptimization for two-dimensional atomic crystal van der Waals epitaxy.\n", "  The solar brightness varies on timescales from minutes to decades.\nDetermining the sources of such variations, often referred to as solar noise,\nis of importance for multiple reasons: a) it is the background that limits the\ndetection of solar oscillations, b) variability in solar brightness is one of\nthe drivers of the Earth's climate system, c) it is a prototype of stellar\nvariability which is an important limiting factor for the detection of\nextra-solar planets. Here we show that recent progress in simulations and\nobservations of the Sun makes it finally possible to pinpoint the source of the\nsolar noise. We utilise high-cadence observations from the Solar Dynamic\nObservatory and the SATIRE model to calculate the magnetically-driven\nvariations of solar brightness. The brightness variations caused by the\nconstantly evolving cellular granulation pattern on the solar surface are\ncomputed with the MURAM code. We find that surface magnetic field and\ngranulation can together precisely explain solar noise on timescales from\nminutes to decades, i.e. ranging over more than six orders of magnitude in the\nperiod. This accounts for all timescales that have so far been resolved or\ncovered by irradiance measurements. We demonstrate that no other sources of\nvariability are required to explain the data. Recent measurements of Sun-like\nstars by CoRoT and Kepler uncovered brightness variations similar to that of\nthe Sun but with much wider variety of patterns. Our finding that solar\nbrightness variations can be replicated in detail with just two well-known\nsources will greatly simplify future modelling of existing CoRoT and Kepler as\nwell as anticipated TESS and PLATO data.\n", "  We report a non-perturbative study of the effect of different type of shear\nflows on the evolution of vorticity and particle density fluctuations in\ninterchange turbulence. For the same shear strength, the transport of density\nis less reduced by streamers than by zonal flows, zonal flows leading to\noscillation death. In the inviscid limit, vorticity (density) grows (decays) as\na power law due to streamer or zonal flow, and exponentially due to the\ncombined effect of zonal flow and streamer with the same sign of shear. Zonal\nflow and streamer with the opposite sign of shear lead to oscillation at\nmultiple frequencies.\n", "  An up-to-date overview of the recent history is given, aiming to present a\nhelpful working guide to the literature and at the same time introduce key\nsystems and observational results, starting from the Sun and going towards the\nGalactic Center and parts of the Zona Galactica Incognita, and beyond.\n  We start by presenting an observational view of the Milky Way's disk plane\n(cartographic. dynamical, chemical cross-cut, magnetic). This included the four\nlong spiral arms in the disk of the Milky Way (fig.1), their geometry (fig.2),\ncomponent, velocity (fig.3), their widths and internal layers as well as\nonion-like ordered offsets (fig.4), the central galactic bars, arm tangents,\narm pitch and arm shape, arm origins near the Galactic Center (fig.5), and\nother possible players in the spiral arms, such as the magnetic field (fig.6)\nand the dark matter content.\n  After, we present a basic analysis of some theoretical predictions from\ngalactic arm formation: numerical simulations or analytical theories, and\nobservations are checked against predictions from various numerical simulations\nand analytical (theoretical) models.\n", "  We show that the non-locality recently identified in quantum gravity using\nresummation techniques propagates to the matter sector of the theory. We\ndescribe these non-local effects using effective field theory techniques. We\nderive the complete set of non-local effective operators at order $N G^2$ for\ntheories involving scalar, spinor, and vector fields. We then use recent data\nfrom the Large Hadron Collider to set a bound on the scale of space-time\nnon-locality and find $M_\\star> 3 \\times 10^{-11}$ GeV.\n", "  We reconstruct the whole family of self-adjoint Hamiltonians of\nTer-Martirosyan-- Skornyakov type for a system of two identical fermions\ncoupled with a third particle of different nature through an interaction of\nzero range. We proceed through an operator-theoretic approach based on the\nself-adjoint extension theory of Krein, Visik, and Birman. We identify the\nexplicit Krein-Visik-Birman extension parameter as an operator on the \"space of\ncharges\" for this model (the \"Krein space\") and we come to formulate a sharp\nconjecture on the dimensionality of its kernel. Based on our conjecture, for\nwhich we also discuss an amount of evidence, we explain the emergence of a\nmultiplicity of extensions in a suitable regime of masses and we reproduce for\nthe first time the previous partial constructions obtained by means of an\nalternative quadratic form approach.\n", "  Heavy vector-boson hunting is one of the major analyses undertaken by the\nexperiments carried out at the LHC. I will explore two scenarios which have not\nbeen investigated yet by the experimental collaborations. The first scenario\nconsists in searching for Z' bosons, predicted by U(1)' GUT-inspired models, by\nstudying its supersymmetric decays, leading to resonant final states with\ncharged leptons and missing energy. Afterwards, I shall discuss the 331 model\nand the production of doubly-charged vector bileptons, yielding events with two\nsame-sign lepton pairs at the LHC.\n", "  We study symmetry-enriched topological order in two-dimensional tensor\nnetwork states by using graded matrix product operator algebras to represent\nsymmetry induced domain walls. A close connection to the theory of graded\nunitary fusion categories is established. Tensor network representations of the\ntopological defect superselection sectors are constructed for all domain walls.\nThe emergent symmetry-enriched topological order is extracted from these\nrepresentations, including the symmetry action on the underlying anyons. Dual\nphase transitions, induced by gauging a global symmetry, and condensation of a\nbosonic subtheory, are analyzed and the relationship between topological orders\non either side of the transition is derived. Several examples are worked\nthrough explicitly.\n", "  Emission from the molecular ion H$_3^+$ is a powerful diagnostic of the upper\natmosphere of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, but it remains undetected at\nNeptune. In search of this emission, we present near-infrared spectral\nobservations of Neptune between 3.93 and 4.00 $\\mu$m taken with the newly\ncommissioned iSHELL instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in\nHawaii, obtained 17-20 August 2017. We spent 15.4 h integrating across the disk\nof the planet, yet were unable to unambiguously identify any H$_3^+$ line\nemissions. Assuming a temperature of 550 K, we derive an upper limit on the\ncolumn integrated density of $1.0^{+1.2}_{-0.8}\\times10^{13}$ m$^{-2}$, which\nis an improvement of 30\\% on the best previous observational constraint. This\nresult means that models are over-estimating the density by at least a factor\nof 5, highlighting the need for renewed modelling efforts. A potential solution\nis strong vertical mixing of polyatomic neutral species from Neptune's upper\nstratosphere to the thermosphere, reacting with H$_3^+$, thus greatly reducing\nthe column integrated H$_3^+$ densities. This upper limit also provide\nconstraints on future attempts at detecting H$_3^+$ using the James Webb Space\nTelescope.\n", "  The Henon-Heiles system was originally proposed to describe the dynamical\nbehavior of galaxies, but this system has been widely applied in dynamical\nsystems by exhibit great details in phase space. This work presents the\nformalism to describe Henon-Heiles system and a qualitative approach of\ndynamics behavior. The growth of chaotic region in phase space is observed by\nPoincare Surface of Section when the total energy increases. Island of\nregularity remain around stable points and relevants phenomena appear, such as\nsticky.\n", "  The generation of optical frequency combs via direct electrical pumping of\nsemiconductor lasers is an attractive alternative to the well-established\nmode-locked laser sources in terms of compactness, robustness and\nintegrability. However, the high chromatic dispersion of bulk semiconductor\nmaterials can prevent the generation of frequency combs or lead to undesired\npulse lengthening. In this letter, we present a novel dual waveguide for\nintracavity dispersion compensation in semiconductor lasers. We apply the\nconcept to a short mid-infrared wavelength quantum cascade laser operating in\nthe first atmospheric window (\\lambda $ \\approx$ 4.6 \\mu m). As a result,\nstable comb operation on the full dynamical range is achieved in this device.\nUnlike previously proposed schemes, the dual waveguide approach can be applied\nto various types of semiconductor lasers and material systems. In particular,\nit could enable efficient group velocity dispersion compensation at\nnear-infrared wavelengths where semiconductor materials exhibit a large value\nof that parameter.\n", "  Angular differential imaging (ADI) (Marois et al. 2006) is an observational\ntechnique in high contrast imaging where the telescope is used in pupil\ntracking mode so that the image of the sky rotates with respect to the optical\nsurfaces. Bright \"speckle\" light caused by optical errors remains fixed in the\nimage, while planets and disks rotate with the sky. The resulting dataset is\nthen post-processed to remove the speckles, de-rotated to undo the sky motion,\nand median-collapsed to create a final data product. The postprocessing\nalgorithms to remove the speckles are an active area of research and beyond the\nscope of this note. We consider the derotation and median-combination, where we\nshow gains in signal-to-noise ratio are possible with a small change to the\nalgorithm.\n", "  Fermionic natural occupation numbers do not only obey Pauli's exclusion\nprinciple but are even stronger restricted by so-called generalized Pauli\nconstraints. Whenever given natural occupation numbers lie on the boundary of\nthe allowed region the corresponding $N$-fermion quantum state has a\nsignificantly simpler structure. We recall the recently proposed natural\nextension of the Hartree-Fock ansatz based on this structural simplification.\nThis variational ansatz is tested for the lithium atom. Intriguingly, the\nunderlying mathematical structure yields universal geometrical bounds on the\ncorrelation energy reconstructed by this ansatz.\n", "  This paper continues the cycle of authors' works on the detection of\nprecursors of large flares (M5 and higher classes) in active regions (ARs) of\nthe Sun by their microwave radiation and magnetographic characteristics.\nGeneralization of the detected precursors of strong flares can be used to\ndevelop methods for their prediction. This paper presents an analysis of the\ndevelopment of NOAA AR 12242, in which an X1.8 flare occurred on December 20,\n2014. The analysis is based on regular multiazimuth and multiwavelength\nobservations with the RATAN-600 radio telescope in the range 1.65-10 cm with\nintensity and circular polarization analysis and data from the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO). It was found that a new component appeared in the AR\nmicrowave radiation two days before the X-flare. It became dominant in the AR\nthe day before the flare and significantly decreased after the flare. The use\nof multiazimuth observations from RATAN-600 and observations at 1.76 cm from\nthe Nobeyama Radioheliograph made it possible to identify the radio source that\nappeared before the X-flare with the site of the closest convergence of\nopposite polarity fields near the neutral line in the AR. It was established\nthat the X-flare occurred 20 h after the total gradient of the magnetic field\nof the entire region calculated from SDO/HMI data reached its maximum value.\nAnalysis of the evolution of the microwave source that appeared before the\nX-flare in AR 12242 and comparison of its parameters with the parameters of\nother components of the AR microwave radiation showed that the new source can\nbe classified as neutral line associated source (NLS), which were repeatedly\ndetected by the RATAN-600 and other radio telescopes 1-3 days before the large\nflares.\n", "  The paper deals with the definition of gravitational energy in conformal\nteleparallel gravity. The total energy is defined by means of the field\nequations which allow a local conservation law. Then such an expression is\nanalyzed for a homogeneous and isotropic Universe. This model is implemented by\nthe Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) line element. The energy of the universe\nin the absence of matter is identified with the dark energy, however it can be\nexpanded for curved models defining such an energy as the difference between\nthe total energy and the energy of the perfect fluid which is the matter field\nin the FRW model.\n", "  Exploring and understanding ultrafast processes at the atomic level is a\nscientific challenge. Femtosecond X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is an\nessential experimental probing technic, as it can simultaneously reveal both\nelectronic and atomic structures, and thus unravel their non-equilibrium\ndynamic interplay which is at the origin of most of the ultrafast mechanisms.\nHowever, despite considerable efforts, there is still no femtosecond X-ray\nsource suitable for routine experiments. Here we show that betatron radiation\nfrom relativistic laser-plasma interaction combines ideal features for\nfemtosecond XAS. It has been used to investigate the non-equilibrium transition\nof a copper sample brought at extreme conditions of temperature and pressure by\na femtosecond laser pulse. We measured a rise time of the electron temperature\nbelow 100 fs. This first experiment demonstrates the great potential of the\nbetatron source and paves the way to a new class of ultrafast experiments.\n", "  We present the final observations of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory,\ntaken toward Orion KL, prior to its decommissioning after nearly three decades\nof operation.\n", "  We have investigated PLLA crystallization in lamellae-forming PS-b-PLLA\nconfined to straight cylindrical nanopores under weak confinement (nanopore\ndiameter D / equilibrium PS-b-PLLA period L0 larger than 4.8). Molten PS-b-PLLA\npredominantly forms concentric lamellae along the nanopores, but intertwined\nhelices occur even for D/L0 = 7.3. Quenching PS-b-PLLA melts below TG(PS)\nresults in PLLA cold crystallization strictly confined by the vitrified PS\ndomains. Above TG(PS), PLLA crystallization is templated by the PS-b-PLLA melt\ndomain structure in the nanopore centers, while adsorption on the nanopore\nwalls stabilizes the outermost cylindrical PS-b-PLLA shell. In between, the\nnanoscopic PS-b-PLLA melt domain structure apparently ripens to reduce\nfrustrations transmitted from the outermost immobilized PS-b-PLLA layer. The\nonset of PLLA crystallization catalyzes the ripening while transient ripening\nstates are arrested by advancing PLLA crystallization. Certain helical\nstructure motifs persist PLLA crystallization even if PS is soft. The direction\nof fastest PLLA crystal growth is preferentially aligned with the nanopore axes\nto the same degree as for PLLA homopolymer, independent of whether PS is\nvitreous or soft.\n", "  Nodal-line semimetals (NLSs) represent a new type of topological semimetallic\nbeyond Weyl and Dirac semimetals in the sense that they host closed loops or\nopen curves of band degeneracies in the Brillouin zone. Parallel to the\nclassification of type-I and type-II Weyl semimetals, there are two types of\nNLSs. The conventional NLS phase, in which the two bands forming the nodal line\nhave opposite signs for their slopes along any direction perpendicular to the\nnodal line, has been proposed and realized in many compounds, whereas the\nexotic type-II NLS is very rare. Our first-principles calculations show that\nMg$_3$Bi$_2$ is a material candidate that hosts a single type-II nodal loop\naround $\\Gamma$. The band crossing is close to the Fermi level and the two\ncrossing bands have the same sign in their slopes along the radial direction of\nthe loop, indicating the type-II nature of the nodal line. Spin-orbit coupling\ngenerates only a small energy gap ($\\sim$35 meV) at the nodal points and does\nnot negate the band dispersion of Mg$_3$Bi$_2$ that yields the type-II nodal\nline. Based on this prediction we have synthesized Mg$_3$Bi$_2$ single crystals\nand confirmed the presence of the type-II nodal lines in the material. Our\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements agree well with\nour first-principles results and thus establish Mg$_3$Bi$_2$ as an ideal\nmaterials platform for studying the exotic properties of type-II nodal line\nsemimetals.\n", "  Some recent research of quantum corrections in ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric\ntheories is briefly reviewed. The most attention is paid to the theories\nregularized by higher covariant derivatives. In particular, we discuss, how the\nNSVZ and NSVZ-like relations appear with this regularization and how one can\nconstruct the NSVZ scheme in all orders.\n", "  We report the discovery of a possible symbiotic star, in the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC). The object under consideration here, designated as RP 870, was\ndetected during the course of a comprehensive H$\\alpha$ survey of the LMC by\nReid & Parker (2012). The spectrum of RP 870 showed high ionization emission\nlines of He I, He II and [O III] and molecular absorption bands of TiO\n$\\lambda$$\\lambda$6180, 7100. The collective signatures of a hot component\n(high excitation/ionization lines) and of a cool component (TiO molecular\nbands) are seen in RP 870, from which we propose it as a symbiotic star. Since\nknown symbiotic systems are rare in the LMC, possibly less than a dozen are\nknown, we thought the present detection to be interesting enough to be\nreported.\n", "  Einstein's photo-electric effect allows us to regard electromagnetic waves as\nmassless particles. Then, how is the photon helicity translated into the\nelectric and magnetic fields perpendicular to the direction of propagation?\nThis is an issue of the internal space-time symmetries defined by Wigner's\nlittle group for massless particles. It is noted that there are three\ngenerators for the rotation group defining the spin of a particle at rest. The\nclosed set of commutation relations is a direct consequence of Heisenberg's\nuncertainty relations. The rotation group can be generated by three two-by-two\nPauli matrices for spin-half particles. This group of two-by-two matrices is\ncalled SU(2), with two-component spinors. The direct product of two spinors\nleads to four states leading to one spin-0 state and one spin-1 state with\nthree sub-states. The SU(2) group can be expanded to another group of\ntwo-by-two matrices called SL(2,c), which serves as the covering group for the\ngroup of Lorentz transformations. In this Lorentz-covariant regime, it is\npossible to Lorentz-boost the particle at rest to its infinite-momentum or\nmassless state. Also in this SL(2,c) regime, there are four spin states for\neach particle, as in the case of the Dirac equation. The direct product of two\nSL(2,c) spinors thus leads sixteen states. Among them, four of them can be used\nfor the electromagnetic four-potential, and six for the Maxwell tensor. The\ngauge degree of freedom is shown to be a Lorentz-boosted rotation. The\npolarization of massless neutrinos is interpreted as a consequence of the gauge\ninvariance.\n", "  We use two families of parameters $\\{(\\epsilon_{x_j},\n\\epsilon_{t_j})\\,|\\,\\epsilon_{x_j,t_j}=\\pm1,\\, j=1,2,...,n\\}$ to first\nintroduce a unified novel two-family-parameter system (simply called ${\\mathcal\nQ}^{(n)}_{\\epsilon_{x_{\\vec{n}}},\\epsilon_{t_{\\vec{n}}}}$ system), connecting\nintegrable local, nonlocal, novel mixed-local-nonlocal, and other nonlocal\nvector nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (VNLS) equations. The ${\\mathcal\nQ}^{(n)}_{\\epsilon_{x_{\\vec{n}}}, \\epsilon_{t_{\\vec{n}}}}$ system with\n$(\\epsilon_{x_j}, \\epsilon_{t_j})=(\\pm 1, 1),\\, j=1,2,...,n$ is shown to\npossess Lax pairs and infinite number of conservation laws. Moreover, we also\nanalyze the ${\\mathcal PT}$ symmetry of the Hamiltonians with self-induced\npotentials. The multi-linear forms and some symmetry reductions are also\nstudied. In fact, the used two families of parameters can also be extended to\nthe general case $\\{(\\epsilon_{x_j}, \\epsilon_{t_j}) | \\epsilon_{x_j} =\ne^{i\\theta_{x_j}}, \\epsilon_{t_j} = e^{i\\theta_{t_j}},\\, \\theta_{x_j},\n\\theta_{t_j}\\in [0, 2\\pi),\\, j=1,2,...,n\\}$ to generate more types of nonlinear\nequations. The two-family-parameter idea used in this paper can also be applied\nto other local nonlinear evolution equations such that novel integrable and\nnon-integrable nonlocal and mixed-local-nonlocal systems can also be found.\n", "  Transition to temporal resolution on the order of 1 ps or less raises a\nnumber of questions associated with estimation of the accuracy of the dynamic\nparameters based on the analysis of time-dependent scattering intensity. The\nuse of ultrashort pulses leads to the necessity for increasing the total\nexposure time and lengthening the time of data acquisition. This can be to some\nextent mitigated by increasing the charge per pulse. Increasing in the number\nof electrons, however, is limited by the Coulomb repulsion between them, which\nleads on one hand, to distortion of the diffraction pattern, and the other hand\nto increase the duration of the pulse. The analytical technique for estimating\nthe deformation of the diffraction pattern caused by the Coulomb repulsion of\nthe electrons in the electron bunch with duration of less than 10 ps, and the\ninfluence of this effect on the accuracy of determination of the interatomic\ndistances is developed.\n", "  We introduce a new unified two-parameter $\\{(\\epsilon_x,\n\\epsilon_t)\\,|\\epsilon_{x,t}=\\pm1\\}$ wave model (simply called ${\\mathcal\nQ}_{\\epsilon_x,\\epsilon_t}^{(n)}$ model), connecting integrable local and\nnonlocal vector nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations. The two-parameter\n$(\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_t)$ family also brings insight into a one-to-one\nconnection between four points $(\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_t)$ (or complex numbers\n$\\epsilon_x+i\\epsilon_t$) with $\\{{\\mathcal I}, {\\mathcal P}, {\\mathcal T},\n{\\mathcal PT}\\}$ symmetries for the first time. The ${\\mathcal\nQ}_{\\epsilon_x,\\epsilon_t}^{(n)}$ model with $(\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_t)=(\\pm 1,\n1)$ is shown to possess a Lax pair and infinite number of conservation laws,\nand to be ${\\mathcal PT}$ symmetric. Moreover, the Hamiltonians with\nself-induced potentials are shown to be ${\\mathcal PT}$ symmetric only for\n${\\mathcal Q}_{-1,-1}^{(n)}$ model and to be ${\\mathcal T}$ symmetric only for\n${\\mathcal Q}_{+1,-1}^{(n)}$ model. The multi-linear form and some self-similar\nsolutions are also given for the ${\\mathcal Q}_{\\epsilon_x,\\epsilon_t}^{(n)}$\nmodel including bright and dark solitons, periodic wave solutions, and\nmulti-rogue wave solutions.\n", "  We show that it is in principle possible to construct dualities between\ncommutative and non-commutative theories in a systematic way. This construction\nexploits a generalization of the exact renormalization group equation (ERG). We\napply this to the simple case of the Landau problem and then generalize it to\nthe free and interacting non-canonical scalar field theory. This constructive\napproach offers the advantage of tracking the implementation of the Lorentz\nsymmetry in the non-commutative dual theory. In principle, it allows for the\nconstruction of completely consistent non-commutative and non-local theories\nwhere the Lorentz symmetry and unitarity are still respected, but may be\nimplemented in a highly non-trivial and non-local manner.\n", "  Magnetism defines the complex and dynamic solar corona. Twists and tangles in\ncoronal magnetic fields build up energy and ultimately erupt, hurling plasma\ninto interplanetary space. These coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are transient\nriders on the ever-outflowing solar wind, which itself possesses a\nthree-dimensional morphology shaped by the global coronal magnetic field.\nCoronal magnetism is thus at the heart of any understanding of the origins of\nspace weather at the Earth. However, we have historically been limited by the\ndifficulty of directly measuring the magnetic fields of the corona, and have\nturned to observations of coronal plasma to trace out magnetic structure. This\napproach is complicated by the fact that plasma temperatures and densities vary\namong coronal magnetic structures, so that looking at any one wavelength of\nlight only shows part of the picture. In fact, in some regimes it is the lack\nof plasma that is a significant indicator of the magnetic field. Such a case is\nthe coronal cavity: a dark, elliptical region in which strong and twisted\nmagnetism dwells. I will elucidate these enigmatic features by presenting\nobservations of coronal cavities in multiple wavelengths and from a variety of\nobserving vantages, including unprecedented coronal magnetic field measurements\nnow being obtained by the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP). These\nobservations demonstrate the presence of twisted magnetic fields within\ncavities, and also provide clues to how and why cavities ultimately erupt as\nCMEs.\n", "  Using the $u$-plane integral as a tool, we derive a formula for the partition\nfunction of the simplest nontrivial (topologically twisted) Argyres-Douglas\ntheory on compact, oriented, simply connected, four-manifolds without boundary\nand with $b_2^+>0$. The result can be expressed in terms of classical\ncohomological invariants and Seiberg-Witten invariants. Our results hint at the\nexistence of standard four-manifolds that are not of Seiberg-Witten simple\ntype.\n", "  Analysis of conjugate natural convection with surface radiation in a\ntwo-dimensional enclosure is carried out in order to search the optimal\nlocation of the heat source with entropy generation minimization (EGM) approach\nand conventional heat transfer parameters. The air as an incompressible fluid\nand transparent media is considered the fluid filling the enclosure with the\nsteady and laminar regime. The enclosure internal surfaces are also gray,\nopaque and diffuse. The governing equations with stream function and vorticity\nformulation are solved using finite difference approach. Results include the\neffect of Rayleigh number and emissivity on the dimensionless average rate of\nentropy generation and its optimum location. The optimum location search with\nconventional heat transfer parameters including maximum temperature and Nusselt\nnumbers are also examined.\n", "  In the search for superconductivity in BaAu2Sb2-type monoclinic structure, we\nhave successfully synthesized a new compound BaPt2Bi2, which crystallizes in\nthe space group P21/m (S.G. 11; Pearson symbol mP10) according to a combination\nof powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction and scanning electron\nmicroscopy. Sharp electrical resistivity drop and large diamagnetic\nmagnetization below 2.0 K indicates it owns the superconducting ground state.\nThis makes BaPt2Bi2 the first reported superconductor in mono-clinic\nBaAu2Sb2-type structure, a previously unappreciated structure for\nsuperconductivity. First-principles calculations considering the spin-orbit\ncoupling indicate that Pt-Bi anti-bonding interaction plays a critical role in\ninducing superconductivity.\n", "  We conducted an analysis on dark matter halo properties following major and\nminor mergers to advance our understanding of halo evolution. In this work, we\nanalyzed ~80,000 dark matter halos from the Bolshoi-Planck cosmological\nsimulation and studied halo evolution during relaxation after major mergers,\nthose in which the merging mass ratio m/M > 0.3. We then applied a Gaussian\nfilter to the property evolutions and characterized peak distributions,\nfrequencies, and variabilities for several halo properties, including\ncentering, spin, shape (prolateness), scale radius, and virial ratio. However,\nthere were also halos that experienced relaxation without the presence of major\nmergers. We hypothesized that this was due to minor mergers unrecorded by the\nsimulation analysis. By using property peaks to create a novel merger detection\nalgorithm, we attempted to find minor mergers and match them to the unaccounted\nrelaxed halos. Not only did we find evidence that minor mergers were the\ncauses, but we also found similarities between major and minor merger effects,\nshowing the significance of minor mergers for future studies. Through our dark\nmatter merger statistics, we expect our work to ultimately serve as vital\nparameters towards better understanding galaxy formation and evolution.\n", "  We study the dewetting of liquid films capped by a thin elastomeric layer.\nWhen the tension in the elastomer is isotropic, circular holes grow at a rate\nwhich decreases with increasing tension. The morphology of holes and rim\nstability can be controlled by changing the boundary conditions and tension in\nthe capping film. When the capping film is prepared with a biaxial tension,\nholes form with a non-circular shape elongated along the high tension axis.\nWith suitable choice of elastic boundary conditions, samples can even be\ndesigned such that square holes appear.\n", "  Pentagon is one of the most beautiful geometric structures in nature, but it\nis rarely seen simply because five-fold symmetry is mathematically forbidden in\na 2D or 3D periodic lattices. Fortunately, pentagon as a structural element is\nallowed in 1D or 0D systems, since translational symmetry is not necessary\nthere. However, in these systems pentagons only compose a small portion of the\nstructure. So far, 1D or 0D systems consisting of purely pentagons are still\nrare. Here, combing high resolution non-contact atomic force microscopy and\ntip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, we have directly visualized the pentagon-ring\nstructure in self-assembled Si nanoribbons and magic clusters on Ag(110)\nsubstrate. Moreover, chemical fingerprint of Si pentagon was detected in\nindividual Si nanoribbon and clusters by tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This\nwork demonstrates that Si pentagon can be an important element in building\nsilicon nanostructures, which may find potential applications in future\nnanoelectronics based on silicon.\n", "  As the rapid development of nonlinear optics, the enhancement of optical\nthird harmonic generation becomes a pop research realm in the fields of\nphysics, chemistry, biology, materials science, information science and other\nfields. In this letter, theoretical analysis on double resonance situation in\nmetallic core-shell nanostructure is performed in order to optimize the\nefficiency of third harmonic generation. As plenty of cavity modes ranging from\nvisible area to near infrared can be excited efficiently in core-shell\nnanospheres, kinds of double resonant conditions can be formed by matching two\ndifferent multipolar cavity modes. Numerical simulations show that the third\nharmonic generation (THG) intensity in the far field can be enhanced remarkably\nwhen the THG signal couples well with the high order cavity mode. More\nimportantly, THG efficiency is optimum from the cavity on double resonant\nconditions coupling two modes with the same order. The THG intensity differs up\nto 3 magnitudes on this condition. Subsequent theoretical analysis indicates\nthat changing third-order nonlinear susceptibility of the metal shell while\nkeeping that of the core fixed has almost no effect on THG efficiency. This\nfinding about optimal double resonance has an appreciable effect on optimizing\nTHG in spherical cavity structures.\n", "  Bistable Auxetic Metamaterials (BAMs) are a class of monolithic perforated\nperiodic structures with negative Poisson's ratio. Under tension, a BAM can\nexpand and reach a second state of equilibrium through a globally large shape\ntransformation that is ensured by the flexibility of its elastomeric base\nmaterial. However, if made from a rigid polymer, or metal, BAM ceases to\nfunction due to the inevitable rupture of its ligaments. The goal of this work\nis to extend the unique functionality of the original kirigami architecture of\nBAM to a rigid solid base material. We use experiments and numerical\nsimulations to assess performance, bistability and durability of rigid BAMs at\n10,000 cycles. Geometric maps are presented to elucidate the role of the main\ndescriptors of BAM architecture. The proposed design enables the realization of\nBAM from a large palette of materials, including elastic-perfectly plastic\nmaterials and potentially brittle materials.\n", "  Metasurfaces have the potential to miniaturize and improve the performance of\nany optical element, with applications spanning telecommunications, computing\nand wearable optics. However, the ability to retain functionality over a\ncontinuous, broad range of wavelengths is essential for their widespread\nadoption. So far, efforts to achieve this have been limited to either a\nreflection configuration or operation at wavelengths other than the visible.\nHere, we show that by judicious choice of nanostructures, one can independently\ncontrol both the phase and group delay, leading to broadband transmissive\nachromatic metalenses and metalenses with tunable dispersion across the visible\nspectrum. We demonstrate diffraction-limited broadband focusing and achromatic\nimaging using metalenses across wavelengths from 470 nm to 670 nm, with focal\nlength change of a few percent across this 200 nm bandwidth. This approach\nrequires only a single layer metasurface whose thickness is on the wavelength\nscale, and does not involve spatial multiplexing or cascading.\n", "  Here we use a slow light quantum light-matter interface at room temperature\nto implement an analog simulator of complex relativistic and topological\nphysics. We have realized the famous Jackiw-Rebbi model (JR), the celebrated\nfirst example where relativity meets topology. Our system is based upon\ninteracting dark state polaritons (DSP's) created by storing light in a\nrubidium vapor using a dual-tripod atomic system. The DSP's temporal evolution\nemulates the physics of Dirac spinors and is engineered to follow the JR regime\nby using a linear magnetic field gradient. We also probe the obtained\ntopologically protected zero-energy mode by analyzing the time correlations\nbetween the spinor components. Our implementation paves the way towards quantum\nsimulation of more complex phenomena involving many quantum relativistic\nparticles.\n", "  We present a statistical study on the observed solar radio burst emission\nassociated with the origin of in situ detected solar energetic particles.\nSeveral proton event catalogs in the period 1996$-$2016 are used. At the time\nof appearance of the particle origin (flare and coronal mass ejection) we\nidentified radio burst signatures of types II, III and IV by inspecting dynamic\nradio spectral plots. The information from observatory reports is also\naccounted for during the analysis. The occurrence of solar radio burst\nsignatures is evaluated within selected wavelength ranges during the solar\ncycle 23 and the ongoing 24. Finally, we present the burst occurrence trends\nwith respect to the intensity of the proton events and the location of their\nsolar origin.\n", "  We establish a solvable Heisenberg-Ising model on a spin-1 Ni-containing\npolymer chain, $[Ni (NN'-dmen) (\\mu-N_3)_2]$, with $NN'-dmen$ being\n$NN'-dimethylethylenediamine$, that fully covers the interaction\ncharacteristics of the material and by which, we can characterize all the\npeculiar magnetic features of the polymer, which has been partly studied in\nexperiment. By purely analytical calculations, we can see that the\nmagnetization exhibits three plateaus at zero, mid, and 3/4 of the saturation\nvalue at low temperatures below 2 K. The corresponding featuring peaks of\nmagnetic susceptibility are clearly shown. The model also displays plateaus in\nthermal entanglement that captures the one-to-one correspondence between\nthermal entanglement plateaus and those of the magnetization. The calculations\nare done by the transfer matrix technique.\n", "  Charge-coupled device (CCD), along with the complementary\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), is one of the major imaging technologies.\nTraditional CCDs rely on the charge transfer between potential wells, which\ngives them advantages of simple pixel structure, high sensitivity, and low\nnoise. However, the serial transfer requires fabrication incompatible with\nCMOS, and leads to slower, more complex, and less flexible readout than random\naccess. Here, we report a new-concept CCD called field-effect CCD (FE-CCD),\nwhich is based on the capacitive \"coupling\" between the semiconductor substrate\nand the 2D material. The strong field effect of the 2D material enables\namplification, and non-destructive readout of the integrated charges in one\npixel without transfer. We demonstrated the broadband response of our CCD (up\nto 1870 nm) and the successful integration of 2D hetero-structures for reducing\nthe power consumption. The demonstrated FE-CCD provides a valuable strategy for\nversatile 2D materials to be monolithically integrated into the semiconductor\nimaging technology.\n", "  The evaluation of partonic distributions presents a challenge for QCD, and in\nparticular for its Euclidean lattice realization. Recently, objects called\nquasi-distributions (which become standard distributions in a limit of the\nlongitudinal momentum of the target hadron going to infinity) have been\nproposed. We present a non-perturbative, dynamical evaluation of the quark\nquasi-distribution amplitude (QDA) of the pion in the framework of chiral quark\nmodels (the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and the spectral quark model). We arrive\nat simple but nontrivial analytic expressions, where the dependence on the\nlongitudinal momentum, the momentum fraction, or the transverse-momentum (for\nthe unintegrated objects) can be explicitly assessed. For the parton\ndistribution amplitude (PDA), we carry out the necessary QCD evolution from the\nconstituent quark model scale to higher scales accessible on the lattice, and\ncompare favorably to the LaMET data.\n", "  In this paper we study a particular Painlev\\'e V (denoted ${\\rm P_{V}}$) that\narises from Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) wireless communication systems.\nSuch a $P_V$ appears through its intimate relation with the Hankel determinant\nthat describes the moment generating function (MGF) of the Shannon capacity.\nThis originates through the multiplication of the Laguerre weight or the Gamma\ndensity $x^{\\alpha} {\\rm e}^{-x},\\;x> 0,$ for $\\alpha>-1$ by\n$(1+x/t)^{\\lambda}$ with $t>0$ a scaling parameter. Here the $\\lambda$\nparameter \"generates\" the Shannon capacity, see Yang Chen and Matthew McKay,\nIEEE Trans. IT, 58 (2012) 4594--4634. It was found that the MGF has an integral\nrepresentation as a functional of $y(t)$ and $y'(t)$, where $y(t)$ satisfies\nthe \"classical form\" of $P_V$. In this paper, we consider the situation where\n$n,$ the number of transmit antennas, (or the size of the random matrix), tends\nto infinity, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $P$ tends to infinity, such\nthat $s={4n^{2}}/{P}$ is finite. Under such double scaling the MGF, effectively\nan infinite determinant, has an integral representation in terms of a \"lesser\"\n$P_{III}$. We also consider the situations where $\\alpha=k+1/2,\\;\\;k\\in\n\\mathbb{N},$ and $\\alpha\\in\\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$ $\\lambda\\in\\{1,2,\\dots\\},$ linking\nthe relevant quantity to a solution of the two dimensional sine-Gordon equation\nin radial coordinates and a certain discrete Painlev\\'e-II. From the large $n$\nasymptotic of the orthogonal polynomials, that appears naturally, we obtain the\ndouble scaled MGF for small and large $s$, together with the constant term in\nthe large $s$ expansion. With the aid of these, we derive a number of cumulants\nand find that the capacity distribution function is non-Gaussian.\n", "  The cross section of a top-quark pair produced in association with a photon\nis measured in proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s} = 8$ $\\mathrm{Te\\kern -0.1em V}$ with $20.2$ fb$^{-1}$ of data\ncollected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012. The\nmeasurement is performed by selecting events that contain a photon with\ntransverse momentum $p_\\mathrm{T} > 15\\;\\mathrm{Ge\\kern -0.1em V}$, an isolated\nlepton with large transverse momentum, large missing transverse momentum, and\nat least four jets, where at least one is identified as originating from a\n$b$-quark. The production cross section is measured in a fiducial region close\nto the selection requirements. It is found to be $139 \\pm\n7\\,(\\mathrm{stat.\\!}\\,) \\pm 17\\,(\\mathrm{syst.\\!}\\,)\\,\\mathrm{fb}$, in good\nagreement with the theoretical prediction at next-to-leading order of $151 \\pm\n24$ fb. In addition, differential cross sections in the fiducial region are\nmeasured as a function of the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the\nphoton.\n", "  The variation in local atomic structure and chemical bonding of ZrHx (x=0.15,\n0.30, 1.16) magnetron sputtered thin films are investigated by Zr K-edge (1s)\nX-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine\nstructure spectroscopies. A chemical shift of the Zr K-edge towards higher\nenergy with increasing hydrogen content is observed due to charge-transfer and\nan ionic or polar covalent bonding component between the Zr 4d and the H 1s\nstates with increasing valency for Zr. We find an increase in the Zr-Zr bond\ndistance with increasing hydrogen content from 3.160 {\\AA} in the hexagonal\nclosest-packed metal (alpha-phase) to 3.395 {\\AA} in the understoichiometric\ndelta-ZrHx film (CaF2-type structure) with x=1.16 that largely resembles that\nof bulk delta-ZrH2. For yet lower hydrogen contents, the structures are mixed\nalpha and delta-phases, while sufficient hydrogen loading (x>1) yields a pure\n{\\delta}-phase that is understoichiometric, but thermodynamically stable. The\nchange in the hydrogen content and strain is discussed in relation to the\ncorresponding change of bond lengths, hybridizations, and trends in electrical\nresistivity.\n", "  Carbon materials have a range of properties such as high electrical\nconductivity, high specific surface area, and mechanical flexibility are\nrelevant for electrochemical applications. Carbon materials are utilised in\nenergy conversion-and-storage devices along with electrolytes of complementary\nproperties. In this work, we study the interaction of highly concentrated\nelectrolytes (ionic liquids) at a model carbon surface (circumcoronene) using\ndensity functional theory methods. Our results indicate the decisive role of\nthe dispersion interactions that noticeably strengthen the circumcoronene-ion\ninteraction. Also, we focus on the adsorption of halide anions as the\nelectrolytes containing these ions are promising for practical use in\nsupercapacitors and solar cells.\n", "  The recent detection of the gravitational wave signal GW170817 together with\nan electromagnetic counterpart GRB 170817A from the merger of two neutron stars\nputs a stringent bound on the tensor propagation speed. This constraint can be\nautomatically satisfied in the framework of massive gravity. In this work we\nconsider a general $SO(3)$-invariant massive gravity with five propagating\ndegrees of freedom and derive the conditions for the absence of ghosts and\nLaplacian instabilities in the presence of a matter perfect fluid on the flat\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological background. The\ngraviton potential containing the dependence of three-dimensional metrics and a\nfiducial metric coupled to a temporal scalar field gives rise to a scenario of\nthe late-time cosmic acceleration in which the dark energy equation of state\n$w_{\\rm DE}$ is equivalent to $-1$ or varies in time. We find that the\ndeviation from the value $w_{\\rm DE}=-1$ provides important contributions to\nthe quantities associated with the stability conditions of tensor, vector, and\nscalar perturbations. In concrete models, we study the dynamics of dark energy\narising from the graviton potential and show that there exist viable parameter\nspaces in which neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities are present for both\n$w_{\\rm DE}>-1$ and $w_{\\rm DE}<-1$. We also generally obtain the effective\ngravitational coupling $G_{\\rm eff}$ with non-relativistic matter as well as\nthe gravitational slip parameter $\\eta_s$ associated with the observations of\nlarge-scale structures and weak lensing. We show that, apart from a specific\ncase, the two quantities $G_{\\rm eff}$ and $\\eta_s$ are similar to those in\ngeneral relativity for scalar perturbations deep inside the sound horizon.\n", "  Thin film systems are often analysed by using sputter depth profiling. First\nthe sample gets eroded by inert gas ion impact during sputter depth profiling.\nThen the elemental composition of the freshly unveiled surface is determined by\nusing a surface sensitive analytical method as AES or XPS, for instance. This\nway the depth distributions of the elements are recorded as a function of\nsputter time. The time to record the spectral data in a certain sputter depth\nis kept as short as possible to avoid recontamination of the freshly sputtered\nsurface by adsorption of gas particles from the vacuum during the measurement.\nTherefore in every sputter depth only those spectral regions are recorded,\nwhich belong to the elements expected to be in the sample. But in case the\nsample composition is entirely unknown, it is indispensable to measure wide\nenergy range spectra. By this approach the depth distributions of all elements\nare estimated, which are detectable by the used analytical method. The\nmeasurement of wide energy range spectra during sputter depth profile\nacquisition is promising for samples, which are very insulating. If the surface\npotential varies in different sputter depths, the elemental peaks are shifted\nin an unpredictable way. If wide energy range spectra are recorded, the energy\nscale can be re-adjusted afterwards and the data can be re-evaluated. Both use\ncases are demonstrated exemplarily by sputter depth profile measurements.\n", "  In this presentation, we will focus on a recent applications of the GoSam 2.0\nautomated framework which goes beyond the official scope of this code,\noriginally designed for one-loop fixed order calculations. In particular, we\ndescribe a customized version of GoSam that has been recently employed to study\nthe production of a top-antitop pair in association with a vector boson or with\nthe Higgs boson to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. In the context\nof these calculations, the modified version of GoSam was used to evaluate the\nNLO hard functions which are needed to carry out the resummation of soft gluon\nemission effects. We also briefly comment on the ongoing efforts to generalize\nintegrand reduction and unitarity for higher order calculation, towards the\ngoal of developing efficient alternative computational techniques for the\nevaluation of scattering amplitudes beyond one loop.\n", "  The tip of the red giant branch is one of the widely used distance\nmeasurement methods for the relatively nearby galaxies where the bright\nindividual stars are resolved. Most of the earlier works have used the\nPhotometry in the I-band such as HST ACS/WFC F814W or F850LP for the RGB tip\nmethod. Here we look into the RGB tip magnitudes in J-band such as HST WFC3/IR\nF110W and JWST NIRCam/WF F115W for a wide range of age and metallicity. We find\nthat the J-band (HST WFC3/IR F110W and JWST NIRCam/WF F115W) RGB tip magnitudes\ndo not significantly change compared to that of the I-band (HST ACS/WFC F814W,\nF850LP) for a wide range of metallicity at given age. Moreover, HST WFC3/IR\nF110W RGB tip magnitudes stay constant within 0.005 magnitudes for stellar\npopulations with old ages (age > 5 Gyr) at given metallicity.\n", "  The objective of this computational study is to quantify the influence of\nwall-normal and angular momentum injections in suppressing laminar flow\nseparation over a canonical airfoil. Open-loop control of fully separated,\nincompressible flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil at $\\alpha = 9^\\circ$ and $Re =\n23,000$ is examined with large-eddy simulations. This study independently\nintroduces wall-normal momentum and angular momentum into the separated flow\nusing swirling jets through model boundary conditions. The response of the flow\nfield and the surface vorticity fluxes to various combinations of actuation\ninputs are examined in detail. It is observed that the addition of angular\nmomentum input to wall-normal momentum injection enhances the suppression of\nflow separation. Lift enhancement and suppression of separation with the\nwall-normal and angular momentum inputs are characterized by modifying the\nstandard definition of the coefficient of momentum. The effect of angular\nmomentum is incorporated into the modified coefficient of momentum by\nintroducing a characteristic swirling jet velocity based on the non-dimensional\nswirl number. With this single modified coefficient of momentum, we are able to\ncategorize each controlled flow into separated, transitional, and attached\nflows.\n", "  Community structure is of paramount importance for the understanding of\ncomplex networks. Consequently, there is a tremendous effort in order to\ndevelop efficient community detection algorithms. Unfortunately, the issue of a\nfair assessment of these algorithms is a thriving open question. If the\nground-truth community structure is available, various clustering-based metrics\nare used in order to compare it versus the one discovered by these algorithms.\nHowever, these metrics defined at the node level are fairly insensitive to the\nvariation of the overall community structure. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose to exploit the topological features of the 'community graphs' (where\nthe nodes are the communities and the links represent their interactions) in\norder to evaluate the algorithms. To illustrate our methodology, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of overlapping community detection algorithms using a\nset of real-world networks with known a priori community structure. Results\nprovide a better perception of their relative performance as compared to\nclassical metrics. Moreover, they show that more emphasis should be put on the\ntopology of the community structure. We also investigate the relationship\nbetween the topological properties of the community structure and the\nalternative evaluation measures (quality metrics and clustering metrics). It\nappears clearly that they present different views of the community structure\nand that they must be combined in order to evaluate the effectiveness of\ncommunity detection algorithms.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a simple route to few-optical-cycle pulse\ngeneration from a mid-infrared fiber laser through nonlinear compression of\npulses from a holmium-doped fiber oscillator using a short length of\nchalcogenide fiber and a grating pair. Pulses from the oscillator with 265-fs\nduration at 2.86 {\\mu}m are spectrally broadened through self-phase modulation\nin step-index As2S3 fiber to 141-nm bandwidth and then re-compressed to 70 fs\n(7.3 optical cycles). These are the shortest pulses from a mid-infrared fiber\nsystem to date, and we note that our system is compact, robust, and uses only\ncommercially available components. The scalability of this approach is also\ndiscussed, supported by numerical modeling.\n", "  While determining the stability of an unconstrained elastic structure is a\nstraightforward task, this is not the case for viscoelastic structures.\nSeemingly elastically stable conformations of viscoelastic structures may\ngradually creep until stability is lost, and conversely, creeping does not\nnecessarily imply that a structure will eventually become unstable.\nUnderstanding instabilities in viscoelastic structures requires a more\nintuitive description of viscoelasticity to allow analytical results and\nquantitative predictions. In this work we put forward a metric description of\nviscoelasticity in which the continua is characterized by temporally evolving\nreference lengths with respect to which elastic strains are measured.\nFormulating the three dimensional theory using metric tensors we are able to\npredict which structures will exhibit delayed instability due to viscoelastic\nflow. We also quantitatively describe the viscoelastic relaxation in free\nstanding structures including cases where the relaxation leads to no apparent\nmotion. We demonstrate these results and the power of the metric approach by\nelucidating the subtle mechanism of delayed instability in elastomer shells\nshowing quantitative agreement with experimental measurements.\n", "  The basic and fundamental aspects of General Relativity are in general\nanalysed in mathematical level of coordinate basis or holonomic frame by\nseveral authors in the literature. However, for many purposes it is more\nconvenient to use a general basis, often called in four dimensions, a tetrad or\nvierbein, very useful in a local frame with orthonormal basis or\npseudo-orthonormal basis. This text presents an introduction to non-coordinate\nbasis and the two Cartan's structure equations that are mathematical implements\nin Riemannian geometry that facilitate the calculation of curvature tensors.\nThe purpose of this text is to approach the language and the notation of tetrad\nfield or vierbein with conceptual and calculational details.\n", "  Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe. They seem to be present at\nvirtually all scales and all epochs. Yet, whether the fields on cosmological\nscales are of astrophysical or cosmological origin remains an open major\nproblem. Here we focus on an astrophysical mechanism based on the\nphotoionization of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization.\nBuilding upon previous studies that depicted the physical mechanism around\nisolated sources of ionization, we present here an analytic model to estimate\nthe level at which this mechanism contributed to the magnetization of the whole\nUniverse, thanks to the distribution of sources, before and alongside early\nluminous structure formation. This model suggests that the Universe may be\nglobally magnetized to the order of, at least, a few $10^{-20}$~G comoving\n(i.e. several $10^{-18}$~G during the Epoch of Reionization) by this mechanism,\nprior to any amplification process.\n", "  Within the framework of the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism, we investigate the\nuniversal behavior of the non-equilibrium critical fluctuations, using the\nLangevin dynamics of model A. With properly located typical time, length and\nangle scales, $\\tau_{\\mbox{KZ}}$, $l_{\\mbox{KZ}}$, and $\\theta_{\\mbox{KZ}}$,\nthe constructed functions\n$\\bar{f}_n((\\tau-\\tau_c)/\\tau_{\\mbox{KZ}},\\theta_{\\mbox{KZ}})$ (n=1...4) for\nthe cumulants of the sigma field show universal behavior near the critical\npoint, which are independent from some non-universal factors, such as the\nrelaxation time or the evolution trajectory.\n", "  The completeness of quantum state space, is usually expressed as\n\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty}|m><m|=1, where {|m>} is selected set of quantum states\n(basis). Density matrix |m><m| describes a pure quantum state. In this paper,\nby virtue of the summation method within the normally ordered product of\noperators we propose and show that the completeness relation can also be\nrepresented or partitioned in terms of some mixed states, such as binomial\nstates and negative binomial states. Thus the view on the structure of Fock\nspace is widen and the connotation of Fock space is enriched. See the matter in\nthis sight, experimentalists may have interests to prepare the binomial- and\nnegative binomial states.\n", "  We prove an infinite Ramsey theorem for noncommutative graphs realized as\nunital self-adjoint subspaces of linear operators acting on an infinite\ndimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, we prove that if V is such a subspace,\nthen provided there is no obvious obstruction, there is an infinite rank\nprojection P with the property that the compression PVP is either maximal or\nminimal in a certain natural sense.\n", "  Carbon nanoonions are novel carbon nanoestructures that have potential\napplications in fields like electronics and chemical catalysis. Here we report\na very simple but effective method of purifying carbon nanoonions produced by\nsubmerged arc discharge in water based on the water-toluene liquid-liquid\nextraction. Purified and non-purified samples were characterized by atomic\nforce microscopy, high resolution transmission electronic microscopy and\nBrunauer-Emmett-Teller gas adsorption isotherms method. Microscopy results\nshowed a good purification and allowed the assessment of the particles diameter\ndistribution. Specific surface area was measured showing a great increment from\n(14.7 +- 0.3) m2/g for the non-purified sample to (170 +- 3) m2/g for the\npurified sample. Average particles diameter was also assessed from the\nadsorption isotherms; the diameter values obtained by the three techniques were\nin good agreement being between 20 to 30 nm.\n", "  In this paper, we consider three types of polynomial equations in quantum\ncomputer: linear divisibility equation, which belongs to a special type of\nbinary-quadratic Diophantine equation; quadratic congruence equation with\nrestriction in the solution and exponential congruence equation in finite\nfield. Quantum algorithms based on Grover's algorithm and Shor's algorithm to\nthese problems are given. As for the exponential congruence equation, which has\nbeen considered by Dam and Shparlinski \\cite{dam} at 2008, a relatively simple\nquantum algorithm is given here. And some other results and generalizations are\ndiscovered.\n", "  The numerical version of the Hamilton-Jacobi quantization method, recently\nproposed, is applied to the one dimensional quartic oscillator. A suitable\nquantization condition is formulated and various energy levels and wave\nfunctions are computed. The results very well agree with those obtained by\nmeans of the Schroedinger equation, and confirm that the Quantum Hamilton\nJacobi approach, which is the exact version of the semiclassical WKB scheme, is\na self-contained quantization procedure, equivalent and independent from the\nSchoedinger's one but more general. Indeed, with respect to this latter, the\nQuantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation can be used to investigate the limit h->0,\nwhere the Schroedinger equation loses its significance, and explains how the\nfundamental quantities of the classical mechanics, the Hamilton's\ncharacteristic function and the classical momentum, are generated from the\ncorresponding quantum ones.\n", "  [not part of RNAAS note] We report the discovery of WISE J000100.45+065259.6\nas a very low mass star/brown dwarf spectral binary candidate, on the basis of\nlow resolution near-infrared spectroscopy obtained with IRTF/SpeX.\nDecomposition of the spectrum indicates component types of M8.5+T5 with a\npredicted $\\Delta{J}$ = 3.5. As the majority of confirmed spectral binary\ncandidates to date are very closely-separated systems ($\\rho$ $\\lesssim$ 3 AU;\n$P$ $\\lesssim$ 15~yr), this source may provide mass measurements across the\nhydrogen burning limit within the decade.\n", "  The thermo-electrical properties of a complex silicon cantilever structure\nused in thermal scanning probe lithography are modeled based on well\nestablished empirical laws for the thermal conductivity in silicon, the\nelectrical conductivity in the degenerate silicon support structure, and a\ncomprehensive physical model of the electrical conductivity in the low-doped\nheater structure. The model calculations are performed using a set of\nphysically well defined material parameters and finite element methods to solve\nthe coupled thermal and electrical diffusion equations in the cantilever. The\nmaterial parameters are determined from a non-linear regression fit of the\nnumerical results to corresponding measured data which also includes Raman\nmeasurements of the heater temperature. Excellent agreement between predicted\nand measured data in the absence of air cooling is obtained if a tapered doping\nprofile in the heater is used. The heat loss through the surrounding air is\nalso studied in a parameter free three-dimensional simulation. The simulation\nreveals that the heater temperature can be accurately predicted from the\nelectrical power supplied to the cantilever via a global scaling of the power\nin the power-temperature correlation function which can be determined from the\nvacuum simulation.\n", "  The importance of being able to verify quantum computation delegated to\nremote servers increases with recent development of quantum technologies. In\nsome of the proposed protocols for this task, a client delegates her quantum\ncomputation to non-communicating servers. The fact that the servers do not\ncommunicate is not physically justified and it is essential for the proof of\nsecurity of such protocols. For the best of our knowledge, we present in this\nwork the first verifiable delegation scheme where a classical client delegates\nher quantum computation to two entangled servers that are allowed to\ncommunicate, but respecting the plausible assumption that information cannot be\npropagated faster than speed of light. We achieve this result by proposing the\nfirst one-round two-prover game for the Local Hamiltonian problem where provers\nonly need polynomial time quantum computation and access to copies of the\ngroundstate of the Hamiltonian.\n", "  Recently, experimental collaborations have reported $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ upper\nlimits on the signal strength of four-top production at the LHC, which already\nleads to competitive constraints on certain type of top-quark operators. On the\nother hand, developments in the $b$-jet charge tagging algorithms open up new\npossibilities for the direct measurement of the top-quark width. In this talk,\nwe briefly discuss some recent studies in these two directions.\n", "  Very recently, it has been shown that vanadium dichalcogenides (VX$_2$, X=S,\nSe and Te) monolayers show intrinsic ferromagnetism, and their critical\ntemperatures are nearly to or beyond room temperature. Hence, they would have\nwide potential applications in next-generation nanoelectronic and spintronic\ndevices. In this work, being inspired by a recent study we systematically\nperform Monte Carlo simulations based on single-site update Metropolis\nalgorithm to investigate the hysteresis features of VX$_2$ monolayers for a\nwide range of temperatures up to 600 K. Our simulation results indicate that,\nboth remanence and coercivity values tend to decrease with increasing\ntemperature. Furthermore, it is found that hysteresis curves start to evolve\nfrom rectangular at the lower temperature regions to nearly S-shaped with\nincreasing temperature.\n", "  The tilt method applied to models of growing interfaces is a useful tool to\ncharacterize the nonlinearities of their associated equation. Growing\ninterfaces with average slope $m$, in models and equations belonging to\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, have average saturation velocity\n$\\mathcal{V}_\\mathrm{sat}=\\Upsilon+\\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda\\,m^2$ when $|m|\\ll 1$.\nThis property is sufficient to ensure that there is a nonlinearity type square\nheight-gradient. Usually, the constant $\\Lambda$ is considered equal to the\nnonlinear coefficient $\\lambda$ of the KPZ equation. In this paper, we show\nthat the mean square height-gradient $\\langle |\\nabla h|^2\\rangle=a+b \\,m^2$,\nwhere $b=1$ for the continuous KPZ equation and $b\\neq 1$ otherwise, e.g.\nballistic deposition (BD) and restricted-solid-on-solid (RSOS) models. In order\nto find the nonlinear coefficient $\\lambda$ associated to each system, we\nestablish the relationship $\\Lambda=b\\,\\lambda$ and we test it through the\ndiscrete integration of the KPZ equation. We conclude that height-gradient\nfluctuations as function of $m^2$ are constant for continuous KPZ equation and\nincreasing or decreasing in other systems, such as BD or RSOS models,\nrespectively.\n", "  The Polarized Electrons for Polarized Positrons (PEPPo) experiment has\ndemonstrated the efficient transfer of polarization from electrons to positrons\nproduced by the bremsstrahlung radiation of a polarized electron beam in a\nhigh-$Z$ target. Positron polarization up to 82\\% has been measured for an\ninitial electron beam momentum of 8.19 MeV/$c$, limited only by the electron\nbeam polarization. Combined with the high intensity and high polarization\nperformances of polarized electron sources, this technique extends efficient\npolarized positron capabilities from GeV to MeV electron accelerators. This\npresentation reviews the PEPPo proof-of-principle experiment and addresses the\nperspectives for future applications.\n", "  The head-on collision of ion-acoustic solitary waves in a collisionless\nplasma with cold ions and Boltzmann electrons is studied. It is shown that\nsolitary waves of sufficiently large amplitudes do not retain their identity\nafter a collision. Their amplitudes decrease and their forms change.\nDependences of amplitudes of the potential and densities of ions and electrons\nafter a head-on collision of identical solitary waves on their initial\namplitude are presented.\n", "  Infrared-Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense regions of high (optical and\ninfrared) extinction, believed to be the birthplace of high-mass stars and\nstellar clusters. The physical mechanisms leading to the formation of these\nIRDCs are not completely understood and it is thus important to study their\nmolecular gas kinematics and chemical content to search for any signature of\nthe IRDCs formation process. Using the 30m-diameter antenna at the Instituto de\nRadioastronom\\'ia Milim\\'etrica, we have obtained emission maps of dense gas\ntracers (H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and HN$^{13}$C) and typical shock tracers (SiO and\nCH$_3$OH) toward three IRDCs, G028.37+00.07, G034.43+00.24 and G034.77-00.55\n(clouds C, F and G, respectively). We have studied the molecular gas kinematics\nin these clouds and, consistent with previous works toward other IRDCs, the\nclouds show complex gas kinematics with several velocity-coherent\nsub-structures separated in velocity space by a few km s$^{-1}$. Correlated\nwith these complex kinematic structures, widespread (parsec-scale) emission of\nSiO and CH$_3$OH is present in all the three clouds. For clouds C and F, known\nto be actively forming stars, widespread SiO and CH$_3$OH is likely associated\nwith on-going star formation activity. However, for cloud G, which lacks either\n8 $\\mu$m or 24 $\\mu$m sources and 4.5 $\\mu$m H$_2$ shock-excited emission, the\ndetected widespread SiO and CH$_3$OH emission may have originated in a\nlarge-scale shock interaction, although a scenario involving a population of\nlow-mass stars driving molecular outflows cannot be fully ruled out.\n", "  The latest CDF and D0 experiment measurements of the top quark properties\nexcept the top quark mass are presented. The final combination of the CDF and\nD0 forward-backward asymmetry measurements is shown together with the D0\nmeasurements of the inclusive top quark pair cross-section as well as the top\nquark polarization.\n", "  We present a determination of the mass, width and coupling of the strange\nresonances appearing in pion-kaon scattering below 1.8 GeV, namely the much\ndebated $K^*_0(800)$ or $\\kappa$, the scalar $K^*_0(1430)$, the $K^*(892)$ and\n$K^*(1410)$ vectors, the spin-two $K^*_2(1430)$ as well as the spin-three\n$K^*_3(1780)$. The parameters of each resonance are determined using a direct\nanalytic continuation of the pion-kaon partial waves by means of Pad\\'e\napproximants, thus avoiding any particular model description of their pole\npositions and residues, while taking into account the analytic requirements\nimposed by dispersion relations.\n", "  We study the hadron properties at finite temperature from measurement of the\nscreening masses, using two-flavor full QCD of the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC)\nalgorithm with the renormalization group improved Iwasaki gauge action and the\nclover improved Wilson quark action on a $16^3 \\times 4$ lattice. We explore\nrather heavy quark mass regions. Disconnected quark diagram is dropped. We\nobserve the tendency that the screening masses in all the channels degenerate,\nwhich is in accord with the effective restoration of U$_{\\rm A}$(1) symmetry,\nand then eventually approach 2$\\pi T$, i.e. the free quark value. In the low\ntemperature region below pseudocritical temperature $T_c$, the screening masses\nin all the channels decrease. We discuss the different features between these\ncalculations and the previous ones.\n", "  Nowadays the Science progress depends on the numerical calculus, due to the\npossibility of obtention of solutions using simulations which would be\nimpracticable, or even impossible, to be analitically obtained. In this aspect,\nit becomes important to dominate the fundamental tools of numerical calculus\napplied to some programming language, Fortran for example. In this work we\npresented few basic concepts of the Fortran 77. We show how this concepts can\nbe applied in the simulation and analysis of physical systems, trying to offer\na first contact, a guide, with this programming language. We presented the\nconstruction of routines that model the behavior of spring-mass system,\ntrigonometric functions and a more complex system, the standart map. We\npresented a discussion about meaningful learning involving physical concepts\nand programming in Fortran.\n", "  Data from a multi-parametric MRI study of patients with possible early-stage\nprostate cancer was assessed with a view to creating an efficient clinical\nprotocol. Based on a correlation analysis suggesting that diffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) scores are more strongly correlated with overall PIRADS scores\nthan other modalities such as dynamic contrast enhanced imaging or\nspectroscopy, we investigate the combination of T2-weighted imaging (T2w) and\nDWI as a potential diagnostic tool for prostate cancer detection, staging and\nguided biopsies. Quantification of the noise floor in the DWI images and\ncareful fitting of the data suggests that the mono-exponential model provides a\nvery good fit to the data and there is no evidence of non-Gaussian diffusion\nfor $b$-values up to 1000 s/mm$^2$. This precludes the use of kurtosis or other\nnon-Gaussian measures as a biomarker for prostate cancer in our case. However,\nthe ADC scores for healthy and probably malignant regions are significantly\nlower for the latter in all 20 but one patient. The results suggest that a\nsimplified mp-MRI protocol combining T2w and DWI may be a good compromise for a\ncost and time efficient, early-stage prostate cancer diagnostic programme,\ncombining robust MR biomarkers for prostate cancer that can be reliably\nquantified and appear well-suited for general clinical practice.\n", "  Capillary phenomena are involved in many industrial processes, especially\nthose dealing with composite manufacturing. However, their modelling is still\nchallenging. Therefore, a finite element setting is proposed to better\ninvestigate this complex issue. The variational formulation of a liquid-air\nStokes system is established, while the solid substrate is described through\nboundary conditions. Expressing the weak form of Laplace's law over liquid-air,\nliquid-solid and air-solid interfaces, leads to a natural enforcement of the\nmechanical equilibrium over the wetting line, without imposing explicitly the\ncontact angle itself. The mechanical problem is discretized by using finite\nelements, linear both in velocity and pressure, stabilized with a variational\nmultiscale method, including the possibility of enrichment of the pressure\nspace. The moving interface is captured by a Level-Set methodology, combined\nwith a mesh adaptation technique with respect to both pressure and level-set\nfields. Our methodology can simulate capillary-driven flows in 2D and 3D with\nthe desired precision: droplet spreading, droplet coalescence, capillary rise.\nIn each case, the equilibrium state expected in terms of velocity, pressure and\ncontact angle is reached.\n", "  Various of the single scale quantities in massless and massive QCD up to\n3-loop order can be expressed by iterative integrals over certain classes of\nalphabets, from the harmonic polylogarithms to root-valued alphabets. Examples\nare the anomalous dimensions to 3-loop order, the massless Wilson coefficients\nand also different massive operator matrix elements. Starting at 3-loop order,\nhowever, also other letters appear in the case of massive operator matrix\nelements, the so called iterative non-iterative integrals, which are related to\nsolutions based on complete elliptic integrals or any other special function\nwith an integral representation that is definite but not a Volterra-type\nintegral. After outlining the formalism leading to iterative non-iterative\nintegrals,we present examples for both of these cases with the 3-loop anomalous\ndimension $\\gamma_{qg}^{(2)}$ and the structure of the principle solution in\nthe iterative non-interative case of the 3-loop QCD corrections to the\n$\\rho$-parameter.\n", "  We use the one-dimensional object-oriented particle-in-cell Monte Carlo\ncollision code oopd1 to explore the charged particle densities, the\nelectronegativity, the electron energy probability function (EEPF), and the\nelectron heating mechanism in a single frequency capacitively coupled oxygen\ndischarge when the applied voltage amplitude is varied. We explore discharges\noperated at 10 mTorr, where electron heating within the plasma bulk (the\nelectronegative core) dominates, and at 50 mTorr where sheath heating\ndominates. At 10 mTorr the discharge is operated in combined drift-ambipolar\n(DA) and $\\alpha$-mode and at 50 mTorr it is operated in pure $\\alpha$-mode. At\n10 mTorr the effective electron temperature is high and increases with\nincreased driving voltage amplitude, while at 50 mTorr the effective electron\ntemperature is much lower, in particular within the electronegative core, where\nit is roughly 0.2 - 0.3 eV, and varies only a little with the voltage\namplitude.\n", "  Modern nanoscience has focused on two-dimensional (2D) layer structure\nmaterials which have garnered tremendous attention due to their unique\nphysical, chemical and electronic properties since the discovery of graphene in\n2004. Recent advancement in graphene nanotechnology opens a new avenue of\ncreating 2D bilayer graphene (BLG) intercalates. Using first-principles DFT\ntechniques, we have designed 20 new materials \\textit{in-silico} by\nintercalating first row transition metals (TMs) with BLG, i.e. 10 layered\nstructure and 10 bulk crystal structures of TM intercalated in BLG. We\ninvestigated the equilibrium structure and electronic properties of layered and\nbulk structure BLG intercalated with first row TMs (Sc-Zn). The present DFT\ncalculations show that the 2$p_z$ sub-shells of C atoms in graphene and the\n3$d_{yz}$ sub-shells of the TM atoms provide the electron density near the\nFermi level controlling the material properties of the BLG-intercalated\nmaterials. This article highlights how the Dirac point moves in both the BLG\nand bulk-BLG given a different TM intercalated materials. The implications of\ncontrollable electronic structure and properties of intercalated BLG-TM for\nfuture device applications are discussed. This work opens up new avenues for\nthe efficient production of two-dimensional and three-dimensional carbon-based\nintercalated materials with promising future applications in nanomaterial\nscience.\n", "  The aim of the paper is to derive spectral estimates on the eigenvalue\nmoments of the magnetic Schroedinger operators defined on the two-dimensional\ndisk with a radially symmetric magnetic field and radially symmetric electric\npotential.\n", "  There is studied problem on solvability of linear non-homogeneous\ndifferential equation of higher even order. There is proved the theorem on\nnecessary and sufficient conditions on existence of solutions to the equation\nin the Schwartz space.\n", "  ATLAS has made several measurements of the top quark mass using proton-proton\ncollision data recorded in 2012 at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 8\nTeV. Those summarised here include an indirect determination of the top quark\npole mass from lepton differential cross-sections; previous direct measurements\nof the top quark mass in the $t\\bar{t}\\to\\textrm{dilepton}$ and\n$t\\bar{t}\\to\\textrm{all-jets}$ decay channels as well as in the $t$-channel of\nsingle-top-quark production; and lastly, the new direct measurement of the top\nquark mass in the $t\\bar{t}\\to\\textrm{lepton+jets}$ decay channel and its\ncombination with previous measurements.\n", "  Most properties of liquid water are determined by its hydrogen-bond network.\nBecause forming an aqueous interface requires termination of this network, one\nmight expect the molecular level properties of interfacial water to markedly\ndiffer from water in bulk. Intriguingly, much prior experimental and\ntheoretical work has found that, from the perspective of their time-averaged\nstructure and picosecond structural dynamics, hydrogen-bonded OH groups at an\nair/water interface behave the same as hydrogen-bonded OH groups in bulk liquid\nwater. Here we report the first experimental observation of interfacial water's\nlibration (i.e. frustrated rotation) using the laser-based technique\nvibrational sum frequency spectroscopy. We find this mode has a frequency of\n834 cm$^{-1}$, $\\approx 165$ cm$^{-1}$ higher than in bulk liquid water at the\nsame temperature and similar to bulk ice. Because libration frequency is\nproportional to the stiffness of water's rotational potential, this increase\nsuggests that one effect of terminating bulk water's hydrogen bonding network\nat the air/water interface is retarding rotation of water around intact\nhydrogen bonds. Because in bulk liquid water the libration plays a key role in\nstabilizing reaction intermediates and dissipating excess vibrational energy,\nwe expect the ability to probe this mode in interfacial water to open new\nperspectives on the kinetics of heterogeneous reactions at aqueous interfaces.\n", "  Within the general context of the architecture in quantum computer design,\nthis paper aims is to provide a general strategy to obtain a block-matrix\nrepresentation of quantum gates applied to qubits placed in arbitrary positions\nover an arbitrary dimensional input state. The model is also extended to the\nframework of quantum computation with qudits. An application in the context of\nthe quantum computational logic is provided.\n", "  Dimer algebras arise from a particular type of quiver gauge theory. However,\npart of the input to such a theory is the gauge group, and this choice may\nimpose additional constraints on the algebra. If the gauge group of a dimer\ntheory is abelian, then the algebra that arises is not actually the dimer\nalgebra itself, but a particular quotient we introduce called the 'homotopy\nalgebra'. We show that a homotopy algebra $\\Lambda$ on a torus is a dimer\nalgebra if and only if it is noetherian, and otherwise $\\Lambda$ is the\nquotient of a dimer algebra by homotopy relations. Stated in physics terms, a\ndimer theory is superconformal if and only if the corresponding dimer and\nhomotopy algebras coincide. We also give an explicit description of the center\nof a homotopy algebra in terms of a special subset of its perfect matchings. In\nour proofs we introduce formalized notions of Higgsing and the mesonic chiral\nring from quiver gauge theory.\n", "  Dynamical heterogeneity (DH) in non-equilibrium systems is a topic of\nprofound interest yet an open question. In a model system of constantly driven\noppositely charged binary colloidal suspension, we explore DH in a model\nlane-forming system using BD simulations. We show that the system undergoes\nstructural and dynamical cross-over using spatio-temporal correlation\nfunctions. For small field, the structural relaxation is homogeneous while it\nis heterogeneous for sufficiently high field. In order to explore the\nheterogeneity, we track and tag the particles to compute partial structures\nthat relax at different rates, in which heterogeneity has its maximum in the\nintermediate state.\n", "  We analyze and compare the angular deviations for an optical beam reflected\nby and transmitted through a dielectric triangular prism. The analytic\nexpressions derived for the angular deviations hold for arbitrary incidence\nangles. For incidence approaching the internal and external Brewster angles,\nthe angular deviations transverse magnetic waves present the same behavior\nleading to the well-known giant Goos-Haenchen angular shift. For incidence near\nthe critical angle a new region of large shift is seen both for transverse\nmagnetic and transverse electric waves. While a direct measuring procedure is\nbetter in the vicinity of the Brewster region, a weak measurement breaks off\nthe giant Goos-Haenchen effect, preserving the amplification in the critical\nregion. We discuss under which conditions it is possible to optimize the\namplification and we also determine when a weak measurement is preferred to a\ndirect measuring procedure.\n", "  The ternary intermetallic compound Gd$_2$Cu$_2$In crystallizes in\nMo$_2$Fe$_2$B type structure with the space group $P4/mbm$ and we study\ncritical behaviour and magnetocaloric effect near the ferromagnetic transition\n($T_C$ $\\approx$ 94 K) using the magnetic and heat capacity measurements. The\nmaximum entropy change ($\\Delta S_m$) and adiabatic temperature change ($\\Delta\nT_{ad}$) for the field value of 7 T were observed to be 13.8 J/kg.K and 6.5 K\nrespectively. We have employed modified Arrott plot (MAP), Kouvel-Fisher (KF)\nprocedures to estimate the critical exponents near the FM-PM phase transition.\nCritical exponents $\\beta$ = 0.312(2), $\\gamma$ = 1.080(5) are\nself-consistently estimated from the non-linear fitting. The $\\beta$ value is\nclose to the three dimensional (3D) Ising model where as $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$\nvalues are close to mean field model. The estimated critical exponents for\nGd$_2$Cu$_2$In suggest that the system may belong to different universal class.\nAll the three critical exponent obey Widom scale and collapse the scaled\nmagnetic isotherms into two distinct branches below and above $T_C$ in\naccordance with single scaling equation. Specific heat measurements show a\n$\\lambda$ type peak near 94 K confirming the bulk magnetic ordering. The data\nnear $T_C$ was fitted using the non-linear function $C_{P} = B + C\\epsilon +\nA^{\\pm}|\\epsilon|^{-\\alpha}(1 + E^{\\pm} |\\epsilon|^{0.5})$ between\n-0.025$<\\epsilon<$0.025 which yielded the fourth critical exponent $\\alpha$\nvalue to be 0.11 (3). The value indicates possible 3D-Ising behavior where\nGd$^{3+}$ moments arranged uniaxially along long tetragonel axis 'c' as\nreported in literature.\n", "  Entropy relates the fast, microscopic behaviour of the elements in a system\nto its slow, macroscopic state. We propose to use it to explain how, as\ncomplexity theory suggests, small scale decisions of individuals form cities.\nFor this, we offer the first interpretation of entropy for cities that reflects\ninteractions between different places through interdependently linked states in\na multiscale approach. With simulated patterns we show that structural\ncomplexity in spatial systems can be the most probable configuration if the\nelements of a system interact across multiple scales. In the case study that\nobserves the distribution of functions in West London from 1875 to 2005, we can\npartly explain the observed polycentric sprawl as a result of higher entropy\ncompared to spatially random spread, compact mixed use growth or fully\nsegregated patterns. This work contributes to understanding why cities are\nmorphologically complex, and describes a consistent relationship between\nentropy and complexity that accounts for contradictions in the literature.\nFinally, because we evaluate the constraints urban morphology imposes on\npossible ways to use the city, the general framework of thinking could be\napplied to adjust urban plans to the uncertainty of underlying assumptions in\nplanning practice.\n", "  The catastrophe theory, an effective method for the description of phase\ntransitions, is applied to the Semimicroscopic Algebraic Cluster Model (SACM)\nas an example of a non-trivial theory. The ground state and excited, rotational\nphase transitions are investigated. A short introduction to the SACM and the\ncatastrophe theory is given. We apply the formalism to the test case of\n16O+alpha-->20Ne.\n", "  We demonstrate an all-optical four-channel wavelength multicasting in a\ncoupled Silicon microring resonator system. The scheme is based on two-photon\nabsorption induced free carrier dispersion in Silicon. The coupled cavity\nfacilitates resonance splitting that is utilized as individual channels for\nmulticasting. Using the split resonances, we achieve an aggregate multicasted\ndata rate of 48 Gbps (4X12 Gbps). Moreover, we also present a detailed analysis\nand performance of the multicasting architecture.\n", "  We present a simplified model of the outer heliosheath to help interpret the\nobservations of interstellar neutral helium by the IBEX-Lo instruments. We\nassume that the measured particles are composed of the superposition of a\nprimary beam population, with the properties of the local interstellar medium,\nand a secondary population, created by charge exchange between the primary beam\nneutrals and the ions that have been deflected as they approach the heliopause.\nWe extract information on the large-scale shape of the heliopause by comparing\nthe helium flux measured at IBEX along four different look directions with\nsimple models of deflected plasma flow around hypothetical obstacles of\ndifferent aspect ratios to the flow. As a first step in this paper, we model\nthe deflected plasma flow with the analytical solutions for compressible gas\nflow around a series of oblate ellipsoidal obstacles. Our comparisons between\nthe model results and the observations indicate that the heliopause is very\nblunt in the vicinity of the heliospheric nose, especially compared to a\nRankine half-body or cometary shape. The upstream heliopause seems to be highly\nelongated in the directions parallel to the interstellar magnetic field, and\nrelatively more compact and symmetric in the directions transverse to that\nfield. The IBEX-Lo helium observations are not consistent with a heliopause\nelongated in directions parallel to the solar rotation axis.\n", "  Thermal shifts and fluctuations at finite temperature below the deconfinement\ncrossover of QCD from hadronic matter to the Quark-Gluon Plasma provide a\nviable way to look for exotic and missing states with given quantum numbers in\nthe hadronic spectrum. We study a realization of the Hadron Resonance Gas model\nin the light quark ($uds$) flavor sector of QCD to study: i) the entropy\nshifts, and ii) the fluctuations of electric charge, baryon number and\nstrangeness; and extract from them the possible existence of missing and exotic\nstates from a comparison with lattice data. The analysis of the entropy shift\nbased on the free energy of the Polyakov loop suggests the existence of exotic\nhybrids $g q \\bar q$ and $gqqq$.\n", "  We study finite but growing principal square submatrices $A_n$ of the one- or\ntwo-sided infinite Fibonacci Hamiltonian $A$. Our results show that such a\nsequence $(A_n)$, no matter how the points of truncation are chosen, is always\nstable -- implying that $A_n$ is invertible for sufficiently large $n$ and\n$A_n^{-1}\\to A^{-1}$ pointwise.\n", "  This Report summarizes some of the activities of the HiggsTools Initial\nTraining Network working group in the period 2015-2017. The main goal of this\nworking group was to produce a document discussing various aspects of\nstate-of-the-art Higgs physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in a\npedagogic manner.\n  The first part of the Report is devoted to a description of phenomenological\nsearches for New Physics at the LHC. As the experimental measurements become\nmore and more precise, there is a pressing need for a consistent framework in\nwhich deviations from the SM predictions can be computed precisely. We\ncritically review the use of the \\k{appa}-framework, fiducial and simplified\ntemplate cross sections, effective field theories, pseudo-observables and\nphenomenological Lagrangians.\n  In the second part of the Report, we propose $\\varphi_{\\eta}^*$ as a new and\ncomplementary observable for studying Higgs boson production at large\ntransverse momentum in the case where the Higgs boson decays to two photons. We\nmake a detailed study of the phenomenology of the $\\varphi_{\\eta}^*$ variable,\ncontrasting the behaviour with the Higgs transverse momentum distribution using\na variety of theoretical tools including event generators and fixed order\nperturbative computations.\n", "  We introduce a multi-scale diagonalization scheme to study the transition\nbetween the many-body localized and the ergodic phase in disordered quantum\nchains. The scheme assumes a sharp dichotomy between subsystems that behave as\nlocalized and resonant spots that obey the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis\n(ETH). We establish a set of microscopic principles defining the\ndiagonalization scheme, and use them to numerically study the transition in\nvery large systems. To a large extent the results are in agreement with an\nanalytically tractable mean-field analysis of the scheme: We find that at the\ncritical point the system is almost surely localized in the thermodynamic\nlimit, hosting a set of thermal inclusions whose sizes are power-law\ndistributed. On the localized side the {\\em typical} localization length is\nbounded from above. The bound saturates upon approach to criticality, entailing\nthat a finite ergodic inclusion thermalizes a region of diverging diameter. The\ndominant thermal inclusions have a fractal structure, implying that averaged\ncorrelators decay as stretched exponentials throughout the localized phase.\nSlightly on the ergodic side thermalization occurs through an avalanche\ninstability of the nearly localized bulk, whereby rare, supercritically large\nergodic spots eventually thermalize the entire sample. Their size diverges at\nthe transition, while their density vanishes. The non-local, avalanche-like\nnature of this instability entails a breakdown of single parameter scaling and\nputs the delocalization transition outside the realm of standard critical\nphenomena.\n", "  In alloys cluster expansions (CE) are increasingly used to combine\nfirst-principles electronic-structure and Monte Carlo methods to predict\nthermodynamic properties. As a basis-set expansion in terms of lattice\ngeometrical clusters and effective cluster interactions, the CE is exact if\ninfinite, but is tractable only if truncated. Yet until now a truncation\nprocedure was not well-defined and did not guarantee a reliable truncated CE.\nWe present an optimal truncation procedure for CE basis sets that provides\nreliable thermodynamics. We then exemplify its importance in Ni$_3$V, where the\nCE has failed unpredictably, and now show agreement to a range of measured\nvalues, predict new low-energy structures, and explain the cause of previous\nfailures.\n", "  We measure the transmission through asymmetric and reflection-symmetric\nchaotic microwave cavities in dependence of the number of attached wave guides.\nFerrite cylinders are placed inside the cavities to break time-reversal\nsymmetry. The phase-breaking properties of the ferrite and its range of\napplicability are discussed in detail. Random matrix theory predictions for the\ndistribution of transmission coefficients T and their energy derivative dT/dE\nare extended to account for absorption. Using the absorption strength as a\nfitting parameter, we find good agreement between universal transmission\nfluctuations predicted by theory and the experimental data.\n", "  We propose an interpolation formula for the distribution of the reflection\ncoefficient in the presence of time reversal symmetry for chaotic cavities with\nabsorption. This is done assuming a similar functional form as that when time\nreversal invariance is absent. The interpolation formula reduces to the\nanalytical expressions for the strong and weak absorption limits. Our proposal\nis compared to the quite complicated exact result existing in the literature.\n", "  The standard spinor connection in curved space-time is represented in a\ncompact form. In this form the calculation is complicated, and its physical\neffects are concealed. In this paper, we split spinor connection into two\nvectors $\\Upsilon_\\mu$ and $\\Omega_\\mu$, where $\\Upsilon_\\mu$ is only related\nto geometrical calculations, but $\\Omega_\\mu$ leads to dynamical effects, which\ncouples with the spin of a spinor. The representation depends only on metric\nbut is independent of Dirac matrices, so it is valid for both Weyl spinors and\nDirac spinor. In the new form, we can clearly define classical concepts for a\nspinor and then derive its complete classical dynamics. By detailed calculation\nwe find the classical approximation is just Newtonian second law. The dynamical\nconnection $\\Omega_\\mu$ couples with the spin of a particle with a tiny energy\nin weak field, which provides location and navigation functions for a spinor.\nThis term may be also important to form magnetic field of a celestial star.\nFrom the results, we find the spinor has marvelous structure and wonderful\nproperty, and the interaction between spinor and gravity is subtle. This study\nmay be also helpful to clarify the relations between relativity, quantum\nmechanics and classical mechanics.\n"]}
