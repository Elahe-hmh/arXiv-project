We present a novel approach for constraining nonstandard neutrino interaction\n(NSI) coupling parameters ({\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eL} and {\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR}) in\nlow energy flavor conserving {\\nu}_{e}e and {\\nu}_{e}e-scattering processes.\nHere we exploit an important phenomenon of interference and assuming that\n{\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eL} and {\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR} are same for both the processes\nas g_{L} and g_{R} in the standard model (SM). Using this approach we obtain\nthe absolute values {\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eL}=8.7x10^-3 and\n{\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR}=3.8x10^-1, while the bounds obtained using the said\nprocesses are -0.11<{\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eL}<0.13 and\n0.35<{\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR}<0.41. It is noteworthy that the lower bound on\n{\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR} exclude the negative region. Furthermore, our bounds on\n{\\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR} are more stringent than the existing ones.\n", "  The scission kinetics of bottle-brush molecules in solution and on an\nadhesive substrate is modeled by means of Molecular Dynamics simulation with\nLangevin thermostat. Our macromolecules comprise a long flexible polymer\nbackbone with $L$ segments, consisting of breakable bonds, along with two side\nchains of length $N$, tethered to each segment of the backbone. In agreement\nwith recent experiments and theoretical predictions, we find that bond cleavage\nis significantly enhanced on a strongly attractive substrate even though the\nchemical nature of the bonds remains thereby unchanged.\n  We find that the mean bond life time $<\\tau>$ decreases upon adsorption by\nmore than an order of magnitude even for brush molecules with comparatively\nshort side chains $N=1 \\div 4$. The distribution of scission probability along\nthe bonds of the backbone is found to be rather sensitive regarding the\ninterplay between length and grafting density of side chains. The life time\n$<\\tau>$ declines with growing contour length $L$ as $<\\tau>\\propto L^{-0.17}$,\nand with side chain length as $<\\tau>\\propto N^{-0.53}$. The probability\ndistribution of fragment lengths at different times agrees well with\nexperimental observations. The variation of the mean length $L(t)$ of the\nfragments with elapsed time confirms the notion of the thermal degradation\nprocess as a first order reaction.\n", "  Let $(M, \\omega, J)$ be a K\\\"ahler manifold and K its group of hamiltonian\nsymplectomorphisms. The complexification of K introduced by Donadson is not a\ngroup, only a \"formal Lie group\". However it still makes sense to talk about\nthe exponential map in the complexification. In this note we show how to\nconstruct geometrically the exponential map (for small time), in case the\ninitial data are real-analytic. The construction is motivated by, but does not\nuse, semiclassical analysis.\n", "  We review the status and prospects of theoretical studies of neutrino-nucleus\ninteractions, and discuss the influence of the treatment of nuclear effects on\nthe determination of oscillation parameters. The models developed to describe\nthe variety of reaction mechanisms contributing to the nuclear cross sections\nare analysed, with emphasis placed on their capability to reproduce the\navailable electron scattering data.The impact of the uncertainties associated\nwith the description of nuclear dynamics on the the oscillation parameters is\nillustrated through examples, and possible avenues towards a better\nunderstanding of the signals detected by long baseline experiments are\noutlined.\n", "  In the history of condensed matter physics, reinvestigation of a well-studied\nmaterial with enhanced quality sometimes led to important scientific\ndiscoveries. A well-known example is the discovery of fractional quantum Hall\neffect in high quality GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunctions. Here we report the first\nsingle crystal growth and magnetoresistance (MR) measurements of the silver\nchalcogenide $\\beta $-Ag$_2$Se (Naumannite), a compound has been known for the\nunusual, linear-field-dependent MR in its polycrystalline form for over a\ndecade. With the quantum limit (QL) as low as 3 Tesla, a moderate field\nproduced by a superconductor magnet available in many laboratories can easily\ndrive the electrons in Ag$_2$Se to an unprecedented state. We observed\nsignificant negative longitudinal MR beyond the QL, which was understood as a\n`charge-pumping' effect between the novel fermions with opposite chiralities.\nCharacterization of the single-crystalline Ag$_2$Se and the fabrication of\nelectric devices working above the QL, will represent a new direction for the\nstudy of these exotic electrons.\n", "  Chemical structure has been long recognized to greatly influence polymer\nglass formation, but a general molecular theory that predicts how chemical\nstructure determines the properties of glass-forming polymers has been slow to\ndevelop. While the generalized entropy theory (GET) explains the influence of\nvarious molecular details on polymer glass formation, the application of the\nGET has heretofore been limited to the use of the simplest polymer model in\nwhich all united atom groups within the monomers of a species interact with a\ncommon monomer averaged van der Waals energy. However, energetic\nheterogeneities are ubiquitous within the monomers of real polymers, and their\nimplications for polymer glass formation remain to be investigated\ntheoretically. This paper uses an extension of the GET to explore the influence\nof energetic heterogeneities within monomers upon the nature of polymer glass\nformation. The present paper focuses on establishing general trends for the\nvariation of characteristic properties of glass formation, such as the isobaric\nfragility parameter $m_P$ and the glass transition temperature $T_g$, with\nmolecular details, such as the specific interactions and chain stiffness. Our\ncomputations confirm that the previously used model with monomer averaged\ninteractions correctly captures general trends in the variation of $m_P$ and\n$T_g$ with various molecular parameters. More importantly, adjustment of the\nenergetic heterogeneities within monomers alone are shown to provide an\nefficient mechanism for tailoring the properties of glass-forming polymers. The\nvariations of polymer properties along iso-fragility and iso-$T_g$ lines are\nillustrated as important design tools for exhibiting the combined influence of\nspecific interactions and chain stiffness.\n", "  Using a combination of analytical theory, Monte Carlo simulations, and three\ndimensional self-consistent field calculations, we study the equilibrium\nproperties and the switching behavior of adsorption-active polymer chains\nincluded in a homopolymer brush. The switching transition is driven by a\nconformational change of a small fraction of minority chains, which are\nattracted by the substrate. Depending on the strength of the attractive\ninteraction, the minority chains assume one of two states: An exposed state\ncharacterized by a stem-crown-like conformation, and an adsorbed state\ncharacterized by a flat two-dimensional structure. Comparing the Monte Carlo\nsimulations, which use an Edwards-type Hamiltonian with density dependent\ninteractions, with the predictions from self-consistent-field theory based on\nthe same Hamiltonian, we find that thermal density fluctuations affect the\nsystem in two different ways. First, they renormalize the excluded volume\ninteraction parameter $v_\\mathrm{\\tiny bare}$ inside the brush. The properties\nof the brushes can be reproduced by self-consistent field theory if one\nreplaces $v_\\mathrm{\\tiny bare}$ by an effective parameter $v_{\\mathrm{\\tiny\neff}}$, where the ratio of second virial coefficients $B_{\\mathrm{\\tiny\neff}}/B_\\mathrm{\\tiny bare}$ depends on the range of monomer interactions, but\nnot on the grafting density, the chain length, and $v_\\mathrm{\\tiny bare}$.\nSecond, density fluctuations affect the conformations of chains at the brush\nsurface and have a favorable effect on the characteristics of the switching\ntransition: In the interesting regime where the transition is sharp, they\nreduce the free energy barrier between the two states significantly. The\nscaling behavior of various quantities is also analyzed and compared with\nanalytical predictions.\n", "  We derive quantum spectral curve equation for (q,t)-matrix model, which turns\nout to be a certain difference equation. We show that in Nekrasov-Shatashvili\nlimit this equation reproduces the Baxter TQ equation for the quantum XXZ spin\nchain. This chain is spectral dual to the Seiberg-Witten integrable system\nassociated with the AGT dual gauge theory.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamics of Kerr-Newman-Kasuya black hole and the\nReissner-Nordstr\u007fom black hole with a global monopole on inner and outer\nhorizons. Products of surface gravities, surface temperatures, Komar energies,\nelectromagnetic potentials, angular velocities, areas, entropies, horizon radii\nand the irreducible masses at the Cauchy and the event horizons are calculated.\nIt is observed that the product of surface gravities, surface temperature\nproduct and product of Komar energies, electromagnetic potentials and angular\nvelocities at horizons are not universal quantities for these black holes.\nProducts of areas and entropies at horizons are independent of masses of black\nholes. Heat capacity is calculated for the generalized charged rotating black\nhole and phase transition is observed, under certain conditions on r. ?E\n", "  Weyl nodes are topological objects in three-dimensional metals. Their\ntopological property can be revealed by studying the high-field transport\nproperties of a Weyl semimetal. While the energy of the lowest Landau band\n(LLB) of a conventional Fermi pocket always increases with magnetic field due\nto the zero point energy, the LLB of Weyl cones remains at zero energy unless a\nstrong magnetic field couples the Weyl fermions of opposite chirality. In the\nWeyl semimetal TaP, we achieve such a magnetic coupling between the\nelectron-like Fermi pockets arising from the W1 Weyl fermions. As a result,\ntheir LLBs move above chemical potential, leading to a sharp sign reversal in\nthe Hall resistivity at a specific magnetic field corresponding to the W1 Weyl\nnode separation. By contrast, despite having almost identical carrier density,\nthe annihilation is unobserved for the hole-like pockets because the W2 Weyl\nnodes are much further separated. These key findings, corroborated by other\nsystematic analyses, reveal the nontrivial topology of Weyl fermions in\nhigh-field measurements.\n", "  Quantum metrology is the state-of-the-art measurement technology. It uses\nquantum resources to enhance the sensitivity of phase estimation beyond what\nreachable within classical physics. While single parameter estimation theory\nhas been widely investigated, much less is known about the simultaneous\nestimation of multiple phases, which finds key applications in imaging and\nsensing. In this manuscript we provide conditions of useful entanglement (among\nmultimode particles, qudits) for multiphase estimation and adapt them to\nmultiarm Mach-Zehnder interferometry. We discuss benchmark multimode Fock\nstates containing useful qudit entanglement and overcoming the sensitivity of\nseparable qudit states in three and four arm Mach-Zehnder-like interferometers\n- currently within the reach of integrated photonics technology.\n", "  We present a Bayesian approach to the redshift classification of\nemission-line galaxies when only a single emission line is detected\nspectroscopically. We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift\nLyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified\nvia an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our\nBayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom\ncutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and\nincompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the\ntwo types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the\nprobability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE. In our\nsimulations of HETDEX, this method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological\ndistance measurements by 14% with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to\nrecovering 29% more cosmological information. Rather than using binary object\nlabels, this method enables the use of classification probabilities in\nlarge-scale structure analyses. It can be applied to narrowband emission-line\nsurveys as well as upcoming large spectroscopic surveys including Euclid and\nWFIRST.\n", "  We consider a generalized Einstein-Cartan theory, in which we add the unique\ncovariant dimension four operators to general relativity that couples fermionic\nspin current to the torsion tensor (with an arbitrary strength). Since torsion\nis local and non-dynamical, when integrated out it yields an effective\nfour-fermion interaction of the gravitational strength. We show how to\nrenormalize the theory, in the one-loop perturbative expansion in generally\ncurved space-times, obtaining the first order correction to the 2PI effective\naction in Schwinger-Keldysh (${\\it in-in}$) formalism. We then apply the\nrenormalized theory to study the dynamics of a collapsing universe that begins\nin a thermal state and find that -- instead of a big crunch singularity -- the\nUniverse with torsion undergoes a ${\\it bounce}$. We solve the dynamical\nequations (a) classically (without particle production); (b) including the\nproduction of fermions in a fixed background in the Hartree-Fock approximation\nand (c) including the quantum backreaction of fermions onto the background\nspace-time. In the first and last cases the Universe undergoes a bounce. The\nproduction of fermions due to the coupling to a contracting homogeneous\nbackground speeds up the bounce, implying that the quantum contributions from\nfermions is negative, presumably because fermion production contributes\nnegatively to the energy-momentum tensor. When compared with former works on\nthe subject, our treatment is fully microscopic (namely, we treat fermions by\nsolving the corresponding Dirac equations) and quantum (in the sense that we\ninclude fermionic loop contributions).\n", "  Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and their mixtures exhibit\nfascinating properties. A complete basis of GHZ-states can be constructed by\nproperly choosing local basis rotations. We demonstrate this experimentally for\nthe Hilbert space C2x4 by entangling two photons in polarisation and orbital\nangular momentum. Mixing GHZ-states unmasks different entanglement features\nbased on their particular local geometrical connectedness. In particular, a\nspecific GHZ-state in a complete orthonormal basis has a twin GHZ-state for\nwhich equally mixing leads to full separability in opposition to any other\nbasis-state. Exploiting these local geometrical relations provides a toolbox\nfor generating specific types of multipartite entanglement, each providing\ndifferent benefits in outperforming classical devices. Our experiment, based on\nhybrid entangled entanglement, investigates these GHZs properties showing a\ngood stability and fidelity and allowing a scaling in degrees of freedom and\nadvanced operational manipulations.\n", "  A rigorous theoretical framework is developed for a generalized local frame\ntransformation theory (GLFT). The GLFT is applicable to the following systems:\nto Rydberg atoms or molecules in an electric field, or to negative ions in any\ncombination of electric and/or magnetic fields. A first test application to the\nphotoionization spectra of Rydberg atoms in an external electric field\ndemonstrates dramatic improvement over the first version of the local frame\ntransformation theory developed initially by Fano and Harmin. This revised GLFT\ntheory yields non-trivial corrections because it now includes the full on-shell\nHilbert space without adopting the truncations in the original theory.\nComparisons of the semi-analytical GLFT Stark spectra with {\\it ab initio}\nnumerical simulations yields errors in the range of a few tens of MHz, an\nimprovement over the original Fano-Harmin theory whose errors are 10-100 times\nlarger. Our analysis provides a systematic pathway to precisely describe the\ncorresponding photoabsorption spectra that should be accurate enough to meet\nmost modern experimental standards.\n", "  Through synthetic observations of a hydrodynamical simulation of an evolving\nstar-forming region, we assess how the choice of observational techniques\naffects the measurements of properties which trace star formation. Testing and\ncalibrating observational measurements requires synthetic observations which\nare as realistic as possible. In this part of the paper series (Paper I), we\nexplore different techniques for how to map the distributions of densities and\ntemperatures from the particle-based simulations onto a Voronoi mesh suitable\nfor radiative transfer and consequently explore their accuracy. We further test\ndifferent ways to set up the radiative transfer in order to produce realistic\nsynthetic observations. We give a detailed description of all methods and\nultimately recommend techniques. We have found that the flux around 20 microns\nis strongly overestimated when blindly coupling the dust radiative transfer\ntemperature with the hydrodynamical gas temperature. We find that when instead\nassuming a constant background dust temperature in addition to the radiative\ntransfer heating, the recovered flux is consistent with actual observations. We\npresent around 5800 realistic synthetic observations for Spitzer and Herschel\nbands, at different evolutionary time-steps, distances and orientations. In the\nupcoming papers of this series (Paper II, Paper III and Paper IV), we will test\nand calibrate measurements of the star-formation rate (SFR), gas mass and the\nstar-formation efficiency (SFE) using our realistic synthetic observations.\n", "  This paper explores the effects of both finite width and interference (with\nbackground) in the pair production and decay of extra heavy quarks with charge\n2/3 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This dynamics is normally ignored in\nstandard experimental searches and we assess herein the regions of validity of\ncurrent approaches, also evaluating the performances of a set of current\nexperimental analyses at 8 and 13 TeV for the deterimination of the excluded\nregions in the $(M_{\\rm VLQ},\\Gamma_{\\rm VLQ})$ plane, $M_{\\rm VLQ}$ being the\nmass of the VLQ and $\\Gamma_{\\rm VLQ}$ its width. Further, we discuss the\nconfigurations of masses, widths and couplings where the latter breaks down.\n", "  Motivation: Structural heterogeneity in single-particle cryo-electron\nmicroscopy (cryo-EM) data represents a major challenge for high-resolution\nstructure determination. Unsupervised classification may serve as the first\nstep in the assessment of structural heterogeneity. Traditional algorithms for\nunsupervised classification, such as K-means clustering and maximum likelihood\noptimization, may classify images into wrong classes with decreasing\nsignal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in the image data, yet demand increased cost in\ncomputation. Overcoming these limitations requires further development on\nclustering algorithms for high-performance cryo-EM data analysis. Results: Here\nwe introduce a statistical manifold learning algorithm for unsupervised\nsingle-particle deep clustering. We show that statistical manifold learning\nimproves classification accuracy by about 40% in the absence of input\nreferences for lower SNR data. Applications to several experimental datasets\nsuggest that our deep clustering approach can detect subtle structural\ndifference among classes. Through code optimization over the Intel\nhigh-performance computing (HPC) processors, our software implementation can\ngenerate thousands of reference-free class averages within several hours from\nhundreds of thousands of single-particle cryo-EM images, which allows\nsignificant improvement in ab initio 3D reconstruction resolution and quality.\nOur approach has been successfully applied in several structural determination\nprojects. We expect that it provides a powerful computational tool in analyzing\nhighly heterogeneous structural data and assisting in computational\npurification of single-particle datasets for high-resolution reconstruction.\n", "  The Baryon Antibaryon Symmetry Experiment (BASE) aims at performing a\nstringent test of the combined charge parity and time reversal (CPT) symmetry\nby comparing the magnetic moments of the proton and the antiproton with high\nprecision. Using single particles in a Penning trap, the proton/antiproton\n$g$-factors, i.e. the magnetic moment in units of the nuclear magneton, are\ndetermined by measuring the respective ratio of the spin-precession frequency\nto the cyclotron frequency. The spin precession frequency is measured by\nnon-destructive detection of spin quantum transitions using the continuous\nStern-Gerlach effect, and the cyclotron frequency is determined from the\nparticle's motional eigenfrequencies in the Penning trap using the invariance\ntheorem. By application of the double Penning-trap method we expect that in our\nmeasurements a fractional precision of $\\delta g/g$ 10$^{-9}$ can be achieved.\nThe successful application of this method to the antiproton will represent a\nfactor 1000 improvement in the fractional precision of its magnetic moment. The\nBASE collaboration has constructed and commissioned a new experiment at the\nAntiproton Decelerator (AD) of CERN. This article describes and summarizes the\nphysical and technical aspects of this new experiment.\n", "  We present a simple model that explains the origin of warm diffuse gas seen\nprimarily as highly ionized absorption line systems in the spectra of\nbackground sources. We predict the observed column densities of several highly\nionized transitions such as OVI, OVIII, NeVIII, NV, and MgX; and present a\nunified comparison of the model predictions with absorption lines seen in the\nMilky Way disk, Milky Way halo,starburst galaxies, the circumgalactic medium\nand the intergalactic medium at low and high redshifts. We show that diffuse\ngas seen in such diverse environments can be simultaneously explained by a\nsimple model of radiatively cooling gas. We show that most of such absorption\nline systems are consistent with being collisionally ionized, and estimate the\nmaximum likelihood temperature of the gas in each observation. This model\nsatisfactorily explains why OVI is regularly observed around star-forming low-z\nL* galaxies, and why NV is rarely seen around the same galaxies. We further\npresent some consequences of this model in quantifying the dynamics of the\ncooling gas around galaxies and predict the shock velocities associated with\nsuch flows. A unique strength of this model is that while it has only one free\n(but physically well-constrained) parameter, it nevertheless successfully\nreproduces the available data on O VI absorbers in the interstellar,\ncircumgalactic, intra-group, and intergalactic media, as well as the available\ndata on other absorption-line from highly ionized species.\n", "  Small numbers of nitrogen dopants dramatically modify the electronic\nproperties of GaAs, generating very large shifts in the conduction-band\nenergies with nonlinear concentration dependence, and impurity-associated\nspatially-localized resonant states within the conduction band. Cross-sectional\nscanning tunneling microscopy provides the local electronic structure of single\nnitrogen dopants at the (110) GaAs surface, yielding highly anisotropic spatial\nshapes when the empty states are imaged. Measurements of the resonant states\nrelative to the GaAs surface states and their spatial extent allow an\nunambiguous assignment of specific features to nitrogen atoms at different\ndepths below the cleaved (110) surface. Multiband tight binding calculations\naround the resonance energy of nitrogen in the conduction band match the imaged\nfeatures. The spatial anisotropy is attributed to the tetrahedral symmetry of\nthe bulk lattice. Additionally, the voltage dependence of the electronic\ncontrast for two features in the filled state imaging suggest these features\ncould be related to a locally modified surface state.\n", "  Double barrier GaN/AlN resonant tunneling heterostructures have been grown by\nmolecular beam epitaxy on the (0001) plane of commercially available bulk GaN\nsubstrates. Resonant tunneling diodes were fabricated; room temperature\ncurrent-voltage measurements reveal the presence of a negative differential\nconductance region under forward bias with peak current densities of ~6.4\n$kA/cm^2$ and a peak to valley current ratio of ~1.3. Reverse bias operation\npresents a characteristic turn-on threshold voltage intimately linked to the\npolarization fields present in the heterostructure. An analytic electrostatic\nmodel is developed to capture the unique features of\npolar-heterostructure-based resonant tunneling diodes; both the resonant and\nthreshold voltages are derived as a function of the design parameters and\npolarization fields. Subsequent measurements confirm the repeatability of the\nnegative conductance and demonstrate that III-nitride tunneling\nheterostructures are capable of robust resonant transport at room temperature.\n", "  We use a large data-set of realistic synthetic observations (PaperI) to\nassess how observational techniques affect the measurement of physical\nproperties of star-forming regions. In this paper (PaperII), we explore the\nreliability of the measured total gas mass, dust surface density and dust\ntemperature maps derived from modified blackbody fitting of synthetic Herschel\nobservations. We found from our pixel-by-pixel analysis of the measured dust\nsurface density and dust temperature a worrisome error spread especially close\nto star-formation sites and low-density regions, where for those \"contaminated\"\npixels the surface densities can be under/overestimated by up to three orders\nof magnitude. In light of this, we recommend to treat the pixel-based results\nfrom this technique with caution in regions with active star formation. In\nregions of high background typical in the inner Galactic plane, we are not able\nto recover reliable surface density maps of individual synthetic regions, since\nlow-mass regions are lost in the FIR background. When measuring the total gas\nmass of regions in moderate background, we find that modified blackbody fitting\nworks well (absolute error:+9%;-13%) up to 10kpc distance (errors increase with\ndistance). Commonly, the initial images are convolved to the largest common\nbeam-size, which smears contaminated pixels over large areas. The resulting\ninformation loss makes this commonly-used technique less verifiable as now\nchi^2-values cannot be used as a quality indicator of a fitted pixel. Our\ncontrol measurements of the total gas mass (without the step of convolution to\nthe largest common beam size) produce similar results (absolute error:+20%;-7%)\nwhile having much lower median errors especially for the high-mass stellar\nfeedback phase. In upcoming papers (III&IV) we test the reliability of measured\nstar-formation rate with direct and indirect techniques.\n", "  Through an extensive set of realistic synthetic observations (produced in\nPaper I), we assess in this part of the paper series (Paper III) how the choice\nof observational techniques affects the measurement of star-formation rates\n(SFRs) in star-forming regions. We test the accuracy of commonly used\ntechniques and construct new methods to extract the SFR, so that these findings\ncan be applied to measure the SFR in real regions throughout the Milky Way. We\ninvestigate diffuse infrared SFR tracers such as those using 24 {\\mu}m, 70\n{\\mu}m and total infrared emission, which have been previously calibrated for\nglobal galaxy scales. We set up a toy model of a galaxy and show that the\ninfrared emission is consistent with the intrinsic SFR using extra-galactic\ncalibrated laws (although the consistency does not prove their reliability).\nFor local scales, we show that these techniques produce completely unreliable\nresults for single star-forming regions, which are governed by different\ncharacteristic timescales. We show how calibration of these techniques can be\nimproved for single star-forming regions by adjusting the characteristic\ntimescale and the scaling factor and give suggestions of new calibrations of\nthe diffuse star-formation tracers. We show that star-forming regions that are\ndominated by high-mass stellar feedback experience a rapid drop in infrared\nemission once high-mass stellar feedback is turned on, which implies different\ncharacteristic timescales. Moreover, we explore the measured SFRs calculated\ndirectly from the observed young stellar population. We find that the measured\npoint sources follow the evolutionary pace of star formation more directly than\ndiffuse star-formation tracers.\n", "  Unconventional superconductivity often emerges at the border of long-range\nmagnetic orders. Understanding the low-energy charge dynamics may provide\ncrucial information on the formation of superconductivity. Here we report the\nunpolarized/polarized optical conductivity study of high quality MnP single\ncrystals at ambient pressure. Our data reveal two types of charge carriers with\nvery different lifetimes. In combination with the first-principles\ncalculations, we show that the short-lifetime carriers have flat Fermi sheets\nwhich become gapped in the helimagnetic phase, causing a dramatic change in the\nlow-frequency optical spectra, while the long-lifetime carriers are anisotropic\nthree-dimensional like which are little affected by the magnetic transitions\nand provide major contributions to the transport properties. This\norbital-dependent charge dynamics originates from the special crystal structure\nof MnP and may have an influence on the unconventional superconductivity and\nits interplay with helimagnetism at high pressures.\n", "  We propose a new scaling law for anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic thin\nfilms by distinguishing three scattering sources, namely, bulk impurity,\nphonon, and more importantly a rough surface. This new scaling law fits the\nrecent experimental data excellently with constant coefficients that are\nindependent of temperature and film thickness. This is in stark constrast with\nprevious scaling laws that use temperature/thickness dependent fitting\ncoefficients, and is a strong indicator that this law captures the essential\nphysics. By intepretating the experiments for Fe, Co, and Ni with this new law,\nwe conclude that (i) the phonon-induced skew scattering is unimportant as\nexpected; (ii) contribution from the impurity-induced skew scattering is\nnegative; (iii) the intrinsic (extrinsic) mechanism dominates in Fe (Co), and\nboth the extrinsic and the intrinsic contribution are important in Ni.\n", "  Ultrafast electron dynamics in solids under strong optical fields has\nrecently found particular attention. In dielectrics and semiconductors, various\nlight-field-driven effects have been explored, such as high-harmonic\ngeneration, sub-optical-cycle interband population transfer and nonperturbative\nincrease of transient polarizability. In contrast, much less is known about\nfield-driven electron dynamics in metals because charge carriers screen an\nexternal electric field in ordinary metals. Here we show that atomically thin\nmonolayer Graphene offers unique opportunities to study light-field-driven\nprocesses in a metal. With a comparably modest field strength of up to 0.3\nV/{\\AA}, we drive combined interband and intraband electron dynamics, leading\nto a light-field-waveform controlled residual conduction current after the\nlaser pulse is gone. We identify the underlying pivotal physical mechanism as\nelectron quantum-path interference taking place on the 1-femtosecond\n($10^{-15}$ second) timescale. The process can be categorized as\nLandau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg interferometry. These fully coherent electron\ndynamics in graphene take place on a hitherto unexplored timescale faster than\nelectron-electron scattering (tens of femtoseconds) and electron-phonon\nscattering (hundreds of femtoseconds). These results broaden the scope of\nlight-field control of electrons in solids to an entirely new and eminently\nimportant material class -- metals -- promising wide ramifications for band\nstructure tomography and light-field-driven electronics.\n", "  A number of human activities exhibit a bursty pattern, namely periods of very\nhigh activity that are followed by rest periods. Records of these processes\ngenerate time series of events whose inter-event times follow a probability\ndistribution that displays a fat tail. The grounds for such phenomenon are not\nyet clearly understood. In the present work we use the freely available\nWikipedia editing records to unravel some features of this phenomenon. We show\nthat even though the probability to start editing is conditioned by the\ncircadian 24 hour cycle, the conditional probability for the time interval\nbetween successive edits at a given time of the day is independent from the\nlatter. We confirm our findings with the activity of posting on the social\nnetwork Twitter. Our result suggests there is an intrinsic humankind scheduling\npattern: after overcoming the encumbrance to start an activity, there is a\nrobust distribution of new related actions, which does not depend on the time\nof day.\n", "  Strongly interacting two dimensional electron systems (2DESs) host a complex\nlandscape of broken symmetry states. The possible ground states are further\nexpanded by internal degrees of freedom such as spin or valley-isospin. While\ndirect probes of spin in 2DESs were demonstrated two decades ago, the valley\nquantum number has only been probed indirectly in semiconductor quantum wells,\ngraphene mono- and bilayers, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. Here, we\npresent the first direct experimental measurement of valley polarization in a\ntwo dimensional electron system, effected via the direct mapping of the valley\nquantum number onto the layer polarization in bilayer graphene at high magnetic\nfields. We find that the layer polarization evolves in discrete steps across 32\nelectric field-tuned phase transitions between states of different valley,\nspin, and orbital polarization. Our data can be fit by a model that captures\nboth single particle and interaction induced orbital, valley, and spin\nanisotropies, providing the most complete model of this complex system to date.\nAmong the newly discovered phases are theoretically unanticipated orbitally\npolarized states stabilized by skew interlayer hopping. The resulting roadmap\nto symmetry breaking in bilayer graphene paves the way for deterministic\nengineering of fractional quantum Hall states, while our layer-resolved\ntechnique is readily extendable to other two dimensional materials where layer\npolarization maps to the valley or spin quantum numbers, providing an essential\ndirect probe that is a prerequisite for manipulating these new quantum degrees\nof freedom.\n", "  We used classical and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to\ncharacterize vacancy-mediated diffusion of cations in Gd$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$\npyrochlore as a function of the disorder on the microsecond timescale. We find\nthat cation vacancy diffusion is slow in materials with low levels of disorder.\nHowever, higher levels of disorder allow for fast cation diffusion, which is\nthen also accompanied by fast antisite annihilation and ordering of the\ncations. The cation diffusivity is therefore not constant, but decreases as the\nmaterial reorders. The results suggest that fast cation diffusion is triggered\nby the existence of a percolation network of antisites. This is in marked\ncontrast with oxygen diffusion, which showed a smooth increase of the ionic\ndiffusivity with increasing disorder in the same compound. The increase of the\ncation diffusivity with disorder is also contrary to observations from other\ncomplex oxides and disordered media models, suggesting a fundamentally\ndifferent relation between disorder and mass transport. These results highlight\nthe dynamic interplay between fast cation diffusion and the recovery of\ndisorder and have important implications for understanding radiation damage\nevolution, sintering and aging, as well as diffusion in disorder oxides more\ngenerally.\n", "  We study the integrability of the four-dimensional eighth-order nonlinear\nwave equation of Kac and Wakimoto, associated with the exceptional affine Lie\nalgebra ${\\mathfrak e}_6^{(1)}$. Using the Painlev\\'{e} analysis for partial\ndifferential equations, we show that this equation must be non-integrable in\nthe Lax sense but very likely it possesses a lower-order integrable reduction.\n", "  In dispersive media, hydrodynamic singularities are resolved by coherent\nwavetrains known as dispersive shock waves (DSWs). Only dynamically expanding,\ntemporal DSWs are possible in one-dimensional media. The additional degree of\nfreedom inherent in two-dimensional media allows for the generation of\ntime-independent DSWs that exhibit spatial expansion. Spatial oblique DSWs,\ndispersive analogs of oblique shocks in classical media, are constructed\nutilizing Whitham modulation theory for a class of nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nboundary value problems. Self-similar, simple wave solutions of the modulation\nequations yield relations between the DSW's orientation and the\nupstream/downstream flow fields. Time dependent numerical simulations\ndemonstrate a convective or absolute instability of oblique DSWs in supersonic\nflow over obstacles. The convective instability results in an effective\nstabilization of the DSW.\n", "  We present a model for the [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution of stars in the\ninner Galaxy, R=3-5 kpc, measured as a function of vertical distance |z| from\nthe midplane by Hayden et al. (2015, H15). Motivated by an \"upside-down\"\nscenario for thick disk formation, in which the thickness of the star-forming\ngas layer contracts as the stellar mass of the disk grows, we combine one-zone\nchemical evolution with a simple prescription in which the scale-height of the\nstellar distribution drops linearly from z_h=0.8 kpc to z_h=0.2 kpc over a\ntimescale t_c, remaining constant thereafter. We assume a linear-exponential\nstar-formation history, SFR ~ te^{-t/t_sf}. With a star-formation efficiency\ntimescale of 2 Gyr, an outflow mass-loading factor of 1.5, t_sf=3 Gyr, and\nt_c=2.5 Gyr, the model reproduces the observed locus of inner disk stars in\n[alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) measured by\nH15 at |z|=0-0.5 kpc, 0.5-1 kpc, and 1-2 kpc. Substantial changes to model\nparameters lead to disagreement with the H15 data; for example, models with\nt_c=1 Gyr or t_sf=1 Gyr fail to match the observed MDF at high-|z| and low-|z|,\nrespectively. The inferred scale-height evolution, with z_h(t) dropping on a\ntimescale t_c ~ t_sf at large lookback times, favors upside-down formation over\ndynamical heating of an initially thin stellar population as the primary\nmechanism regulating disk thickness. The failure of our short-t_c models\nsuggests that any model in which thick disk formation is a discrete event will\nnot reproduce the continuous dependence of the MDF on |z| found by H15. Our\nscenario for the evolution of the inner disk can be tested by future\nmeasurements of the |z|-distribution and the age-metallicity distribution at\nR=3-5 kpc.\n", "  Controlling and manipulating quanta of coherent acoustic vibrations - phonons\n- in integrated circuits has recently drawn a lot of attention, since phonons\ncan function as unique links between radiofrequency and optical signals, allow\naccess to quantum regimes and offer advanced signal processing capabilities.\nRecent approaches based on optomechanical resonators have achieved impressive\nquality factors allowing for storage of optical signals. However, so far these\ntechniques have been limited in bandwidth and are incompatible with\nmulti-wavelength operation. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a\ncoherent buffer in an integrated planar optical waveguide by transferring the\noptical information coherently to an acoustic hypersound wave. Optical\ninformation is extracted using the reverse process. These hypersound phonons\nhave similar wavelengths as the optical photons but travel at 5-orders of\nmagnitude lower velocity. We demonstrate the storage of phase and amplitude of\noptical information with GHz-bandwidth and show operation at separate\nwavelengths with negligible cross-talk.\n", "  The coherent superposition of states, in combination with the quantization of\nobservables, represents one of the most fundamental features that mark the\ndeparture of quantum mechanics from the classical realm. Quantum coherence in\nmany-body systems embodies the essence of entanglement and is an essential\ningredient for a plethora of physical phenomena in quantum optics, quantum\ninformation, solid state physics, and nanoscale thermodynamics. In recent\nyears, research on the presence and functional role of quantum coherence in\nbiological systems has also attracted a considerable interest. Despite the\nfundamental importance of quantum coherence, the development of a rigorous\ntheory of quantum coherence as a physical resource has only been initiated\nrecently. In this Colloquium we discuss and review the development of this\nrapidly growing research field that encompasses the characterization,\nquantification, manipulation, dynamical evolution, and operational application\nof quantum coherence.\n", "  The sub-luminal phase velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space is\ngenerally unobtainable, being closely linked to forbidden faster than light\ngroup velocities. The requirement of effective sub-luminal phase-velocity in\nlaser-driven particle acceleration schemes imposes a fundamental limit on the\ntotal acceleration achievable in free-space, and necessitates the use of\ndielectric structures and waveguides for extending the field-particle\ninteraction. Here we demonstrate a new travelling-source and free space\npropagation approach to overcoming the sub-luminal propagation limits. The\napproach exploits the relative ease of generating ultrafast optical sources\nwith slow group velocity propagation, and a group-to-phase front conversion\nthrough non-linear optical interaction near a material-vacuum boundary. The\nconcept is demonstrated with two terahertz generation processes, non-linear\noptical rectification and current-surge rectification. The phase velocity is\ntunable, both above and below vacuum speed of light $c$, and we report\nmeasurements of longitudinally polarized electric fields propagating between\n$0.77c$ and $1.75c$. The ability to scale to multi-MV/m field strengths is\ndemonstrated. Our approach paves the way towards the realization of cheap and\ncompact particle accelerators with unprecedented femtosecond scale control of\nparticles.\n", "  Entanglement swapping generates remote quantum correlations between particles\nthat have not interacted and is the cornerstone of long-distance quantum\ncommunication, quantum networks, and fundamental tests of quantum science. In\nthe context of spatial modes of light, high-dimensional entanglement provides\nan avenue to increase the bandwidth of quantum communications and provides more\nstringent limits for tests of quantum foundations. Here we simultaneously swap\nthe entanglement of multiple orbital angular momentum states of light. The\nsystem is based on a degenerate filter that cannot distinguish between\ndifferent anti-symmetric states, and thus entanglement swapping occurs for\nseveral thousand pairs of spatial light modes simultaneously.\n", "  Separability conditions for a bipartite quantum system of finite-dimensional\nsubsystems are formulated in terms of R\\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies. Entropic\nuncertainty relations often lead to entanglement criteria. We propose new\napproach based on the convolution of discrete probability distributions.\nMeasurements on a total system are constructed of local ones according to the\nconvolution scheme. Separability conditions are derived on the base of\nuncertainty relations of the Maassen-Uffink type as well as majorization\nrelations. On each of subsystems, we use a pair of sets of subnormalized\nvectors that form rank-one POVMs. We also obtain entropic separability\nconditions for local measurements with a special structure, such as mutually\nunbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete measurements. The\nrelevance of the derived separability conditions is demonstrated with several\nexamples.\n", "  We investigate the $\\gamma$-ray and X-ray properties of the flat spectrum\nradio quasar (FSRQ) \\4c50 at redshift $z= 1.517$. The {\\it Fermi} Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) data indicate that this source was in an active state since\n2013 July. During the active period, the $\\gamma$-ray flux increased by more\nthan a factor of three and two distinct flares were detected with the\nvariability timescale as short as several hours.\n  The $\\gamma$-ray spectra can be well fitted by a log-parabola. From the\nfitting, we find a correlation between the peak energy and spectral curvature\nfor the $\\gamma$-ray spectra, which is the first time seen in $\\gamma$-ray\nemission from a blazar. The {\\it Swift} X-ray Telescope (XRT) data show that\nthe source was variable at X-ray energies, but no evidence shows flux or\nspectral changes related to the $\\gamma$-ray activity. The broad-band X-ray\nspectrum obtained with {\\it Swift} XRT and {\\it NuSTAR} is well described by a\nbroken PL model, with an extremely hard spectrum ($\\Gamma_{1} \\sim 0.1$) below\nthe break energy, $E_{\\rm break} \\sim 2.1 {\\rm keV}$, and $\\Gamma_{2} \\sim 1.5$\nabove the break energy. The spectral steepening below $\\sim 3$ keV is likely\ndue to the low energy cut-off in the energy distribution of the photon-emitting\nelectron population. Both the $\\gamma$-ray and X-ray emission appear harder\nwhen brighter. The broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) is constructed\nfor the source, and we provide a model fit to the SED. Our modeling suggests\nthat the emission region should be outside the broad line region, and the\nproperties of the region indicate a jet with 42\\% of the Eddington power during\nthe active state.\n", "  Models of nuclear dark matter propose that the dark sector contains large\ncomposite states consisting of dark nucleons in analogy to Standard Model\nnuclei. We examine the direct detection phenomenology of a particular class of\nnuclear dark matter model at the current generation of tonne-scale liquid noble\nexperiments, in particular DEAP-3600 and XENON1T. In our chosen nuclear dark\nmatter scenario distinctive features arise in the recoil energy spectra due to\nthe non-point-like nature of the composite dark matter state. We calculate the\nnumber of events required to distinguish these spectra from those of a standard\npoint-like WIMP state with a decaying exponential recoil spectrum. In the most\nfavourable regions of nuclear dark matter parameter space, we find that a few\ntens of events are needed to distinguish nuclear dark matter from WIMPs at the\n$3\\,\\sigma$ level in a single experiment. Given the total exposure time of\nDEAP-3600 and XENON1T we find that at best a $2\\,\\sigma$ distinction is\npossible by these experiments individually, while $3\\,\\sigma$ sensitivity is\nreached for a range of parameters by the combination of the two experiments. We\nshow that future upgrades of these experiments have potential to distinguish a\nlarge range of nuclear dark matter models from that of a WIMP at greater than\n$3\\,\\sigma$.\n", "  Recent developments in integrated photonics technology are opening the way to\nthe fabrication of complex linear optical interferometers. The application of\nthis platform is ubiquitous in quantum information science, from quantum\nsimulation to quantum metrology, including the quest for quantum supremacy via\nthe boson sampling problem. Within these contexts, the capability to learn\nefficiently the unitary operation of the implemented interferometers becomes a\ncrucial requirement. In this letter we develop a reconstruction algorithm based\non a genetic approach, which can be adopted as a tool to characterize an\nunknown linear optical network. We report an experimental test of the described\nmethod by performing the reconstruction of a 7-mode interferometer implemented\nvia the femtosecond laser writing technique. Further applications of genetic\napproaches can be found in other contexts, such as quantum metrology or\nlearning unknown general Hamiltonian evolutions.\n", "  Nanometrically thin glassy films depart strikingly from the behavior of their\nbulk counterparts. We investigate whether the dynamical differences between\nbulk and thin film glasses can be understood by differences in local\nmicroscopic structure. We employ machine-learning methods that have previously\nidentified strong correlations between local structure and particle\nrearrangement dynamics in bulk systems. We show that these methods completely\nfail to detect key aspects of thin-film glassy dynamics. Furthermore, we show\nthat no combination of local structural features drawn from a very general set\nof two- and multi-point functions is able to distinguish between particles at\nthe center of film and those in intermediate layers where the dynamics are\nstrongly perturbed.\n", "  Coherent diffractive imaging of individual free nanoparticles has opened\nnovel routes for the in-situ analysis of their transient structural, optical,\nand electronic properties. So far, single-shot single-particle diffraction was\nassumed to be feasible only at extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray\nfree-electron lasers, restricting this research field to large-scale\nfacilities. Here we demonstrate single-shot imaging of isolated helium\nnanodroplets using XUV pulses from a femtosecond-laser driven high harmonic\nsource. We obtain bright wide-angle scattering patterns, that allow us to\nuniquely identify hitherto unresolved prolate shapes of superfluid helium\ndroplets. Our results mark the advent of single-shot gas-phase nanoscopy with\nlab-based short-wavelength pulses and pave the way to ultrafast coherent\ndiffractive imaging with phase-controlled multicolor fields and attosecond\npulses.\n", "  Resorting to Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) transformations, we propose\nan emergent geometric description for a topological phase transition in the\nKitaev superconductor model. An effective field theory consists of an emergent\nbulk action with an extra dimension, an ultraviolet (UV) boundary condition for\nan initial value of a coupling function, and an infrared (IR) effective action\nwith a fully renormalized coupling function. The bulk action describes the\nevolution of the coupling function along the direction of the extra dimension,\nwhere the extra dimension is identified with an RG scale and the resulting\nequation of motion is nothing but a $\\beta-$function. In particular, the IR\neffective field theory turns out to be consistent with a Callan-Symanzik\nequation which takes into account both the bulk and IR boundary contributions.\nThis derived Callan-Symanzik equation gives rise to a metric structure. Based\non this emergent metric tensor, we uncover the equivalence of the entanglement\nentropy between the emergent geometric description and the quantum field theory\nin the vicinity of the quantum critical point.\n", "  We study the initial three-dimensional spatial configuration of the\nquark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using\ncentrality and rapidity-dependent measurements of charged particle\npseudorapidity densities and two-particle correlations. A cumulant-generating\nfunction is used to parametrize the rapidity dependence of local entropy\ndeposition and extend arbitrary boost-invariant initial conditions to nonzero\nbeam rapidities. The model is compared to p+Pb and Pb+Pb single-particle\ndistributions and systematically optimized using Bayesian parameter estimation\nto extract high-probability initial condition parameters. The optimized initial\nconditions are then compared to a number of experimental observables including\ntwo-particle rapidity correlations, the rapidity dependence of anisotropic\nflow, and event-plane decorrelations.\n", "  Quantum simulation is a way to study unexplored Hamiltonians by mapping them\nonto the assemblies of well-understood quantum systems such as ultracold atoms\nin optical lattices, trapped ions or superconducting circuits. Semiconductor\nnanostructures which form the backbone of classical computing hold largely\nuntapped potential for quantum simulation. In particular, chains of quantum\ndots in semiconductor nanowires can be used to emulate one-dimensional\nHamiltonians such as the toy model of a topological p-wave superconductor. Here\nwe realize a building block of this model, a double quantum dot with\nsuperconducting contacts, in an indium antimonide nanowire. In each dot,\ntunnel-coupling to a superconductor induces Andreev bound states. We\ndemonstrate that these states hybridize to form the double-dot Andreev\nmolecular states. We establish the parity and the spin structure of Andreev\nmolecular levels by monitoring their evolution in electrostatic potential and\nmagnetic field. Understanding Andreev molecules is a key step towards building\nlonger chains which are predicted to generate Majorana bound states at the end\nsites. Two superconducting quantum dots are already sufficient to test the\nfusion rules of Majorana bound states, a milestone towards fault-tolerant\ntopological quantum computing.\n", "  The stellar and gaseous mass distributions, as well as the extended rotation\ncurve in the nearby galaxy M33 are used to derive the radial distribution of\ndark matter density in the halo and to test cosmological models of galaxy\nformation and evolution. Two methods are examined to constrain dark mass\ndensity profiles. The first method deals directly with fitting the rotation\ncurve data in the range of galactocentric distances $0.24\\,\\text{kpc}\\leq\nr\\leq22.72\\,\\text{kpc}.$ As found in a previous paper by\n\\citet{Corbelli:2014lga}, and using the results of collisionless $\\Lambda-$Cold\nDark Matter numerical simulations, we confirm that the Navarro-Frenkel-White\n(hereafter NFW) dark matter profile provides a better fit to the rotation curve\ndata than the cored Burkert profile (hereafter BRK) profile. The second method\nrelies on the local equation of centrifugal equilibrium and on the rotation\ncurve slope. In the aforementioned range of distances we fit the observed\nvelocity profile, using a function which has a rational dependence on the\nradius, and derive the slope of the rotation curve. Following\n\\citet{Salucci:2010qr} we then infer the effective matter densities. In the\nradial range $9.53\\,\\text{kpc}\\leq r\\leq22.72\\,\\text{kpc}$ the uncertainties\ninduced by the luminous matter (stars and gas) becomes negligible, because the\ndark matter density dominates, and we can determine locally the radial\ndistribution of dark matter. With this second method we tested the NFW and the\nBRK dark matter profiles and confirm that both profiles are compatible with the\ndata even though in this case the cored BRK density profile provides a more\nreasonable value for the baryonic-to-dark matter ratio.\n", "  Two-dimensional van der Waals materials have emerged as promising platforms\nfor solid-state quantum information processing devices with unusual potential\nfor heterogeneous assembly. Recently, bright and photostable single photon\nemitters were reported from atomic defects in layered hexagonal boron nitride\n(hBN), but controlling inhomogeneous spectral distribution and reducing\nmulti-photon emission presented open challenges. Here, we demonstrate that\nstrain control allows spectral tunability of hBN single photon emitters over 6\nmeV, and material processing sharply improves the single-photon purity. We\nreport high single photon count rates exceeding 10^7 counts/sec at saturation,\nwhich is the highest single photon detection rate for room-temperature single\nphoton emitters, to our knowledge. Furthermore, these emitters are stable to\nmaterial transfer to other substrates. High-purity and photostable single\nphoton emission at room temperature, together with spectral tunability and\ntransferability, opens the door to scalable integration of high-quality quantum\nemitters in photonic quantum technologies.\n", "  Active matter embraces systems that self-organize at different length and\ntime scales, often exhibiting turbulent flows. Here, we use a\nquasi-two-dimensional nematically ordered layer of a protein-based active gel\nto experimentally demonstrate that the geometry of active flows, which we have\ncharacterized by means of the statistical distribution of eddy sizes, can be\nreversibly modified. To this purpose, the active material is prepared in\ncontact with a thermotropic liquid crystal, whose lamellar smectic-A phase\ntiles the water/oil interface with a lattice of anisotropic domains that\nfeature circular easy-flow directions. The active flow, which arises from the\nmotion of parabolic folds within the filamentous active material, becomes\neffectively confined into circulating eddies that are in registry with the\nunderlying smectic-A domains. Based on topological arguments applied to the\ncircular confinement, together with well-known properties of the active\nmaterial, we show that the structure of the active flow is determined by a\nsingle intrinsic length scale. The role of this length scale thus reemerges\nfrom setting the decay length in the exponential eddy size distribution of the\nfree turbulent regime, to determining the minimum size of circulating eddies\nfeaturing a scale-free power law. Our results demonstrate that soft-confinement\nprovides with an invaluable tool to probe the intrinsic length and time scales\nof active materials, and pave the way for further exploration looking for\nsimilarities and differences between active and passive two-dimensional\nturbulence.\n", "  The search for quantum spin liquids in frustrated quantum magnets recently\nhas enjoyed a surge of interest, with various candidate materials under intense\nscrutiny. However, an experimental confirmation of a gapped topological spin\nliquid remains an open question. Here, we show that circularly-polarized light\ncan provide a novel knob to drive frustrated Mott insulators into a chiral spin\nliquid (CSL), realizing an elusive quantum spin liquid with topological order.\nWe find that the dynamics of a driven Kagome Mott insulator is well-captured by\nan effective Floquet spin model, with heating strongly suppressed, inducing a\nscalar spin chirality $S_i \\cdot (S_j \\times S_k)$ term which dynamically\nbreaks time-reversal while preserving SU(2) spin symmetry. We fingerprint the\ntransient phase diagram and find a stable photo-induced CSL near the\nequilibrium state. The results presented suggest employing dynamical symmetry\nbreaking to engineer quantum spin liquids and access elusive phase transitions\nthat are not readily accessible in equilibrium.\n", "  We show that molecular aggregation can strongly influence the nonradiative\ndecay (NRD) lifetime of an electronic excitation. As a demonstrative example,\nwe consider a transition-dipole-dipole-interacting dimer whose monomers have\nharmonic potential energy surfaces (PESs). Depending on the position of the NRD\nchannel ($q_{\\rm nr}$), we find that the NRD lifetime ($\\tau_{\\rm nr}^{\\rm\ndim}$) can exhibit a completely different dependence on the\nintermolecular-interaction strength. We observe that (i) for $q_{\\rm nr}$ near\nthe Franck-Condon region, $\\tau_{\\rm nr}^{\\rm dim}$ increases with the\ninteraction strength; (ii) for $q_{\\rm nr}$ near the minimum of the monomer\nexcited PES, the intermolecular interaction has little influence on $\\tau_{\\rm\nnr}^{\\rm dim}$; (iii) for $q_{\\rm nr}$ near the classical turning point of the\nmonomer nuclear dynamics, on the other side of the minimum, $\\tau_{\\rm nr}^{\\rm\ndim}$ decreases with the interaction strength. Our findings suggest design\nprinciples for molecular systems where a specific fluorescence quantum yield is\ndesired.\n", "  The quantitative extraction of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) properties from\nheavy-ion data, such as its specific shear viscosity $\\eta /s$, typically\nrequires comparison to viscous hydrodynamic or \"hybrid\" hydrodynamics+transport\nsimulations. In either case, one has to convert the fluid to hadrons, yet\nwithout additional theory input the conversion is ambiguous for dissipative\nfluids. Here, shear viscous phase-space corrections calculated using linearized\ntransport theory are applied in Cooper-Frye freezeout to quantify the effects\non anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n(p_T)$ at both RHIC and LHC energies.\nExpanding upon our previous flow harmonics studies [1,2], we calculate pion and\nproton $v_2(p_T)$, $v_4(p_T)$, and $v_6(p_T)$. Unlike in Ref. [1], we\nincorporate a hadron gas that is chemically frozen below a temperature of 175\nMeV, and use hypersurfaces from realistic viscous hydrodynamic simulations.\nWith additive quark model cross sections and relative phase-space corrections\nwith $p^{3/2}$ momentum dependence, rather than the quadratic Grad form, we\nfind at moderately high transverse momentum noticeably higher $v_4(p_T)$ and\n$v_6(p_T)$ for protons than for pions. In addition, the value of $\\eta /s$\ndeduced from elliptic flow data differs by nearly 50\\% from the value extracted\nusing the naive \"democratic Grad\" form of freeze-out distributions. To\nfacilitate the use of the self-consistent viscous corrections calculated here\nin hydrodynamic and hybrid calculations, we also present convenient\nparameterizations of the corrections for the various hadron species (cf. Table\nI).\n", "  It has been some time since non-commutative geometry was proposed by Jean\nBellissard as a theoretical framework for the investigation of homogeneous\ncondensed matter systems. Recently, Bellissard's approach has been\nenthusiastically adopted in the relatively young field of topological\ninsulators, where it facilitated many rigorous results concerning the stability\nof the topological invariants against disorder. In this work we present a\ncomputational program based on the principles of non-commutative geometry and\nshowcase several applications to topological insulators. In the first part we\nintroduce the notion of a homogeneous material and define the class of\ndisordered crystals together with the classification table which conjectures\nall topological phases from this class. We continue with a discussion of\nelectron dynamics in disordered crystals and we briefly review the theory of\ntopological invariants in the presence of strong disorder. We show how all\nthese can be captured in the language of non-commutative geometry using the\nconcept of non-commutative Brillouin torus, and present a list of known\nformulas for various physical response functions. In the second part, we\nintroduce auxiliary algebras and develop a canonical finite-volume\napproximation of the non-commutative Brillouin torus. Explicit numerical\nalgorithms for computing generic correlation functions are discussed. In the\nthird part we derive upper bounds on the numerical errors and demonstrate that\nthe canonical-finite volume approximation converges extremely fast to the\nthermodynamic limit. Convergence tests and various applications concludes our\npresentation.\n", "  In classical General Relativity (GR), an observer falling into an\nastrophysical black hole is not expected to experience anything dramatic as she\ncrosses the event horizon. However, tentative resolutions to problems in\nquantum gravity, such as the cosmological constant problem, or the black hole\ninformation paradox, invoke significant departures from classicality in the\nvicinity of the horizon. It was recently pointed out that such near-horizon\nstructures can lead to late-time echoes in the black hole merger gravitational\nwave signals that are otherwise indistinguishable from GR. We search for\nobservational signatures of these echoes in the gravitational wave data\nreleased by advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory\n(LIGO), following the three black hole merger events GW150914, GW151226, and\nLVT151012. In particular, we look for repeating damped echoes with time-delays\nof $8 M \\log M$ (+spin corrections, in Planck units), corresponding to\nPlanck-scale departures from GR near their respective horizons. Accounting for\nthe \"look elsewhere\" effect due to uncertainty in the echo template, we find\ntentative evidence for Planck-scale structure near black hole horizons at false\ndetection probability of $1\\%$ (corresponding to $2.5\\sigma$ significance\nlevel). Future observations from interferometric detectors at higher\nsensitivity, along with more physical echo templates, will be able to confirm\n(or rule out) this finding, providing possible empirical evidence for\nalternatives to classical black holes, such as in ${\\it firewall}$ or ${\\it\nfuzzball}$ paradigms.\n", "  We used molecular dynamics simulations, the Green-Kubo Modal Analysis (GKMA)\nmethod and sonification to study the modal contributions to thermal\nconductivity in individual polythiophene chains. The simulations suggest that\nit is possible to achieve divergent thermal conductivity and the GKMA method\nallowed for exact pinpointing of the modes responsible for the anomalous\nbehavior. The analysis showed that transverse vibrations in the plane of the\naromatic rings at low frequencies ~ 0.05 THz are primarily responsible. Further\ninvestigation showed that the divergence arises from persistent correlation\nbetween the three lowest frequency modes on chains. Sonification of the mode\nheat fluxes revealed regions where the heat flux amplitude yields a somewhat\nsinusoidal envelope with a long period similar to the relaxation time. This\ncharacteristic in the divergent mode heat fluxes gives rise to the overall\nthermal conductivity divergence, which strongly supports earlier hypotheses\nthat attribute the divergence to correlated phonon-phonon\nscattering/interactions.\n", "  We compute the slope and curvature, at vanishing four-momentum transfer\nsquared, of the leading order hadron vacuum polarization function, using\nlattice QCD. Calculations are performed with 2+1+1 flavors of staggered\nfermions directly at the physical values of the quark masses and in volumes of\nlinear extent larger than 6fm. The continuum limit is carried out using six\ndifferent lattice spacings. All connected and disconnected contributions are\ncalculated, up to and including those of the charm.\n", "  In short-range interacting systems, the speed at which entanglement can be\nestablished between two separated points is limited by a constant Lieb-Robinson\nvelocity. Long-range interacting systems are capable of faster entanglement\ngeneration, but the degree of the speed-up possible is an open question. In\nthis paper, we present a protocol capable of transferring a quantum state\nacross a distance $L$ in $d$ dimensions using long-range interactions with\nstrength bounded by $1/r^\\alpha$. If $\\alpha < d$, the state transfer time is\nasymptotically independent of $L$; if $\\alpha = d$, the time is logarithmic in\ndistance $L$; if $d < \\alpha < d+1$, transfer occurs in time proportional to\n$L^{\\alpha - d}$; and if $\\alpha \\geq d + 1$, it occurs in time proportional to\n$L$. We then use this protocol to upper bound the time required to create a\nstate specified by a MERA (multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz)\ntensor network, and show that, if the linear size of the MERA state is $L$,\nthen it can be created in time that scales with $L$ identically to state\ntransfer up to multiplicative logarithmic corrections.\n", "  We study Generalised Restricted Boltzmann Machines with generic priors for\nunits and weights, interpolating between Boolean and Gaussian variables. We\npresent a complete analysis of the replica symmetric phase diagram of these\nsystems, which can be regarded as Generalised Hopfield models. We underline the\nrole of the retrieval phase for both inference and learning processes and we\nshow that retrieval is robust for a large class of weight and unit priors,\nbeyond the standard Hopfield scenario. Furthermore we show how the paramagnetic\nphase boundary is directly related to the optimal size of the training set\nnecessary for good generalisation in a teacher-student scenario of unsupervised\nlearning.\n", "  Quantum repeaters are nodes in a quantum communication network that allow\nreliable transmission of entanglement over large distances. It was recently\nshown that highly entangled photons in so-called graph states can be used for\nall-photonic quantum repeaters, which require substantially fewer resources\ncompared to atomic-memory based repeaters. However, standard approaches to\nbuilding multi-photon entangled states through pairwise probabilistic\nentanglement generation severely limit the size of the state that can be\ncreated. Here, we present a protocol for the deterministic generation of large\nphotonic repeater states using quantum emitters such as semiconductor quantum\ndots and defect centers in solids. We show that arbitrarily large repeater\nstates can be generated using only two coupled emitters, reducing the necessary\nnumber of photon sources by six orders of magnitude. Our protocol includes a\nbuilt-in redundancy which makes it resilient to photon loss.\n", "  Contrary to most materials, graphene exhibits a negative thermal expansion\ncoefficient (TEC), i.e it contracts when heated. This contraction is due to the\nthermal excitation of low energy out-of-plane vibration modes. These flexural\nmodes have been reported to govern the electronic transport and the mechanical\nresponse of suspended graphene. In this work, we systematically investigate the\ninfluence of defects in the TEC of suspended graphene membranes. Controlled\nintroduction of low densities of mono-vacancies reduces the graphene TEC, up to\none order of magnitude for a defect density of $5\\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$ . Our\nmolecular dynamics simulations reproduce the observed trend and show that TEC\nreduction is due to the suppression of out-of-plane fluctuations caused by the\nstrain fields created by mono-vacancies in their surrounding areas. These\nresults highlight the key role of defects in the properties of \"real-life\"\ngraphene, and pave the way for future proposals of electronic and mechanical\ndefect engineering.\n", "  We analyse the breathing-mode oscillations of a harmonically quenched\nTonks-Giradeau (TG) gas using an exact finite-temperature dynamical theory. We\npredict a striking collective manifestation of impenetrability---a collective\nmany-body bounce effect. The effect, while being invisible in the evolution of\nthe in-situ density profile of the gas, can be revealed through a nontrivial\nperiodic narrowing of its momentum distribution, taking place at twice the rate\nof the fundamental breathing-mode frequency. We identify physical regimes for\nobserving the many-body bounce and construct the respective nonequilibrium\nphase diagram as a function of the quench strength and the initial temperature\nof the gas. We also develop a finite-temperature hydrodynamic theory of the TG\ngas, wherein the many-body bounce is explained by an increased thermodynamic\npressure of the gas during the isentropic compression, which acts as a\npotential barrier at the inner turning points of the breathing cycle.\n", "  Stationary expansion shocks have been recently identified as a new type of\nsolution to hyperbolic conservation laws regularized by non-local dispersive\nterms that naturally arise in shallow-water theory. These expansion shocks were\nstudied in (El, Hoefer, Shearer 2016) for the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation\nusing matched asymptotic expansions. In this paper, we extend the analysis of\n(El, Hoefer, Shearer 2016) to the regularized Boussinesq system by using\nRiemann invariants of the underlying dispersionless shallow water equations.\nThe extension for a system is non-trivial, requiring a combination of small\namplitude, long-wave expansions with high order matched asymptotics. The\nconstructed asymptotic solution is shown to be in excellent agreement with\naccurate numerical simulations of the Boussinesq system for a range of\nappropriately smoothed Riemann data.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the galaxy cluster thermal \\ac{sze} signal $Y$\nand pressure profiles using {\\it Magneticum} Pathfinder hydrodynamical\nsimulations. With a sample of 50,000 galaxy clusters ($M_{\\rm\n500c}>1.4\\times10^{14} \\rm M_{\\odot}$) out to $z=2$, we find significant\nvariations in the shape of the pressure profile with mass and redshift and\npresent a new generalized NFW model that follows these trends. We show that the\nthermal pressure at $R_{\\rm 500c}$ accounts for only 80~percent of the pressure\nrequired to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium, and therefore even idealized\nhydrostatic mass estimates would be biased at the 20~percent level. We compare\nthe cluster \\ac{sze} signal extracted from a sphere with different virial-like\nradii, a virial cylinder within a narrow redshift slice and the full light\ncone, confirming small scatter ($\\sigma_{\\ln Y}\\simeq 0.087$) in the sphere and\nshowing that structure immediately surrounding clusters increases the scatter\nand strengthens non self-similar redshift evolution in the cylinder.\nUncorrelated large scale structure along the line of sight leads to an increase\nin the \\ac{sze} signal and scatter that is more pronounced for low mass\nclusters, resulting in non self-similar trends in both mass and redshift and a\nmass dependent scatter that is $\\sim0.16$ at low masses. The scatter\ndistribution is consistent with log-normal in all cases. We present a model of\nthe offsets between the center of the gravitational potential and the \\ac{sze}\ncenter that follows the variations with cluster mass and redshift.\n", "  The spin-flip tunneling rates are measured in GaAs-based double quantum dots\nby time-resolved charge detection. Such processes occur in the Pauli spin\nblockade regime with two electrons occupying the double quantum dot. Ways are\npresented for tuning the spin-flip tunneling rate, which on the one hand gives\naccess to measuring the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin--orbit coefficents. On the\nother hand they make it possible to turn on and off the effect of SOI with a\nhigh on/off-ratio. The tuning is accomplished by choosing the alignment of the\ntunneling direction with respect to the crystallographic axes, as well as by\nchoosing the orientation of the external magnetic field with respect to the\nspin--orbit magnetic field. Spin-lifetimes of 10 s are achieved at a tunnel\nrate close to 1 kHz.\n", "  We investigate methods to vaccinate contact networks -- i.e. removing nodes\nin such a way that disease spreading is hindered as much as possible -- with\nrespect to their cost-efficiency. Any real implementation of such protocols\nwould come with costs related both to the vaccination itself, and gathering of\ninformation about the network. Disregarding this, we argue, would lead to\nerroneous evaluation of vaccination protocols. We use the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered model -- the generic model for diseases making\npatients immune upon recovery -- as our disease-spreading scenario, and analyze\noutbreaks on both empirical and model networks. For different relative costs,\ndifferent protocols dominate. For high vaccination costs and low costs of\ngathering information, the so-called acquaintance vaccination is the most cost\nefficient. For other parameter values, protocols designed for query-efficient\nidentification of the network's largest degrees are most efficient.\n", "  We consider the convergence of the empirical spectral measures of random $N\n\\times N$ unitary matrices. We give upper and lower bounds showing that the\nKolmogorov distance between the spectral measure and the uniform measure on the\nunit circle is of the order $\\log N / N$, both in expectation and almost\nsurely. This implies in particular that the convergence happens more slowly for\nKolmogorov distance than for the $L_1$-Kantorovich distance. The proof relies\non the determinantal structure of the eigenvalue process.\n", "  We numerically study the behavior of spin--$1/2$ fermions on a\ntwo-dimensional square lattice subject to a uniform magnetic field, where\nopposite spins interact via an on-site attractive interaction. Starting from\nthe non-interacting case where each spin population is prepared in a quantum\nHall state with unity filling, we follow the evolution of the system as the\ninteraction strength is increased. Above a critical value and for sufficiently\nlow flux density, we observe the emergence of a twofold quasidegeneracy\naccompanied by the opening of an energy gap to the third level. Analysis of the\nentanglement spectra shows that the gapped ground state is the bosonic $1/2$\nLaughlin state. Our work therefore provides compelling evidence of a\ntopological phase transition from the fermionic quantum Hall state at unity\nfilling to the bosonic Laughlin state at a critical attraction strength.\n", "  The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) are unique local\nlaboratories for studying the formation and evolution of small galaxies in\nexquisite detail. The Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH) is an\nNOAO community DECam survey of the Clouds mapping 480 square degrees\n(distributed over ~2400 square degrees at ~20% filling factor) to ~24th mag in\nugriz with the goal of identifying broadly distributed, low surface brightness\nstellar populations associated with the stellar halos and tidal debris of the\nClouds. SMASH will also derive spatially-resolved star formation histories\ncovering all ages out to large radii from the MCs that will further complement\nour understanding of their formation. Here, we present a summary of the survey,\nits data reduction, and a description of the first public Data Release (DR1).\nThe SMASH DECam data have been reduced with a combination of the NOAO Community\nPipeline, PHOTRED, an automated PSF photometry pipeline based mainly on the\nDAOPHOT suite, and custom calibration software. The attained astrometric\nprecision is ~15 mas and the accuracy is ~2 mas with respect to the Gaia DR1\nastrometric reference frame. The photometric precision is ~0.5-0.7% in griz and\n~1% in u with a calibration accuracy of ~1.3% in all bands. The median 5 sigma\npoint source depths in ugriz bands are 23.9, 24.8, 24.5, 24.2, 23.5 mag. The\nSMASH data already have been used to discover the Hydra II Milky Way satellite,\nthe SMASH 1 old globular cluster likely associated with the LMC, and very\nextended stellar populations around the LMC out to R~18.4 kpc. SMASH DR1\ncontains measurements of ~100 million objects distributed in 61 fields. A\nprototype version of the NOAO Data Lab provides data access, including a data\ndiscovery tool, SMASH database access, an image cutout service, and a Jupyter\nnotebook server with example notebooks for exploratory analysis.\n", "  Controlling nanocircuits at the single electron spin level is a possible\nroute for large-scale quantum information processing. In this context,\nindividual electron spins have been identified as versatile quantum information\ncarriers to interconnect different nodes of a spin-based semiconductor quantum\ncircuit. Despite important experimental efforts to control the electron\ndisplacement over long distances, keeping the electron spin coherence after\ntransfer remained up to now elusive. Here we demonstrate that individual\nelectron spins can be displaced coherently over a distance of 5 micrometers.\nThis displacement is realized on a closed path made of three tunnel-coupled\nlateral quantum dots. Using fast quantum dot control, the electrons tunnel from\none dot to another at a speed approaching 100 m/s. We find that the spin\ncoherence length is 8 times longer than expected from the electron spin\ncoherence without displacement. Such an enhanced spin coherence points at a\nprocess similar to motional narrowing observed in nuclear magnetic resonance\nexperiments6. The demonstrated coherent displacement will enable long-range\ninteraction between distant spin-qubits and will open the route towards\nnon-abelian and holonomic manipulation of a single electron spin.\n", "  We demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of\npicoliter-volume solutions with a nanostructured diamond chip. Using optical\ninterferometric lithography, diamond surfaces were nanostructured with dense,\nhigh-aspect-ratio nanogratings, enhancing the surface area by more than a\nfactor of 15 over mm^2 regions of the chip. The nanograting sidewalls were\ndoped with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers so that more than 10 million NV\ncenters in a (25 micrometer)^2 laser spot are located close enough to the\ndiamond surface (5 nm) to detect the NMR spectrum of 1 pL of fluid lying within\nadjacent nanograting grooves. The platform was used to perform 1H and 19F NMR\nspectroscopy at room temperature in magnetic fields below 50 mT. Using a\nsolution of CsF in glycerol, we demonstrate that 4 +/- 2 x 10^12 19F spins in a\n1 pL volume, can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 in 1 s\nintegration. This represents nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in\nconcentration sensitivity over previous NV and picoliter NMR studies.\n", "  We develop an algorithm for model selection which allows for the\nconsideration of a combinatorially large number of candidate models governing a\ndynamical system. The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model\nselection which typically limits the number candidate models considered due to\nthe intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently\ndeveloped sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the\nsub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows for a\ntractable computation of AIC (Akaike information criteria) or BIC (Bayes\ninformation criteria) scores for the remaining candidate models. The\ninformation criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling\nthe automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support\nin relation to the time series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores\nplace each candidate model in the {\\em strong support}, {\\em weak support} or\n{\\em no support} category. The method correctly identifies several canonical\ndynamical systems, including an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered)\ndisease model and the Lorenz equations, giving the correct dynamical system as\nthe only candidate model with strong support.\n", "  Reversible in operando control of friction is an unsolved challenge crucial\nto industrial tribology. Recent studies show that at low sliding velocities,\nthis control can be achieved by applying an electric field across electrolyte\nlubricants. However, the phenomenology at high sliding velocities is yet\nunknown. In this paper, we investigate the hydrodynamic friction across\nelectrolytes under shear beyond the transition to turbulence. We develop a\nnovel, highly parallelised, numerical method for solving the coupled\nNavier-Stokes Poisson-Nernest-Planck equation. Our results show that turbulent\ndrag cannot be controlled across dilute electrolyte using static electric\nfields alone. The limitations of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck formalism hints at\nways in which turbulent drag could be controlled using electric fields.\n", "  In recent years, graphene growth optimization has been one of the key routes\ntowards large-scale, high-quality graphene production. We have measured in-situ\nresidual gas content during epitaxial graphene growth on silicon carbide (SiC)\nto find detrimental factors of epitaxial graphene growth. The growth conditions\nin high vacuum and purified argon are compared. The grown epitaxial graphene is\nstudied by Raman scattering mapping and mechanical strain, charge density,\nnumber of graphene layers and graphene grain size are evaluated. Charge density\nand carrier mobility has been studied by Hall effect measurements in van der\nPauw configuration. We have identified a major role of chemical reaction of\ncarbon and residual water. The rate of the reaction is lowered when purified\nargon is used. We also show, that according to time varying gas content, it is\npreferable to grow graphene at higher temperatures and shorter times. Other\nsources of growth environment contamination are also discussed. The reaction of\nwater and carbon is discussed to be one of the factors increasing number of\ndefects in graphene. The importance of purified argon and its sufficient flow\nrate is concluded to be important for high-quality graphene growth as it\nreduces the rate of undesired chemical reactions and provides more stable and\ndefined growth ambient.\n", "  We study the discretization of 3d gravity with $\\Lambda=0$ following the loop\nquantum gravity framework. In the process, we realize that different choices of\npolarization are possible. This allows to introduce a new discretization based\non the triad as opposed to the connection as in the standard loop quantum\ngravity framework. We also identify the classical non-trivial symmetries of\ndiscrete gravity, namely the Drinfeld double, given in terms of momentum maps.\nAnother choice of polarization is given by the Chern-Simons formulation of\ngravity. Our framework also provides a new discretization scheme of\nChern-Simons, which keeps track of the link between the continuum variables and\nthe discrete ones. We show how the Poisson bracket we recover between the\nChern-Simons holonomies allows to recover the Goldman bracket. There is also a\ntransparent link between the discrete Chern-Simons formulation and the\ndiscretization of gravity based on the connection (loop gravity) or triad\nvariables (dual loop gravity).\n", "  We study how large functional networks can grow stably under possible\ncascading overload failures and evaluated the maximum stable network size above\nwhich even a small-scale failure would cause a fatal breakdown of the network.\nEmploying a model of cascading failures induced by temporally fluctuating\nloads, the maximum stable size $n_{\\text{max}}$ has been calculated as a\nfunction of the load reduction parameter $r$ that characterizes how quickly the\ntotal load is reduced during the cascade. If we reduce the total load\nsufficiently fast ($r\\ge r_{\\text{c}}$), the network can grow infinitely.\nOtherwise, $n_{\\text{max}}$ is finite and increases with $r$. For a fixed\n$r\\,(<r_{\\text{c}})$, $n_{\\text{max}}$ for a scale-free network is larger than\nthat for an exponential network with the same average degree. We also discuss\nhow one detects and avoids the crisis of a fatal breakdown of the network from\nthe relation between the sizes of the initial network and the largest component\nafter an ordinarily occurring cascading failure.\n", "  In band-like semiconductors, charge carriers form a thermal energy\ndistribution rapidly after optical excitation. In hybrid lead halide\nperovskites, the cooling of such thermal carrier distributions occurs on\ntimescales of ~300 fs via carrier-phonon scattering. However, the initial\nbuild-up of the thermal distribution proved difficult to resolve with\npump-probe techniques due to the requirement of high resolution, both in time\nand in energy. Here, we use two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy with\nsub-10fs resolution to directly observe the carrier interactions that lead to\nthe formation of a thermal carrier distribution. We find that thermalization\noccurs dominantly via carrier-carrier scattering under the investigated\nfluences and report the dependence of carrier scattering rates on excess energy\nand carrier density. We extract characteristic carrier thermalization times\nfrom below 10 fs to 85 fs. These values allow for mobilities of up to 500 cm^2\nV^(-1) s^(-1) at carrier densities lower than 2x10^19 cm^(-3) and limit the\ntime for carrier extraction in hot carrier solar cells.\n", "  $^{57}$Fe M\\\"ossbauer spectra at different temperatures between $\\sim 5$ K\nand $\\sim 300$ K were measured on an oriented mosaic of single crystals of\nCaKFe$_4$As$_4$ . The data indicate that CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ is a well formed\ncompound with narrow spectral lines, no traces of other, Fe - containing,\nsecondary phases in the spectra and no static magnetic order. There is no\ndiscernible feature at the superconducting transition temperature in any of the\nhyperfine parameters. The temperature dependence of the quadrupole splitting\napproximately follows the empirical \"$T^{3/2}$ law\".\n  The hyperfine parameters of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ are compared with those for\nKFe$_2$As$_2$ measured in this work, and the literature data for\nCaFe$_2$As$_2$, and were found to be in between those for these two, ordered,\n122 compounds, in agreement with the gross view of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ as a\nstructural analog of KFe$_2$As$_2$ and CaFe$_2$As$_2$ that has alternating Ca -\nand K - layers in the structure.\n", "  Early theoretical work revealed that the simplest class of autocatalytic\ncycles, known as hypercycles, provide an elegant framework for understanding\nthe evolution of mutualism. Furthermore, hypercycles are highly susceptible to\nparasites, spatial structure constituting a key protection against them.\nHowever, there is an insufficient experimental validation of these theoretical\npredictions, in addition to little knowledge on how environmental conditions\ncould shape the spatial dynamics of hypercycles. Here, we constructed spatially\nextended hypercycles by using synthetic biology as a way to design mutualistic\nand parasitic {\\em E. coli} strains. A mathematical model of the hypercycle\nfront expansion is developed, providing analytic estimates of front speed\npropagation. Moreover, we explore how the environment affects the mutualistic\nconsortium during range expansions. Interestingly, moderate improvements in\nenvironmental conditions (namely, increasing the availability of\ngrowth-limiting amino acids) can lead to a slowing-down of the front speed. Our\nagent-based simulations suggest that opportunistic depletion of environmental\namino acids can lead to subsequent high fractions of stagnant cells at the\nfront, and thus to the slow-down of the front speed. Moreover, environmental\ndeterioration can also shape the interaction of the parasitic strain towards\nthe hypercycle. On the one hand, the parasite is excluded from the population\nduring range expansions in which the two species mutualism can thrive (in\nagreement with a classical theoretical prediction). On the other hand,\nenvironmental deterioration (e.g., associated with toxic chemicals) can lead to\nthe survival of the parasitic strain, while reshaping the interactions within\nthe three-species. The evolutionary and ecological implications for the design\nof synthetic consortia are outlined.\n", "  The challenge of quantum many-body problems comes from the difficulty to\nrepresent large-scale quantum states, which in general requires an\nexponentially large number of parameters. Recently, a connection has been made\nbetween quantum many-body states and the neural network representation\n(\\textit{arXiv:1606.02318}). An important open question is what characterizes\nthe representational power of deep and shallow neural networks, which is of\nfundamental interest due to popularity of the deep learning methods. Here, we\ngive a rigorous proof that a deep neural network can efficiently represent most\nphysical states, including those generated by any polynomial size quantum\ncircuits or ground states of many body Hamiltonians with polynomial-size gaps,\nwhile a shallow network through a restricted Boltzmann machine cannot\nefficiently represent those states unless the polynomial hierarchy in\ncomputational complexity theory collapses.\n", "  The distribution of scientific citations for publications selected with\ndifferent rules (author, topic, institution, country, journal, etc.) collapse\non a single curve if one plots the citations relative to their mean value. We\nfind that the distribution of shares for the Facebook posts re-scale in the\nsame manner to the very same curve with scientific citations. This finding\nsuggests that citations are subjected to the same growth mechanism with\nFacebook popularity measures, being influenced by a statistically similar\nsocial environment and selection mechanism. In a simple master-equation\napproach the exponential growth of the number of publications and a\npreferential selection mechanism leads to a Tsallis-Pareto distribution\noffering an excellent description for the observed statistics. Based on our\nmodel and on the data derived from PubMed we predict that according to the\npresent trend the average citations per scientific publications exponentially\nrelaxes to about 4.\n", "  Remote sensing experiments require high-accuracy, preferably sub-percent,\nline intensities and in response to this need we present computed room\ntemperature line lists for six symmetric isotopologues of carbon dioxide:\n$^{13}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{14}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{17}$O$_2$,\n$^{12}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{17}$O$_2$ and $^{13}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, covering\nthe range 0-8000 \\cm. Our calculation scheme is based on variational nuclear\nmotion calculations and on a reliability analysis of the generated line\nintensities. Rotation-vibration wavefunctions and energy levels are computed\nusing the DVR3D software suite and a high quality semi-empirical potential\nenergy surface (PES), followed by computation of intensities using an\n\\abinitio\\ dipole moment surface (DMS). Four line lists are computed for each\nisotopologue to quantify sensitivity to minor distortions of the PES/DMS.\nReliable lines are benchmarked against recent state-of-the-art measurements and\nagainst the HITRAN2012 database, supporting the claim that the majority of line\nintensities for strong bands are predicted with sub-percent accuracy. Accurate\nline positions are generated using an effective Hamiltonian. We recommend the\nuse of these line lists for future remote sensing studies and their inclusion\nin databases.\n", "  The quantum break-time of a system is the time-scale after which its true\nquantum evolution departs from the classical mean field evolution. For\ncapturing it, a quantum resolution of the classical background - e.g., in terms\nof a coherent state - is required. In this paper, we first consider a simple\nscalar model with anharmonic oscillations and derive its quantum break-time.\nNext, we apply these ideas to de Sitter space. We formulate a simple model of a\nspin-2 field, which for some time reproduces the de Sitter metric and\nsimultaneously allows for its well-defined representation as quantum coherent\nstate of gravitons. The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons\nturns out to be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while\ntheir frequency is given by the de Sitter Hubble parameter. In the\nsemi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known\nproperties of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal\nGibbons-Hawking radiation, all in the language of quantum $S$-matrix\nscatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most importantly, this\nframework allows to capture the $1/N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical\ntreatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite\nquantum break-time of the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times\n$N$. We also point out that the quantum-break time is inversely proportional to\nthe number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum break-time\nimposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes\nmust have smaller cosmological constants. For the maximal, phenomenologically\nacceptable number of species, the observed cosmological constant would saturate\nthis bound if our Universe were $10^{100}$ years old in its entire classical\nhistory.\n", "  The major biochemical networks of the living cell, the network of interacting\ngenes and the network of biochemical reactions, are highly interdependent,\nhowever, they have been studied mostly as separate systems so far. In the last\nyears an appropriate theoretical framework for studying interdependent networks\nhas been developed in the context of statistical physics. Here we study the\ninterdependent network of gene regulation and metabolism of the model organism\nEscherichia coli using the theoretical framework of interdependent networks. In\nparticular we aim at understanding how the biological system can consolidate\nthe conflicting tasks of reacting rapidly to (internal and external)\nperturbations, while being robust to minor environmental fluctuations, at the\nsame time. For this purpose we study the network response to localized\nperturbations and find that the interdependent network is sensitive to gene\nregulatory and protein-level perturbations, yet robust against metabolic\nchanges. This first quantitative application of the theory of interdependent\nnetworks to systems biology shows how studying network responses to localized\nperturbations can serve as a useful strategy for analyzing a wide range of\nother interdependent networks.\n", "  We compute the interaction energies of a two-atom system placed in the middle\nof a perfectly reflecting planar cavity, in the perturbative regime. Explicit\nexpressions are provided for the van der Waals potentials of two polarisable\natomic dipoles as well as for the electrostatic potential of two induced\ndipoles. For the van der Waals potentials, several scenarios are considered,\nnamely, a pair of atoms in their ground states, a pair of atoms both excited,\nand a pair of dissimilar atoms with one of them excited. In addition, the\ncorresponding phase-shift of the two-atom wavefunction is calculated in each\ncase. The effects of the two-dimensional confinement of the electromagnetic\nfield by the cavity are analyzed in each scenario.\n", "  A recent experiment reported the first violation of a Bell correlation\nwitness in a many-body system [Science 352, 441 (2016)]. Following discussions\nin this paper, we address here the question of the statistics required to\nwitness Bell correlated states, i.e. states violating a Bell inequality, in\nsuch experiments. We start by deriving multipartite Bell inequalities involving\nan arbitrary number of measurement settings, two outcomes per party and one-\nand two-body correlators only. Based on these inequalities, we then build up\nimproved witnesses able to detect Bell-correlated states in many-body systems\nusing two collective measurements only. These witnesses can potentially detect\nBell correlations in states with an arbitrarily low amount of spin squeezing.\nWe then establish an upper bound on the statistics needed to convincingly\nconclude that a measured state is Bell-correlated.\n", "  The study of the geometry of Calabi-Yau fourfolds is relevant for\ncompactifications of string theory, M-theory, and F-theory to various\ndimensions. This work introduces the mathematical machinery to derive the\ncomplete moduli dependence of the periods of non-trivial three-forms for\nfourfolds realized as hypersurfaces in toric ambient spaces. It sets the stage\nto determine Picard-Fuchs-type differential equations and integral expressions\nfor these forms. The key tool is the observation that non-trivial three-forms\non hypersurfaces in toric ambient spaces always stem from divisors that are\nbuild out of toric resolution trees fibered over Riemann surfaces. The\nthree-form periods are then non-trivially related to the one-form periods of\nthese surfaces. In general, the three-form periods are known to vary\nholomorphically over the complex structure moduli space and play an important\nrole in the effective actions arising in fourfold compactifications. We discuss\ntwo explicit example fourfolds for F-theory compactifications in which the\nthree-form periods determine axion decay constants.\n", "  Using a combination of numerically exact and renormalization-group techniques\nwe study the nonequilibrium transport of electrons in an one-dimensional\ninteracting system subject to a quasiperiodic potential. For this purpose we\ncalculate the growth of the mean-square displacement as well as the melting of\ndomain walls. While the system is nonintegrable for all studied parameters,\nthere is no on finite region default of parameters for which we observe\ndiffusive transport. In particular, our model shows a rich dynamical behavior\ncrossing over from superdiffusion to subdiffusion. We discuss the implications\nof our results for the general problem of many-body localization, with a\nparticular emphasis on the rare region Griffiths picture of subdiffusion.\n", "  Entanglement is the basic building block of linear optical quantum\ncomputation, and as such understanding how to generate it in detail is of great\nimportance for optical architectures. We prove that Bell states cannot be\ngenerated using only 3 photons in the dual-rail encoding, and give strong\nnumerical evidence for the optimality of the existing 4 photon schemes. In a\nsetup with a single photon in each input mode, we find a fundamental limit on\nthe possible entanglement between a single mode Alice and arbitrary Bob. We\ninvestigate and compare other setups aimed at characterizing entanglement in\nsettings more general than dual-rail encoding. The results draw attention to\nthe trade-off between the entanglement a state has and the probability of\npostselecting that state, which can give surprising constant bounds on\nentanglement even with increasing numbers of photons.\n", "  Assuming the existence of a local, analytic, unitary UV completion in a\nPoincar\\'{e} invariant scalar field theory with a mass gap, we derive an\ninfinite number of positivity requirements using the known properties of the\namplitude at and away from the forward scattering limit. These take the form of\nbounds on combinations of the pole subtracted scattering amplitude and its\nderivatives. In turn, these positivity requirements act as constraints on the\noperator coefficients in the low energy effective theory. For certain theories\nthese constraints can be used to place an upper bound on the mass of the next\nlightest state that must lie beyond the low energy effective theory if such a\nUV completion is to ever exist.\n", "  Open-flavour meson studies are the necessary completion to any comprehensive\ninvestigation of quarkonia. We extend recent studies of quarkonia in the\nDyson-Schwinger-Bethe-Salpeter-equation approach to explore their results for\nall possible flavour combinations. Within the inherent limitations of the\nsetup, we present the most comprehensive results for meson masses and leptonic\ndecay constants currently available and put them in perspective with respect to\nexperiment and other approaches.\n", "  In a matrix model of pure $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory, boundaries emerge in the\nspace of $\\textrm{Mat}_{3}(\\mathbb{R})$ and the Hamiltonian requires boundary\nconditions. We show the existence of edge localized glueball states which can\nhave negative energies. These edge levels can be lifted to positive energies if\nthe gluons acquire a London-like mass. This suggests a new phase of QCD with an\nincompressible bulk.\n", "  The recent progress in the theory of generalized Lambert functions makes\npossible to solve exactly the Weiss equation of ferromagnetism. However, this\nsolution is quite inconvenient for practical purposes. Precise approximate\nanalytical solutions are obtained, giving the temperature dependence of the\nspontaneous magnetization, and also the dependence of the magnetization on both\ntemperature and external magnetic field. The experimental relevance of these\nresults, mainly for the determination of the Curie temperature, is discussed.\n", "  Combining experiments and theory, we address the dynamics of self-propelled\nparticles in crowded environments. We first demonstrate that motile colloids\ncruising at constant speed through random lattices undergo a smooth transition\nfrom diffusive, to subdiffusive, to localized dynamics upon increasing the\nobstacle density. We then elucidate the nature of these transitions by\nperforming extensive simulations constructed from a detailed analysis of the\ncolloid-obstacle interactions. We evidence that repulsion at a distance and\nhard-core interactions both contribute to slowing down the long-time diffusion\nof the colloids. In contrast, the localization transition stems solely from\nexcluded-volume interactions and occurs at the void-percolation threshold.\nWithin this critical scenario, equivalent to that of the random Lorentz gas,\ngenuine asymptotic subdiffusion is found only at the critical density where the\nmotile particles explore a fractal maze.\n", "  We benchmark a variant of the recently introduced DMRG-X algorithm against\nexact results for the localized random field XX chain. We find that the\neigenstates obtained via DMRG-X exhibit a highly accurate l-bit description for\nsystem sizes much bigger than the direct, many body, exact diagonalization in\nthe spin variables is able to access. We take advantage of the underlying free\nfermion description of the XX model to accurately test the strengths and\nlimitations of this algorithm for large system sizes. We discuss the\ntheoretical constraints on the performance of the algorithm from the\nentanglement properties of the eigenstates, and its actual performance at\ndifferent values of disorder. A small but significant improvement to the\nalgorithm is also presented, which helps significantly with convergence. We\nfind that at high entanglement, DMRG-X shows a bias towards eigenstates with\nlow entanglement, but can be improved with increased bond dimension. This\nresult suggests that one must be careful when applying the algorithm for\ninteracting many body localized spin models near a transition.\n", "  We revisit the static potential for the $Q Q \\bar Q \\bar Q$ system using\nSU(3) lattice simulations, studying both the colour singlets groundstate and\nfirst excited state. We consider geometries where the two static quarks and the\ntwo anti-quarks are at the corners of rectangles of different sizes. We analyse\nthe transition between a tetraquark system and a two meson system with a two by\ntwo correlator matrix. We compare the potentials computed with quenched QCD and\nwith dynamical quarks. We also compare our simulations with the results of\nprevious studies and analyze quantitatively fits of our results with anzatse\ninspired in the string flip-flop model and in its possible colour excitations.\n", "  The true ground state of hadronic matter may be strange quark matter (SQM).\nConsequently, the observed pulsars may actually be strange quark stars, but not\nneutron stars. However, proving or disproving the SQM hypothesis still remains\nto be a difficult problem, due to the similarity between the macroscopical\ncharacteristics of strange quark stars and neutron stars. Here we propose a\nhopeful method to probe the existence of strange quark matter. In the frame\nwork of the SQM hypothesis, strange quark dwarfs and even strange quark planets\ncan also stably exist. Noting that SQM planets will not be tidally disrupted\neven when they get very close to their host stars due to their extreme\ncompactness, we argue that we could identify SQM planets by searching for very\nclose-in planets among extrasolar planetary systems. Especially, we should keep\nour eyes on possible pulsar planets with orbital radius less than $\\sim 5.6\n\\times 10^{10}$~cm and period less than $\\sim 6100$~s. A thorough search in the\ncurrently detected $\\sim 2950$ exoplanets around normal main sequence stars has\nfailed to identify any stable close-in objects that meet the SQM criteria, i.e.\nlying in the tidal disruption region for normal matter planets. However, the\npulsar planet PSR J1719-1438B, with an orbital radius of $\\sim 6 \\times\n10^{10}$~cm and orbital period of $7837$~s, is encouragingly found to be a good\ncandidate.\n", "  A novel single-lead f-wave extraction algorithm based on the modern diffusion\ngeometry data analysis framework is proposed. The algorithm is essentially an\naveraged beat subtraction algorithm, where the ventricular activity template is\nestimated by combining a newly designed metric, the \"diffusion distance,\" and\nthe non-local Euclidean median based on the non-linear manifold setup. We\ncoined the algorithm DD-NLEM. Two simulation schemes are considered, and the\nnew algorithm DD-NLEM outperforms traditional algorithms, including the average\nbeat subtraction, principal component analysis, and adaptive singular value\ncancellation, in different evaluation metrics with statistical significance.\nThe clinical potential is shown in the real Holter signal, and we introduce a\nnew score to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.\n", "  The ability to engineer and manipulate different types of quantum mechanical\nobjects allows us to take advantage of their unique properties and create\nuseful hybrid technologies. Thus far, complex quantum states and exquisite\nquantum control have been demonstrated in systems ranging from trapped ions to\nsuperconducting resonators. Recently, there have been many efforts to extend\nthese demonstrations to the motion of complex, macroscopic objects. These\nmechanical objects have important applications as quantum memories or\ntransducers for measuring and connecting different types of quantum systems. In\nparticular, there have been a few experiments that couple motion to nonlinear\nquantum objects such as superconducting qubits. This opens up the possibility\nof creating, storing, and manipulating non-Gaussian quantum states in\nmechanical degrees of freedom. However, before sophisticated quantum control of\nmechanical motion can be achieved, we must realize systems with long coherence\ntimes while maintaining a sufficient interaction strength. These systems should\nbe implemented in a simple and robust manner that allows for increasing\ncomplexity and scalability in the future. Here we experimentally demonstrate a\nhigh frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator that is strongly coupled to a\nsuperconducting qubit using piezoelectric transduction. In contrast to previous\nexperiments with qubit-mechanical systems, our device requires only simple\nfabrication methods, extends coherence times to many microseconds, and provides\ncontrollable access to a multitude of phonon modes. We use this system to\ndemonstrate basic quantum operations on the coupled qubit-phonon system.\nStraightforward improvements to the current device will allow for advanced\nprotocols analogous to what has been shown in optical and microwave resonators,\nresulting in a novel resource for implementing hybrid quantum technologies.\n", "  Semi-local density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy of\nelectrons are extensively used as it produce realistic and accurate results for\nfinite and extended systems. The choice of techniques play crucial role in\nconstructing such functionals of improved accuracy and efficiency. An accurate\nand efficient semi-local exchange energy functional in two dimensions is\nconstructed by making use of the corresponding hole based on the density matrix\nexpansion. The exchange hole involved is localized under the generalized\ncoordinate transformation and satisfies all the relevant constraints.\nComprehensive testing and excellent performance of the functional is\ndemonstrated versus exact exchange results. The functional also achieves\nremarkable accuracy by substantially reducing the errors present in the local\nand non-empirical density functionals proposed so far for two dimensional\nsystems. The underlying principles involved in the functional construction are\nphysically appealing and practically useful for developing range separated and\nnon-local functionals in two dimensions.\n", "  Heavy sterile neutrinos with masses below $M_W$ can induce trilepton events\nat the 14 TeV LHC through purely leptonic $W$ decays of $W^\\pm \\to e^\\pm e^\\pm\n\\mu^\\mp \\nu$ and $\\mu^\\pm \\mu^\\pm e^\\mp \\nu$ where the heavy neutrino will be\nin an intermediate state on its mass shell. Discovery and exclusion limits for\nthe heavy neutrinos are found using both Cut-and-Count (CC) and a Multi-Variate\nAnalysis (MVA) methods in this study. We also show that it is possible to\ndiscriminate between a Dirac and a Majorana heavy neutrino, even when lepton\nnumber conservation cannot be directly tested due to unobservability of the\nfinal state neutrino. This discrimination is done by exploiting a combined set\nof kinematic observables that differ between the Majorana vs. Dirac cases. We\nfind that the MVA method can greatly enhance the discovering and discrimination\nlimits in comparison with the CC method. For a 14-TeV $pp$ collider with\nintegrated luminosity of 3000 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$, sterile neutrinos can be found\nwith 5$\\sigma$ significance if heavy-to-light neutrino mixings $|U_{Ne}|^2 \\sim\n|U_{N\\mu}|^2 \\sim 10^{-6}$, while the Majorana vs. Dirac type can be\ndistinguished if $|U_{Ne}|^2 \\sim |U_{N\\mu}|^2 \\sim 10^{-5}$ or even\n$|U_{N\\ell}|^2\\sim 10^{-6}$ if one of the mixing elements is at least an order\nof magnitude smaller than the other.\n", "  We study SIS epidemic spreading processes unfolding on a recent\ngeneralisation of the activity-driven modelling framework. In this model of\ntime-varying networks each node is described by two variables: activity and\nattractiveness. The first, describes the propensity to form connections. The\nsecond, defines the propensity to attract them. We derive analytically the\nepidemic threshold considering the timescale driving the evolution of contacts\nand the contagion as comparable. The solutions are general and hold for any\njoint distribution of activity and attractiveness. The theoretical picture is\nconfirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering\nheterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two\nvariables. We find that heterogeneous distributions of attractiveness alter the\ncontagion process. In particular, in case of uncorrelated and positive\ncorrelations between the two variables, heterogeneous attractiveness\nfacilitates the spreading. On the contrary, negative correlations between\nactivity and attractiveness hamper the spreading. The results presented\ncontribute to the understanding of the dynamical properties of time-varying\nnetworks and their effects on contagion phenomena unfolding on their fabric.\n", "  We identify and characterize a new class of fingering instabilities in liquid\nmetals; these instabilities are unexpected due to the large interfacial tension\nof metals. Electrochemical oxidation lowers the effective interfacial tension\nof a gallium-based liquid metal alloy to values approaching zero, thereby\ninducing drastic shape changes, including the formation of fractals. The\nmeasured fractal dimension ($D = 1.3 \\pm 0.05$) places the instability in a\ndifferent universality class than other fingering instabilities. By\ncharacterizing changes in morphology and dynamics as a function of droplet\nvolume and applied electric potential, we identify the three main forces\ninvolved in this process: interfacial tension, gravity, and oxidative stress.\nImportantly, we find that electrochemical oxidation can generate compressive\ninterfacial forces that oppose the tensile forces at a liquid interface. Thus,\nthe surface oxide layer not only induces instabilities, but ultimately provides\na physical barrier that halts the instabilities at larger positive potentials.\nControlling the competition between surface tension and oxidative (compressive)\nstresses at the interface is important for the development of reconfigurable\nelectronic, electromagnetic, and optical devices that take advantage of the\nmetallic properties of liquid metals.\n", "  We extend the effective theory approach to the ideal fluid limit where the\npolarization of the fluid is non-zero. After describing and motivating the\nequations of motion, we expand them around the hydrostatic limit, obtaining the\nsound wave and vortex degrees of freedom. We discuss how the presence of\npolarization affects the stability and causality of the ideal fluid limit.\n", "  Quantum modifications to black holes on scales comparable to the horizon\nsize, or even more radical physics, are apparently needed to reconcile the\nexistence of black holes with the principles of quantum mechanics. This piece\ngives an overview of some possible observational tests for such departures from\na classical description of black holes, via gravitational wave detection and\nvery long baseline interferometry. (Invited comment for Nature Astronomy.)\n", "  We test whether advanced galaxy models and analysis techniques of simulations\ncan alleviate the Too Big To Fail problem (TBTF) for late-type galaxies, which\nstates that isolated dwarf galaxy kinematics imply that dwarfs live in\nlower-mass halos than is expected in a {\\Lambda}CDM universe. Furthermore, we\nwant to explain this apparent tension between theory and observations. To do\nthis, we use the MoRIA suite of dwarf galaxy simulations to investigate whether\nobservational effects are involved in TBTF for late-type field dwarf galaxies.\nTo this end, we create synthetic radio data cubes of the simulated MoRIA\ngalaxies and analyse their HI kinematics as if they were real, observed\ngalaxies. We find that for low-mass galaxies, the circular velocity profile\ninferred from the HI kinematics often underestimates the true circular velocity\nprofile, as derived directly from the enclosed mass. Fitting the HI kinematics\nof MoRIA dwarfs with a theoretical halo profile results in a systematic\nunderestimate of the mass of their host halos. We attribute this effect to the\nfact that the interstellar medium of a low-mass late-type dwarf is continuously\nstirred by supernova explosions into a vertically puffed-up, turbulent state to\nthe extent that the rotation velocity of the gas is simply no longer a good\ntracer of the underlying gravitational force field. If this holds true for real\ndwarf galaxies as well, it implies that they inhabit more massive dark matter\nhalos than would be inferred from their kinematics, solving TBTF for late-type\nfield dwarf galaxies.\n", "  The current cosmological model ($\\Lambda$CDM) with the underlying FLRW metric\nrelies on the assumption of local isotropy, hence homogeneity of the Universe.\nDifficulties arise when one attempts to justify this model as an average\ndescription of the Universe from first principles of general relativity, since\nin general, the Einstein tensor built from the averaged metric is not equal to\nthe averaged stress--energy tensor. In this context, the discrepancy between\nthese quantities is called \"cosmological backreaction\" and has been the subject\nof scientific debate among cosmologists and relativists for more than $20$\nyears. Here we present one of the methods to tackle this problem, i.e.\naveraging the scalar parts of the Einstein equations, together with its\napplication, the cosmological mass function of galaxy clusters.\n", "  Self-consistent treatment of cosmological structure formation and expansion\nwithin the context of classical general relativity may lead to \"extra\"\nexpansion above that expected in a structureless universe. We argue that in\ncomparison to an early-epoch, extrapolated Einstein-de Sitter model, about\n10-15% \"extra\" expansion is sufficient at the present to render superfluous the\n\"dark energy\" 68% contribution to the energy density budget, and that this is\nobservationally realistic.\n", "  We explore neutrino mass hierarchy determination and CP-phase measurement\nusing multi-megaton water Cherenkov detector KM3NeT-Oscillation Research with\nCosmics in the Abyss (ORCA) in the Mediterranean sea receiving neutrino beam\nfrom the Fermilab Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) over 6900 km baseline.\nWe find that with the proposed beam luminosity of $1.2\\times 10^{21}$\nproton-on-target per year, it will be possible to determine mass hierarchy at\n$\\gtrsim 4\\,\\sigma$ confidence level within 1 year in the neutrino mode alone.\nA combined 1 year in neutrino and 1 year in antineutrino mode can determine\nhierarchy at $\\gtrsim 6\\,\\sigma$ confidence level. We also find that a non-zero\nCP-phase can be detected with up to $\\sim 1.8\\,\\sigma$ significance after 10\nyears of data taking. We explore degeneracy of neutrino oscillation parameters\nand uncertainties in detection efficiencies affecting the results.\n", "  Recent Pan-STARRS data show that the leading arm from the globular cluster\nPalomar 5 (Pal 5) appears shorter than the trailing arm, while simulations of\nPal 5 predict similar angular extents. We demonstrate that including the\nspinning Galactic bar with appropriate pattern speeds in the dynamical modeling\nof Pal 5 can reproduce the Pan-STARRS data. As the bar sweeps by, some stream\nstars experience a difference in net torques near pericenter. This leads to the\nformation of apparent gaps along Pal 5's tidal streams and these gaps grow due\nto an energy offset from the rest of the stream members. We conclude that only\nstreams orbiting far from the Galactic center or streams on retrograde orbits\n(with respect to the bar) can be used to unambiguously constrain dark matter\nsubhalo interactions. Additionally, we expect that the Pal 5 leading arm debris\nshould re-appear south of the Pan-STARRS density truncation.\n", "  We study inclusive charm and bottom production, for both D and B mesons, in\np-Pb collisions at the LHC. Numerical results for p_T-differential production\ncross sections are obtained at next-to-leading-order in the general-mass\nvariable-flavor-number scheme. We compare our results with recent data from\nALICE, LHCb and CMS at a center-of-mass energy of 5 TeV and find good\nagreement. A comparison with p-p cross sections does not reveal the presence of\nnuclear initial-state interaction effects that could be expected to become\nvisible as deviations of the ratio of p-Pb and p-p cross sections from one.\n", "  The Universal Extra Dimension (UED) paradigm is particularly attractive as it\nnot only includes a natural candidate for the Dark Matter particle but also\naddresses several issues related to particle physics. Non-observations at the\nLarge Hadron Collider, though, has brought the paradigm into severe tension.\nHowever, a particular 5-dimensional UED model emerges from a six-dimensional\nspace-time with nested warping. The $AdS_6$ bulk protects both the Higgs mass\nas well as the UED scale without invoking unnatural parameter values. The\ngraviton excitations in the sixth direction open up new (co-)annihilation\nchannels for the Dark Matter particle, thereby allowing for phenomenological\nconsistency, otherwise denied to the minimal UED scenario. The model leads to\nunique signatures in both satellite-based experiments as well as the LHC.\n", "  Few-layer black phosphorus possesses unique electronic properties giving rise\nto distinct quantum phenomena and thus offers a fertile platform to explore the\nemergent correlation phenomena in low dimensions. A great progress has been\ndemonstrated in improving the quality of hole-doped few-layer black phosphorus\nand its quantum transport studies, whereas the same achievements are rather\nmodest for electron-doped few-layer black phosphorus. Here, we report the\nambipolar quantum transport in few-layer black phosphorus exhibiting\nundoubtedly the quantum Hall effect for hole transport and showing clear\nsignatures of the quantum Hall effect for electron transport. By bringing the\nspin-resolved Landau levels of the electron-doped black phosphorus to the\ncoincidence, we measure the spin susceptibility $\\chi_s=m^\\ast\ng^\\ast=1.1\\pm0.03$. This value is larger than for hole-doped black phosphorus\nand illustrates an energetically equidistant arrangement of spin-resolved\nLandau levels. Evidently, the n-type black phosphorus offers a unique platform\nwith equidistant sequence of spin-up and spin-down states for exploring the\nquantum spintronic.\n", "  G\\\"{o}del universe is a homogeneous rotating dust with negative $\\Lambda$\nwhich is a direct product of three dimensional pure rotation metric with a\nline. We would generalize it to higher dimensions for Einstein and pure\nLovelock gravity with only one $N$th order term. For higher dimensional\ngeneralization, we have to include more rotations in the metric, and hence we\nshall begin with the corresponding pure rotation odd $(d=2n+1)$-dimensional\nmetric involving $n$ rotations, which eventually can be extended by a direct\nproduct with a line or a space of constant curvature for yielding higher\ndimensional G\\\"{o}del universe. The considerations of $n$ rotations and also of\nconstant curvature spaces is a new line of generalization and is being\nconsidered for the first time.\n", "  It has recently become possible to study the dynamics of information\ndiffusion in techno-social systems at scale, due to the emergence of online\nplatforms, such as Twitter, with millions of users. One question that\nsystematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or\ncomplex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an\nindependent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this\nprobability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing\nabove some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are\nobservational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding\nfactors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network\ncommunity structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we\nperformed on Twitter using `social bots' deployed to carry out coordinated\nattempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models\ndescribing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing\nhypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model\ndescribes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than\nsimple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective\ndefenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved\nmarketing and advertisement strategies, and design of effective network\nintervention techniques.\n", "  Nanoscale thermally assisted hydrodynamic melt perturbations induced by\nultrafast laser energy deposition in noble-metal films produce irreversible\nnanoscale translative mass redistributions and results in formation of\nradially-symmetric frozen surface structures. We demonstrate that the final\nthree-dimensional (3D) shape of the surface structures formed after\nresolidification of the molten part of the film is shown to be governed by\nincident laser fluence and, more importantly, predicted theoretically via\nmolecular dynamics modeling. Considering the underlying physical processes\nassociated with laser-induced energy absorption, electron-ion energy exchange,\nacoustic relaxation and hydrodynamic flows, the theoretical approach separating\nslow and fast physical processes and combining hybrid analytical\ntwo-temperature calculations, scalable molecular-dynamics simulations, and a\nsemi-analytical thin-shell model was shown to provide accurate prediction of\nthe final nanoscale solidified morphologies, fully consistent with direct\nelectron-microscopy visualization of nanoscale focused ion-beam cuts of the\nsurface structures produced at different incident laser fluences. Finally,\nthese results are in reasonable quantitative agreement with mass distribution\nprofiles across the surface nanostructures, provided by their noninvasive and\nnon-destructive nanoscale characterization based on energy-dispersive x-ray\nfluorescence spectroscopy, operating at variable electron-beam energies.\n", "  We present a comprehensive comparison of the spin-aligned effective-one-body\n(EOB) waveform model of Nagar et al. [Phys. Rev. D93, 044046 (2016)], informed\nusing 40 numerical-relativity (NR) datasets, against a set of 149, $\\ell=m=2$,\nNR waveforms freely available through the Simulation Extreme Spacetime (SXS)\ncatalog. We find that, without further calibration, these EOBNR waveforms have\nunfaithfulness (at design Advanced-LIGO sensitivity and evaluated with total\nmass $M$ varying as $10M_\\odot\\leq M \\leq 200M_\\odot$) always below $1\\%$\nagainst all NR waveforms except for three outliers, that still never exceed the\n$3\\%$ level; with a minimal retuning of the (effective)\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order spin-orbit coupling parameter for the\nnon-equal-mass and non-equal-spin sector, that only needs three more NR\nwaveforms, one is left with another two (though different) outliers, with\nmaximal unfaithfulness of up to only $2\\%$ for a total mass of $200M_\\odot$. We\nshow this is the effect of slight inaccuracies in the phenomenological\ndescription of the postmerger waveform of Del Pozzo and Nagar\n[arXiv:1606.03952] that was constructed by interpolating over only 40NR\nsimulations. We argue that this is easily fixed by using either an alternative\nringdown description (e.g., the superposition of quasi-normal-modes) or an\nimproved version of the phenomenological representation. By analyzing a NR\nwaveform with mass ratio $8$ and dimensionless spins $+0.85$ obtained with the\nBAM code, we conclude that the model would benefit from NR simulations\nspecifically targeted at improving the postmerger-ringdown phenomenological\nfits for mass ratios $\\gtrsim 8$ and spins $\\gtrsim 0.8$.\n", "  New scalars from an extended Higgs sector could have weak scale masses and\nstill have escaped detection. In a Type I Two Higgs Doublet Model, for\ninstance, even the charged Higgs can be lighter than the top quark. Because\nelectroweak production of these scalars is modest, the greatest opportunity for\ntheir detection might come from rare top decays. For mass hierarchies of the\ntype $m_t>m_{H^\\pm}>m_{A^0,\\,H^0}$, the natural signal can arise from top quark\npair production, followed by the decay chain $t \\rightarrow b\\,H^+$, $H^+\n\\rightarrow W^{+(*)} \\phi^0$, $\\phi^0\\rightarrow b\\overline{b},\\,\\tau^+\\tau^-$,\nwhere $\\phi^0=A^0,\\,H^0$. These final states largely overlap with those of the\nStandard Model $t\\,\\bar{t}\\,H^0_{_\\text{SM}}$ process, and therefore can\npotentially contaminate $t\\,\\bar{t}\\,H^0_{_\\text{SM}}$ searches. We demonstrate\nthat existing $t\\,\\bar{t}\\,H^0_{_\\text{SM}}$ analyses can already probe light\nextended Higgs sectors, and we derive new constraints from their results.\nFurthermore, we note that existing excesses in $t\\,\\bar{t}\\,H^0_{_\\text{SM}}$\nsearches can be naturally explained by the contamination of rare top decays to\nnew light Higgses. We discuss how to distinguish this signal from the Standard\nModel process.\n", "  We consider the production at the LHC of exotic composite quarks of charge\n$Q=+(5/3) e$ and $Q=-(4/3) e$. Such states are predicted in composite models of\nhigher isospin multiplets ($I_W=1$ or $I_W=3/2$). Given their exotic charges\n(such as $5/3$), their decays proceed through the electroweak interactions. We\ncompute decay widths and rates for resonant production of the exotic quarks at\nthe LHC. Partly motivated by the recent observation of an excess by the CMS\ncollaboration in the $e\\not p_T jj$ final state signature we focus on $ pp \\to\nU^+ j \\to W^+ + j\\, j\\, \\to \\ell^+\\not p_T jj$ and then perform a fast\nsimulation of the detector reconstruction based on DELPHES. We then scan the\nparameter space of the model ($m_*=\\Lambda$) and study the statistical\nsignificance of the signal against the relevant standard model background\n($Wjj$ followed by leptonic decay of the $W$ gauge boson) providing the\nluminosity curves as function of $m_*$ for discovery at 3- and 5-$\\sigma$\nlevel.\n", "  Networks of interacting, communicating subsystems are common in many fields,\nfrom ecology, biology, epidemiology to engineering and robotics. In the\npresence of noise and uncertainty, inter- actions between the individual\ncomponents can lead to unexpected complex system-wide behaviors. In this paper,\nwe consider a generic model of two weakly coupled dynamical systems, and show\nhow noise in one part of the system is transmitted through the coupling\ninterface. Working synergistically with the coupling, the noise on one system\ndrives a large fluctuation in the other, even when there is no noise in the\nsecond system. Moreover, the large fluctuation happens while the first system\nexhibits only small random oscillations. Uncertainty effects are quantified by\nshowing how characteristic time scales of noise induced switching scale as a\nfunction of the coupling between the two coupled parts of the experiment. In\naddition, our results show that the probability of switching in the noise-free\nsystem scales inversely as the square of reduced noise intensity amplitude,\nrendering the virtual probability of switching to be an extremely rare event.\nOur results showing the interplay between transmitted noise and coupling are\nalso confirmed through simulations, which agree quite well with analytic\ntheory.\n", "  This paper is a survey on exponential integrators to solve cubic-quintic\ncomplex Ginzburg-Landau equations and related stiff problems. In particular, we\nare interested in accurate computation near the pulsating and exploding soliton\nsolutions where different time scales exist. We explore stepsize-adaptive\nvariations of three types of exponential integrators: integrating factor (IF)\nmethods, exponential Runge-Kutta (ERK) methods and split-step (SS) methods, and\ntheir embedded versions for computation and comparison. We present the details,\nderive formulas for completeness, and consider seven different\nstepsize-adaptive integrating schemes to solve the cubic-quintic complex\nGinzburg-Landau equation. Moreover, we propose using a comoving frame to\nresolve fast phase rotation for better performance. We present thorough\ncomparisons and experiments in the one- and two-dimensional cubic-quintic\ncomplex Ginzburg-Landau equations.\n", "  Multicellular chemotaxis can occur via individually chemotaxing cells that\nare mechanically coupled. Alternatively, it can emerge collectively, from cells\nchemotaxing differently in a group than they would individually. Here we\nconsider collective movement that emerges from cells on the exterior of the\ncollective responding to chemotactic signals, whereas bulk cells remain\nuninvolved in sensing and directing the collective. We find that the precision\nof this type of emergent chemotaxis is higher than that of individual-based\nchemotaxis for one-dimensional cell chains and two-dimensional cell sheets, but\nnot three-dimensional cell clusters. We describe the physical origins of these\nresults, discuss their biological implications, and show how they can be tested\nusing common experimental measures such as the chemotactic index.\n", "  We construct the Siegel modular forms associated with the theta lift of\ntwisted elliptic genera of $K3$ orbifolded with $g'$ corresponding to the\nconjugacy classes of the Mathieu group $M_{24}$. We complete the construction\nfor all the classes which belong to $M_{23} \\subset M_{24}$ and two other\nclasses outside the subgroup $M_{23}$. For this purpose we provide the explicit\nexpressions for all the twisted elliptic genera in all the sectors of these\nclasses.\n  We show that the Siegel modular forms satisfy the required properties for\nthem to be generating functions of $1/4$ BPS dyons of type II string theories\ncompactified on $K3\\times T^2$ and orbifolded by $g'$ which acts as a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ automorphism on $K3$ together with a $1/N$ shift on a circle of\n$T^2$. In particular the inverse of these Siegel modular forms admit a Fourier\nexpansion with integer coefficients together with the right sign as predicted\nfrom black hole physics. Our analysis completes the construction of the\npartition function for dyons as well as the twisted elliptic genera for all the\n$7$ CHL compactifications.\n", "  Motivated by the possibility of electrochemical control of phase separation,\na variational theory of thermodynamic stability is developed for driven\nreactive mixtures, based on a nonlinear generalization of the Cahn-Hilliard and\nAllen-Cahn equations. The Glansdorff-Prigogine stability criterion is extended\nfor driving chemical work, based on variations of nonequilibrium Gibbs free\nenergy. Linear stability is generally determined by the competition of chemical\ndiffusion and driven autocatalysis. Novel features arise for electrochemical\nsystems, related to controlled total current (galvanostatic operation),\nconcentration-dependent exchange current (Butler-Volmer kinetics), and negative\ndifferential reaction resistance (Marcus kinetics). The theory shows how\nspinodal decomposition can be controlled by solo-autocatalytic charge transfer,\nwith only a single Faradaic reaction. Experimental evidence is presented for\nintercalation and electrodeposition in rechargeable batteries, and further\napplications are discussed in solid state ionics, electrovariable optics,\nelectrochemical precipitation, and biological pattern formation.\n", "  We propose that there is a regime of quantum gravity phenomena, for the case\nthat the cosmological constant is small and positive, which concerns phenomena\nat temperatures below the deSitter temperature, or length scales larger than\nthe horizon. We observe that the standard form of the equivalence principle\ndoes not apply in this regime; we consider instead that a weakened form of the\nequivalence principle might hold in which the ratio of gravitational to\ninertial mass is a function of environmental and global parameters. We consider\npossible principles to determine that function. These lead to behaviour that,\nin the limit of hbar to zero and the speed of light is taken to infinity,\nreproduces the modifications of Newtonian dynamics first proposed by Milgrom.\nThus MOND is elucidated as coding the physics of a novel regime of quantum\ngravity phenomena.\n  We propose also an effective description of this regime in terms of a\nbi-metric theory, valid in the approximation where the metric is static. This\npredicts a new effect, which modifies gravity for radial motions.\n", "  Even as we advance the frontiers of physics knowledge, our understanding of\nhow this knowledge evolves remains at the descriptive levels of Popper and\nKuhn. Using the APS publications data sets, we ask in this letter how new\nknowledge is built upon old knowledge. We do so by constructing year-to-year\nbibliographic coupling networks, and identify in them validated communities\nthat represent different research fields. We then visualize their evolutionary\nrelationships in the form of alluvial diagrams, and show how they remain intact\nthrough APS journal splits. Quantitatively, we see that most fields undergo\nweak Popperian mixing, and it is rare for a field to remain isolated/undergo\nstrong mixing. The sizes of fields obey a simple linear growth with\nrecombination. We can also reliably predict the merging between two fields, but\nnot for the considerably more complex splitting. Finally, we report a case\nstudy of two fields that underwent repeated merging and splitting around 1995,\nand how these Kuhnian events are correlated with breakthroughs on BEC, quantum\nteleportation, and slow light. This impact showed up quantitatively in the\ncitations of the BEC field as a larger proportion of references from during and\nshortly after these events.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a hierarchical three-body system in the\ngeneral-relativistic regime: an extreme mass-ratio inner binary under the tidal\ninfluence of an external body. The inner binary consists of a central\nSchwarzschild black hole and a compact test body moving around it (outer\nbinary). We discover three types of tidal effects on the orbit of the test\nbody. First, the angular moment of the inner binary precesses around the\nangular momentum of the outer binary. Second, the tidal field drives a\n\"transient resonance\" when the radial and azimuthal frequencies are\ncommensurate with each other. In contrast with resonances driven by the\ngravitational self-force, this tidal-driven resonance may boost the orbital\nangular momentum. Finally, as an orbit-dynamical effect during the non-resonant\nphase, we calculate the correction to the Innermost Stable Circular (mean)\nOrbit (ISCO) due to the tidal interaction. Hierarchical three-body systems are\npotential sources for future space-based gravitational wave missions and the\ntidal effects that we find could contribute significantly to their waveform.\n", "  A recent rejuvenation of experimental and theoretical interest in the physics\nof few- body systems has provided deep, fundamental insights into a broad range\nof problems. Few-body physics is a cross-cutting discipline not restricted to\nconventional subject ar- eas such as nuclear physics or atomic or molecular\nphysics. To a large degree, the recent explosion of interest in this subject\nhas been sparked by dramatic enhancements of experimental capabilities in\nultracold atomic systems over the past decade, which now permit atoms and\nmolecules to be explored deep in the quantum mechanical limit with controllable\ntwo-body interactions. This control, typically enabled by magnetic or\nelectromagnetically-dressed Fano-Feshbach resonances, allows in particular\naccess to the range of universal few-body physics, where two-body scattering\nlengths far exceed all other length scales in the problem. The Efimov effect,\nwhere 3 particles experienc- ing short-range interactions can\ncounterintuitively exhibit an infinite number of bound or quasi-bound energy\nlevels, is the most famous example of universality. Tremendous progress in the\nfield of universal Efimov physics has taken off, driven particularly by a\ncombination of experimental and theoretical studies in the past decade, and\nprior to the first observation in 2006, by an extensive set of theoretical\nstudies dating back to 1970. Because experimental observations of Efimov\nphysics have usually relied on resonances or interference phenomena in\nthree-body recombination, this connects naturally with the processes of\nmolecule formation in a low temperature gas of atoms or nucleons, and more\ngenerally with N-body recombination processes. Some other topics not closely\nrelated to the Efimov effect are also reviewed in this article, including ...\n", "  Topological crystalline insulators have been recently predicted and observed\nin rock-salt structure SnSe $\\{111\\}$ thin films. Previous studies have\nsuggested that the Se-terminated surface of this thin film with hydrogen\npassivation, has a reduced surface energy and is thus a preferred\nconfiguration. In this paper, synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, along with density functional theory calculations, are used to\ndemonstrate conclusively that a rock-salt SnSe $\\{111\\}$ thin film\nepitaxially-grown on \\ce{Bi2Se3} has a stable Sn-terminated surface. These\nobservations are supported by low energy electron diffraction (LEED)\nintensity-voltage measurements and dynamical LEED calculations, which further\nshow that the Sn-terminated SnSe $\\{111\\}$ thin film has undergone a surface\nstructural relaxation of the interlayer spacing between the Sn and Se atomic\nplanes. In sharp contrast to the Se-terminated counterpart, the observed Dirac\nsurface state in the Sn-terminated SnSe $\\{111\\}$ thin film is shown to yield a\nhigh Fermi velocity, $0.50\\times10^6$m/s, which suggests a potential mechanism\nof engineering the Dirac surface state of topological materials by tuning the\nsurface configuration.\n", "  To evaluate the variability of multi-phase flow properties of porous media at\nthe pore scale, it is necessary to acquire a number of representative samples\nof the void-solid structure. While modern x-ray computer tomography has made it\npossible to extract three-dimensional images of the pore space, assessment of\nthe variability in the inherent material properties is often experimentally not\nfeasible. We present a novel method to reconstruct the solid-void structure of\nporous media by applying a generative neural network that allows an implicit\ndescription of the probability distribution represented by three-dimensional\nimage datasets. We show, by using an adversarial learning approach for neural\nnetworks, that this method of unsupervised learning is able to generate\nrepresentative samples of porous media that honor their statistics. We\nsuccessfully compare measures of pore morphology, such as the Euler\ncharacteristic, two-point statistics and directional single-phase permeability\nof synthetic realizations with the calculated properties of a bead pack, Berea\nsandstone, and Ketton limestone. Results show that GANs can be used to\nreconstruct high-resolution three-dimensional images of porous media at\ndifferent scales that are representative of the morphology of the images used\nto train the neural network. The fully convolutional nature of the trained\nneural network allows the generation of large samples while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. Compared to classical stochastic methods of image\nreconstruction, the implicit representation of the learned data distribution\ncan be stored and reused to generate multiple realizations of the pore\nstructure very rapidly.\n", "  Quantum sensors with solid state electron spins have attracted considerable\ninterest due to their nanoscale spatial resolution.A critical requirement is to\nsuppress the environment noise of the solid state spin sensor.Here we\ndemonstrate a nanoscale thermometer based on silicon carbide (SiC) electron\nspins.We experimentally demonstrate that the performance of the spin sensor is\nrobust against dephasing due to a self protected machenism. The SiC thermometry\nmay provide a promising platform for sensing in a noisy environment ,e.g.\nbiological system sensing.\n", "  Direct measurements of the stellar magnetic fields are based on the splitting\nof spectral lines into polarized Zeeman components. With few exceptions, Zeeman\nsignatures are hidden in data noise and a number of methods have been developed\nto measure the average, over the visible stellar disk, of longitudinal\ncomponents of the magnetic field. As to faint stars, at present observable only\nwith low resolution spectropolarimetry, a method is based on the regression of\nthe Stokes V signal against the first derivative of Stokes I. Here we present\nan extension of this method to obtain a direct measurement of the transverse\ncomponent of stellar magnetic fields by the regression of high resolution\nStokes Q and U as a function of the second derivative of Stokes I. We also show\nthat it is possible to determine the orientation in the sky of the rotation\naxis of a star on the basis of the periodic variability of the transverse\ncomponent due to its rotation. The method is applied to data, obtained with the\nCatania Astrophysical Observatory Spectropolarimeter, along the rotational\nperiod of the well known magnetic star \\b{eta} CrB.\n", "  We construct a Fokker-Planck reaction model to investigate the dynamics of\nthe coupled epitaxial growth and shape transition process of an array of\nquantum dots. The Fokker-Planck reaction model is based on a coupled system of\nFokker-Planck equations wherein the distribution of each island type is\ngoverned by its own Fokker-Planck equation for growth, with reaction terms\ndescribing the shape transitions between islands of different types including\nasymmetric shapes. The reaction terms for the shape transitions depend on the\nisland size and are determined from explicit calculations of the lowest-barrier\npathway for each shape transition. This mean-field model enables us to consider\nthe kinetics of asymmetric shape transitions and study the evolution of island\nshape distributions during the coupled growth and transition process. Through\nnumerical simulations over a range of growth parameters, we find multimodal and\nunimodal evolution modes of the shape distribution of island arrays, which\ndepend on the external deposition flux rate and temperature rather than the\nshape transition rate. However, the shape transition rate governs the kinetics\nof shape transitions and determines the fraction of islands that form via\nasymmetric states, which has implications for the development of asymmetric\ncomposition profiles within alloy islands.\n", "  We present results from the EDGE survey, a spatially resolved CO(1-0)\nfollow-up to CALIFA, an optical Integral Field Unit (IFU) survey of local\ngalaxies. By combining the data products of EDGE and CALIFA, we study the\nvariation in molecular gas depletion time ($\\tau_{\\rm dep}$) on kiloparsec\nscales in 52 galaxies. We divide each galaxy into two parts: the center,\ndefined as the region within $0.1 \\ R_{25}$, and the disk, defined as the\nregion between $0.1$ and $0.7 \\ R_{25}$. We find that 14 galaxies show a\nshorter $\\tau_{\\rm dep}$ ($\\sim 1$ Gyr) in the center relative to that in the\ndisk ($\\tau_{\\rm dep} \\sim 2.4$ Gyrs), which means the central region in those\ngalaxies is more efficient at forming stars per unit molecular gas mass. This\nfinding implies that the centers with shorter $\\tau_{\\rm dep}$ resemble the\nintermediate regime between galactic disks and starburst galaxies. Furthermore,\nthe central drop in $\\tau_{\\rm dep}$ is correlated with a central increase in\nthe stellar surface density, suggesting that a shorter $\\tau_{\\rm dep}$ is\nassociated with molecular gas compression by the stellar gravitational\npotential. We argue that varying the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor only\nexaggerates the central drop of $\\tau_{\\rm dep}$.\n", "  We describe the recent updates to the ExoMol database regarding the molecular\nspectral line shapes. ExoMol provides comprehensive molecular line lists with a\nspecial emphasis on the applications involving characterization of atmospheres\nof exoplanets and cool stars. Among important requirements of such applications\nare (i) the broadening parameters for hydrogen and helium dominating\natmospheres and (ii) very broad ranges of temperature and pressures. The\ncurrent status of the available line shape data in the literature, demands from\nthe exoplanetary community and their specific needs are discussed.\n", "  It is known that the eye's scotopic photodetectors, rhodopsin molecules and\ntheir associated phototransduction mechanism leading to light perception, are\nefficient single photon counters. We here use the photon counting principles of\nhuman rod vision to propose a secure quantum biometric identification based on\nthe quantum-statistical properties of retinal photon detection. The photon path\nalong the human eye until its detection by rod cells is modeled as a filter\nhaving a specific transmission coefficient. Precisely determining its value\nfrom the photodetection statistics registered by the conscious observer is a\nquantum parameter estimation problem that leads to a quantum secure\nidentification method. The probabilities for false positive and false negative\nidentification of this biometric technique can readily approach $10^{-10}$ and\n$10^{-4}$, respectively. The security of the biometric method can be further\nquantified by the physics of quantum measurements. An impostor must be able to\nperform quantum thermometry and quantum magnetometry with energy resolution\nbetter than $10^{-9}\\hbar$, in order to foil the device by non-invasively\nmonitoring the biometric activity of a user.\n", "  Vector-boson scattering (VBS) processes provide particularly promising means\nfor probing the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and to search for\nnew physics in the weak sector. In the environment of a future proton-proton\ncollider operating at a center-of-mass energy of 100 TeV, unprecedented\nopportunities arise for the investigation of this important class of reactions.\nWe highlight the prominent features of VBS processes in this energy regime and\ndiscuss how the VBS signal can be isolated in the presence of a priori large\nQCD backgrounds. We find excellent opportunities for the analysis of VBS\nreactions in a kinematic range that is inaccessible to present colliders.\n", "  We study all translationally and rotationally invariant local theories\ninvolving massless spin 2 and spin 1 particles that mediate long range forces,\nallowing for general energy relations and violation of boost invariance.\nAlthough gauge invariance is not a priori required to describe non Lorentz\ninvariant theories, we first establish that locality requires `soft gauge\ninvariance'. Then by taking the soft graviton limit in scattering amplitudes,\nwe prove that in addition to the usual requirement of universal graviton\ncouplings, the special relativistic energy-momentum relation is also required\nand must be exact. We contrast this to the case of theories with only spin\n$\\leq1$ particles, where, although we can still derive charge conservation from\nlocality, special relativity can be easily violated. We provide indications\nthat the entire structure of relativity can be built up from spin 2 in this\nfashion.\n", "  The so-called jellyfish galaxies are objects exhibiting disturbed morphology,\nmostly in the form of tails of gas stripped from the main body of the galaxy.\nSeveral works have strongly suggested ram pressure stripping to be the\nmechanism driving this phenomenon. Here, we focus on one of these objects,\ndrawn from a sample of optically selected jellyfish galaxies, and use it to\nvalidate SINOPSIS, the spectral fitting code that will be used for the analysis\nof the GASP (GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE) survey, and study\nthe spatial distribution and physical properties of gas and stellar populations\nin this galaxy. We compare the model spectra to those obtained with GANDALF, a\ncode with similar features widely used to interpret the kinematic of stars and\ngas in galaxies from IFU data. We find that SINOPSIS can reproduce the\npixel-by-pixel spectra of this galaxy at least as good as GANDALF does,\nproviding reliable estimates of the underlying stellar absorption to properly\ncorrect the nebular gas emission. Using these results, we find strong evidences\nof a double effect of ram pressure exerted by the intracluster medium onto the\ngas of the galaxy. A moderate burst of star formation, dating between 20 and\n500 Myr ago and involving the outer parts of the galaxy more strongly than the\ninner regions, was likely induced by a first interaction of the galaxy with the\nintracluster medium. Stripping by ram pressure, plus probable gas depletion due\nto star formation, contributed to create a truncated ionized gas disk. The\npresence of an extended stellar tail on only one side of the disk, points\ninstead to another kind of process, likely a gravitational interaction by a\nfly-by or a close encounter with another galaxy in the cluster.\n", "  We develop a coarse-grained description of the point-vortex model, finding\nthat a large number of planar vortices and antivortices behave as an inviscid\nnon-Eulerian fluid at large scales. The emergent binary vortex fluid is subject\nto anomalous stresses absent from Euler's equation, caused by the singular\nnature of quantum vortices. The binary vortex fluid is compressible, and has an\nasymmetric Cauchy stress tensor allowing orbital angular momentum exchange with\nthe vorticity and vortex density. An analytic solution for vortex shear flow\ndriven by anomalous stresses is in excellent agreement with numerical\nsimulations of the point-vortex model.\n", "  We show that the inclusion of screened exchange via hybrid functionals\nprovides a unified description of the electronic and vibrational properties of\nTiSe2. In contrast to local approximations in density functional theory, the\nexplicit inclusion of exact, non-local exchange captures the effects of the\nelectron-electron interaction needed to both separate the Ti-d states from the\nSe-p states and stabilize the charge-density-wave (CDW) (or low-T) phase\nthrough the formation of a p-d hybridized state. We further show that this\nleads to an enhanced electron-phonon coupling that can drive the transition\neven if a small gap opens in the high-T phase. Finally, we demonstrate that the\nhybrid functionals can generate a CDW phase where the electronic bands, the\ngeometry, and the phonon frequencies are in agreement with experiments.\n", "  We present the first search for dark matter-induced delayed coincidence\nsignals in a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber, using the 224.6 live\ndays of the XENON100 science run II. This very distinct signature is predicted\nin the framework of magnetic inelastic dark matter which has been proposed to\nreconcile the modulation signal reported by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration with\nthe null results from other direct detection experiments. No candidate event\nhas been found in the region of interest and upper limits on the WIMP's\nmagnetic dipole moment are derived. The scenarios proposed to explain the\nDAMA/LIBRA modulation signal by magnetic inelastic dark matter interactions of\nWIMPs with masses of 58.0 GeV/c$^2$ and 122.7 GeV/c$^2$ are excluded at 3.3\n$\\sigma$ and 9.3 $\\sigma$, respectively.\n", "  We outline a holographic recipe to reconstruct $\\alpha'$ corrections to AdS\n(quantum) gravity from an underlying CFT in the strictly planar limit\n($N\\rightarrow\\infty$). Assuming that the boundary CFT can be solved in\nprinciple to all orders of the 't Hooft coupling $\\lambda$, for scalar primary\noperators, the $\\lambda^{-1}$ expansion of the conformal dimensions can be\nmapped to higher curvature corrections of the dual bulk scalar field action.\nFurthermore, for the metric pertubations in the bulk, the AdS/CFT\noperator-field isomorphism forces these corrections to be of the Lovelock type.\nWe demonstrate this by reconstructing the coefficient of the leading Lovelock\ncorrection, aka the Gauss-Bonnet term in a bulk AdS gravity action using the\nexpression of stress-tensor two-point function up to sub-leading order in\n$\\lambda^{-1}$.\n", "  Cosmological observations indicate that 85% of all matter in the Universe is\ndark matter (DM), yet its microscopic composition remains a mystery. One\nhypothesis is that DM arises from ultralight quantum fields that form\nmacroscopic objects such as topological defects. Here we use GPS as a ~ 50,000\nkm aperture DM detector to search for such defects in the form of domain walls.\nGPS navigation relies on precision timing signals furnished by atomic clocks\nhosted on board GPS satellites. As the Earth moves through the galactic DM\nhalo, interactions with topological defects could cause atomic clock glitches\nthat propagate through the GPS satellite constellation at galactic velocities ~\n300 km/s. Mining 16 years of archival GPS data, we find no evidence for DM in\nthe form of domain walls at our current sensitivity level. This allows us to\nimprove the limits on certain quadratic scalar couplings of domain wall DM to\nstandard model particles by several orders of magnitude.\n", "  We develop a reaction model for $\\eta$ photoproduction off the deuteron\n($\\gamma d\\to\\eta pn$), and study the reaction at a special kinematics, where\nthe photon beam energy is $\\sim 0.94$ GeV and the scattered proton is detected\nat $\\sim 0^\\circ$, for the purpose of determining the $\\eta$-nucleon scattering\nlength ($a_{\\eta N}$) and effective range ($r_{\\eta N}$). In this kinematics,\nthe $\\eta$-nucleon elastic rescattering is significantly enhanced while other\nbackground mechanisms being suppressed. We show that a ratio $R$, the $\\gamma\nd\\to\\eta pn$ cross section divided by the $\\gamma p\\to\\eta p$ cross section\nconvoluted with the proton momentum distribution in the deuteron, has a very\ngood resolving power of $a_{\\eta N}$ and $r_{\\eta N}$. We conclude that the $R$\ndata with 5% error, binned in 1 MeV width of the $\\eta$-neutron invariant mass,\ncan determine ${\\rm Re}[a_{\\eta N}]$ (${\\rm Re}[r_{\\eta N}]$) at the precision\nof $\\sim\\pm$0.1 fm ($\\sim\\pm$0.5 fm), significantly narrowing down the\npreviously estimated ranges of the parameters. To arrive at the conclusion, it\nis essential to use the $\\gamma d\\to\\eta pn$ reaction model equipped with\nelementary amplitudes that are well constrained by $\\pi N$ and $\\gamma N$\nreaction data through a sophisticated coupled-channels analysis. This result\nstrongly motivates the Research Center for Electron Photon Science (ELPH) at\nTohoku University to measure $R$.\n", "  We review aspects of twistor theory, its aims and achievements spanning\nthelast five decades. In the twistor approach, space--time is secondary with\nevents being derived objects that correspond to compact holomorphic curves in a\ncomplex three--fold -- the twistor space. After giving an elementary\nconstruction of this space we demonstrate how solutions to linear and nonlinear\nequations of mathematical physics: anti-self-duality (ASD) equations on\nYang--Mills, or conformal curvature can be encoded into twistor cohomology.\nThese twistor correspondences yield explicit examples of Yang--Mills, and\ngravitational instantons which we review. They also underlie the twistor\napproach to integrability: the solitonic systems arise as symmetry reductions\nof ASD Yang--Mills equations, and Einstein--Weyl dispersionless systems are\nreductions of ASD conformal equations.\n  We then review the holomorphic string theories in twistor and ambitwistor\nspaces, and explain how these theories give rise to remarkable new formulae for\nthe computation of quantum scattering amplitudes. Finally we discuss the\nNewtonian limit of twistor theory, and its possible role in Penrose's proposal\nfor a role of gravity in quantum collapse of a wave function.\n", "  We study the thermalization, injection, and acceleration of ions with\ndifferent mass/charge ratios, $A/Z$, in non-relativistic collisionless shocks\nvia hybrid (kinetic ions-fluid electrons) simulations. In general, ions\nthermalize to a post-shock temperature proportional to $A$. When diffusive\nshock acceleration is efficient, ions develop a non-thermal tail whose extent\nscales with $Z$ and whose normalization is enhanced as $(A/Z)^2$, so that\nincompletely-ionized heavy ions are preferentially accelerated. We discuss how\nthese findings can explain observed heavy-ion enhancements in Galactic cosmic\nrays.\n", "  Amyloid beta peptides (A\\b{eta}), implicated in Alzheimers disease (AD),\ninteract with the cellular membrane and induce amyloid toxicity. The\ncomposition of cellular membranes changes in aging and AD. We designed multi\ncomponent lipid models to mimic healthy and diseased states of the neuronal\nmembrane. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), Kelvin probe force microscopy\n(KPFM) and black lipid membrane (BLM) techniques, we demonstrated that these\nmodel membranes differ in their nanoscale structure and physical properties,\nand interact differently with A\\b{eta}. Based on our data, we propose a new\nhypothesis that changes in lipid membrane due to aging and AD may trigger\namyloid toxicity through electrostatic mechanisms, similar to the accepted\nmechanism of antimicrobial peptide action. Understanding the role of the\nmembrane changes as a key activating amyloid toxicity may aid in the\ndevelopment of a new avenue for the prevention and treatment of AD.\n", "  We explore Random Scale-Free networks of populations, modelled by chaotic\nRicker maps, connected by transport that is triggered when population density\nin a patch is in excess of a critical threshold level. Our central result is\nthat threshold-activated dispersal leads to stable fixed populations, for a\nwide range of threshold levels. Further, suppression of chaos is facilitated\nwhen the threshold-activated migration is more rapid than the intrinsic\npopulation dynamics of a patch. Additionally, networks with large number of\nnodes open to the environment, readily yield stable steady states. Lastly we\ndemonstrate that in networks with very few open nodes, the degree and\nbetweeness centrality of the node open to the environment has a pronounced\ninfluence on control. All qualitative trends are corroborated by quantitative\nmeasures, reflecting the efficiency of control, and the width of the steady\nstate window.\n", "  A recent paper compares density functional theory results for atomization\nenergies and dipole moments using a multi-wavelet based method with traditional\nGaussian basis set results, and concludes that Gaussian basis sets are\nproblematic for achieving high accuracy. We show that by a proper choice of\nGaussian basis sets they are capable of achieving essentially the same accuracy\nas the multi-wavelet approach, and identify a couple of possible problems in\nthe multi-wavelet calculations.\n", "  Hybrid density functional calculations are performed for a variety of systems\ncontaining d9 ions (Cu2+, Ag2+), and exhibiting quasi-one-dimensional magnetic\nproperties. In particular we study fluorides containing these ions in a rarely\nencountered compressed octahedral coordination which forces the unpaired\nelectron in the d(z2) orbital. We predict that such systems should exhibit\nmagnetic anisotropies surpassing that of Sr2CuO3 - one of the best realizations\nof an one-dimensional system known to date. In particular we predict that the\ninter-chain coupling in the Ag2+ containing [AgF][BF4] should be nearly five\norders of magnitude smaller than the intra-chain interaction. Our results\nindicate that quasi-one-dimensional spin-1/2 systems containing chains with\nspin sites in a d(z2)1 local ground state could constitute a versatile model\nfor testing modern theories of quantum many-body physics in the solid state.\n", "  Gaussian pentachoron weights can be used for constructing algebraic\nrealizations of four-dimensional Pachner moves. Here, we consider a natural\n`gauge equivalence' for such weights with one and two bosonic - i.e., commuting\n- variables on 3-faces. For the one-boson case, all generic weights turn out to\nbe gauge equivalent. For the two-boson case, and generic weights, their gauge\nequivalence classes are parameterized by multiplicative 2-cocycles. Moreover, a\ngeneric two-boson weight can be reduced by a gauge transformation to a\ndelta-function form.\n", "  We identify a fundamental obstruction to any theory of the beginning of the\nuniverse, formulated as a semiclassical path integral. Hartle and Hawking's no\nboundary proposal and Vilenkin's tunneling proposal are examples of such\ntheories. Each may be formulated as the quantum amplitude for obtaining a final\n3-geometry by integrating over 4-geometries. We introduce a new mathematical\ntool - Picard-Lefschetz theory - for defining the semiclassical path integral\nfor gravity. The Lorentzian path integral for quantum cosmology with a positive\ncosmological constant is meaningful in this approach, but the Euclidean version\nis not. Framed in this way, the resulting framework and predictions are unique.\nUnfortunately, the outcome is that primordial tensor (gravitational wave)\nfluctuations are unsuppressed. We prove a general theorem to this effect, in a\nwide class of theories.\n", "  We investigate the conditions of ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence\nresponsible for the relative orientation between density structures,\ncharacterized by their gradient, $\\vec{\\nabla}\\rho$, and the magnetic field,\n$\\vec{B}$, in molecular clouds (MCs). For that purpose, we construct an\nexpression for the time evolution of the angle, $\\phi$, between\n$\\vec{\\nabla}\\rho$ and $\\vec{B}$ based on the transport equations of MHD\nturbulence. Using this expression, we find that the configuration where\n$\\vec{\\nabla}\\rho$ and $\\vec{B}$ are mostly parallel, $\\cos\\phi=1$, and where\n$\\vec{\\nabla}\\rho$ and $\\vec{B}$ are mostly perpendicular, $\\cos\\phi=0$,\nconstitute attractors, that is, the system tends to evolve towards either of\nthese configurations and they are more represented than others. This fact would\nexplain the predominant alignment or anti-alignment between column density,\n$N_H$, structures and the projected magnetic field orientation,\n$\\hat{B}_\\perp$, reported in observations. Additionally, we find that\ndepartures from the $\\cos\\phi=0$ configurations are related to convergent\nflows, quantified by the divergence of the velocity field,\n$\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{v}$, in the presence of a relatively strong magnetic\nfield. This would explain the observed change in relative orientation between\n$N_H$-structures and $\\hat{B}_\\perp$ towards MCs, from mostly parallel at low\n$N_H$ to mostly perpendicular at the highest $N_H$, as the result of the\ngravitational collapse and/or convergence of flows. Finally, we show that the\ndensity threshold that marks the observed change in relative orientation\ntowards MCs, from $N_H$ and $\\hat{B}_\\perp$ being mostly parallel at low $N_H$\nto mostly perpendicular at the highest $N_H$, is related to the magnetic field\nstrength and constitutes a crucial piece of information for determining the\nrole of the magnetic field in the dynamics of MCs.\n", "  A framework to include triple collinear splitting functions into parton\nshowers is presented, and the implementation of flavor-changing NLO splitting\nkernels is discussed as a first application. The correspondence between the\nMonte-Carlo integration and the analytic computation of NLO DGLAP evolution\nkernels is made explicit for both timelike and spacelike parton evolution.\nNumerical simulation results are obtained with two independent implementations\nof the new algorithm, using the two independent event generation frameworks\nPythia and Sherpa.\n", "  We set a new upper limit on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBH)\nbased on existing X-ray data. PBH interactions with interstellar medium should\nresult in significant fluxes of X-ray photons, which would contribute to the\nobserved number density of compact X-ray objects in galaxies. The data\nconstrain PBH number density in the mass range from a few $M_\\odot$ to $2\\times\n10^7 M_\\odot$. PBH density needed to account for the origin of black holes\ndetected by LIGO is marginally allowed.\n", "  Within a plane-wave approximation in scattering, an incoming wave packet's\nWigner function stays everywhere positive, which obscures such purely quantum\nphenomena as non-locality and entanglement. With the advent of the electron\nmicroscopes with subnanometer-sized beams one can enter a genuinely quantum\nregime where the latter effects become only moderately attenuated. Here we show\nhow to probe negative values of the Wigner function in scattering of a coherent\nsuperposition of two Gaussian packets with a non-vanishing impact-parameter\nbetween them (a Schr\\\"odinger's cat state) by atomic targets. For hydrogen in\nthe ground $1s$ state, a small parameter of the problem, a ratio\n$a/\\sigma_{\\perp}$ of the Bohr radius $a$ to the beam width $\\sigma_{\\perp}$,\nis no longer vanishing. We predict an azimuthal asymmetry of the scattered\nelectrons, which is found to be up to $10 \\%$ and argue that it can be reliably\ndetected. Production of beams with the not-everywhere positive Wigner functions\nand probing such quantum effects can open new perspectives for non-invasive\nelectron microscopy, quantum tomography, particle physics, etc.\n", "  We present a parton shower which implements the DGLAP evolution of parton\ndensities and fragmentation functions at next-to-leading order precision up to\neffects stemming from local four-momentum conservation. The Monte-Carlo\nsimulation is based on including next-to-leading order collinear splitting\nfunctions in an existing parton shower and combining their soft enhanced\ncontributions with the corresponding terms at leading order. Soft double\ncounting is avoided by matching to the soft eikonal. Example results from two\nindependent realizations of the algorithm, implemented in the two event\ngeneration frameworks Pythia and Sherpa, illustrate the improved precision of\nthe new formalism.\n", "  High-luminosity modern accelerators, like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider\n(RHIC) at BNL and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, inherently have event\npile-up scenarios which significantly contribute to physics events as a\nbackground. While state-of-the-art tracking algorithms and detector concepts\ntake care of these event pile-up scenarios, several offline analytical\ntechniques are used to remove such events from the physics analysis. It is\nstill difficult to identify the remaining pile-up events in an event sample for\nphysics analysis. Since the fraction of these events is significantly small, it\nmay not be as serious of an issue for other analysis as it would be for an\nevent-by-event analysis. Particularly, when the characteristics of the\nmultiplicity distribution are observable, one needs to be very careful. In the\npresent work, we demonstrate how a small fraction of residual pile-up events\ncan change the moments and their ratios of an event-by-event net-proton\nmultiplicity distribution, which are sensitive to the dynamical fluctuations\ndue to the QCD critical point. For this study we assume that the individual\nevent-by-event proton and antiproton multiplicity distributions follow Poisson,\nnegative binomial or binomial distributions. We observe a significant effect in\ncumulants and their ratios of net-proton multiplicity distributions due to\npile-up events, particularly at lower energies. It might be crucial to estimate\nthe fraction of pile-up events in the data sample while interpreting the\nexperimental observable for the critical point.\n", "  A simple framework for Dirac spinors is developed that parametrizes\nadmissible quantum dynamics and also analytically constructs electromagnetic\nfields, obeying Maxwell's equations, which yield a desired evolution. In\nparticular, we show how to achieve dispersionless rotation and translation of\nwave packets. Additionally, this formalism can handle control interactions\nbeyond electromagnetic. This work reveals unexpected flexibility of the Dirac\nequation for control applications, which may open new prospects for quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "  The contact formalism, a useful tool for analyzing short-range correlations,\nis generalized here for systems with coupled channels, such as in nuclear\nphysics. The relevant asymptotic form is presented and contact matrices are\ndefined. Generally, for the case of two coupled channels, two two-body\nfunctions are included in the asymptotic form, resulting a 2 x 2 contact\nmatrix. Nevertheless, it is shown that if the coupling terms of the potential\nare very weak or very strong, only a single two-body function is needed,\nresulting a single contact. This universal result is directly relevant to\nnuclear systems, and provides a theoretical explanation for the fact that\nproton-neutron short-range correlations can be described using the single\nbound-state deuteron wave function. It is achieved by applying an appropriate\nboundary condition on the two-body functions. This boundary condition can be\ninterpreted as a mean field potential imposed on the correlated pair due to the\nresidual system.\n", "  Using target space null reduction of the Polyakov action we find a novel\ncovariant action for strings moving in a torsional Newton-Cartan geometry.\nSending the string tension to zero while rescaling the Newton-Cartan clock\n1-form, so as to keep the string action finite, we obtain a non-relativistic\nstring moving in a new type of non-Lorentzian geometry that we call\n$U(1)$-Galilean geometry. We apply this to strings on $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ for\nwhich we show that the zero tension limit is realized by the Spin Matrix theory\nlimits of the AdS/CFT correspondence. This is closely related to limits of spin\nchains studied in connection to integrability in AdS/CFT. The simplest example\ngives a covariant version of the Landau-Lifshitz sigma-model.\n", "  Direct mass measurements of the low-spin $3/2^{(-)}$ and high-spin\n$13/2^{(+)}$ states in the neutron-deficient isotopes $^{195}$Po, $^{197}$Po,\nand high-spin $13/2^{(+)}$ state in $^{199}$Po were performed with the\nPenning-trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP at ISOLDE-CERN. These measurements\nallow the determination of the excitation energy of the isomeric state arising\nfrom the $\\nu$i$_{13/2}$ orbital in $^{195,197}$Po. Additionally, the\nexcitation energy of isomeric states of lead, radon, and radium isotopes in\nthis region were obtained from $\\alpha$-decay chains. The new excitation\nenergies complete the knowledge of the energy systematics in the region and\nconfirm for the first time that the $13/2^{(+)}$ states remain isomeric,\nindependent of the number of valence neutrons.\n", "  Frustration and the associated phenomenon of \"avoided criticality\" have been\nproposed as an explanation for the dramatic relaxation slowdown in\nglass-forming liquids. To test this, we have undertaken a Monte-Carlo study of\npossibly the simplest such problem, the 2-dimensional XY model with frustration\ncorresponding to a small flux, $f$, per plaquette. At $f=0$, there is a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T^*$, but at any small but\nnon-zero $f$, this transition is avoided, and replaced (presumably) by a\nvortex-ordering transition at much lower temperatures. We thus have studied the\nevolution of the dynamics for small and moderate $f$ as the system is cooled\nfrom above $T^*$ to below. While we do find strongly temperature dependent\nslowing of the dynamics as $T$ crosses $T^*$, and that simultaneously the\ndynamics becomes more complex, neither effect is anywhere nearly as dramatic as\nthe corresponding phenomena in glass-forming liquids. At the very least, this\nimplies that the properties of supercooled liquids must depend on more than\nfrustration and the existence of an avoided transition.\n", "  We report results of simultaneous x-ray reflectivity and grazing incidence\nx-ray fluorescence measurements in combination with x-ray standing wave\nassisted depth resolved near edge x-ray absorption measurements to reveal new\ninsights on chemical speciation of W in a W-B4C superlattice structure.\nInterestingly, our results show existence of various unusual electronic states\nfor the W atoms especially those sitting at the surface and interface boundary\nof a thin film medium as compared to that of the bulk. These observations are\nfound to be consistent with the results obtained using first principles\ncalculations. Unlike the conventional x-ray absorption measurements the present\napproach has an advantage that it permits the determination of depth resolved\nchemical nature of an element in the thin layered materials at atomic length\nscale resolutions.\n", "  We present the results of precision mass measurements of neutron-rich cadmium\nisotopes. These nuclei approach the $N=82$ closed neutron shell and are\nimportant to nuclear structure as they lie near doubly-magic $^{132}$Sn on the\nchart of nuclides. Of particular note is the clear identification of the ground\nstate mass in $^{127}$Cd along with the isomeric state. We show that the ground\nstate identified in a previous mass measurement which dominates the mass value\nin the Atomic Mass Evaluation is an isomeric state. In addition to\n$^{127/m}$Cd, we present other cadmium masses measured ($^{125/m}$Cd and\n$^{126}$Cd) in a recent TITAN experiment at TRIUMF. Finally, we compare our\nmeasurements to new \\emph{ab initio} shell-model calculations and comment on\nthe state of the field in the $N=82$ region.\n", "  We demonstrate a simple cascade mechanism that drives the formation and\nemergence of rogue waves in the generalized non-linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\nwith third-order dispersion. This conceptually novel generation mechanism is\nbased on inelastic collisions of quasi-solitons and is well described by a\nresonant-like scattering behaviour for the energy transfer in pair-wise\nquasi-soliton collisions. Our results demonstrate a threshold for rogue wave\nemergence and the existence of a period of reduced amplitudes - a \"calm before\nthe storm\" - preceding the arrival of a rogue wave event. Comparing with\nultra-long time window simulations of $3.865\\times 10^{6}$ps we observe the\nstatistics of rogue waves in optical fibres with an unprecedented level of\ndetail and accuracy, unambiguously establishing the long-ranged character of\nthe rogue wave power-distribution function over seven orders of magnitude.\n", "  We propose and analyze a solid-state platform based on surface acoustic waves\n(SAWs) for trapping, cooling and controlling (charged) particles, as well as\nthe simulation of quantum many-body systems. We develop a general theoretical\nframework demonstrating the emergence of effective time-independent acoustic\ntrapping potentials for particles in two- or one-dimensional structures. As our\nmain example we discuss in detail the generation and applications of a\nstationary, but movable acoustic pseudo-lattice (AL) with lattice parameters\nthat are reconfigurable in situ. We identify the relevant figures of merit,\ndiscuss potential experimental platforms for a faithful implementation of such\nan acoustic lattice, and provide estimates for typical system parameters. With\na projected lattice spacing on the scale of 100nm, this approach allows for\nrelatively large energy scales in the realization of fermionic Hubbard models,\nwith the ultimate prospect of entering the low temperature, strong interaction\nregime. Experimental imperfections as well as read-out schemes are discussed.\n", "  As is well known, there exist some Lorentz breaking scenarios which explain\nthe smallness of the cosmological constant in the present era. An important\naspect to analyze is the propagation of gravitational waves and the screening\nor enhancement of the Newton constant $G_N$ in these models. The problem is\nthat the Lorentz symmetry breaking terms may induce an unacceptable value of\nthe Newton constant $G_N$ or introduce longitudinal modes in the gravitational\nwaves. Furthermore there may spoil the standard dispersion relation\n$\\omega=ck$. In [21] the authors have presented a model for which they suggest\nthat the behavior of the gravitational constant is the correct one for\nasymptotic times. In the present work, an explicit checking is made and we\nfinally agree with these claims. Furthermore, it is suggested that the\ngravitational waves are also well behaved for large times. In the process, some\nnew models with the same behavior are obtained, thus enlarging the list of\npossible adjustment mechanisms.\n", "  Stellar feedback from high-mass stars (e.g., H{\\sc ii} regions) can strongly\ninfluence the surrounding interstellar medium and regulate star formation. Our\nnew ALMA observations reveal sequential high-mass star formation taking place\nwithin one sub-virial filamentary clump (the G9.62 clump) in the G9.62+0.19\ncomplex. The 12 dense cores (MM 1-12) detected by ALMA are at very different\nevolutionary stages, from starless core phase to UC H{\\sc ii} region phase.\nThree dense cores (MM6, MM7/G, MM8/F) are associated with outflows. The\nmass-velocity diagrams of outflows associated with MM7/G and MM8/F can be well\nfitted with broken power laws. The mass-velocity diagram of SiO outflow\nassociated with MM8/F breaks much earlier than other outflow tracers (e.g., CO,\nSO, CS, HCN), suggesting that SiO traces newly shocked gas, while the other\nmolecular lines (e.g., CO, SO, CS, HCN) mainly trace the ambient gas\ncontinuously entrained by outflow jets. Five cores (MM1, MM3, MM5, MM9, MM10)\nare massive starless core candidates whose masses are estimated to be larger\nthan 25 M$_{\\sun}$, assuming a dust temperature of $\\leq$ 20 K. The shocks from\nthe expanding H{\\sc ii} regions (\"B\" \\& \"C\") to the west may have great impact\non the G9.62 clump through compressing it into a filament and inducing core\ncollapse successively, leading to sequential star formation. Our findings\nsuggest that stellar feedback from H{\\sc ii} regions may enhance the star\nformation efficiency and suppress the low-mass star formation in adjacent\npre-existing massive clumps.\n", "  We consider a conformal field theory in two dimensions in which an external\nperturbation is placed. We study the energy flux and entanglement entropy for\none, two and multiple intervals and give a suggestion relating the two in some\ncases. We show that both the energy flux and the entanglement entropy exhibit a\nlight-cone singularity which strongly depends on the regularization we choose.\n", "  We consider inflation in the system containing a Ricci scalar squared term\nand a canonical scalar field with quadratic mass term. In the Einstein frame\nthis model takes the form of a two-field inflation model with a curved field\nspace, and under the slow-roll approximation contains four free parameters\ncorresponding to the masses of the two fields and their initial positions. We\ninvestigate how the inflationary dynamics and predictions for the primordial\ncurvature perturbation depend on these four parameters. Our analysis is based\non the $\\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to determine predictions for the\nnon-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbation as well as for quantities\nrelating to its power spectrum. Depending on the choice of parameters, we find\npredictions that range from those of $R^2$ inflation to those of quadratic\nchaotic inflation, with the non-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbation\nalways remaining small. Using our results we are able to put constraints on the\nmasses of the two fields.\n", "  We report a study of the decay $D^0 \\to K^0_S K^0_S$ using 921~fb$^{-1}$ of\ndata collected at or near the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\\Upsilon(5S)$ resonances with\nthe Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy $e^+e^-$ collider. The\nmeasured time-integrated $CP$ asymmetry is $ A_{CP}(D^0 \\to K^0_S K^0_S) =\n(-0.02 \\pm 1.53 \\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.17) \\%$, and the branching fraction is\n$\\mathcal{B} (D^{0}\\rightarrow K_{S}^{0}K_{S}^{0})$ = (1.321 $\\pm$ 0.023 $\\pm$\n0.036 $\\pm$ 0.044) $\\times$ 10$^{-4}$, where the first uncertainty is\nstatistical, the second is systematic, and the third is due to the\nnormalization mode ($D^0 \\to K_S^0 \\pi^0$). These results are significantly\nmore precise than previous measurements available for this mode. The $A_{CP}$\nmeasurement is consistent with the standard model expectation.\n", "  We have investigated anomalous Hall effect and magnetoresistance in a\nnoncentrosymmetric itinerant magnet Cr$_{11}$Ge$_{19}$. While the temperature-\nand magnetic-field-dependent anomalous Hall conductivity is just proportional\nto the magnetization above 30 K, it is more enhanced in the lower temperature\nregion. The magnitude of negative magnetoresistance begins to increase toward\nlow temperature around 30 K. The anisotropic magnetoresistance emerges at\nsimilar temperature. Because there is no anomaly in the temperature dependence\nof magnetization around 30 K, the origin of these observations in transport\nproperties is ascribed to some electronic structure with the energy scale of 30\nK. We speculate this is caused by the spin splitting due to breaking of spatial\ninversion symmetry.\n", "  We study the odd integer filled Mott phases of a spin-1 Bose-Hubbard chain\nand determine their fate in the presence of a Raman induced spin-orbit coupling\nwhich has been achieved in ultracold atomic gases; this system is described by\na quantum spin-1 chain with a spiral magnetic field. The spiral magnetic field\ninitially induces helical order with either ferromagnetic or dimer order\nparameters, giving rise to a spiral paramagnet at large field. The spiral\nferromagnet-to-paramagnet phase transition is in a novel universality class,\nwith critical exponents associated with the divergence of the correlation\nlength $\\nu \\approx 2/3$ and the order parameter susceptibility $\\gamma \\approx\n1/2$. We solve the effective spin model exactly using the density matrix\nrenormalization group, and compare with both a large-$S$ classical solution and\na phenomenological Landau theory. We discuss how these exotic bosonic magnetic\nphases can be produced and probed in ultracold atomic experiments in optical\nlattices.\n", "  The Chern--Simons term is used in the geometric theory of defects. The\nequilibrium equations with $\\delta$-function source are explicitly solved with\nrespect to the $SO(3)$ connection. This solution describes one straight linear\ndisclination and corresponds to the new kind of geometrical defect: it is the\ndefect in the connection but not the metric which is the flat Euclidean metric.\nThis is the first example of a disclination described within the geometric\ntheory of defects. The corresponding angular rotation field is computed.\n", "  Hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites are low-cost solution-processable\nsolar cell materials with photovoltaic properties that rival those of\ncrystalline silicon. The perovskite films are typically sandwiched between thin\nlayers of hole and electron transport materials, which efficiently extract\nphotogenerated charges. This affords high-energy conversion efficiencies but\nresults in significant performance and fabrication challenges. Herein we\npresent a simple charge transport layer-free perovskite solar cell (PSC),\ncomprising only a perovskite layer with two interdigitated gold back-contacts.\nCharge extraction is achieved via self-assembled molecular monolayers (SAMs)\nand their associated dipole fields at the metal/perovskite interface.\nPhotovoltages of approximately 600 mV generated by SAM-modified PSCs are\nequivalent to the built-in potential generated by individual dipole layers.\nEfficient charge extraction results in photocurrents of up to 12.1 mA/cm2 under\nsimulated sunlight, despite a large electrode spacing.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations of crystal nuclei coexisting with the fluid phase in\nthermal equilibrium in finite volumes are presented and analyzed, for fluid\ndensities from dense melts to the vapor. Generalizing the lever-rule for\ntwo-phase coexistence in the canonical ensemble to finite volume,\n\"measurements\" of the nucleus volume together with the pressure and chemical\npotential of the surrounding fluid allows to extract the surface free energy of\nthe nucleus. Neither the knowledge of the (in general non-spherical) nucleus\nshape nor of the angle-dependent interface tension is required for this task.\nThe feasibility of the approach is demonstrated for a variant of the\nAsakura-Oosawa model for colloid-polymer mixtures, which form face-centered\ncubic colloidal crystals. For a polymer to colloid size ratio of $0.15$, the\ncolloid packing fraction in the fluid phase can be varied from melt values to\nzero by the variation of an effective attractive potential between the\ncolloids. It is found that the approximation of spherical crystal nuclei often\nunderestimates actual nucleation barriers significantly. Nucleation barriers\nare found to scale as $\\Delta F^*=(4\\pi/3)^{1/3}\\bar{\\gamma}(V^*)^{2/3}+const.$\nwith the nucleus volume $V^*$, and the effective surface tension $\\bar{\\gamma}$\nthat accounts implicitly for the nonspherical shape can be precisely estimated.\n", "  We study the Haldane model under strain using a tight-binding approach, and\ncompare the obtained results with the continuum-limit approximation. As in\ngraphene, nonuniform strain leads to a time-reversal preserving pseudo-magnetic\nfield that induces (pseudo) Landau levels. Unlike a real magnetic field, strain\nlifts the degeneracy of the zeroth pseudo Landau levels at different valleys.\nMoreover, for the zigzag edge under uniaxial strain, strain removes the\ndegeneracy within the pseudo-Landau levels by inducing a tilt in their energy\ndispersion. The latter arises from next-to-leading order corrections to the\ncontinuum-limit Hamiltonian, which are absent for a real magnetic field. We\nshow that, for the lowest pseudo-Landau levels in the Haldane model, the\ndominant contribution to the tilt is different from graphene. In addition,\nalthough strain does not strongly modify the dispersion of the edge states,\ntheir interplay with the pseudo-Landau levels is different for the armchair and\nzigzag ribbons. Finally, we study the effect of strain in the band structure of\nthe Haldane model at the critical point of the topological transition, thus\nshedding light on the interplay between non-trivial topology and strain in\nquantum anomalous Hall systems.\n", "  Extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR), observed in transition metal\ndichalcogendies, WTe$_2$, has attracted recently a great deal of research\ninterests as it shows no sign of saturation up to the magnetic field as high as\n60 T, in addition to the presence of type-II Weyl fermions. Currently, there\nhas been a lot of discussion on the role of band structure changes on the\ntemperature dependent XMR in this compound. In this contribution, we study the\nband structure of WTe$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) and first-principle calculations to demonstrate that the temperature\ndependent band structure has no substantial effect on the temperature dependent\nXMR as our measurements do not show band structure changes on increasing the\nsample temperature between 20 and 130 K. We further observe an electronlike\nsurface state, dispersing in such a way that it connects the top of bulk\nholelike band to the bottom of bulk electronlike band. Interestingly, similar\nto bulk states, the surface state is also mostly intact with the sample\ntemperature. Our results provide invaluable information in shaping the\nmechanism of temperature dependent XMR in WTe$_2$.\n", "  Studying the effects of dark energy and modified gravity on cosmological\nscales has led to a great number of physical models being developed. The\neffective field theory (EFT) of cosmic acceleration allows an efficient\nexploration of this large model space, usually carried out on a\nphenomenological basis. However, constraints on such parametrized EFT\ncoefficients cannot be trivially connected to fundamental covariant theories.\nIn this paper we reconstruct the class of covariant Horndeski scalar-tensor\ntheories that reproduce the same background dynamics and linear perturbations\nas a given EFT action. One can use this reconstruction to interpret constraints\non parametrized EFT coefficients in terms of viable covariant Horndeski\ntheories. We demonstrate this method with a number of well-known models and\ndiscuss a range of future applications.\n", "  In condensed matter physics, the term \"chiral anomaly\" implies the violation\nof the separate number conservation laws of Weyl fermions of different\nchiralities in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields. One\neffect of chiral anomaly in the recently discovered Dirac and Weyl semimetals\nis a positive longitudinal magnetoconductance (LMC). Here we show that chiral\nanomaly and non-trivial Berry curvature effects engender another striking\neffect in WSMs, the planar Hall effect (PHE). Remarkably, PHE manifests itself\nwhen the applied current, magnetic field, and the induced transverse \"Hall\"\nvoltage all lie in the same plane, precisely in a configuration in which the\nconventional Hall effect vanishes. In this work we treat PHE quasi-classically,\nand predict specific experimental signatures for type-I and type-II Weyl\nsemimetals that can be directly checked in experiments.\n", "  We present a family of exact black-hole solutions on a static spherically\nsymmetric background in second-order generalized Proca theories with derivative\nvector-field interactions coupled to gravity. We also derive non-exact\nsolutions in power-law coupling models including vector Galileons and\nnumerically show the existence of regular black holes with a primary hair\nassociated with the longitudinal propagation. The intrinsic vector-field\nderivative interactions generally give rise to a secondary hair induced by\nnon-trivial field profiles. The deviation from General Relativity is most\nsignificant around the horizon and hence there is a golden opportunity for\nprobing the Proca hair by the measurements of gravitational waves (GWs) in the\nregime of strong gravity.\n", "  We provide a fundamental insight into the microscopic mechanisms of the\nageing processes. Using large scale molecular dynamics simulations of the\nprototypical ferroelectric material PbTiO3, we demonstrate that the\nexperimentally observed ageing phenomena can be reproduced from intrinsic\ninteractions of defect-dipoles related to dopant-vacancy associates, even in\nthe absence of extrinsic effects. We show that variation of the dopant\nconcentration modifies the material's hysteretic response. We identify a\nuniversal method to reduce loss and tune the electromechanical properties of\ninexpensive ceramics for efficient technologies.\n", "  Quantifying quantum mechanical uncertainty is vital for the increasing number\nof experiments that reach the uncertainty limited regime. We present a method\nfor computing tight variance uncertainty relations, i.e., the optimal\nstate-independent lower bound for the sum of the variances for any set of two\nor more measurements. The bounds come with a guaranteed error estimate, so\nresults of pre-assigned accuracy can be obtained straightforwardly. Our method\nalso works for POVM measurements. Therefore, it can be used for detecting\nentanglement in noisy environments, even in cases where conventional spin\nsqueezing criteria fail because of detector noise.\n", "  We implement the KORAL code to perform two sets of very long general\nrelativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of an axisymmetric\noptically thin magnetized flow around a non-rotating black hole: one with a new\nterm in the electromagnetic field tensor due to the radiation pressure felt by\nthe plasma electrons on the comoving frame of the electron-proton plasma, and\none without. The source of the radiation is the accretion flow itself. Without\nthe new term, the system evolves to a standard accretion flow due to the\ndevelopment of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). With the new term,\nhowever, the system eventually evolves to a magnetically arrested state (MAD)\nin which a large scale jet-like magnetic field threads the black hole horizon.\nOur results confirm the secular action of the Cosmic Battery in accretion flows\naround astrophysical black holes.\n", "  The success of a given inflationary model crucially depends upon two\nfeatures: its predictions for observables such as those of the Cosmic Microwave\nbackground (CMB) and its insensitivity to the unknown ultraviolet (UV) physics\nsuch as quantum gravitational effects. Extranatural inflation is a well\nmotivated scenario which is insensitive to UV physics by construction. In this\nfive dimensional model, the fifth dimension is compactified on a circle and the\nzero mode of the fifth component of a bulk $U(1)$ gauge field acts as the\ninflaton. In this work, we study simple variations of the minimal extranatural\ninflation model in order to improve its CMB predictions while retaining its\nnumerous merits. We find that it is possible to obtain CMB predictions\nidentical to those of e.g. ${\\cal R} + {\\cal R}^2$ Starobinsky model of\ninflation and show that this can be done in the most minimal way by having two\nadditional extra light fermionic species in the bulk, with the same $U(1)$\ncharges. We then find the constraints that CMB observations impose on the\nparameters of the model.\n", "  In the recent studies of the unconventional physics in cuprate\nsuperconductors, one of the central issues is the interplay between charge\norder and superconductivity. Here the mechanism of the charge-order formation\nin the electron-doped cuprate superconductors is investigated based on the t-J\nmodel. The experimentally observed momentum dependence of the electron\nquasiparticle scattering rate is qualitatively reproduced, where the scattering\nrate is highly anisotropic in momentum space, and is intriguingly related to\nthe charge-order gap. Although the scattering strength appears to be weakest at\nthe hot spots, the scattering in the antinodal region is stronger than that in\nthe nodal region, which leads to the original electron Fermi surface is broken\nup into the Fermi pockets and their coexistence with the Fermi arcs located\naround the nodal region. In particular, this electron Fermi surface instability\ndrives the charge-order correlation, with the charge-order wave vector that\nmatches well with the wave vector connecting the hot spots, as the charge-order\ncorrelation in the hole-doped counterparts. However, in a striking contrast to\nthe hole-doped case, the charge-order wave vector in the electron-doped side\nincreases in magnitude with the electron doping. The theory also shows the\nexistence of a quantitative link between the single-electron fermiology and the\ncollective response of the electron density.\n", "  Ground-based telescopes equipped with state-of-the-art spectrographs are able\nto obtain high-resolution transmission and emission spectra of exoplanets that\nprobe the structure and composition of their atmospheres. Various atomic and\nmolecular species, such as Na, CO, H2O have been already detected. Molecular\nspecies have been observed only in the near-infrared while atomic species have\nbeen observed in the visible. In particular, the detection and abundance\ndetermination of water vapor bring important constraints to the planet\nformation process. We search for water vapor in the atmosphere of the exoplanet\nHD189733b using a high-resolution transmission spectrum in the visible obtained\nwith HARPS. We use Molecfit to correct for telluric absorption features. Then\nwe compute the high-resolution transmission spectrum of the planet using 3\ntransit datasets. We finally search for water vapor absorption using a\ncross-correlation technique that combines the signal of 800 individual lines.\nTelluric features are corrected to the noise level. We place a 5-sigma upper\nlimit of 100 ppm on the strength of the 6500 A water vapor band. The 1-sigma\nprecision of 20 ppm on the transmission spectrum demonstrates that space-like\nsensitivity can be achieved from the ground. This approach opens new\nperspectives to detect various atomic and molecular species with future\ninstruments such as ESPRESSO at the VLT. Extrapolating from our results, we\nshow that only 1 transit with ESPRESSO would be sufficient to detect water\nvapor on HD189733b-like hot Jupiter with a cloud-free atmosphere. Upcoming\nnear-IR spectrographs will be even more efficient and sensitive to a wider\nrange of molecular species. Moreover, the detection of the same molecular\nspecies in different bands (e.g. visible and IR) is key to constrain the\nstructure and composition of the atmosphere, such as the presence of Rayleigh\nscattering or aerosols.\n", "  Dynamical mean-field theory is used to study the three orbital model of the\n$d^3$ compound SrRu$_2$O$_6$ both with and without explicitly including the\nO-$p$ states. Depending on the size of the Hund's coupling $J$, at low to\nintermediate temperatures we find solutions corresponding to Mott or correlated\ncovalent insulator. The latter can explain the experimentally observed absence\nof Curie susceptibility in the paramagnetic phase. At high temperatures a\nsingle phase with smoothly varying properties is observed. SrRu$_2$O$_6$\nprovides an ideal system to study the competition between the local moment\nphysics and covalent bonding since both effects are maximized, while spin-orbit\ninteraction is found to play a minor role.\n", "  The proof of the long-standing conjecture is presented that Markovian quantum\nmaster equations are at odds with quantum thermodynamics under conventional\nassumptions of fluctuation-dissipation theorems (implying a translation\ninvariant dissipation). Specifically, except for identified systems, persistent\nsystem-bath correlations of at least one kind, spatial or temporal, are\nobligatory for thermalization. A systematic procedure is proposed to construct\ntranslation invariant bath models producing steady states that well-approximate\nthermal states. A quantum optical scheme for the laboratory assessment of the\ndeveloped procedure is outlined.\n", "  Simulation-based image quality metrics are adapted and investigated for\ncharacterizing the parameter dependences of linear iterative image\nreconstruction for DBT. Three metrics based on 2D DBT simulation are\ninvestigated: (1) a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) between the test phantom and\nreconstructed image, (2) a gradient RMSE where the comparison is made after\ntaking a spatial gradient of both image and phantom, and (3) a\nregion-of-interest (ROI) Hotelling observer (HO) for\nsignal-known-exactly/background-known-exactly (SKE/BKE) and\nsignal-known-exactly/background-known-statistically (SKE/BKS) detection tasks.\nTwo simulation studies are performed using the aforementioned metrics, varying\nvoxel aspect ratio and regularization strength for two types of Tikhonov\nregularized least-squares optimization. The RMSE metrics are applied to a 2D\ntest phantom and the ROI-HO metric is applied to two tasks relevant to DBT:\nlarge, low contrast lesion detection and small, high contrast\nmicrocalcification detection. The RMSE metric trends are compared with visual\nassessment of the reconstructed test phantom. The ROI-HO metric trends are\ncompared with 3D reconstructed images from ACR phantom data acquired with a\nHologic Selenia Dimensions DBT system. Sensitivity of image RMSE to mean pixel\nvalue is found to limit its applicability to the assessment of DBT image\nreconstruction. Image gradient RMSE is insensitive to mean pixel value and\nappears to track better with subjective visualization of the reconstructed\nbar-pattern phantom. The ROI-HO metric shows an increasing trend with\nregularization strength for both forms of Tikhonov-regularized least-squares;\nhowever, this metric saturates at intermediate regularization strength\nindicating a point of diminishing returns for signal detection. Visualization\nwith reconstructed ACR phantom images appears to show a similar dependence with\nregularization strength.\n", "  The success of descriptor-based material design relies on eliminating bad\ncandidates and keeping good candidates for further investigation. While DFT has\nbeen widely successfully for the former, often times good candidates are lost\ndue to the uncertainty associated with the DFT-predicted material properties.\nUncertainty associated with DFT predictions has gained prominence and has led\nto the development of exchange correlation functionals that have built-in error\nestimation capability. In this work, we demonstrate the use of built-in error\nestimation capabilities within the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation functional for\nquantifying the uncertainty associated with the magnetic ground state of\nsolids. We demonstrate this approach by calculating the uncertainty estimate\nfor the energy difference between the different magnetic states of solids and\ncompare them against a range of GGA exchange correlation functionals as is done\nin many first principles calculations of materials. We show that this estimate\nreasonably bounds the range of values obtained with the different GGA\nfunctionals. The estimate is determined as a post-processing step and thus\nprovides a computationally robust and systematic approach to estimating\nuncertainty associated with predictions of magnetic ground states. We define a\nconfidence value (c-value) that incorporates all calculated magnetic states in\norder to quantify the concurrence of the prediction at the GGA level and argue\nthat predictions of magnetic ground states from GGA level DFT is incomplete\nwithout an accompanying c-value. We demonstrate the utility of this method\nusing a case study of Li and Na-ion cathode materials and the c-value metric\ncorrectly identifies that GGA level DFT will have low predictability for\nNaFePO$_4$F.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a generic interacting many-body system under\nconditions of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). This problem is\nof current relevance due to its connection to non-linear optical media realized\nby Rydberg atoms. In an interacting system the structure of the dynamics and\nthe approach to the stationary state becomes far more complex than in the case\nof conventional EIT. In particular, we discuss the emergence of a metastable\ndecoherence free subspace, whose dimension for a single Rydberg excitation\ngrows linearly in the number of atoms. On approach to stationarity this leads\nto a slow dynamics which renders the typical assumption of fast relaxation\ninvalid. We derive analytically the effective non-equilibrium dynamics in the\ndecoherence free subspace which features coherent and dissipative two-body\ninteractions. We discuss the use of this scenario for the preparation of\ncollective entangled dark states and the realization of general unitary\ndynamics within the spin-wave subspace.\n", "  We considered one-dimensional chain of the two-level quantum systems coupled\nvia tunneling. The chain is driven by the superposition of dc and ac fields in\nthe strong coupling regime. Based on the fundamental principles of\nelectrodynamics and quantum theory, we developed a generalized model of quantum\ndynamics for such interactions, free of rotating wave approximation (RWA). The\nsystem of motion equations was studied numerically. We analyzed the dynamics\nand spectra of inversion density, dipole current density and tunneling current\ndensity. In the case of resonant interaction with ac-component the particle\ndynamics exhibits itself in the oscillatory regime, which may be interpreted as\na combination of Rabi- and Bloch oscillations with their strong mutual\ninfluence. Such scenario for an obliquely incident ac field dramatically\ndiffers from the individual picture both types of oscillations due to an\ninteractions. This novel effect is counterintuitive because of the strongly\ndifferent frequency ranges for such two types of oscillations existence. This\ndynamics manifests itself in multi-line spectra at different combinations of\nRabi- and Bloch frequencies. The effect is promising as a framework of new type\nof spectroscopy in nanoelectronics and electrical control of nano-devices.\n", "  We have developed a novel Markov Chain Mote Carlo (MCMC) chemical \"painting\"\ntechnique to explore possible radial and vertical metallicity gradients for the\nthick disc progenitor. In our analysis we match an N-body simulation to the\ndata from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)\nsurvey. We assume that the thick disc has a constant scale-height and has\ncompleted its formation at an early epoch, after which time radial mixing of\nits stars has taken place. Under these assumptions, we find that the initial\nradial metallicity gradient of the thick disc progenitor should not be\nnegative, but either flat or even positive, to explain the current negative\nvertical metallicity gradient of the thick disc. Our study suggests that the\nthick disc was built-up in an inside-out and upside-down fashion, and older,\nsmaller and thicker populations are more metal poor. In this case, star forming\ndiscs at different epochs of the thick disc formation are allowed to have\ndifferent radial metallicity gradients, including a negative one, which helps\nto explain a variety of slopes observed in high redshift disc galaxies. This\nscenario helps to explain the positive slope of the metallicity-rotation\nvelocity relation observed for the Galactic thick disc. On the other hand,\nradial mixing flattens the slope of an existing gradient.\n", "  Real-world networks often have power-law degrees and scale-free properties\nsuch as ultra-small distances and ultra-fast information spreading. In this\npaper, we study a third universal property: three-point correlations that\nsuppress the creation of triangles and signal the presence of hierarchy. We\nquantify this property in terms of $\\bar c(k)$, the probability that two\nneighbors of a degree-$k$ node are neighbors themselves. We investigate how the\nclustering spectrum $k\\mapsto\\bar c(k)$ scales with $k$ in the hidden variable\nmodel and show that $c(k)$ follows a {\\it universal curve} that consists of\nthree $k$-ranges where $\\bar c(k)$ remains flat, starts declining, and\neventually settles on a power law $\\bar c(k)\\sim k^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha$\ndepending on the power law of the degree distribution. We test these results\nagainst ten contemporary real-world networks and explain analytically why the\nuniversal curve properties only reveal themselves in large networks.\n", "  LHC experiments can provide a remarkable sensitivity to exotic metastable\nmassive particles, decaying with significant displacement from the interaction\npoint. The best sensitivity is achieved to models where the production and\ndecay occur due to different coupling constants, and the lifetime of exotic\nparticles determines the probability of decay within a detector. The lifetimes\nof such particles can be independently limited from standard cosmology, in\nparticular the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we analyze the\nconstraints on the simplest scalar model coupled through the Higgs portal,\nwhere the production occurs via $h\\to SS$, and the decay is induced by the\nsmall mixing angle of the Higgs field $h$ and scalar $S$. We find that\nthroughout the most part of the parameter space, $2 m_\\mu < m_S < m_h/2$, the\nlifetimes of exotic particle has to be less than 0.1 seconds, while below\n$2m_\\mu$ it could grow to about a second. The strong constraints on lifetimes\nare induced by the nucleonic and mesonic decays of scalars that tend to raise\nthe $n/p$ ratio. Strong constraints on lifetimes of the minimal singlet\nextensions of the Higgs potential is a welcome news for the MATHUSLA proposal\nthat seeks to detect displaced decays of exotic particles produced in the LHC\ncollisions. We also point out how more complicated exotic sectors could evade\nthe BBN lifetime constraints.\n", "  We present a self-contained study of the dynamics of oscillating nanomenisci\nanchored on nanometric topographical defects around a cylindrical nanofiber --\nradius below 100 nm. Using frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy\n(FM-AFM), we show that the friction coefficient surges as the contact angle is\ndecreased. We propose a theoretical model within the lubrification\napproximation that reproduces the experimental data and provides a\ncomprehensive description of the dynamics of the nanomeniscus. The dissipation\npattern in the vicinity of the contact line and the anchoring properties are\ndiscussed as a function of liquid and surface properties in addition to the\nsollicitation conditions.\n", "  We present a highly sensitive miniaturized cavity-enhanced room-temperature\nmagnetic-field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The\nmagnetic resonance signal is detected by probing absorption on the 1042\\,nm\nspin-singlet transition. To improve the absorptive signal the diamond is placed\nin an optical resonator. The device has a magnetic-field sensitivity of 28\npT/$\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$, a projected photon shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 22\npT/$\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$ and an estimated quantum projection-noise-limited\nsensitivity of 0.43 pT/$\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$ with the sensing volume of $\\sim$ 390\n$\\mu$m $\\times$ 4500 $\\mu$m$^{2}$. The presented miniaturized device is the\nbasis for an endoscopic magnetic field sensor for biomedical applications.\n", "  We consider the four-point correlator of the stress-energy tensor multiplet\nin ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM. In the planar limit and at large 't Hooft coupling such\ncorrelator is given by the corresponding holographic correlation function in\nIIB supergravity on $AdS_5 \\times S^5$. We consider subleading corrections in\nthe number of colours, i.e. order $1/N^4$, at large 't Hooft coupling. This\ncorresponds to loop corrections to the supergravity result. Consistency\nconditions, most notably crossing symmetry, constrain the form of such\ncorrections and lead to a complete determination of the spectrum of leading\ntwist intermediate operators.\n", "  We propose a model-independent formalism to numerically solve the modified\nFriedmann equations in the framework of $f(T)$ teleparallel cosmology. Our\nstrategy is to expand the Hubble parameter around the redshift $z=0$ up to a\ngiven order and to adopt cosmographic bounds as initial settings to determine\nthe corresponding $f(z)\\equiv f(T(H(z)))$ function. In this perspective, we\ndistinguish two cases: the first expansion is up to the jerk parameter, the\nsecond expansion is up to the snap parameter. We show that inside the observed\nredshift domain $z\\leq1$, only the net strength of $f(z)$ is modified passing\nfrom jerk to snap, whereas its functional behavior and shape turn out to be\nidentical. As first step, we set the cosmographic parameters by means of the\nmost recent observations. Afterwards, we calibrate our numerical solutions with\nthe concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. In both cases, there is a good agreement\nwith the cosmological standard model around $z\\leq 1$, with severe\ndiscrepancies outer of this limit. We demonstrate that the effective dark\nenergy term evolves following the test-function: $f(z)=\\mathcal A+\\mathcal\nBz^2e^{\\mathcal Cz}$. Bounds over the set $\\left\\{\\mathcal A, \\mathcal B,\n\\mathcal C\\right\\}$ are also fixed by statistical considerations, comparing\ndiscrepancies between $f(z)$ with data. The approach opens the possibility to\nget a wide class of test-functions able to frame the dynamics of $f(T)$ without\npostulating any model \\emph{a priori}. We thus re-obtain the $f(T)$ function\nthrough a back-scattering procedure once $f(z)$ is known. We figure out the\nproperties of our $f(T)$ function at the level of background cosmology, to\ncheck the goodness of our numerical results. Finally, a comparison with\nprevious cosmographic approaches is carried out giving results compatible with\ntheoretical expectations.\n", "  We present the discovery of four low-mass ($M<0.6$ $M_\\odot$) eclipsing\nbinary (EB) systems in the sub-Gyr old Praesepe open cluster using Kepler/K2\ntime-series photometry and Keck/HIRES spectroscopy. We present a new Gaussian\nprocess eclipsing binary model, GP-EBOP, as well as a method of simultaneously\ndetermining effective temperatures and distances for EBs. Three of the reported\nsystems (AD 3814, AD 2615 and AD 1508) are detached and double-lined, and\nprecise solutions are presented for the first two. We determine masses and\nradii to 1-3% precision for AD 3814 and to 5-6% for AD 2615. Together with\neffective temperatures determined to $\\sim$50 K precision, we test the PARSEC\nv1.2 and BHAC15 stellar evolution models. Our EB parameters are more consistent\nwith the PARSEC models, primarily because the BHAC15 temperature scale is\nhotter than our data over the mid M-dwarf mass range probed. Both ADs 3814 and\n2615, which have orbital periods of 6.0 and 11.6 days, are circularized but not\nsynchronized. This suggests that either synchronization proceeds more slowly in\nfully convective stars than the theory of equilibrium tides predicts or\nmagnetic braking is currently playing a more important role than tidal forces\nin the spin evolution of these binaries. The fourth system (AD 3116) comprises\na brown dwarf transiting a mid M-dwarf, which is the first such system\ndiscovered in a sub-Gyr open cluster. Finally, these new discoveries increase\nthe number of characterized EBs in sub-Gyr open clusters by 20% (40%) below\n$M<1.5$ $M_{\\odot}$ ($M<0.6$ $M_{\\odot}$).\n", "  The enthalpies of dissolution of metastable rock salt and thermodynamically\nstable wurtzite polymorphs of zinc oxide in aqueous H2SO4 have been measured in\ndirect calorimetric experiments at 303 K and 0.1 MPa and the obtained results\nenabled determination of the standard enthalpy of the rock salt-to-wurtzite\nphase transition in ZnO, {\\Delta}trH = -11.7+/-0.3 kJ/mol.\n", "  We present the multiwavelength photometry of two Frontier Fields massive\ngalaxy clusters MACS-J0717 and MACS-J1149 and their parallel fields, ranging\nfrom HST to ground based K and Spitzer IRAC bands, and the public release of\nphotometric redshifts and rest frame properties of galaxies found in cluster\nand parallel pointings. This work was done within ASTRODEEP project and aims to\nprovide a reference for future investigations of the extragalactic populations.\n  To fully exploit the depth of the images and detect faint sources we used an\naccurate procedure which carefully removes the foreground light of bright\ncluster sources and the intra-cluster light thus enabling detection and\nmeasurement of accurate fluxes in crowded cluster regions. This same procedure\nhas been successfully used to derive the photometric catalogue of MACS-J0416\nand Abell-2744.\n  The obtained multi-band photometry was used to derive photometric redshifts,\nmagnification and physical properties of sources. In line with the first two FF\ncatalogues released by ASTRODEEP, the photometric redshifts reach $\\sim$4$\\%$\naccuracy. Moreover we extend the presently available samples to galaxies\nintrinsically as faint as H160$\\sim$32-34 mag thanks the magnification factors\ninduced to strong gravitational lensing. Our analysis allows us to probe galaxy\nmasses larger then 10$^{7}$ M$\\odot$ and/or SFR=0.1-1M$\\odot$/yr out to\nredshift z$>6$.\n", "  Recently, spin-one wavefunctions in four dimensions that are conformal\nprimaries of the Lorentz group SL(2,C) were constructed. We compute low-point,\ntree-level gluon scattering amplitudes in the space of these conformal primary\nwavefunctions. The answers have the same conformal covariance as correlators of\nspin-one primaries in a 2d CFT. The BCFW recursion relation between three- and\nfour-point gluon amplitudes is recast into this conformal basis.\n", "  A magnon Nernst effect, an antiferromagnetic analogue of the magnon Hall\neffect in ferromagnetic insulators, has been studied experimentally for a\nlayered antiferromagnetic insulator MnPS3 in contact with two Pt strips.\nThermoelectric voltage in the Pt strips grown on MnPS3 single crystals exhibits\nnon-monotonic temperature dependence at low temperatures, which cannot be\nexplained by electronic origins in Pt but can be ascribed to the inverse spin\nHall voltage induced by a magnon Nernst effect. Control of antiferromagnetic\ndomains in the MnPS3 crystal by magnetoelectric cooling is found to modulate\nthe low-temperature thermoelectric voltage in Pt, which corroborates the\nemergence of the magnon Nernst effect in Pt|MnPS3 hybrid structures.\n", "  We study spontaneous emission from a rubidium atom into the fundamental and\nhigher-order modes of a vacuum-clad ultrathin optical fiber. We show that the\nspontaneous emission rate depends on the magnetic sublevel, the type of modes,\nthe orientation of the quantization axis, and the fiber radius. We find that\nthe rate of spontaneous emission into the TE modes is always symmetric with\nrespect to the propagation directions. Directional asymmetry of spontaneous\nemission into other modes may appear when the quantization axis does not lie in\nthe meridional plane containing the position of the atom. When the fiber radius\nis in the range from 330 nm to 450 nm, the spontaneous emission into the\nHE$_{21}$ modes is stronger than into the HE$_{11}$, TE$_{01}$, and TM$_{01}$\nmodes. At the cutoff for higher-order modes, the rates of spontaneous emission\ninto guided and radiation modes undergo steep variations, which are caused by\nthe changes in the mode structure. We show that the spontaneous emission from\nthe upper level of the cyclic transition into the TM modes is unidirectional\nwhen the quantization axis lies at an appropriate azimuthal angle in the fiber\ntransverse plane.\n", "  Multistability is an inseparable feature of many physical, chemical and\nbiological systems which are driven far from equilibrium. In these\nnonequilibrium systems, stochastic dynamics often induces switching between\ndistinct states on emergent timescales, for example, bistable switching is a\nnatural feature of noisy, spatially-extended systems that consist of bistable\nelements. Nevertheless, here we present experimental evidence that bistable\nelements are not required for the global bistability of a system. We observe\ntemporal switching between a crystalline, condensed state and a gas-like,\nexcited state in a spatially-extended, quasi-two-dimensional system of charged\nmicroparticles. Accompanying numerical simulations show that conservative\nforces, damping, and stochastic noise are sufficient to prevent steady-state\nequilibrium, leading to switching between the two states over a range of time\nscales, from seconds to hours.\n", "  We present a theory of the interfacial stability of two immiscible\nelectrolytes under the coupled action of pressure gradients and electric fields\nin a Hele-Shaw cell or porous medium. Mathematically, our theory describes a\nphenomenon of \"Vector Laplacian Growth\", in which the interface moves in\nresponse to the gradient of a vector-valued potential function through a\ngeneralized mobility tensor. Physically, we extend classical Saffman-Taylor\nproblem to electrolytes by incorporating electrokinetic phenomena. A surprising\nprediction is that viscous fingering can be controlled by varying the injection\nratio of electric current to flow rate. Beyond a critical injection ratio,\nstability depends only upon the relative direction of flow and current,\nregardless of the viscosity ratio. Possible applications include porous\nmaterials processing, electrically enhanced oil recovery, and electrokinetic\nremediation of contaminated soils.\n", "  An ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is an attractive\ndevice to detect small magnetic fields. In particular, by exploiting the fact\nthat the NV center can be aligned along one of four different axes due to\nsymmetry, it is possible to extract information concerning vector magnetic\nfields. However, in the conventional scheme, low readout contrasts of the NV\ncenters significantly decrease the sensitivity of the vector magnetic field\nsensing. Here, we propose a way to improve the sensitivity of the vector\nmagnetic field sensing of the NV centers using multi-frequency control. Since\nthe Zeeman energy of the NV centers depends on the direction of the axis, we\ncan independently control the four types of NV centers using microwave pulses\nwith different frequencies. This allows us to use every NV center for the\nvector field detection in parallel, which effectively increases the readout\ncontrast. Our results pave the way to realize a practical diamond-based vector\nfield sensor.\n", "  4U0114$+$65 is one of the slowest known X-ray pulsars. We present an analysis\nof a pointed observation by the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. The energy-resolved\nlight curve, the time-resolved X-ray spectra provided by the EPIC cameras on\nboard and the first high-resolution spectrum of this source, provided by the\nReflection Grating Spectrometer, were analysed. An X-ray pulse of $9350\\pm 160$\ns was measured, confirming the secular spin up of this source. We also fit the\npulse-phase-resolved spectra with Comptonisation models. These models imply a\nvery small ($r\\sim 3$ km) and hot ($kT\\sim 2-3$ keV) emitting region and\ntherefore point to a hot spot over the neutron star (NS) surface as the most\nreliable explanation for the X-ray pulse. The long NS spin period, the spin-up\nrate, and persistent X-ray emission can be explained within the theory of\nquasi-spherical settling accretion, which may indicate that the magnetic field\nis in the magnetar range. Thus, 4U 0114$+$65 could be a wind-accreting\nmagnetar. We also observed two episodes of low luminosity. The first can be\nexplained as an absorption by an over-dense structure in the wind of the donor.\nThe second episode may be due to temporal cessation of accretion onto one\nmagnetic pole caused by non-spherical matter capture from the structured\nstellar wind. The light curve displays two types of dips seen during the\nhigh-flux intervals. The short dips, with durations of tens of seconds, are\nproduced through absorption by wind clumps. The long dips might be associated\nwith the rarefied interclump medium. We also found evidence of emission lines\nin the X-ray photoionised wind of the B1Ia donor. The Fe K$\\alpha$ line is\nhighly variable and much weaker than in other X-ray binaries with supergiant\ndonors. The degree of wind clumping, measured through the covering fraction, is\nmuch lower than in supergiant donor stars with earlier spectral types.\n", "  We consider a Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model scenario in which the\nonly light superparticles are a bino-like dark matter candidate and a\nnearly-degenerate slepton. It is notoriously difficult to probe this scenario\nat the Large Hadron Collider, because the slepton pair-production process\nyields a final state with soft leptons and small missing transverse energy. We\nstudy this scenario in the region of parameter space where the mass difference\nbetween the lightest neutralino and the lightest slepton ($\\Delta m$) is\n$\\lesssim 60~{\\rm GeV}$, focusing on the process in which an additional\nradiated jet provides a transverse boost to the slepton pair. We then utilize\nthe angular separation of the leptons from each other and from the missing\ntransverse energy, as well as the angular separation between the jet and the\nmissing transverse energy, to distinguish signal from background events. We\nalso use the reconstructed ditau mass, the $\\cos \\theta^*_{\\ell^+ \\ell^-}$\nvariable, and for larger $\\Delta m$, a lower bound on the lepton $p_T$. These\ncuts can dramatically improve both signal sensitivity and the\nsignal-to-background ratio, permitting discovery at the Large Hadron Collider\nwith reasonable integrated luminosity over the interesting region of parameter\nspace. Using our search strategy the LHC will be able to exclude\n$m_{\\tilde{\\mu}} \\approx 200$ GeV for $\\Delta m \\lesssim 60$ GeV at $1.5-3\n\\sigma$ with 1000 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. Although we focus on a\nparticular model, the results generalize to a variety of scenarios in which the\ndark matter and a leptonic partner are nearly degenerate in mass, and\nespecially to scenarios featuring a scalar mediator.\n", "  I present an explicit classical simulation of arbitrary quantum noise for\nquantum models in which one qubit interacts with a quantum bath. The classical\nmodel simulates the interaction of the bath and the qubit by random unitary\nevolutions. I show that any arbitrary quantum dynamics, including quantum\ndissipation, recurrence, and dephasing, can be simulated classically when one\nallows the unitary operators in the classical model to depend on the initial\nstate of the system and bath. For initial mixed states of the system and\nnon-product states of the system and bath, I demonstrate that random unitary\nexpansion is still possible, in terms of a set of pure states.\n", "  Dense stellar winds may mass-load the jets of active galactic nuclei,\nalthough it is unclear what are the time and spatial scales in which the mixing\ntakes place. We study the first steps of the interaction between jets and\nstellar winds, and also the scales at which the stellar wind may mix with the\njet and mass-load it. We present a detailed two-dimensional simulation,\nincluding thermal cooling, of a bubble formed by the wind of a star. We also\nstudy the first interaction of the wind bubble with the jet using a\nthree-dimensional simulation in which the star enters the jet. Stability\nanalysis is carried out for the shocked wind structure, to evaluate the\ndistances over which the jet-dragged wind, which forms a tail, can propagate\nwithout mixing with the jet flow. The two-dimensional simulations point at\nquick wind bubble expansion and fragmentation after about one bubble shock\ncrossing time. Three-dimensional simulations and stability analysis point at\nlocal mixing in the case of strong perturbations and relatively small density\nratios between the jet and the jet dragged-wind, and to a possibly more stable\nshocked wind structure at the phase of maximum tail mass flux. Analytical\nestimates also indicate that very early stages of the star jet-penetration time\nmay be also relevant for mass loading. The combination of these and previous\nresults from the literature suggest highly unstable interaction structures and\nefficient wind-jet flow mixing on the scale of the jet interaction height,\npossibly producing strong inhomogeneities within the jet. In addition, the\ninitial wind bubble shocked by the jet leads to a transient, large interaction\nsurface. The interaction structure can be a source of significant non-thermal\nemission.\n", "  Due to integrability, baryon-baryon scattering in the massless Gross-Neveu\nmodel at large N features only forward elastic scattering. A bare mass term\nbreaks integrability and is therefore expected to induce backward elastic\nscattering as well as inelastic reactions. We confirm these expectations by a\nstudy of baryon-baryon scattering in the massive Gross-Neveu model near the\nnon-relativistic limit. This restriction enables us to solve the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock equations with controlled approximations, using a combination of\nanalytical methods from an effective field theory and the numerical solution of\npartial differential equations.\n", "  It has recently been shown that optical parametric oscillator (OPO) Ising\nmachines, consisting of coupled optical pulses circulating in a cavity with\nparametric gain, can be used to probabilistically find low-energy states of\nIsing spin systems. In this work, we study optical Ising machines that operate\nunder simplified Gaussian dynamics. We show that these dynamics are sufficient\nfor reaching probabilities of success comparable to previous work. Based on\nthis result, we propose modified optical Ising machines with simpler designs\nthat do not use parametric gain yet achieve similar performance, thus\nsuggesting a route to building much larger systems.\n", "  Assessing the consistency of parameter constraints derived from different\ncosmological probes is an important way to test the validity of the underlying\ncosmological model. In an earlier work [Nicola et al., 2017], we computed\nconstraints on cosmological parameters for $\\Lambda$CDM from an integrated\nanalysis of CMB temperature anisotropies and CMB lensing from Planck, galaxy\nclustering and weak lensing from SDSS, weak lensing from DES SV as well as Type\nIa supernovae and Hubble parameter measurements. In this work, we extend this\nanalysis and quantify the concordance between the derived constraints and those\nderived by the Planck Collaboration as well as WMAP9, SPT and ACT. As a measure\nfor consistency, we use the Surprise statistic [Seehars et al., 2014], which is\nbased on the relative entropy. In the framework of a flat $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model, we find all data sets to be consistent with one another at\na level of less than 1$\\sigma$. We highlight that the relative entropy is\nsensitive to inconsistencies in the models that are used in different parts of\nthe analysis. In particular, inconsistent assumptions for the neutrino mass\nbreak its invariance on the parameter choice. When consistent model assumptions\nare used, the data sets considered in this work all agree with each other and\n$\\Lambda$CDM, without evidence for tensions.\n", "  We present a discussion of models of nuclear effects used to describe an\ninclusive electron-nucleus scattering in the quasielastic (QE) peak region,\naiming to compare them and draw conclusion of their reliability when applied in\nneutrino-nucleus interactions. A basic motivation is to reduce systematic\nerrors in neutrino oscillation experiments. We concentrate on the neutrino\nenergy profile of the T2K experiment, which provides us a region of the\ngreatest importance in terms of the highest contribution to the charge-current\nquasielastic (CCQE) cross section. We choose only electron-nucleus data that\noverlaps with this region. In order to clearify the analysis, we split the data\nsets into three groups and draw conclusion separately from each one of them.\n  We selected six models for this comparison: Benhar's spectral function with\nand without final state interaction (Benhar's SF+FSI), Valencia spectral\nfunction (Valencia SF), for higher energy transfer only with the hole spectral\nfunction; GiBUU and also the local and global Fermi gas models. The latter two\nare included as a benchmark to quantify the effect of various nuclear effects.\nAll the six models are often used in neutrino scattering studies. A short\ntheoretical description of each model is given. Although in the selected data\nsets the QE mechanism dominates, we also briefly discuss a possible impact of\n$2p2h$ and $\\Delta$ contributions.\n", "  We give precise quantum resource estimates for Shor's algorithm to compute\ndiscrete logarithms on elliptic curves over prime fields. The estimates are\nderived from a simulation of a Toffoli gate network for controlled elliptic\ncurve point addition, implemented within the framework of the quantum computing\nsoftware tool suite LIQ$Ui|\\rangle$. We determine circuit implementations for\nreversible modular arithmetic, including modular addition, multiplication and\ninversion, as well as reversible elliptic curve point addition. We conclude\nthat elliptic curve discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve defined over an\n$n$-bit prime field can be computed on a quantum computer with at most $9n +\n2\\lceil\\log_2(n)\\rceil+10$ qubits using a quantum circuit of at most $448 n^3\n\\log_2(n) + 4090 n^3$ Toffoli gates. We are able to classically simulate the\nToffoli networks corresponding to the controlled elliptic curve point addition\nas the core piece of Shor's algorithm for the NIST standard curves P-192,\nP-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521. Our approach allows gate-level comparisons to\nrecent resource estimates for Shor's factoring algorithm. The results also\nsupport estimates given earlier by Proos and Zalka and indicate that, for\ncurrent parameters at comparable classical security levels, the number of\nqubits required to tackle elliptic curves is less than for attacking RSA,\nsuggesting that indeed ECC is an easier target than RSA.\n", "  The independent control of two magnetic electrodes and spin-coherent\ntransport in magnetic tunnel junctions are strictly required for tunneling\nmagnetoresistance, while junctions with only one ferromagnetic electrode\nexhibit tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance dependent on the anisotropic\ndensity of states with no room temperature performance so far. Here we report\nan alternative approach to obtaining tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance in\nalfa-FeRh-based junctions driven by the magnetic phase transition of alfa-FeRh\nand resultantly large variation of the density of states in the vicinity of MgO\ntunneling barrier, referred to as phase transition tunneling anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance. The junctions with only one alfa-FeRh magnetic electrode\nshow a magnetoresistance ratio up to 20% at room temperature. Both the polarity\nand magnitude of the phase transition tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance\ncan be modulated by interfacial engineering at the alfa-FeRh/MgO interface.\nBesides the fundamental significance, our finding might add a different\ndimension to magnetic random access memory and antiferromagnet spintronics.\n", "  Magnetically active stars possess stellar winds whose interaction with\nplanetary magnetic fields produces radio auroral emission. We examine the\ndetectability of radio auroral emission from Proxima b, the closest known\nexosolar planet orbiting our nearest neighboring star, Proxima Centauri. Using\nthe Radiometric Bode's Law, we estimate the radio flux produced by the\ninteraction of Proxima Centauri's stellar wind and Proxima b's magnetosphere\nfor different planetary magnetic field strengths. For plausible planetary\nmasses, Proxima b produces 6-83 mJy of auroral radio flux at frequencies of\n0.3-0.8 MHz for planetary magnetic field strengths of 1-3 B$_{\\oplus}$.\nAccording to recent MHD models that vary the orbital parameters of the system,\nthis emission is expected to be highly variable. This variability is due to\nlarge fluctuations in the size of Proxima b's magnetosphere as it crosses the\nequatorial streamer regions of the dense stellar wind and high dynamic\npressure. Using the MHD model of Garraffo et al. 2016 for the variation of the\nmagnetosphere radius during the orbit, we estimate that the observed radio flux\ncan vary nearly by an order of magnitude over the 11.2 day period of Proxima b.\nThe detailed amplitude variation depends on the stellar wind, orbital, and\nplanetary magnetic field parameters. We discuss observing strategies for\nproposed future space-based observatories to reach frequencies below the\nionospheric cut off ($\\sim 10$ MHz) as would be required to detect the signal\nwe investigate.\n", "  Many physical phenomena occur on domains that grow in time. When the\ntimescales of the phenomena and domain growth are comparable, models must\ninclude the dynamics of the domain. A widespread intrinsically slow transport\nprocess is subdiffusion. Many models of subdiffusion include a history\ndependence. This greatly confounds efforts to incorporate domain growth. Here\nwe derive the fractional partial differential equations that govern\nsubdiffusion on a growing domain, based on a Continuous Time Random Walk. This\nrequires the introduction of a new, comoving, fractional derivative.\n", "  Radio U-bursts and J-bursts are signatures of electron beams propagating\nalong magnetic loops confined to the corona. The more commonly observed type\nIII radio bursts are signatures of electron beams propagating along magnetic\nloops that extend into interplanetary space. Given the prevalence of solar\nmagnetic flux to be closed in the corona, it is an outstanding question why\ntype III bursts are more frequently observed than U-bursts or J-bursts. We use\nLOFAR imaging spectroscopy between 30-80 MHz of low-frequency U-bursts and\nJ-bursts, for the first time, to understand why electron beams travelling along\ncoronal loops produce radio emission less often. The different radio source\npositions were used to model the spatial structure of the guiding magnetic flux\ntube and then deduce the energy range of the exciting electron beams without\nthe assumption of a standard density model. The radio sources infer a magnetic\nloop 1 solar radius in altitude, with the highest frequency sources starting\naround 0.6 solar radii. Electron velocities were found between 0.13 c and 0.24\nc, with the front of the electron beam travelling faster than the back of the\nelectron beam. The velocities correspond to energy ranges within the beam from\n0.7-11 keV to 0.7-43 keV. The density along the loop is higher than typical\ncoronal density models and the density gradient is smaller. We found that a\nmore restrictive range of accelerated beam and background plasma parameters can\nresult in U-bursts or J-bursts, causing type III bursts to be more frequently\nobserved. The large instability distances required before Langmuir waves are\nproduced by some electron beams, and the small magnitude of the background\ndensity gradients make closed loops less facilitating for radio emission than\nloops that extend into interplanetary space.\n", "  We investigate toroidal Marginally Outer Trapped Surfaces (MOTS) and\nMarginally Outer Trapped Tubes (MOTT) in closed\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometries. They are constructed by\nembedding Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) Clifford tori in a FLRW spacetime. This\nconstruction is used to assess the quality of certain isoperimetric\ninequalities, recently proved in axial symmetry. Similarly to spherically\nsymmetric MOTS existing in FLRW spacetimes, the toroidal ones are also\nunstable.\n", "  We report on a versatile, highly controllable hybrid cold Rydberg atom fiber\ninterface, based on laser cooled atoms transported into a hollow core\nKagom\\'{e} crystal fiber. Our experiments are the first to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of exciting cold Rydberg atoms inside a hollow core fiber and we\nstudy the influence of the fiber on Rydberg electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) signals. Using a temporally resolved detection method to\ndistinguish between excitation and loss, we observe two different regimes of\nthe Rydberg excitations: one EIT regime and one regime dominated by atom loss.\nThese results are a substantial advancement towards future use of our system\nfor quantum simulation or information.\n", "  We study the emergent band topology of subgap Andreev bound states in the\nthree-terminal Josephson junctions. We scrutinize the symmetry constraints of\nthe scattering matrix in the normal region connecting superconducting leads\nthat enable the topological nodal points in the spectrum of Andreev states.\nWhen the scattering matrix possesses time-reversal symmetry, the gap closing\noccurs at special stationary points that are topologically trivial as they\ncarry vanishing Berry fluxes. In contrast, for the time-reversal broken case we\nfind topological monopoles of the Berry curvature and corresponding phase\ntransition between states with different Chern numbers. The latter is\ncontrolled by the structure of the scattering matrix that can be tuned by a\nmagnetic flux piercing through the junction area in a three-terminal geometry.\nThe topological regime of the system can be identified by nonlocal conductance\nquantization that we compute explicitly for a particular parametrization of the\nscattering matrix in the case where each reservoir is connected by a single\nchannel.\n", "  We report ab-plane Hall Effect and magnetoresistivity measurements on\nLa2-xCexCuO4 thin films as a function of doping for magnetic fields up to 14T\nand temperatures down to 1.8K. A dramatic change in the low temperature (1.8 K)\nnormal state Hall coefficient is found near a doping Ce=0.14. This, along with\na nonlinear Hall resistance as a function of magnetic field, suggests that the\nFermi surface reconstructs at a critical doping of Ce= 0.14. A competing\nantiferromagnetic phase is the likely cause of this Fermi surface\nreconstruction. Low temperature linear-in-T resistivity is found at Ce=0.14,\nbut anomalously, also at higher doping. We compare our data with similar\nbehavior found in hole-doped cuprates at a doping where the pseudogap ends\n", "  This work aims at the goal whether the artificial intelligence can recognize\nphase transition without the prior human knowledge. If this becomes successful,\nit can be applied to, for instance, analyze data from quantum simulation of\nunsolved physical models. Toward this goal, we first need to apply the machine\nlearning algorithm to well-understood models and see whether the outputs are\nconsistent with our prior knowledge, which serves as the benchmark of this\napproach. In this work, we feed the compute with data generated by the\nclassical Monte Carlo simulation for the XY model in frustrated triangular and\nunion jack lattices, which has two order parameters and exhibits two phase\ntransitions. We show that the outputs of the principle component analysis agree\nvery well with our understanding of different orders in different phases, and\nthe temperature dependences of the major components detect the nature and the\nlocations of the phase transitions. Our work offers promise for using machine\nlearning techniques to study sophisticated statistical models, and our results\ncan be further improved by using principle component analysis with kernel\ntricks and the neural network method.\n", "  Recently, it was shown that quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase with a\ngap wide enough for practical applications can be realized in the ultra thin\nfilms constructed from two inversely stacked structural elements of trivial\nband insulator BiTeI. Here, we study the edge states in the free-standing\nBi$_2$Te$_2$I$_2$ sextuple layer (SL) and the electronic structure of the\nBi$_2$Te$_2$I$_2$ SL on the natural BiTeI substrate. We show that the\ntopological properties of the Bi$_2$Te$_2$I$_2$ SL on this substrate keep\n$\\mathbb Z_2$ invariant. We also demonstrate that ultra thin centrosymmetric\nfilms constructed in the similar manner but from related material BiTeBr are\ntrivial band insulators up to five-SL film thickness. In contrast to\nBi$_2$Te$_2$I$_2$ for which the stacking of nontrivial SLs in 3D limit gives a\nstrong topological insulator (TI) phase, strong TI is realized in 3D\nBi$_2$Te$_2$Br$_2$ in spite of the SL is trivial. For the last material of the\nBiTe$X$ ($X$=I,Br,Cl) series, BiTeCl, both 2D and 3D centrosymmetric phases are\ncharacterized by topologically trivial band structure.\n", "  We investigate systems of interacting bosonic particles confined within\nslab-like boxes of size L^2 x Z with Z<<L, at their three-dimensional (3D) BEC\ntransition temperature T_c, and below T_c where they experience a quasi-2D\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition (at T_BKT < T_c depending on the\nthickness Z). The low-temperature phase below T_BKT shows quasi-long-range\norder: the planar correlations decay algebraically as predicted by the 2D\nspin-wave theory. This dimensional crossover, from a 3D behavior for T > T_c to\na quasi-2D critical behavior for T < T_BKT, can be described by a transverse\nfinite-size scaling limit in slab geometries. We also extend the discussion to\nthe off-equilibrium behavior arising from slow time variations of the\ntemperature across the BEC transition. Numerical evidence of the 3D->2D\ndimensional crossover is presented for the Bose-Hubbard model defined in\nanisotropic L^2 x Z lattices with Z<<L.\n", "  Domain walls in interacting electronic systems can have distinct localized\nstates, which often govern physical properties and may lead to unprecedented\nfunctionalities and novel devices. However, electronic states within domain\nwalls themselves have not been clearly identified and understood for strongly\ncorrelated electron systems. Here, we resolve the electronic states localized\non domain walls in a Mott-charge-density-wave(CDW) insulator 1T-TaS2 using\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy. We establish that the domain wall state\ndecomposes into two nonconducting states located at the center of domain walls\nand edges of domains. Theoretical calculations reveal their atomistic origin as\nthe local reconstruction of domain walls under the strong influence of electron\ncorrelation. Our results introduce a concept for the domain wall electronic\nproperty, the wall's own internal degrees of freedom, which is potentially\nrelated to the controllability of domain wall electronic properties.\n", "  The combination of the time-reversal-symmetric single-particle backscattering\nfield (commonly known as Rashba spin-orbit coupling) and non-backscattering\nelectron interactions is generally expected to produce inelastic backscattering\nin 1D helical electron liquids at the edge of 2D topological insulators, as\ntheoretically predicted in a number of works. An opposite conclusion of absent\nbackscattering was reached in a recent work [H.-Y. Xie et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n116, 086603 (2016)] for the \"local\" model of the backscattering field and\ninteractions. Motivated to resolve this potential controversy, in the present\nwork, we study backscattering effects employing fermionic perturbation theory\nand considering quite general forms of the backscattering field and electron\ninteractions. We discover that backscattering effects are crucially sensitive\nto the locality properties of the backscattering field and electron\ninteractions, to the symmetry of the latter, as well as to the presence or\nabsence of the cutoff of the electron spectrum. We find that backscattering is\nindeed absent under the following assumptions: (i) local backscattering field;\n(ii.a) local or (ii.b) SU(2)-symmetric interactions; (iii) absent cutoff of the\nedge-state spectrum. However, violation of any of these conditions leads to\nbackscattering. This also reconciles with the results based on the bosonization\ntechnique. We calculate the associated backscattering current, establish its\nlow-bias scaling behavior, and predict a crossover between two different\nscaling regimes. The main implication of our findings is that backscattering of\nsome magnitude is inevitable in a real system, although could be quite\nsuppressed for nearly local backscattering field and interactions.\n", "  Recently, a hybrid percolation transitions (HPT) that exhibits both a\ndiscontinuous transition and critical behavior at the same transition point has\nbeen observed in diverse complex systems. In spite of considerable effort to\ndevelop the theory of HPT, it is still incomplete, particularly when the\ntransition is induced by cluster merging dynamics. Here, we aim to develop a\ntheoretical framework of the HPT induced by such dynamics. We find that two\ncorrelation-length exponents are necessary for characterizing the giant cluster\nand finite clusters, respectively. Finite-size scaling method for the HPT is\nalso introduced. The conventional formula of the fractal dimension in terms of\nthe critical exponents is not valid. Neither the giant nor finite clusters are\nfractals but they have fractal boundaries.\n", "  We show that large gauge transformations in asymptotically flat spacetime can\nbe implemented by sandwiching a shell containing the ingoing hard particles\nbetween two finite-width shells of soft gauge excitations. Integration of the\ngraviton Dirac bracket implies that our observable soft degrees of freedom obey\nthe algebra imposed by Strominger on unobservable boundary degrees of freedom.\nThus, we provide both a derivation and an observable realization of this\nalgebra. The conservation laws associated with asymptotic symmetries are seen\nto arise physically from free propagation of infrared modes. This explains in\nphysical terms our recent result that soft charges fail to constrain the hard\nscattering problem, and so cannot be relevant to the black hole information\nparadox.\n", "  We present the first detailed study of the behaviour of the stellar proper\nmotion across the entire Galactic Anti-centre area visible in the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey data. We use recalibrated SDSS astrometry in combination with\npositions from {\\it Gaia} DR1 to provide tangential motion measurements with a\nsystematic uncertainty $<$5 kms$^{-1}$ for the Main Sequence stars at the\ndistance of the Monoceros Ring. We demonstrate that Monoceros members rotate\naround the Galaxy with azimuthal speeds of ~230 kms$^{-1}$, only slightly lower\nthan that of the Sun. Additionally, both vertical and azimuthal components of\ntheir motion are shown to vary considerably but gradually as a function of\nGalactic longitude and latitude. The stellar over-density in the Anti-centre\nregion can be split into two components, the narrow, stream-like ACS and the\nsmooth Ring. According to our analysis, these two structures show very similar\nbut clearly distinct kinematic trends, which can be summarised as follows: the\namplitude of the velocity variation in $v_{\\phi}$ and $v_z$ in the ACS is\nhigher compared to the Ring, whose velocity gradients appear to be flatter.\nCurrently, no model available can explain the entirety of the data in this area\nof the sky. However, the new accurate kinematic map introduced here should\nprovide strong constraints on the genesis of the Monoceros Ring and the\nassociated sub-structure.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of tin with low buckled honeycomb structure,\nnamed as stanene, is proposed to be an ideal 2D topological insulator with a\nnontrivial gap larger than 0.1 eV. Theoretical works also pointed out the\ntopological property of stanene occurs by strain tuning. In this letter, we\nreport the successful realization of high quality, monolayer stanene film as\nwell as monolayer stanene nanoribbons on Sb(111) surface by molecular beam\nepitaxy, providing an ideal platform to the study of stanene. More importantly,\nwe observed a continuous evolution of the electronic bands of stanene across a\nnanoribbon, which are related to the strain field gradient in stanene. Our work\nexperimentally confirmed that strain is an effective method for band\nengineering in stanene, which is important for fundamental research and\napplication of stanene.\n", "  We present $\\psi'$MSSM, a model based on a $U(1)_{\\psi'}$ extension of the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model. The gauge symmetry $U(1)_{\\psi'}$, also\nknown as $U(1)_N$, is a linear combination of the $U(1)_\\chi$ and $U(1)_\\psi$\nsubgroups of $E_6$. The model predicts the existence of three sterile neutrinos\nwith masses $\\lesssim 0.1~{\\rm eV}$, if the $U(1)_{\\psi'}$ breaking scale is of\norder 10 TeV. Their contribution to the effective number of neutrinos at\nnucleosynthesis is $\\Delta N_{\\nu}\\simeq 0.29$. The model can provide a variety\nof possible cold dark matter candidates including the lightest sterile\nsneutrino. If the $U(1)_{\\psi'}$ breaking scale is increased to $10^3~{\\rm\nTeV}$, the sterile neutrinos, which are stable on account of a $Z_2$ symmetry,\nbecome viable warm dark matter candidates. The observed value of the standard\nmodel Higgs boson mass can be obtained with relatively light stop quarks thanks\nto the D-term contribution from $U(1)_{\\psi'}$. The model predicts diquark and\ndiphoton resonances which may be found at an updated LHC. The well-known $\\mu$\nproblem is resolved and the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be\ngenerated via leptogenesis. The breaking of $U(1)_{\\psi'}$ produces\nsuperconducting strings that may be present in our galaxy. A $U(1)$ R symmetry\nplays a key role in keeping the proton stable and providing the light sterile\nneutrinos.\n", "  We study finite size scaling for the magnetic observables of an impurity\nresiding at the endpoint of an open quantum Ising chain in a transverse\nmagnetic field, realized by locally rescaling the magnetic field by a factor\n$\\mu \\neq 1$. In the homogeneous chain limit at $\\mu = 1$, we find the expected\nfinite size scaling for the longitudinal impurity magnetization, with no\nspecific scaling for the transverse magnetization. At variance, in the\nclassical impurity limit, $\\mu = 0$, we recover finite scaling for the\nlongitudinal magnetization, while the transverse one basically does not scale.\nFor this case, we provide both analytic approximate expressions for the\nmagnetization and the susceptibility as well as numerical evidences for the\nscaling behavior. At intermediate values of $\\mu$, finite size scaling is\nviolated, and we provide a possible explanation of this result in terms of the\nappearance of a second, impurity related length scale. Finally, on going along\nthe standard quantum-to-classical mapping between statistical models, we derive\nthe classical counterpart of the quantum Ising chain with an impurity at its\nendpoint as a classical Ising model on a square lattice wrapped on a\nhalf-infinite cylinder, with the links along the first circle modified as a\nfunction of $\\mu$.\n", "  The interactions between acceptors in semiconductors are often treated in\nqualitatively the same manner as those between donors. Acceptor wave functions\nare taken to be approximately hydrogenic and the standard hydrogen molecule\nHeitler-London model is used to describe acceptor-acceptor interactions. But\ndue to valence band degeneracy and spin-orbit coupling, acceptor states can be\nfar more complex than those of hydrogen atoms, which brings into question the\nvalidity of this approximation. To address this issue, we develop an\nacceptor-acceptor Heitler-London model using single-acceptor wave functions of\nthe form proposed by Baldereschi and Lipari, which more accurately capture the\nphysics of the acceptor states. We calculate the resulting acceptor-pair energy\nlevels and find, in contrast to the two-level singlet-triplet splitting of the\nhydrogen molecule, a rich ten-level energy spectrum. Our results, computed as a\nfunction of inter-acceptor distance and spin-orbit coupling strength, suggest\nthat acceptor-acceptor interactions can be qualitatively different from\ndonor-donor interactions, and should therefore be relevant to the control of\ntwo-qubit interactions in acceptor-based qubit implementations, as well as the\nmagnetic properties of a variety of p-doped semiconductor systems. Further\ninsight is drawn by fitting numerical results to closed-form energy-level\nexpressions obtained via an acceptor-acceptor Hubbard model.\n", "  We report the growth, structure and characterization of BaZnGa, identifying\nit as the sole known ternary compound in the Ba-Zn-Ga system. Single crystals\nof BaZnGa can be grown out of excess Ba-Zn and adopt a tI36 structure type.\nThere are three unique Ba sites and three M\\,=\\,Zn/Ga sites. Using DFT\ncalculations we can argue that whereas one of these three M sites is probably\nsolely occupied by Ga, the other two M sites, most likely, have mixed Zn/Ga\noccupancy. Temperature dependent resistivity and magnetization measurements\nsuggest that BaZnGa is a poor metal with no electronic or magnetic phase\ntransitions between 2\\,K and 300\\,K.\n", "  Knowledge of free energy barriers separating different states is critically\nimportant for assessment of long-term stability of information stored in\nmagnetic devices. This information, however, is not directly accessible by\nstandard simulations of microscopic models because of the ubiquitous time-scale\nproblem, related to the fact that the transitions among different free energy\nminima have character of rare events. Here we show that by employing the\nmetadynamics algorithm based on suitably chosen collective variables, namely\nhelicity and circulation, it is possible to reliably recover the free energy\nlandscape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach on the example\nof vortex nucleation process in magnetic nanodot with lowered spatial symmetry.\nWith the help of reconstructed free energy surfaces (FES) we show the origin of\nthe symmetry broken vortex nucleation, where one polarity of the nucleated\nvortex core is preferred, even though only in-plane magnetic field is present.\n", "  We examine in detail the theoretical foundations of striking long-range\ncouplings emerging in arrays of fluid cells connected by narrow channels by\nusing a lattice gas (Ising model) description of a system. We present a\nreexamination of the well known exact determination of the two-point\ncorrelation function along the edge of a channel using the transfer matrix\ntechnique and a new interpretation is provided. The explicit form of the\ncorrelation length is found to grow exponentially with the cross section of the\nchannels at the bulk two-phase coexistence. The aforementioned result is\nrecaptured by a refined version of the Fisher-Privman theory of first order\nphase transitions in which the Boltzmann factor for a domain wall is decorated\nwith a contribution stemming from the point tension originated at its\nendpoints. The Boltzmann factor for a domain wall together with the point\ntension is then identified exactly thanks to two independent analytical\ntechniques, providing a critical test of the Fisher-Privman theory. We then\nillustrate how to build up the network model from its elementary constituents,\nthe cells and the channels. Moreover, we are able to extract the strength of\nthe coupling between cells and express them in terms of the length and width\nand coarse grained quantities such as surface and point tensions. We then\nsupport our theoretical investigation with a series of corroborating results\nbased on Monte Carlo simulations. We illustrate how the long range ordering\noccurs and how the latter is signaled by the thermodynamic quantities\ncorresponding to both planar and three-dimensional Ising arrays.\n", "  We calculate the full probability density function (PDF) of inflationary\ncurvature perturbations, even in the presence of large quantum backreaction.\nMaking use of the stochastic-$\\delta N$ formalism, two complementary methods\nare developed, one based on solving an ordinary differential equation for the\ncharacteristic function of the PDF, and the other based on solving a heat\nequation for the PDF directly. In the classical limit where quantum diffusion\nis small, we develop an expansion scheme that not only recovers the standard\nGaussian PDF at leading order, but also allows us to calculate the first\nnon-Gaussian corrections to the usual result. In the opposite limit where\nquantum diffusion is large, we find that the PDF is given by an elliptic theta\nfunction, which is fully characterised by the ratio between the squared width\nand height (in Planck mass units) of the region where stochastic effects\ndominate. We then apply these results to the calculation of the mass fraction\nof primordial black holes from inflation, and show that no more than $\\sim 1$\n$e$-fold can be spent in regions of the potential dominated by quantum\ndiffusion. We explain how this requirement constrains inflationary potentials\nwith two examples.\n", "  High fidelity models, which support accurate device characterization and\ncorrectly account for environmental effects, are crucial to the engineering of\nscalable quantum technologies. As it ensures positivity of the density matrix,\none preferred model for open systems describes the dynamics with a master\nequation in Lindblad form. The Linblad operators are rarely derived from first\nprinciples, resulting in dynamical models which miss those additional terms\nthat must generally be added to bring the master equation into Lindblad form,\ntogether with concomitant other terms that must be assimilated into an\neffective Hamiltonian. In first principles derivations such additional terms\nare often cancelled (countered), frequently in an ad hoc manner. In the case of\na Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) coupled to an Ohmic bath,\nthe resulting master equation implies the environment has a significant impact\non the system's energy. We discuss the prospect of keeping or cancelling this\nimpact; and note that, for the SQUID, measuring the magnetic susceptibility\nunder control of the capacitive coupling strength and the externally applied\nflux, results in experimentally measurable differences between models. If this\nis not done correctly, device characterization will be prone to systemic\nerrors.\n", "  We present a free-space interferometer to observe two-particle interference\nof a pair of atoms with entangled momenta. The source of atom pairs is a\nBose--Einstein condensate subject to a dynamical instability, and the\ninterferometer is realized using Bragg diffraction on optical lattices, in the\nspirit of our recent Hong--Ou--Mandel experiment. We report an observation\nconsistent with an entangled state at the input of the interferometer. We\nexplain how our current setup can be extended to enable a test of a Bell\ninequality on momentum observables.\n", "  LARS is an Absolute Reference Spectrograph designed for ultra-precise solar\nobservations. The high-resolution echelle spectrograph of the Vacuum Tower\nTelescope is supported by a state-of-the-art laser frequency comb to calibrate\nthe solar spectrum on an absolute wavelength scale. In this article, we\ndescribe the scientific instrument and focus on the upgrades in the last two\nyears to turn the prototype into a turn-key system. The pursued goal was to\nimprove the short-term and long-term stability of the systems, and enable a\nuser-friendly and more versatile operation of the instrument. The first upgrade\ninvolved the modernization of the frequency comb. The Fabry-Perot cavities were\nadjusted to filter to a repetition frequency of 8GHz. A technologically matured\nphotonic crystal fiber was implemented for spectral broadening. The second,\nquite recent upgrade was performed on the optics feeding the sunlight into a\nsingle-mode fiber connected to the spectrograph. A motorized translation stage\nwas deployed to allow the automated selection of three different fields-of-view\nwith diameters of 1\", 3\", and 10\" for the analysis of the solar spectrum. The\nsuccessful upgrades allow for long-term observations of up to several hours per\nday with a stable spectral accuracy of 1 m/s limited by the spectrograph.\nStable, user-friendly operation of the instrument is supported. The selection\nof the pre-aligned fiber to change the field of view can now be done within\nseconds. LARS offers the possibility to observe absolute wavelength positions\nof spectral lines and Doppler velocities in the solar atmosphere. First results\ndemonstrate the capabilities of the instrument for solar science. The accurate\nmeasurement of the solar convection, p-modes, and atmospheric waves will\nenhance our knowledge of the solar atmosphere and its physical conditions to\nimprove current atmospheric models.\n", "  Low-mass members of young stellar associations exhibit a wide spread of\nrotation periods. Such a spread originates from distributions of masses and\ninitial rotation periods. However, multiplicity can also play a significant\nrole. We investigate the role played by physical companions in shortening the\nprimordial disc lifetime. We have compiled the most extensive list of low-mass\nmembers of the young 25-Myr beta Pictoris association. We have measured the\nrotation periods of about all members and used updated UVWXYZ components to\nassess their membership. We built the rotation period distribution\ndistinguishing between bona fide members and candidate members and according to\ntheir multiplicity status. We found that single stars and components of\nmultiple systems in wide orbits (>80 AU) have rotation periods that exhibit a\nwell defined sequence arising from mass distribution. All components of\nmultiple systems in close orbits (<80 AU) have rotation periods significantly\nshorter than their equal-mass single counterparts. A comparison with the\nyounger 13 Myr h Per cluster and with the older 40-Myr open clusters/stellar\nassociations NGC2547, IC2391, Argus, and IC2602 and the 130-Myr Pleiades shows\nthat whereas the evolution of F-G stars is well reproduced by angular momentum\nevolution models, this is not the case for the slow K and early-M stars.\nFinally, we found that the amplitude of their light curves is correlated\nneither with rotation nor with mass. Once single stars and wide components of\nmultiple systems are separated from close components of multiple systems, the\nrotation period distributions exhibit a well defined dependence on mass that\nallows to make a meaningful comparison with similar distributions of either\nyounger or older associations/clusters. Such cleaned distributions allow to use\nthe stellar rotation period as age indicator, meaningfully for F and G type\nstars.\n", "  Using infinite projected entangled pair states, we study the ground state\nphase diagram of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model on the square\nlattice directly in the thermodynamic limit. We find an unexpected partially\nnematic partially magnetic phase in between the antiferroquadrupolar and\nferromagnetic regions. Furthermore, we describe all observed phases and discuss\nthe nature of the phase transitions involved.\n", "  We set out to compile a catalogue of RRab pulsating variables in the\nSuperWASP archive and identify candidate Blazhko effect objects within this\ncatalogue. We analysed their light curves and power spectra for correlations in\ntheir common characteristics to further our understanding of the phenomenon.\nPulsation periods were found for each SWASP RRab object using PDM techniques.\nLow frequency periodic signals detected in the CLEAN power spectra of RRab\nstars were matched with modulation sidebands and combined with pairs of\nsidebands to produce a list of candidate Blazhko periods. A novel technique was\nused in an attempt to identify Blazhko effect stars by comparing scatter at\ndifferent parts of the folded light curve. Pulsation amplitudes were calculated\nbased on phase folded light curves. The SuperWASP RRab catalogue consists of\n4963 objects of which 3397 are previously unknown. We discovered 983 distinct\ncandidates for Blazhko effect objects, 613 of these being previously unknown in\nthe literature as RR Lyrae stars, and 894 are previously unknown to be Blazhko\neffect stars. Correlations were investigated between the scatter of points on\nthe light curve, the periods and amplitudes of the objects' pulsations, and\nthose of the Blazhko effect. A statistical analysis has been performed on a\nlarge population of Blazhko effect stars from the wide-field SuperWASP survey.\nNo correlations were found between the Blazhko period and other parameters\nincluding the Blazhko amplitude, although we confirmed a lower rate of\noccurrence of the Blazhko effect in long pulsation period objects.\n", "  We show that optically active coupled quantum dots embedded in a\nsuperconducting microwave cavity can be used to realize a fast quantum\ninterface between photonic and transmon qubits. Single photon absorption by a\ncoupled quantum dot results in generation of a large electric dipole, which in\nturn ensures efficient coupling to the microwave cavity. Using cavity\nparameters achieved in prior experiments, we estimate that bi-directional\nmicrowave-optics conversion in nanosecond timescales with efficiencies\napproaching unity is experimentally feasible with current technology. We also\noutline a protocol for in-principle deterministic quantum state transfer from a\ntime-bin photonic qubit to a transmon qubit. Recent advances in quantum dot\nbased quantum photonics technologies indicate that the scheme we propose could\nplay a central role in connecting quantum nodes incorporating cavity-coupled\nsuperconducting qubits.\n", "  We have chosen the reactions $D_s^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^0 a_0(980) (f_0(980))$\ninvestigating the isospin violating channel $D_s^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^0 f_0(980)$.\nThe reaction was chosen because by varying the $\\pi^0 a_0(980) (f_0(980))$\ninvariant mass one goes through the peak of a triangle singularity emerging\nfrom $D_s^+ \\to \\pi^+\\bar K^* K$, followed by $\\bar K^* \\to \\bar K \\pi^0$ and\nthe further merging of $K \\bar K$ to produce the $a_0(980)$ or $f_0(980)$. We\nfound that the amount of isospin violation had its peak precisely at the value\nof the $\\pi^0 a_0(980) (f_0(980))$ invariant mass where the singularity has its\nmaximum, stressing the role of the triangle singularities as a factor to\nenhance the mixing of the $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ resonances. We calculate\nabsolute rates for the reactions and show that they are within present\nmeasurable range. The measurement of these reactions would bring further\ninformation into the role of triangle singularities in isospin violation and\nthe $a_0 -f_0$ mixing in particular and shed further light into the nature of\nthe low energy scalar mesons.\n", "  We measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) skewness power spectrum in\n$\\textit{Planck}$, using frequency maps of the HFI instrument and the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) component map. The two-to-one skewness power spectrum\nmeasures the cross-correlation between CMB lensing and the thermal SZ effect.\nWe also directly measure the same cross-correlation using $\\textit{Planck}$ CMB\nlensing map and the SZ map and compare it to the cross-correlation derived from\nthe skewness power spectrum. We model fit the SZ power spectrum and CMB\nlensing-SZ cross power spectrum via the skewness power spectrum to constrain\nthe gas pressure profile of dark matter halos. The gas pressure profile is\ncompared to existing measurements in the literature including a direct estimate\nbased on the stacking of SZ clusters in $\\textit{Planck}$.\n", "  The detailed study of the low-energy spectrum for a mobile impurity in the\none-dimensional bosonic enviroment is performed. Particularly we have\nconsidered only two analytically accessible limits, namely, the case of an\nimpurity immersed in a dilute Bose gas, where one can use many-body\nperturbation techniques for low-dimensional bosonic systemsm and the case of\nthe Tonks-Girardeau gas, for which the usual fermionic diagrammatic expansion\nup to the second order is applied.\n", "  Quasar microlensing analyses implicitly generate a model of the variability\nof the source quasar. The implied source variability may be unrealistic yet its\nlikelihood is generally not evaluated. We used the damped random walk (DRW)\nmodel for quasar variability to evaluate the likelihood of the source\nvariability and applied the revised algorithm to a microlensing analysis of the\nlensed quasar RX J1131-1231. We compared the estimates of the source quasar\ndisk and average lens galaxy stellar mass with and without applying the DRW\nlikelihoods for the source variability model and found no significant effect on\nthe estimated physical parameters. The most likely explanation is that\nunreliastic source light curve models are generally associated with poor\nmicrolensing fits that already make a negligible contribution to the\nprobability distributions of the derived parameters.\n", "  Aims. We study whether rotational excitation makes a difference to the\nabundances of the $\\rm H_3^+$ isotopologs, including spin states, in physical\nconditions corresponding to starless cores and protostellar envelopes.\n  Methods. We developed a new rate coefficient set for the $\\rm H_3^+$\nisotopologs, allowing for rotational excitation, using the state-to-state rate\ncoefficients from Hugo et al. These new so-called species-to-species rate\ncoefficients are compared with previously-used ground state-to-species rate\ncoefficients.\n  Results. The species-to-species and ground state-to-species model results\ndiffer at high density and toward increasing temperatures ($T > 10$ K). The\nspecies-to-species model predicts a lower $\\rm H_3^+$ deuteration degree at\nhigh density owing to an increase of the rate coefficients of endothermic\nreactions that decrease deuteration. At 20 K the ground state-to-species model\noverestimates the abundance of $\\rm H_2D^+$ by a factor of about two while the\nabundance of $\\rm D_3^+$ can differ by an order of magnitude between the\nmodels. Spin-state abundance ratios are also affected, and the new model better\nreproduces recent observations of ortho and para $\\rm H_2D^+$ and $\\rm D_2H^+$.\nThe applicability regime of the new rate coefficients depends on the critical\ndensities of the various rotational transitions.\n  Conclusions. The difference in the abundances of the $\\rm H_3^+$ isotopologs\npredicted by the two models is negligible at 10 K but excited states are very\nimportant in studies of deuteration at higher temperatures, for example in\nprotostellar envelopes. The species-to-species rate coefficients provide a more\nrealistic approach to the chemistry of the $\\rm H_3^+$ isotopologs than the\nground state-to-species rate coefficients do, and so the former should be\nadopted in chemical models describing the chemistry of the $\\rm H_3^+ + H_2$\nreacting system.\n", "  We have uncovered that the non-equilibrium network dynamics and global\nproperties are determined by two essential features: the potential landscape\nand the flux landscape. We have found that the funneled potential landscape is\ncrucial for the stability of the states on the cell cycle, however, the\nstabilities of the oscillation states cannot guarantee the stable directional\nflows. We have uncovered that the funneled flux landscape is important for the\nemergence and maintenance of the stable limit cycle oscillation flow. This work\nwill allow us to identify the key factors and structure elements of the\nnetworks in determining the stability, speed and robustness of the fission\nyeast cell cycle oscillations. We see that the nonequilibriumness characterized\nby the degree of detailed balance breaking from the energy pump quantified by\nthe flux is the cause of the energy dissipation for initiating and sustaining\nthe replications essential for the origin and evolution of life. Regulating the\ncell cycle speed is crucial for designing the prevention and curing strategy of\ncancer.\n", "  In the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 766, a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation\n(QPO) signal with a period of $\\sim6450$ s is detected in the \\emph{XMM-Newton}\ndata collected on 2005 May 31. This QPO signal is highly statistical\nsignificant at the confidence level at $\\sim5\\sigma$ with the quality factor of\n$Q=f/\\Delta f>13.6$. The X-ray intensity changed by a factor of 3 with root\nmean square fractional variability of $14.3\\%$. Furthermore, this QPO signal\npresents in the data of all three EPIC detectors and two RGS cameras and its\nfrequency follows the $f_{\\rm QPO}$-$M_{\\rm BH}$ relation spanning from\nstellar-mass to supermassive black holes. Interestingly, a possible QPO signal\nwith a period of $\\sim4200$ s had been reported in the literature. The\nfrequency ratio of these two QPO signals is $\\sim$ 3:2. Our result is also in\nsupport of the hypothesis that the QPO signals can be just transient. The\nspectral analysis reveals that the contribution of the soft excess component\nbelow $\\sim$ 1 keV is different between epochs with and without QPO, this\nproperty as well as the former frequency-ratio are well detected in X-ray BH\nbinaries, which may have shed some lights on the physical origin of our event.\n", "  We used the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the IRAM Plateau\nde Bure Interferometer (PdBI) to image, with an angular resolution of 0.5$''$\n(120 au) and 1$''$ (235 au), respectively, the emission from 11 different\norganic molecules in the protostellar binary NGC1333 IRAS 4A. We clearly\ndisentangled A1 and A2, the two protostellar cores present. For the first time,\nwe were able to derive the column densities and fractional abundances\nsimultaneously for the two objects, allowing us to analyse the chemical\ndifferences between them. Molecular emission from organic molecules is\nconcentrated exclusively in A2 even though A1 is the strongest continuum\nemitter. The protostellar core A2 displays typical hot corino abundances and\nits deconvolved size is 70 au. In contrast, the upper limits we placed on\nmolecular abundances for A1 are extremely low, lying about one order of\nmagnitude below prestellar values. The difference in the amount of organic\nmolecules present in A1 and A2 ranges between one and two orders of magnitude.\nOur results suggest that the optical depth of dust emission at these\nwavelengths is unlikely to be sufficiently high to completely hide a hot corino\nin A1 similar in size to that in A2. Thus, the significant contrast in\nmolecular richness found between the two sources is most probably real. We\nestimate that the size of a hypothetical hot corino in A1 should be less than\n12 au. Our results favour a scenario in which the protostar in A2 is either\nmore massive and/or subject to a higher accretion rate than A1, as a result of\ninhomogeneous fragmentation of the parental molecular clump. This naturally\nexplains the smaller current envelope mass in A2 with respect to A1 along with\nits molecular richness.\n", "  We present a covariant formulation and model calculations of transverse\nmomentum-dependent quark distribution functions (TMDs) for spin-one hadrons.\nEmphasis is placed on a description of these 3-dimensional distribution\nfunctions which is independent of any constraints on the spin quantization\naxis. We apply our covariant spin description to all nine leading-twist\ntime-reversal even $\\rho$ meson TMDs in the framework provided by the\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model, incorporating important aspects of quark confinement\nvia the infrared cut-off in the proper-time regularization scheme. In\nparticular, the behavior of the 3-dimensional TMDs in a tensor polarized\nspin-one hadron are illustrated. Sum rules and positivity constraints are\ndiscussed in detail. Results of particular interest include the finding that\nthe tensor polarized TMDs -- associated with spin-one hadrons -- are very\nsensitive to quark orbital angular momentum, and that the TMDs associated with\nthe quark operator $\\gamma^+\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_T\\gamma_5$ would vanish were it\nnot for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. In addition, we find that 44% of\nthe $\\rho$ meson's spin is carried by the orbital angular momentum of the\nquarks, and that the magnitude of the tensor polarized quark distribution\nfunction is about 30% of the unpolarized quark distribution. A qualitative\ncomparison between our results for the tensor structure of a quark-antiquark\nbound state is made to previous experimental and theoretical results for the\ntwo-nucleon (deuteron) bound state.\n", "  A direct consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation is the existence of\ndual supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which may be preferentially triggered as\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) during galaxy mergers. Despite decades of\nsearching, however, dual AGNs are extremely rare, and most have been discovered\nserendipitously. Using the all-sky WISE survey, we identified a population of\nover 100 morphologically identified interacting galaxies or mergers that\ndisplay red mid-infrared colors often associated in extragalactic sources with\npowerful AGNs. The vast majority of these advanced mergers are optically\nclassified as star-forming galaxies suggesting that they may represent an\nobscured population of AGNs that cannot be found through optical studies. In\nthis work, we present Chandra/ACIS observations and near-infrared spectra with\nthe Large Binocular Telescope of six advanced mergers with projected pair\nseparations less than ~ 10 kpc. The combined X-ray, near-infrared, and\nmid-infrared properties of these mergers provide confirmation that four out of\nthe six mergers host at least one AGN, with four of the mergers possibly\nhosting dual AGNs with projected separations less than ~10 kpc, despite showing\nno firm evidence for AGNs based on optical spectroscopic studies. Our results\ndemonstrate that 1) optical studies miss a significant fraction of single and\ndual AGNs in advanced mergers, and 2) mid-infrared pre-selection is extremely\neffective in identifying dual AGN candidates in late-stage mergers. Our\nmulti-wavelength observations suggest that the buried AGNs in these mergers are\nhighly absorbed, with intrinsic column densities in excess of N_H >10^24cm^-2,\nconsistent with hydrodynamic simulations.\n", "  The exclusive production by the photon fusion of magnetic monopoles and the\nbound states of magnetic monopoles, the monopolium, is consider in different\nhigh energy processes. More specifically, we calculate the total cross sections\nof the ultraperipheral elastic collisions of electron-electron, proton-proton\nand lead-lead in present and future colliders, comparing with the previous\nresults found in the literature. Our results indicates that magnetic monopoles\nor his bound states, if both exists, can be measuareble in future\nelectron-electron colliders.\n", "  The recent progress in formation of two-dimensional (2D) GaN by a\nmigration-enhanced encapsulated technique opens up new possibilities for group\nIII-V 2D semiconductors with a band gap within the visible energy spectrum.\nUsing first-principles calculations we explored alloying of 2D-GaN to achieve\nan optically active material with a tuneable band gap. The effect of\nisoelectronic III-V substitutional elements on the band gaps, band offsets, and\nspatial electron localization is studied. In addition to optoelectronic\nproperties, the formability of alloys is evaluated using impurity formation\nenergies. A dilute highly-mismatched solid solution 2D-GaN$_{1-x}$P$_x$\nfeatures an efficient band gap reduction in combination with a moderate energy\npenalty associated with incorporation of phosphorous in 2D-GaN, which is\nsubstantially lower than in the case of the bulk GaN. The group-V alloying\nelements also introduce significant disorder and localization at the valence\nband edge that facilitates direct band gap optical transitions thus implying\nthe feasibility of using III-V alloys of 2D-GaN in light-emitting devices.\n", "  In 2016 we carried out a Swift monitoring program to track the X-ray hardness\nvariability of eight type-I AGN over a year. The purpose of this monitoring was\nto find intense obscuration events in AGN, and thereby study them by triggering\njoint XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST observations. We successfully accomplished\nthis for NGC 3783 in December 2016. We found heavy X-ray absorption produced by\nan obscuring outflow in this AGN. As a result of this obscuration, interesting\nabsorption features appear in the UV and X-ray spectra, which are not present\nin the previous epochs. Namely, the obscuration produces broad and blue-shifted\nUV absorption lines of Ly$\\alpha$, C IV, and N V, together with a new\nhigh-ionisation component producing Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines. In\nsoft X-rays, only narrow emission lines stand out above the diminished\ncontinuum as they are not absorbed by the obscurer. Our analysis shows that the\nobscurer partially covers the central source with a column density of few\n$10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, outflowing with a velocity of few thousand km s$^{-1}$.\nThe obscuration in NGC 3783 is variable and lasts for about a month. Unlike the\ncommonly-seen warm-absorber winds at pc-scale distances from the black hole,\nthe eclipsing wind in NGC 3783 is located at about 10 light days. Our results\nsuggest the obscuration is produced by an inhomogeneous and clumpy medium,\nconsistent with clouds in the base of a radiatively-driven disk wind at the\nouter broad-line region of the AGN.\n", "  We consider an anomaly-free $U(1)'$ model with favorable couplings to heavy\nflavors in the Standard Model(SM), as motivated by $B$-meson anomalies at LHCb.\nTaking the $U(1)'$ charge to be $Q'=y(L_\\mu-L_\\tau)+ x(B_3-L_3)$, we can\nexplain the $B$-meson anomalies without invoking extra charged fermions or\nflavor violation beyond the SM. We show that there is a viable parameter space\nwith a small $x$ that is compatible with other meson decays, tau lepton and\nneutrino experiments as well as the LHC dimuon searches. We briefly discuss the\nprospects of discovering the $Z'$ gauge boson at the LHC in the proposed model.\n", "  Single nanoparticle tracking using optical microscopy is a powerful technique\nwith many applications in biology, chemistry and material sciences. Despite\nsignificant advances, localising objects with nanometric position accuracy in a\nscattering environment remains challenging. Applied methods to achieve contrast\nare dominantly fluorescence based, with fundamental limits in the emitted\nphoton fluxes arising from the excited-state lifetime as well as\nphotobleaching. Furthermore, every localisation method reported to date\nrequires signal acquisition from multiple spatial points, with consequent speed\nlimitations. Here, we show a new four-wave mixing interferometry technique,\nwhereby the position of a single non-fluorescing gold nanoparticle is\ndetermined with better than 20 nm accuracy in plane and 1 nm axially from rapid\nsingle-point acquisition measurements by exploiting optical vortices. The\ntechnique is also uniquely sensitive to particle asymmetries of only 0.5%\naspect ratio, corresponding to a single atomic layer of gold, as well as\nparticle orientation, and the detection is background-free even inside\nbiological cells. This method opens new ways of of unraveling single-particle\ntrafficking within complex 3D architectures.\n", "  We establish and elucidate the physical meaning of the appearance of an\nacausal mode in the sigma mesonic channel, found in the previous work by the\npresent authors, when the system approaches the $\\mathrm{Z}_{2}$ critical\npoint. The functional renormalization group method is applied to the\ntwo--flavor quark--meson model with varying current quark mass $m_q$ even away\nfrom the physical value at which the pion mass is reproduced. We first\ndetermine the whole phase structure in the three-dimensional space $(T, \\mu,\nm_q)$ consisting of temperature $T$, quark chemical potential $\\mu$ and $m_q$,\nwith the tricritical point, $\\mathrm{O}(4)$ and $\\mathrm{Z}_{2}$ critical lines\nbeing located; they altogether make a wing-like shape quite reminiscent of\nthose known in the condensed matters with a tricritical point. We then\ncalculate the spectral functions $\\rho_{\\sigma, \\pi}(\\omega, p)$ in the scalar\nand pseudoscalar channel around the critical points. We find that the sigma\nmesonic mode becomes tachyonic with a superluminal velocity at finite momenta\nbefore the system reaches the $\\mathrm{Z}_{2}$ point from the lower density,\neven for $m_q$ smaller than the physical value. One of the possible\nimplications of the appearance of such a tachyonic mode at finite momenta is\nthat the assumed equilibrium state with a uniform chiral condensate is unstable\ntoward a state with an inhomogeneous $\\sigma$ condensate. No such an anomalous\nbehavior is found in the pseudoscalar channel. We find that the\n$\\sigma$-to-$2\\sigma$ coupling due to finite $m_q$ play an essential role for\nthe drastic modification of the spectral function.\n", "  Global string networks may be relevant in axion production in the early\nUniverse, as well as other cosmological scenarios. Such networks contain a\nlarge hierarchy of scales between the string core scale and the Hubble scale,\nlog(f/H) around 70, which influences the network dynamics by giving the strings\nlarge tensions T = pi f^2 log(f/H). We present a new numerical approach to\nsimulate such global string networks, capturing the tension without an\nexponentially large lattice.\n", "  The average density of states of two- and three-dimensional Weyl fermions is\nstudied in the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) and its corrections.\nThe latter have been organized in terms of a 1/N expansion. It turns out that\nan expansion in terms of the disorder strength is not applicable, as previously\nmentioned by other authors. Nevertheless, the 1/N expansion provides a\njustification of the SCBA as the large N limit of Weyl fermions.\n", "  LOFAR detected toward 3C 196 linear polarization structures which were found\nsubsequently to be closely correlated with cold filamentary HI structures. The\nderived direction-dependent HI power spectra revealed marked anisotropies for\nnarrow ranges in velocity, sharing the orientation of the magnetic field as\nexpected for magneto hydrodynamical turbulence. Using the Galactic portion of\nthe Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey we continue our study of such anisotropies in the\nHI distribution in direction of two WSRT fields, Horologium and Auriga; both\nare well known for their prominent radio-polarimetric depolarization canals. At\n349 MHz the observed pattern in total intensity is insignificant but polarized\nintensity and polarization angle show prominent ubiquitous structures with so\nfar unknown origin. Apodizing the HI survey data by applying a rotational\nsymmetric 50 percent Tukey window, we derive average and position angle\ndependent power spectra. We fit power laws and characterize anisotropies in the\npower distribution. We use a Gaussian analysis to determine relative abundances\nfor the cold and warm neutral medium. For the analyzed radio-polarimetric\ntargets significant anisotropies are detected in the HI power spectra; their\nposition angles are aligned to the prominent depolarization canals, initially\ndetected by WSRT. HI anisotropies are associated with steep power spectra.\nSteep power spectra, associated with cold gas, are detected also in other\nfields. Radio-polarimetric depolarization canals are associated with\nfilamentary HI structures that belong to the cold neutral medium (CNM).\nAnisotropies in the CNM are in this case linked to a steepening of the\npower-spectrum spectral index, indicating that phase transitions in a turbulent\nmedium occur on all scales. Filamentary HI structures, driven by thermal\ninstabilities, and radio-polarimetric filaments are associated with each other.\n", "  The recently discovered material PtSn$_4$ is known to exhibit extremely large\nmagnetoresistance (XMR) that also manifests Dirac arc nodes on the surface.\nPdSn$_4$ is isostructure to PtSn$_4$ with same electron count. We report on the\nphysical properties of high quality single crystals of PdSn$_4$ including\nspecific heat, temperature and magnetic field dependent resistivity and\nmagnetization, and electronic band structure properties obtained from angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We observe that PdSn$_4$ has\nphysical properties that are qualitatively similar to those of PtSn$_4$, but\nfind also pronounced differences. Importantly, the Dirac arc node surface state\nof PtSn$_4$ is gapped out for PdSn$_4$. By comparing these similar compounds,\nwe address the origin of the extremely large magnetoresistance in PdSn$_4$ and\nPtSn$_4$; based on detailed analysis of the magnetoresistivity, $\\rho(H,T)$, we\nconclude that neither carrier compensation nor the Dirac arc node surface state\nare primary reason for the extremely large magnetoresistance. On the other\nhand, we find that surprisingly Kohler's rule scaling of the\nmangnetoresistance, which describes a self-similarity of the field induced\norbital electronic motion across different length scales and is derived for a\nsimple electronic response of metals to applied in a magnetic field is obeyed\nover the full range of temperatures and field strengths that we explore.\n", "  The shape of a drop pinned in a local equilibrium on an incline is a\nlong-standing problem. The substrate can be homogeneous or heterogeneous and we\nherewith consider a drop pinned on an incline at the junction between a\nhydrophilic half-plane (the top half) and a hydropho-bic one (the bottom half).\nRelying on the equilibrium equations deriving from the balance of forces, we\nexhibit three scenarii depending on the way the contact line of the drop on the\nsubstrate either simply leans against the junction or overfills (partly or\nfully) the hydrophobic side. We draw some conclusions on the geometry of the\noverlap and the stability of these tentative equilibrium states. In the\ncorresponding retention force factor, we find that a major role is played by\nthe wetted length of the junction line. The predictions of the theory are\nillustrated and supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations.\n", "  We study the energy transfer properties of three dimensional homogeneous and\nisotropic turbulence where the non-linear transfer is altered in a way that\nhelicity is made sign-definite, say positive. In this framework, known as\nhomochiral turbulence, an adapted eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM)\nclosure is derived to analyze the dynamics at very large Reynolds numbers, of\norder $10^5$ based on the Taylor scale. In agreement with previous findings, an\ninverse cascade of energy with a kinetic energy spectrum like $\\propto\nk^{-5/3}$ is found for scales larger than the forcing one. Conjointly, a\nforward cascade of helicity towards larger wavenumbers is obtained, where the\nkinetic energy spectrum scales like $\\propto k^{-7/3}$. By following the\nevolution of the closed spectral equations for a very long time and over a huge\nextensions of scales, we found the developing of a non monotonic shape for the\nfront of the inverse energy flux. The very long time evolution of the kinetic\nenergy and integral scale in both the forced and unforced cases is analyzed\nalso.\n", "  We reconsider the renormalizability of topological Yang-Mills field theories\nin (anti-)self-dual Landau gauges. By employing algebraic renormalization\ntechniques we show that there is only one independent renormalization.\nMoreover, due to the rich set of Ward identities, we are able to obtain some\nimportant exact features of the (connected and one-particle irreducible)\ntwo-point functions. Specifically, we show that all two-point functions are\ntree-level exact.\n", "  We present the results of a recent analysis to study the nucleon's charm\nsigma term, $\\sigma_{c\\overline{c}}$. We construct a minimal model in terms of\nlight-front variables and constrain the range of possibilities using extant\nknowledge from deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) and Bayesian parameter\nestimation, ultimately computing $\\sigma_{c\\overline{c}}$ in an explicitly\ncovariant manner. We find a close correlation between a possible\nnonperturbative component of the charm structure function,\n$F^{c\\overline{c}}_{2,\\, \\mathrm{IC}}$, and $\\sigma_{c\\overline{c}}$.\nIndependent of prescription for the covariant relativistic quark-nucleon\nvertex, we determine $\\sigma_{c\\overline{c}}$ under several different scenarios\nfor the magnitude of intrinsic charm (IC) in DIS, namely $\\langle x\n\\rangle_{c+\\overline{c}} = 0.1\\%$, $0.35\\%$, and $1\\%$, obtaining for these\n$\\sigma_{c\\overline{c}} = 4 \\pm 4$, $12 \\pm 13$, and $32 \\pm 34$ MeV,\nrespectively. These results imply the existence of a reciprocity between the IC\nparton distribution function (PDF) and $\\sigma_{c\\overline{c}}$ such that new\ninformation from either DIS or improved determinations of $\\sigma_{c\n\\overline{c}}$ could significantly impact constraints to the charm sector of\nthe proton wave function.\n", "  Context: Long-term variability in solar cycles represents a challenging\nconstraint for theoretical models. Mean-field Babcock-Leighton dynamos that\nconsider non-instantaneous rising flux tubes have been shown to exhibit\nlong-term variability in their magnetic cycle. However a relation that\nparameterizes the rise-time of non-axisymmetric magnetic flux tubes in terms of\nstellar parameters is still missing. Aims: We aim to find a general\nparameterization of the rise-time of magnetic flux tubes for solar-like stars.\nMethods: By considering the influence of magnetic tension on the rise of\nnon-axisymmetric flux tubes, we predict the existence of a control parameter\nreferred as $\\Gamma_{\\alpha_1}^{\\alpha_2}$. This parameter is a measure of the\nbalance between rotational effects and magnetic effects (buoyancy and tension)\nacting on the magnetic flux tube. We carry out two series of numerical\nexperiments (one for axisymmetric rise and one for non-axisymmetric rise) and\ndemonstrate that $\\Gamma_{\\alpha_1}^{\\alpha_2}$ indeed controls the rise-time\nof magnetic flux tubes. Results: We find that the rise-time follows a power law\nof $\\Gamma_{\\alpha_1}^{\\alpha_2}$ with an exponent that depends on the\nazimuthal wavenumber of the magnetic flux loop. Conclusions: Compressibility\ndoes not impact the rise of magnetic flux tubes, while non-axisymmetry does. In\nthe case of non-axisymmetric rise, the tension force modifies the force balance\nacting on the magnetic flux tube. We identified the three independent\nparameters required to predict the rise-time of magnetic flux tubes, that is,\nthe stellar rotation rate, the magnetic flux density of the flux tube, and its\nazimuthal wavenumber. We combined these into one single relation that is valid\nfor any solar-like star. We suggest using this generalized relation to\nconstrain the rise-time of magnetic flux tubes in Babcock-Leighton dynamo\nmodels.\n", "  In this study we follow Grossmann and Lohse, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 (2001), who\nderived various scalings regimes for the dependence of the Nusselt number $Nu$\nand the Reynolds number $Re$ on the Rayleigh number $Ra$ and the Prandtl number\n$Pr$. We focus on theoretical arguments as well as on numerical simulations for\nthe case of large-$Pr$ natural thermal convection. Based on an analysis of\nself-similarity of the boundary layer equations, we derive that in this case\nthe limiting large-$Pr$ boundary-layer dominated regime is I$_\\infty^<$,\nintroduced and defined in [1], with the scaling relations $Nu\\sim\nPr^0\\,Ra^{1/3}$ and $Re\\sim Pr^{-1}\\,Ra^{2/3}$. Our direct numerical\nsimulations for $Ra$ from $10^4$ to $10^9$ and $Pr$ from 0.1 to 200 show that\nthe regime I$_\\infty^<$ is almost indistinguishable from the regime\nIII$_\\infty$, where the kinetic dissipation is bulk-dominated. With increasing\n$Ra$, the scaling relations undergo a transition to those in IV$_u$ of\nreference [1], where the thermal dissipation is determined by its bulk\ncontribution.\n", "  In this work we present a uniform analysis of the temperature evolution and\nbolometric luminosity of a sample of 29 type-II supernovae (SNe), by fitting a\nblack body model to their multi-band photometry. Our sample includes only SNe\nwith high quality multi-band data and relatively well sampled time coverage.\nMost of the SNe in our sample were detected less than a week after explosion so\ntheir light curves cover the evolution both before and after recombination\nstarts playing a role. We use this sample to study the signature of hydrogen\nrecombination, which is expected to appear once the observed temperature drops\nto $\\approx 7,000$K. Theory predicts that before recombination starts affecting\nthe light curve, both the luminosity and the temperature should drop relatively\nfast, following a power-law in time. Once the recombination front reaches inner\nparts of the outflow, it sets the observed temperature to be nearly constant,\nand slows the decline of the luminosity (or even leads to a re-brightening). We\ncompare our data to analytic studies and find strong evidence for the signature\nof recombination. We also find that the onset of the optical plateau in a given\nfilter, is effectively the time at which the black body peak reaches the\ncentral wavelength of the filter, as it cools, and it does not correspond to\nthe time at which recombination starts affecting the emission.\n", "  We explore the limits on lepton-flavor universality (LFU) violation in\ntheories where the hierarchy problem is solved by means of a warped extra\ndimension. In those theories LFU violation, in fermion interaction with\nKaluza-Klein modes of gauge bosons, is provided ab initio when different flavor\nof fermions are differently localized along the extra dimension. As this fact\narises from the mass pattern of quarks and leptons, LFU violation is natural in\nthis class of theories. We analyze the experimental data pointing towards LFU\nviolation, as well as the most relevant electroweak and flavor observables, and\nthe LFU tests in the $\\mu/e$ and $\\tau/\\mu$ sectors. We find agreement with\n$R_{K^{(\\ast)}}$ and $R_{D^{(\\ast)}}$ data at 95% CL, provided the third\ngeneration left-handed fermions are composite ($0.14 < c_{b_L} < 0.28$ and\n$0.27 < c_{\\tau_L} < 0.33$), and find the absolute limits\n$R_{K^{(\\ast)}}\\gtrsim 0.79$ and $R_{D^{(\\ast)}}/R_{D^{(\\ast)}}^{\\rm\nSM}\\lesssim 1.13$. Moreover we predict $\\mathcal B( B\\to K\\nu\\bar\\nu)\\gtrsim\n1.14\\times 10^{-5}$ at 95% CL, smaller than the present experimental upper\nbound but a few times larger than the Standard Model prediction.\n", "  The realization of topological superconductors (SCs) in one or two dimensions\nis a highly pursued goal. Prominent proposed realization schemes include\nsemiconductor/superconductor heterostructures and set stringent constraints on\nthe chemical potential of the system. However, the ability to keep the chemical\npotential in the required range while in the presence of an adjacent SC and its\naccompanied screening effects, is a great experimental challenge. In this work,\nwe study a SC lattice structure in which the SC is deposited periodically on a\none- or two-dimensional sample. We demonstrate that this realization platform\novercomes the challenge of controlling the chemical potential in the presence\nof the superconductor's electrostatic screening. We show how Majorana bound\nstates emerge at the ends of a one-dimensional system proximity coupled to a\none-dimensional SC lattice, and move on to present a SC-lattice-based\nrealization of the two-dimensional px+ipy SC, hosting chiral Majorana modes at\nits edges. In particular, we establish that even when assuming the worst case\nof absolute screening, in which the chemical potential under the SC is\ncompletely unaffected by the external gate potential, the topological phase can\nbe reached by tuning the chemical potential in the area not covered by the SC.\nFinally, we briefly discuss possible effects of Coulomb blockade on the\nproperties of the system.\n", "  In this work we explore the effects of a weak magnetic field and a thermal\nbath on the decay process of a neutral scalar boson into two charged scalar\nbosons. Our findings indicate that magnetic field inhibits while temperature\nenhances the pair production. The employed formalism allows us to isolate the\ncontribution of magnetic fields in vacuum, leading to a separate analysis of\nthe effects of different ingredients. This is essential since the analytical\ncomputation of the decay width necessarily needs of some approximation and the\nresults that can be found in the literature are not always coincident. We\nperform the calculation in vacuum by two different weak field approximations.\nThe particle pair production in vacuum was found to coincide with finite\ntemperature behavior, which is opposite to results obtained by other authors in\nscenarios that involve neutral particles decaying into a pair of charged\nfermions. Among other differences between these scenarios, we traced that the\nanalytical structure of the self-energy imposed by the spin of particles\ninvolved in the process is determinant in the behavior of the decay rate with\nthe magnetic field.\n", "  The coupling between a 2D semiconductor quantum well and an optical cavity\ngives rise to combined light-matter excitations, the exciton-polaritons. These\nwere usually measured when the conduction band is empty, making the single\npolariton physics a simple single-body problem. The situation is dramatically\ndifferent in the presence of a finite conduction band population, where the\ncreation or annihilation of a single exciton involves a many-body shakeup of\nthe Fermi sea. Recent experiments in this regime revealed a strong modification\nof the exciton-polariton spectrum. Previous theoretical studies concerned with\nnonzero Fermi energy mostly relied on the approximation of an immobile valence\nband hole with infinite mass, which is appropriate for low-mobility samples\nonly; for high-mobility samples, one needs to consider a mobile hole with large\nbut finite mass. To bridge this gap we present an analytical diagrammatic\napproach and tackle a model with short-ranged (screened) electron-hole\ninteraction, studying it in two complementary regimes. We find that the finite\nhole mass has opposite effects on the exciton-polariton spectra in the two\nregimes: In the first, where the Fermi energy is much smaller than the exciton\nbinding energy, excitonic features are enhanced by the finite mass. In the\nsecond regime, where the Fermi energy is much larger than the exciton binding\nenergy, finite mass effects cut off the excitonic features in the polariton\nspectra, in qualitative agreement with recent experiments.\n", "  We present the development of the extended Skyrme N2LO pseudo-potential in\nthe case of spherical even-even nuclei calculations. The energy density\nfunctional is first presented. Then we derive the mean-field equations and\ndiscuss the numerical method used to solve the resulting fourth-order\ndifferential equation together with the behaviour of the solutions at the\norigin. Finally, a fitting procedure for such a N2LO interaction is discussed\nand we provide a first parametrization. Typical ground-state observables are\ncalculated and compared against experimental data.\n", "  The irreversible turbulent energy cascade epitomizes strongly non-equilibrium\nsystems. At the level of single fluid particles, time irreversibility is\nrevealed by the asymmetry of the rate of kinetic energy change, the Lagrangian\npower, whose moments display a power-law dependence on the Reynolds number, as\nrecently shown by Xu et al. [H. Xu et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 111,\n7558 (2014)]. Here Lagrangian power statistics are rationalized within the\nmultifractal model of turbulence, whose predictions are shown to agree with\nnumerical and empirical data. Multifractal predictions are also tested, for\nvery large Reynolds numbers, in dynamical models of the turbulent cascade,\nobtaining remarkably good agreement for statistical quantities insensitive to\nthe asymmetry and, remarkably, deviations for those probing the asymmetry.\nThese findings raise fundamental questions concerning time irreversibility in\nthe infinite-Reynolds-number limit of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n", "  The sectorized description of the (chiral) heterotic string using pure\nspinors has been misleadingly viewed as an infinite tension string. One\nevidence for this fact comes from the tree level 3-point graviton amplitude,\nwhich we show to contain the usual Einstein term plus a higher curvature\ncontribution. After reintroducing a dimensionful parameter $\\ell$ in the\ntheory, we demonstrate that the heterotic model is in fact two-fold, depending\non the choice of the supersymmetric sector, and that the spectrum also contains\none massive (open string like) multiplet. By taking the $\\ell\\to\\infty$ limit,\nwe finally show that the ambitwistor string is recovered, reproducing the\nunexpected heterotic state in Mason and Skinner's RNS description.\n", "  We study theoretically the spin-induced and photon-induced fluctuations of\noptical signals from a singly-charged quantum dot-microcavity structure. We\nidentify the respective contributions of the photon-polariton interactions, in\nthe strong light-matter coupling regime, and of the quantum back-action induced\nby photon detection on the spin system. Strong spin projection by a single\nphoton is shown to be achievable, allowing the initialization and measurement\nof a fully-polarized Larmor precession. The spectrum of second-order\ncorrelations is deduced, displaying information on both spin and quantum\ndot-cavity dynamics. The presented theory thus bridges the gap between the\nfields of spin noise spectroscopy and quantum optics.\n", "  We study quantum states generated by a sequence of nearest neighbor bipartite\nentangling operations along a one-dimensional chain of spin qubits. After a\nsingle sweep of such a set of operations, the system is effectively described\nby a matrix product state (MPS) with the same virtual dimension as the spin\nqubits. We employ the explicit form of the MPS to calculate expectation values\nand two-site correlation functions of local observables, and we use the results\nto study fluctuations of collective observables. Through the so-called\nmacroscopicity and the squeezing properties of the collective spin variables\nthey witness the quantum correlations and multi-particle entanglement within\nthe chain. Macroscopicity only occurs over the entire chain if the nearest\nneighbor interaction is maximally entangling, while a finite, sequential\ninteraction between nearest neighbor particles leads to squeezing of the\ncollective spin.\n", "  We have investigated the shadow of a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr\nblack hole with an extra deformation parameter. The spacetime structure arising\nfrom the deformed parameter affects sharply the black hole shadow. With the\nincrease of the deformation parameter, the size of the shadow of black hole\nincrease and its shape becomes more rounded for arbitrary rotation parameter.\nThe D-shape shadow of black hole emerges only in the case\n$a<\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}M$ with the proper deformation parameter. Especially, the\nblack hole shadow possesses a cusp shape with small eye lashes in the cases\nwith $a>M$, and the shadow becomes less cuspidal with the increase of the\ndeformation parameter. Our result show that the presence of the deformation\nparameter yields a series of significant patterns for the shadow casted by a\nKonoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole.\n", "  The electromagnetic properties of the tetraquark state $Z_c(3900)$ are\ninvestigated in the diquark-antidiquark picture and its magnetic and quadrupole\nmoments are extracted. To this end, the light-cone QCD sum rule in\nelectromagnetic background field is used. The magnetic and quadrupole moments\nencode the spatial distributions of the charge and magnetization in the\nparticle. The result obtained for the magnetic moment is quite large and can be\nmeasured in future experiments. We obtain a nonzero but small value for the\nquadrupole moment of $Zc(3900)$ indicating a nonspherical charge distribution.\n", "  We construct a relation between the Aretakis charge of any extreme black hole\nand the Newman-Penrose charge. This is achieved by constructing a conformal\ncorrespondence between extreme black holes and what we call weakly\nasymptotically flat space-times. Under this correspondence the Newman-Penrose\ncharge of the weakly asymptotically flat space-time maps on to the Aretakis\ncharge of the extreme black hole. Furthermore, we generalise the conformal\nisometry displayed by the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution to a novel\nconformal symmetry that acts within a class of static STU supergravity black\nholes.\n", "  In this paper we continue our program of computing Casimir self-entropies of\nidealized electrical bodies. Here we consider an electromagnetic\n$\\delta$-function sphere (\"semitransparent sphere\") whose electric\nsusceptibility has a transverse polarization with arbitrary strength.\nDispersion is incorporated by a plasma-like model. In the strong coupling\nlimit, a perfectly conducting spherical shell is realized. We compute the\nentropy for both low and high temperatures. The TE self-entropy is negative as\nexpected, but the TM self-entropy requires ultraviolet and infrared\nsubtractions, and, surprisingly, is only positive for sufficiently strong\ncoupling. Results are robust under different regularization schemes.\n", "  APOGEE-2 is a high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopic survey observing\nroughly 300,000 stars across the entire sky. It is the successor to APOGEE and\nis part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). APOGEE-2 is expanding\nupon APOGEE's goals of addressing critical questions of stellar astrophysics,\nstellar populations, and Galactic chemodynamical evolution using (1) an\nenhanced set of target types and (2) a second spectrograph at Las Campanas\nObservatory in Chile. APOGEE-2 is targeting red giant branch (RGB) and red\nclump (RC) stars, RR Lyrae, low-mass dwarf stars, young stellar objects, and\nnumerous other Milky Way and Local Group sources across the entire sky from\nboth hemispheres. In this paper, we describe the APOGEE-2 observational design,\ntarget selection catalogs and algorithms, and the targeting-related\ndocumentation included in the SDSS data releases.\n", "  We describe a method of reconstructing air showers induced by cosmic rays\nusing deep learning techniques. We simulate an observatory consisting of\nground-based particle detectors with fixed locations on a regular grid. The\ndetector's responses to traversing shower particles are signal amplitudes as a\nfunction of time, which provide information on transverse and longitudinal\nshower properties. In order to take advantage of convolutional network\ntechniques specialized in local pattern recognition, we convert all information\nto the image-like grid of the detectors. In this way, multiple features, such\nas arrival times of the first particles and optimized characterizations of time\ntraces, are processed by the network. The reconstruction quality of the cosmic\nray arrival direction turns out to be competitive with an analytic\nreconstruction algorithm. The reconstructed shower direction, energy and shower\ndepth show the expected improvement in resolution for higher cosmic ray energy.\n", "  A large fraction of giant planets have gaseous envelopes that are limited to\nabout 10 % of their total mass budget. Such planets are present in the Solar\nSystem (Uranus, Neptune) and are frequently observed in short periods around\nother stars (the so-called Super-Earths). In contrast to these observations,\ntheoretical calculations based on the evolution of hydrostatic envelopes argue\nthat such low mass envelopes cannot be maintained around cores exceeding five\nEarth masses. Instead, under nominal disc conditions, these planets would\nacquire massive envelopes through runaway gas accretion within the lifetime of\nthe protoplanetary disc. In this work, we show that planetary envelopes are not\nin hydrostatic balance, which slows down envelope growth. A series of\n3-dimensional, global, radiative hydrodynamical simulations reveal a steady\nstate gas flow, which enters through the poles and exits in the disc midplane.\nGas is pushed through the outer envelope in about 10 orbital timescales. In\nregions of the disc that are not significantly dust-depleted, envelope\naccretion onto cores of about five Earth masses can get stalled as the gas flow\nenters the deep interior. Accreted solids sublimate deep in the convective\ninterior, but small opacity-providing grains are trapped in the flow and do not\nsettle, which further prevents rapid envelope accretion. The transition to\nrunaway gas accretion can however be reached when cores grow larger than\ntypical Super-Earths, beyond 15 Earth masses, and preferably when disc\nopacities are below kappa=1 cm^2/g. These findings offer an explanation for the\ntypical low-mass envelopes around the cores of Super-Earths.\n", "  We present radio observations of the galaxy cluster PLCK G004.5-19.5\n($z=0.52$) using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 150~MHz, 325~MHz, and\n610~MHz. We find an unusual arrangement of diffuse radio emission in the center\nand periphery of the cluster, as well as several radio galaxies with head-tail\nemission. A patch of peripheral emission resembles a radio relic, and central\nemission resembles a radio halo. Reanalysis of archival XMM-Newton X-ray data\nshows that PLCK G004.5-19.5 is disturbed, which has a known correlation with\nthe existence of radio relics and halos. Given that the number of known radio\nhalos and radio relics at $z>0.5$ is very limited, PLCK G004.5-19.5 is an\nimportant addition to understanding merger-related particle acceleration at\nhigher redshifts.\n", "  In this short paper we outline a recipe for the reconstruction of $F(R)$\ngravity starting from single field inflationary potentials in the Einstein\nframe. For simple potentials one can compute the explicit form of $F(R)$,\nwhilst for more involved examples one gets a parametric form of $F(R)$. The\n$F(R)$ reconstruction algorithm is used to study various examples: power-law\n$\\phi^n$, exponential and $\\alpha$-attractors. In each case it is seen that for\nlarge $R$ (corresponding to large value of inflaton field), $F(R) \\sim R^2$.\nFor the case of $\\alpha$-attractors $F(R) \\sim R^2$ for all values of inflaton\nfield (for all values of $R$) as $\\alpha\\to0$. For generic inflaton potential\n$V(\\phi)$, it is seen that if $V^\\prime/V \\to0$ (for some $\\phi$) then the\ncorresponding $F(R) \\sim R^2$. We then study $\\alpha$-attractors in more detail\nusing non-perturbative renormalisation group methods to analyse the\nreconstructed $F(R)$. It is seen that $\\alpha\\to0$ is an ultraviolet stable\nfixed point of the renormalisation group trajectories.\n", "  Consider a dynamic general relativistic spacetime in which the proper\ninfinitesimal interval along one spatial coordinate direction decreases\nmonotonically with time, while the corresponding intervals increase along other\nspatial directions. In a system undergoing such complete anisotropic\ncollapse/expansion, we look for the formation of a cosmic double-jet\nconfiguration: free test particles in the ambient medium, relative to the\ncollapsing system, gain energy from the gravitational field and asymptotically\nline up parallel and antiparallel to the direction of collapse such that their\nLorentz factors approach infinity. A strong burst of electromagnetic radiation\nis expected to accompany this event if some of the free test particles carry\nelectric charge. Previous work in this direction involved mainly Ricci-flat\nspacetimes; hence, we concentrate here on inhomogeneous perfect fluid\nspacetimes. We briefly explore the possible connection between these\ntheoretical cosmic jets and astrophysical jets. We also discuss other general\nrelativistic scenarios for the formation of cosmic jets.\n", "  The inclusive diffractive quarkonium photoproduction in $pp$ and $pA$\ncollisions is investigated considering the Resolved Pomeron Model to describe\nthe diffractive interaction. We estimate the rapidity and transverse momentum\ndistributions for the $J/\\Psi$, $\\Psi(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon$ photoproduction in\nhadronic collisions at the LHC and present our estimate for the total cross\nsections at the Run 2 energies. A comparison with the predictions associated to\nthe exclusive production also is presented. Our results indicate that the\ninclusive diffractive production is a factor $\\gtrsim 10$ smaller than the\nexclusive one in the kinematical range probed by the LHC.\n", "  We study the imprints of a massive spin-2 field on inflationary observables,\nand in particular on the breaking of consistency relations. In this setup, the\nminimal inflationary field content interacts with the massive spin-2 field\nthrough dRGT interactions, thus guaranteeing the absence of Boulware-Deser\nghostly degrees of freedom. The unitarity requirement on spinning particles,\nknown as Higuchi bound, plays a crucial role for the size of the observable\nsignal.\n", "  Motivated by recent proposals of correlation induced insensitivity of d-wave\nsuperconductors to impurities, we develop a simple pairing theory for these\nsystems for up to a moderate strength of disorder. Our description implements\nthe key ideas of Anderson, originally proposed for disordered s-wave\nsuperconductors, but in addition takes care of the inherent strong electronic\nrepulsion in these compounds, as well as disorder induced inhomogeneities. We\nfirst obtain the self-consistent one-particle states, that capture the effects\nof disorder exactly, and strong correlations using Gutzwiller approximation.\nThese `normal states', representing the interplay of strong correlations and\ndisorder, when coupled through pairing attractions following the path of\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS), produce results nearly identical to those from\na more sophisticated Gutzwiller augmented Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis.\n", "  Carbon dioxide is abundant in ice mantles of dust grains; some is found in\nthe pure crystalline form as inferred from the double peak splitting of the\nbending profile at about 650 cm$^{-1}$. To study how CO$_2$ segregates into the\npure form from water-rich mixtures of ice mantles and how it then crystallizes,\nwe used Reflection Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy (RAIRS) to study the\nstructural change of pure CO$_2$ ice as a function of both ice thickness and\ntemperature. We found that the $\\nu_1+\\nu_3$ combination mode absorption\nprofile at 3708~cm$^{-1}$ provides an excellent probe to quantify the degree of\ncrystallinity in CO$_2$ ice. We also found that between 20 and 30~K, there is\nan ordering transition that we attribute to reorientation of CO$_2$ molecules,\nwhile the diffusion of CO$_2$ becomes significant at much higher temperatures.\nIn the formation of pure crystalline CO$_2$ in ISM ices, the rate limiting\nprocess is the diffusion/segregation of CO$_2$ molecules in the ice instead of\nthe phase transition from amorphous to crystalline after clusters/islands of\nCO$_2$ are formed.\n", "  The LAMOST survey has acquired low-resolution spectra (R=1,800) for 5 million\nstars across the Milky Way, far more than any current stellar survey at a\ncorresponding or higher spectral resolution. It is often assumed that only very\nfew elemental abundances can be measured from such low-resolution spectra,\nlimiting their utility for Galactic archaeology studies. However, Ting et al.\n(2017) used ab initio models to argue that low-resolution spectra should enable\nprecision measurements of many elemental abundances, at least in theory. Here\nwe verify this claim in practice by measuring the relative abundances of 14\nelements from LAMOST spectra with a precision of $\\lesssim$ 0.1 dex for objects\nwith ${\\rm S/N}_{\\rm LAMOST}$ > 30 (per pixel). We employ a spectral modeling\nmethod in which a data-driven model is combined with priors that the model\ngradient spectra should resemble ab initio spectral models. This approach\nassures that the data-driven abundance determinations draw on physically\nsensible features in the spectrum in their predictions and do not just exploit\nastrophysical correlations among abundances. Our analysis is constrained to the\nnumber of elemental abundances measured in the APOGEE survey, which is the\nsource of the training labels. Obtaining high quality/resolution spectra for a\nsubset of LAMOST stars to measure more elemental abundances as training labels\nand then applying this method to the full LAMOST catalog will provide a sample\nwith more than 20 elemental abundances that is an order of magnitude larger\nthan current high-resolution surveys, substantially increasing the sample size\nfor Galactic archaeology.\n", "  At the interface between two-dimensional materials with different topologies,\ntopologically protected one-dimensional states (also named as zero-line modes)\narise. Here, we focus on the quantum anomalous Hall effect based zero-line\nmodes formed at the interface between regimes with different Chern numbers. We\nfind that, these zero-line modes are chiral and unilaterally conductive due to\nthe breaking of time-reversal invariance. For a beam splitter consisting of two\nintersecting zero lines, the chirality ensures that current can only be\ninjected from two of the four terminals. Our numerical results further show\nthat, in the absence of contact resistance, the (anti-)clockwise partitions of\ncurrents from these two terminals are the same owing to the current\nconservation, which effectively simplifies the partition laws. We find that the\npartition is robust against relative shift of Fermi energy, but can be\neffectively adjusted by tuning the relative magnetization strengths at\ndifferent regimes or relative angles between zero lines.\n", "  The first principle lattice QCD methods allow to calculate the thermodynamic\nobservables at finite temperature and imaginary chemical potential. These can\nbe compared to the predictions of various phenomenological models. We argue\nthat Fourier coefficients with respect to imaginary baryochemical potential are\nsensitive to modeling of baryonic interactions. As a first application of this\nsensitivity, we consider the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model with repulsive\nbaryonic interactions, which are modeled by means of the excluded volume\ncorrection. The Fourier coefficients of the imaginary part of the net-baryon\ndensity at imaginary baryochemical potential -- corresponding to the fugacity\nor virial expansion at real chemical potential -- are calculated within this\nmodel, and compared with the $N_t = 12$ lattice data. The lattice QCD behavior\nof the first four Fourier coefficients up to $T \\simeq 185$ MeV is described\nfairly well by an interacting HRG with a single baryon-baryon eigenvolume\ninteraction parameter $b \\simeq 1$ fm$^3$, while the available lattice data on\nthe difference $\\chi_2^B - \\chi_4^B$ of baryon number susceptibilities is\nreproduced up to $T \\simeq 175$ MeV.\n", "  The smallness of neutrino mass, the strong CP problem, and the existence of\ndark matter are explained in an economical way. The neutrino mass is generated\nby the colored version of a radiative seesaw mechanism by using color adjoint\nmediators. The Majorana mass term of the adjoint fermion, which carries lepton\nnumber U(1)_L, is induced by its spontaneous breaking, resulting in a Majoron\nwhich doubles as the QCD (quantum chromodynamics) axion, thereby solving the\nstrong CP problem. The breaking of U(1)_L sets simultaneously the seesaw scale\nfor neutrino mass and the Peccei-Quinn breaking scale. This axion is a good\ncandidate for dark matter as usually assumed.\n", "  We investigate the interplay between confinement and the fermion doubling\nproblem in Dirac-like Hamiltonians. Individually, both features are well known.\nFirst, simple electrostatic gates do not confine electrons due to the Klein\ntunneling. Second, a typical lattice discretization of the first-order\nderivative $k \\rightarrow -i\\partial_x$ skips the central point and allow\nspurious low-energy, highly oscillating solutions known as fermion doublers.\nWhile a no-go theorem states that the doublers cannot be eliminated without\nartificially breaking a symmetry, here we show that the symmetry broken by the\nWilson's mass approach is equivalent to the enforcement of hard-wall boundary\nconditions, thus making the no-go theorem irrelevant when confinement is\nforeseen. We illustrate our arguments by calculating the following: (i) the\nband structure and transport properties across thin films of the topological\ninsulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$, for which we use ab-initio density functional theory\ncalculations to justify the model; and (ii) the band structure of zigzag\ngraphene nanoribbons.\n", "  A density functional study is presented of the interstitial Zn$_i$, Ge$_i$,\nand N$_i$ in ZnGeN$_2$. Corrections to the band gap are included by means of\nthe LDA+U method.\n  The Zn and Ge interstitials are both found to strongly prefer the larger\noctahedral site compared to the two types of tetrahedral sites.\n  The Zn interstitial is found to be a shallow double donor but has higher\nenergy than previously studied antisite defects. It has a resonance in the\nconduction band which is Zn-$s$ like.\n  The Ge interstitial is an even higher energy of formation defect and also\nbehaves as a shallow double donor but has also a deep level in the gap,\ncorresponding to a Ge-$s$ orbital character while the Ge-$p$ forms a resonance\nin the conduction band.\n  The nitrogen interstitial forms a split-interstitial configuration, as also\noccurs in GaN. Its electronic levels can be related to that of a N$_2$\nmolecule. The defect levels in the gap correspond to the $\\pi_g$-like lowest\nunoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the molecule, which here becomes filled\nwith 3 electrons in the defect's neutral charge state. They are found to prefer\na high-spin configuration in the $q=+1$ state.\n  The corresponding transition levels are obtained and show that this is an\namphoteric trap level occurring in $+2$, $+1$, 0 and $-1$ charge states. The\ntwo possible sites for this split interstitial, on top of Zn or on top of Ge\ndiffer slightly in N$_2$ bond-length. While the N$_i$ defects have the lowest\nformation energy among the interstitials, it is still higher than that of the\nantisites.\n  Hence they are not expected to occur in sufficient concentration to affect\nthe intrinsic Fermi level position. In particular, they do not contribute to\nthe unintentional n-type background doping.\n", "  We analyze a series of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical\nsimulations of magnetic reconnection in a model solar corona to study the\neffect of the guide field component on quasi-steady state interchange\nreconnection in a pseudostreamer arcade configuration. This work extends the\nanalysis of \\citet{Edmondson2010b} by quantifying the mass density enhancement\ncoherency scale in the current sheet associated with magnetic island formation\nduring the nonlinear phase of plasmoid-unstable reconnection. We compare the\nresults of four simulations of a zero, weak, moderate, and a strong guide\nfield, $B_{GF}/B_0 = \\lbrace 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 \\rbrace$, to quantify the\nplasmoid density enhancement's longitudinal and transverse coherency scales as\na function of the guide field strength. We derive these coherency scales from\nautocorrelation and wavelet analyses, and demonstrate how these scales may be\nused to interpret the density enhancement fluctuation's Fourier power spectra\nin terms of a structure formation range, an energy continuation range, and an\ninertial range---each population with a distinct spectral slope. We discuss the\nsimulation results in the context of solar and heliospheric observations of\npseudostreamer solar wind outflow and possible signatures of\nreconnection-generated structure.\n", "  We calculate the evolution and gravitational-wave emission of a spinning\ncompact object inspiraling into a substantially more massive (non-rotating)\nblack hole. We extend our previous model for a non-spinning binary [Phys. Rev.\nD 93, 064024] to include the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon spin-curvature force.\nFor spin-aligned binaries we calculate the dephasing of the inspiral and\nassociated waveforms relative to models that do not include spin-curvature\neffects. We find this dephasing can be either positive or negative depending on\nthe initial separation of the binary. For binaries in which the spin and\norbital angular momentum are not parallel, the orbital plane precesses and we\nuse a more general osculating element prescription to compute inspirals.\n", "  We investigate the Hamiltonian structure of a class of gravitational theories\nwhose actions are linear in the lapse function. We derive the necessary and\nsufficient condition for a theory in this class to have two or less local\nphysical degrees of freedom. As an application we then find several concrete\nexamples of modified gravity theories in which the total number of local\nphysical degrees of freedom in the gravity sector is two.\n", "  We consider various forms of action allowing us to describe a perfect fluid\nin the framework of General Relativity. First we consider a potential motion\nwithout pressure. Starting from an action in terms of the current density\nvector built similarly to the action of a single particle, we build a series of\nequivalent actions through various changes of variables. The results are then\ngeneralized to the cases of motion with vorticity and the presence of pressure.\nThe obtained forms of action are compared to the previously known variants. We\ndiscuss the possibilities to use the obtained results to formulate the theories\ncontaining a description of a perfect fluid. A new form of action is proposed\nfor mimetic gravity, which allows a motion with vorticity for mimetic matter as\na perfect fluid.\n", "  We present a finite-temperature extension of the retarded cumulant Green's\nfunction for calculations of exited-state and thermodynamic properties of\nelectronic systems. The method incorporates a cumulant to leading order in the\nscreened Coulomb interaction $W$ and improves excited state properties compared\nto the $GW$ approximation of many-body perturbation theory. Results for the\nhomogeneous electron gas are presented for a wide range of densities and\ntemperatures, from cool to warm dense matter regime, which reveal several\nhitherto unexpected properties. For example, correlation effects remain strong\nat high $T$ while the exchange-correlation energy becomes small. In addition,\nthe spectral function broadens and damping increases with temperature, blurring\nthe usual quasi-particle picture. Similarly Compton scattering exhibits\nsubstantial many-body corrections that persist at normal densities and\nintermediate $T$. Results for exchange-correlation energies and potentials are\nin good agreement with existing theories and finite-temperature DFT\nfunctionals.\n", "  The thermoelectric transport coefficients are calculated in a generic lattice\nmodel of multi-Weyl semimetals with a broken time-reversal symmetry by using\nthe Kubo's linear response theory. The contributions connected with the Berry\ncurvature-induced electromagnetic orbital and heat magnetizations are\nsystematically taken into account. It is shown that the thermoelectric\ntransport is profoundly affected by the nontrivial topology of multi-Weyl\nsemimetals. In particular, the calculation reveals a number of thermal\ncoefficients of the topological origin which describe the anomalous Nernst and\nthermal Hall effects in the absence of background magnetic fields. Similarly to\nthe anomalous Hall effect, all anomalous thermoelectric coefficients are\nproportional to the integer topological charge of the Weyl nodes. The\ndependence of the thermoelectric coefficients on the chemical potential and\ntemperature is also studied.\n", "  Context. Understanding the close relationship between the plasma and the\nmagnetic field is important to describe and explain the observed complex\ndynamics of solar prominences. Aims. We determine if a close relationship\nbetween plasma and magnetic field parameters measured in a well-observed solar\nprominence with high spatial resolution can be found. Methods. We select a\nprominence observed on 15 July 2014 from space (IRIS, Hinode, SDO) and from the\nground (THEMIS). We perform a robust co-alignment of the data sets using a 2D\ncross-correlation technique. We derive the magnetic field parameters from\nspectropolarimetric measurements of the He I D3 line taken by THEMIS. Line\nratios and line-of-sight velocities from the Mg II h and k lines observed by\nIRIS are compared with magnetic field strength, inclination and azimuth.\nElectron densities are calculated using Hinode/EIS Fe XII line ratios and also\ncompared with THEMIS and IRIS data. Results. We find Mg II k/h ratios of around\n1.4 everywhere, similar to values found previously in prominences. We also find\nthat the magnetic field is strongest (around 30 G) and predominantly horizontal\nin the tornado-like legs of the prominence. The k3 Doppler shift is found to be\nbetween +/- 10 km/s everywhere. Electron densities at a temperature of 1.5e6 K\nare found to be around 1e9 /cm3. No significant correlations are found between\nthe magnetic field parameters, and any of the other plasma parameters inferred\nfrom EUV spectroscopy, which may be explained by the large differences in the\ntemperatures of the lines used in this study. Conclusions. This is the first\ntime that a detailed statistical study of plasma and magnetic field parameters\nhas been carried out at high spatial resolution in a prominence. Our results\nprovide important constraints on future models of the plasma and magnetic field\nin these structures.\n", "  Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are found predominantly in dwarf galaxies,\nindicating that their progenitors have a low metallicity. However, the most\nnearby SLSN to date, SN 2017egm, occurred in the spiral galaxy NGC 3191, which\nhas a relatively high stellar mass and correspondingly high metallicity. In\nthis paper, we present detailed analysis of the nearby environment of SN\n2017egm using MaNGA IFU data, which provides spectral data on kiloparsec\nscales. From the velocity map we find no evidence that SN 2017egm occurred\nwithin some intervening satellite galaxy, and at the SN position most\nmetallicity diagnostics yield a solar and above solar metallicity (12 + log\n(O/H) = 8.8-9.1). Additionally we measure a small H-alpha equivalent width (EW)\nat the SN position of just 34 Angs, which is one of the lowest EWs measured at\nany SLSN or Gamma-Ray Burst position, and indicative of the progenitor star\nbeing comparatively old. We also compare the observed properties of NGC 3191\nwith other SLSN host galaxies. The solar-metallicity environment at the\nposition of SN 2017egm presents a challenge to our theoretical understanding,\nand our spatially resolved spectral analysis provides further constraints on\nthe progenitors of SLSNe.\n", "  We present calculations of the hyperfine coupling constants for all the\nheteronuclear alkali-metal diatomic molecules at the equilibrium geometry of\nthe electronic ground state. These constants are important in developing\nmethods to control ultracold polar molecules. The results are based on\nelectronic structure calculations using density functional theory, and are in\ngood agreement with experiment for the limited set of molecules for which\nexperiments are so far available.\n", "  We report an unexpected positive hydrostatic pressure derivative of the\nsuperconducting transition temperature in the doped topological insulator \\NBS\nvia $dc$ SQUID magnetometry in pressures up to 0.6 GPa. This result is contrary\nto reports on the homologues \\CBS and \\SBS where smooth suppression of $T_c$ is\nobserved. Our results are consistent with recent Ginzburg-Landau theory\npredictions of a pressure-induced enhancement of $T_c$ in the nematic\nmulticomponent $E_u$ state proposed to explain observations of rotational\nsymmetry breaking in doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ superconductors.\n", "  This paper aims to give a coordinate based introduction to the so-called\nLounesto spinorial classification scheme. We introduce the main ideas and\naspects of this spinorial categorization in an argumentative basis, after what\nwe delve into a commented account on recent results obtained from (and within)\nthis branch of research.\n", "  Identification of microscopic configuration of point defects acting as\nquantum bits is a key step in the advance of quantum information processing and\nsensing. Among the numerous candidates, silicon vacancy related centers in\nsilicon carbide (SiC) have shown remarkable properties owing to their\nparticular spin-3/2 ground and excited states. Although, these centers were\nobserved decades ago, still two competing models, the isolated negatively\ncharged silicon vacancy and the complex of negatively charged silicon vacancy\nand neutral carbon vacancy [Phys. Rev. Lett.\\ \\textbf{115}, 247602 (2015)] are\nargued as an origin. By means of high precision first principles calculations\nand high resolution electron spin resonance measurements, we here unambiguously\nidentify the Si-vacancy related qubits in hexagonal SiC as isolated negatively\ncharged silicon vacancies. Moreover, we identify the Si-vacancy qubit\nconfigurations that provide room temperature optical readout.\n", "  The Canada-France Imaging Survey (CFIS) will map the northern high Galactic\nlatitude sky in the $u$-band (\"CFIS-u\", 10,000$\\, {\\rm deg^2}$) and in the\n$r$-band (\"CFIS-r\", 5,000$\\, {\\rm deg^2}$), enabling a host of stand-alone\nscience investigations, and providing some of the ground-based data necessary\nfor photometric redshift determination for the Euclid mission. In this first\ncontribution we present the $u$-band component of the survey, describe the\nobservational strategy, and discuss some first highlight results, based on\napproximately one third of the final area. We show that the Galactic anticenter\nstructure is distributed continuously along the line of sight, out to beyond 20\nkpc, and possesses a metallicity distribution that is essentially identical to\nthat of the outer disk sampled by APOGEE. This suggests that it is probably a\nbuckled disk of old metal-rich stars, rather than a stream or a flare. We also\ndiscuss the future potential for CFIS-u in discovering star-forming dwarf\ngalaxies around the Local Group, the characterization of the white dwarf and\nblue straggler population of the Milky Way, as well as its sensitivity to\nlow-surface brightness structures in external galaxies.\n", "  We present the chemical distribution of the Milky Way, based on 2,900$\\, {\\rm\ndeg^2}$ of $u$-band photometry taken as part of the Canada-France Imaging\nSurvey. When complete, this survey will cover 10,000$\\, {\\rm deg^2}$ of the\nNorthern sky. By combing the CFHT $u$-band photometry together with SDSS and\nPan-STARRS $g,r,$ and $i$, we demonstrate that we are able to measure reliably\nthe metallicities of individual stars to $\\sim 0.2$ dex, and hence additionally\nobtain good photometric distance estimates. This survey thus permits the\nmeasurement of metallicities and distances of the dominant main-sequence\npopulation out to approximately 30 kpc, and provides much higher number of\nstars at large extraplanar distances than have been available from previous\nsurveys. We develop a non-parametric distance-metallicity decomposition\nalgorithm and apply it to the sky at $30\\deg < |b| < 70\\deg$ and to the North\nGalactic Cap. We find that the metallicity-distance distribution is\nwell-represented by three populations whose metallicity distributions do not\nvary significantly with vertical height above the disk. As traced in\nmain-sequence stars, the stellar halo component shows a vertical density\nprofile that is close to exponential, with a scale height of around 3 kpc. This\nmay indicate that the inner halo was formed partly from disk stars ejected in\nan ancient minor merger.\n", "  We investigate the peptide AcPheAla5LysH+, a model system for studying helix\nformation in the gas phase, in order to fully understand the forces that\nstabilize the helical structure. In particular, we address the question of\nwhether the local fixation of the positive charge at the peptide's C-terminus\nis a prerequisite for forming helices by replacing the protonated C-terminal\nLys residue by Ala and a sodium cation. The combination of gas-phase\nvibrational spectroscopy of cryogenically cooled ions with molecular\nsimulations based on density-functional theory (DFT) allows for detailed\nstructure elucidation. For sodiated AcPheAla6, we find globular rather than\nhelical structures, as the mobile positive charge strongly interacts with the\npeptide backbone and disrupts secondary structure formation. Interestingly, the\nglobal minimum structure from simulation is not present in the experiment. We\ninterpret that this is due to high barriers involved in re-arranging the\npeptide-cation interaction that ultimately result in kinetically trapped\nstructures being observed in the experiment.\n", "  We find a new class of topological superconductors which possess an emergent\ntime-reversal symmetry that is present only after projecting to an effective\nlow-dimensional model. We show that a topological phase in symmetry class DIII\ncan be realized in a noninteracting system coupled to an $s$-wave\nsuperconductor only if the physical time-reversal symmetry of the system is\nbroken, and we provide three general criteria that must be satisfied in order\nto have such a phase. We also provide an explicit model which realizes the\nclass DIII topological superconductor in 1D. We show that, just as in\ntime-reversal invariant topological superconductors, the topological phase is\ncharacterized by a Kramers pair of Majorana fermions that are protected by the\nemergent time-reversal symmetry.\n", "  We report on the discovery of ionised gas filaments in the circum-galactic\nhalo of the extremely metal-poor compact starburst SBS 0335-052E in a 1.5h\nintegration with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph. We detect these features\nin H${\\alpha}$ and [OIII] emission down to surface-brightness levels of $5\n\\times 10^{-19}$erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. The filaments have\nprojected diameters of 2.1 kpc and extend more than 9 kpc to the north and\nnorth-west from the main stellar body. We also detect extended nebular HeII\n$\\lambda$4686 emission that brightens towards the north-west at the rim of a\nstar-burst driven super-shell, suggestive of a locally enhanced UV radiation\nfield due to shocks. We also present a velocity field of the ionised gas. The\nfilaments appear to connect seamlessly in velocity space to the kinematical\ndisturbances caused by the shell. Similar to high-$z$ star-forming galaxies,\nthe ionised gas in this galaxy is dispersion dominated. We argue that the\nfilaments were created via feedback from the starburst and that these ionised\nstructures in the halo may act as escape channels for Lyman continuum radiation\nin this gas-rich system.\n", "  We explore the association of non-neutralized currents with solar flare\noccurrence in a sizable sample of observations, aiming to show the potential of\nsuch currents in solar flare prediction. We use the regularly produced high\nquality vector magnetograms by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and more\nspecifically the Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP). Through a\nnewly established method, that incorporates detailed error analysis, we\ncalculate the non-neutralized currents contained in active regions (AR). Two\npredictors are produced, namely the total and the maximum unsigned\nnon-neutralized current. Both are tested in AR time-series and a representative\nsample of point-in-time observations during the interval 2012-2016. The average\nvalues of non-neutralized currents in flaring active regions are by more than\nan order of magnitude higher than in non-flaring regions and correlate very\nwell with the corresponding flare index. The temporal evolution of these\nparameters appears to be connected to physical processes, such as flux\nemergence and/or magnetic polarity inversion line formation that are associated\nwith increased solar flare activity. Using Bayesian inference of flaring\nprobabilities, it is shown that the total unsigned non-neutralized current\noutperforms significantly the total unsigned magnetic flux and other well\nestablished current-related predictors. Thus, it shows good prospects for\ninclusion in an operational flare forecasting service. We plan to use the new\npredictor in the framework of the FLARECAST project along with other highly\nperforming predictors.\n", "  The tunneling decay event of a metastable state in a fully connected quantum\nspin model can be simulated efficiently by path integral quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC) [Isakov $et~al.$, Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\\bf 117}$, 180402 (2016).]. This is\nbecause the exponential scaling with the number of spins of the\nthermally-assisted quantum tunneling rate and the Kramers escape rate of QMC\nare identical [Jiang $et~al.$, Phys. Rev. A ${\\bf 95}$, 012322 (2017).], a\nresult of a dominant instantonic tunneling path. In Ref. [1], it was also\nconjectured that the escape rate in open-boundary QMC is quadratically larger\nthan that of conventional periodic-boundary QMC, therefore, open-boundary QMC\nmight be used as a powerful tool to solve combinatorial optimization problems.\nThe intuition behind this conjecture is that the action of the instanton in\nopen-boundary QMC is a half of that in periodic-boundary QMC. Here, we show\nthat this simple intuition---although very useful in interpreting some\nnumerical results---deviates from the actual situation in several ways. Using a\nfully connected quantum spin model, we derive a set of conditions on the\npositions and momenta of the endpoints of the instanton, which remove the extra\ndegrees of freedom due to open boundaries. In comparison, the half-instanton\nconjecture incorrectly sets the momenta at the endpoints to zero. We also found\nthat the instantons in open-boundary QMC correspond to quantum tunneling events\nin the symmetric subspace (maximum total angular momentum) at all temperatures,\nwhereas the instantons in periodic-boundary QMC typically lie in subspaces with\nlower total angular momenta at finite temperatures. This leads to a lesser than\nquadratic speedup at finite temperatures. We also outline the generalization of\nthe instantonic tunneling method to many-qubit systems without permutation\nsymmetry using spin-coherent-state path integrals.\n", "  Studies suggest that the pollution of white dwarf (WD) atmospheres arises\nfrom the accretion of minor planets, but the exact properties of polluting\nmaterial, and in particular the evidence for water in some cases are not yet\nunderstood. Previous works studied the water retention in minor planets around\nmain-sequence and evolving host stars, in order to evaluate the possibility\nthat water survives inside minor planets around WDs. However, all of these\nstudies focused on small, comet-sized to moonlet-sized minor planets, when the\ninferred mass inside the convection zones of He-dominated WDs could actually\nalso be compatible with much more massive minor planets. In this study we\ntherefore explore for the first time, the water retention inside exo-planetary\ndwarf planets, or moderate-sized moons, with radii of the order of hundreds of\nkilometres. We now cover nearly the entire potential mass range of minor\nplanets. The rest of the parameter space considered in this study is identical\nto that of our previous study, and also includes multiple WD progenitor star\nmasses. We find that water retention in more massive minor planets is still\naffected by the mass of the WD progenitor, however not as much as when small\nminor planets were considered. We also find that water retention is now almost\nalways greater than zero. On average, the detected water fraction in\nHe-dominated WD atmospheres should be at least 5\\%, irrespective of the assumed\ninitial water composition, if it came from a single accretion event of an icy\ndwarf planet or moon. This finding also strengthens the possibility of WD\nhabitability. To finalize our previous and current findings, we provide a code\nwhich may be freely used as a service to the community. The code calculates ice\nand water retention by interpolation, spanning the full mass range of both\nminor planets and their host stars.\n", "  With the increasing sensitivity of advanced gravitational wave detectors, the\nfirst joint detection of an electromagnetic and gravitational wave signal from\na compact binary merger will hopefully happen within this decade. However,\ncurrent gravitational-wave likelihood sky areas span $\\sim\n100-1000\\,\\textrm{deg}^2$, and thus it is a challenging task to identify which,\nif any, transient corresponds to the gravitational-wave event. In this study,\nwe make a comparison between recent kilonovae/macronovae lightcurve models for\nthe purpose of assessing potential lightcurve templates for counterpart\nidentification. We show that recent analytical and parametrized models for\nthese counterparts result in qualitative agreement with more complicated\nradiative transfer simulations. Our analysis suggests that with improved\nlightcurve models with smaller uncertainties, it will become possible to\nextract information about ejecta properties and binary parameters directly from\nthe lightcurve measurement. Even tighter constraints are obtained in cases for\nwhich gravitational-wave and kilonovae parameter estimation results are\ncombined. However, to be prepared for upcoming detections, more realistic\nkilonovae models are needed. These will require numerical relativity with more\ndetailed microphysics, better radiative transfer simulations, and a better\nunderstanding of the underlying nuclear physics.\n", "  The present work deals with the dynamical system investigation of interacting\ndark energy models (quintessence and phantom) in the framework of Loop Quantum\nCosmology by taking into account a broad class of self-interacting scalar field\npotentials. The main reason for studying potentials beyond the exponential type\nis to obtain additional critical points which can yield more interesting\ncosmological solutions. The stability of critical points and the asymptotic\nbehavior of the phase space are analyzed using dynamical system tools and\nnumerical techniques. We study two class of interacting dark energy models and\nconsider two specific potentials as examples: the hyperbolic potential and the\ninverse power-law potential. We found a rich and interesting phenomenology\nincluding the avoidance of big rip singularities due to loop quantum effects,\nsmooth and non-linear transitions from matter domination to dark energy\ndomination and finite periods of phantom domination with dynamical crossing of\nthe phantom barrier.\n", "  We present our ALMA multi-transition molecular line observational results for\nthe ultraluminous infrared galaxy, IRAS 20551-4250, which is known to contain a\nluminous buried AGN and shows detectable vibrationally excited (v2=1f) HCN and\nHNC emission lines. The rotational J=1-0, 4-3, and 8-7 of HCN, HCO+, and HNC\nemission lines were clearly detected at a vibrational ground level (v=0).\nVibrationally excited (v2=1f) J=4-3 emission lines were detected for HCN and\nHNC, but not for HCO+. Their observed flux ratios further support our\npreviously obtained suggestion, based on J=3-2 data, that (1) infrared\nradiative pumping plays a role in rotational excitation at v=0, at least for\nHCN and HNC, and (2) HCN abundance is higher than HCO+ and HNC. The flux\nmeasurements of the isotopologue H13CN, H13CO+, and HN13C J=3-2 emission lines\nsupport the higher HCN abundance scenario. Based on modeling with collisional\nexcitation, we constrain the physical properties of these line-emitting\nmolecular gas, but find that higher HNC rotational excitation than HCN and HCO+\nis difficult to explain, due to the higher effective critical density of HNC.\nWe consider the effects of infrared radiative pumping using the available 5-30\nmicron infrared spectrum and find that our observational results are well\nexplained if the radiation source is located at 30-100 pc from the molecular\ngas. The simultaneously covered very bright CO J=3-2 emission line displays a\nbroad emission wing, which we interpret as being due to molecular outflow\nactivity with the estimated rate of ~150 Msun/yr.\n", "  This is a short survey of signatures and characteristics of the quark-gluon\nplasma in the light of experimental results that have been obtained over the\npast three decades. In particular, we present an in-depth discussion of the\nstrangeness observable, including a chronology of the experimental effort to\ndetect QGP at CERN-SPS, BNL-RHIC, and CERN-LHC.\n", "  We complete our earlier study of the \"direct\" part of the cross section and\nspin asymmetry for the photoproduction process $\\gamma N\\rightarrow h X$ by\nanalysing the \"resolved\" contribution, for which the photon couples like a\nhadron through its parton structure. The incident photon and nucleon are\nlongitudinally polarized and one observes a hadron $h$ at high transverse\nmomentum $p_T$. Soft or collinear gluon emissions generate large logarithmic\nthreshold corrections which we resum to next-to-leading logarithmic order. We\ncompare our results with recent spin asymmetry data by the COMPASS\ncollaboration, highlighting the role of the fragmentation functions.\n", "  Measuring a weak gravitational lensing signal to the level required by the\nnext generation of space-based surveys demands exquisite reconstruction of the\npoint-spread function (PSF). However, unresolved binary stars can significantly\ndistort the PSF shape. In an effort to mitigate this bias, we aim at detecting\nunresolved binaries in realistic Euclid stellar populations. We tested methods\nin numerical experiments where (i) the PSF shape is known to Euclid\nrequirements across the field of view, and (ii) the PSF shape is unknown. We\ndrew simulated catalogues of PSF shapes for this proof-of-concept paper.\nFollowing the Euclid survey plan, the objects were observed four times. We\npropose three methods to detect unresolved binary stars. The detection is based\non the systematic and correlated biases between exposures of the same object.\nOne method is a simple correlation analysis, while the two others use\nsupervised machine-learning algorithms (random forest and artificial neural\nnetwork). In both experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our methods to\ndetect unresolved binary stars in simulated catalogues. The performance depends\non the level of prior knowledge of the PSF shape and the shape measurement\nerrors. Good detection performances are observed in both experiments. Full\ncomplexity, in terms of the images and the survey design, is not included, but\nkey aspects of a more mature pipeline are discussed. Finding unresolved\nbinaries in objects used for PSF reconstruction increases the quality of the\nPSF determination at arbitrary positions. We show, using different approaches,\nthat we are able to detect at least binary stars that are most damaging for the\nPSF reconstruction process.\n", "  On both observational and theoretical grounds, the disk of our Galaxy should\nbe accreting cool gas with temperature ~<10^5 K via the halo at a rate ~1\nM_sun/yr. At least some of this accretion is mediated by high velocity clouds\n(HVCs), observed to be traveling in the halo with velocities of a few 100 km/s\nand occasionally impacting the disk at such velocities, especially in the outer\nregions of the Galaxy. We address the possibility of particle acceleration in\nshocks triggered by such HVC accretion events, and the detectability of\nconsequent non-thermal emission in the radio to gamma-ray bands and high-energy\nneutrinos. For plausible shock velocities ~300 km/s and magnetic field\nstrengths ~0.3-10 muG, electrons and protons may be accelerated up to ~1-10 TeV\nand ~30-10^3 TeV, respectively, in sufficiently strong adiabatic shocks during\ntheir lifetime of ~10^6 yr. The resultant pion decay and inverse Compton\ngamma-rays may be the origin of some unidentified Galactic GeV-TeV sources,\nparticularly the \"dark\" source HESS J1503-582 that is spatially coincident with\nanomalous HI structure known as \"forbidden-velocity wings\". Correlation of\ntheir locations with star-forming regions may be weak, absent or even opposite.\nNon-thermal radio and X-ray emission from primary and/or secondary electrons\nmay be detectable with deeper observations. The contribution of HVC accretion\nto Galactic cosmic rays is subdominant, but could be non-negligible in the\nouter Galaxy. As the thermal emission induced by HVC accretion is likely\ndifficult to detect, observations of such phenomena may offer a unique\nperspective on probing gas accretion onto the Milky Way and other galaxies.\n", "  We present observations of distinct UV spectral properties at different\nlocations during an atypical X-shaped flare (SOL2014-11-09T15:32) observed by\nthe Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). In this flare, four\nchromospheric ribbons appear and converge at an X-point where a separator is\nanchored. Above the X-point, two sets of non-coplanar coronal loops approach\nlaterally and reconnect at the separator. The IRIS slit was located close to\nthe X-point, cutting across some of the flare ribbons and loops. Near the\nlocation of the separator, the Si IV 1402.77 A line exhibits significantly\nbroadened line wings extending to 200 km/s but an unshifted line core. These\nspectral features suggest the presence of bidirectional flows possibly related\nto the separator reconnection. While at the flare ribbons, the hot Fe XXI\n1354.08 A line shows blueshifts and the cool Si IV 1402.77 A, C II 1335.71 A,\nand Mg II 2803.52 A lines show evident redshifts up to a velocity of 80 km/s,\nwhich are consistent with the scenario of chromospheric\nevaporation/condensation.\n", "  We have investigated ultrafast quenching of the Tb4f magnetic order in\nCo74Tb26 alloys, induced by femtosecond hot-electrons pulses. The hot-electron\npulses were produced in specific non-magnetic capping layers by infrared fs\nlaser pulses. Our experimental results show that sub-picosecond dynamics of\nTb4f magnetic moments can be induced by non-thermal and thermal hot-electrons.\nWe further demonstrate that the demagnetization efficiencies of non-thermal and\nthermal hot electrons are similar. However, the characteristic demagnetization\ntimes show values of 0.35 ps for non-thermal hot-electrons excitations and 1.2\nps for thermal hot-electrons excitations. We explain this temporal elongation\nby the propagation time of thermal hot-electrons through the 15 nm thick CoTb\nfilm.\n", "  Extending our previous studies, we perform high-resolution simulations of\ninspiraling binary neutron stars in numerical relativity. We thoroughly carry\nthrough a convergence study in our currently available computational resources\nwith the smallest grid spacing of $\\approx 63$--86~meter for the neutron-star\nradius 10.9--13.7\\,km. The estimated total error in the gravitational-wave\nphase is of order 0.1~rad for the total phase of $\\gtrsim 210$\\,rad in the last\n$\\sim 15$--16 inspiral orbits. We then compare the waveforms (without\nresolution extrapolation) with those calculated by the latest\neffective-one-body formalism (tidal SEOBv2 model referred to as TEOB model). We\nfind that for any of our models of binary neutron stars, the waveforms\ncalculated by the TEOB formalism agree with the numerical-relativity waveforms\nup to $\\approx 3$\\,ms before the peak of the gravitational-wave amplitude is\nreached: For this late inspiral stage, the total phase error is $\\lesssim\n0.1$\\,rad. Although the gravitational waveforms have an inspiral-type feature\nfor the last $\\sim 3$\\,ms, this stage cannot be well reproduced by the current\nTEOB formalism, in particular, for neutron stars with large tidal deformability\n(i.e., lager radius). The reason for this is described.\n", "  Context. Recently, new sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were\ndiscovered, including SNe Iax. The suggested progenitors of SNe Iax are\nrelatively massive, possibly hybrid C+O+Ne white dwarfs, which can cause white\ndwarf winds at low metallicities. There is another class that can potentially\noccur at low or zero metallicities; sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions in single\nand/or double degenerate systems of standard C+O white dwarfs. These explosions\nhave different nucleosynthesis yields compared to the normal, Chandrasekhar\nmass explosions. Aims. We test these SN Ia channels using their characteristic\nchemical signatures. Methods. The two sub-classes of SNe Ia are expected to be\nrarer than normal SNe Ia and do not affect the chemical evolution in the solar\nneighbourhood; however, because of the shorter delay time and/or weaker\nmetallicity dependence, they could influence the evolution of metalpoor\nsystems. Therefore, we have included both in our stochastic chemical evolution\nmodel for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Results. The model predicts a\nbutterfly-shape spread in [Mn/Fe] in the interstellar medium at low metallicity\nand - at the same time - a decrease of [alpha/Fe] ratios at lower [Fe/H] than\nin the solar neighbourhood, both of which are consistent with the observed\nabundances in stars of Ursa Minor. Conclusions. The surprising agreement\nbetween our models and available observations provides a strong indication of\nthe origins of these new sub-classes of SNe Ia. This outcome requires\nconfirmation by future abundance measurements of manganese in stars of other\nsatellite galaxies of ourMilkyWay. It will be vital for this project to measure\nnot the most extreme metal-poor tail, as more commonly happens, but the\nopposite; the metal-rich end of dwarf spheroidals.\n", "  In the wake of recent measurements of the decays $B_c^+\\to J/\\psi D^+_s$ and\n$B_c^+\\to J/\\psi D^{\\ast\\,+}_s$ performed by the LHCb and ATLAS Collaborations,\nwe recalculate their branching fractions in the framework of the covariant\nconfined quark model. We compare the obtained results with available\nexperimental data, our previous findings and numbers from other approaches.\n", "  The localized loading of an elastic sheet floating on a liquid bath occurs at\nscales from a frog sitting on a lily pad to a volcano supported by the Earth's\ntectonic plates. The load is supported by a combination of the stresses within\nthe sheet (which may include applied tensions from, for example, surface\ntension) and the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid. At the same time, the\nsheet deforms, and may wrinkle, because of the load. We study this problem in\nterms of the (relatively weak) applied tension and the indentation depth. For\nsmall indentation depths, we find that the force--indentation curve is linear\nwith a stiffness that we characterize in terms of the applied tension and\nbending stiffness of the sheet. At larger indentations the force--indentation\ncurve becomes nonlinear and the sheet is subject to a wrinkling instability. We\nstudy this wrinkling instability close to the buckling threshold and calculate\nboth the number of wrinkles at onset and the indentation depth at onset,\ncomparing our theoretical results with experiments. Finally, we contrast our\nresults with those previously reported for very thin, highly bendable\nmembranes.\n", "  We present a measurement of the fraction of Lyman $\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$)\nemitters ($X_{\\rm{Ly} \\alpha}$) amongst HST continuum-selected galaxies at\n$3<z<6$ with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the VLT. Making\nuse of the first 24 MUSE-Wide pointings in GOODS-South, each having an\nintegration time of 1 hour, we detect 100 Ly$\\alpha$ emitters and find\n$X_{\\rm{Ly} \\alpha}\\gtrsim0.5$ for most of the redshift range covered, with 29\nper cent of the Ly$\\alpha$ sample exhibiting rest equivalent widths (rest-EWs)\n$\\leq$ 15\\AA. Adopting a range of rest-EW cuts (0 - 75\\AA), we find no evidence\nof a dependence of $X_{\\rm{Ly} \\alpha}$ on either redshift or UV luminosity.\n", "  We report the detection of an Halpha trail of 85 kpc projected length behind\ngalaxy 2MASX J11443212+2006238 in the nearby cluster of galaxies Abell 1367.\nThis galaxy was discovered to possess an extended component in earlier, deeper\nH$\\alpha$ observations carried out with the Subaru telescope. However, lying at\nthe border of the Subaru field, the extended Halpha tail was cut out,\npreventing the determination of its full extent. We fully map this extent here,\nalbeit the shallower exposure.\n", "  We use a suite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations from the Evolution\nand Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project to investigate\nthe formation of hot hydrostatic haloes and their dependence on feedback\nmechanisms. We find that the appearance of a strong bimodality in the\nprobability density function (PDF) of the ratio of the radiative cooling and\ndynamical times for halo gas provides a clear signature of the formation of a\nhot corona. Haloes of total mass $10^{11.5}-10^{12}{\\rm{M}}_{\\odot}$ develop a\nhot corona independent of redshift, at least in the interval $z=0-4$ where the\nsimulation has sufficiently good statistics. We analyse the build up of the hot\ngas mass in the halo, $M_{\\rm{hot}}$, as a function of halo mass and redshift\nand find that while more energetic galactic winds powered by SNe increases\n$M_{\\rm{hot}}$, AGN feedback reduces it by ejecting gas from the halo. We also\nstudy the thermal properties of gas accreting onto haloes and measure the\nfraction of shock-heated gas as a function of redshift and halo mass. We\ndevelop analytic and semianalytic approaches to estimate a `critical halo\nmass', $M_{\\rm{crit}}$, for hot halo formation. We find that the mass for which\nthe heating rate produced by accretion shocks equals the radiative cooling\nrate, reproduces the mass above which haloes develop a significant hot\natmosphere. This yields a mass estimate of $M_{\\rm{crit}} \\approx\n10^{11.7}{\\rm{M}}_{\\odot}$ at $z=0$, which agrees with the simulation results.\nThe value of $M_{\\rm{crit}}$ depends more strongly on the cooling rate than on\nany of the feedback parameters.\n", "  It has become clear in recent years that the simple uniform wormlike chain\nmodel needs to be modified in order to account for more complex behavior which\nhas been observed experimentally in some important biopolymers. For example,\nthe large flexibility of short ds-DNA has been attributed to kink or hinge\ndefects. In this paper, we calculate analytically, within the weak bending\napproximation, the force-extension relation of a wormlike chain with a\npermanent hinge defect along its contour. The defect is characterized by its\nbending energy (which can be zero, in the completely flexible case) and its\nposition along the polymer contour. Besides the bending rigidity of the chain,\nthese are the only parameters which describe our model. We show that a hinge\ndefect causes a significant increase in the differential tensile compliance of\na pre-stressed chain. In the small force limit, a hinge defect significantly\nincreases the entropic elasticity. Our results apply to any pair of\nsemiflexible segments connected by a hinge. As such, they may also be relevant\nto cytoskeletal filaments (F-actin, microtubules), where one may treat the\ncross-link connecting two filaments as a hinge defect.\n", "  \"Spin pumping\" is the injection of spin angular momentum by a time-dependent\nmagnetization into an adjacent normal metal proportional to the spin mixing\nconductance. We study the role of electrostatic interactions in the form of\ncrystal fields on the pumped spin currents generated by insulators with\nexchange-coupled local moments at the interface to a metal. The crystal field\nis shown to render the spin currents anisotropic, which implies that the spin\nmixing conductance of insulator|normal metal bilayers depends on crystal cut\nand orientation. We interpret the interface \"effective field\" (imaginary part\nof the spin mixing conductance) in terms of the coherent motion of the\nequilibrium spin density induced by proximity in the normal metal.\n", "  The chemical conditions in the planet forming regions of protoplanetary discs\nremain difficult to observe directly. Gas accreting from the disc on to the\nstar provides a way to measure the elemental abundances because even refractory\nspecies are in an atomic gaseous form. Here we compare the abundance ratios\nderived from UV lines probing T Tauri accretion streams to simple models of\ndisc evolution. Although the interpretation of line ratios in terms of\nabundances is highly uncertain, discs with large cavities in mm images tend to\nhave lower Si emission. Since this can naturally be explained by the suppressed\naccretion of dust, this suggests that abundance variations are at least\npartially responsible for the variations seen in the line ratios. Our models of\ndisc evolution due to grain growth, radial drift and the flux of volatile\nspecies carried as ices on grain surfaces, give rise to a partial sorting of\nthe atomic species based on the volatility of their dominant molecular\ncarriers. This arises because volatiles are left behind at their snow lines\nwhile the grains continue to drift. We show that this reproduces the main\nfeatures seen in the accretion line ratio data, such as C/N ratios that are a\nfew times solar and the correlation between the Si to volatile ratio with\nmm-flux. We highlight the fact that developing a more robust linkage between\nline ratios and abundance ratios and acquiring data for larger samples has the\npotential to cast considerable light on the chemical history of protoplanetary\ndiscs.\n", "  1SWASP\\,J162117.36$+$441254.2 was originally classified as an EW-type binary\nwith a period of 0.20785\\,days. However, it was detected to have undergone a\nstellar outburst on June 3, 2016. Although the system was latter classified as\na cataclysmic variable (CV) and the event was attributed as a dwarf-nova\noutburst, the physical reason is still unknown. This binary has been monitored\nphotometrically since April 19, 2016 and many light curves were obtained\nbefore, during and after the outburst. Those light and color curves observed\nbefore the outburst indicate that the system is a special CV. The white dwarf\nis not accreting material from the secondary and there are no accretion disks\nsurrounding the white dwarf. By comparing the light curves obtained from April\n19 to September 14, 2016, it was found that magnetic activity of the secondary\nis associated with the outburst. We show strong evidence that the $L_1$ region\non the secondary was heavily spotted before and after the outburst and thus\nquench the mass transfer, while the outburst is produced by a sudden mass\naccretion of the white dwarf. These results suggest that J162117 is a good\nastrophysical laboratory to study stellar magnetic activity and its influences\non CV mass transfer and mass accretion.\n", "  We use hydrodynamical simulations of a Cartwheel-like ring galaxy, modelled\nas a nearly head-on collision of a small companion with a larger disc galaxy,\nto probe the evolution of the gaseous structures and flows, and to explore the\nphysical conditions setting the star formation activity. Star formation is\nfirst quenched by tides as the companion approaches, before being enhanced\nshortly after the collision. The ring ploughs the disc material as it radially\nextends, and almost simultaneously depletes its stellar and gaseous reservoir\ninto the central region, through the spokes, and finally dissolve 200 Myr after\nthe collision. Most of star formation first occurs in the ring before this\nactivity is transferred to the spokes and then the nucleus. We thus propose\nthat the location of star formation traces the dynamical stage of ring\ngalaxies, and could help constrain their star formation histories. The ring\nhosts tidal compression associated with strong turbulence. This compression\nyields an azimuthal asymmetry, with maxima reached in the side furthest away\nfrom the nucleus, which matches the star formation activity distribution in our\nmodels and in observed ring systems. The interaction triggers the formation of\nstar clusters significantly more massive than before the collision, but less\nnumerous than in more classical galaxy interactions. The peculiar geometry of\nCartwheel-like objects thus yields a star (cluster) formation activity\ncomparable to other interacting objects, but with notable second order\ndifferences in the nature of turbulence, the enhancement of the star formation\nrate, and the number of massive clusters formed.\n", "  We present results of a multi-epoch monitoring program on variability of\n6$\\,$cm formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) masers in the massive star forming region\nNGC$\\,$7538$\\,$IRS$\\,$1 from 2008 to 2015 conducted with the GBT, WSRT, and\nVLA. We found that the similar variability behaviors of the two formaldehyde\nmaser velocity components in NGC$\\,$7538$\\,$IRS$\\,$1 (which was pointed out by\nAraya and collaborators in 2007) have continued. The possibility that the\nvariability is caused by changes in the maser amplification path in regions\nwith similar morphology and kinematics is discussed. We also observed\n12.2$\\,$GHz methanol and 22.2$\\,$GHz water masers toward\nNGC$\\,$7538$\\,$IRS$\\,$1. The brightest maser components of CH$_3$OH and H$_2$O\nspecies show a decrease in flux density as a function of time. The brightest\nH$_2$CO maser component also shows a decrease in flux density and has a similar\nLSR velocity to the brightest H$_2$O and 12.2$\\,$GHz CH$_3$OH masers. The line\nparameters of radio recombination lines and the 20.17 and 20.97$\\,$GHz CH$_3$OH\ntransitions in NGC$\\,$7538$\\,$IRS$\\,$1 are also reported. In addition, we\nobserved five other 6$\\,$cm formaldehyde maser regions. We found no evidence of\nsignificant variability of the 6$\\,$cm masers in these regions with respect to\nprevious observations, the only possible exception being the maser in\nG29.96$-$0.02. All six sources were also observed in the H$_2^{13}$CO\nisotopologue transition of the 6$\\,$cm H$_2$CO line; H$_2^{13}$CO absorption\nwas detected in five of the sources. Estimated column density ratios\n[H$_2^{12}$CO]/[H$_2^{13}$CO] are reported.\n", "  We derive the contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB)\nfrom AGN winds and star-forming galaxies by including a physical model for the\ngamma-ray emission produced by relativistic protons accelerated by AGN-driven\nand supernova-driven shocks into a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model of\ngalaxy formation. This is based on galaxy interactions as triggers of AGN\naccretion and starburst activity and on expanding blast wave as the mechanism\nto communicate outwards the energy injected into the interstellar medium by the\nactive nucleus. We compare the model predictions with the latest measurement of\nthe EGB spectrum performed by the Fermi-LAT in the range between 100 MeV and\n820 GeV. We find that AGN winds can provide ~35$\\pm$15% of the observed EGB in\nthe energy interval E_{\\gamma}=0.1-1 GeV, for ~73$\\pm$15% at E_{\\gamma}=1-10\nGeV, and for ~60$\\pm$20% at E_{\\gamma}>10 GeV. The AGN wind contribution to the\nEGB is predicted to be larger by a factor of 3-5 than that provided by\nstar-forming galaxies (quiescent plus starburst) in the hierarchical clustering\nscenario. The cumulative gamma-ray emission from AGN winds and blazars can\naccount for the amplitude and spectral shape of the EGB, assuming the standard\nacceleration theory, and AGN wind parameters that agree with observations. We\nalso compare the model prediction for the cumulative neutrino background from\nAGN winds with the most recent IceCube data. We find that for AGN winds with\naccelerated proton spectral index p=2.2-2.3, and taking into account internal\nabsorption of gamma-rays, the Fermi-LAT and IceCube data could be reproduced\nsimultaneously.\n", "  The large day--night temperature contrast of WASP-43b has so far eluded\nexplanation. We revisit the energy budget of this planet by considering the\nimpact of reflected light on dayside measurements, and the physicality of\nimplied nightside temperatures. Previous analyses of the infrared eclipses of\nWASP-43b have assumed reflected light from the planet is negligible and can be\nignored. We develop a phenomenological eclipse model including reflected light,\nthermal emission, and water absorption, and use it to fit published Hubble and\nSpitzer eclipse data. We infer a near-infrared geometric albedo of 27$\\pm1\\%$\nand a cooler dayside temperature of $1527 \\pm 10~$K. Additionally, we perform\nlightcurve inversion on the three published orbital phase curves of WASP-43b\nand find that each requires unphysical, negative flux on the nightside. By\nrequiring non-negative brightnesses at all longitudes, we correct the\nunphysical parts of the maps and obtain a much hotter nightside effective\ntemperature of $1076 \\pm 11~$K. The cooler dayside and hotter nightside\nsuggests a heat recirculation efficiency of $47\\%$ for WASP-43b, essentially\nthe same as for HD 209458b, another hot Jupiter with nearly the same\ntemperature. Our analysis therefore reaffirms the trend that planets with lower\nirradiation temperatures have more efficient day-night heat transport.\nMoreover, we note that 1) reflected light may be significant for many near-IR\neclipse measurements of hot Jupiters, and 2) phase curves should be fit with\nphysically possible longitudinal brightness profiles --- it is insufficient to\nonly require that the disk-integrated lightcurve be non-negative.\n", "  Standard spectroscopic analyses of Cepheid variables are based on hydrostatic\none-dimensional model atmospheres, with convection treated using various\nformulations of mixing-length theory. This paper aims to carry out an\ninvestigation of the validity of the quasi-static approximation in the context\nof pulsating stars. We check the adequacy of a two-dimensional time-dependent\nmodel of a Cepheid-like variable with focus on its spectroscopic properties.\nWith the radiation-hydrodynamics code CO5BOLD, we construct a two-dimensional\ntime-dependent envelope model of a Cepheid with $T_\\mathrm{eff}= 5600$ K, $\\log\ng=2.0$, solar metallicity, and a 2.8-day pulsation period. Subsequently, we\nperform extensive spectral syntheses of a set of artificial iron lines in local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. The set of lines allows us to systematically study\neffects of line strength, ionization stage, and excitation potential. We\nevaluate the microturbulent velocity, line asymmetry, projection factor, and\nDoppler shifts. The mean Doppler shift is non-zero and negative, -1 km/s, after\naveraging over several full periods and lines. This residual line-of-sight\nvelocity (related to the \"K-term\") is primarily caused by horizontal\ninhomogeneities, and consequently we interpret it as the familiar convective\nblueshift ubiquitously present in non-pulsating late-type stars. Limited\nstatistics prevent firm conclusions on the line asymmetries. Our\ntwo-dimensional model provides a reasonably accurate representation of the\nspectroscopic properties of a short-period Cepheid-like variable star. Some\nproperties are primarily controlled by convective inhomogeneities rather than\nby the Cepheid-defining pulsations.\n", "  Recent observations suggest a \"double-branch\" behaviour of Li/H versus\nmetallicity in the local thick and thin discs. This is reminiscent of the\ncorresponding O/Fe versus Fe/H behaviour, which has been explained as resulting\nfrom radial migration in the Milky Way disc. We use a semi-analytical model of\ndisc evolution with updated chemical yields and parameterised radial migration.\nWe explore the cases of long-lived (red giants of a few Gy lifetime) and\nshorter-lived (Asymptotic Giant Branch stars of several 10$^8$ yr) stellar\nsources of Li, as well as those of low and high primordial Li. We show that\nboth factors play a key role in the overall Li evolution. We find that the\nobserved \"two-branch\" Li behaviour is only directly obtained in the case of\nlong-lived stellar Li sources and low primordial Li. In all other cases, the\ndata imply systematic Li depletion in stellar envelopes, thus no simple picture\nof the Li evolution can be obtained. This concerns also the reported Li/H\ndecrease at supersolar metallicities.\n", "  We present integrated-light spectra of 8 Young Massive Clusters (YMCs) in the\nmetal-rich spiral galaxy NGC 5236 (M 83). The observations were taken with the\nX-Shooter spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope. Through the use of\ntheoretical isochrones and synthetic integrated-light (IL) spectra we derive\nmetallicities and study the radial metallicity gradient observed through these\nyoung populations. For the inner regions of the galaxy we observe a relatively\nshallow metallicity gradient of $-$0.37 $\\pm$0.29 dex R$_{25}^{-1}$, agreeing\nwith chemical evolution models with an absence of infall material and a\nrelatively low mass loss due to winds in the inner parts of the disk. We\nestimate a central metallicity of [$Z$] = $+$0.17 $\\pm$ 0.12 dex, finding\nexcellent agreement with that obtained via other methods (e.g. blue supergiants\nand J-band). We infer a metallicity of 12+log(O/H) = 8.75 $\\pm$ 0.08 dex at\nR/R$_{25}$ = 0.4, which fits the stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR)\ncompilation of blue supergiants and IL studies.\n", "  Three dimensional (3D) magnetic field information on molecular clouds and\ncores is important for revealing their kinematical stability (magnetic support)\nagainst gravity which is fundamental for studying the initial conditions of\nstar formation. In the present study, the 3D magnetic field structure of the\ndense starless core FeSt 1-457 is determined based on the near-infrared\npolarimetric observations of the dichroic polarization of background stars and\nsimple 3D modeling. With an obtained angle of line-of-sight magnetic\ninclination axis $\\theta_{\\rm inc}$ of $45^{\\circ}\\pm10^{\\circ}$ and previously\ndetermined plane-of-sky magnetic field strength $B_{\\rm pol}$ of $23.8\\pm12.1$\n$\\mu{\\rm G}$, the total magnetic field strength for FeSt 1-457 is derived to be\n$33.7\\pm18.0$ $\\mu{\\rm G}$. The critical mass of FeSt 1-457, evaluated using\nboth magnetic and thermal/turbulent support is ${M}_{\\rm cr} = 3.70\\pm0.92$\n${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, which is identical to the observed core mass, $M_{\\rm\ncore}=3.55\\pm0.75$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. We thus conclude that the stability of\nFeSt 1-457 is in a condition close to the critical state. Without infalling gas\nmotion and no associated young stars, the core is regarded to be in the\nearliest stage of star formation, i.e., the stage just before the onset of\ndynamical collapse following the attainment of a supercritical condition. These\nproperties would make FeSt 1-457 one of the best starless cores for future\nstudies of the initial conditions of star formation.\n", "  Understanding the properties of the crust and the core as well as its\ninterface is essential for accurate astrophysical modeling of phenomena such as\nglitches, X-ray bursts or oscillations in neutron stars. To study the\ncrust-core properties, it is crucial to develop a unified and consistent scheme\nto describe both the clusterized matter in the crust and homogeneous matter in\nthe core. The low density regime in the neutron star crust is accessible to\nterrestrial nuclear experiments. In order to develop a consistent description\nof the crust and the core of neutron stars within the same formalism, we use a\ndensity functional scheme, with the model coefficients in homogeneous matter\nrelated directly to empirical nuclear observables. In this work, we extend this\nscheme to non-homogeneous matter to describe nuclei in the crust. We then test\nthis scheme against nuclear observables.\n", "  One of the most directly observable features of a transiting multi-planet\nsystem is their size-ordering when ranked in orbital separation. Kepler has\nrevealed a rich diversity of outcomes, from perfectly ordered systems, like\nKepler-80, to ostensibly disordered systems, like Kepler-20. Under the\nhypothesis that systems are born via preferred formation pathways, one might\nreasonably expect non-random size-orderings reflecting these processes.\nHowever, subsequent dynamical evolution, often chaotic and turbulent in nature,\nmay erode this information and so here we ask - do systems remember how they\nformed? To address this, we devise a model to define the entropy of a planetary\nsystem's size-ordering, by first comparing differences between neighboring\nplanets and then extending to accommodate differences across the chain. We\nderive closed-form solutions for many of the micro state occupancies and\nprovide public code with look-up tables to compute entropy for up to ten-planet\nsystems. All three proposed entropy definitions exhibit the expected property\nthat their credible interval increases with respect to a proxy for time. We\nfind that the observed Kepler multis display a highly significant deficit in\nentropy compared to a randomly generated population. Incorporating a filter for\nsystems deemed likely to be dynamically packed, we show that this result is\nrobust against the possibility of missing planets too. Put together, our work\nestablishes that Kepler systems do indeed remember something of their younger\nyears and highlights the value of information theory for exoplanetary science.\n", "  We propose a mechanism for quasi-periodic oscillations of both coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) and flare loops as related to magnetic reconnection in\neruptive solar flares. We perform two-dimensional numerical MHD simulations of\nmagnetic flux rope eruption, with three different values of the global\nLundquist number. In the low Lundquist number run, no oscillatory behavior is\nfound. In the moderate Lunquist number run, on the other hand, quasi-periodic\noscillations are excited both at the bottom of the flux rope and at the flare\nloop-top. In the high Lundquist number run, quasi-periodic oscillations are\nalso excited; in the meanwhile, the dynamics become turbulent due to the\nformation of multiple plasmoids in the reconnection current sheet. In high and\nmoderate Lundquist number runs, thin reconnection jet collide with the flux\nrope bottom or flare loop-top and dig them deeply. Steep oblique shocks are\nformed as termination shocks where reconnection jet is bent (rather than\ndecelerated) in horizontal direction, resulting in supersonic back-flows. The\nstructure becomes unstable, and quasi-periodic oscillation of supersonic\nback-flows appear at locally confined high-beta region at both the flux rope\nbottom and flare loop-top. We compare the observational characteristics of\nquasi-periodic oscillations in erupting flux ropes, post-CME current sheets,\nflare ribbons and light curves, with corresponding dynamical structures found\nin our simulation.\n", "  A long duration gamma-ray burst, GRB 160530A, was detected by the Compton\nSpectrometer and Imager (COSI) during the 2016 COSI Super Pressure Balloon\ncampaign. As a Compton telescope, COSI is inherently sensitive to the\npolarization of gamma-ray sources in the energy range 0.2-5.0 MeV. We measured\nthe polarization of GRB 160530A using 1) a standard method (SM) based on\nfitting the distribution of azimuthal scattering angles with a modulation\ncurve, and 2) an unbinned, maximum likelihood method (MLM). In both cases, the\nmeasured polarization level was below the $99\\%$ confidence minimum detectable\npolarization levels of $72.3 \\pm 0.8\\%$ (SM) and $57.5 \\pm 0.8\\%$ (MLM).\nTherefore, COSI did not detect polarized gamma-ray emission from this burst.\nOur most constraining $90\\%$ confidence upper limit on the polarization level\nwas $46\\%$ (MLM).\n", "  Astrophysical polarization measurements in the soft gamma-ray band are\nbecoming more feasible as detectors with high position and energy resolution\nare deployed. Previous work has shown that the minimum detectable polarization\n(MDP) of an ideal Compton polarimeter can be improved by $\\sim 21\\%$ when an\nunbinned, maximum likelihood method is used instead of the standard approach of\nfitting a sinusoid to a histogram of azimuthal scattering angles. Here we\noutline a procedure for implementing this maximum likelihood approach for real,\nnon-ideal polarimeters. As an example, we use the recent observation of GRB\n160530A with the Compton Spectrometer and Imager. We find that the MDP for this\nobservation is reduced by $20\\%$ when the maximum likelihood method is used\ninstead of the standard method.\n", "  The realization of geometric phase optical device operating over a broad\nspectral range is usually confronted with intrinsic limitations depending of\nthe physical process at play. Here we propose to use chiral nematic liquid\ncrystal slabs with helical ordering that varies in three dimensions. Namely,\ngradient-pitch cholesterics endowed with in-plane space-variant angular\npositioning of the supramolecular helix. By doing so, we show that the recently\nintroduced Bragg-Berry mirrors [Opt. Lett. {\\bf 41}, 3972-3975 (2016)] can be\nendowed with ultra-broadband spectral range. Experimental demonstration is made\nin the case of ultra-broadband optical vortex generation in the visible domain.\nThese results offer practical solution to the polychromatic management of the\norbital angular momentum of light combining the circular Bragg reflection of\nchiral media with the Berry phase.\n", "  A large fraction of known Jupiter like exoplanets are inflated as compared to\nJupiter. These \"hot\" Jupiters orbit close to their parent star and are\nbombarded with intense starlight. Many theories have been proposed to explain\ntheir radius inflation and several suggest that a small fraction of the\nincident starlight is injected in to the planetary interior which helps to puff\nup the planet. How will such energy injection affect the planetary dynamo? In\nthis Letter, we estimate the surface magnetic field strength of hot Jupiters\nusing scaling arguments that relate energy available in planetary interiors to\nthe dynamo generated magnetic fields. We find that if we take into account the\nenergy injected in the planetary interior that is sufficient to inflate hot\nJupiters to observed radii, then the resulting dynamo should be able generate\nmagnetic fields that are more than an order of magnitude stronger than the\nJovian values. Our analysis highlights the potential fundamental role of the\nstellar light in setting the field strength in hot Jupiters.\n", "  Understanding the effects of dust extinction is important to properly\ninterpret observations. The optical total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv =\nAv/E(B-V), is widely used to describe extinction variations in ultraviolet and\noptical bands. Since the Rv=3.1 extinction curve adequately represents the\naverage extinction law of diffuse regions in the Milky Way, it is commonly used\nto correct observational measurements along sightlines toward diffuse regions\nin the interstellar medium. However, the Rv value may vary even along different\ndiffuse interstellar medium sightlines. In this paper, we investigate the\noptical--mid-infrared (mid-IR) extinction law toward a very diffuse region at l\n= 165 in the Galactic plane, which was selected based on a CO emission map.\nAdopting red clump stars as extinction tracers, we determine the\noptical-to-mid-IR extinction law for our diffuse region in the two APASS bands\n(B, V), the three XSTPS-GAC bands (g, r, i), the three 2MASS bands (J, H, Ks,\nand the two WISE bands (W1, W2). Specifically, 18 red clump stars were selected\nfrom the APOGEE--RC catalog based on spectroscopic data in order to explore the\ndiversity of the extinction law. We find that the optical extinction curves\nexhibit appreciable diversity. The corresponding Rv ranges from 1.7 to 3.8,\nwhile the mean Rv value of 2.8 is consistent with the widely adopted average\nvalue of 3.1 for Galactic diffuse clouds. There is no apparent correlation\nbetween Rv value and color excess E(B-V) in the range of interest, from 0.2 to\n0.6 mag, or with specific visual extinction per kiloparsec, AV/d.\n", "  We present the orbital solution for the donor star of the candidate\ntransitional millisecond pulsar 3FGL J1544.6-1125, currently observed as an\naccreting low-mass X-ray binary. The orbital period is $0.2415361(36)$ days,\nentirely consistent with the spectral classification of the donor star as a mid\nto late K dwarf. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve is\nexceptionally low at $K_2=39.3\\pm1.5$ km s$^{-1}$, implying a remarkably\nface-on inclination in the range 5--8$^{\\circ}$, depending on the neutron star\nand donor masses. After determining the veiling of the secondary, we derive a\ndistance to the binary of $3.8\\pm0.7$ kpc, yielding a 0.3--10 keV X-ray\nluminosity of $6.1\\pm1.9\\times10^{33}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$, similar to confirmed\ntransitional millisecond pulsars. As face-on binaries rarely occur by chance,\nwe discuss the possibility that Fermi-selected samples of transitional\nmilli-second pulsars in the sub-luminous disk state are affected by beaming. By\nphasing emission line strength on the spectroscopic ephemeris, we find coherent\nvariations, and argue that these variations are most consistent with emission\nfrom an asymmetric shock originating near the inner disk.\n", "  We present a flux-limited sample of $z\\sim0.3$ Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs)\nfrom Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) grism spectroscopic data. The published\nGALEX $z\\sim0.3$ LAE sample is pre-selected from continuum-bright objects and\nthus is biased against high equivalent width (EW) LAEs. We remove this\ncontinuum pre-selection and compute the EW distribution and the luminosity\nfunction of the Ly$\\alpha$ emission line directly from our sample. We examine\nthe evolution of these quantities from $z\\sim0.3$ to $2.2$ and find that the EW\ndistribution shows little evidence for evolution over this redshift range. As\nshown by previous studies, the Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity density from star-forming\ngalaxies declines rapidly with declining redshift. However, we find that the\ndecline in Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity density from $z=2.2$ to $z=0.3$ may simply\nmirror the decline seen in the H$\\alpha$ luminosity density from $z=2.2$ to\n$z=0.4$, implying little change in the volumetric Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction.\nFinally, we show that the observed Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity density from AGNs is\ncomparable to the observed Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity density from star-forming\ngalaxies at $z=0.3$. We suggest that this significant contribution from AGNs to\nthe total observed Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity density persists out to $z\\sim2.2$.\n", "  We present near-IR spectroscopy of 22 luminous low-ionization broad\nabsorption line quasars (LoBAL QSOs) at redshift 1.3<z<2.5, with 12 objects at\nz~1.5 and 10 at z~2.3. The spectra cover the rest-frame H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$\nline regions, allowing us to obtain robust black hole mass estimates based on\nthe broad H$\\alpha$ line. We use these data, augmented by a lower-redshift\nsample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to test the proposed youth scenario\nfor LoBALs, which suggests that LoBALs constitute an early short-lived\nevolutionary stage of quasar activity, by probing for any difference in their\nmasses, Eddington ratios, or rest-frame optical spectroscopic properties\ncompared to normal quasars. In addition, we construct the UV to mid-IR spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) for the LoBAL sample and a matched non-BAL quasar\nsample. We do not find any statistically significant difference between LoBAL\nQSOs and non-BAL QSOs in their black hole mass or Eddington ratio\ndistributions. The mean UV to mid-IR SED of the LoBAL QSOs is consistent with\nnon-BAL QSOs, apart from their stronger reddening. At z>1 there is no clear\ndifference in their optical emission line properties. We do not see\nparticularly weak [OIII] or strong FeII emission. The LoBAL QSOs do not show a\nstronger prevalence of ionized gas outflows as traced by the [OIII] line,\ncompared to normal QSOs of similar luminosity. We conclude that the optical-MIR\nproperties of LoBAL QSOs are consistent with the general quasar population and\ndo not support them to constitute a special phase of active galactic nucleus\nevolution.\n", "  We present here results from the X-ray timing and spectral analysis of the\nX-ray binary Cyg X-3 using observations from Large Area X-ray Proportional\nCounter (LAXPC) on-board AstroSat. Consecutive lightcurves observed over a\nperiod of one year show the binary orbital period of 17253.56 +/- 0.19 sec.\nAnother low-amplitude, slow periodicity of the order of 35.8 +/- 1.4 days is\nobserved which may be due to the orbital precession as suggested earlier by\nMolteni et al. (1980). During the rising binary phase, power density spectra\nfrom different observations during flaring hard X-ray state show quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) at ~5-8 mHz, ~12-14 mHz, ~18-24 mHz frequencies at the\nminimum confidence of 99%. However, during the consecutive binary decay phase,\nno QPO is detected up to 2-sigma significance. Energy-dependent time-lag\nspectra show soft lag (soft photons lag hard photons) at the mHz QPO frequency\nand the fractional rms of the QPO increases with the photon energy. During the\nbinary motion, the observation of mHz QPOs during the rising phase of the\nflaring hard state may be linked to the increase in the supply of the accreting\nmaterial in the disk and corona via stellar wind from the companion star.\nDuring the decay phase, the compact source moves in the outer wind region\ncausing the decrease in the supply of material for accretion. This may cause\nweakening of the mHz QPOs below the detection limit. This is also consistent\nwith the preliminary analysis of the orbital phase-resolved energy spectra\npresented in this paper.\n", "  We investigate the relation between the dynamics of a single oscillator with\ndelayed self-feedback and a feed-forward ring of such oscillators, where each\nunit is coupled to its next neighbor in the same way as in the self-feedback\ncase. We show that periodic solutions of the delayed oscillator give rise to\nfamilies of rotating waves with different wave numbers in the corresponding\nring. In particular, if for the single oscillator the periodic solution is\nresonant to the delay, it can be embedded into a ring with instantaneous\ncouplings. We discover several cases where stability of periodic solution for\nthe single unit can be related to the stability of the corresponding rotating\nwave in the ring. As a specific example we demonstrate how the complex\nbifurcation scenario of simultaneously emerging multi-jittering solutions can\nbe transferred from a single oscillator with delayed pulse feedback to\nmulti-jittering rotating waves in a sufficiently large ring of oscillators with\ninstantaneous pulse coupling. Finally, we present an experimental realization\nof this dynamical phenomenon in a system of coupled electronic circuits of\nFitzHugh-Nagumo type.\n", "  $^{111}$Ag and $^{113}$Ag were produced in induced fission reaction, where\nyrast and near-yrast states were populated. To interpret the new data the\nInteracting Boson-Fermion model was used. A good agreement with the\nexperimental data is achieved, suggesting that the two Ag nuclei have a well\ndeveloped collectivity, superimposed on $\\pi g_{9/2}^{-3}$ excitations\npreviously observed throughout the entire isotopic chain.\n", "  It has often been proposed that the formation of large-scale motion (or\nbulges) is a consequence of successive mergers and/or growth of near-wall\nhairpin vortices. In the present study, we report our direct observation that\nlarge-scale motion is generated by an instability of an `amplified' streaky\nmotion in the outer region (i.e. very-large-scale motion). We design a\nnumerical experiment in turbulent channel flow up to $Re_\\tau\\simeq 2000$ where\na streamwise-uniform streaky motion is artificially driven by body forcing in\nthe outer region computed from the previous linear theory (Hwang \\& Cossu, J.\nFluid Mech., vol. 664, 2015, pp. 51--73). As the forcing amplitude is\nincreased, it is found that an energetic streamwise vortical structure emerges\nat a streamwise wavelength of $\\lambda_x/h\\simeq 1-5$ ($h$ is the half-height\nof the channel). The application of dynamic mode decomposition and the\nexamination of turbulence statistics reveal that this structure is a\nconsequence of the sinuous-mode instability of the streak, a sub-process of the\nself-sustaining mechanism of the large-scale outer structures. It is also found\nthat the statistical features of the vortical structure are remarkably similar\nto those of the large-scale motion in the outer region. Finally, it is proposed\nthat the largest streamwise length of the streak instability determines the\nstreamwise length scale of very-large-scale motion.\n", "  Solar granules are bright patterns surrounded by dark channels called\nintergranular lanes in the solar photosphere and are a manifestation of\novershooting convection. Observational studies generally find stronger upflows\nin granules and weaker downflows in intergranular lanes. This trend is,\nhowever, inconsistent with the results of numerical simulations in which\ndownflows are stronger than upflows through the joint action of gravitational\nacceleration/deceleration and pressure gradients. One cause of this discrepancy\nis the image degradation caused by optical distortion and light diffraction and\nscattering that takes place in an imaging instrument. We apply a deconvolution\ntechnique to Hinode/SP data in an attempt to recover the original solar scene.\nOur results show a significant enhancement in both, the convective upflows and\ndownflows, but particularly for the latter. After deconvolution, the up- and\ndownflows reach maximum amplitudes of -3.0 km/s and +3.0 km/s at an average\ngeometrical height of roughly 50 km, respectively. We found that the velocity\ndistributions after deconvolution match those derived from numerical\nsimulations. After deconvolution the net LOS velocity averaged over the whole\nFOV lies close to zero as expected in a rough sense from mass balance.\n", "  We present an extremely deep CO(1-0) observation of a confirmed $z=1.62$\ngalaxy cluster. We detect two spectroscopically confirmed cluster members in\nCO(1-0) with $S/N>5$. Both galaxies have log(${\\cal M_{\\star}}$/\\msol)$>11$ and\nare gas rich, with ${\\cal M}_{\\rm mol}$/(${\\cal M_{\\star}}+{\\cal M}_{\\rm\nmol}$)$\\sim 0.17-0.45$. One of these galaxies lies on the star formation rate\n(SFR)-${\\cal M_{\\star}}$ sequence while the other lies an order of magnitude\nbelow. We compare the cluster galaxies to other SFR-selected galaxies with CO\nmeasurements and find that they have CO luminosities consistent with\nexpectations given their infrared luminosities. We also find that they have\ncomparable gas fractions and star formation efficiencies (SFE) to what is\nexpected from published field galaxy scaling relations. The galaxies are\ncompact in their stellar light distribution, at the extreme end for all high\nredshift star-forming galaxies. However, their SFE is consistent with other\nfield galaxies at comparable compactness. This is similar to two other sources\nselected in a blind CO survey of the HDF-N. Despite living in a highly quenched\nproto-cluster core, the molecular gas properties of these two galaxies, one of\nwhich may be in the processes of quenching, appear entirely consistent with\nfield scaling relations between the molecular gas content, stellar mass, star\nformation rate, and redshift. We speculate that these cluster galaxies cannot\nhave any further substantive gas accretion if they are to become members of the\ndominant passive population in $z<1$ clusters.\n", "  We examine the z = 0 group-integrated stellar and cold baryonic (stars + cold\natomic gas) mass functions (group SMF and CBMF) and the baryonic collapse\nefficiency (group cold baryonic to dark matter halo mass ratio) using the\nRESOLVE and ECO survey galaxy group catalogs and a galform semi-analytic model\n(SAM) mock catalog. The group SMF and CBMF fall off more steeply at high masses\nand rise with a shallower low-mass slope than the theoretical halo mass\nfunction (HMF). The transition occurs at group-integrated cold baryonic mass\nM_coldbary ~ 10^11 Msun. The SAM, however, has significantly fewer groups at\nthe transition mass ~ 10^11 Msun and a steeper low-mass slope than the data,\nsuggesting that feedback is too weak in low-mass halos and conversely too\nstrong near the transition mass. Using literature prescriptions to include hot\nhalo gas and potential unobservable galaxy gas produces a group BMF with slope\nsimilar to the HMF even below the transition mass. Its normalization is lower\nby a factor of ~2, in agreement with estimates of warm-hot gas making up the\nremaining difference. We compute baryonic collapse efficiency with the halo\nmass calculated two ways, via halo abundance matching (HAM) and via dynamics\n(extended all the way to three-galaxy groups using stacking). Using HAM, we\nfind that baryonic collapse efficiencies reach a flat maximum for groups across\nthe halo mass range of M_halo ~ 10^11.4-12 Msun, which we label \"nascent\ngroups.\" Using dynamics, however, we find greater scatter in baryonic collapse\nefficiencies, likely indicating variation in group hot-to-cold baryon ratios.\nSimilarly, we see higher scatter in baryonic collapse efficiencies in the SAM\nwhen using its true groups and their group halo masses as opposed to\nfriends-of-friends groups and HAM masses.\n", "  Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a new population recently\ndiscovered in the \\wise All-Sky survey. Multiwavelength follow-up observations\nsuggest that they are luminous, dust-obscured quasars at high redshift. Here we\npresent the JCMT SCUBA-2 850 $\\mu m$ follow-up observations of 10 Hot DOGs.\nFour out of ten Hot DOGs have been detected at $>3\\sigma$ level. Based on the\nIR SED decomposition approach, we derive the IR luminosities of AGN torus and\ncold dust components. Hot DOGs in our sample are extremely luminous with most\nof them having $L_{\\rm IR}^{\\rm tot}>10^{14} L_\\odot$. The torus emissions\ndominate the total IR energy output. However, the cold dust contribution is\nstill non-negligible, with the fraction of the cold dust contribution to the\ntotal IR luminosity $(\\sim 8-24\\%)$ being dependent on the choice of torus\nmodel. The derived cold dust temperatures in Hot DOGs are comparable to those\nin UV bright quasars with similar IR luminosity, but much higher than those in\nSMGs. Higher dust temperatures in Hot DOGs may be due to the more intense\nradiation field caused by intense starburst and obscured AGN activities.\nFourteen and five submillimeter serendipitous sources in the 10 SCUBA-2 fields\naround Hot DOGs have been detected at $>3\\sigma$ and $>3.5\\sigma$ levels,\nrespectively. By estimating their cumulative number counts, we confirm the\nprevious argument that Hot DOGs lie in dense environments. Our results support\nthe scenario in which Hot DOGs are luminous, dust-obscured quasars lying in\ndense environments, and being in the transition phase between extreme starburst\nand UV-bright quasars.\n", "  Scalar, vector and tensor harmonics on the three-sphere were introduced\noriginally to facilitate the study of various problems in gravitational\nphysics. These harmonics are defined as eigenfunctions of the covariant Laplace\noperator which satisfy certain divergence and trace identities, and\northo-normality conditions. This paper provides a summary of these properties,\nalong with a new notation that simplifies and clarifies some of the key\nexpressions. Practical methods are described for accurately and efficiently\ncomputing these harmonics numerically, and test results are given that\nillustrate how well the analytical identities are satisfied by the harmonics\ncomputed numerically in this way.\n", "  One way of imaging X-ray emission from solar flares is to measure Fourier\ncomponents of the spatial X-ray source distribution. We present a new\nCompressed Sensing-based algorithm named VIS_CS, which reconstructs the spatial\ndistribution from such Fourier components. We demonstrate the application of\nthe algorithm on synthetic and observed solar flare X-ray data from the Reuven\nRamaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite and compare\nits performance with existing algorithms. VIS_CS produces competitive results\nwith accurate photometry and morphology, without requiring any algorithm- and\nX-ray source-specific parameter tuning. Its robustness and performance make\nthis algorithm ideally suited for generation of quicklook images or large image\ncubes without user intervention, such as for imaging spectroscopy analysis.\n", "  We report transport studies of Mn-doped Bi2Te3 topological insulator (TI)\nfilms with accurately controlled thickness grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We\nfind that films thicker than 5 quintuple-layer (QL) exhibit the usual anomalous\nHall effect for magnetic TIs. When the thickness is reduced to 4 QL, however,\ncharacteristic features associated with the topological Hall effect (THE)\nemerge. More surprisingly, the THE vanishes again when the film thickness is\nfurther reduced to 3 QL. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the coupling\nbetween the top and bottom surface states at the dimensional crossover regime\nstabilizes the magnetic skyrmion structure that is responsible for the THE.\n", "  The young planetary system {\\beta} Pictoris is surrounded by a circumstellar\ndisk of dust and gas. Because both dust and gas have a lifetime shorter than\nthe system age, they need to be replenished continuously. The gas composition\nis partly known, but its location and its origin are still a puzzle. The gas\nsource could be the exocomets (or so-called falling and evaporating bodies,\nFEBs), which are observed as transient features in absorption lines of\nrefractory elements (Mg, Ca, and Fe) when they transit in front of the star at\nseveral tens of stellar radii.\n  Nearly 1700 high-resolution spectra of {\\beta} Pictoris have been obtained\nfrom 2003 to 2015 using the HARPS spectrograph. In these spectra, the\ncircumstellar disk is always detected as a stable component among the numerous\nvariable absorption signatures of transiting exocomets.\n  Summing all the 1700 spectra allowed us to reach a signal-to-noise ratio\nhigher than 1000, which is an unprecedentedly high number for a {\\beta}\nPictoris spectrum. It revealed many weak Fe I absorption lines of the\ncircumstellar gas in more than ten excited states. These weak lines bring new\ninformation on the physical properties of the neutral iron gas in the\ncircumstellar disk. The population of the first excited levels follows a\nBoltzmann distribution with a slope consistent with a gas temperature of about\n1300 K; this temperature corresponds to a distance to the star of ~ 38 RStar\nand implies a turbulence of {\\xi} ~ 0.8 km/s.\n", "  Recent work has suggested that mid-IR wavelengths are optimal for estimating\nthe mass-to-light ratios of stellar populations and hence the stellar masses of\ngalaxies. We compare stellar masses deduced from spectral energy distribution\n(SED) models, fitted to multi-wavelength optical-NIR photometry, to\nluminosities derived from {\\it WISE} photometry in the $W1$ and $W2$ bands at\n3.6 and 4.5$\\mu$m for non-star forming galaxies. The SED derived masses for a\ncarefully selected sample of low redshift ($z \\le 0.15$) passive galaxies agree\nwith the prediction from stellar population synthesis models that $M_*/L_{W1}\n\\simeq 0.6$ for all such galaxies, independent of other stellar population\nparameters. The small scatter between masses predicted from the optical SED and\nfrom the {\\it WISE} measurements implies that random errors (as opposed to\nsystematic ones such as the use of different IMFs) are smaller than previous,\ndeliberately conservative, estimates for the SED fits. This test is subtly\ndifferent from simultaneously fitting at a wide range of optical and mid-IR\nwavelengths, which may just generate a compromise fit: we are directly checking\nthat the best fit model to the optical data generates an SED whose $M_*/L_{W1}$\nis also consistent with separate mid-IR data. We confirm that for passive low\nredshift galaxies a fixed $M_*/L_{W1} = 0.65$ can generate masses at least as\naccurate as those obtained from more complex methods. Going beyond the mean\nvalue, in agreement with expectations from the models, we see a modest change\nin $M_*/L_{W1}$ with SED fitted stellar population age but an insignificant one\nwith metallicity.\n", "  We analyze 3 mm emission of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220 for\nspatially-resolved structure and spectral properties of the merger nuclei. ALMA\narchival data at ~0.05\" resolution are used for extensive visibility fitting\nand deep imaging of continuum emission. The data are fitted well with two\nconcentric components for each nucleus, such as two Gaussians or one Gaussian\nplus one exponential disk. The larger components in individual nuclei are\nsimilar in shape and extent, ~100-150 pc, to the cm-wave emission due to\nsupernovae. They are therefore identified with the known starburst nuclear\ndisks. The smaller components in both nuclei have about a few 10 pc sizes and\npeak brightness temperatures (Tb) more than twice higher than in previous\nsingle-Gaussian fitting. They correspond to the dust emission that we find\ncentrally concentrated in both nuclei by subtracting the plasma emission\nmeasured at 33 GHz. The dust emission in the western nucleus is found to have a\npeak Tb ~ 530 K and a full width at half maximum of about 20 pc. This component\nis estimated to have a bolometric luminosity on the order of 10^{12.5} Lsun and\na 20 pc-scale luminosity surface density 10^{15.5} Lsun/kpc^2. A luminous AGN\nis a plausible energy source for these high values while other explanations\nremain to be explored. Our continuum image also reveals a third structural\ncomponent of the western nucleus --- a pair of faint spurs perpendicular to the\ndisk major axis. We attribute it to a bipolar outflow from the highly inclined\n(i ~ 60 deg) western nuclear disk.\n", "  Streaming instability is a powerful mechanism which concentrates dust grains\nin pro- toplanetary discs, eventually up to the stage where they collapse\ngravitationally and form planetesimals. Previous studies inferred that it\nshould be ineffective in viscous discs, too efficient in inviscid discs, and\nmay not operate in local pressure maxima where solids accumulate. From a linear\nanalysis of stability, we show that streaming instability behaves differently\ninside local pressure maxima. Under the action of the strong differential\nadvection imposed by the bump, a novel unstable mode develops and grows even\nwhen gas viscosity is large. Hence, pressure bumps are found to be the only\nplaces where streaming instability occurs in viscous discs. This offers a\npromising way to conciliate models of planet formation with recent observations\nof young discs.\n", "  This paper is concerned with algorithms for calibration of direction\ndependent effects (DDE) in aperture synthesis radio telescopes (ASRT). After\ncorrection of Direction Independent Effects (DIE) using self-calibration,\nimaging performance can be limited by the imprecise knowledge of the forward\ngain of the elements in the array. In general, the forward gain pattern is\ndirectionally dependent and varies with time due to a number of reasons. Some\nfactors, such as rotation of the primary beam with Parallactic Angle for\nAzimuth-Elevation mount antennas are known a priori. Some, such as antenna\npointing errors and structural deformation/projection effects for\naperture-array elements cannot be measured {\\em a priori}. Thus, in addition to\nalgorithms to correct for DD effects known a priori, algorithms to solve for DD\ngains are required for high dynamic range imaging. Here, we discuss a\nmathematical framework for antenna-based DDE calibration algorithms and show\nthat this framework leads to computationally efficient optimal algorithms which\nscale well in a parallel computing environment. As an example of an\nantenna-based DD calibration algorithm, we demonstrate the Pointing SelfCal\nalgorithm to solve for the antenna pointing errors. Our analysis show that the\nsensitivity of modern ASRT is sufficient to solve for antenna pointing errors\nand other DD effects. We also discuss the use of the Pointing SelfCal algorithm\nin real-time calibration systems and extensions for antenna Shape SelfCal\nalgorithm for real-time tracking and corrections for pointing offsets and\nchanges in antenna shape.\n", "  We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long Swift\nGRB 120327A afterglow data to investigate the possible causes of the observed\nearly time colour variations. We collected data from various\ninstruments/telescopes in different bands (X-rays, ultra- violet, optical and\nnear-infrared) and determined the shapes of the afterglow early-time light\ncurves. We studied the overall temporal behaviour and the spectral energy\ndistributions from early to late times. The ultra-violet, optical, and\nnear-infrared light curves can be modelled with a single power-law component\nbetween 200 and 2e4 s after the burst event. The X-ray light curve shows a\ncanonical steep-shallow-steep behaviour, typical of long gamma-ray bursts. At\nearly times a colour variation is observed in the ultra-violet/optical bands,\nwhile at very late times a hint of a re-brightening is visible. The observed\nearly time colour change can be explained as a variation in the intrinsic\noptical spectral index, rather than an evolution of the optical extinction.\n", "  Some connections between different definitions of Levy Laplacians in the\nstochastic analysis are considered. Two approaches are used to define these\noperators. The standard one is based on the application of the theory of\nSobolev-Schwartz distributions over the Wiener measure (the Hida calculus). One\ncan consider the chain of Levy Laplacians parametrized by a real parameter with\nthe help of this approach. One of the elements of this chain is the classical\nLevy Laplacian. Another approach to define the Levy Laplacian is based on the\napplication of the theory of Sobolev spaces over the Wiener measure (the\nMalliavin calculus). It is proved that the Levy Laplacian defined with the help\nof the second approach coincides with one of the elements of the chain of Levy\nLaplacians, which is not the classical Levy Laplacian, under the imbedding of\nthe Sobolev space over the Wiener measure into the space of generalized\nfunctionals over this measure. It is shown which Levy Laplacian in the\nstochastic analysis is connected to the gauge fields.\n", "  We present ALMA Cycle 4 observations of CO(1-0), CO(3-2), and $^{13}$CO(3-2)\nline emission in the brightest cluster galaxy of RXJ0821+0752. This is one of\nthe first detections of $^{13}$CO line emission in a galaxy cluster. Half of\nthe CO(3-2) line emission originates from two clumps of molecular gas that are\nspatially offset from the galactic center. These clumps are surrounded by\ndiffuse emission that extends $8~{\\rm kpc}$ in length. The detected $^{13}$CO\nemission is confined entirely to the two bright clumps, with any emission\noutside of this region lying below our detection threshold. Two distinct\nvelocity components with similar integrated fluxes are detected in the\n$^{12}$CO spectra. The narrower component ($60~{\\rm km}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$ FWHM) is\nconsistent in both velocity centroid and linewidth with $^{13}$CO(3-2)\nemission, while the broader ($130-160~{\\rm km}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$), slightly\nblueshifted wing has no associated $^{13}$CO(3-2) emission. A simple local\nthermodynamic model indicates that the $^{13}$CO emission traces $2.1\\times\n10^{9}~{\\rm M}_\\odot$ of molecular gas. Isolating the $^{12}$CO velocity\ncomponent that accompanies the $^{13}$CO emission yields a CO-to-H$_2$\nconversion factor of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=2.3~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}~({\\rm\nK~km~s^{-1}})^{-1}$, which is a factor of two lower than the Galactic value.\nAdopting the Galactic CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor in brightest cluster\ngalaxies may therefore overestimate their molecular gas masses by a factor of\ntwo. This is within the object-to-object scatter from extragalactic sources, so\ncalibrations in a larger sample of clusters are necessary in order to confirm a\nsub-Galactic conversion factor.\n", "  Density profiles of isolated cores derived from thermal dust continuum\nemission rely on models of dust properties, such as mass opacity, which are\npoorly constrained. With complementary measures from near-infrared extinction\nmaps, we can assess the reliability of commonly-used dust models. In this work,\nwe compare Herschel-derived maps of the optical depth with equivalent maps\nderived from CFHT WIRCAM near-infrared observations for three isolated cores:\nCB68, L429, and L1552. We assess the dust opacities provided from four models:\nOH1a, OH5a, Orm1, and Orm4. Although the consistency of the models differs\nbetween the three sources, the results suggest that the optical properties of\ndust in the envelopes of the cores are best described by either silicate and\nbare graphite grains (e.g., Orm1) or carbonaceous grains with some coagulation\nand either thin or no ice mantles (e.g., OH5a). None of the models, however,\nindividually produced the most consistent optical depth maps for every source.\nThe results suggest that either the dust in the cores is not well described by\nany one dust property model, the application of the dust models cannot be\nextended beyond the very center of the cores, or more complex SED fitting\nfunctions are necessary.\n", "  In a recent work based on 3200 stacked H$\\alpha$ maps of galaxies at $z \\sim\n1$, Nelson et al.~find evidence for `coherent star formation': the stacked SFR\nprofiles of galaxies above (below) the 'star formation main sequence' (MS) are\nabove (below) that of galaxies on the MS at all radii. One might interpret this\nresult as inconsistent with highly bursty star formation and evidence that\ngalaxies evolve smoothly along the MS rather than crossing it many times. We\nanalyze six simulated galaxies at $z\\sim1$ from the Feedback in Realistic\nEnvironments (FIRE) project in a manner analogous to the observations to test\nwhether the above interpretations are correct. The trends in stacked SFR\nprofiles are qualitatively consistent with those observed. However, SFR\nprofiles of individual galaxies are much more complex than the stacked\nprofiles: the former can be flat or even peak at large radii because of the\nhighly clustered nature of star formation in the simulations. Moreover, the SFR\nprofiles of individual galaxies above (below) the MS are not systematically\nabove (below) those of MS galaxies at all radii. We conclude that the\ntime-averaged coherent star formation evident stacks of observed galaxies is\nconsistent with highly bursty, clumpy star formation of individual galaxies and\nis not evidence that galaxies evolve smoothly along the MS.\n", "  We test the galactic outflow model by probing associated galaxies of four\nstrong intergalactic CIV absorbers at $z=5$--6 using the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) ACS ramp narrowband filters. The four strong CIV absorbers reside at\n$z=5.74$, $5.52$, $4.95$, and $4.87$, with column densities ranging from\n$N_{\\rm{CIV}}=10^{13.8}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $10^{14.8}$ cm$^{-2}$. At $z=5.74$, we\ndetect an i-dropout Ly$\\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidate with a projected impact\nparameter of 42 physical kpc from the CIV absorber. This LAE candidate has a\nLy$\\alpha$-based star formation rate (SFR$_{\\rm{Ly\\alpha}}$) of 2 $M_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$ and a UV-based SFR of 4 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Although we cannot\ncompletely rule out that this $i$-dropout emitter may be an [OII] interloper,\nits measured properties are consistent with the CIV powering galaxy at\n$z=5.74$. For CIV absorbers at $z=4.95$ and $z=4.87$, although we detect two\nLAE candidates with impact parameters of 160 kpc and 200 kpc, such distances\nare larger than that predicted from the simulations. Therefore we treat them as\nnon-detections. For the system at $z=5.52$, we do not detect LAE candidates,\nplacing a 3-$\\sigma$ upper limit of SFR$_{\\rm{Ly\\alpha}}\\approx 1.5\\ M_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$. In summary, in these four cases, we only detect one plausible CIV\nsource at $z=5.74$. Combining the modest SFR of the one detection and the three\nnon-detections, our HST observations strongly support that smaller galaxies\n(SFR$_{\\rm{Ly\\alpha}} \\lesssim 2\\ M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are main sources of\nintergalactic CIV absorbers, and such small galaxies play a major role in the\nmetal enrichment of the intergalactic medium at $z\\gtrsim5$.\n", "  WASP-12 is a hot Jupiter system with an orbital period of $P= 1.1\\textrm{\nday}$, making it one of the shortest-period giant planets known. Recent transit\ntiming observations by Maciejewski et al. (2016) and Patra et al. (2017) find a\ndecreasing period with $P/|\\dot{P}| = 3.2\\textrm{ Myr}$. This has been\ninterpreted as evidence of either orbital decay due to tidal dissipation or a\nlong term oscillation of the apparent period due to apsidal precession. Here we\nconsider the possibility that it is orbital decay. We show that the parameters\nof the host star are consistent with either a $M_\\ast \\simeq 1.3 M_\\odot$ main\nsequence star or a $M_\\ast \\simeq 1.2 M_\\odot$ subgiant. We find that if the\nstar is on the main sequence, the tidal dissipation is too inefficient to\nexplain the observed $\\dot{P}$. However, if it is a subgiant, the tidal\ndissipation is significantly enhanced due to nonlinear wave breaking of the\ndynamical tide near the star's center. The subgiant models have a tidal quality\nfactor $Q_\\ast'\\simeq 2\\times10^5$ and an orbital decay rate that agrees well\nwith the observed $\\dot{P}$. It would also explain why the planet survived for\n$\\simeq 3\\textrm{ Gyr}$ while the star was on the main sequence and yet is now\ninspiraling on a 3 Myr timescale. Although this suggests that we are witnessing\nthe last $\\sim 0.1\\%$ of the planet's life, the probability of such a detection\nis a few percent given the observed sample of $\\simeq 30$ hot Jupiters in\n$P<3\\textrm{ day}$ orbits around $M_\\ast>1.2 M_\\odot$ hosts.\n", "  We present magnitudes and profile fits for 180 galaxies in the central field\nof the massive lensing cluster Abell 1689 using very deep imaging with the\nACS/HST in the F814W bandpass. Previous work revealed an exceptionally large\nnumber of globular clusters (GCs) in A1689 and mapped their number density\ndistribution. We decompose this number density map into GCs associated with\nindividual cluster galaxies and ICGCs (intracluster globular clusters)\nassociated with the intracluster light (ICL). In all, we measure GC specific\nfrequencies $S_N$ for 33 cluster members and the ICL. The relation between\n$S_N$ and galaxy magnitude is consistent with the trend observed in Virgo,\nalthough some intermediate luminosity galaxies scatter to $S_N>10$. We estimate\nthe ICL makes up 11% of the starlight in this field, whereas the ICGCs account\nfor $\\sim\\,$35% of the GCs, both consistent with predictions from simulations.\nGalaxies with higher $S_N$ values tend to be rounder, and there is a marginally\nsignificant trend of decreasing $S_N$ with increasing specific angular momenta\n$\\lambda_R$. We also reevaluate the GC population in the A2744 Frontier Field,\nfor which fewer than one-tenth as many GCs have been detected because of its\nlarger distance. Finally, our core-S\\'ersic fit to the light profile of the\nA1689 BCG implies a break radius of 3.8kpc, among the largest known; we discuss\nimplications of the sizable core and extensive GC population for the\nsupermassive black hole in light of scaling relations.\n", "  One of the major unsolved questions on the understanding of the AGN\npopulation is the origin of the dichotomy between radio-quiet and radio-loud\nquasars. The most promising explanation is provided by the spin paradigm, which\nsuggests radio-loud quasars have higher black hole spin. However, the\nmeasurement of black hole spin remains extremely challenging. We here aim at\ncomparing the mean radiative efficiencies of carefully matched samples of\nradio-loud and radio-quiet SDSS quasars at 0.3<z<0.8. We use the [OIII]\nluminosity as an indirect average tracer of the ionizing continuum in the\nextreme-UV regime where differences in the SED due to black hole spin are most\npronounced. We find that the radio-loud sample shows an enhancement in [OIII]\nline strength by a factor of at least 1.5 compared to a radio-quiet sample\nmatched in redshift, black hole mass and optical continuum luminosity or\naccretion rate. We argue that this enhancement is caused by differences in the\nSED, suggesting higher average bolometric luminosities at fixed accretion rate\nin the radio-loud population. This suggests that the radio-loud quasar\npopulation has on average systematically larger radiative efficiencies and\ntherefore higher black hole spin than the radio-quiet population, providing\nobservational support for the black hole spin paradigm.\n", "  Casimir forces between material surfaces at close proximity of less than 200\nnm can lead to increased chaotic behavior of actuating devices depending on the\nstrength of the Casimir interaction. We investigate these phenomena for phase\nchange materials in torsional oscillators, where the amorphous to crystalline\nphase transitions lead to transitions between high and low Casimir force and\ntorque states respectively, without material compositions. For a conservative\nsystem bifurcation curve and Poincare maps analysis show the absence of chaotic\nbehavior but with the crystalline phase (high force/torque state) favoring more\nunstable behavior and stiction. However, for a non-conservative system chaotic\nbehavior can occur introducing significant risk for stiction, which is again\nmore pronounced for the crystalline phase. The latter illustrates the more\ngeneral scenario that stronger Casimir forces and torques increase the\npossibility for chaotic behavior. The latter is making impossible to predict\nwhether stiction or stable actuation will occur on a long term basis, and it is\nsetting limitations in the design of micro/nano devices operating at short\nrange nanoscale separations.\n", "  We report the detection of CO(J=2-1) coincident with the super star cluster\n(SSC) Mrk 71-A in the nearby Green Pea analog galaxy, NGC 2366. Our NOEMA\nobservations reveal a compact, ~7 pc, molecular cloud whose mass (10^5 M_sun)\nis similar to that of the SSC, consistent with a high star-formation\nefficiency, on the order of 0.5. There are two, spatially distinct components\nseparated by 11 km/s. If expanding, these could be due to momentum-driven,\nstellar wind feedback. Alternatively, we may be seeing the remnant infalling,\ncolliding clouds responsible for triggering the SSC formation. The kinematics\nare also consistent with a virialized system. These extreme, high-density,\nstar-forming conditions inhibit energy-driven feedback; the co-spatial\nexistence of a massive, molecular cloud with the SSC supports this scenario,\nand we quantitatively confirm that any wind-driven feedback in Mrk 71-A is\nmomentum-driven, rather than energy-driven. Since Mrk 71-A is a candidate Lyman\ncontinuum emitter, this implies that energy-driven superwinds may not be a\nnecessary condition for the escape of ionizing radiation. In addition, the\ndetection of the nebular continuum emission yields an accurate astrometric\nposition for the Mrk 71-A. We also detect four other massive, molecular clouds\nin this giant star-forming complex.\n", "  We calculate the total cross sections and probabilities of electromagnetic\nproductions of electron, muon and tauon pair productions simultaneously. At the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC), the available electromagnetic energy is sufficient\nto produce all kind of leptons coherently. The masses of muon and tauon are\nlarge, so their Compton wavelengths are small enough to interact with the\ncolliding nuclei. Therefore, the realistic nuclear form factors are included in\nthe calculations of electromagnetic pair productions. The cross section\ncalculations show that, at the LHC energies, the probabilities of simultaneous\nproductions of all kind of leptons are increased significantly compare to the\nRHIC energies. Experimentally, observing this simultaneous production can give\nus important informations about the strong QED.\n", "  Comet C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) was discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Survey on\n2017 May 21 at a distance 16.09 au from the Sun, the second most distant\ndiscovery of an active comet. Pre-discovery images in the PS1 archive back to\n2014 and additional deep CFHT images between 2013 May 10-13 showed the comet to\nbe active at 23.75 au. We derive an upper limit to the nucleus radius of\n$R_N$=80 km, assuming a 4\\% albedo. The spectral reflectivity of the comet\nsurface is similar to \"fresh\" regions seen on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko\nusing the $Rosetta$ OSIRIS camera. Pre-discovery photometry combined with new\ndata obtained with Megacam on the CFHT show that the activity is consistent\nwith CO-ice sublimation and inconsistent with CO$_2$-ice sublimation. The ice\nsublimation models were run out to perihelion in 2022 at 1.8 au to predict the\nCO production rates, assuming that the outgassing area does not change.\nAssuming a canonical 4\\% active surface area for water-ice sublimation, we\npresent production rate ratios, $Q_{\\rm CO}$/$Q_{\\rm H2O}$, for a range of\nnucleus sizes. Comparing these results with other CO-rich comets we derive a\nlower limit to the nucleus radius of $\\sim$14 km. We present predictions for\n$Q_{\\rm CO}$ at a range of distances that will be useful for planning\nobservations with JWST and large ground-based facilities.\n", "  When modeling astronomical objects throughout the universe, it is important\nto correctly treat the limitations of the data, for instance finite resolution\nand sensitivity. In order to simulate these effects, and to make radiative\ntransfer models directly comparable to real observations, we have developed an\nopen-source Python package called the FluxCompensator that enables the\npost-processing of the output of 3-d Monte-Carlo radiative transfer codes, such\nas HYPERION. With the FluxCompensator, realistic synthetic observations can be\ngenerated by modelling the effects of convolution with arbitrary point-spread\nfunctions (PSFs), transmission curves, finite pixel resolution, noise and\nreddening. Pipelines can be applied to compute synthetic observations that\nsimulate observatories, such as the Spitzer Space Telescope or the Herschel\nSpace Observatory. Additionally, this tool can read in existing observations\n(e.g. FITS format) and use the same settings for the synthetic observations. In\nthis paper, we describe the package as well as present examples of such\nsynthetic observations.\n", "  We present a general model allowing \"quantum simulation\" of one-dimensional\nDirac models with 2- and 4-component spinors using ultracold atoms in driven 1D\ntilted optical latices. The resulting Dirac physics is illustrated by one of\nits well-known manifestations, Zitterbewegung. This general model can be\nextended and applied with great flexibility to more complex situations.\n", "  The experimentally observed disappearance below T = 0.5K of the second sound\nin liquid He II as a separate wave mode and its subsequent propagation at the\nspeed of the first sound (Peshkov [3]) may be interpreted as a resonant mode\nconversion of the second sound to the first sound. Near the resonant mode\ncoupling point T = T*, where the frequencies of the two waves become equal, the\nanomalous effect of entropy changes on the first sound and density changes on\nthe second sound, though generally small, become significant. This leads to the\nresonant mode coupling of the first sound and the second sound and forces them\nto lose their identities and hence pave the way for the resonant mode\nconversion of the second sound to the first sound. We give a theoretical\nframework for this proposition and an estimate for the fraction of the second\nsound that is mode-converted to the first sound.\n", "  Economic experiments have shown that punishment can increase public goods\ngame contributions over time. However, the effectiveness of punishment is\nchallenged by second-order freeriding and antisocial punishment. The latter\nimplies that non-cooperators punish cooperators, while the former implies\nunwillingness to shoulder the cost of punishment. Here we extend the theory of\ncooperation in the spatial public goods game by considering four competing\nstrategies, which are traditional cooperators and defectors, as well as\ncooperators who punish defectors and defectors who punish cooperators. We show\nthat if the synergistic effects are high enough to sustain cooperation based on\nnetwork reciprocity alone, antisocial punishment does not deter public\ncooperation. Conversely, if synergistic effects are low and punishment is\nactively needed to sustain cooperation, antisocial punishment does act\ndetrimental, but only if the cost-to-fine ratio is low. If the costs are\nrelatively high, cooperation again dominates as a result of spatial pattern\nformation. Counterintuitively, defectors who do not punish cooperators, and are\nthus effectively second-order freeriding on antisocial punishment, form an\nactive layer around punishing cooperators, which protects them against\ndefectors that punish cooperators. A stable three-strategy phase that is\nsustained by the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance is also possible via\nthe same route. The microscopic mechanism behind the reported evolutionary\noutcomes can be explained by the comparison of invasion rates that determine\nthe stability of subsystem solutions. Our results reveal an unlikely\nevolutionary escape from adverse effects of antisocial punishment, and they\nprovide a rationale for why second-order freeriding is not always an impediment\nto the evolutionary stability of punishment.\n", "  Interstellar extinction towards the Galactic Center is large and\nsignificantly differential. Its reddening and dimming effects in red clump\nstars in the Galactic Bulge can be exploited to better constrain the extinction\nlaw towards the innermost Galaxy. By virtue of a deep and complete catalog of\nmore than 30 million objets at $|l|\\le2.7\\deg$ and $|b|\\le1.55\\deg$ obtained\nfrom VVV survey observations, we apply the red clump method to infer the\nselective-to-total extinction ratios in the $Z$, $Y$, $J$, $H$ and $K_s$\nbroadband near-infrared filters. The measured values are smaller than\npreviously reported, and are not constant, with mean values, e.g.,\n$A_{K_S}/E(J-K_s)=0.428\\pm0.005\\pm0.04$ and\n$A_{K_S}/E(H-K_s)=1.104\\pm0.022\\pm0.2$. We also obtain a ratio\n$A_Z$:$A_Y$:$A_J$:$A_H$:$A_{K_S}$ of 7.74:5.38:3.30:1.88:1.0, implying\nextinction towards the Galactic Center to follow a distribution as a function\nof wavelength steeper than previously reported, consistent with a power law\n$A_{\\lambda}\\propto{\\lambda}^{-2.47}$ in the near-infrared.\n", "  This contributions discusses the simulation of magnetothermal effects in\nsuperconducting magnets as used in particle accelerators. An iterative coupling\nscheme using reduced order models between a magnetothermal partial differential\nmodel and an electrical lumped-element circuit is demonstrated. The\nmultiphysics, multirate and multiscale problem requires a consistent\nformulation and framework to tackle the challenging transient effects occurring\nat both system and device level.\n", "  We present Direct Numerical Simulations of the transport of heat and heavy\nelements across a double-diffusive interface or a double-diffusive staircase,\nin conditions that are close to those one may expect to find near the boundary\nbetween the heavy-element rich core and the hydrogen-helium envelope of giant\nplanets such as Jupiter. We find that the non-dimensional ratio of the buoyancy\nflux associated with heavy element transport to the buoyancy flux associated\nwith heat transport lies roughly between 0.5 and 1, which is much larger than\nprevious estimates derived by analogy with geophysical double-diffusive\nconvection. Using these results in combination with a core-erosion model\nproposed by Guillot et al. (2004), we find that the entire core of Jupiter\nwould be eroded within less than 1Myr assuming that the core-envelope boundary\nis composed of a single interface. We also propose an alternative model that is\nmore appropriate in the presence of a well-established double-diffusive\nstaircase, and find that in this limit a large fraction of the core could be\npreserved. These findings are interesting in the context of Juno's recent\nresults, but call for further modeling efforts to better understand the process\nof core erosion from first principles.\n", "  We report on interferometric observations of a face-on accretion system\naround the High-Mass young stellar object, G353.273+0.641. The innermost\naccretion system of 100 au radius was resolved in a 45 GHz continuum image\ntaken with the Jansky-Very Large Array. Our spectral energy distribution\nanalysis indicated that the continuum could be explained by optically thick\ndust emission. The total mass of the dusty system is $\\sim$ 0.2 $M_{\\sun}$ at\nminimum and up to a few $M_{\\sun}$ depending on the dust parameters. 6.7 GHz\nCH$_{3}$OH masers associated with the same system were also observed with the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array. The masers showed a spiral-like,\nnon-axisymmetric distribution with a systematic velocity gradient. The\nline-of-sight velocity field is explained by an infall motion along a parabolic\nstreamline that falls onto the equatorial plane of the face-on system. The\nstreamline is quasi-radial and reaches the equatorial plane at a radius of 16\nau. This is clearly smaller than that of typical accretion disks in High-Mass\nstar formation, indicating that the initial angular momentum was very small, or\nthe CH$_{3}$OH masers selectively trace accreting material that has small\nangular momentum. In the former case, the initial specific angular momentum is\nestimated to be 8 $\\times$ 10$^{20}$ ($M_{*}$$/$10 $M_{\\sun}$)$^{0.5}$ cm$^{2}$\ns$^{-1}$, or a significant fraction of the initial angular momentum was removed\noutside of 100 au. The physical origin of such a streamline is still an open\nquestion and will be constrained by the higher-resolution ($\\sim$ 10 mas)\nthermal continuum and line observations with ALMA long baselines.\n", "  (Abridged) Context: The assumption of a gas-to-dust mass ratio (\\gamma) is a\ncommon approach to estimate the basic properties of molecular clouds, such as\ntotal mass and column density of molecular hydrogen, from (sub)mm continuum\nobservations of the dust. In the Milky Way a single value is used at all\ngalactocentric radii, independently of the observed metallicity gradients. Both\nmodels and extragalactic observations suggest that this quantity increases for\ndecreasing metallicity Z, typical of the outer regions in disks, where fewer\nheavy elements are available to form dust grains.\n  Aims: We aim to investigate the variation of the gas-to-dust ratio as a\nfunction of galactocentric radius and metallicity, to allow a more accurate\ncharacterisation of the quantity of molecular gas across the galactic disk, as\nderived from observations of the dust.\n  Methods: Observations of the optically thin C\\$^{18}\\$O (2-1) transition were\nobtained with the APEX telescope for a sample of 23 massive and dense\nstar-forming regions in the far outer Galaxy (galactocentric distance greater\nthan 14 kpc). From the modelling of this line and of the spectral energy\ndistribution of the selected clumps we computed the gas-to-dust ratio and\ncompared it to that of well-studied sources from the ATLASGAL TOP100 sample in\nthe inner galactic disk.\n  Results: The gradient in gas-to-dust ratio is found to be 0.087 dex/kpc (or\nequivalently \\gamma\\ proportional to Z\\$^{-1.4}\\$). The dust-to-metal ratio,\ndecreases with galactocentric radius, which is the most common situation also\nfor external late-type galaxies. This suggests that grain growth dominates over\ndestruction. The predicted gas-to-dust ratio is in excellent agreement with the\nestimates in Magellanic clouds, for the appropriate value of Z.\n", "  Recently, the optical counterpart of a gravitational wave source GW170817 has\nbeen identified in NGC 4993 galaxy. Together with evidence from observations in\nelectromagnetic waves, the event has been suggested as a result of a merger of\ntwo neutron stars. We analyze the multi-wavelength data to characterize the\nhost galaxy property and its distance to examine if the properties of NGC 4993\nare consistent with this picture. Our analysis shows that NGC 4993 is a\nbulge-dominated galaxy with reff ~ 2-3 kpc and the Sersic index of n = 3-4 for\nthe bulge component. The spectral energy distribution from 0.15 to 24 micron\nindicates that this galaxy has no significant ongoing star formation, the mean\nstellar mass of (0.3 - 1.2) times 10^11 Msun,the mean stellar age greater than\n~3 Gyr, and the metallicity of about 20% to 100% of solar abundance. Optical\nimages reveal dust lanes and extended features that suggest a past merging\nactivity. Overall, NGC 4993 has characteristics of normal, but slightly\ndisturbed elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, we derive the distance to NGC 4993\nwith the fundamental plane relation using 17 parameter sets of 7 different\nfilters and the central stellar velocity dispersion from literature, finding an\nangular diameter distance of 37.7 +- 8.7 Mpc. NGC 4993 is similar to some host\ngalaxies of short gamma-ray bursts but much different from those of long\ngamma-ray bursts, supporting the picture of GW170817 as a result of a merger of\ntwo NSs.\n", "  We uncover and identify the regime for a magnetically and ferroelectrically\ncontrollable negative refraction of light traversing multiferroic, oxide-based\nmetastructure consisting of alternating nanoscopic ferroelectric (SrTiO$_2$)\nand ferromagnetic (Y$_3$Fe$_2$(FeO$_4$)$_3$, YIG) layers. We perform analytical\nand numerical simulations based on discretized, coupled equations for the\nself-consistent Maxwell/ferroelectric/ferromagnetic dynamics and obtain a\nbiquadratic relation for the refractive index. Various scenarios of ordinary\nand negative refraction in different frequency ranges are analyzed and\nquantified by simple analytical formula that are confirmed by full-fledge\nnumerical simulations. Electromagnetic-waves injected at the edges of the\nsample are propagated exactly numerically. We discovered that for particular\nGHz frequencies, waves with different polarizations are characterized by\ndifferent signs of the refractive index giving rise to novel types of phenomena\nsuch as a positive-negative birefringence effect, and magnetically controlled\nlight trapping and accelerations.\n", "  We present two state-of-the-art models of the solar system, one corresponding\nto the present day and one to the Archean Eon 3.5 billion years ago. Each model\ncontains spatial and spectral information for the star, the planets, and the\ninterplanetary dust, extending to 50 AU from the sun and covering the\nwavelength range 0.3 to 2.5 micron. In addition, we created a spectral image\ncube representative of the astronomical backgrounds that will be seen behind\ndeep observations of extrasolar planetary systems, including galaxies and Milky\nWay stars. These models are intended as inputs to high-fidelity simulations of\ndirect observations of exoplanetary systems using telescopes equipped with\nhigh-contrast capability. They will help improve the realism of observation and\ninstrument parameters that are required inputs to statistical observatory yield\ncalculations, as well as guide development of post-processing algorithms for\ntelescopes capable of directly imaging Earth-like planets.\n", "  The GRIFFIN spectrometer at TRIUMF-ISAC has been used to study excited states\nand transitions in $^{50}$Sc following the $\\beta$-decay of $^{50}$Ca.\nBranching ratios were determined from the measured $\\gamma$-ray intensities,\nand angular correlations of $\\gamma$ rays have been used to firmly assign the\nspins of excited states. The presence of an isomeric state that decays by an\n$M3$ transition with a $B(M3)$ strength of 13.6(7)\\,W.u. has been confirmed. We\ncompare with the first {\\it ab initio} calculations of $B(M3$) strengths in\nlight and medium-mass nuclei from the valence-space in-medium similarity\nrenormalization group approach, using consistently derived effective\nHamiltonians and $M3$ operator. The experimental data are well reproduced for\nisoscalar $M3$ transitions when using bare $g$-factors, but the strength of\nisovector $M3$ transitions are found to be underestimated by an order of\nmagnitude.\n", "  Spicules are the most ubuiquitous type of jets in the solar atmosphere. The\nadvent of high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy from the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and ground-based observatories has revealed the\npresence of very high apparent motions of order 100-300 km/s in spicules, as\nmeasured in the plane of the sky. However, line-of-sight measurements of such\nhigh speeds have been difficult to obtain, with values deduced from Doppler\nshifts in spectral lines typically of order 30-70 km/s. In this work we resolve\nthis long-standing discrepancy using recent 2.5D radiative MHD simulations.\nThis simulation has revealed a novel driving mechanism for spicules in which\nambipolar diffusion resulting from ion-neutral interactions plays a key role.\nIn our simulation we often see that the upward propagation of magnetic waves\nand electrical currents from the low chromosphere into already existing\nspicules can lead to rapid heating when the currents are rapidly dissipated by\nambipolar diffusion. The combination of rapid heating and the propagation of\nthese currents at Alfv\\'enic speeds in excess of 100 km/s leads to the very\nrapid apparent motions, and often wholesale appearance, of spicules at\nchromospheric and transition region temperatures. In our simulation, the\nobserved fast apparent motions in such jets are actually a signature of a\nheating front, and much higher than the mass flows, which are of order 30-70\nkm/s. Our results can explain the behavior of transition region \"network jets\"\nand the very high apparent speeds reported for some chromospheric spicules.\n", "  Impact-cratering processes on small bodies are thought to be mainly\ncontrolled by the local material strength because of their low surface gravity,\nand craters that are as large as the parent bodies should be affected by the\ntarget curvature. Although cratering processes on planar surfaces in the\nstrength-controlled regime have been studied extensively, the mechanism by\nwhich target curvature affects the cratering processes remains unclear. Herein,\nwe report on a series of impact experiments that used spherical targets with\nvarious diameters. The resultant craters consisted of a deep circular pit and\nan irregular-shaped spall region around the pit, which is consistent with the\nfeatures reported in a number of previous cratering experiments on planar\nsurfaces. However, the volume and radius of the craters increased with the\nnormalized curvature. The results indicate that the increase in the\nspall-region volume and radius mainly contributes to the increase in the whole\ncrater volume and radius, although the volume, depth, and radius of pits remain\nconstant with curvature. The results of our model indicate that the geometric\neffect due to curvature (i.e., whereby the distance from the equivalent center\nto the target free surface is shorter for higher curvature values) contributes\nto increases in the cratering efficiency. Our results suggest that the\nimpactors that produce the largest craters (basins) on some asteroids are thus\nsmaller than what is estimated by current scaling laws, which do not take into\naccount the curvature effects.\n", "  We report new experimental Fe I oscillator strengths obtained by combining\nmeasurements of branching fractions measured with a Fourier Transform\nspectrometer and time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence lifetimes. The study\ncovers the spectral region ranging from 213 to 1033 nm. A total of 120\nexperimental log(gf)-values coming from 15 odd-parity energy levels are\nprovided, 22 of which have not been reported previously and 63 values with\nlower uncertainty than the existing data. Radiative lifetimes for 60 upper\nenergy levels are presented, 39 of which have no previous measurements.\n", "  The radio source J1819+3845 underwent a period of extreme interstellar\nscintillation between circa 1999 and 2007. The plasma structure responsible for\nthis scintillation was determined to be just $1$-$3\\,$pc from the solar system\nand to posses a density of $n_e\\sim 10^2\\,$cm$^{-3}$ that is three orders of\nmagnitude higher than the ambient interstellar density (de Bruyn & Macquart\n2015). Here we present radio-polarimetric images of the field towards\nJ1819+3845 at wavelengths of 0.2, 0.92 and 2$\\,$m. We detect an elliptical\nplasma globule of approximate size $1^\\circ \\times \\gtrsim 2^\\circ$ (major-axis\nposition angle of $\\approx -40^\\circ$), via its Faraday-rotation imprint\n($\\approx 15\\,$rad$\\,$m$^{-2}$) on the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission.\nThe extreme scintillation of J1819+3845 was most likely caused at the turbulent\nboundary of the globule (J1819+3845 is currently occulted by the globule). The\norigin and precise nature of the globule remain unknown. Our observations are\nthe first time plasma structures that likely cause extreme scintillation have\nbeen directly imaged.\n", "  We show how to calculate the secure final key rate in the four-intensity\ndecoy-state MDI-QKD protocol with both source errors and statistical\nfluctuations with a certain failure probability. Our results rely only on the\nrange of only a few parameters in the source state. All imperfections in this\nprotocol have been taken into consideration without any unverifiable error\npatterns.\n", "  The existing decoy-state MDI-QKD theory assumes the perfect control of the\nsource states which is a an impossible task for any real setup. In this paper,\nwe study the decoy-state MDI-QKD method with source errors without any presumed\nconditions and we get the final security key rate only with the range of a few\nparameters in the source state.\n", "  V959 Mon (Nova Mon 2012) was first detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope\nin June 2012, as a transient gamma-ray source. Subsequent optical observations\nshowed that this gamma-ray emission was due to a classical nova explosion.\nMulti-frequency observations of V959 Mon with the VLA between June and\nSeptember 2012 revealed dramatic brightening, and a spectrum that steepened\nwith increasing frequency. High resolution radio images of V959 Mon using\ne-MERLIN are presented here, at six epochs between September 2012 and February\n2014 which show morphological evolution of the source. While early e-MERLIN\nobservations of V959 Mon show an east-west elonga- tion in the ejecta\nmorphology, subsequent observations suggest that the ejecta become elongated in\nthe north-south direction. Our high-resolution observations of this sur-\nprising evolution in the structure of V959 Mon can assist us in further\nunderstanding the behaviour and morphology of nova ejecta.\n", "  Convective core overshooting has a strong influence on the evolution of stars\nof moderate and high mass. Studies of double-lined eclipsing binaries and\nstellar oscillations have renewed interest in the possible dependence of\novershooting on stellar mass, which has been poorly constrained by observations\nso far. Here we have used a sample of 29 well-studied double-lined eclipsing\nbinaries in key locations of the H-R diagram to establish the explicit\ndependence of f(ov) on mass, where f(ov) is the free parameter in the diffusive\napproximation to overshooting. Measurements of the masses, radii, and\ntemperatures of the binary components were compared against stellar evolution\ncalculations based on the MESA code to infer semi-empirical values of f(ov) for\neach component. We find a clear mass dependence such that f(ov) rises sharply\nfrom zero in the range 1.2--2.0 solar masses, and levels off thereafter up to\nthe 4.4 solar mass limit of our sample. Tests with two different element\nmixtures indicate the trend is the same, and we find it is also qualitatively\nsimilar to the one established in our previous study with the classical\nstep-function implementation of overshooting characterized by the free\nparameter alpha(ov). Based on these measurements we infer an approximate\nrelationship between the two overshooting parameters of alpha(ov)/f(ov) = 11.36\n+/- 0.22, with a possible dependence on stellar properties.\n", "  I present a simple graphical method to find the BPS spectra of $A_1$ theories\nof class S. BPS graphs provide a bridge between spectral networks and BPS\nquivers, the two main frameworks for the study of BPS states. Here I show how\nto essentially read off from a BPS graph the quantum spectrum generator (or BPS\nmonodromy), expressed as a product of quantum dilogarithms. Thanks to the\nframed wall-crossing phenomenon for line defects, the determination of the BPS\nspectrum reduces to the computation of quantum parallel transport across the\nedges of the BPS graph.\n", "  Recently it has been found numerically that the spectra of metamaterial\ncrystals may contain pairs of bands which disappear inside the Brillouin zone.\nWe observe that the wave equations for such systems are essentially\nnon-Hermitian, but PT -symmetric. We show that the real-frequency spectra\ncorrespond to PT -symmetric solutions of the wave quation. At those momenta in\nthe Brillouin zone where apparently no solutions exist, there appear pairs of\ncomplex-frequency solutions with spontaneously broken PT symmetry.\n", "  A novel recipe for exactly solving in finite terms a class of special\ndifferential Riccati equations is reported. Our procedure is entirely based on\na successful resolution strategy quite recently applied to quantum dynamical\ntime-dependent SU(2) problems. The general integral of exemplary differential\nRiccati equations, not previously considered in the specialized literature, is\nexplicitly determined to illustrate both mathematical usefulness and easiness\nof applicability of our proposed treatment. The possibility of exploiting the\ngeneral integral of a given differential Riccati equation to solve an SU(2)\nquantum dynamical problem, is succinctly pointed out.\n", "  In biological tissues, it is now well-understood that mechanical cues are a\npowerful mechanism for pattern regulation. While much work has focused on\ninteractions between cells and external substrates, recent experiments suggest\nthat cell polarization and motility might be governed by the internal shear\nstiffness of nearby tissue, deemed \"plithotaxis\". Meanwhile, other work has\ndemonstrated that there is a direct relationship between cell shapes and tissue\nshear modulus in confluent tissues. Joining these two ideas, we develop a\nhydrodynamic model that couples cell shape, and therefore tissue stiffness, to\ncell motility and polarization. Using linear stability analysis and numerical\nsimulations, we find that tissue behavior can be tuned between largely\nhomogeneous states and patterned states such as asters, controlled by a\ncomposite \"morphotaxis\" parameter that encapsulates the nature of the coupling\nbetween shape and polarization. The control parameter is in principle\nexperimentally accessible, and depends both on whether a cell tends to move in\nthe direction of lower or higher shear modulus, and whether sinks or sources of\npolarization tend to fluidize the system.\n", "  ALICE, a general purpose experiment designed to investigate nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), has also been used to\ndetect atmospheric muons produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere.\n  In this contribution the analysis of the multiplicity distribution of the\natmospheric muons detected by ALICE between 2010 and 2013 is presented, along\nwith a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. Special emphasis is given to\nthe study of high-multiplicity events, i.e. those containing more than 100\nreconstructed muons. Such high-multiplicity events demand primary cosmic rays\nwith energy above $10^{16}$ eV. The frequency of these events can be\nsuccessfully described by assuming a heavy mass composition of primary cosmic\nrays in this energy range, using the most recent interaction models to describe\nthe development of the air shower resulting from the primary interaction.\n", "  The influence of final-state radiation (FSR) of heavy quarks on observables\nin high-energy proton-proton collisions is studied. The transverse momentum\ncorrelation of D and Dbar mesons, which have been emitted with an azimuthal\ndifference angle close to 180 degrees, is identified as an observable which is\nsensitive to the FSR process. We demonstrate this by performing calculations\nwith the EPOS3+HQ model and with the event generator Pythia 6. The initial\nsymmetric pT = pT' correlation for back-to-back pairs does not completely\nvanish in EPOS3+HQ, neither for the final DDbar pairs nor for the ccbar pairs\nbefore hadronisation. Also a significant difference in the shape of the\ncorrelation distribution for EPOS3+HQ and Pythia 6 is observed. Therefore,\nparticle correlations in pp data offer the possibility to study several aspects\nof energy loss in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  With a large, unique spectroscopic survey in the fields of 28 galaxy-scale\nstrong gravitational lenses, we identify groups of galaxies in the 26\nadequately-sampled fields. Using a group finding algorithm, we find 210 groups\nwith at least five member galaxies; the median number of members is eight. Our\nsample spans redshifts of 0.04 $\\le z_{grp} \\le$ 0.76 with a median of 0.31,\nincluding 174 groups with $0.1 < z_{grp} < 0.6$. Groups have radial velocity\ndispersions of 60 $\\le \\sigma_{grp} \\le$ 1200 km s$^{-1}$ with a median of 350\nkm s$^{-1}$. We also discover a supergroup in field B0712+472 at $z =$ 0.29\nconsisting of three main groups. We recover groups similar to $\\sim$ 85% of\nthose previously reported in these fields within our redshift range of\nsensitivity and find 187 new groups with at least five members. The properties\nof our group catalog, specifically 1) the distribution of $\\sigma_{grp}$, 2)\nthe fraction of all sample galaxies that are group members, and 3) the fraction\nof groups with significant substructure, are consistent with those for other\ncatalogs. The distribution of group virial masses agrees well with theoretical\nexpectations. Of the lens galaxies, 12 of 26 (46%) (B1422+231, B1600+434,\nB2114+022, FBQS J0951+2635, HE0435-1223, HST J14113+5211, MG0751+2716,\nMGJ1654+1346, PG 1115+080, Q ER 0047-2808, RXJ1131-1231, and WFI J2033-4723)\nare members of groups with at least five galaxies, and one more (B0712+472)\nbelongs to an additional, visually identified group candidate. There are groups\nnot associated with the lens that still are likely to affect the lens model; in\nsix of 25 (24%) fields (excluding the supergroup), there is at least one\nmassive ($\\sigma_{grp} \\ge$ 500 km s$^{-1}$) group or group candidate projected\nwithin 2$^{\\prime}$ of the lens.\n", "  I report on recent advancements regarding calculations that require\ninitial-state partons with non-vanishing transverse momentum, causing it to be\nspace-like and thus off-shell.\n", "  In this work we consider two possible wetting states for a droplet when\nplaced on a substrate: the Fakir configuration of a Cassie-Baxter (CB) state\nwith a droplet residing on top of roughness grooves and the Wenzel (W) state\ncharacterized by the homogeneous wetting of the surface. We extend a\ntheoretical model based on the global interfacial energies for both states to\nstudy the wetting behavior of simple and double reentrant surfaces. Due to the\nminimization of the energies associated to each wetting state, we predict the\nthermodynamic wetting state of the droplet for a given surface and obtain its\ncontact angle ${\\theta}_C$. We first use this model to find the geometries for\npillared, simple and double reentrant surfaces that most enhances ${\\theta}_C$\nand conclude that the repellent behavior of these surfaces is governed by the\nrelation between the height and width of the reentrances. We compare our\nresults with recent experiments and discuss the limitations of this\nthermodynamic approach. To address one of these limitations, we implement Monte\nCarlo simulations of the cellular Potts Model in three dimensions, allowing us\nto investigate the dependency of the wetting state on the initial state of the\ndroplet. We find that when the droplet is initialized in a CB state, it gets\ntrapped in a local minimum and stays in the repellent behavior irrespective of\nthe theoretical prediction. When the initial state is W, simulations show a\ngood agreement with theory for pillared surfaces, but for reentrant surfaces\nthe agreement only happens in few cases: for most simulated geometries the\ncontact angle reached by the droplet in simulations is higher than ${\\theta}_C$\npredicted by the model. Moreover, we find that the contact angle of the\nsimulated droplet is higher when placed on the reentrant surfaces than for a\npillared surfaces with the same height, width and pillar distance.\n", "  A quantum computer, i.e. utilizing the resources of quantum physics,\nsuperposition of states and entanglement, could furnish an exponential gain in\ncomputing time. A simulation using such resources is called a quantum\nsimulation. The advantage of quantum simulations over classical ones is well\nestablished at the theoretical, i.e. software level. Their practical benefit\nrequires their implementation on a quantum hardware. The quantum computer, i.e.\nthe universal one (see below), has not seen the light of day yet, but the\nefforts in this direction are both growing and diverse. Also, quantum\nsimulation has already been illustrated by numerous experimental proofs of\nprinciple, thanks too small-size and specific-task quantum computers or\nsimulators. Quantum walks are particularly-studied quantum-simulation schemes,\nbeing elementary bricks to conceive any quantum algorithm, i.e. to achieve\nso-called universal quantum computation.\n  The present thesis is a step more towards a simulation of quantum field\ntheories based on discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs). Indeed, it is shown, in\ncertain cases, how DTQWs can simulate, in the continuum, the action of\nYang-Mills gauge fields on fermionic matter, and the retroaction of the latter\non the gauge-field dynamics. The suggested schemes preserve gauge invariance on\nthe spacetime lattice, i.e. not only in the continuum. In the (1+2)-dimensional\nAbelian case, consistent lattice equivalents to both Maxwell's equations and\nthe current conservation are suggested. In the (1+1)-dimensional non-Abelian\ncase, a lattice version of the non-Abelian field strength is suggested.\nMoreover, it is shown how this fermionic matter based on DTQWs can be coupled\nto relativistic gravitational fields of the continuum, i.e. to curved\nspacetimes, in 1+2 dimensions.\n", "  In the whole landscape of atomic nuclei, $^{229}$Th is currently the only\nknown nucleus which could allow for the development of a nuclear-based\nfrequency standard, as it possesses an isomeric state of just 7.6 eV energy\nabove the ground state. The 3+ charge state is of special importance in this\ncontext, as Th$^{3+}$ allows for a simple laser-cooling scheme. Here we\nemphasize the direct extraction of triply-charged $^{229}$Th from a buffer-gas\nstopping cell. This finding will not only simplify any future approach of\n$^{229}$Th ion cooling, but is also used for thorium-beam purification and in\nthis way provides a powerful tool for the direct identification of the\n$^{229}$Th isomer to ground state nuclear transition.\n", "  The target of many astronomical studies is the recovery of tiny astrophysical\nsignals living in a sea of uninteresting (but usually dominant) noise. In many\ncontexts (i.e., stellar time-series, or high-contrast imaging, or stellar\nspectroscopy), there are structured components in this noise caused by\nsystematic effects in the astronomical source, the atmosphere, the telescope,\nor the detector. More often than not, evaluation of the true physical model for\nthese nuisances is computationally intractable and dependent on too many\n(unknown) parameters to allow rigorous probabilistic inference. Sometimes,\nhousekeeping data---and often the science data themselves---can be used as\npredictors of the systematic noise. Linear combinations of simple functions of\nthese predictors are often used as computationally tractable models that can\ncapture the nuisances. These models can be used to fit and subtract systematics\nprior to investigation of the signals of interest, or they can be used in a\nsimultaneous fit of the systematics and the signals. In this Note, we show that\nif a Gaussian prior is placed on the weights of the linear components, the\nweights can be marginalized out with an operation in pure linear algebra, which\ncan (often) be made fast. We illustrate this model by demonstrating the\napplicability of a linear model for the non-linear systematics in K2\ntime-series data, where the dominant noise source for many stars is spacecraft\nmotion and variability.\n", "  The Belle II detector is currently under construction at the SuperKEKB\nelectron-positron high-luminosity collider, that will provide an instantaneous\nluminosity 40 times higher than that of KEKB. There- fore the Belle-II VerteX\nDetector (VXD) will operate in a very harsh environment. A radiation monitoring\nand beam abort system is needed to safely operate the VXD detector in these\nconditions. This system is based on 20 single crystal CVD diamond sensors\nplaced in 20 key positions in the vicinity of the VXD and interaction region.\nIn this contribution we describe the system design and we present the\nprocedures followed for the characterisation and calibration of the diamond\nsensors. We discuss also the performance of the prototype system during the\nfirst SuperKEKB commissioning phase in February-June 2016.\n", "  The NASA supported High-Altitude Calibration (HiCal)-2 instrument flew as a\ncompanion balloon to the ANITA-4 experiment in December 2016. Based on a HV\ndischarge pulser producing radio-frequency (RF) calibration pulses, HiCal-2\ncomprised two payloads, which flew for a combined 18 days, covering 1.5\nrevolutions of the Antarctic continent. ANITA-4 captured over 10,000 pulses\nfrom HiCal, both direct and reflected from the surface, at distances varying\nfrom 100-800 km, providing a large dataset for surface reflectivity\nmeasurements. Herein we present details on the design, construction and\nperformance of HiCal-2.\n", "  Quantum nanoelectronics has entered an era where quantum electrical currents\nare built from single to few on-demand elementary excitations. To date however,\nvery limited tools have been implemented to characterize them. In this work, we\npresent a quantum current analyzer able to extract single particle excitations\npresent within a periodic quantum electrical current without any a priori\nhypothesis. Our analyzer combines two-particle interferometry and signal\nprocessing to extract the relevant electron and hole wavefunctions localized\naround each emission period and their quantum coherence from one emission\nperiod to the other. This quantum current analyzer opens new possibilities for\nthe characterization and control of quantum electrical currents in nanoscale\nconductors and for investigations of entanglement in quantum electronics down\nto the single electron level.\n", "  We use protein folding energy landscape concepts such as golf-course and\nfunnel to study re-equilibration in athermal martensite parameter regime of\ntriangle-to-centered rectangle, square-to-oblique, and triangle-to-oblique\ntransitions under systematic temperature-quench Monte Carlo simulations. On\nquenching below a transition temperature, the seeded high-symmetry parent-phase\naustenite that converts to the low-symmetry product-phase martensite, through\nautocatalytic twinning or elastic photocopying, has both rapid conversions and\nincubation-delays in the temperature-time-transformation phase diagram. We find\nthe rapid (incubation-delays) conversions at low (high) temperatures arises\nfrom the presence of large (small) size of golf-course edge that has funnel\ninside for negative energy states. In the incubating state, the strain\nstructure factor enters into the Brillouin zone golf-course through searches\nfor finite transitional pathways which closes off at the transition temperature\nwith Vogel-Fulcher divergences that are insensitive to Hamiltonian energy\nscales and log-normal distributions, as signatures of dominant entropy\nbarriers. The crossing of the entropy barrier is identified through energy\noccupancy distributions, Monte Carlo acceptance fractions, heat emission and\ninternal work. The above ideas had previously been presented for the scalar\norder parameter case. Here we show similar results are also obtained for vector\norder parameters.\n", "  We study the evolution of magnetic fields in accretion flows around six\ndifferent sink particles in a global star formation simulation. Using the\nadaptive mesh refinement capabilities of \\ramses, the vicinity of the sinks is\nresolved with a resolution down to $2$ AU. The statistical properties of the\nmagnetic field are tracked as a function of radius, height and time around each\nsink particle. All six systems are strongly magnetised with plasma beta being\nunity or below and we know that at least three of the sinks host an accretion\ndisc. One of the discs is studied at a higher resolution of $0.06$ AU and we\nreport its magnetic properties. We find that the angular momentum transport is\ndominated by large scale radial-azimuthal Maxwell stress. Furthermore, contrary\nto the weakly magnetised case studied in shearing box simulations, the large\nscale azimuthal field does not show smooth cycle periods but instead forms a\nbanded structure. We conclude by speculating what this result might mean for\nobservations and whether it will hold with highly resolved simulations\nincluding turbulence or non-ideal MHD effects.\n", "  South Africa is in the fortunate position of having access to high-quality\nwind and solar resources promising energy production costs well below the ones\nprojected for future installations of thermal generation; yet the feasibility\nof a low carbon energy system is still under scrutiny. This study introduces a\nspatially and temporally resolved techno-economic model co-optimising\ngeneration and transmission capacity investments and operation. 27 supply\nregions in South Africa are equipped with a year of time-series in hourly\nresolution based on the IRP2016 base-case assumptions. Eight different\nscenarios representing different restrictions on renewable generation and\nmitigation efforts of GHG emissions are evaluated and discussed. 70% of energy\nfrom renewable sources were found to be cost-optimally integrated using\nflexible gas generation and the expansion of several transmission corridors. A\n95% CO${}_2$ reduction leads to a moderate 20% cost increase. The open-source\nnature of the model and restriction to freely available data encourages an\naccessible and transparent discussion about the future South African energy\nsystem, primarily based on renewable wind and solar resources.\n", "  We present an estimate of survival probability from an eikonal mini- jet\nmodel implemented with a proposal for soft gluon resummation to all orders. We\ncompare it with experimental data for diffractive di-jet production from LHC\nexperiments, CMS and ATLAS, both at LO and NLO order.\n", "  We consider nontopological first-order solitons arising from a gauged $CP(2)$\nmodel in the presence of the Maxwell term multiplied by a nontrivial dielectric\nfunction. We implement the corresponding first-order scenario by proceeding the\nminimization of the total energy, this way introducing the corresponding energy\nlower-bound, such a construction being only possible due to a differential\nconstraint including the dielectric function itself and the self-interacting\npotential defining the model. We saturate the aforementioned bound by focusing\nour attention on those solutions fulfilling a particular set of two coupled\nfirst-order differential equations. In the sequel, in order to solve these\nequations, we choose the dielectric function explicitly, also calculating the\ncorresponding self-interacting potential. We impose appropriate boundary\nconditions supporting nontopological solitons, from which we verify that the\nenergy of final structures is proportional to the magnetic flux they engender,\nboth quantities being not quantized, as expected. We depict the new numerical\nsolutions, whilst commenting on the main properties they present.\n", "  This short article sets out some of the basic considerations that go into\ndetecting the mass of quasiparticles with effective magnetic charge in solids.\nEffective magnetic charges may be appear as defects in particular magnetic\ntextures. A magnetic monopole is a defect in this texture and as such these are\nnot monopoles in the actual magnetic field B, but instead in the auxiliary\nfield H. They may have particular properties expected for such quasiparticles\nsuch as magnetic charge and mass. This effective mass may -- in principle -- be\ndetected in the same fashion that the mass is detected of other particles\nclassically e.g. through their inertial response to time-dependent\nelectromagnetic fields. I discuss this physics in the context of the \"simple\"\ncase of the quantum spin ices, but aspects are broadly applicable. Based on\nextensions to Ryzkhin's model for classical spin ice, a hydrodynamic\nformulation can be given that takes into account inertial and entropic forces.\nUltimately, a form for the susceptibility is obtained that is equivalent to the\nRocard equation, which is a classic form used to account for inertial effects\nin the context of Debye-like relaxation.\n", "  We combine particle-based simulations, mean-field rate equations, and\nWertheim's theory to study the dynamics of patchy particles in and out of\nequilibrium, at different temperatures and densities. We consider an initial\nrandom distribution of non-overlapping three-patch particles, with no bonds,\nand analyze the time evolution of the breaking and bonding rates of a single\nbond. We find that the asymptotic (equilibrium) dynamics differs from the\ninitial (out of equilibrium) one. These differences are expected to depend on\nthe initial conditions, temperature, and density.\n", "  Metasurfaces represent one of the most vibrant fields of modern science and\ntechnology. A metasurface is a complex electromagnetic structure, that is\ntypically deeply subwavelength in thickness, electrically large in transverse\nsize and composed of subwavelength scattering particles with extremely small\nfeatures; it may generally be bianisotropic, spacevarying and time-varying,\nnonlinear, curved and multiphysics. With such complexity, the design of a\nmetasurface requires a holistic approach, involving synergistic synthesis and\nanalysis operations, based on a solid model. The Generalized Sheet Transition\nConditions (GSTCs), combined with bianisotropic surface susceptibility\nfunctions, provide such a model, and allow now for the design of sophisticated\nmetasurfaces, which still represented a major challenge a couple of years ago.\nThis paper presents this problematic, focusing on the computational analysis of\nmetasurfaces via the GSTC-susceptibility approach. It shows that this analysis\nplays a crucial role in the holistic design of metasurfaces, and overviews\nrecently reported related frequency-domain (FDFD, SD-IE, FEM) and time-domain\n(FDTD) computational techniques.\n", "  Extraction of interaction networks from multi-variate time-series is one of\nthe topics of broad interest in complex systems. Although this method has a\nwide range of applications, most of the previous analyses have focused on the\npairwise relations. Here we establish the potential of such a method to elicit\naggregated behavior of the system by making a connection with the concepts from\npercolation theory. We study the dynamical interaction networks of a financial\nmarket extracted from the correlation network of indices, and build a weighted\nnetwork. In correspondence with the percolation model, we find that away from\nfinancial crises the interaction network behaves like a critical random network\nof Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi, while close to a financial crisis, our model deviates\nfrom the critical random network and behaves differently at different size\nscales. We perform further analysis to clarify that our observation is not a\nsimple consequence of the growth in correlations over the crises.\n", "  The main goal of this work is to solve the nonrelativistic wave equation for\na new potential configuration that describes the quantum states of a particle\nthat lies within a onedimensional infinite well of width L using the Asymptotic\nIteration Method (AIM). This potential was introduced recently by Alhaidari to\nbe added to the class of exactly solvable potentials in the Tridiagonal\nRepresentation Approach (TRA). We have obtained the energy eigenvalues for\ndifferent choices of the potential parameters. A good match between our results\nand the ones obtained by the TRA are shown in Table 1. Moreover, new results\nhave been presented in Table 2 and Table 3 for the energy spectrum.\n", "  An earthquake-proof seismic negative belt of an artificial seismic shadow\nzone is introduced. The belt is composed of acoustic materials which has one of\nthe constituent parameter between density and modulus is negative effectively.\nIt converts the velocity of the seismic wave imaginary, and then creates a\nstop-band for the seismic frequency range. The belt is an attenuator of a\nseismic wave that reduces the amplitude of the wave exponentially. Passing the\nbelt underground, the seismic energy turns into sound and heat in air and the\nmagnitude of the seismic wave is weakened to be defended by conventional\nmethod. Models of the negative density and negative modulus for engineering are\nsuggested.\n", "  Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices; from smart phone\naccelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless communication filters to\natomic force microscope sensors. Frequency stability, a critical performance\nmetric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the\ninverse of the linewidth and of the damping). Here we show that frequency\nstability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can generally be made independent\nof quality factor. At high bandwidths, we show that quality factor reduction is\ncompletely mitigated by increases in signal to noise ratio. At low bandwidths,\nstrikingly, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution,\nwith improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by\ndemonstrating temperature resolution of 50 \\mu K at 200 Hz bandwidth. These\nresults open the door for high performance ultrasensitive resonant sensors in\ngaseous or liquid environments, single cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas\nchromatography, and atmospheric pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry.\n", "  In this paper, we carry out a computational study using the spectral\ndecomposition of the fluctuations of a two-pathogen epidemic model around its\ndeterministic attractor, i.e., steady state or limit cycle, to examine the role\nof partial vaccination and between-host pathogen interaction on early pathogen\nreplacement during seasonal epidemics of influenza and respiratory syncytial\nvirus.\n", "  Graphene is a nonmagnetic semimetal and cannot be directly used as electronic\nor spintronic devices. We demonstrate that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can\nexhibit strong edge magnetism and tunable energy gaps due to the presence of\nlocalized edge states. By using large-scale first principle density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations and detailed analysis based on model Hamiltonians, we\ncan show that the zigzag edge states in GQDs become much stronger and more\nlocalized as the system size increases. The enhanced edge states induce strong\nelectron-electron interactions along the edges of GQDs, ultimately resulting in\na magnetic phase transition from nonmagnetic to intra-edge ferromagnetic and\ninter-edge antiferromagnetic, when the diameter is larger than 4.5 nm. Our\nanalysis shows that the inter-edge superexchange interaction of\nantiferromagnetic states between two nearest-neighbor zigzag edges in GQDs is\nmuch stronger than that exists between two parallel zigzag edges in GQDs and\ngraphene nanoribbons. Furthermore, such strong and localized edge states also\ninduce GQDs semiconducting with tunable energy gaps, mainly controlled by\nadjusting the system size. Our results show that the quantum confinement\neffect, inter-edge superexchange (antiferromagnetic), and intra-edge direct\nexchange (ferromagnetic) interactions are crucial for the electronic and\nmagnetic properties of zigzag GQDs at the nanoscale.\n", "  The structure of complex networks has been of interest in many scientific and\nengineering disciplines over the decades. A number of studies in the field have\nbeen focused on finding the common properties among different kinds of networks\nsuch as heavy-tail degree distribution, small-worldness and modular structure\nand they have tried to establish a theory of structural universality in complex\nnetworks. However, there is no comprehensive study of network structure across\na diverse set of domains in order to explain the structural diversity we\nobserve in the real-world networks. In this paper, we study 986 real-world\nnetworks of diverse domains ranging from ecological food webs to online social\nnetworks along with 575 networks generated from four popular network models.\nOur study utilizes a number of machine learning techniques such as random\nforest and confusion matrix in order to show the relationships among network\ndomains in terms of network structure. Our results indicate that there are some\npartitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguish\nbased purely on network structure. We have found that these partitions of\nnetwork categories tend to have similar underlying functions, constraints\nand/or generative mechanisms of networks even though networks in the same\npartition have different origins, e.g., biological processes, results of\nengineering by human being, etc. This suggests that the origin of a network,\nwhether it's biological, technological or social, may not necessarily be a\ndecisive factor of the formation of similar network structure. Our findings\nshed light on the possible direction along which we could uncover the hidden\nprinciples for the structural diversity of complex networks.\n", "  A scheme is presented to optimize the optomechanical cooling of mechanical\nresonator in instability regime. Based on the stability analysis, we uncovered\na distinct bistable effect of photons and phonons, which can be used to realize\na strong nonlinear effect even in the single-photon weak coupling regime.\nConsidering the experimental realization, we investigate the sideband cooling\nin bistable regime with and without quantum nonlinearity. It is shown that the\nfluctuation of the steady state phonons can be excellently suppressed at a\nrather low level due to the anti-rotating-wave effect, and it does not require\nhigh quality factor of the cavity. Our scheme offers a new perspective for\noptimizing the sideband cooling of mechanical resonators in the weak coupling\nregime.\n", "  The W-Band ($75-110\\; \\mathrm{GHz}$) sky contains a plethora of information\nabout star formation, galaxy evolution and the cosmic microwave background. We\nhave designed and fabricated a dual-purpose superconducting circuit to\nfacilitate the next generation of astronomical observations in this regime by\nproviding proof-of-concept for both a millimeter-wave low-loss phase shifter,\nwhich can operate as an on-chip Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and a\ntraveling wave kinetic inductance parametric amplifier (TKIP). Superconducting\ntransmission lines have a propagation speed that depends on the inductance in\nthe line which is a combination of geometric inductance and kinetic inductance\nin the superconductor. The kinetic inductance has a non-linear component with a\ncharacteristic current, $I_*$, and can be modulated by applying a DC current,\nchanging the propagation speed and effective path length. Our test circuit is\ndesigned to measure the path length difference or phase shift, $\\Delta \\phi$,\nbetween two symmetric transmission lines when one line is biased with a DC\ncurrent. To provide a measurement of $\\Delta\\phi$, a key parameter for\noptimizing a high gain W-Band TKIP, and modulate signal path length in FTS\noperation, our $3.6 \\times 2.5\\; \\mathrm{cm}$ chip employs a pair of $503\\;\n\\mathrm{mm}$ long NbTiN inverted microstrip lines coupled to circular waveguide\nports through radial probes. For a line of width $3\\; \\mathrm{\\mu m}$ and film\nthickness $20\\; \\mathrm{nm}$, we predict $\\Delta\\phi\\approx1767\\; \\mathrm{rad}$\nat $90\\; \\mathrm{GHz}$ when biased at close to $I_*$. We have fabricated a\nprototype with $200\\; \\mathrm{nm}$ thick Nb film and the same line length and\nwidth. The predicted phase shift for our prototype is $\\Delta\\phi\\approx30\\;\n\\mathrm{rad}$ at $90\\; \\mathrm{GHz}$ when biased at close to $I_*$ for Nb.\n", "  Standard quantum physics prevents the existence of a joint statistics for\ncomplementary observables. Nevertheless, a joint distribution for complementary\nobservables can be derived from their imperfect simultaneous measurement\nfollowed by a suitable data inversion. Quantumness is reflected then in the\npathologies of the inferred distribution. We apply this program to the\nparadigmatic example of complementarity: the wave-particle duality in a Young\ninterferometer.\n", "  In real world complex networks, the importance of a node depends on two\nimportant parameters: 1. characteristics of the node, and 2. the context of the\ngiven application. The current literature contains several centrality measures\nthat have been defined to measure the importance of a node based on the given\napplication requirements. These centrality measures assign a centrality value\nto each node that denotes its importance index. But in real life applications,\nwe are more interested in the relative importance of the node that can be\nmeasured using its centrality rank based on the given centrality measure. To\ncompute the centrality rank of a node, we need to compute the centrality value\nof all the nodes and compare them to get the rank. This process requires the\nentire network. So, it is not feasible for real-life applications due to the\nlarge size and dynamic nature of real world networks. In the present project,\nwe aim to propose fast and efficient methods to estimate the global centrality\nrank of a node without computing the centrality value of all nodes. These\nmethods can be further extended to estimate the rank without having the entire\nnetwork. The proposed methods use the structural behavior of centrality\nmeasures, sampling techniques, or the machine learning models. In this work, we\nalso discuss how to apply these methods for degree and closeness centrality\nrank estimation.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) heterointerfaces often provide extraordinary carrier\ntransport as exemplified by superconductivity or excitonic superfluidity.\nRecently, double-layer graphene separated by few-layered boron nitride\ndemonstrated the Coulomb drag phenomenon: carriers in the active layer drag the\ncarriers in the passive layer. Here, we propose a new switching device\noperating via Coulomb drag interaction at a graphene/MoS2 (GM) heterointerface.\nThe ideal van der Waals distance allows strong coupling of the interlayer\nelectron-hole pairs, whose recombination is prevented by the Schottky barrier\nformed due to charge transfer at the heterointerface. This device exhibits a\nhigh carrier mobility (up to ~3,700 cm^2V^-1s^-1) even at room temperature,\nwhile maintaining a high on/off current ratio (~10^8), outperforming those of\nindividual layers. In the electron-electron drag regime, graphene-like\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations are observed at low temperatures. Our Coulomb\ndrag transistor could provide a shortcut for the practical application of\nquantum-mechanical 2D heterostructures at room temperature.\n", "  The Weak Turbulence Theory is a statistical framework to describe a large\nensemble of nonlinearly interacting waves. The archetypal example of such\nsystem is the ocean surface that is made of interacting surface gravity waves.\nHere we describe a laboratory experiment dedicated to probe the statistical\nproperties of turbulent gravity waves. We setup an isotropic state of\ninteracting gravity waves in the Coriolis facility (13~m diameter circular wave\ntank) by exciting waves at 1~Hz by wedge wavemakers. We implement a\nstereoscopic technique to obtain a measurement of the surface elevation that is\nresolved both in space and time. Fourier analysis shows that the laboratory\nspectra are systematically steeper than the theoretical predictions and than\nthe field observations in the Black Sea by Leckler {\\it et al. JPO} 2015. We\nidentify a strong impact of surface dissipation on the scaling of the Fourier\nspectrum at the scales that are accessible in the experiments. We use\nbicoherence and tricoherence statistical tools in frequency and/or wavevector\nspace to identify the active nonlinear coupling. These analyses are also\nperformed on the field data by Leckler {\\it et al.} for comparison with the\nlaboratory data. 3-wave coupling are characterized and shown to involve mostly\nquasi resonances of waves with second or higher order harmonics. 4-wave\ncoupling are not observed in the laboratory but are evidenced in the field\ndata. We finally discuss temporal scale separation to explain our observations.\n", "  Theoretical developments in the field of Lagrangian turbulence are made\ndifficult by the fact that equations governing the evolution of lagrangian\nflows are implicit contrary to eulerian flows. In this article, an {\\it exact}\nexplicit equation for incompressible lagrangian fluid flows at high-Reynolds\nnumber is constructed. The method to arrive at the equation of motion and the\nproof that it describes the motion of an incompressible fluid are provided. A\ntruncated version of this new equation is used to show how the lagrangian\nturbulent spectrum ($E_\\mathrm{lag}(\\omega)$) could be inferred. This exercise\nshowed a complex interrelation between the stirring force field and the flow\nitself in the lagrangian turbulence framework whereas the stirring is not\naffected by the flow in the eulerian point of view. The result is that\n$E_\\mathrm{lag}(\\omega)\\propto \\varepsilon\\,\\omega^{-2}$ seems independent upon\nthe way the fluid is stirred in the inertial range for a given dissipated power\n$\\varepsilon$. It also showed that $E_\\mathrm{lag}(\\omega)\\sim \\omega^{-s}$\nwith $0\\leq s\\leq 1/2$ (depending on the stirring) at low-$\\omega$ and\n$\\sim\\omega^{-4}$ in the viscous range at high-$\\omega$.\n", "  We present the cross sections for both electromagnetic and diffractive\ndissociation of protons for semiexclusive production of $J/\\psi$ mesons in\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC. Differential distributions in missing mass\n($M_X$), as well as distributions in rapidity and transverse momentum of the\n$J/\\psi$ are calculated for $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and 13 TeV proton proton\ncollisions. We compare the distributions for purely electromagnetic and purely\ndiffractive proton excitations/dissociation. We predict cross sections for\nelectromagnetic and diffractive excitations of similar order of magnitude.\n", "  We herewith attempt to investigate the cosmic rays behavior regarding the\nscaling features of their time series. Our analysis is based on cosmic ray\nobservations made at four neutron monitor stations in Athens (Greece), Jung\n(Switzerland) and Oulu (Finland), for the period 2000 to early 2017. Each of\nthese datasets was analyzed by using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)\nand Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) in order to\ninvestigate intrinsic properties, like self-similarity and the spectrum of\nsingularities. The main result obtained is that the cosmic rays time series at\nall the neutron monitor stations exhibit positive long-range correlations (of\n1/f type) with multifractal behavior. On the other hand, we try to investigate\nthe possible existence of similar scaling features in the time series of other\nmeteorological parameters which are closely associated with the cosmic rays,\nsuch as parameters describing physical properties of clouds.\n", "  We analyse the corpus of user relationships of the Slashdot technology news\nsite. The data was collected from the Slashdot Zoo feature where users of the\nwebsite can tag other users as friends and foes, providing positive and\nnegative endorsements. We adapt social network analysis techniques to the\nproblem of negative edge weights. In particular, we consider signed variants of\nglobal network characteristics such as the clustering coefficient, node-level\ncharacteristics such as centrality and popularity measures, and link-level\ncharacteristics such as distances and similarity measures. We evaluate these\nmeasures on the task of identifying unpopular users, as well as on the task of\npredicting the sign of links and show that the network exhibits multiplicative\ntransitivity which allows algebraic methods based on matrix multiplication to\nbe used. We compare our methods to traditional methods which are only suitable\nfor positively weighted edges.\n", "  Today's most precise time and frequency measurements are performed with\noptical atomic clocks. However, it has been proposed that they could\npotentially be outperformed by a nuclear clock, which employs a nuclear\ntransition instead of the atomic shell transitions used so far. By today there\nis only one nuclear state known which could serve for a nuclear clock using\ncurrently available technology, which is the isomeric first excited state in\n$^{229}$Th. Here we report the direct detection of this nuclear state, which is\na further confirmation of the isomer's existence and lays the foundation for\nprecise studies of the isomer's decay parameters. Based on this direct\ndetection the isomeric energy is constrained to lie between 6.3 and 18.3 eV,\nand the half-life is found to be longer than 60 s for\n$^{229\\mathrm{m}}$Th$^{2+}$. More precise determinations appear in reach and\nwill pave the way for the development of a nuclear frequency standard.\n", "  We report on the studies of switching mechanism between normal and anomalous\nlaser induced periodic surface structures. We have shown that for high loss\nmetals the switching mechanism between normal and anomalous modes relays on an\ninterplay between two different feedbacks inherent into the structure formation\nprocess: long range, low intensity dipole-like scattering of light along the\nsurface, which governs anomalous ripples parallel to the laser polarization,\nand short range, high intensity plasmon-polariton wave, which is initiated by\nnear field dipole radiation and responsible for creation of ripples\nperpendicular to the polarization, i. e. normal structure. By managing these\ntwo feedbacks, we demonstrated creation of both normal and anomalous laser\ninduced periodic surface structures on the same surface. In contrast to the\nprevious studies, we have shown that the thermal oxidation mechanism can form\nboth normal and anomalous types of the structure, while the ablation mechanism\nis involved only during the normal structure formation. Unlike the formation of\noxidation type anomalous structure, the formation of ablation type normal\nstructure does not have inherent negative feedback, which is self-regulating\nnano-ripples formation. This feedback needs to be applied artificially, by\nregulating scanning speed and pulse energy at a given repetition rate of the\nlaser. With implementation of nonlinear laser lithography technique for\nablation type of normal laser induced periodic surface structures we\ndemonstrated large area high regular nano-grating formation on different\nsurfaces with extremely high industrially acceptable speed.\n", "  Dark count rate and correlated noise rate are among the main parameters that\ncharacterize silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). Typically, these parameters are\nevaluated by applying approximate formulas, or by fitting specific models, to\nthe measured SiPM noise spectra. Here a novel approach is presented, where\nexact formulas are derived from a statistical model of dark counts and\ncorrelated noise generation. The method allows one to measure the true value of\nsuch parameters from the areas of just the first peaks in the dark spectrum. A\nnumerical analysis shows the accuracy of the method.\n", "  We address the generic problem of random search for a point-like target on a\nline. Using the measures of search reliability and efficiency to quantify the\nrandom search quality, we compare Brownian search with L\\'evy search based on\nlong-tailed jump length distributions. We then compare these results with a\nsearch process combined of two different long-tailed jump length distributions.\nMoreover, we study the case of multiple targets located by a L\\'evy searcher.\n", "  In this study we include axions in stellar evolution models adopting the\ncurrent stringest constraints for their coupling to photons and electrons. We\nobtain that the minimum stellar mass of Core Collapse Supernova (CCSN)\nprogenitors is shifted up by nearly 2 Mo. This result seems to be in tension\nwith the observationaly derived minimum mass of CCSN progenitors.\n", "  In statistical physics, the challenging combinatorial enumeration of the\nconfigurations of a system subject to hard constraints (microcanonical\nensemble) is mapped to a mathematically easier calculation where the\nconstraints are softened (canonical ensemble). However, the mapping is exact\nonly when the size of the system is infinite and if the property of ensemble\nequivalence (EE), i.e. the asymptotic identity of canonical and microcanonical\nlarge deviations, holds. For finite systems, or when EE breaks down,\nstatistical physics is currently believed to provide no answer to the\ncombinatorial problem. In contrast with this expectation, here we establish\nexact relationships connecting conjugate ensembles in full generality, even for\nfinite system size and when EE does not hold. We also show that in the\nthermodynamic limit the ensembles are directly related through the matrix of\ncanonical (co)variances of the constraints, plus a correction term that\nsurvives only if this matrix has an infinite number of finite eigenvalues.\nThese new relationships restore the possibility of enumerating microcanonical\nconfigurations via canonical probabilities, thus reconnecting statistical\nphysics and combinatorics in realms where they were believed to be no longer in\nmutual correspondence.\n", "  This paper examines two cosmological models of quantum gravity (from string\ntheory and loop quantum gravity) to investigate the foundational and conceptual\nissues arising from quantum treatments of the big bang. While the classical\nsingularity is erased, the quantum evolution that replaces it may not\ncorrespond to classical spacetime: it may instead be a non-spatiotemporal\nregion, which somehow transitions to a spatiotemporal state. The different\nkinds of transition involved are partially characterized, the concept of a\nphysical transition without time is investigated, and the problem of empirical\nincoherence for regions without spacetime is discussed.\n", "  Tailoring and enhancing the interaction between light and matter is of great\nimportance for both fundamental researches and future photonic and\noptoelectronic applications. Due to their high exciton oscillator strength and\nlarge exciton binding energy, two-dimensional atomic semiconducting transition\nmetal dichalcogenides have recently emerged as an excellent platform for the\nstrong photon-exciton interaction by integrating with optically resonant\ncavities. Here, we propose an all-semiconductor system composed of individual\nsilicon nanospheres and monolayer WS2 and investigate the resonance coupling\nbetween these two constituents. By coating the silicon nanospheres with\nmonolayer WS2, we demonstrate the strong resonance coupling between the\nmagnetic dipole mode and A-exciton, evidenced by an anticrossing behavior in\nthe scattering energy diagram with a Rabi splitting of 77 meV. Compared with\nthe plasmonic analogues, the resonance coupling in all-semiconductor\nheterostructure is much stronger and less sensitive to the spacing between the\nsilicon nanosphere core and WS2 shell. When the silicon nanospheres are placed\nonto the WS2 monolayer with a point contact, resonance coupling manifested by\nthe quenching dips in the scattering spectra can also be observed at ambient\nconditions, which involves only a few excitons. Finally, resonance coupling in\nthe all-semiconductor heterostructure can be active controlled by temperature\nscanning. Our findings suggest that this all-semiconductor heterostructure can\nbe exploited for future on-chip nanophotonics associated with strong\nlight-matter interactions.\n", "  We discuss inclusive production of pairs of $J/\\psi$ quarkonia. Both\nleading-order single parton (box) contribution and double-parton contributions\nare included. In addition we discuss a contribution of higher-order two-gluon\nexchange and a feed down from double $\\chi_c$ production. The second two\ncontributions are important for large rapidity distance between the two\n$J/\\psi$ mesons and for relatively large cut-offs on quarkonia transverse\nmomenta. A relation to current experiments is discussed.\n", "  This document aims at presenting both theoretical and practical aspects of\nthe grating_2D Onelab model (available at\nhttp://onelab.info/wiki/Diffraction_grating). This model applies to so-called\nmono-dimensional grating, i.e. structures having one direction of invariance.\nVarious geometries and materials can be handled or easily added. The two\nclassical polarization cases, denoted here E// and H//, are addressed. The\noutput consists in a full energy balance of the problem computed from the field\nmaps. This model is based on free the GNU softwares Gmsh, GetDP and their\ninterface Onelab.\n", "  A robust code, called Low-T Thermo, has been developed to combine low-T\nthermochronological data arbitrarily to model thermal history. After apatite\nfission-track age and confined length are decoupled into two completely\nindependent data to inverse thermal history and thermal history inversion using\nmica Ar-Ar age or bedrock quartz optically stimulated luminescence age are\ndeveloped, there are eight kinds of low-T thermochronological data used to\ninverse thermal history including apatite fission-track age, apatite\nfission-track confined length, zircon fission-track age, apatite (U-Th)/He age,\nzircon (U-Th)/He age, mica Ar-Ar, bedrock quartz optically stimulated\nluminescence age and vitrinite reflectance. A total of 247 kinds of combination\nmodes can be used to jointly inverse thermal history in theory (except the\neight single methods modelling). These arbitrary combinations are helpful to\nmodel thermal history with the \"incomplete\" low-T thermochronological data set\nregarded to be unuseful for thermal history modelling and reduce experimental\ncost. For arbitrary combination of different low-T thermochronological data,\neach low-T thermochronological method is independent incompletely and the\nequivalent p-value is used to be the identical evaluation indicator in the\ninverse process. The usefulness of the code is demonstrated by modelling\nthermal history of existing low-T thermochronological data in the areas of\nDabie Mountain, Ahimanawa Range and Southern Alps.\n", "  In this work, we extend and analyze the nonperturbative\nMaxwell-Schr\\\"odinger-Plasma (MASP) model. This model was proposed to describe\nthe high order optical nonlinearities, and the low density free electron plasma\ngenerated by a laser pulse propagating in a gas. The MASP model is based on\nnonasymptotic, ab-initio equations, and accurately uses self-consistent\ndescription of micro (quantum)- and macro (field)- variables. However, its\nmajor drawback is a high computational cost, which in practice means that only\nshort propagation lengths can be calculated. In order to reduce this cost, we\nstudy the MASP models enriched by a macroscopic evolution equation for\npolarization, from its simplest version in a form of transport equation, to\nmore complex nonlinear variants. We show that homogeneous transport equation is\na more universal tool to simulate the high harmonic spectra at shorter times\nand/or at a lower computational cost, while the nonlinear equation could be\nuseful for modeling the pulse profiles when the ionization level is moderate.\nThe gain associated with the considered modifications of the MASP model, being\nexpressed in reduction of computational time and the number of processors\ninvolved, is of 2-3 orders of magnitude.\n", "  The influence of cohesion among members of dyads is investigated in scenarios\ncharacterized by uni-directional flow by means of a discrete model: a corridor\nand the egress from a room with a bottleneck of varying width are simulated.\nThe model manages the dynamics of simulated group members with an adaptive\nmechanism, balancing the probability of movement according to the dispersion of\nthe group; the cohesion mechanism is calibrated through the parameters\n$\\kappa_c$ and $\\delta$. All scenarios are simulated with two procedures:\n(Proc. 1) population composed of individual pedestrians, in order to validate\nthe simulation model and to provide baseline data; (Proc. 2) population\nincluding dyads (50% of the simulated pedestrians), in order to verify their\nimpact. In the corridor scenario, the presence of dyads causes a reduction of\nthe velocities and specific flow at medium-high densities. Egress from a square\nroom with a unique central exit produces results in line with recent studies in\nthe literature, but also shows that the dyads negatively affect the dynamics,\nleading generally to a slower walking speed and a lower pedestrian flow.\nIgnoring the presence of dyads would lead to an overestimation of egress flows.\n", "  A multi-physics model for shale gas production in fractured system, that\ncouples real gas property, nano-flow mechanism and geomechanics\n", "  The five-component profile of the 2.7-ms pulsar J0337+1715 appears to exhibit\nthe best example to date of a core/double-cone emission-beam structure in a\nmillisecond pulsar (MSP). Moreover, three other MSPs, the Binary Pulsar\nB1913+16, B1953+29 and J1022+1001, seem to exhibit core/single-cone profiles.\nThese configurations are remarkable and important because it has not been clear\nwhether MSPs and slow pulsars exhibit similar emission-beam configurations,\ngiven that they have considerably smaller magnetospheric sizes and magnetic\nfield strengths. MSPs thus provide an extreme context for studying pulsar radio\nemission. Particle currents along the magnetic polar flux tube connect\nprocesses just above the polar cap through the radio-emission region to the\nlight-cylinder and the external environment. In slow pulsars radio-emission\nheights are typically about 500 km around where the magnetic field is nearly\ndipolar, and estimates of the physical conditions there point to radiation\nbelow the plasma frequency and emission from charged solitons by the curvature\nprocess. We are able to estimate emission heights for the four MSPs and carry\nout a similar estimation of physical conditions in their much lower emission\nregions. We find strong evidence that MSPs also radiate by curvature emission\nfrom charged solitons.\n", "  We study dilepton, proton-antiproton and diphoton production in\nultraperipheral lead-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 and 5.5\nTeV. The nuclear calculations are based on equivalent photon approximation in\nthe impact parameter space. For correct description of the $\\gamma\\gamma \\to\np\\bar{p} $ Belle data we include the proton-exchange, the $f_2(1270)$ and\n$f_2(1950)$ s-channel exchanges, as well as the handbag mechanism. For four\nmuon production, we take into account electromagnetic (two-photon)\ndouble-scattering production and direct $\\gamma\\gamma$ production of four muons\nin one scattering. The cross sections for elementary $\\gamma\\gamma \\to\n\\gamma\\gamma$ subprocess are calculated including three different mechanisms:\nbox diagrams with leptons and quarks in the loops, a VDM-Regge contribution\nwith virtual intermediate hadronic excitations of the photons and the two-gluon\nexchange contribution. We find that the cross section for elastic\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ scattering could be measured in the lead-lead collisions for the\ndiphoton invariant mass up to $W_{\\gamma\\gamma} \\approx$ 15 - 20 GeV. Our\nStandard Model predictions are compared with a recent ATLAS experimental\nresult.\n  We discuss results for PbPb$\\to$PbPb$\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$,\nPbPb$\\to$PbPb$e^+e^-e^+e^-$, PbPb$\\to$PbPb$p\\bar{p}$ and\nPbPb$\\to$PbPb$\\gamma\\gamma$ reactions at LHC energy.\n", "  A system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with forcing function\nis developed to model evolution processes in complex systems. In this system R,\nC, and P are the resource, consumption, and production functions\ncorrespondingly. F is the forcing function. Two cases F=0, and F=A+Bsin(omega x\nt) are considered. It is shown that if F=0, there exist an unstable periodic\nsolution for a certain set of system coefficients. In the case of periodic\nforcing, system has an attractor solution. The system developed may have a wide\nrange of applications: in biological and social sciences, in economics, in\necology, and, as well, in modeling climate. A correspondence between the\ntheoretical (numerical) solution and Late Pleistocene climate data dynamics is\nanalyzed on a qualitative level.\n", "  The energy distribution of an ultracold rubidium ion beam, which is intended\nto be used as the source for a focused ion beam instrument, is measured with a\nretarding field analyzer. The ions are created from a laser-cooled and\ncompressed atomic beam by two-step photoionization in which the ionization\nlaser power is enhanced in a build-up cavity. Particle tracing simulations are\nperformed to ensure the analyzer is able to resolve the distribution. The\nlowest achieved full width 50% energy spread is $\\left(0.205\\pm0.006\\right)$\neV. The energy spread originates from the variation in the ionization position\nof the ions which are created inside an extraction electric field. This\nextraction field is essential to limit disorder-induced heating which can\ndecrease the ion beam brightness. The ionization position distribution is\nlimited by a tightly focused excitation laser beam. Energy distributions are\nmeasured for various ionization and excitation laser intensities and compared\nwith calculations based on numerical solutions of the optical Bloch equations\nincluding ionization. A good agreement is found between measurements and\ncalculations.\n", "  We use boundary element simulations to study the interaction of model\nmicroswimmers with a neutrally buoyant spherical particle. The ratio of the\nsize of the particle to that of the swimmer is varied from $R^\\mathrm{P} /\nR^\\mathrm{S} \\ll 1$, corresponding to swimmer--tracer scattering, to\n$R^\\mathrm{P} / R^\\mathrm{S} \\gg 1$, approximately equivalent to the swimmer\ninteracting with a fixed, flat surface. We find that details of the swimmer and\nparticle trajectories vary for different swimmers. However, the overall\ncharacteristics of the scattering event fall into two regimes, depending on the\nrelative magnitudes of the impact parameter, $\\rho$, and the collision radius,\n$R^\\mathrm{coll}=R^\\mathrm{P} + R^\\mathrm{S}$. The range of particle motion,\ndefined as the maximum distance between two points on the trajectory, has only\na weak dependence on the impact parameter when $\\rho < R^\\mathrm{coll}$ and\ndecreases with the radius of the particle. In contrast, when\n$\\rho>R^\\mathrm{coll}$ the range decreases as a power law in $\\rho$ and is\ninsensitive to the size of the particle. We also demonstrate that large\nparticles can cause swimmers to be deflected through large angles. In some\ninstances, this swimmer deflection can lead to larger net displacements of the\nparticle. Based on these results, we estimate the effective diffusivity of a\nparticle in a dilute bath of swimmers and show that there is a non-monotonic\ndependence on particle radius. Similarly, we show that the effective\ndiffusivity of a swimmer scattering in a suspension of particles varies\nnon-monotonically with particle radius.\n", "  Giant Radio Galaxies (GRG) are those whose linear size projected on the sky\nexceeds one Megaparsec (1 Mpc = 3.09e22 m = 3.3 million light years). Since\nonly about 300 of these have been reported in literature, we used two recent\ndeep radio surveys to search for further examples of these rare objects. Here\nwe describe the discovery of several new GRGs in these surveys.\n", "  We aim to investigate the theory of Lorentz violation with an invariant\nminimum speed so-called Symmetrical Special Relativity (SSR) from the viewpoint\nof its metric. Thus we should explore the nature of SSR-metric in order to\nunderstand the origin of the conformal factor that appears in the metric by\ndeforming Minkowski metric by means of an invariant minimum speed that breaks\ndown Lorentz symmetry. So we are able to realize that there is a similarity\nbetween SSR and a new space with variable negative curvature ($-\\infty<\\mathcal\nR<0$) connected to a set of infinite cosmological constants\n($0<\\Lambda<\\infty$), working like an extended de Sitter (dS) relativity, so\nthat such extended dS-relativity has curvature and cosmological \"constant\"\nvarying in the time. We obtain a scenario that is more similar to dS-relativity\ngiven in the approximation of a slightly negative curvature for representing\nthe current universe having a tiny cosmological constant. Finally we show that\nthe invariant minimum speed provides the foundation for understanding the\nkinematics origin of the extra dimension considered in dS-relativity in order\nto represent the dS-length.\n", "  We consider super Yang-Mills theory on supermanifolds $\\mathcal{M}^{(D|m)}$\nusing integral forms. The latter are used to define a geometric theory of\nintegration and are essential for a consistent action principle. The\nconstruction relies on Picture Changing Operators $\\mathbb{Y}^{(0|m)}$,\nanalogous to those introduced in String Theory, that admit the geometric\ninterpretation of Poincar\\'e duals of closed submanifolds of superspace\n$\\mathcal{S}^{(D|0)} \\subset \\mathcal{M}^{(D|m)}$ having maximal bosonic\ndimension $D$. We discuss the case of Super-Yang-Mills theory in $D=10$ with\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and we show how to retrieve its pure-spinor\nformulation from the rheonomic lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{rheo}$ of D'Auria,\nFr\\'e and Da Silva, choosing a suitable $\\mathbb{Y}^{(0|m)}_{ps}$. From the\nsame lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{rheo}$, with another choice\n$\\mathbb{Y}^{(0|m)}_{comp}$ of the PCO, one retrieves the component form of the\nSYM action. Equivalence of the formulations is ensured when the corresponding\nPCO.s are cohomologous, which is true, in this case, of\n$\\mathbb{Y}^{(0|m)}_{ps}$ and $\\mathbb{Y}^{(0|m)}_{comp}$.\n", "  The JUICE mission will perform detailed measurements of the properties of the\nGalilean moons, with a nominal in-system science-mission duration of about 3.5\nyears. Using both the radio tracking data, and (Earth- and JUICE-based) optical\nastrometry, the dynamics of the Galilean moons will be measured to\nunprecedented accuracy. This will provide crucial input to the determination of\nthe ephemerides and physical properties of the system, most notably the\ndissipation in Io and Jupiter.\n  The data from Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE)\nwill provide the lateral position of the spacecraft in the ICRF. In this\narticle, we analyze the relative quantitative influence of the JUICE-PRIDE\nobservables to the determination of the ephemerides of the Jovian system and\nthe associated physical parameters.\n  We perform a covariance analysis for a broad range of mission and system\ncharacteristics. We analyze the influence of VLBI data quality, observation\nplanning, as well as the influence of JUICE orbit determination quality. This\nprovides key input for the further development of the PRIDE observational\nplanning and ground segment development.\n  Our analysis indicates that the VLBI data are especially important for\nconstraining the dynamics of Ganymede and Callisto perpendicular to their\norbital planes. Also, the use of the VLBI data makes the uncertainty in the\nephemerides less dependent on the error in the orbit determination of the JUICE\nspacecraft itself. Furthermore, we find that optical astrometry data of\nespecially Io using the JANUS instrument will be crucial for stabilizing the\nsolution of the normal equations. Knowledge of the dissipation in the Jupiter\nsystem cannot be improved using satellite dynamics obtained from JUICE data\nalone, the uncertainty in Io's dissipation obtained from our simulations is\nsimilar to the present level of uncertainty.\n", "  Liquid metal flow behavior under magnetic field and electric current is\ninvestigated in experiment and numerical simulations. Several aspects of the\nresulted Lorentz force action are discussed and demonstrated. The enhanced flow\nmixing induced by the non-uniform current density appears to be crucial for the\nheat transfer efficiency. Also the outflow heat flux is strongly affected by\nthe action of the \\JxB force.\n", "  We study triple-parton scattering effects in open charm production in\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC. Predictions for one, two and three $c\\bar\nc$ pairs production are given for $\\sqrt{s}= 7$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV.\nQuite large cross sections, of the order of milibarns, for the triple-parton\nscattering mechanism are obtained. We suggest a measurement of three $D^{0}$ or\nthree $\\bar{D^{0}}$ mesons by the LHCb collaboration. The predicted visible\ncross sections are of the order of a few nanobarns. The counting rates\nincluding $D^{0} \\to K^{-}\\pi^{+}$ branching fractions are also given. We\npredict that at $\\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV a few thousands of events of triple-$D^{0}$\nproduction can be observed by the LHCb collaboration.\n", "  We present several differential distributions for the associated production\nof charm and dijets. Both single-parton scattering (SPS) and double-parton\nscattering (DPS) contributions are calculated in the $k_T$-factorization\napproach. We have found regions of the phase space where the SPS contribution\nis negligible compared to the DPS one. The distribution in transverse momentum\nof charmed mesons as well as azimuthal correlations\n($D^0\\mathrm{\\textit{-jet}}$, $D^0 \\overline{D^0}$) can be used for\nexperimental identification of the DPS effects.\n", "  The relationship of friends in social networks can be strong or weak. Some\nresearch works have shown that a close relationship between friends conducts\ngood community structure. Based on this result, we propose an effective method\nin detecting community structure in social networks based on the closeness of\nrelations among neighbors. This method calculates the gravity between each\nneighbor node to core nodes, then makes judgement if the node should be\nclassified in the community or not, and finally form the process of community\ndetection. The experimental results show that the proposed method can mine the\nsocial structure efficiently with a low computational complexity\n", "  Thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) particles of a nearly\nconstant swelling ratio and with polydispersity indices (PDIs) varying over a\nwide range (7.4% - 48.9%) are synthesized to study the effects of\npolydispersity on the dynamics of suspensions of soft PNIPAM colloidal\nparticles. The PNIPAM particles are characterized using dynamic light\nscattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The zero shear\nviscosity ($\\eta_{0}$) data of these colloidal suspensions, estimated from\nrheometric experiments as a function of the effective volume fraction\n$\\phi_{eff}$ of the suspensions, increases with increase in $\\phi_{eff}$ and\nshows a dramatic increase at $\\phi_{eff}=\\phi_{0}$. The data for $\\eta_{0}$ as\na function of $\\phi_{eff}$ fits well to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT)\nequation. It is observed that increasing PDIs results in increasingly fragile\nsupercooled liquid-like behavior, with the parameter $\\phi_{0}$, extracted from\nthe fits to the VFT equation, shifting towards higher $\\phi_{eff}$. The\nobserved increase in fragility is attributed to the prevalence of dynamical\nheterogeneities (DHs) in these polydisperse suspensions, while the simultaneous\nshift in $\\phi_{0}$ is ascribed to the decoupling of the dynamics of the\nsmallest and largest particles. Finally, it is observed that the intrinsic\nnonlinearity of these suspensions, estimated at the third harmonic near\n$\\phi_{0}$ in Fourier transform oscillatory rheological experiments, increases\nwith increase in PDIs. Our results are in agreement with theoretical\npredictions and simulation results for polydisperse hard sphere colloidal\nglasses and clearly demonstrate that jammed suspensions of polydisperse\ncolloidal particles can be effectively fluidized with increasing PDIs.\n", "  The quest for large and low frequency band gaps is one of the principal\nobjectives pursued in a number of engineering applications, ranging from noise\nabsorption to vibration control, to seismic wave abatement. For this purpose, a\nplethora of complex architectures (including multi-phase materials) and\nmulti-physics approaches have been proposed in the past, often involving\ndifficulties in their practical realization.\n  To address this issue, in this work we propose an easy-to-manufacture design\nable to open large, low frequency complete Lamb band gaps exploiting a suitable\narrangement of masses and stiffnesses produced by cavities in a monolithic\nmaterial. The performance of the designed structure is evaluated by numerical\nsimulations and confirmed by Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV)\nmeasurements on an isotropic polyvinyl chloride plate in which a square ring\nregion of cross-like cavities is fabricated. The full wave field reconstruction\nclearly confirms the ability of even a limited number of unit cell rows of the\nproposed design to efficiently attenuate Lamb waves. In addition, numerical\nsimulations show that the structure allows to shift of the central frequency of\nthe BG through geometrical modifications. The design may be of interest for\napplications in which large BGs at low frequencies are required.\n", "  In this work, we combine a new form of the cell survival fraction developed\nin [29] with the Gompertz cell growth model. The result is an equation that\nmodels the cell growth/death under a radiation dose and can be applied in a\nconventional radiation treatment (we chose conventional fractionation and\nhypofractionation). Later we optimize this equation in order to obtain the\noptimal doses that reduce the tumor's size or the number of cancer cells. We\napplied our results to breast cancer data: invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and\nductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\n", "  We construct the Heisenberg counterpart of a Clifford categorification. It is\na modification of Khovanov's Heisenberg categorification. We express generators\nof the Heisenberg category as a complex of generators of the Clifford category.\nCertain vertex operators associated to the Clifford algebra are lifted to\nendofunctors of the Fock space categorification.\n", "  Scorpius is a new multi-pulse linear induction accelerator (LIA). It is\npresently planned for Scorpius to accelerate four 2-kA electron pulses to 20\nMeV from an injected energy of 2 MeV. The goal of Scorpius is to deliver a\nmulti-pulse electron beam with quality sufficient for use in flash radiography\nof large-scale explosively-driven experiments. Beam physics has a profound\neffect on the quality of multi-pulse radiographs. Beam halo or asymmetry causes\nemittance growth, which enlarges spot size, thereby degrading resolution. Beam\ncentroid motion due to instabilities is especially problematic. High-frequency\nmotion blurs the radiographic spot size, thereby degrading resolution.\nLow-frequency motion causes pulse-to-pulse wandering of the source spot,\nthereby degrading registration of successive radiographs. We use a wide range\nof tools to investigate potential beam physics problems associated with\nScorpius. In addition to analytic theory and experimental data from our\noperational LIAs, we use a number of reliable beam dynamics computer codes.\nThese include both beam envelope and particle in cell (PIC) codes.\n", "  Directed last passage percolation models on the plane, where one studies the\nweight as well as the geometry of optimizing paths (called polymers) in a field\nof i.i.d. weights, are paradigm examples of models in the KPZ universality\nclass. In this article, we consider the large deviation regime, i.e., when the\npolymer has a much smaller (lower tail) or larger (upper tail) weight than\ntypical. Precise asymptotics of large deviation probabilities have been\nobtained in a handful of the so-called exactly solvable scenarios, including\nthe Exponential (Johansson, '00) and Poissonian (Sepp\\\"al\\\"ainen, '98 and\nDeuschel, Zeitouni, '99) cases. How the geometry of the optimizing paths change\nunder such a large deviation event was considered in (Deuschel, Zeitouni, '99),\nwhere it was shown that the paths (from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$, say) remain\nconcentrated around the straight line joining the end points in the upper tail\nlarge deviation regime, but the corresponding question in the lower tail was\nleft open. We establish a contrasting behavior in the lower tail large\ndeviation regime, showing that conditioned on the latter, in both the models,\nthe optimizing paths are not concentrated around any deterministic curve. Our\nargument does not use any ingredient from integrable probability, and hence can\nbe extended to other planar last passage percolation models under fairly mild\nconditions; and also to other non-integrable settings such as high dimensions.\n", "  It is of great important to study pulsar beam shapes if we are concerned with\nemission theories and pulsar birth rate. Both observations and/or the inverse\nCompton scattering model show that different emission components are emitted\nfrom different heights. The relative longitude phase shifts due to different\nheights of emission components and to the toroidal velocity of electron are\nconsidered in this paper. Several possible observational features arising from\nthe phase shift effects are presented. The emission beams may not have circular\ncross sections although the emission regions may be symmetric with respect to\nthe magnetic axes.\n", "  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are most intense transient gamma-ray events in the\nsky when they are on together with the strong evidences (i.e. the isotropic and\ninhomogeneous distribution of GRBs detected by BASTE) that they are located at\ncosmological distances, which make them the most energetic events ever known.\nFor example, the observed radiation energies of some GRBs are equivalent to\nconvert more than one solar mass energy into radiation completely. This is\nthousand times stronger than that of supernova explosion. Unconventional energy\nmechanisms and extremely high conversion efficiency for these mysterious events\nare required. The discovery of host galaxies and association with supernovae in\nthe cosmological distances by the recently launched satellite of BeppoSAX and\nground based radio and optical telescopes in GRB afterglow provides further\nsupport to the cosmological origin of GRBs and put strong constraints on\ncentral engines of GRBs. It is the aim of this article to review the possible\ncentral engines, energy mechanisms, dynamical and spectral evolution of GRBs,\nespecially focusing on the afterglows in multi-wavebands.\n", "  It has been firmly established that there exists a tight correlation between\nthe central black hole mass and velocity dispersion (or luminosity) of\nelliptical galaxies, ``pseudobulges'' and bulges of galaxies, although the\nnature of this correlation still remains unclear. In this letter, we explore\nthe possibility of extrapolating such a correlation to less massive, spherical\nsystems like globular clusters. In particular, motivated by the apparent\nsuccess in globular cluster M15, we present an estimate of the central black\nhole mass for a number of globular clusters with available velocity dispersion\nin the literature.\n", "  Quantities characterizing temporal property, e.g. power density, coherence,\nand time lag, can be defined and calculated directly in the time domain without\nusing the Fourier transformation. Spectral hardness, variability duration, and\ncorrelation between different characteristic quantities on different time scale\ncan be studied in the time domain as well. The temporal analysis technique in\nthe time domain is a powerful tool, particularly in studying rapid variability\non short time scales (or in high frequencies). Results of studying\nvariabilities of X-rays from Cyg X-1 with the analysis technique in the time\ndomain and RXTE data reveal valuable clues to understanding production and\npropagation processes of X-rays and structure of accretion disk in the black\nhole system.\n", "  We identified 16 pulsars from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm\n(FIRST) at 1.4 GHz. Their positions and total flux densities are extracted from\nthe FIRST catalog. Comparing the source positions with those in the PSRcatalog,\nwe obtained better determined positions of PSRs J1022+1001, J1518+4904,\nJ1652+2651, and proper motion upper limits of another three pulsars PSRs\nJ0751+1807, J1012+5307, J1640+2224. Proper motions of the other 10 pulsars are\nconsistent with the values in the catalog.\n", "  In order to understand how the soft X-ray spectra vary we present the\nHardness Ratio 1 versus Count Rates (HR1-CTs) correlation of 8 Narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 Galaxies (NLS1s) and 14 Broad-line Seyfert1 Galaxies (BLS1s) obtained\nduring the ROSAT PSPC pointing observations. According to our criteria, six of\nthe NLS1s show a positive HR1-CTs correlation, and seven of the BLS1s display\nan anti-correlation of HR1 versus CTs. The other 2 NLS1s and 7 BLS1s do not\nshow a clear HR1-CTs correlation. From these we can see that the NLS1s\nstatistically show a different spectral shape variability with flux change from\nthe BLS1s: the spectra of NLS1s become harder as total flux increases while\nthose of BLS1s soften. We attribute the different spectral variations to a\nstrong stable 'soft excess' in NLS1s, while it is weak in BLS1s. For two types\nof objects, the power law component similarly becomes softer with increasing\nintensity. These imply that the soft excess originates from the Big Blue Bump\nand power law emission is from Compton upscattering of UV or Soft X-ray\nphotons. Our results are consistent with what is widely accepted that NLS1s\nhave smaller black hole masses and higher accretion rates than BLS1s.\n", "  In paper 1 (Cheng et al. 2001) we have shown that the soft X-ray spectra of\ntwo types of Seyfert 1 galaxies statistically vary differently with increasing\nintensity. In order to understand how the spectrum of blazars changes, the\nspectral shape variability of 18 blazars observed by ROSAT/PSPC mode are\nstudied by presenting the correlation of Hardness Ratio 1 versus Count Rates\n(HR1-CTs). According to our criteria, 10 blazars show a positive HR1-CTs\nrelation, and only 2 blazars display an anti-correlation of HR1 versus CTs. The\nrest 6 blazars do not indicate any clear correlation. From these we can see\nthat most blazars of our sample statistically show a hardening spectrum during\noverall flux increase, though some vary randomly. By investigating the photon\nindex of these objects and different radiation theories, we argue that the\ndominance of the synchrotron or inverse Compton emission in the soft X-ray band\nmay interpret the dichotomy of spectral variability well, and that different\nspectral variations might represent a sequence of synchrotron peaked frequency.\n", "  1RXS J232953.9+062814 was identified as a cataclysmic variable by Wei et al.\n(1999). Four low-resolution spectra of 1RXS J232953.9+062814 were obtained by\nusing the 2.16-m telescope of the National Astronomical Observatories, in which\ntwo of them were at outburst, and the other two were at quiescence. The system\nis about 16.8 B and 16.5 V at quiescence, and 12.6 B and 12.6 V at outburst.\nThe quiescent spectra were dominated by double-peaked Balmer emissions, which\nindicates a hydrogen-rich system with a high-inclination accretion disc. MgH\nand TiO absorption bands appeared in the quiescent spectrum imply a companion\nwith a spectral type of early M dwarf. If we take it as a M0 dwarf, the system\nis located at a distance of 350 pc with a proper motion velocity 150 km\ns$^{-1}$. The superhump period of 0.046311 days (Uemura et al. 2001) was\nconfirmed by our V photometry. The short period and the hydrogen-rich nature\nreveal that this system is another SU Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova below the\nperiod minimum after V485 Centauri. 1RXS J232953.9+062814 is one of the most\nimportant systems for studying the evolutionary scenario of cataclysmic\nvariables since it is much brighter than V485 Cen.\n", "  We review several aspects of clusters of galaxies and their application to\ncosmology. We present first results of numerical simulations of the dynamics of\nthe intra-cluster gas and of different interaction processes between cluster\ngalaxies and the intra-cluster gas. In particular metallicity maps are very\nuseful to determine the importance of the different interaction processes. Also\nmass determination methods and possible sources for uncertainties in the\nmeasurements are shown.\n", "  The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be the successor to\nthe Hubble Space Telescope and may be launched as early as mid-2011. The key\nscientific goals for JWST are discovering and understanding the formation of\nthe first stars and galaxies, the evolution of galaxies and the production of\nelements by stars, and the process of star and planet formation. Within this\ncontext, we discuss the expected properties of the first stellar generations in\nthe Universe. We find that it is possible to discern truly primordial\npopulations from the next generation of stars by measuring the metallicity of\nhigh-z star forming objects. The very low background of JWST will enable it to\nimage and study first-light sources at very high redshifts, whereas its\nrelatively small collecting area limits its capability in obtaining spectra of\nz~10--15 first-light sources to either the bright end of their luminosity\nfunction or to strongly lensed sources. With a suitable investment of observing\ntime JWST will be able to detect individual Population III supernovae, thus\nidentifying the very first stars that formed in the Universe.\n", "  I present here a short personal view of our understanding of the Chandra\ndetected knots and hot spots of powerful Fanaroff Rilley (FR) II radio galaxies\nand quasars in the context of leptonic models. Observations of the knots and\nhot spots strongly suggest that the jets in these powerful sources retain their\nrelativistic velocities at large scales, all the way to the hot spots. The\nemission mechanism suggested for the knots of quasars and FR II radio galaxies\nis external Compton (EC) off the cosmic microwave backgounrd (CMB) from a\nrelativistic flow, while for the hotspots Upstream Compton (UC) scattering from\na decelerating relativistic flow.\n", "  Large-scale extragalactic jets, observed to extend from a few to a few\nhundred kiloparsecs from active galactic nuclei, are now studied over many\ndecades in frequency of electromagnetic spectrum, from radio until (possibly)\nTeV gamma rays. For hundreds of known radio jets, only about 25 are observed at\noptical frequencies. Most of them are relatively short and faint, with only a\nfew exceptions, like 3C 273 or M 87, allowing for detailed spectroscopic and\nmorphological studies. Somewhat surprisingly, the large-scale jets can be very\nprominent in X-rays. Up to now, about 25 jets were detected within the 1 - 10\nkeV energy range, although the nature of this emission is still under debate.\nIn general, both optical and X-ray jet observations present serious problems\nfor standard radiation models for the considered objects. Recent TeV\nobservations of M 87 suggest the possibility of generating large photon fluxes\nat these high energies by its extended jet.\n  In this paper we summarize information about multiwavelength emission of the\nlarge-scale jets, and we point out several modifications of the standard jet\nradiation models (connected with relativistic bulk velocities, jet radial\nstratification and particle energization all the way along the jet), which can\npossibly explain some of the mentioned puzzling observations. We also comment\non gamma-ray emission of the discussed objects.\n", "  The present common view about GRB origin is related to cosmology, what is\nbased on statistical analysis, and on measurements of the redshifts in the GRB\noptical afterglows of long GRB. No correlation is found between redshifts, GRB\nspectrum, and total GRB fluence. Comparison of KONUS and BATSE data about\nstatistics and hard X-ray lines is done, and some differences are noted. Hard\ngamma-ray afterglows, prompt optical spectra, hard X-ray lines measurements\ncould be important for farther insight into GRB origin. Possible possible\nconnection of short GRB with soft gamma repeaters is discussed.\n", "  We investigate the correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics for\nperiodically time dependent Hamiltonian systems, using the example of a\nperiodically forced particle in a one-dimensional triangular well potential. In\nparticular, we consider quantum mechanical Floquet states associated with\nresonances in the classical phase space. When the classical motion exhibits\n{\\it sub}harmonic resonances, the corresponding Floquet states maintain the\ndriving field's periodicity through dynamical tunneling. This principle applies\nboth to Floquet states associated with classical invariant vortex tubes\nsurrounding stable, elliptic periodic orbits and to Floquet states that are\nassociated with unstable, hyperbolic periodic orbits. The triangular well model\nalso poses a yet unsolved mathematical problem, related to perturbation theory\nfor systems with a dense pure point spectrum. The present approximate\nanalytical and numerical results indicate that quantum tunneling between\ndifferent resonance zones is of crucial importance for the question whether the\ndriven triangular well has a dense point or an absolutely continuous\nquasienergy spectrum, or whether there is a transition from the one to the\nother.\n", "  We describe several different representations of nilpotent step two Lie\ngroups in spaces of monogenic Clifford valued functions. We are inspired by the\nclassic representation of the Heisenberg group in the Segal-Bargmann space of\nholomorphic functions. Connections with quantum mechanics are described.\n  Keywords: Segal-Bargmann space, Heisenberg group, coherent states, wavelet\ntransform, reproducing kernel, nilpotent Lie group, monogenic functions, Dirac\noperator, Clifford algebra, (second) quantization, quantum field theory.\n"]}
