This work\nproposes an orthogonal set if the area is two non-overlapping circular pupils\nof same size. The major free parameter is the ratio of the pupil radii over the\ndistance between both circles. Increasingly higher order aberrations--as\ndefined for a virtual larger pupil in which both pupils are embedded--are fed\ninto a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to implement one unique set of basis\nfunctions. The key element is to work out the overlap integrals between a full\nset of primitive basis functions (products of powers of the distance from the\nmid-point between both pupils by azimuthal functions of the Fourier type).\n", "  Perovskite oxides are already widely used in industry and have huge potential\nfor novel device applications thanks to the rich physical behaviour displayed\nin these materials. The key to the functional electronic properties exhibited\nby perovskites is often the so-called Jahn-Teller distortion. For applications,\nan electrical control of the Jahn-Teller distortions, which is so far out of\nreach, would therefore be highly desirable. Based on universal symmetry\narguments, we determine new lattice mode couplings that can provide exactly\nthis paradigm, and exemplify the effect from first-principles calculations. The\nproposed mechanism is completely general, however for illustrative purposes, we\ndemonstrate the concept on vanadium based perovskites where we reveal an\nunprecedented orbital ordering and Jahn-Teller induced ferroelectricity. Thanks\nto the intimate coupling between Jahn-Teller distortions and electronic degrees\nof freedom, the electric field control of Jahn-Teller distortions is of general\nrelevance and may find broad interest in various functional devices.\n", "  In this paper the Turing pattern formation mechanism of a two component\nreaction-diffusion system modeling the Schnakenberg chemical reaction coupled\nto linear cross-diffusion terms is studied. The linear cross-diffusion terms\nfavors the destabilization of the constant steady state and the mechanism of\npattern formation with respect to the standard linear diffusion case, as shown\nin Madzvamuse et al. (J. Math. Biol. 2014). Since the subcritical Turing\nbifurcations of reaction-diffusion systems lead to spontaneous onset of robust,\nfinite-amplitude localized patterns, here a detailed investigation of the\nTuring pattern forming region is performed to show how the diffusion\ncoefficients for both species (the activator and the inhibitor) influence the\noccurrence of supercritical or subcritical bifurcations. The weakly nonlinear\n(WNL) multiple scales analysis is employed to derive the equations for the\namplitude of the Turing patterns and to distinguish the supercritical and the\nsubcritical pattern region, both in 1D and 2D domains. Numerical simulations\nare employed to confirm the WNL theoretical predictions through which a\nclassification of the patterns (squares, rhombi, rectangle and hexagons) is\nobtained. In particular, due to the hysteretic nature of the subcritical\nbifurcation, we observe the phenomenon of pattern transition from rolls to\nhexagons, in agreement with the bifurcation diagram.\n", "  We propose a model that reflects two important processes in R&D activities of\nfirms, the formation of R&D alliances and the exchange of knowledge as a result\nof these collaborations. In a data-driven approach, we analyze two large-scale\ndata sets extracting unique information about 7500 R&D alliances and 5200\npatent portfolios of firms. This data is used to calibrate the model parameters\nfor network formation and knowledge exchange. We obtain probabilities for\nincumbent and newcomer firms to link to other incumbents or newcomers which are\nable to reproduce the topology of the empirical R&D network. The position of\nfirms in a knowledge space is obtained from their patents using two different\nclassification schemes, IPC in 8 dimensions and ISI-OST-INPI in 35 dimensions.\nOur dynamics of knowledge exchange assumes that collaborating firms approach\neach other in knowledge space at a rate $\\mu$ for an alliance duration $\\tau$.\nBoth parameters are obtained in two different ways, by comparing knowledge\ndistances from simulations and empirics and by analyzing the collaboration\nefficiency $\\mathcal{\\hat{C}}_{n}$. This is a new measure, that takes also in\naccount the effort of firms to maintain concurrent alliances, and is evaluated\nvia extensive computer simulations. We find that R&D alliances have a duration\nof around two years and that the subsequent knowledge exchange occurs at a very\nlow rate. Hence, a firm's position in the knowledge space is rather a\ndeterminant than a consequence of its R&D alliances. From our data-driven\napproach we also find model configurations that can be both realistic and\noptimized with respect to the collaboration efficiency $\\mathcal{\\hat{C}}_{n}$.\nEffective policies, as suggested by our model, would incentivize shorter R&D\nalliances and higher knowledge exchange rates.\n", "  We investigate the interaction of narrow plasma channels formed in the\nfilamentation of ultrashort laser pulses, with a DC high voltage. The laser\nfilaments prevent electrical arcs by triggering corona that neutralize the\nhigh-voltage electrodes. This phenomenon, due to the electric field modulation\nand free electron release around the filament, opens new prospects to lightning\nand over-voltage mitigation.\n", "  The empty space (with no matter fields) is not really empty because of\nnatural metric fluctuations, quantum and classical. We show that gravitons as\nwell as classical gravitational waves of super-horizon wavelengths are able to\nform the de Sitter state of the empty homogeneous isotropic Universe. This\nstate is the exact solution to the self-consistent equations of one-loop\nquantum gravity for gravitons in the empty FLRW space. It also is the exact\nsolution to the self-consistent equations of back reaction for classical\ngravitational waves. Technically, to get this de Sitter solution in both\nquantum and classical cases, it is necessary to make the transition to\nimaginary time and then come back to real time which is possible because this\nde Sitter state is invariant with respect to Wick rotation. Such a procedure\nmeans that the time was used as a complex variable, and this fact has a deep\nbut still not understood meaning. De Sitter accelerated expansion of the empty\nUniverse naturally explains the origin of dark energy and inflation because the\nUniverse is empty at the start and by the end of its evolution. This theory is\nconsistent with the existing observational data. The CMB anisotropy of the\norder of 10^-5 is produced by fluctuations in the number of gravitons. The\nexistence of a threshold and unique coincidence of topologically impenetrable\nbarriers for tunneling takes place for the matter-dominated epoch and De Sitter\nState only. These facts provide a solution to the coincidence problem. The\ntheoretical prediction that the equation-of-state parameter should be w>-1 for\ninflation and w<-1 for dark energy is consistent with observational data. To\nprovide the reader with a complete picture, this paper gather together new and\nsome published results of the graviton theory of the origin of inflation and\ndark energy\n", "  SMeagol is a software tool to simulate highly realistic microscopy data based\non spatial systems biology models, in order to facilitate development,\nvalidation, and optimization of advanced analysis methods for live cell single\nmolecule microscopy data.

We derive\nthe BRST symmetry of effective actions corresponding to several relevant gauge\nconditions. We observe that for some gauge conditions, the restricted gauge\nstructure may complicate the formulation and effective actions, in particular,\nif the chosen gauge conditions involve the canonical momentum conjugate to the\ninduced metric on the spatial hypersurface. The BRST symmetry is extended\nfurther to the finite field-dependent BRST transformation, in order to\nestablish the mapping between different gauge conditions in each of the two\nversions of unimodular gravity.\n", "  We study the spherical cap packing problem with a probabilistic approach.\nSuch probabilistic considerations result in an asymptotic sharp universal\nuniform bound on the maximal inner product between any set of unit vectors and\na stochastically independent uniformly distributed unit vector. When the set of\nunit vectors are themselves independently uniformly distributed, we further\ndevelop the extreme value distribution limit of the maximal inner product,\nwhich characterizes its uncertainty around the bound.\n  As applications of the above asymptotic results, we derive (1) an asymptotic\nsharp universal uniform bound on the maximal spurious correlation, as well as\nits uniform convergence in distribution when the explanatory variables are\nindependently Gaussian distributed; and (2) an asymptotic sharp universal bound\non the maximum norm of a low-rank elliptically distributed vector, as well as\nrelated limiting distributions. With these results, we develop a fast detection\nmethod for a low-rank structure in high-dimensional Gaussian data without using\nthe spectrum information.\n", "  In expanding FRW spacetimes, it is usually the case that homogeneous scalar\nfields redshift and their amplitudes approach limiting values: Hubble friction\nusually ensures that the field relaxes to its minimum energy configuration,\nwhich is usually a static configuration. Here we discover a class of\nrelativistic scalar field models in which the attractor behavior is the field\noscillating indefinitely, with finite amplitude, in an expanding FRW spacetime,\ndespite the presence of Hubble friction. This is an example of spontaneous\nbreaking of time translation symmetry. We find that the effective equation of\nstate of the field has average value $\\langle w\\rangle=-1$, implying that the\nfield itself could drive an inflationary or dark energy dominated phase. This\nbehavior is reminiscent of ghost condensate models, but in the new models,\nunlike in the ghost condensate models, the energy-momentum tensor is time\ndependent, so that these new models embody a more definitive breaking of time\ntranslation symmetry. We explore (quantum) fluctuations around the homogeneous\nbackground solution, and find that low $k$-modes can be stable, while high\n$k$-modes are typically unstable. We discuss possible interpretations and\nimplications of that instability.\n", "  Microscopic Hamiltonian models of the composite system \"open system +\nenvironment\" typically do not provide the operator-sum Kraus form of the open\nsystem's dynamical map. With the use of a recently de- veloped method [16], we\nderive the Kraus operators starting from the mi- croscopic Hamiltonian model,\ni.e. from the proper master equation, of the one-qubit depolarizing channel.\nThose Kraus operators generalize the stan- dard counterparts, which are widely\nused in the literature. Comparison of the standard and the here obtained Kraus\noperators is performed via inves- tigating dynamical change of the Bloch sphere\nvolume, entropy production and the open system's state trace distance. We find\nthat the standard depo- larizing channel is more deteriorating than the\ngeneralized one.\n", "  (abridged) We explore the Frontier Fields cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 at\nz=0.3972 with VIMOS/VLT spectroscopy from the CLASH-VLT survey covering a\nregion which corresponds to almost three virial radii. We measure fluxes of 5\nemission lines of 76 cluster members enabling us to unambiguously derive O/H\ngas metallicities, and also SFRs from Halpha. For intermediate massses we find\na similar distribution of cluster and field galaxies in the MZR and mass vs.\nsSFR diagrams. Bulge-dominated cluster galaxies have on average lower sSFRs and\nhigher O/Hs compared to their disk-dominated counterparts. We use the location\nof galaxies in the projected velocity vs. position phase-space to separate our\ncluster sample into a region of objects accreted longer time ago and a region\nof recently accreted and infalling galaxies. We find a higher fraction of\naccreted metal-rich galaxies (63%) compared to the fraction of 28% of\nmetal-rich galaxies in the infalling regions. Intermediate mass galaxies\nfalling into the cluster for the first time are found to be in agreement with\npredictions of the fundamental metallicity relation. In contrast, for already\naccreted star-forming galaxies of similar masses, we find on average\nmetallicities higher than predicted by the models. This trend is intensified\nfor accreted cluster galaxies of the lowest mass bin, that display\nmetallicities 2-3 times higher than predicted by models with primordial gas\ninflow. Environmental effects therefore strongly influence gas regulations and\ncontrol gas metallicities of log(M/Msun)<10.2 (Salpeter IMF) cluster galaxies.\nWe also investigate chemical evolutionary paths of model galaxies with and\nwithout inflow of gas showing that strangulation is needed to explain the\nhigher metallicities of accreted cluster galaxies. Our results favor a\nstrangulation scenario in which gas inflow stops for log(M/Msun)<10.2 galaxies\nwhen accreted by the cluster.\n", "  We show that spinor Bose gases subject to a quadratic Zeeman effect exhibit\ncoexisting superfluidity and spin superfluidity, and study the interplay\nbetween these two distinct types of superfluidity. To illustrate that the basic\nprinciples governing these two types of superfluidity are the same, we describe\nthe magnetization and particle-density dynamics in a single hydrodynamic\nframework. In this description spin and mass supercurrents are driven by their\nrespective chemical potential gradients. As an application, we propose an\nexperimentally accessible stationary state, where the two types of\nsupercurrents counterflow and cancel each other, thus resulting in no mass\ntransport. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward setup to probe spin\nsuperfluidity by measuring the in-plane magnetization angle of the whole cloud\nof atoms. We verify the robustness of these findings by evaluating the\nfour-magnon collision time, and find that the time scale for coherent\n(superfluid) dynamics is separated from that of the slower incoherent dynamics\nby one order of magnitude. Comparing the atom and magnon kinetics reveals that\nwhile the former can be hydrodynamic, the latter is typically collisionless\nunder most experimental conditions. This implies that, while our\nzero-temperature hydrodynamic equations are a valid description of spin\ntransport in Bose gases, a hydrodynamic description that treats both mass and\nspin transport at finite temperatures may not be readily feasible.\n", "  Colour-kinematics duality suggests that Yang-Mills (YM) theory possesses some\nhidden Lie algebraic structure. So far this structure has resisted\nunderstanding, apart from some progress in the self-dual sector. We show that\nthere is indeed a Lie algebra behind the YM Feynman rules. The Lie algebra we\nuncover is the Drinfeld double of the Lie algebra of vector fields. More\nspecifically, we show that the kinematic numerators following from the YM\nFeynman rules satisfy a version of the Jacobi identity, in that the Jacobiator\nof the bracket defined by the YM cubic vertex is cancelled by the contribution\nof the YM quartic vertex. We then show that this Jacobi-like identity is in\nfact the Jacobi identity of the Drinfeld double. All our considerations are\noff-shell. Our construction explains why numerators computed using the Feynman\nrules satisfy the colour-kinematics at four but not at higher numbers of\npoints. It also suggests a way of modifying the Feynman rules so that the\nduality can continue to hold for an arbitrary number of gluons. Our\nconstruction stops short of producing explicit higher point numerators because\nof an absence of a certain property at four points. We comment on possible ways\nof correcting this, but leave the next word in the story to future work.\n", "  We present a comparative Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Density\nFunctional Tight Binding (DFTB) study of geometries and electronic structures\nof arginine (Arg), arginine adsorbed on the anatase (101) surface of titania in\nseveral adsorption configurations, and of an arginine-rich cell penetrating\npeptide TAT and its adsorption on the surface of TiO2. Two DFTB\nparameterizations are considered, tiorg-0-1/mio-1-1 and matsci-0-3. While there\nis good agreement in the structures and relative energies of Arg and peptide\nconformers between DFT and DFTB, both adsorption geometries and energies are\nnoticeably different for Arg adsorbed on TiO2. The tiorg-0-1/mio-1-1\nparameterization performs better than matsci-0-3. We relate this difference to\nthe difference in electronic structures resulting from the two methods (DFT and\nDFTB) and specifically to the band alignment between the molecule and the\noxide. We show that the band alignment of TAT and of TiO2 modeled with DFTB is\nqualitatively correct but that with DFT using the PBE functional is not. This\nis specific to the modeling of large molecules where the HOMO is close to the\nconduction band of the oxide. We therefore report a case where the approximate\nDFT-based method - DFTB (with which the correct band structure can be\neffectively obtained) - performs better than the DFT itself with a functional\napproximation feasible for the modeling of large bio-inorganic interfaces, i.e.\nGGA (as opposed to hybrid functionals which are impractical at such a scale).\nOur results highlight the utility of the DFTB method for the modeling of\nbioinorganic interfaces not only from the CPU cost perspective but also from\nthe accuracy point of view.\n", "  The properties of AMO3 perovskite oxides, where M is a 3d transition metal,\ndepend strongly on the level of covalency between the metal d and oxygen p\norbitals. With their complex spin orders and metal-insulator transition,\nrare-earth nickelates verge between dominantly ionic and covalent characters.\nAccordingly, the nature of their ground state is highly debated. Here, we\nreconcile the ionic and covalent visions of the insulating state of nickelates.\nThrough first-principles calculations, we show that it is reminiscent of the\nionic charge disproportionation picture (with strictly low-spin 4+ and\nhigh-spin 2+ Ni sites) while exhibiting strong covalence effects with oxygen\nelectrons shifted toward the depleted Ni cations, mimicking a configuration\nwith identical Ni sites. Our results further hint at strategies to control\nelectronic and magnetic phases of transition metal oxide perovskites.\n", "  The analogues of elementary particles have been extensively searched for in\ncondensed matter systems because of both scientific interests and technological\napplications. Recently massless Dirac fermions were found to emerge as low\nenergy excitations in the materials named Dirac semimetals. All the currently\nknown Dirac semimetals are nonmagnetic with both time-reversal symmetry\n$\\mathcal{T}$ and inversion symmetry $\\mathcal{P}$. Here we show that Dirac\nfermions can exist in one type of antiferromagnetic systems, where\n$\\mathcal{T}$ and $\\mathcal{P}$ are broken but their combination $\\mathcal{PT}$\nis respected. We propose orthorhombic antiferromagnet CuMnAs as a candidate,\nanalyze the robustness of the Dirac points with symmetry protections, and\ndemonstrate its distinctive bulk dispersions as well as the corresponding\nsurface states by \\emph{ab initio} calculations. Our results give a new route\ntowards the realization of Dirac materials, and provide a possible platform to\nstudy the interplay of Dirac fermion physics and magnetism.\n", "  From a detailed analysis of cone-jet cross sections in effective field\ntheory, we obtain novel factorization theorems which separate the physics\nassociated with different energy scales present in such processes. The relevant\nlow-energy physics is encoded in Wilson lines along the directions of the\nenergetic particles inside the jets. This multi-Wilson-line structure is\npresent even for narrow-cone jets due to the relevance of small-angle soft\nradiation. We discuss the renormalization-group equations satisfied by these\noperators. Their solution resums all logarithmically enhanced contributions to\nsuch processes, including non-global logarithms. Such logarithms arise in many\nobservables, in particular whenever hard phase-space constraints are imposed,\nand are not captured with standard resummation techniques. Our formalism\nprovides the basis for higher-order logarithmic resummations of jet and other\nnon-global observables. As a nontrivial consistency check, we use it to obtain\nexplicit two-loop results for all logarithmically enhanced terms in cone-jet\ncross sections and verify those against numerical fixed-order computations.\n", "  Colloidal nanoplatelets - quasi-two-dimensional sheets of semiconductor\nexhibiting efficient, spectrally pure fluorescence - form when liquid-phase\nsyntheses of spherical quantum dots are modified. Despite intense interest in\ntheir properties, the mechanism behind their anisotropic shape and precise\natomic-scale thickness remains unclear, and even counterintuitive when their\ncrystal structure is isotropic. One commonly accepted explanation is that\nnanoclusters nucleate within molecular templates and then fuse. Here, we test\nthis mechanism for zincblende nanoplatelets and show that they form instead due\nto an intrinsic instability in growth kinetics. We synthesize CdSe and\nCdS1-xSex nanoplatelets in template- and solvent-free isotropic melts\ncontaining only cadmium carboxylate and chalcogen, a finding incompatible with\nprevious explanations. Our model, based on theoretical results showing enhanced\ngrowth on narrow surface facets, rationalizes nanoplatelet formation and\nexperimental dependencies on temperature, time, and carboxylate length. Such\nunderstanding should lead to improved syntheses, controlled growth on surfaces,\nand broader libraries of nanoplatelet materials.\n", "  We show that 3D gravity, in its pure connection formulation, admits a natural\n6D interpretation. The 3D field equations for the connection are equivalent to\n6D Hitchin equations for the Chern-Simons 3-form in the total space of the\nprincipal bundle over the 3-dimensional base. Turning this construction around\none gets an explanation of why the pure connection formulation of 3D gravity\nexists. More generally, we interpret 3D gravity as the dimensional reduction of\nthe 6D Hitchin theory. To this end, we show that any SU(2) invariant closed\n3-form in the total space of the principal SU(2) bundle can be parametrised by\na connection together with a 2-form field on the base. The dimensional\nreduction of the 6D Hitchin theory then gives rise to 3D gravity coupled to a\ntopological 2-form field.\n", "  We evaluate the impact of radiative corrections in the ratios $\\Gamma[B\\to M\n\\mu^+\\mu^-]/\\Gamma[B\\to M e^+e^-]$ when the meson $M$ is a $K$ or a $K^*$.\nEmploying the cuts on $m^2_{\\ell\\ell}$ and the reconstructed $B$-meson mass\npresently applied by the LHCb Collaboration, such corrections do not exceed a\nfew $\\%$. Moreover, their effect is well described (and corrected for) by\nexisting Montecarlo codes. Our analysis reinforces the interest of these\nobservables as clean probe of physics beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  Occupation of an interval by self-replicating initial pulses is studied\nnumerically. Two different approximates in different categories are proposed\nfor the numerical solutions of some initial-boundary value problems. The sinc\ndifferential quadrature combined with third-fourth order implicit Rosenbrock\nand exponential B-spline collocation methods are setup to obtain the numerical\nsolutions of the mentioned problems. The numerical simulations containing\noccupation of single initial pulse, non or slow occupation model and covering\nthe domain with two initial pulses are demonstrated by using both proposed\nmethods.\n", "  This experimental review gives an overview of top-quark measurements\nperformed by the two general purpose-detectors ATLAS and CMS during the first\nfew years of running of the Large Hadron Collider. In the years 2010 - 2012\neach experiment collected 5 fb$^{-1}$ of pp collision data at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$\nTeV and 20 fb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV, allowing detailed studies of\ntop-quark production and decays, and measurements of the properties of the top\nquark with unprecedented precision.\n", "  We consider photoemission from cuprate high-temperature superconductors\ntaking into account joint relaxation of strongly coupled fields: a field of\ncorrelated electrons and phonon field. Such relaxation occurs in systems with\npredominantly long-range electron-phonon interaction at sufficiently high\ncarrier concentration due to coexistence of autolocalized and delocalized\ncarriers. A simple method to calculate analytically a high-energy part of the\nARPES spectrum arising is proposed. The approach suggested yields all the\nhigh-energy spectral features like broad bands of Gaussian shape and vertical\ndispersion patterns being in good quantitative agreement with the experiments\nat any doping with both types of carriers. Demonstrated coexistence of\nautolocalized and delocalized carriers in cuprate superconductors is important\nfor understanding their transport and magnetic properties. Presence of\nlarge-radius autolocalized carriers shown may be helpful in explanation of\ncharge ordering in doped cuprates.\n", "  We investigate the prospects to systematically improve generic effective\nfield theory-based searches for new physics in the top sector during LHC run 2\nas well as the high luminosity phase. In particular, we assess the benefits of\nhigh momentum transfer final states on top EFT-fit as a function of systematic\nuncertainties in comparison with sensitivity expected from fully-resolved\nanalyses focusing on $t\\bar t$ production. We find that constraints are\ntypically driven by fully-resolved selections, while boosted top quarks can\nserve to break degeneracies in the global fit. This demystifies and clarifies\nthe importance of high momentum transfer final states for global fits to new\ninteractions in the top sector from direct measurements.\n", "  Point-wise localization of individual fluorophores is a critical step in\nsuper-resolution microscopy and single particle tracking. Although the methods\nare limited by the accuracy in localizing individual flourophores, this\npoint-wise accuracy has so far only been estimated by theoretical best case\napproximations, disregarding for example motional blur, out of focus broadening\nof the point spread function and time varying changes in the fluorescence\nbackground. Here, we show that pointwise localization uncertainty can be\naccurately estimated directly from imaging data using a Laplace approximation\nconstrained by simple mircoscope properties. We further demonstrate that the\nestimated localization uncertainty can be used to improve downstream\nquantitative analysis, such as estimation of diffusion constants and detection\nof changes in molecular motion patterns. Most importantly, the accuracy of\nactual point localizations in live cell super-resolution microscopy can be\nimproved beyond the information theoretic lower bound for localization errors\nin individual images, by modeling the fluorophores' movement and accounting for\ntheir point-wise localization uncertainty.\n", "  A dark radiation term arises as a correction to the energy momentum tensor in\nthe simplest five-dimensional RS-II brane-world cosmology. In this paper we\nrevisit the constraints on dark radiation based upon the newest results for\nlight-element nuclear reaction rates, observed light-element abundances and the\npower spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Adding dark radiation\nduring big bang nucleosynthesis alters the Friedmann expansion rate causing the\nnuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature. This changes the\nfinal light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its influence on the CMB is\nto change the effective expansion rate at the surface of last scattering. We\nfind that our adopted BBN constraints reduce the allowed range for dark\nradiation to between $-12.1\\%$ and $+6.2\\%$ of the ambient background energy\ndensity. Combining this result with fits to the CMB power spectrum, the range\ndecreases to $-6.0\\%$ to $+6.2\\%$. Thus, we find, that the ratio of dark\nradiation to the background total relativistic mass energy density $\\rho_{\\rm\nDR}/\\rho$ is consistent with zero although in the BBN analysis there could be a\nslight preference for a negative contribution. However, the BBN constraint\ndepends strongly upon the adopted primordial helium abundance.\n", "  The monodromy of torus bundles associated to completely integrable systems\ncan be computed using geometric techniques (constructing homology cycles) or\nanalytic arguments (computing discontinuities of abelian integrals). In this\narticle we give a general approach to the computation of monodromy that\nresembles the analytical one, reducing the problem to the computation of\nresidues of polar 1-forms. We apply our technique to three celebrated examples\nof systems with monodromy (the champagne bottle, the spherical pendulum, the\nhydrogen atom) and to the case of non degenerate focus-focus singularities,\nre-obtaining the classical results. An advantage of this approach is that the\nresidue-like formula can be shown to be local in a neighborhood of a\nsingularity, hence allowing the definition of monodromy also in the case of\nnon-compact fibers. This idea has been introduced in the literature under the\nname of scattering monodromy. We prove the coincidence of the two definitions\nwith the monodromy of an appropriately chosen compactification.\n", "  We study eigenvalues of quantum open baker's maps with trapped sets given by\nlinear arithmetic Cantor sets of dimensions $\\delta\\in (0,1)$. We show that the\nsize of the spectral gap is strictly greater than the standard bound\n$\\max(0,{1\\over 2}-\\delta)$ for all values of $\\delta$, which is the first\nresult of this kind. The size of the improvement is determined from a fractal\nuncertainty principle and can be computed for any given Cantor set. We next\nshow a fractal Weyl upper bound for the number of eigenvalues in annuli, with\nexponent which depends on the inner radius of the annulus.\n", "  Topological connections in the single-streaming voids and multistreaming\nfilaments and walls reveal a cosmic web structure different from traditional\nmass density fields. A single void structure not only percolates the\nmultistream field in all the directions, but also occupies over 99 per cent of\nall the single-streaming regions. Sub-grid analyses on scales smaller than\nsimulation resolution reveal tiny pockets of voids that are isolated by\nmembranes of the structure. For the multistreaming excursion sets, the\npercolating structure is significantly thinner than the filaments in\nover-density excursion approach.\n  Hessian eigenvalues of the multistream field are used as local geometrical\nindicators of dark matter structures. Single-streaming regions have most of the\nzero eigenvalues. Parameter-free conditions on the eigenvalues in the\nmultistream region may be used to delineate primitive geometries with\nconcavities corresponding to filaments, walls and haloes.\n", "  We consider a general class of four-dimensional geometries admitting a null\nvector field that has no twist and no shear but has an arbitrary expansion. We\nexplicitly present the Petrov classification of such Robinson-Trautman (and\nKundt) gravitational fields, based on the algebraic properties of the Weyl\ntensor. In particular, we determine all algebraically special subcases when the\noptically privileged null vector field is a multiple principal null direction\n(PND), as well as all the cases when it remains a single PND. No field\nequations are a priori applied, so that our classification scheme can be used\nin any metric theory of gravity in four dimensions. In the classic Einstein\ntheory this reproduces previous results for vacuum spacetimes, possibly with a\ncosmological constant, pure radiation and electromagnetic field, but can be\napplied to an arbitrary matter content. As non-trivial explicit examples we\ninvestigate specific algebraic properties of the Robinson-Trautman spacetimes\nwith a free scalar field, and also black hole spacetimes in the pure\nEinstein-Weyl gravity.\n", "  We briefly recollect the problem of significant hyperon polarization\nemphasizing the role of spin in dynamics of hadron interactions. We provide\nalso some model predictions based on chiral dynamics and the impact parameter\npicture for illustration. The old, but yet unsolved problem of hyperon\npolarization, can obtain a new insight from the measurements at the LHC\nenergies and, in combination with other measurements, can be used for tagging\nQGP formation in $pp$--collisions.\n", "  We present an update of the Monte Carlo event generator TAUOLA for tau lepton\ndecays, with substantially increased list of decay channels and new\ninitialization options. The core of the program remains written in FORTRAN but\nnecessary arrangements have been made to allow handling of the user-provided\nhadronic currents and matrix elements at the execution time. Such solution may\nsimplify preparation of new hadronic currents and may be useful for fitting to\nthe experimental data as well.\n  We have implemented as default for TAUOLA a set of hadronic currents, which\nis compatible with the default initialization used by BaBar collaboration.\nOptions for currents available in previous releases are still stored in the\ncode, sometimes left defunct or activated by internal flags only. The new\nversion of the program, includes also implementation of Lepton Flavour\nViolating tau decays.\n  Finally, we present, as an example, a set of C++ methods for handling\nuser-provided currents, matrix elements or complete new decay channels\ninitialization which can be performed at the program execution time.\n", "  The renormalization group method is applied in order to analyze models E and\nF of critical dynamics in the presence of velocity fluctuations generated by\nthe stochastic Navier-Stokes equation. Results are given to the one-loop\napproximation for the anomalous dimension $\\gamma_\\lambda$ and fixed-points'\nstructure. The dynamic exponent $z$ is calculated in the turbulent regime and\nstability of the fixed points for the standard model E is discussed.\n", "  We consider the problem of reproducing the correlations obtained by arbitrary\nlocal projective measurements on the two-qubit Werner state $\\rho = v |\\psi_- >\n<\\psi_- | + (1- v ) \\frac{1}{4}$ via a local hidden variable (LHV) model, where\n$|\\psi_- >$ denotes the singlet state. We show analytically that these\ncorrelations are local for $ v = 999\\times689\\times{10^{-6}}$ $\\cos^4(\\pi/50)\n\\simeq 0.6829$. In turn, as this problem is closely related to a purely\nmathematical one formulated by Grothendieck, our result implies a new bound on\nthe Grothendieck constant $K_G(3) \\leq 1/v \\simeq 1.4644$. We also present a\nLHV model for reproducing the statistics of arbitrary POVMs on the Werner state\nfor $v \\simeq 0.4553$. The techniques we develop can be adapted to construct\nLHV models for other entangled states, as well as bounding other Grothendieck\nconstants.\n", "  Thermodynamics and kinetics of Li, Na, and Mg storage in Ge is studied ab\ninitio. The most stable configurations can consist of tetrahedral,\nsubstitutional, or a combination of the two types of sites. In the dilute\nlimit, Li, Na prefer interstitial, while Mg prefers substitutional sites. At\nhigher concentrations of Li, Na, and Mg, there is a combination of interstitial\nand substitutional sites. This is an important finding, as previous ab initio\nstudies of alloying type electrode materials ignored substitutional sites.\nInsertion energies computed at dilute concentration (x = 1/64) show that Na and\nMg insertion are not thermodynamically favored in Ge vs formation of bulk Na\nand Mg, as opposed to Li insertion which is favored. We investigate the effect\nof p-doping of Ge (with Ga) on the thermodynamics and find that it considerably\nlowers the defect formation energies associated with the insertion of Li/Na/Mg\nat tetrahedral sites. On the other hand, the energetics associated with\nLi/Na/Mg insertion at substitutional sites are not significantly affected. In\naddition, we compute the migration energy barriers for Li/Na/Mg diffusion\nbetween two tetrahedral sites (0.38/0.79/0.66 eV), between two substitutional\nsites (0.77/0.93/1.83 eV), and between two sites of different type\n(2.15/1.75/0.85 eV).\n", "  We investigate the viscous evolution of the accretion disk in 4U 1543-47, a\nblack hole binary system, during the first 30 days after the peak of the 2002\nburst by comparing the observed and theoretical accretion rate evolution $\\dot\nM(t)$. The observed $\\dot M(t)$ is obtained from spectral modelling of the\narchival RXTE/PCA data. Different scenarios of disk decay evolution are\npossible depending on a degree of self-irradiation of the disk by the emission\nfrom its centre. If the self-irradiation, which is parametrized by factor\n$C_\\mathrm{irr}$, had been as high as $\\sim 5\\times10^{-3}$, then the disk\nwould have been completely ionized up to the tidal radius and the short time of\nthe decay would have required the turbulent parameter $\\alpha\\sim 3$. We find\nthat the shape of the $\\dot M(t)$ curve is much better explained in a model\nwith a shrinking high-viscosity zone. If $C_\\mathrm{irr}\\approx(2-3)\\times\n10^{-4}$, the resulting $\\alpha$ lie in the interval $0.5-1.5$ for the black\nhole masses in the range $6-10~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, while the radius of the\nionized disk is variable and controlled by irradiation. For very weak\nirradiation, $C_\\mathrm{irr} < 1.5 \\times10^{-4}$, the burst decline develops\nas in normal outbursts of dwarf novae with $\\alpha \\sim 0.08-0.32$. The optical\ndata indicate that $C_\\mathrm{irr}$ in 4U 1543-47 (2002) was not greater than\napproximately $(3-6)\\times10^{-4}$. Generally, modelling of an X-ray nova burst\nallows one to estimate $\\alpha$ that depends on the black hole parameters. We\npresent the public 1-D code Freddi to model the viscous evolution of an\naccretion disk. Analytic approximations are derived to estimate $\\alpha$ in\nX-ray novae using $\\dot M(t)$.\n", "  Self-dual gravity is a diffeomorphism invariant theory in four dimensions\nthat describes two propagating polarisations of the graviton and has a negative\nmass dimension coupling constant. Nevertheless, this theory is not only\nrenormalisable but quantum finite, as we explain. We also collect various facts\nabout self-dual gravity that are scattered across the literature.\n", "  This paper proves that if eternal neutral black holes satisfy some general\nconditions and matter fields only appear in the outside of the Killing horizon,\nthe strong energy condition is a sufficient condition to insure that the vacuum\nSchwarzschild black hole has the fastest action growth of the same total\nenergy. This result is consistent with the bound of computational complexity\ngrowth rate and gives a strong evidence for the holographic complexity-action\nconjecture.\n", "  Statistical physics provides the concepts and methods to explain the phase\nbehavior of interacting many-body systems. Investigations of Lee-Yang zeros ---\ncomplex singularities of the free energy in systems of finite size --- have led\nto a unified understanding of equilibrium phase transitions. The ideas of Lee\nand Yang, however, are not restricted to equilibrium phenomena. Recently,\nLee-Yang zeros have been used to characterize non-equilibrium processes such as\ndynamical phase transitions in quantum systems after a quench or dynamic\norder-disorder transitions in glasses. Here, we experimentally realize a scheme\nfor determining Lee-Yang zeros in such non-equilibrium settings. We extract the\ndynamical Lee-Yang zeros of a stochastic process involving Andreev tunneling\nbetween a normal-state island and two superconducting leads from measurements\nof the dynamical activity along a trajectory. From the short-time behavior of\nthe Lee-Yang zeros, we predict the large-deviation statistics of the activity\nwhich is typically difficult to measure. Our method paves the way for further\nexperiments on the statistical mechanics of many-body systems out of\nequilibrium.\n", "  Given recent progress in the realization of Majorana zero modes in\nsemiconducting nanowires with proximity-induced superconductivity, a crucial\nnext step is to attempt an experimental demonstration of the predicted braiding\nstatistics associated with the Majorana mode. Such a demonstration should, in\nprinciple, confirm that observed zero-bias anomalies are indeed indicative of\nthe presence of anyonic Majorana zero modes. Moreover, such a demonstration\nwould be a breakthrough at the level of fundamental physics: the first clear\ndemonstration of a non-Abelian excitation. It is therefore important to clarify\nthe expected signals of Majorana physics in the braiding context, and to\ndifferentiate these signals from those that might also arise in non-topological\nvariants of the same system. A definitive and critical distinction between\nsignals expected in topological (i.e. anyonic) and non-topological (i.e.\ntrivial) situations is therefore essential for future progress in the field. In\nthis manuscript, we carefully examine the expected signals of braiding and\nfusion experiments in topological and non-topological variants of the\nexperimental nanowire systems in which Majoranas are predicted to occur. We\npoint out situations where `trivial' and `anyonic' signatures may be similar\nexperimentally, necessitating a certain level of caution in the interpretation\nof various proposed fusion and braiding experiments. We find in particular that\nbraiding experiments consisting of full braids (two Majorana exchanges) are\nbetter at distinguishing between topological and non-topological systems than\nfusion experiments or experiments with an odd number of Majorana exchanges.\n", "  The coalescence of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) produces powerful\ngravitational-wave (GW) radiation and, if gas is present in the vicinity, also\nan electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. In the standard picture, an EM outburst\nwill be produced when the binary \"decouples\" from the circum-binary disc and\nstarts \"squeezing\" the disc inside the secondary orbit, resulting in its quick\naccretion on to the primary black hole. Here we use analytical arguments and\nnumerical simulations to show that the disc within about $20~R_S$ of a SMBH\nsurvives the merger without being depleted. The reason is a \"second\ndecoupling\": the inner disc thickens due to tidal heating and inefficient\ncooling, effectively decoupling from the interaction of the binary. We show\nthat this second decoupling quenches the heating sources in the disc ${\\cal\nO}(10^2)$ days before coalescence. This will render the peak UV/X-ray\nluminosity significantly weaker than previously thought. After the merger, the\nresidual disc cools down and expands, merging with the outer disc rather than\nbeing completely accreted. This results in continuous EM emission, hindering\nthe detection of the cut-off and re-brightening proposed in earlier studies.\n", "  The dynamics of isolated-photon plus one-, two- and three-jet production in\n$pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV are studied with the ATLAS\ndetector at the LHC using a data set with an integrated luminosity of 20.2\nfb$^{-1}$. Measurements of isolated-photon plus jets cross sections are\npresented as functions of the photon and jet transverse momenta. The cross\nsections as functions of the azimuthal angle between the photon and the jets,\nthe azimuthal angle between the jets, the photon-jet invariant mass and the\nscattering angle in the photon-jet centre-of-mass system are presented. The\npattern of QCD radiation around the photon and the leading jet is investigated\nby measuring jet production in an annular region centred on each object;\nenhancements are observed around the leading jet with respect to the photon in\nthe directions towards the beams. The experimental measurements are compared to\nseveral different theoretical calculations, and overall a good description of\nthe data is found.\n", "  We consider dark matter consisting of long--living particles with masses\n$10^{7}~\\lesssim~M~\\lesssim~10^{16}$ GeV decaying through hadronic channel as a\nsource of high energy neutrino. Using recent data on high energy neutrino from\nIceCube and Pierre Auger experiments we derive the upper-limits on neutrino\nflux from dark matter decay and constraints on dark matter parameter space. For\nthe dark matter masses of order $10^8$ GeV the constraints derived are slightly\nstronger than those obtained for the same dark matter model using the high\nenergy gamma-ray limits.\n", "  The recent discovery of exciton quantum emitters in transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs) has triggered renewed interest of localized excitons in\nlow-dimensional systems. Open questions remain about the microscopic origin\npreviously attributed to dopants and/or defects as well as strain potentials.\nHere we show that the quantum emitters can be deliberately induced by\nnanobubble formation in WSe2 and BN/WSe2 heterostructures. Correlations of\natomic-force microscope and hyperspectral photoluminescence images reveal that\nthe origin of quantum emitters and trion disorder is extrinsic and related to\n10 nm tall nanobubbles and 70 nm tall wrinkles, respectively. We further\ndemonstrate that hot stamping results in the absence of 0D quantum emitters and\ntrion disorder. The demonstrated technique is useful for advances in nanolasers\nand deterministic formation of cavity-QED systems in monolayer materials.\n", "  Magneto-quantum oscillation experiments in high temperature superconductors\nshow a strong thermally-induced suppression of the oscillation amplitude\napproaching critical dopings---in support of a quantum critical origin of their\nphase diagrams. We suggest that, in addition to a thermodynamic mass\nenhancement, these experiments may directly indicate the increasing role of\nquantum fluctuations that suppress the oscillation amplitude through inelastic\nscattering. We show that the traditional theoretical approaches beyond\nLifshitz-Kosevich to calculate the oscillation amplitude in correlated metals\nresult in a contradiction with the third law of thermodynamics and suggest a\nway to rectify this problem.\n", "  We present a simple and robust strategy for the selection of sampling points\nin Uncertainty Quantification. The goal is to achieve the fastest possible\nconvergence in the cumulative distribution function of a stochastic output of\ninterest. We assume that the output of interest is the outcome of a\ncomputationally expensive nonlinear mapping of an input random variable, whose\nprobability density function is known. We use a radial function basis to\nconstruct an accurate interpolant of the mapping. This strategy enables adding\nnew sampling points one at a time, adaptively. This takes into full account the\nprevious evaluations of the target nonlinear function. We present comparisons\nwith a stochastic collocation method based on the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature\nrule, and with an adaptive method based on hierarchical surplus, showing that\nthe new method often results in a large computational saving.\n", "  In the current extensive studies of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),\ncompared to hexagonal layered materials, like graphene, hBN and MoS2, low\nsymmetry layered 2D crystals showed great potential for applications in\nanisotropic devices. Rhenium diselenide (ReSe2) has the bulk space group P1 and\nbelongs to triclinic crystal system with a deformed cadmium iodide type\nstructure. Here we unambiguously determined monolayer and its vertical\norientation of rhenium diselenide membrane with an individual electron\ndiffraction pattern, which could be applicable to low symmetry crystal systems,\nincluding both triclinic and monoclinic lattices, as long as their third\nunit-cell basis vector is not perpendicular to basal plane. Atomically resolved\nimage from probe corrected annular dark field scanning transmission electron\nmicroscope (ADF-STEM) was employed to validate layer number. Finally,\nexperimental results were well explained by kinematical electron diffraction\ntheory and corresponding simulations.\n", "  The debate around the potential superiority of quantum annealers over their\nclassical counterparts has been ongoing since the inception of the field by\nKadowaki and Nishimori close to two decades ago. Recent technological\nbreakthroughs in the field, which have led to the manufacture of experimental\nprototypes of quantum annealing optimizers with sizes approaching the practical\nregime, have reignited this discussion. However, the demonstration of quantum\nannealing speedups remains to this day an elusive albeit coveted goal. Here, we\nexamine the power of quantum annealers to provide a different type of quantum\nenhancement of practical relevance, namely, their ability to serve as useful\nsamplers from the ground-state manifolds of combinatorial optimization\nproblems. We study, both numerically by simulating ideal stoquastic and\nnon-stoquastic quantum annealing processes, and experimentally, using a\ncommercially available quantum annealing processor, the ability of quantum\nannealers to sample the ground-states of spin glasses differently than\nclassical thermal samplers. We demonstrate that i) quantum annealers in general\nsample the ground-state manifolds of spin glasses very differently than thermal\noptimizers, ii) the nature of the quantum fluctuations driving the annealing\nprocess has a decisive effect on the final distribution over ground-states, and\niii) the experimental quantum annealer samples ground-state manifolds\nsignificantly differently than thermal and ideal quantum annealers. We\nillustrate how quantum annealers may serve as powerful tools when complementing\nstandard sampling algorithms.\n", "  Using a singlet-triplet spin qubit as a sensitive spectrometer of the GaAs\nnuclear spin bath, we demonstrate that the spectrum of Overhauser noise agrees\nwith a classical spin diffusion model over six orders of magnitude in\nfrequency, from 1 mHz to 1 kHz, is flat below 10 mHz, and falls as $1/f^2$ for\nfrequency $f \\! \\gtrsim \\! 1$ Hz. Increasing the applied magnetic field from\n0.1 T to 0.75 T suppresses electron-mediated spin diffusion, which decreases\nspectral content in the $1/f^2$ region and lowers the saturation frequency,\neach by an order of magnitude, consistent with a numerical model. Spectral\ncontent at megahertz frequencies is accessed using dynamical decoupling, which\nshows a crossover from the few-pulse regime ($\\lesssim \\! 16$ $\\pi$-pulses),\nwhere transverse Overhauser fluctuations dominate dephasing, to the many-pulse\nregime ($\\gtrsim \\! 32$ $\\pi$-pulses), where longitudinal Overhauser\nfluctuations with a $1/f$ spectrum dominate.\n", "  In this note we reveal a connection between the phase space of lambda models\non $S^{1}\\times \\mathbb{R}$ and the phase space of double Chern-Simons theories\non $D\\times \\mathbb{R}$ and explain in the process the origin of the\nnon-ultralocality of the Maillet bracket, which emerges as a boundary algebra.\nIn particular, this means that the (classical) $AdS_{5}\\times S^{5}$ lambda\nmodel can be understood as a double Chern-Simons theory defined on the Lie\nsuperalgebra $\\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$ after a proper dependence of the spectral\nparameter is introduced. This offers a possibility for avoiding the use of the\nproblematic non-ultralocal Poisson algebras that preclude the introduction of\nlattice regularizations and the application of the QISM to string sigma models.\nThe utility of the equivalence at the quantum level is, however, still to be\nexplored.\n", "  We derive a working model for the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation for\nquark star systems within the modified $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$-gravity class of\nmodels. We consider $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$-gravity for a static spherically\nsymmetric space-time. In this instance the metric is built from a more\nfundamental tetrad vierbein from which the metric tensor can be derived. We\nimpose a linear $f(T)$ parameter parameter, namely taking $f=\\alpha T(r) +\n\\beta \\mathcal{T}(r) + \\varphi$ and investigate the behavior of a linear\nenergy-momentum tensor trace, $\\mathcal{T}$. We also outline the restrictions\nwhich modified $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$-gravity imposes upon the coupling\nparameters. Finally we incorporate the MIT bag model in order to derive the\nmass-radius and mass-central density relations of the quark star within $f(T,\n\\mathcal{T})$-gravity.\n", "  Evolutionary games on graphs describe how strategic interactions and\npopulation structure determine evolutionary success, quantified by the\nprobability that a single mutant takes over a population. Graph structures,\ncompared to the well-mixed case, can act as amplifiers or suppressors of\nselection by increasing or decreasing the fixation probability of a beneficial\nmutant. Properties of the associated mean fixation times can be more intricate,\nespecially when selection is strong. The intuition is that fixation of a\nbeneficial mutant happens fast (in a dominance game), that fixation takes very\nlong (in a coexistence game), and that strong selection eliminates demographic\nnoise. Here we show that these intuitions can be misleading in structured\npopulations. We analyze mean fixation times on the cycle graph under strong\nfrequency-dependent selection for two different microscopic evolutionary update\nrules (death-birth and birth-death). We establish exact analytical results for\nfixation times under strong selection, and show that there are coexistence\ngames in which fixation occurs in time polynomial in population size. Depending\non the underlying game, we observe inherence of demographic noise even under\nstrong selection, if the process is driven by random death before selection for\nbirth of an offspring (death-birth update). In contrast, if selection for an\noffspring occurs before random removal (birth-death update), strong selection\ncan remove demographic noise almost entirely.\n", "  In this work, we present an experimental study of spin mediated enhanced\nnegative magnetoresistance in Ni80Fe20 (50 nm)/p-Si (350 nm) bilayer. The\nresistance measurement shows a reduction of ~2.5% for the bilayer specimen as\ncompared to 1.3% for Ni80Fe20 (50 nm) on oxide specimen for an out-of-plane\napplied magnetic field of 3T. In the Ni80Fe20-only film, the negative\nmagnetoresistance behavior is attributed to anisotropic magnetoresistance. We\npropose that spin polarization due to spin-Hall effect is the underlying cause\nof the enhanced negative magnetoresistance observed in the bilayer. Silicon has\nweak spin orbit coupling so spin Hall magnetoresistance measurement is not\nfeasible. We use V2{\\omega} and V3{\\omega} measurement as a function of\nmagnetic field and angular rotation of magnetic field in direction normal to\nelectric current to elucidate the spin-Hall effect. The angular rotation of\nmagnetic field shows a sinusoidal behavior for both V2{\\omega} and V3{\\omega},\nwhich is attributed to the spin phonon interactions resulting from the\nspin-Hall effect mediated spin polarization. We propose that the spin\npolarization leads to a decrease in hole-phonon scattering resulting in\nenhanced negative magnetoresistance.\n", "  The oxidation state of titanium in titanium dioxide is commonly assumed to be\n+4. This assumption is used ubiquitously to rationalize phenomena observed with\nTiO2. We present a comprehensive electronic structure investigation of Ti ions,\nTiO2 molecules and TiO2 bulk crystals, using different density functional\ntheory and wave function-based approaches, which suggests a lower oxidation\nstate (+3). Specifically, there is evidence of a significant remaining\ncontribution from valence s and d electrons of Ti, including the presence of a\nnuclear cusp around the Ti core. The charge corresponding to valence s and d\nstates of Ti amounts to 1 e. The commonly assumed picture may therefore have to\nbe revised.\n", "  In graphene, out-of-plane (flexural) vibrations and static ripples imposed by\nthe substrate relax the electron spin, intrinsically protected by mirror\nsymmetry. We calculate the relaxation times in different scenarios, accounting\nfor all the possible spin-phonon couplings allowed by the hexagonal symmetry of\nthe lattice. Scattering by flexural phonons imposes the ultimate bound to the\nspin lifetimes, in the ballpark of hundreds of nano-seconds at room\ntemperature. This estimate and the behavior as a function of the carrier\nconcentration are substantially altered by the presence of tensions or the\npinning with the substrate. Static ripples also influence the spin transport in\nthe diffusive regime, dominated by motional narrowing. We find that the\nD'yakonov-Perel' mechanism saturates when the mean free path is comparable to\nthe correlation length of the heights profile. In this regime, the\nspin-relaxation times are exclusively determined by the geometry of the\ncorrugations. Simple models for typical corrugations lead to lifetimes of the\norder of tens of micro-seconds.\n", "  We report the identification of four millimeter line emitting galaxies with\nthe Atacama Large Milli/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in SSA22 Field (ADF22). We\nanalyze the ALMA 1.1 mm survey data, with an effective survey area of 5\narcmin$^2$, a frequency range of 253.1--256.8 and 269.1--272.8 GHz, angular\nresolution of 0\".7 and RMS noise of 0.8 mJy beam$^{-1}$ at 36 km s$^{-1}$\nvelocity resolution. We detect four line emitter candidates with significance\nlevels above $6 \\sigma$. We identify one of the four sources as a CO(9-8)\nemitter at $z = 3.1$ in a member of the proto-cluster known in this field.\nAnother line emitter with an optical counterpart is likely a CO(4-3) emitter at\n$z = 0.7$. The other two sources without any millimeter continuum or\noptical/near-infrared counterpart are likely to be [CII] emitter candidates at\n$z = 6.0$ and $6.5$. The equivalent widths of the [CII] candidates are\nconsistent with those of confirmed high-redshift [CII] emitters and candidates,\nand are a factor of 10 times larger than that of the CO(9-8) emitter detected\nin this search. The [CII] luminosity of the candidates are $4-7 \\times 10^8~\\rm\nL_\\odot$. The star formation rates (SFRs) of these sources are estimated to be\n$10-20~\\rm M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}$ if we adopt an empirical [CII] luminosity - SFR\nrelation. One of them has a relatively low-S/N ratio, but shows features\ncharacteristic of emission lines. Assuming that at least one of the two\ncandidates is a [CII] emitter, we derive a lower limit of [CII]-based star\nformation rate density (SFRD) at $z~\\sim~6$. The resulting value of $> 10^{-2}$\n$\\rm M_\\odot yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3}$ is consistent with the dust-uncorrected UV-based\nSFRD. Future millimeter/submillimeter surveys can be used to detect a number of\nhigh redshift line emitters, with which to study the star formation history in\nthe early Universe.\n", "  We study controllable friction in a system consisting of a dark soliton in a\none-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a non-interacting Fermi\ngas. The fermions act as impurity atoms, not part of the original condensate,\nthat scatter off of the soliton. We study semi-classical dynamics of the dark\nsoliton, a particle-like object with negative mass, and calculate its friction\ncoefficient. Surprisingly, it depends periodically on the ratio of interspecies\n(impurity-condensate) to intraspecies (condensate-condensate) interaction\nstrengths. By tuning this ratio, one can access a regime where the friction\ncoefficient vanishes. We develop a general theory of stochastic dynamics for\nnegative mass objects and find that their dynamics are drastically different\nfrom their positive mass counterparts - they do not undergo Brownian motion.\nFrom the exact phase space probability distribution function (i.e. in position\nand velocity), we find that both the trajectory and lifetime of the soliton are\naltered by friction, and the soliton can only undergo Brownian motion in the\npresence of friction and a confining potential. These results agree\nqualitatively with experimental observations by Aycock, et. al. (PNAS, 2017) in\na similar system with bosonic impurity scatterers.\n", "  The formation of precipitated zirconium (Zr) hydrides is closely related to\nthe hydrogen embrittlement problem for the cladding materials of pressured\nwater reactors (PWR). In this work, we systematically investigated the crystal\nstructures of zirconium hydride (ZrHx) with different hydrogen concentrations\n(x = 0~2, atomic ratio) by combining the basin hopping algorithm with first\nprinciples calculations. We conclude that the P3m1 {\\zeta}-ZrH0.5 is\ndynamically unstable, while a novel dynamically stable P3m1 ZrH0.5 structure\nwas discovered in the structure search. The stability of bistable P42/nnm\nZrH1.5 structures and I4/mmm ZrH2 structures are also revisited. We find that\nthe P42/nnm (c/a > 1) ZrH1.5 is dynamically unstable, while the I4/mmm (c/a =\n1.57) ZrH2 is dynamically stable.The P42/nnm (c/a < 1) ZrH1.5 might be a key\nintermediate phase for the transition of {\\gamma}->{\\delta}->{\\epsilon} phases.\nAdditionally, by using the thermal dynamic simulations, we find that\n{\\delta}-ZrH1.5 is the most stable structure at high temperature while ZrH2 is\nthe most stable hydride at low temperature. Slow cooling process will promote\nthe formation of {\\delta}-ZrH1.5, and fast cooling process will promote the\nformation of {\\gamma}-ZrH. These results may help to understand the phase\ntransitions of zirconium hydrides.\n", "  Quantum teleportation provides a `bodiless' way of transmitting the quantum\nstate from one object to another, at a distant location, using a classical\ncommunication channel and a previously shared entangled state. In this paper,\nwe present a tripartite scheme for probabilistic teleportation of an arbitrary\nsingle qubit state, without losing the information of the state being\nteleported, via a four-qubit cluster state of the form\n$\\left.|{\\phi}\\right\\rangle_{1234}=\\left.\\alpha|0000\\right\\rangle+\\left.\\beta|1010\\right\\rangle+\\left.\\gamma|0101\\right\\rangle-\\eta\\left.|1111\\right\\rangle$,\nas the quantum channel, where the nonzero real numbers $\\alpha$, $\\beta$,\n$\\gamma$, and $\\eta$ satisfy the relation\n$|\\alpha|^2+|\\beta|^2+|\\gamma|^2+|\\eta|^2=1$. With the introduction of an\nauxiliary qubit with state $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$, using a suitable unitary\ntransformation and a positive-operator valued measure (POVM), the receiver can\nrecreate the state of the original qubit. An important advantage of the\nteleportation scheme demonstrated here is that, if the teleportation fails, it\ncan be repeated without teleporting copies of the unknown quantum state, if the\nconcerned parties share another pair of entangled qubit. We also present a\nprotocol for quantum information splitting of an arbitrary two-particle system\nvia the aforementioned cluster state and a Bell-state as the quantum channel.\nProblems related to security attacks were examined for both the cases and it\nwas found that this protocol is secure. This protocol is highly efficient and\neasy to implement.\n", "  We report $T=0$ diffusion Monte Carlo results for the ground-state and vortex\nexcitation of unpolarized spin-1/2 fermions in a two-dimensional disk. We\ninvestigate how vortex core structure properties behave over the BEC-BCS\ncrossover. We calculate the vortex excitation energy, density profiles, and\nvortex core properties related to the current. We find a density suppression at\nthe vortex core on the BCS side of the crossover, and a depleted core on the\nBEC limit. Size-effect dependencies in the disk geometry were carefully\nstudied.\n", "  ALICE (Adaptive Learning for Interdisciplinary Collaborative Environments) is\nan open-source web based adaptive learning system designed for\ninterdisciplinary instruction. ALICE has the potential to transform education\nby empowering transdisciplinary knowledge acquisition. This is particularly\nimportant in fields that accept newcomers with diverse scholastic backgrounds,\ne.g. Systems Biology. With traditional interdisciplinary instruction, the\ninstructor must cover pre-requisite information from multiple disciplines to\nensure all students begin at a common baseline - slowing the learning process.\nWith ALICE, students follow a personalized syllabus based on their previous\nknowledge and work towards individual goals. Implementing an adaptive learning\nsystem in an interdisciplinary course requires careful considerations of the\ninstructional design. Structuring material, formulating assessments, and other\ninstructional design aspects must be carefully considered. These considerations\nare detailed through the exploration of a case study implementing ALICE in a\ngraduate level Systems Biology course.\n", "  We study far-from-equilibrium field theory dynamics using gauge/gravity\nduality applied to the Robinson-Trautman (RT) class of spacetimes and we\npresent a number of new results. First, we assess the applicability of the\nhydrodynamic approximation to inhomogeneous plasma dynamics dual to RT\nspacetimes. We prove that to any order in a late time expansion it is possible\nto identify variables corresponding to the local energy density and fluid\nvelocity. However, we show using numerical examples that this does not hold at\nthe non-perturbative level; for sufficiently inhomogeneous initial data a local\nrest frame does not exist. Second, we preset a new class of holographic\ninhomogeneous plasma flows on the plane. The corresponding spacetimes are not\nof the RT type but they can be obtained from RT spacetimes with spatially\ncompact boundaries by coordinate transformations which generate Poincar\\'e\npatch-like coordinates with planar boundaries. We demonstrate the application\nof this procedure using numerical examples.\n", "  In $\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$ parity is a good quantum number and thus the exciton\nspectrum falls into two parts: The dipole-active exciton states of negative\nparity and odd angular momentum, which can be observed in one-photon absorption\n($\\Gamma_4^-$ symmetry) and the exciton states of positive parity and even\nangular momentum, which can be observed in two-photon absorption ($\\Gamma_5^+$\nsymmetry). The unexpected observation of $D$ excitons in two-photon absorption\nand of $F$ excitons in one-photon absorption has given evidence that the\ndispersion properties of the $\\Gamma_5^+$ orbital valence band is giving rise\nto a coupling of the yellow and green exciton series. In this paper we show\nthat the even and odd parity exciton system can be consistently described\nwithin the same theoretical approach. However, the Hamiltonian of the even\nparity system needs, in comparison to the odd exciton case, modifications to\naccount for the very small radius of the $1S$ exciton. In the presented\ntreatment we take special care of the central-cell corrections, which comprise\na reduced screening of the Coulomb potential at distances comparable to the\npolaron radius, the exchange interaction being responsible for the exciton\nsplitting into ortho and para states, and the inclusion of terms in the fourth\npower of $p$ in the kinetic energy. Since the yellow $1S$ exciton state is\ncoupled to all other states of positive parity, we show how the central-cell\ncorrections affect the whole even exciton series. The close resonance of the\n$1S$ green exciton with states of the yellow exciton series has a strong impact\non the energies and oscillator strengths of all implied states. The consistency\nbetween theory and experiment with respect to energies and oscillator strengths\nfor the even and odd exciton system in $\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$ is a convincing proof\nfor the validity of the applied theory.\n", "  Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles can be used in a variety of\nmedical applications like vascular or targeted imaging. Magnetic particle\nimaging (MPI) is a promising tomographic imaging technique that allows\nvisualizing the 3D nanoparticle distribution concentration in a non-invasive\nmanner. The two main strengths of MPI are high temporal resolution and high\nsensitivity. While the first has been proven in the assessment of dynamic\nprocesses like cardiac imaging, it is unknown how far the detection limit of\nMPI can be lowered. Within this work, we will present a highly sensitive\ngradiometric receive-coil unit combined with a noise-matching network tailored\nfor the measurement of mice. The setup is capable of detecting 5 ng of iron in\nvitro at 2.14 sec acquisition time. In terms of iron concentration we are able\nto detect 156 {\\mu}g/L marking the lowest value that has been reported for an\nMPI scanner so far. In vivo MPI mouse images of a 512 ng bolus at 21.5 ms\nacquisition time allow for capturing the flow of an intravenously injected\ntracer through the heart of a mouse. Since it has been rather difficult to\ncompare detection limits across MPI publications we propose guidelines\nimproving the comparability of future MPI studies.\n", "  Assuming only statistical mechanics and general relativity, we calculate the\nmaximal temperature of gas of particles placed in AdS space-time. If two\nparticles with a given center of mass energy come close enough, according to\nclassical gravity they will form a black hole. We focus only on the black holes\nwith Hawking temperature lower than the environment, because they do not\ndisappear. The number density of such black holes grows with the temperature in\nthe system. At a certain finite temperature, the thermodynamical system will be\ndominated by black holes. This critical temperature is lower than the Planck\ntemperature for the values of the AdS vacuum energy density below the Planck\ndensity. This result might be interesting from the AdS/CFT correspondence point\nof view, since it is different from the Hawking-Page phase transition, and it\nis not immediately clear what effect dynamically limits the maximal temperature\nof the thermal state on the CFT side of the correspondence.\n", "  Our Keck/NIRC2 imaging survey searches for stellar companions around 144\nsystems with radial velocity (RV) detected giant planets to determine whether\nstellar binaries influence the planets' orbital parameters. This survey, the\nlargest of its kind to date, finds eight confirmed binary systems and three\nconfirmed triple systems. These include three new multi-stellar systems (HD\n30856, HD 86081, and HD 207832) and three multi-stellar systems with newly\nconfirmed common proper motion (HD 43691, HD 116029, and HD 164509). We combine\nthese systems with seven RV planet-hosting multi-stellar systems from the\nliterature in order to test for differences in the properties of planets with\nsemimajor axes ranging between 0.1-5 au in single vs multi-stellar systems. We\nfind no evidence that the presence or absence of stellar companions alters the\ndistribution of planet properties in these systems. Although the observed\nstellar companions might influence the orbits of more distant planetary\ncompanions in these systems, our RV observations currently provide only weak\nconstraints on the masses and orbital properties of planets beyond 5 au. In\norder to aid future efforts to characterize long period RV companions in these\nsystems, we publish our contrast curves for all 144 targets. Using four years\nof astrometry for six hierarchical triple star systems hosting giant planets,\nwe fit the orbits of the stellar companions in order to characterize the\norbital architecture in these systems. We find that the orbital plane of the\nsecondary and tertiary companions are inconsistent with an edge-on orbit in\nfour out of six cases.\n", "  We derive a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in neutron star systems\nwithin the modified $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$-gravity class of models using a\nperturbative approach. In our approach $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$-gravity is\nconsidered to be a static spherically symmetric space-time. In this instance\nthe metric is built from a more fundamental tetrad vierbein which can be used\nto relate inertial and global coordinates. A linear function $f = T(r) +\n\\mathcal{T}(r) + \\chi h(T, \\mathcal{T}) + \\mathcal{O}(\\chi^{2})$ is taken as\nthe Lagrangian density for the gravitational action. Finally we impose the\npolytropic equation of state of neutron star upon the derived equations in\norder to derive the mass profile and mass-central density relations of the\nneutron star in $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$-gravity.\n", "  We investigated the efficiency of coherent upstream large-amplitude\nelectromagnetic wave emission via synchrotron maser instability at relativistic\nmagnetized shocks by using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We\nconsidered the purely perpendicular shock in an electron-positron plasma. The\ncoherent wave emission efficiency was measured as a function of the\nmagnetization parameter {\\sigma}, which is defined by the ratio of the Poynting\nflux to the kinetic energy flux. The wave amplitude was systematically smaller\nthan that observed in one-dimensional simulations. However, it continued to\npersist, even at a considerably low magnetization rate, where the Weibel\ninstability dominated the shock transition. The emitted electromagnetic waves\nwere sufficiently strong to disturb the upstream medium, and transverse\nfilamentary density structures of substantial amplitude were produced. Based on\nthis result, we discuss the possibility of the wakefield acceleration model for\nthe production of non-thermal electrons in a relativistic magnetized\nion-electron shock.\n", "  We proposed a novel and simple multilayer structure to realize the\ndeterministic switching of perpendicularly magnetized layers (Co in our work)\nby spin orbital torque from the spin Hall Effect in this paper. A pinned layer\nis introduced, antiferromagnetically coupled to the magnetic Co layer. We have\nconfirmed the deterministic switching of perpendicularly magnetized layers from\nperspectives of switching loops, trajectories and switching properties under\nperiodic spin currents through micromagnetic simulation. The antiferromagnetic\ninteraction accounts for the deterministic switching exhibited in the structure\nand the reversal ultimate state of the magnetic layer is predictable when the\napplied spin current density is above 60MA/cm2. In our design, the\nantiferromagnetic coupling is easily tunable and no external magnetic field is\nneeded.\n", "  In this short viewpoint, we discuss the assignment of ionic charges in\nsolids. We argue that formal oxidation states serve a useful function, and that\nabsolute values of partial charges should be interpreted and applied with\ncaution; the charge assigned can never be definitive and depends on the type of\nproperty studied and the type of analysis performed. Careful analysis can be\nused to avoid unphysical conclusions such as a recent report on the Ti(III)\nnature of Ti in stoichiometric TiO$_2$.\n", "  The present paper is based upon ideas and results obtained in an earlier\npaper by the author devoted to a new formulation of quantum electrodynamics.\nThe equations derived in that paper depict the structure and properties of the\nelectron as well as of other leptons including neutrinos. Since in nature there\nare only two stable charged elementary particles, the electron and proton (with\ntheir antiparticles), it is logical to suppose that in nature there is a\nprotonic field too whose description is analogous with the one of the\nelectronic field. The equations obtained in the paper and describing the proton\nand other baryons differ in some detail from the ones for the electronic field.\nA section of the paper is devoted to nuclei where the electronic and protonic\nfields are present simultaneously without neutrons. The neutron itself consists\nof an electron and a proton. Mesons are short-lived combinations of the\nelectronic and protonic fields. The theory contains three dimensionless\nconstants whose value can be calculated.\n", "  Dynamic Networks are a popular way of modeling and studying the behavior of\nevolving systems. However, their analysis constitutes a relatively recent\nsubfield of Network Science, and the number of available tools is consequently\nmuch smaller than for static networks. In this work, we propose a method\nspecifically designed to take advantage of the longitudinal nature of dynamic\nnetworks. It characterizes each individual node by studying the evolution of\nits direct neighborhood, based on the assumption that the way this neighborhood\nchanges reflects the role and position of the node in the whole network. For\nthis purpose, we define the concept of \\textit{neighborhood event}, which\ncorresponds to the various transformations such groups of nodes can undergo,\nand describe an algorithm for detecting such events. We demonstrate the\ninterest of our method on three real-world networks: DBLP, LastFM and Enron. We\napply frequent pattern mining to extract meaningful information from temporal\nsequences of neighborhood events. This results in the identification of\nbehavioral trends emerging in the whole network, as well as the individual\ncharacterization of specific nodes. We also perform a cluster analysis, which\nreveals that, in all three networks, one can distinguish two types of nodes\nexhibiting different behaviors: a very small group of active nodes, whose\nneighborhood undergo diverse and frequent events, and a very large group of\nstable nodes.\n", "  Boron subphthalocyanine chloride is an electron donor material used in small\nmolecule organic photovoltaics with an unusually large molecular dipole moment.\nUsing first-principles calculations, we investigate enhancing the electronic\nand optical properties of boron subphthalocyanine chloride, by substituting the\nboron and chlorine atoms with other trivalent and halogen atoms in order to\nmodify the molecular dipole moment. Gas phase molecular structures and\nproperties are predicted with hybrid functionals. Using positions and\norientations of the known compounds as the starting coordinates for these\nmolecules, stable crystalline structures are derived following a procedure that\ninvolves perturbation and accurate total energy minimization. Electronic\nstructure and photonic properties of the predicted crystals are computed using\nthe GW method and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, respectively. Finally, a simple\ntransport model is use to demonstrate the importance of molecular dipole\nmoments on device performance.\n", "  Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) of Types Ib and Ic arise from\nhydrogen-stripped stars, while the latter are also stripped of their helium.\nBoth SN types have a similar temporal evolution, suggesting broadly similar\nprogenitors. However, while some Ic SNe are associated with relativistic jets\nof gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), no GRB has yet been found in association with Type\nIb SNe. Here we find that, even if GRB-like central engines operate in both SNe\nIb and Ic, different properties of their envelopes may accommodate this\npotential tension. In particular, we focus on the case of a low-mass, extended\nenvelope surrounding the progenitor star (as produced, for example, by strong\nmass losses prior to explosion). If the envelopes of Type Ib SNe are\nsufficiently massive ($M_{\\rm ext}\\sim(0.3-1)M_\\odot$) and extended ($R_{\\rm\next}\\sim 10^{13}\\text{ cm}$), we show that (i) GRB-like jets cannot break out\nof the star; (ii) the SN light curve is compatible with current observations.\nDifferent envelope properties of Type Ib SNe with respect to (at least some)\nType Ic SNe may be connected to the presence of a helium layer surrounding the\nstar.\n", "  A model of nonlinear electrodynamics with a dimensional parameter $\\beta$ is\nconsidered. Electromagnetic fields are the source of the gravitation field and\ninflation of the universe. We imply that the universe is filled by stochastic\nmagnetic fields. It is demonstrated that after the universe inflation the\nuniverse decelerates approaching the Minkowski spacetime. We evaluate the\nspectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the running of the spectral\nindex which approximately agree with the PLANK and WMAP data.\n", "  We report on the detection of the intrinsic spin Hall effect in a modulation\ndoped Al-GaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure bounded by a self-aligned\npn-junction, fabricated by the cleaved edge overgrowth method. Light emission\ndue to the recombination of electrons and spin-polarized holes was generated\nand mapped with a spatial resolution of one micrometer. An edge accumulated\nspin polarization of up to 11% was measured, induced solely by application of\nan electric Field perpendicular to the pn-junction. Using a quantum dot\nstructure as light source, a linear dependence of the effective spin\npolarization, and with that the dominance of the spin Hall effect, with the\nelectric field is seen. Spatially resolved spectroscopy from an epitaxially\nfabricated LED is demonstrated to be a valuable tool to probe the edge states\nof electron and hole gases in reduced dimensions.\n", "  Introduction: Intra-organ radiation dose sensitivity is becoming increasingly\nrelevant in clinical radiotherapy. One method for assessment involves\npartitioning delineated regions of interest and comparing the relative\ncontributions or importance to clinical outcomes. We show that an intuitive\nmethod for dividing organ contours, compound (sub-)segmentation, can\nunintentionally lead to sub-segments with inconsistent volumes, which will bias\nrelative importance assessment. An improved technique, nested segmentation, is\nintroduced and compared. Methods: Clinical radiotherapy planning parotid\ncontours from 510 patients were segmented. Counts of radiotherapy dose matrix\nvoxels interior to sub-segments were used to determine the equivalency of\nsub-segment volumes. The distribution of voxel counts within sub-segments were\ncompared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and characterized by their dispersion.\nAnalytical solutions for 2D/3D analogues were derived and sub-segment\narea/volume were compared directly. Results: Both parotid and 2D/3D region of\ninterest analogue segmentation confirmed compound segmentation intrinsically\nproduces sub-segments with volumes that depend on the region of interest shape\nand selection location. Significant volume differences were observed when\nsub-segmenting parotid contours into 18ths, and vanishingly small sub-segments\nwere observed when sub-segmenting into 96ths. Central sub-segments were\nconsiderably smaller than sub-segments on the periphery. Nested segmentation\ndid not exhibit these shortcomings and produced sub-segments with equivalent\nvolumes when dose grid and contour collinearity was addressed, even when\ndividing the parotid into 96ths. Nested segmentation was always faster or\nequivalent in runtime to compound segmentation. Conclusions: Nested\nsegmentation is more suited than compound segmentation for analyses requiring\nequal weighting of sub-segments.\n", "  Discrete symmetries play a crucial role in particle physics. They appear\nabundantly in string model constructions. We focus here on the case of discrete\n$R$-symmetries which are intrinsically connected to the Lorentz group in extra\ndimensions and the appearance of $N$-extended supersymmetry. In that sense,\ndiscrete $R$-symmetries can be understood as \"fractionally\" extended\nsupersymmetry. These symmetries reveal insight about the location of fields in\nextra dimensions (in particular the Higgs boson). Applications can be found in\nthe solution of the $\\mu$-problem, suppression of proton decay and the\nstructure of the soft terms of broken supersymmetry.\n", "  In this paper we propose to extend the definition of fuzzy transform in order\nto consider an interpolation of models that are richer than the standard fuzzy\ntransform. We focus on polynomial models, linear in particular, although the\napproach can be easily applied to other classes of models. As an example of\napplication, we consider the smoothing of time series in finance. A comparison\nwith moving averages is performed using NIFTY 50 stock market index.\nExperimental results show that a regression driven fuzzy transform (RDFT)\nprovides a smoothing approximation of time series, similar to moving average,\nbut with a smaller delay. This is an important feature for finance and other\napplication, where time plays a key role.\n", "  The purpose of the D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer is to find a set of\nqubit values that minimize its objective function. For various reasons, the set\nof qubit values returned by the D-Wave has errors. This paper presents a method\nof improving the results returned by the D-Wave. The method individually\nmodifies the qubit values returned by the D-Wave to find a set of values which\nis a minimum of the objective function. That set however is not necessarily\nguaranteed to be a global minimum. The method is simple and easily incorporated\ninto any algorithm that has direct access to the sets of values returned by the\nD-Wave. Examples are also presented that demonstrate the merit of using such a\nsample improvement method.\n", "  Weak value amplification is a classical phenomenon that can enhance the\nsensitivity of a measurement through clever use of interference. The most\nwell-known paradigm of weak value amplification makes use of a Gaussian pulse,\nwhich is typical of pulsed laser systems. In this Letter we show that chirped\npulses have a great advantage over Gaussians at detecting frequency shifts\nthanks to the large phase space area that they cover. As an example, we show\nthat within the typical operative parameters of a radar, we can achieve two\norders of magnitude amplification of small frequency shifts \\emph{on top of the\nweak value amplification}. This idea could lead to new metrological avenues in\nthe microwave optics domain, and to Doppler radar technology with unprecedented\nsensitivity.\n", "  We demonstrate a Markov duality between the dynamic ASEP and the standard\nASEP. We then apply this to step initial data, as well as a half-stationary\ninitial data (which we introduce). While investigating the duality for\nhalf-stationary initial data, we uncover and utilize connections to continuous\n$q^{-1}$-Hermite polynomials. Finally, we introduce a family of stationary\ninitial data which are related to the indeterminate moment problem associated\nwith these $q^{-1}$-Hermite polynomials.\n", "  A non-intrusive method to measure particle interaction using only the thermal\nmotion of the particles is applied to a vertically aligned dust particle pair\nin a complex plasma. The scanning mode spectra (SMS) are obtained by tracking\nthe thermal motion of the grains, with the interaction strength then determined\nfrom the frequencies and the eigenvector configuration of the normal modes. The\ninteraction of the bottom particle acting on the top particle is shown to be\nYukawa-like with the screening length suppressed against the ion flow. The\ninteraction of the top particle acting on the bottom particle is repulsive in\nthe vertical direction and attractive in the horizontal direction. The vertical\ninteraction from the top to bottom particle is stronger than that from the\nbottom to top particle, agreeing with an extended ion wake tail as predicted by\nthe inhomogeneous ion wake theory. Determination of the horizontal attraction\nstrength serves as a direct verification and quantification of the ion wake\neffect. Heating of the lower particle in both the vertical and horizontal\ndirections is observed and quantitatively related to the nonreciprocity of the\ninteraction. The in situ confinement strength at the position of the bottom\nparticle is found to be consistently lower than at the position of the top\nparticle, caused by decharging of the lower particle by 10-30% while inside the\nion wake of the top particle.\n", "  Crystal channeling technology has offered various opportunities in the\naccelerator community with a viability of ultrahigh gradient (TV/m)\nacceleration for future HEP collider. The major challenge of channeling\nacceleration is that ultimate acceleration gradients might require a high power\ndriver in the hard x-ray regime (~ 40 keV). This x-ray energy exceeds those for\nx-rays as of today, although x-ray lasers can efficiently excite solid plasma\nand accelerate particles inside a crystal channel. Moreover, only disposable\ncrystal accelerators are possible at such high externally excited fields which\nwould exceed the ionization thresholds destroying the atomic structure, so\nacceleration will take place only in a short time before full dissociation of\nthe lattice. Carbon-based nanostructures have great potential with a wide range\nof flexibility and superior physical strength, which can be applied to\nchanneling acceleration. This paper presents a beam-driven channeling\nacceleration concept with CNTs and discusses feasible experiments with the\nAdvanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA) in Fermilab.\n", "  The standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models were originally\ndeveloped based on results from semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy\nformation models. Those models have since progressed, in particular to include\nAGN feedback to match the galaxy luminosity function in a universe with the\nobserved baryon fraction. AGN feedback affects the relationship between galaxy\nstellar mass and luminosity, in particular making the relationship\nnon-monotonic. For matched number density samples, galaxies in\nluminosity-threshold samples occupy a different range of halo masses from those\nin stellar-mass-threshold samples. We find that the shapes of the HODs of\nluminosity-threshold samples are slightly more complicated in semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation models that include AGN feedback than are assumed by standard\nHOD models. We also find that subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) does not\npreserve these non-standard shapes. We show that catalogues created using SHAM\nand the semi-analytic model Galform that have the same large-scale 2-point\nclustering by construction have different void probability functions (VPFs) in\nboth real and redshift space. We find that these differences arise from the\ndifferent HOD shapes, as opposed to assembly bias, which indicates that the VPF\ncould be used to test the suitability of an HOD model with real data.\n", "  The sensing of magnetic fields has important applications in medicine,\nparticularly to the sensing of signals in the heart and brain. The fields\nassociated with biomagnetism are exceptionally weak, being many orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the Earth's magnetic field. To measure them requires\nthat we use the most sensitive detection techniques, however, to be\ncommercially viable this must be done at an affordable cost. The current state\nof the art uses costly SQUID magnetometers, although they will likely be\nsuperseded by less costly, but otherwise limited, alkali vapour magnetometers.\nHere, we discuss the application of diamond magnetometers to medical\napplications. Diamond magnetometers are robust, solid state devices that work\nin a broad range of environments, with the potential for sensitivity comparable\nto the leading technologies.\n", "  First-order perturbative calculation of the frequency-shifts caused by\nspecial relativity is performed for a charged particle confined in a Penning\ntrap. The perturbed motion is approximated by the Jacobian elliptic functions\nwhich describe the periodic orbit repeating itself sinuously with a period that\nexceeds $2\\pi$. We find relativistic corrections to amplitudes of oscillating\nmodes as well as shifts of eigenfrequencies which depend on amplitudes. Besides\nwe find the relativistic contributions to modular angles. In the low-energy\nlimit the deformed orbit simplifies to the well-known combination of axial\noscillation and in-plane motion consisting of two circular modes. We compare\nthe results with the model of relativistic frequency-shifts developed by J.\nKetter {\\em et al.}\n", "  Numerous studies have been carried out to characterize the chemical\ncomposition of laboratory analogues of Titan aerosols (tholins), but their\nmolecular composition as well as their structure are still poorly known. If\npyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (pyr-GCMS) has been used for\nyears to give clues about this composition, the highly disparate results\nobtained can be attributed to the analytical conditions used and/or to\ndifferences in the nature of the analogues studied. In order to have a better\ndescription of Titan tholins molecular composition, we led a systematic\nanalysis of these materials using pyr-GCMS with two major objectives: (i)\nexploring the analytical parameters to estimate the biases this technique can\ninduce and to find an optimum for analyses allowing the detection of a wide\nrange of compounds and thus a characterization of the tholins composition as\ncomprehensive as possible, and (ii) highlighting the role of the CH4 ratio in\nthe gaseous reactive medium on the tholins molecular structure. With this aim,\nwe used a radio-frequency plasma discharge to synthetize tholins with different\nconcentrations of CH4 diluted in N2. The samples were systematically pyrolyzed\nfrom 200 to 600{\\deg}C. The extracted gases were then analyzed by GCMS for\ntheir molecular identification.\n", "  Since 1960's, particle colliders have been in the forefront of particle\nphysics, 29 total have been built and operated, 7 are in operation now. At\npresent the near term US, European and international strategies of the particle\nphysics community are centered on full exploitation of the physics potential of\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) through its high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC).\nThe future of the world-wide HEP community critically depends on the\nfeasibility of possible post-LHC colliders. The concept of the feasibility is\ncomplex and includes at least three factors: feasibility of energy, feasibility\nof luminosity and feasibility of cost. Here we overview all current options for\npost-LHC colliders from such perspective (ILC, CLIC, Muon Collider, plasma\ncolliders, CEPC, FCC, HE-LHC) and discuss major challenges and accelerator R&D\nrequired to demonstrate feasibility of an energy frontier accelerator facility\nfollowing the LHC. We conclude by taking a look into ultimate energy reach\naccelerators based on plasmas and crystals, and discussion on the perspectives\nfor the far future of the accelerator-based particle physics. This paper\nlargely follows previous study and the presentation given at the ICHEP'2016\nconference in Chicago.\n", "  The first aim of this work is to construct a Finite Elements model for\nquasi-geostrophic equation. This model is analyzed through FEniCS interface. As\na second purpose, it shows the potential of the control theory to treat Data\nAssimilation large scale problems. In section one the finite element\napproximation of the quasi-geostrophic model is described. In section two some\nnumerical results on different domains are shown. In section three a comparison\nbetween Navier Stokes model and quasi-geostrophic one is discussed. Last\nsection is dedicated to a more complex data assimilation/control problem based\non quasi-geostrophic equations, to test possible developments and improvements.\n", "  We show that the potential in the radial equation in the model of coherent\nquadrupole-octupole motion (CQOM) in nuclei generates a sequence of\nsuperpotentials and subsequent series of effective potentials which satisfy the\nshape-invariance condition and correspond to a SUSY-QM hierarchy of\nHamiltonians. On this basis we suggest that the original CQOM level scheme\npossesses a generic supersymmetric structure of the spectrum inherent for the\ncoherent quadrupole-octupole mode. We outline the mechanism in which the real\nquadrupole-octupole spectra in even-even and odd-even nuclei deviate from the\ngenuine symmetry. By using it we illustrate the possibilities to identify the\nsigns of supersymmetry in the alternating-parity spectra of even-even nuclei\nand the quasi-parity-doublet levels of odd-mass nuclei described within the\nCQOM model approach.\n", "  Numerical simulations are used in this work to investigate aspects of\nmicrostructure and microsegregation during rapid solidification of a Ni-based\nsuperalloy in a laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process. Thermal\nmodeling by finite element analysis simulates the laser melt pool, with surface\ntemperatures in agreement with in situ thermographic measurements on Inconel\n625. Geometric and thermal features of the simulated melt pools are extracted\nand used in subsequent mesoscale simulations. Solidification in the melt pool\nis simulated on two length scales. For the multicomponent alloy Inconel 625,\nmicrosegregation between dendrite arms is calculated using the Scheil-Gulliver\nsolidification model and DICTRA software. Phase-field simulations, using Ni-Nb\nas a binary analogue to Inconel 625, produced microstructures with primary\ncellular/dendritic arm spacings in agreement with measured spacings in\nexperimentally observed microstructures and a lesser extent of microsegregation\nthan predicted by DICTRA simulations. The composition profiles are used to\ncompare thermodynamic driving forces for nucleation against experimentally\nobserved precipitates identified by electron and X-ray diffraction analyses.\nOur analysis lists the precipitates that may form from FCC phase of enriched\ninterdendritic compositions and compares these against experimentally observed\nphases from 1 h heat treatments at two temperatures: stress relief at 1143 K\n(870{\\deg}C) or homogenization at 1423 K (1150{\\deg}C).\n", "  Comprehensive studies with the MARS15(2016) Monte-Carlo code are described on\nevaluation of prompt and residual radiation levels induced by nominal and\naccidental beam losses in the 5-MW, 2-GeV European Spallation Source (ESS)\nLinac. These are to provide a basis for radiation shielding design verification\nthrough the accelerator complex. The calculation model is based on the latest\nengineering design and includes a sophisticated algorithm for particle tracking\nin the machine RF cavities as well as a well-established model of the beam\nloss. Substantial efforts were put in solving the deep-penetration problem for\nthe thick shielding around the tunnel with numerous complex penetrations. It\nallowed us to study in detail not only the prompt dose, but also component and\nair activation, radiation loads on the soil outside the tunnel, and skyshine\nstudies for the complicated 3-D surface above the machine. Among the other\nthings, the newest features in MARS15 (2016), such as a ROOT-based beamline\nbuilder and a TENDL-based event generator for nuclear interactions below 100\nMeV, were very useful in this challenging application.\n", "  Recent work on improving and revising estimates of solar activity [Clette et\nal., 2014] has resulted in renewed interest in what has been called the longest\nrunning 'Science Experiment'. We compare four reconstructions of solar activity\nas reflected in the number of sunspot groups ('active regions') constructed by\ndifferent authors using very different methods. We concentrate on the period\nsince AD 1900 where the underlying solar and geomagnetic data are plentiful and\nof sufficient quality and find that all four methods yield essentially the same\nSunspot Group Number series. We take that as indicating that protracted and\npernicious criticisms of the individual methods are neither fruitful nor\nhelpful and we suggest that future efforts be directed towards understanding\nthe specific reasons why the methods give discordant results for centuries\nprior to the 20th. The main area of disagreement occurs during the last 25\nyears of the 19th century and feeds back into the time prior to that. The solar\nExtreme Ultraviolet flux can be reconstructed since the 1740s [Svalgaard, 2016]\nand with suitable scaling fits the Svalgaard & Schatten [2016] Sunspot Group\nNumber series since 1865 very well, so we argue that the discordant group\nseries have problems once we move out of the 20th century, and that the\ncommunity should concentrate on finding out what those are, so a true and\nuseful consensus can emerge.\n", "  Transport of fluid through a pipe is essential for the operation of\nmacroscale machines and microfluidic devices. Conventional fluids only flow in\nresponse to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic fluid,\ncomprised of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through\nmeter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude,\nvelocity profile and direction of the self-organized flows, and correlate these\nto the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently\nthree-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows\noccurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near\nthe surface, and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the\nchannel profile. The non-equilibrium transition of confined isotropic active\nfluids can be used to engineer self-organized soft machines.\n", "  In this short paper we follow the entropic gravity approach and demonstrate\nhow \\(f(R)\\) theories of gravity can be emergent. This is done by introducing\nan effective gravitational constant which is naturally arising from the\n\\(f(R)\\)'s equations of motion.\n", "  Exciton and polaron pair dissociation is a key functional aspect of\nphotovoltaic devices. To improve upon the current state of interfacial\ntransport models, we augment the existing classical models of dielectric\ninterfaces by incorporating results from ab initio calculations, allowing us to\ncalculate exciton and polaron binding energies more accurately. We demonstrate\nthe predictive capabilities of this new model using two interfaces: (i) the\nboron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) and C60 interface, which is an\narchetype for many organic photovoltaic devices; and (ii) pentacene and silicon\n(100), which represents a hybrid between organic and inorganic semiconductors.\nOur calculations predict that the insertion of molecular dipoles at interfaces\ncan be used for improving polaron pair dissociation and that sharp transitions\nin dielectric permittivity can have a stronger effect on the polaron pair\ndissociation than even the electron-hole Coulomb interaction.\n", "  We present results from a multiwavelength study of the blazar PKS 1954-388 at\nradio, UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray energies. A RadioAstron observation at 1.66 GHz\nin June 2012 resulted in the detection of interferometric fringes on baselines\nof 6.2 Earth-diameters. This suggests a source frame brightness temperature of\ngreater than 2x10^12 K, well in excess of both equipartition and inverse\nCompton limits and implying the existence of Doppler boosting in the core. An\n8.4 GHz TANAMI VLBI image, made less than a month after the RadioAstron\nobservations, is consistent with a previously reported superluminal motion for\na jet component. Flux density monitoring with the Australia Telescope Compact\nArray confirms previous evidence for long-term variability that increases with\nobserving frequency. A search for more rapid variability revealed no evidence\nfor significant day-scale flux density variation. The ATCA light-curve reveals\na strong radio flare beginning in late 2013 which peaks higher, and earlier, at\nhigher frequencies. Comparison with the Fermi gamma-ray light-curve indicates\nthis followed ~9 months after the start of a prolonged gamma-ray high-state --\na radio lag comparable to that seen in other blazars. The multiwavelength data\nare combined to derive a Spectral Energy Distribution, which is fitted by a\none-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model with the addition of external\nCompton (EC) emission.\n", "  Novel physical phenomena emerge in ultra-small sized nanomaterials. We study\nthe limiting small-size-dependent properties of MoS$_{2}$ monolayer rhombic\nnanoflakes using density-functional theory on structures of size up to\nMo$_{35}$S$_{70}$ (1.74~nm). We investigate the structural and electronic\nproperties as functions of the lateral size of the nanoflakes, finding zigzag\nis the most stable edge configuration, and that increasing size is accompanied\nby greater stability. We also investigate passivation of the structures to\nexplore realistic settings, finding increased HOMO-LUMO gaps and energetic\nstability. Understanding the size-dependent properties will inform efforts to\nengineer electronic structures at the nano-scale.\n", "  Single-exposure spectra in large spectral surveys are valuable for time\ndomain studies such as stellar variability, but there is no available method to\neliminate cosmic rays for single-exposure, multi-fiber spectral images. In this\npaper, we describe a new method to detect and remove cosmic rays in multi-fiber\nspectroscopic single exposures. Through the use of two-dimensional profile\nfitting and a noise model that considers the position-dependent errors, we\nsuccessfully detect as many as 80% of the cosmic rays and correct the cosmic\nray polluted pixels to an average accuracy of 97.8%. Multiple tests and\ncomparisons with both simulated data and real LAMOST data show that the method\nworks properly in detection rate, false detection rate, and validity of cosmic\nray correction.\n", "  Some models of asymmetric dark matter commonly employ a gauge group structure\nof the form $G_{V}\\times{}G_{D}$ where $G_{V}$ is the visible gauge group\ncontaining the Standard Model and $G_{D}$ is the gauge group responsible for\nself-interactions amongst components of dark matter. In some models, there is\nalso an additional spontaneously broken $U(1)$ gauge symmetry coupling the\nvisible and dark sectors at high energies. One theoretical problem is how to\nunify the visible and dark sectors by inducing the spontaneous breaking\n$G\\rightarrow{}G_{V}\\times{}G_{D}$ for some large gauge group $G$. In this\npaper, we discuss how to generate such a structure at low energies, in the\ncontext of 4+1-dimensional domain-wall brane model, by employing a\ngeneralization of the Dvali-Shifman mechanism, used to localized gauge bosons\non domain walls, called the clash-of-symmetries mechanism. In one model, we\ndescribe a clash-of-symmetries domain wall solution in a theory with two scalar\nfields in the adjoint representation which breaks the group $SU(12)$ to two\ndifferently embedded copies of $SU(6)\\times{}SU(6)\\times{}U(1)$, leading to a\nan effective $SU(5)_{V}\\times{}SU(5)_{D}\\times{}U(1)_{X}$-invariant field\ntheory on the wall. We find that fermions in the mixed representations of\n$SU(5)_{V}\\times{}SU(5)_{D}$ do not couple to the domain wall and thus remain\n5D vector-like Dirac fermions, attaining masses of order $M_{GUT}$ when we\nperform the breaking\n$SU(5)_{V}\\rightarrow{}SU(3)_{c}\\times{}SU(2)_{I}\\times{}U(1)_{Y}$, thus being\nremoved from the spectrum. We also outline how to build a few alternative\nmodels, one based on the group $SU(9)$, and a couple more based on\nnon-clash-of-symmetries domain wall solutions in $SU(12)$ and $SU(10)$ models.\n", "  We have earlier reported the MOLSDOCK technique to perform rigid\nreceptor/flexible ligand docking. The method uses the MOLS method, developed in\nour laboratory. In this paper we report iMOLSDOCK, the 'flexible receptor'\nextension we have carried out to the algorithm MOLSDOCK. iMOLSDOCK uses\nmutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) to sample the conformation and the\ndocking pose of the ligand and also the flexible residues of the receptor\nprotein. The method then uses a variant of the mean field technique to analyze\nthe sample to arrive at the optimum. We have benchmarked and validated\niMOLSDOCK with a dataset of 44 peptide-protein complexes with peptides. We have\nalso compared iMOLSDOCK with other flexible receptor docking tools GOLD v5.2.1\nand AutoDock Vina. The results obtained show that the method works better than\nthese two algorithms, though it consumes more computer time.\n", "  The absorption of a single photon that excites a quantum system from a low to\na high energy level is an elementary process of light-matter interaction, and a\nroute towards realizing pure single-photon absorption has both fundamental and\npractical implications in quantum technology. Due to nonlinear optical effects,\nhowever, the probability of pure single-photon absorption is usually very low,\nwhich is particularly pertinent in the case of strong ultrafast laser pulses\nwith broad bandwidth. Here we demonstrate theoretically a counterintuitive\ncoherent single-photon absorption scheme by eliminating nonlinear interactions\nof ultrafast laser pulses with quantum systems. That is, a completely linear\nresponse of the system with respect to the spectral energy density of the\nincident light at the transition frequency can be obtained for all transition\nprobabilities between 0 and 100% in a multi-level quantum systems. To that end,\na new multi-objective optimization algorithm is developed to find an optimal\nspectral phase of an ultrafast laser pulse, which is capable of eliminating all\npossible nonlinear optical responses while maximizing the probability of\nsingle-photon absorption between quantum states. This work not only deepens our\nunderstanding of light-matter interactions, but also offers a new way to study\nphotophysical and photochemical processes in the \"absence\" of nonlinear optical\neffects.\n", "  Aims. In this paper, we investigate the temporal evolution and north-south\n(N-S) asymmetry in the occurrence of solar flares during cycle 21, 22, and 23,\nand compare the results with traditional solar activity indices. Methods. The\nflare activity is characterized by a soft X-ray (SXR) flare index, which\nincorporates information about flare occurrences during a selected interval\nalong with the peak intensity of individual events. Results. The SXR flare\nindex correlates well with other conventional parameters of solar activity.\nFurther, it exhibits a significantly higher correlation with sunspot area over\nsunspot number, which suggests the variations in sunspot area to be more\nclosely linked with the transient energy release in the solar corona. The\ncumulative plots of the flare index indicate a slight excess of activity in the\nnorthern hemisphere during cycle 21, while a southern excess clearly prevails\nfor cycles 22 and 23. The study reveals a significant N-S asymmetry, which\nexhibits variations with the phases of solar cycle. The reliability and\npersistency of this asymmetry significantly increases when the data is averaged\nover longer periods, while an optimal level is achieved when data is binned for\n13 Carrington rotations. The time evolution of the flare index further confirms\nevolution of dual peaks in solar cycles during the solar maxima and violation\nof Gnevyshev-Ohl rule for the pair of solar cycles 22 and 23. Conclusions. The\nSXR flare index in the northern and the southern hemispheres of the Sun\nexhibits significant asymmetry during the evolutionary phases of the solar\ncycle, which implies that N-S asymmetry of solar flares is manifested in terms\nof the flare counts as well as the intensity of flare events.\n", "  We consider pattern formation using reaction-diffusion equation on various\nnon-uniformly curved surfaces. We explore how, in general, curvature and, in\nparticular the domain shape would affect the pattern formation in these\ngeometries. As examples, we study stripe and spot patterns on a torus, and on\nan ellipsoid. Our results show that the curvature and domain shape can control\nthe orientation of stripe pattern as well as the size and number of spots. Our\nresults also indicate that by controlling the curvature and shape, one can\ndrive the chemicals to a preferred region. Specifically on a torus, curvature\nand shape can guide the chemicals more on to outer side than inner side. This\nresult may prove important in the studies of self-organization of molecules in\nbiological membranes.\n", "  The deuterium enrichment of organics in the interstellar medium,\nprotoplanetary disks and meteorites has been proposed to be the result of\nionizing radiation. The goal of this study is to quantify the effects of soft\nX-rays (0.1 - 2 keV), a component of stellar radiation fields illuminating\nprotoplanetary disks, on the refractory organics present in the disks. We\nprepared tholins, nitrogen-rich complex organics, via plasma deposition and\nused synchrotron radiation to simulate X-ray fluences in protoplanetary disks.\nControlled irradiation experiments at 0.5 and 1.3 keV were performed at the\nSEXTANTS beam line of the SOLEIL synchrotron, and were followed by ex-situ\ninfrared, Raman and isotopic diagnostics. Infrared spectroscopy revealed the\nloss of singly-bonded groups (N-H, C-H and R-N$\\equiv$C) and the formation of\nsp$^3$ carbon defects. Raman analysis revealed the introduction of defects and\nstructural amorphization. Finally, tholins were measured via secondary ion mass\nspectrometry (SIMS), revealing that significant D-enrichment is induced by\nX-ray irradiation. Our results are compared to previous experimental studies\ninvolving the thermal degradation and electron irradiation of organics. The\npenetration depth of soft X-rays in $\\mu$m-sized tholins leads to volume rather\nthan surface modifications: lower energy X-rays (0.5 keV) induce a larger\nD-enrichment than 1.3 keV X-rays, reaching a plateau for doses larger than 5\n$\\times$ 10$^{27}$ eV cm$^{-3}$. Our work provides experimental evidence of a\nnew non-thermal pathway to deuterium fractionation of organic matter.\n", "  We introduce a powerful iterative algorithm to compute protein folding\npathways, with realistic all-atom force fields. Using the path integral\nformalism, we explicitly derive a modified Langevin equation which samples\ndirectly the ensemble of reactive pathways, exponentially reducing the cost of\nsimulating thermally activated transitions. The algorithm also yields a\nrigorous stochastic estimate of the reaction coordinate. After illustrating\nthis approach on a simple toy model, we successfully validate it against the\nresults of ultra-long plain MD protein folding simulations for a fast folding\nprotein (Fip35), which were performed on the Anton supercomputer. Using our\nalgorithm, computing a folding trajectory for this protein requires only 1000\ncore hours, a computational load which could be even carried out on a desktop\nworkstation.\n", "  This paper presents a mathematical model and a numerical procedure to\nsimulate an acoustic well stimulation (AWS) method for enhancing the\npermeability of the rock formation surrounding oil and gas wells. The AWS\nmethod considered herein aims to exploit the well-known permeability-enhancing\neffect of mechanical vibrations in acoustically porous materials, by\ntransmitting time-harmonic sound waves from a sound source device---placed\ninside the well---to the well perforations made into the formation. The\nefficiency of the AWS is assessed by quantifying the amount of acoustic energy\ntransmitted from the source device to the rock formation in terms of the\nemission frequency and the well configuration. A simple methodology to find\noptimal emission frequencies for a given well configuration is presented. The\nproposed model is based on the Helmholtz equation and an impedance boundary\ncondition that effectively accounts for the porous solid-fluid interaction at\nthe interface between the rock formation and the well perforations. Exact\nnon-reflecting boundary conditions derived from Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps are\nutilized to truncate the circular cylindrical waveguides considered in the\nmodel. The resulting boundary value problem is then numerically solved by means\nof the finite element method. A variety of numerical examples are presented in\norder to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure for finding\noptimal emission frequencies.\n", "  Twin growth in hexagonal close-packed zirconium is investigated at the atomic\nscale by modeling the various disconnections that can exist on twin boundaries.\nThanks to a coupling with elasticity theory, core energies are extracted from\natomistic simulations and the formation energy of isolated disconnection\ndipoles is defined. For twin systems where several disconnections can exist,\nbecause of this core contribution, the most stable disconnection is not always\nthe one with the smallest Burgers vector. Crystallographic parameters of the\ndisconnection with the lowest formation energy correlate well with twin modes\nobserved experimentally. On the other hand, disconnection migration,\ncharacterized here by computing their migration energy and Peierls stress, does\nnot appear critical for twin mode selection.\n", "  As a fundamental challenge in vast disciplines, link prediction aims to\nidentify potential links in a network based on the incomplete observed\ninformation, which has broad applications ranging from uncovering missing\nprotein-protein interaction to predicting the evolution of networks. One of the\nmost influential methods rely on similarity indices characterized by the common\nneighbors or its variations. We construct a hidden space mapping a network into\nEuclidean space based solely on the connection structures of a network.\nCompared with real geographical locations of nodes, our reconstructed locations\nare in conformity with those real ones. The distances between nodes in our\nhidden space could serve as a novel similarity metric in link prediction. In\naddition, we hybrid our hidden space method with other state-of-the-art\nsimilarity methods which substantially outperforms the existing methods on the\nprediction accuracy. Hence, our hidden space reconstruction model provides a\nfresh perspective to understand the network structure, which in particular\ncasts a new light on link prediction.\n", "  We present the original computer code for the simulation of multi-element\ndetection system of the compact positron-emission tomograph based on a\nscintillator-photodiode type of detection elements. The use of such type of\ndetection elements allows obtaining a high spatial resolution at a relatively\nsmall total size of the tomograph. This program gives an opportunity to choose\nthe optimal geometry of detection system depending on the parameters of its\nelements, and analyze the efficiency of different image reconstruction\nalgorithms. The handy interface for the designed compact positron-emission\ntomograph operation has been created.\n", "  Recent general relativistic simulations have shown that the coalescence of\ntwo spinning black holes (BH) can lead to recoiling speeds of the BH remnant of\nup to thousands of km/s as a result of the gravitational radiation emission. It\nis important that the accretion disc remains bound to ejected BH within the\nregion where the gas orbital velocity is larger than the ejection speed. We\nconsidered the situation when the recoiling kick radius coincides with the\nradius of the broad line region (BLR). We show that in this situation the\nobserved polarization data of accretion disk emission allow to determine the\nvalue of the recoil velocity. We present the estimates of the kick velocity for\nAGN with determined polarization data.\n", "  We developed a highly hydrogen-sensitive thermal desorption spectroscopy\n(HHS-TDS) system to detect and quantitatively analyze low hydrogen\nconcentrations in thin films. The system was connected to an in situ\nsample-transfer chamber system, manipulators, and an rf magnetron sputtering\nthin-film deposition chamber under an ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) atmosphere of\n~10^-8 Pa. The following key requirements were proposed in developing the\nHHS-TDS: (i) a low hydrogen residual partial pressure, (ii) a low hydrogen\nexhaust velocity, and (iii) minimization of hydrogen thermal desorption except\nfrom the bulk region of the thin films. To satisfy these requirements,\nappropriate materials and components were selected, and the system was\nconstructed to extract the maximum performance from each component.\nConsequently, ~2000 times higher sensitivity to hydrogen than that of a\ncommercially available UHV-TDS system was achieved using H+-implanted Si\nsamples. Quantitative analysis of an amorphous oxide semiconductor InGaZnO4\nthin film (1 cm x 1 cm x 1um thickness, hydrogen concentration of 4.5 x 10^17\natoms/cm3) was demonstrated using the HHS-TDS system. This concentration level\ncannot be detected using UHV-TDS or secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS)\nsystems. The hydrogen detection limit of the HHS-TDS system was estimated to be\n~1 x 10^16 atoms/cm3, which implies ~2 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity\nthan that of SIMS and resonance nuclear reaction systems (~10^18 atoms/cm3).\n", "  It is commonly believed that the fidelity of quantum teleportation in the\ngravitational field would be degraded due to the heat up by the Hawking\nradiation. In this paper, we point out that the Hawking effect could be\neliminated by the combined action of pre- and post-weak measurements, and thus\nthe teleportation fidelity is almost completely protected. It is intriguing to\nnotice that the enhancement of fidelity could not be attributed to the\nimprovement of entanglement, but rather to the probabilistic nature of weak\nmeasurements. Our work extends the ability of weak measurements as a quantum\ntechnique to battle against gravitational decoherence in relativistic quantum\ninformation.\n", "  We formulate the Nambu-Goldstone theorem as a triangular relation between\npairs of Goldstone bosons with the degenerate vacuum. The vacuum degeneracy is\nthen a natural consequence of this relation. Inside the scenario of String\nTheory, we then find that there is a correspondence between the way how the\n$D$-branes interact and the properties of the Goldstone bosons.\n", "  Intermolecular electron transfer reaction often occurs over long range\ndistances (i.e. up to several tens of angstroms) and plays a key role in\nvarious physical, chemical and biological processes. In these reactions the\nrate constant of long range electron transfer depends upon electronic coupling\nbetween the donor and acceptor. The coupling between donor and acceptor may\nincreases by the atoms located between them which form a kind of bridge for\nelectron tunneling. By using exact analytical method we calculated the value of\nelectronic coupling for the above said processes in which the interaction of an\nelectron with the donor, acceptor are represented as Dirac delta functions and\nconjugated bridge is represented by finite square well.\n", "  Current effective medium theories for nano-shells are reviewed. A new method\nfor calculating the effective dielectric function of a core-shell nanoparticle\nis presented and compared with existing theories showing clear advantages in\nmost conditions. It consists of introducing radiating effects in the polariz-\nability of the effective sphere, and considering the exact polarizability of\nthe core-shell constructed from the Mie scattering coefficient. This new\napproach can be considered as an useful tool for designing coated particles\nwith desired plasmonic properties and engineering the effective permittivity of\ncomposites with core-shell type inclusions which are used in photocatalysis and\nsolar energy harvesting applications.\n", "  We demonstrate a microscopic magnonic-crystal waveguide produced by\nnano-patterning of a 20 nm thick film of Yttrium Iron Garnet. By using the\nphase-resolved micro-focus Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we map the\nintensity and the phase of spin waves propagating in such a periodic magnetic\nstructure. Based on these maps, we obtain the dispersion and the attenuation\ncharacteristics of spin waves providing detailed information about the physics\nof spin-wave propagation in the magnonic crystal. We show that, in contrast to\nthe simplified physical picture, the maximum attenuation of spin waves is\nachieved close to the edge of the magnonic band gap, which is associated with\nnon-trivial reflection characteristics of spin waves in non-uniform field\npotentials.\n", "  In this paper we investigate a super-directive antenna based on a parasitic\nstructure with a circumscribing sphere of diameter 69 mm corresponding to\n0.2$\\lambda$@880 MHz. The antenna is modeled, simulated, measured, and it is\nalso evaluated against the new Q-factor bound for small antennas at a given\ntotal directivity. A maximum directivity of 7.2 dBi is measured with a\nradiation efficiency of -6.5 dB at 876 MHz. An intermediate directivity of 6.2\ndBi is observed at 880 MHz with 20 dB front-to-back ratio and -7 dB radiation\nefficiency. The antenna performs well with respect to the developed fundamental\nbound. The results is promising for applications that require miniaturization\nand spatial filtering. The above antenna properties are robust and we show with\nmeasurements that the antenna preform well also when it is integrated as an\nautonomous unit.\n", "  In our previous paper, the concept of sub-symmetry of a differential system\nwas introduced, and its properties and some applications were studied. It was\nshown that sub-symmetries are important in decoupling a differential system,\nand in the deformation of a system's conservation laws, to a greater extent\nthan regular symmetries. In this paper, we study the nature of a correspondence\nbetween sub-symmetries and conservation laws of a differential system. We show\nthat for a large class of non-Lagrangian systems, there is a natural\nassociation between sub-symmetries and local conservation laws based on the\nNoether operator identity, and we prove an analogue of the first Noether\nTheorem for sub-symmetries. We also demonstrate that infinite conservation laws\ncontaining arbitrary functions of dependent variables can be generated by\ninfinite sub-symmetries through the Noether operator identity. We discuss the\napplication of sub-symmetries to the incompressible Euler equations of fluid\ndynamics. Despite the fact that infinite symmetries (with arbitrary functions\nof dependent variables) are not known for the Euler equations, we show that\nthese equations possess infinite sub-symmetries. We calculate infinite\nsub-symmetries with arbitrary functions of dependent variables for the two-and\nthree-dimensional Euler equations in the velocity and vorticity formulations\nwith certain constraints. We demonstrate that these sub-symmetries generate\nknown series of infinite conservation laws, and obtain new classes of infinite\nconservation laws\n", "  In 1974, Nelson, Kase and Svensson published an experimental investigation on\nmuon shielding around SLAC high-energy electron accelerators. They measured\nmuon fluence and absorbed dose induced by 14 and 18 GeV electron beams hitting\na copper/water beamdump and attenuated in a thick steel shielding. In their\npaper, they compared the results with the theoretical models available at that\ntime.\n  In order to compare their experimental results with present model\ncalculations, we use the modern transport Monte Carlo codes MARS15, FLUKA2011\nand GEANT4 to model the experimental setup and run simulations. The results are\nthen compared between the codes, and with the SLAC data.\n", "  Community structure describes the organization of a network into subgraphs\nthat contain a prevalence of edges within each subgraph and relatively few\nedges across boundaries between subgraphs. The development of\ncommunity-detection methods has occurred across disciplines, with numerous and\nvaried algorithms proposed to find communities. As we present in this Chapter\nvia several case studies, community detection is not just an \"end game\" unto\nitself, but rather a step in the analysis of network data which is then useful\nfor furthering research in the disciplinary domain of interest. These\ncase-study examples arise from diverse applications, ranging from social and\npolitical science to neuroscience and genetics, and we have chosen them to\ndemonstrate key aspects of community detection and to highlight that community\ndetection, in practice, should be directed by the application at hand.\n", "  In this paper the Chua circuit with five linear elements and saturation\nnon-linearity is studied. Numerical localization of self-excited attractor in\nthe Chua circuit model can be done by computation of trajectory with initial\ndata in a vicinity of an unstable equilibrium. For a hidden attractor its basin\nof attraction does not overlap with a small vicinity of equilibria, so it is\ndifficult to find the corresponding initial data for localization. This survey\nis devoted to the application of describing function method for localization of\nhidden periodic and chaotic attractors in the Chua model. We use a rigorous\njustification of the describing function method, based on the method of small\nparameter, to get the initial data for the visualization of the hidden\nattractors. A new configuration of hidden Chua attractors is presented.\n", "  We analyse the distribution of position angles of 1 million galaxies from the\nHyperleda catalogue, a sample that presents the galaxies coordinates in the\ncelestial sphere, information that allows us to look for a possible privileged\ndirection. Our analysis involves different tests and statistical methods, from\nwhich it is possible to infer with high probability ($p$-value extremely low)\nthat the galactic planes are not randomly oriented in the sky. Whether this is\nan evidence of a cosmological anisotropy or an observational bias due to local\neffects is something deserving further studies.\n"]}
