each finite crossed\nmodule by considering crossed module invariants of ribbon knotted surfaces\nwhich are naturally associated with them. We elucidate that the invariants\nobtained are non trivial by calculating explicit examples. We define welded\nvirtual graphs and consider invariants of them defined in a similar way.\n", "  We define the thin fundamental categorical group ${\\mathcal P}_2(M,*)$ of a\nbased smooth manifold $(M,*)$ as the categorical group whose objects are rank-1\nhomotopy classes of based loops on $M$, and whose morphisms are rank-2 homotopy\nclasses of homotopies between based loops on $M$. Here two maps are rank-$n$\nhomotopic, when the rank of the differential of the homotopy between them\nequals $n$. Let $\\C(\\Gc)$ be a Lie categorical group coming from a Lie crossed\nmodule ${\\Gc= (\\d\\colon E \\to G,\\tr)}$. We construct categorical holonomies,\ndefined to be smooth morphisms ${\\mathcal P}_2(M,*) \\to \\C(\\Gc)$, by using a\nnotion of categorical connections, being a pair $(\\w,m)$, where $\\w$ is a\nconnection 1-form on $P$, a principal $G$ bundle over $M$, and $m$ is a 2-form\non $P$ with values in the Lie algebra of $E$, with the pair $(\\w,m)$ satisfying\nsuitable conditions.\n  As a further result, we are able to define Wilson spheres in this context.\n", "  We prove that if $M$ is a CW-complex and $M^1$ is its 1-skeleton then the\ncrossed module $\\Pi_2(M,M^1)$ depends only on the homotopy type of $M$ as a\nspace, up to free products, in the category of crossed modules, with\n$\\Pi_2(D^2,S^1)$. From this it follows that, if $G$ is a finite crossed module\nand $M$ is finite, then the number of crossed module morphisms $\\Pi_2(M,M^1)\n\\to G$ can be re-scaled to a homotopy invariant $I_G(M)$, depending only on the\nhomotopy 2-type of $M$. We describe an algorithm for calculating\n$\\pi_2(M,M^{(1)})$ as a crossed module over $\\pi_1(M^{(1)})$, in the case when\n$M$ is the complement of a knotted surface $\\Sigma$ in $S^4$ and $M^{(1)}$ is\nthe handlebody made from the 0- and 1-handles of a handle decomposition of $M$.\nHere $\\Sigma$ is presented by a knot with bands. This in particular gives us a\ngeometric method for calculating the algebraic 2-type of the complement of a\nknotted surface from a hyperbolic splitting of it. We prove in addition that\nthe invariant $I_G$ yields a non-trivial invariant of knotted surfaces in $S^4$\nwith good properties with regards to explicit calculations.\n", "  We formulate the spin foam perturbation theory for three-dimensional\nEuclidean Quantum Gravity with a cosmological constant. We analyse the\nperturbative expansion of the partition function in the dilute-gas limit and we\nargue that the Baez conjecture stating that the number of possible distinct\ntopological classes of perturbative configurations is finite for the set of all\ntriangulations of a manifold, is not true. However, the conjecture is true for\na special class of triangulations which are based on subdivisions of certain\n3-manifold cubulations. In this case we calculate the partition function and\nshow that the dilute-gas correction vanishes for the simplest choice of the\nvolume operator. By slightly modifying the dilute-gas limit, we obtain a\nnonvanishing correction which is related to the second order perturbative\ncorrection. By assuming that the dilute-gas limit coupling constant is a\nfunction of the cosmological constant, we obtain a value for the partition\nfunction which is independent of the choice of the volume operator.\n", "  We define the thin fundamental Gray 3-groupoid $S_3(M)$ of a smooth manifold\n$M$ and define (by using differential geometric data) 3-dimensional holonomies,\nto be smooth strict Gray 3-groupoid maps $S_3(M) \\to C(H)$, where $H$ is a\n2-crossed module of Lie groups and $C(H)$ is the Gray 3-groupoid naturally\nconstructed from $H$. As an application, we define Wilson 3-sphere observables.\n", "  We define a four-dimensional spin-foam perturbation theory for the ${\\rm\nBF}$-theory with a $B\\wedge B$ potential term defined for a compact semi-simple\nLie group $G$ on a compact orientable 4-manifold $M$. This is done by using the\nformal spin foam perturbative series coming from the spin-foam generating\nfunctional. We then regularize the terms in the perturbative series by passing\nto the category of representations of the quantum group $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$\nwhere $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$ and $q$ is a root of unity. The\nChain-Mail formalism can be used to calculate the perturbative terms when the\nvector space of intertwiners $\\Lambda\\otimes \\Lambda \\to A$, where $A$ is the\nadjoint representation of $\\mathfrak{g}$, is 1-dimensional for each irrep\n$\\Lambda$. We calculate the partition function $Z$ in the dilute-gas limit for\na special class of triangulations of restricted local complexity, which we\nconjecture to exist on any 4-manifold $M$. We prove that the first-order\nperturbative contribution vanishes for finite triangulations, so that we define\na dilute-gas limit by using the second-order contribution. We show that $Z$ is\nan analytic continuation of the Crane-Yetter partition function. Furthermore,\nwe relate $Z$ to the partition function for the $F\\wedge F$ theory.\n", "  We generalize the BF theory action to the case of a general Lie crossed\nmodule $(H \\to G)$, where $G$ and $H$ are non-abelian Lie groups. Our\nconstruction requires the existence of $G$-invariant non-degenerate bilinear\nforms on the Lie algebras of $G$ and $H$ and we show that there are many\nexamples of such Lie crossed modules by using the construction of crossed\nmodules provided by short chain complexes of vector spaces. We also generalize\nthis construction to an arbitrary chain complex of vector spaces, of finite\ntype. We construct two gauge-invariant actions for 2-flat and fake-flat\n2-connections with auxiliary fields. The first action is of the same type as\nthe BFCG action introduced by Girelli, Pfeiffer and Popescu for a special class\nof Lie crossed modules, where $H$ is abelian. The second action is an extended\nBFCG action which contains an additional auxiliary field. However, these two\nactions are related by a field redefinition. We also construct a\nthree-parameter deformation of the extended BFCG action, which we believe to be\nrelevant for the construction of non-trivial invariants of knotted surfaces\nembedded in the four-sphere.\n", "  We are demonstrating in what way slowing down ultrarelativistic shocks are\ncreating GRB lags. The reflection process produces positive lags and Cracow\nacceleration process negative lags. We present a way the seed particles are\ninjected into relativistic jets.\n", "  We study the constant contributions to the free energies obtained through the\ntopological recursion applied to the complex curves mirror to toric Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds. We show that the recursion reproduces precisely the corresponding\nGromov-Witten invariants, which can be encoded in powers of the MacMahon\nfunction. As a result, we extend the scope of the \"remodeling conjecture\" to\nthe full free energies, including the constant contributions. In the process we\nstudy how the pair of pants decomposition of the mirror curves plays an\nimportant role in the topological recursion. We also show that the free\nenergies are not, strictly speaking, symplectic invariants, and that the\nrecursive construction of the free energies does not commute with certain\nlimits of mirror curves.\n", "  In the context of higher gauge theory, we construct a flat and fake flat\n2-connection, in the configuration space of $n$ particles in the complex plane,\ncategorifying the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection. To this end, we define the\ndifferential crossed module of horizontal 2-chord diagrams, categorifying the\nLie algebra of horizontal chord diagrams in a set of $n$ parallel copies of the\ninterval. This therefore yields a categorification of the 4-term relation. We\ncarefully discuss the representation theory of differential crossed modules in\nchain-complexes of vector spaces, which makes it possible to formulate the\nnotion of an infinitesimal 2-R matrix in a differential crossed module.\n", "  We have investigated the analytical and numerical dynamics of entanglement\nfor two qubits that interact with each other via Heisenberg XXX-type\ninteraction and subject to local time-specific external kick and Gaussian\npulse-type magnetic fields in x-y plane. The qubits have been assumed to be\ninitially prepared in different pure separable and maximally entangled states\nand the effect of the strength and the direction of external fast pulses on\nconcurrence has been investigated. The carefully designed kick or pulse\nsequences are found to enable one to obtain constant long-lasting entanglement\nwith desired magnitude. Moreover, the time ordering effects are found to be\nimportant in the creation and manipulation of entanglement by external fields.\n", "  The generalized volume conjecture relates asymptotic behavior of the colored\nJones polynomials to objects naturally defined on an algebraic curve, the zero\nlocus of the A-polynomial $A(x,y)$. Another \"family version\" of the volume\nconjecture depends on a quantization parameter, usually denoted $q$ or $\\hbar$;\nthis quantum volume conjecture (also known as the AJ-conjecture) can be stated\nin a form of a q-difference equation that annihilates the colored Jones\npolynomials and $SL(2,\\C)$ Chern-Simons partition functions. We propose\nrefinements / categorifications of both conjectures that include an extra\ndeformation parameter $t$ and describe similar properties of homological knot\ninvariants and refined BPS invariants. Much like their unrefined /\ndecategorified predecessors, that correspond to $t=-1$, the new volume\nconjectures involve objects naturally defined on an algebraic curve $A^{ref}\n(x,y; t)$ obtained by a particular deformation of the A-polynomial, and its\nquantization $\\hat A^{ref} (\\hat x, \\hat y; q, t)$. We compute both classical\nand quantum t-deformed curves in a number of examples coming from colored knot\nhomologies and refined BPS invariants.\n", "  We introduce and study the Hermitian matrix model with potential\nV(x)=x^2/2-stx/(1-tx), which enumerates the number of linear chord diagrams of\nfixed genus with specified numbers of backbones generated by s and chords\ngenerated by t. For the one-cut solution, the partition function, correlators\nand free energies are convergent for small t and all s as a perturbation of the\nGaussian potential, which arises for st=0. This perturbation is computed using\nthe formalism of the topological recursion. The corresponding enumeration of\nchord diagrams gives at once the number of RNA complexes of a given topology as\nwell as the number of cells in Riemann's moduli spaces for bordered surfaces.\nThe free energies are computed here in principle for all genera and explicitly\nfor genera less than four.\n", "  We introduce and compute a 2-parameter family deformation of the A-polynomial\nthat encodes the color dependence of the superpolynomial and that, in suitable\nlimits, reduces to various deformations of the A-polynomial studied in the\nliterature. These special limits include the t-deformation which leads to the\n\"refined A-polynomial\" introduced in the previous work of the authors and the\nQ-deformation which leads, by the conjecture of Aganagic and Vafa, to the\naugmentation polynomial of knot contact homology. We also introduce and compute\nthe quantum version of the super-A-polynomial, an operator that encodes\nrecursion relations for S^r-colored HOMFLY homology. Much like its predecessor,\nthe super-A-polynomial admits a simple physical interpretation as the defining\nequation for the space of SUSY vacua (= critical points of the twisted\nsuperpotential) in a circle compactification of the effective 3d N=2 theory\nassociated to a knot or, more generally, to a 3-manifold M. Equivalently, the\nalgebraic curve defined by the zero locus of the super-A-polynomial can be\nthought of as the space of open string moduli in a brane system associated with\nM. As an inherent outcome of this work, we provide new interesting formulas for\ncolored superpolynomials for the trefoil and the figure-eight knot.\n", "  We report a bound state of the one-dimensional two-particle (bosonic or\nfermionic) Hubbard model with an impurity potential. This state has the\nBethe-ansatz form, although the model is nonintegrable. Moreover, for a wide\nregion in parameter space, its energy is located in the continuum band. A\nremarkable advantage of this state with respect to similar states in other\nsystems is the simple analytical form of the wave function and eigenvalue. This\nstate can be tuned in and out of the continuum continuously.\n", "  We construct a flat (and fake-flat) 2-connection in the configuration space\nof $n$ indistinguishable particles in the complex plane, which categorifies the\n$sl(2,C)$-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection obtained from the adjoint\nrepresentation of $sl(2,C)$. This will be done by considering the adjoint\ncategorical representation of the string Lie 2-algebra and the notion of an\ninfinitesimal 2-Yang-Baxter operator in a differential crossed module.\nSpecifically, we find an infinitesimal 2-Yang-Baxter operator in the string Lie\n2-algebra, proving that any (strict) categorical representation of the string\nLie-2-algebra, in a chain-complex of vector spaces, yields a flat and (fake\nflat) 2-connection in the configuration space, categorifying the\n$sl(2,C)$-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection. We will give very detailed\nexplanation of all concepts involved, in particular discussing the relevant\ntheory of 2-connections and their two dimensional holonomy, in the specific\ncase of 2-groups derived from chain complexes of vector spaces.\n", "  There has been a recent spate of essays defending presentism, the view in the\nmetaphysics of time according to which all and only present events or entities\nexist. What is particularly striking about this resurgence is that it takes\nplace on the background of the significant pressure exerted on the position by\nthe relativity of simultaneity asserted in special relativity, and yet in\nseveral cases invokes modern physics for support. I classify the presentist\narguments into a two by two matrix depending on whether they take a\ncompatibilist or incompatibilist stance with respect to both special relativity\nin particular and modern physics in general. I then review and evaluate what I\ntake to be some of the most forceful and intriguing presentist arguments\nturning on modern physics. Although nothing of what I will say eventuates its\ncategorical demise, I hope to show that whatever presentism remains compatible\nwith empirical facts and our best physics is metaphysically repugnant.\n", "  We study singularities of algebraic curves associated with 3d N=2 theories\nthat have at least one global flavor symmetry. Of particular interest is a\nclass of theories T_K labeled by knots, whose partition functions package\nPoincare polynomials of the S^r-colored HOMFLY homologies. We derive the\ndefining equation, called the super-A-polynomial, for algebraic curves\nassociated with many new examples of 3d N=2 theories T_K and study its\nsingularity structure. In particular, we catalog general types of singularities\nthat presumably exist for all knots and propose their physical interpretation.\nA computation of super-A-polynomials is based on a derivation of corresponding\nsuperpolynomials, which is interesting in its own right and relies solely on a\nstructure of differentials in S^r-colored HOMFLY homologies.\n", "  These are notes on the theory of super Riemann surfaces and their moduli\nspaces, aiming to collect results that are useful for a better understanding of\nsuperstring perturbation theory in the RNS formalism.\n", "  In this paper we use the formalism of S.Weinberg in order to construct a\nmathematical model based on the weak decay of hadrons and nuclei. In particular\nwe consider a model which generalizes the weak decay of the nucleus of the\ncobalt. We associate with this model a Hamiltonian with cutoffs in a Fock\nspace. The Hamiltonian is self-adjoint and has an unique ground state. By using\nthe commutator theory we get a limiting absorption principle from which we\ndeduce that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is absolutely continuous above the\nenergy of the ground state and below the first threshold.\n", "  It is predicted that the principal specialization of the partition function\nof a B-model topological string theory, that is mirror dual to an A-model\nenumerative geometry problem, satisfies a Schroedinger equation, and that the\ncharacteristic variety of the Schroedinger operator gives the spectral curve of\nthe B-model theory, when an algebraic K-theory obstruction vanishes. In this\npaper we present two concrete mathematical A-model examples whose mirror dual\npartners exhibit these predicted features on the B-model side. The A-model\nexamples we discuss are the generalized Catalan numbers of an arbitrary genus\nand the single Hurwitz numbers. In each case, we show that the Laplace\ntransform of the counting functions satisfies the Eynard-Orantin topological\nrecursion, that the B-model partition function satisfies the KP equations, and\nthat the principal specialization of the partition function satisfies a\nSchroedinger equation whose total symbol is exactly the Lagrangian immersion of\nthe spectral curve of the Eynard-Orantin theory.\n", "  We review a derivation of the numbers of RNA complexes of an arbitrary\ntopology. These numbers are encoded in the free energy of the hermitian matrix\nmodel with potential V(x)=x^2/2-stx/(1-tx), where s and t are respective\ngenerating parameters for the number of RNA molecules and hydrogen bonds in a\ngiven complex. The free energies of this matrix model are computed using the\nso-called topological recursion, which is a powerful new formalism arising from\nrandom matrix theory. These numbers of RNA complexes also have profound meaning\nin mathematics: they provide the number of chord diagrams of fixed genus with\nspecified numbers of backbones and chords as well as the number of cells in\nRiemann's moduli spaces for bordered surfaces of fixed topological type.\n", "  We review a construction of a new class of algebraic curves, called\nsuper-A-polynomials, and their quantum generalizations. The super-A-polynomial\nis a two-parameter deformation of the A-polynomial known from knot theory or\nChern-Simons theory with SL(2,C) gauge group. The two parameters of the\nsuper-A-polynomial encode, respectively, the t-deformation which leads to the\n\"refined A-polynomial\", and the Q-deformation which leads to the augmentation\npolynomial of knot contact homology. For a given knot, the super-A-polynomial\nencodes the asymptotics of the corresponding S^r-colored HOMFLY homology for\nlarge r, while the quantum super-A-polynomial provides recursion relations for\nsuch homology theories for each r. The super-A-polynomial also admits a simple\nphysical interpretation as the defining equation for the space of SUSY vacua in\na circle compactification of the effective 3d N=2 theory associated to a given\nknot (complement). We discuss properties of super-A-polynomials and illustrate\nthem in many examples.\n", "  The dependence of the Virasoro-$N$-point function on the moduli of the\nRiemann surface is investigated. We propose an algebraic geometric approach\nthat applies to any hyperelliptic Riemann surface.\n", "  The dynamics of atom-field entanglement for a system composed of two atoms\nresonantly coupled to a single mode leaky cavity field has been investigated\nbeyond rotating wave approximation (RWA). By using monogamic relation for\nentanglement of formation (EOF) as well as the lower bound of EOF for bipartite\nmixed states in higher dimensions, contrary to the RWA case, the atom-field\nsystem in the steady states is found to be entangled in the strong-coupling\nregime and the entanglement can grow as a function of atom-field coupling\nstrength.\n", "  Radical ontic structural realism (ROSR) asserts an ontological commitment to\n'free-standing' physical structures understood solely in terms of fundamental\nrelations, without any recourse to relata which stand in these relations. Bain\n(2011) has recently defended ROSR against the common charge of incoherence by\narguing that a reformulation of fundamental physical theories in\ncategory-theoretic terms (rather than the usual set-theoretic ones) offers a\ncoherent and precise articulation of the commitments accepted by ROSR. In this\nessay, we argue that category theory does not offer a more hospitable\nenvironment to ROSR than set theory. We also show that the application of\ncategory-theoretic tools to topological quantum field theory and to algebraic\ngeneralisations of general relativity do not warrant the claim that these\ntheories describe 'object-free' structures. We conclude that category theory\noffers little if any comfort to ROSR.\n", "  We investigate cosmological solutions of f(R,T) modified theories of gravity\nfor perfect fluid in spatially FLRW metric through phase space analysis, where\nR is Ricci scalar and T denotes the trace of energy-momentum tensor of matter\ncontent. We explore and analyze three general theories with Lagrangians of\nminimal $g(R)+h(T)$, pure non--minimal g(R)h(T) and non-minimal $g(R)(1+h(T))$\ncouplings through dynamical systems approach. We introduce a few variables and\ndimensionless parameters to simplify the equations in more concise forms. The\nconservation of energy-momentum tensor leads to a constraint equation that, in\nthe minimal gravity, confines functionality of h(T) to a particular form,\nhence, relates the dynamical variables. In this case, acceptable cosmological\nsolutions that contain a long enough matter dominated era followed by a\nlate-time accelerated expansion are found. To support theoretical results, we\nalso obtain numerical solutions for a few functions of g(R), and results of the\ncorresponding models confirm the predictions. We classify solutions into six\nclasses which demonstrate more acceptable solutions and there is more freedom\nto have the matter dominated era than in the f(R) gravity. In particular, there\nis a new fixed point which can represent late-time acceleration. We draw\ndifferent diagrams of the matter densities (consistent with the present\nvalues), the related scale factors and effective equation of state. The\ncorresponding diagrams of parameters illustrate that there is a saddle\nacceleration era which is a middle era before final stable acceleration de\nSitter era for some models. All presented diagrams determine radiation, matter\nand late-time acceleration eras very well.\n", "  We categorify the notion of an infinitesimal braiding in a linear strict\nsymmetric monoidal category, leading to the notion of a (strict) infinitesimal\n2-braiding in a linear symmetric strict monoidal 2-category. We describe the\nassociated categorification of the 4-term relation, leading to six categorified\nrelations. We prove that any infinitesimal 2-braiding gives rise to a flat and\nfake flat 2-connection in the configuration space of $n$ particles in the\ncomplex plane, hence to a categorification of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov\nconnection. We discuss infinitesimal 2-braidings in a 2-category naturally\nassigned to every differential crossed module, leading to the notion of a\nquasi-invariant tensor in a differential crossed module. Finally we prove that\nquasi-invariant tensors exist in the differential crossed module associated to\nthe String Lie-2-algebra.\n", "  The present politically correct consensus is that increased exchange of\nscientific insight, knowledge, practitioners and skills at the global level\nbrings significant benefits to all. The quantifiable scientometric changes\nduring the last decade, however, suggest that many areas of knowledge are\nevolving in the opposite direction. Despite an increase during the last decade\nof the numbers of journals and academic articles published, increases in the\nnumber of citations the published articles receive, and increases in the number\nof countries participating; important parts of the academic activity are\nbecoming more nationalistic. In addition, international collaboration is\ndecreasing in several subject areas, and in several geographic regions. For\nexample, countries in Asia are becoming scientifically more isolated; and\nacademics working in the humanities in all the regions of the world are very\nnationalistic and are becoming more so. The precise consequences of this\ndynamics are difficult to predict, but it certainly will have reverberations\nbeyond academia. The tendency of the humanities to become more provincial will\ncertainly not help in reducing international conflicts arising from poor\nunderstanding of cultural differences and of diverging sociopolitical world\nviews. More and better data on these trends should give us a better\nunderstanding for eventually improving academic policies worldwide.\n  Keywords: International Collaboration, National, Science, Humanities, Policy\n", "  A heat pump model utilizing the Dufour effect is proposed and studied by\nnumerical and theoretical analysis. Numerically, we perform MD simulations of\nthis system and measure the cooling power and the coefficient of performance\n(COP) as figures of merit. Theoretically, we calculate the cooling power and\nthe COP from the henomenological equations describing this system by using the\nlinear irreversible thermodynamics and compare the theoretical results with the\nMD results.\n", "  In fivebrane compactifications on 3-manifolds, we point out the importance of\nall flat connections in the proper definition of the effective 3d N=2 theory.\nThe Lagrangians of some theories with the desired properties can be constructed\nwith the help of homological knot invariants that categorify colored Jones\npolynomials. Higgsing the full 3d theories constructed this way recovers\ntheories found previously by Dimofte-Gaiotto-Gukov. We also consider the\ncutting and gluing of 3-manifolds along smooth boundaries and the role played\nby all flat connections in this operation.\n", "  Spacetime as we know and love it is lost in most approaches to quantum\ngravity. For many of these approaches, as inchoate and incomplete as they may\nbe, one of the main challenges is to relate what they take to be the\nfundamental non-spatiotemporal structure of the world back to the classical\nspacetime of GR. The present essay investigates how spacetime is lost and how\nit may be regained in one major approach to quantum gravity, loop quantum\ngravity.\n", "  To find more deliberate f(R,T) cosmological solutions, we proceed our\nprevious paper further by studying some new aspects of the considered models\nvia investigation of some new cosmological parameters/quantities to attain the\nmost acceptable cosmological results. Our investigations are performed by\napplying the dynamical system approach. We obtain the cosmological\nparameters/quantities in terms of some defined dimensionless parameters that\nare used in constructing the dynamical equations of motion. The investigated\nparameters/quantities are the evolution of the Hubble parameter and its\ninverse, the \"weight function\", the ratio of the matter density to the dark\nenergy density and its time variation, the deceleration, the jerk and the snap\nparameters, and the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy. We\nnumerically examine these quantities for two general models $R+\\alpha\nR^{-n}+\\sqrt{-T}$ and $R\\log{[\\alpha R]}^{q}+\\sqrt{-T}$. All considered models\nhave some inconsistent quantities (with respect to the available observational\ndata), except the model with n=-0.9 which has more consistent quantities than\nthe other ones. By considering the ratio of the matter density to the dark\nenergy density, we find that the coincidence problem does~not refer to a unique\ncosmological event, rather, this coincidence also occurred in the early\nuniverse. We also present the cosmological solutions for an interesting model\n$R+c_{1}\\sqrt{-T}$ in the non--flat FLRW metric. We show that this model has an\nattractor solution for the late times, though with $w^{(\\textrm{DE})}=-1/2$.\nThis model indicates that the spatial curvature density parameter gets\nnegligible values until the present era, in which it acquires the values of the\norder $10^{-4}$ or $10^{-3}$. As the second part of this work, we consider the\nweak-field [It continues ...]\n", "  The emergence of collective decision in swarms and their coordinated response\nto complex environments underscore the central role played by social\ntransmission of information. Here, the different possible origins of\ninformation flow bottlenecks are identified. Using a combination of network-,\ncontrol- and information-theoretic elements applied to a group of interacting\nself-propelled particles, the effect of varying information capacity of the\nsignaling channel on dynamic collective behaviors is revealed. We find a\nsufficient condition on the information data rate that guarantees the\neffectiveness of swarming while also highlighting the profound connection with\nthe topology of the underlying interaction network. We also show that when\ndecreasing the data rate, the swarming behavior invariably vanishes following a\nsecond-order phase transition irrespective of the intrinsic noise level. The\nvariations along the transition line are found to be in good agreement with\ninformation-theoretic predictions.\n", "  Recent empirical observations of three-dimensional bird flocks and human\ncrowds have challenged the long-prevailing assumption that a metric interaction\ndistance rules swarming behaviors. In some cases, individual agents are found\nto be engaged in local information exchanges with a fixed number of neighbors,\ni.e. a topological interaction. However, complex system dynamics based on pure\nmetric or pure topological distances both face physical inconsistencies in low\nand high density situations. Here, we propose a hybrid metric-topological\ninteraction distance overcoming these issues and enabling a real-life\nimplementation in artificial robotic swarms. We use network- and\ngraph-theoretic approaches combined with a dynamical model of locally\ninteracting self-propelled particles to study the consensus reaching pro- cess\nfor a swarm ruled by this hybrid interaction distance. Specifically, we\nestablish exactly the probability of reaching consensus in the absence of\nnoise. In addition, simulations of swarms of self-propelled particles are\ncarried out to assess the influence of the hybrid distance and noise.\n", "  We study the high-energy behavior of the scattering amplitudes in quantum\nelectrodynamics beyond the leading order of the small electron mass expansion\nin the leading logarithmic approximation. In contrast to the Sudakov\nlogarithms, the mass-suppressed double-logarithmic radiative corrections are\ninduced by a soft electron pair exchange and result in enhancement of the\npower-suppressed contribution. Possible applications of our result to the\nanalysis of the high-energy processes in quantum chromodynamics is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Considering the supersymmetric model with the long-lived charged Higgsino, we\ndiscuss how Higgsino kink signals can show up in the latest LHC Disappearing\nTrack (DT) and stable chargino searches. We derive constraints on the Higgsino\nkink signal, and characterize it in comparison to the Wino DT and the slepton\nkink track. We also discuss how to infer Higgsino model kinematics.\n", "  After a thorough treatment of all algebraic structures involved, we address\ntwo dimensional holonomy operators with values in crossed modules of Hopf\nalgebras and in crossed modules of associative algebras (called here crossed\nmodules of bare algebras.) In particular, we will consider two general\nformulations of the two-dimensional holonomy of a (fully primitive) Hopf\n2-connection (exact and blur), the first being multiplicative the second being\nadditive, proving that they coincide in a certain natural quotient (defining\nwhat we called the fuzzy holonomy of a fully primitive Hopf 2-connection).\n", "  We analyze relations between BPS degeneracies related to\nLabastida-Marino-Ooguri-Vafa (LMOV) invariants, and algebraic curves associated\nto knots. We introduce a new class of such curves that we call extremal\nA-polynomials, discuss their special properties, and determine exact and\nasymptotic formulas for the corresponding (extremal) BPS degeneracies. These\nformulas lead to nontrivial integrality statements in number theory, as well as\nto an improved integrality conjecture stronger than the known M-theory\nintegrality predictions. Furthermore we determine the BPS degeneracies encoded\nin augmentation polynomials and show their consistency with known colored\nHOMFLY polynomials. Finally we consider refined BPS degeneracies for knots,\ndetermine them from the knowledge of super-A-polynomials, and verify their\nintegrality. We illustrate our results with twist knots, torus knots, and\nvarious other knots with up to 10 crossings.\n", "  In the recent years, we have seen that Grover search algorithm (Proceedings,\n28th annual ACM symposium on the theory of computing, pp. 212-219, 1996) by\nusing quantum parallelism has revolutionized the field of solving huge class of\nNP problems in comparisons to classical systems. In this work, we explore the\nidea of extending Grover search algorithm to approximate algorithms. Here we\ntry to analyze the applicability of Grover search to process an unstructured\ndatabase with a dynamic selection function in contrast to the static selection\nfunction used in the original work (Grover in Proceedings, 28th annual ACM\nsymposium on the theory of computing, pp. 212-219, 1996). We show that this\nalteration facilitates us to extend the application of Grover search to the\nfield of randomized search algorithms. Further, we use the dynamic Grover\nsearch algorithm to define the goals for a recommendation system based on which\nwe propose a recommendation algorithm which uses binomial similarity\ndistribution space giving us a quadratic speedup over traditional classical\nunstructured recommendation systems. Finally, we see how dynamic Grover search\ncan be used to tackle a wide range of optimization problems where we improve\ncomplexity over existing optimization algorithms.\n", "  The main aim of this work is to develop a method of constructing higher\nHamiltonians of quantum integrable systems associated with the solution of the\nZamolodchikov tetrahedral equation. As opposed to the result of V.V. Bazhanov\nand S.M. Sergeev the approach presented here is effective for generic solutions\nof the tetrahedral equation without spectral parameter. In a sense, this result\nis a two-dimensional generalization of the method by J.-M. Maillet. The work is\na part of the project relating the tetrahedral equation with the\nquasi-invariants of 2-knots.\n", "  By exploiting suitably constrained Zorn matrices, we present a new\nconstruction of the algebra of sextonions (over the algebraically closed field\n$\\mathbb{C}$). This allows for an explicit construction, in terms of Jordan\npairs, of the non-semisimple Lie algebra $\\mathbf{e_{7 \\frac12}}$, intermediate\nbetween $\\mathbf{e_{7}}$ and $\\mathbf{e_{8}}$, as well as of all Lie algebras\noccurring in the sextonionic row and column of the extended Freudenthal Magic\nSquare.\n", "  The Price equation shows the unity between the fundamental expressions of\nchange in biology, in information and entropy descriptions of populations, and\nin aspects of thermodynamics. The Price equation partitions the change in the\naverage value of a metric between two populations. A population may be composed\nof organisms or particles or any members of a set to which we can assign\nprobabilities. A metric may be biological fitness or physical energy or the\noutput of an arbitrarily complicated function that assigns quantitative values\nto members of the population. The first part of the Price equation describes\nhow directly applied forces change the probabilities assigned to members of the\npopulation when holding constant the metrical values of the members---a fixed\nmetrical frame of reference. The second part describes how the metrical values\nchange, altering the metrical frame of reference. In canonical examples, the\ndirect forces balance the changing metrical frame of reference, leaving the\naverage or total metrical values unchanged. In biology, relative reproductive\nsuccess (fitness) remains invariant as a simple consequence of the conservation\nof total probability. In physics, systems often conserve total energy.\nNonconservative metrics can be described by starting with conserved metrics,\nand then studying how coordinate transformations between conserved and\nnonconserved metrics alter the geometry of the dynamics and the aggregate\nvalues of populations. From this abstract perspective, key results from\ndifferent subjects appear more simply as universal geometric principles for the\ndynamics of populations subject to the constraints of particular conserved\nquantities\n", "  We obtain the analytical expression for the Kraus decomposition of the\nquantum map of an environment modeled by an arbitrary quadratic fermionic\nHamiltonian acting on one or two qubits, and derive simple functions to check\nthe non-positivity of the intermediate map. These functions correspond to two\ndifferent sufficient criteria for non-Markovianity. In the particular case of\nan environment represented by the Ising Hamiltonian, we discuss the two sources\nof non-Markovianity in the model, one due to the finite size of the lattice,\nand another due to the kind of interactions.\n", "  Zagarola and Smits developed an empirical velocity parameter for scaling the\nouter region of the turbulent boundary layer velocity profile that has been\nwidely applied to experimental datasets. Plots of the scaled defect profiles\nindicate that most datasets display similar-like behavior using the Zagarola\nand Smits scaling parameter. In the work herein, it is shown that the common\npractice of finding similarity behavior using the defect profile is often\nincomplete in the sense that not all of the criteria for similarity have been\nchecked for compliance. When full compliance is checked, it is found that most\nof the datasets which display defect similarity do not satisfy all the criteria\nrequired for similarity. The nature of this contradiction and noncompliance is\ndescribed in detail. It is shown that the original datasets used by Zagarola\nand Smits display this flawed similarity behavior. Hence, a careful\nreassessment of any claims in the literature is required for those groups that\nattempted to use the defect profile and the Zagarola and Smits type of velocity\nscaling parameter to assert similarity of the velocity profile.\n", "  Half a century ago, Mott noted that tuning the carrier density of a semimetal\ntowards zero produces an insulating state in which electrons and holes form\nbound pairs. It was later argued that such pairing persists even if a\nsemiconducting gap opens in the underlying band structure, giving rise to what\nhas become known as the strong coupling limit of an `excitonic insulator.'\nWhile these `weak' and `strong' coupling extremes were subsequently proposed to\nbe manifestations of the same excitonic state of electronic matter, the\npredicted continuity of such a phase across a band gap opening has not been\nrealized experimentally in any material. Here we show the quantum limit of\ngraphite, by way of temperature and angle-resolved magnetoresistance\nmeasurements, to host such an excitonic insulator phase that evolves\ncontinuously between the weak and strong coupling limits. We find that the\nmaximum transition temperature T_EI of the excitonic phase is coincident with a\nband gap opening in the underlying electronic structure at B_0= 46 +/- 1 T,\nwhich is evidenced above T_EI by a thermally broadened inflection point in the\nmagnetoresistance. The overall asymmetry of the observed phase boundary around\nB_0 closely matches theoretical predictions of a magnetic field-tuned excitonic\ninsulator phase in which the opening of a band gap marks a crossover from\npredominantly momentum-space pairing to real-space pairing.\n", "  This article demonstrates the applicability of the parallel-in-time method\nParareal to the numerical solution of the Einstein gravity equations for the\nspherical collapse of a massless scalar field. To account for the shrinking of\nthe spatial domain in time, a tailored load balancing scheme is proposed and\ncompared to load balancing based on number of time steps alone. The performance\nof Parareal is studied for both the sub-critical and black hole case; our\nexperiments show that Parareal generates substantial speedup and, in the\nsuper-critical regime, can reproduce Choptuik's black hole mass scaling law.\n", "  Production cross-sections of prompt charm mesons are measured with the first\ndata from $pp$ collisions at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$13\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of\n$4.98 \\pm 0.19\\,\\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experiment. The\nproduction cross-sections of $D^{0}$, $D^{+}$, $D_{s}^{+}$, and $D^{*+}$ mesons\nare measured in bins of charm meson transverse momentum, $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$, and\nrapidity, $y$, and cover the range $0 < p_{\\mathrm{T}} < 15\\,\\mathrm{GeV}/c$\nand $2.0 < y < 4.5$. The inclusive cross-sections for the four mesons,\nincluding charge conjugation, within the range of $1 < p_{\\mathrm{T}} <\n8\\,\\mathrm{GeV}/c$ are found to be \\begin{equation} \\sigma(pp \\to D^{0} X) =\n2072 \\pm 2 \\pm 124\\,\\mu\\mathrm{b}\\\\ \\sigma(pp \\to D^{+} X) = 834 \\pm 2 \\pm\n\\phantom{1}78\\,\\mu\\mathrm{b}\\\\ \\sigma(pp \\to D_{s}^{+} X) = 353 \\pm 9 \\pm\n\\phantom{1}76\\,\\mu\\mathrm{b}\\\\ \\sigma(pp \\to D^{*+} X) = 784 \\pm 4 \\pm\n\\phantom{1}87\\,\\mu\\mathrm{b} \\end{equation} where the uncertainties are due to\nstatistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively.\n", "  In [arXiv:1411.3592] an extension of the Ashtekar-Lewandowski (AL) state\nspace of Loop Quantum Gravity was set up with the help a projective formalism\nintroduced by Kijowski [Kijowski 1977; see also: arXiv:1304.6330,\narXiv:1411.3590]. The motivation for this work was to achieve a more balanced\ntreatment of the position and momentum variables (aka. holonomies and fluxes).\nIndeed, states in the AL Hilbert spaces describe discrete quantum excitations\non top of a vacuum which is an eigenstate of the flux variables (a\n`no-geometry' state): in such states, most holonomies are totally spread,\nmaking it difficult to approximate a smooth, classical 4-geometry. However,\ngoing beyond the AL sector does not fully resolve this difficulty: one uncovers\na deeper issue hindering the construction of states semi-classical with respect\nto a full set of observables. In the present article, we analyze this issue in\nthe case of real-valued holonomies (we will briefly comment on the heuristic\nimplications for other gauge groups, eg. $\\mathcal{SU}(2)$). Specifically, we\nshow that, in this case, there does not exist any state on the holonomy-flux\nalgebra in which the variances of the holonomies and fluxes observables would\nall be finite, let alone small. It is important to note that this obstruction\ncannot be bypassed by further enlarging the quantum state space, for it arises\nfrom the structure of the algebra itself: as there are too many (uncountably\nmany) non-vanishing commutators between the holonomy and flux operators, the\ncorresponding Heisenberg inequalities force the quantum uncertainties to blow\nup uncontrollably. A way out would be to suitably restrict the algebra of\nobservables. In a companion paper we take the first steps in this direction by\ndeveloping a general framework to perform such a restriction without giving up\nthe universality and diffeomorphism invariance of the theory.\n", "  We calculate the mean free path in a hot and dense nuclear environment for a\nfermionic dark matter particle candidate in the $\\sim$GeV mass range\ninteracting with nucleons via scalar and vector effective couplings. We focus\non the effects of density and temperature in the nuclear medium in order to\nevaluate the importance of the final state blocking in the scattering process.\nWe discuss qualitatively possible implications for opacities in stellar nuclear\nscenarios, where dark matter may be gravitationally accreted.\n", "  The recently developed pragmatical model of asymmetric double-well potentials\nwith a finite lifetime is applied to nonlinear dielectric data in polar\nundercooled liquids. The viscous effects from the finite lifetime provide a\ncrossover from the cooperative jumps of many molecules at short times to the\nmotion of statistically independent molecules at long times. The model allows\nto determine the size of cooperatively rearranging regions from nonlinear\n{\\omega}-data and throws a new light on a known inconsistency between nonlinear\n{\\omega} and 3{\\omega}-signals for glycerol and propylene carbonate.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce the notions of a $3$-$Lie_\\infty$-algebra and a\n3-Lie 2-algebra. The former is a model for a 3-Lie algebra that satisfy the\nfundamental identity up to all higher homotopies, and the latter is the\ncategorification of a 3-Lie algebra. We prove that the 2-category of 2-term\n$3$-$Lie_\\infty$-algebras is equivalent to the 2-category of 3-Lie 2-algebras.\nSkeletal and strict 3-Lie 2-algebras are studied in detail. A construction of a\n3-Lie 2-algebra from a symplectic 3-Lie algebra is given.\n", "  We give three short proofs of the Makeenko-Migdal equation for the Yang-Mills\nmeasure on the plane, two using the edge variables and one using the loop or\nlasso variables. Our proofs are significantly simpler than the earlier\npioneering rigorous proofs given by T. L\\'evy and by A. Dahlqvist. In\nparticular, our proofs are \"local\" in nature, in that they involve only\nderivatives with respect to variables adjacent to the crossing in question. In\nan accompanying paper with F. Gabriel, we will show that two of our proofs can\nbe adapted to the case of Yang-Mills theory on a compact surface.\n", "  The Standard Model extensions with vector-like states which have either zero\nhypercharge or zero weak isospin are rather poorly constrained by the\nelectroweak precision measurements. Such new states would however modify the\nrunning of the gauge couplings at high energies. As a result, the Drell-Yan\nprocess $p p \\to l^+ l^-$ at the LHC places useful constraints on these models.\nThe relevant observables include both the di-lepton invariant mass distribution\n$M_{l l}$ and the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$. We find that the LHC Run\n1 data and the initial data from Run 2 surpass the sensitivity of LEP and\nalready put meaningful constraints on the existence of such particles, which\nwill become progressively stronger with more data.\n", "  We prove the Makeenko-Migdal equation for two-dimensional Euclidean\nYang-Mills theory on an arbitrary compact surface, possibly with boundary. In\nparticular, we show that two of the proofs given by the first, third, and\nfourth authors for the plane case extend essentially without change to compact\nsurfaces.\n", "  We consider generally-relativistic gauge transformations for the spinorial\nfields finding two mutually exclusive but together exhaustive classes in which\nfermions are placed adding supplementary information to the results obtained by\nLounesto, and identifying quantities analogous to the momentum vector and the\nPauli-Lubanski axial vector we discuss how our results are similar to those\nobtained by Wigner; by taking into account the system of Dirac field equations\nwe will investigate the consequences for the dynamics: and in particular we\nshall address the problem of getting the non-relativistic approximation in a\nconsistent way. We are going to comment on extensions.\n", "  In quantum field theory, bare particles are dressed by a cloud of virtual\nparticles to form physical particles. The virtual particles affect properties\nsuch as the mass and charge of the physical particles, and it is only these\nmodified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of\nthe bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the\nultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has\nrecently been realized in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these\nsystems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity\nphotons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers\nunprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the\nrelation between physical and bare particles. Here we show that, by applying\nexternal electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each\nvirtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be\nconverted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the\nhidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations becomes\nexperimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons\ncan be clearly pictured using Feynman diagrams with cut loops.\n", "  We modify the algorithm we proposed before in Aghamousa & Shafieloo (2015) on\ntime delay estimation of the strong lens systems incorporating weighted\ncross-correlation and weighted summation of correlation coefficients. We show\nthe high performance of this algorithm by applying it on Time Delay Challenge\n(TDC1) simulated data. We apply then our proposed method on the light curves of\nthe lensed quasar SDSS J1001+5027 since this system has been well studied by\nother groups to compare our results with their findings. In this work we\npropose a new estimator namely \"mirror\" estimator along with a list of criteria\nfor reliability test of estimation. Our mirror estimator results to\n$-117.1^{+7.1}_{-3.7}$ and $-117.1^{+7.2}_{-8.8}$ using simple Monte Carlo\nsimulations and simulated light curves provided by Rathna Kumar et al. (2013)\nrespectively. Although TDC1 simulations do not reflect the properties of SDSS\nJ1001+5027 light curves, using these simulations results to smaller uncertainty\nwhich shows the higher quality observations can lead to substantially more\nprecise time delay estimation. Our time delay estimation is in agreement with\nfindings of the other groups for this strong lens system and the difference in\nthe size of the error bars reflects the importance of appropriate light curve\nsimulations.\n", "  We calculate, in the context of a 3-3-1 model with heavy charged leptons,\nconstraints on some parameters of the extra particles in the model by imposing\nthat their contributions to both the electron and muon $(g-2)$ factors are in\nagreement with experimental data up to 1$\\sigma$-3$\\sigma$. In order to obtain\nrealistic results we use some of the possible solutions of the left- and right-\nunitary matrices that diagonalize the lepton mass matrices, giving the observed\nlepton masses and at the same time allowing to accommodate the\nPontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) mixing matrix. We show that, at least up\nto 1-loop order, in the particular range of the space parameter that we have\nexplored, it is not possible to fit the observed electron and muon $(g-2)$\nfactors at the same time unless one of the extra leptons has a mass of the\norder of 20-40 GeVs and the energy scale of the 331 symmetry to be of around\n60-80 TeVs.\n", "  The parametric resonance was studied in chiral phase transitions when the\nmomentum distribution is described by a Tsallis distribution. A Tsallis\ndistribution has two parameters, the temperature $T$ and the entropic index\n$q$. The amplification was estimated in two cases: 1) expansionless case and 2)\none dimensional expansion case. In an expansionless case, the temperature $T$\nis constant, and the amplified modes as a function of $T$ were calculated for\nvarious $q$. In one dimensional expansion case, the temperature $T$ decreases\nas a function of the proper time, and the amplification as a function of the\ntransverse momentum was calculated for various $q$. In the expansionless case,\nthe following facts were found: 1) the larger the value $q$ is, the softer the\namplified modes are for the first and second resonance bands, 2) the amplified\nmode of the first resonance band decreases and vanishes, as the temperature $T$\nincreases, and 3) the amplified mode of the second resonance band decreases and\napproaches to zero, as the temperature $T$ increases. In one dimensional\nexpansion case, the following facts were found: 1) the soft mode is amplified,\n2) the amplification is extremely strong around the amplified mode of the first\nresonance band at $T=0$, and 3) the magnitude of the amplification as a\nfunction of transverse momentum oscillates around the amplified mode of the\nfirst resonance band at $T=0$.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate decoherence of Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn's\nnonlinear sign-shift gate that is implemented with the Jaynes-Cummings model.\nIntroducing a stochastic variable as an external electric field, we let it\ncouple with a dipole moment of a two-level atom. We examine this model using a\nsemiclassical theory. Results of the Monte Carlo simulations under the\nsemiclassical approximation correspond well with those obtained with the\nquantum mechanical perturbation theory for the stochastic process. In the\nresults of the simulations, we observe both the $\\mbox{T}_{1}$ and\n$\\mbox{T}_{2}$ decays. This paper is a sequel to the reference [H.~Azuma, Prog.\nTheor. Phys. {\\bf 126}, 369 (2011)].\n", "  We model the dynamics of the Schelling model for agents described simply by a\ncontinuously distributed variable - wealth. Agents move to neighborhoods where\ntheir wealth is not lesser than that of some proportion of their neighbors, the\nthreshold level. As in the case of the classic Schelling model where\nsegregation obtains between two races, we find here that wealth-based\nsegregation occurs and persists. However, introducing uncertainty into the\ndecision to move - that is, with some probability, if agents are allowed to\nmove even though the threshold level condition is contravened - we find that\neven for small proportions of such disallowed moves, the dynamics no longer\nyield segregation but instead sharply transition into a persistent mixed wealth\ndistribution. We investigate the nature of this sharp transformation between\nsegregated and mixed states, and find that it is because of a non-linear\nrelationship between allowed moves and disallowed moves. For small increases in\ndisallowed moves, there is a rapid corresponding increase in allowed moves, but\nthis tapers off as the fraction of disallowed moves increase further and\nfinally settles at a stable value, remaining invariant to any further increase\nin disallowed moves. It is the overall effect of the dynamics in the initial\nregion (with small numbers of disallowed moves) that shifts the system away\nfrom a state of segregation rapidly to a mixed wealth state.\n  The contravention of the tolerance condition could be interpreted as public\npolicy interventions like minimal levels of social housing or housing benefit\ntransfers to poorer households. Our finding therefore suggests that it might\nrequire only very limited levels of such public intervention - just sufficient\nto enable a small fraction of disallowed moves, because the dynamics generated\nby such moves could spur the transformation from a segregated to mixed\nequilibrium.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the dynamics of magnetic helicity in\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent flows focusing at scales larger than the\nforcing scale. Our results show a nonlocal inverse cascade of magnetic\nhelicity, which occurs directly from the forcing scale into the largest scales\nof the magnetic field. We also observe that no magnetic helicity and no energy\nis transferred to an intermediate range of scales sufficiently smaller than the\ncontainer size and larger than the forcing scale. Thus, the statistical\nproperties of this range of scales, which increases with scale separation, is\nshown to be described to a large extent by the zero flux solutions of the\nabsolute statistical equilibrium theory exhibited by the truncated ideal MHD\nequations.\n", "  We prove a duality principle that connects the thermodynamic limits of the\nfree energies of the Hamiltonians and their squared interactions. Under the\nmain assumption that the limiting free energy is concave in the squared\ntemperature parameter, we show that this relation is valid in a large class of\ndisordered systems. In particular, when applied to mean field spin glasses,\nthis duality provides an interpretation of the Parisi formula as an inverted\nvariational principle, establishing a prediction of Guerra.\n", "  Semiconductor lasers in use today rely on mirrors based on the reflection at\na cleaved facet or Bragg reflection from a periodic stack of layers. Here, we\ndemonstrate an ultra-small laser with a mirror based on the Fano resonance\nbetween a continuum of waveguide modes and the discrete resonance of a\nnanocavity. The Fano resonance leads to unique laser characteristics. Since the\nFano mirror is very narrow-band compared to conventional lasers, the laser is\nsingle-mode and in particular, it can be modulated via the mirror. We show,\nexperimentally and theoretically, that nonlinearities in the mirror may even\npromote the generation of a self-sustained train of pulses at gigahertz\nfrequencies, an effect that was previously only observed in macroscopic lasers.\nSuch a source is of interest for a number of applications within integrated\nphotonics.\n", "  We theoretically study electro-optic light modulation based on the quantum\nmodel where the linear electro-optic effect and the externally applied\nmicrowave field result in the interaction between optical cavity modes. The\nmodel assumes that the number of interacting modes is finite and effects of the\nmode overlapping coefficient on the strength of the intermode interaction can\nbe taken into account through dependence of the coupling coefficient on the\nmode characteristics. We show that, under certain conditions, the model is\nexactly solvable and, in the semiclassical approximation where the microwave\nfield is treated as a classical mode, can be analyzed using the technique of\nthe Jordan mappings for the su(2) Lie algebra. Analytical results are applied\nto study effects of light modulation on the frequency dependence of the photon\ncounting rate. We also establish the conditions of validity of the\nsemiclassical approximation by applying the methods of polynomially deformed\nLie algebras for analysis of the model with quantized microwave field.\n", "  Recently, an algebraic realization of the four-dimensional Pachner move 3--3\nwas found in terms of Grassmann--Gaussian exponentials, and a remarkable\nnonlinear parameterization for it, going in terms of a $\\mathbb C$-valued\n2-cocycle. Here we define, for a given triangulated four-dimensional manifold\nand a 2-cocycle on it, an `exotic' chain complex intimately related to the\nmentioned parameterization, thus providing a basis for algebraic realizations\nof all four-dimensional Pachner moves.\n", "  The quantum mechanical description of the chemical bond is generally given in\nterms of delocalized bonding orbitals, or, alternatively, in terms of\ncorrelations of occupations of localised orbitals. However, in the latter case,\nmultiorbital correlations were treated only in terms of two-orbital\ncorrelations, although the structure of multiorbital correlations is far\nricher; and, in the case of bonds established by more than two electrons,\nmultiorbital correlations represent a more natural point of view. Here, for the\nfirst time, we introduce the true multiorbital correlation theory, consisting\nof a framework for handling the structure of multiorbital correlations, a\ntoolbox of true multiorbital correlation measures, and the formulation of the\nmultiorbital correlation clustering, together with an algorithm for obtaining\nthat. These make it possible to characterise quantitatively, how well a bonding\npicture describes the chemical system. As proof of concept, we apply the theory\nfor the investigation of the bond structures of several molecules. We show that\nthe non-existence of well-defined multiorbital correlation clustering provides\na reason for debated bonding picture.\n", "  The azimuthal correlations of D mesons and charged particles were measured\nwith the ALICE detector in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and p-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. D$^0$,\nD$^+$, and D$^{*+}$ mesons and their charge conjugates with transverse momentum\n$3<p_{\\rm T}<16$ GeV/$c$ and rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass\nsystem $|y_{\\rm cms}|<0.5$ (pp collisions) and $-0.96<y_{\\rm cms}<0.04$ (p-Pb\ncollisions) were correlated to charged particles with $p_{\\rm T}>0.3$ Gev/$c$.\nThe properties of the correlation peak induced by the jet containing the D\nmeson, described in terms of the yield of charged particles in the peak and\npeak width, are compatible within uncertainties between the two collision\nsystems, and described by Monte-Carlo simulations based on the PYTHIA, POWHEG\nand EPOS 3 event generators.\n", "  We evaluate the two-loop ${\\cal O}(m_e^2/s)$ contribution to the wide-angle\nhigh-energy electron-positron scattering in the double-logarithmic\napproximation. The origin and the general structure of the power-suppressed\ndouble logarithmic corrections are discussed in detail.\n", "  The inclusive J/$\\psi$ production has been studied in Pn-Pb and pp collisions\nat the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV,\nusing the ALICE detector at the CERN LHC. The J/$\\psi$ meson is reconstructed,\nin the centre-of-mass rapidity interval $2.5<y<4$ and in the\ntransverse-momentum range $p_{\\rm T}<12$ GeV/$c$, via its decay to a muon pair.\nIn this Letter, we present results on the inclusive J/$\\psi$ cross section in\npp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV and on the nuclear modification factor\n$R_{\\rm AA}$. The latter is presented as a function of the centrality of the\ncollision and, for central collisions, as a function of the transverse momentum\n$p_{\\rm T}$ of the J/$\\psi$. The measured $R_{\\rm AA}$ values indicate a\nsuppression of the J/$\\psi$ in nuclear collisions and are then compared to our\nprevious results obtained in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV.\nThe ratio of the $R_{\\rm AA}$ values at the two energies is also computed and\ncompared to calculations of statistical and dynamical models. The numerical\nvalue of the ratio for central events (0-10\\% centrality) is $1.17 \\pm 0.04\n{\\rm{(stat)}}\\pm 0.20 {\\rm{(syst)}}$. In central events, as a function of\n$p_{\\rm T}$, a slight increase of $R_{\\rm AA}$ with collision energy is visible\nin the region $2<p_{\\rm T}<6$ GeV/$c$. Theoretical calculations provide a good\ndescription of the measurements, within uncertainties.\n", "  The GKZ system for the Hesse pencil of elliptic curves has more solutions\nthan the period integrals. In this work we give different realizations and\ninterpretations of the extra solution, in terms of oscillating integral,\nEichler integral, chain integral on the elliptic curve, limit of a period of a\ncertain compact Calabi-Yau threefold geometry, etc. We also highlight the role\nplayed by the orbifold singularity on the moduli space and its relation to the\nGKZ system.\n", "  In this article we will take into account the most complete back-ground with\ntorsion and curvature, providing the most exhaustive coupling for the Dirac\nfield: we will discuss the integrability of the interaction of the matter field\nand the reduction of the matter field equations.\n", "  We review interaction effects in chaotic metallic nanoparticles. Their\nsingle-particle Hamiltonian is described by the proper random-matrix ensemble\nwhile the dominant interaction terms are invariants under a change of the\nsingle-particle basis. In the absence of spin-orbit scattering, the non-trivial\ninvariants consist of a pairing interaction, which leads to superconductivity\nin the bulk, and a ferromagnetic exchange interaction. Spin-orbit scattering\nbreaks spin-rotation invariance and when it is sufficiently strong, the only\ndominant nontrivial interaction is the pairing interaction. We discuss how the\nmagnetic response of discrete energy levels of the nanoparticle (which can be\nmeasured in single-electron tunneling spectroscopy experiments) is affected by\nsuch pairing correlations and how it can provide a signature of pairing\ncorrelations. We also consider the spin susceptibility of the nanoparticle and\ndiscuss how spin-orbit scattering changes the signatures of pairing\ncorrelations in this observable.\n", "  We investigate the metal-insulator transition occurring in two-dimensional\n(2D) systems of noninteracting atoms in the presence of artificial spin-orbit\ninteractions and a spatially correlated disorder generated by laser speckles.\nBased on a high order discretization scheme, we calculate the precise position\nof the mobility edge and verify that the transition belongs to the symplectic\nuniversality class. We show that the mobility edge depends strongly on the\nmixing angle between Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. For equal\ncouplings a non-power-law divergence is found, signaling the crossing to the\northogonal class, where such a 2D transition is forbidden.\n", "  The necessary and sufficient conditions are found for the two sequences\n$\\left\\{\\mu_n \\right\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ and $\\left\\{a_n \\right\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$\nto be the spectrum and the norming constants respectively, for a boundary value\nproblem $-y'' + q \\left( x \\right) y = \\mu y,$ $y \\left(0\\right)=0,$ $y\\left(\n\\pi \\right)\\cos \\beta + y'\\left( \\pi \\right)\\sin \\beta = 0,$ $\\beta \\in \\left(\n0, \\pi \\right),$ with $q \\in L_{\\mathbb{R}}^1 \\left[0, \\pi \\right].$\n", "  In modern mathematical and theoretical physics various generalizations, in\nparticular supersymmetric or quantum, of Riemann surfaces and complex algebraic\ncurves play a prominent role. We show that such supersymmetric and quantum\ngeneralizations can be combined together, and construct supersymmetric quantum\ncurves, or super-quantum curves for short. Our analysis is conducted in the\nformalism of super-eigenvalue models: we introduce $\\beta$-deformed version of\nthose models, and derive differential equations for associated\n$\\alpha/\\beta$-deformed super-matrix integrals. We show that for a given model\nthere exists an infinite number of such differential equations, which we\nidentify as super-quantum curves, and which are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith, and have the structure of, super-Virasoro singular vectors. We discuss\npotential applications of super-quantum curves and prospects of other\ngeneralizations.\n", "  We consider how active forces modeled as non-thermal random noise affect the\naverage dynamical properties of a Rouse polymer. As the power spectrum of the\nnoise is not known we keep the analytical treatment as generic as possible and\nthen present results for a few examples of active noise. We discuss the\nconnection between our results and recent experimental studies of dynamics of\nlabeled DNA telomeres in living cells, and propose new chromatin tracking\nexperiments that will allow one to determine the statistical properties of the\nactive forces associated with chromatin remodeling processes.\n", "  We discuss relations between quantum BPS invariants defined in terms of a\nproduct decomposition of certain series, and difference equations (quantum\nA-polynomials) that annihilate such series. We construct combinatorial models\nwhose structure is encoded in the form of such difference equations, and whose\ngenerating functions (Hilbert-Poincar\\'e series) are solutions to those\nequations and reproduce generating series that encode BPS invariants.\nFurthermore, BPS invariants in question are expressed in terms of Lyndon words\nin an appropriate language, thereby relating counting of BPS states to the\nbranch of mathematics referred to as combinatorics on words. We illustrate\nthese results in the framework of colored extremal knot polynomials: among\nothers we determine dual quantum extremal A-polynomials for various knots,\npresent associated combinatorial models, find corresponding BPS invariants\n(extremal Labastida-Mari\\~no-Ooguri-Vafa invariants) and discuss their\nintegrality.\n", "  Suppose that advanced civilizations, separated by a cosmological distance and\ntime, wish to maximize their access to cosmic resources by rapidly expanding\ninto the universe. How does the presence of one limit the expansionistic\nambitions of another, and what sort of boundary forms between their expanding\ndomains? We describe a general scenario for any expansion speed, separation\ndistance, and time. We then specialize to a question of particular interest:\nWhat are the future prospects for a young and ambitious civilization if they\ncan observe the presence of another at a cosmological distance? We treat cases\ninvolving the observation of one or two expanding domains. In the\nsingle-observation case, we find that almost any plausible detection will limit\none's future cosmic expansion to some extent. Also, practical technological\nlimits to expansion speed (well below the speed of light) play an interesting\nrole. If a domain is visible at the time one embarks on cosmic expansion,\nhigher practical limits to expansion speed are beneficial only up to a certain\npoint. Beyond this point, a higher speed limit means that gains in the ability\nto expand are more than offset by the first-mover advantage of the observed\ndomain. In the case of two visible domains, it is possible to be \"trapped\" by\nthem if the practical speed limit is high enough and their angular separation\nin the sky is large enough, i.e. one's expansion in any direction will\nterminate at a boundary with the two visible civilizations. Detection at an\nextreme cosmological distance has surprisingly little mitigating effect on our\nconclusions.\n", "  Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) insulators with a large topologically nontrivial bulk\ngap are crucial for future applications of the QSH effect. Among these, group\nIII-V monolayers and their halides with chair structure (regular hexagonal\nframework, RHF) were widely studied. Using first-principles calculations, we\npropose a new structure model for the functionalized group III-V monolayers,\nwhich consist of rectangular GaBi-X2 (X=I, Br, Cl) monolayers with a distorted\nhexagonal framework (DHF). These structures have a much lower energy than the\nGaBi-X2 monolayers with chair structure. Remarkably, the DHF GaBi-X2 monolayers\nare all QSH insulators, which exhibit sizeable nontrivial band gaps ranging\nfrom 0.17 eV to 0.39 eV. Those band gaps can be widely tuned by applying\ndifferent spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strengths, resulting in a distorted Dirac\ncone.\n", "  We study the dynamical thermoelectric transport in metals subjected to the\nelectron-impurity and the electron-phonon interactions using the memory\nfunction formalism. We introduce a generalized Drude form for the Seebeck\ncoefficient in terms of thermoelectric memory function and calculate the later\nin various temperature and frequency limits. In the zero frequency and high\ntemperature limit, we find that our results are consistent with the\nexperimental findings and with the traditional Boltzmann equation approach. In\nthe low temperature limit, we find that the Seebeck coefficient is quadratic in\ntemperature. In the finite frequency regime, we report new results: In the\nelectron-phonon interaction case, we find that the Seebeck coefficient shows\nfrequency independent behavior both in the high frequency regime ($\\omega \\gg\n\\omega_{D}$, where $\\omega_{D}$ is the Debye frequency) and in the low\nfrequency regime ($\\omega \\ll \\omega_{D}$), whereas in the intermediate\nfrequencies, it is a monotonically increasing function of frequency. In the\ncase of the electron-impurity interaction, first it decays and then after\npassing through a minimum it increases with the increase in frequency and\nsaturates at high frequencies.\n", "  In this paper, we use the Taylor expansion method to solve the LTB metric.\n", "  In most existing theories for iron-based superconductors, spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) has been assumed insignificant. Even though recent experiments have\nrevealed an influence of SOC on the electronic band structure, whether SOC\nfundamentally affects magnetism and superconductivity remains an open question.\nHere we use spin-polarised inelastic neutron scattering to show that collective\nlow-energy spin fluctuations in the orthorhombic (or \"nematic\") phase of FeSe\npossess nearly no in-plane component. Such spin-space anisotropy can only be\ncaused by SOC. It is present over an energy range greater than the\nsuperconducting gap 2$\\Delta _\\mathrm{sc}$ and gets fully inherited in the\nsuperconducting state, resulting in a distinct $c$-axis polarised \"spin\nresonance\". Our result demonstrates the importance of SOC in defining the\nlow-energy spin excitations in FeSe, which helps to elucidate the nearby\nmagnetic instabilities and the debated interplay between spin and orbital\ndegrees of freedom. The prominent role of SOC also implies a possible unusual\nnature of the superconducting state.\n", "  A paradigmatic case of multi-band Mott physics including spin-orbit and\nHund's coupling is realised in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Progress in understanding the\nnature of this Mott insulating phase has been impeded by the lack of knowledge\nabout the low-energy electronic structure. Here we provide -- using\nangle-resolved photoemission electron spectroscopy -- the band structure of the\nparamagnetic insulating phase of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and show how it features several\ndistinct energy scales. Comparison to a simple analysis of atomic multiplets\nprovides a quantitative estimate of the Hund's coupling $J=0.4$ eV.\nFurthermore, the experimental spectra are in good agreement with electronic\nstructure calculations performed with Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. The crystal\nfield stabilisation of the d$_{xy}$ orbital due to $c$-axis contraction is\nshown to be important in explaining the nature of the insulating state. It is\nthus a combination of multiband physics, Coulomb interaction and Hund's\ncoupling that generates the Mott insulating state of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. These\nresults underscore the importance of Hund's coupling in the ruthenates and\nrelated multiband materials.\n", "  We reexamine the invariance of two-photon transition matrix elements and\ncorresponding two-photon Rabi frequencies under the \"gauge\" transformation from\nthe length to the velocity gauge. It is shown that gauge invariance, in the\nmost general sense, only holds at exact resonance, for both one-color as well\nas two-color absorption. The arguments leading to this conclusion are supported\nby analytic calculations which express the matrix elements in terms of\nhypergeometric functions, and ramified by a \"master identity\" which is\nfulfilled by off-diagonal matrix elements of the Schroedinger propagator under\na the transformation from the velocity to the length gauge. The study of the\ngauge dependence of atomic processes highlights subtle connections between the\nconcept of asymptotic states, the gauge transformation of the wave function,\nand infinitesimal damping parameters for perturbations and interaction\nHamiltonians that switch off the terms in the infinite past and future [of the\nform exp(-epsilon * | t |)]. We include a pertinent discussion.\n", "  Early hands-on experiences with the Microsoft Hololens augmented/mixed\nreality device are reported and discussed, with a general aim of exploring\nbasic 3D visualization. A range of usage cases are tested, including data\nvisualization and immersive data spaces, in-situ visualization of 3D models and\nfull scale architectural form visualization. Ultimately, the Hololens is found\nto provide a remarkable tool for moving from traditional visualization of 3D\nobjects on a 2D screen, to fully experiential 3D visualizations embedded in the\nreal world.\n", "  We discuss the possibility to generate in Coulomb-blockade systems steady\nstates that violate detailed balance. This includes both voltage biased and\nnon-biased scenarios. The violation of detailed balance yields that the\ncharge-transfer statistics for electrons tunneling into an island experiencing\nstrong Coulomb interaction is different from the statistics for tunneling out.\nThis can be experimentally tested by time-resolved measurement of the island's\ncharge state. We demonstrate this claim for two model systems.\n", "  High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data reveal\nevidence of a crossover from one-dimensional (1D) to three-dimensional (3D)\nbehavior in the prototypical charge density wave (CDW) material NbSe3. In the\nlow-temperature 3D regime, gaps in the electronic structure are observed due to\ntwo incommensurate CDWs, in agreement with x-ray diffraction and\nelectronic-structure calculations. At higher temperatures we observe a spectral\nweight depletion that approaches the power-law behavior expected in 1D. From\nthe warping of the quasi-1D Fermi surface at low temperatures, we extract the\nenergy scale of the dimensional crossover. This is corroborated by a detailed\nanalysis of the density of states, which reveals a change in dimensional\nbehavior dependent on binding energy. Our results offer an important insight\ninto the dimensionality of excitations in quasi-1D materials.\n", "  This paper presents a novel index in order to characterize error propagation\nin quantum circuits by separating the resultant mixed error state in two\ncomponents: an isotropic component, that quantifies the lack of information,\nand a dis-alignment component, that represents the shift between the current\nstate and the original pure quantum state. The Isotropic Triangle, a graphical\nrepresentation that fits naturally with the proposed index, is also introduced.\nFinally, some examples with the analysis of well-known quantum algorithms\ndegradation are given.\n", "  In the context of noncommutative space-time, we investigate the nucleon\nstructure functions which plays an important role to identify the internal\nstructure of nucleons. We use the corrected vertices and employ new vertices\nthat appear in two approaches of noncommutativity and calculate the proton\nstructure functions in terms of noncommutative tensor \\theta_{\\mu\\nu}. To check\nour result, we plot the nucleon structure function (NSF), F_2(x), and compare\nit with experimental data and the result coming out from the GRV, GJR and CT10\nparametrization models. We show that new vertex which is arising the\nnoncommutativity correction will lead us to better consistency between\ntheoretical result and experimental data for NSF. This consistency would be\nbetter at small values of x-Bjorken variable. To indicate and confirm the\nvalidity of our calculations, we also act conversely and obtain an lower bound\nfor the numerical values of \\Lambda_{NC} scale which are corresponding to the\nrecent reports.\n", "  In the present work, we investigate the electronic transport through a\nT-shape double quantum dot system coupled to two normal leads and to one\nsuperconducting lead. We explore the interplay between Kondo and Andreev states\ndue to proximity effects. We find that Kondo resonance is modified by the\nAndreev bound states, which manifest through Fano antiresonances in the local\ndensity of states of the embedded quantum dot and normal transmission. This\nmeans that there is a correlation between Andreev bound states and Fano\nresonances that is robust under the influence of high electronic correlation.\nWe have also found that the dominant couplings at the quantum dots are\ncharacterized by a crossover region that defines the range where the Fano-Kondo\nand the Andreev-Kondo effect prevail in each quantum dot. Likewise, we find\nthat the interaction between Kondo and Andreev bound states has a notable\ninfluence on the Andreev transport.\n", "  In this paper, we clarify the mechanisms underlying a general phenomenon\npresent in pulse-coupled heterogeneous inhibitory networks: inhibition can\ninduce not only suppression of the neural activity, as expected, but it can\nalso promote neural reactivation. In particular, for globally coupled systems,\nthe number of firing neurons monotonically reduces upon increasing the strength\nof inhibition (neurons' death). However, the random pruning of the connections\nis able to reverse the action of inhibition, i.e. in a sparse network a\nsufficiently strong synaptic strength can surprisingly promote, rather than\ndepress, the activity of the neurons (neurons' rebirth). Thus the number of\nfiring neurons reveals a minimum at some intermediate synaptic strength. We\nshow that this minimum signals a transition from a regime dominated by the\nneurons with higher firing activity to a phase where all neurons are\neffectively sub-threshold and their irregular firing is driven by current\nfluctuations. We explain the origin of the transition by deriving an analytic\nmean field formulation of the problem able to provide the fraction of active\nneurons as well as the first two moments of their firing statistics. The\nintroduction of a synaptic time scale does not modify the main aspects of the\nreported phenomenon. However, for sufficiently slow synapses the transition\nbecomes dramatic, the system passes from a perfectly regular evolution to an\nirregular bursting dynamics. In this latter regime the model provides\npredictions consistent with experimental findings for a specific class of\nneurons, namely the medium spiny neurons in the striatum.\n", "  It is well-known that for usual Schroedinger operators weakly coupled bound\nstates exist in dimensions one and two, whereas in higher dimensions the famous\nCwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum bound holds. We show for a large class of\nSchr\\\"odinger-type operators with general kinetic energies that these two\nphenomena are complementary. In particular, we explicitly get a natural\nsemi-classical type bound on the number of bound states precisely in the\nsituation when weakly coupled bound states exist not.\n", "  The method of differential equations has been proven to be a powerful tool\nfor the computation of multi-loop Feynman integrals appearing in quantum field\ntheory. It has been observed that in many instances a canonical basis can be\nchosen, which drastically simplifies the solution of the differential equation.\nIn this paper, an algorithm is presented that computes the transformation to a\ncanonical basis, starting from some basis that is, for instance, obtained by\nthe usual integration-by-parts reduction techniques. The algorithm requires the\nexistence of a rational transformation to a canonical basis, but is otherwise\ncompletely agnostic about the differential equation. In particular, it is\napplicable to problems involving multiple scales and allows for a rational\ndependence on the dimensional regulator. It is demonstrated that the algorithm\nis suitable for current multi-loop calculations by presenting its successful\napplication to a number of non-trivial examples.\n", "  The right-handed neutrinos within the type-I seesaw mechanism can induce\nlarge radiative corrections to the Higgs mass, and naturalness arguments can\nthen be used to set limits on their mass scale and Yukawa couplings. Driven by\nminimality, we consider the presence of two degenerate right-handed neutrinos.\nWe compare the limits from naturalness with the ones from the stability of the\nelectroweak vacuum and from lepton flavor violation. Implications from\nneutrinoless double beta decay are also discussed and renormalization effects\nfor the light neutrino parameters are presented. Adding small perturbations to\nthe degenerate heavy neutrino spectrum allows for successful leptogenesis.\n", "  Based on first-principles calculations, we reported that external pressure\ncan induce topological phase transition in alkaline-earth hexaborides, XB6\n(X=Ca, Sr, Ba). It was revealed that XB6 is transformed from trivial\nsemiconductors to topological node-line semimetals under moderate pressures\nwhen spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is ignored. The band inversion between B px (pz)\nand py orbitals at X point is responsible for the formation of node-line\nsemimetals. Three node-line rings around X point are protected by the\ncombination of the time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetries, and the\ndrumhead surface bands are obtained in the interiors of the projected node-line\nrings. When SOC is included, tiny gaps (< 4.8 meV) open at the crossing lines,\nand the XB6 becomes strong topological insulators with Z2 indices (1;111). As\nthe SOC-induced gap opening is negligible, our findings thus suggest ideal real\nsystems for experimental exploration of the fundamental physics of topological\nnode-line semimetals.\n", "  The search for topological superconductors and non-Abelian Majorana modes\nranks among the most fascinating topics in condensed matter physics. There now\nexist several fundamental superconducting phases which host symmetry protected\nor chiral Majorana modes. The latter, namely the chiral Majorana modes are\nprotected by Chern numbers in even dimensions. Here we propose to observe novel\nchiral Majorana modes by realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, i.e.\nthe pairing density wave (PDW) phase in a Weyl semimetal which breaks\ntime-reversal symmetry. Without symmetry protection, the 3D gapped PDW phase is\ntopologically trivial. However, a vortex line generated in such phase can host\nchiral Majorana modes, which are shown to be protected by an emergent second\nChern number of a synthetic 4D space generalized from the PDW phase. We further\nshow that these chiral modes in the vortex rings obey 3D non-Abelian\nloop-braiding statistics, which can be applied to topological quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  In this paper, we continue our study of form factors and correlation\nfunctions of gauge-invariant local composite operators in the twistor-space\nformulation of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Using the vertices for these\noperators obtained in our recent papers arXiv:1603.04471 and arXiv:1604.00012,\nwe show how to calculate the twistor-space diagrams for general N^kMHV form\nfactors via the inverse soft limit, in analogy to the amplitude case. For\ngeneral operators without $\\dot\\alpha$ indices, we then reexpress the NMHV form\nfactors from the position-twistor calculation in terms of momentum twistors,\nderiving and expanding on a relation between the two twistor formalisms\npreviously observed in the case of amplitudes. Furthermore, we discuss the\ncalculation of generalized form factors and correlation functions as well as\nthe extension to loop level, in particular providing an argument promised in\narXiv:1410.6310.\n", "  Almheiri, Dong, and Harlow [arXiv:1411.7041] proposed a highly illuminating\nconnection between the AdS/CFT holographic correspondence and operator algebra\nquantum error correction (OAQEC). Here we explore this connection further. We\nderive some general results about OAQEC, as well as results that apply\nspecifically to quantum codes which admit a holographic interpretation. We\nintroduce a new quantity called `price', which characterizes the support of a\nprotected logical system, and find constraints on the price and the distance\nfor logical subalgebras of quantum codes. We show that holographic codes\ndefined on bulk manifolds with asymptotically negative curvature exhibit\n`uberholography', meaning that a bulk logical algebra can be supported on a\nboundary region with a fractal structure. We argue that, for holographic codes\ndefined on bulk manifolds with asymptotically flat or positive curvature, the\nboundary physics must be highly nonlocal, an observation with potential\nimplications for black holes and for quantum gravity in AdS space at distance\nscales small compared to the AdS curvature radius.\n", "  Measuring centrality in a social network, especially in bipartite mode, poses\nseveral challenges such as requirement of full knowledge of the network\ntopology and lack of properly detection of top-k behavioral representative\nusers. In this paper, to overcome the aforementioned challenging issues, we\npropose an accurate centrality measure, called HellRank, to identify central\nnodes in bipartite social networks. HellRank is based on the Hellinger distance\nbetween two nodes on the same side of a bipartite network. We theoretically\nanalyze the impact of the Hellinger distance on a bipartite network and find an\nupper and lower bounds for this distance. The computation of HellRank\ncentrality measure can be distributed by letting each node uses only local\ninformation on its immediate neighbors and therefore do not need a central\nentity to have full knowledge of the network topological structure. We\nexperimentally evaluate performance of the HellRank measure in correlation with\nother centrality measures on real-world networks. The results show partial\nranking similarity between the HellRank and the other conventional metrics\naccording to the Kendall and Spearman rank correlation coefficient.\n", "  We apply Quantum Monte Carlo technique to analyze the non equlibrium state of\na trapped 1d Bose gas just after the quenching of the confining potential. As a\nmatter of fact we solve the time dependent Schroedinger equation for the system\nof one-dimensional bosons interacting via delta potential in an infinite square\nwell (namely Lieb-Liniger model) using Feynman-Kac path integral Monte Carlo\ntechnique. These 1d systems are extremely interesting and worth investigating\nin the context of non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting many body systems.\nEven though the systems can be realized experimentally and are exactly solvable\nby Bethe Ansatz, the diffusion Monte Carlo is proven to be more efficient in\nmost circumstances than other mean value techniques as the numerical method can\nincorporate the finite interaction very easily. Using N particle ground state\nwavefunction for one-dimensional hard core bosons in a harmonic trap, we\ndevelop an algorithm to calculate density. We also observe the change in the\ndensity distribution by changing the length of the hard wall box. After an\nincrease in the box length, we still get a self-similar density distribution.\n", "  Invariant ensembles of random matrices are characterized by the distribution\nof their eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_N\\}$. We study the\ndistribution of truncated linear statistics of the form $\\tilde{L}=\\sum_{i=1}^p\nf(\\lambda_i)$ with $p<N$. This problem has been considered by us in a previous\npaper when the $p$ eigenvalues are further constrained to be the largest ones\n(or the smallest). In this second paper we consider the same problem without\nthis restriction which leads to a rather different analysis. We introduce a new\nensemble which is related, but not equivalent, to the \"thinned ensembles\"\nintroduced by Bohigas and Pato. This question is motivated by the study of\npartial sums of proper time delays in chaotic quantum dots, which are\ncharacteristic times of the scattering process. Using the Coulomb gas\ntechnique, we derive the large deviation function for $\\tilde{L}$. Large\ndeviations of linear statistics $L=\\sum_{i=1}^N f(\\lambda_i)$ are usually\ndominated by the energy of the Coulomb gas, which scales as $\\sim N^2$,\nimplying that the relative fluctuations are of order $1/N$. For the truncated\nlinear statistics considered here, there is a whole region (including the\ntypical fluctuations region), where the energy of the Coulomb gas is frozen and\nthe large deviation function is purely controlled by an entropic effect.\nBecause the entropy scales as $\\sim N$, the relative fluctuations are of order\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$. Our analysis relies on the mapping on a problem of $p$ fictitious\nnon-interacting fermions in $N$ energy levels, which can exhibit both positive\nand negative effective (absolute) temperatures. We determine the large\ndeviation function characterizing the distribution of the truncated linear\nstatistics, and show that, for the case considered here\n($f(\\lambda)=1/\\lambda$), the corresponding phase diagram is separated in three\ndifferent phases.\n", "  The massless fermions of a Weyl semimetal come in two species of opposite\nchirality, in two cones of the band structure. As a consequence, the current\n$j$ induced in one Weyl cone by a magnetic field $B$ (the chiral magnetic\neffect, CME) is cancelled in equilibrium by an opposite current in the other\ncone. Here we show that superconductivity offers a way to avoid this\ncancellation, by means of a flux bias that gaps out a Weyl cone jointly with\nits particle-hole conjugate. The remaining gapless Weyl cone and its\nparticle-hole conjugate represent a single fermionic species, with renormalized\ncharge $e^\\ast$ and a single chirality $\\pm$ set by the sign of the flux bias.\nAs a consequence, the CME is no longer cancelled in equilibrium but appears as\na supercurrent response $\\partial j/\\partial B=\\pm(e^\\ast e/h^2)\\mu$ along the\nmagnetic field at chemical potential $\\mu$.\n", "  Dark matter (DM) charged under a dark U(1) force appears in many extensions\nof the Standard Model, and has been invoked to explain anomalies in cosmic-ray\ndata, as well as a self-interacting DM candidate. In this paper, we perform a\ncomprehensive phenomenological analysis of such a model, assuming that the DM\nabundance arises from the thermal freeze-out of the dark interactions. We\ninclude, for the first time, bound-state effects both in the DM production and\nin the indirect detection signals, and quantify their importance for Fermi,\nAMS, and CMB experiments. We find that DM in the mass range 1 GeV to 100 TeV,\nannihilating into dark photons of MeV to GeV mass, is in conflict with\nobservations. Instead, DM annihilation into heavier dark photons is viable. We\npoint out that the late decays of multi-GeV dark photons can produce\nsignificant entropy and thus dilute the DM density. This can lower considerably\nthe dark coupling needed to obtain the DM abundance, and in turn relax the\nexisting constraints.\n", "  In this paper, we show that the zero-knowledge construction for Hamiltonian\ncycle remains secure against quantum adversaries in the relativistic setting.\nOur main technical contribution is a tool for studying the action of\nconsecutive measurements on a quantum state which in turn gives upper bounds on\nthe value of some entangled games. This allows us to prove the security of our\nprotocol against quantum adversaries. We also prove security bounds for the\n(single-round) relativistic string commitment and bit commitment in parallel\nagainst quantum adversaries. As an additional consequence of our result, we\nanswer an open question from [Unr12] and show tight bounds on the quantum\nknowledge error of some $\\Sigma$-protocols.\n", "  In the framework of density functional theory (DFT) calculations we\ninvestigate the electronic and thermal properties of porous graphene (PG)\nstructures passivated with halogen atoms as possible candidates for efficient\nthermoelectric devices. Armchair and zig-zag halogenated PG nanoribbons are\nanalyzed comparatively. The electronic properties are consistent with the\nexpected behavior for the two types of terminations, however with marked\ninfluences introduced by the different halogen atoms. Depending on the pore\nsizes and halogen type pseudo-gaps in the phononic band structure are visible\nin the low frequency range, which are particularly important for the thermal\nconduction at low temperatures. The gaps are systematically displaced towards\nlower energies as the atomic number of the halogen increases. At the same time,\nthe electronic gap decreases, which is also essential for attaining a large\nfigure of merit in a thermoelectric device. This indicates the possibility of\ntuning both electronic and thermal properties of PG structures by halogen\npassivation.\n", "  Astronomical observations reveal hierarchical structures in the Universe,\nfrom galaxies, groups of galaxies, clusters and superclusters, to filaments and\nvoids. On the largest scales it seems that some kind of statistical homogeneity\ncan be observed. As a result, modern cosmological models are based on spatially\nhomogeneous and isotropic solutions of the Einstein equations, and the\nevolution of the universe is approximated by the Friedmann equations. In\nparallel to standard homogeneous cosmology, the field of inhomogeneous\ncosmology and backreaction is being developed. This field investigates whether\nsmall scale inhomogeneities via non-linear effects can backreact and alter the\nproperties of the Universe on its largest scales, leading to a non-Friedmannian\nevolution. This paper presents the current status of inhomogeneous cosmology\nand backreaction. It also discusses future prospects of the field of\ninhomogeneous cosmology, which is based on a survey of 50 academics working in\nthe field of inhomogeneous cosmology.\n", "  Typically higher-derivative theories are unstable. Instabilities manifest\nthemselves from extra propagating degrees of freedom, which are unphysical. In\nthis paper, we will investigate an infinite derivative field theory and study\nits true dynamical degrees of freedom via Hamiltonian analysis. In particular,\nwe will show that if the infinite derivatives can be captured by a Gaussian\nkinetic term, i.e. exponential of entire function, then it is possible to prove\nthat there are only finite number of dynamical degrees of freedom. We will\nfurther extend our investigation into infinite derivative theory of gravity,\nand in particular concentrate on ghost free and singularity free theory of\ngravity, which has been studied extensively in the Lagrangian approach. Here we\nwill show from the Hamiltonian perspective that there are only finite number of\ndegrees of freedom.\n", "  The c_2 invariant, defined by Schnetz in 2011, is an arithmetic graph\ninvariant created towards a better understanding of Feynman integrals. This\npaper looks at some graph families of interest, with a focus on decompleted\ntoroidal grids. Specifically, the c_2 invariant for p=2 is shown to be zero for\nall decompleted non-skew toroidal grids. We also calculate the c_2 invariant at\np=2 for G a family of graphs called X-ladders. Finally, we show these methods\ncan be applied to any graph with a recursive structure, for any fixed p.\n", "  A coupled-wave model is developed for photonic-crystal quantum cascade\nlasers. The analytical model provides an efficient analysis of full\nthree-dimensional large-area device structure, and the validity is confirmed\nvia simulations and previous experimental results.\n", "  Large field excursions are required in a number of axion models of inflation.\nThese models also possess global cosmic strings, around which the axion follows\na path mirroring the inflationary trajectory. Cosmic strings are thus an\ninteresting theoretical laboratory for the study of transplanckian field\nexcursions. We describe connections between various effective field theory\nmodels of axion monodromy and study the classical spacetimes around their\nsupercritical cosmic strings. For small decay constants $f<M_p$ and large\nwinding numbers $n>M_p/f$, the EFT is under control and the string cores\nundergo topological inflation, which may be either of exponential or power-law\ntype. We show that the exterior spacetime is nonsingular and equivalent to a\ndecompactifying cigar geometry, with the radion rolling in a potential\ngenerated by axion flux. Signals are able to circumnavigate infinite straight\nstrings in finite but exponentially long time, $t\\sim e^{\\Delta a/M_p}$. For\nfinite loops of supercritical string in asymptotically flat space, we argue\nthat if topological inflation occurs, then topological censorship implies\ntransplanckian censorship, or that external observers are forbidden from\nthreading the loop and observing the full excursion of the axion.\n", "  Spin-dependent Kapitza-Dirac scattering of electron beams from\ncounterpropagating bichromatic laser waves in various polarization geometries\nis studied. The corresponding scattering probabilities are obtained by\nanalytical and numerical solutions of the time-dependent Dirac equation,\nassuming a field frequency ratio of 2. When the fundamental field mode is\ncircular-polarized, we show that spin dynamics are generally suppressed at low\nintensities, but can become distinct at high intensities. Conversely, when a\nlinearly or elliptically polarized fundamental mode is combined with a second\nharmonic of circular polarization, strong spin effects arise already at low\nfield intensities. In particular, a polarization configuration is identified\nwhich acts as a spin filter for free electrons.\n", "  The $[SU(3)]^4$ quartification model of Babu, Ma, and Willenbrock (BMW),\nproposed in 2003, predicts a confining leptonic color $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry,\nwhich becomes strong at the keV scale. It also predicts the existence of three\nfamilies of half-charged leptons (hemions) below the TeV scale. These hemions\nare confined to form bound states which are not so easy to discover at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC). However, just as $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ appeared\nas sharp resonances in $e^-e^+$ colliders of the 20th century, the\ncorresponding 'hemionium' states are expected at a future $e^-e^+$ collider of\nthe 21st century.\n", "  High precision and long-lasting \\emph{Kepler} data enabled us to estimate\nstellar properties with asteroseismology as an accurate tool. We performed\nasteroseismic analysis on six solar-like stars observed by the \\emph{Kepler}\nmission: KIC 6064910, KIC 6766513, KIC 7107778, KIC 10079226, KIC 10147635 and\nKIC 12069127. The extraction of seismic information includes two parts. First,\nwe obtained two global asteroseismic parameters, mean large separation\n$\\Delta\\nu$ and frequency of maximum power $\\nu_{\\rm{max}}$, with\nautocorrelation function and collapsed autocorrelation function. Second, we\nextracted individual oscillation modes $\\nu_{nl}$ with low-$l$ degree using a\nleast-squares fit. Stellar grid models were built with Yale Rotating Stellar\nEvolution Code (YREC) to analyze stellar properties. They covered the range of\n$M=0.8\\sim1.8$ $M_{\\odot}$ with a step of 0.02 $M_{\\odot}$ and\n$\\rm{[Fe/H]}=-0.3\\sim0.4$ $\\rm{dex}$ with a step of 0.1 $\\rm{dex}$. We used a\nBayesian approach to estimate stellar fundamental parameters of the six stars,\nunder the constraints of asteroseismic parameters ($\\Delta\\nu$,\n$\\nu_{\\rm{max}}$) and non-asteroseismic parameters ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$,\n$\\rm{[Fe/H]}$). We discover that the six targets include five sub-giant stars\nwith $1.2\\sim1.5$ $M_{\\odot}$ and one main-sequence star with $1.08M_{\\odot}$,\nand with ages in the range of $3\\sim5$ $\\rm{Gyr}$.\n", "  Models with spontaneously broken global lepton number can lead to a\npseudo-Goldstone boson as a long-lived dark matter candidate. Here we revisit\nthe case of singlet majoron dark matter and discuss multiple constraints. For\nmasses above MeV, this model could lead to a detectable flux of monochromatic\nmass-eigenstate neutrinos, which have flavor ratios that depend strongly on the\nneutrino mass hierarchy. We provide a convenient parametrization for the\nloop-induced majoron couplings to charged fermions that allows us to discuss\nthree-generation effects such as lepton flavor violation. These couplings are\nindependent of the low-energy neutrino parameters but can be constrained by the\nmajoron decays into charged fermions.\n", "  Manganese monophosphide (MnP) shows complicated magnetic states varying with\nboth temperature and pressure. We calculate the magnetic and electronic\nstructures of MnP at different pressures using first-principles methods and\nobtain spiral ground states whose propagation vector changes from the c-axis at\nlow pressure to the b-axis at high pressure. In between, we find a\nferromagnetic state, as observed in the experimental phase diagram. The\npropagation vector of the spiral states is found to vary nonmonotonically with\npressure, consistent with neutron measurements. Our results indicate that the\ncomplicated magnetic phase diagram originates from a delicate competition\nbetween neighboring exchange interactions between the Mn-ions. At all\npressures, the electronic structures indicate the existence of\nquasi-one-dimensional charge carriers, which appear in the ferromagnetic state\nand become gapped in the spiral state, and anisotropic three-dimensional charge\ncarriers. We argue that this two-fluid behavior originates from the special\ncrystal structure of MnP and may be relevant for understanding the pairing\nmechanism of the superconductivity at the border of the high pressure spiral\nphase.\n", "  We analyze two minimal supersymmetric constrained models with low-energy\nvector-like matter preserving gauge coupling unification. In one we add to the\nMSSM spectrum a pair of 5-plets of SU(5), in the other a pair of 10-plets. We\nshow that the muon g-2 anomaly can be explained in these models while retaining\nperturbativity up to the unification scale, satisfying electroweak and flavor\nprecision tests and current LHC data. We examine also some related\nphenomenological features of the models, including Higgs mass, fine-tuning,\ndark matter and several LHC signatures. We stress that, at least for the 5-plet\nmodel, the parameter space consistent with g-2 is entirely in reach of the LHC\nwith a moderate increase in luminosity with respect the current data set.\n", "  We study the Kitaev chain under generalized twisted boundary conditions, for\nwhich both the amplitudes and the phases of the boundary couplings can be tuned\nat will. We explicitly show the presence of exact zero modes for large chains\nbelonging to the topological phase in the most general case, in spite of the\nabsence of \"edges\" in the system. For specific values of the phase parameters,\nwe rigorously obtain the condition for the presence of the exact zero modes in\nfinite chains, and show that the zero modes obtained are indeed localized. The\nfull spectrum of the twisted chains with zero chemical potential is\nanalytically presented. Finally, we demonstrate the persistence of zero modes\n(level crossing) even in the presence of disorder or interactions.\n", "  A new approach for characterizing the dislocation microstructure obtained\nfrom atomistic simulations is introduced, which relies on converting properties\nof discrete lines to continuous data. This data is represented by a number of\ndensity and density-like field variables containing detailed information about\nproperties of the dislocation microstructure. Applying this methodology to\natomistic simulations of nanoscratching in iron reveals a pronounced \"length\nscale effect\": With increasing scratching length the number of dislocations\nincreases but the density of geometrically necessary dislocations remains\nconstant resulting in decreasing shear stress. During scratching dislocations\nare mostly generated at the scratch front. The nucleation rate versus\nscratching length has an approximately antisymmetric shape with respect to the\nscratch front leading to an almost constant curvature.\n", "  Heavy ion collisions (HIC) at high energies are excellent ways for producing\nheavy hadrons and composite particles. With upgraded detectors at RHIC and LHC,\nit has become possible to measure hadrons beyond their ground states.\nTherefore, HIC provide a new method for studying exotic hadrons that are either\nhadronic molecular states or compact multiquark systems. Because their\nstructures are related to the fundamental properties of QCD, studying exotic\nhadrons is currently one of the most active areas of research in hadron\nphysics. Experiments carried out at various accelerator facilities have\nindicated that some exotic hadrons may have already been produced. The present\nreview is a summary of the current understanding of a selected set of exotic\nparticle candidates that can be potentially measured in HIC. It also includes\ndiscussions on the production of exotic hadrons in HIC based on the coalescence\nand statistical models. A more detailed discussion leads to the conclusion that\nthe yield of a hadron is typically an order of magnitude smaller when it is a\ncompact multiquark state than that of an excited hadronic state with normal\nquark numbers and/or a molecular configuration. Attention is also given to some\nof the proposed heavy exotic hadrons that could be produced with sufficient\nabundance in HIC because of the significant numbers of charm and bottom quarks\nproduced at RHIC and LHC, making it possible to study them in these\nexperiments. Further included in the discussion are the general formalism for\nthe coalescence model that involves resonance particles and its implication on\nthe present estimated yield for resonance production. Finally, a review is\ngiven on recent studies to constrain the hadron-hadron interaction through\ncorrelation measurements in HIC and their implications on the interpretation\nand the possible existence of exotic states in hadronic interactions.\n", "  Through the Casimir effect, we obtain a temperature correction to the ground\nstate mass of the Bosonic string. Accordingly, we show that higher than the\ntemperature $\\approx 1/2\\pi $, the Tachyon attain real mass, and also we find\nmassive Graviton for nonzero temperatures. As another consequence, we\ndemonstrate that for temperatures higher than the Hagedorn temperature, the\nstring would find again a Tachyonic state.\n", "  We used the Density Functional formalism, in particular the Scaled Particle\nTheory, applied to a length-polydisperse hard-rectangular fluid to study its\nphase behavior as a function of the mean particle aspect ratio ($\\kappa_0$) and\npolydispersity ($\\Delta_0$). The numerical solutions of the coexistence\nequations were calculated by transforming the original problem with infinite\ndegrees of freedoms to a finite set of equations for the amplitudes of the\nFourier expansion of the moments of the density profiles. We divided the study\ninto two parts: The first one is devoted to the calculation of the phase\ndiagrams in the packing fraction ($\\eta_0$)- $\\kappa_0$ plane for a fixed\n$\\Delta_0$ and selecting parent distribution functions with exponential (the\nSchulz distribution) or Gaussian decays. In the second part we study the phase\nbehavior in the $\\eta_0$-$\\Delta_0$ plane for fixed $\\kappa_0$ while $\\Delta_0$\nis changed. We characterize in detail the orientational ordering of particles\nand the fractionation of different species between the coexisting phases. Also\nwe study the character (second vs. first order) of the Isotropic-Nematic phase\ntransition as a function of polydispersity. We particularly focused on the\nstability of the Tetratic phase as a function of $\\kappa_0$ and $\\Delta_0$. The\nIsotropic-Nematic transition becomes strongly of first order when\npolydispersity is increased: the coexisting gap widens and the location of the\ntricritical point moves to higher values of $\\kappa_0$ while the Tetratic phase\nis slightly destabilized with respect to the Nematic one. The results obtained\nhere can be tested in experiments on shaken monolayers of granular rods.\n", "  We are interested in dynamics of quantum many-body systems under continuous\nobservation, and its physical realizations involving cold atoms in lattices. In\nthe present work we focus on continuous measurement of atomic currents in\nlattice models, including the Hubbard model. We describe a Cavity QED setup,\nwhere measurement of a homodyne current provides a faithful representation of\nthe atomic current as a function of time. We employ the quantum optical\ndescription in terms of a diffusive stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equation to follow\nthe time evolution of the atomic system conditional to observing a given\nhomodyne current trajectory, thus accounting for the competition between the\nHamiltonian evolution and measurement back-action. As an illustration, we\ndiscuss minimal models of atomic dynamics and continuous current measurement on\nrings with synthetic gauge fields, involving both real space and synthetic\ndimension lattices (represented by internal atomic states). Finally, by `not\nreading' the current measurements the time evolution of the atomic system is\ngoverned by a master equation, where - depending on the microscopic details of\nour CQED setups - we effectively engineer a current coupling of our system to a\nquantum reservoir. This provides novel scenarios of dissipative dynamics\ngenerating `dark' pure quantum many-body states.\n", "  Using direct numerical simulations we demonstrate that magnetic helicity\nexhibits a bidirectional turbulent cascade at high but finite magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers. Despite the injection of positive magnetic helicity in the flow, we\nobserve that magnetic helicity of opposite signs is generated between large and\nsmall scales. We explain these observations by carrying out an analysis of the\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations reduced to triad interactions using the Fourier\nhelical decomposition. Within this framework, the direct cascade of positive\nmagnetic helicity arises through triad interactions that are associated with\nsmall scale dynamo action, while the occurrence of negative magnetic helicity\nat large scales is explained through triad interactions that are related to\nstretch-twist-fold dynamics and small scale dynamo action, which compete with\nthe inverse cascade of positive magnetic helicity. Our analytical and numerical\nresults suggest that the direct cascade of magnetic helicity is a finite\nmagnetic Reynolds number $Rm$ effect that will vanish in the limit $Rm \\to\n\\infty$.\n", "  Screened modified gravity (SMG) is a kind of scalar-tensor theory with\nscreening mechanisms, which can suppress the fifth force in dense regions and\nallow theories to evade the solar system and laboratory tests. In this paper,\nwe investigate how the screening mechanisms in SMG affect the gravitational\nradiation damping effects, calculate in detail the rate of the energy loss due\nto the emission of tensor and scalar gravitational radiations, and derive their\ncontributions to the change in the orbital period of the binary system. We find\nthat the scalar radiation depends on the screened parameters and the\npropagation speed of scalar waves, and the scalar dipole radiation dominates\nthe orbital decay of the binary system. For strongly self-gravitating bodies,\nall effects of scalar sector are strongly suppressed by the screening\nmechanisms in SMG. By comparing our results to observations of binary system\nPSR J1738+0333, we place the stringent constraints on the screening mechanisms\nin SMG. As an application of these results, we focus on three specific models\nof SMG (chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton), and derive the constraints on the\nmodel parameters, respectively.\n", "  We investigate strongly correlated non-Abelian plasmas out of equilibrium.\nBased on numerical simulations, we establish a self-similar scaling property\nfor the time evolution of spatial Wilson loops that characterizes a universal\nstate of matter far from equilibrium. Most remarkably, it exhibits a\ngeneralized area law which holds for sufficiently large ratio of spatial area\nand fractional power of time. Performing calculations also for the perturbative\nregime at higher momenta, we are able to characterize the full nonthermal\nscaling properties of SU(2) and SU(3) symmetric plasmas from short to large\ndistance scales in terms of two independent universal exponents and associated\nscaling functions.\n", "  SrTiO$_{3}$, a quantum paraelectric, becomes a metal with a superconducting\ninstability after removal of an extremely small number of oxygen atoms. It\nturns into a ferroelectric upon substitution of a tiny fraction of strontium\natoms with calcium. The two orders may be accidental neighbors or intimately\nconnected, as in the picture of quantum critical ferroelectricity. Here, we\nshow that in Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_{3-\\delta}$ ($0.002<x<0.009$,\n$\\delta<0.001$) the ferroelectric order coexists with dilute metallicity and\nits superconducting instability in a finite window of doping. At a critical\ncarrier density, which scales with the Ca content, a quantum phase transition\ndestroys the ferroelectric order. We detect an upturn in the normal-state\nscattering and a significant modification of the superconducting dome in the\nvicinity of this quantum phase transition. The enhancement of the\nsuperconducting transition temperature with calcium substitution documents the\nrole played by ferroelectric vicinity in the precocious emergence of\nsuperconductivity in this system, restricting possible theoretical scenarios\nfor pairing.\n", "  The condition for stationary engines to attain the Carnot efficiency in and\nbeyond the linear response regime is investigated. We find that this condition\nfor finite-size engines is significantly different from that for macroscopic\nengines in the thermodynamic limit. For the case of finite-size engines, the\ntight-coupling condition in the linear response regime directly implies the\nattainability of the Carnot efficiency beyond the linear response regime.\nContrary to this, for the case of macroscopic engines in the thermodynamic\nlimit, there are three types of mechanisms to attain the Carnot efficiency. One\nmechanism allows engines to attain the Carnot efficiency only in the linear\nresponse limit, while other two mechanisms enable engines to attain the Carnot\nefficiency beyond the linear response regime. These three mechanisms are\nclassified by introducing tight-coupling window.\n", "  The TRAPPIST-1 system is the first transiting planet system found orbiting an\nultra-cool dwarf star. At least seven planets similar to Earth in radius and in\nmass were previously found to transit this host star. Subsequently, TRAPPIST-1\nwas observed as part of the K2 mission and, with these new data, we report the\nmeasurement of an 18.77 d orbital period for the outermost planet, TRAPPIST-1h,\nwhich was unconstrained until now. This value matches our theoretical\nexpectations based on Laplace relations and places TRAPPIST-1h as the seventh\nmember of a complex chain, with three-body resonances linking every member. We\nfind that TRAPPIST-1h has a radius of 0.727 Earth radii and an equilibrium\ntemperature of 173 K. We have also measured the rotational period of the star\nat 3.3 d and detected a number of flares consistent with a low-activity,\nmiddle-aged, late M dwarf.\n", "  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shifts, if stripped off their uncertainties,\nmust hold key information about the electronic fluid in the cuprates. The early\nshift interpretation that favored a single-fluid scenario will be reviewed, as\nwell as recent experiments that reported its failure. Thereafter, based on\nliterature shift data for planar Cu a contrasting shift phenomenology for\ncuprate superconductors is developed, which is very different from the early\nview while being in agreement with all published data. For example, it will be\nshown that the hitherto used hyperfine scenario is inadequate as a large\nisotropic shift component is discovered. Furthermore, the changes of the\ntemperature dependences of the shifts above and below the superconducting\ntransitions temperature proceed according to a few rules that were not\ndiscussed before. It appears that there can be substantial spin shift at the\nlowest temperature if the magnetic field lies in the CuO$_2$ plane, which\npoints to a localization of spin in the $3d(x^2-y^2)$ orbital. A simple model\nis presented based on the most fundamental findings. The analysis must have new\nconsequences for theory of the cuprates.\n", "  Neurons in the intact brain receive a continuous and irregular synaptic\nbombardment from excitatory and inhibitory pre-synaptic neurons, which\ndetermines the firing activity of the stimulated neuron. In order to\ninvestigate the influence of inhibitory stimulation on the firing time\nstatistics, we consider Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons subject to inhibitory\ninstantaneous post-synaptic potentials. In particular, we report exact results\nfor the firing rate, the coefficient of variation and the spike train spectrum\nfor various synaptic weight distributions. Our results are not limited to\nstimulations of infinitesimal amplitude, but they apply as well to finite\namplitude post-synaptic potentials, thus being able to capture the effect of\nrare and large spikes. The developed methods are able to reproduce also the\naverage firing properties of heterogeneous neuronal populations.\n", "  We discuss the phenomenology of right-handed charged currents in the\nframework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, in which they arise due\nto a single gauge-invariant dimension-six operator. We study the manifestations\nof the nine complex couplings of the $W$ to right-handed quarks in collider\nphysics, flavor physics, and low-energy precision measurements. We first obtain\nconstraints on the couplings under the assumption that the right-handed\noperator is the dominant correction to the Standard Model at observable\nenergies. We subsequently study the impact of degeneracies with other\nBeyond-the-Standard-Model effective interactions and identify observables, both\nat colliders and low-energy experiments, that would uniquely point to\nright-handed charged currents.\n", "  Starting from the quasiparticle random phase approximation based on the\nSkyrme interaction SLy5, we study the effects of phonon-phonon coupling~(PPC)\non the low-energy electric dipole response in $^{40-58}$Ca. Using the same set\nof parameters we describe available experimental data for $^{40,44,48}$Ca and\ngive prediction for $^{50-58}$Ca. The inclusion of the PPC results in the\nformation of low-energy $1^-$ states. There is an impact of the PPC effect on\nlow-energy $E1$~strength of $^{40,44,48}$Ca. The PPC effect on the electric\ndipole polarizability is discussed. We predict a strong increase of the summed\n$E1$~strength below 10MeV, with increasing neutron number from $^{48}$Ca till\n$^{58}$Ca.\n", "  We present a new method for torque magnetometry by using a commercially\navailable membrane-type surface-stress sensor (MSS). This sensor has a silicon\nmembrane supported by four beams in which piezoresistive paths are integrated.\nAlthough originally developed as a gas sensor, it can be used for torque\nmeasurement by modifying its on-chip wiring. We demonstrate the magnetic-torque\nmeasurement of submillimeter-sized crystals at a low temperature and in strong\nmagnetic fields. This MSS can observe de-Haas-van-Alphen oscillation, which\nconfirms that it can be an alternative tool for self-sensitive\nmicrocantilevers.\n", "  On a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary having positive mean\ncurvature, a fundamental result of Shi and Tam states that, if the manifold has\nnonnegative scalar curvature and if the boundary is isometric to a strictly\nconvex hypersurface in the Euclidean space, then the total mean curvature of\nthe boundary is no greater than the total mean curvature of the corresponding\nEuclidean hypersurface. In $3$-dimension, Shi-Tam's result is known to be\nequivalent to the Riemannian positive mass theorem.\n  In this paper, we provide a supplement to Shi-Tam's result by including the\neffect of minimal hypersurfaces on the boundary. More precisely, given a\ncompact manifold $\\Omega$ with nonnegative scalar curvature, assuming its\nboundary consists of two parts, $\\Sigma_h$ and $\\Sigma_o$, where $\\Sigma_h$ is\nthe union of all closed minimal hypersurfaces in $\\Omega$ and $\\Sigma_o$ is\nisometric to a suitable $2$-convex hypersurface $\\Sigma$ in a spatial\nSchwarzschild manifold of positive mass $m$, we establish an inequality\nrelating $m$, the area of $\\Sigma_h$, and two weighted total mean curvatures of\n$\\Sigma_o$ and $ \\Sigma$. In $3$-dimension, the inequality has implications to\nboth isometric embedding and quasi-local mass problems. In a relativistic\ncontext, our result can be interpreted as a quasi-local mass type quantity of $\n\\Sigma_o$ being greater than or equal to the Hawking mass of $\\Sigma_h$. We\nfurther analyze the limit of such quasi-local mass quantity associated with\nsuitably chosen isometric embeddings of large coordinate spheres of an\nasymptotically flat $3$-manifold $M$ into a spatial Schwarzschild manifold. We\nshow that the limit equals the ADM mass of $M$. It follows that our result on\nthe compact manifold $\\Omega$ is equivalent to the Riemannian Penrose\ninequality.\n", "  We present transport measurements on a lateral p-n junction in an inverted\nInAs/GaSb double quantum well at zero and nonzero perpendicular magnetic\nfields. At a zero magnetic field, the junction exhibits diodelike behavior in\naccordance with the presence of a hybridization gap. With an increasing\nmagnetic field, we explore the quantum Hall regime where spin-polarized edge\nstates with the same chirality are either reflected or transmitted at the\njunction, whereas those of opposite chirality undergo a mixing process, leading\nto full equilibration along the width of the junction independent of spin.\nThese results lay the foundations for using p-n junctions in InAs/GaSb double\nquantum wells to probe the transition between the topological quantum spin Hall\nand quantum Hall states.\n", "  We use new X-ray data obtained with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array\n(NuSTAR), near-infrared (NIR) fluxes, and mid-infrared (MIR) spectra of a\nsample of 24 unobscured type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) to study the\ncorrelation between various hard X-ray bands between 3 and 80 keV and the\ninfrared (IR) emission. The IR to X-ray correlation spectrum (IRXCS) shows a\nmaximum at ~15-20 micron, coincident with the peak of the AGN contribution to\nthe MIR spectra of the majority of the sample. There is also a NIR correlation\npeak at ~2 micron, which we associate with the NIR bump observed in some type 1\nAGN at ~1-5 micron and is likely produced by nuclear hot dust emission. The\nIRXCS shows practically the same behaviour in all the X-ray bands considered,\nindicating a common origin for all of them. We finally evaluated correlations\nbetween the X-ray luminosities and various MIR emission lines. All the lines\nshow a good correlation with the hard X-rays (rho>0.7), but we do not find the\nexpected correlation between their ionization potentials and the strength of\nthe IRXCS.\n", "  We study a large number of physically-plausible arrangements of chromophores,\ngenerated via a computational method involving stochastic real-space\ntransformations of a naturally occurring `reference' structure, illustrating\nour methodology using the well-studied Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex (FMO). To\nexplore the idea that the natural structure has been tuned for efficient energy\ntransport we use an atomic transition charge method to calculate the excitonic\ncouplings of each generated structure and a Lindblad master equation to study\nthe quantum transport of an exciton from a `source' to a `drain' chromophore.\nWe find significant correlations between structure and transport efficiency:\nHigh-performing structures tend to be more compact and, among those, the best\nstructures display a certain orientation of the chromophores, particularly the\nchromophore closest to the source-to-drain vector. We conclude that, subject to\nreasonable, physically-motivated constraints, the FMO complex is highly attuned\nto the purpose of energy transport, partly by exploiting these structural\nmotifs.\n", "  In this article, we assign the $\\Omega_c(3000)$, $\\Omega_c(3050)$,\n$\\Omega_c(3066)$, $\\Omega_c(3090)$ and $\\Omega_c(3119)$ to be the P-wave baryon\nstates with $J^P={\\frac{1}{2}}^-$, ${\\frac{1}{2}}^-$, ${\\frac{3}{2}}^-$,\n${\\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and ${\\frac{5}{2}}^-$, respectively, and study them with the\nQCD sum rules by introducing an explicit relative P-wave between the two $s$\nquarks. The predictions support assigning the $\\Omega_c(3050)$,\n$\\Omega_c(3066)$, $\\Omega_c(3090)$ and $\\Omega_c(3119)$ to be the P-wave baryon\nstates with $J^P={\\frac{1}{2}}^-$, ${\\frac{3}{2}}^-$, ${\\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and\n${\\frac{5}{2}}^-$, respectively, where the two $s$ quarks are in relative\nP-wave; while the $\\Omega_c(3000)$ can be assigned to the P-wave baryon state\nwith $J^{P}={\\frac{1}{2}}^-$, where the two $s$ quarks are in relative S-wave.\n", "  The replacement of the Poincar\\'e-invariant Einstein special relativity by a\nde Sitter-invariant special relativity produces concomitant changes in all\nrelativistic theories, including general relativity. A crucial change in the\nlatter is that both the background de Sitter curvature and the gravitational\ndynamical curvature turns out to be included in a single curvature tensor. This\nmeans that the cosmological term no longer explicitly appears in Einstein\nequation, and is consequently not restricted to be constant. In this paper, the\nNewtonian limit of such theory is obtained, and the ensuing Newtonian Friedmann\nequations are show to provide a good account of the dark energy content of the\npresent-day universe.\n", "  In the era of large stellar spectroscopic surveys, there is emphasis on\nderiving not only stellar abundances but also ages for millions of stars. In\nthe context of Galactic archeology, stellar ages provide a direct probe of the\nformation history of the Galaxy. We use the stellar evolution code MESA to\ncompute models with atomic diffusion--with and without radiative\nacceleration--and extra mixing in the surface layers. The extra mixing consists\nof both density-dependent turbulent mixing and envelope overshoot mixing. Based\non these models we argue that it is important to distinguish between initial,\nbulk abundances (parameters) and current, surface abundances (variables) in the\nanalysis of individual stellar ages. In stars that maintain radiative regions\non evolutionary timescales, atomic diffusion modifies the surface abundances.\nWe show that when initial, bulk metallicity is equated with current, surface\nmetallicity in isochrone age analysis the resulting stellar ages can be\nsystematically over-estimated by up to 20%. The change of surface abundances\nwith evolutionary phase also complicates chemical tagging, the concept that\ndispersed star clusters can be identified through unique, high-dimensional\nchemical signatures. Stars from the same cluster, but in different evolutionary\nphases, will show different surface abundances. We speculate that calibration\nof stellar models may allow us to estimate not only stellar ages but also\ninitial abundances for individual stars. In the meantime, analyzing the\nchemical properties of stars in similar evolutionary phases is essential to\nminimize the effects of atomic diffusion in the context of chemical tagging.\n", "  We examine kinematic dynamo action driven by an axisymmetric large scale flow\nthat is superimposed with an azimuthally propagating non-axisymmetric\nperturbation with a frequency $\\omega$. Although we apply a rather simple large\nscale velocity field, our simulations exhibit a complex behavior with\noscillating and azimuthally drifting eigenmodes as well as stationary regimes.\nWithin these non-oscillating regimes we find parametric resonances\ncharacterized by a considerable enhancement of dynamo action and by a locking\nof the phase of the magnetic field to the pattern of the perturbation. We find\nan approximate fulfillment of the relationship between the resonant frequency\n$\\omega_{\\rm{res}}$ of the disturbed system and the eigenfrequency $\\omega_0$\nof the undisturbed system given by $\\omega_{\\rm{res}}=2\\omega_0$ which is known\nfrom paradigmatic rotating mechanical systems and our prior study [Giesecke et\nal., Phys. Rev. E, 86, 066303 (2012)]. We find further -- broader -- regimes\nwith weaker enhancement of the growth rates but without phase locking. However,\nthis amplification regime arises only in case of a basic (i.e. unperturbed)\nstate consisting of several different eigenmodes with rather close growth\nrates. Qualitatively, these observations can be explained in terms of a simple\nlow dimensional model for the magnetic field amplitude that is derived using\nFloquet theory. The observed phenomena may be of fundamental importance in\nplanetary dynamo models with the base flow being disturbed by periodic external\nforces like precession or tides and for the realization of dynamo action under\nlaboratory conditions where imposed perturbations with the appropriate\nfrequency might facilitate the occurrence of dynamo action.\n", "  The hot-electron vortex flow instability in superconducting films in magnetic\nfield $B$ at substrate temperature $T_0 \\ll T_c$ is theoretically considered in\nthe presence of pinning. The magnetic field dependence of the instability\ncritical parameters (electric field $E^\\ast$, current density $j^\\ast$,\nresistivity $\\rho^\\ast$, power density $P^\\ast$ and vortex velocity $v^\\ast$)\nis derived for a cosine and a saw-tooth washboard pinning potential and\ncompared with the results obtained earlier by M.\\,Kunchur [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{89} (2002) 137005] in the absence of pinning. It is shown that the\n$B$-behavior of $E^\\ast$, $j^\\ast$ and $\\rho^\\ast$ is monotonic in $B$, whereas\nthe $B$-dependence of $v^\\ast$ is quite different, namely $dv^\\ast/dB$ may\nchange its sign twice with decreasing $B$ as it was observed in some\nexperiments. The simplest heat balance equation for electrons in low-$T_c$\nsuperconducting films in the two-fluid approach is considered. It allows one to\nshow that the instability critical temperature $T^\\ast \\approx 5T_c/6$ at $T_0\n< T^\\ast/2$ with $T^\\ast$ independent of $B$.\n", "  We carry out a constructive review of non-standard solutions of relativistic\nwave equations. Such solutions are obtained via splitting of relativistic wave\nequations written in spinor form. All these solutions are also solutions of the\nDirac equation and are non-standard because they involve higher-order spinors.\nThe main finding is that non-standard solutions describe decaying states.\n", "  There is considerable interest in collective effects in hybrid systems formed\nby molecular or atomic ensembles strongly coupled by an electromagnetic\nresonance. For analyzing such collective effects, we develop an efficient and\ngeneral theoretical formalism based on the natural modes of the resonator. The\nmain strength of our approach is its generality and the high level of\nanalyticity enabled by modal analysis, which allows one to model complex hybrid\nsystems without any restriction on the resonator shapes or material properties,\nand to perform statistical computations to predict general properties that are\nrobust to spatial and polarization disorders. Most notably, we establish that\nsuperradiant modes remain even after ensemble averaging and act as an\ninvisibility cloak with a spectral bandwidth that scales with the number of\noscillators and the spatially-averaged Purcell factor.\n", "  We propose a (4+1) dimensional Chern-Simons field theoretical description of\nthe fractional quantum Hall effect. It suggests that composite fermions reside\non a momentum manifold with a nonzero Chern number. Based on derivations from\nmicroscopic wave functions, we further show that the momentum manifold has a\nuniformly distributed Berry curvature. As a result, composite fermions do not\nfollow the ordinary Newtonian dynamics as commonly believed, but the more\ngeneral symplectic one. For a Landau level with the particle-hole symmetry, the\ntheory correctly predicts its Hall conductance at half-filling as well as the\nsymmetry between an electron filling fraction and its hole counterpart.\n", "  In this paper we will consider the ultraviolet (UV) finiteness of the most\ngeneral one-particle irreducible ($1$PI) Feynman diagrams within the context of\nghost-free, infinite-derivative scalar toy model, which is inspired from ghost\nfree and singularity-free infinite-derivative theory of gravity. We will show\nthat by using dressed vertices and dressed propagators, $n$-loop, $N$-point\ndiagrams constructed out of lower-loop $2$- & $3$-point and, in general,\n$N_i$-point diagrams are UV finite with respect to internal and external loop\nmomentum. Moreover, we will demonstrate that the external momentum dependences\nof the $n$-loop, $N$-point diagrams constructed out of lower-loop $2$- &\n$3$-point and, in general, $N_i$-point diagrams decrease exponentially as the\nloop-order increases and the external momentum divergences are eliminated at\nsufficiently high loop-order.\n", "  The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted a great deal of\nattention due to their fascinating physical properties and potential\napplications for future nanoelectronic devices. Since the first isolation of\ngraphene, a Dirac material, a large family of new functional 2D materials have\nbeen discovered and characterized, including insulating 2D boron nitride,\nsemiconducting 2D transition metal dichalcogenides and black phosphorus, and\nsuperconducting 2D bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide, molybdenum\ndisulphide and niobium selenide, etc. Here, we report the identification of\nferromagnetic thin flakes of Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) with thickness down to a few\nnanometers, which provides a very important piece to the van der Waals\nstructures consisting of various 2D materials. We further demonstrate the giant\nmodulation of the channel resistance of 2D CGT devices via electric field\neffect. Our results illustrate the gate voltage tunability of 2D CGT and the\npotential of CGT, a ferromagnetic 2D material, as a new functional quantum\nmaterial for applications in future nanoelectronics and spintronics.\n", "  Liquid Crystal Arrayed Microcavities (LCAM) is a new technology for\nultra-narrow optical filtering (FWHM ~ 0.1 nm) that uses pico-liter volume\nFabry-Perot type optical cavities filled with liquid crystal for tuning. LCAMs\nare sub-nm spectral resolution filters, which utilize well-established laser\nwriting, thin film deposition, and wafer manufacturing techniques. These\nfilters are compact, robust, and inexpensive. Compact, high-resolution optical\nfilters have applications including biomedical imaging, chemical detection, and\nenvironmental monitoring. Here we describe the LCAM design and initial\nperformance metrics.\n", "  The complete lattice-layer entanglement structure of Bernal stacked bilayer\ngraphene is obtained for the quantum system described by a tight-binding\nHamiltonian which includes mass and bias voltage terms. Through a suitable\ncorrespondence with the parity-spin $SU(2)\\otimes SU(2)$ structure of a Dirac\nHamiltonian, when it brings up tensor and pseudovector external field\ninteractions, the lattice-layer degrees of freedom can be mapped into such a\nparity-spin two-qubit basis which supports the interpretation of the bilayer\ngraphene eigenstates as entangled ones in a lattice-layer basis. The Dirac\nHamiltonian mapping structure simply provides the tools for the manipulation of\nthe corresponding eigenstates and eigenenergies of the Bernal-stacked graphene\nquantum system. The quantum correlational content is then quantified by means\nof quantum concurrence, in order to have the influence of mass and bias voltage\nterms quantified, and in order to identify the role of the trigonal warping of\nenergy in the intrinsic entanglement. Our results show that while the mass term\nactively suppresses the intrinsic quantum entanglement of bilayer eigenstates,\nthe bias voltage term spreads the entanglement in the Brillouin zone around the\nDirac points. In addition, the interlayer coupling modifies the symmetry of the\nlattice-layer quantum concurrence around a given Dirac point. It produces some\ndistortion on the quantum entanglement profile which follows the same pattern\nof the isoenergy line distortion in the Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene.\n", "  We study a large family of metric-affine theories with a projective symmetry,\nincluding non-minimally coupled matter fields which respect this invariance.\nThe symmetry is straightforwardly realised by imposing that the connection only\nenters through the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor, even in the matter\nsector. We leave the connection completely free (including torsion) and obtain\nits general solution as the Levi-Civita connection of an auxiliary metric,\nshowing that the torsion only appears as a projective mode. This result\njustifies the widely used condition of setting vanishing torsion in these\ntheories as a simple gauge choice. We apply our results to some particular\ncases considered in the literature like the so-called\nEddington-inspired-Born-Infeld theories among others. We finally discuss the\npossibility of imposing a gauge fixing where the connection is metric\ncompatible and comment on the genuine character of the non-metricity in\ntheories where the two metrics are not conformally related.\n", "  CMB polarization data is usually analyzed using $E$ and $B$ modes because\nthey are scalars quantities under rotations along the lines of sight and have\ndistinct physical origins. We explore the possibility of using the Stokes\nparameters $Q$ and $U$ for complementary analysis and consistency checks in the\ncontext of searches for non-Gaussianity. We show that the Minkowski Functionals\n(MFs) of $Q,U$ are invariant under local rotations along the lines of sight\neven though $Q,U$ are spin-2 variables, for full sky analysis. The invariance\ndoes not hold for incomplete sky. For local type primordial non-Gaussianity,\nwhen we compare the non-Gaussian deviations of MFs for $Q,U$ to what is\nobtained for $E$ mode or temperature fluctuations, we find that the amplitude\nis about an order of magnitude lower and the shapes of the deviations are\ndifferent. This finding can be useful in distinguishing local type\nnon-Gaussianity from other origins of non-Gaussianity in the observed data.\nLastly, we analyze the sensitivity of the amplitudes of the MFs for $Q$, $U$\nand the number density of singularities of the total polarization intensity to\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and find that all of them decrease as $r$\nincreases.\n", "  The geometric properties of $\\mathrm{Pb-MnO_2}$ composite electrodes are\nstudied, and a general formula is presented for the length of the triple phase\nboundary (TPB) on two dimensional (2D) composite electrodes using sphere\npacking and cutting simulations. The difference in the geometrical properties\nof 2D (or compact) and 3D (or porous) electrodes is discussed. It is found that\nthe length of the TPB is the only reasonable property of a 2D electrode that\nfollows a 1/r particle radius relationship. Subsequently, sphere packing cuts\nare used to derive a statistical electrode surface that is the basis for the\nearlier proposed simulations of different electrochemical mechanisms. It is\nshown that two of the proposed mechanisms (conductivity and a\ntwo-step-two-material kinetic mechanism) can explain the current increase at\n$\\mathrm{Pb-MnO_2}$ anodes compared to standard lead anodes. The results show\nthat although $\\mathrm{MnO_2}$ has low conductivity, when combined with Pb as\nthe metal matrix, the behaviour of the composite is not purely ohmic but is\nalso affected by activation overpotentials, increasing the current density\nclose to the TPB. Current density is inversely proportional to the radius of\nthe catalyst particles, matching with earlier experimental results. A\nhypothetical two-step-two-material mechanism with intermediate\n$\\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ that reacts on both the Pb matrix and $\\mathrm{MnO_2}$\ncatalyst is studied. It was found that assuming quasi-reversible generation of\n$\\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ followed by its chemical decomposition on $\\mathrm{MnO_2}$,\nresults are obtained that agree with the experiments. It is further emphasised\nthat both the Pb matrix and $\\mathrm{MnO_2}$ catalyst are necessary and their\noptimum ratio depends on the used current density. Yet, additional experimental\nevidence is needed to support the postulated mechanism.\n", "  In this note, we consider semiclassical scattering on a manifold which is\nEuclidean near infinity or asymptotically hyperbolic. We show that, if the\ncut-off resolvent satisfies polynomial estimates in a strip of size $O(h |\\log\nh|^{-\\alpha})$ below the real axis, for some $\\alpha\\geq 0$, then the cut-off\nresolvent is actually bounded by $O(|\\log h|^{\\alpha+1} h^{-1})$ in this strip.\nAs an application, we improve slightly the estimates on the real axis given by\nBourgain and Dyatlov in the case of convex co-compact surfaces.\n", "  In this communication we present a detailed study of the effect of chemical\ndisorder on the optical response of Ni$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$ (0.1$\\leq$ x $\\leq$0.75)\nand Ni$_{3(1-x)/3}$Pt$_x$ (0.1$\\leq$ x $\\leq$0.3). We shall propose a formalism\nwhich will combine a Kubo-Greenwood approach with a DFT based tight-binding\nlinear muffin-tin orbitals (TB-LMTO) basis and augmented space recursion (ASR)\ntechnique to explicitly incorporate the effect of disorder. We show that\nchemical disorder has a large impact on optical response of Ni-Pt systems. In\nordered Ni-Pt alloys, the optical conductivity peaks are sharp. But as we\nswitch on chemical disorder, the UV peak becomes broadened and its position as\na function of composition and disorder carries the signature of a phase\ntransition from NiPt to Ni$_3$Pt with decreasing Pt concentration.\nQuantitatively this agrees well with Massalski's Ni-Pt phase diagram\n\\cite{massal}. Both ordered NiPt and Ni$_3$Pt have an optical conductivity\ntransition at 4.12 eV. But disordered NiPt has an optical conductivity\ntransition at 3.93 eV. If we decrease the Pt content, it results a chemical\nphase transition from NiPt to Ni$_3$Pt and shifts the peak position by 1.67 eV\nto the ultraviolet range at 5.6 eV. There is a significant broadening of UV\npeak with increasing Pt content due to enhancement of 3d(Ni)-5d(Pt) bonding.\nChemical disorder enhances the optical response of NiPt alloys nearly one order\nof magnitude. Our study also shows the fragile magnetic effect on optical\nresponse of disordered Ni$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$ (0.4$<$ x $<$0.6) binary alloys. Our\ntheoretical predictions agree more than reasonably well with both earlier\nexperimental as well as theoretical investigations.\n", "  This work presents an evaluation study using a force feedback evaluation\nframework for a novel direct needle force volume rendering concept in the\ncontext of liver puncture simulation. PTC/PTCD puncture interventions targeting\nthe bile ducts have been selected to illustrate this concept. The haptic\nalgorithms of the simulator system are based on (1) partially segmented patient\nimage data and (2) a non-linear spring model effective at organ borders. The\nprimary aim is to quantitatively evaluate force errors caused by our patient\nmodeling approach, in comparison to haptic force output obtained from using\ngold-standard, completely manually-segmented data. The evaluation of the force\nalgorithms compared to a force output from fully manually segmented\ngold-standard patient models, yields a low mean of 0.12 N root mean squared\nforce error and up to 1.6 N for systematic maximum absolute errors. Force\nerrors were evaluated on 31,222 preplanned test paths from 10 patients. Only\ntwelve percent of the emitted forces along these paths were affected by errors.\nThis is the first study evaluating haptic algorithms with deformable virtual\npatients in silico. We prove haptic rendering plausibility on a very high\nnumber of test paths. Important errors are below just noticeable differences\nfor the hand-arm system.\n", "  It is shown that the Stokes-Mueller formalism can be reformulated in terms of\nquaternions, and the quaternion approach is more suitable for the formalism of\nMueller-Jones states that we have recently described. In terms of quaternions\nit can be shown that the vector and matrix states and the Jones matrix\nassociated to nondepolarizing optical systems are different representations\nisomorphic to the same quaternion state, and this quaternion state turns out to\nbe the rotator of the Stokes quaternion. It is also shown that the coherent\nlinear combination of nondepolarizing optical media states and depolarization\nphenomena can be reformulated in terms of quaternion states.\n", "  We study the observation of exotic looped trajectories in double-slit\nexperiments with matter waves. We consider the relative intensity at $x=0$ as a\nfunction of the time-of-flight from the double-slit to the screen inside the\ninterferometer. This allows us to define a fringe visibility associated to the\ncontribution to the interference pattern given by exotic lopped trajectories.\nWe demonstrate that the Sorkin parameter is given in terms of this visibility\nand of the axial phases which include the Gouy phase. We verify how this\nparameter can be obtained by measuring the relative intensity at the screen. We\nshow that the effect of exotic looped trajectories can be significantly\nincreased by simply adjusting the parameters of the double-slit apparatus.\nApplying our results to the case of neutron interferometry, we obtain a maximum\nSorkin parameter of the order of $|\\kappa_{max}|\\approx0.2$, which is the value\nof the fringe visibility.\n", "  We show that the two notions of entanglement: the maximum of the geometric\nmeasure of entanglement and the maximum of the nuclear norm is attained for the\nsame states. We affirm the conjecture of Higuchi-Sudberry on the maximum\nentangled state of four qubits. We introduce the notion of d-density tensor for\nmixed d-partite states. We show that d-density tensor is separable if and only\nif its nuclear norm is $1$. We suggest an alternating method for computing the\nnuclear norm of tensors. We apply the above results to symmetric tensors. We\ngive many numerical examples.\n", "  We introduce a randomized Hall-Littlewood RSK algorithm and study its\ncombinatorial and probabilistic properties. On the probabilistic side, a new\nmodel --- the Hall-Littlewood RSK field --- is introduced. Its various\ndegenerations contain known objects (the stochastic six vertex model, the\nasymmetric simple exclusion process) as well as a variety of new ones. We\nprovide formulas for a rich class of observables of these models, extending\nexisting results about Macdonald processes. On the combinatorial side, we\nestablish analogs of properties of the classical RSK algorithm: invertibility,\nsymmetry, and a \"bijectivization\" of the skew-Cauchy identity.\n", "  A shadow wave function with an explicit symmetric kernel is introduced. As a\nconsequence the atoms exchange in the system is enhanced. Basic properties of\nthis class of trial functions are kept and quantities it can describe are\neasily estimated. The effectiveness of this approach is analized by computing\nproperties of interest in a system formed from 4He atoms.\n", "  We consider the governing equations for the motion of compressible fluid on\nan evolving surface from both energetic and thermodynamic points of view. We\nemploy our energetic variational approaches to derive the momentum equation of\nour compressible fluid systems on the evolving surface. Applying the first law\nof thermodynamics and the Gibbs equation, we investigate the internal energy,\nenthalpy, entropy, and free energy of the fluid on the evolving surface. We\nalso study conservative forms and conservation laws of our compressible fluid\nsystems on the evolving surface. Moreover, we derive the generalized heat and\ndiffusion systems on an evolving surface from an energetic point of view. This\npaper gives a mathematical validity of the surface stress tensor determined by\nthe Boussinesq-Scriven law. Using a flow map on an evolving surface and\napplying the Riemannian metric induced by the flow map are key ideas to analyze\nfluid flow on the evolving surface.\n", "  A new reconstruction of the heliospheric modulation potential for galactic\ncosmic rays is presented for the neutron monitor era, since 1951. The new\nreconstruction is based on an updated methodology in comparison to previous\nreconstructions: (1) the use of the new-generation neutron monitor yield\nfunction, (2) the use of the new model of the local interstellar spectrum,\nemploying in particular direct data from the distant missions, and (3) the\ncalibration of the neutron monitor responses to direct measurements of the\ncosmic ray spectrum performed by the PAMELA space-borne spectrometer over 47\ntime intervals during 2006{2010. The reconstruction is based on data from six\nstandard NM64-type neutron monitors (Apatity, Inuvik, Kergulen, Moscow, Newark\nand Oulu) since 1965, and two IGY-type ground-based detectors (Climax and\nMt.Washington) for 1951-1964. The new reconstruction, along with the estimated\nuncertainties is tabulated in the paper. The presented series forms a benchmark\nrecord of the cosmic ray variability (in the energy range between 1-30 GeV) for\nthe last 60 years, and can be used in long-term studies in the fields of solar,\nheliospheric and solar-terrestrial physics.\n", "  We begin with a brief summary of issues encountered involving causality in\nquantum theory, placing careful emphasis on the assumptions involved in results\nsuch as the EPR paradox and Bell's inequality. We critique some solutions to\nthe resulting paradox, including Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics and the\nmany-worlds interpretation. We then discuss how a spacetime manifold could come\nabout on the classical level out of a quantum system, by constructing a space\nwith a topology out of the algebra of observables, and show that even with an\nhypothesis of superluminal causation enforcing consistent measurements of\nentangled states, a causal cone structure arises on the classical level.\nFinally, we discuss the possibility that causality as understood in classical\nrelativistic physics may be an emergent symmetry which does not hold on the\nquantum level.\n", "  The need for improved engine efficiencies has motivated the development of\nhigh-pressure combustion systems, in which operating conditions achieve and\nexceed critical conditions. Associated with these conditions are large\nthermodynamic gradients and strong variations in transport properties as the\nfluid undergoes mixing and phase transition. Accurately simulating these\nreal-fluid environments remains a main challenge. Different modeling approaches\nhave been employed, which can be categorized as diffused and sharp interface\nmethods. The objective of this study is to examine the diffused interface\nmethod for simulating diesel-fuel injection at conditions related to the\nsupercritical regime. To this end, a recently developed compressible real-fluid\nsolver for transcritical conditions is employed. Simulations of an ECN-relevant\ndiesel-fuel injector are performed and predictions for instantaneous and\nstatistical flow-field results are compared against available measurements. It\nis expected that results from this analysis will be useful in identifying\nlimitations of current modeling techniques and in improving physical and\nnumerical models for high-pressure injection systems.\n", "  Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) are an important component of Space Weather,\nincluding radiation hazard to humans and electronic equipment, and the\nionisation of the Earth's atmosphere. We review the key observations of SEPs,\nour current understanding of their acceleration and transport, and discuss how\nthis knowledge is incorporated within Space Weather forecasting tools.\nMechanisms for acceleration during solar flares and at shocks driven by Coronal\nMass Ejections are discussed, as well as the timing relationships between\nsignatures of solar eruptive events and the detection of SEPs in interplanetary\nspace. Evidence on how the parameters of SEP events are related to those of the\nparent solar activity is reviewed and transport effects influencing SEP\npropagation to near-Earth locations are examined. Finally, the approaches to\nforecasting Space Weather SEP effects are discussed. We conclude that both\nflare and CME shock acceleration contribute to Space Weather relevant SEP\npopulations and need to be considered within forecasting tools.\n", "  The ability to manipulate the frequency of light is of great importance in\nboth fundamental quantum sciences and practical applications. Traditional\nmethod for frequency conversion relies on nonlinear optical processes, which\nare faced with the obstacles of low efficiency and limited bandwidth. Recent\ndevelopments of topological photonics introduce the concepts of gauge\npotentials and magnetic fields to the realm of photons. Here, we demonstrate\nversatile frequency manipulation of light via photonic gauge potentials in a\nfiber-optic communication system. The gauge potential of frequency dimension is\nrealized by controlling the initial phase of electro-optic phase modulation. A\nmaximum 50 GHz frequency shift and three-fold bandwidth expansion for frequency\ncombs are achieved by choosing different gauge potentials. By adopting two\ncascaded phase modulators with different gauge potentials, we also realize\n\"negative refraction\" for frequency combs and frequency \"perfect imaging\"for\narbitrarily input spectra. These results may pave the way towards versatile\nfrequency management in quantum optics and classical optical communications.\n", "  We analyse Kepler light-curves of the exoplanet KOI-13b transiting its\nmoderately rapidly rotating (gravity-darkened) parent star. A physical model,\nwith minimal ad hoc free parameters, reproduces the time-averaged light-curve\nat the ca. 10 parts per million level. We demonstrate that this Roche-model\nsolution allows the absolute dimensions of the system to be determined from the\nstar's projected equatorial rotation speed, v(e)sin(i), without any additional\nassumptions; we find a planetary radius 1.33+/-0.05 R(Jup), stellar polar\nradius 1.55+/-0.06 R(sun), combined mass M(*) + M(P) (\\simeq M*) = 1.47 +/-\n0.17 M(sun), and distance d \\simeq 370+/-25 pc, where the errors are dominated\nby uncertainties in relative flux contribution of the visual-binary companion\nKOI-13B. The implied stellar rotation period is within ca. 5% of the\nnon-orbital, 25.43-hr signal found in the Kepler photometry. We show that the\nmodel accurately reproduces independent tomographic observations, and yields an\noffset between orbital and stellar-rotation angular-momentum vectors of\n60.25+/-0.05 degrees.\n", "  Homomorphisms between relational structures play a central role in finite\nmodel theory, constraint satisfaction and database theory. A central theme in\nquantum computation is to show how quantum resources can be used to gain\nadvantage in information processing tasks. In particular, non-local games have\nbeen used to exhibit quantum advantage in boolean constraint satisfaction, and\nto obtain quantum versions of graph invariants such as the chromatic number. We\nshow how quantum strategies for homomorphism games between relational\nstructures can be viewed as Kleisli morphisms for a quantum monad on the\n(classical) category of relational structures and homomorphisms. We show a\ngeneral connection between these notions and state-independent quantum\nrealizations of strong contextuality in the Abramsky-Brandenburger formulation\nof contextuality. We use these results to exhibit a wide range of examples of\ncontextuality-powered quantum advantage, and to unify several apparently\ndiverse strands of previous work.\n", "  The RFQ design tool DEMIRCI aims to provide fast and accurate simulation of a\nlight ion accelerating cavity and of the ion beam in it. It is a modern tool\nwith a graphical user interface leading to a \"point and click\" method to help\nthe designer. This article summarizes the recent developments of DEMIRCI\nsoftware such as the addition of beam dynamics and 8-term potential coefficient\ncalculations. Its results are compared to other software available on the\nmarket, to show the attained compatibility level. Finally the future prospects\nare discussed.\n", "  We summarize the status of various supersymmetric models in view of the\nexisting LHC data. A particular focus is on the implications of the measured\nHiggs mass on these models which gives important constraints. We consider here\nminimal and non-mininal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.\n", "  We consider the embedding theory, the approach to gravity proposed by Regge\nand Teitelboim, in which 4D space-time is treated as a surface in\nhigh-dimensional flat ambient space. In its general form, which does not\ncontain artificially imposed constraints, this theory can be viewed as an\nextension of GR. In the present paper we study the canonical description of the\nembedding theory in this general form. In this case, one of the natural\nconstraints cannot be written explicitly, in contrast to the case where\nadditional Einsteinian constraints are imposed. Nevertheless, it is possible to\ncalculate all Poisson brackets with this constraint. We prove that the algebra\nof four emerging constraints is closed, i.e., all of them are first-class\nconstraints. The explicit form of this algebra is also obtained.\n", "  Realizing an on-chip reconfigurable source of path-entangled photons is of\ncritical importance for the advancement of quantum information processing and\nnetworking. Achieving this goal has proven challenging to date. We present an\non-chip scheme for the deterministic creation of co-propagating or\ncounter-propagating path-entangled photon pairs that can be routed in multiple\nconfigurations by tuning a classical parameter. The simplest manifestation of\nthis approach makes use of two \\textit{coupled} waveguides: a\n\\textit{nonlinear} waveguide that produces photon pairs via spontaneous\nparametric downconversion from an externally incident unguided optical pump,\nand an auxiliary \\textit{linear} waveguide. Although the photon pairs are born\nin only one waveguide, which alone cannot create path-entanglement, linear\ncoupling over an extended length to the passive waveguide introduces unexpected\nindistinguishability that induces path-entanglement. Tuning of the classical\npump spatial profile allows routing the photon pairs over all possible\nconfigurations. The proposed device is a building block for future\nquantum-optical networks.\n", "  The motion and photon emission of electrons in a superlattice may be\ndescribed as in an undulator. Therefore, there is a close analogy between\nballistic electrons in a superlattice and electrons in a free electron laser\n(FEL). Touching upon this analogy the intensity of photon emission in the IR\nregion and the gain are calculated. It is shown that the amplification can be\nsignificant, reaching tens of percent.\n", "  Based on mixedness definition as M=1-tr(\\r{ho}^2), we obtain a new\nvariance-based uncertainty equality along with an inequality for Hermitian\noperators of a single-qubit system. The obtained uncertainty equality can be\nused as a measure of the system mixedness. A qubit system with feedback control\nis also exploited to demonstrate the new uncertainty.\n", "  A scaling phenomenon in the cross section for fragments has been found in the\nprojectile fragmentation reaction, and an empirical scaling formula is proposed\nby considering the dependence of cross section on the size and asymmetry of the\nreaction system and the fragment itself. Furthermore, the empirical scaling\nformula is used to predict the production of fragment in the\n$^{68}$Ni/$^{69}$Cu/$^{72}$Zn + $^9$Be reactions around 90$A$ MeV. Compared to\nthe results calculated by the statistical abrasion ablation model and the {\\sc\nepax3} parameterizations, the empirical scaling formula can better reproduce\nthe measured fragments. The empirical scaling formula can be used to predict\nthe yield for fragment in projectile fragmentation reaction.\n", "  The near-field scanning optical microscopic (NSOM) imaging of Au\nnanoparticles with size in the sub-wavelength limit (<wavelength/2N.A.) is\nreported. The NSOM imaging technique can resolve the objects which is beyond\nthe scope of optical microscope using visible light (wavelength=500 nm) with\nobjectives having a numerical aperture (N.A.) close to unity. The role of\nevanescent waves which is an exponentially decaying field with higher momenta\ni.e., lower wavelengths compared to that of normal light, in the metal\ndielectric interface is realized for imaging of noble metal nanostructures with\nsub-wavelength dimension in the near field. However, the confined light with\ncomponents of evanescent waves, emanating from the NSOM probe, interacts with\nthe oscillating dipoles present in the sub-diffraction limited nanostructures\nand produce propagating waves, which can be recorded by the far field detector.\nThe light-matter interactions of Au nanoparticles of diameters in the range of\n10-150 nm probed by the NSOM technique with a visible excitation of 532 nm are\nreported. The strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) related absorption of Au\nnanoparticles is envisaged for explaining the contrast variations in the\nrecorded NSOM images.\n", "  Experimental/theoretical evidence for sustained vibration-assisted electronic\n(vibronic) coherence in the Photosystem II Reaction Center (PSII RC) indicates\nthat photosynthetic solar-energy conversion might be optimized through the\ninterplay of electronic and vibrational quantum dynamics. This evidence has\nbeen obtained by investigating the primary charge separation process in the\nPSII RC by two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and Redfield modeling\nof the experimental data. However, while conventional Fourier transform\nanalysis of the 2DES data allows oscillatory signatures of vibronic coherence\nto be identified in the frequency domain in the form of static 2D frequency\nmaps, the real-time evolution of the coherences is lost. Here we apply for the\nfirst time wavelet analysis to the PSII RC 2DES data to obtain time-resolved 2D\nfrequency maps. These maps allow us to demonstrate that i) coherence between\nthe excitons initiating the two different charge separation pathways is active\nfor more than 500 fs, and ii) coherence between exciton and charge-transfer\nstates, the reactant and product of the charge separation reaction,\nrespectively, is active for at least 1 ps. These findings imply that the PSII\nRC employs coherence i) to sample competing electron transfer pathways, and ii)\nto perform directed, ultrafast and efficient electron transfer.\n", "  An optical kink is a shock-wave-like field structure which can appear in a\nresonant two-level medium as a result of the nonlinear process of\nself-steepening. We numerically simulate this process using an adiabatically\nswitching waveform as an input and confirm the self-similarity of resulting\nkinks. The analysis is also applicable to a more general waveform with a\ndecaying trailing edge which we call a kinklike pulse. We study in detail\ncollisions of kinks with other kinks and ultrashort pulses and demonstrate the\npossibility to control kink speed by changing the parameters of\ncounterpropagating fields. The effects considered can be treated as belonging\nto a wide class of unexplored phenomena in the regime of incoherent\nlight-matter interaction.\n", "  A fundamental aspect of limitations in learning any computation in neural\narchitectures is characterizing their optimal capacities.\n  An important, widely-used neural architecture is known as autoencoders where\nthe network reconstructs the input at the output layer via a representation at\na hidden layer.\n  Even though capacities of several neural architectures have been addressed\nusing statistical physics methods, the capacity of autoencoder neural networks\nis not well-explored.\n  Here, we analytically show that an autoencoder network of binary neurons with\na hidden layer can achieve a capacity that grows exponentially with network\nsize.\n  The network has fixed random weights encoding a set of dense input patterns\ninto a dense, expanded (or \\emph{overcomplete}) hidden layer representation. A\nset of learnable weights decodes the input patters at the output layer. We\nperform a mean-field approximation of the model to reduce the model to a\nperceptron problem with an input-output dependency. Carrying out Gardner's\n\\emph{replica} calculation, we show that as the expansion ratio, defined as the\nnumber of hidden units over the number of input units, increases, the\nautoencoding capacity grows exponentially even when the sparseness or the\ncoding level of the hidden layer representation is changed. The\nreplica-symmetric solution is locally stable and is in good agreement with\nsimulation results obtained using a local learning rule. In addition, the\ndegree of symmetry between the encoding and decoding weights monotonically\nincreases with the expansion ratio.\n", "  Dielectron production in the $\\pi N$ interaction at not large energies is\nstudied. The dominant contribution of the $\\Delta$-isobar creation in the\nintermediate state at incident pion momenta of about 0.3-0.4 GeV$/$c is shown.\nThe experimental distributions over the angle and effective mass $M_{e^+e_-}$\nof the $e^+e^-$ pair are described satisfactorily. This stimulated us to\npresent theoretical predictions for the $M_{e^+e_-}$ distribution in the\nprocess $\\pi^- p\\rightarrow ne^+e^-$ at different incident momenta, which could\nbe verified, for example, by the HADES experiments.\n", "  This thesis presents several aspects of the physics of disordered elastic\nsystems and of the analytical methods used for their study. On one hand we will\nbe interested in universal properties of avalanche processes in the statics and\ndynamics (at the depinning transition) of elastic interfaces of arbitrary\ndimension in disordered media at zero temperature. To study these questions we\nwill use the functional renormalization group. After a review of these aspects\nwe will more particularly present the results obtained during the thesis on (i)\nthe spatial structure of avalanches and (ii) the correlations between\navalanches. On the other hand we will be interested in static properties of\ndirected polymers in $1+1$ dimension, and in particular in observables related\nto the KPZ universality class. In this context the study of exactly solvable\nmodels has recently led to important progress. After a review of these aspects\nwe will be more particularly interested in exactly solvable models of directed\npolymer on the square lattice and present the results obtained during the\nthesis in this direction: (i) classification of Bethe ansatz exactly solvable\nmodels of directed polymer at finite temperature on the square lattice; (ii)\nKPZ universality for the Log-Gamma and Inverse-Beta models; (iii) KPZ\nuniversality and non-universality for the Beta model; (iv) stationary measures\nof the Inverse-Beta model and of related zero temperature models.\n", "  Density Functional Theory relies on universal functionals characteristic of a\ngiven system. Those functionals in general are different for the electron gas\nand for jellium (electron gas with uniform background). However, jellium is\nfrequently used to construct approximate functionals for the electron gas\n(e.g., local density approximation, gradient expansions). The precise\nrelationship of the exact functionals for the two systems is addressed here. In\nparticular, it is shown that the exchange - correlation functionals for the\ninhomogeneous electron gas and inhomogeneous jellium are the same. This\njustifies theoretical and quantum Monte Carlo simulation studies of jellium to\nguide the construction of functionals for the electron gas. Related issues of\nthe thermodynamic limit are noted as well.\n", "  A local and gauge invariant version of QCD Lagrangian is introduced. The\nmodel includes Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) terms within its action in a\nsurprisingly renormalizable form. This occurs thanks to the presence of action\nterms which at first sight, look as breaking power counting renormalizability.\nHowever, those terms also modify the quark propagators, to become more\ndecreasing that the Dirac one at large momenta, indicating power counting\nrenormalizability. The approach, can also be interpreted as generalized\nrenormalization procedure for massless QCD. The free propagator, given by the\nsubstraction between a massive and a massless Dirac ones, in the Lee-Wick form,\nsuggests that the theory also retains unitarity. The appearance of finite quark\nmasses already in the tree approximation in the scheme is determined by the\nfact that the new action terms explicitly break chiral invariance. The approach\nlooks as being able to implement the Fritzsch Democratic Symmetry breaking\nideas about the quark mass hierarchy. Also, a link of the theory with the SM\nseems that can follow after employing the Zimmermann's couplings reduction\nscheme. The renormalized Feynman diagram expansion of the model is written here\nand the formula for the degree of divergence of the diagrams is derived. The\nprimitive divergent graphs are identified. We start their evaluation through\nthe calculation of the divergence of the gluon polarization operator. The\ndivergent part of the gluon selfenergy results to be transverse as required by\ngauge invariance and also independent of the new couplings appearing. The\ncalculations of the rest of primitive divergences will be presented elsewhere.\n", "  Recently, two kinds of mesoporous catalysts with high propylene selectivity\nin propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been successfully synthesized. The\nfirst proposed catalyst is SAPO-34 molecular sieve with hierarchical tuned\nnanostructure. The second catalyst is a novel bi-phase SAPO-34/ZSM-5 zeolite\nhierarchical composite utilized with TPA-SAPO-34 exchanged core cystals being\nwrapped by ZSM-5 zeolite particles. In this contribution, the physico-chemical\nproperties of the catalysts were analyzed by XRD, FESEM and N2\nadsorption-desorption techniques and their catalytic activity and life time\nwere investigated in MTO process. The results show that hierarchical SAPO-34\nhas a significant lifetime and selectivity to the light olefins compared with\nSAPO-34/ZSM-5. It shows a full conversion of MeOH during the first 200 min of\nreaction while composite sample conversion starts under 90 % and decreases\nduring the time. However the deactivation phenomenon is hindered by using\ncore-shell catalyst; hence the robustness can be named as a privilege employing\ncomposite zeolitic catalysts.\n", "  We study a class of non-equilibrium quasi-stationary states for a Markov\nsystem interacting with two different thermal baths. We show that the work done\nunder a slow, external change of parameters admits a potential, i.e., the free\nenergy. Three conditions are needed for the existence of free energy in this\nnon-equilibrium system: time-scale separation between variables of the system,\npartial controllability (external fields couple only with the slow variable),\nand an effective detailed balance. These conditions are facilitated in the\ncontinuous limit for the slow variable. In contrast to its equilibrium\ncounterpart, the non-equilibrium free energy can increase with temperature. One\nexample of this is that entropy reduction by means of external fields (cooling)\ncan be easier (in the sense of the work cost) if it starts from a higher\ntemperature.\n", "  String diagrams provide a convenient graphical framework which may be used\nfor equational reasoning about morphisms of monoidal categories. However,\nunlike term rewriting, rewriting string diagrams results in shorter equational\nproofs, because the string diagrammatic representation allows us to formally\nestablish equalities modulo any rewrite steps which follow from the monoidal\nstructure.\n  Manipulating string diagrams by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone\nprocess, especially for large string diagrams. This can be ameliorated by using\nsoftware proof assistants, such as Quantomatic.\n  However, reasoning about concrete string diagrams may be limiting and in some\nscenarios it is necessary to reason about entire (infinite) families of string\ndiagrams. When doing so, we face the same problems as for manipulating concrete\nstring diagrams, but in addition, we risk making further mistakes if we are not\nprecise enough about the way we represent (infinite) families of string\ndiagrams.\n  The primary goal of this thesis is to design a mathematical framework for\nequational reasoning about infinite families of string diagrams which is\namenable to computer automation. We will be working with context-free families\nof string diagrams and we will represent them using context-free graph\ngrammars. We will model equations between infinite families of diagrams using\nrewrite rules between context-free grammars. Our framework represents\nequational reasoning about concrete string diagrams and context-free families\nof string diagrams using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free\ngraph grammars respectively. We will prove that our representation is sound by\nshowing that it respects the concrete semantics of string diagrammatic\nreasoning and we will show that our framework is appropriate for software\nimplementation by proving important decidability properties.\n", "  The present paper reports on our effort to characterize vortical interactions\nin complex fluid flows through the use of network analysis. In particular, we\nexamine the vortex interactions in two-dimensional decaying isotropic\nturbulence and find that the vortical interaction network can be characterized\nby a weighted scale-free network. It is found that the turbulent flow network\nretains its scale-free behavior until the characteristic value of circulation\nreaches a critical value. Furthermore, we show that the two-dimensional\nturbulence network is resilient against random perturbations but can be greatly\ninfluenced when forcing is focused towards the vortical structures that are\ncategorized as network hubs. These findings can serve as a network-analytic\nfoundation to examine complex geophysical and thin-film flows and take\nadvantage of the rapidly growing field of network theory, which complements\nongoing turbulence research based on vortex dynamics, hydrodynamic stability,\nand statistics. While additional work is essential to extend the mathematical\ntools from network analysis to extract deeper physical insights of turbulence,\nan understanding of turbulence based on the interaction-based network-theoretic\nframework presents a promising alternative in turbulence modeling and control\nefforts.\n", "  The $B$-physics experiments at LHCb, BaBar and Belle hint towards deviations\nfrom Lepton Flavor Universality in both the tree-level and loop-induced $B$\nmeson semileptonic decays. We propose a leptoquark model with light\nright-handed neutrinos which can accommodate both\n$R_K^\\mathrm{exp}<R_K^\\mathrm{SM}$ and\n$R_{D^{(\\ast)}}^\\mathrm{exp}>R_{D^{(\\ast)}}^\\mathrm{SM}$. We discuss several of\nits predictions which can be tested in modern day experiments. We also comment\non the recent finding at LHCb, namely\n$R_{K^\\ast}^{\\mathrm{exp}}<R_{K^\\ast}^\\mathrm{SM}$.\n", "  The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond is a unique optical defect that\nis used in many applications today and methods to enhance its fluorescence\nbrightness are highly sought after. We observed experimentally an enhancement\nof the NV quantum yield by up to 7% in bulk diamond caused by an external\nmagnetic field relative to the field-free case. This observation is\nrationalised phenomenologically in terms of a magnetic field dependence of the\nNV excited state triplet-to-singlet transition rate. The theoretical model is\nin good qualitative agreement with the experimental results at low excitation\nintensities. Our results significantly contribute to our fundamental\nunderstanding of the photophysical properties of the NV defect in diamond and\nmay enable novel NV centre-based magnetometry techniques.\n", "  During southward interplanetary magnetic field, dayside reconnection will\ndrive the Dungey cycle in the magnetosphere, which is manifested as a two-cell\nconvection pattern in the ionosphere. We address the response of the\nionospheric convection to changes in the dayside reconnection rate by examining\nmagnetic field perturbations at 780 km altitude. The Active Magnetosphere and\nPlanetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment data products derived from the\nIridium constellation provide global maps of the magnetic field perturbations.\nCluster data just upstream of the Earth's bow shock have been used to estimate\nthe dayside reconnection rate. By using a statistical model where the magnetic\nfield can respond on several time scales, we confirm previous reports of an\nalmost immediate response both near noon and near midnight combined with a\n10-20 min reconfiguration time of the two-cell convection pattern. The response\nof the ionospheric convection has been associated with the expansion of the\npolar cap boundary in the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm. In the original formulation\nof this paradigm the expansion spreads from noon to midnight in 15-20 min.\nHowever, also an immediate global response has been shown to be consistent with\nthe paradigm when the previous dayside reconnection history is considered. In\nthis paper we present a new explanation for how the immediate response can be\naccommodated in the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm. The new explanation is based on\nhow MHD waves propagate in the magnetospheric lobes when newly reconnected open\nflux tubes are added to the lobes, and the magnetopause flaring angle\nincreases.\n", "  Propagation of gravitational disturbances at the speed of light is one of the\nkey predictions of the General Theory of Relativity. This result is now backed\nindirectly by the observations of the behaviour of the ephemeris of binary\npulsar systems. These new results have in- creased the interest in the\nmathematical theory of gravitational waves in the last decades and several\nmathematical approaches have been developed for a better understanding of the\nsolutions. In this paper we develop a modal series expansion technique in which\nsolutions can be built for plane waves from a seed integrable function. The\nconvergence of these series is proven by the Raabe- Duhamel criteria and we\nshow that these solutions are characterized by a well-defined and finite\ncurvature tensor and also a finite energy content.\n", "  We study many-body interaction effects in the spatially-resolved filling\nfactor ($\\nu$) distribution for higher Landau levels (LLs) via self-consistent\nHartree-Fock simulations in the integer quantum Hall (IQH) regime. Our results\nindicate a strong, interaction-induced tendency to avoid the simultaneous\nexistence of partially filled spin-up and spin-down LLs. Rather, we find that\nsuch partially filled LLs consist of coexisting regions of full and empty LLs.\nAt the boundaries between the regions of full and empty LLs, we observe edge\nstripes of nearly constant $\\nu$ close to half-odd filling. This suggests that\nthe exchange interaction induces a behavior similar to a Hund's rule for the\noccupation of the spin split LLs. The screening of the disorder and edge\npotential appears significantly reduced as compared to static Thomas-Fermi\nscreening. Our results are consistent with a local, lateral $\\nu$ dependence of\nthe exchange-enhanced spin splitting. Hence, on quantum-coherent length scales\nas probed here, the electron system of the IQH effect behaves similar to a\nnon-interacting single particle system - not because of the absence, but rather\ndue to the dominance of many-body effects.\n", "  Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a novel imaging modality with important\napplications such as angiography, stem cell tracking, and cancer imaging.\nRecently, there have been efforts to increase the functionality of MPI via\nmulti-color imaging methods that can distinguish the responses of different\nnanoparticles, or nanoparticles in different environmental conditions. The\nproposed techniques typically rely on extensive calibrations that capture the\ndifferences in the harmonic responses of the nanoparticles. In this work, we\npropose a method to directly estimate the relaxation time constant of the\nnanoparticles from the MPI signal, which is then used to generate a multi-color\nrelaxation map. The technique is based on the underlying mirror symmetry of the\nadiabatic MPI signal when the same region is scanned back and forth. We\nvalidate the proposed method via extensive simulations, and via experiments on\nour in-house Magnetic Particle Spectrometer (MPS) setup at 550 Hz and our\nin-house MPI scanner at 9.7 kHz. Our results show that nanoparticles can be\nsuccessfully distinguished with the proposed technique, without any calibration\nor prior knowledge about the nanoparticles.\n", "  The partition function of rational conformal field theories (CFTs) on Riemann\nsurfaces is expected to satisfy ODEs of Gauss-Manin type. We investigate the\ncase of hyperelliptic surfaces and derive the ODE system for the $(2,5)$\nminimal model.\n", "  Observations from the Odin/Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR) instrument have\nbeen assimilated into the DIAMOND model (Dynamic Isentropic Assimilation Model\nfor OdiN Data), in order to estimate the chemical ozone (O$_{3}$) loss in the\nstratosphere. This data assimilation technique is described in Sagi and Murtagh\n(2016), in which it was used to study the inter-annual variability in ozone\ndepletion during the entire Odin operational time and in both hemispheres. Our\nstudy focuses on the Arctic region, where two O$_{3}$ destruction mechanisms\nplay an important role, involving halogen and nitrogen chemical families (i.e.\nNOx = NO and NO$_{2}$), respectively. The temporal evolution and geographical\ndistribution of (O$_{3}$) loss in the low and middle stratosphere have been\ninvestigated between 2002 and 2013. For the first time, this has been done\nbased on the study of a series of winter-spring seasons over more than a\ndecade, spanning very different dynamical conditions. The chemical mechanisms\ninvolved in O$_{3}$ depletion are very sensitive to thermal conditions and\ndynamical activity, which are extremely variable in the Arctic stratosphere. We\nhave focused our analysis on particularly cold and warm winters, in order to\nstudy the influence this has on ozone loss. The winter 2010/11 is considered as\nan example for cold conditions. This case, which has been the subject of many\nstudies, was characterised by a very stable vortex associated with particularly\nlow temperatures, which led to an important halogen-induced O$_{3}$ loss\noccurring inside the vortex in the lower stratosphere. We found a loss of 2.1\nppmv at an altitude of 450K in the end of March 2011, which corresponds to the\nlargest ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere observed during the last\ndecade. This result is consistent with other studies. (continued)\n", "  In this paper our attention is focused on relations between radio signal\npropagation characteristics and temperature changes in D-region af- ter solar\nX-flare occurrence. We present temperature dependencies of electron plasma\nfrequency, the parameter that describes medium conditions for prop- agation of\nan electromagnetic wave, and the refractive index which describes how this wave\npropagates. As an example for quantitative calculations based on obtained\ntheoretical equations we choose the reaction of the D-region to the solar\nX-flare occurred on May 5 th, 2010. The ionospheric modelling is based on the\nexperimental data obtained by low ionosphere observations using very low\nfrequency radio signal.\n", "  One of the most important parameters in ionospheric plasma research also\nhaving a wide practical application in wireless satellite telecommunications is\nthe total electron content (TEC) representing the columnal electron number\ndensity. The F region with high electron density provides the biggest\ncontribution to TEC while the relatively weakly ionized plasma of the D region\n(60 km - 90 km above Earths surface) is often considered as a negligible cause\nof satellite signal disturbances. However, sudden intensive ionization\nprocesses like those induced by solar X ray flares can cause relative increases\nof electron density that are significantly larger in the D-region than in\nregions at higher altitudes. Therefore, one cannot exclude a priori the D\nregion from investigations of ionospheric influences on propagation of\nelectromagnetic signals emitted by satellites. We discuss here this problem\nwhich has not been sufficiently treated in literature so far. The obtained\nresults are based on data collected from the D region monitoring by very low\nfrequency radio waves and on vertical TEC calculations from the Global\nNavigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal analyses, and they show noticeable\nvariations in the D region electron content (TECD) during activity of a solar X\nray flare (it rises by a factor of 136 in the considered case) when TECD\ncontribution to TEC can reach several percent and which cannot be neglected in\npractical applications like global positioning procedures by satellites.\n", "  Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been identified in different\nenvironments in star- forming regions. Laboratory studies show that COMs form\nin the solid state, on icy grains, typically following a non-energetic\n(atom-addition) or energetic (UV-photon absorption) trigger. So far, such\nstudies have been largely performed for single processes. Here, we present the\nfirst work that quantitatively investigates both the relative importance and\nthe cumulative effect of (non-)energetic processing. We focus on astronomically\nrelevant CO:CH3OH = 4:1 ice analogues exposed to doses relevant for the\ncollapse stage of dense clouds. Hydrogenation experiments result in the\nformation of methyl formate (MF HC(O)OCH3), glycolaldehyde (GA HC(O)CH2OH) and\nethylene glycol (EG H2C(OH)CH2OH) at 14 K. The absolute abundances and the\nabundance fractions are found to be dependent on the H-atom/CO-CH3OH molecule\nratios and on the overall deposition rate. In the case that ices are exposed to\nUV photons only, several different COMs are found. Typically, the abundance\nfractions are 0.2 for MF, 0.3 for GA and 0.5 for EG as opposed to the values\nfound in pure hydrogenation experiments without UV in which MF is largely\nabsent: 0.0, 0.2-0.6 and 0.8-0.4, respectively. In experiments where both are\napplied, overall COM abundances drop to about half of those found in the pure\nUV irradiation experiments, but the composition fractions are very similar.\nThis implies COM ratios can be used as a diagnostic tool to derive the\nprocessing history of an ice. Solid-state branching ratios derived here for GA\nand EG compare well with observations, while the MF case cannot be explained by\nsolid-state conditions investigated here.\n", "  We study the primary entanglement effect on the decoherence of fields reduced\ndensity matrix which are in interaction with another fields or independent mode\nfunctions. We show that the primary entanglement has a significant role in\ndecoherence of the system quantum state. We find that the existence of\nentanglement could couple dynamical equations coming from Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. We show if one wants to see no effect of the entanglement parameter\nin decoherence then interaction terms in Hamiltonian can not be independent\nfrom each other. Generally, including the primary entanglement destroys the\nindependence of the interaction terms. Our results could be generalized to\nevery scalar quantum field theory with a well defined quantization in a given\ncurved space time.\n", "  GK Per, a classical nova of 1901, is thought to undergo variable mass\naccretion on to a magnetized white dwarf (WD) in an intermediate polar system\n(IP). We organized a multi-mission observational campaign in the X-ray and\nultraviolet (UV) energy ranges during its dwarf nova (DN) outburst in 2015\nMarch-April. Comparing data from quiescence and near outburst, we have found\nthat the maximum plasma temperature decreased from about 26 to 16.2+/-0.4 keV.\nThis is consistent with the previously proposed scenario of increase in mass\naccretion rate while the inner radius of the magnetically disrupted accretion\ndisc shrinks, thereby lowering the shock temperature. A NuSTAR observation also\nrevealed a high-amplitude WD spin modulation of the very hard X-rays with a\nsingle-peaked profile, suggesting an obscuration of the lower accretion pole\nand an extended shock region on the WD surface. The X-ray spectrum of GK Per\nmeasured with the Swift X-Ray Telescope varied on time-scales of days and also\nshowed a gradual increase of the soft X-ray flux below 2 keV, accompanied by a\ndecrease of the hard flux above 2 keV. In the Chandra observation with the High\nEnergy Transmission Gratings, we detected prominent emission lines, especially\nof Ne, Mg and Si, where the ratios of H-like to He-like transition for each\nelement indicate a much lower temperature than the underlying continuum. We\nsuggest that the X-ray emission in the 0.8-2 keV range originates from the\nmagnetospheric boundary.\n", "  A magnetothermoelastic problem is considered for a nonhomogeneous, isotropic\nrotating hollow cylinder in the context of three theories of generalized\nformulations, the classical dynamical coupled (C-D) theory, the Lord and\nShulman's (L-S) theory with one relaxation time parameter as well as the Green\nand Lindsay's (G-L) theory with two relaxation time parameters. The inner\nsurface of the cylinder is subjected to a time dependent exponential thermal\nshock at its inner boundary. The inner and outer surfaces of the hollow\ncylinder are assumed to be traction free and the temperature gradient vanishes\nat its outer surface. The problem is solved numerically using finite difference\nmethod by developing Crank-Nicolson implicit scheme. The numerical computations\nof the displacement component, temperature distribution, radial and hoop\nstresses have been estimated. A comparison has been made under the effect of\ndifferent parameters by representing several figures.\n", "  This research is on the dynamics of electrostatically actuated radial-contour\nmode microring resonators. The governing equation of motion is derived by the\nminimization of the Hamiltonian and generalized to include the viscous damping\neffect. The Galerkin method is used to discretize the distributed-parameter\nmodel of the considered ring resonator. The influences of intermolecular forces\nsuch as van der Waals and Casimir on the dynamic behavior of the resonator are\ninvestigated. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of the ring are\ncalculated for various values of ratio of radii (\\b{eta}). The effect of the\ndesign parameters including ring radius, electrostatic voltage and quality\nfactor on the dynamic responses, is discussed. The results of present study can\nbe used in the design of novel MEMS resonators, RF filters and channelizers.\n", "  The first hygroscopic tunable cloth actuator is realized via modification of\ncommercial cloth template by a 3D nanoporous polymer hybrid. The nanoporous\nhybrid guarantees fast water diffusion and amplifies deformation. The cloth\nactuator achieves a large-scale size production, tunable motion, high tensile\nstrength and mechanical flexibility with a breadth of utilities (e.g., electric\ngenerator and smart materials).\n", "  Porous and flexible actuating materials are important in the development of\nsmart systems. We report here a facile method to prepare scalable, flexible\nactuating porous membranes based on a poly(ionic liquid)-modified tissue paper.\nThe targeted membrane property profile was based on a synergy of a gradient\nporous structure of poly(ionic liquid) network and the flexibility of tissue\npaper. The gradient porous structure was built up through ammonia-triggered\nelectrostatic complexation of a poly(ionic liquid) with poly(acrylic acid)\n(PAA) that were previously impregnated inside the tissue paper. As a result,\nthese porous membranes undergo bending deformation in response to organic\nsolvents in vapor or liquid phase and can recover their shape back in air,\nwhich was demonstrated to be able to serve as solvent sensors. Besides, they\nshow enhanced mechanical properties due to the introduction of mechanically\nflexible tissue paper that allows the membranes to be designed as new\nresponsive textiles and contractile actuators.\n", "  We are concerned with a novel sensor-based gesture input/instruction\ntechnology which enables human beings to interact with computers conveniently.\nThe human being wears an emitter on the finger or holds a digital pen that\ngenerates a time harmonic point charge. The inputs/instructions are performed\nthrough moving the finger or the digital pen. The computer recognizes the\ninstruction by determining the motion trajectory of the dynamic point charge\nfrom the collected electromagnetic field measurement data. The identification\nprocess is mathematically modelled as a dynamic inverse source problem for\ntime-dependent Maxwell's equations. From a practical point of view, the point\nsource should be assumed to move in an unknown inhomogeneous background medium,\nwhich models the human body and the surroundings. Moreover, a salient feature\nis that the electromagnetic radiated data are only collected in a limited\naperture. For the inverse problem, we develop, from the respectively\ndeterministic and stochastic viewpoints, a dynamic direct sampling method and a\nmodified particle filter method. Both approaches can effectively recover the\nmotion trajectory. Rigorous theoretical justifications are presented for the\nmathematical modelling and the proposed recovery methods. Extensive numerical\nexperiments are conducted to illustrate the promising features of the two\nproposed recognition approaches.\n", "  A power efficient and stable field emission (FE) has been reported here from\nNickel Oxide nanostructures. Modification in device geometry and surface micro-\n(nano-) structure has been found helpful in addressing the bottlenecks in\nachieving an efficient FE . In terms of threshold and turn on fields, three\norders of magnitude better electron FE has been observed in the nickel oxide\nnanopetals (NiO-NPs) fabricated using simple hydrothermal technique. Uniform\nand vertically aligned NiO-NPs structures, grown on very flat conducting\nsurface (FTO coated glass), show sharp needles like structures on the top edges\nof the flakes. These ultrafine structures play the main role in field emission\nto start at such a low turn on fields. The FE data (J-E plot) has been fitted\nwith Fowler-Nordheim (FN) equation to estimate threshold field value and field\nenhancement factor which are found to be 3 V/mm and $\\sim$ 5 $\\times$ 10$^6$\nrespectively.\n", "  A generalized magnetothermoelasticity, in the context of Lord-Shulman theory,\nis employed to investigate the interaction of a homogeneous and isotropic\nperfect conducting half space with rotation. The Laplace transform for time\nvariable is used to formulate a vector-matrix differential equation which is\nthen solved by eigenvalue method. The continuous solution of displacement\ncomponent while the discontinuous solutions of stress components, temperature\ndistribution, induced magnetic and electric field have been analyzed in an\napproximate manner using assymptotic expansion for small time. The graphical\nrepresentations also prove this continuity and discontinuity of the solutions.\n", "  A highly-efficient multi-resonant RF energy-harvesting rectenna based on a\nmetamaterial perfect absorber featuring closely-spaced polarization-independent\nabsorption modes is presented. Its effective area is larger than its physical\narea, and so efficiencies of 230% and 130% are measured at power densities of\n10 uW/cm2 and 1 uW/cm2 respectively, for a linear absorption mode at 0.75 GHz.\nThe rectenna exhibits a broad polarization-independent region between 1.4 GHz\nand 1.7 GHz with maximum efficiencies of 167% and 36% for those same power\ndensities. Additionally, by adjustment of the distance between the rectenna and\na reflecting ground plane, the absorption frequency can be adjusted to a\nlimited extent within the polarization-independent region. Lastly, the rectenna\nshould be capable of delivering 100 uW of power to a device located within 50 m\nof a cell-phone tower under ideal conditions.\n", "  We demonstrate an RF energy harvesting rectenna design based on a\nmetamaterial perfect absorber (MPA). With the embedded Schottky diodes, the\nrectenna converts captured RF waves to DC power. The Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity\nresonance of the MPA greatly improves the amount of energy captured.\nFurthermore, the FP resonance exhibits a high Q-factor and significantly\nincreases the voltage across the Schottky diodes, which improves the\nrectification efficiency, particularly at low power. This leads to factor of 16\nimprovement of RF-DC conversion efficiency at ambient intensity level.\n", "  We demonstrate a nonlinear metamaterial in microwave frequency regime with\nhysteresis effect and bistable states, which can be utilized as a remotely\ncontrollable micro second switching device. A varactor loaded split-ring\nresonator (SRR) design which exhibits power and frequency dependent broadband\ntunability of the resonance frequency for an external control signal is used.\nMore importantly, the SRR shows bistability with distinct transmission levels.\nThe transition between bi-states is controlled by impulses of an external pump\nsignal. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that transition rate is in\nthe order of microseconds by using a varactor loaded double split-ring\nresonator (DSRR) design composed of two concentric rings.\n", "  We demonstrate a nonlinear metamaterial which enhance higher order harmonics\nin microwave frequency regime. Nonlinearity in the structure is introduced by\nadding a varactor diode in the common slit of the double split ring resonator\n(DSRR) design. By engineering the structure such that inner ring resonance\nfrequency of the DSRR is twice as the outer ring resonance frequency, we have\ndemonstrated that the second harmonic of the outer ring can be enhanced\nsignificantly. By comparing with a single ring (SRR) unit cell structure, DSRR\nhas an enhancement factor of 70. Furthermore, we elucidate that the second\nharmonic signals generated by two identical double split rings interfere and we\ncan use its constructive interference positions to construct an array of DSRRs\nthat gives a maximum second harmonic signal with phase matching condition. When\nthe phase matching condition occurs the enhancement factor of an array is more\nthan the contribution of individual unit cells which proves that the\nenhancement is due to not only constructive interference of the second harmonic\ngenerated by individual unit cells but also due to cavity mechanism occurred in\nthe array structure.\n", "  Freeplay is a significant source of nonlinearity in aeroelastic systems and\nis strictly regulated by airworthiness authorities. It splits the phase plane\nof such systems into three piecewise linear subdomains. Depending on the\nlocation of the freeplay, limit cycle oscillations can result that span either\ntwo or three of these subdomains. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate\nthe existence of two-domain cycles both theoretically and experimentally. A\nsimple aeroelastic system with pitch, plunge and control deflection degrees of\nfreedom is investigated in the presence of freeplay in pitch. It is shown that\ntwo-domain and three-domain cycles can result from a grazing bifurcation and\npropagate in the decreasing airspeed direction. Close to the bifurcation, the\ntwo limit cycle branches interact with each other and aperiodic oscillations\nensue. Equivalent linearization is used to derive the conditions of existence\nof each type of limit cycle and to predict their amplitudes and frequencies.\nComparisons with measurements from wind tunnel experiments demonstrate that the\ntheory describes these phenomena with accuracy.\n", "  Charge-density-waves (CDW) which occur mainly in low-dimensional systems have\na macroscopic wave function similar to superfluids and superconductors.\nKosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition is observed in superfluids and\nsuperconductors, but the presence of KT transition in ultra-thin CDW systems\nhas been an open problem. We report the direct real-space observation of CDWs\nwith new order states in mono-, bi-, and tri-layer 1T-TaS_2 crystal by using a\nlow voltage scanning-transmission-electron-microscope (STEM) without a\nsubstrate. This method is ideal to observe local atomic structures and possible\ndefects. We clearly observed that the mono-layer crystal has a new triclinic\nstripe CDW order without the triple q condition q_1 + q_2 + q_3 = 0. A strong\nelectron-phonon interaction gives rise to new crevasse (line) type defects\ninstead of disclination (point) type defects due to the KT transition. These\nresults reaffirm the importance of the electron-phonon interaction in\nmono-layer nanophysics.\n", "  In the Born, Infeld, Bopp, Podolsky and Dirac theories the electron mass is\nfinite (or zero), but gravity effects have not been considered. Shirokov and\nFisher showed that in studying of origin of elemental particle masses we can\nnot neglect these effects. Gravity field plays an essential role in\ninterpretation of particle mass. It has been shown that for point-like charge\nthe general solution of gravity and electromagnetic (EM) equations that\ncontains arbitrary function $\\mu(r)$, can in special case of this function,\ndescribe gravity and EM fields that do not have singularities in full range of\n$r$ from $0$ to $\\infty$. In this paper we are trying to find more general\nsolution.\n", "  Higher derivative theories of gravity are associated with a mass scale to\ninsure the correct dimensionality of the covariant derivatives. This mass scale\nis known as the scale of non-locality. In this paper, by considering a higher\nderivative toy model, we show that for a system of $n$ particles the effective\nmass scale is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of\nparticles. We demonstrate that as the number of particles increases the\ncorresponding effective mass scale associated with the scattering amplitude\ndecreases.\n", "  In hole-doped cuprates there is now compelling evidence that inside the\npseudogap phase, charge order breaks translational symmetry leading to a\nreconstruction of the Fermi surface. In $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ charge order emerges in\ntwo steps: a 2D order found at zero field and at high temperature inside the\npseudogap phase, and a 3D order that is superimposed below the superconducting\ntransition $T_c$ when superconductivity is weakened by a magnetic field.\nSeveral issues still need to be addressed such as the effect of disorder, the\nrelationship between those charge orders and their respective impact on the\nFermi surface. Here, we report high magnetic field sound velocity measurements\nof the 3D charge order in underdoped $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ in a large doping range. We\nfound that the 3D charge order exists over the same doping range as its 2D\ncounterpart, indicating an intimate connection between the two distinct orders.\nMoreover, we argue that the Fermi surface is reconstructed above the onset\ntemperature of 3D charge order.\n", "  We investigate the spin structure of a uni-axial chiral magnet near the\ntransition temperatures in low fields perpendicular to the helical axis. We\nfind a fan-type modulation structure where the clockwise and counterclockwise\nwindings appear alternatively along the propagation direction of the modulation\nstructure. This structure is often realized in a Yoshimori-type (non-chiral)\nhelimagnet but it is rarely realized in a chiral helimagnet. To discuss\nunderlying physics of this structure, we reconsider the phase diagram (phase\nboundary and crossover lines) through the free energy and asymptotic behaviors\nof isolated solitons. The fan structure appears slightly below the phase\nboundary of the continuous transition of instability-type. In this region,\nthere are no solutions containing any types of isolated solitons to the mean\nfield equations.\n", "  Wet granular aggregates are common precursors of construction materials,\nfood, and health care products. The physical mechanisms involved in the mixing\nof dry grains with a wet substrate are not well understood and difficult to\ncontrol. Here, we study experimentally the accretion of dry grains on a wet\ngranular substrate by measuring the growth dynamics of the wet aggregate. We\nshow that this aggregate is fully saturated and its cohesion is ensured by the\ncapillary depression at the air-liquid interface. The growth dynamics is\ncontrolled by the liquid fraction at the surface of the aggregate and exhibits\ntwo regimes. In the viscous regime, the growth dynamics is limited by the\ncapillary-driven flow of liquid through the granular packing to the surface of\nthe aggregate. In the capture regime, the capture probability depends on the\navailability of the liquid at the saturated interface, which is controlled by\nthe hydrostatic depression in the material. We propose a model that\nrationalizes our observations and captures both dynamics based on the evolution\nof the capture probability with the hydrostatic depression.\n", "  Particle tracking, which is an essential tool in many fields of scientific\nresearch, uses algorithms that retrieve the centroid of tracked particles with\nsub-pixel accuracy. However, images in which the particles occupy a small\nnumber of pixels on the detector, are in close proximity to other particles or\nsuffer from background noise, show a systematic error in which the particle\nsub-pixel positions are biased towards the center of the pixel. This pixel\nlocking effect greatly reduces particle tracking accuracy. In this report, we\ndemonstrate the severity of these errors by tracking experimental (and\nsimulated) imaging data of optically trapped silver nanoparticles and single\nfluorescent proteins. We show that errors in interparticle separation, angle\nand mean square displacement are significantly reduced by applying the\ncorrective Single- pixel interior filling function (SPIFF) algorithm. Our work\ndemonstrates the potential ubiquity of such errors and the general\napplicability of SPIFF correction to many experimental fields.\n", "  Elucidating the interaction between magnetic moments and itinerant carriers\nis an important step to spintronic applications. Here, we investigate magnetic\nand transport properties in d0 ferromagnetic SiC single crystals prepared by\npostimplantation pulsed laser annealing. Magnetic moments are contributed by\nthe p states of carbon atoms, but their magnetic circular dichroism is\ndifferent from that in semi-insulating SiC samples. The anomalous Hall effect\nand negative magnetoresistance indicate the influence of d0 spin order on free\ncarriers. The ferromagnetism is relatively weak in N-implanted SiC compared\nwith that in Al-implanted SiC after annealing. The results suggest that d0\nmagnetic moments and itinerant carriers can interact with each other, which\nwill facilitate the development of SiC spintronic devices with d0\nferromagnetism.\n", "  We consider a background of the violation of the Lorentz symmetry determined\nby the tensor $\\left( K_{F}\\right)_{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta}$ which governs the\nLorentz symmetry violation out of the Standard Model Extension, where this\nbackground gives rise to a Coulomb-type potential, and then, we analyse its\neffects on a relativistic quantum oscillator. Furthermore, we analyse the\nbehaviour of the relativistic quantum oscillator under the influence of a\nlinear scalar potential and this background of the Lorentz symmetry violation.\nWe show in both cases that analytical solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation\ncan be achieved.\n", "  MicroBooNE (the Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment) is a short-baseline\nneutrino experiment based on the technology of a liquid-argon time-projection\nchamber (LArTPC), and has recently completed its first year of data-taking in\nthe Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam. It aims to address the anomalous excess of\nevents with an electromagnetic final state in MiniBooNE, to measure\nneutrino-argon interaction cross sections, and to provide relevant R\\&D for the\nfuture LArTPC experiments, such as DUNE. In these proceedings, we present the\nfirst reconstructed energy spectrum of Michel electrons from cosmic muon\ndecays, the first kinematic distributions of the candidate muon tracks from\n$\\nu_{\\mu}$-argon charged-current interactions, and a demonstration of an\nelectromagnetic shower reconstruction from $\\pi^0$s produced by\n$\\nu_{\\mu}$-argon charged-current interactions. The results demonstrate the\nfirst fully automated reconstruction and selection algorithms in a large LArTPC\nand serve as foundations for future measurements.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the next generation of ground\nbased gamma-ray telescopes allowing us to study very high energy phenomena in\nthe Universe. CTA aims to gain about a factor of ten in sensitivity compared to\ncurrent experiments, extending the accessible gamma-ray energy range from a few\ntens of GeV to some hundreds of TeV. This increased gamma-ray source\nsensitivity, as well as the expected enhanced energy and spatial resolution,\nwill allow exciting new insights in some key science topics. Additionally, CTA\nwill provide a full sky-coverage by featuring the array located in two sites in\nthe Northern and Southern hemispheres. This paper will describe the status of\nCTA and highlight some of CTA's key science themes; namely the origin of\nrelativistic cosmic particles, the study of cosmological effects on gamma-ray\npropagation and the search for annihilating dark matter particles.\n", "  M-dwarf stars are more abundant than G-dwarf stars, so our position as\nobservers on a planet orbiting a G-dwarf raises questions about the suitability\nof other stellar types for supporting life. If we consider ourselves as\ntypical, in the anthropic sense that our environment is probably a typical one\nfor conscious observers, then we are led to the conclusion that planets\norbiting in the habitable zone of G-dwarf stars should be the best place for\nconscious life to develop. But such a conclusion neglects the possibility that\nK-dwarfs or M-dwarfs could provide more numerous sites for life to develop,\nboth now and in the future. In this paper we analyze this problem through\nBayesian inference to demonstrate that our occurrence around a G-dwarf might be\na slight statistical anomaly, but only the sort of chance event that we expect\nto occur regularly. Even if M-dwarfs provide more numerous habitable planets\ntoday and in the future, we still expect mid G- to early K-dwarfs stars to be\nthe most likely place for observers like ourselves. This suggests that\nobservers with similar cognitive capabilities as us are most likely to be found\nat the present time and place, rather than in the future or around much smaller\nstars.\n", "  A semi-infinite crack loaded by a general asymmetric system of forces in an\ninfinite bi-material plane is considered. A boundary integral formulation is\nderived using the fundamental reciprocal identity (Betti formula). The\nresulting singular integral equations link the applied loading and the full\nresulting crack displacement profile (not just the displacement jump across the\ncrack). When used in conjunction with previously derived identities, the new\nidentities allow for the full displacement profile to be derived from crack\nface loadings and vice versa.\n", "  A new class of phenomena stemming from topological states of quantum matter\nhas recently found a variety of analogies in classical systems. Spin-locking\nand one-way propagation have been shown to drastically alter our view on\nscattering of electromagnetic waves, thus offering an unprecedented robustness\nto defects and disorder. Despite these successes, bringing these new ideas to\npractical grounds meets a number of serious limitations. In photonics, when it\nis crucial to implement topological photonic devices on a chip, two major\nchallenges are associated with electromagnetic dissipation into heat and\nout-of-plane radiation into free space. Both these mechanisms may destroy the\ntopological state and seriously affect the device performance. Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate that the topological order for light can be\nimplemented in all-dielectric on-chip prototype metasurfaces, which mitigate\nthe effect of Ohmic losses by using exclusively dielectric materials, and\nreveal that coupling of the system to the radiative continuum does not affect\nthe topological properties. Spin-Hall effect of light for spin-polarized\ntopological edge states is revealed through near-field spectroscopy\nmeasurements.\n", "  During accretion, terrestrial bodies attain a wide range of thermal and\nrotational states, which are accompanied by significant changes in physical\nstructure (size, shape, pressure and temperature profile, etc.). However,\nvariations in structure have been neglected in most studies of rocky planet\nformation and evolution. Here, we present a new code, HERCULES, that solves for\nthe equilibrium structure of planets as a series of overlapping\nconstant-density spheroids. Using HERCULES and a smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics code, we show that Earth-like bodies display a dramatic range of\nmorphologies. For any rotating planetary body, there is a thermal limit beyond\nwhich the rotational velocity at the equator intersects the Keplerian orbital\nvelocity. Beyond this corotation limit (CoRoL), a hot planetary body forms a\nstructure, which we name a synestia, with a corotating inner region connected\nto a disk-like outer region. By analyzing calculations of giant impacts and\nmodels of planet formation, we show that typical rocky planets are\nsubstantially vaporized multiple times during accretion. For the expected\nangular momentum of growing planets, a large fraction of post-impact bodies\nwill exceed the CoRoL and form synestias. The common occurrence of hot,\nrotating states during accretion has major implications for planet formation\nand the properties of the final planets. In particular, the structure of\npost-impact bodies influences the physical processes that control accretion,\ncore formation and internal evolution. Synestias also lead to new mechanisms\nfor satellite formation. Finally, the wide variety of possible structures for\nterrestrial bodies also expands the mass-radius range for rocky exoplanets.\n", "  Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are accreting black holes for which their\nX-ray properties have been seen to be different to the case of stellar-mass\nblack hole binaries. For most of the cases their intrinsic energy spectra are\nwell described by a cold accretion disc (thermal) plus a curved high-energy\nemission components. The mass of the black hole (BH) derived from the thermal\ndisc component is usually in the range of 100-1000 solar masses, which have led\nto the idea that this might represent strong evidence of the Intermediate Mass\nBlack Holes (IMBH), proposed to exist by theoretical studies but with no firm\ndetection (as a class) so far. Recent theoretical and observational\ndevelopments are leading towards the idea that these sources are instead\nstellar-mass BHs accreting at an unusual super-Eddington regime. In this paper\nwe briefly describe the model SLIMULX that can be used in XSPEC for the fit of\nthermal spectra of slim discs around stellar mass black holes in the\nsuper-Eddington regime. This model consistently takes all relativistic effects\ninto account. We present the obtained results from the fit of the X-ray spectra\nfrom NGC 5408 X-1.\n", "  The radion scalar field might be the lightest new particle predicted by\nextra-dimensional extensions of the Standard Model, thus possibly leading to\nthe first signatures of new physics at the LHC. We perform a study of its\nproduction in association with a $Z$ boson in the custodially protected warped\nmodel with a brane-localised Higgs boson addressing the gauge hierarchy\nproblem, with Higgs-radion mixing effects included. While the considered radion\nproduction at the LHC would constrain some parts of the parameter space, it is\nonly the ILC program that will be able to cover a significant part of this\nspace through the studied process. Complementary tests of the same theoretical\nparameters can be realised through the high accuracy measurements of the Higgs\ncouplings at ILC.\n", "  We study the synchronization of a small-world network of identical coupled\nphase oscillators with Kuramoto interaction. First, we consider the model with\ninstantaneous mutual interaction and the normalized coupling constant to the\ndegree of each node. For this model, similar to the constant coupling studied\nbefore, we find the existence of various attractors corresponding to the\ndifferent defect patterns and also the noise enhanced synchronization when\ndriven by an external uncorrelated white noise. We also investigate the\nsynchronization of the model with homogenous time-delay in the phase couplings.\nFor a given intrinsic frequency and coupling constant, upon varying the time\ndelay we observe the existence a partially synchronized state with defect\npatterns which transforms to an incoherent phase characterized by randomly\nphase locked states. By further increasing of the time delay, this phase again\nundergoes a transition to another patterned partially synchronized state. We\nshow that the transition between theses phases are discontinuous and moreover\nin each phase the average frequency of the oscillators decreases by increasing\nthe time delay and shows an upward jump at the transition points.\n", "  We study the invariants of spin networks embedded in a three-dimensional\nmanifold which are based on the path integral for SU(2) BF-Theory. These\ninvariants appear naturally in Loop Quantum Gravity, and have been defined as\nspin-foam state sums. By using the Chain-Mail technique, we give a more general\ndefinition of these invariants, and show that the state-sum definition is a\nspecial case. This provides a rigorous proof that the state-sum invariants of\nspin networks are topological invariants. We derive various results about the\nBF-Theory spin network invariants, and we find a relation with the\ncorresponding invariants defined from Chern-Simons Theory, i.e. the\nWitten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. We also prove that the BF-Theory spin\nnetwork invariants coincide with V. Turaev's definition of invariants of\ncoloured graphs embedded in 3-manifolds and thick surfaces, constructed by\nusing shadow-world evaluations. Our framework therefore provides a unified view\nof these invariants.\n", "  We give an interpretation of Yetter's Invariant of manifolds $M$ in terms of\nthe homotopy type of the function space $TOP(M,B(G))$, where $G$ is a crossed\nmodule and $B(G)$ is its classifying space. From this formulation, there\nfollows that Yetter's invariant depends only on the homotopy type of $M$, and\nthe weak homotopy type of the crossed module $G$. We use this interpretation to\ndefine a twisting of Yetter's Invariant by cohomology classes of crossed\nmodules, defined as cohomology classes of their classifying spaces, in the form\nof a state sum invariant. In particular, we obtain an extension of the\nDijkgraaf-Witten Invariant of manifolds to categorical groups. The\nstraightforward extension to crossed complexes is also considered.\n"]}
