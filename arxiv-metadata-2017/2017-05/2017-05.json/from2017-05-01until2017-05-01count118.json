In this direction, we identify the chief economic variables\nand parameters, scalar and vector, which are amenable to be put directly into\nthe crouch of the laws of electrodynamics, namely Maxwell's equations.\nMoreover, we obtain Phillp's curve, recession and Black-Scholes formula, as\nsample applications.\n", "  We introduce a simple model to study movie competition in the recommender\nsystems. Movies of heterogeneous quality compete against each other through\nviewers' reviews and generate interesting dynamics of box-office. By assuming\nmean-field interactions between the competing movies, we show that run-away\neffect of popularity spreading is triggered by defeating the average review\nscore, leading to hits in box-office. The average review score thus\ncharacterizes the critical movie quality necessary for transition from\nbox-office bombs to blockbusters. The major factors affecting the critical\nreview score are examined. By iterating the mean-field dynamical equations, we\nobtain qualitative agreements with simulations and real systems in the\ndynamical forms of box-office, revealing the significant role of competition in\nunderstanding box-office dynamics.\n", "  The influence of an ac current of arbitrary amplitude and frequency on the\nmixed-state dc-voltage-ac-drive ratchet response of a superconducting film with\na dc current-tilted uniaxial cosine pinning potential at finite temperature is\ntheoretically investigated. The results are obtained in the single-vortex\napproximation, i.e., for non-interacting vortices, within the frame of an exact\nsolution of the appropriate Langevin equation in terms of a matrix continued\nfraction. Formulas for the dc voltage ratchet response and absorbed power in ac\nresponse are discussed as functions of ac current amplitude and frequency as\nwell as dc current induced tilt in a wide range of corresponding dimensionless\nparameters. Special attention is paid to the physical interpretation of the\nobtained results in adiabatic and high-frequency ratchet responses taking into\naccount both running and localized states of the (ac+dc)-driven vortex motion\nin a washboard pinning potential. Our theoretical results are discussed in\ncomparison with recent experimental work on the high-frequency ratchet response\nin nanostructured superconducting films [B. B. Jin et al., Phys. Rev. B 81\n(2010) 174505].\n", "  We study the energy diffusion in a chain of anharmonic oscillators where the\nHamiltonian dynamics is perturbed by a local energy conserving noise. We prove\nthat under diffusive rescaling of space-time, energy fluctuations diffuse and\nevolve following an infinite dimensional linear stochastic differential\nequation driven by the linearized heat equation. We also give variational\nexpressions for the thermal diffusivity and some upper and lower bounds.\n", "  The dynamics of horizontal plasma flows during the first hours of the\nemergence of active region magnetic flux in the solar photosphere have been\nanalyzed using SOHO/MDI data. Four active regions emerging near the solar limb\nhave been considered. It has been found that extended regions of Doppler\nvelocities with different signs are formed in the first hours of the magnetic\nflux emergence in the horizontal velocity field. The flows observed are\ndirectly connected with the emerging magnetic flux; they form at the beginning\nof the emergence of active regions and are present for a few hours. The Doppler\nvelocities of flows observed increase gradually and reach their peak values\n4-12 hours after the start of the magnetic flux emergence. The peak values of\nthe mean (inside the +/-500 m/s isolines) and maximum Doppler velocities are\n800-970 m/s and 1410-1700 m/s, respectively. The Doppler velocities observed\nsubstantially exceed the separation velocities of the photospheric magnetic\nflux outer boundaries. The asymmetry was detected between velocity structures\nof leading and following polarities. Doppler velocity structures located in a\nregion of leading magnetic polarity are more powerful and exist longer than\nthose in regions of following polarity. The Doppler velocity asymmetry between\nthe velocity structures of opposite sign reaches its peak values soon after the\nemergence begins and then gradually drops within 7-12 hours. The peak values of\nasymmetry for the mean and maximal Doppler velocities reach 240-460 m/s and\n710-940 m/s, respectively. An interpretation of the observable flow of\nphotospheric plasma is given.\n", "  A statistical study has been carried out of the relationship between plasma\nflow Doppler velocities and magnetic field parameters during the emergence of\nactive regions at the solar photospheric level with data acquired by the\nMichelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory\n(SOHO). We have investigated 224 emerging active regions with different spatial\nscales and positions on the solar disc. The following relationships for the\nfirst hours of the emergence of active regions have been analysed: i) of peak\nnegative Doppler velocities with the position of the emerging active regions on\nthe solar disc; ii) of peak plasma upflow and downflow Doppler velocities with\nthe magnetic flux growth rate and magnetic field strength for the active\nregions emerging near the solar disc centre (the vertical component of plasma\nflows); iii) of peak positive and negative Doppler velocities with the magnetic\nflux growth rate and magnetic field strength for the active regions emerging\nnear the limb (the horizontal component of plasma flows); iv) of the magnetic\nflux growth rate with the density of emerging magnetic flux; v) of the Doppler\nvelocities and magnetic field parameters for the first hours of the appearance\nof active regions with the total unsigned magnetic flux at the maximum of their\ndevelopment.\n", "  The mixed-state resistive response of a superconductor thin film with an\nasymmetric washboard pinning potential subject to superimposed dc and ac\ncurrents of arbitrary amplitudes and frequency at finite temperature is\ntheoretically investigated. The problem is considered in the single-vortex\napproximation, relying upon the exact solution of the Langevin equation in\nterms of a matrix continued fraction. The dc voltage response and the absorbed\npower in ac response are analyzed as functions of dc bias, ac current amplitude\nand frequency, in a wide range of corresponding dimensionless parameters.\nPredictions are made of (i) a reversal of the rectified voltage at small dc\nbiases and strong ac drives and (ii) a non-monotonic enhancement of the\nabsorbed power in the nonlinear ac response at far sub-depinning frequencies.\nIt is elucidated how and why both these effects appear due to the competition\nof the fixed internal and the tunable, dc bias-induced external asymmetry of\nthe potential as the only reason. This is distinct from other scenarios used\nfor explaining the vortex ratchet reversal effect so far.\n", "  Nanomagnetic memory and logic are currently seen as promising candidates to\nreplace current digital computing architectures due to its superior\nenergy-efficiency, non-volatility and propensity for highly dense and low-power\napplications. In this work, we investigate the use of shape engineering\n(concave and diamond shape) to introduce biaxial anisotropy in single domain\nnanomagnets, giving rise to multiple easy and hard axes. Such nanomagnets, with\ndimensions of 100 nm x 100 nm, double the logic density of conventional\ntwo-state nanomagnetic devices by encoding more information (four binary\nbits:00,11,10,01) per nanomagnet and can be used in memory and logic devices as\nwell as in higher order information processing applications. We study\nreliability, magnetization switching coherence, and show, for the first time,\nthe use of voltage-induced strain for the clocking of magnetization in these\nfour-state nanomagnets. Critical parameters such as size, thickness, concavity,\nand geometry of two types of four-state nanomagnets are also investigated. This\nanalytical study provides important insights into achieving reliable and\ncoherent single domain nanomagnets and low-energy magnetization clocking in\nfour-state nanomagnets, paving the way for potential applications in advanced\ntechnologies.\n", "  The first limits on the prompt emission from the long gamma-ray burst (GRB)\n130427A in the $>100\\nobreakspace\\rm{GeV}$ energy band are reported. GRB\n130427A was the most powerful burst ever detected with a redshift\n$z\\lesssim0.5$ and featured the longest lasting emission above\n$100\\nobreakspace\\rm{MeV}$. The energy spectrum extends at least up to\n$95\\nobreakspace\\rm{GeV}$, clearly in the range observable by the High Altitude\nWater Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-ray Observatory, a new extensive air shower\ndetector currently under construction in central Mexico. The burst occurred\nunder unfavourable observation conditions, low in the sky and when HAWC was\nrunning 10% of the final detector. Based on the observed light curve at MeV-GeV\nenergies, eight different time periods have been searched for prompt and\ndelayed emission from this GRB. In all cases, no statistically significant\nexcess of counts has been found and upper limits have been placed. It is shown\nthat a similar GRB close to zenith would be easily detected by the full HAWC\ndetector, which will be completed soon. The detection rate of the full HAWC\ndetector may be as high as one to two GRBs per year. A detection could provide\nimportant information regarding the high energy processes at work and the\nobservation of a possible cut-off beyond the $\\mathit{Fermi}$-LAT energy range\ncould be the signature of gamma-ray absorption, either in the GRB or along the\nline of sight due to the extragalactic background light.\n", "  We develop a new method to isolate localized defects from extended\nvibrational modes in disordered solids. This method augments particle\ninteractions with an artificial potential that acts as a high-pass filter: it\npreserves small-scale structures while pushing extended vibrational modes to\nhigher frequencies. The low-frequency modes that remain are \"bare\" defects;\nthey are exponentially localized without the quadrupolar tails associated with\nelastic interactions. We demonstrate that these localized excitations are\nexcellent predictors of plastic rearrangements in the solid. We characterize\nseveral of the properties of these defects that appear in mesoscopic theory of\nplasticity, including their distribution of energy barriers, number density,\nand size, which is a first step in testing and revising continuum models for\nplasticity in disordered solids.\n", "  Combined microwave and dc electrical transport measurements at low\ntemperatures represent a valuable experimental method in many research areas.\nIn particular, when samples are conventional superconductors, a typical\nexperiment requires a combination of helium temperatures, a wide range of\nmagnetic fields, and the utilization of coaxial lines along with the usual dc\nwiring. We report on the general design features and the microwave performance\nof a custom-made low-temperature sample probe, with a measurement bandwidth\ntested from dc to 20 GHz. Equipped with 6 coaxial cables, a heater, Hall and\ntemperature sensors, the probe fits into a d32 mm shaft. We present our setup,\nanalyze its microwave performance, and describe two representative experiments\nenabled by this system. The proposed setup will be essential for a systematic\nstudy of the dc and ac response of the vortex dynamics in nanopatterned\nsuperconductors subject to combined dc and microwave stimuli. Besides, it will\nbe valuable for the investigation of a broad class of nonlinear stochastic\nsystems where a combination of dc and high-frequency ac driving in a wide\ntemperature range is necessary.\n", "  We present a dual cut-off, dc-tunable low-pass microwave filter on a\nsuperconducting Nb microstrip with uniaxial asymmetric nanogrooves. The\nfrequency response of the device was measured in the range $300$\\,KHz to\n$14$\\,GHz at different temperatures, magnetic fields, and dc current values.\nThe microwave loss is most effectively reduced when the Abrikosov vortex\nlattice spatially matches the underlying washboard pinning landscape. The\nforward transmission coefficient $S_{21}(f)$ of the microstrip has a dc-tunable\ncut-off frequency $f_d$ which notably changes under dc bias reversal, due to\nthe two different slope steepnesses of the pinning landscape. The device's\noperation principle relies upon a crossover from the weakly dissipative\nresponse of vortices at low frequencies when they are driven over the grooves,\nto the strongly dissipative response at high frequencies when the vortices are\noscillating within one groove. The filter's cut-off frequency is the vortex\ndepinning frequency tunable by the dc bias as it diminishes the pinning effect\ninduced by the nanopattern. The reported results unveil an advanced microwave\nfunctionality of superconducting films with asymmetric (ratchet) pinning\nlandscapes and are relevant for tuning the microwave loss in superconducting\nplanar transmission lines.\n", "  Controlling magnetic properties on the nm-scale is essential for basic\nresearch in micro-magnetism and spin-dependent transport, as well as for\nvarious applications such as magnetic recording, imaging and sensing. This has\nbeen accomplished to a very high degree by means of layered heterostructures in\nthe vertical dimension. Here we present a complementary approach that allows\nfor a controlled tuning of the magnetic properties of Co/Pt heterostructures on\nthe lateral mesoscale. By means of in-situ post-processing of Pt- and Co-based\nnano-stripes prepared by focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) we\nare able to locally tune their coercive field and remanent magnetization.\nWhereas single Co-FEBID nano-stripes show no hysteresis, we find hard-magnetic\nbehavior for post-processed Co/Pt nano-stripes with coercive fields up to 850\nOe. We attribute the observed effects to the locally controlled formation of\nthe CoPt L1$_{0}$ phase, whose presence has been revealed by transmission\nelectron microscopy.\n", "  In the majority of cases nanostructures prepared by focused electron beam\ninduced deposition (FEBID) employing an organometallic precursor contain\npredominantly carbon-based ligand dissociation products. This is unfortunate\nwith regard to using this high-resolution direct-write approach for the\npreparation of nanostructures for various fields, such as mesoscopic physics,\nmicromagnetism, electronic correlations, spin-dependent transport and numerous\napplications. Here we present an in-situ cleaning approach to obtain pure\nCo-FEBID nanostructures. The purification procedure lies in the exposure of\nheated samples to a H$_2$ atmosphere in conjunction with the irradiation by\nlow-energy electrons. The key finding is that the combination of annealing at\n$300^\\circ$C, H$_2$ exposure and electron irradiation leads to compact, carbon-\nand oxygen free Co layers down to a thickness of about 20\\,nm starting from\nas-deposited Co-FEBID structures. In addition to this, in temperature-dependent\nelectrical resistance measurements on post-processed samples we find a typical\nmetallic behavior. In low-temperature magneto-resistance and Hall effect\nmeasurements we observe ferromagnetic behavior.\n", "  Duan and Winter studied the one-shot zero-error classical capacity of a\nquantum channel assisted by quantum non-signalling correlations, and formulated\nthis problem as a semidefinite program depending only on the Kraus operator\nspace of the channel. For the class of classical-quantum channels, they showed\nthat the asymptotic zero-error classical capacity assisted by quantum\nnon-signalling correlations, minimized over all classical-quantum channels with\na confusability graph $G$, is exactly $\\log \\vartheta(G)$, where $\\vartheta(G)$\nis the celebrated Lov\\'{a}sz theta function. In this paper, we show that the\none-shot capacity for a classical-quantum channel, induced from a circulant\ngraph $G$ defined by equal-sized cyclotomic cosets, is $\\log \\lfloor\n\\vartheta(G) \\rfloor$, which further implies that its asymptotic capacity is\n$\\log \\vartheta(G)$. This type of graphs include the cycle graphs of odd\nlength, the Paley graphs of prime vertices, and the cubit residue graphs of\nprime vertices. Examples of other graphs are also discussed. This endows the\nLov\\'{a}sz $\\theta$ function with a more straightforward operational meaning.\n", "  In order to clarify a possible role of small-scale dynamo in formation of\nsolar magnetic field, we suggest an observational test for small-scale dynamo\naction based on statistics of anti-Hale sunspot groups. As we have shown,\naccording to theoretical expectations the small-scale dynamo action has to\nprovide a population of sunspot groups which do not follow the Hale polarity\nlaw, and the density of such groups on the time-latitude diagram is expected to\nbe independent on the phase of the solar cycle. Correspondingly, a percentage\nof the anti-Hale groups is expected to reach its maximum values during solar\nminima. For several solar cycles, we considered statistics of anti-Hale groups\nobtained by several scientific teams, including ours, to find that the\npercentage of anti-Hale groups becomes indeed maximal during a solar minimum.\nOur interpretation is that this fact may be explained by the small-scale dynamo\naction inside the solar convective zone.\n", "  Random Phase Approximation (RPA) is the basic method for calculation of\nexcited states of nuclei over the Hartree-Fock ground state, suitable also for\nenergy density functionals (EDF or DFT). We developed a convenient formalism\nfor expressing densities and currents in a form of reduced matrix elements,\nwhich allows fast calculation of spectra for spherical nuclei. All terms of\nSkyrme functional were taken into account, so it is possible to calculate\nelectric, magnetic and vortical/toroidal/compression transitions and strength\nfunctions of any multipolarity. Time-odd (spin) terms in Skyrme functional\nbecome important for magnetic M1 and isovector toroidal E1 transitions. It was\nalso found that transition currents in pygmy region (low-lying part of E1\nresonance) exhibit isoscalar toroidal flow, so the previously assumed picture\nof neutron-skin vibration is not the only mechanism present in pygmy\ntransitions.\n  RPA calculations with heavy axially-symmetric nuclei now become feasible on\nordinary PC. Detailed formulae for axial Skyrme RPA are given. Some numerical\nresults are shown in comparison with the approximate approach of separable RPA,\npreviously developed in our group for fast calculation of strength functions.\n", "  We introduce a fluxonic metamaterial on the basis of nanopatterned\nsuperconducting Nb microstrips and employ it for modulation and synthesis of\nquantized loss levels in the lower GHz range by a sine-wave quasistatic ac\ndrive. The nanopatterns are uniaxial nanogrooves with identical and different\nslope steepness, which induce a pinning potential of the washboard type for\nAbrikosov vortices. For the fundamental matching field, when the location of\nvortex rows geometrically matches the nanogrooves, the following effects are\nobserved: The forward transmission coefficient $S_{21}(f)$ of the microstrips\ncan be controllably modulated within a range of about $3$\\,dB by the ac\ncurrent. For the sample with symmetric grooves, depending on the choice of the\noperation point in the current-voltage curve, the shape and the duty cycle of\nthe output signal can be tuned. For the sample with asymmetric grooves,\ndepending on the ac amplitude, a sine-to-triangular or a sine-to-rectangular\npulse shape conversion is observed. The possibility of synthesizing quantized\nloss levels by a serial connection of the two samples with different\nnanopatterns is exemplified and can be used for the development of multilevel\nexcess-loss-based fluxonic devices.\n", "  The abundance of clusters of galaxies is known to be a potential source of\ncosmological constraints through their mass function. In the present work, we\nexamine the information that can be obtained from the temperature distribution\nfunction of X-ray clusters. For this purpose, the mass-temperature ($M$-$T$)\nrelation and its statistical properties are critical ingredients. Using a\ncombination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and our\nestimations of X-ray cluster abundances, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\ntechniques to estimate the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters and the mass to\nX-ray temperature scaling relation simultaneously. We determine the integrated\nX-ray temperature function of local clusters using flux-limited surveys. A\nlocal comprehensive sample was build from the BAX X-ray cluster database,\nallowing us to estimate the local temperature distribution function above\n$\\sim$1 keV. We model the expected temperature function from the mass function\nand the $M$-$T$ scaling relation. We then estimate the cosmological parameters\nand the parameters of the $M$-$T$ relation (calibration and slope)\nsimultaneously. The measured temperature function of local clusters in the\nrange $\\sim\\!\\!1$-$10$ keV is well reproduced once the calibration of the\n$M$-$T$ relation is treated as a free parameter, and therefore is\nself-consistent with respect to the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The best-fit values\nof the standard cosmological parameters as well as their uncertainties are\nunchanged by the addition of clusters data. The calibration of the mass\ntemperature relation, as well as its slope, are determined with $\\sim10\\%$\nstatistical uncertainties. This calibration leads to masses that are\n$\\sim\\!\\!75\\%$ larger than X-ray masses used in Planck.\n", "  Abrikosov fluxonics, a domain of science and engineering at the interface of\nsuperconductivity research and nanotechnology, is concerned with the study of\nproperties and dynamics of Abrikosov vortices in nanopatterned superconductors,\nwith particular focus on their confinement, manipulation, and exploitation for\nemerging functionalities. Vortex pinning, guided vortex motion, and the ratchet\neffect are three main fluxonic ``tools'' which allow for the dynamical (pinned\nor moving), the directional (angle-dependent), and the orientational (current\npolarity-sensitive) control over the fluxons, respectively. Thanks to the\nperiodicity of the vortex lattice, several groups of effects emerge when the\nvortices move in a periodic pinning landscape: Spatial commensurability of the\nlocation of vortices with the underlying pinning nanolandscape leads to a\nreduction of the dc resistance and the microwave loss at the so-called matching\nfields. Temporal synchronization of the displacement of vortices with the\nnumber of pinning sites visited during one half ac cycle manifests itself as\nShapiro steps in the current-voltage curves. Delocalization of vortices\noscillating under the action of a high-frequency ac drive can be tuned by a\nsuperimposed dc bias. In this short review a choice of experimental results on\nthe vortex dynamics in the presence of periodic pinning in Nb thin films is\npresented. The consideration is limited to one particular type of artificial\npinning structures --- directly written nanolandscapes of the washboard type,\nwhich are fabricated by focused ion beam milling and focused electron beam\ninduced deposition. The reported results are relevant for the development of\nfluxonic devices and the reduction of microwave losses in superconducting\nplanar transmission lines.\n", "  A generic prediction of quantum gravity is the vacuum dispersion of light,\nand hence that a photon's speed depends on its energy. We present further\nnumerical evidence for a scale dependent speed of light in the causal dynamical\ntriangulation (CDT) approach to quantum gravity. We show that the observed\nscale dependent speed of light in CDT can be accounted for by a scale dependent\ntransformation of geodesic distance, whose specific functional form implies a\ndiscrete equidistant area spectrum. We make two non-trivial tests of the\nproposed scale transformation: a comparison with the leading order quantum\ncorrection to the gravitational potential and a comparison with the generalised\nuncertainty principle. In both cases, we obtain the same functional form.\nHowever, contrary to the widespread prediction of vacuum dispersion in quantum\ngravity, numerous experiments have now definitively ruled out linear vacuum\ndispersion beyond Planckian energy scales, and have now even constrained\nquadratic dispersion. Motivated by these experimental constraints we seek to\nreconcile quantum gravity with the absence of vacuum dispersion. We point out\nthat given a scale dependent geodesic distance, a scale dependent time interval\nbecomes essential to maintaining an invariant speed of light. We show how a\nparticular scale dependent time interval allows a photon's speed to remain\nindependent of its energy.\n", "  We demonstrate a novel procedure to calibrate neutron detection systems\ncommonly used in standard neutron radiography. This calibration allows\ndetermining the uncertainties due to Poisson-like neutron counting statistics\nfor each individual pixel of a radiographic image. The obtained statistical\nerrors are necessary in order to perform a correct quantitative analysis. This\nfast and convenient method is applied to data measured at the cold neutron\nradiography facility ICON at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Moreover, from the\nresults the effective neutron flux at the beam line is determined.\n", "  Recently, it was proposed that a small true vacuum universe can inflate\nspontaneously, in principle. Furthermore, there should be matter creation in\nvacuum inflation due to quantum fluctuations, and the matter created will\ninfluence the inflation simultaneously. In this paper, scalar and tensor\nperturbations in this model are analyzed and confronted with recent\nobservations. These perturbations are derived and expressed with Hubble\nflow-functions. By comparing our calculations with experimental results, we can\ndetermine all the parameters in this model. Finally, with the determined\nparameters, we compute the evolution of the matter density and show that the\nmatter produced in inflation roughly fits the observations at present.\n", "  We discuss the cosmological reconstruction of\n$f(R,R_{\\alpha\\beta}R^{\\alpha\\beta},\\phi)$ (where $R$,\n$R_{\\alpha\\beta}R^{\\alpha\\beta}$ and $\\phi$ represents the Ricci scalar, Ricci\ninvariant and scalar field) corresponding to power law and de Sitter evolution\nin the framework of FRW universe model. We derive the energy conditions for\nthis modified theory which seem to be more general and can be reduced to some\nknown forms of these conditions in general relativity, $f(R)$ and $f(R,\\phi)$\ntheories. We have presented the general constraints in terms of recent values\nof snap, jerk, deceleration and Hubble parameters. The energy bounds are\nanalyzed for reconstructed as well as known models in this theory. Finally, the\nfree parameters are analyzed comprehensively.\n", "  We study spectral Galerkin approximations of an Allen--Cahn equation over the\ntwo-dimensional torus perturbed by weak space-time white noise of strength\n$\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$. We introduce a Wick renormalisation of the equation in\norder to have a system that is well-defined as the regularisation is removed.\nWe show sharp upper and lower bounds on the transition times from a\nneighbourhood of the stable configuration $-1$ to the stable configuration $1$\nin the asymptotic regime $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. These estimates are uniform in\nthe discretisation parameter $N$, suggesting an Eyring-Kramers formula for the\nlimiting renormalised stochastic PDE. The effect of the \"infinite\nrenormalisation\" is to modify the prefactor and to replace the ratio of\ndeterminants in the finite-dimensional Eyring-Kramers law by a renormalised\nCarleman-Fredholm determinant.\n", "  We present parity measurements on a five-qubit lattice with connectivity\namenable to the surface code quantum error correction architecture. Using\nall-microwave controls of superconducting qubits coupled via resonators, we\nencode the parities of four data qubit states in either the $X$- or the\n$Z$-basis. Given the connectivity of the lattice, we perform full\ncharacterization of the static $Z$-interactions within the set of five qubits,\nas well as dynamical $Z$-interactions brought along by single- and two-qubit\nmicrowave drives. The parity measurements are significantly improved by\nmodifying the microwave two-qubit gates to dynamically remove non-ideal $Z$\nerrors.\n", "  An algorithm that initializes a quantum register to a state with a specified\nenergy range is given, corresponding to a quantum implementation of the\ncelebrated Feit-Fleck method. This is performed by introducing a\nnondeterministic quantum implementation of a standard spectral filtering\nprocedure combined with an apodization technique, allowing for accurate state\ninitialization. It is shown that the implementation requires only two ancilla\nqubits. A lower bound for the total probability of success of this algorithm is\nderived, showing that this scheme can be realized using a finite, relatively\nlow number of trials. Assuming the time evolution can be performed efficiently\nand using a trial state polynomially close to the desired states, it is\ndemonstrated that the number of operations required scales polynomially with\nthe number of qubits. Tradeoffs between accuracy and performance are\ndemonstrated in a simple example: the harmonic oscillator. This algorithm would\nbe useful for the initialization phase of the simulation of quantum systems on\ndigital quantum computers.\n", "  Within density-functional theory, the local-density approximation (LDA)\ncorrelation functional is typically built by fitting the difference between the\nnear-exact and Hartree-Fock (HF) energies of the uniform electron gas (UEG),\ntogether with analytic perturbative results from the high- and low-density\nregimes. Near-exact energies are obtained by performing accurate diffusion\nMonte Carlo calculations, while HF energies are usually assumed to be the Fermi\nfluid HF energy. However, it has been known since the seminal work of\nOverhauser that one can obtain lower, symmetry-broken (SB) HF energies at any\ndensity. Here, we have computed the SBHF energies of the one-dimensional UEG\nand constructed a SB version of the LDA (SBLDA) from the results. We compare\nthe performance of the LDA and SBLDA functionals when applied to\none-dimensional systems, including atoms and molecules. Generalization to\nhigher dimensions is also discussed.\n", "  We formulate and validate a finite element approach to the propagation of a\nslowly decaying electromagnetic wave, called surface plasmon-polariton, excited\nalong a conducting sheet, e.g., a single-layer graphene sheet, by an electric\nHertzian dipole. By using a suitably rescaled form of time-harmonic Maxwell's\nequations, we derive a variational formulation that enables a direct numerical\ntreatment of the associated class of boundary value problems by appropriate\ncurl-conforming finite elements. The conducting sheet is modeled as an\nidealized hypersurface with an effective electric conductivity. The requisite\nweak discontinuity for the tangential magnetic field across the hypersurface\ncan be incorporated naturally into the variational formulation. We carry out\nnumerical simulations for an infinite sheet with constant isotropic\nconductivity embedded in two spatial dimensions; and validate our numerics\nagainst the closed-form exact solution obtained by the Fourier transform in the\ntangential coordinate. Numerical aspects of our treatment such as an absorbing\nperfectly matched layer, as well as local refinement and a-posteriori error\ncontrol are discussed.\n", "  A systematic method to derive the Hamiltonian and Nambu form for the shallow\nwater equations, using the conservation for energy and potential enstrophy, is\npresented. Different mechanisms, such as vortical flows and emission of gravity\nwaves, emerge from different conservation laws (CLs) for total energy and\npotential enstrophy. The equations are constructed using exterior differential\nforms and self-adjoint operators and result in the sum of two Nambu brackets,\none for the vortical flow and one for the wave-mean flow interaction, and a\nPoisson bracket representing the interaction between divergence and geostrophic\nimbalance. The advantage of this approach is that the Hamiltonian and Nambu\nforms can be here written in a coordinate independent form.\n", "  We consider a two dimensional random band matrix ensemble, in the limit of\ninfinite volume and fixed but large band width $W$. For this model we\nrigorously prove smoothness of the averaged density of states. We also prove\nthat the resulting expression coincides with Wigner's semicircle law with a\nprecision $W^{-2+\\delta },$ where $\\delta\\to 0$ when $W\\to \\infty.$ The proof\nuses the supersymmetric approach and extends results by Disertori, Pinson and\nSpencer from three to two dimensions.\n", "  We report the direct virtual photon invariant yields in the transverse\nmomentum ranges $1\\!<\\!p_{T}\\!<\\!3$ GeV/$c$ and $5\\!<\\!p_T\\!<\\!10$ GeV/$c$ at\nmid-rapidity derived from the dielectron invariant mass continuum region\n$0.10<M_{ee}<0.28$ GeV/$c^{2}$ for 0-80\\% minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. A clear excess in the invariant yield compared to the\nnumber-of-binary-collisions ($N_{bin}$) scaled $p+p$ reference is observed in\nthe $p_T$ range $1\\!<\\!p_{T}\\!<\\!3$ GeV/$c$. For $p_T\\!>6$ GeV/$c$ the\nproduction follows $N_{bin}$ scaling. Model calculations with contributions\nfrom thermal radiation and initial hard parton scattering are consistent within\nuncertainties with the direct virtual photon invariant yield.\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional periodic Schr\\\"odinger operator $H=-\\Delta+W$\nwith $\\Gamma$ being the lattice of periods. We investigate the structure of the\nedges of open gaps in the spectrum of $H$. We show that under arbitrary small\nperturbation $V$ periodic with respect to $N\\Gamma$ where $N=N(W)$ is some\ninteger, all edges of the gaps in the spectrum of $H+V$ which are perturbation\nof the gaps of $H$ become non-degenerate, i.e. are attained at finitely many\npoints by one band function only and have non-degenerate quadratic\nminimum/maximum. We also discuss this problem in the discrete setting and show\nthat changing the lattice of periods may indeed be unavoidable to achieve the\nnon-degeneracy.\n", "  We consider a quantum generalization of the classical heat equation, and\nstudy contractivity properties of its associated semigroup. We prove a Nash\ninequality and a logarithmic Sobolev inequality. The former leads to an\nultracontractivity result. This in turn implies that the largest eigenvalue and\nthe purity of a state with positive Wigner function, evolving under the action\nof the semigroup, decrease at least inverse polynomially in time, while its\nentropy increases at least logarithmically in time.\n", "  We consider a truncation of type IIB supergravity on four-torus where in\naddition to the Ramond-Ramond 2-form field, the Ramond-Ramond axion (w) and the\nNS-NS 2-form field (B) are also retained. In the (w, B) sector we construct a\nlinearised perturbation carrying only left moving momentum on two-charge\nnon-extremal D1-D5 geometries of Jejjala, Madden, Ross and Titchener. The\nperturbation is found to be smooth everywhere and normalizable. It is\nconstructed by matching to leading order solutions of the perturbation\nequations in the inner and outer regions of the geometry.\n", "  In this work we study the Dirac equation with vector and scalar potentials in\nthe spacetime generated by a cosmic string. Using an approximation for the\ncentrifugal term, a solution for the radial differential equation is obtained.\nWe consider the scattering states under the Hulth\\'{e}n potential and obtain\nthe phase shifts. From the poles of the scattering $S$-matrix the states\nenergies are determined as well.\n", "  Two-photon photoacoustic tomography (TP-PAT) is a non-invasive optical\nmolecular imaging modality that aims at inferring two-photon absorption\nproperty of heterogeneous media from photoacoustic measurements. In this work,\nwe analyze an inverse problem in quantitative TP-PAT where we intend to\nreconstruct optical coefficients in a semilinear elliptic PDE, the mathematical\nmodel for the propagation of near infra-red photons in tissue-like optical\nmedia with two-photon absorption, from the internal absorbed energy data. We\nderive uniqueness and stability results on the reconstructions of single and\nmultiple optical coefficients, and present some numerical reconstruction\nresults based on synthetic data to complement the theoretical analysis.\n", "  The main result of this paper is that conditional measures of generalized\nGinibre point processes, with respect to the configuration in the complement of\na bounded open subset on $\\mathbb{C}$, are orthogonal polynomial ensembles with\nweights found explicitly. An especially simple formula for conditional measures\nis obtained in the particular case of radially-symmetric determinantal point\nprocesses, including the classical Ginibre point process.\n", "  We investigate and provide optimal sets of reaction coordinates for mixed\npairs of molecules displaying polar, uniaxial, or spherical symmetry in two and\nthree dimensions. These coordinates are non-redundant, i.e., they implicitly\ninvolve the molecules' symmetries. By tabulating pair interactions in these\ncoordinates, resulting tables are thus minimal in length and require a minimal\nmemory space. The intended fields of application are computer simulations of\nlarge ensembles of molecules or colloids with rather complex interactions in a\nfluid or liquid crystalline phase at low densities. Using effective\ninteractions directly in the form of tables can help bridging the time and\nlength scales without introducing errors stemming from any modeling procedure.\nFinally, we outline an exemplary computational methodology for gaining an\neffective pair potential in these coordinates, based on the Boltzmann inversion\nprinciple, by providing a step-by-step recipe.\n", "  In this note we propose an approach for a fast analytic determination of all\npossible eigenstates of rational GL(N|M) integrable spin chains of given not\ntoo large length, in terms of Baxter Q-functions. We observe that all\nexceptional solutions, if any, are automatically correctly accounted.\n  The key intuition behind the approach is that the equations on the\nQ-functions are determined solely by the Young diagram, and not by the choice\nof the rank of the GL symmetry. Hence we can choose arbitrary N and M that\naccommodate the desired representation. Then we consider all distinguished\nQ-functions at once, not only those following a certain Kac-Dynkin path.\n", "  The security analysis of quantum key distribution is difficult to perform\nwhen there is efficiency mismatch between various threshold detectors involved\nin an experimental setup. Even the verification that the device actually\nperforms in the quantum domain, referred to as the task of entanglement\nverification, is hard to perform. In this article we provide such an\nentanglement-verification method for characterized detection-efficiency\nmismatch. Our method does not rely on a cut-off of photon numbers in the\noptical signal. It can be applied independently of the degrees of freedom\ninvolved, thus covering, for example, efficiency mismatch in polarization and\ntime-bin modes, but also in spatial modes. The evaluation of typical\nexperimental scenarios suggests that an increase of detection-efficiency\nmismatch will drive the performance of a given setup out of the quantum domain.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the Hawking radiation of a kappa-deformed\nSchwarzchild black hole and obtain the deformed Hawking temperature. For this,\nwe first derive deformed metric for the kappa-spacetime, which in the generic\ncase, is not a symmetric tensor and also has a momentum dependence. We show\nthat the Schwarzchild metric obtained in the kappa-deformed spacetime has a\ndependence on energy. We use the fact that the deformed metric is conformally\nflat in the 1+1 dimensions, to solve the kappa-deformed Klein-Gordon equation\nin the background of the Schwarzchild metric. The method of Boguliobov\ncoefficients is then used to calculate the thermal spectrum of\nkappa-deformed-Schwarzchild black hole and show that the Hawking temperature is\nmodified by the non-commutativity of the kappa-spacetime.\n", "  The theoretical understanding of the nematic state of iron-based\nsuperconductors and especially of FeSe is still a puzzling problem. Although a\nnumber of experiments calls for a prominent role of local correlations and\nplace iron superconductors at the entrance of a Hund metal state, the effect of\nthe electronic correlations on the nematic state has been theoretically poorly\ninvestigated. In this work we study the nematic phase of iron superconductors\naccounting for local correlations, including the effect of the Hund's coupling.\nWe show that Hund's physics strongly affects the nematic properties of the\nsystem. It severely constraints the precise nature of the feasible\norbital-ordered state and induces a differentiation in the effective masses of\nthe zx=yz orbitals in the nematic phase. The latter effect leads to distinctive\nsignatures in different experimental probes, so far overlooked in the\ninterpretation of experiments. As notable examples the splittings between zx\nand yz bands at Gamma and M points are modified, with important consequences\nfor ARPES measurements.\n", "  Extraordinary electronic phases can form in artificial oxide\nheterostructures, which will provide a fertile ground for new physics and also\ngive rise to novel device functions. Based on a systematic first-principles\ndensity functional theory study of the magnetic and electronic properties of\nthe (111) superlattices (ABO3)2/(AB'O3)10 of 4d and 5d transition metal\nperovskite (B = Ru, Rh, Ag, Re, Os, Ir, Au; AB'O3 = LaAlO3, SrTiO3), we\ndemonstrate that due to quantum confinement, bilayers (LaBO3)2 (B = Ru, Re, Os)\nand (SrBO3)2 (B = Rh, Os, Ir) are ferromagnetic with ordering temperatures up\nto room temperature. In particular, bilayer (LaOsO3)2 is an exotic\nspin-polarized quantum anomalous Hall insulator, while the other ferromagnetic\nbilayers are metallic with large Hall conductances comparable to the\nconductance quantum. Furthermore, bilayers (LaRuO3)2 and (SrRhO3)2 are\nhalf-metallic, while bilayer (SrIrO3)2 exhibits peculiar colossal magnetic\nanisotropy. Our findings thus show that 4d and 5d metal perovskite (111)\nbilayers are a class of quasi-two-dimensional materials for exploring exotic\nquantum phases and also for advanced applications such as low-power\nnanoelectronics and oxide spintronics.\n", "  We consider super-Earth sized planets which have a water mass fraction that\nis large enough to form an external mantle composed of high pressure water ice\npolymorphs and that lack a substantial H/He atmosphere. We consider such\nplanets in their habitable zone so that their outermost condensed mantle is a\nglobal deep liquid ocean. For these ocean planets we investigate potential\ninternal reservoirs of CO2; the amount of CO2 dissolved in the ocean for the\nvarious saturation conditions encountered, and the ocean-atmosphere exchange\nflux of CO2. We find that in steady state the abundance of CO2 in the\natmosphere has two possible states. When the wind-driven circulation is the\ndominant CO2 exchange mechanism, an atmosphere of tens of bars of CO2 results,\nwhere the exact value depends on the subtropical ocean surface temperature and\nthe deep ocean temperature. When sea-ice formation, acting on these planets as\na CO2 deposition mechanism, is the dominant exchange mechanism, an atmosphere\nof a few bars of CO2 is established. The exact value depends on the subpolar\nsurface temperature. Our results suggest the possibility of a negative feedback\nmechanism, unique to water planets, where a reduction in the subpolar\ntemperature drives more CO2 into the atmosphere to increase the greenhouse\neffect.\n", "  We used the \"primary dataset\" of Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) to search for\nparallax measurements of central stars (CSs) of Galactic planetary nebulae\n(PNe), to determine PN distances. We found that a trigonometric parallax is\navailable for 16 CSs, seven of which with relative uncertainty below 80%. The\nlimited comparison of these trigonometric distances to other reliable\nindividual determinations discloses good correlation between the two sets, with\nthe Gaia parallax distances being lower by a factor of ~0.1 dex in the\nlogarithmic distances. We tested with the Gaia parallaxes the most popular\nGalactic PN distance scales, namely, the physical radius vs. surface\nbrightness, and the ionized mass vs. inverse optical thickness scales. While\nthe number of available calibrators may still be too low, and their relative\nuncertainties too high, to derive a working distance scale, we were able to\nassess the current sample and to reveal the very promising potential of the\nfuture Gaia releases for a recalibration of the distance scale of Galactic PNe.\n", "  We show that in the isentropic scenario the first order thermodynamical\nparticle creation model gives an emergent universe solution even when the\nchemical potential is non-zero. However there exists no emergent universe\nscenario in the second order non-equilibrium theory for the particle creation\nmodel. We then point out a correspondence between the particle creation model\nwith barotropic equation of state and the equation of state giving rise to an\nemergent universe without particle creation in spatially flat FRW cosmology.\n", "  We address the theory of the coupled lattice and magnetization dynamics of\nfreely suspended single-domain nanoparticles. Magnetic anisotropy generates\nlow-frequency satellite peaks in the microwave absorption spectrum and a\nblueshift of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency. The low-frequency\nresonances are very sharp with maxima exceeding that of the FMR, because their\nmagnetic and mechanical precessions are locked, thereby suppressing Gilbert\ndamping. Magnetic nanoparticles can operate as nearly ideal motors that convert\nelectromagnetic into mechanical energy. The Barnett/Einstein-de Haas effect is\nsignificant even in the absence of a net rotation.\n", "  We refine the statement of the denominator and evaluation conjectures for\naffine Macdonald polynomials proposed by Etingof-Kirillov Jr. and prove the\nfirst non-trivial cases of these conjectures. Our results provide a\nq-deformation of the computation of genus 1 conformal blocks via elliptic\nSelberg integrals by Felder-Stevens-Varchenko. They allow us to give precise\nformulations for the affine Macdonald conjectures in the general case which are\nconsistent with computer computations.\n  Our method applies recent work of the second named author to relate these\nconjectures in the case of $U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ to evaluations of\ncertain theta hypergeometric integrals defined by Felder-Varchenko. We then\nevaluate the resulting integrals, which may be of independent interest, by\nwell-chosen applications of the elliptic beta integral introduced by\nSpiridonov.\n", "  Chiral anomalies give rise to dissipationless transport phenomena such as the\nchiral magnetic and vortical effects. In these notes I review the theory from a\nquantum field theoretic, hydrodynamic and holographic perspective. A physical\ninterpretation of the otherwise somewhat obscure concepts of consistent and\ncovariant anomalies will be given. Vanishing of the CME in strict equilibrium\nwill be connected to the boundary conditions in momentum space imposed by the\nregularization. The role of the gravitational anomaly will be explained. That\nit contributes to transport in an unexpectedly low order in the derivative\nexpansion can be easiest understood via holography. Anomalous transport is\nsupposed to play also a key role in understanding the electronics of advanced\nmaterials, the Dirac- and Weyl (semi)metals. Anomaly related phenomena such as\nnegative magnetoresistivity, anomalous Hall effect, thermal anomalous Hall\neffect and Fermi arcs can be understood via anomalous transport. Finally I\nbriefly review a holographic model of Weyl semimetal which allows to infer a\nnew phenomenon related to the gravitational anomaly: the presence of odd\nviscosity.\n", "  Heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) at one loop fails in relating\nthe pion-nucleon amplitude in the physical region and for subthreshold\nkinematics due to loop effects enhanced by large low-energy constants. Studying\nthe chiral convergence of threshold and subthreshold parameters up to fourth\norder in the small-scale expansion, we address the question to what extent this\ntension can be mitigated by including the $\\Delta(1232)$ as an explicit degree\nof freedom and/or using a covariant formulation of baryon ChPT. We find that\nthe inclusion of the $\\Delta$ indeed reduces the low-energy constants to more\nnatural values and thereby improves consistency between threshold and\nsubthreshold kinematics. In addition, even in the $\\Delta$-less theory the\nresummation of $1/m_N$ corrections in the covariant scheme improves the results\nmarkedly over the heavy-baryon formulation, in line with previous observations\nin the single-baryon sector of ChPT that so far have evaded a profound\ntheoretical explanation.\n", "  Wigner crystals (WC) are electronic phases peculiar to low-density systems,\nparticularly in the uniform electron gas. Since its introduction in the early\ntwentieth century, this model has remained essential to many aspects of\nelectronic structure theory and condensed-matter physics. Although the\n(lowest-energy) ground-state WC (GSWC) has been thoroughly studied, the\nproperties of excited-state WCs (ESWCs) are basically unknown. To bridge this\ngap, we present a well-defined procedure to obtain an entire family of ESWCs in\na one-dimensional electron gas using a symmetry-broken mean-field approach.\nWhile the GSWC is a commensurate crystal (i.e.~the number of density maxima\nequals the number of electrons), these ESWCs are incommensurate crystals\nexhibiting more or less maxima. Interestingly, they are lower in energy than\nthe (uniform) Fermi fluid state. For some of these ESWCs we have found\nasymmetrical band gaps, which would lead to anisotropic conductivity. These\nproperties are associated to unusual characteristics in their electronic\nstructure.\n", "  We generalize the rejection-free event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm from many\nparticle systems with pairwise interactions to systems with arbitrary three- or\nmany-particle interactions. We introduce generalized lifting probabilities\nbetween particles and obtain a general set of equations for lifting\nprobabilities, the solution of which guarantees maximal global balance. We\nvalidate the resulting three-particle event-chain Monte Carlo algorithms on\nthree different systems by comparison with conventional local Monte Carlo\nsimulations: (i) a test system of three particles with a three-particle\ninteraction that depends on the enclosed triangle area; (ii) a hard-needle\nsystem in two dimensions, where needle interactions constitute three-particle\ninteractions of the needle end points; (iii) a semiflexible polymer chain with\na bending energy, which constitutes a three-particle interaction of neighboring\nchain beads. The examples demonstrate that the generalization to many-particle\ninteractions broadens the applicability of event-chain algorithms considerably.\n", "  We study an ensemble of random waves subject to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The\nintroduction of a point with a magnetic flux of arbitrary strength into a\nrandom wave ensemble gives a family of wavefunctions whose distribution of\nvortices (complex zeros) are responsible for the topological phase associated\nwith the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Analytical expressions are found for the vortex\nnumber and topological charge densities as functions of distance from the flux\npoint. Comparison is made with the distribution of vortices in the isotropic\nrandom wave model. The results indicate that as the flux approaches\nhalf-integer values, a vortex with the same sign as the fractional part of the\nflux is attracted to the flux point, merging with it at half-integer flux.\nOther features of the Aharonov-Bohm vortex distribution are also explored.\n", "  Several Milky Way star clusters show a roughly flat velocity dispersion\nprofile at large radii, which is not expected from models with a tidal cut-off\nenergy. Possible explanations for this excess velocity include: the effects of\na dark matter halo, modified gravity theories and energetically unbound stars\ninside of clusters. These stars are known as potential escapers (PEs) and can\nexist indefinitely within clusters which are on circular orbits. Through a\nseries of N-body simulations of star cluster systems, where we vary the\ngalactic potential, orbital eccentricity and stellar mass function, we\ninvestigate the properties of the PEs and their effects on the kinematics. We\nderive a prediction for the scaling of the velocity dispersion at the Jacobi\nsurface due to PEs, as a function of cluster mass, angular velocity of the\ncluster orbit, and slope of the mass profile of the host galaxy. We see a\ntentative signal of the mass and orbital velocity dependence in kinematic data\nof globular clusters from literature. We also find that the fraction of PEs\ndepends sensitively on the galactic mass profile, reaching as high as 40% in\nthe cusp of a Navarro-Frenk-White profile and as the velocity anisotropy also\ndepends on the slope of the galactic mass profile, we conclude that PEs provide\nan independent way of inferring the properties of the dark matter mass profile\nat the galactic radius of (globular) clusters in the Gaia era.\n", "  The transmission of a wave through a randomly chosen `pile of plates'\ntypically decreases exponentially with the number of plates, a phenomenon\nclosely related to Anderson localisation. In apparent contradiction we\nconstruct disordered planar permittivity profiles which are complex-valued\n(i.e. have reactive and dissipative properties) that appear to vary randomly\nwith position, yet are one-way reflectionless for all angles of incidence and\nexhibit a transmission coefficient of unity. We contrast these complex-valued\n'random' planar permittivity profiles with a family of real-valued, two-way\nreflectionless and perfectly transmitting disordered permittivity profiles that\nfunction only for a single angle of incidence and frequency.\n", "  We discuss the emergence of zero-energy Majorana modes in a disordered\nfinite-length p-wave one-dimensional superconducting ring, pierced by a\nmagnetic flux $\\Phi$ tuned at an appropriate value $\\Phi=\\Phi_*$. In the\nabsence of fermion parity conservation, we evidence the emergence of the\nMajorana modes by looking at the discontinuities in the persistent current\n$I[\\Phi]$ at $\\Phi=\\Phi_*$. By monitoring the discontinuities in $I[\\Phi]$, we\nmap out the region in parameter space characterized by the emergence of\nMajorana modes in the disordered ring.\n", "  A detailed diffraction study of Ca10Cr7O28 is presented which adds\nsignificant new insights into the structural and magnetic properties of this\ncompound. A new crystal structure type was used where the a and b axes are\ndoubled compared to previous models providing a more plausible structure where\nall crystallographic sites are fully occupied. The presence of two different\nvalences of chromium was verified and the locations of the magnetic Cr5+ and\nnon-magnetic Cr6+ ions were identified. The Cr5+ ions have spin-1/2 and form\ndistorted kagome bilayers which are stacked in an ABC arrangement along the c\naxis. These results lay the foundation for understanding of the quantum spin\nliquid behavior in Ca10Cr7O28 which has recently been reported in [C. Balz et\nal., Nature Physics, 12, 942 (2016)].\n", "  We show how one can construct \\alert{a simple} exchange functional by\nextending the well-know local-density approximation (LDA) to finite uniform\nelectron gases. This new generalized local-density approximation (GLDA)\nfunctional uses only two quantities: the electron density $\\rho$ and the\ncurvature of the Fermi hole $\\alpha$. This alternative \"rung 2\" functional can\nbe easily coupled with generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) functionals to\nform a new family of \"rung 3\" meta-GGA (MGGA) functionals that we have named\nfactorizable MGGAs (FMGGAs). Comparisons are made with various LDA, GGA and\nMGGA functionals for atoms and molecules.\n", "  A general family of structured Gaussian beams naturally emerges from a\nconsideration of families of rays. These ray families, with the property that\ntheir transverse profile is invariant upon propagation (except for cycling of\nthe rays and a global rescaling), have two parameters, the first giving a\nposition on an ellipse naturally represented by a point on the Poincar\\'e\nsphere (familiar from polarization optics), and the other determining the\nposition of a curve traced out on this Poincar\\'e sphere. This construction\nnaturally accounts for the familiar families of Gaussian beams, including\nHermite-Gauss, Laguerre-Gauss and Generalized Hermite-Laguerre-Gauss beams, but\nis far more general. The conformal mapping between a projection of the\nPoincar\\'e sphere and the physical space of the transverse plane of a Gaussian\nbeam naturally involves caustics. In addition to providing new insight into the\nphysics of propagating Gaussian beams, the ray-based approach allows effective\napproximation of the propagating amplitude without explicit diffraction\ncalculations.\n", "  Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) aims to accelerate\noptimal design of complex material systems by integrating material science and\ndesign automation. For tractable ICME, it is required that (1) a structural\nfeature space be identified to allow reconstruction of new designs, and (2) the\nreconstruction process be property-preserving. The majority of existing\nstructural presentation schemes rely on the designer's understanding of\nspecific material systems to identify geometric and statistical features, which\ncould be biased and insufficient for reconstructing physically meaningful\nmicrostructures of complex material systems. In this paper, we develop a\nfeature learning mechanism based on convolutional deep belief network to\nautomate a two-way conversion between microstructures and their\nlower-dimensional feature representations, and to achieves a 1000-fold\ndimension reduction from the microstructure space. The proposed model is\napplied to a wide spectrum of heterogeneous material systems with distinct\nmicrostructural features including Ti-6Al-4V alloy, Pb63-Sn37 alloy,\nFontainebleau sandstone, and Spherical colloids, to produce material\nreconstructions that are close to the original samples with respect to 2-point\ncorrelation functions and mean critical fracture strength. This capability is\nnot achieved by existing synthesis methods that rely on the Markovian\nassumption of material microstructures.\n", "  The quasi-integrable KdV equation has been obtained from the corresponding\ndeformation of the Hamiltonian for the usual KdV system. Following suitable\ngauge-fixing, it has been found that the quasi-conservation condition is\nsatisfied and an infinite number of anomalous conservation laws are obtained,\nwith some containing possible conserved charges. Judicious choice of\ndeformation of the Hamiltonian clearly leads to a conserved charge, manifesting\nquasi-integrability, but also creates a hierarchy of higher-derivative\nequations with at least one conserved charge. A particular quasi-deformation\nparameterization of the Hamiltonian is found to complement the same of the NLS\nsystem, following an approximate equivalence of the two systems obtained\nearlier, in the weak coupling limit. Single-soliton solutions for all these\ncases are obtained, with manifest scaling due to the quasi-integrable\ndeformation. Finally, quasi-conservation formulation for the complex coupled\ngeneralized KdV system is obtained.\n", "  Following two recent papers [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2015, \\textbf{17}, 3196;\nMol. Phys. 2015, \\textbf{113}, 1843], we perform a larger-scale study of\nchemical structure in one dimension (1D). We identify a wide, and occasionally\nsurprising, variety of stable 1D compounds (from diatomics to tetra-atomics) as\nwell as a small collection of stable polymeric structures. We define the\nexclusion potential, a 1D analogue of the electrostatic potential, and show\nthat it can be used to rationalise the nature of bonding within molecules. This\nallows us to construct a small set of simple rules which can predict whether a\nputative 1D molecule should be stable.\n", "  Buhrman showed that an efficient communication protocol implies a reliable\nXOR game protocol. This idea rederives Linial and Shraibman's lower bounds of\ncommunication complexity, which was derived by using factorization norms, with\nworse constant factor in much more intuitive way. In this work, we improve and\ngeneralize Buhrman's idea, and obtain a class of lower bounds for classical\ncommunication complexity including an exact Linial and Shraibman's lower bound\nas a special case. In the proof, we explicitly construct a protocol for XOR\ngame from a classical communication protocol by using a concept of nonlocal\nboxes and Paw{\\l}owski et al.'s elegant protocol, which was used for showing\nthe violation of information causality in superquantum theories.\n", "  We report on the optical and mechanical characterization of arrays of\nparallel micromechanical membranes. Pairs of high-tensile stress, 100 nm-thick\nsilicon nitride membranes are assembled parallel with each other with\nseparations ranging from 8.5 to 200 $\\mu$m. Their optical properties are\naccurately determined using a combination of broadband and monochromatic\nilluminations and the lowest vibrational mode frequencies and mechanical\nquality factors are determined interferometrically. The results and techniques\ndemonstrated are promising for investigations of collective phenomena in\noptomechanical arrays.\n", "  We investigate structural resonances in multi-element optical resonators and\nprovide a roadmap for the description of the interaction of single extended\ncavity modes with quantum emitters or mechanical resonators. Using a first\nprinciple approach based on the transfer matrix formalism we analyze, both\nnumerically and analytically, the static and dynamical properties of three- and\nfour-mirror cavities. We investigate in particular conditions under which the\nconfinement of the field in specific subcavities allows for enhanced\nlight-matter interactions in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics and\ncavity optomechanics.\n", "  An invertible field transformation is such that the old field variables\ncorrespond one-to-one to the new variables. As such, one may think that two\nsystems that are related by an invertible transformation are physically\nequivalent. However, if the transformation depends on field derivatives, the\nequivalence between the two systems is nontrivial due to the appearance of\nhigher derivative terms in the equations of motion. To address this problem, we\nprove the following theorem on the relation between an invertible\ntransformation and Euler-Lagrange equations: If the field transformation is\ninvertible, then any solution of the original set of Euler-Lagrange equations\nis mapped to a solution of the new set of Euler-Lagrange equations, and vice\nversa. We also present applications of the theorem to scalar-tensor theories.\n", "  Experimental records of active bundle motility are used to demonstrate the\npresence of a low-dimensional chaotic attractor in hair cell dynamics.\nDimensionality tests from dynamic systems theory are applied to estimate the\nnumber of independent variables sufficient for modeling the hair cell response.\nPoincare maps are constructed to observe a quasiperiodic transition from chaos\nto order with increasing amplitudes of mechanical forcing. The onset of this\ntransition is accompanied by a reduction of Kolmogorov entropy in the system\nand an increase in mutual information between the stimulus and the hair bundle,\nindicative of signal detection. A simple theoretical model is used to describe\nthe observed chaotic dynamics. The model exhibits an enhancement of sensitivity\nto weak stimuli when the system is poised in the chaotic regime. We propose\nthat chaos may play a role in the hair cell's ability to detect low-amplitude\nsounds.\n", "  In certain theories of modified gravity, solar system constraints on\ndeviations from general relativity (GR) are satisfied by virtue of a so-called\nscreening mechanism, which enables the theory to revert to GR in regions where\nthe matter density is high or the gravitational potential is deep. In the case\nof chameleon theories, the screening has two contributions -- self-screening,\nwhich is due to the mass of an object itself, and environmental screening,\nwhich is caused by the surrounding matter -- which are often entangled, with\nthe second contribution being more crucial for less massive objects. A\nquantitative understanding of the effect of the environment on the screening\ncan prove critical in observational tests of such theories using systems such\nas the Local Group and dwarf galaxies, for which the environment may be\ninferred in various ways. We use the high-resolution {\\sc liminality}\nsimulation of Shi et al. (2015) to test the fidelity of different definitions\nof environment. We find that, although the different ways to define environment\nin practice do not agree with one another perfectly, they can provide useful\nguidance, and cross checks about how well a dark matter halo is screened. In\naddition, the screening of subhaloes in dark matter haloes is primarily\ndetermined by the environment, with the subhalo mass playing a minor role,\nwhich means that lower-resolution simulations where subhaloes are not well\nresolved can still be useful for understanding the modification of gravity\ninside subhaloes.\n", "  Rydberg molecules, often exemplified by long-range \"trilobite\" molecules, are\na subject of much recent interest at high principal quantum number $n$. States\nthat use the same bonding mechanism can exist at much lower $n$ and\nless-extreme internuclear separations that are still quite long range. We use a\nhigh-resolution pulsed amplifier to study previously-detected transitions to a\nlow-$n$ Rydberg molecular state near the $5s+7p$ asymptote in $^{85}$Rb$_2$.\nThe observed line structure is modeled using precise ground-state positions and\na lower bound of $\\tau > 1.1 \\times 10^{-9}$ s is set on the excited-state\nautoionization lifetime.\n", "  We present independent measurements of the masses of the galaxy clusters in\nthe local universe by employing the Dynamical Mass Estimator (DME) originally\ndeveloped by Falco et al in 2014. In the catalog of the galaxy groups/clusters\nconstructed by Tempel et al. from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10,\nwe search for those as the targets around which the neighbor galaxies\nconstitute thin straight filamentary structures in the configuration space\nspanned by the redshifts and the projected distances. Out of the $29$ Sloan\nclusters that have $100$ or more member galaxies, a total of six targets are\nfound to have filamentary structures in their bound zones. For each of the six\ntargets, we construct the profile of the recession velocities of the filament\ngalaxies, which depends on the cluster mass and the angle of the filament\nrelative the line of the sight direction. Fitting the constructed profile to\nthe universal formula with constant amplitude and slope, we statistically\ndetermine the dynamical mass of each cluster and compare it with the previous\nestimates made by a conventional method. The weak and strong points of the DME\nas well as its prospect for the measurements of the dynamical masses of the\nhigh-$z$ clusters are discussed.\n", "  We study the effects of synthetic spin-orbit coupling on the pairing physics\nin quasi-one-dimensional ultracold Fermi gases of alkaline-earth-metal-like\natoms near an orbital Feshbach resonance (OFR). The interplay between\nspin-orbit coupling and pairing interactions near the OFR leads to an\ninteresting topological Fulde-Ferrell state, where the nontrivial topology of\nthe state is solely encoded in the closed channel with a topologically trivial\nFulde-Ferrell pairing in the open channel. We confirm the topological property\nof the system by characterizing the Zak phase and the edge states. The\ntopological Fulde-Ferrell state can be identified by the momentum-space density\ndistribution obtained from time-of-flight images.\n", "  We present measurements of superconducting transition temperature,\nresistivity, magnetoresistivity and temperature dependence of the upper\ncritical field of Ta$_4$Pd$_3$Te$_{16}$ under pressures up to 16.4 kbar. All\nmeasured properties have an anomaly at $\\sim 2 - 4$ kbar pressure range, in\nparticular there is a maximum in $T_c$ and upper critical field, $H_{c2}(0)$,\nand minimum in low temperature, normal state resistivity. Qualitatively, the\ndata can be explained considering the density of state at the Fermi level as a\ndominant parameter.\n", "  There is a deep and interesting connection between the topological properties\nof a graph and the behaviour of the dynamical system defined on it. We analyse\nvarious kind of graphs, with different contrasting connectivity or degree\ncharacteristics, using the signless Laplacian matrix. We expose the theoretical\nresults about the eigenvalue of the matrix and how they are related to the\ndynamical system. Then, we perform numerical computations on real-like graphs\nand observe the resulting system. Comparing the theoretical and numerical\nresults we found a perfect consistency. Furthermore, we define a metric which\ntakes in account the \"rigidity\" of the graph and enables us to relate all\ntogether the topological properties of the graph, the signless Laplacian matrix\nand the dynamical system.\n", "  We examine the possibility that icy super-Earth mass planets, formed over\nlong time scales (0.1--1~Gyr) at large distances ($\\sim$ 200--1000~AU) from\ntheir host stars, will develop massive H-rich atmospheres. Within the interior\nof these planets, high pressure converts CH$_4$ into ethane, butane, or diamond\nand releases H$_2$. Using simplified models which capture the basic physics of\nthe internal structure, we show that the physical properties of the atmosphere\ndepend on the outflux of H$_2$ from the mantle. When this outflux is $\\lesssim\n10^{10}$ [molec cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$], the outgassed atmosphere has base pressure\n$\\lesssim$ 1 bar. Larger outflows result in a substantial atmosphere where the\nbase pressure may approach $10^3 - 10^4$ bar. For any pressure, the mean\ndensity of these planets, 2.4--3 [g cm$^{-3}$], is much larger than the mean\ndensity of Uranus and Neptune, 1.3--1.6 [g cm$^{-3}$]. Thus, observations can\ndistinguish between a Planet Nine with a primordial H/He-rich atmosphere\naccreted from the protosolar nebula and one with an atmosphere outgassed from\nthe core.\n", "  Using a high-frequency expansion in periodically driven extended Hubbard\nmodels, where the strengths and ranges of density-density interactions are\narbitrary, we obtain the effective interactions and bandwidth, which depend\nsensitively on the polarization of the driving field. Then, we numerically\ncalculate modulations of correlation functions in a quarter-filled extended\nHubbard model with nearest-neighbor interactions on a triangular lattice with\ntrimers after monocycle pulse excitation. We discuss how the resultant\nmodulations are compatible with the effective interactions and bandwidth\nderived above on the basis of their dependence on the polarization of\nphotoexcitation, which is easily accessible by experiments. Some correlation\nfunctions after monocycle pulse excitation are consistent with the effective\ninteractions, which are weaker or stronger than the original ones. However, the\nphotoinduced enhancement of anisotropic charge correlations previously\ndiscussed for the three-quarter-filled organic conductor\n$\\alpha$-(bis[ethylenedithio]-tetrathiafulvalene)$_2$I$_3$\n[$\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$] in the metallic phase is not fully explained by\nthe effective interactions or bandwidth, which are derived independently of the\nfilling.\n", "  We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations\nof molecular line emission from d216-0939, one of the largest and most massive\nprotoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We model the spectrally\nresolved HCO$^+$ (4--3), CO (3--2), and HCN (4--3) lines observed at 0\\farcs5\nresolution to fit the temperature and density structure of the disk. We also\nweakly detect and spectrally resolve the CS (7--6) line but do not model it.\nThe abundances we derive for CO and HCO$^+$ are generally consistent with\nexpected values from chemical modeling of protoplanetary disks, while the HCN\nabundance is higher than expected. We dynamically measure the mass of the\ncentral star to be $2.17\\pm0.07\\,M_\\odot$ which is inconsistent with the\npreviously determined spectral type of K5. We also report the detection of a\nspatially unresolved high-velocity blue-shifted excess emission feature with a\nmeasurable positional offset from the central star, consistent with a Keplerian\norbit at $60\\pm20\\,\\mathrm{au}$. Using the integrated flux of the feature in\nHCO$^+$ (4--3), we estimate the total H$_2$ gas mass of this feature to be at\nleast $1.8-8\\,M_\\mathrm{Jupiter}$, depending on the assumed temperature. The\nfeature is due to a local temperature and/or density enhancement consistent\nwith either a hydrodynamic vortex or the expected signature of the envelope of\na forming protoplanet within the disk.\n", "  We study the plasma flows in the solar photosphere during the emergence of\ntwo small active regions, NOAA 9021 and 10768. Using SOHO/MDI data, we find\nthat the strong plasma upflows appear at the initial stage of active region\nformation, with maximum upflow velocities of -1650 and -1320 m/s. The\nstructures with enhanced upflows have size about 8 Mm in diameter, and they\nexist for 1-2 hr. The parameters of the enhanced upflows are consistent with\nthose of the large active region NOAA 10488, which may suggest the possibility\nthat the elementary emerging magnetic loops that appear at the earliest phase\nof active region formation have similar properties, irrespective of scales of\nactive regions. Comparison between the observations and a numerical simulation\nof magnetic flux emergence shows a striking consistency. We find that the\ndriving force of the plasma upflow is at first the gas pressure gradient and\nlater the magnetic pressure gradient.\n", "  SuperNEMO is an ultra-low-background tracker-calorimeter experiment designed\nto look for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of various isotopes. We present\nthe current state of the experiment's Demonstrator Module, which is currently\nbeing installed and and commissioned in the LSM in France.\n", "  In the next decade several experiments will attempt to determine the neutrino\nmass hierarchy, i.e. the sign of $\\Delta m_{31}^2$. In the last years it was\nnoticed that the two hierarchies are disjoint hypotheses and, for this reason,\nWilks' theorem cannot be applied: this means that\n$\\Delta\\chi^2=\\chi^2_{IH}-\\chi^2_{NH}$ does not follow a one-degree-of-freedom\nchi-square distribution. It was proven that, under certain assumptions, it\nfollows instead a Gaussian distribution with $\\sigma=2\\sqrt{\\mu}$. I will\npresent several possible definition of sensitivity and review the approaches\nproposed in the literature, both within the Bayesian and the frequentist\nframework, examining advantages and disadvantages and discussing how they\nshould be modified if the conditions for Gaussianity are not fulfilled. I will\nalso discuss the possibility of introducing a new pull parameter in order to\navoid the issue related to the non-nested hypotheses and the differences\nbetween marginalization and minimization, showing under which conditions the\ntwo procedures yield the same $\\Delta\\chi^2$.\n", "  We use the noisy entanglement-assisted classical capacity formula\n[arXiv:1609.08592] to create a coherent-attack security framework for Gaussian\ntwo-way quantum key distribution protocols in the asymptotic region.\n", "  At Crypto 2011, some of us had proposed a family of cryptographic protocols\nfor key establishment capable of protecting quantum and classical legitimate\nparties unconditionally against a quantum eavesdropper in the query complexity\nmodel. Unfortunately, our security proofs were unsatisfactory from a\ncryptographically meaningful perspective because they were sound only in a\nworst-case scenario. Here, we extend our results and prove that for any e > 0,\nthere is a classical protocol that allows the legitimate parties to establish a\ncommon key after O(N) expected queries to a random oracle, yet any quantum\neavesdropper will have a vanishing probability of learning their key after\nO(N^{1.5-e}) queries to the same oracle. The vanishing probability applies to a\ntypical run of the protocol. If we allow the legitimate parties to use a\nquantum computer as well, their advantage over the quantum eavesdropper becomes\narbitrarily close to the quadratic advantage that classical legitimate parties\nenjoyed over classical eavesdroppers in the seminal 1974 work of Ralph Merkle.\nAlong the way, we develop new tools to give lower bounds on the number of\nquantum queries required to distinguish two probability distributions. This\nmethod in itself could have multiple applications in cryptography. We use it\nhere to study average-case quantum query complexity, for which we develop a new\ncomposition theorem of independent interest.\n", "  In 2006, Dafermos and Holzegel formulated the so-called AdS instability\nconjecture, stating that there exist arbitrarily small perturbations to AdS\ninitial data which, under evolution by the Einstein vacuum equations for\n$\\Lambda<0$ with reflecting boundary conditions on conformal infinity, lead to\nthe formation of black holes. The numerical study of this conjecture in the\nsimpler setting of the spherically symmetric Einstein--scalar field system was\ninitiated by Bizon and Rostworowski, followed by a vast number of numerical and\nheuristic works by several authors.\n  In this paper, we provide the first rigorous proof of the AdS instability\nconjecture in the simplest possible setting, namely for the spherically\nsymmetric Einstein--massless Vlasov system, in the case when the Vlasov field\nis moreover supported only on radial geodesics. This system is equivalent to\nthe Einstein--null dust system, allowing for both ingoing and outgoing dust. In\norder to overcome the break down of this system occuring once the null dust\nreaches the centre $r=0$, we place an inner mirror at $r=r_{0}>0$ and study the\nevolution of this system on the exterior domain $\\{r\\ge r_{0}\\}$. The structure\nof the maximal development and the Cauchy stability properties of general\ninitial data in this setting are studied in our companion paper.\n  The statement of the main theorem is as follows: We construct a family of\nmirror radii $r_{0\\epsilon}>0$ and initial data $\\mathcal{S}_{\\epsilon}$,\n$\\epsilon\\in(0,1]$, converging to the AdS initial data in a suitable norm, such\nthat, for any $\\epsilon>0$, the maximal development\n$(\\mathcal{M}_{\\epsilon},g_{\\epsilon})$ of $\\mathcal{S}_{\\epsilon}$ contains a\nblack hole region. Our proof is based on purely physical space arguments.\n", "  In this paper, we study the evolution of asymptotically AdS initial data for\nthe spherically symmetric Einstein--massless Vlasov system for $\\Lambda<0$,\nwith reflecting boundary conditions imposed on timelike infinity $\\mathcal{I}$,\nin the case when the Vlasov field is supported only on radial geodesics. This\nsystem is equivalent to the spherically symmetric Einstein--null dust system,\nallowing for both ingoing and outgoing dust. In general, solutions to this\nsystem break down in finite time (independent of the size of the initial data);\nwe highlight this fact by showing that, at the first point where the ingoing\ndust reaches the axis of symmetry, solutions become $C^{0}$ inextendible,\nalthough the spacetime metric remains regular up to that point.\n  One way to overcome this trivial obstacle to well-posedness is to place an\ninner mirror on a timelike hypersurface of the form $\\{r=r_{0}\\}$, $r_{0}>0$,\nand study the evolution on the exterior domain $\\{r\\ge r_{0}\\}$. In this\nsetting, we prove the existence and uniqueness of maximal developments for\ngeneral smooth and asymptotically AdS initial data sets, and study the basic\ngeometric properties of these developments. Furthermore, we establish the\nwell-posedness and Cauchy stabilty of solutions with respect to a rough initial\ndata norm, measuring the concentration of energy at scales proportional to the\nmirror radius $r_{0}$.\n  The above well-posedness and Cauchy stability estimates are used in our\ncompanion paper for the proof of the AdS instability conjecture for the\nEinstein--null dust system. However, the results of the present paper might\nalso be of independent interest.\n", "  We discuss the possibility to build a neutron target for nuclear reaction\nstudies in inverse kinematics utilizing a storage ring and radioactive ion\nbeams. The proposed neutron target is a specially designed spallation target\nsurrounded by a large moderator of heavy water (D$_2$O). We present the\nresulting neutron spectra and their properties as a target. We discuss possible\nrealizations at different experimental facilities.\n", "  Two detection systems based on optical readout were developed:\n  a. Integrative optical detector A 2nd generation of Time-Resolved Integrative\nOptical Neutron (TRION) detector was developed. It is based on an integrative\noptical technique, which permits fast-neutron energy-resolved imaging via\ntime-gated optical readout. This mode of operation allows loss-free operation\nat very high neutron-flux intensities. The TRION neutron imaging system can be\nregarded as a stroboscopic photography of neutrons arriving at the detector on\na few-ns time scale. As this spectroscopic capability is based on the\nTime-of-Flight (TOF) technique, it has to be operated in conjunction with a\npulsed neutron source, such as an ion accelerator producing 1-2 ns wide beam\npulses at MHz repetition rates. TRION is capable of capturing 4 simultaneous\nTOF frames within a single accelerator pulse and accumulating them over all\npulses contained within a finite acquisition time. The detector principle of\noperation, simulations and experimental results are described.\n  b. Fibrous optical detector A fast neutron imaging detector based on\nmicrometric glass capillaries loaded with high- refractive-index liquid\nscintillator has been developed. Neutron energy spectrometry is based on\nevent-by-event detection and reconstruction of neutron energy from the\nmeasurement of the recoil proton track projection length and the amount of\nlight produced in the track. In addition, the detector can provide fast-neutron\nimaging with position resolution of tens of microns. The detector principle of\noperation, simulations and experimental results obtained with a small detector\nprototype are described. Track-imaging of individual recoil protons from\nincident neutrons in the range of 2-14 MeV are demonstrated as well as\npreliminary results of detector spectroscopic capabilities.\n  Keywords: Fast neutron resonance radiography; Time-of-Flight; Fast neutron\nimaging; Energy-resolved imaging; Neutron spectrometry; Capillary array; Liquid\nscintillator\n", "  Quantum communication is a prime space technology application and offers\nnear-term possibilities for long-distance quantum key distribution (QKD) and\nexperimental tests of quantum entanglement. However, there exists considerable\ndevelopmental risks and subsequent costs and time required to raise the\ntechnological readiness level of terrestrial quantum technologies and to adapt\nthem for space operations. The small-space revolution is a promising route by\nwhich synergistic advances in miniaturization of both satellite systems and\nquantum technologies can be combined to leap-frog conventional space systems\ndevelopment. Here, we outline a recent proposal to perform orbit-to-ground\ntransmission of entanglement and QKD using a CubeSat platform deployed from the\nInternational Space Station (ISS). This ambitious mission exploits advances in\nnanosatellite attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), miniaturised\ntarget acquisition and tracking sensors, compact and robust sources of single\nand entangled photons, and high-speed classical communications systems, all to\nbe incorporated within a 10 kg 6 litre mass-volume envelope. The CubeSat\nQuantum Communications Mission (CQuCoM) would be a pathfinder for advanced\nnanosatellite payloads and operations, and would establish the basis for a\nconstellation of low-Earth orbit trusted-nodes for QKD service provision.\n", "  We recently presented a new \"artificial intelligence\" method for the analysis\nof high-resolution absorption spectra (Bainbridge and Webb, Mon. Not. R.\nAstron. Soc. 2017, 468,1639-1670). This new method unifies three established\nnumerical methods: a genetic algorithm (GVPFIT); non-linear least-squares\noptimisation with parameter constraints (VPFIT); and Bayesian Model Averaging\n(BMA). In this work, we investigate the performance of GVPFIT and BMA over a\nbroad range of velocity structures using synthetic spectra. We found that this\nnew method recovers the velocity structures of the absorption systems and\naccurately estimates variation in the fine structure constant. Studies such as\nthis one are required to evaluate this new method before it can be applied to\nthe analysis of large sets of absorption spectra. This is the first time that a\nsample of synthetic spectra has been utilised to investigate the analysis of\nabsorption spectra. Probing the variation of nature's fundamental constants\n(such as the fine structure constant), through the analysis of absorption\nspectra, is one of the most direct ways of testing the universality of physical\nlaws. This \"artificial intelligence\" method provides a way to avoid the main\nlimiting factor, i.e., human interaction, in the analysis of absorption\nspectra.\n", "  Perhaps the best understood phase transition is that in the component\nstructure of the uniform random graph process introduced by Erd\\H{o}s and\nR\\'enyi around 1960. Since the model is so fundamental, it is very interesting\nto know which features of this phase transition are specific to the model, and\nwhich are `universal', at least within some larger class of processes (a\n`universality class'). Achlioptas process, a class of variants of the\nErd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi process that are easy to define but difficult to analyze,\nhave been extensively studied from this point of view. Here, settling a number\nof conjectures and open problems, we show that all `bounded-size' Achlioptas\nprocesses share (in a strong sense) all the key features of the\nErd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi phase transition. We do not expect this to hold for\nAchlioptas processes in general.\n", "  We use Fisher Matrix analysis techniques to forecast the cosmological impact\nof astrophysical tests of the stability of the fine-structure constant to be\ncarried out by the forthcoming ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT (due for\ncommissioning in late 2017), as well by the planned high-resolution\nspectrograph (currently in Phase A) for the European Extremely Large Telescope.\nAssuming a fiducial model without $\\alpha$ variations, we show that ESPRESSO\ncan improve current bounds on the E\\\"{o}tv\\\"{o}s parameter---which quantifies\nWeak Equivalence Principle violations---by up to two orders of magnitude,\nleading to stronger bounds than those expected from the ongoing tests with the\nMICROSCOPE satellite, while constraints from the E-ELT should be competitive\nwith those of the proposed STEP satellite. Should an $\\alpha$ variation be\ndetected, these measurements will further constrain cosmological parameters,\nbeing particularly sensitive to the dynamics of dark energy.\n", "  The survey volume of a proper motion-limited sample is typically much smaller\nthan a magnitude-limited sample. This is because of the noisy astrometric\nmeasurements from detectors that are not dedicated for astrometric missions. In\norder to apply an empirical completeness correction, existing works limit the\nsurvey depth to the shallower parts of the sky that hamper the maximum\npotential of a survey. The number of epoch of measurement is a discrete\nquantity that cannot be interpolated across the projected plane of observation,\nso that the survey properties change in discrete steps across the sky. This\nwork proposes a method to dissect the survey into small parts with Voronoi\ntessellation using candidate objects as generating points, such that each part\ndefines a `mini-survey' that has its own properties. Coupling with a maximum\nvolume density estimator, the new method is demonstrated to be unbiased and\nrecovered {\\sim}20% more objects than the existing method in a mock catalogue\nof a white dwarf-only solar neighbourhood with Pan--STARRS 1-like\ncharacteristics. Towards the end of this work, we demonstrate one way to\nincrease the tessellation resolution with artificial generating points, which\nwould be useful for analysis of rare objects with small number counts.\n", "  In chiral magnetic materials, numerous intriguing phenomena such as built in\nchiral magnetic domain walls (DWs) and skyrmions are generated by the\nDzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI). The DMI also results in asymmetric DW\nspeed under in plane magnetic field, which provides a useful scheme to measure\nthe DMI strengths. However, recent findings of additional asymmetries such as\nchiral damping have disenabled unambiguous DMI determination and the underlying\nmechanism of overall asymmetries becomes under debate. By extracting the\nDMI-induced symmetric contribution, here we experimentally investigated the\nnature of the additional asymmetry. The results revealed that the additional\nasymmetry has a truly antisymmetric nature with the typical behavior governed\nby the DW chirality. In addition, the antisymmetric contribution changes the DW\nspeed more than 100 times, which cannot be solely explained by the chiral\ndamping scenario. By calibrating such antisymmetric contributions, experimental\ninaccuracies can be largely removed, enabling again the DMI measurement scheme.\n", "  We investigated the stability and mechanical and electronic properties of\nfifteen metastable mixed $sp^2$-$sp^3$ carbon allotropes in the family of\ninterpenetrating graphene networks (IGNs) using density functional theory (DFT)\nwithin the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). IGN allotropes exhibit\nnon-monotonic bulk and linear compressibilities before their structures\nirreversibly transform into new configurations under large hydrostatic\ncompression. The maximum bulk compressibilities vary widely between structures\nand range from 3.6 to 306 TPa$^{-1}$. We find all the IGN allotropes have\nnegative linear compressibilities with maximum values varying from -0.74 to\n-133 TPa$^{-1}$. The maximal negative linear compressibility of Z33 (-133\nTPa$^{-1}$ at 3.4 GPa) exceeds previously reported values at pressures higher\nthan 1.0 GPa. IGN allotropes can be classified as either armchair- or\nzigzag-type, and these two types of IGNs exhibit different electronic\nproperties. Zigzag-type IGNs are node-line semimetals, while armchair-type IGNs\nare either semiconductors or node-loop or node-line semimetals. Experimental\nsynthesis of these IGN allotropes might be realized since their formation\nenthalpies relative to graphite are only 0.1 - 0.5 eV/atom (that of C$_{60}$\nfullerene is about 0.4 eV/atom), and energetically feasible binary compound\npathways are possible.\n", "  The problem of reconstructing nonlinear and complex dynamical systems from\nmeasured data or time series is central to many scientific disciplines\nincluding physical, biological, computer, and social sciences, as well as\nengineering and economics. In this paper, we review the recent advances in this\nforefront and rapidly evolving field, aiming to cover topics such as\ncompressive sensing (a novel optimization paradigm for sparse-signal\nreconstruction), noised-induced dynamical mapping, perturbations, reverse\nengineering, synchronization, inner composition alignment, global silencing,\nGranger Causality and alternative optimization algorithms. Often, these rely on\nvarious concepts from statistical and nonlinear physics such as phase\ntransitions, bifurcation, stabilities, and robustness. The methodologies have\nthe potential to significantly improve our ability to understand a variety of\ncomplex dynamical systems ranging from gene regulatory systems to social\nnetworks towards the ultimate goal of controlling such systems. Despite recent\nprogress, many challenges remain. A purpose of this Review is then to point out\nthe specific difficulties as they arise from different contexts, so as to\nstimulate further efforts in this interdisciplinary field.\n", "  We present a new technique that we have defined as the z-scan confocal method\nto determine the absolute location and size of the focal spot in a tight\nfocused ultrashort laser pulse. The method permits to accurately position a\ntarget in the focal spot with a fast response. The technique is designed to\nhelp to automatize the location of an overdense target in focus in a laser\nplasma experiment. The method allows for a fast localization of the focal\nposition and the relative motion of the target with respect to it. As an\nexample of the capacities we measure the defocusing of a fast rotating disc in\nseveral radius to reconstruct the motion of the disc at focus.\n", "  The Mie scattering theory enables the exact determination of the scattered\nfield as a function of the incident field. Here, we use this approach to\ncalculate the Hermitian relationship between the incident field and the optical\nforces acting on the scattering objects. This Hermitian relationship defines\nalso a set of orthogonal optical eigenmodes which deliver a natural basis to\ndescribe momentum transfer in light-matter interactions.\n", "  For a model of the electromagnetic field coupled to Weyl tensor, Maxwell\nequations are modified and photons at low frequencies no longer propagate along\nlight cone. If we detect a black hole using these photons, some difficulties\nappear because we can not determine the position of event horizon which is\ndefined by null surface. To overcome these difficulties, the simplest way may\nbe an effective description by introducing an effective spacetime in which the\nphotons propagate along the light cone. Then, we find, comparing the results\nwith those of the original spacetime, that the event horizon and temperature do\nnot change, but the area of the event horizon and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\nbecome different. We show that the total entropy for this system, which is\nstill the same as that of original spacetime, consists of two parts, one is the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy and the other is the entropy arising from the\ncoupling of electromagnetic field and Weyl tensor. We also present the\neffective descriptions for the Smarr relation and first law of thermodynamics.\n", "  Graphene and its derivatives distinguish themselves for their large negative\nthermal expansion even at temperatures as high as 1000K. The linear thermal\nexpansion coefficients (LTEC) of two-dimensional honeycomb structured pure\ngraphene and B/N doped graphene are analyzed using ab initio density functional\nperturbation theory (DFPT) employed in VASP software under quasiharmonic\napproximation. One of the essential ingredients required is the phonon\nfrequencies for a set of points in the Brillouin zone and their volume\ndependence. These were obtained from the dynamical matrix which was calculated\nusing VASP code in interface with phonopy code. In particular, the transverse\nacoustic modes (ZA) behave drastically differently as compared to planer modes\nand so also their volume dependence. Using this approach firstly thermal\nexpansion for pure graphene is calculated. The results agree with earlier\ncalculations using similar approach. Thereafter we have studied the effect of\nboron and nitrogen doping on LTEC. The LTEC of graphene is found to be negative\nin the entire range of temperature under study (0-1000K) and its value at room\ntemperature (RT) is around -3.26X10-6K-1. The value of LTEC at RT becomes more\nnegative with B/N doping in graphene. In order to get an insight into the cause\nof negative thermal expansion, we have computed the contribution of individual\nphonon modes of vibration. We notice that it is principally the ZA modes which\nare responsible for negative thermal expansion. It has been concluded that\ntransverse mode in 2D hexagonal lattices have an important role to play in many\nof the thermodynamical properties of 2D structures. We have extended the study\nto calculate the LTEC of h-BN sheet also.\n", "  Background: Interaction of weakly bound heavy-ions with an intermediate or\nheavy target is not yet understood completely due to the scarcity of\nexperimental data. In order to develop a clear understanding of breakup fusion\nor preequilibrium emission even at low energy range, 3--10 MeV/nucleon, more\nexperimental investigations are necessary. Purpose: Study of reaction\nmechanisms involved in the weakly bound heavy-ion induced reaction, $^7$Li +\n$^{93}$Nb, at low energies by measuring the production cross sections of the\nresidual radionuclides. Method: Natural niobium ($^{93}$Nb) foil, backed by\naluminium (Al) catcher, arranged in a stack was bombarded by $^{7}$Li ions of\n20-45 MeV energy. Activity of the residues produced in each $^{93}$Nb target\nwas measured by off-line $\\gamma$-ray spectrometry after the end of bombardment\n(EOB) and cross sections were calculated. Experimental cross sections were\ncompared with those computed using compound and precompound models. Results: In\ngeneral, measured excitation functions of all residues produced in $^{7}$Li +\n$^{93}$Nb reaction showed good agreement with the model calculations based on\nHauser-Feshbach formalism and exciton model for compound and precompound\nprocesses, respectively. Significant preequilibrium emission of neutrons was\nobserved at the relatively high energy tail of the excitation function of\n$^{97}$Ru. Conclusions: Preequilibrium process played an important role for the\nenhancement of cross-section in $xn$ reaction channel over the compound\nreaction mechanism at higher energies for $^{7}$Li + $^{93}$Nb reaction.\nAdditionally, indirect evidence of incomplete or breakup fusion was also\nperceived.\n", "  The positive-parity nucleon spectrum is studied in 2 + 1 flavour lattice QCD\nin an attempt to discover novel low-lying energy eigenstates in the region of\nthe Roper resonance. In this work, we employ standard three-quark interpolating\nfields and introduce new local five-quark meson-baryon operators that hold the\npossibility of revealing new states that have been missed in previous studies.\nMotivated by phenomenological arguments, five-quark interpolators based on the\n$\\sigma{N}$, $\\pi{N}$ and $a_0{N}$ channels are constructed. Despite the\nintroduction of qualitatively different operators, no novel energy levels are\nextracted near the regime of the Roper resonance.\n", "  We report estimation of site response in the form of fundamental frequency.\nTowards this objective, we deploy widely established receiver function\ntechnique. Taking locally recorded events as inputs, we implement this\ntechnique to estimate resonance frequency in three receiver sites,\ncharacterized by varying lithology underneath. It is observed that resonance\nfrequencies varies from 3 to 7 Hz, which is also confirmed by our previous\nstudies of estimates from ambient noise recordings with reference to identical\nsites. Variation of frequency implies existence of heterogeneity in the study\narea.\n", "  An attempt to predict the new atomic dark matter lines is done on the example\nof a dark lepton atom - positronium. Its Layman-alpha line with the energy near\n3 GeV may be observable if the appropriate conditions realize. For this we have\nstudied a {\\gamma}-ray excess in the Center of our Galaxy. In principle, this\nexcess may be produced by the L{\\alpha} line of a dark positronium in the\nmedium with Compton scattering. The possibility of observations of an\nannihilation line (E~300 TeV) of dark positronium is also predicted. Other\nproposals to observe the atomic dark matter are shortly described. Besides,\nH{\\alpha} line (1.3{\\mu}) of usual positronum must be observable in the\ndirection on the Center of our Galaxy.\n", "  Nuclear reactors are strong, pure and well localized sources of electron\nantineutrinos with energies in the few MeV range. Therefore they provide a\nsuitable environment to study neutrino properties, in particular neutrino\noscillation parameters. Recent predictions of the expected antineutrino flux at\nnuclear reactors are about 6% higher than the average rate measured in\ndifferent experiments. This discrepancy, known as the reactor antineutrino\nanomaly, is significant at the 2.5{\\sigma} level.\n  Several new experiments are searching for the origin of this observed\nneutrino deficit. One hypothesis to be tested is an oscillation to another\nneutrino state. In a three flavor model reactor neutrinos do not oscillate at\nbaselines below 100 m. Hence, if such an oscillation is observed, it would\nimply the existence of at least one light sterile neutrino state not\nparticipating in weak interactions. Such a discovery would open the gate for\nnew physics beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) is a proposed next generation underground water\nCherenkov (WCh) experiment. The far detector will measure the oscillated\nneutrino flux from the long-baseline neutrino experiment using 0.6 GeV\nneutrinos produced by a 1.3 MW proton beam at J-PARC. It has a broad program of\nphysics and astrophysics mainly focusing on the precise measurement of the\nlepton neutrino mixing matrix and the CP asymmetry. The unoscillated neutrino\nflux will be measured by an intermediate WCh detector. One of the proposed\ndesigns is the Tokai Intermediate Tank for the Unoscillated Spectrum (TITUS).\nWCh detectors are instrumented with photomultipliers to detect the Cherenkov\nlight emitted from charged particles which are produced by neutrino\ninteractions. The detection of light is used to measure the energy, position\nand direction of the charged particles. We propose machine learning-based\nmethods to reconstruct the energy of charged particles in WCh detectors and\npresent our results for the TITUS configuration.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations physics entered in the precision era. In this context\naccelerator-based neutrino experiments need a reduction of systematic errors to\nthe level of a few percent. Today one of the most important sources of\nsystematic errors are the neutrino-nucleus cross sections. The status of our\nknowledge of these cross sections in the different open channels in the few-GeV\nregion, i.e. the quasielastic, the pion production and the multinucleon\nemission, is reviewed. Special emphasis is devoted to the multinucleon emission\nchannel, which attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. It is\ncrucial to properly reconstruct the neutrino energy which enters the expression\nof the oscillation probability. This channel was not included in the generators\nused for the analyses of the neutrino cross sections and oscillations\nexperiments.\n", "  Metasurfaces enable exceptional control over the light with surface-confined\nplanar components, offering the fascinating possibility of very dense\nintegration and miniaturization in photonics. Here, we design, fabricate and\nexperimentally demonstrate chip-size plasmonic spectropolarimeters for\nsimultaneous polarization state and wavelength determination.\nSpectropolarimeters, consisting of three gap-plasmon phase-gradient\nmetasurfaces that occupy 120{\\deg} circular sectors each, diffract normally\nincident light to six predesigned directions, whose azimuthal angles are\nproportional to the light wavelength, while contrasts in the corresponding\ndiffraction intensities provide a direct measure of the incident polarization\nstate through retrieval of the associated Stokes parameters. The\nproof-of-concept 96-{\\mu}m-diameter spectropolarimeter operating in the\nwavelength range of 750-950nm exhibits the expected polarization selectivity\nand high angular dispersion. Moreover, we show that, due to the circular-sector\ndesign, polarization analysis can be conducted for optical beams of different\ndiameters without prior calibration, demonstrating thereby the beam-size\ninvariant functionality. The proposed spectropolarimeters are compact,\ncost-effective, robust, and promise high-performance real-time polarization and\nspectral measurements.\n", "  Baby MIND is a magnetized iron neutrino detector, with novel design features,\nand is planned to serve as a downstream magnetized muon spectrometer for the\nWAGASCI experiment on the T2K neutrino beam line in Japan. One of the main\ngoals of this experiment is to reduce systematic uncertainties relevant to\nCP-violation searches, by measuring the neutrino contamination in the\nanti-neutrino beam mode of T2K. Baby MIND is currently being constructed at\nCERN, and is planned to be operational in Japan in October 2017.\n", "  The feasibility of a single-domain ferromagnet based on uniaxial magnetic\nions was examined. For a noncentrosymmetric uniaxial magnetic ion of magnetic\nmoment at a site of local electric dipole moment p, it is unknown to date\nwhether the magnetic moment prefers to be parallel or antiparallel to the\nelectric dipole moment. The nature of this magnetoelectric interaction was\nprobed in terms of analogical reasoning based on the Rashba effect and density\nfunctional calculations. We show that the magnetic and electric dipole moments\nprefer an antiparallel arrangement, predict that Fe-doped CaZnOS is a\nsingle-domain ferromagnet like a bar magnet, and find the probable cause for\nthe ferromagnetism and weak magnetization hysteresis in Fe-doped hexagonal ZnO\nand ZnS at very low dopant concentrations.\n", "  One of the causes of high fidelity of copying in biological systems is\nkinetic discrimination. In this mechanism larger dissipation and copying\nvelocity result in improved copying accuracy. We consider a model of a\npolymerase which simultaneously copies a single stranded RNA and opens a\nsingle- to double-stranded junction serving as an obstacle. The presence of the\nobstacle slows down the motor, resulting in a change of its fidelity, which can\nbe used to gain information about the motor and junction dynamics. We find that\nthe motor's fidelity does not depend on details of the motor-junction\ninteraction, such as whether the interaction is passive or active. Analysis of\nthe copying fidelity can still be used as a tool for investigating the junction\nkinetics.\n", "  From arguments based on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Pauli's\nexclusion principle, the molar specific heats of degenerate ideal gases at low\ntemperatures are estimated, giving rise to values consistent with the\nNerst-Planck Principle (third law of Thermodynamics). The Bose-Einstein\ncondensation phenomenon based on the behavior of specific heat of massive and\nnon-relativistic boson gases is also presented.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a novel analytical solution to\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which is ultimately a hydrostatic\nequilibrium equation derived from the general relativity in the framework of\nrelativistic isothermal spheres. Application of the traditional power series\nexpansions on solving TOV equation results in a limited physical range to the\nconvergent power series solution. To improve the convergence radii of the\nobtained series solutions, a combination of the two techniques of Euler-Abel\ntransformation and Pade approximation has done. The solutions are given in\n\\exi-\\theta and \\exi-\\mu phase planes taking into account the general\nrelativistic effects \\sigma= 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3. An Application to a neutron star\nhas done. A Comparison between the results obtained by the suggested approach\nin the present paper and the numerical one indicates a good agreement with a\nmaximum relative error of order 10-3, which establishes the validity and\naccuracy of the method. The procedure we have applied accelerated the power\nseries solution with about ten times than of traditional one.\n", "  Linear stability of fully developed flows of air over water is carried out in\norder to study non-linear effects in the generation of solitons by wind. A\nlinear stability analysis of the basic flow is made and the conditions at which\nsolitons first begin to grow is determined. Then, following [10], the\nnon-linear stability of the flow is examined and the quintic non-linear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation is derived for the amplitude of disturbances. The\ncoefficients of the non-linear Schr\\\"odinger equation are calculated from the\neigenvalue problem which determines the stability of air-water interface. An\nasymptotic and a numerical stability analysis is carried out to determine the\nneutrally stable flow conditions for air-sea interface. Four different profiles\nare considered for the airflow blowing over the surface of the sea, namely,\nplane Couette flow (pCf), plane Poiseuille flow (pPf), laminar and turbulent\nboundary layer (L,TBL) profiles. For each of the above cases the shear flow\ncounterpart in the water is assumed to be a pPf. It is shown that the above\namplitude equation produces `snake' solitons [9] for pCf, pPf and LBL profiles,\nwith striking similarities. On the other hand, for TBL we observe a very\nviolent surface motion. For cases of pCf and LBL remarkable similarity is\nobserved with observations made at sea. We conclude that the effect of\nnonlinearity in the airflow over the sea surface is much larger than nonlinear\ninteractions in the water, and hence it is not possible to decouple the motion\nin the air and the water for finite amplitude wind-wave interactions,\nparticularly in the case of wind-generated solitons in shallow waters.\n", "  In the earliest (so-called \"Class 0\") phase of sunlike (low-mass) star\nformation, circumstellar disks are expected to form, feeding the protostars.\nHowever, such disks are difficult to resolve spatially because of their small\nsizes. Moreover, there are theoretical difficulties in producing such disks in\nthe earliest phase, due to the retarding effects of magnetic fields on the\nrotating, collapsing material (so-called \"magnetic braking\"). With the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), it becomes possible to uncover\nsuch disks and study them in detail. HH 212 is a very young protostellar\nsystem. With ALMA, we not only detect but also spatially resolve its disk in\ndust emission at submillimeter wavelength. The disk is nearly edge-on and has a\nradius of ~ 60 AU. Interestingly, it shows a prominent equatorial dark lane\nsandwiched between two brighter features, due to relatively low temperature and\nhigh optical depth near the disk midplane. For the first time, this dark lane\nis seen at submillimeter wavelength, producing a \"hamburger\"-shaped appearance\nthat is reminiscent of the scattered-light image of an edge-on disk in optical\nand near infrared. Our observations open up an exciting possibility of directly\ndetecting and characterizing small disks around the youngest protostars through\nhigh-resolution imaging with ALMA, which provides strong constraints on\ntheories of disk formation.\n", "  The forest plays an important role in a watershed hydrology, regulating the\ntransfer of water within the system. The forest role in maintaining watersheds\nhydrological regime is still a controversial issue. Consequently, we use the\nSoil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate scenarios of land use\nin a watershed. In one of these scenarios we identified, through GIS\ntechniques, Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) which have watershed been\ndegraded and we considered these areas protected by forest cover. This scenario\nwas then compared to current usage scenario regarding watershed sediment yield\nand hydrological regime. The results showed a reduction in sediment yield of\n54% among different scenarios, at the same time that the watershed water yield\nwas reduced by 19.3%.\n", "  A number of earth's tremor spectral peaks show a persistent narrow bandwidth\nincompatible with any geophysical or instrumental origin. These peaks, located\nat frequencies lower than a few mHz, are in principle consistent with the earth\nstrain waves induced by monochromatic gravitational waves. Exploring this\nhypothesis under the current cosmological constraints yields that the tremor\npeaks below 2 mHz are in apparently significant coincidence with the\ntheoretical emission of two binary systems each consisting of a small main\nsequence star with mass $\\sim 10^{-1} M_{\\odot}$, captured by Sgr A* in a close\norbit.\n", "  We analyze the non-local shot noise in a multi-terminal junction formed by\ntwo Normal metal leads con- nected to one superconductor. Using the cross Fano\nfactor and the shot noise, we calculate the efficiency of the Cooper pair\nsplitting. The method is applied to d-wave and iron based superconductors. We\nde- termine that the contributions to the noise cross-correlation are due to\ncrossed Andreev reflections (CAR), elastic cotunneling, quasiparticles\ntransmission and local Andreev reflections. In the tunneling limit, the CAR\ncontribute positively to the noise cross-correlation whereas the other\nprocesses contribute negatively. Depending on the pair potential symmetry, the\nCAR are the dominant processes, giving as a result a high efficiency for Cooper\npair split. We propose the use of the Fano factor to test the efficiency of a\nCooper pair splitter device.\n", "  In this paper we introduce and formalize Substochastic Monte Carlo (SSMC)\nalgorithms. These algorithms, originally intended to be a better classical foil\nto quantum annealing than simulated annealing, prove to be worthy optimization\nalgorithms in their own right. In SSMC, a population of walkers is initialized\naccording to a known distribution on an arbitrary search space and varied into\nthe solution of some optimization problem of interest. The first argument of\nthis paper shows how an existing classical algorithm, \"Go-With-The-Winners\"\n(GWW), is a limiting case of SSMC when restricted to binary search and\nparticular driving dynamics.\n  Although limiting to GWW, SSMC is more general. We show that (1) GWW can be\nefficiently simulated within the SSMC framework, (2) SSMC can be exponentially\nfaster than GWW, (3) by naturally incorporating structural information, SSMC\ncan exponentially outperform the quantum algorithm that first inspired it, and\n(4) SSMC exhibits desirable search features in general spaces. Our approach\ncombines ideas from genetic algorithms (GWW), theoretical probability\n(Fleming-Viot processes), and quantum computing. Not only do we demonstrate\nthat SSMC is often more efficient than competing algorithms, but we also hope\nthat our results connecting these disciplines will impact each independently.\nAn implemented version of SSMC has previously enjoyed some success as a\ncompetitive optimization algorithm for Max-$k$-SAT.\n", "  The introduction of the Phase Tensor marked a major breakthrough in the\nunderstanding, analysis and treatment of galvanic distortion of the electric\nfield in the Magnetotelluric (MT) method. We build upon a recently formulated\nimpedance tensor decomposition into the known Phase Tensor and an Amplitude\nTensor that is shown to be complementary and algebraically independent of the\nPhase Tensor. This recent decomposition demonstrates that the Amplitude Tensor\ncontains inductive and galvanic information of the subsurface and that the\ninductive information is physically coupled to the one contained in the Phase\nTensor. In this work we present an algorithm that employs this last finding to\nshow that the MT galvanic electric distortion tensor can be separated from the\ninductive Amplitude Tensor and hence, that this distortion can be recovered for\nany given data up to a single constant usually denoted as galvanic shift.\nFirstly, to illustrate distortion effects on the Amplitude Tensor, we manually\napply distortion by matrix multiplication to synthetic impedance tensor data.\nThen, we use the observations of that analysis to define an objective function,\nwhich minimises when there is no distortion present in the Amplitude Tensor.\nSecondly, we describe our algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm to find\nthe optimal distortion tensor needed to correct the Amplitude Tensor, and\ntherewith the impedance tensor. Lastly, we test the performance of the proposed\nmethodology on synthetic data of known distortion and random distortion, and on\nfour real data sets. The real data sets, lit007/lit008 and lit901/lit902,\ndemonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm by revealing geological\nexpected results in the impedance data for the first time, which could not be\nachieved before by alternative methods.\n"]}
