irreducible\ncurve classes on Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The main tools are the theory of stable\npairs in the derived category and Behrend's constructible function approach to\nthe virtual class. We prove that for irreducible classes the stable pairs\ngenerating function satisfies the strong BPS rationality conjectures.\n  We define the contribution of each curve to the BPS invariants. A curve $C$\nonly contributes to the BPS invariants in genera lying between the geometric\ngenus and arithmetic genus of $C$. Complete formulae are derived for\nnonsingular and nodal curves.\n  A discussion of primitive classes on K3 surfaces from the point of view of\nstable pairs is given in the Appendix via calculations of Kawai-Yoshioka. A\nproof of the Yau-Zaslow formula for rational curve counts is obtained. A\nconnection is made to the Katz-Klemm-Vafa formula for BPS counts in all genera.\n", "  We report the discovery of burst oscillations at 414.7 Hz during a\nthermonuclear X-ray burst from the low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 4U 0614+091\nwith the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) onboard SWIFT. In a search of the BAT\narchive, we found two burst triggers consistent with the position of 4U\n0614+091. We searched both bursts for high frequency timing signatures, and\nfound a significant detection at 414.7 Hz during a 5 s interval in the cooling\ntail of the brighter burst. This result establishes the spin frequency of the\nneutron star in 4U 0614+091 as 415 Hz. The oscillation had an average amplitude\n(rms) of 14%, These results are consistent with those known for burst\noscillations seen in other LMXBs. The inferred ratio of the frequency\ndifference between the twin kHz QPOs, and the spin frequency in this source is\nstrongly inconsistent with either 0.5 or 1, and tends to support the recent\nsuggestions by Yin et al., and Mendez & Belloni, that the kHz QPO frequency\ndifference may not have a strong connection to the neutron star spin frequency.\n", "  We study the Navier-Stokes steady states for a low density monodisperse hard\nsphere granular gas (i.e, a hard sphere ideal monatomic gas with inelastic\ninterparticle collisions). We present a classification of the uniform steady\nstates that can arise from shear and temperature (or energy input) applied at\nthe boundaries (parallel walls). We consider both symmetric and asymmetric\nboundary conditions and find steady states not previously reported, including\nsheared states with linear temperature profiles. We provide explicit\nexpressions for the hydrodynamic profiles for all these steady states. Our\nresults are validated by the numerical solution of the Boltzmann kinetic\nequation for the granular gas obtained by the direct simulation Monte Carlo\nmethod, and by molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss the physical origin\nof the new steady states and derive conditions for the validity of\nNavier-Stokes hydrodynamics.\n", "  We study the linear stability of the flow of a viscous electrically\nconducting capillary fluid on a planar fixed plate in the presence of gravity\nand a uniform magnetic field. We first confirm that the Squire transformation\nfor MHD is compatible with the stress and insulating boundary conditions at the\nfree surface, but argue that unless the flow is driven at fixed Galilei and\ncapillary numbers, the critical mode is not necessarily two-dimensional. We\nthen investigate numerically how a flow-normal magnetic field, and the\nassociated Hartmann steady state, affect the soft and hard instability modes of\nfree surface flow, working in the low magnetic Prandtl number regime of\nlaboratory fluids. Because it is a critical layer instability, the hard mode is\nfound to exhibit similar behaviour to the even unstable mode in channel\nHartmann flow, in terms of both the weak influence of Pm on its neutral\nstability curve, and the dependence of its critical Reynolds number Re_c on the\nHartmann number Ha. In contrast, the structure of the soft mode's growth rate\ncontours in the (Re, alpha) plane, where alpha is the wavenumber, differs\nmarkedly between problems with small, but nonzero, Pm, and their counterparts\nin the inductionless limit. As derived from large wavelength approximations,\nand confirmed numerically, the soft mode's critical Reynolds number grows\nexponentially with Ha in inductionless problems. However, when Pm is nonzero\nthe Lorentz force originating from the steady state current leads to a\nmodification of Re_c(Ha) to either a sublinearly increasing, or decreasing\nfunction of Ha, respectively for problems with insulating and conducting walls.\nIn the former, we also observe pairs of Alfven waves, the upstream propagating\nwave undergoing an instability at large Alfven numbers.\n", "  We calculate the ground state current densities for 2+1 dimensional free\nfermion theories with local, translationally invariant boundary states.\nDeformations of the bulk wave functions close to the edge and boundary states\nboth may cause edge current divergencies, which have to cancel in realistic\nsystems. This yields restrictions on the parameters of quantum field theories\nwhich can arise as low energy limits of solid state systems. Some degree of\nLorentz invariance for boosts parallel to the boundary can be recovered, when\nthe cutoff is removed.\n", "  In plants, osmotically driven flows are believed to be responsible for\ntranslocation of sugar in the pipe-like phloem cell network, spanning the\nentire length of the plant. In this paper, we present an experimental and\ntheoretical study of transient osmotically driven flows through pipes with\nsemipermeable walls. We extend the experimental work of Eschrich, Evert and\nYoung \\cite[]{Eschrich:1972} by providing a more accurate version of their\nexperiment allowing for better comparison with theory. In the experiments we\nmeasure the dynamics and structure of a \"sugar front\", i.e. the transport and\ndecay of a sudden loading of sugar in a pipe which is closed in both ends. We\ninclude measurements of pressure inside the membrane tube allowing us to\ncompare the experiments directly with theory and, in particular, to confirm\nquantitatively the exponential decay of the front in a closed tube.In a novel\nsetup we are able to measure the entire concentration profile as the sugar\nfront moves. In contrast to previous studies we find very good agreement\nbetween experiment and theory.\n  In the limit of low axial resistance (valid in our experiments as well as in\nmany cases in plants) we show that the equations can be solved exactly by the\nmethod of characteristics yielding, in general, an implicit solution. Further\nwe show that under more general conditions the equations of motion can be\nrewritten as a single integro-differential equation, which can be readily\nsolved numerically. The applicability of our results to plants is discussed and\nit is shown that it is probable that the pressure-flow hypothesis can account\nfor short distance transport of sugar in plants.\n", "  In this article, the extensional flow and viscosity and the\nconverging-diverging geometry were examined as the basis of the peculiar\nviscoelastic behavior in porous media. The modified Bautista-Manero model,\nwhich successfully describes shearthinning, elasticity and thixotropic\ntime-dependency, was used for modeling the flow of viscoelastic materials which\nalso show thixotropic attributes. An algorithm, originally proposed by Philippe\nTardy, that employs this model to simulate steadystate time-dependent flow was\nimplemented in a non-Newtonian flow simulation code using pore-scale modeling\nand the initial results were analyzed. The findings are encouraging for further\nfuture development.\n", "  We report the results of molecular dynamics simulation of a spatiotemporal\nevolution of the locally photoexcited electrons and holes localized in two\nseparate layers. It is shown that the ring-shaped spatial pattern of\nluminescence forms due to the strong in-layer Coulomb interaction at high\nphotoexcitation power. In addition, the results predict (i) stationary spatial\noscillations of the electron density in quasi one-dimensional case and (ii)\ndynamical phase transition in the expansion of two-dimensional electron cloud\nwhen threshold electron concentration is reached. A possible reason of the\noscillations and a theoretical interpretation of the transition are suggested.\n", "  The dynamics of neutrally buoyant particles transported by a turbulent flow\nis investigated for spherical particles with radii of the order of the\nKolmogorov dissipative scale or larger. The pseudo-penalisation spectral method\nthat has been proposed by Pasquetti et al. (2008) is adapted to integrate\nnumerically the simultaneous dynamics of the particle and of the fluid. Such a\nmethod gives a unique handle on the limit of validity of point-particle\napproximations, which are generally used in applicative situations. Analytical\npredictions based on such models are compared to result of very well resolved\ndirect numerical simulations. Evidence is obtained that Faxen corrections give\ndominant finite-size corrections to velocity and acceleration fluctuations for\nparticle diameters up to four times the Kolmogorov scale. The dynamics of\nparticles with larger diameters is dominated by inertial-range physics, and is\nconsistent with predictions obtained from dimensional analysis.\n", "  A simple microscopic mechanism explaining the linear dependence of the\nradiative lifetime of free-moving two-dimensional excitons on their effective\ntemperature is suggested. It is shown that there exists a characteristic\neffective temperature (of about few Kelvin) defined by the exciton-acoustic\nphonon interaction at which the radiative lifetime is minimal. Below this\ntemperature the lifetime starts to increase with decreasing temperature. The\ncorrespondence with previous theoretical and experimental results is discussed.\n", "  A method is described for the reconstruction of the amplitude and phase of\nthe object exit wave function by phase-plate transmission electron microscopy.\nThe proposed method can be considered as in-line holography and requires three\nimages, taken with different phase shifts between undiffracted and diffracted\nelectrons induced by a suitable phase-shifting device. The proposed method is\napplicable for arbitrary object exit wave functions and non-linear image\nformation. Verification of the method is performed for examples of a simulated\ncrystalline object wave function and a wave function acquired with off-axis\nholography. The impact of noise on the reconstruction of the wave function is\ninvestigated.\n", "  The use of tank-treading as a means of propulsion for microswimmers in\nviscous shear flows is taken into exam. We discuss the possibility that a\nvesicle be able to control the drift in an external shear flow, by varying\nlocally the bending rigidity of its own membrane. By analytical calculation in\nthe quasi-spherical limit, the stationary shape and the orientation of the\ntank-treading vesicle in the external flow, are determined, working to lowest\norder in the membrane inhomogeneity. The membrane inhomogeneity acts in the\nshape evolution equation as an additional force term, that can be used to\nbalance the effect of the hydrodynamic stresses, thus allowing the vesicle to\nassume shapes and orientations that would otherwise be forbidden. The vesicle\nshapes and orientations required for migration transverse to the flow, together\nwith the bending rigidity profiles that would lead to such shapes and\norientations, are determined. A simple model is presented, in which a vesicle\nis able to migrate up or down the gradient of a concentration field, by\nstiffening or softening of its membrane, in response to the variations in the\nconcentration level experienced during tank-treading.\n", "  The recent discovery of a Higgs boson at the electroweak scale appears to\npoint toward supersymmetry, as the most likely mechanism for protecting a\nscalar boson mass from enormous radiative corrections. The earlier discovery of\nneutrino masses similarly appears to point toward grand unification of\nnongravitational forces, which permits (for neutrinos) Majorana masses, Dirac\nmasses, and a seesaw mechanism to drive the observed masses down to low values.\nA third major discovery, cosmic acceleration suggesting a relatively tiny\ncosmological constant, appears to point toward truly revolutionary new physics.\nMany other problems and mysteries also indicate a need for fresh ideas at the\nmost fundamental level. Here a picture is proposed in which standard physics\nand its extensions are obtained (through a nontrivial set of arguments) from\nstatistical counting and the local geography of our universe. The unavoidable\nqualitative predictions include supersymmetry, $SO(N)$ grand unification, and a\ndrastic diminishing of the usual cosmological constant. Some additional new\npredictions are more quantitative and should be testable in the near future.\nFor example, the theory predicts new fundamental spin $1/2$ particles which can\nbe produced in pairs through their couplings to vector bosons. The\nlowest-energy of these should have a mass $m_{1/2}$ comparable to the Higgs\nmass $m_h$ (with $m_{1/2} = m_h$ in the simplest model). These particles should\ntherefore be detectable in collider experiments, and they are also dark matter\ncandidates.\n", "  We investigate wind tunnel turbulence generated by both conventional and\nmulti-scale grids. Measurements were made in a tunnel which has a large\ntest-section, so that possible side wall effects are very small and the length\nassures that the turbulence has time to settle down to a homogeneous shear-free\nstate. The conventional and multi-scale grids were all designed to produce\nturbulence with the same integral scale, so that a direct comparison could be\nmade between the different flows. Our primary finding is that the behavior of\nthe turbulence behind our multi-scale grids is virtually identical to that\nbehind the equivalent conventional grid. In particular, all flows exhibit a\npower-law decay of energy, $u^2 \\sim t^{-n}$, where $n$ is very close to the\nclassical Saffman exponent of $n = 6/5$. Moreover, all spectra exhibit\nclassical Kolmogorov scaling, with the spectra collapsing on the integral\nscales at small $k$, and on the Kolmogorov micro-scales at large $k$. Our\nresults are at odds with some other experiments performed on similar\nmulti-scale grids, where significantly higher energy decay exponents and\nturbulence levels have been reported.\n", "  A consistent explanation of the formation of a ring-shaped pattern of exciton\nluminescence in GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum wells is suggested. The pattern\nconsists of two concentric rings around the laser excitation spot. It is shown\nthat the luminescence rings appear due to the in-layer transport of hot charge\ncarriers at high photoexcitation intensity. Interestingly, one of two causes of\nthis transport might involve self-organized criticality (SOC) that would be the\nfirst case of the SOC observation in semiconductor physics. We test this cause\nin a many-body numerical model by performing extensive molecular dynamics\nsimulations. The results show good agreement with experiments. Moreover, the\nsimulations have enabled us to identify the particular kinetic processes\nunderlying the formation of each of these two luminescence rings.\n", "  The stars in globular clusters are known to differ in their surface\nchemistry: the spectroscopic investigations in the last decades outlined the\npresence of star-to-star differences in the abundances of the light elements,\nup to aluminium (and possibly silicon), suggesting that some stars were\ncontaminated by an advanced proton-capture nucleosynthesis. The AGB stars are\none of the most promising candidates in producing the pollution of the\nintra-cluster medium, via the ejection of gas processed by Hot Bottom Burning,\nfrom which new stellar generations are formed. This work is focused on the\ndegree of nucleosynthesis involving magnesium, aluminium and silicon that these\nsources may experience. The key ingredient to determine the degree of magnesium\ndepletion, and the amount of aluminium that can be produced, is the rate of\nproton capture on Mg25, forming Al26; an increase in this cross-section by a\nfactor 2 with respect to the highest value allowed by the NACRE compilation\nallows to reproduce the extent of the Mg-depletion observed, and is in\nqualitative agreement with the positive Al-Si correlation observed in a few\nclusters. The main uncertainties associated with the macro- and micro-physics\ninput, are discussed and commented, and the comparison with recent\nspectroscopic results for the globular cluster showing some degree of Mg-Al\nanticorrelation and Al-Si correlation is presented.\n", "  Flow control with the goal of reducing the skin friction drag on the\nfluid-solid interface is an active fundamental research area, motivated by its\npotential for significant energy savings and reduced emissions in the transport\nsector. Customarily, the performance of drag reduction techniques in internal\nflows is evaluated under two alternative flow conditions, i.e. at constant mass\nflow rate or constant pressure gradient. Successful control leads to reduction\nof drag and pumping power within the former approach, whereas the latter leads\nto an increase of the mass flow rate and pumping power. In practical\napplications, however, money and time define the flow control challenge: a\ncompromise between the energy expenditure (money) and the corresponding\nconvenience (flow rate) achieved with that amount of energy has to be reached\nso as to accomplish a goal which in general depends on the specific\napplication. Based on this idea, we derive two dimensionless parameters which\nquantify the total energy consumption and the required time (convenience) for\ntransporting a given volume of fluid through a given duct. Performances of\nexisting drag reduction strategies as well as the influence of wall roughness\nare re-evaluated within the present framework; how to achieve the\n(application-dependent) optimum balance between energy consumption and\nconvenience is addressed. It is also shown that these considerations can be\nextended to external flows.\n", "  As the third stage of the project multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials, we\npresent, in the framework of 'discrete quantum mechanics' with pure imaginary\nshifts in one dimension, the multi-indexed Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials.\nThey are obtained from the original Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials by\nmultiple application of the discrete analogue of the Darboux transformations or\nthe Crum-Krein-Adler deletion of 'virtual state solutions' of type I and II, in\na similar way to the multi-indexed Laguerre, Jacobi and (q-)Racah polynomials\nreported earlier.\n", "  We present the systematic study of the resonant tunneling spectroscopy on a\nseries of ferromagnetic-semiconductor Ga1-xMnxAs with the Mn content x from\n~0.01 to 3.2%. The Fermi level of Ga1-xMnxAs exists in the band gap in the\nwhole x region. The Fermi level is closest to the valence band (VB) at x=1.0%\ncorresponding to the onset of ferromagnetism near the metal-insulator\ntransition (MIT), but it moves away from the VB as x increasing or decreasing\nfrom 1.0%. This anomalous behavior of the Fermi level indicates that the\nferromagnetism and MIT emerge in the Mn-derived impurity band.\n", "  We have analytically solved the spin wave excitations for the intercalated\nternary iron-selenide AFe$_{1.5}$Se$_2$ (A=K, Tl) in the $4\\times 2$ collinear\nantiferromagnetic order. It is found that there are one acoustic branch\n(gapless Goldstone mode) and two gapful optical branches of spin wave\nexcitations with each in double degeneracy. By examining the non-imaginary\nexcitation frequency condition, we can determine the corresponding phase\nboundary. The exchange couplings between Fe moments in AFe$_{1.5}$Se$_2$ are\nderived based on the first-principles total energy calculations. The Fe spin is\nfound to be $S=3/2$ through computing the antiferromagnetic quantum\nfluctuation. And it is further found that a very small spin-orientation\nanisotropy can remarkably suppress the antiferromagnetic quantum fluctuation.\nThe spin dynamical structure factors are calculated and discussed in\nassociation with neutron inelastic scattering experiment.\n", "  Our aim was to study the light curve periodicity of the solar analogue V352\nCMa and in particular show that the presence or absence of periodicity in low\namplitude light curves can be modelled with the Continuous Period Search (CPS)\nmethod. We applied the CPS method to 14 years of V-band photometry of V352 CMa\nand obtained estimates for the mean, amplitude, period and minima of the light\ncurves in the selected datasets. We also applied the Power Spectrum Method\n(PSM) to these datasets and compared the performance of this frequently applied\nmethod to that of CPS. We detected signs of a $11.7 \\pm 0.5$ year cycle in in\nthe mean brightness. The long-term average photometric rotation period was\n$7.24 \\pm 0.22$ days. The lower limit for the differential rotation coefficient\nwould be $|k| > 0.12$, if the law of solar surface differential rotation were\nvalid for V352 CMa and the period changes traced this phenomenon. Signs of\nstable active longitudes rotating with a period of $7.157 \\pm 0.002$ days were\ndetected from the epochs of the light minima with the Kuiper method. CPS\nperformed better than the traditional PSM, because the latter always used a\nsinusoidal model for the data even when this was clearly not the correct model.\n", "  While long spin coherence times and efficient single-qubit quantum control\nhave been implemented successfully in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond,\nthe controlled coupling of remote NV spin qubits remains challenging. Here, we\npropose and analyze a controlled-phase (CPHASE) gate for the spins of two NV\ncenters embedded in a common optical cavity and driven by two off-resonant\nlasers. In combination with previously demonstrated single-qubit gates, CPHASE\nallows for arbitrary quantum computations. The coupling of the NV spin to the\ncavity mode is based upon Raman transitions via the NV excited states and can\nbe controlled with the laser intensities and relative phase. We find\ncharacteristic laser frequencies at which the scattering amplitude of a laser\nphoton into the cavity mode is strongly dependent on the NV center spin. A\nscattered photon can be reabsorbed by another selectively driven NV center and\ngenerate a conditional phase (CPHASE) gate. Gate times around 200 ns are within\nreach, nearly three orders of magnitude shorter than typical NV spin coherence\ntimes of around 10 microseconds. The separation between the two interacting NV\ncenters is only limited by the extension of the cavity.\n", "  The baryon density enhancement in cosmic string wakes leads to a stronger\ncoupling of the spin temperature to the gas kinetic temperate inside these\nstring wakes than in the intergalactic medium (IGM). The Wouthuysen Field (WF)\neffect has the potential to enhance this coupling to such an extent that it may\nresult in the strongest and cleanest cosmic string signature in the currently\nplanned radio telescope projects. Here we consider this enhancement under the\nassumption that X-ray heating is not significant. We show that the size of this\neffect in a cosmic string wake leads to a brightness temperature at least two\ntimes more negative than in the surrounding IGM. If the SCI-HI [1, 2] or EDGES\n[3, 4] experiment confirm a WF absorption trough in the cosmic gas, then cosmic\nstring wakes should appear clearly in 21 cm redshift surveys of z = 10 to 30.\n", "  A field theory is constructed in the context of parameterized absolute\nparallelism geometry. The theory is shown to be a pure gravity one. It is\ncapable of describing the gravitational field and a material distribution in\nterms of the geometric structure of the geometry used (the parallelization\nvector fields). Three tools are used to attribute physical properties to the\ngeometric objects admitted by the theory. Poisson and Laplace equations are\nobtained in the linearized version of the theory. The spherically symmetric\nsolution of the theory, in free space, is found to coincide with the\nSchwarzschild exterior solution of the general theory of relativity. The theory\nrespects the weak equivalence principle in free space only. Gravity and\nmaterial distribution are not minimally coupled.\n", "  Tungstite (WO3.H2O) nanoparticles were synthesized using a simple and\ninexpensive low temperature and low pressure hydrothermal method by adding\nhydrochloric acid to diluted sodium tungstate solutions (Na2WO4.2H2O) at\ntemperatures below 5oC. A heat treatment at temperatures at or above 300oC\nresulted in a phase transformation to monoclinic WO3, while preserving the\nnanoparticles morphology. The products were characterized using powder x-ray\ndiffraction, transmission electron microscopy (including electron energy-loss\nspectroscopy and electron diffraction) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.\n", "  We investigate the existence and the orthogonality of the generalized Jack\nsymmetric functions which play an important role in the AGT relations. We show\ntheir orthogonality by deforming them to the generalized Macdonald symmetric\nfunctions.\n", "  We prove the KKV conjecture expressing Gromov-Witten invariants of K3\nsurfaces in terms of modular forms. Our results apply in every genus and for\nevery curve class. The proof uses the Gromov-Witten/Pairs correspondence for\nK3-fibered hypersurfaces of dimension 3 to reduce the KKV conjecture to\nstatements about stable pairs on (thickenings of) K3 surfaces. Using\ndegeneration arguments and new multiple cover results for stable pairs, we\nreduce the KKV conjecture further to the known primitive cases. Our results\nyield a new proof of the full Yau-Zaslow formula, establish new Gromov-Witten\nmultiple cover formulas, and express the fiberwise Gromov-Witten partition\nfunctions of K3-fibered 3-folds in terms of explicit modular forms.\n", "  The challenge of identifying symmetry-protected topological states (SPTs) is\ndue to their lack of symmetry-breaking order parameters and intrinsic\ntopological orders. For this reason, it is impossible to formulate SPTs under\nGinzburg-Landau theory or probe SPTs via fractionalized bulk excitations and\ntopology-dependent ground state degeneracy. However, the partition functions\nfrom path integrals with various symmetry twists are the universal SPT\ninvariants defining topological probe responses, fully characterizing SPTs. In\nthis work, we use gauge fields to represent those symmetry twists in closed\nspacetimes of any dimensionality and arbitrary topology. This allows us to\nexpress the SPT invariants in terms of continuum field theory. We show that SPT\ninvariants of pure gauge actions describe the SPTs predicted by group\ncohomology, while the mixed gauge-gravity actions describe the\nbeyond-group-cohomology SPTs, recently observed by Kapustin. We find new\nexamples of mixed gauge-gravity actions for U(1) SPTs in 4+1D via mixing the\ngauge first Chern class with a gravitational Chern-Simons term, or viewed as a\n5+1D Wess-Zumino-Witten term with a Pontryagin class. We rule out U(1) SPTs in\n3+1D mixed with a Stiefel-Whitney class. We also apply our approach to the\nbosonic/fermionic topological insulators protected by U(1) charge and\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ time-reversal symmetries whose pure gauge action is the axion\n$\\theta$-term. Field theory representations of SPT invariants not only serve as\ntools for classifying SPTs, but also guide us in designing physical probes for\nthem. In addition, our field theory representations are independently powerful\nfor studying group cohomology within the mathematical context.\n", "  We introduce and study a new mathematical structure in the generalised\n(quantum) cohomology theory for Grassmannians. Namely, we relate the Schubert\ncalculus to a quantum integrable system known in the physics literature as the\nasymmetric six-vertex model. Our approach offers a new perspective on already\nestablished and well-studied special cases, for example equivariant K-theory,\nand in addition allows us to formulate a conjecture on the so-far unknown case\nof quantum equivariant K-theory.\n", "  We study the ground state and the low-lying excitations of a trapped Bose gas\nin an isotropic harmonic potential for very small ($\\sim 3$) to very large\n($\\sim 10^7$) particle numbers. We use the correlated two-body basis functions\nand the shape-dependent van der Waals interaction in our many-body\ncalculations. We present an exhaustive study of the effect of inter-atomic\ncorrelations and the accuracy of the mean-field equations considering a wide\nrange of particle numbers. We calculate the ground state energy and the\none-body density for different values of the van der Waals parameter $C_{6}$.\nWe compare our results with those of the modified Gross-Pitaevskii results, the\ncorrelated Hartree hypernetted-chain equations (which also utilize the two-body\ncorrelated basis functions), as well as of the Diffusion Monte Carlo for hard\nsphere interactions. We observe the effect of the attractive tail of the van\nder Waals potential in the calculations of the one-body density over the truly\nrepulsive zero-range potential as used in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and\ndiscuss the finite-size effects. We also present the low-lying collective\nexcitations which are well described by a hydrodynamic model in the large\nparticle limit.\n", "  We prove that the definitions of the Kato class by the semigroup and by the\nresolvent of the L\\'{e}vy process on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ coincide if and only if 0\nis not regular for {0}. If 0 is regular for {0} then we describe both classes\nin detail. We also give an analytic reformulation of these results by means of\nthe characteristic (L\\'{e}vy-Khintchine) exponent of the process. The result\napplies to the time-dependent (non-autonomous) Kato class. As one of the\nconsequences we obtain a simultaneous time-space smallness condition equivalent\nto the Kato class condition given by the semigroup.\n", "  We consider the (finite-dimensional) small quantum group $\\bar{U}_q sl(2)$ at\n$q=i$. We show that $\\bar{U}_i sl(2)$ does not allow for an R-matrix, even\nthough $U \\otimes V \\cong V \\otimes U$ holds for all finite-dimensional\nrepresentations $U,V$ of $\\bar{U}_i sl(2)$. We then give an explicit\ncoassociator $\\Phi$ and an R-matrix $R$ such that $\\bar{U}_i sl(2)$ becomes a\nquasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra.\n  Our construction is motivated by the two-dimensional chiral conformal field\ntheory of symplectic fermions with central charge $c=-2$. There, a braided\nmonoidal category, $\\mathcal{SF}$, has been computed from the factorisation and\nmonodromy properties of conformal blocks, and we prove that\n$\\mathrm{Rep}\\,(\\bar{U}_i sl(2),\\Phi,R)$ is braided monoidally equivalent to\n$\\mathcal{SF}$.\n", "  We study the dynamical Casimir effect in an electromagnetic cavity containing\na Kerr medium. We obtain approximate expressions for the time evolution\noperator as well as for the number operator in the Heisenberg representation.\nWe have found that the generation of photons from quantum vacuum is strongly\naffected by the presence of the Kerr medium, sharing physical features with the\ncase of two two-level atoms in a cavity with oscillating walls. The nonlinear\nmedium produces a saturation effect in the photon generation which shows strong\noscillations whose frequency increases with the intensity of the nonlinear\nmedium. We expect that these results could be relevant for any experimental\nstudy involving the dynamical Casimir effect that is willing to incorporate\nKerr nonlinearities.\n", "  We consider the sl(2)_q-invariant open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum spin chain of\nfinite length N. For the case that q is a root of unity, we propose a formula\nfor the number of admissible solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations in terms\nof dimensions of irreducible representations of the Temperley-Lieb algebra; and\na formula for the degeneracies of the transfer matrix eigenvalues in terms of\ndimensions of tilting sl(2)_q-modules. These formulas include corrections that\nappear if two or more tilting modules are spectrum-degenerate. For the XX case\n(q=exp(i pi/2)), we give explicit formulas for the number of admissible\nsolutions and degeneracies. We also consider the cases of generic q and the\nisotropic (q->1) limit. Numerical solutions of the Bethe equations up to N=8\nare presented. Our results are consistent with the Bethe ansatz solution being\ncomplete.\n", "  Quantum fluctuations of local quantities can be a direct signature of\nentanglement in an extended quantum many-body system. Hence they may serve as a\ntheoretical (as well as an experimental) tool to detect the spatial properties\nof the entanglement entropy of a subsystem. In the ground state of quantum\nmany-body systems, its scaling is typically linear in the boundary of the\nsubsystem (area law). Here we propose a microscopic insight into the spatial\nstructure of entanglement and fluctuations using the concept of \\emph{contour},\nrecently introduced to decompose the bipartite entanglement entropy of lattice\nfree fermions between two extended regions $A$ and $B$ into contributions from\nsingle sites in $A$. We generalize the notion of contour to the entanglement of\nany quadratic (bosonic or fermionic) lattice Hamiltonian, as well as to\nparticle-number fluctuations. The entanglement and fluctuations contours are\nfound to generally decay when moving away from the boundary between $A$ and\n$B$. We show that in the case of free fermions the decay of the entanglement\ncontour follows closely that of the fluctuation contour. In the case of\nBose-condensed interacting bosons, treated via the Bogoliubov and spin-wave\napproximations, such a link cannot be established -- fluctuation and\nentanglement contours are found to be radically different, as they lead to a\nlogarithmically violated area law for fluctuations, and to a strict area law of\nentanglement. Analyzing in depth the role of the zero-energy Goldstone mode of\nspin-wave theory, and of the corresponding lowest-energy mode in the\nentanglement spectrum, we unveil a subtle interplay between the special contour\nand energy scaling of the latter, and universal additive logarithmic\ncorrections to entanglement area law discussed extensively in the recent\nliterature.\n", "  The heavy fermion intermetallic compound URu2Si2 exhibits a \"hidden-order\"\nphase below the temperature of 17.5 K, which supports both anomalous metallic\nbehavior and unconventional superconductivity. While these individual phenomena\nhave been investigated in detail, it remains unclear how they are related to\neach other and to what extent uranium f-electron valence fluctuations influence\neach one. Here we use ligand site substituted URu2Si2-xPx to establish their\nevolution under electronic tuning. We find that while hidden order is\nmonotonically suppressed and destroyed for x $\\leq$ 0.035, the superconducting\nstrength evolves through a dome that is centered near $x$ $\\approx$ 0.01 and\nterminates near $x$ $\\approx$ 0.028. This behavior reveals that hidden order\ndepends strongly on tuning outside of the U f-electron shells. It also suggests\nthat while hidden order provides an environment for superconductivity and\nanomalous metallic behavior, it's fluctuations are not solely responsible for\ntheir progression.\n", "  Many time series produced by complex systems are empirically found to follow\npower-law distributions with different exponents $\\alpha$. By permuting the\nindependently drawn samples from a power-law distribution, we present\nnon-trivial bounds on the memory strength (1st-order autocorrelation) as a\nfunction of $\\alpha$, which are markedly different from the ordinary $\\pm 1$\nbounds for Gaussian or uniform distributions. When $1 < \\alpha \\leq 3$, as\n$\\alpha$ grows bigger, the upper bound increases from 0 to +1 while the lower\nbound remains 0; when $\\alpha > 3$, the upper bound remains +1 while the lower\nbound descends below 0. Theoretical bounds agree well with numerical\nsimulations. Based on the posts on Twitter, ratings of MovieLens, calling\nrecords of the mobile operator Orange, and browsing behavior of Taobao, we find\nthat empirical power-law distributed data produced by human activities obey\nsuch constraints. The present findings explain some observed constraints in\nbursty time series and scale-free networks, and challenge the validity of\nmeasures like autocorrelation and assortativity coefficient in heterogeneous\nsystems.\n", "  We address some key conditions under which many-body lattice models, intended\nmainly as simulated condensed matter systems, can be investigated via immersed,\nfully controllable quantum objects, namely quantum probes. First, we present a\nprotocol that, for a certain class of many-body systems, allows for full\nmomentum resolved spectroscopy using one single probe. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate how one can extract the two-point correlations using two entangled\nprobes. We apply our theoretical proposal to two well-known exactly solvable\nlattice models, a 1D Kitaev chain and 2D superfluid Bose-Hubbard model, and\nshow its accuracy as well as its robustness against external noise.\n", "  A problem is addressed of minimization of the number of measurements needed\nfor digital image acquisition and reconstruction with a given accuracy. A\nsampling theory based method of image sampling and reconstruction is suggested\nthat allows to draw near the minimal rate of image sampling defined by the\nsampling theory. Presented and discussed are also results of experimental\nverification of the method and its possible applicability extensions.\n", "  Three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals have hitherto stimulated\nunprecedented research interests as a new class of quantum materials. Breaking\ncertain types of symmetries has been proposed to enable the manipulation of\nDirac fermions; and that was soon realized by external modulations such as\nmagnetic fields. However, an intrinsic manipulation of Dirac states, which is\nmore efficient and desirable, remains a significant challenge. Here, we report\na systematic study of quasi-particle dynamics and band evolution in Cd3As2 thin\nfilms with controlled Chromium (Cr) doping by both magneto-infrared\nspectroscopy and electrical transport. For the first time, we observe\nsquare-root-B relation of inter-Landau-level resonance in undoped Cd3As2 Dirac\nsemimetal, an important signature of ultra-relativistic Dirac state\ninaccessible in previous optical experiments. A crossover from quantum to\nquasi-classical behavior makes it possible to directly probe the mass of Dirac\nfermions. Importantly, Cr doping allows for a Dirac mass acquisition and\ntopological phase transition enabling a desired dynamic control of Dirac\nfermions. Corroborating with the density-functional theory calculations, we\nshow that the mass generation is essentially driven by explicit C4 rotation\nsymmetry breaking and the resultant Dirac gap engineering through Cr\nsubstitution for Cd atoms. The manipulation of the system symmetry and Dirac\nmass in Cd3As2 thin films provides a tuning knob to explore the exotic states\nstemming from the parent phase of Dirac semimetals.\n", "  Studying RS CVn binaries is challenging, because in addition to spot\nactivity, other effects such as mass transfer between the components and\ngravitational distortion of their spherical forms may distort their light\ncurves. Such effects can, however, be removed from the data by subtracting a\nmean light curve phased with the orbital period. We study a quarter of a\ncentury of standard Johnson differential V photometry of the RS CVn binary BM\nCVn. Our main aims are to determine the activity cycles, the rate of surface\ndifferential rotation and the rotation period of the active longitudes of BM\nCVn. The Continuous Period Search (CPS) is applied to the photometry. The\nchanges of the mean and amplitude of the light curves are used to search for\nactivity cycles. The rotation period changes give an estimate of the rate of\nsurface differential rotation. The Kuiper method is applied to the epochs of\nthe primary and secondary minima to search for active longitudes. The\nphotometry reveals the presence of a stable mean light curve (MLC) connected to\nthe orbital period P_orb = 20d.6252 of this binary. We remove this MLC from the\noriginal V magnitudes which gives us the corrected V' magnitudes. These two\nsamples of V and V' data are analysed separately with CPS. The fraction of\nunreliable CPS models decreases when the MLC is removed. The same significant\nactivity cycle of approximately 12.5 years is detected in both V and V'\nsamples. The estimate for the surface differential rotation coefficient, k >=\n0.10, is the same for both samples, but the number of unrealistic period\nestimates decreases after removing the MLC. The same active longitude period of\nP_al = 20d.511 +- 0d.005 is detected in the V and V' magnitudes. This long-term\nregularity in the epochs of primary and secondary minima of the light curves is\nnot caused by the MLC. On the contrary, the MLC hampers the detection of active\nlongitudes.\n", "  We introduce two new singularity detection criteria based on the work of\nDuchon-Robert (DR) [J. Duchon and R. Robert, Nonlinearity, 13, 249 (2000)], and\nEyink [G.L. Eyink, Phys. Rev. E, 74 (2006)] which allow for the local detection\nof singularities with scaling exponent $h\\leqslant1/2$ in experimental flows,\nusing PIV measurements. We show that in order to detect such singularities, one\ndoes not need to have access to the whole velocity field inside a volume but\ncan instead look for them from stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV)\ndata on a plane. We discuss the link with the Beale-Kato-Majda (BKM) [J.T.\nBeale, T. Kato, A. Majda, Commun. Math. Phys., 94, 61 (1984)] criterion, based\non the blowup of vorticity, which applies to singularities of Navier-Stokes\nequations. We illustrate our discussion using tomographic PIV data obtained\ninside a high Reynolds number flow generated inside the boundary layer of a\nwind tunnel. In such a case, BKM and DR criteria are well correlated with each\nother.\n", "  The groundbreaking works in graphene and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) over the\npast decade, and the recent discovery of borophene draw immediate attention to\nthe underexplored borophene nanoribbons (BNRs). We herein report a density\nfunctional theory (DFT) study of the geometric, electronic and magnetic\nproperties of BNRs as a function of orientation (denoted as BxNRs and ByNRs\nwith the orientation along x- and y-axis, respectively), ribbon width (Nx, Ny =\n4 to 15), and hydrogenation effects. We found that the anisotropic quasi-planar\ngeometric structure of BNRand its edge states profoundly govern the electronic\nand magnetic properties. Pristine ByNRs adopt a magnetic ground state,\nanti-ferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) depending on the ribbon width,\nwhile pristine BxNRs are non-magnetic (NM). Upon hydrogenation, all BNRs become\nNM. Interestingly, both pristine and hydrogenated ByNRs undergo a\nmetal-semiconductor-metal transition at Ny = 7, while BxNRs remain metallic.\n", "  We use a semi-analytical model of stimulated thermal Rayleigh scattering to\npresent theoretical study of seed power on mode instability with the presence\nof photodarkening. The behavior of mode instabilities as a function of seed\npower has been investigated. The nonlinear dependence of the threshold with\nlower seed powers is ascribed to the influence of gain saturation while the\nreduction behavior of the threshold with higher seed powers is put down to the\neffects of photodarkening, which agrees well with the experimental results.\n", "  We construct a matter-wave beam splitter using 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate\non an atom chip. Through the use of radio-frequency-induced double-well\npotentials, we were able to split a BEC into two clouds separated by distances\nranging from 2.8 {\\mu}m to 57 {\\mu}m. Interference between these two freely\nexpanding BECs has been observed. By varying the rf-field amplitude, frequency,\nor polarization, we investigate behaviors of the beam-splitter. From the\nperspective of practical use, our BEC manipulation system is suitable for\napplication to interferometry since it is compact and the repetition rate is\nhigh due to the anodic bonded atom chip on the vacuum cell. The portable system\noccupies a volume of 0.5 m3 and operates at a repetition rate as high as ~0.2\nHz.\n", "  We report Dirac monopoles with polar-core vortex induced by spin-orbit\ncoupling in ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensates, which are attached to two\nnodal vortex lines along the vertical axis. These monopoles are more stable in\nthe time scale of experiment and can be detected through directly imaging\nvortex lines. When the strength of spin-orbit coupling increases, Dirac\nmonopoles with vortex can be transformed into those with square lattice. In the\npresence of spin-orbit coupling, increasing the strength of interaction can\ninduce a cyclic phase transition from Dirac monopoles with polar-core vortex to\nthose with Mermin-Ho vortex. The spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates\nnot only provide a new unique platform for investigating exotic monopoles and\nrelevant phase transitions, but also can preserve stable monopoles after a\nquadrupole field is turned off.\n", "  We revisit model calculations of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and show\nthat, in isotropic Rashba-coupled two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with\npointlike potential impurities, the full solution of the semiclassical\nBoltzmann equation (SBE) may differ from the widely-used $1/\\tau^{||}$ &\n$1/\\tau^{\\perp}$ solution [Phys. Rev. B 68, 165311 (2003)]. Our approach to AHE\nis analogous to the SBE-based analysis of the anisotropic magnetoresistance\nleading to an integral equation for the distribution function [Phys. Rev. B 79,\n045427 (2009)] but in the present case, we reduce the description to\nband-index-dependent transport relaxation times. When both Rashba bands are\npartially occupied, these are determined by solving a system of linear\nequations. Detailed calculations show that, for intrinsic and hybrid skew\nscatterings the difference between $1/\\tau^{||}$ & $1/\\tau^{\\perp}$ and the\nfull solution of SBE is notable for large Fermi energies. For coordinate-shift\neffects, the side-jump velocity acquired in the inter-band elastic scattering\nprocess is shown to be more important for larger Rashba coupling and may even\nexceed the intra-band one for the outer Rashba band. The coordinate-shift\ncontribution to AHE in the considered case notably differs from that in the\nlimit of smooth disorder potential analyzed before.\n", "  We introduce PyCFTBoot, a wrapper designed to reduce the barrier to entry in\nconformal bootstrap calculations that require semidefinite programming.\nSymengine and SDPB are used for the most intensive symbolic and numerical steps\nrespectively. After reviewing the built-in algorithms for conformal blocks, we\nexplain how to use the code through a number of examples that verify past\nresults. As an application, we show that the multi-correlator bootstrap still\nappears to single out the Wilson-Fisher fixed points as special theories in\ndimensions between 3 and 4 despite the recent proof that they violate\nunitarity.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of finite degree-of-freedom, planar mechanical\nsystems with multiple sliding, unilateral frictional point contacts. A complete\nclassification of systems with 2 sliding contacts is given. The contact-mode\nbased approach of rigid body mechanics is combined with linear stability\nanalysis using a compliant contact model to determine the feasibility and the\nstability of every possible contact mode in each class. Special forms of\nnon-stationary contact dynamics including \"impact without collision\" and\n\"reverse chattering\" are also investigated. Many types of solution\ninconsistency and the indeterminacy are identified and new phenomena related to\nPainlev\\'e\"s non-existence and non-uniqueness paradoxes are discovered. Among\nothers, we show that the non-existence paradox is not fully resolvable by\nconsidering impulsive contact forces. These results contribute to a growing\nbody of evidence that rigid body mechanics cannot be developed into a complete\nand self-consistent theory in the presence of contacts and friction.\n", "  We present deep near-infrared HST/WFC3 observations of the young supermassive\nGalactic star cluster Westerlund 1 and an adjacent control field. The depth of\nthe data is sufficient to derive the mass function for the cluster as a\nfunction of radius down to 0.15 M$_\\odot$ in the outer parts of the cluster. We\nidentify for the first time a flattening in the mass function (in logarithmic\nunits) at a mass range that is consistent with that of the field and nearby\nembedded clusters. Through log-normal functional fits to the mass functions we\nfind the nominal peak mass to be comparable to that of the field and nearby\nembedded star clusters. The width of a log-normal fit appears slightly narrow\ncompared to the width of the field IMF, closer to the values found for globular\nclusters. The subsolar content within the cluster does not appear to be mass\nsegregated in contrast to the findings for the supersolar content. The total\nmass of Westerlund 1 is estimated to be 44-57 $\\times 10^3$ M$_\\odot$ where the\nmain uncertainty is the choice of the isochrone age and the higher mass slope.\nComparing the photometric mass with the dynamically determined mass, Westerlund\n1 is sufficiently massive to remain bound and could potentially evolve into a\nlow-mass globular cluster.\n", "  In this paper, we numerically study the non-Abelian statistics of the\nzero-energy Majorana fermions on the end of Majorana chain and show its\napplication to quantum computing by mapping it to a spin model with special\nsymmetry. In particular, by using transverse-field Ising model with Z2\nsymmetry, we verify the nontrivial non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions.\nNumerical evidence and comparison in both Majorana-representation and\nspin-representation are presented. The degenerate ground states of a symmetry\nprotected spin chain therefore previde a promising platform for topological\nquantum computation.\n", "  We report a new result of the temperature-dependent average energy expended\nper electron-hole (e-h) pair, $\\varepsilon$, for germanium detectors. Applying\nenergy partition mechanism in ionization for a given energy deposition, the\nFano factor and the value of $\\varepsilon$ can be determined separately.\nSubsequently, we illustrate the variation of $\\varepsilon$ as a function of\ntemperature. The impact of $\\varepsilon$ on the energy threshold and energy\nscale for germanium detectors at a given temperature is evaluated. We\ndemonstrate an absolute energy scale function of low-energy recoils for\ngermanium detectors in the direct detection of dark matter particles.\n", "  In this paper, the mathematical properties and numerical discretizations of\nmultiphase models that simulate the phase separation of an $N$-component\nmixture are studied. For the general choice of phase variables, the unisolvent\nproperty of the coefficient matrix involved in the $N$-phase models based on\nthe pairwise surface tensions is established. Moreover, the symmetric\npositive-definite property of the coefficient matrix on an $(N-1)$-dimensional\nhyperplane --- which is of fundamental importance to the well-posedness of the\nmodels --- can be proved equivalent to some physical condition for pairwise\nsurface tensions. The $N$-phase Allen-Cahn and $N$-phase Cahn-Hilliard\nequations can then be derived from the free-energy functional. A natural\nproperty is that the resulting dynamics of concentrations are independent of\nphase variables chosen. Finite element discretizations for $N$-phase models can\nbe obtained as a natural extension of the existing discretizations for the\ntwo-phase model. The discrete energy law of the numerical schemes can be proved\nand numerically observed under some restrictions pertaining to time step size.\nNumerical experiments including the spinodal decomposition and the evolution of\ntriple junctions are described in order to investigate the effect of pairwise\nsurface tensions.\n", "  The two stage electron acceleration model [arXiv: 1512.02411 and arXiv:\n1512.07546] is extended to the study of laser magnetized-plasmas interactions\nat relativistic intensities and in the presence of large-scale preformed\nplasmas. It is shown that the cut-off electron kinetic energy is controllable\nby the external magnetic field strength and directions. Further studies\nindicate that for a right-hand circularly polarized laser (RH-CP) of intensity\n$10^{20}\\ \\text{W}/\\text{cm}^2$ and pre-plasma scale length $10\\ \\mu\\text{m}$,\nthe cut-off electron kinetic energy can be as high as $500\\ \\text{MeV}$, when a\nhomogeneous external magnetic field of exceeding $10000\\ \\text{T}$ (or\n$B=\\omega_{c}/\\omega_0>1$) is loaded along the laser propagation direction,\nwhich is a significant increase compared with that $120\\ \\text{MeV}$ without\nexternal magnetic field. A laser front sharpening mechanism is identified at\nrelativistic laser magnetized-plasmas interactions with\n$B=\\omega_{c}/\\omega_0>1$, which is responsible for these super-high energetic\nelectrons.\n", "  Gravitational wave generation by a strong shock wave in the interaction of\nhigh power laser with matter is analyzed in linear approximation of\ngravitational theory. The analytical formulas and estimates are derived for the\nmetric perturbations and the radiated power of the generated gravitational\nwaves. Furthermore the characteristics of polarization and the behavior of test\nparticles are investigated in the presence of gravitational wave which will be\nimportant for the detection.\n", "  We employ the MarsWRF general circulation model (GCM) to test the predictions\nof a new physical hypothesis: a weak coupling of the orbital and rotational\nangular momenta of extended bodies is predicted to give rise to cycles of\nintensification and relaxation of circulatory flows within atmospheres. The\ndynamical core of the GCM has been modified to include the orbit-spin coupling\naccelerations due to solar system dynamics for the years 1920-2030. The\nmodified GCM is first subjected to extensive testing and validation. We compare\nforced and unforced model outcomes for large-scale zonal and meridional flows,\nand for near-surface wind velocities and surface wind stresses. The predicted\ncycles of circulatory intensification and relaxation within the modified GCM\nare observed. Most remarkably, the modified GCM reproduces conditions favorable\nfor the occurrence of perihelion-season global-scale dust storms on Mars in\nyears in which such storms were observed. A strengthening of the meridional\noverturning (Hadley) circulation during the dust storm season occurs in the GCM\nin all previously known years with perihelion-season global-scale dust storms.\nThe increased upwelling produced in the southern hemisphere in southern summer\nmay facilitate the transport of dust to high altitudes in the Mars atmosphere\nduring the dust storm season, where radiative heating may further strengthen\nthe circulation. Significantly increased surface winds and surface wind\nstresses are also obtained. These may locally facilitate saltation and dust\nlifting from the surface. The numerical simulations constitute proof of concept\nfor the orbit-spin coupling hypothesis under evaluation.\n", "  Strain can induce a topological phase transition in bismuth dichalcogenides.\nWe present the phase diagram for 3D topological insulators Bi$_2$Te$_3$,\nSb$_2$Te$_3$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Se$_3$ with uniaxial and biaxal strain,\nwhich show metallic and insulating phases, both topologically trivial and\nnon-trivial. In particular, uniaxial tension can drive Sb$_2$Te$_3$ into a\ntopologically trivial insulating phase. Thus, we propose a\nSb$_2$Te$_3$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ heterojunction in which a topological interface state\narises in the common gap of this topological insulator-normal insulator\nheterojunction that can be switched on or off by means of uniaxial strain. This\ninterface state is confined in the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ subsystem and is physically\nprotected from ambient impurities. Therefore, Sb$_2$Te$_3$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$\nheterojunctions can host robust helical interface states with promising\nspintronic applications.\n", "  In this paper, breakup of liquid jet is simulated using smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) which is a meshless Lagrangian numerical method. For this\naim, flow governing equations are discretized based on SPH method. In this\npaper, SPHysics open source code has been utilized for numerical solutions.\nTherefore, the mentioned code has been developed by adding the surface tension\neffects. The proposed method is then validated using dam break with obstacle\nproblem. Finally, simulation of twodimensional liquid jet flow is carried out\nand its breakup behavior considering one-phase flow is investigated. Length of\nliquid breakup in Rayleigh regime is calculated for various flow conditions\nsuch as different Reynolds and Weber numbers and the results are validated by\nan experimental correlation. The whole numerical solutions are accomplished for\nboth Wendland and cubic spline kernel functions and Wendland kernel function\ngave more accurate results. The results are compared to MPS method for inviscid\nliquid as well. The accomplished modeling showed that smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) is an efficient method for simulation of liquid jet breakup\nphenomena.\n", "  It has been shown that gravitational waves propagate through ideal fluids\nwithout experiencing any dispersion or dissipation. However, if the medium has\na non-zero shear viscosity $\\eta$ , gravitational waves will be dissipated at a\nrate proportional to $G \\,\\eta$. We constrain dark matter and dark energy\nmodels with non-zero shear viscosity by calculating the dissipation of\ngravitational waves from GW150914 which propagate over a distance of $410\\, $\nMpc through the dissipative fluid and comparing the data with the theoretical\nprediction. This provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the fact that\nfuture observations gravitational waves at LIGO have the potential of better\nconstraining the viscosity of dark matter and dark energy.\n", "  Fluid simulations show that when a sinusoidal density modulation is\nsuperimposed on a linear density profile, convective instabilities can become\nabsolutely unstable. This conversion can occur for two-plasmon-decay and\nstimulated Raman Scattering instabilities under realistic direct-drive inertial\nconfinement fusion conditions and can affect hot electron generation and laser\nenergy deposition. Analysis of the three-wave model shows that a sufficiently\nlarge change of the density gradient in a linear density profile can turn\nconvective instabilities into absolute ones. An analytical expression is given\nfor the threshold of the gradient change, which depends on the convective gain\nonly.\n", "  We consider the problem of non degenerate in energy metastable states forming\na series in the framework of reversible finite state space Markov chains. We\nassume that starting from the state at higher energy the system necessarily\nvisits the second one before reaching the stable state. In this framework, we\ngive a sharp estimate of the exit time from the metastable state at higher\nenergy and, on the proper exponential time scale, we prove an addition rule. As\nan application of the theory, we study the Blume-Capel model in the zero\nchemical potential case.\n", "  Boson sampling is a problem intractable for classical computers, but can be\nnaturally solved on a specialized photonic quantum simulator which requires\nless resources than building a universal quantum computer. The biggest\nchallenge to implement boson sampling with a large number of photons has been\nthe lack of reliable single-photon sources. Here we demonstrate a scalable\narchitecture of boson sampling using a solid-state single-photon source with\nsimultaneously high efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability. The single\nphotons are time-bin encoded and interfered in an electrically programmable\nloop-based network. We implement and validate boson sampling with input three\nand four single photons, and track the dynamical multi-photon evolution inside\nthe circuit. With further refinement of the system efficiency, our approach may\nbe feasible to be scaled up to >20-boson sampling to outperform classical\ncomputers, and thus provide experimental evidence against the Extended\nChurch-Turing Thesis.\n", "  As the second component of SPARC (Simulation Package for Ab-initio Real-space\nCalculations), we present an accurate and efficient finite-difference\nformulation and parallel implementation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) for\nextended systems. Specifically, employing a local formulation of the\nelectrostatics, the Chebyshev polynomial filtered self-consistent field\niteration, and a reformulation of the non-local force component, we develop a\nfinite-difference framework wherein both the energy and atomic forces can be\nefficiently calculated to within desired accuracies in DFT. We demonstrate\nusing a wide variety of materials systems that SPARC achieves high convergence\nrates in energy and forces with respect to spatial discretization to reference\nplane-wave result; exponential convergence in energies and forces with respect\nto vacuum size for slabs and wires; energies and forces that are consistent and\ndisplay negligible `egg-box' effect; accurate properties of crystals, slabs,\nand wires; and negligible drift in molecular dynamics simulations. We also\ndemonstrate that the weak and strong scaling behavior of SPARC is similar to\nwell-established and optimized plane-wave implementations for systems\nconsisting up to thousands of electrons, but with a significantly reduced\nprefactor. Overall, SPARC represents an attractive alternative to plane-wave\ncodes for performing DFT simulations of extended systems.\n", "  In the study of phase transitions a very few models are accessible to exact\nsolution. In the most cases analytical simplifications have to be done or some\nnumerical technique has to be used to get insight about their critical\nproperties. Numerically, the most common approaches are those based in Monte\nCarlo simulations together finite size scaling analysis. The use of Monte Carlo\ntechniques requires the estimate of quantities like the specific heat or\nsusceptibilities in a wide range of temperature or the construction of the\ndensity of states in large intervals of energy. Although many of these\ntechniques are well developed they may be very time consuming when the system\nsize becomes large enough. It should be suitable to have a method that could\nsurpass those difficulties.\n  In this work we present an iterative method to study the critical behavior of\na system based on the partial knowledge of the complex Fisher zeros set of the\npartition function. The method is general with advantages over most\nconventional techniques since it does not need to identify any order parameter\n\\emph{a priori}. The critical temperature and exponents can be obtained with\ngreat precision even in the most unamenable cases like the two dimensional $XY$\nmodel. To test the method and to show how it works we applied it to some\nselected models where the transitions are well known: The 2D Ising, Potts and\nXY models and to a homopolymer system. Our choice cover systems with first\norder, continuous and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions as well as\nthe homopolymer that has two pseudo-transitions. The strategy can easily be\nadapted to any model, classical or quantum, once we are able to build the\ncorresponding energy probability distribution.\n", "  Recasting the $N$-point one loop scalar integral as a probabilistic problem,\nallows the derivation of integral recurrence relations as well as exact\nanalytical expressions in the most common cases. $\\epsilon$ expansions are\nderived by writing a formula that relates an $N$-point function in decimal\ndimension to an $N$-point function in integer dimension. As an example, we give\nrelations for the massive 5-point function in dimension $n=4-2\\epsilon$,\n$n=6-2\\epsilon$. The reduction of tensor integrals of rank 2 with $N=5$ is\nachieved showing the method's potential. Hypergeometric functions are not\nneeded but only integration of arcsine function whose analytical continuation\nis well known.\n", "  Cells may control fluctuations in protein levels by means of negative\nautoregulation, where transcription factors bind DNA sites to repress their own\nproduction. Theoretical studies have assumed a single binding site for the\nrepressor, while in most species it is found that multiple binding sites are\narranged in clusters. We study a stochastic description of negative\nautoregulation with multiple binding sites for the repressor. We find that\nincreasing the number of binding sites induces regular bursting of gene\nproducts. By tuning the threshold for repression, we show that multiple binding\nsites can also suppress fluctuations. Our results highlight possible roles for\nthe presence of multiple binding sites of negative autoregulators.\n", "  We use particle-transport simulations to show that secondary pions play a\ncrucial role for the development of the hadronic cascade and therefore for the\nproduction of neutrons and photons from thick spallation targets. In\nparticular, for the n_TOF lead spallation target, irradiated with 20 GeV/c\nprotons, neutral pions are involved in the production of ~90% of the\nhigh-energy photons; charged pions participate in ~40% of the integral neutron\nyield. Nevertheless, photon and neutron yields are shown to be relatively\ninsensitive to large changes of the average pion multiplicity in the individual\nspallation reactions. We characterize this robustness as a peculiar property of\nhadronic cascades in thick targets.\n", "  We develop the concept of scattering matrix and we use it to perform stable\nnumerical calculations of photo-emission from nano-tips. Electrons move in an\nexternal space and time dependent nonperturbative electric field. We apply our\nalgorithm for different strengths and spatial configurations of the field.\n", "  Questions on the nature of edge reconstruction and \"where does the current\nflow\" in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) have been debated for years. Moreover,\nthe recent observation of proliferation of \"upstream\" neutral modes in the\nfractional QHE raised doubts about the present models of edge channels. In this\narticle we focus on hole-conjugate states, nu=2/3 and nu=3/5, and present a new\npicture of their edge reconstruction. For example, while the present model for\nnu=2/3 consists of a single downstream charge channel with conductance 2/3\ne^2/h and an upstream neutral mode, we show that the current is carried by two\nseparate downstream edge channels, each with conductance 1/3 e^2/h, accompanied\nby upstream neutral mode(s). We find that if the two downstream channels are\nnot equilibrated, inter-mode equilibration (via particle exchange) takes place\nover a distance of microns, with the two channels effectively behaving as a\nsingle channel. Moreover, the inter-channel equilibration is accompanied by an\nexcitation of upstream neutral modes. In turn, the counter-propagating neutral\nmodes, moving in close proximity to the charge modes, fragment into propagating\ncharges, inducing thus downstream current fluctuations with zero net current -\na novel mechanism for non-equilibrium noise. This unexpected edge\nreconstruction underlines the need for better understanding of edge\nreconstruction and energy transport in all fractional QHE states.\n", "  Waves patterns in the Faraday instability have been studied for decades.\nBesides the rich dynamics that can be observed on the waves at the interface,\nFaraday waves hide beneath them an elusive range of flow patterns --or\nstreaming patterns-- which have not been studied in detail until now. The\nstreaming patterns are responsible for a net circulation in the flow which are\nreminiscent of convection cells. In this article, we analyse these streaming\nflows by conducting experiments in a Faraday-wave setup. To visualize the\nflows, tracers are used to generate both trajectory maps and to probe the\nstreaming velocity field via Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). We identify\nthree types of patterns and experimentally show that identical Faraday waves\ncan mask streaming patterns that are qualitatively very different. Next we\npropose a three-dimensional model that explains streaming flows in\nquasi-inviscid fluids. We show that the streaming inside the fluid arises from\na complex coupling between the bulk and the boundary layers. This coupling can\nbe taken into account by applying modified boundary conditions in a\nthree-dimensional Navier-Stokes formulation for the streaming in the bulk.\nNumerical simulations based on this theoretical framework show good qualitative\nand quantitative agreement with experimental results. They also highlight the\nrelevance of three-dimensional effects in the streaming patterns. Our\nsimulations reveal that the variety of experimental patterns is deeply linked\nto the boundary condition at the top interface, which may be strongly affected\nby the presence of contaminants along the surface.\n", "  Starting from the linearized BdG-equation we make the simple observation that\npairing can occur between particles with total momenta different from zero,\ne.g., with equal momentum and opposite spin, in cases of an effective\ninteraction acting in the center-of-mass coordinates.\n", "  Recently it has been shown that the control energy required to control a\ndynamical complex network is prohibitively large when there are only a few\ncontrol inputs. Most methods to reduce the control energy have focused on\nwhere, in the network, to place additional control inputs. Here, in contrast,\nwe show that by controlling the states of a subset of the nodes of a network,\nrather than the state of every node, while holding the number of control\nsignals constant, the required energy to control a portion of the network can\nbe reduced substantially. The energy requirements exponentially decay with the\nnumber of target nodes, suggesting that large networks can be controlled by a\nrelatively small number of inputs as long as the target set is appropriately\nsized. We validate our conclusions in model and real networks to arrive at an\nenergy scaling law to better design control objectives regardless of system\nsize, energy restrictions, state restrictions, input node choices and target\nnode choices.\n", "  Ordered magnetic charge created by Dirac multipoles that are magnetic and\npolar is examined. It has previously been revealed in the pseudo-gap phase of\nhigh-Tc materials by use of the Kerr effect and magnetic neutron Bragg\ndiffraction. There are several forms of the polar operator for magnetic neutron\nscattering built from spin and electric dipole operators of unpaired electrons.\nConstruction of Dirac quadrupoles that emerge from centrosymmetric sites used\nby Cu ions in the ceramic superconductor Hg1201 is illustrated, together with\nselection rules for excitations that will feature in neutron inelastic\nscattering, and RIXS experiments. Most reported expressions and results have\nuniversal value, because they are not specific to ceramic superconductors. To\nillustrate this aspect of our work we simulate neutron diffraction from a\nmagnetically ordered iridate (Sr2IrO4).\n", "  We explain some details of the construction of composite operators in N=4 SYM\nthat we have elaborated earlier in the context of Lorentz harmonic chiral (LHC)\nsuperspace. We give a step-by-step elementary derivation and show that the\nresult coincides with the recent hypothesis put forward in arXiv:1603.04471\nwithin the twistor approach. We provide the appropriate LHC-to-twistors\ndictionary.\n", "  We discuss $\\mathcal{N}=1$ Klein and Klein-Conformal superspaces in $D=(2,2)$\nspace-time dimensions, realizing them in terms of their functor of points over\nthe split composition algebra $\\mathbb{C}_{s}$. We exploit the observation that\ncertain split form of orthogonal groups can be realized in terms of matrix\ngroups over split composition algebras; this leads to a natural interpretation\nof the the sections of the spinor bundle in the critical split dimensions\n$D=4$, $6$ and $10$ as $\\mathbb{C}_{s}^{2}$, $\\mathbb{H}_{s}^{2}$ and\n$\\mathbb{O}_{s}^{2}$, respectively. Within this approach, we also analyze the\nnon-trivial spinor orbit stratification that is relevant in our construction\nsince it affects the Klein-Conformal superspace structure.\n", "  For generic values of q, all the eigenvectors of the transfer matrix of the\nU_q sl(2)-invariant open spin-1/2 XXZ chain with finite length N can be\nconstructed using the algebraic Bethe ansatz (ABA) formalism of Sklyanin.\nHowever, when q is a root of unity (q=exp(i pi/p) with integer p>1), the Bethe\nequations acquire continuous solutions, and the transfer matrix develops Jordan\ncells. Hence, there appear eigenvectors of two new types: eigenvectors\ncorresponding to continuous solutions (exact complete p-strings), and\ngeneralized eigenvectors. We propose general ABA constructions for these two\nnew types of eigenvectors. We present many explicit examples, and we construct\ncomplete sets of (generalized) eigenvectors for various values of p and N.\n", "  We address the problem of estimating the mass of a quantum particle in a\ngravitational field and seek the ultimate bounds to precision of\nquantum-limited detection schemes. In particular, we study the effect of the\nfield on the achievable sensitivity and address the question of whether\nquantumness of the probe state may provide a precision enhancement. The\nultimate bounds to precision are quantified in terms of the corresponding\nQuantum Fisher Information. Our results show that states with no classical\nlimit perform better than semiclassical ones and that a non-trivial interplay\nexists between the external field and the statistical model. More intense\nfields generally lead to a better precision, with the exception of position\nmeasurements in the case of freely-falling systems.\n", "  The study of liquid gas phase transition in fragmentation of nuclei in heavy\nion collisions has been extended to the strangeness sector using the\nstatistical model for multifragmentation. Helmholtz's free energy, specific\nheat and few other thermodynamic observables have been analyzed in order to\nexamine the occurence of phase transition in the strange matter. The bimodal\nbehaviour of the largest cluster formed in fragmentation also strongly\nindicates coexistence of both the phases. The presence of hyperons strengthens\nthe signals and also shifts the transition temperature to lower values.\n", "  It is widely appreciated that surface tension can dominate the behavior of\nliquids at small scales. Solids also have surface stresses of a similar\nmagnitude, but they are usually overlooked. However, recent work has shown that\nthese can play an central role in the mechanics of soft solids such as gels.\nHere, we review this emerging field. We outline the theory of surface stresses,\nfrom both mechanical and thermodynamic perspectives, emphasizing the\nrelationship between surface stress and surface energy. We describe a wide\nrange of phenomena at interfaces and contact lines where surface stresses play\nan important role. We highlight how surface stresses causes dramatic departures\nfrom classic theories for wetting (Young-Dupr\\'{e}), adhesion\n(Johnson-Kendall-Roberts), and composites (Eshelby). A common thread is the\nimportance of the ratio of surface stress to an elastic modulus, which defines\na length scale below which surface stresses can dominate.\n", "  This work presents the basic characteristics of singly, doubly and heavily\ncharged projectile fragments (PFs) emitted in inelastic interactions of 32S\nions with photo-emulsion nuclei at Dubna energy (3.7A GeV). Our experimental\ndata are compared with the corresponding data for other projectiles at the same\nincident energy. The study of mean multiplicities of different charged PFs\nagainst the projectile mass shows a power-law relationship. The multiplicity\ndistributions of singly and doubly charged PFs have been fitted well with a\nGaussian distribution function. The yields of PFs broken up from the\ninteractions of 32S projectile nuclei with different target nuclei are studied.\nThe beam energy dependence in terms of the various order moments is studied as\nwell.\n", "  Using Hodge diagram combinatorial data, we study qubit and fermionic Fock\nspaces from the point of view of type II superstring black holes based on\ncomplex compactifications. Concretely, we establish a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween qubits, fermionic spaces and extremal black holes in maximally\nsupersymmetric supergravity obtained from type II superstring on complex\ntoroidal and Calabi-Yau compactifications. We interpret the differential forms\nof the n-dimensional complex toroidal compactification as states of n-qubits\nencoding information on extremal black hole charges. We show that there are 2^n\ncopies of n-qubit systems which can be split as 2^n=2^{n-1}+2^{n-1}. More\nprecisely, 2^{n-1} copies are associated with even D-brane charges in type IIA\nsuperstring and the other 2^{n-1} ones correspond to odd D-brane charges in IIB\nsuperstring. This correspondence is generalized to a class of Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds. In connection with black hole charges in type IIA superstring, an\nn-qubit system has been obtained from a canonical line bundle of n factors of\none dimensional projective space \\mathbb{CP}^1.\n", "  We show that bi-flat $F$-manifolds can be interpreted as natural geometrical\nstructures encoding the almost duality for Frobenius manifolds without metric.\nUsing this framework, we extend Dubrovin's duality between orbit spaces of\nCoxeter groups and Veselov's $\\vee$-systems, to the orbit spaces of exceptional\nwell-generated complex reflection groups of rank $2$ and $3$. On the Veselov's\n$\\vee$-systems side, we provide a generalization of the notion of\n$\\vee$-systems that gives rise to a dual connection which coincides with a\nDunkl-Kohno-type connection associated with such groups. In particular, this\nallows us to treat on the same ground several different examples including\nCoxeter and Shephard groups. Remarkably, as a byproduct of our results, we\nprove that in some examples basic flat invariants are not uniquely defined. As\nfar as we know, such a phenomenon has never been pointed out before.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate cosmological consequences of a scenario for\nrecently reported accelerated expansion of the Universe, in which the\ngeneralized Chaplygin gas (GCG) along with the baryonic matter are responsible\nfor this observed phenomenon. In the present model, we employ an isotropic and\nhomogeneous FLRW space time in the framework of $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity. In\n$f(R,T)$ gravity, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor (EMT) leads to a\nconstraint equation which enforces us to use some specific forms of type\n$f(R,T)=g(R)+h(T)$. In this work we choose $g(R)=R$. We consider three classes\nof Chaplygin gas models which include three different forms of $f(R,T)$\nfunction; those models which employ the standard Chaplygin gas (SCG), models\nwhich use GCG in the high pressure regimes and finally, the third case is\ndevoted to investigating high density regimes in the presence of GCG.\n", "  We establish a precise relation between mixed boundary conditions for scalar\nfields in asymptotically anti de Sitter spacetimes and the equation of state of\nthe dual fluid. We provide a detailed derivation of the relation in the case of\nfive bulk-dimensions for scalar fields saturating the Breitenlohner-Freedman\nbound. As a concrete example, we discuss the five dimensional scalar-tensor\ntheories describing a constant speed of sound.\n", "  Massive molecular outflows erupting from high-mass young stellar objects\nprovide important clues to understanding the mechanism of high-mass star\nformation. Based on new CO J=3-2 and J=1-0 observations using the Atacama\nSubmillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) and Mopra telescope facilities, we\ndiscovered a massive bipolar outflow associated with the dense dust core\nAGALG337.916-00.477 (AGAL337.9-S), located 3.48 kpc from the Sun. The outflow\nlobes have extensions of less than 1 pc -and thus were not fully resolved in\nthe angular resolutions of ASTE and Mopra- and masses of 35-40 M_sun. The\nmaximum velocities of the outflow lobes are as high as 35-40 km/s. Our analysis\nof the infrared and sub-mm data indicates that AGAL337.9-S is in an early\nevolutionary stage of the high-mass star formation, having the total\nfar-infrared luminosity of ~5x10^4 L_sun. We also found that another dust core\nAGALG337.922-00.456 (AGAL337.9-N) located 2' north of AGAL337.9-S is a\nhigh-mass young stellar object in an earlier evolutional stage than\nAGAL337.9-S, although it is less bright in the mid-infrared than AGAL337.9-S.\n", "  The implementation of maximally restrictive texture zeros in the leptonic\nsector is investigated in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models with Majorana\nneutrinos. After analyzing all maximally restrictive pairs of leptonic mass\nmatrices with zero entries, we conclude that there are only four texture\ncombinations that are compatible with observations at 3 sigma confidence level\nand can be implemented through Abelian symmetries in a two-Higgs-doublet model.\nThe compatibility of these textures with current constraints on\nlepton-flavor-violating processes is also studied. The ultraviolet completion\nof these models is discussed in the framework of the seesaw mechanism for\nneutrino masses.\n", "  The extended Gutzwiller trajectory approach is presented for the\nsemiclassical description of nuclear collective dynamics, in line with the main\ntopics of the fruitful activity of V.G. Solovjov. Within the Fermi-liquid\ndroplet model, the leptodermous effective surface approximation was applied to\ncalculations of energies, sum rules and transition densities for the\nneutron-proton asymmetry of the isovector giant-dipole resonance and found to\nbe in good agreement with the experimental data. By using the Strutinsky shell\ncorrection method, the semiclassical collective transport coefficients such as\nnuclear inertia, friction, stiffness, and moments of inertia can be derived\nbeyond the quantum perturbation approximation of the response function theory\nand the cranking model.The averaged particle-number dependence of the low-lying\ncollective vibrational states are described in good agreement with basic\nexperimental data, mainly due to an enhancement of the collective inertia as\ncompared to its irrotational flow value. Shell components of the moment of\ninertia are derived in terms of the periodic-orbit free-energy shell\ncorrections. A good agreement between the semiclassical extended Thomas-Fermi\nmoments of inertia with shell corrections and the quantum results is obtained\nfor different nuclear deformations and particle numbers. Shell effects are\nshown to be exponentially dampted out with increasing temperature in all the\ntransport coefficients.\n", "  We calculate the yield of lepton pair production from jet-plasma interaction\nwhere the plasma is anisotropic in momentum space. We compare both the $M$ and\n$p_T$ distributions from such process with the Drell-Yan contribution. It is\nobserved that the invariant mass distribution of lepton pair from such process\ndominate over the Drell-Yan up to $3$ GeV at RHIC and up to $10$ GeV at LHC.\nMoreover, it is found that the contribution from anistropic quark gluon plasma\n(AQGP) increases marginally compared to the isotropic QGP. In case of\n$p_T$-distribution we observe an increase by a factor of $3-4$ in the entire\n$p_T$-range at RHIC for AQGP. However, at LHC the change in the\n$p_T$-distribution is marginal as compared to the isotropic case.\n", "  We develop a model of relativistic, charged meson-exchange currents (MEC) for\nneutrino-nucleus interactions. The two-body current is the sum of seagull,\npion-in-flight, pion-pole and $\\Delta$-pole operators. These operators are\nobtained from the weak pion-production amplitudes for the nucleon derived in\nthe non-linear $\\sigma$-model together with weak excitation of the\n$\\Delta(1232)$ resonance and its subsequent decay into $N\\pi$. With these\ncurrents we compute the five 2p-2h response functions contributing to\n$(\\nu_l,l^-)$ and $(\\overline{\\nu}_l,l^+)$ reactions in the relativistic Fermi\ngas model. The total current is the sum of vector and axial two-body currents.\nThe vector current is related to the electromagnetic MEC operator that\ncontributes to electron scattering. This allows one to check our model by\ncomparison with the results of De Pace {\\em et al.,} Nuclear Physics A 726\n(2003) 303. Thus our model is a natural extension of that model to the weak\nsector with the addition of the axial MEC operator. The dependences of the\nresponse functions on several ingredients of the approach are analyzed.\nSpecifically we discuss relativistic effects, quantify the size of the\ndirect-exchange interferences, and the relative importance of the axial versus\nvector current.\n", "  A combined theoretical and experimental study reveals evidence for the dual\ntopological insulating character of the stoichiometric natural superlattice\nphase $\\mathrm{Bi_{1}Te_{1}}=\\mathrm{[Bi_{2}]_{1}[Bi_{2}Te_{3}]_{2}}$, being a\nstack of alternating Bi bilayers and two quintuple layers of\n$\\mathrm{Bi_{2}Te_{3}}$. We identify $\\mathrm{Bi_{1}Te_{1}}$ by density\nfunctional theory to exhibit a non trivial time-reversal symmetry-driven\ncharacter of $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}=(0;001)$ and additionally a mirror-symmetry\ninduced mirror Chern number of $n_{{\\cal M}}=-2$, which indicates that\n$\\mathrm{Bi_{1}Te_{1}}$ is both a weak topological insulator and a topological\ncrystalline insulator. The coexistence of the two phenomena preordains distinct\ncrystal planes to host topological surface states that are protected by the\nrespective symmetries. The surface perpendicular to the stacking direction is\nthe 'dark' surface of the weak topological insulator, while hosting\nmirror-symmetry protected surface states along the $\\bar{\\Gamma\\mathrm{M}}$\ndirection at non-time-reversal invariant momenta points. We confirm the\nstacking sequence of our MBE-grown $\\mathrm{Bi_{1}Te_{1}}$ thin films by X-ray\ndiffraction and transmission electron microscopy, and find indications of the\ntopological crystalline and weak topological character in the surface\nelectronic spin structure by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, which nicely match the results from density functional theory.\n", "  We use topological data analysis to study \"functional networks\" that we\nconstruct from time-series data from both experimental and synthetic sources.\nWe use persistent homology with a weight rank clique filtration to gain\ninsights into these functional networks, and we use persistence landscapes to\ninterpret our results. Our first example uses time-series output from networks\nof coupled Kuramoto oscillators. Our second example consists of biological data\nin the form of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that was\nacquired from human subjects during a simple motor-learning task in which\nsubjects were monitored on three days in a five-day period. With these\nexamples, we demonstrate that (1) using persistent homology to study functional\nnetworks provides fascinating insights into their properties and (2) the\nposition of the features in a filtration can sometimes play a more vital role\nthan persistence in the interpretation of topological features, even though\nconventionally the latter is used to distinguish between signal and noise. We\nfind that persistent homology can detect differences in synchronization\npatterns in our data sets over time, giving insight both on changes in\ncommunity structure in the networks and on increased synchronization between\nbrain regions that form loops in a functional network during motor learning.\nFor the motor-learning data, persistence landscapes also reveal that on average\nthe majority of changes in the network loops take place on the second of the\nthree days of the learning process.\n", "  A detailed electrical characterization of high-performance bow-tie InGaAs\nbased terahertz detectors is presented along with simulation results. The local\nsurface potential and tunnelling current were scanned over the surfaces of the\ndetectors by means of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and scanning\ntunnelling microscopy (STM), which also enabled the determination of the Fermi\nlevel. Currentvoltage curves were measured and modelled using the Synopsys\nSentaurus TCAD package to gain deeper insight into the processes involved in\ndetector operation. In addition, we performed finite difference time-domain\n(FDTD) simulations to reveal features related to changes in the electric field\ndue to the metal detector contacts. The investigation revealed that field\neffect-induced conductivity modulation is a possible mechanism contributing to\nthe high sensitivity of the studied detectors.\n", "  The Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) boundary term makes the Dirichlet problem for\ngravity well defined, but no such general term seems to be known for Neumann\nboundary conditions. In this paper, we view Neumann {\\em not} as fixing the\nnormal derivative of the metric (\"velocity\") at the boundary, but as fixing the\nfunctional derivative of the action with respect to the boundary metric\n(\"momentum\"). This leads directly to a new boundary term for gravity: the trace\nof the extrinsic curvature with a specific dimension-dependent coefficient. In\nthree dimensions this boundary term reduces to a \"one-half\" GHY term noted in\nthe literature previously, and we observe that our action translates precisely\nto the Chern-Simons action with no extra boundary terms. In four dimensions the\nboundary term vanishes, giving a natural Neumann interpretation to the standard\nEinstein-Hilbert action without boundary terms. We argue that in light of\nAdS/CFT, ours is a natural approach for defining a \"microcanonical\" path\nintegral for gravity in the spirit of the (pre-AdS/CFT) work of Brown and York.\n", "  It is possible to describe fermionic phases of matter and spin-topological\nfield theories in 2+1d in terms of bosonic \"shadow\" theories, which are\nobtained from the original theory by \"gauging fermionic parity\". The\nfermionic/spin theories are recovered from their shadow by a process of\nfermionic anyon condensation: gauging a one-form symmetry generated by\nquasi-particles with fermionic statistics. We apply the formalism to theories\nwhich admit gapped boundary conditions. We obtain Turaev-Viro-like and\nLevin-Wen-like constructions of fermionic phases of matter. We describe the\ngroup structure of fermionic SPT phases protected by the product of fermion\nparity and internal symmetry G. The quaternion group makes a surprise\nappearance.\n", "  Neural networks can be used to identify phases and phase transitions in\ncondensed matter systems via supervised machine learning. Readily programmable\nthrough modern software libraries, we show that a standard feed-forward neural\nnetwork can be trained to detect multiple types of order parameter directly\nfrom raw state configurations sampled with Monte Carlo. In addition, they can\ndetect highly non-trivial states such as Coulomb phases, and if modified to a\nconvolutional neural network, topological phases with no conventional order\nparameter. We show that this classification occurs within the neural network\nwithout knowledge of the Hamiltonian or even the general locality of\ninteractions. These results demonstrate the power of machine learning as a\nbasic research tool in the field of condensed matter and statistical physics.\n", "  The physical origins of the observed interannual variability of weather and\nclimate on Mars are poorly understood. In this paper we introduce a\ndeterministic physical mechanism that may account for much of the variability\nof the circulation of the Mars atmosphere on seasonal and longer timescales. We\nderive a coupling expression linking orbital and rotational motions that\nproduces an acceleration field varying with position and with time on and\nwithin a subject body. The spatially and temporally varying accelerations may\ninterfere constructively or destructively with large-scale flows of geophysical\nfluids that are established and maintained by other means. The hypothesis\npredicts cycles of intensification and relaxation of circulatory flows of\natmospheres on seasonal and longer timescales that are largely independent of\nsolar forcing. The predictions of the hypothesis may be tested through\nnumerical modeling. Examples from investigations of the atmospheric circulation\nof Mars are provided to illustrate qualitative features and quantitative\naspects of the mechanism proposed. We briefly discuss the implications and\napplicability of the orbit-spin coupling hypothesis for planets other than\nMars.\n", "  Within the C*-algebraic framework of the resolvent algebra for canonical\nquantum systems, the structure of oscillating lattice systems with bounded\nnearest neighbor interactions is studied in any number of dimensions. The\nglobal dynamics of such systems acts on the resolvent algebra by automorphisms\nand there exists a (in any regular representation) weakly dense subalgebra on\nwhich this action is pointwise norm continuous. Based on this observation,\nequilibrium (KMS) states as well as ground states are constructed which are\nshown to be regular. It is also indicated how to deal with singular\ninteractions and non-harmonic oscillations.\n", "  Motivated by the reopening mechanics of strongly collapsed airways, we study\nthe steady propagation of an air finger through a collapsed oil-filled channel\nwith a single compliant wall. In a previous study using fully-compliant elastic\ntubes, a `pointed' air finger was found to propagate at high speed and low\npressure, which may enable rapid reopening of highly collapsed airways with\nminimal tissue damage (Heap & Juel 2008). In this paper, we identify the\nselection mechanism of that pointed finger, which remained unexplained, by\nconducting an experimental study in a rigid rectangular Hele-Shaw channel with\nan elastic top boundary. The constitutive behaviour of this elasto-rigid\nchannel is broadly similar to that of an elastic tube, but unlike the tube the\nchannel's cross-section adopts self-similar shapes from the undeformed state to\nthe point of first near wall contact. The simplification of the vessel geometry\nenables the systematic investigation of the reopening dynamics in terms of\ninitial collapse. We find that for low levels of initial collapse, a single\ncentred symmetric finger propagates in the channel and its shape is set by the\ntip curvature. As the level of collapse increases, the channel cross-section\ndevelops a central region of near opposite wall contact, and the finger shape\nevolves smoothly towards a `flat-tipped' finger whose geometry is set by the\nstrong depth gradient near the channel walls. We show that the flat-tipped mode\nof reopening is analogous to the pointed finger observed in tubes. Its\npropagation is sustained by the vessel's extreme cross-sectional profile at\nhigh collapse, while vessel compliance stabilises it. A simple scaling argument\nbased on the dissipated power reveals that this reopening mode is preferred at\nhigher propagation speeds when it becomes favourable to displace the elastic\nchannel wall rather than the viscous fluid.\n", "  The Standard Model does not explain the hierarchy problem. Before the\ndiscovery of nonzero lepton mixing angle {\\theta}13 high hopes in explanation\nof the shape of the lepton mixing matrix were combined with non abelian\nsymmetries. Nowadays, assuming one Higgs doublet, it is unlikely that this is\nstill valid. Texture zeroes, that are combined with abelian symmetries, are\nintensively studied. The neutrino mass matrix is a natural way to study such\nsymmetries.\n", "  The theoretical description and the survey of physical properties of\nsuperconducting states in the uranium ferromagnetic materials are presented. On\nthe basis of microscopic theory is shown that the coupling between the\nelectrons in these ferromagnetic metals by means of magnetization fluctuations\ngives rise the triplet pairing superconducting state and the general form of\nthe order parameter dictated by the symmetry is established.\n  The theory allows to explain some specific observations including peculiar\nphenomenon of reentrant superconductivity in URhGe in magnetic field\nperpendicular to the direction of spontaneous magnetization.\n  In addition we describe several particular topics relating to uranium\nsuperconducting ferromagnets: (i) critical magnetic relaxation in dual\nlocalized-itinerant ferromagnets, (ii) phase transition to ferromagnetic state\nin Fermi liquid and UGe$_2$, (iii) superconducting ordering in ferromagnetic\nmetals without inversion symmetry.\n", "  Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ (SRO) is the prime candidate for chiral $p$-wave\nsuperconductor with critical temperature $T_{c}(SRO)\\sim$1.5 K. Chiral domains\nwith opposite chiralities $p_{x}\\pm ip_{y}$ were proposed, but yet to be\nconfirmed. We measure the field dependence of the point contact (PC) resistance\nbetween a tungsten tip and the SRO-Ru eutectic crystal, where micrometer-sized\nRu inclusions are embedded in SRO with atomic sharp interface. Ruthenium is an\n$s$-wave superconductor with $T_{c}(Ru)\\sim$0.5 K, flux pinned near the Ru\ninclusions can suppress its superconductivity as reflected from the PC\nresistance and spectra. This flux pinning effect is originated from SRO\n\\textit{underneath} the surface and is very strong. To fully remove it, one has\nto thermal cycle the sample above $T_{c}(SRO)$. This resembles the thermal\ndemagnetization for a ferromagnet, where ferromagnetic domains are randomized\nabove its Curie temperature. Another way is by applying alternating fields with\ndecreasing amplitude, resembling field demagnetization for the ferromagnet. The\nobserved hysteresis in magnetoresistance can be explained by domain dynamics,\nproviding support for the existence of chiral domains. The origin of strong\npinning \\textit{underneath} the surface is also discussed.\n", "  We perform a detailed analysis of next-to-leading order plus parton-shower\nmatching in vector-boson-fusion WW production including leptonic decays. The\nstudy is performed in the Herwig 7 framework interfaced to VBFNLO 3, using the\nangular-ordered and dipole-based parton-shower algorithms combined with the\nsubtractive and multiplicative matching algorithms.\n", "  Among the questions that would be raised by the observation of a new\nresonance at the LHC, particularly pressing are those concerning the production\nmechanism: What is the initial state? Is the resonance produced independently\nor in association with other particles? Here we present two weakly-coupled\nrenormalizable models for production of a diphoton resonance that differ in\nboth their initial and final states. In one model, a scalar particle produced\nthrough gluon fusion decays into a diphoton particle and a light, long-lived\npseudoscalar. In another model, a $Z'$ boson produced from the annihilation of\na strange-antistrange quark pair undergoes a cascade decay that leads to a\ndiphoton particle and two sterile neutrinos. Various kinematic distributions\nmay differentiate these models from the canonical model where a diphoton\nparticle is directly produced in gluon fusion.\n", "  We present the first direct ejecta velocity measurements of Tycho's supernova\nremnant (SNR). Chandra's high angular resolution images reveal a patchy\nstructure of radial velocities in the ejecta that can be separated into\ndistinct redshifted, blueshifted, and low velocity ejecta clumps or blobs. The\ntypical velocities of the redshifted and blueshifted blobs are <~ 7,800 km/s\nand <~ 5,000 km/s, respectively. The highest velocity blobs are located near\nthe center, while the low velocity ones appear near the edge as expected for a\ngenerally spherical expansion. Systematic uncertainty on the velocity\nmeasurements from gain calibration was assessed by carrying out joint fits of\nindividual blobs with both the ACIS-I and ACIS-S detectors. We determine the\nthree-dimensional kinematics of the Si- and Fe-rich clumps in the southeastern\nquadrant and show that these knots form a distinct, compact, and\nkinematically-connected structure, possibly even a chain of knots strung along\nthe remnant's edge. By examining the viewing geometries we conclude that the\nknots in the southeastern region are unlikely to be responsible for the high\nvelocity Ca II absorption features seen in the light echo spectrum of SN 1572,\nthe originating event for Tycho's SNR.\n", "  We consider a generalised version of Motzkin paths, where horizontal steps\nhave length $\\ell$, with $\\ell$ being a fixed positive integer. We first give\nthe general functional equation for the area-length generating function of this\nmodel. Using a heuristic ansatz, we derive the area-length scaling behaviour in\nterms of a scaling function in one variable for the special cases of Dyck,\n(standard) Motzkin and Schr\\\"oder paths, before generalising our approach to\narbitrary $\\ell$. We then derive an expression for the generating function of\nSchr\\\"oder paths and analyse the scaling behaviour of this function rigorously\nin the vicinity of the tri-critical point of the model by applying the method\nof steepest descents for the case of two coalescing saddle points. Our results\nshow that for Dyck and Schr\\\"oder paths, the heuristic scaling ansatz\nreproduces the rigorous results.\n", "  We study linear and nonlinear stability of asymptotically AdS$_4$ solutions\nin Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory. After summarizing the set of static\nsolutions we first examine thermodynamical stability in the grand canonical\nensemble and the phase transitions that occur among them. In the second part of\nthe paper we focus on nonlinear stability in the microcanonical ensemble by\nevolving radial perturbations numerically. We find hints of an instability\ncorner for vanishingly small perturbations of the same kind as the ones present\nin the uncharged case. Collapses are avoided, instead, if the charge and mass\nof the perturbations come to close the line of solitons. Finally we examine the\nsoliton solutions. The linear spectrum of normal modes is not resonant and\ninstability turns on at extrema of the mass curve. Linear stability extends to\nnonlinear stability up to some threshold for the amplitude of the perturbation.\nBeyond that, the soliton is destroyed and collapses to a hairy black hole. The\nrelative width of this stability band scales down with the charge Q, and does\nnot survive the blow up limit to a planar geometry.\n", "  Motivated by the direct observation of electronic phase separation in\nfirst-order Mott transitions, we model the interface between the\nthermodynamically coexisting metal and Mott insulator. We show how to model the\nrequired slab geometry and extract the electronic spectra. We construct an\neffective Landau free energy and compute the variation of its parameters across\nthe phase diagram. Finally, using a linear mixture of the density and\ndouble-occupancy, we identify a natural Ising order parameter which unifies the\ntreatment of the bandwidth and filling controlled Mott transitions.\n", "  The one-loop correction and two-loop contribution to black-body radiation\n(BBR) shift are restudied. The S-matrix approach and nonrelativistic quantum\nelectrodynamics (NRQED) are adopted in finite temperature case. The\nrelativistic correction to one-loop BBR-shift has a $(Z\\alpha)^{2}\\alpha\nT^2/m$-order contribution. In the two-loop case, the pure thermal (real) photon\npart is too tiny to be detected; while the corrections induced by the thermal\nand virtual mixing diagram are at $(Z\\alpha)^{2}\\alpha^2 T^2/m$ order. We\ncalculate the relativistic correction to one-loop BBR-shift in the ground state\nof hydrogen and ionized helium, which is larger than the leading term. As the\nleading term is proportional to $T^4/Z^4$. We estimate these higher-order\ncorrections may be larger than the leading term, when the system is a highly\nionized (large $Z$) or a cold (small $T$) one.\n", "  This report was prepared in the context of the LPCC \"Electroweak Precision\nMeasurements at the LHC WG\" and summarizes the activity of a subgroup dedicated\nto the systematic comparison of public Monte Carlo codes, which describe the\nDrell-Yan processes at hadron colliders, in particular at the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). This work represents an important step towards the definition\nof an accurate simulation framework necessary for very high-precision\nmeasurements of electroweak (EW) observables such as the $W$ boson mass and the\nweak mixing angle. All the codes considered in this report share at least\nnext-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in the prediction of the total cross\nsections in an expansion either in the strong or in the EW coupling constant.\nThe NLO fixed-order predictions have been scrutinized at the technical level,\nusing exactly the same inputs, setup and perturbative accuracy, in order to\nquantify the level of agreement of different implementations of the same\ncalculation. A dedicated comparison, again at the technical level, of three\ncodes that reach next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) for the total cross section has also been performed. These\nfixed-order results are a well-defined reference that allows a classification\nof the impact of higher-order sets of radiative corrections. Several examples\nof higher-order effects due to the strong or the EW interaction are discussed\nin this common framework. Also the combination of QCD and EW corrections is\ndiscussed, together with the ambiguities that affect the final result, due to\nthe choice of a specific combination recipe.\n", "  Galaxy observations and N-body cosmological simulations produce conflicting\ndark matter halo density profiles for galaxy central regions. While simulations\nsuggest a cuspy and universal density profile (UDP) of this region, the\nmajority of observations favor variable profiles with a core in the center. In\nthis paper, we investigate the convergency of standard N-body simulations,\nespecially in the cusp region, following the approach proposed by\n\\protect{\\citep{13}}. We simulate the well known Hernquist model using the SPH\ncode Gadget-3 and consider the full array of dynamical parameters of the\nparticles. We find that, although the cuspy profile is stable, all integrals of\nmotion characterizing individual particles suffer strong unphysical variations\nalong the whole halo, revealing an effective interaction between the test\nbodies. This result casts doubts on the reliability of the velocity\ndistribution function obtained in the simulations. Moreover, we find unphysical\nFokker-Planck streams of particles in the cusp region. The same streams should\nappear in cosmological N-body simulations, being strong enough to change the\nshape of the cusp or even to create it. Our analysis, based on the Hernquist\nmodel and the standard SPH code, strongly suggests that the UDPs generally\nfound by the cosmological N-body simulations may be a consequence of numerical\neffects. A much better understanding of the N-body simulation convergency is\nnecessary before a 'core-cusp problem' can properly be used to question the\nvalidity of the CDM model.\n", "  The polarization of the secondary protons in inelastic (p,p') reaction on the\n40Ca and 12C nuclei at the initial proton energy 1 GeV was measured in the wide\nrange of the scattered proton momenta at a laboratory angle 21 degree. The\ncross section of the reactions were measured as well. The outgoing protons from\nthe reaction were detected using a magnetic spectrometer equipped with a\nmultiwire-proportional chambers polarimeter. A structure in the polarization\nand cross section data, related probably to scattering of the nucleon\ncorrelation in the nuclei, was observed.\n", "  We present a mathematical framework for describing the topology of\nconfiguration spaces for particles on one-connected graphs. In particular, we\ncompute the homology groups over integers for different classes of\none-connected graphs. Our approach is based on some fundamental combinatorial\nproperties of the configuration spaces, Mayer-Vietoris sequences for different\nparts of configuration spaces and some limited use of discrete Morse theory. As\none of the results, we derive a closed-form formulae for ranks of the homology\ngroups for indistinguishable particles on tree graphs. We also give a detailed\ndiscussion of the second homology group of the configuration space of both\ndistinguishable and indistinguishable particles. Our motivation is the search\nfor new kinds of quantum statistics.\n", "  Interlayer misorientation in transition metal dichalcogenides alters the\ninterlayer distance, the electronic band structure, and the vibrational modes,\nbut, its effect on the interlayer resistance is not known. This work analyzes\nthe coherent interlayer resistance of misoriented 2H-MoS2 for low energy\nelectrons and holes as a function of the misorientation angle. The electronic\ninterlayer resistance monotonically increases with the supercell lattice\nconstant by several orders of magnitude similar to that of misoriented bilayer\ngraphene. The large hole coupling gives low interlayer hole resistance that\nweakly depends on the misorientation angle. Interlayer rotation between an\nn-type region and a p-type region will suppress the electron current with\nlittle effect on the hole current. We estimate numerical bounds and explain the\nresults in terms of the orbital composition of the bands at high symmetry\npoints. Density functional theory calculations provide the interlayer coupling\nused in both a tunneling Hamiltonian and a non-equilibrium Green function\ncalculation of the resistivity.\n", "  Quantum and thermal fluctuations of electromagnetic waves are the cornerstone\nof quantum and statistical physics, and inherent to such phenomena as thermal\nradiation and van der Waals forces. While the basic principles are the material\nof elementary texts, recent experimental and technological advances have made\nit necessary to come to terms with counterintuitive consequences of\nelectromagnetic fluctuations at short scales -- in the so called {\\it\nnear-field} regime. We focus on three manifestations of such behavior: {\\bf\n(i)} The Stefan--Boltzmann law describes thermal radiation from macroscopic\nbodies, but fails to account for magnitude, polarization and coherence of\nradiation from small objects (say compared to the skin depth). {\\bf (ii)} The\nheat transfer between two bodies at similar close proximity is dominated by\nevanescent waves, and can be several orders of magnitude larger than the\nclassical contribution due to propagating waves. {\\bf (iii)} Casimir/van der\nWaals interactions are a dominant force between objects at sub-micron\nseparation; the non-equilibrium analogs of this force (for objects at different\ntemperatures) have not been sufficiently explored (at least experimentally). To\nexplore these phenomena we introduce the tool of fluctuational quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) originally introduced by Rytov in the 1950s. Combined\nwith a scattering formalism, this enables studies of heat radiation and\ntransfer, equilibrium and non-equilibrium forces for objects of different\nmaterial properties, shapes, separations and arrangements.\n", "  We present a slave-particle mean-field study of the mixed boson+fermion\nquantum dimer model introduced by Punk, Allais, and Sachdev [PNAS 112, 9552\n(2015)] to describe the physics of the pseudogap phase in cuprate\nsuperconductors. Our analysis naturally leads to four charge e fermion pockets\nwhose total area is equal to the hole doping p, for a range of parameters\nconsistent with the t-J model for high temperature superconductivity. Here we\nfind that the dimers are unstable to d-wave superconductivity at low\ntemperatures. The region of the phase diagram with d-wave rather than s-wave\nsuperconductivity matches well with the appearance of the four fermion pockets.\nIn the superconducting regime, the dispersion contains eight Dirac cones along\nthe diagonals of the Brillouin zone.\n", "  We have investigated the electronic states of planar quantum dots at the ZnO\ninterface containing a few interacting electrons in an externally applied\nmagnetic field. In these systems, the electron-electron interaction effects are\nexpected to be much stronger than in traditional semiconductor quantum systems,\nsuch as in GaAs or InAs quantum dots. In order to highlight that stronger\nCoulomb effects in the ZnO quantum dots, we have compared the energy spectra\nand the magnetization in this system to those of the InAs quantum dots. We have\nfound that in the ZnO quantum dots, the signatures of stronger Coulomb\ninteraction manifests in an unique ground state that has very different\nproperties than the corresponding ones in the InAs dot. Our results for the\nmagnetization also exhibits behaviors never before observed in a quantum dot:\nWe have found a stronger temperature dependence and other unexpected features,\nsuch as paramagnetic-like behavior at high temperatures for a quantum-dot\nhelium.\n", "  For quantum systems of zero-range interaction we discuss the mathematical\nscheme within which modelling the two-body interaction by means of the\nphysically relevant ultra-violet asymptotics known as the\n\"Ter-Martirosyan-Skornyakov condition\" gives rise to a self-adjoint realisation\nof the corresponding Hamiltonian. This is done within the self-adjoint\nextension scheme of Krein, Visik, and Birman. We show that the\nTer-Martirosyan-Skornyakov asymptotics is a condition of self-adjointness only\nwhen is imposed in suitable functional spaces, and not just as a pointwise\nasymptotics, and we discuss the consequences of this fact on a model of two\nidentical fermions and a third particle of different nature.\n", "  The existing theory of incompatible elastic sheets uses the deviation of the\nsurface metric from a reference metric to define the strain tensor [Efrati et\nal., J. Mech. Phys. Solids {\\bf 57}, 762 (2009)]. For a class of simple\naxisymmetric problems we examine an alternative formulation, defining the\nstrain based on deviations of distances (rather than distances squared) from\ntheir rest values. While the two formulations converge in the limit of small\nslopes and in the limit of an incompressible sheet, for other cases they are\nfound not to be equivalent. The alternative formulation offers several features\nwhich are absent in the existing theory. (a) In the case of planar deformations\nof flat incompatible sheets, it yields linear, exactly solvable, equations of\nequilibrium. (b) When reduced to uniaxial (one-dimensional) deformations, it\ncoincides with the theory of extensible elastica; in particular, for a\nuniaxially bent sheet it yields an unstrained cylindrical configuration. (c) It\ngives a simple criterion determining whether an isometric immersion of an\nincompatible sheet is at mechanical equilibrium with respect to normal forces.\nFor a reference metric of constant positive Gaussian curvature, a spherical cap\nis found to satisfy this criterion except in an arbitrarily narrow boundary\nlayer.\n", "  In an attempt to demonstrate that local hidden variables are mathematically\npossible, Pitowsky constructed \"spin-$\\frac12$ functions\" and later\n\"Kolmogorovian models\", which employs a nonstandard notion of probability. We\ndescribe Pitowsky's analysis and argue (with the benefit of hindsight) that his\nnotion of hidden variables is in fact just super-determinism (and accordingly\nphysically not relevant). Pitowsky's first construction uses the Continuum\nHypothesis. Farah and Magidor took this as an indication that at some stage\nphysics might give arguments for or against adopting specific new axioms of set\ntheory. We would rather argue that it supports the opposing view, i.e., the\nwidespread intuition \"if you need a non-measurable function, it is physically\nirrelevant\".\n", "  We consider a Laughlin droplet in a confining potential which is very steep\nbut also weak compared to the ultra-short ranged inter-particle interactions.\nWe find that the eigenstates have a Jack polynomial structure, and have an\nenergy spectrum which is extremely different from the well-known Luttinger\nliquid edge.\n", "  There are two main projections used to transform, and reconstruct, field ion\nmicrographs or atom probe tomography data into atomic coordinates at the\nspecimen surface and, subsequently, in three-dimensions. In this article, we\npresent a perspective on the strength of the azimuthal equidistant projection\nin comparison to the more widely used and well-established point-projection(or\npseudo-stereographic projection), which underpins data reconstruction in most\nsoftware packages currently in use across the community. After an overview of\nthe reconstruction methodology, we demonstrate that the azimuthal equidistant\nis more robust with regards to errors on the parameters used to perform the\nreconstruction and is therefore more likely to yield more accurate tomographic\nreconstructions.\n", "  In this article, we present a systematic study of the critical behavior of\nphase oscillators with multiplicative noise from a thermodynamic equilibrium\napproach. We have already presented the thermodynamics of phase noise\noscillators and mapped out in detail the behavior of free energy, entropy, and\nspecific heat in a previous work [P. D. Pinto, F.A. Oliveira, A.L.A. Penna,\nPhys. Rev. E 93, 052220 (2016)], in which we also introduced the concept of\nsynchronization field. This proved to be important in order to understand the\neffect of multiplicative noise in the synchronization of the system. Using this\napproach, our aim is now to study analytically the critical behavior of this\nsystem from which we derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation as well as the\ncritical exponents associated with the order parameter, specific heat, and\nsusceptibility. We show that the exponents obey the Rushbrooke and Widom\nscaling laws.\n", "  We have numerically studied the effect of free-carrier-induced loss and\ndispersion on the modulational instability (MI) gain at low input powers in\nsilicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanowaveguides with normal and anomalous\nsecond-order dispersion. We have shown that the free carriers affect the gain\nspectra even at low input powers. First time we have reported the gain in\nnormal SOI nanowaveguides even in the absence of higher order dispersion\nparameters, which is due to the interaction of free-carrier-induced dispersion\nand nonlinearity. The MI gain in an anomalous SOI nanowaveguide vanishes even\nat a few milliwatt range of input power due to this interaction. We have shown\nthat the gain could be achieved in an anomalous nanowaveguides by reducing the\nfree carrier lifetime.\n", "  We propose a Gaussian ensemble as a description of the long-time dynamics of\nisolated quantum integrable systems. Our approach extends the Generalized Gibbs\nEnsemble (GGE) by incorporating fluctuations of integrals of motion. It is\nasymptotically exact in the classical limit irrespective of the system size\nand, under appropriate conditions, in the thermodynamic limit irrespective of\nthe value of Planck's constant. Moreover, it captures quantum corrections near\nthe classical limit, finite size corrections near the thermodynamic limit, and\nis valid in the presence of non-local interactions. The Gaussian ensemble\nbridges the gap between classical integrable systems, where a generalized\nmicrocanonical ensemble is exact even for few degrees of freedom and GGE, which\nrequires thermodynamic limit. We illustrate our results with examples of\nincreasing complexity.\n", "  We present a method for the evaluation of time-dependent linear response\nfunctions for systems of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles from unperturbed\nsimulations. The method is inspired by the Malliavin weights sampling method\nproposed by Warren and Allen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 250601 (2012)] for systems\nof Brownian particles. We illustrate our method by evaluating a linear response\nfunction for a single active particle in an external harmonic potential. As an\napplication, we calculate the time-dependent mobility function and an effective\ntemperature, defined through the Einstein relation between the self-diffusion\nand mobility coefficients, for a system of active particles interacting via a\nscreened-Coulomb potential. We find that this effective temperature decreases\nwith increasing persistence time of the self-propulsion. Initially, for not too\nlarge persistence times, it changes rather slowly, but then it decreases\nmarkedly when the persistence length of the self-propelled motion becomes\ncomparable with the particle size.\n", "  We present a joint theory-experiment study on the transmission/absorption\nsaturation after ultrafast pulse excitation in graphene. We reveal an\nunconventional double-bended saturation behavior: Both bendings separately\nfollow the standard saturation model exhibiting two saturation fluences,\nhowever, the corresponding fluences differ by three orders of magnitude and\nhave different physical origin. Our results reveal that this new and unexpected\nbehavior can be ascribed to an interplay between fluence- and time-dependent\nmany-particle scattering processes and phase-space filling effects.\n", "  The fully self-consistent GW approximation is an established method for\nelectronic structure calculations. Its most serious deficiency is known to be\nan incorrect prediction of the dielectric response. In this work we examine the\nGW approximation for the homogeneous electron gas and find that problems with\nthe dielectric response are solved by enforcing the particle-number\nconservation law in the polarization function. Previously reported data for the\nground-state energy were plainly contradicting each other well outside of\nreported error bounds. Some of these results created a false impression of how\naccurate the fully self-consistent GW approximation is. We resolve this\ncontroversy by confirming that only Ref. [15] was reporting correct energy\ndata, and present values for other key Fermi-liquid properties.\n", "  Possible classical solutions for electromagnetic monopoles induced by\ngravitational (global) monopoles in the presence of torsion are found. Such\nsolutions rely on a non-zero (Kalb-Ramond) torsion strength, which may\ncharacterise low energy theories inspired from string models. Bounds from the\ncurrent run of the LHC experiments are used to constrain the parameters of the\nmodel, but because the production mechanism depends on the details of the model\nand its ultraviolet completion, such bounds are presently only indicative.\n", "  Meso-scale turbulence is an innate phenomenon, distinct from inertial\nturbulence, that spontaneously occurs at zero-Reynolds number in fluidized\nbiological systems. This spatio-temporal disordered flow radically changes\nnutrient and molecular transport in living fluids and can strongly affect the\ncollective behaviour in prominent biological processes, including biofilm\nformation, morphogenesis and cancer invasion. Despite its crucial role in such\nphysiological processes, understanding meso-scale turbulence and any relation\nto classical inertial turbulence remains obscure. Here, we show how the motion\nof active matter along a micro-channel transitions to meso-scale turbulence\nthrough the evolution of disordered patches (active puffs) from an absorbing\nstate of flow vortex-lattices. We demonstrate that the critical behaviour of\nthis transition to meso-scale turbulence in a channel belongs to the directed\npercolation universality class. This finding bridges our understanding of the\nonset of zero-Reynolds number meso-scale turbulence and traditional\nscale-invariant turbulence, therefore generalizing theories on the onset of\nturbulence in confinement to the distinct classes of incoherent flows observed\nin biological fluids.\n", "  We propose and analyze a high-fidelity hot gate for generic spin-resonator\nsystems which allows for coherent spin-spin coupling, in the presence of a\nthermally populated resonator mode. Our scheme is non-perturbative, applies to\na broad class of physical systems, including for example spins coupled to\ncircuit-QED and surface acoustic wave resonators as well as nanomechanical\noscillators, and can be implemented readily with state-of-the-art experimental\nsetups. We provide and numerically verify simple expressions for the fidelity\nof creating maximally entangled states under realistic conditions.\n", "  We study anomalous dimensions of unprotected low twist operators in the\nfour-dimensional $SU(N)$ $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We\nconstruct a class of interpolating functions to approximate the dimensions of\nthe leading twist operators for arbitrary gauge coupling $\\tau$. The\ninterpolating functions are consistent with previous results on the\nperturbation theory, holographic computation and full S-duality. We use our\ninterpolating functions to test a recent conjecture by the $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nsuperconformal bootstrap that upper bounds on the dimensions are saturated at\none of the duality-invariant points $\\tau =i$ and $\\tau =e^{i\\pi /3}$. It turns\nout that our interpolating functions have maximum at $\\tau =e^{i\\pi /3}$, which\nare close to the conjectural values by the conformal bootstrap. In terms of the\ninterpolating functions, we draw the image of conformal manifold in the space\nof the dimensions. We find that the image is almost a line despite the\nconformal manifold is two-dimensional. We also construct interpolating\nfunctions for the subleading twist operator and study level crossing phenomenon\nbetween the leading and subleading twist operators. Finally we study the\ndimension of the Konishi operator in the planar limit. We find that our\ninterpolating functions match with numerical result obtained by Thermodynamic\nBethe Ansatz very well. It turns out that analytic properties of the\ninterpolating functions reflect an expectation on a radius of convergence of\nthe perturbation theory.\n", "  The emergence of a density bump at the front of a collisionless electrostatic\nshock wave have been observed experimentally during the ablation of an\naluminium foil by a femtosecond laser pulse. We have performed numerical\nsimulations of the dynamics of this phenomena developing alongside the\ngeneration of a package of ion-acoustic waves, exposed to a continual flow of\nenergetic electrons, in a collisionless plasma. We present the physical\ninterpretation of the observed effects and show that the bump consists of\ntransit particles, namely, the accelerated ions from the dense plasma layer,\nand the ions from the diluted background plasma, formed by a nanosecond laser\nprepulse during the ablation.\n", "  Originally an empirical law, nowadays Malus' law is seen as a key experiment\nto demonstrate the transverse nature of electromagnetic waves, as well as the\nintrinsic connection between optics and electromagnetism. In this work, a\nsimple and inexpensive setup is proposed to quantitatively verify the nature of\npolarized light. A flat computer screen serves as a source of linear polarized\nlight and a smartphone (possessing ambient light and orientation sensors) is\nused, thanks to its built-in sensors, to experiment with polarized light and\nverify the Malus' law.\n", "  We consider the orthogonal polynomials, $\\{P_n(z)\\}_{n=0,1,\\cdots}$, with\nrespect to the measure $$|z-a|^{2c} e^{-N|z|^2}dA(z)$$ supported over the whole\ncomplex plane, where $a>0$, $N>0$ and $c>-1$. We look at the scaling limit\nwhere $n$ and $N$ tend to infinity while keeping their ratio, $n/N$, fixed. The\nsupport of the limiting zero distribution is given in terms of certain\n\"limiting potential-theoretic skeleton\" of the unit disk. We show that, as we\nvary $c$, both the skeleton and the asymptotic distribution of the zeros behave\ndiscontinuously at $c=0$. The smooth interpolation of the discontinuity is\nobtained by the further scaling of $c=e^{-\\eta N}$ in terms of the parameter\n$\\eta\\in[0,\\infty).$\n", "  We perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction of IIB supergravity including purely\ngravitational $\\alpha '^3$-corrections on a Calabi-Yau threefold, and perform\nthe orientifold projection accounting for the presence of $O3/O7$-planes. We\nconsider infinitesimal K\\\"{a}hler deformations of the Calabi-Yau background and\nderive the complete set of four-derivative couplings quadratic in these\nfluctuations coupled to gravity. In particular, we find four-derivative\ncouplings of the K\\\"{a}hler moduli fields in the four-dimensional effective\nsupergravity theory, which are referred to as friction couplings in the context\nof inflation.\n", "  Black phosphorus is not stable when it is exposed to air. When covered or\nterminated by single layer carbon atoms, such as graphene carbon nanotube, it\nis more strongly protected in the rapid degradation than the bare black\nphosphorus. Moreover, due to weak interaction between phosphorus atoms in black\nphosphorene, the nanotube obtained by curling single layer black phosphorus is\nnot as stable as a carbon nanotube at finite temperature. In present work, we\nrecommend a new 1D material, i.e., composite double wall nanotubes from a black\nphosphorus nanotube with a CNT. The dynamic response of the composite DWNTs is\nsimulated using molecular dynamics approach. The effects of such factors as\ntemperature, slenderness and configurations of DWNTs are discussed. Comparing\nwith a single wall BPNT, the composite DWNTs under uniaxial compression shows\nsome peculiar properties. When the BPNT is embedded in a CNT, the system will\nnot collapse rapidly even if the BPNT has been damaged seriously.\n", "  Recently the $\\text{SU}(2)$ spin-network states in loop quantum gravity is\ngeneralized to those of the corresponding affine Lie algebra. We show that if\none literally starts from the full $\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ group, this\nprocedure naturally leads to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula of the entanglement\nentropy for any macroscopic spacetime region. This suggests that a smooth\nspacetime geometry could be recovered in such a way, as conjectured by Bianchi\nand Myers. Some comparison with Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net picture of gauge\ntheory is made.\n", "  We address the possibility of using even/odd states of orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) of photons for the quantum information tasks. Single photon\nqubit states and two photon entangled states in even/odd basis of OAM are\nconsidered. We present a method for the tomography and general projective\nmeasurement in even/odd basis. With the general projective measurement, we show\nthe Bell violation and quantum cryptography with Bell's inequality. We also\ndescribe hyper and hybrid entanglement of even/odd OAM states along with\npolarization, which can be applied in the implementation of quantum protocols\nlike super dense coding.\n", "  We propose an efficient method to protect spin squeezing under the action of\namplitude-damping, depolarizing and phase-damping channels based on measurement\nreversal from weak measurement, and consider an ensemble of N independent\nspin-1/2 particles with exchange symmetry. We find that spin squeezing can be\nenhanced greatly under three different decoherence channels and spin-squeezing\nsudden death (SSSD) can be avoided undergoing amplitude damping and\nphase-damping channels.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS collaborations observed a mild excess in the associated\nHiggs production with a top-quark pair ($t\\bar t h$) and reported the signal\nstrengths of $ \\mu_{tth}^{\\rm ATLAS}=1.81\\pm 0.80$ and $\\mu_{tth}^{\\rm\nCMS}=2.75\\pm 0.99 $ based on the data collected at $\\sqrt{s}$= 7 and 8 TeV.\nAlthough, at the current stage, there is no obvious indication whether the\nexcess is real or due to statistical fluctuations, here we perform a case study\nof this mild excess by exploiting the strong entanglement between the\nassociated Higgs production with a single top quark ($thX$) and $t\\bar t h$\nproduction in the presence of anomalous top-Yukawa coupling. As well known,\n$t\\bar t h$ production only depends on the absolute value of the top-Yukawa\ncoupling. Meanwhile, in $thX$ production, this degeneracy is lifted through the\nstrong interference between the two main contributions which are proportional\nto the top-Yukawa and the gauge-Higgs couplings, respectively. Especially, when\nthe relative sign of the top-Yukawa coupling with respect to the gauge-Higgs\ncoupling is reversed, the $thX$ cross section can be enhanced by more than one\norder of magnitude. We perform a detailed study of the influence of $thX$\nproduction on $t\\bar{t}h $ production in the presence of the anomalous\ntop-Yukawa coupling and point out that it is crucial to include $thX$\nproduction in the analysis of the $t\\bar t h$ data to pin down the sign and the\nsize of the top-Yukawa coupling in future. While assuming the Standard Model\n(SM) value for the gauge-Higgs coupling, we vary the top-Yukawa coupling within\nthe range allowed by the current LHC Higgs data. We consider the Higgs decay\nmodes into multileptons, $b\\bar b$ and $\\gamma\\gamma$ putting a particular\nemphasis on the same sign dilepton events. We also discuss ...\n", "  We propose a time-dependent partial differential equation model to\ninvestigate the dynamical behavior of the parity-time (PT) symmetric laser\nduring the nonlinear stage of its operation. This model incorporates physical\neffects such as the refractive index distribution, dispersion, material loss,\nnonlinear gain saturation and self-phase modulation. We show that when the loss\nis weak, multiple stable steady states and time-periodic states of light exist\nabove the lasing threshold, rendering the laser multi-mode. However, when the\nloss is strong, only a single stable steady state of broken PT symmetry exists\nfor a wide range of the gain amplitude, rendering the laser single-mode. These\nresults reveal the important role the loss plays in maintaining the single-mode\noperation of PT lasers.\n", "  We prove a few novel state-dependent uncertainty relations for product as\nwell the sum of variances of two incompatible observables. These uncertainty\nrelations are shown to be tighter than the Roberson-Schr\\\"odinger uncertainty\nrelation and other ones existing in the current literature. Also, we derive\nstate dependent upper bound to the sum and the product of variances using the\nreverse Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the Dunkl-Williams inequality. Our\nresults suggest that not only we cannot prepare quantum states for which two\nincompatible observables can have sharp values, but also we have both, lower\nand upper limits on the variances of quantum mechanical observables at a\nfundamental level.\n", "  We use the conformal bootstrap approach to explore $5D$ CFTs with $O(N)$\nglobal symmetry, which contain $N$ scalars $\\phi_i$ transforming as $O(N)$\nvector. Specifically, we study multiple four-point correlators of the leading\n$O(N)$ vector $\\phi_i$ and the $O(N)$ singlet $\\sigma$. The crossing symmetry\nof the four-point functions and the unitarity condition provide nontrivial\nconstraints on the scaling dimensions ($\\Delta_\\phi$, $\\Delta_\\sigma$) of\n$\\phi_i$ and $\\sigma$. With reasonable assumptions on the gaps between scaling\ndimensions of $\\phi_i$ ($\\sigma$) and the next $O(N)$ vector (singlet) scalar,\nwe are able to isolate the scaling dimensions $(\\Delta_\\phi$, $\\Delta_\\sigma)$\nin small islands. In particular, for large $N=500$, the isolated region is\nhighly consistent with the result obtained from large $N$ expansion.\n  We also study the interacting $O(N)$ CFTs for $1\\leqslant N\\leqslant100$.\nIsolated regions on $(\\Delta_\\phi,\\Delta_\\sigma)$ plane are obtained using\nconformal bootstrap program with lower order of derivatives $\\Lambda$; however,\nthey disappear after increasing $\\Lambda$. We think these islands are\ncorresponding to interacting but nonunitary $O(N)$ CFTs. Our results provide a\nlower bound on the critical value $N_c>100$, below which the interacting $O(N)$\nCFTs turn into nonunitary. The critical value is unexpectedly large comparing\nwith previous estimations.\n", "  Combining the power and possibilities of heterostructure engineering with the\ncollective and emergent properties of quantum materials, quantum-matter\nheterostructures open a new arena of solid-state physics. Here we provide a\nreview of interfaces and heterostructures made of quantum matter. Unique\nelectronic states can be engineered in these structures, giving rise to\nunforeseeable opportunities for scientific discovery and potential\napplications. We discuss the present status of this nascent field of\nquantum-matter heterostructures, its limitations, perspectives, and challenges.\n", "  Classicalization is a phenomenon in which a theory prevents itself from\nentering into a strong-coupling regime, by redistributing the energy among many\nweakly-interacting soft quanta. In this way, the scattering process of some\ninitial hard quanta splits into a large number of soft elementary processes. In\nshort, the theory trades the strong coupling for a high-multiplicity of quanta.\nAt very high energies, the outcome of such a scattering experiment is a\nproduction of soft states of high occupation number that are approximately\nclassical. It is evident that black hole creation in particle collision at\nsuper-Planckian energies is a result of classicalization, but there is no a\npriory reason why this phenomenon must be limited to gravity. If the hierarchy\nproblem is solved by classicalization, the LHC has a chance of detecting a\ntower of new resonances. The lowest-lying resonances must appear right at the\nstrong coupling scale in form of short-lived elementary particles. The heavier\nmembers of the tower must behave more and more classically: they must be longer\nlived and decay into higher numbers of soft quanta.\n", "  The interplay of superconductivity, magnetic fields, and spin-orbit\ninteraction lies at the heart of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, the\nrecent experimental discovery of $\\varphi_{0}$ Josephson junctions by Szombati\net al., Nat. Phys. 12, 568 (2016), characterized by a finite phase offset in\nthe supercurrent, require the same ingredients as topological superconductors,\nwhich suggests a profound connection between these two distinct phenomena.\nHere, we theoretically show that a quantum dot $\\varphi_{0}$ Josephson junction\ncan serve as a new qualitative indicator for topological superconductivity:\nMicroscopically, we find that the phase shift in a junction of $s-$wave\nsuperconductors is due to the spin-orbit induced mixing of singly occupied\nstates on the qantum dot, while for a topological superconductor junction it is\ndue to singlet-triplet mixing. Because of this important difference, when the\nspin-orbit vector of the quantum dot and the external Zeeman field are\northogonal, the $s$-wave superconductors form a $\\pi$ Josephson junction while\nthe topological superconductors have a finite offset $\\varphi_{0}$ by which\ntopological superconductivity can be distinguished from conventional\nsuperconductivity. Our prediction can be immediately tested in nanowire systems\ncurrently used for Majorana fermion experiments and thus offers a new and\nrealistic approach for detecting topological bound states.\n", "  Chern insulator is a building block of many topological quantum matters,\nranging from quantum spin Hall insulators to fractional Chern insulators. Here,\nwe discuss a new type of insulator, which consists of two half filled ordinary\nChern insulators. On the one hand, the bulk energy spectrum is obtained from\nfolding that of either Chern insulator. Such folding gives rise to a nodal\nboundary of the Brillouin zone, at which the band crossing is protected by the\nsymmetries of the two-dimensional lattice that is invariant under combined\ntransformations in the spatial and the spin space. It also provides one a\nnatural platform to explore the non-abelian Berry curvature and the resultant\nquantum phenomena. On the other hand, these two underlying Chern insulators are\ndistinguished from each other by nonsymmorphic operators, which lead to\nintriguing properties absent in conventional Chern insulators. A new degree of\nfreedom, the parity of the nonsymmorphic symmetry, needs to be introduced for\ndescribing the topological pumping, if the edge respects the nonsymmorphic\nsymmetry.\n", "  We experimentally study a periodically driven many-body localized system\nrealized by interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasi-disordered optical\nlattice. By preparing the system in a far-from-equilibrium state and monitoring\nthe remains of an imprinted density pattern, we identify a localized phase at\nhigh drive frequencies and an ergodic phase at low ones. These two distinct\nphases are separated by a dynamical phase transition which depends on both the\ndrive frequency and the drive strength. Our observations are quantitatively\nsupported by numerical simulations and are directly connected to the change in\nthe statistical properties of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian.\n", "  Quantum communication is at the forefront of quantum technology, enabling the\ndevelopment of absolutely secure encryption, distributed quantum computing,\nteleportation and more. Whilst quantum communication has been experimentally\ndemonstrated at distances on the order of hundreds of kilometers, the\nestablishment of high-fidelity pairs shared over larger distances remains a\nformidable technical challenge due to attenuation. However, this may be\novercome with the use of quantum repeaters. Here we propose a method to\nconstruct a robust quantum repeater network using only existing technology. Our\nprotocol is able to perform all parts of the procedure in a way that is highly\ntolerant to photon loss and imperfections in detectors, and it achieves secure\nbit rates on the order of kilohertz over intercontinental distances.\n", "  In this letter a new method based on modified self-organizing maps is\npresented for the reconstruction of deep ocean current velocities from surface\ninformation provided by satellites. This method takes advantage of local\ncorrelations in the data-space to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed\ndeep velocities. Unlike previous attempts to reconstruct deep velocities from\nsurface data, our method makes no assumptions regarding the structure of the\nwater column, nor the underlying dynamics of the flow field. Using satellite\nobservations of surface velocity, sea-surface height and sea-surface\ntemperature, as well as observations of the deep current velocity from\nautonomous Argo floats to train the map, we are able to reconstruct realistic\nhigh--resolution velocity fields at a depth of 1000m. Validation reveals\nextremely promising results, with a speed root mean squared error of ~2.8cm/s,\na factor more than a factor of two smaller than competing methods, and\ndirection errors consistently smaller than 30 degrees. Finally, we discuss the\nmerits and shortcomings of this methodology and its possible future\napplications.\n", "  Photoproduction of $K^*$ vector mesons off nucleon is investigated within the\nRegge framework where the electromagnetic vertex of $\\gamma K^*K^*$ fully takes\ninto account the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of spin-1\n$K^*$ vector meson. The $t$-channel $K^*(892)$, $K(494)$ and $\\kappa(800)$\nmeson exchanges are considered for the analysis of the production mechanism.\nThe experimentally observed rapid decrease of the cross sections for the\n$\\gamma p \\to K^{*+} \\Lambda$ reaction beyond the resonance region is well\nreproduced by the dominance of the exchange of $K$-meson trajectory. The role\nof the scalar $\\kappa$-meson trajectory is found to be minor in both $\\gamma p$\nand $\\gamma n$ reactions. The cross sections for the $\\gamma n \\to K^{*0}\n\\Lambda$ reaction are predicted to be about twice those of the $\\gamma p \\to\nK^{*+}\\Lambda$ reaction. The role of the $K^*$ electromagnetic multipoles and\nthe proton anomalous magnetic moment is studied through the total and\ndifferential cross sections and spin/parity asymmetries. We suggest the\nmeasurement of the photon polarization asymmetry as a tool for identifying the\nrole of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the $K^*$ vector\nmeson.\n", "  In this paper a study on a fusion reactor core is presented in heavy ion\ninertial fusion (HIF), including the heavy ion beam (HIB) transport in a fusion\nreactor, a HIB interaction with a background gas, reactor cavity gas dynamics,\nthe reactor gas backflow to the beam lines, and a HIB fusion reactor design.\nThe HIB has remarkable preferable features to release the fusion energy in\ninertial fusion: in particle accelerators HIBs are generated with a high driver\nefficiency of ~30-40%, and the HIB ions deposit their energy inside of\nmaterials. Therefore, a requirement for the fusion target energy gain is\nrelatively low, that would be ~50 to operate a HIF fusion reactor with a\nstandard energy output of 1GW of electricity. In a fusion reactor the HIB\ncharge neutralization is needed for a ballistic HIB transport. Multiple\nmechanical shutters would be installed at each HIB port at the reactor wall to\nstop the blast waves and the chamber gas backflow, so that the accelerator\nfinal elements would be protected from the reactor gas contaminant. The\nessential fusion reactor components are discussed in this paper.\n", "  In inertial fusion, one of scientific issues is to reduce an implosion\nnon-uniformity of a spherical fuel target. The implosion non-uniformity is\ncaused by several factors, including the driver beam illumination\nnon-uniformity, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) growth, etc. In this\npaper we propose a new control method to reduce the implosion non-uniformity;\nthe oscillating implosion acceleration dg(t) is created by pulsating and\ndephasing heavy ion beams (HIBs) in heavy ion inertial fusion (HIF). The dg(t)\nwould reduce the RTI growth effectively. The original concept of the non-\nuniformity control in inertial fusion was proposed in (Kawata, et al., 1993).\nIn this paper it was found that the pulsating and dephasing HIBs illumination\nprovide successfully the controlled dg(t) and that dg(t) induced by the\npulsating HIBs reduces well the implosion non-uniformity. Consequently the\npulsating HIBs improve a pellet gain remarkably in HIF.\n", "  We investigate how the properties of dark energy affect the cosmological\nmeasurements of neutrino mass and extra relativistic degrees of freedom. We\nlimit ourselves to the most basic extensions of $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter\n(CDM) model, i.e. the $w$CDM model with one additional parameter $w$, and the\n$w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model with two additional parameters, $w_{0}$ and $w_{a}$. In\nthe cosmological fits, we employ the 2015 cosmic microwave background\ntemperature and polarization data from the Planck mission, in combination with\nlow-redshift measurements such as the baryon acoustic oscillations, Type Ia\nsupernovae and the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). Given effects of massive\nneutrinos on large-scale structure, we further include weak lensing, redshift\nspace distortion, Sunyaev--Zeldovich cluster counts and Planck lensing data. We\nshow that, though the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is still consistent with\nthe current data, a phantom dark energy ($w<-1$) or an early phantom dark\nenergy (i.e. quintom evolving from $w<-1$ to $w>-1$) is slightly more favoured\nby current observations, which leads to the fact that in both $w$CDM and\n$w_0w_a$CDM models we obtain a larger upper limit of $\\sum m_\\nu$. We also show\nthat in the three dark energy models, the constraints on $N_{\\rm eff}$ are in\ngood accordance with each other, all in favour of the standard value 3.046,\nwhich indicates that the dark energy parameters almost have no impact on\nconstraining $N_{\\rm eff}$. Therefore, we conclude that the dark energy\nparameters can exert a significant influence on the cosmological weighing of\nneutrinos, but almost cannot affect the constraint on dark radiation.\n", "  All-optical switching by domain wall motion has been observed in Co/Pd\nsuperlattices. Heat accumulation is part of the switching process for our\nexperimental conditions. Numerical calculations point to a connection between\ndomain wall motion and in-plane heat diffusion.\n", "  We propose a stochastic modification of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Newton equation\nwhich takes into account the effect of extrinsic spacetime fluctuations. We use\nthis equation to demonstrate gravitationally induced decoherence of two\ngaussian wave-packets, and obtain a decoherence criterion similar to those\nobtained in the earlier literature in the context of effects of gravity on the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\n", "  We generalize the diffusion-limited aggregation by issuing many\nrandomly-walking particles, which stick to a cluster at the discrete time unit\nproviding its growth. Using simple combinatorial arguments we determine\nprobabilities of different growth scenarios and prove that the most probable\nevolution is governed by the deterministic Laplacian growth equation. A\npotential-theoretical analysis of the growth probabilities reveals connections\nwith the tau-function of the integrable dispersionless limit of the\ntwo-dimensional Toda hierarchy, normal matrix ensembles, and the\ntwo-dimensional Dyson gas confined in a non-uniform magnetic field. We\nintroduce the time-dependent Hamiltonian, which generates transitions between\ndifferent classes of equivalence of closed curves, and prove the Hamiltonian\nstructure of the interface dynamics. Finally, we propose a relation between\nprobabilities of growth scenarios and the semi-classical limit of certain\ncorrelation functions of \"light\" exponential operators in the Liouville\nconformal field theory on a pseudosphere.\n", "  Invited talk given at Symposium \"Extreme Light Technologies, Science, and\nApplications\" (LPHYS'16, Yerevan, 11-15 July 2016). The old Ritus-Narozhny\nconjecture of possible breakdown of Intense Field QED perturbation theory for\nultrarelativistic particles passing transversely through a strong\nelectromagnetic field is reviewed with a special emphasis on its possible\nsignificance for near-future experiments.\n", "  We show that evolution of magnetic properties in FeS under pressure cannot be\nexplained only in terms of a spin state transition. While uniform compression\ndoes show substantial suppression of the local magnetic moment and increase of\nthe weights of configurations with low spin, analysis of the local spin-spin\ncorrelation function demonstrates increase of the spin itinerancy. This is\nrelated to a strong modification of the electronic structure under pressure: in\nthe high-pressure phase FeS is in the Fermi-liquid state, while decrease of the\npressure moves the system to an orbital-selective regime.\n", "  This research evidences the usefulness of open big data to map mobility\npatterns in a medium-sized city. Motivated by the novel analysis that big data\nallow worldwide and in large metropolitan areas, we developed a methodology\naiming to complement origin-destination surveys with \\`a la carte spatial\nboundaries and updated data at a minimum cost. This paper validates the use of\nTwitter data to map the impact of public spaces on the different parts of the\nmetropolitan area of Concepci\\'on, Chile. Results have been validated by local\nexperts and evidence the main mobility patterns towards spaces of social\ninteraction like malls, leisure areas, parks and so on. The map represents the\nmobility patterns from census districts to different categories of public\nspaces with schematic lines at the metropolitan scale and it is centred in the\ncity of Concepci\\'on (Chile) and its surroundings (~10 kilometres).\n", "  The electric manipulation of antiferromagnets has become an area of great\ninterest recently for zero-stray-field spintronic devices, and for their rich\nspin dynamics. Generally, the application of antiferromagnetic media for\ninformation memories and storage requires a heterostructure with a\nferromagnetic layer for readout through the exchange-bias field. In\nmagnetoelectric and multiferroic antiferromagnets, the exchange coupling exerts\nan additional impediment (energy barrier) to magnetization reversal by the\napplied magnetoelectric energy. We proposed and verified a method to overcome\nthis barrier. We controlled the energy required for switching the magnetic\ndomains in magnetoelectric \\cro films by compensating the exchange-coupling\nenergy from the ferromagnetic layer with the Zeeman energy of a small\nvolumetric spontaneous magnetization found for the sputtered \\cro films. Based\non a simplified phenomenological model of the field-cooling process, the\nmagnetic and electric fields required for switching could be tuned. As an\nexample, the switching of antiferromagnetic domains around a zero-threshold\nelectric field was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 2.6 kOe.\n", "  Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay is a phenomenon of fundamental interest in\nparticle physics. The decay rates of double beta decay transitions to the\nexcited states can provide input for Nuclear Transition Matrix Element\ncalculations for the relevant two neutrino double beta decay process. It can be\nuseful as supplementary information for the calculation of Nuclear Transition\nMatrix Element for the neutrinoless double beta decay process. In the present\nwork, double beta decay of $^{94}$Zr to the $2^{+}_{1}$ excited state of\n$^{94}$Mo at 871.1 keV is studied using a low background $\\sim$ 230 cm$^3$ HPGe\ndetector. No evidence of this decay was found with a 232 g.y exposure of\nnatural Zirconium. The lower half-life limit obtained for the double beta decay\nof $\\rm^{94}Zr$ to the $2^{+}_{1}$ excited state of $\\rm^{94}Mo$ is $T_{1/2}\n(0\\nu + 2\\nu)> 3.4 \\times 10^{19}$ y at 90% C.L., an improvement by a factor of\n$\\sim$ 4 over the existing experimental limit at 90\\% C.L. The sensitivity is\nestimated to be $T_{1/2} (0\\nu + 2\\nu) > 2.0\\times10^{19}$ y at 90% C.L. using\nthe Feldman-Cousins method.\n", "  We review the phenomenology of SUSY dark matter in various versions of MSSM,\nwith universal and nonuniversal gaugino masses at the GUT scale. We start with\nthe universal case (CMSSM), where the cosmologically compatible dark matter\nrelic density is achieved only over some narrow regions of parameter space,\ninvolving some fine-tuning. Moreover, most of these regions are seriously\nchallenged by the constraints from collider and direct dark matter detection\nexperiments. Then we consider some simple and predictive nonuniversal gaugino\nmass models, based on SU(5) GUT. Several of these models offer viable SUSY dark\nmatter candidates, which are compatible with the cosmic dark matter relic\ndensity and the above mentioned experimental constraints. They can be probed at\nthe present and future collider and dark matter search experiments. Finally, we\nconsider the nonuniversal gaugino mass model arising from anomaly mediated SUSY\nbreaking. In this case the cosmologically compatible dark matter relic density\nrequires dark matter mass of a few TeV, which puts it beyond the scope of\ncollider and direct dark matter detection experiments. However, it has\ninteresting predictions for some indirect dark matter detection experiments.\n", "  In hydrodynamical modeling of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, the\nfreeze-out is typically assumed to take place at a surface of constant\ntemperature or energy density. A more physical approach is to assume that\nfreeze-out takes place at a surface of constant Knudsen number. We evaluate the\nKnudsen number as a ratio of the expansion rate of the system to the pion\nscattering rate, and apply the constant Knudsen number freeze-out criterion to\nideal hydrodynamical description of heavy-ion collisions at RHIC\n($\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV) and the LHC ($\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=2760$ GeV)\nenergies. We see that once the numerical values of freeze-out temperature and\nfreeze-out Knudsen number are chosen to produce similar $p_T$ distributions,\nthe elliptic and triangular anisotropies are similar too, in both\nevent-by-event and averaged initial state calculations.\n", "  We study the collective behavior of interacting agents in a simple model of\nmarket economics originally introduced by N{\\o}rrelykke and Bak. A general\ntheoretical framework for interacting traders on an arbitrary network is\npresented, with the interaction consisting of buying (namely, consumption) and\nselling (namely, production) of commodities. Extremal dynamics is introduced by\nhaving the agent with least profit in the market readjust prices, causing the\nmarket to self--organize. We study this model market on regular lattices in\ntwo--dimension as well as on random complex networks; in the critical state\nfluctuations in an activity signal exhibit properties that are characteristic\nof avalanches observed in models of self-organized criticality, and these can\nbe described by power--law distributions.\n", "  Synthetic magnetism has been used to control charge neutral excitations for\napplications ranging from classical beam steering to quantum simulation. In\noptomechanics, radiation-pressure-induced parametric coupling between optical\n(photon) and mechanical (phonon) excitations may be used to break time-reversal\nsymmetry, providing the prerequisite for synthetic magnetism. Here we design\nand fabricate a silicon optomechanical circuit with both optical and mechanical\nconnectivity between two optomechanical cavities. Driving the two cavities with\nphase-correlated laser light results in a synthetic magnetic flux, which in\ncombination with dissipative coupling to the mechanical bath, leads to\nnonreciprocal transport of photons with 35dB of isolation. Additionally,\noptical pumping with blue-detuned light manifests as a particle non-conserving\ninteraction between photons and phonons, resulting in directional optical\namplification of 12dB in the isolator through direction. These results indicate\nthe feasibility of utilizing optomechanical circuits to create a more general\nclass of nonreciprocal optical devices, and further, to enable novel\ntopological phases for both light and sound on a microchip.\n", "  A magnetic atomic impurity inside a superconductor locally distorts\nsuperconductivity. They scatter Cooper pairs as a potential with broken\ntime-reversal symmetry, what leads to localized bound states with subgap\nexcitation energies, named hereon Shiba states. Most conventional approaches to\nstudy Shiba states treat magnetic impurities as point scatterers with an\nisotropic exchange interaction, while the complex internal structure of\nmagnetic impurities is usually neglected. Here, we show that the number and the\nshape of Shiba states are correlated to the spin-polarized atomic orbitals of\nthe impurity, hybridized with the superconducting host, as supported by Density\nFunctional Theory simulations. Using high-resolution scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy, we spatially map the five Shiba excitations found on sub-surface\nchromium atoms in Pb(111), resolving both their particle and hole components.\nWhile the maps of particle components resemble the \\textit{d} orbitals of\nembedded Cr atoms, the hole components differ strongly from them. The orbital\nfingerprints of Shiba states thus unveil the magnetic ground state of the\nimpurity, and identify scattering channels and interactions, all valuable tools\nfor designing atomic-scale superconducting devices.\n", "  In this comprehensive study of Kitaev's abelian models defined on a graph\nembedded on a closed orientable surface, we provide complete proofs of the\ntopological ground state degeneracy, the absence of local order parameters,\ncompute the entanglement entropy exactly and characterise the elementary\nanyonic excitations. The homology and cohomolgy groups of the cell complex play\na central role and allow for a rigorous understanding of the relations between\nthe above characterisations of topological order.\n", "  A systematic study of the ground state properties of the entire chains of\neven even neutron magic nuclei represented by isotones of traditional neutron\nmagic numbers N = 8, 20, 40, 50, 82 and 126 has been carried out using\nrelativistic mean field (rmf) plus Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) approach.\nOur present investigation includes deformation, binding energy, two proton\nseparation energy, single particle energy, rms radii along with proton and\nneutron density profiles, etc. Several of these results are compared with the\nresults calculated using non relativistic approach (Skyrme Hartree Fock method)\nalong with available experimental data and indeed they are found with excellent\nagreement. In addition, the possible locations of the proton and neutron drip\nlines, the (Z,N) values for the new shell closures, disappearance of\ntraditional shell closures as suggested by the detailed analyzes of results are\nalso discussed in detail.\n", "  A centipede made of $N$ quantum walkers on a one-dimensional lattice is\nconsidered. The distance between two consecutive legs is either one or two\nlattice spacings, and a global constraint is imposed: the maximal distance\nbetween the first and last leg is $N+1$. This is the strongest global\nconstraint compatible with walking. For an initial value of the wave function\ncorresponding to a localized configuration at the origin, the probability law\nof the first leg of the centipede can be expressed in closed form in terms of\nBessel functions. The dispersion relation and the group velocities are worked\nout exactly. Their maximal group velocity goes to zero when $N$ goes to\ninfinity, which is in contrast with the behaviour of group velocities of\nquantum centipedes without global constraint, which were recently shown by\nKrapivsky, Luck and Mallick to give rise to ballistic spreading of extremal\nwave-front at non-zero velocity in the large-$N$ limit. The corresponding\nHamiltonians are implemented numerically, based on a block structure of the\nspace of configurations corresponding to compositions of the integer $N$. The\ngrowth of the maximal group velocity when the strong constraint is gradually\nrelaxed is explored, and observed to be linear in the density of gaps allowed\nin the configurations. Heuristic arguments are presented to infer that the\nlarge-$N$ limit of the globally constrained model can yield finite group\nvelocities provided the allowed number of gaps is a finite fraction of $N$.\n", "  Stacked van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures where semi-conducting\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials are contacted by overlayed graphene electrodes\nenable atomically-thin, flexible electronics. We use first-principles quantum\ntransport simulations of graphene-contacted MoS2 devices to show how the\ntransistor effect critically depends on the stacking configuration relative to\nthe gate electrode. We can trace this behavior to the stacking-dependent\nresponse of the contact region to the capacitive electric field induced by the\ngate. The contact resistance is a central parameter and our observation\nestablish an important design rule for devices based on 2D atomic crystals.\n", "  We propose an interacting lattice gas model of structural glass characterized\nby particle distinguishability and site-particle-dependent random\nnearest-neighboring particle interactions. This incorporates disorder quenched\nin the configuration space rather than in the physical space. The model\nexhibits non-trivial energetics while still admitting exact equilibrium states\ndirectly constructible at arbitrary temperature and density. The dynamics is\ndefined by activated hopping following standard kinetic Monte Carlo approach\nwithout explicit facilitation rule. Kinetic simulations show emergent dynamic\nfacilitation behaviors in the glassy phase in which motions of individual voids\nare significant only when accelerated by other voids nearby. This provides a\nmicroscopic justification for the dynamic facilitation picture of structural\nglass.\n", "  The carbon to oxygen ratio in a protoplanetary disk can have a dramatic\ninfluence on the compositions of any terrestrial planets formed. In regions of\nhigh C/O, planets form primarily from carbonates and in regions of low C/O, the\nratio of magnesium to silicon determines the types of silicates which dominate\nthe compositions. We present C/O and Mg/Si ratios for 849 F, G, and K dwarfs in\nthe solar neighborhood. We find that the frequency of carbon-rich dwarfs in the\nsolar neighborhood is < 0.13% and that 156 known planet hosts in the sample\nfollow a similar distribution as all of the stars as a whole. The cosmic\ndistribution of Mg/Si for these same stars is broader than the C/O distribution\nand peaks near 1.0 with $\\sim 60$% of systems having $1 \\leq$ Mg/Si $< 2$,\nleading to rocky planet compositions similar to the Earth. This leaves 40% of\nsystems that can have planets that are silicate rich and may have very\ndifferent compositions than our own.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the influence of elastic strain relaxation\non the built-in electrostatic potentials and the electronic properties of axial\n(In,Ga)N/GaN nanowire heterostructures. We employ and evaluate analytical and\nnumerical approaches to compute strain and polarization potentials. These two\ningredients then enter an eight-band k.p model to compute electron and hole\nground states and energies. Our analysis reveals that for a sufficiently large\nratio between the thickness of the (In,Ga)N disk and the diameter of the\nnanowire, the elastic relaxation leads to a significant reduction of the\nbuilt-in electrostatic potential in comparison to a planar system of similar\nlayer thickness and In content. However, a complete elimination of the built-in\npotential cannot be achieved in axial nanowire heterostructures. Nevertheless,\nthe reduction of the built-in electrostatic potential leads to a significant\nmodification of the electron and hole energies. Our findings indicate that the\nrange of accessible ground state transition energies in an axial (In,Ga)N/GaN\nnanowire heterostructure is limited due to the reduced influence of\npolarization potentials for thicker disks. Additionally, we find that strain\nand polarization potentials induce complex confinement features of electrons\nand holes, which depend on the In content, shape, and dimensions of the\nheterostructure.\n", "  In this paper a new approach to study an equation of the Lienard type with a\nstrong quadratic damping is proposed based on Jacobi's last multiplier and\nCheillini's integrability condition. We obtain a closed form solution of the\ntranscendental characteristic equation of the Lienard type equation using the\nLambert W-function.\n", "  Using field theory we calculate the Casimir energy and Casimir force of\ntwo-component Bose-Einstein condensates restricted between two parallel plates,\nin which Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions applied. Our results show\nthat, in one-loop approximation, the Casimir force equals to summation of the\none of each component and it is vanishing in some cases: (i) inter-distance\nbetween two plates becomes large enough; (ii) intraspecies interaction is zero;\n(iii) interspecies interaction is full strong segregation.\n", "  Recent measurements of $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ processes at LHCb and BELLE have\nrevealed tensions at the $2-3\\,\\sigma$ level between the Standard Model (SM)\nprediction and the experimental results in the channels $B\\to K^*\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nand $B_s\\to\\phi\\mu^+\\mu^-$, as well as in the lepton-flavor universality\nviolating observable $R_K={\\rm Br}(B\\to K\\mu^+\\mu^-)/{\\rm Br}(B\\to Ke^+e^-$).\nCombined global fits to the available $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ data suggest that\nthese tensions might have their common origin in New Physics (NP) beyond the SM\nbecause some NP scenarios turn out to be preferred over the SM by\n$4-5\\,\\sigma$. The fact that all these anomalies are related to muons further\nsuggests a connection (and a common NP explanation) with the long-standing\nanomaly in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\\mu$. In this article,\nwe study the impact of a generic class of NP models featuring new heavy scalars\nand fermions that couple to the SM fermions via Yukawa-like interactions. We\nconsider two different scenarios, introducing either one additional fermion and\ntwo scalars or two additional fermions and one scalar, and examine all possible\nrepresentations of the new particles under the SM gauge group with dimension up\nto the adjoint one. The models induce one-loop contributions to $b\\to\ns\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $a_\\mu$ which are capable of solving the respective anomalies\nat the $2\\sigma$ level, albeit a relatively large coupling of the new particles\nto muons is required. In the case of $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$, stringent constraints\nfrom $B_s-\\overline{B}_s$ mixing arise which can be relaxed if the new fermion\nis a Majorana particle.\n", "  The notion of a quasiparticle, such as a phonon, a roton, or a magnon, is\nused in modern condensed matter physics to describe an elementary collective\nexcitation. The intrinsic zero-temperature magnon damping in quantum spin\nsystems can be driven by the interaction of the one-magnon states and\nmulti-magnon continuum. However, detailed experimental studies on this quantum\nmany-body effect induced by an applied magnetic field are rare. Here we present\na high-resolution neutron scattering study in high fields on an S=1/2\nantiferromagnet C9H18N2CuBr4. Compared with the non-interacting linear\nspin-wave theory, our results demonstrate a variety of phenomena including\nfield-induced renormalization of one-magnon dispersion, spontaneous magnon\ndecay observed via intrinsic linewidth broadening, unusual non-Lorentzian\ntwo-peak structure in the excitation spectra, and a dramatic shift of spectral\nweight from one-magnon state to the two-magnon continuum.\n", "  The problem of classification of the Einstein--Friedman cosmological\nHamiltonians $H$ with a single scalar inflaton field $\\varphi$ that possess an\nadditional integral of motion polynomial in momenta on the shell of the\nFriedman constraint $H=0$ is considered. Necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the existence of first, second, and third degree integrals are derived.\nThese conditions have the form of ODEs for the cosmological potential\n$V(\\varphi)$. In the case of linear and quadratic integrals we find general\nsolutions of the ODEs and construct the corresponding integrals explicitly. A\nnew wide class of Hamiltonians that possess a cubic integral is derived. The\ncorresponding potentials are represented in a parametric form in terms of the\nassociated Legendre functions. Six families of special elementary solutions are\ndescribed and sporadic superintegrable cases are discussed.\n", "  Every second millions of small meteoroids enter the Earth's atmosphere\nproducing dense plasmas. Radars easily detect these plasmas and researchers use\nthis data to characterize both the meteoroids and the atmosphere. This paper\ndevelops a first-principle kinetic theory describing the behavior of particles,\nablated from a fast-moving meteoroid, that colliside with the atmospheric\nmolecules. This theory produces analytic expressions describing the spatial\nstructure and velocity distributions of ions and neutrals near the ablating\nmeteoroid. This analytical model will serve as a basis for a more accurate\nquantitative interpretation of radar measurements and should help calculate\nmeteoroid and atmosphere parameters from radar head-echo observations.\n", "  Motivated by recent realizations of Dy$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and\nHo$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$ spin ice thin films, and more generally by the physics\nof confined gauge fields, we study a model of spin ice thin film with surfaces\nperpendicular to the $[001]$ cubic axis. The resulting open boundaries make\nhalf of the bonds on the interfaces inequivalent. By tuning the strength of\nthese inequivalent \"orphan\" bonds, dipolar interactions induce a surface\nordering equivalent to a two-dimensional crystallization of magnetic surface\ncharges. This surface ordering can also be expected on the surfaces of bulk\ncrystals. In analogy with partial wetting in soft matter, spins just below the\nsurface are more correlated than in the bulk, but \\emph{not} ordered. For\nultrathin films made of one cubic unit cell, once the surfaces are ordered, a\nsquare ice phase is stabilized over a finite temperature window, as confirmed\nby its entropy and the presence of pinch points in the structure factor.\nUltimately, the square ice degeneracy is lifted at lower temperature and the\nsystem orders in analogy with the well-known $F$-transition of the $6$-vertex\nmodel.\n", "  Relativistic electron beam transport through a high-density, magnetized\nplasma is studied numerically and theoretically. An electron beam injected into\na cold plasma excites Weibel and two-stream instabilities that heat the beam\nand saturate. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, the heated beam\ncontinues to propagate. However, when a magnetic field of particular strength\nis applied along the direction of beam propagation, a secondary instability of\noff-angle whistler modes is excited. These modes then couple nonlinearly\ncreating a large amplitude parallel propagating whistler that stops the beam.\nIn this letter, we will show the phenomena in detail and explain the mechanism\nof whistler mediated beam stagnation.\n", "  The inverse problem method is tested for a class of monomer-dimer statistical\nmechanics models that contain also an attractive potential and display a\nmean-field critical point at a boundary of a coexistence line. The inversion is\nobtained by analytically identifying the parameters in terms of the correlation\nfunctions and via the maximum-likelihood method. The precision is tested in the\nwhole phase space and, when close to the coexistence line, the algorithm is\nused together with a clustering method to take care of the underlying possible\nambiguity of the inversion.\n", "  This paper calculates the spatial distribution of the plasma responsible for\nradar head echoes by applying the kinetic theory developed in the companion\npaper (Dimant and Oppenheim, arXiv:1608.08524). This results in a set of\nanalytic expressions for the plasma density as a function of distance from the\nmeteoroid. It shows that, at distances less than a collisional mean-free-path\nfrom the meteoroid surface, the plasma density drops in proportion to $1/R$\nwhere $R$ is the distance from the meteoroid center; and, at distances much\nlonger than the mean-free-path behind the meteoroid, the density diminishes at\na rate proportional to $1/R^{2}$. The results of this paper should be used for\nmodeling and analysis of radar head echoes.\n", "  A 23 hour tremor burst was recorded on July 8-9th 2011 at the Katla\nsubglacial volcano, one of the most active and hazardous volcanoes in Iceland.\nThis was associated with deepening of cauldrons on the ice cap and a glacial\nflood that caused damage to infrastructure. Increased earthquake activity\nwithin the caldera started a few days before and lasted for months afterwards\nand new seismic activity started on the south flank. No visible eruption broke\nthe ice and the question arose as to whether this episode relates to a minor\nsubglacial eruption with the tremor being generated by volcanic processes, or\nby the flood. The tremor signal consisted of bursts with varying amplitude and\nduration. We have identified and described three different tremor phases, based\non amplitude and frequency features. A tremor phase associated with the flood\nwas recorded only at stations closest to the river that flooded, correlating in\ntime with rising water level observed at gauging stations. Using\nback-projection of double cross-correlations, two other phases have been\nlocated near the active ice cauldrons and are interpreted to be caused by\nvolcanic or hydrothermal processes. The greatly increased seismicity and\nevidence of rapid melting of the glacier may be explained by a minor\nsub-glacial eruption. It is also plausible that the tremor was generated by\nhydrothermal boiling and/or explosions with no magma involved. This may have\nbeen induced by pressure drop triggered by the release of water when the\nglacial flood started. All interpretations require an increase of heat released\nby the volcano.\n", "  The double red clump (RC) observed in the Milky Way bulge is widely\ninterpreted as evidence for an X-shaped structure. We have recently suggested,\nhowever, an alternative interpretation based on the multiple population\nphenomenon, where the bright RC is from helium enhanced second-generation stars\n(G2), while the faint RC is representing first-generation stars (G1) with\nnormal helium abundance. Here our RC models are constructed in a large\nparameter space to see the effects of metallicity, age, and helium abundance on\nthe double RC feature. Our models show that the luminosity of RC stars is\nmainly affected by helium abundance, while the RC color is primarily affected\nby metallicity. The effect of age is relatively small, unless it is older than\n12 Gyr or much younger than 6 Gyr. The observed double RC feature can therefore\nbe reproduced in a relatively large parameter space, once {\\Delta}Y between G2\nand G1 is assumed to be greater than $\\sim$0.10. We further show that the\nlongitude dependence of the double RC feature at $b \\approx -8.5 \\deg$, which\nwas pointed out by Gonzalez et al. (2015) as a potential problem of our model,\nis well explained in our scenario by a classical bulge embedded in a tilted\nbar.\n", "  Hypergraph states of many quantum bits share the rich interplay between\nsimple combinatorial description and nontrivial entanglement properties enjoyed\nby the graph states that they generalize. In this paper, we consider hypergraph\nstates that are also permutationally invariant. We characterize the states in\nthis class that have nontrivial local Pauli stabilizers and give applications\nto nonlocality and error correction.\n", "  Previous work has established that the localized regime of wave transport in\nopen media is characterized by a position-dependent diffusion coefficient. In\nthis work we study how the concept of position-dependent diffusion affects the\ndelay time, the transverse confinement, the coherent backscattering, and the\ntime reversal of waves. Definitions of energy transport velocity of localized\nwaves are proposed. We start with a phenomenological model of radiative\ntransfer and then present a novel perturbational approach based on the\nself-consistent theory of localization. The latter allows us to obtain results\nrelevant for realistic experiments in disordered quasi-1D wave guides and 3D\nslabs.\n", "  Various universal features of relativistic rotating strings depend on the\norganization of allowed local operators on the worldsheet. In this paper, we\nstudy the set of Neumann boundary operators in effective string theory, which\nare relevant for the controlled study of open relativistic strings with freely\nmoving endpoints. Relativistic open strings are thought to encode the dynamics\nof confined quark-antiquark pairs in gauge theories in the planar\napproximation. Neumann boundary operators can be organized by their behavior\nunder scaling of the target space coordinates X, and the set of allowed\nX-scaling exponents is bounded above by +1/2 and unbounded below. Negative\ncontributions to X-scalings come from powers of a single invariant, or\n\"dressing\" operator, which is bilinear in the embedding coordinates. In\nparticular, we show that all Neumann boundary operators are dressed by\nquarter-integer powers of this invariant, and we demonstrate how this rule\narises from various ways of regulating the short-distance singularities of the\neffective theory.\n", "  We investigate the possibilities of searching for a self-conjugate\npolarizable particle in the self-interactions of light. We first observe that\npolarizability can arise either from the exchange of mediator states or as a\nconsequence of the inner structure of the particle. To exemplify this second\npossibility we calculate the polarizability of a neutral bosonic open string,\nand find it is described only by dimension-8 operators. Focussing on the spin-0\ncase, we calculate the light-by-light scattering amplitudes induced by the\ndimension-6 and 8 polarizability operators. Performing a simulation of\nexclusive diphoton production with proton tagging at the LHC, we find that the\nimprint of the polarizable dark particle can be potentially detected at\n5$\\sigma$ significance for mass and cutoff reaching values above the TeV scale,\nfor $\\sqrt{s}=$13~TeV and 300 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. If the\npolarizable dark particle is stable, it can be a dark matter candidate, in\nwhich case we argue this exclusive diphoton search may complement the existing\nLHC searches for polarizable dark matter.\n", "  We have analyzed the temperature, velocity and density of H2 gas in NGC 7023\nwith a high-resolution near-infrared spectrum of the northwestern filament of\nthe reflection nebula. By observing NGC 7023 in the H and K bands at R ~ 45,000\nwith the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph (IGRINS), we detected 68 H2\nemission lines within the 1\" x 15\" slit. The diagnostic ratios of 2-1 S(1)/1-0\nS(1) is 0.41-0.56. In addition, the estimated ortho-to-para ratios (OPR) is\n1.63-1.82, indicating that the H2 emission transitions in the observed region\narises mostly from gas excited by UV fluorescence. Gradients in the\ntemperature, velocity, and OPR within the observed area imply motion of the\nphotodissociation region (PDR) relative to the molecular cloud. In addition, we\nderive the column density of H2 from the observed emission lines and compare\nthese results with PDR models in the literature covering a range of densities\nand incident UV field intensities. The notable difference between PDR model\npredictions and the observed data, in high rotational J levels of v = 1, is\nthat the predicted formation temperature for newly-formed H2 should be lower\nthan that of the model predictions. To investigate the density distribution, we\ncombine pixels in 1\" x 1\" areas and derive the density distribution at the\n0.002 pc scale. The derived gradient of density suggests that NGC 7023 has a\nclumpy structure, including a high clump density of ~10^5 cm^-3 with a size\nsmaller than ~5 x 10^-3 pc embedded in lower density regions of 10^3-10^4\ncm^-3.\n", "  The twin discoveries of the quantum Hall effect, in the 1980's, and of\ntopological band insulators, in the 2000's, were landmarks in physics that\nenriched our view of the electronic properties of solids. In a nutshell, these\ndiscoveries have taught us that quantum mechanical wavefunctions in crystalline\nsolids may carry nontrivial topological invariants which have ramifications for\nthe observable physics. One of the side effects of the recent topological\ninsulator revolution has been that such physics is much more widespread than\nwas appreciated ten years ago. For example, while topological insulators were\noriginally studied in the context of electron wavefunctions, recent work has\nled to proposals of topological insulators in bosonic systems: in photonic\ncrystals, in the vibrational modes of crystals, and in the excitations of\nordered magnets. Here we confirm the recent proposal that, in a weak magnetic\nfield, the dimerized quantum magnet SrCu$_{2}$(BO$_{3}$)$_2$ is a bosonic\ntopological insulator with nonzero Chern number in the triplon bands and\ntopologically protected chiral edge excitations.\n", "  This paper explores Noether and Noether gauge symmetries of anisotropic\nuniverse model in $f(R,T)$ gravity. We consider two particular models of this\ngravity and evaluate their symmetry generators as well as associated conserved\nquantities. We also find exact solution by using cyclic variable and\ninvestigate its behavior via cosmological parameters. The behavior of\ncosmological parameters turns out to be consistent with recent observations\nwhich indicates accelerated expansion of the universe. Next we study Noether\ngauge symmetry and corresponding conserved quantities for both isotropic and\nanisotropic universe models. We conclude that symmetry generators and the\nassociated conserved quantities appear in all cases.\n", "  We present an absolute extraction method of optical constants of metal from\nthe measured reflection electron energy loss (REELS) spectra by using the\nrecently developed reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) technique. The method is based on\na direct physical modeling of electron elastic and electron inelastic\nscattering near the surface region where the surface excitation becomes\nimportant to fully describe the spectrum loss feature intensity in relative to\nthe elastic peak intensity. An optimization procedure of oscillator parameters\nappeared in the energy loss function (ELF) for describing electron inelastic\nscattering due to the bulk- and surface-excitations was performed with the\nsimulated annealing method by a successive comparison between the measured and\nMonte Carlo simulated REELS spectra. The ELF and corresponding optical\nconstants of Fe were obtained from the REELS spectra measured at incident\nenergies of 1000, 2000 and 3000 eV. The validity of the present optical data\nhas been verified with the f- and ps-sum rules showing the accuracy and\napplicability of the present approach. Our data are also compared with previous\noptical data from other sources.\n", "  We demonstrate an optical fiber fault location method based on the frequency\nresponse of the modulated fiber optical backscattered signal in a steady state\nlow-frequency step regime. Careful calibration and measurement allows for the\nreconstruction of the fiber transfer function, which, associated to its\nmathematical model, is capable of extracting the fiber characteristics. The\ntechnique is capable of identifying non-reflective fault events in an optical\nfiber link and is perfectly compatible with previous methods that focus on the\nreflective events. The fact that the recuperation of the complex signal is\nperformed in the frequency domain and not via a Fourier Transform enables the\nmeasurements to overcome the spatial resolution limitation of Fourier Transform\nincoherent-OFDR measurements even with frequency sweep ranges down to\n100-100000 Hz. This result is backed up by a less than 10 meters difference in\nfault location when compared to standard OTDR measurements.\n", "  We apply a definition of generalised super Calabi-Yau variety (SCY) to\nsupermanifolds of complex dimension one. One of our results is that there are\ntwo SCY's having reduced manifold equal to $\\mathbb{P}^1$, namely the\nprojective super space $\\mathbb{P}^{1|2} $ and the weighted projective super\nspace $\\mathbb{WP}^{1|1}_{(2)}$. Then we compute the corresponding sheaf\ncohomology of superforms, showing that the cohomology with picture number one\nis infinite dimensional, while the de Rham cohomology, which is what matters\nfrom a physical point of view, remains finite dimensional. Moreover, we provide\nthe complete real and holomorphic de Rham cohomology for generic projective\nsuper spaces $\\mathbb P^{n|m}$. We also determine the automorphism groups:\nthese always match the dimension of the projective super group with the only\nexception of $\\mathbb{P}^{1|2} $, whose automorphism group turns out to be\nlarger than the projective general linear supergroup. By considering the\ncohomology of the super tangent sheaf, we compute the deformations of\n$\\mathbb{P}^{1|m}$, discovering that the presence of a fermionic structure\nallows for deformations even if the reduced manifold is rigid. Finally, we show\nthat $\\mathbb{P}^{1|2} $ is self-mirror, whereas $\\mathbb{WP} ^{1|1}_{(2)}$ has\na zero dimensional mirror. Also, the mirror map for $\\mathbb{P}^{1|2}$\nnaturally endows it with a structure of $N=2$ super Riemann surface.\n", "  The Trump phenomenon is argued to depart from current populist rise in\nEurope. According to a model of opinion dynamics from sociophysics the\nmachinery of Trump's amazing success obeys well-defined counter-intuitive\nrules. Therefore, his success was in principle predictable from the start. The\nmodel uses local majority rule arguments and obeys a threshold dynamics. The\nassociated tipping points are found to depend on the leading collective\nbeliefs, cognitive biases and prejudices of the social group which undertakes\nthe public debate. And here comes the sesame of the Trump campaign, which\ndevelops along two successive steps. During a first moment, Trump's statement\nproduces a majority of voters against him. But at the same time, according to\nthe model the shocking character of the statement modifies the prejudice\nbalance. In case the prejudice is present even being frozen among voters, the\ntipping point is lowered at Trump's benefit. Nevertheless, although the tipping\npoint has been lowered by the activation of frozen prejudices it is\ninstrumental to preserve enough support from openly prejudiced people to be\nabove the threshold. Then, as infuriated voters launch intense debate,\noccurrence of ties will drive progressively hostile people to shift their\nvoting intention without needing to endorse the statement which has infuriated\nthem. The on going debate does drive towards a majority for Trump. The possible\nTrump victory at November Presidential election is discussed. In particular,\nthe model shows that to eventually win the Presidential election, Trump must\nnot modify his past shocking attitude but to appeal to a different spectrum of\nfrozen prejudices, which are common to both Democrats and Republicans.\n", "  In this work we study a model of tax evasion. We considered a fixed\npopulation divided in three compartments, namely honest tax payers, tax evaders\nand a third class between the mentioned two, which we call\n\\textit{susceptibles} to become evaders. The transitions among those\ncompartments are ruled by probabilities, similarly to a model of epidemic\nspreading. These probabilities model social interactions among the individuals,\nas well as the government's fiscalization. We simulate the model on\nfully-connected graphs, as well as on scale-free and random complex networks.\nFor the fully-connected and random graph cases we observe that the emergence of\ntax evaders in the population is associated with an active-absorbing\nnonequilibrium phase transition, that is absent in scale-free networks.\n", "  Central galaxies make up the majority of the galaxy population, including the\nmajority of the quiescent population at $\\mathcal{M}_* >\n10^{10}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Thus, the mechanism(s) responsible for quenching\ncentral galaxies plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution as whole. We combine\na high resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation with observed evolutionary\ntrends of the \"star formation main sequence,\" quiescent fraction, and stellar\nmass function at $z < 1$ to construct a model that statistically tracks the\nstar formation histories and quenching of central galaxies. Comparing this\nmodel to the distribution of central galaxy star formation rates in a group\ncatalog of the SDSS Data Release 7, we constrain the timescales over which\nphysical processes cease star formation in central galaxies. Over the stellar\nmass range $10^{9.5}$ to $10^{11} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ we infer quenching\ne-folding times that span $1.5$ to $0.5\\; \\mathrm{Gyr}$ with more massive\ncentral galaxies quenching faster. For $\\mathcal{M}_* =\n10^{10.5}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, this implies a total migration time of $\\sim\n4~\\mathrm{Gyrs}$ from the star formation main sequence to quiescence. Compared\nto satellites, central galaxies take $\\sim 2~\\mathrm{Gyrs}$ longer to quench\ntheir star formation, suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for\nquenching centrals versus satellites. Finally, the central galaxy quenching\ntimescale we infer provides key constraints for proposed star formation\nquenching mechanisms. Our timescale is generally consistent with gas depletion\ntimescales predicted by quenching through strangulation. However, the exact\nphysical mechanism(s) responsible for this still remain unclear.\n", "  A challenging issue in General Relativity concerns the determination of the\nmanifestly-covariant continuum Hamiltonian structure underlying the Einstein\nfield equations and the related formulation of the corresponding covariant\nHamilton-Jacobi theory. The task is achieved by adopting a synchronous\nvariational principle requiring distinction between the prescribed\ndeterministic metric tensor $\\widehat{g}(r)\\equiv \\left\\{ \\widehat{g}_{\\mu \\nu\n}(r)\\right\\} $ solution of the Einstein field equations which determines the\ngeometry of the background space-time and suitable variational fields $x\\equiv\n\\left\\{ g,\\pi \\right\\} $ obeying an appropriate set of continuum Hamilton\nequations, referred to here as GR-Hamilton equations$.$ It is shown that a\nprerequisite for reaching such a goal is that of casting the same equations in\nevolutionary form by means of a Lagrangian parametrization for a\nsuitably-reduced canonical state. As a result, the corresponding\nHamilton-Jacobi theory is established in manifestly-covariant form. Physical\nimplications of the theory are discussed. These include the investigation of\nthe structural stability of the GR-Hamilton equations with respect to vacuum\nsolutions of the Einstein equations, assuming that wave-like perturbations are\ngoverned by the canonical evolution equations.\n", "  A non-perturbative quantum field theory of General Relativity is presented\nwhich leads to a new realization of the theory of Covariant Quantum-Gravity\n(CQG-theory). The treatment is founded on the recently-identified Hamiltonian\nstructure associated with the classical space-time, i.e., the corresponding\nmanifestly-covariant Hamilton equations and the related Hamilton-Jacobi theory.\nThe quantum Hamiltonian operator and the CQG-wave equation for the\ncorresponding CQG-state and wave-function are realized in $% 4-$scalar form.\nThe new quantum wave equation is shown to be equivalent to a set of quantum\nhydrodynamic equations which warrant the consistency with the classical GR\nHamilton-Jacobi equation in the semiclassical limit. A perturbative\napproximation scheme is developed, which permits the adoption of the harmonic\noscillator approximation for the treatment of the Hamiltonian potential. As an\napplication of the theory, the stationary vacuum CQG-wave equation is studied,\nyielding a stationary equation for the CQG-state in terms of the $4-$scalar\ninvariant-energy eigenvalue associated with the corresponding approximate\nquantum Hamiltonian operator. The conditions for the existence of a discrete\ninvariant-energy spectrum are pointed out. This yields a possible estimate for\nthe graviton mass together with a new interpretation about the quantum origin\nof the cosmological constant.\n", "  In General Relativity coupled to a non-linear electromagnetic field, together\nwith a negative cosmological constant, we obtain the general static spherical\nsymmetric black hole solution with magnetic charges, which is asymptotic to\nanti-de Sitter (AdS) space-times. In particular, for a degenerate case the\nsolution becomes a Hayward-AdS black hole, which is regular everywhere in the\nfull space-time. The existence of such a regular black hole solution preserves\nthe weak energy condition while the strong energy condition is violated. We\nthen derive the first law and the Smarr formula of the black hole solution. We\nfurther discuss its thermodynamic properties and study the critical phenomena\nin the extended phase space where the cosmological constant is treated as a\nthermodynamic variable as well as the parameter associated with the non-linear\nelectrodynamics. We obtain many interesting results such as: the Maxwell's\nequal area law in the $P-V$ (or $S-T$) diagram is violated and consequently the\ncritical point $(T_*\\,,P_*)$ of the first order small-large black hole\ntransition does not coincide with the inflection point ($T_c\\,,P_c$) of the\nisotherms; the Clapeyron equation describing the coexistence curve of the Van\nder Waals (vdW) fluid is no longer valid; the heat capacity at constant\npressure is finite at the critical point; the various exponents near the\ncritical point are also different from those of the vdW fluid.\n", "  We study the structure of two-point correlators of the inflationary field\nfluctuations in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the existing\nmethods to calculate primordial spectra. We present a description motivated by\nthe separation of the fast and slow evolving components of the spectrum which\nis based on Cholesky decomposition of the field correlator matrix. Our purpose\nis to rewrite all the relevant equations of motion in terms of slowly varying\nquantities. This is important in order to consider the contribution from\nhigh-frequency modes to the spectrum without affecting computational\nperformance. The slow-roll approximation is not required to reproduce the main\ndistinctive features in the power spectrum for each specific model of\ninflation.\n", "  We study the patterns of flavour violation in renormalisable extensions of\nthe Standard Model (SM) that contain vector-like quarks (VLQs) in a single\ncomplex representation of either the SM gauge group $G_{SM}$ or $G_{SM}' =\nG_{SM} \\times U(1)_{L_\\mu - L_\\tau}$. We first decouple VLQs in the $M=(1-10)$\nTeV range and then at the electroweak scale also $Z, Z'$ gauge bosons and\nadditional scalars to study the resulting phenomenology that depends on the\nrelative size of $Z$- and $Z'$-induced flavour-changing neutral currents, as\nwell as the size of $\\Delta F=2$ contributions including the effects of\nrenormalisation group Yukawa evolution from $M$ to the electroweak scale that\nturn out to be very important for models with right-handed currents through the\ngeneration of left-right operators. In addition to rare decays like $P\\to\n\\ell\\bar\\ell$, $P\\to P' \\ell\\bar\\ell$, $P\\to P'\\nu\\bar\\nu$ with $P=K, B_s, B_d$\nand $\\Delta F=2$ observables we analyze the ratio $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$\nwhich appears in the SM to be significantly below the data. We study patterns\nand correlations between these observables which taken together should in the\nfuture allow for differentiating between VLQ models. In particular the patterns\nin models with left-handed and right-handed currents are markedly different\nfrom each other. Among the highlights are large $Z$-mediated new physics\neffects in Kaon observables in some of the models and significant effects in\n$B_{s,d}$-observables. $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ can easily be made consistent\nwith the data, implying then uniquely the suppression of $K_L\\to \\pi^0\n\\nu\\bar\\nu$. Significant enhancements of $Br(K^+\\to \\pi^+ \\nu\\bar\\nu)$ are\nstill possible. We point out that the combination of $\\Delta F=2$ and $\\Delta\nF=1$ observables in a given meson system generally allows to determine the\nmasses of VLQs independently of the size of VLQ couplings.\n", "  The goal of nanophotonics is to control and manipulate light at length scales\nbelow the diffraction limit. Typically nanostructured metals are used for this\npurpose, light being confined by exploiting the surface plasmon-polaritons such\nstructures support. Recently excitonic (molecular) materials have been\nidentified as an alternative candidate material for nanophotonics. Here we use\ntheoretical modelling to explore how hybridisation of surface\nexciton-polaritons can be achieved through appropriate nanostructuring. We\nfocus on the extent to which the frequency of the hybridised modes can be\nshifted with respect to the underlying material resonances.\n", "  We demonstrate optimization of thermal conductance across nanostructures by\ndeveloping a method combining atomistic Green's function and Bayesian\noptimization. With an aim to minimize and maximize the interfacial thermal\nconductance (ITC) across Si-Si and Si-Ge interfaces by means of Si/Ge composite\ninterfacial structure, the method identifies the optimal structures from\ncalculations of only a few percent of the entire candidates (over 60,000\nstructures). The obtained optimal interfacial structures are non-intuitive and\nimpacting: the minimum-ITC structure is an aperiodic superlattice that realizes\n50% reduction from the best periodic superlattice. The physical mechanism of\nthe minimum ITC can be understood in terms of crossover of the two effects on\nphonon transport: as the layer thickness in superlattice increases, the impact\nof Fabry-P\\'erot interference increases, and the rate of reflection at the\nlayer-interfaces decreases. Aperiodic superlattice with spatial variation in\nthe layer thickness has a degree of freedom to realize optimal balance between\nthe above two competing mechanism. Furthermore, aperiodicity breaks the\nconstructive phonon interference between the interfaces inhibiting the coherent\nphonon transport. The present work shows the effectiveness and advantage of\nmaterial informatics in designing nanostructures to control heat conduction,\nwhich can be extended to other interfacial structures.\n", "  We discovered a new transmodal Fabry-P\\'erot resonance that one elastic-wave\nmode is maximally transmitted to another when the phase difference of two\ndissimilar modes through an anisotropic layer is exactly odd multiples of\n{\\pi}. Unlike the well-established Fabry-P\\'erot resonance, the transmodal\nresonance must involve two coupled elastic-wave modes, longitudinal and shear.\nThe formation of wiggly transmodal transmission spectra is due to structural\ninstability appearing in anisotropic mode-coupled elastic-media. Experiments\nwith elastic metamaterials confirmed our findings which can play a critical\nrole in shear-mode ultrasound applications.\n", "  Bethe lattice spins glasses are supposed to be marginally stable, i.e. their\nequilibrium probability distribution changes discontinuously when we add an\nexternal perturbation. So far the problem of a spin glass on a Bethe lattice\nhas been studied only using an approximation where marginally stability is not\npresent, which is wrong in the spin glass phase. Because of some technical\ndifficulties, attempts at deriving a marginally stable solution have been\nconfined to some perturbative regimes, high connectivity lattices or\ntemperature close to the critical temperature. Using the cavity method, we\npropose a general non-perturbative approach to the Bethe lattice spin glass\nproblem using approximations that should be hopeful consistent with marginal\nstability.\n", "  We identify a new mechanism for propagation into unstable states in spatially\nextended systems, that is based on resonant interaction in the leading edge of\ninvasion fronts. Such resonant invasion speeds can be determined solely based\non the complex linear dispersion relation at the unstable equilibrium, but rely\non the presence of a nonlinear term that facilitates the resonant coupling. We\nprove that these resonant speeds give the correct invasion speed in a simple\nexample, we show that fronts with speeds slower than the resonant speed are\nunstable, and corroborate our speed criterion numerically in a variety of model\nequations, including a nonlocal scalar neural field model.\n", "  Understanding quantum dynamics in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC) relies on understanding how vortices interact with each others\nmicroscopically and with local imperfections of the potential which confines\nthe condensate. Within a system consisting of many vortices, the trajectory of\na vortex-antivortex pair is often scattered by a third vortex, an effect\npreviously characterised. However, the natural question remains as to how much\nof this effect is due to the velocity induced by this third vortex and how much\nis due to the density inhomogeneity which it introduces. In this work, we\ndescribe the various qualitative scenarios which occur when a vortex-antivortex\npair interacts with a smooth density impurity whose profile is identical to\nthat of a vortex but lacks the circulation around it.\n", "  We predict the emergence of spin Hall magnetoresistance in a magnetic bilayer\ncomposed of a normal metal adjacent to an antiferromagnet. Based on a recently\nderived drift-diffusion equation, we show that the resistance of the bilayer\ndepends on the relative angle between the direction transverse to the current\nflow and the N\\'eel order parameter. Although this effect presents striking\nsimilarities with the spin Hall magnetoresistance recently reported in\nferromagnetic bilayers, in the present case its physical origin is attributed\nto the anisotropic spin relaxation of itinerant spins in the antiferromagnet.\n", "  Recent work has demonstrated that black hole thermodynamics and information\nloss/restoration in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ can be derived almost entirely from the\nbehavior of the Virasoro conformal blocks at large central charge, with\nrelatively little dependence on the precise details of the CFT spectrum or OPE\ncoefficients. Here, we elaborate on the non-perturbative behavior of Virasoro\nblocks by classifying all `saddles' that can contribute for arbitrary values of\nexternal and internal operator dimensions in the semiclassical large central\ncharge limit. The leading saddles, which determine the naive semiclassical\nbehavior of the Virasoro blocks, all decay exponentially at late times, and at\na rate that is independent of internal operator dimensions. Consequently, the\nsemiclassical contribution of high-energy states does not resolve a well-known\nversion of the information loss problem in AdS$_3$. However, we identify two\ninfinite classes of sub-leading saddles, and one of these classes does not\ndecay at late times.\n", "  A quantum dot coupled to a superconducting contact provides a tunable\nartificial analogue of a magnetic atom in a superconductor, a paradigmatic\nquantum impurity problem. We realize such a system with an InAs semiconductor\nnanowire contacted by an Al-based superconducting electrode. We use an\nadditional normal-type contact as weakly coupled tunnel probe to perform\ntunneling spectroscopy measurements of the elementary sub-gap excitations,\nknown as Andreev bound states or Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. We demonstrate that\nthe energy of these states, $\\zeta$, scales with the ratio between the Kondo\ntemperature, $T_K$, and the superconducting gap, $\\Delta$. $\\zeta$ vanishes for\n$T_K/\\Delta \\approx 0.6$, denoting a quantum phase transition between spin\nsinglet and doublet ground states. By further leveraging the gate control over\nthe quantum dot parameters, we determine the singlet-doublet phase boundary in\nthe stability diagram of the system. Our experimental results show remarkable\nquantitative agreement with numerical renormalization group calculations.\n", "  We revisit classical bounds of M. E. Fisher on the ferromagnetic Ising model,\nand show how to efficiently use them on an arbitrary given graph to rigorously\nupper-bound the partition function, magnetizations, and correlations. The\nresults are valid on any finite graph, with arbitrary topology and arbitrary\npositive couplings and fields. Our results are based on high temperature\nexpansions of the aforementioned quantities, and are expressed in terms of two\nrelated linear operators: the non-backtracking operator and the Bethe Hessian.\nAs a by-product, we show that in a well-defined high-temperature region, the\nsusceptibility propagation algorithm converges and provides an upper bound on\nthe true spin-spin correlations.\n", "  Be stars have generally been characterized by the emission lines in their\nspectra, and especially the time variability of those spectroscopic features.\nThey are known to also exhibit photometric variability at multiple timescales,\nbut have not been broadly compared and analyzed by that behavior. We have taken\nadvantage of the advent of wide-field, long-baseline, and high-cadence\nphotometric surveys that search for transiting exoplanets to perform a\ncomprehensive analysis of brightness variations among a large number of known\nBe stars. The photometric data comes from the KELT transit survey, with a\ntypical cadence of 30 minutes, baseline of up to ten years, photometric\nprecision of about 1%, and coverage of about 60% of the sky. We analyze KELT\nlight curves of 610 known Be stars in both the Northern and Southern\nhemispheres in an effort to study their variability. Consistent with other\nstudies of Be star variability, we find most of the stars to be photometrically\nvariable. We derive lower limits on the fraction of stars in our sample that\nexhibit features consistent with non-radial pulsations (25%), outbursts (36%),\nand long term trends in the circumstellar disk (37%), and show how these are\ncorrelated with spectral sub-type. Other types of variability, such as those\nowing to binarity, are also explored. Simultaneous spectroscopy for some of\nthese systems from the Be Star Spectral Database (BeSS) allow us to better\nunderstand the physical causes for the observed variability, especially in\ncases of outbursts and changes in the disk.\n", "  The simplest Standard Model extension to explain neutrino masses involves the\naddition of right-handed neutrinos. At some level, this extension will impact\nneutrino oscillation searches. In this work we explore the differences and\nsimilarities between the case in which these neutrinos are kinematically\naccessible (sterile neutrinos) or not (mixing matrix non-unitarity). We clarify\napparent inconsistencies in the present literature when using different\nparametrizations to describe these effects and recast both limits in the\npopular neutrino non-standard interaction (NSI) formalism. We find that, in the\nlimit in which sterile oscillations are averaged out at the near detector,\ntheir effects at the far detector coincide with non-unitarity at leading order,\neven in presence of a matter potential. We also summarize the present bounds\nexisting in both limits and compare them with the expected sensitivities of\nnear future facilities taking the DUNE proposal as a benchmark. We conclude\nthat non-unitarity effects are too constrained to impact present or near future\nneutrino oscillation facilities but that sterile neutrinos can play an\nimportant role at long baseline experiments. The role of the near detector is\nalso discussed in detail.\n", "  We investigate the landscape of constraints on MeV-GeV scale, hidden U(1)\nforces with nonzero axial-vector couplings to Standard Model fermions. While\nthe purely vector-coupled dark photon, which may arise from kinetic mixing, is\na well-motivated scenario, several MeV-scale anomalies motivate a theory with\naxial couplings which can be UV-completed consistent with Standard Model gauge\ninvariance. Moreover, existing constraints on dark photons depend on products\nof various combinations of axial and vector couplings, making it difficult to\nisolate the effects of axial couplings for particular flavors of SM fermions.\nWe present a representative renormalizable, UV-complete model of a dark photon\nwith adjustable axial and vector couplings, discuss its general features, and\nshow how some UV constraints may be relaxed in a model with nonrenormalizable\nYukawa couplings at the expense of fine-tuning. We survey the existing\nparameter space and the projected reach of planned experiments, briefly\ncommenting on the relevance of the allowed parameter space to low-energy\nanomalies in pi^0 and 8-Be* decay.\n", "  We develop reduced, stochastic models for high dimensional, dissipative\ndynamical systems that relax very slowly to equilibrium and can encode long\nterm memory. We present a variety of empirical and first principles approaches\nfor model reduction, and build a mathematical framework for analyzing the\nreduced models. We introduce the notions of universal and asymptotic filters to\ncharacterize `optimal' model reductions for sloppy linear models. We illustrate\nour methods by applying them to the practically important problem of modeling\nevaporation in oil spills.\n", "  Path-integral analyses originally pioneered in the study of the complex-phase\nproblem afflicting lattice calculations of finite-density quantum\nchromodynamics are generalized to non-relativistic Fermi gases with repulsive\ninteractions. Using arguments similar to those previously applied to\nrelativistic theories, we show that the analogous problem in nonrelativistic\nsystems manifests itself naturally in Tan's contact as a nontrivial\ncancellation between terms with varied dependence on extensive thermodynamic\nquantities. We analyze that case under the assumption of gaussian phase\ndistribution, which is supported by our Monte Carlo calculations and\nperturbative considerations. We further generalize these results to observables\nother than the contact, as well as to polarized systems and systems with fixed\nparticle number. Our results are quite general in that they apply to repulsive\nmulti-component fermions, are independent of dimensionality or trapping\npotential, and hold in the ground state as well as at finite temperature.\n", "  Nice slices have played a pivotal role in the discussion of the black hole\ninformation paradox as they avoid regions of strong spacetime curvature and yet\nsmoothly cut through the infalling matter and the outgoing Hawking radiation,\nthus, justifying the use of low energy field theory. To avoid information loss\nit has been argued recently, however, that local effective field theory has to\nbreak down at the horizon. To assess the extent of this breakdown in a UV\ncomplete framework we study string-theoretic effects on nice slices in\nSchwarzschild black holes. Our purpose is two-fold. First, we use nice slices\nto address various open questions and caveats of arXiv:1402.1486 where it was\nargued that boost-enhanced non-adiabatic string-theoretic effects at the\nhorizon could provide a dynamical mechanism for the firewall. Second, we\nidentify two non-adiabatic effects on nice slices in Schwarzschild black holes:\npair production of open strings near the horizon enhanced by the presence of\nthe infinite tower of highly excited string states and a late-time\nnon-adiabatic effect intrinsic to nice slices.\n", "  Sensitive charge detection has enabled qubit readout in solid-state systems.\nRecently, an alternative to the well-established charge detection via on-chip\nelectrometers has emerged, based on in situ gate detectors and radio-frequency\ndispersive readout techniques. This approach promises to facilitate scalability\nby removing the need for additional device components devoted to sensing. Here,\nwe perform gate-based dispersive readout of an accumulation-mode silicon\nquantum dot. We observe that the response of an accumulation-mode gate detector\nis significantly affected by its bias voltage, particularly if this exceeds the\nthreshold for electron accumulation. We discuss and explain these results in\nlight of the competing capacitive contributions to the dispersive response.\n", "  We study the one photon scattering problem for a super cavity (SC) coupling\nwith two two-level atoms. With atomic decay, we find a sudden drop in\nreflection at $\\Delta=0$ for the two atoms in the node-antinode configuration\nbut not in the antinode-node one. The underlying mechanism is due to the\nscatterer has a configuration dependent localized dissipated eigen-mode at\n$\\Delta=0$. In the node-antinode configuration, the eigen-mode localized near\nthe input side, which can transport the photon into the SC. By exciting the\natom at the node, the photon can leak into the reservoir due to atomic decay,\nwhich causes the sudden drop at $\\Delta=0$ in reflection. In the antinode-node\ncase, however, the eigen-mode is localized near the output side, no photon can\nbe transported into the SC and leads to completely reflection at $\\Delta=0$. A\nsimilar phenomenon has been observed in a recent experiment of X-ray quantum\noptics [Nature \\textbf{482}, 199 (2012)] but with a much more complicated\nexplanation due to electromagnetically induced transparency.\n", "  We suggest a simple algebraic approach to fix the elements of the $\\{ \\beta\n\\}$-expansion for renormalization group invariant quantities, which uses\nadditional degrees of freedom. The approach is discussed in detail for N$^2$LO\ncalculations in QCD with the MSSM gluino -- an additional degree of freedom. We\nderive the formulae of the $\\{ \\beta \\}$-expansion for the nonsinglet Adler\n$D$-function and Bjorken polarized sum rules in the actual N$^3$LO within this\nquantum field theory scheme with the MSSM gluino and the scheme with the second\nadditional degree of freedom. We discuss the properties of the $\\{ \\beta\n\\}$-expansion for higher orders considering the N$^4$LO as an example.\n", "  We conduct a global, weakly nonlinear analysis of the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) in a Taylor-Couette flow. This is a multiscale perturbative\ntreatment of the nonideal, axisymmetric MRI near threshold, subject to\nrealistic radial boundary conditions and cylindrical geometry. We analyze both\nthe standard MRI, initialized by a constant vertical background magnetic field,\nand the helical MRI, with an azimuthal background field component. This is the\nfirst weakly nonlinear analysis of the MRI in a global Taylor-Couette geometry,\nas well as the first weakly nonlinear analysis of the helical MRI. We find that\nthe evolution of the amplitude of the standard MRI is described by a real\nGinzburg-Landau equation (GLE), while the amplitude of the helical MRI takes\nthe form of a complex GLE. This suggests that the saturated state of the\nhelical MRI may itself be unstable on long spatial and temporal scales.\n", "  The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a fundamental process of accretion\ndisk physics, but its saturation mechanism remains poorly understood despite\nconsiderable theoretical and computational effort. We present a multiple scales\nanalysis of the non-ideal MRI in the weakly nonlinear regime -- that is, when\nthe most unstable MRI mode has a growth rate asymptotically approaching zero\nfrom above. Here, we develop our theory in a local, Cartesian channel. Our\nresults confirm the finding by Umurhan et al. (2007) that the perturbation\namplitude follows a Ginzburg-Landau equation. We further find that the\nGinzburg-Landau equation will arise for the local MRI system with\nshear-periodic boundary conditions when the effects of ambipolar diffusion are\nconsidered. A detailed force balance for the saturated azimuthal velocity and\nvertical magnetic field demonstrates that even when diffusive effects are\nimportant, the bulk flow saturates via the combined processes of reducing the\nbackground shear and rearranging and strengthening the background vertical\nmagnetic field. We directly simulate the Ginzburg-Landau amplitude evolution\nfor our system and demonstrate the pattern formation our model predicts on long\nlength and time scales. We compare the weakly nonlinear theory results to a\ndirect numerical simulation of the MRI in a thin-gap Taylor Couette flow.\n", "  We study field diffeomorphisms $\\Phi(x)=\nF(\\rho(x))=a_0\\rho(x)+a_1\\rho^2(x)+\\ldots=\\sum_{j+0}^\\infty a_j \\rho^{j+1}$,\nfor free and interacting quantum fields $\\Phi$. We find that the theory is\ninvariant under such diffeomorphisms if and only if kinematic renormalization\nschemes are used.\n", "  On 2016 June 22, 2E 1613.5-5053, the puzzling central compact object in\nsupernova remnant RCW 103, emitted a magnetar-like burst. Using Director's\nDiscretionary Time, we observed 2E 1613.5-5053 with the Hubble Space Telescope\n(WFC3/IR) and we report here on the detection of a previously unseen infrared\ncounterpart. In observations taken on 2016 July 4 and August 11, we detect a\nnew source ($m_\\mathrm{F110W} = 26.3$ AB mag and $m_\\mathrm{F160W} = 24.2$ AB\nmag) at the Chandra position of 2E 1613.5-5053 which was not detected in\nHST/NICMOS images from 2002 August 15 and October 8 to a depth of 24.5 AB mag\n(F110W) and 25.5 AB mag (F160W). We show that these deep IR observations rule\nout the possibility of an accreting binary but mimic IR emission properties of\nmagnetars and isolated neutron stars. The presence or absence of a low-mass\nfallback disk cannot be confirmed from our observations.\n", "  We investigate the critical behaviors of correlation length and critical\nexponents for strongly interacting bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice\nvia quantum Monte Carlo simulations. By comparing the full numerical results to\nthose given by the effective theory, we quantitatively determine the critical\nregime where the universal scaling behaviors applies for both classical\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at a finite temperature and quantum\nphase transition from superfluid to Mott insulator. Our results show that the\ncritical regime can be as large as a few lattice sites in optical lattice and\nshould be observable in present experimental conditions.\n", "  We theoretically study multielectron effects in high-harmonic generation\n(HHG), using all-electron first-principles simulations for a one-dimensional\n(1D) model atom. In addition to usual plateau and cutoff (from a cation in the\npresent case, since the neutral is immediately ionized), we find a prominent\nresonance peak far above the plateau and a second plateau extended beyond the\nfirst cutoff. These features originate from the dication response enhanced by\norders of magnitude due to the action of the Coulomb force from the\nrescattering electron, and, hence, are a clear manifestation of electron\ncorrelation. Although the present simulations are done in 1D, the physical\nmechanism underlying the dramatic enhancement is expected to hold also for\nthree-dimensional real systems. This will provide new possibilities to explore\ndynamical electron correlation in intense laser fields using HHG, which is\nusually considered to be of single-electron nature in most cases.\n", "  We present some new families of quadratic vector fields, not necessarily\nintegrable, for which their Kahan-Hirota-Kimura discretization exhibits the\npreservation of some of the characterizing features of the underlying\ncontinuous systems (conserved quantities and invariant measures).\n", "  We present a spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of 79 nearby M dwarfs in 77\nsystems. All are low-proper-motion southern hemisphere objects and were\nidentified in a nearby star survey with a demonstrated sensitivity to young\nstars. Using low-resolution optical spectroscopy from the Red Side Spectrograph\n(RSS) on the South African Large Telescope (SALT), we have determined radial\nvelocities, H-alpha, Lithium 6708\\AA, and Potassium 7699\\AA~equivalent widths\nlinked to age and activity, and spectral types for all our targets. Combined\nwith astrometric information from literature sources, we identify 44 young\nstars. Eighteen are previously known members of moving groups within 100\nparsecs of the Sun. Twelve are new members, including one member of the TW\nHydra moving group, one member of the 32 Orionis moving group, nine members of\nTucana-Horologium, one member of Argus, and two new members of AB Doradus. We\nalso find fourteen young star systems that are not members of any known groups.\nThe remaining 33 star systems do not appear to be young. This appears to be\nevidence of a new population of nearby young stars not related to the known\nnearby young moving groups.\n", "  We study some (conformal) field theories with global symmetries in the sector\nwhere the value of the global charge $Q$ is large. We find (as expected) that\nthe low energy excitations of this sector are described by the general form of\nGoldstone's theorem in the non-relativistic regime. We also derive the\nunexpected result, first presented in [Hellerman et al. 2015], that the\neffective field theory describing such sector of fixed $Q$ contains effective\ncouplings $\\lambda_{\\text{eff}}\\sim \\lambda^b /Q^{a}$, where $\\lambda$ is the\noriginal coupling. Hence, large charge leads to weak coupling. In the last\nsection of the paper we present an outline of how to compute anomalous\ndimensions of the $O(n)$ model in this limit.\n", "  Carbon ion beam radiotherapy enables a very localised dose deposition.\nHowever, already small changes in the patient geometry or positioning errors\ncan significantly distort the dose distribution. A live monitoring system of\nthe beam delivery within the patient is therefore highly desirable and could\nimprove patient treatment. We present a novel three-dimensional imaging method\nof the beam in the irradiated object, exploiting the measured tracks of single\nsecondary ions emerging under irradiation. The secondary particle tracks are\ndetected with a TimePix stack, a set of parallel pixelated semiconductor\ndetectors. We developed a three-dimensional reconstruction algorithm based on\nmaximum likelihood expectation maximisation. We demonstrate the applicability\nof the new method in an irradiation of a cylindrical PMMA phantom of human head\nsize with a carbon ion pencil beam of 226MeV/u. The beam image in the phantom\nis reconstructed from a set of 9 discrete detector positions between -80 and 50\ndegrees from the beam axis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential to\nvisualise inhomogeneities by irradiating a PMMA phantom with an air gap as well\nas bone and adipose tissue surrogate inserts. We successfully reconstructed a\n3D image of the treatment beam in the phantom from single secondary ion tracks.\nThe beam image corresponds well to the distribution expected from the beam\ndirection and energy. In addition, cylindrical inhomogeneities with a diameter\nof 2.85cm and density differences down to 0.3g/cm$^3$ to the surrounding\nmaterial are clearly visualised. This novel 3D method to image a therapeutic\ncarbon ion beam in the irradiated object does not interfere with the treatment\nand requires knowledge only of single secondary ion tracks. Even with detectors\nwith only a small angular coverage, the 3D reconstruction of the fragmentation\npoints presented in this work was found to be feasible.\n", "  We study the relationship between quantum chaos and pseudorandomness by\ndeveloping probes of unitary design. A natural probe of randomness is the\n\"frame potential,\" which is minimized by unitary $k$-designs and measures the\n$2$-norm distance between the Haar random unitary ensemble and another\nensemble. A natural probe of quantum chaos is out-of-time-order (OTO)\nfour-point correlation functions. We show that the norm squared of a\ngeneralization of out-of-time-order $2k$-point correlators is proportional to\nthe $k$th frame potential, providing a quantitative connection between chaos\nand pseudorandomness. Additionally, we prove that these $2k$-point correlators\nfor Pauli operators completely determine the $k$-fold channel of an ensemble of\nunitary operators. Finally, we use a counting argument to obtain a lower bound\non the quantum circuit complexity in terms of the frame potential. This\nprovides a direct link between chaos, complexity, and randomness.\n", "  This presents an overview of relativistic hydrodynamic modeling in heavy-ion\ncollisions prepared for Hot Quarks 2016, at South Padre Island, TX, USA. The\ninfluence of the initial state and viscosity on various experimental\nobservables are discussed. Specific problems that arise in the hydrodynamical\nmodeling at the Beam Energy Scan are briefly discussed.\n", "  We study various classical aspects of the Weyl transverse (WTDiff) gravity in\na general space-time dimension. First of all, we clarify a classical\nequivalence among three kinds of gravitational theories, those are, the\nconformally-invariant scalar tensor gravity, Einstein's general relativity and\nthe WTDiff gravity via the gauge fixing procedure. Secondly, we show that in\nthe WTDiff gravity the cosmological constant is a mere integration constant as\nin unimodular gravity, but it does not receive any radiative corrections unlike\nthe unimodular gravity. A key point in this proof is to construct a covariantly\nconserved energy-momentum tensor, which is achieved on the basis of this\nequivalence relation. Thirdly, we demonstrate that the Noether current for the\nWeyl transformation is identically vanishing, thereby implying that the Weyl\nsymmetry existing in both the conformally-invariant scalar tensor gravity and\nthe WTDiff gravity is a \"fake\" symmetry. We find it possible to extend this\nproof to all matter fields, i.e. the Weyl invariant scalar, vector and spinor\nfields. Fourthly, it is explicitly shown that in the WTDiff gravity the\nSchwarzshild black hole metric and a charged black hole one are classical\nsolutions to the equations of motion only when they are expressed in the\nCartesian coordinate system. Finally, we consider the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology and provide some exact\nsolutions.\n", "  We present a new high-order finite volume reconstruction method for\nhyperbolic conservation laws. The method is based on a piecewise cubic\npolynomial which provides its solutions a fifth-order accuracy in space. The\nspatially reconstructed solutions are evolved in time with a fourth-order\naccuracy by tracing the characteristics of the cubic polynomials. As a result,\nour temporal update scheme provides a significantly simpler and computationally\nmore efficient approach in achieving fourth order accuracy in time, relative to\nthe comparable fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. We demonstrate that the\nsolutions of PCM converges in fifth-order in solving 1D smooth flows described\nby hyperbolic conservation laws. We test the new scheme in a range of numerical\nexperiments, including both gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics applications\nin multiple spatial dimensions.\n", "  Large area MoS2 and WS2 van der Waals epitaxial thin films with complete\ncontrol over number of layers including monolayer is grown by pulsed laser\ndeposition utilizing slower growth kinetics. The films grown on c-plane\nsapphire show stiffening of A1g and E12g phonon modes with decreasing number of\nlayers for both MoS2 and WS2. The observed stiffening translate into the\ncompressive strain of 0.52 % & 0.53 % with accompanying increase in fundamental\ndirect band gap to 1.74 and 1.68 eV for monolayer MoS2 and WS2, respectively.\nThe strain decays with the number of layers. HRTEM imaging directly reveals the\nnature of atomic registry of van der Waals layers with the substrate and the\nassociated compressive strain. The results demonstrate a practical route to\nstabilize and engineer strain for this class of material over large area device\nfabrication.\n", "  In this work the low density regions of nuclear and neutron star matter are\nstudied. The search for the existence of pasta phases in this region is\nperformed within the context of the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, which\nincorporates quark degrees of freedom. Fixed proton fractions are considered,\nas well as nuclear matter in beta equilibrium at zero temperature. We discuss\nthe recent attempts to better understand the surface energy in the coexistence\nphases regime and we present results that show the existence of the pasta\nphases subject to some choices of the surface energy coefficient. We also\nanalyze the influence of the nuclear pasta on some neutron star properties. The\nequation of state containing the pasta phase will be part of a complete grid\nfor future use in supernova simulations.\n", "  BaSnO$_3$ (BSO) is a promising transparent conducting oxide (TCO) with\nreported room-temperature (RT) Hall mobility exceeding 320\ncm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. Among perovskite oxides, it has the highest RT\nmobility, about 30 times higher than that of the prototypical SrTiO$_3$. Using\nfirst-principles calculations based on hybrid density functional theory, we\nelucidate the physical mechanisms that govern the mobility by studying the\ndetails of LO-phonon and ionized impurity scattering. A careful numerical\nanalysis to obtain converged results within the relaxation-time approximation\nof Boltzmann transport theory is presented. The ${\\bf k}$ dependence of the\nrelaxation time is fully taken into account. We find that the high RT mobility\nin BSO originates not only from a small effective mass, but also from a\nsignificant reduction in the phonon scattering rate compared to other\nperovskite oxides; the origins of this reduction are identified. Ionized\nimpurity scattering influences the total mobility even at RT for dopant\ndensities larger than $5\\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, and becomes comparable to\nLO-phonon scattering for $1\\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ doping, reducing the drift\nmobility from its intrinsic LO-phonon-limited value of $\\sim$594\ncm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ to less than 310 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. We suggest\npathways to avoid impurity scattering via modulation doping or polar\ndiscontinuity doping. We also explicitly calculate the Hall factor and Hall\nmobility, allowing a direct comparison to experimental reports for bulk and\nthin films and providing insights into the nature of the dominant mechanisms\nthat limit mobility in state-of-the art samples.\n", "  Modern precision experiments trapping low-energy particles require detailed\nsimulations of particle trajectories and spin precession to determine\nsystematic measurement limitations and apparatus deficiencies. We developed\nPENTrack, a tool that allows to simulate trajectories of ultracold neutrons and\ntheir decay products---protons and electrons---and the precession of their\nspins in complex geometries and electromagnetic fields. The interaction of\nultracold neutrons with matter is implemented with the Fermi-potential\nformalism and diffuse scattering using Lambert and microroughness models. The\nresults of several benchmark simulations agree with STARucn v1.2, uncovered\nseveral flaws in Geant4 v10.2.2, and agree with experimental data. Experiment\ngeometry and electromagnetic fields can be imported from commercial\ncomputer-aided-design and finite-element software. All simulation parameters\nare defined in simple text files allowing quick changes. The simulation code is\nwritten in C++ and is freely available at github.com/wschreyer/PENTrack.git.\n", "  This paper analyses urban accessibility using a fully dynamic approach.\n", "  We study the synchronization of chaotic units connected through time-delayed\nfluctuating interactions. We focus on small-world networks of Bernoulli and\nLogistic units with a fixed chiral backbone. Comparing the synchronization\nproperties of static and fluctuating networks, we find that random network\nalternations can enhance the synchronizability. Synchronized states appear to\nbe maximally stable when fluctuations are much faster than the time-delay, even\nwhen the instantaneous state of the network does not allow synchronization.\nThis enhancing effect disappears for very slow fluctuations. For fluctuation\ntime scales of the order of the time-delay, a desynchronizing resonance is\nreported. Moreover, we observe characteristic oscillations, with a periodicity\nrelated to the coupling delay, as the system approaches or drifts away from the\nsynchronized state.\n", "  We propose a test based on direct detection data that allows to determine if\nthe dark matter particle is different from its antiparticle. The test requires\nthe precise measurement of the dark matter spin-independent direct detection\ncross sections off $\\mathrm{three}$ different nuclei, and consists of\ninterpreting such signals in terms of self-conjugate (particle $=$\nantiparticle) dark matter to see if such interpretation is consistent. If it is\nnot, the dark matter must be different from its antiparticle. We illustrate\nthis procedure for two sets of target nuclei, $\\mathrm{\\{Xe, Ar, Si\\}}$ and\n$\\mathrm{\\{Xe, Ar, Ge\\}}$, identifying the regions of the parameter space where\nit is particularly feasible. Our results indicate that future signals in direct\ndetection experiments, if sufficiently accurate, might be used to establish\nthat the dark matter particle is not its own antiparticle --a major step\ntowards the determination of the fundamental nature of the dark matter.\n", "  Markov state models (MSMs) and Master equation models are popular approaches\nto approximate molecular kinetics, equilibria, metastable states, and reaction\ncoordinates in terms of a state space discretization usually obtained by\nclustering. Recently, a powerful generalization of MSMs has been introduced,\nthe variational approach (VA) of molecular kinetics and its special case the\ntime-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), which allow us to\napproximate slow collective variables and molecular kinetics by linear\ncombinations of smooth basis functions or order parameters. While it is known\nhow to estimate MSMs from trajectories whose starting points are not sampled\nfrom an equilibrium ensemble, this has not yet been the case for TICA and the\nVA. Previous estimates from short trajectories, have been strongly biased and\nthus not variationally optimal. Here, we employ Koopman operator theory and\nideas from dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extend the VA and TICA to\nnon-equilibrium data. The main insight is that the VA and TICA provide a\ncoefficient matrix that we call Koopman model, as it approximates the\nunderlying dynamical (Koopman) operator in conjunction with the basis set used.\nThis Koopman model can be used to compute a stationary vector to reweight the\ndata to equilibrium. From such a Koopman-reweighted sample, equilibrium\nexpectation values and variationally optimal reversible Koopman models can be\nconstructed even with short simulations. The Koopman model can be used to\npropagate densities, and its eigenvalue decomposition provide estimates of\nrelaxation timescales and slow collective variables for dimension reduction.\nKoopman models are generalizations of Markov state models, TICA and the linear\nVA and allow molecular kinetics to be described without a cluster\ndiscretization.\n", "  Quantum processes involving single-photon states are of broad interest in\nparticular for quantum communication. Extending to continuous values a recent\nproposal by Yuan et al \\cite{YUAN16}, we show that single-photon quantum\nprocesses can be characterized using phase randomized coherent states (PRCS) as\ninputs. As a proof of principle, we present the experimental investigation of\nsingle-photon tomography using PRCS. The probability distribution of field\nquadratures measurements for single-photon states can be accurately derived\nfrom the PRCS data. As a consequence, the Wigner function and the density\nmatrix of single-photon states are reconstructed with good precision. The\nsensitivity of the reconstruction to experimental errors and the number of PRCS\nused is addressed.\n", "  Spectra of $q \\bar{q}$ hadrons are investigated in the framework of the\nHamiltonian obtained from the relativistic path integral in external\nhomogeneous magnetic field. The spectra of all 12 spin-isospin s-wave states,\ngenerated by $\\pi$ and $\\rho$ mesons with different spin projections, are\nstudied both analytically and numerically on the lattice as functions of\n(magnetic field) $eB$. Results are in agreement and demonstrate three types of\nbehavior, with characteristic splittings predicted by the theory.\n", "  We continue with the analysis of finite temperature corrections to the\nTachyon mass in intersecting branes which was initiated in arxiv:1403.0389. In\nthis paper we extend the computation to the case of intersecting D3-branes by\nconsidering a setup of two intersecting branes in flat-space background. A\nholographic model dual to BCS superconductor consisting of intersecting\nD8-branes in D4-brane background was proposed in arxiv:1104.2843. The\nbackground considered here is a simplified configuration of this dual model. We\ncompute the one-loop Tachyon amplitude in the Yang-Mills approximation and show\nthat the result is finite. Analyzing the amplitudes further we numerically\ncompute the transition temperature at which the Tachyon becomes massless. The\nanalytic expressions for the one-loop amplitudes obtained here reduce to those\nfor intersecting D1-branes obtained in arxiv:1403.0389 as well as those for\nintersecting D2-branes.\n", "  The octant of the atmospheric mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ is still\nundetermined by neutrino oscillation experiments. Long-baseline experiments\nlike NO$\\nu$A, T2K and DUNE offer good prospects for determining the octant of\n$\\theta_{23}$. However, their capability to do so may be compromised by the\npossible presence of non-unitarity in the leptonic mixing matrix. In this\npaper, we study in detail the octant degeneracy with and without non-unitarity\nat the level of oscillation probabilities and events for these experiments. We\nalso analyze their octant sensitivity and discovery reach and show that they\nare hampered in the presence of non-unitarity.\n", "  We have studied the complete set of dimension 5 and dimension 6 effective\noperators involving the interaction of scalar, fermion and vector Dark Matter\n(DM) with SM quarks and gluons, to explore the possibility to distinguish these\noperators and characterise the spin of DM at the LHC. We have found that three\nfactors - the effective dimension of the operator, the structure of the SM part\nof the operator and the parton densities of the SM particles connected to the\noperator - uniquely define the shape of the (unobservable) invariant mass\ndistribution of the DM pair and, consequently, the shape of the (observable)\nMET distribution related to it. Using $\\chi^2$ analysis, we found that at the\nLHC, with a luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$, certain classes of EFT operators can\nbe distinguished from each other. Hence, since DM spin is partly correlated\nwith the factors defining the shape of MET, the LHC can potentially shed a\nlight also on DM spin. We have also observed a drastic difference in the\nefficiencies (up to two orders of magnitude) for large MET cuts scenarios with\ndifferent DM spin, thus indicating that the DM discovery potential strongly\ndepends on it. The study we perform here can be applied more generally than\nwithin the EFT paradigm, where the DM mediator is not produced\non-the-mass-shell, such as the case of t-channel mediator or mediator with mass\nbelow $2M_{DM}$, where the invariant mass of the DM pair is not fixed.\n", "  We study an azimuthally-symmetric boost-invariant quark-gluon plasma using\nquasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics including the effects of both shear and\nbulk viscosities. We compare results obtained using the quasiparticle method\nwith the standard anisotropic hydrodynamics and viscous hydrodynamics. We\nconsider the predictions of the three methods for the differential particle\nspectra and mean transverse momentum. We find that the three methods agree for\nsmall shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\\eta/s$, but show differences\nat large $\\eta/s$. Additionally, we find that the standard anisotropic\nhydrodynamics method shows suppressed production at low transverse-momentum\ncompared to the other two methods, and the bulk-viscous correction can drive\nthe primordial particle spectra negative at large $p_T$ in viscous\nhydrodynamics.\n", "  We present the partition function of a most generic $U(N)$ single plaquette\nmodel in terms of representations of unitary group. Extremising the partition\nfunction in large N limit we obtain a relation between eigenvalues of unitary\nmatrices and number of boxes in the most dominant Young tableaux distribution.\nSince, eigenvalues of unitary matrices behave like coordinates of free fermions\nwhereas, number of boxes in a row is like conjugate momenta of the same, a\nrelation between them allows us to provide a phase space distribution for\ndifferent phases of the unitary model under consideration. This proves a\nuniversal feature that all the phases of a generic unitary matrix model can be\ndescribed in terms of topology of free fermi phase space distribution. Finally,\nusing this result and analytic properties of resolvent that satisfy\nDyson-Schwinger equation, we present a phase space distribution of unfolded\nzeros of Riemann zeta function.\n", "  We find that biorthogonal quantum mechanics with a scalar product that counts\nboth absorbed and emitted particles leads to covariant position operators with\nlocalized eigenvectors. In this manifestly covariant formulation the\nprobability for a transition from a one-photon state to a position eigenvector\nis the first order Glauber correlation function, bridging the gap between\nphoton counting and the sensitivity of light detectors to electromagnetic\nenergy density. The position eigenvalues are identified as the spatial\nparameters in the canonical quantum field operators and the position basis\ndescribes an array of localized devices that instantaneously absorb and re-emit\nbosons.\n", "  I study a model which describes the birth of the universe using a global\ntopological phase transition with a complex manifold where the time, $\\tau$, is\nconsidered as a complex variable. Before the big bang $\\tau$ is a purely\nimaginary variable so that the space can be considered as Euclidean. The phase\ntransition from a pre-inflation to inflation is examined by studying the\ndynamical rotation of the time on the complex plane. Back-reaction effects are\nexactly calculated using Relativistic Quantum Geometry.\n", "  Repetitive spatio-temporal propagation patterns are encountered in fields as\nwide-ranging as climatology, social communication and network science. In\nneuroscience, perfectly consistent repetitions of the same global propagation\npattern are called a synfire pattern. For any recording of sequences of\ndiscrete events (in neuroscience terminology: sets of spike trains) the\nquestions arise how closely it resembles such a synfire pattern and which are\nthe spike trains that lead/follow. Here we address these questions and\nintroduce an algorithm built on two new indicators, termed SPIKE-Order and\nSpike Train Order, that define the Synfire Indicator value, which allows to\nsort multiple spike trains from leader to follower and to quantify the\nconsistency of the temporal leader-follower relationships for both the original\nand the optimized sorting. We demonstrate our new approach using artificially\ngenerated datasets before we apply it to analyze the consistency of propagation\npatterns in two real datasets from neuroscience (Giant Depolarized Potentials\nin mice slices) and climatology (El Ni~no sea surface temperature recordings).\nThe new algorithm is distinguished by conceptual and practical simplicity, low\ncomputational cost, as well as flexibility and universality.\n", "  Nearly-sterile neutrinos with masses in the MeV range and below would be\nproduced in the beam of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program at Fermilab.\nIn this article, we study the potential for SBN to discover these particles\nthrough their subsequent decays in its detectors. We discuss the decays which\nwill be visible at SBN in a minimal and non-minimal extension of the Standard\nModel, and perform simulations to compute the parameter space constraints which\ncould be placed in the absence of a signal. We demonstrate that the SBN program\ncan extend existing bounds on well constrained channels such as $N \\rightarrow\n\\nu l^+ l^-$ and $N \\rightarrow l^\\pm \\pi^\\mp$ while, thanks to the strong\nparticle identification capabilities of liquid-Argon technology, also place\nbounds on often neglected channels such as $N \\rightarrow \\nu\\gamma$ and $N\n\\rightarrow \\nu \\pi^0$. Furthermore, we consider the phenomenological impact of\nimproved event timing information at the three detectors. As well as\nconsidering its role in background reduction, we note that if the\nlight-detection systems in SBND and ICARUS can achieve nanosecond timing\nresolution, the effect of finite sterile neutrino mass could be directly\nobservable, providing a smoking-gun signature for this class of models. We\nstress throughout that the search for heavy nearly-sterile neutrinos is a\ncomplementary new physics analysis to the search for eV-scale oscillations, and\nwould extend the BSM program of SBN while requiring no beam or detector\nmodifications.\n", "  New crystal structures of fully hydrogenated borophene (borophane) have been\npredicted by first principles calculation. Comparing with the chair-like\nborophane (C-boropane) that has been reported in literature, we obtained four\nnew borophane conformers with much lower total-energy. The most stable one,\nwashboard-like borophane (W-borophane), has energy about 113.41 meV/atom lower\nthan C-borophane. In order to explain the relative stability of different\nborophane conformers, the atom configuration, density of states, charge\ntransfer, charge density distribution and defect formation energy of B-H dimer\nhave been calculated. The results show that the charge transfer from B atoms to\nH atoms is crucial for the stability of borophane. In different borophane\nconformers, the bonding characteristics between B and H atoms are similar, but\nthe B-B bonds in W-borophane are much stronger than that in C-borophane or\nother structures. In addition, we examined the dynamical stability of borophane\nconformers by phonon dispersions and found that the four new conformers are all\ndynamically stable. Finally the mechanical properties of borophane conformers\nalong an arbitrary direction have been discussed. W-borophane possesses unique\nelectronic structure (Dirac cone), good stability and superior mechanical\nproperties. W-borophane has broad perspective for nano electronic device.\n", "  This manuscript reviews recent theoretical progress on the understanding of\nthe quark gluon plasma in a magnetic field that I presented on the conference\nHot Quarks 2016, held at South Padre Island, Texas, USA, 12-17 September 2016.\nIt is shown that, using a holographic bottom-up Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton model,\none can have a good quantitative agreement with Lattice data for QCD equation\nof state and Polyakov loop with nonzero magnetic field. I also present results\nfor the anisotropic shear viscosity ratio $\\eta_{\\parallel}/\\eta_{\\perp}$, with\nthe conclusion that $\\eta_{\\parallel}<\\eta_{\\perp}$ for $B>0$.\n", "  We analyze the probability density function (PDF) of waiting times between\nfinancial loss exceedances. The empirical PDFs are fitted with the self-excited\nHawkes conditional Poisson process with a long power law memory kernel. The\nHawkes process is the simplest extension of the Poisson process that takes into\naccount how past events influence the occurrence of future events. By analyzing\nthe empirical data for 15 different financial assets, we show that the\nformalism of the Hawkes process used for earthquakes can successfully model the\nPDF of interevent times between successive market losses.\n", "  We argue that contemporary jet substructure techniques might facilitate a\nmore direct measurement of hard medium-induced gluon bremsstrahlung in\nheavy-ion collisions, and focus specifically on the \"soft drop declustering\"\nprocedure that singles out the two leading jet substructures. Assuming coherent\njet energy loss, we find an enhancement of the distribution of the energy\nfractions shared by the two substructures at small subjet energy caused by hard\nmedium-induced gluon radiation. Departures from this approximation are\ndiscussed, in particular, the effects of colour decoherence and the\ncontamination of the grooming procedure by soft background. Finally, we propose\na complementary observable, that is the ratio of the two-pronged probability in\nPb-Pb to proton-proton collisions and discuss its sensitivity to various energy\nloss mechanisms.\n", "  Colloidal Quantum dots (CQDs) are nowadays one of the cornerstones of modern\nphotonics as they have led to the emergence of new optoelectronic and\nbiomedical technologies. However, the full characterization of these quantum\nemitters is currently restricted to the visible wavelengths and it remains a\nkey challenge to optically probe single CQDs operating in the infrared spectral\ndomain which is targeted by a growing number of applications. Here, we report\nthe first experimental detection and imaging at room temperature of single\ninfrared CQDs operating at telecommunication wavelengths. Imaging was done with\na doubly resonant bowtie nano-aperture antenna (BNA) written at the end of a\nfiber nanoprobe, whose resonances spectrally fit the CQD absorption and\nemission wavelengths. Direct near-field characterization of PbS CQDs reveal\nindividual nanocrystals with a spatial resolution of 75 nm (lambda/20) together\nwith their intrinsic 2D dipolar free-space emission properties and exciton\ndynamics (blinking phenomenon). Because the doubly resonant BNA is strongly\ntransmissive at both the CQD absorption and emission wavelengths, we are able\nto perform all-fiber nano-imaging with a standard 20 % efficiency InGaAs\navalanche photodiode (APD). Detection efficiency is predicted to be 3000 fold\nlarger than with a conventional circular aperture tip of the same transmission\narea. Double resonance BNA fiber probes thus offer the possibility of exploring\nextreme light-matter interaction in low band gap CQDs with current\nplug-and-play detection techniques, opening up new avenues in the fields of\ninfrared light emitting devices, photodetectors, telecommunications,\nbio-imaging and quantum information technology.\n", "  Heavier resonances are continually being added to the hadronic spectrum from\nthe Particle Data Group that follow an exponentially increasing mass spectrum.\nHowever, it has been suggested that even further states predicted from Quark\nModels are needed in the hadronic spectrum in order to improve the agreement\nbetween the hadron resonance gas model predictions and lattice QCD data. We\nfind that the inclusion of such states with extrapolated branching ratios\nslightly decreases the freezeout temperature. To eliminate ambiguities, we\nintroduce a first principle method to extract the freeze-out temperature for\ncharged kaons from experimental data, which yields a lower bound of\n$T_{\\text{fo}} \\gtrsim $145 MeV for the highest collision energy at RHIC.\n", "  Based on the bilinear operator and symbol calculation, some lump solutions\nare presented, rationally localized in all directions in the space, to a\nreduced (3+1)-dimensional KP equation. The lump solutions all contain six\nparameters, four of which must cater to the non-zero conditions so as to insure\nthe analyticity and rational localization, while the others are free. Then the\ninteraction between lump soliton and one stripe soliton is described and the\nresult shows that the lump soliton will be drowned or swallowed by the stripe\nsoliton. Furthermore, we extend this method to a new combination of positive\nquadratic function and hyperbolic functions. Especially, it is interesting that\na rogue wave is found to be aroused by the interaction between lump soliton and\na pair of resonance stripe solitons. By choosing the values of the parameters,\nthe dynamic properties of lump solution, interaction between lump soliton and\none stripe soliton, rogue wave, generated by the interaction between lump\nsoliton and a pair of resonance solitons, are shown graphically.\n", "  We report the results of $\\gamma_{\\rm dir}$ and $\\pi^{0}$-hadron azimuthal\ncorrelations as a measure of the away-side jet-like correlated yields in\ncentral Au+Au and p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV in the STAR\nexperiment. The charged-hadron per-trigger yields at mid-rapidity with respect\nto high-$p_{T}$ $\\gamma_{\\rm dir}$ and $\\pi^{0}$ in central Au+Au collisions\nare compared with p+p collisions. Within uncertainties, the same $z_{T}$\n(~$p_{T}^{\\mathrm{assoc}}$ / $p_{T}^{\\mathrm{trig}}$) dependence of the\nsuppression is observed for $\\gamma_{\\rm dir}$ and $\\pi^{0}$ - triggers. The\nresults are compared with energy-loss model predictions. The $\\gamma-\\rm jet$\nmeasurements can provide further understanding on the redistribution of\nin-medium energy loss. Ongoing $\\gamma-\\rm jet$ studies in the STAR experiment\nare also discussed.\n", "  The results obtained by the plasma physics community for the validation and\nthe prediction of turbulence and transport in magnetized plasma come mainly\nfrom the use of very CPU-consuming particle-in-cell or (gyro)kinetic codes\nwhich naturally include non-Maxwellian kinetic effects. To date, fluid codes\nare not considered to be relevant for the description of these kinetic effects.\nHere, after revisiting the limitations of the current fluid theory developed in\nthe 19th century, we generalize the fluid theory including kinetic effects such\nas non-Maxwellian super-thermal tails with as few fluid equations as possible.\nThe collisionless and collisional fluid closures from the nonlinear Landau\nFokker-Planck collision operator are shown for an arbitrary collisionality.\nIndeed, the first fluid models associated with two examples of collisionless\nfluid closures are obtained by assuming an analytic non-Maxwellian distribution\nfunction (e.g., the INMDF [O. Izacard, Phys. Plasmas 23, 082504 (2016)]). One\nof the main differences with the literature is our analytic representation of\nthe distribution function in the velocity phase space with as few hidden\nvariables as possible thanks to the use of non-orthogonal basis sets. These new\nnon-Maxwellian fluid equations could initiate the next generation of fluid\ncodes including kinetic effects and can be expanded to other scientific\ndisciplines such as astrophysics, condensed matter, or hydrodynamics. As a\nvalidation test, we perform a numerical simulation based on a minimal reduced\nINMDF fluid model. The result of this test is the discovery of the origin of\nparticle and heat diffusion. The diffusion is due to the competition between a\ngrowing INMDF on short time scales due to spatial gradients and the\nthermalization on longer time scales. The results shown here could draw the\nbreaking of some unsolved understandings of the turbulence.\n", "  In this proceedings I briefly review the recent progress achieved on the\ncalculation of $v_n$ at high $p_T$ via the coupling of a jet energy loss model\nwith full event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics. It is shown that that this\nframework can simultaneously describe experimental data for $R_{AA}$, $v_2$,\nand $v_3$ at high $p_T$. High $p_T$ $v_2$ is found to be approximately linearly\ncorrelated with the soft $v_2$ on an event-by-event basis, which opens up a new\nway to correlate soft and hard observables in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  We use leading order effective kinetic theory to simulate the\npre\\nobreakdash-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow\nperturbations in heavy-ion collisions. We provide a Green function which\npropagates the initial perturbations of the energy-momentum tensor to a time\nwhen hydrodynamics becomes applicable. With this map, the pre-thermal evolution\nfrom saturated nuclei to hydrodynamics can be modeled in the framework of\nweakly coupled QCD.\n", "  We investigate deformations of extremal near-horizon geometries in\nEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory, including various topological terms, and also\nin D=11 supergravity. By linearizing the field equations and Bianchi identities\nover the compact spatial cross-sections of the near-horizon geometry, we prove\nthat the moduli associated with such deformations are constrained by elliptic\nsystems of PDEs. The moduli space of deformations of near-horizon geometries in\nthese theories is therefore shown to be finite dimensional.\n", "  Currently at the Beam Energy Scan at RHIC experimental efforts are being made\nto find the QCD critical point. On the theoretical side, the behavior of\nhigher-order susceptibilities of the net-baryon charge from Lattice QCD at\n$\\mu_{_B}\\!=\\!0$ may allow us to estimate the position of the critical point in\nthe QCD phase diagram. However, even if the series expansion continues to\nhigher-orders, there is always the possibility to miss the critical point\nbehavior due to truncation errors. An alternative approach is to use a black\nhole engineered holographic model, which displays a critical point at large\ndensities and matches lattice susceptibilities at $\\mu_{_B}\\!=\\!0$. Using the\nthermodynamic data from this black hole model, we obtain the freeze-out points\nextracted from the net-protons distribution measured at STAR and explore higher\norder fluctuations at the lowest energies at the beam energy scan to\ninvestigate signatures of the critical point.\n", "  We make phenomenological predictions for particle spectra and elliptic flow\nin heavy-ion collisions using 3+1d anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydro) including\nthe effects of both shear and bulk viscosities. The dynamical equations\nnecessary are derived by taking moments of the Boltzmann equation allowing for\nthree distinct (diagonal) momentum-space anisotropy parameters. The formulation\nis based on relaxation-time approximation for the collisional kernel and a\nlattice-QCD-based equation of state. Evolving the system to late times, we\ncalculate particle production using THERMINATOR 2, modified to account for an\nellipsoidal distribution function. We obtain particle spectra for different\nparticle species such as pions, kaons, and protons, and elliptic flow $v_2$ as\na function of centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity. In our model, we\nhave four free parameters, i.e. freeze-out temperature, initial central energy\ndensity, initial momentum-space anisotropies, and shear viscosity to entropy\ndensity ratio. Using a multidimensional fit to LHC experimental data, we make a\npreliminary extraction of these parameters. We find reasonable agreement\nbetween 3+1d aHydro and available experimental data for $\\eta/s\\sim 0.23$.\n", "  Valley-spin coupling in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can result in\nunusual spin transport behaviors under an external magnetic field. Nonlocal\nresistance measured from 2D materials such as TMDs via electrical Hanle\nexperiments are predicted to exhibit nontrivial features, compared with results\nfrom conventional materials due to the presence of intervalley scattering as\nwell as a strong internal spin-orbit field. Here, for the first time, we report\nthe all-electrical injection and non-local detection of spin polarized carriers\nin trilayer MoS_2 films. We calculate the Hanle curves theoretically when the\nseparation between spin injector and detector is much larger than spin\ndiffusion length, \\lamda_s. The experimentally observed curve matches the\ntheoretically-predicted Hanle shape under the regime of slow intervalley\nscattering. The estimated spin life-time was found to be around 110 ps at 30 K.\n", "  We study nonlinear optical response of Landau quantized graphene to an\nintense electromagnetic wave. In particular, we consider high harmonic\ngeneration process. It is shown that one can achieve efficient generation of\nhigh harmonics with strong radiation fields -- when the work of the wave\nelectric field on the magnetic length is larger than pump photon energy. At\nthat high harmonics generation process takes place for a wide range of the pump\nwave frequencies and intensities even for significant broadening of Landau\nlevels because of impurities in graphene.\n", "  We study the cubic vertices for Maxwell-like higher-spins in flat and (A)dS\nbackground spaces of any dimension. Reducibility of their free spectra implies\nthat a single cubic vertex involving any three fields subsumes a number of\ncouplings among different particles of various spins. The resulting vertices do\nnot involve traces of the fields and in this sense are simpler than their\nFronsdal counterparts. We propose an extension of both the free theory and of\nits cubic deformation to a more general class of partially reducible systems,\nthat one can obtain from the original theory upon imposing trace constraints of\nvarious orders. The key to our results is a version of the Noether procedure\nallowing to systematically account for the deformations of the transversality\nconditions to be imposed on the gauge parameters at the free level.\n", "  We describe two new open source tools written in Python for performing\nextreme deconvolution Gaussian mixture modeling (XDGMM) and using a conditioned\nmodel to re-sample observed supernova and host galaxy populations. XDGMM is new\nprogram for using Gaussian mixtures to do density estimation of noisy data\nusing extreme deconvolution (XD) algorithms that has functionality not\navailable in other XD tools. It allows the user to select between the AstroML\n(Vanderplas et al. 2012; Ivezic et al. 2015) and Bovy et al. (2011) fitting\nmethods and is compatible with scikit-learn machine learning algorithms\n(Pedregosa et al. 2011). Most crucially, it allows the user to condition a\nmodel based on the known values of a subset of parameters. This gives the user\nthe ability to produce a tool that can predict unknown parameters based on a\nmodel conditioned on known values of other parameters. EmpiriciSN is an example\napplication of this functionality that can be used for fitting an XDGMM model\nto observed supernova/host datasets and predicting likely supernova parameters\nusing on a model conditioned on observed host properties. It is primarily\nintended for simulating realistic supernovae for LSST data simulations based on\nempirical galaxy properties.\n", "  We study 4d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theories on a compact Euclidean\nmanifold of the form $S^1 \\times\\mathcal{M}_3$. Partition functions of gauge\ntheories on this background can be computed using localization, and explicit\nformulas have been derived for different choices of the compact manifold\n$\\mathcal{M}_3$. Taking the limit of shrinking $S^1$, we present a general\nformula for the limit of the localization integrand, derived by simple\neffective theory considerations, generalizing the result of arXiv:1512.03376.\nThe limit is given in terms of an effective potential for the holonomies around\nthe $S^1$, whose minima determine the asymptotic behavior of the partition\nfunction. If the potential is minimized in the origin, where it vanishes, the\npartition function has a Cardy-like behavior fixed by $\\mathrm{Tr}(R)$, while a\nnontrivial minimum gives a shift in the coefficient. In all the examples that\nwe consider, the origin is a minimum if $\\mathrm{Tr}(R) \\leq 0$.\n", "  We assess the impact of trapped Lyman alpha cooling radiation on the\nformation of direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). We apply a one-zone chemical\nand thermal evolution model, accounting for the photodetachment of H- ions,\nprecursors to the key coolant H2, by Lyman alpha photons produced during the\ncollapse of a cloud of primordial gas in an atomic cooling halo at high\nredshift. We find that photodetachment of H- by trapped Lyman alpha photons may\nlower the level of the H2-dissociating background radiation field required for\nDCBH formation substantially, dropping the critical flux by up to a factor of a\nfew. This translates into a potentially large increase in the expected number\ndensity of DCBHs in the early Universe, and supports the view that DCBHs may be\nthe seeds for the BHs residing in the centers of a significant fraction of\ngalaxies today. We find that detachment of H- by Lyman alpha has the strongest\nimpact on the critical flux for the relatively high background radiation\ntemperatures expected to characterize the emission from young, hot stars in the\nearly Universe. This lends support to the DCBH origin of the highest redshift\nquasars.\n", "  We show that measurements of the rapidity dependence of transverse momentum\ncorrelations can be used to determine the characteristic time $\\tau_{\\pi}$ that\ndictates the rate of isotropization of the stress energy tensor, as well as the\nshear viscosity $\\nu = \\eta/sT$. We formulate methods for computing these\ncorrelations using second order dissipative hydrodynamics with noise. Current\ndata are consistent with $\\tau_{\\pi}/\\nu \\sim 10$ but targeted measurements can\nimprove this precision.\n", "  We present measurements of the diffusion coefficient of ultrasound in\nstrongly scattering three-dimensional (3D) disordered media using the dynamic\ncoherent backscattering (CBS) effect. Our experiments measure the CBS of\nultrasonic waves using a transducer array placed in the far-field of a 3D slab\nsample of brazed aluminum beads surrounded by vacuum. We extend to 3D media the\ngeneral microscopic theory of CBS that was developed initially for acoustic\nwaves in 2D. This theory is valid in the strong scattering, but still diffuse,\nregime that is realized in our sample, and is evaluated in the diffuse far\nfield limit encountered in our experiments. By comparing our theory with the\nexperimental data, we obtain an accurate measurement of the diffusion\ncoefficient of ultrasound in our sample. We find that the value of $D$ is quite\nsmall, $0.74 \\pm 0.03$ mm$^2/\\mu$s, and comment on the implications of this\nslow transport for the energy velocity.\n", "  This work presents a simple method to determine the significant partial wave\ncontributions to experimentally determined observables in pseudoscalar meson\nphotoproduction. First, fits to angular distributions are presented and the\nmaximum orbital angular momentum $\\text{L}_{\\mathrm{max}}$ needed to achieve a\ngood fit is determined. Then, recent polarization measurements for $\\gamma p\n\\rightarrow \\pi^{0} p$ from ELSA, GRAAL, JLab and MAMI are investigated\naccording to the proposed method. This method allows us to project high-spin\npartial wave contributions to any observable as long as the measurement has the\nnecessary statistical accuracy. We show, that high precision and large angular\ncoverage in the polarization data are needed in order to be sensitive to\nhigh-spin resonance-states and thereby also for the finding of small resonance\ncontributions. This task can be achieved via interference of these resonances\nwith the well-known states. For the channel $\\gamma p \\rightarrow \\pi^{0} p$,\nthose are the $N(1680)\\frac{5}{2}^{+}$ and $\\Delta(1950)\\frac{7}{2}^{+}$,\ncontributing to the $F$-waves.\n", "  We introduce the minimal maximally predictive models ({\\epsilon}-machines) of\nprocesses generated by certain hidden semi-Markov models. Their causal states\nare either hybrid discrete-continuous or continuous random variables and\ncausal-state transitions are described by partial differential equations.\nClosed-form expressions are given for statistical complexities, excess\nentropies, and differential information anatomy rates. We present a complete\nanalysis of the {\\epsilon}-machines of continuous-time renewal processes and,\nthen, extend this to processes generated by unifilar hidden semi-Markov models\nand semi-Markov models. Our information-theoretic analysis leads to new\nexpressions for the entropy rate and the rates of related information measures\nfor these very general continuous-time process classes.\n", "  In condensed matter physics, one of the major topics is to find out and\nclassify interesting novel topological matters and phenomena. Topologically\nnontrivial systems can also be achieved by using periodical driving fields. On\nthe other hand, ratchet effect can be used to collect useful work from\nfluctuations or realize directed transport in periodically-driven systems.\nHere, we promote a dimer chain by applying two mutually-perpendicular ac\nelectric fields, and obtain an effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian in the\nlow-frequency regime. We thereby derive quantum Floquet anomalous Hall (QFAH)\nconductance and then find a quantized ratchet effect in the resulting current\nalong the chain. Our further analysis shows that these originate from the\nelectric fields only. This lengthwise quantized ratchet effect without magnetic\nfield should be useful to designing novel high-performance electronic\napplications.\n", "  The quark degrees of freedom of the QGP with special focus on mass effects\nare investigated. A next-to-leading-order perturbation theory approach with\nquark mass dependence is applied and compared to lattice QCD results.\n", "  We study the three-dimensional, incompressible, non-hydrostatic Boussinesq\nfluid equations, which are applicable to the dynamics of the oceans and\natmosphere. These equations describe the interplay between velocity and\nbuoyancy in a rotating frame. A hierarchy of dynamical variables is introduced\nwhose members $\\Omega_{m}(t)$ ($1 \\leq m < \\infty$) are made up from the\nrespective sum of the $L^{2m}$-norms of vorticity and the density gradient.\nEach $\\Omega_{m}(t)$ has a lower bound in terms of the inverse Rossby number,\n$Ro^{-1}$, that turns out to be crucial to the argument. For convenience, the\n$\\Omega_{m}$ are also scaled into a new set of variables $D_{m}(t)$. By\nassuming the existence and uniqueness of solutions, conditional upper bounds\nare found on the $D_{m}(t)$ in terms of $Ro^{-1}$ and the Reynolds number $Re$.\nThese upper bounds vary across bands in the $\\{D_{1},\\,D_{m}\\}$ phase plane.\nThe boundaries of these bands depend subtly upon $Ro^{-1}$, $Re$, and the\ninverse Froude number $Fr^{-1}$. For example, solutions in the lower band\nconditionally live in an absorbing ball in which the maximum value of\n$\\Omega_{1}$ deviates from $Re^{3/4}$ as a function of $Ro^{-1},\\,Re$ and\n$Fr^{-1}$.\n", "  Fractional Brownian motion, H-FBM , of index 0<H<1 is considered as initial\nvelocity in the inviscid Burgers equation. It is shown that the Hausdorff\ndimension of regular Lagrangian points at any moment t is equal to H. This fact\nvalidates the Sinai-Frisch conjecture known since 1992.\n", "  sPHENIX is a new collaboration and future detector project at Brookhaven\nNational Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). It seeks to\nanswer fundamental questions on the nature of the quark gluon plasma (QGP),\nincluding its temperature dependence and coupling strength, by using a suite of\nprecision jet and upsilon measurements that probe different length scales of\nthe QGP. This will be achieved with large acceptance, $|\\eta| < 1$ and\n$0$-$2\\pi$ in $\\phi$, electromagentic and hadronic calorimeters and precision\ntracking enabled by a $1.5$ T superconducting magnet. With the increased\nluminosity afforded by accelerator upgrades, sPHENIX will perform high\nstatistics measurements extending the kinematic reach at RHIC to overlap the\nLHC's. This overlap with the LHC will facilitate better understanding of the\nrole of temperature, density and parton virtuality in QGP dynamics and for jet\nquenching in particular. This talk will focus on key future measurements and\nthe current state of the sPHENIX project.\n", "  Transparent scalar and pseudoscalar potentials in the one-dimensional Dirac\nequation play an important role as self-consistent mean fields in 1+1\ndimensional four-fermion theories (Gross-Neveu, Nambu-Jona Lasinio models) and\nquasi-one dimensional superconductors (Bogoliubov-De Gennes equation). Here, we\nshow that they also serve as seed to generate a large class of classical\nmulti-soliton and multi-breather solutions of su(N) affine Toda field theories,\nincluding the Lax representation and the corresponding vector. This generalizes\nprevious findings about the relationship between real kinks in the Gross-Neveu\nmodel and classical solitons of the sinh-Gordon equation to complex twisted\nkinks.\n", "  We demonstrate a common origin for high-scale leptogenesis and three-loop\nneutrino mass generation. Specifically we extend the standard model by two real\nsinglet scalars, two singly charged scalars carrying different lepton numbers\nand two or more singlet fermions with Majorana masses. Our model respects a\nsoftly broken lepton number and an exactly conserved $Z_2^{}$ discrete\nsymmetry. Through the lepton-number-violating decays of the real scalars and\nthen the lepton-number-conserving decays of the charged scalars, we can obtain\na lepton asymmetry stored in the standard model leptons. This lepton asymmetry\ncan be partially converted to a baryon asymmetry by the sphaleron processes.\nThe interactions for this leptogenesis can also result in a three-loop diagram\nto generate the neutrino masses. The lightest singlet fermion can keep stable\nto serve as a dark matter particle.\n", "  The observed radii of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries exceed predicted radii\nby ~ 5%. To investigate this anomaly, the structure of low-mass stars\nirradiated by a close companion is considered. Irradiation modifies the surface\nboundary conditions and thereby also the adiabatic constants of their outer\nconvection zones. This changes the models' radii and luminosities. For\nshort-period M dwarf binaries with components of similar mass, radius inflation\ndue to their mutual irradiation is found to be < 0.4%. This is an order of\nmagnitude too small to explain the observed anomaly. Although stronger\nirradiation results in a monotonically increasing radius, a saturation effect\nlimits the inflation to <~ 5\\%.\n", "  The emerging field of valleytronics aims to exploit the valley pseudospin of\nelectrons residing near Bloch band extrema as an information carrier. Recent\nexperiments demonstrating optical generation and manipulation of exciton valley\ncoherence (the superposition of electron-hole pairs at opposite valleys) in\nmonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a critical step\ntowards control of this quantum degree of freedom. The charged exciton (trion)\nin TMDs is an intriguing alternative to the neutral exciton for control of\nvalley pseudospin because of its long spontaneous recombination lifetime, its\nrobust valley polarization, and its coupling to residual electronic spin. Trion\nvalley coherence has however been unexplored due to experimental challenges in\naccessing it spectroscopically. In this work, we employ ultrafast\ntwo-dimensional coherent spectroscopy to resonantly generate and detect trion\nvalley coherence in monolayer MoSe$_2$ demonstrating that it persists for a\nfew-hundred femtoseconds. We conclude that the underlying mechanisms limiting\ntrion valley coherence are fundamentally different from those applicable to\nexciton valley coherence. Based on these observations, we suggest possible\nstrategies for extending valley coherence times in two-dimensional materials.\n", "  This note presents an analysis of lepton-flavour-violating muon decays within\nthe framework of a low-energy effective field theory that contains\nhigher-dimensional operators allowed by QED and QCD symmetries. The decay modes\n$\\mu\\to e \\gamma$ and $\\mu\\to 3e$ are investigated below the electroweak\nsymmetry-breaking scale, down to energies at which such processes occur, i.e.\nthe muon mass scale. The complete class of dimension-5 and dimension-6\noperators is studied systematically at the tree level, and one-loop\ncontributions to the renormalisation group equations are fully taken into\naccount. Current experimental limits are used to extract bounds on the Wilson\ncoefficients of some of the operators and, ultimately, on the effective\ncouplings at any energy level below the electroweak symmetry-breaking scale.\nCorrelations between two couplings relevant to both processes illustrate the\ncomplementarity of searches planned for the MEG II and Mu3e experiments.\n", "  We develop a statistical method for identifying induced seismicity from large\ndatasets and apply the method to decades of wastewater disposal and seismicity\ndata in California and Oklahoma. The method is robust against a variety of\npotential pitfalls. The study regions are divided into gridblocks. We use a\nlongitudinal study design, seeking associations between seismicity and\nwastewater injection along time-series within each gridblock. The longitudinal\ndesign helps control for non-random application of wastewater injection. We\ndefine a statistical model that is flexible enough to describe the seismicity\nobservations, which have temporal correlation and high kurtosis. In each\ngridblock, we find the maximum likelihood estimate for a model parameter that\nrelates induced seismicity hazard to total volume of wastewater injected each\nyear. To assess significance, we compute likelihood ratio test statistics in\neach gridblock and each state, California and Oklahoma. Resampling is used to\nempirically derive reference distributions used to estimate p-values from the\nlikelihood ratio statistics. In Oklahoma, the analysis finds with extremely\nhigh confidence that seismicity associated with wastewater disposal (or other\nrelated activities, such as reservoir depletion) has occurred. In California,\nthe analysis finds that seismicity associated with wastewater disposal has\nprobably occurred, but the result is not strong enough to be conclusive. We\nidentify areas where temporal association between wastewater disposal and\nseismicity is apparent. Our method could be applied to other datasets, extended\nto identify risk factors that increase induced seismic hazard, or modified to\ntest alternative statistical models for natural and induced seismicity.\n", "  Frictional constitutive law for very slow vertical withdrawing of a thin rod\nfrom a granular bed is experimentally studied. Using a very precise creep\nmeter, geometry-dependent granular frictional constitutive law is particularly\nexamined. In some previous works, a dimensionless number\n$I=\\dot{\\gamma}D_g/\\sqrt{p/\\rho_g}$ has been used to characterize granular\nfrictional constitutive laws, where $\\dot{\\gamma}$, $D_g$, $p$, and $\\rho_g$\nare the shear strain rate, grain diameter, confining pressure, and bulk density\nof granular bed, respectively. It has been considered that granular frictional\nconstitutive law expressed by $I$ is universal (almost geometry-independent) in\ndense flow regime. In this study, however, we find that the geometry of the\nsystem is much more crucial to characterize granular friction in a very slow\nwithdrawing regime. Specifically, the ratio between rod and grain diameters\nmust be an essential parameter to describe the granular frictional constitutive\nlaw. Physical meaning of the geometry-dependent constitutive law is discussed\non the basis of grains-contact-number dependence of granular behavior.\n", "  We propose and test a new approach to computation of canonical partition\nfunctions in lattice QCD at finite density. We suggest a few steps procedure.\nWe first compute numerically the quark number density for imaginary chemical\npotential $i\\mu_{qI}$. Then we restore the grand canonical partition function\nfor imaginary chemical potential using fitting procedure for the quark number\ndensity. Finally we compute the canonical partition functions using high\nprecision numerical Fourier transformation. Additionally we compute the\ncanonical partition functions using known method of the hopping parameter\nexpansion and compare results obtained by two methods in the deconfining as\nwell as in the confining phases. The agreement between two methods indicates\nthe validity of the new method. Our numerical results are obtained in two\nflavor lattice QCD with clover improved Wilson fermions.\n", "  We consider the interaction of atomic hydrogen with an intense laser field\nwithin the strong-field approximation. By using a Faddeev-like formalism, we\nintroduce a new perturbative series in the binding potential of the atom. As a\nfirst test of this new approach, we calculate the electron energy spectrum in\nthe very simple case of a photon energy higher than the ionisation potential.\nWe show that by contrast to the standard perturbative series in the binding\npotential obtained within the strong field approximation, the first terms of\nthe new series converge rapidly towards the results we get by solving the\ncorresponding time-dependent Schroedinger equation.\n", "  We discuss the application of Siegel Modular Forms to Black Hole entropy\ncounting. The role of the Igusa cusp form $\\chi_{10}$ in the D1D5P system is\nwell-known, and its transformation properties are what allows precision\nmicrostate counting in this case. We apply a similar method to extract the\nFourier coefficients of other Siegel modular and paramodular forms, and we show\nthat they could serve as candidates for other types of black holes. We\ninvestigate the growth of their coefficients, identifying the dominant\ncontributions and the leading logarithmic corrections in various regimes. We\nalso discuss similarities and differences to the behavior of $\\chi_{10}$, and\npossible physical interpretations of such forms both from a microscopic and\ngravitational point of view.\n", "  We investigate numerically that a finite Airy-Gaussian (AiG) beam varies its\ntrajectory and shape in the defected photonic lattices. The propagation\nproperties and beam self-bending are controlled with modulation depth and\nperiod of the photonic lattices, positive and negative defects, beam\ndistribution factor and nonlinearity change. For positive defects, the\npseudo-period oscillation and localization of the AiG beam may be formed under\na certain condition, while the beam is diffused for negative defects. Moreover,\nthe solitons may appear during the propagation process when the self-focusing\nnonlinearity is introduced.\n", "  Future experiments such as SHiP and high-intensity $e^+ e^-$ colliders will\nhave a superb sensitivity to heavy Majorana neutrinos with masses below $M_Z$.\nWe show that the measurement of the mixing to electrons and muons of one such\nstate could imply the discovery of leptonic CP violation in the context of\nseesaw models. We quantify in the minimal model the CP discovery potential of\nthese future experiments, and demonstrate that a 5$\\sigma$ CL discovery of\nleptonic CP violation would be possible in a very significant fraction of\nparameter space.\n", "  An introductory overview of electromagnetic probes in ultra-relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions is provided. Experimental evidence supporting the\nproduction of thermal photons and dileptons in heavy-ion collisions at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are\nreviewed. Thermal electromagnetic emission evaluated from hydrodynamical models\nof collisions is discussed.\n", "  Ballistic electrons in solids can have mean free paths far larger than the\nsmallest features patterned by lithography. This has allowed development and\nstudy of solid-state electron-optical devices such as beam splitters and\nquantum point contacts, which have informed our understanding of electron flow\nand interactions. Recently, high-mobility graphene has emerged as an ideal\ntwo-dimensional semimetal that hosts unique chiral electron-optical effects due\nto its honeycomb crystalline lattice. However, this chiral transport prevents\nsimple use of electrostatic gates to define electron-optical devices in\ngraphene. Here, we present a method of creating highly-collimated electron\nbeams in graphene based on collinear pairs of slits, with absorptive sidewalls\nbetween the slits. By this method, we achieve beams with angular width 18\ndegrees or narrower, and transmission matching semiclassical predictions.\n", "  Optical fibers confine and guide light almost unattenuated and thus convey\nlight forces to polarizable nano-particles over very long distances. Radiation\npressure forces arise from scattering of guided photons into free space while\ngradient forces are based on coherent scattering between different fiber modes\nor propagation directions. Interestingly, even scattering between\nco-propagating modes induces longitudinal forces as the transverse confinement\nof the light modes creates mode dependent longitudinal wave-vectors and photon\nmomenta. We generalize a proven scattering matrix based approach to calculate\nsingle as well as inter-particle forces to include several forward and backward\npropagating modes. We show that an injection of the higher order mode only in a\ntwo mode fiber will induce a stationary tractor force against the injection\ndirection, when the mode coupling to the lower order mode dominates against\nbackscattering and free space losses. Generically this arises for non-absorbing\nparticles at the center of a waveguide. The model also gives improved\npredictions for inter-particle forces in evanescent nanofiber fields as\nexperimentally observed recently. Surprisingly strong tractor forces can also\nact on whole optically bound arrays.\n", "  The dynamics of autoionizing Rydberg states of oxygen are studied using\nattosecond transient absorption technique, where extreme ultraviolet (XUV)\ninitiates molecular polarization and near infrared (NIR) pulse perturbs its\nevolution. Transient absorption spectra show positive optical density (OD)\nchange in the case of $ns\\sigma_g$ and $nd\\pi_g$ autoionizing states of oxygen\nand negative OD change for $nd\\sigma_g$ states. Multiconfiguration\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) calculation are used to simulate the\ntransient absorption spectra and their results agree with experimental\nobservations. The time evolution of superexcited states is probed in\nelectronically and vibrationally resolved fashion and we observe the dependence\nof decay lifetimes on effective quantum number of the Rydberg series. We model\nthe effect of near-infrared (NIR) perturbation on molecular polarization and\nfind that the laser induced phase shift model agrees with the experimental and\nMCTDHF results, while the laser induced attenuation model does not. We relate\nthe electron state symmetry dependent sign of the OD change to the Fano\nparameters of the static absorption lineshapes.\n", "  Milky Way-like galaxies are predicted to host a very large number of dark\nmatter subhalos. Some massive and nearby subhalos could generate detectable\ngamma-rays, appearing as unidentified, spatially-extended and stable gamma-ray\nsources. We search for such sources in the third Fermi Large Area Telescope\nsource List (3FGL) and report the identification of a new candidate, 3FGL\nJ1924.8-1034. With the Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data, we find that 3FGL J1924.8-1034 is\nspatially-extended at a high confidence level of $5.4\\sigma$, with a best-fit\nextension radius of $\\sim0.15^{\\circ}$. No significant variability has been\nfound and its gamma-ray spectrum is well fitted by the dark matter annihilation\ninto $b\\bar{b}$ with a mass of $\\sim 43$ GeV. All these facts make 3FGL\nJ1924.8-1034 a possible dark matter subhalo candidate. However, due to the\nlimited angular resolution, the possibility of that the spatial extension of\n3FGL J1924.8-1034 is caused by the contamination from the other un-resolved\npoint source can not be ruled out.\n", "  Violated mirror symmetry (MS) is capable of reproducing observed qualitative\nproperties of weak mixing for quarks and leptons. In violated MS, lepton\nphenomenology, that is, small neutrino masses and mixing properties different\nfrom those of quarks, requires the Dirac nature of neutrinos and existence of\nprocesses that change the total lepton number. Such processes involve heavy\nmirror neutrinos, and therefore occur at very high energies. CP\nnon-conservation would mean here that the parity conserving MS Lagrangian must\nbe non-invariant to both time reversal T and (according to the CPT theorem) the\ncharge conjugation C. All these properties create appropriate conditions for\nleptogenesis, a mechanism for generating baryon-lepton asymmetry of the\nUniverse in violated MS models.\n", "  The uniform electron gas is a key model system in the description of matter,\nincluding dense plasmas and solid state systems. However, the simultaneous\noccurence of quantum, correlation, and thermal effects makes the theoretical\ndescription challenging. For these reasons, over the last half century many\nanalytical approaches have been developed the accuracy of which has remained\nunclear. We have recently obtained the first \\textit{ab initio} data for the\nexchange correlation free energy of the uniform electron gas [T. Dornheim\n\\textit{et al.}, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\\textbf{117}, 156403 (2016)] which now\nprovides the opportunity to assess the quality of the mentioned approaches and\nparametrizations. Particular emphasis is put on the warm dense matter regime,\nwhere we find significant discrepancies between the different approaches.\n", "  The ultimate precision of any measurement of the temperature of a quantum\nsystem is the inverse of the local quantum thermal susceptibility [De Pasquale\net al., Nature Communications 7, 12782 (2016)] of the subsystem with whom the\nthermometer interacts. If this subsystem can be described with the canonical\nensemble, such quantity reduces to the variance of the local Hamiltonian, that\nis proportional to the heat capacity of the subsystem. However, the canonical\nensemble might not apply in the presence of interactions between the subsystem\nand the rest of the system. In this work we address this problem in the\nframework of locally interacting quantum systems. We prove that the local\nquantum thermal susceptibility of any subsystem is close to the variance of its\nlocal Hamiltonian, provided the volume to surface ratio of the subsystem is\nmuch larger than the correlation length. This result greatly simplifies the\ndetermination of the ultimate precision of any local estimate of the\ntemperature, and rigorously determines the regime where interactions can affect\nthis precision.\n", "  We generalize the Pastawski-Yoshida-Harlow-Preskill (HaPPY) holographic\nquantum error-correcting code to provide a toy model for bulk gauge fields or\nlinearized gravitons. The key new elements are the introduction of degrees of\nfreedom on the links (edges) of the associated tensor network and their\nconnection to further copies of the HaPPY code by an appropriate isometry. The\nresult is a model in which boundary regions allow the reconstruction of bulk\nalgebras with central elements living on the interior edges of the (greedy)\nentanglement wedge, and where these central elements can also be reconstructed\nfrom complementary boundary regions. In addition, the entropy of boundary\nregions receives both Ryu-Takayanagi-like contributions and further corrections\nthat model the $\\frac{\\delta \\text{Area}}{4G_N}$ term of Faulkner, Lewkowycz,\nand Maldacena. Comparison with Yang-Mills theory then suggests that this\n$\\frac{\\delta \\text{Area}}{4G_N}$ term can be reinterpreted as a part of the\nbulk entropy of gravitons under an appropriate extension of the physical bulk\nHilbert space.\n", "  Determining the average fraction of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons escaping\nhigh redshift galaxies is essential for understanding how reionization\nproceeded in the z>6 Universe. We want to measure the LyC signal from a sample\nof sources in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and COSMOS fields for which\nultra-deep VIMOS spectroscopy as well as multi-wavelength Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) imaging are available.\n  We select a sample of 46 galaxies at $z\\sim 4$ from the VIMOS Ultra Deep\nSurvey (VUDS) database, such that the VUDS spectra contain the LyC part of the\nspectra, that is, the rest-frame range $880-910\\AA$. Taking advantage of the\nHST imaging, we apply a careful cleaning procedure and reject all the sources\nshowing nearby clumps with different colours, that could potentially be\nlower-redshift interlopers. After this procedure, the sample is reduced to 33\ngalaxies. We measure the ratio between ionizing flux (LyC at $895\\AA$) and\nnon-ionizing emission (at $\\sim 1500 \\AA$) for all individual sources. We also\nproduce a normalized stacked spectrum of all sources. Assuming an intrinsic\naverage $L_{\\nu}(1470)/L_{\\nu}(895)$ of 3, we estimate the individual and\naverage relative escape fraction. We do not detect ionizing radiation from any\nindividual source, although we identify a possible LyC emitter with very high\nLy$\\alpha$ equivalent width (EW). From the stacked spectrum and assuming a mean\ntransmissivity for the sample, we measure a relative escape fraction\n$f_{esc}^{rel}=0.09\\pm0.04$. We also look for correlations between the limits\nin the LyC flux and source properties and find a tentative correlation between\nLyC flux and the EW of the Ly$\\alpha$ emission line.\n  Our results imply that the LyC flux emitted by $V=25-26$ star-forming\ngalaxies at z$\\sim$4 is at most very modest, in agreement with previous upper\nlimits from studies based on broad and narrow band imaging.\n", "  Single-field slow-roll inflation predicts a nearly scale-free power spectrum\nof perturbations, as observed at the scales accessible to current cosmological\nexperiments. This spectrum is slightly red, showing a tilt $(1-n_s)\\sim 0.04$.\nA direct consequence of this tilt are nonvanishing runnings $\\alpha_s=\\mathrm d\nn_s/\\mathrm d\\log k$, and $\\beta_s=\\mathrm d\\alpha_s/\\mathrm d\\log k$, which in\nthe minimal inflationary scenario should reach absolute values of $10^{-3}$ and\n$10^{-5}$, respectively. In this work we calculate how well future surveys can\nmeasure these two runnings. We consider a Stage-4 (S4) CMB experiment and show\nthat it will be able to detect significant deviations from the inflationary\nprediction for $\\alpha_s$, although not for $\\beta_s$. Adding to the S4 CMB\nexperiment the information from a WFIRST-like or a DESI-like survey improves\nthe sensitivity to the runnings by $\\sim$ 20\\%, and 30\\%, respectively. A\nspectroscopic survey with a billion objects, such as the SKA, will add enough\ninformation to the S4 measurements to allow a detection of $\\alpha_s=10^{-3}$,\nrequired to probe the single-field slow-roll inflationary paradigm. We show\nthat only a very-futuristic interferometer targeting the dark ages will be\ncapable of measuring the minimal inflationary prediction for $\\beta_s$. The\nresults of other probes, such as a stochastic background of gravitational waves\nobservable by LIGO, the Ly-$\\alpha$ forest, and spectral distortions, are shown\nfor comparison. Finally, we study the claims that large values of $\\beta_s$, if\nextrapolated to the smallest scales, can produce primordial black holes of tens\nof solar masses, which we show to be easily testable by the S4 CMB experiment.\n", "  We report an experimental verification of conformal mapping with kitchen\naluminum foil. This experiment can be reproduced in any laboratory by\nundergraduate students and it is therefore an ideal experiment to introduce the\nconcept of conformal mapping. The original problem was the distribution of the\nelectric potential in a very long plate. The correct theoretical prediction was\nrecently derived by A. Czarnecki (Can. J. Phys. 92, 1297 (2014)).\n", "  A modeling of metasurfaces in the finite element method (FEM) based on\ngeneralized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) is presented. The\ndiscontinuities in electromagnetic fields across a metasurface as represented\nby the GSTC are modeled by assigning nodes to both sides of the metasurface.\nThe FEM-GSTC formulation in both 1D and 2D domains is derived and implemented.\nThe method is extended to handle more general bianistroptic metasurfaces. The\nformulations are validated by several illustrative examples.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the conserved charges of generally\ndiffeomorphism invariant gravity theories with a wide variety of matter fields,\nparticularly of the theories with multiple scalar fields and $p$-form\npotentials, in the context of the off-shell generalized Abbott-Deser-Tekin\n(ADT) formalism. We first construct a new off-shell ADT current that consists\nof the terms for the variation of a Killing vector and expressions of the field\nequations as well as the Lie derivative of a surface term with respect to the\nKilling vector within the framework of generally diffeomorphism invariant\ngravity theories involving various matter fields. After deriving the off-shell\nADT potential corresponding to this current, we propose a formula of conserved\ncharges for these theories. Next, we derive the off-shell ADT potential\nassociated with the generic Lagrangian that describes a large range of gravity\ntheories with a number of scalar fields and $p$-form potentials. Finally, the\nproperties of the off-shell generalized ADT charges for the theory of Einstein\ngravity and the gravity theories with a single $p$-form potential are\ninvestigated by performing Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction along a\ncompactified direction. The results indicate that the charge contributed by all\nthe fields in the lower-dimensional theory is equal to that of the\nhigher-dimensional one at mathematical level with the hypothesis that the\nhigher-dimensional spacetime allows for the existence of the compactified\ndimension. In order to illustrate our calculations, the mass and angular\nmomentum for the five-dimensional rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes are\nexplicitly evaluated as an example.\n", "  We study the structural similarity of earthquake networks constructed from\nseismic catalogs of different geographical regions. A hierarchical clustering\nof underlying undirected earthquake networks is shown using Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence in graph spectra. The directed nature of links indicates that each\nearthquake network is strongly connected, which motivates us to study the\ndirected version statistically. Our statistical analysis of each earthquake\nregion identifies the hub regions. We calculate the conditional probability of\nthe forthcoming occurrences of earthquakes in each region. The conditional\nprobability of each event has been compared with their stationary distribution.\n", "  Spatial quantum correlations in the transverse degree of freedom promise to\nenhance optical resolution, image detection, and quantum communications through\nparallel quantum information encoding. In particular, the ability to observe\nthese spatial quantum correlations in a single shot will enable such\nenhancements in applications that require real time imaging, such as particle\ntracking and in-situ imaging of atomic systems. Here, we report on measurements\nin the far-field that show spatial quantum correlations in single images of\nbright twin-beams with $10^8$ photons in a 1~$\\mu$s pulse using an\nelectron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera. A four-wave mixing process\nin hot rubidium atoms is used to generate narrowband-bright pulsed twin-beams\nof light. Owing to momentum conservation in this process, the twin-beams are\nmomentum correlated, which leads to spatial quantum correlations in the far\nfield. We show around 2~dB of spatial quantum noise reduction with respect to\nthe shot noise limit. The spatial squeezing is present over a large range of\ntotal number of photons in the pulsed twin-beams.\n", "  [Abridged] We use the final data of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift\nSurvey (VIPERS) to investigate the effect of environment on the evolution of\ngalaxies between $z=0.5$ and $z=0.9$. We characterise local environment in\nterms of the density contrast smoothed over a cylindrical kernel, the scale of\nwhich is defined by the distance to the $5^{th}$ nearest neighbour. We find\nthat more massive galaxies tend to reside in higher-density environments over\nthe full redshift range explored. Defining star-forming and passive galaxies\nthrough their (NUV$-r$) vs ($r-K$) colours, we then quantify the fraction of\nstar-forming over passive galaxies, $f_{\\rm ap}$, as a function of environment\nat fixed stellar mass. $f_{\\rm ap}$ is higher in low-density regions for\ngalaxies with masses ranging from $\\log(\\mathcal{M}/\\mathcal{M}_\\odot)=10.38$\n(the lowest value explored) to at least\n$\\log(\\mathcal{M}/\\mathcal{M}_\\odot)\\sim11.3$, although with decreasing\nsignificance going from lower to higher masses. This is the first time that\nenvironmental effects on high-mass galaxies are clearly detected at redshifts\nas high as $z\\sim0.9$. We compared these results to VIPERS-like galaxy mock\ncatalogues based on the galaxy formation model of De Lucia & Blaizot. The model\ncorrectly reproduces $f_{\\rm ap}$ in low-density environments, but\nunderpredicts it at high densities. The discrepancy is particularly strong for\nthe lowest-mass bins. We find that this discrepancy is driven by an excess of\nlow-mass passive satellite galaxies in the model. Looking at the accretion\nhistory of these model galaxies, i.e. the times when they become satellites, a\nbetter (yet not perfect) agreement with observations can be obtained in high\ndensity regions by assuming either that a not-negligible fraction of satellites\nis destroyed, or that their quenching time-scale is longer than $\\sim 2$ Gyr.\n", "  The quantum of heat conductance of ballistic one-dimensional (1D) channels,\nbeing gQ=k0T with k0=pi^2*2kB^2/3h (T - temperature, kB - Boltzmann's constant,\nh - Planck's constant), is an important fundamental constant. While the\nquantization of the electrical conductance of 1D ballistic conductors has long\nbeen experimentally established, a demonstration of the quantization of thermal\nconductance proved to be much harder. It has already been accomplished for\nweakly interacting systems of phonons, photons, and electronic Fermi-liquids.\nTheoretically, however, the quantization must also hold in strongly interacting\nsystems, such as the Fractional Quantum Hall effect (FQHE), where electrons\nfractionalize into anyons and chargeless quasiparticles such as neutral\nMajorana fermions. Since the bulk in the FQHE is incompressible, it is not\nexpected to contribute significantly to the heat conductance, which is\ndetermined by chiral 1D edge modes. The thermal conductance reflects\ntopological properties of the FQH electronic systems to which the electrical\nconductance gives no access. Here, we present results of extensive measurements\nof the heat conductance in 'particle-like' (Laughlin's) and 'hole-like'\nfractional states. We verify the universal value of the quantum of thermal\nconductance of the charged fractional modes as well as for chargeless neutral\nmodes. We also prove the validity of the theoretical predictions for the more\ncomplex (and less studied) 'hole-like' states. Heat transport measurements open\na door to ample information, not easily accessible by conductance measurements.\n", "  This work presents transport coefficients of electrons (bulk drift velocity,\nlongitudinal diffusion coefficient, and effective ionization frequency) in CO2\nmeasured under time-of-flight conditions over a wide range of the reduced\nelectric field, 15Td <= E/N <= 2660Td in a scanning drift tube apparatus. The\ndata obtained in the experiments are also applied to determine the effective\nsteady-state Townsend ionization coefficient. These parameters are compared to\nthe results of previous experimental studies, as well as to results of various\nkinetic computations: solutions of the electron Boltzmann equation under\ndifferent approximations (multiterm and density gradient expansions) and Monte\nCarlo simulations. The experimental data extend the range of E/N compared with\nprevious measurements and are consistent with most of the transport parameters\nobtained in these earlier studies. The computational results point out the\nrange of applicability of the respective approaches to determine the different\nmeasured transport properties of electrons in CO2. They demonstrate as well the\nneed for further improvement of the electron collision cross section data for\nCO2 taking into account the present experimental data.\n", "  We classify line nodes in superconductors with strong spin-orbit interactions\nand time-reversal symmetry, where the latter may include non-primitive\ntranslations in the magnetic Brillouin zone to account for coexistence with\nantiferromagnetic order. We find four possible combinations of irreducible\nrepresentations of the order parameter on high symmetry planes, two of which\nallow for line nodes in pseudo-spin triplet pairs and two that exclude\nconventional fully gapped pseudo-spin singlet pairs. We show that the former\ncan only be realized in the presence of band-sticking degeneracies, and verify\ntheir topological stability using arguments based on Clifford algebra\nextensions. Our classification exhausts all possible symmetry protected line\nnodes in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and a (generalized) time-reversal\nsymmetry. Implications for existing non-symmorphic and antiferromagnetic\nsuperconductors are discussed.\n", "  We experimentally observe the decay dynamics of deterministically created\nisolated monopoles in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates. As the condensate\nundergoes a change between magnetic phases, the isolated monopole gradually\nevolves into a spin configuration hosting a Dirac monopole in its synthetic\nmagnetic field. We characterize in detail the Dirac monopole by measuring the\nparticle densities of the spin states projected along different quantization\naxes. Importantly, we observe the spontaneous emergence of nodal lines in the\ncondensate density that accompany the Dirac monopole. We also demonstrate that\nthe monopole decay accelerates in weaker magnetic field gradients.\n", "  Electron and phonon spectra dynamics, as well as features of structural\ntransitions and melting of sodium under pressure within range 0 to 100 GPa are\ninvestigated. Electron and phonon spectra of crystal sodium are calculated ab\ninitio within the density functional theory by means of the LMTART-7 software\npackage (Savrasov-Savrasov: 1992; Savrasov: 1996; Savrasov: 2004), allowing the\nfully potential method of linear muffin-tin orbitals. Using the Lindemann\nmeasure and the calculated phonon spectra the theoretical values of melting\npoints corresponding to the experimental data (Gregoryanz, et al: 2005;\nGregoryanz, et al: 2008) are obtained. Features of electron and phonon spectra\ndynamics in the melting curve maximum vicinity and within cI2->cI4 structural\ntransition range are discussed.\n", "  Although nanolasers typically have low Q-factors and high lasing thresholds,\nthey have been successfully implemented with various gain media. Intuitively,\nit seems that an increase in the gain coefficient would improve the\ncharacteristics of nanolasers. For a plasmonic nanolaser, in particular, a\ndistributed-feed-back (DFB) laser, we propose a self-consistent model that\ntakes into account both spontaneous emission and the multimode character of\nlaser generation to show that for a given pumping strength, the gain\ncoefficient has an optimal value at which the radiation intensity is at a\nmaximum and the radiation linewidth is at a minimum.\n", "  We compare, in an extensive and systematic way, linear theory results\nobtained with the hybrid (ion-kinetic and electron-fluid), the gyrokinetic and\nthe fully-kinetic plasma models. We present a test case with parameters that\nare relevant for solar wind turbulence at small scales, which is a topic now\nrecognized to need a kinetic treatment, to a certain extent. We comment on the\ncomparison of low-frequency single modes (Alfv\\'{e}n/ion-cyclotron,\nion-acoustic, and fast modes) for a wide range of propagation angles, and on\nthe overall spectral properties of the linear operators, for\nquasi-perpendicular propagation. The methodology and the results presented in\nthis paper will be valuable when choosing which model should be used in regimes\nwhere the assumptions of each model are not trivially satisfied.\n", "  We derive the 1-loop effective action of the cubic Galileon coupled to\nquantum-gravitational fluctuations in a background and gauge-independent\nmanner, employing the covariant framework of DeWitt and Vilkovisky. Although\nthe bare action respects shift symmetry, the coupling to gravity induces an\neffective mass to the scalar, of the order of the cosmological constant, as a\ndirect result of the non-flat field-space metric, the latter ensuring the\nfield-reparametrization invariance of the formalism. Within a gauge-invariant\nregularization scheme, we discover novel, gravitationally induced non-Galileon\nhigher-derivative interactions in the effective action. These terms, previously\nunnoticed within standard, non-covariant frameworks, are not Planck suppressed.\nUnless tuned to be sub-dominant, their presence could have important\nimplications for the classical and quantum phenomenology of the theory.\n", "  We theoretically study high-harmonic generation (HHG) from solids driven by\nintense laser pulses using a one-dimensional model periodic crystal. By\nnumerically solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation directly on a\nreal-space grid, we successfully reproduce experimentally observed unique\nfeatures of solid-state HHG such as the linear cutoff-energy scaling and the\nsudden transition from a single- to multiple-plateau structure. Based on the\nsimulation results, we propose a simple model that incorporates\nvector-potential-induced intraband displacement, interband tunneling, and\nrecombination with the valence-band hole. One key parameter is the\nvalley-to-peak amplitude of the pulse vector potential, which determines the\ncrystal momentum displacement during the half cycle. When the maximum\npeak-to-valley amplitude $A_{\\rm peak}$ reaches the half width $\\frac{\\pi}{a}$\nof the Brillouin zone with $a$ being the lattice constant, the HHG spectrum\nexhibits a transition from a single- to multiple-plateau structure, and even\nfurther plateaus appear at $A_{\\rm peak} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}, \\frac{3\\pi}{a},\n\\cdots$. The multiple cutoff positions are given as functions of $A_{\\rm peak}$\nand the second maximum $A_{\\rm peak}^{\\prime}$, in terms of the energy\ndifference between different bands. Using our recipe, one can draw electron\ntrajectories in the momentum space, from which one can deduce, for example, the\ntime-frequency structure of HHG without elaborate quantum-mechanical\ncalculations. Finally, we reveal that the cutoff positions depend on not only\nthe intensity and wavelength of the pulse, but also its duration, in marked\ncontrast to the gas-phase case. Our model can be viewed as a solid-state and\nmomentum-space counterpart of the familiar three-step model, highly successful\nfor gas-phase HHG, and provide a unified basis to understand HHG from\nsolid-state materials and gaseous media.\n", "  Atom probe tomography is routinely used for the characterisation of materials\nmicrostructures usually assuming that the microstructure is unaltered by the\nanalysis. When analysing ionic conductors, however, gradients in the chemical\npotential and the electric field penetrating dielectric atom probe specimens\ncan cause significant ionic mobility. While ionic mobility is undesired when\naiming for materials characterisation it offers a strategy to manipulate\nmaterials directly in-situ in the atom probe. Here, we present experimental\nresults on the analysis of the ionic conductor Lithium-Manganese-Oxide with\ndifferent atom probe techniques. We demonstrate that at a temperature of 30K\ncharacterisation of the materials microstructure is possible without measurable\nLi mobility. Contrary, we show that at 298K the material can be deintercalated\nin-situ in the atom probe without changing the Manganese-Oxide host structure.\nCombining in-situ atom probe deintercalation and subsequent conventional\ncharacterisation we demonstrate a new methodological approach to study ionic\nconductors even in early stages of deintercalation.\n", "  Generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) was proposed recently as a formulation of\nhydrodynamics for integrable systems, taking into account infinitely-many\nconservation laws. In this note we further develop the theory in various\ndirections. By extending GHD to all commuting flows of the integrable model, we\nprovide a full description of how to take into account weakly varying force\nfields, temperature fields and other inhomogeneous external fields within GHD.\nWe expect this can be used, for instance, to characterize the non-equilibrium\ndynamics of one-dimensional Bose gases in trap potentials. We further show how\nthe equations of state at the core of GHD follow from the continuity relation\nfor entropy, and we show how to recover Euler-like equations and discuss\npossible viscosity terms.\n", "  The kinetics of the sorption and the subsequent desorption of 4He by the\nstarting graphite oxide (GtO) and the thermally reduced graphene oxide samples\n(TRGO, Treduction = 200, 300, 500, 700 and 900 C) have been investigated in the\ntemperature interval 1.5 - 20 K. The effect of the annealing temperature on the\nstructural characteristics of the samples was examined by the X-ray diffraction\n(XRD) technique. On lowering the temperature from 20 K to 11-12 K, the time of\n4He sorption increased for all the samples, which is typically observed under\nthe condition of thermally activated diffusion. Below 5 K the characteristic\ntimes of 4He sorption by the GtO and TRGO-200 samples were only weakly\ndependent on temperature, suggesting the dominance of the tunnel mechanism. In\nthe same region (T<5 K) the characteristic times of the TRGOs reduced at higher\ntemperatures (300, 500, 700 and 900 C) were growing with lowering temperature,\npresumably due to the defects generated in the carbon planes on removing the\noxygen functional groups (oFGs). The estimates of the activation energy (Ea) of\n4He diffusion show that in the TRGO-200 sample the Ea value is 2.9 times lower\nas compared to the parent GtO, which is accounted for by GtO exfoliation due to\nevaporation of the water intercalated in the interlayer space of carbon. The\nnonmonotonic dependences Ea vs T for the GtO samples treated above 200 C are\ndetermined by a competition between two processes - the recovery of the\ngraphite carbon structure, which increases the activation energy, and the\ngeneration of defects, which decreases the activation energy by opening\nadditional surface areas and ways for sorption. The dependence of the\nactivation energy on treatment temperature correlates well with the contents of\nthe crystalline phase in GtO varying with a rise of the annealing temperature.\n", "  The Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) regime for proton acceleration\nby laser pulses is experimentally consolidated and fairly well understood.\nHowever, uncertainties remain in the analysis of particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulation results.\n  The energy spectrum is exponential with a cut-off, but the maximum energy\ndepends on the simulation time, following different laws in two and three\ndimensional (2D, 3D) PIC simulations, so that the determination of an\nasymptotic value has some arbitrariness.\n  We propose two empirical laws for rise time of the cut-off energy in 2D and\n3D PIC simulations, suggested by a model in which the proton acceleration is\ndue to a surface charge distribution on the target rear side. The kinetic\nenergy of the protons that we obtain follows two distinct laws, which appear to\nbe nicely satisfied by PIC simulations. The laws depend on two parameters: the\nscaling time, at which the energy starts to rise, and the asymptotic cut-off\nenergy.\n  The values of the cut-off energy, obtained by fitting the 2D and 3D\nsimulations for the same target and laser pulse, are comparable. This suggests\nthat parametric scans can be performed with 2D simulations, since 3D ones are\ncomputationally very expensive. In this paper, the simulations are carried out\nfor $a_0=3$ with the PIC code ALaDyn by changing the target thickness $L$ and\nthe incidence angle $\\alpha$. A monotonic dependence, on $L$ for normal\nincidence and on $\\alpha$ for fixed $L$, is found, as in the experimental\nresults for high temporal contrast pulses.\n", "  A unification of dark matter and dark energy in terms of a logotropic perfect\ndark fluid has recently been proposed, where deviations with respect to the\nstandard $\\Lambda {\\rm CDM}$ model are dependent on a single parameter $B$. In\nthis paper we show that the requirement that the linear growth of cosmic\nstructures on comoving scales larger than $8 h^{-1} \\, {\\rm Mpc}$ is not\nsignificantly affected with respect to the standard $\\Lambda {\\rm CDM}$ result\nprovides the strongest constraint to date on the model ($B <6 \\times 10^{-7}$),\nan improvement of more than three orders of magnitude over previous constraints\non the value of $B$. We further show that this constraint rules out the\nlogotropic Unified Dark Energy model as a possible solution to the small scale\nproblems of the $\\Lambda$CDM model, including the cusp problem of Dark Matter\nhalos or the missing satellite problem, as well as the original version of the\nmodel where the Planck energy density was taken as one of the two parameters\ncharacterizing the logotropic dark fluid.\n", "  We describe in more detail our approach to the conformal bootstrap which uses\nthe Mellin representation of $CFT_d$ four point functions and expands them in\nterms of crossing symmetric combinations of $AdS_{d+1}$ Witten exchange\nfunctions. We consider arbitrary external scalar operators and set up the\nconditions for consistency with the operator product expansion. Namely, we\ndemand cancellation of spurious powers (of the cross ratios, in position space)\nwhich translate into spurious poles in Mellin space. We discuss two contexts in\nwhich we can immediately apply this method by imposing the simplest set of\nconstraint equations. The first is the epsilon expansion. We mostly focus on\nthe Wilson-Fisher fixed point as studied in an epsilon expansion about $d=4$.\nWe reproduce Feynman diagram results for operator dimensions to $O(\\epsilon^3)$\nrather straightforwardly. This approach also yields new analytic predictions\nfor OPE coefficients to the same order which fit nicely with recent numerical\nestimates for the Ising model (at $\\epsilon =1$). We will also mention some\nleading order results for scalar theories near three and six dimensions. The\nsecond context is a large spin expansion, in any dimension, where we are able\nto reproduce and go a bit beyond some of the results recently obtained using\nthe (double) light cone expansion. We also have a preliminary discussion about\nnumerical implementation of the above bootstrap scheme in the absence of a\nsmall parameter.\n", "  We give examples of infinite order rational transformations that leave linear\ndifferential equations covariant. These examples are non-trivial yet simple\nenough illustrations of exact representations of the renormalization group. We\nfirst illustrate covariance properties on order-two linear differential\noperators associated with identities relating the same $_2F_1$ hypergeometric\nfunction with different rational pullbacks. We provide two new and more general\nresults of the previous covariance by rational functions: a new Heun function\nexample and a higher genus $_2F_1$ hypergeometric function example. We then\nfocus on identities relating the same hypergeometric function with two\ndifferent algebraic pullback transformations: such remarkable identities\ncorrespond to modular forms, the algebraic transformations being solution of\nanother differentially algebraic Schwarzian equation that emerged in a paper by\nCasale. Further, we show that the first differentially algebraic equation can\nbe seen as a subcase of the last Schwarzian differential condition, the\nrestriction corresponding to a factorization condition of some associated\norder-two linear differential operator. Finally, we also explore\ngeneralizations of these results, for instance, to $_3F_2$, hypergeometric\nfunctions, and show that one just reduces to the previous $_2F_1$ cases through\na Clausen identity.\n  In a $_2F_1$ hypergeometric framework the Schwarzian condition encapsulates\nall the modular forms and modular equations of the theory of elliptic curves,\nbut these two conditions are actually richer than elliptic curves or $_2F_1$\nhypergeometric functions, as can be seen on the Heun and higher genus example.\n  This work is a strong incentive to develop more differentially algebraic\nsymmetry analysis in physics.\n", "  Transfer matrices and matrix product operators play an ubiquitous role in the\nfield of many body physics. This paper gives an ideosyncratic overview of\napplications, exact results and computational aspects of diagonalizing transfer\nmatrices and matrix product operators. The results in this paper are a mixture\nof classic results, presented from the point of view of tensor networks, and of\nnew results. Topics discussed are exact solutions of transfer matrices in\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics, tensor network states,\nmatrix product operator algebras, and numerical matrix product state methods\nfor finding extremal eigenvectors of matrix product operators.\n", "  We investigate sub-AdS scale locality in a weakly coupled toy model of the\nAdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. We find that this simple model has the correct\ndensity of states at low and high energies to be dual to Einstein gravity\ncoupled to matter in AdS$_3$. Bulk correlation functions also have the correct\nbehavior at leading order in the large $N$ expansion, but non-local effects\nemerge at order $1/N$. Our analysis leads to the conjecture that any large $N$\nCFT$_2$ that is modular invariant and has the right low-energy density of\nstates is dual to a gravitational theory with sub-AdS scale locality.\n", "  One-dimensional CL-20 chains have been constructed using CH$_2$ molecular\nbridges for the covalent bonding between isolated CL-20 fragments. The energy\nand electronic properties of the nanostructures obtained have been analyzed by\nmeans of density functional theory and nonorthogonal tight-binding model\nconsidering Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism. It has been found that such systems\nbecome more thermodynamically stable as the efficient length of the chain\nincreases. Thus, the formation of bulk covalent CL-20 solids may be\nenergetically favorable, and such structures may possess high kinetic stability\ncomparing to the CL-20 molecular crystals. As for electronic properties of pure\nCL-20 chains, they are wide-bandgap semiconductors with energy gaps equal to\nseveral electron volts that makes their use in nanoelectronic applications\nproblematic without any additional modification.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behavior of the number of paths of length $N$ on\nseveral classes of infinite graphs with a single special vertex. This vertex\ncan work as an entropic trap for the path, i.e. under certain conditions the\ndominant part of long paths become localized in the vicinity of the special\npoint instead of spreading to infinity. We study the conditions for such\nlocalization on decorated star graphs, regular trees and regular hyperbolic\ngraphs as a function of the functionality of the special vertex. In all cases\nthe localization occurs for large enough functionality. The particular value of\ntransition point depends on the large-scale topology of the graph. The\nemergence of localization is supported by the analysis of the spectra of the\nadjacency matrices of corresponding finite graphs.\n", "  The coupled dynamics of low lying modes and various giant resonances are\nstudied with the help of the Wigner Function Moments method generalized to take\ninto account spin degrees of freedom and pair correlations simultaneously. The\nmethod is based on Time Dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations. The model\nof the harmonic oscillator including spin-orbit potential plus\nquadrupole-quadrupole and spin-spin interactions is considered. New low lying\nspin dependent modes are analyzed. Special attention is paid to the scissors\nmodes. A new source of nuclear magnetism, connected with counter-rotation of\nspins up and down around the symmetry axis (hidden angular momenta), is\ndiscovered. Its inclusion into the theory allows one to improve substantially\nthe agreement with experimental data in the description of energies and\ntransition probabilities of scissors modes.\n", "  In this work the non-equilibrium dilepton production from a hadronic\ntransport approach (SMASH) is presented. The dilepton emission from the\nhadronic stage is of interest for current HADES results measured at GSI in the\nbeam energy range from 1.25 - 3.5 GeV. Also at high collision energies\n(RHIC/LHC) the later dilute stages of the reaction are dominated by hadronic\ndynamics. The newly developed hadronic transport approach called SMASH\n(=Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is introduced\nfirst. After explaining the basic interaction mechanisms, a comparison of\nelementary cross sections for pion production to experimental data is shown.\nThe dilepton production within SMASH is explained in detail. The main\ncontribution to the dilepton spectra in the low energy regime of\nGSI/FAIR/RHIC-BES originates from resonance decays. Results of the dilepton\nproduction with SMASH such as invariant mass spectra are shown.\n", "  We conduct a detailed numerical analysis of the composite\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Higgs model based on the next-to-minimal coset\n$\\text{SO}(6)/\\text{SO}(5)\\cong\\text{SU}(4)/\\text{Sp}(4)$, featuring an\nadditional SM singlet scalar in the spectrum, which we allow to mix with the\nHiggs boson. We identify regions in parameter space compatible with all current\nexperimental constraints, including radiative electroweak symmetry breaking,\nflavour physics, and direct searches at colliders. We find the additional\nscalar, with a mass predicted to be below a TeV, to be virtually unconstrained\nby current LHC data, but potentially in reach of run 2 searches. Promising\nindirect searches include rare semi-leptonic $B$ decays, CP violation in $B_s$\nmixing, and the electric dipole moment of the neutron.\n", "  The modification of the Coulomb potential due to the enhancement of loop\ncorrections in a superstrong magnetic field is studied numerically. We\ncalculate the modified potential with high precision and obtain the pattern of\nequipotential lines. The results confirm the general features known from\nprevious studies, however we emphasize some differences in potential structure\nthat can be important for problems with spatially distributed charges.\n", "  Laser-plasma acceleration is an emerging technique for accelerating electrons\nto high energies over very short distances. The accelerated electron bunches\nhave femtosecond duration, making them particularly relevant for applications\nsuch as ultrafast imaging or femtosecond X-ray generation. Current laser-plasma\naccelerators are typically driven by Joule-class laser systems that have two\nmain drawbacks: their relatively large scale and their low repetition-rate,\nwith a few shots per second at best. The accelerated electron beams have\nenergies ranging from 100 MeV to multi-GeV, however a MeV electron source would\nbe more suited to many societal and scientific applications. Here, we\ndemonstrate a compact and reliable laser-plasma accelerator producing\nhigh-quality few-MeV electron beams at kilohertz repetition rate. This\nbreakthrough was made possible by using near-single-cycle light pulses, which\nlowered the required laser energy for driving the accelerator by three orders\nof magnitude, thus enabling high repetition-rate operation and dramatic\ndownsizing of the laser system. The measured electron bunches are collimated,\nwith an energy distribution that peaks at 5 MeV and contains up to 1 pC of\ncharge. Numerical simulations reproduce all experimental features and indicate\nthat the electron bunches are only $\\sim 1$ fs long. We anticipate that the\nadvent of these kHz femtosecond relativistic electron sources will pave the way\nto wide-impact applications, such as ultrafast electron diffraction in\nmaterials with an unprecedented sub-10 fs resolution.\n", "  Possibility of magnetic energy accumulation inside silicon nanoparticles at\nthe conditions of resonant optical responses is investigated theoretically. The\nmagnetic field distributions inside silicon nanocylinders with and without\ncoaxial through holes are calculated using full-wave numerical approach. It is\ndemonstrated that such systems can be used for control and manipulation of\noptical magnetic fields providing their enhancement up to 26 times at the\ncondition of optical resonances. Obtained results can be used for realization\nof nanoantennas and nanolasers, in which magnetic optical transitions play\nsignificant roles.\n", "  We discuss the self-consistent dynamics of plasmas by means of hamiltonian\nformalism for a system of $N$ near-resonant electrons interacting with a single\nLangmuir wave. The connection with the Vlasov description is revisited through\nthe numerical calculation of the van Kampen-like eigenfrequencies of the\nlinearized dynamics for many degrees of freedom. Both the exponential-like\ngrowth as well as damping of the Langmuir wave are shown to emerge from a phase\nmixing effect among beam modes, revealing unexpected similarities between the\nstable and unstable regimes.\n", "  The interaction of polarized light with photonic crystals exhibit unique\nfeatures due to its sub-wavelength nature on the surface and the periodic\nvariation of refractive index in the depth of the crystals. Here, we present a\ndetailed study of polarization anisotropy in light scattering associated with\nthree-dimensional photonic crystals with face centered cubic symmetry over a\nbroad wavelength and angular range. The polarization anisotropy leads to a\nshift in the conventional Brewster angle defined for a planar interface with\ncertain refractive index. The observed shift in Brewster angle strongly depends\non the index contrast and lattice constant. Polarization-dependent stop gap\nmeasurements are performed on photonic crystals with different index contrast\nand lattice constants. These measurements indicate unique stop gap branching at\nhigh-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone of the photonic crystals. The\ninherited stop gap branching is observed for TE polarization whereas that is\nsuppressed for TM polarization as a consequence of Brewster effect. Our results\nhave consequences in the polarized light-scattering from plasmonic structures\nand dielectric meta-surfaces and are also useful in applications like\nnano-scale polarization splitters and lasers.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium exciton-polariton condensation in 1D to 0D and 1D\nto 2D junctions by means of non-resonant spectroscopy. The shape of our\npotential landscape allows to probe the resonant transmission of a propagating\ncondensate between a quasi-1D waveguide and cylindrically symmetric states. We\nobserve a distinct mode selection by varying the position of the non-resonant\npump laser. Moreover, we study the the case of propagation from a localized\ntrapped condensate state into a waveguide channel. Here, the choice of the\nposition of the injection laser allows us to tune the output in the waveguide.\nOur measurements are supported by an accurate Ginzburg-Landau modeling of the\nsystem shining light on the underlying mechanisms.\n", "  We discuss some aspects of soft hairy black holes and a new kind of \"soft\nhairy cosmologies\", including a detailed derivation of the metric formulation,\nresults on flat space, and novel observations concerning the entropy.\nRemarkably, like in the case with negative cosmological constant, we find that\nthe asymptotic symmetries for locally flat spacetimes with a horizon are\ngoverned by infinite copies of the Heisenberg algebra that generate soft hair\ndescendants. It is also shown that the generators of the three-dimensional\nBondi-Metzner-Sachs algebra arise from composite operators of the affine u(1)\ncurrents through a twisted Sugawara-like construction. We then discuss entropy\nmacroscopically, thermodynamically and microscopically and discover that a\nmicroscopic formula derived recently for boundary conditions associated to the\nKorteweg-de Vries hierarchy fits perfectly our results for entropy and ground\nstate energy. We conclude with a comparison to related approaches.\n", "  We revisit the calculation of the width for the radiative decay of a $1^{+-}$\nheavy $Q \\bar Q$ meson via the channel $1^{+-} \\to 0^{-+} +\\gamma$ in the\ncovariant light-front quark model. We carry out the reduction of the\nlight-front amplitude in the non-relativistic limit, explicitly computing the\nleading and next-to-leading order relativistic corrections. This shows the\nconsistency of the light-front approach with the non-relativistic formula for\nthis electric dipole transition. Furthermore, the theoretical uncertainty in\nthe predicted width is studied as a function of the inputs for the heavy quark\nmass and wavefunction structure parameter. We analyze the specific decays\n$h_{c}(1P) \\to \\eta_{c}(1S) + \\gamma$ and $h_{b}(1P) \\to \\eta_{b}(1S) +\n\\gamma$. We compare our results with experimental data and with other\ntheoretical predictions from calculations based on non-relativistic models and\ntheir extensions to include relativistic effects, finding reasonable agreement.\n", "  We investigate the detection prospects of a non-standard dark sector in the\ncontext of boosted dark matter. We consider a scenario where two stable\nparticles have a large mass difference and the heavier particle accounts for\nmost of dark matter in our current universe. The heavier candidate is assumed\nto have no interaction with the standard model particles at tree-level, hence\nevading existing constraints. Although subdominant, the lighter dark matter\nparticles are efficiently produced via pair-annihilation of the heavier ones in\nthe center of the Galaxy or the Sun. The large Lorentz boost enables detection\nof the non-minimal dark sector in large volume terrestrial experiments via\nexchange of a light dark photon with electrons or nuclei. Various experiments\ndesigned for neutrino physics and proton decay are examined in detail,\nincluding Super-K and Hyper-K. In this study, we focus on the sensitivity of\nthe far detector at the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment for boosted dark\nmatter produced in the center of the Sun, and compare our findings with recent\nresults for boosted dark matter produced in the galactic center.\n", "  A light stop with mass almost degenerate with the lightest neutralino has\nimportant connections with both naturalness and dark matter relic abundance.\nThis region is also very hard to probe at colliders. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the potential of searching for such stop particles at the LHC from\nsbottom decays, focusing on two channels with final states $2\\ell+E^{\\rm\nmiss}_{\\rm T}$ and $1b1\\ell+E^{\\rm miss}_{\\rm T}$. We found that, if the\nlightest sbottom has mass around or below 1 TeV and has a significant branching\nratio to decay to stop and $W$ ($\\tilde{b} \\to \\tilde{t}\\,W$), a stop almost\ndegenerate with neutralino can be excluded up to about 500-600 GeV at the 13\nTeV LHC with $300\\,{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ data. The searches we propose are\ncomplementary to other SUSY searches at the LHC and could have the best\nsensitivity to the stop-bino coannihilation region. Since they involve final\nstates which have already been used in LHC searches, a reinterpretation of the\nsearch results already has sensitivity. Further optimization could deliver the\nfull potential of these channels.\n", "  We present and analyse an extensive dataset of the superluminous supernova\n(SLSN) LSQ14mo (z = 0.256), consisting of a multi-colour lightcurve from -30 d\nto +70 d in the rest-frame and a series of 6 spectra from PESSTO covering -7 d\nto +50 d. This is among the densest spectroscopic coverage, and\nbest-constrained rising lightcurve, for a fast-declining hydrogen-poor SLSN.\nThe bolometric lightcurve can be reproduced with a millisecond magnetar model\nwith ~ 4 M_sol ejecta mass, and the temperature and velocity evolution is also\nsuggestive of a magnetar as the power source. Spectral modelling indicates that\nthe SN ejected ~ 6 M_sol of CO-rich material with a kinetic energy of ~ 7 x\n10^51 erg, and suggests a partially thermalised additional source of luminosity\nbetween -2 d and +22 d. This may be due to interaction with a shell of material\noriginating from pre-explosion mass loss. We further present a detailed\nanalysis of the host galaxy system of LSQ14mo. PESSTO and GROND imaging show\nthree spatially resolved bright regions, and we used the VLT and FORS2 to\nobtain a deep (five-hour exposure) spectra of the SN position and the three\nstar-forming regions, which are at a similar redshift. The FORS spectrum at\n+300 days shows no trace of SN emission lines and we place limits on the\nstrength of [O I] from comparisons with other Ic SNe. The deep spectra provides\na unique chance to investigate spatial variations in the host star-formation\nactivity and metallicity. The specific star-formation rate is similar in all\nthree components, as is the presence of a young stellar population. However,\nthe position of LSQ14mo exhibits a lower metallicity, with 12 + log(O/H) = 8.2\nin both the R23 and N2 scales (corresponding to ~ 0.3 Z_sol). We propose that\nthe three bright regions in the host system are interacting, which thus\ntriggers star-formation and forms young stellar populations.\n", "  The notion of time is given a different footing in Quantum Mechanics and\nGeneral Relativity, treated as a parameter in the former and being an observer\ndependent property in the later. From a operational point of view time is\nsimply the correlation between a system and a clock, where an idealized clock\ncan be modelled as a two level systems. We investigate the dynamics of clocks\ninteracting gravitationally by treating the gravitational interaction as a\nclassical information channel. In particular, we focus on the decoherence rates\nand temporal resolution of arrays of $N$ clocks showing how the minimum\ndephasing rate scales with $N$, and the spatial configuration. Furthermore, we\nconsider the gravitational redshift between a clock and massive particle and\nshow that a classical channel model of gravity predicts a finite dephasing rate\nfrom the non-local interaction. In our model we obtain a fundamental limitation\nin time accuracy that is intrinsic to each clock.\n", "  Grisms are dispersive transmission optics that find their most frequent use\nin instruments that combine imaging and spectroscopy. This application is\nparticularly popular in the infrared where imagers frequently have a cold pupil\nin their optical path that is a suitable location for a dispersive element. In\nparticular, several recent and planned space experiments make use of grisms in\nslit-less spectrographs capable of multi-object spectroscopy. We present an\nastronomer-oriented general purpose introduction to grisms and their use in\ncurrent and future astronomical instruments. We present a simple, step-by-step\nprocedure for adding a grism spectroscopy capability to an existing imager\ndesign. This procedure serves as an introduction to a discussion of the device\nperformance requirements for grisms, focusing in particular on the problems of\nlithographically patterned silicon devices, the most effective grism technology\nfor the 1.1-8 micron range. We begin by summarizing the manufacturing process\nof monolithic silicon gratings. We follow this with a report in detail on the\nas-built performance of parts constructed for a significant new space\napplication, the NIRCam instrument on JWST and compare these measurements to\nthe requirements.\n", "  We study analytically the constraints of the conformal bootstrap on the\nlow-lying spectrum of operators in field theories with global conformal\nsymmetry in one and two spacetime dimensions. We introduce a new class of\nlinear functionals acting on the conformal bootstrap equation. In 1D, we use\nthe new basis to construct extremal functionals leading to the optimal upper\nbound on the gap above identity in the OPE of two identical primary operators\nof integer or half-integer scaling dimension. We also prove an upper bound on\nthe twist gap in 2D theories with global conformal symmetry. When the external\nscaling dimensions are large, our functionals provide a direct point of contact\nbetween crossing in a 1D CFT and scattering of massive particles in large\n$\\textrm{AdS}_2$. In particular, CFT crossing can be shown to imply that\nappropriate OPE coefficients exhibit an exponential suppression characteristic\nof massive bound states, and that the 2D flat-space S-matrix should be analytic\naway from the real axis.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrated a high-order optical vortex pulsed laser based\non a mode selective all-fiber fused coupler composed of a single-mode fiber\n(SMF) and a few-mode fiber (FMF). The fused SMF-FMF coupler inserted in the\ncavity not only acts as mode converter from LP01 mode to LP11 or LP21 modes\nwith a broadband width over 100 nm, but also directly delivers femtosecond\nvortex pulses out of the mode locked cavity. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first report on the generation of high-order pulse vortex beams in\nmode-locked fiber laser. The generated 140 femtosecond vortex beam has a\nspectral width of 67 nm centered at 1544 nm.\n", "  We have investigated the electronic structure of Sr2IrO4 using core level\nresonant inelastic x-ray scattering. The experimental spectra can be well\nreproduced using ab initio density functional theory based multiplet ligand\nfield theory calculations, thereby validating these calculations. We found that\nthe low-energy, effective Ir t2g orbitals are practically degenerate in energy.\nWe uncovered that covalency in Sr2IrO4, and generally in iridates, is very\nlarge with substantial oxygen ligand hole character in the Ir t2g Wannier\norbitals. This has far reaching consequences, as not only the onsite\ncrystal-field energies are determined by the long range crystal-structure, but,\nmore significantly, magnetic exchange interactions will have long range\ndistance dependent anisotropies in the spin direction. These findings set\nconstraints and show pathways for the design of d^5 materials that can host\ncompass-like magnetic interactions.\n", "  Electronic structures of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ alloys (0 $\\leq$ $x$ $\\leq$ 1)\nare theoretically studied by nonlocal empirical pseudopotential method. For\nrelaxed Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$, a topological semimetal is found for $\\textit x$\n$>$ 41$\\%$ with gapless and band inversion at ${\\Gamma}$ point, while there is\nan indirect-direct bandgap transition at $x$ = 8.5$\\%$. For strained\nGe$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ on a Ge substrate, semimetals with a negative indirect\nbandgap appear for $x$ $>$ 43$\\%$, and the strained Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ on Ge is\nalways an indirect bandgap semiconductor for $x$ $<$ 43$\\%$. With appropriate\nbiaxial compressive strains, a topological Dirac semimetal is found with band\ninversion at ${\\Gamma}$ and one pair of Dirac cones along the [001] direction.\n", "  We propose a recipe - arguably the simplest - to compute the holographic\ntype-B Weyl anomaly for general higher-derivative gravity in asymptotically AdS\nspacetimes. In 5 and 7 dimensions we identify a suitable basis of curvature\ninvariants that allows to read off easily, without any further computation, the\nWeyl anomaly coefficients of the dual CFT. We tabulate the contributions from\nquadratic, cubic and quartic purely algebraic curvature invariants and also\nfrom terms involving derivatives of the curvature. We provide few examples,\nwhere the anomaly coefficients have been obtained by other means, to illustrate\nthe effectiveness of our prescription.\n", "  Scattering has usually be considered as detrimental for optical focusing or\nimaging. Recently, more and more research has shown that strongly scattering\nmaterials can be utilized to focus coherent light by controlling or shaping the\nincident light. Here, purposeful focusing of second-harmonic waves, which are\ngenerated and scattered from nonlinear turbid media via feedback-based\nwavefront shaping is presented. This work shows a flexible manipulation of both\ndisordered linear and nonlinear scattering signals, indicating more\ncontrollable degrees of freedom for the description of turbid media. This\ntechnique also provides a possible way to an efficient transmission of\nnonlinear signal at a desired location in the form of a focal point or other\npatterns. With the combination of random nonlinear optics and wavefront shaping\nmethods, more interesting applications are expected in the future, such as\nnonlinear transmission matrix, multi-frequency imaging and phase-matching-free\nnonlinear optics.\n", "  Selection, the tendency of some traits to become more frequent than others in\na population under the influence of some (natural or artificial) agency, is a\nkey component of Darwinian evolution and countless other natural and social\nphenomena. Yet a general theory of selection, analogous to the\nFisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theory of extreme events, is lacking. Here we introduce\na probabilistic definition of selection and show that selected values are\nattracted to a universal family of limiting distributions. The universality\nclasses and scaling exponents are determined by the tail thickness of the\nrandom variable under selection. Our results are supported by data from\nmolecular biology, agriculture and sport.\n", "  We use a Generalised Langevin Equation (GLE) scheme to study the thermal\ntransport of low dimensional systems. In this approach, the central classical\nregion is connected to two realistic thermal baths kept at two different\ntemperatures [H. Ness et al., Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 93}, 174303 (2016)]. We\nconsider model Al systems, i.e. one-dimensional atomic chains connected to\nthree-dimensional baths. The thermal transport properties are studied as a\nfunction of the chain length $N$ and the temperature difference $\\Delta T$\nbetween the baths. We calculate the transport properties both in the linear\nresponse regime and in the non-linear regime. Two different laws are obtained\nfor the linear conductance versus the length of the chains. For large\ntemperatures ($T \\gtrsim 500$ K) and temperature differences ($\\Delta T \\gtrsim\n500$ K), the chains, with $N > 18$ atoms, present a diffusive transport regime\nwith the presence of a temperature gradient across the system. For lower\ntemperatures($T \\lesssim 500$ K) and temperature differences ($\\Delta T\n\\lesssim 400$ K), a regime similar to the ballistic regime is observed. Such a\nballistic-like regime is also obtained for shorter chains ($N \\le 15 $). Our\ndetailed analysis suggests that the behaviour at higher temperatures and\ntemperature differences is mainly due to anharmonic effects within the long\nchains.\n", "  We compute corrections to the Einstein field equations which are induced by\nthe anomalous effective actions associated to the type A conformal anomaly,\nboth for the (non-local) Riegert action, as well as for the local action with\ndilaton. In all cases considered we find that these corrections can be very\nlarge.\n", "  Hysteresis characteristics of the general Spin-S ($S>1$) Blume-Capel model\nhave been studied within the effective field approximation. Particular emphasis\nhas been paid on the large negative valued crystal field region and it has been\ndemonstrated for this region that, Spin-S Blume-Capel model has $2S$ windowed\nhysteresis loop in low temperatures. Some interesting results have been\nobtained such as nested characteristics of the hysteresis loops of successive\nspin-S Blume-Capel model. Effect of the rising crystal field and temperature on\nthese hysteresis behaviors have been investigated in detail and physical\nmechanisms have been given.\n", "  An analysis of neutron and proton scattering off $^{40,48}$Ca has been\ncarried out. Real and imaginary potentials have been generated using the\nNuclear Structure Method (NSM) for scattering with the Gogny D1S\nnucleon-nucleon effective interaction. Observables are well described by NSM\nfor neutron and proton elastic scattering off $^{40}$Ca and for neutron\nscattering off $^{48}$Ca. For proton scattering off $^{48}$Ca, NSM yields a\nlack of absorption. This discrepancy is attributed to double-charge-exchange\ncontribution and coupling to Gamow- Teller mode which are not included in the\npresent version of NSM. A recipe based on a Perey-Buck fit of NSM imaginary\npotential and Lane model is proposed to overcome this issue in an approximate\nway.\n", "  This review is based on lectures given by M. J. Duff summarising the far\nreaching contributions of Ettore Majorana to fundamental physics, with special\nfocus on Majorana fermions in all their guises. The theoretical discovery of\nthe eponymous fermion in 1937 has since had profound implications for particle\nphysics, solid state and quantum computation. The breadth of these disciplines\nis testimony to Majorana's genius, which continues to permeate physics today.\nThese lectures offer a whistle-stop tour through some limited subset of the key\nideas. In addition to touching on these various applications, we will draw out\nsome fascinating relations connecting the normed division algebras $\\mathbb{R},\n\\mathbb{C}, \\mathbb{H}, \\mathbb{O}$ to spinors, trialities, $K$-theory and the\nclassification of stable topological states of symmetry-protected gapped\nfree-fermion systems.\n", "  Using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo, we compute the properties of a\nlattice model with spin $\\frac 1 2$ itinerant electrons tuned through a quantum\nphase transition to an Ising nematic phase. The nematic fluctuations induce\nsuperconductivity with a broad dome in the superconducting $T_c$ enclosing the\nnematic quantum critical point. For temperatures above $T_c$, we see strikingly\nnon-Fermi liquid behavior, including a \"nodal - anti nodal dichotomy\"\nreminiscent of that seen in several transition metal oxides. In addition, the\ncritical fluctuations have a strong effect on the low frequency optical\nconductivity, resulting in behavior consistent with \"bad metal\" phenomenology.\n", "  I review Stanley Mandelstam's many contributions to particle physics, quantum\nfield theory and string theory covering the years 1955 through 1980. His more\nrecent work will be reviewed by Nathan Berkovits. This is my contribution to\nthe Memorial Volume for Stanley Mandelstam (World Scientific, 2017).\n", "  We have developed a tunable colloidal system and a corresponding simulation\nmodel for studying the phase behavior of particles assembling under the\ninfluence of long-range magnetic interactions. A monolayer of paramagnetic\nparticles is subjected to a spatially uniform magnetic field with a static\nperpendicular component and rapidly rotating in-plane component. The sign and\nstrength of the interactions vary with the tilt angle $\\theta$ of the rotating\nmagnetic field. For a purely in-plane field, $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, interactions\nare attractive and the experimental results agree well with both equilibrium\nand out-of-equilibrium predictions based on a two-body interaction model. For\ntilt angles $50^{\\circ}\\lesssim \\theta\\lesssim 55^{\\circ}$, the two-body\ninteraction gives a short-range attractive and long-range repulsive (SALR)\ninteraction, which predicts the formation of equilibrium microphases. In\nexperiments, however, a different type of assembly is observed. Inclusion of\nthree-body (and higher-order) terms in the model does not resolve the\ndiscrepancy. We thus further characterize the anomalous behavior by measuring\nthe time-dependent cluster size distribution.\n", "  We extend the model-independent approach to characterise strong gravitational\nlenses of Wagner & Bartelmann (2016) to its most general form to leading order\nby using the orientation angles of a set of multiple images with respect to\ntheir connection line(s) in addition to the relative distances between the\nimages, their ellipticities and time-delays. For two symmetric images that\nstraddle the critical curve, the orientation angle additionally allows to\ndetermine the slope of the critical curve and a second (reduced) flexion\ncoefficient at the critical point on the connection line between the images. It\nalso allows to drop the symmetry assumption that the axis of largest image\nextension is orthogonal to the critical curve. For three images almost forming\na giant arc, the degree of assumed image symmetry is also reduced to the most\ngeneral case, allowing to describe image configurations for which the source\nneed not be placed on the symmetry axis of the two folds that unite at the\ncusp. For a given set of multiple images, we set limits on the applicability of\nour approach, show which information can be obtained in cases of merging\nimages, and analyse the accuracy achievable due to the Taylor expansion of the\nlensing potential for the fold case on a galaxy cluster scale NFW-profile, a\nfold and cusp case on a galaxy cluster scale SIE-profile, and compare the\ngeneralised approach with the one of Wagner & Bartelmann (2016). The position\nof the critical points is reconstructed with less than 5\" deviation for\nmultiple images closer to the critical points than 30\\% of the (effective)\nEinstein radius and the slope of the critical curve at a fold and its shape in\nthe vicinity of a cusp deviate less than 20\\% from the true values for\ndistances of the images to the critical points less than 15\\% of the\n(effective) Einstein radius.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the conduction properties of a molecular wire\nwhere hopping processes between electronic sites are coupled to a vibrational\nmode of the molecule. The latter is sandwiched between two electronic leads at\nfinite temperatures. We show that the electro-mechanical coupling can lead to a\nstrong enhancement of the lead-to-lead conduction. Moreover, under suitable\ndriving of the molecular vibrational mode, the device can act as a transistor\npassing sharply from enhanced conduction to short-circuit configuration.\n", "  G\\\"odel universe is a direct product of a line and a three-dimensional\nspacetime we call G$_\\alpha$. In this paper, we show that the G\\\"odel metrics\ncan arise as exact solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-Axion, Einstein-Proca-Axion,\nor Freedman-Schwarz gauged supergravity theories. The last allows us to embed\nG\\\"odel universe in string theory. The ten-dimensional spacetime is a direct\nproduct of a line and the nine-dimensional one of an $S^3\\times S^3$ bundle\nover G$_\\alpha$, and it can be interpreted as some decoupling limit of the\nrotating D1/D5/D5 intersection. For some appropriate parameter choice, the\nnine-dimensional metric becomes an AdS$_3\\times S^3$ bundle over squashed\n3-sphere. We also study the properties of the G\\\"odel black holes that are\nconstructed from the double Wick rotations of the G\\\"odel metrics.\n", "  Realistic fluid-solid interaction potentials are essential in description of\nconfined fluids especially in the case of geometric heterogeneous surfaces.\nCorrelated random field is considered as a model of random surface with high\ngeometric roughness. We provide the general theory of effective coarse-grained\nfluid-solid potential by proper averaging of the free energy of fluid molecules\nwhich interact with the solid media. This procedure is largely based on the\ntheory of random processes. We apply first passage time probability problem and\nassume the local Markov properties of random surfaces. General expression of\neffective fluid-solid potential is obtained. In the case of small surface\nirregularities analytical approximation for effective potential is proposed.\nBoth amorphous materials with large surface roughness and crystalline solids\nwith several types of fcc lattices are considered. It is shown that the wider\nthe lattice spacing in terms of molecular diameter of the fluid, the more\nobtained potentials differ from classical ones. A comparison with published\nMonte-Carlo simulations shows good qualitative agreement with the theory\npredictions. The work provides a promising approach to explore how the random\ngeometric heterogeneity affects on thermodynamic properties of the fluids.\n", "  A constant (spacetime-independent) $q$-field may play a crucial role for the\ncancellation of Planck-scale contributions to the gravitating vacuum energy\ndensity. We now show that a small spacetime-dependent perturbation of the\nequilibrium $q$-field behaves gravitationally as a pressureless perfect fluid.\nThis makes the fluctuating part of the $q$-field a candidate for the inferred\ndark-matter component of the present universe. For a Planck-scale oscillation\nfrequency of the $q$-field perturbation, the implication would be that direct\nsearches for dark-matter particles would remain unsuccessful in the foreseeable\nfuture.\n", "  A reconstruction algorithm for unfolding the neutron energy spectrum has been\ndeveloped based on the potential reduction interior point. This algorithm can\nbe easily applied to the neutron energy spectrum reconstruction in the recoil\nproton method. We transform neutron energy spectrum unfolding problem into a\ntypical nonnegative linear complementarity problem. The recoil proton energy\nspectrum and response matrix at angles of 0{\\deg} and 30{\\deg} are generated by\nthe Geant4 simulation toolkit. Several different neutron energy test spectrums\nare also employed. It is found that this unfolding algorithm is stable and\nprovide efficiency accurate results.\n", "  The initial singularity is the most troubling feature of the standard\ncosmology, which quantum effects are hoped to resolve. In this paper, we study\nquantum cosmology with conformal (Weyl) invariant matter. We show it is natural\nto extend the scale factor to negative values, allowing a large, collapsing\nUniverse to evolve across a quantum \"bounce\" into an expanding Universe like\nours. We compute the Feynman propagator for Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nbackgrounds exactly, identifying curious pathologies in the case of curved\n(open or closed) universes. We then include anisotropies, fixing the operator\nordering of the quantum Hamiltonian by imposing covariance under field\nredefinitions and again finding exact solutions. We show how complex classical\nsolutions allow one to circumvent the singularity while maintaining the\nvalidity of the semiclassical approximation. The simplest isotropic universes\nsit on a critical boundary, beyond which there is qualitatively different\nbehavior, with potential for instability. Additional scalars improve the\ntheory's stability. Finally, we study the semiclassical propagation of\ninhomogeneous perturbations about the flat, isotropic case, at linear and\nnonlinear order, showing that, at least at this level, there is no particle\nproduction across the bounce. These results form the basis for a promising new\napproach to quantum cosmology and the resolution of the big bang singularity.\n", "  An algebraic background in order to study the integrability properties of\npseudo-null curve motions in a $3$-dimensional Lorentzian space form is\ndeveloped. As an application we delve into the relationship between the\nBurgers' equation and the pseudo-null vortex filament equation. A recursion\noperator for the pseudo-null vortex filament equation is also provided.\n", "  The field diffracted from a one-dimensional, coherently illuminated periodic\nstructure at fractional Talbot distances can be described as a coherent sum of\nshifted units cells weighted by a set of phases given by quadratic Gauss sums.\nWe report on the computation of these sums by use of the properties of a\nrecently introduced integer $s$, which is constructed here directly from the\ntwo coprime numbers $p$ that $q$ that define the fractional Talbot plane. Using\ninteger $s$, the computation is reduced, up to a global phase, to the trivial\ncompletion of the exponential of the square of a sum. In addition, it is shown\nthat the Gauss sums can be reduced to two cases, depending only on the parity\nof integer $q$. Explicit and simpler expressions for the two forms of integer\n$s$ are also provided. The Gauss sums are presented as a Discrete Fourier\nTransform pair between periodic sequences of length $q$ showing perfect\nperiodic autocorrelation. The relationship with one-dimensional multilevel\nphase structures is exemplified by the study of Talbot array illuminators.\nThese results represent a simple means for the design and analysis of systems\nemploying the fractional Talbot effect.\n", "  Unidirectional backward and forward scattering of electromagnetic waves by\nnanoparticles are usually interpreted as the interference of conventional\nmultipole moments (i.e., electric and magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole,\netc.). The role of toroidal dipole moments in unidirectional scattering is\ngenerally overlooked. In this work, we investigate the unidirectional\nscattering for the system of three plasmonic nanospheres. It is found that the\nunidirectional backward scattering is caused by the interference between the\ntoroidal dipole moment and other conventional multipole moments. Tunable\nprimary backward and forward scattering can be achieved under some specific\nconfigurations. Our results can find applications in the design of\nnanoantennas.\n", "  Quasi-stationary states of the quantum system in the driving resonant field\nare considered without rotating wave approximation. Conditions under which the\nspontaneous emission could be suppressed in this system are investigated in the\nspecial case when the frequency of the driving field is essentially less than\nthe frequency of spontaneous emission. It is shown that the characteristic\nparameters of the effect are substantially changed in comparison with the\nresults corresponding to RWA. The real physical system for which the considered\neffects could be observed is described.\n", "  Classical entanglement is a powerful tool which provides a neat numerical\nestimate for the study of classical correlations. Its experimental\ninvestigation, however, has been limited to special cases. Here, we demonstrate\nthat the experimental quantification of the level of classical entanglement can\nbe carried out in more general instances. Our approach enables the extension to\narbitrarily shaped transverse modes and hence delivering a suitable\nquantification tool to describe concisely the modal structure.\n", "  We have measured a response to a black body radiation and noise of the\ncold-electron bolometers. The experimental results have been fitted by\ntheoretical model with two heat-balance equations. The measured noise has been\ndecomposed into several terms with the help of theory. It is demonstrated that\nthe photon noise exceeds any other noise components, that allows us to conclude\nthat the bolometers see the photon noise. Moreover, a peculiar shape of the\nnoise dependence on the absorbed power originates completely from the photonic\ncomponent according to the theory. In the additional experiment on heating of\nthe cryostat plate together with the sample holder we have observed nearly\nindependence of the noise on the electron temperature of the absorber, which\nhas provided another proof of the presence of the photon noise in the first\nexperiment.\n", "  We show that correlated two-particle backscattering can induce fractional\ncharge oscillations in a quantum dot built at the edge of a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator by means of magnetic barriers. The result nicely\ncomplements recent works where the fractional oscillations were obtained\nemploying of semiclassical treatments. Moreover, since by rotating the\nmagnetization of the barriers a fractional charge can be trapped in the dot via\nthe Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism, the system we analyze offers the opportunity to\nstudy the interplay between this noninteracting charge fractionalization and\nthe fractionalization due to two-particle backscattering. In this context, we\ndemonstrate that the number of fractional oscillations of the charge density\ndepends on the magnetization angle. Finally, we address the renormalization\ninduced by two-particle backscattering on the spin density, which is\ncharacterized by a dominant oscillation, sensitive to the Jackiw-Rebbi charge,\nwith a wavelength twice as large as the charge density oscillations.\n", "  The understanding of the phase structure and the fundamental properties of\nQCD matter from its microscopic description requires appropriate\nfirst-principle approaches. Here I review the progress towards a quantitative\nfirst-principle continuum approach within the framework of the Functional\nRenormalization group established by the fQCD collaboration. I focus on recent\nquantitative results for quenched QCD and Yang-Mills theory in the vacuum\nbefore addressing the calculation of dynamical quantities such as spectral\nfunctions and transport coefficients in this framework.\n", "  We study the single graviton production at the CERN LHC using the\n$k_T$-factorization approach of QCD. We consider the\nArkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali scenario and Randall-Sundrum model with one\nwarped extra-dimension and derive the production amplitudes for spin-$2$\n(Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton) and spin-$0$ (radion) states,\nincluding subsequent graviton decay into the dilepton or diphoton pairs. We use\nthe transverse momentum dependent (unintegrated) parton densities in a proton\nobtained from Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) evolution equation,\nwhich resums the leading logarithmic small-$x$ corrections to the production\ncross sections. We demonstrate that the small-$x$ effects can manifest\nthemselves in the different angular distributions of graviton decay products\nand give some examples of how these distributions can look like at the LHC\nenergies.\n", "  The quark and lepton mass patterns upset their naive unification. In this\npaper, a new approach to solve this problem is proposed. Model-independently,\nwe find that a successful unification can be achieved. A mechanism is\nidentified by which the large top quark mass renders its third-generation\nleptonic partner very light. This state is thus identified with the electron.\nWe then provide a generic dynamical implementation of this mechanism, using\ntree-level exchanges of vector leptons to relate the quark and lepton flavor\nstructures. In a supersymmetric context, this same mechanism splits the squark\nmasses, and third generation squarks end up much lighter than the others.\nFinally, the implementation of this mechanism in SU(5) GUT permits to avoid\nintroducing any flavor structure beyond the two minimal Yukawa couplings,\nensuring the absence of unknown mixing matrices and their potentially large\nimpact on FCNC.\n", "  Laser cooling and trapping of atoms and atomic ions has led to numerous\nadvances including the observation of exotic phases of matter, development of\nexquisite sensors and state-of-the-art atomic clocks. The same level of control\nin molecules could also lead to profound developments such as controlled\nchemical reactions and sensitive probes of fundamental theories, but the\nvibrational and rotational degrees of freedom in molecules pose a formidable\nchallenge for controlling their quantum mechanical states. Here, we use\nquantum-logic spectroscopy (QLS) for preparation and nondestructive detection\nof quantum mechanical states in molecular ions. We develop a general technique\nto enable optical pumping and preparation of the molecule into a pure initial\nstate. This allows for the observation of high-resolution spectra in a single\nion (here CaH+) and coherent phenomena such as Rabi flopping and Ramsey\nfringes. The protocol requires a single, far-off resonant laser, which is not\nspecific to the molecule, so that many other molecular ions, including\npolyatomic species, could be treated with the same methods in the same\napparatus by changing the molecular source. Combined with long interrogation\ntimes afforded by ion traps, a broad range of molecular ions could be studied\nwith unprecedented control and precision, representing a critical step towards\nproposed applications, such as precision molecular spectroscopy, stringent\ntests of fundamental physics, quantum computing, and precision control of\nmolecular dynamics.\n", "  A construction is given of the most general representations of the\nq-oscillator algebra where both generators are tridiagonal. It is shown to be\nconnected to the Askey-Wilson polynomials.\n", "  A multi-channel algebraic scattering (MCAS) method has been used to solve\ncoupled sets of Lippmann-Schwinger equations for the $\\alpha$+${}^6$He cluster\nsystem, so finding a model spectrum for ${}^{10}$Be to more than 10 MeV\nexcitation. Three states of ${}^6$He are included and the resonance character\nof the two excited states taken into account in finding solutions. A model\nHamiltonian has been found that gives very good agreement with the known bound\nstates and with some low-lying resonances of ${}^{10}$Be. More resonance states\nare predicted than have as yet been observed. The method also yields\n$S$-matrices which we have used to evaluate low-energy ${}^6$He-$\\alpha$\nscattering cross sections. Reasonable reproduction of low-energy differential\ncross sections and of energy variation of cross sections measured at fixed\nscattering angles is found.\n", "  We propose to use femtosecond direct laser writing technique to realize\ndielectric optical elements from photo-resist materials for the generation of\nstructured light from purely geometrical phase transformations. This is\nillustrated by the fabrication and characterization of spin-to-orbital optical\nangular momentum couplers generating optical vortices of topological charge\nfrom 1 to 20. In addition, the technique is scalable and allows obtaining\nmicroscopic to macroscopic flat optics. These results thus demonstrate that\ndirect 3D photopolymerization technology qualifies for the realization of\nspin-controlled geometric phase optical elements.\n", "  Relativistic strongly magnetized plasmas are produced in laboratories thanks\nto state-of-the-art laser technology but can naturally be found around compact\nobjects such as neutron stars and black holes. Detailed studies of the\nbehaviour of relativistic plasmas require accurate computations able to catch\nthe full spatial and temporal dynamics of the system. Numerical simulations of\nultra-relativistic plasmas face severe restrictions due to limitations in the\nmaximum possible Lorentz factors that current algorithm can reproduce to good\naccuracy. In order to circumvent this flaw and repel the limit to\n$\\gamma\\approx10^9$, we design a new fully implicit scheme to solve the\nrelativistic particle equation of motion in an external electromagnetic field\nusing a three dimensional Cartesian geometry. We show some examples of\nnumerical integrations in constant electromagnetic fields to prove the\nefficiency of our algorithm. The code is also able to follow the electric drift\nmotion for high Lorentz factors. In the most general case of spatially and\ntemporally varying electromagnetic fields, the code performs extremely well as\nshown by comparison with exact analytical solutions for the relativistic\nelectrostatic Kepler problem as well as for linearly and circularly polarized\nplane waves.\n", "  Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) belongs to a class of models and\ncomputational algorithms developed to address mesoscale problems in complex\nfluids and soft matter in general. It is based on the notion of particles that\nrepresent coarse-grained portions of the system under study and allow,\ntherefore, to reach time and length scales that would be otherwise unreachable\nfrom microscopic simulations. The method has been conceptually refined since\nits introduction almost twenty five years ago. This perspective surveys the\nmajor conceptual improvements in the original DPD model, along with its\nmicroscopic foundation, and discusses outstanding challenges in the field. We\nsummarize some recent advances and suggests avenues for future developments.\n", "  We study the collective dynamics of a lattice model of stochastically\ninteracting agents with a weighted field of vision. We assume that agents\npreferentially interact with neighbours, depending on their relative location,\nthrough velocity alignments and the additional constraint of exclusion. Unlike\nin previous models of flocking, here the stochasticity arises intrinsically\nfrom the interactions between agents, and its strength is dependent on the\nlocal density of agents. We find that this system yields a first-order jamming\ntransition as a consequence of these interactions, even at a very low density.\nFurthermore, the critical jamming density is found to strongly depend on the\nnature of the field of view.\n", "  Metallic atomic junctions pose the ultimate limit to the scaling of\nelectrical contacts. They serve as model systems to probe electrical and\nthermal transport down to the atomic level as well as quantum effects occurring\nin one-dimensional systems. Charge transport in atomic junctions has been\nstudied intensively in the last two decades. However, heat transport remains\npoorly characterized because of significant experimental challenges.\nSpecifically the combination of high sensitivity to small heat fluxes and the\nformation of stable atomic contacts has been a major hurdle for the development\nof this field. Here we report on the realization of heat transfer measurements\nthrough atomic junctions and analyze the thermal conductance of single atomic\ngold contacts at room temperature. Simultaneous measurements of charge and heat\ntransport reveal the proportionality of electrical and thermal conductance,\nquantized with the respective conductance quanta. This constitutes an atomic\nscale verification of the well-known Wiedemann-Franz law. We anticipate that\nour findings will be a major advance in enabling the investigation of heat\ntransport properties in molecular junctions, with meaningful implications\ntowards the manipulation of heat at the nanoscale\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the charging\ndynamics of helium nanodroplets doped with atoms of different species and\nirradiated by intense near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses (<10^15 Wcm-2). In\nparticular, we elucidate the interplay of dopant ionization inducing the\nignition of a helium nanoplasma, and the charging of the dopant atoms driven by\nthe ionized helium host. Most efficient nanoplasma ignition and charging is\nfound when doping helium droplets with xenon atoms, in which case high charge\nstates both of helium (He2+) and of xenon (Xe^21+) are detected. In contrast,\nonly low charge states of helium and dopants are measured when doping with\npotassium and calcium atoms. Classical molecular dynamics simulations which\ninclude focal averaging generally reproduce the experimental results and\nprovide detailed insights into the correlated charging dynamics of guest and\nhost clusters.\n", "  It has been shown by A. Sen that logarithmic corrections to the black hole\narea-entropy law are entirely determined macroscopically from the massless\nparticle spectrum. They therefore serve as powerful consistency checks on any\nproposed enumeration of quantum black hole microstates. Sen's results include a\nmacroscopic computation of the logarithmic corrections for a five-dimensional\nnear extremal Kerr-Newman black hole. Here we compute these corrections\nmicroscopically using a stringy embedding of the Kerr/CFT correspondence and\nfind perfect agreement.\n", "  Gaia and its complementary spectroscopic surveys combined will yield the most\ncomprehensive database of kinematic and chemical information of stars in the\nMilky Way. The Gaia FGK benchmark stars play a central role in this matter as\nthey are calibration pillars for the atmospheric parameters and chemical\nabundances for various surveys. The spectroscopic analyses of the benchmark\nstars are done by combining different methods, and the results will be affected\nby the systematic uncertainties inherent in each method. In this paper we\nexplore some of these systematic uncertainties. We determined line abundances\nof Ca, Cr, Mn and Co for four benchmark stars using six different methods. We\nchanged the default input parameters of the different codes in a systematic way\nand found in some cases significant differences between the results. Since\nthere is no consensus on the correct values for many of these default\nparameters, we urge the community to raise discussions towards standard input\nparameters that could alleviate the difference in abundances obtained by\ndifferent methods. In this work we provide quantitative estimates of\nuncertainties in elemental abundances due to the effect of differing technical\nassumptions in spectrum modelling.\n", "  We present a detailed account and extension of our claim in arXiv:1610.01490.\nWe test the gauge/gravity duality between the ${\\cal N} = 6$ mass-deformed ABJM\ntheory with U$_k(N)\\times$U$_{-k}(N)$ gauge symmetry and the 11-dimensional\nsupergravity on LLM geometries with SO(4)/${\\mathbb Z}_k$\n$\\times$SO(4)/${\\mathbb Z}_k$ isometry, in the large $N$ limit. Our analysis is\nbased on the evaluation of vacuum expectation values of chiral primary\noperators from the supersymmetric vacua of mass-deformed ABJM theory and from\nthe implementation of Kaluza-Klein holography to the LLM geometries. We focus\non the chiral primary operator with conformal dimension $\\Delta = 1$. We show\nthat $\\langle {\\cal O}^{(\\Delta=1)}\\rangle= N^{\\frac32} \\, f_{(\\Delta=1)}$ for\nall supersymmetric vacuum solutions and LLM geometries with $k=1$, where the\nfactor $f_{(\\Delta)}$ is independent of $N$. We also confirm that the vacuum\nexpectation value of the the energy momentum tensor is vanishing as expected by\nthe supersymmetry. We extend our results to the case of $k\\ne 1$ for LLM\ngeometries represented by rectangular-shaped Young-diagrams. In analogy with\nthe Coulomb branch of the ${\\cal N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, we argue that\nthe discrete Higgs vacua of the mABJM theory as well as the corresponding LLM\ngeometries are parametrized by the vevs of the chiral primary operators.\n", "  We investigate possible effects of correlations between stopped nucleons on\nhigher order proton cumulants at low energy heavy-ion collisions. We find that\nfluctuations of the number of wounded nucleons $N_{\\mathrm{part}}$ lead to\nrather nontrivial dependence of the correlations on the centrality; however,\nthis effect is too small to explain the large and positive four-proton\ncorrelations found in the preliminary data collected by the STAR collaboration\nat $\\sqrt{s}=7.7$ GeV. We further demonstrate that, by taking into account\nadditional proton clustering, we are able to qualitatively reproduce the\npreliminary experimental data. We speculate that this clustering may originate\neither from collective/multi-collision stopping which is expected to be\neffective at lower energies or from a possible first-order phase transition, or\nfrom (attractive) final state interactions. To test these ideas we propose to\nmeasure a mixed multi-particle correlation between stopped protons and a\nproduced particle (e.g. pion, antiproton).\n", "  We study the possibility of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking where\nloop corrections to the mass parameter of the Higgs boson trigger the symmetry\nbreaking in various extensions of the Standard Model (SM). Although the\nmechanism fails in the SM, it is shown to be quite successful in several\nextensions which share a common feature of having an additional scalar around\nthe TeV scale. The positive Higgs mass parameter at a high energy scale is\nturned negative in the renormalization group flow to lower energy by the cross\ncouplings between the scalars in the Higgs potential. The type-II seesaw model\nwith a TeV scale weak scalar triplet, a two-loop radiative neutrino mass model\nwith new scalars at the TeV scale, the inert doublet model, scalar singlet dark\nmatter model, and a universal seesaw model with an additional U(1) broken at\nthe TeV scale are studied and shown to exhibit successful radiative electroweak\nsymmetry breaking.\n", "  We present exact solutions of four-dimensional Einstein's equations related\nto Minkoswki vacuum constructed from Type IIB string theory with non-trivial\nfluxes. Following recent works, we study a non-trivial flux compactification on\na fibered product by a four-dimensional torus and a two-dimensional sphere\npunctured by 5- and 7-branes. By considering only 3-form fluxes and the\ndilaton, as functions on the internal sphere coordinates, we show that these\nsolutions correspond to a family of supersymmetric solutions constructed by the\nuse of G-theory. Meromorphicity on functions constructed in terms of fluxes and\nwarping factors guarantees that flux and 5-brane contributions to the scalar\ncurvature vanish while fulfilling stringent constraints as tadpole cancellation\nand Bianchi identities. Different Einstein's solutions are shown to be related\nby U-dualities. We present three supersymmetric non-trivial Minkowski vacuum\nsolutions and compute the corresponding soft terms. We also construct a\nnon-supersymmetric solution and study its stability.\n", "  We obtain a model-independent prediction for the two-photon exchange\ncontribution to the hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen. We use the relation\nof the Wilson coefficients of the spin-dependent dimension-six four-fermion\noperator of NRQED applied to the electron-proton and to the muon-proton\nsectors. Their difference can be reliably computed using chiral perturbation\ntheory, whereas the Wilson coefficient of the electron-proton sector can be\ndetermined from the hyperfine splitting in hydrogen. This allows us to give a\nprecise model-independent determination of the Wilson coefficient for the\nmuon-proton sector, and consequently of the two-photon exchange contribution to\nthe hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen, which reads $\\delta \\bar\nE_{p\\mu,\\rm HF}^{\\rm TPE}(nS)=-\\frac{1}{n^3}1.161(20)$ meV. Together with the\nassociated QED analysis, we obtain a prediction for the hyperfine splitting in\nmuonic hydrogen that reads $E^{\\rm th}_{p\\mu,\\rm HF}(1S)=182.623(27)$ meV and\n$E^{\\rm th}_{p\\mu,\\rm HF}(2S)=22.8123(33)$ meV. The error is dominated by the\ntwo-photon exchange contribution.\n", "  We perform a likelihood analysis of the minimal Anomaly-Mediated\nSupersymmetry Breaking (mAMSB) model using constraints from cosmology and\naccelerator experiments. We find that a wino-like or a Higgsino-like neutralino\nLSP, $m_{\\tilde \\chi^0_{1}}$, may provide the cold dark matter (DM) with\nsimilar likelihood. The upper limit on the DM density from Planck and other\nexperiments enforces $m_{\\tilde \\chi^0_{1}} \\lesssim 3~TeV$ after the inclusion\nof Sommerfeld enhancement in its annihilations. If most of the cold DM density\nis provided by the $\\tilde \\chi_0^1$, the measured value of the Higgs mass\nfavours a limited range of $\\tan \\beta \\sim 5$ (or for $\\mu > 0$, $\\tan \\beta\n\\sim 45$) but the scalar mass $m_0$ is poorly constrained. In the wino-LSP\ncase, $m_{3/2}$ is constrained to about $900~TeV$ and ${m_{\\tilde \\chi^0_{1}}}$\nto $2.9\\pm0.1~TeV$, whereas in the Higgsino-LSP case $m_{3/2}$ has just a lower\nlimit $\\gtrsim 650TeV$ ($\\gtrsim 480TeV$) and $m_{\\tilde \\chi^0_{1}}$ is\nconstrained to $1.12 ~(1.13) \\pm0.02~TeV$ in the $\\mu>0$ ($\\mu<0$) scenario. In\nneither case can the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, ${(g-2)_\\mu}$, be\nimproved significantly relative to its Standard Model (SM) value, nor do\nflavour measurements constrain the model significantly, and there are poor\nprospects for discovering supersymmetric particles at the LHC, {though there}\nare some prospects for direct DM detection. On the other hand, if the\n${m_{\\tilde \\chi^0_{1}}}$ contributes only a fraction of the cold DM density,\n{future LHC $E_T$-based searches for gluinos, squarks and heavier chargino and\nneutralino states as well as disappearing track searches in the wino-like LSP\nregion will be relevant}, and interference effects enable ${\\rm BR}(B_{s, d}\n\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-)$ to agree with the data better than in the SM in the case of\nwino-like DM with $\\mu > 0$.\n", "  An extended field theory is presented that captures the full SL(2) x O(6,6+n)\nduality group of four-dimensional half-maximal supergravities. The theory has\nsection constraints whose two inequivalent solutions correspond to minimal D=10\nsupergravity and chiral half-maximal D=6 supergravity, respectively coupled to\nvector and tensor multiplets. The relation with O(6,6+n) (heterotic) double\nfield theory is thoroughly discussed. Non-Abelian interactions as well as\nbackground fluxes are captured by a deformation of the generalised\ndiffeomorphisms. Finally, making use of the SL(2) duality structure, it is\nshown how to generate gaugings with non-trivial de Roo-Wagemans angles via\ngeneralised Scherk-Schwarz ansaetze. Such gaugings allow for moduli\nstabilisation including the SL(2) dilaton.\n", "  The early time dynamics of heavy ion collisions can be described by classical\nfields in an approximation of Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) called Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC). Monte-Carlo sampling of the color charge for the incoming\nnuclei are used to calculate their classical gluon fields. Following the recent\nwork by Chen et al. we calculate the energy momentum tensor of those fields at\nearly times in the collision event-by-event. This can then be used for\nsubsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the single events.\n", "  Blazars are the most luminous and variable AGNs, and thus excellent probes of\naccretion and emission processes close to the central engine. We focus on PKS\n1510-089 ($z=0.36$), one of the brightest gamma-ray sources in the Fermi LAT\ncatalog, to study its complex multi-wavelength variability. PKS 1510-089 was\nobserved twice in hard X-rays with the IBIS instrument onboard INTEGRAL during\nthe flares of Jan 2009 and Jan 2010, and simultaneously with Swift and NOT, in\naddition to the constant Fermi monitoring. The optical polarization was\nmeasured in several bands on 18 Jan 2010 at the NOT. Using our and archival\ndata we constructed historical light curves at gamma-to-radio wavelengths\ncovering nearly 20 years and applied variability tests. We assembled SEDs in\n2009 and 2010 and compared them with those at two previous epochs and with a\nmodel based on synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) radiation. The SED modeling\nsuggests that the physical quantities that undergo the largest variations are\nthe total power injected into the emitting region and the random Lorentz factor\nof the electron distribution cooling break, that are higher in the higher\ngamma-ray states. This suggests a correlation of the injected power with\nenhanced activity of the acceleration mechanism. The cooling likely takes place\nat a much smaller distance ($\\sim$0.03 pc) than the BLR radius. The emission at\na few hundred GeV can be reproduced with IC scattering of highly relativistic\nelectrons off FIR photons at $\\sim$0.2 pc, presumably in a dusty torus. DCF\nanalysis between the long-term optical and gamma-ray light curves yields a good\ncorrelation with no measurable delay. Our time analysis of the RXTE PCA and\nFermi LAT light curves reveals no obvious (quasi-)periodicities, up to the\nmaximum time scale (a few years) probed by the light curves, which are severely\naffected by red noise.\n", "  We report high pressure studies of the structural stability of Ru2Sn3, a new\ntype of three dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) with unique quasi-one\ndimensional Dirac electron states throughout the surface Brillouin zone of its\none-atmosphere low temperature orthorhombic form. Our in-situ high-pressure\nsynchrotron x-ray diffraction and electrical resistance measurements reveal\nthat upon increasing pressure the tetragonal to orthorhombic shifts to higher\ntemperature. We find that the stability of the orthorhombic phase that hosts\nthe non-trivial topological ground state can be pushed up to room temperature\nby an applied pressure of ~ 20 GPa. This is in contrast to the commonly known\n3D-TIs whose ground state is usually destroyed under pressure. Our results\nindicate that pressure provides a possible pathway for realizing a\nroom-temperature topological insulating state in Ru2Sn3.\n", "  Two particle interference phenomena, such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, are a\ndirect manifestation of the nature of the symmetry properties of\nindistinguishable particles as described by quantum mechanics. The\nHong-Ou-Mandel effect has recently been applied as a tool for pure state\ntomography of a single photon. In this article, we generalise the method to\nextract additional information for a pure state and extend this to the full\ntomography of mixed states as well. The formalism is kept general enough to\napply to both boson and fermion based interferometry. Our theoretical\ndiscussion is accompanied by two proposals of interferometric setups that allow\nthe measurement of a tomographically complete set of observables for single\nphoton quantum states.\n", "  Due to their high cross-field mobility, neutrals can contribute to momentum\ntransport even at the low relative densities found inside the separatrix and\nthey can generate intrinsic rotation. We use a charge-exchange dominated\nsolution to the neutral kinetic equation, coupled to neoclassical ions, to\nevaluate the momentum transport due to neutrals. Numerical solutions to the\ndrift-kinetic equation allow us to cover the full range of collisionality,\nincluding the intermediate levels typical of the tokamak edge. In the edge\nthere are several processes likely to contribute to momentum transport in\naddition to neutrals. Therefore, we present here an interpretive framework that\ncan evaluate the momentum transport through neutrals based on radial plasma\nprofiles. We demonstrate its application by analysing the neutral angular\nmomentum flux for an L-mode discharge in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. The\nmagnitudes of the angular momentum fluxes we find here due to neutrals of up to\n$1{-}2\\;\\mathrm{N\\, m}$ are comparable to the net torque on the plasma from\nneutral beam injection, indicating the importance of neutrals for rotation in\nthe edge.\n", "  Epitaxial strain, layer confinement and inversion symmetry breaking have\nemerged as powerful new approaches to control the electronic and atomic-scale\nstructural properties in complex metal oxides. Nickelate heterostructures,\nbased on RENiO$_3$, where RE is a trivalent rare-earth cation, have been shown\nto be relevant model systems since the orbital occupancy, degeneracy, and,\nconsequently, the electronic/magnetic properties can be altered as a function\nof epitaxial strain, layer thickness and superlattice structure. One such\nrecent example is the tri-component LaTiO$_3$-LaNiO$_3$-LaAlO$_3$ superlattice,\nwhich exhibits charge transfer and orbital polarization as the result of its\ninterfacial dipole electric field. A crucial step towards control of these\nparameters for future electronic and magnetic device applications is to develop\nan understanding of both the magnitude and range of the octahedral network's\nresponse towards interfacial strain and electric fields. An approach that\nprovides atomic-scale resolution and sensitivity towards the local octahedral\ndistortions and orbital occupancy is therefore required. Here, we employ\natomic-resolution imaging coupled with electron spectroscopies and first\nprinciples theory to examine the role of interfacial charge transfer and\nsymmetry breaking in a tricomponent nickelate superlattice system. We find that\nnearly complete charge transfer occurs between the LaTiO$_3$ and LaNiO$_3$\nlayers, resulting in a Ni$^{2+}$ valence state. We further demonstrate that\nthis charge transfer is highly localized with a range of about 1 unit cell,\nwithin the LaNiO$_3$ layers. The results presented here provide important\nfeedback to synthesis efforts aimed at stabilizing new electronic phases that\nare not accessible by conventional bulk or epitaxial film approaches.\n", "  We report on {\\it ab-initio} simulations of the quantum dynamics of\nelectronic charge and spin when subjected to intense laser pulses. By\nperforming separate calculations for a Ni thin film and bulk Ni, we conclude\nthat surface effects have a dramatic influence on amplifying the laser induced\ndemagnetization. We show that the reason for this amplification is due to\nincreased spin-currents on the surface of the thin film. This enhancement is a\ndirect consequence of the broken symmetry originating from the surface\nformation. We find that the underlying physics of demagnetization, during the\nearly femtoseconds, for both bulk and thin film is dominated by spin-flips\ninduced by spin-orbit coupling. After the first $\\sim 40$ fs this changes in\nthat the dominant cause of demagnetization is the flow of spin-currents, which\nleads to stronger demagnetization in the film compared to that of the bulk.\n", "  In this work, we study how, with the aid of impurity engineering,\ntwo-dimensional $p$-wave superconductors can be employed as a platform for\none-dimensional topological phases. We discover that, while chiral and helical\nparent states themselves are topologically nontrivial, a chain of scalar\nimpurities on both systems support multiple topological phases and Majorana end\nstates. We develop an approach which allows us to extract the topological\ninvariants and subgap spectrum, even away from the center of the gap, for the\nrepresentative cases of spinless, chiral and helical superconductors. We find\nthat the magnitude of the topological gaps protecting the nontrivial phases may\nbe a significant fraction of the gap of the underlying superconductor.\n", "  We investigate the topological properties of dynamical states evolving on\nperiodic oriented graphs. This evolution, that encodes the scattering processes\noccurring at the nodes of the graph, is described by a single-step global\noperator, in the spirit of the Ho-Chalker model. When the successive scattering\nevents follow a cyclic sequence, the corresponding scattering network can be\nequivalently described by a discrete time-periodic unitary evolution, in line\nwith Floquet systems. Such systems may present anomalous topological phases\nwhere all the first Chern numbers are vanishing, but where protected edge\nstates appear in a finite geometry. To investigate the origin of such anomalous\nphases, we introduce the phase rotation symmetry, a generalization of usual\nsymmetries which only occurs in unitary systems (as opposed to Hamiltonian\nsystems). Equipped with this new tool, we explore a possible explanation of the\npervasiveness of anomalous phases in scattering network models, and we define\nbulk topological invariants suited to both equivalent descriptions of the\nnetwork model, which fully capture the topology of the system. We finally show\nthat the two invariants coincide, again through a phase rotation symmetry\narising from the particular structure of the network model.\n", "  An investigation is made into the effect of the reduction in anomalous\nperpendicular electron heat transport inside the separatrix of a magnetic\nisland chain associated with a neoclassical tearing mode in a tokamak plasma,\ndue to the flattening of the electron temperature profile in this region, on\nthe overall stability of the mode. The onset of the neoclassical tearing mode\nis governed by the ratio of the divergences of the parallel and perpendicular\nelectron heat fluxes in the vicinity of the island chain. By increasing the\ndegree of transport reduction, the onset of the mode, as the divergence ratio\nis gradually increased, can be made more and more abrupt. Eventually, when the\ndegree of transport reduction passes a certain critical value, the onset of the\nneoclassical tearing mode becomes discontinuous. In other words, when some\ncritical value of the divergence ratio is reached, there is a sudden\nbifurcation to a branch of neoclassical tearing mode solutions. Moreover, once\nthis bifurcation has been triggered, the divergence ratio must reduced by a\nsubstantial factor to trigger the inverse bifurcation.\n", "  We study four types of one-point torus blocks arising in the large central\ncharge regime. According to different limits of conformal dimensions we\ndistinguish between the global block, the light block, the heavy-light block,\nand the linearized classical block. We show that they are not independent and\nconnected to each other by various links. We find that the global, light, and\nheavy-light blocks correspond to three different contractions of the Virasoro\nalgebra. Also, we formulate the c-recursive representation of the one-point\ntorus blocks which is relevant in the semiclassical approximation.\n", "  Many biological and chemical systems could be modeled by a population of\noscillators coupled indirectly via a dynamical environment. Essentially, the\nenvironment by which the individual elements communicate is heterogeneous.\nNevertheless, most of previous works considered the homogeneous case only.\nHere, we investigated the dynamical behaviors in a population of spatially\ndistributed chaotic oscillators immersed in a heterogeneous environment.\nVarious dynamical synchronization states such as oscillation death, phase\nsynchronization, and complete synchronized oscillation as well as their\ntransitions were found. More importantly, we uncovered a non-traditional quorum\nsensing transition: increasing the density would first lead to collective\noscillation from oscillation quench, but further increasing the population\ndensity would lead to degeneration from complete synchronization to phase\nsynchronization or even from phase synchronization to desynchronization. The\nunderlying mechanism of this finding was attributed to the dual roles played by\nthe population density. Further more, by treating the indirectly coupled\nsystems effectively to the system with directly local coupling, we applied the\nmaster stability function approach to predict the occurrence of the complete\nsynchronized oscillation, which were in agreement with the direct numerical\nsimulations of the full system. The possible candidates of the experimental\nrealization on our model was also discussed.\n", "  We examine the observability of heavy neutrino (nu_h) signatures of a U(1)'\nenlarged Standard Model (SM) encompassing three heavy Majorana neutrinos\nalongside the known light neutrino states at the the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC). We show that heavy neutrinos can be rather long-lived particles\nproducing distinctive displaced vertices that can be accessed in the CERN LHC\ndetectors. We concentrate here on the gluon fusion production mechanism gg ->\nH_{1,2} -> nu_h nu_h, where H_1 is the discovered SM-like Higgs and H_2 is a\nheavier state, yielding displaced leptons following nu_h decays into weak gauge\nbosons. Using data collected by the end of the LHC Run 2, these signatures\nwould prove to be accessible with negligibly small background.\n", "  Following the detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos in 2013, their\norigin is still unknown. Aiming for the identification of an electromagnetic\ncounterpart of a rapidly fading source, we have implemented a realtime analysis\nframework for the IceCube neutrino observatory. Several analyses selecting\nneutrinos of astrophysical origin are now operating in realtime at the detector\nsite in Antarctica and are producing alerts to the community to enable rapid\nfollow-up observations. The goal of these observations is to locate the\nastrophysical objects responsible for these neutrino signals. This paper\nhighlights the infrastructure in place both at the South Pole detector site and\nat IceCube facilities in the north that have enabled this fast follow-up\nprogram to be developed. Additionally, this paper presents the first realtime\nanalyses to be activated within this framework, highlights their sensitivities\nto astrophysical neutrinos and background event rates, and presents an outlook\nfor future discoveries.\n", "  We study the production of jets in hadronic collisions, by computing all\ncontributions proportional to $\\alpha_S^n\\alpha^m$, with $n+m=2$ and $n+m=3$.\nThese correspond to leading and next-to-leading order results, respectively,\nfor single-inclusive and dijet observables in a perturbative expansion that\nincludes both QCD and electroweak effects. We discuss issues relevant to the\ndefinition of hadronic jets in the context of electroweak corrections, and\npresent sample phenomenological predictions for the 13-TeV LHC. We find that\nboth the leading and next-to-leading order contributions largely respect the\nrelative hierarchy established by the respective coupling-constant\ncombinations.\n", "  In this paper we compute the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s \\alpha_t)$ threshold\ncorrections to the running strong coupling constant, the top-Yukawa coupling\nand the top-quark mass within the MSSM. These parameters present a\nnon-decoupling behaviour with the supersymmetry scale $M_{\\rm SUSY}$. Our\nnumerical analysis shows that the mixed QCD-Yukawa corrections can amount to\nfew GeV for the running top-quark mass and range at the percent level for the\ntop-Yukawa coupling.\n", "  Measurements of heavy (charm and beauty) quarks provide useful insights into\nthe properties of the quark--gluon plasma. The good particle identification\ncapabilities of ALICE make a measurement based on the electrons from\nsemi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons feasible. This approach makes use\nof the large branching ratios ($\\approx 10-20\\%$) of heavy--flavour hadrons\ninto electrons. Separation of the contribution from beauty-hadron decay\nelectrons was achieved by utilizing the large decay length of the associated\nhadrons, making the investigation of beauty quarks in the medium possible. By\ncomparing measurements in p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions, it is possible to\ndisentangle effects of cold nuclear matter from those of the hot and dense\nmedium. The results show a strong change in the transverse momentum\ndistribution of electrons from beauty-hadron decays in central Pb--Pb\ncollisions with respect to the proton--proton case. No significant change from\nproton--proton collisions can be seen in the p--Pb case, suggesting that the\nmodification is a final state effect.\n", "  Hamiltonian and action principle (HAP) formulations of plasma physics are\nreviewed for the purpose of explaining structure preserving numerical\nalgorithms. Geometric structures associated with and emergent from HAP\nformulations are discussed. These include conservative integration, which\nexactly conserves invariants, symplectic integration, which exactly preserves\nthe Hamiltonian geometric structure, and other Hamiltonian integration\ntechniques. Basic ideas of variational integration and Poisson integration,\nwhich can preserve noncanonical Hamiltonian structure, are discussed.\nMetriplectic integration, which preserves the structure of conservative systems\nwith both Hamiltonian and dissipative parts, is proposed. Two kinds of\nsimulated annealing, a relaxation technique for obtaining equilibrium states,\nare reviewed: one that uses metriplectic dynamics, which maximizes an entropy\nat fixed energy, the other that uses double bracket dynamics, which preserves\nCasimir invariants. Throughout, applications to plasma systems are emphasized.\nThe paper culminates with a discussion of GEMPIC [Kraus et al.,\narXiv:1609.03053v1 [math.NA] (2016)], a particle in cell code that incorporates\nHamiltonian and geometrical structure preserving properties.\n", "  Collider signals of heavy Majorana neutrino mass origin are studied in the\nminimal Left-Right symmetric model, where their mass is generated spontaneously\ntogether with the breaking of lepton number. The right-handed triplet Higgs\nboson $\\Delta$, responsible for such breaking, can be copiously produced at the\nLHC through the Higgs portal in the gluon fusion and less so in gauge mediated\nchannels. At $\\Delta$ masses below the opening of the $VV$ decay channel, the\ntwo observable modes are pair-production of heavy neutrinos via the triplet\ngluon fusion $gg \\to \\Delta \\to NN$ and pair production of triplets from the\nHiggs $h \\to \\Delta \\Delta \\to 4N$ decay. The latter features tri- and quad\nsame-sign lepton final states that break lepton number by four units and have\nno significant background. In both cases up to four displaced vertices may be\npresent and their displacement may serve as a discriminating variable. The\nbackgrounds at the LHC, including the jet fake rate, are estimated and the\nresulting sensitivity to the Left-Right breaking scale extends well beyond 10\nTeV. In addition, sub-dominant radiative modes are surveyed: the $\\gamma\n\\gamma$, $Z \\gamma$ and lepton flavour violating ones. Finally, prospects for\n$\\Delta$ signals at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders are presented.\n", "  We present the results of clustering analyses of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs)\nat $z\\sim3$, $4$, and $5$ using the final data release of the\nCanada--France--Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). Deep- and wide-field\nimages of the CFHTLS Deep Survey enable us to obtain sufficiently accurate\ntwo-point angular correlation functions to apply a halo occupation distribution\nanalysis. Mean halo masses, calculated as $\\langle M_{h}\n\\rangle=10^{11.7}-10^{12.8}h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$, increase with stellar-mass limit\nof LBGs. The threshold halo mass to have a central galaxy follows the same\nincreasing trend with the low-$z$ results, whereas the threshold halo mass to\nhave a satellite galaxy shows higher values at $z=3-5$ than $z=0.5-1.5$ over\nthe entire stellar mass range. Satellite fractions of dropout galaxies, even at\nless massive haloes, are found to drop sharply from $z=2$ down to less than\n$0.04$ at $z=3-5$. These results suggest that satellite galaxies form\ninefficiently within dark haloes at $z=3-5$ even for less massive satellites\nwith $M_{\\star}<10^{10}M_{\\odot}$. We compute stellar-to-halo mass ratios\n(SHMRs) assuming a main sequence of galaxies, which is found to provide\nconsistent SHMRs with those derived from a spectral energy distribution fitting\nmethod. The observed SHMRs are in good agreement with the model predictions\nbased on the abundance-matching method within $1\\sigma$ confidence intervals.\nWe derive observationally, for the first time, $M_{{\\rm h}}^{{\\rm pivot}}$,\nwhich is the halo mass at a peak in the star-formation efficiency, at $3<z<5$,\nand it shows a little increasing trend with cosmic time at $z>3$. In addition,\n$M_{{\\rm h}}^{{\\rm pivot}}$ and its normalization are found to be almost\nunchanged during $0<z<5$. Our study shows an observational evidence that galaxy\nformation is ubiquitously most efficient near a halo mass of $M_{{\\rm\nh}}\\sim10^{12}M_{\\odot}$ over cosmic time.\n", "  We study the pre-equilibrium dipole response in the charge-asymmetric\nreaction $^{132}$Sn+$^{58}$Ni at $E_{lab}=10$ MeV/A, within a semi-classical\ntransport model employing effective interactions for the nuclear mean-field. In\nparticular, we adopt the recently introduced SAMi-J Skyrme interactions, whose\nparameters are specifically tuned to improve the description of spin-isospin\nproperties of nuclei. Within the same framework, we also discuss\npre-equilibrium nucleon emission. Our results show that both mechanisms, i.e.,\npre-equilibrium dipole oscillations and nucleon emission, are sensitive to the\nsymmetry energy below the saturation density $\\rho_0$ (in the range\n$0.6\\rho_0-\\rho_0$), to the effective mass and to the nucleon-nucleon cross\nsection. Finally, a covariant analysis is applied to study the correlations\nbetween the model parameters and observables of experimental interest.\n", "  A method for alignment of a vector magnetometer to a rigidly attached prism\nis presented. This enables optical comparison of the magnetometer axes to\nphysical surfaces in an apparatus, and thus an absolute determination of the\nmagnetic field direction in space. This is in contrast with more common\ntechniques, which focus on precise determination of the relative angles between\nmagnetometer axes, and so are more suited to measuring differences in the\ndirection of magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate precision better than 500\n$\\mu$rad on a fluxgate magnetometer, which also gives the coil orthogonality\nerrors to a similar precision. The relative sensitivity of the 3 axes is also\ndetermined, with precision of about 5$\\times 10^{-4}$.\n", "  In a recent paper [17], we studied the evolution of the background geometry\nand scalar perturbations in an inflationary, spatially closed\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model having constant positive\nspatial curvature and spatial topology $\\mathbb S^3$. Due to the spatial\ncurvature, the early phase of slow-roll inflation is modified, leading to\nsuppression of power in the scalar power spectrum at large angular scales. In\nthis paper, we extend the analysis to include tensor perturbations. We find\nthat --- similarly to the scalar perturbations --- the tensor power spectrum\nalso shows power suppression for long wavelength modes. The correction to the\ntensor spectrum is limited to the very long wavelength modes, therefore the\nresulting observable CMB B-mode polarization spectrum remains practically the\nsame as in the standard scenario with flat spatial sections. However, since\nboth the tensor and scalar power spectra are modified, there are scale\ndependent corrections to the tensor-to-scalar ratio that lead to violation of\nthe standard slow-roll consistency relation.\n", "  Dirac fermion dark matter models with heavy $Z^{\\prime}$ mediators are\nsubject to stringent constraints from spin-independent direct searches and from\nLHC bounds, cornering them to live near the $Z^{\\prime}$ resonance. Such\nconstraints can be relaxed, however, by turning off the vector coupling to\nStandard Model fermions, thus weakening direct detection bounds, or by\nresorting to light $Z^{\\prime}$ masses, below the Z pole, to escape heavy\nresonance searches at the LHC. In this work we investigate both cases, as well\nas the applicability of our findings to Majorana dark matter. We derive\ncollider bounds for light $Z^{\\prime}$ gauge bosons using the $CL_S$ method,\nspin-dependent scattering limits, as well as the spin-independent scattering\nrate arising from the evolution of couplings between the energy scale of the\nmediator mass and the nuclear energy scale, and indirect detection limits. We\nshow that such scenarios are still rather constrained by data, and that near\nresonance they could accommodate the gamma-ray GeV excess in the Galactic\ncenter.\n", "  Singular potentials (the inverse-square potential, for example) arise in many\nsituations and their quantum treatment leads to well-known ambiguities in\nchoosing boundary conditions for the wave-function at the position of the\npotential's singularity. These ambiguities are usually resolved by developing a\nself-adjoint extension of the original problem; a non-unique procedure that\nleaves undetermined which extension should apply in specific physical systems.\nWe take the guesswork out of this picture by using techniques of effective\nfield theory to derive the required boundary conditions at the origin in terms\nof the effective point-particle action describing the physics of the source. In\nthis picture ambiguities in boundary conditions boil down to the allowed\nchoices for the source action, but casting them in terms of an action provides\na physical criterion for their determination. The resulting extension is\nself-adjoint if the source action is real (and involves no new degrees of\nfreedom), and not otherwise (as can also happen for reasonable systems). We\nshow how this effective-field picture provides a simple framework for\nunderstanding well-known renormalization effects that arise in these systems,\nincluding how renormalization-group techniques can resum non-perturbative\ninteractions that often arise, particularly for non-relativistic applications.\nIn particular we argue why the low-energy effective theory tends to produce a\nuniversal RG flow of this type and describe how this can lead to the phenomenon\nof reaction {\\em catalysis}, in which physical quantities (like scattering\ncross sections) can sometimes be surprisingly large compared to the underlying\nscales of the source in question. We comment in passing on the possible\nrelevance of these observations to the phenomenon of the catalysis of\nbaryon-number violation by scattering from magnetic monopoles.\n", "  We investigate the approach of pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory with the\nWilson action to its continuum limit using the deconfining phase transition,\nthe gradient flow and the cooling flow to set the scale. For the gradient and\ncooling scales we explore three different energy observables and two distinct\nreference values for the flow time. When the aim is to follow scaling towards\nthe continuum limit, one gains at least a factor of 100 in computational\nefficiency by relying on the gradient instead of the deconfinement scale. Using\ncooling instead of the gradient flow one gains another factor of at least 34 in\ncomputational efficiency on the gradient flow part without any significant loss\nin the accuracy of scale setting. Concerning our observables, the message is to\nkeep it simple. The Wilson action itself performs as well as or even better\nthan the other two observables explored. Two distinct fitting forms for scaling\nare compared of which one connects to asymptotic scaling. Differences of the\nobtained estimates show that systematic errors of length ratios, though only\nabout 1%, can be considerably larger than statistical errors of the same\nobservables.\n", "  The current status of photon and dilepton emission in ultra-relativistic\nheavy ion collisions is reviewed, and recent developments are highlighted. The\nimportance of emissions at early, intermediate and late times is emphasized.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive analysis of scalar contributions in $b \\to c \\tau\n\\nu$ transitions including the latest measurements of $R(D^{(*)})$, the $q^2$\ndifferential distributions in $B \\to D^{(*)} \\tau \\nu$, the $\\tau$ polarization\nasymmetry for $B \\to D^{*} \\tau \\nu$, and the bound derived from the total\nwidth of the $B_c$ meson. We find that scalar contributions with the\nsimultaneous presence of both left- and right-handed couplings to quarks can\nexplain the available data, specifically $R(D^{(*)})$ together with the\nmeasured differential distributions. However, the constraints from the total\n$B_c$ width present a slight tension with the current data on $B \\to D^{*}\\tau\n\\nu$ in this scenario, preferring smaller values for $R(D^*)$. We discuss\npossibilities to disentangle scalar new physics from other new-physics\nscenarios like the presence of only a left-handed vector current, via\nadditional observables in $B \\to D^{(*)}\\tau \\nu$ decays or additional decay\nmodes like the baryonic $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c \\tau \\nu$ and the inclusive $B\n\\to X_c \\tau \\nu$ decays. We also analyze scalar contributions in $b \\to u \\tau\n\\nu$ transitions, including the latest measurements of $B \\to \\tau \\nu$,\nproviding predictions for $\\Lambda_b \\to p \\tau \\nu$ and $B \\to \\pi \\tau \\nu$\ndecays. The potential complementarity between the $b \\to u$ and $b \\to c$\nsectors is finally investigated once assumptions about the flavour structure of\nthe underlying theory are made.\n", "  We present a new formalism for understanding the optical properties of\nmetasurfaces, optically thin composite diffractive devices. The proposed\ntechnique, Rigorous Diffraction Interface Theory (R-DIT), provides an\nanalytical framework for understanding the transition between optically thin\nand optically thick structures. For metasurfaces, R-DIT avoids the calculation\nof optical propagation through thin layer and provides a direct link between\nthe composition and geometry of a metasurface and its transmission, reflection,\nand diffraction properties.\n", "  A plethora of ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model have extra U(1)\ngauge symmetries. In general, the associated massive $Z^\\prime$ gauge boson can\nmediate flavor-changing neutral current processes at tree level. We consider a\nsituation where the $Z^\\prime$ boson couples solely via flavor-changing\ninteractions to quarks and leptons. In this scenario the model parameter space\nis, in general, quite well constrained by existing flavor bounds. However, we\nargue that cancellation effects shelter islands in parameter space from strong\nflavor constraints and that these can be probed by multipurpose collider\nexperiments like ATLAS or CMS as well as LHCb in upcoming runs at the LHC. In\nstill allowed regions of parameter space these scenarios may help to explain\nthe current tension between theory and experiment of $(g-2)_\\mu$ as well as a\nsmall anomaly in $\\tau$ decays.\n", "  We derive a number of exact relations between response functions of\nholomorphic, chiral fractional quantum Hall states and their particle-hole (PH)\nconjugates. These exact relations allow one to calculate the Hall conductivity,\nHall viscosity, various Berry phases, and the static structure factor of\nPH-conjugate states from the corresponding properties of the original states.\nThese relations establish a precise duality between chiral quantum Hall states\nand their PH-conjugates. The key ingredient in the proof of the relations is a\ngeneralization of Girvin's construction of PH-conjugate states to inhomogeneous\nmagnetic field and curvature. Finally, we make several non-trivial checks of\nthe relations, including for the Jain states and their PH-conjugates.\n", "  We clarify the role of the dual coordinates as described from the\nperspectives of the Buscher T-duality rules and Double Field Theory. We show\nthat the T-duality angular dual coordinates cannot be identified with Double\nField Theory dual coordinates in any of the proposals that have been made in\nthe literature for patching the doubled spaces. In particular, we show with\nexplicit examples that the T-duality angular dual coordinates can have\nnon-trivial transition functions over a spacetime and that their identification\nwith the Double Field Theory dual coordinates is in conflict with proposals in\nwhich the latter remain inert under the patching of the B-field. We then\ndemonstrate that the Double Field Theory coordinates can be identified with\nsome C-space coordinates and that the T-dual spaces of a spacetime are\nsubspaces of the gerbe in C-space. The construction provides a description of\nboth the local $O(d,d)$ symmetry and the T-dual spaces of spacetime.\n", "  We show that solving the flavor problem of the Standard Model with a simple\n$U(1)_H$ flavor symmetry naturally leads to an axion that solves the strong CP\nproblem and constitutes a viable Dark Matter candidate. In this framework, the\nratio of the axion mass and its coupling to photons is related to the SM\nfermion masses and predicted within a small range, as a direct result of the\nobserved hierarchies in quark and charged lepton masses. The same hierarchies\ndetermine the axion couplings to fermions, making the framework very predictive\nand experimentally testable by future axion and precision flavor experiments.\n", "  The recently developed energy conserving semi-implicit method (ECsim) for PIC\nsimulation is applied to multiple scale problems where the electron-scale\nphysics needs to be only partially retained and the interest is on the\nmacroscopic or ion-scale processes. Unlike hybrid methods, the ECsim is capable\nof providing kinetic electron information, such as wave-electron interaction\n(Landau damping or cyclotron resonance) and non-Maxwellian electron velocity\ndistributions. However, like hybrid, the ECsim does not need to resolve all\nelectron scales, allowing time steps and grid spacing orders of magnitude\nlarger than in explicit PIC schemes. The additional advantage of the ECsim is\nthat the stability at large scale is obtained while conserving energy exactly.\nThree examples are presented: ion acoustic waves, electron acoustic instability\nand reconnection processes.\n", "  Interfaces play an essential role in phonon-mediated heat conduction in\nsolids, impacting applications ranging from thermoelectric waste heat recovery\nto heat dissipation in electronics. From the microscopic perspective,\ninterfacial phonon transport is described by transmission coefficients that\nlink vibrational modes in the materials composing the interface. However,\ndirect experimental determination of these coefficients is challenging because\nmost experiments provide a mode-averaged interface conductance that obscures\nthe microscopic detail. Here, we report a metrology to extract thermal phonon\ntransmission coefficients at solid interfaces using ab-initio phonon transport\nmodeling and a thermal characterization technique, time-domain\nthermoreflectance. In combination with transmission electron microscopy\ncharacterization of the interface, our approach allows us to link the atomic\nstructure of an interface to the spectral content of the heat crossing it. Our\nwork provides a useful perspective on the microscopic processes governing\ninterfacial heat conduction.\n", "  We present numerical results for rate coefficients of reaction and\nvibrational quenching in the collision of H with D$_2(v,j)$ at cold and\nultracold temperatures. We explore both ortho-D$_2(j\\!=\\!0)$ and\npara-D$_2(j\\!=\\!1)$ for several initial vibrational states $(v\\leq 5)$, and\nfind resonant structures in the energy range 0.01--10 kelvin, which are\nsensitive to the initial rovibrational state $(v,j)$. We compare the reaction\nrates for D$_2$+H with our previously obtained results for the isotopologue\nreaction H$_2$+D, and discuss the implications of our detailed study of this\nbenchmark system for ultracold chemistry.\n", "  By monitoring the sampling of states with different magnetizations in\ntransition matrix procedures a family of accurate and easily implemented\ntechniques are constructed that automatically control the variation of the\ntemperature or energy as the calculation proceeds. The accuracy of the method\nfor a single Markov chain exceeds that of standard transition matrix procedures\nthat accumulate elements from multiple chains.\n", "  We investigate the stability of conducting and insulating phases in\nmultichannel Luttinger liquids with respect to embedding a single impurity. We\ndevise a general approach for finding critical exponents of the conductance in\nthe limits of both weak and strong scattering. In contrast to the one-channel\nLuttinger liquid, the system state in certain parametric regions depends on the\nscattering strength which results in the emergence of a bistability. Focusing\non the two-channel liquid, the method developed here enables us to provide a\ngeneric analysis of phase boundaries governed by the most relevant (i.e. not\nnecessarily single-particle) scattering mechanism. The present approach is\napplicable to channels of different nature as in fermion-boson mixtures, or to\nidentical ones as on the opposite edges of a topological insulator. We show\nthat interaction per se cannot provide protection in particular case of\ntopological insulators realized in narrow Hall bars.\n", "  This paper investigates scalar perturbations in the top-down supersymmetric\nJanus solutions dual to conformal interfaces in the $D1/D5$ CFT, finding\nanalytic closed-form solutions. We obtain an explicit representation of the\nbulk-to-bulk propagator and extract the two-point correlation function of the\ndual operator with itself, whose form is not fixed by symmetry alone. We give\nan expression involving the sum of conformal blocks associated with the\nbulk-defect operator product expansion and briefly discuss finite-temperature\nextensions. To our knowledge, this is the first two-point function computation\nfor a fully-backreacted, top-down holographic defect.\n", "  Wave-driven outflows and non-disruptive explosions have been implicated in\npre-supernova outbursts, supernova impostors, LBV eruptions, and some\nnarrow-line and superluminous supernovae. To model these events, we investigate\nthe dynamics of stars set in motion by strong acoustic pulses and wave trains,\nfocusing here on nonlinear wave propagation, shock formation, and an early\nphase of the development of a weak shock. We identify the shock formation\nradius, showing that a heuristic estimate based on crossing characteristics\nmatches an exact expansion around the wave front and verifying both with\nnumerical experiments. Our general analytical condition for shock formation\napplies to one-dimensional motions within any static environment, including\nboth eruptions and implosions, and can easily be extended to non-stationary\nflows. We also consider the early phase of shock energy dissipation. We find\nthat waves of super-Eddington acoustic luminosity always create shocks, rather\nthan damping by radiative diffusion. Therefore, shock formation is integral to\nsuper-Eddington outbursts.\n", "  An accurate expression for the exchange-correlation free energy f_{xc} of\nhomogeneous electron fluids at finite temperatures is presented on the basis of\nSingwi-Tosi-Land-Sjolander (STLS) approximation. In addition to the derivation\nfor the paramagnetic state, that for the ferromagnetic state is newly carried\nout in which a correction in the strong Coulomb coupling regime is incorporated\ninto the construction of analytic expression as a function of the coupling\nconstant and the Fermi degeneracy. The fitting formula for f_{xc} is then\nextended over any degree of spin polarization with the aid of available\ninterpolation scheme. The proposed equation of state, called iSTLS formula,\nshows reasonable agreements with the existing quantum Monte Carlo evaluations\nat finite temperatures in the paramagnetic state, thus giving a consensus for\nthe thermodynamic functions between many-body theories and computer\nsimulations. On the other hand, the current status for the agreement among\nvarious evaluations of f_{xc} is relatively unsatisfactory in the ferromagnetic\nstate, suggesting the necessity of further investigations.\n", "  In this work we perform an analysis of the recent AMS-02 antiproton flux and\nthe antiproton-to-proton ratio in the framework of simplified dark matter\nmodels. To predict the AMS-02 observables we adopt the propagation and\ninjection parameters determined by the observed fluxes of nuclei. We assume\nthat the dark matter particle is a Dirac fermionic dark matter, with\nleptophobic pseudoscalar or axialvector mediator that couples only to Standard\nModel quarks and dark matter particles. We find that the AMS-02 observations\nare consistent with the dark matter hypothesis within the uncertainties. The\nantiproton data prefer a dark matter (mediator) mass in the 700 GeV--5 TeV\nregion for the annihilation with pseudoscalar mediator and greater than 700 GeV\n(200 GeV--1 TeV) for the annihilation with axialvector mediator, respectively,\nat about 68% confidence level. The AMS-02 data require an effective dark matter\nannihilation cross section in the region of 1x10^{-25} -- 1x10^{-24}\n(1x10^{-25} -- 4x10^{-24}) cm^3/s for the simplified model with pseudoscalar\n(axialvector) mediator. The constraints from the LHC and Fermi-LAT are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Using images from the SDSS DR13 library, we examine the structural properties\nof 374 bright (classed E0 to E6) and dwarf ellipticals (classed dE(nN) to\ndE(N)). The sample combines a multicolor sample of bright ellipticals (252\ngalaxies with $M_g < -20$) with a new sample of faint ellipticals (60 galaxies\nwith $M_g > -20$) which overlaps the dwarf elliptical sample (62 galaxies) in\nluminosity and size. The faint ellipticals extend the linear structural\ncorrelations found for bright ellipticals into parameter space not occupied by\ndwarf ellipticals indicating a dichotomy exists between the two types. In\nparticular, many faint ellipticals have significantly higher effective surface\nbrightnesses compared to dE's which eliminates any connection at a set stellar\nmass. Template analysis of the three subsets of ellipticals demonstrates that\nthe bright and faint ellipticals follow the same trends of profile shape (weak\nhomology), but that dwarf ellipticals form a separate and distinct structural\nclass with lower central surface brightnesses and extended isophotal radii.\n", "  We propose a bio-inspired, agent-based approach to describe the natural\nphenomenon of group chasing in both two and three dimensions. Using a set of\nlocal interaction rules we created a continuous-space and discrete-time model\nwith time delay, external noise and limited acceleration. We implemented a\nunique collective chasing strategy, optimized its parameters and studied its\nproperties when chasing a much faster, erratic escaper. We show that collective\nchasing strategies can significantly enhance the chasers' success rate. Our\nrealistic approach handles group chasing within closed, soft boundaries -\ncontrasting most of those published in the literature with periodic ones -- and\nresembles several properties of pursuits observed in nature, such as the\nemergent encircling or the escaper's zigzag motion.\n", "  The formation of a singularity in a compressible gas, as described by the\nEuler equation, is characterized by the steepening, and eventual overturning of\na wave. Using a self-similar description in two space dimensions, we show that\nthe spatial structure of this process, which starts at a point, is equivalent\nto the formation of a caustic, i.e. to a cusp catastrophe. The lines along\nwhich the profile has infinite slope correspond to the caustic lines, from\nwhich we construct the position of the shock. By solving the similarity\nequation, we obtain a complete local description of wave steepening and of the\nspreading of the shock from a point.\n", "  We present the first surrogate model for gravitational waveforms from the\ncoalescence of precessing binary black holes. We call this surrogate model\nNRSur4d2s. Our methodology significantly extends recently introduced\nreduced-order and surrogate modeling techniques, and is capable of directly\nmodeling numerical relativity waveforms without introducing phenomenological\nassumptions or approximations to general relativity. Motivated by GW150914,\nLIGO's first detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes, the\nmodel is built from a set of $276$ numerical relativity (NR) simulations with\nmass ratios $q \\leq 2$, dimensionless spin magnitudes up to $0.8$, and the\nrestriction that the initial spin of the smaller black hole lies along the axis\nof orbital angular momentum. It produces waveforms which begin $\\sim 30$\ngravitational wave cycles before merger and continue through ringdown, and\nwhich contain the effects of precession as well as all $\\ell \\in \\{2, 3\\}$\nspin-weighted spherical-harmonic modes. We perform cross-validation studies to\ncompare the model to NR waveforms \\emph{not} used to build the model, and find\na better agreement within the parameter range of the model than other,\nstate-of-the-art precessing waveform models, with typical mismatches of\n$10^{-3}$. We also construct a frequency domain surrogate model (called\nNRSur4d2s_FDROM) which can be evaluated in $50\\, \\mathrm{ms}$ and is suitable\nfor performing parameter estimation studies on gravitational wave detections\nsimilar to GW150914.\n", "  This is the first of two subsequent publications where the probability\ndistribution of delay-times in scattering of wave packets is discussed. The\nprobability distribution is expressed in terms of the on-shell scattering\nmatrix, the dispersion relation of the scattered beam and the wave packet\nenvelope. In the monochromatic limit (poor time resolution) the mean delay-time\ncoincides with the expression derived by Eisenbud and Wigner and generalized by\nSmith more than half a century ago. In the opposite limit, and within the\nsemi-classical approximation, the resulting distribution coincides with the\nresult obtained using classical mechanics or geometrical optics. The general\nexpression interpolates smoothly between the two extremes. An application for\nthe scattering of electromagnetic waves in networks of RF transmission lines\nwill be discussed in the next paper to illustrate the method in an\nexperimentally relevant context.\n", "  Motivated by a model proposed by Peng et al. [Advances in Coll. and Interf.\nSci. 206 (2014)] for break-up of tear films on human eyes, we study the\ndynamics of a generalized thin film model. The governing equations form a\nfourth-order coupled system of nonlinear parabolic PDE for the film thickness\nand salt concentration subject to non-conservative effects representing\nevaporation. We analytically prove the global existence of solutions to this\nmodel with mobility exponents in several different ranges and the results are\nthen validated against PDE simulations. We also numerically capture other\ninteresting dynamics of the model, including finite-time rupture-shock\nphenomenon due to the instabilities caused by locally elevated evaporation\nrates, convergence to equilibrium and infinite-time thinning.\n", "  Many extensions of Standard Model (SM) include a dark sector which can\ninteract with the SM sector via a light mediator. We explore the possibilities\nto probe such a dark sector by studying the distortion of the CMB spectrum from\nthe blackbody shape due to the elastic scatterings between the dark matter and\nbaryons through a hidden light mediator. We in particular focus on the model\nwhere the dark sector gauge boson kinetically mixes with the SM and present the\nfuture experimental prospect for a PIXIE-like experiment along with its\ncomparison to the existing bounds from complementary terrestrial experiments.\n", "  We address the problem of long-range memory in the financial markets. There\nare two conceptually different ways to reproduce power-law decay of\nauto-correlation function: using fractional Brownian motion as well as\nnon-linear stochastic differential equations. In this contribution we address\nthis problem by analyzing empirical return and trading activity time series\nfrom the Forex. From the empirical time series we obtain probability density\nfunctions of burst and inter-burst duration. Our analysis reveals that the\npower-law exponents of the obtained probability density functions are close to\n$3/2$, which is a characteristic feature of the one-dimensional stochastic\nprocesses. This is in a good agreement with earlier proposed model of absolute\nreturn based on the non-linear stochastic differential equations derived from\nthe agent-based herding model.\n", "  We develop a microscopic theory of a strong electromagnetic field interaction\nwith gated bilayer graphene. Quantum kinetic equations for density matrix are\nobtained using a tight binding approach within second quantized Hamiltonian in\nan intense laser field. We show that adiabatically changing the gate potentials\nwith time may produce (at resonant photon energy) a full inversion of the\nelectron population with high density between valence and conduction bands. In\nthe linear regime, excitonic absorption of an electromagnetic radiation in a\ngraphene monolayer with opened energy gap is also studied.\n", "  If QCD axions form a large fraction of the total mass of dark matter, then\naxion stars could be very abundant in galaxies. As a result, collisions with\neach other, and with other astrophysical bodies, can occur. We calculate the\nrate and analyze the consequences of three classes of collisions, those\noccurring between a dilute axion star and: another dilute axion star, an\nordinary star, or a neutron star. In all cases we attempt to quantify the most\nimportant astrophysical uncertainties; we also pay particular attention to\nscenarios in which collisions lead to collapse of otherwise stable axion stars,\nand possible subsequent decay through number changing interactions. Collisions\nbetween two axion stars can occur with a high total rate, but the low relative\nvelocity required for collapse to occur leads to a very low total rate of\ncollapses. On the other hand, collisions between an axion star and an ordinary\nstar have a large rate, $\\Gamma_\\odot \\sim 3000$ collisions/year/galaxy, and\nfor sufficiently heavy axion stars, it is plausible that most or all such\ncollisions lead to collapse. We identify in this case a parameter space which\nhas a stable region and a region in which collision triggers collapse, which\ndepend on the axion number ($N$) in the axion star, and a ratio of mass to\nradius cubed characterizing the ordinary star ($M_s/R_s^3$). Finally, we\nrevisit the calculation of collision rates between axion stars and neutron\nstars, improving on previous estimates by taking cylindrical symmetry of the\nneutron star distribution into account. Collapse and subsequent decay through\ncollision processes, if occurring with a significant rate, can affect dark\nmatter phenomenology and the axion star mass distribution.\n", "  Given a Wigner distribution simultaneously characterizing quark transverse\npositions and momenta in a proton, one can directly evaluate their\ncross-product, i.e., quark orbital angular momentum. The aforementioned\ndistribution can be obtained by generalizing the proton matrix elements of\nquark bilocal operators which define transverse momentum-dependent parton\ndistributions (TMDs); the transverse momentum information is supplemented with\ntransverse position information by introducing an additional nonzero momentum\ntransfer. A gauge connection between the quarks must be specified in the quark\nbilocal operators; the staple-shaped gauge link path used in TMD calculations\nyields the Jaffe-Manohar definition of orbital angular momentum, whereas a\nstraight path yields the Ji definition. An exploratory lattice calculation,\nperformed at the pion mass m_pi = 518 MeV, is presented which\nquasi-continuously interpolates between the two definitions and demonstrates\nthat their difference can be clearly resolved. The resulting Ji orbital angular\nmomentum is confronted with traditional evaluations based on Ji's sum rule.\nJaffe-Manohar orbital angular momentum is enhanced in magnitude compared to its\nJi counterpart.\n", "  We investigate the chemical bonding characteristics of the transition metal\ndichalcogenides based on their static and dynamical atomic charges within\nDensity Functional Theory. The dynamical charges of the trigonal transition\nmetal dichalcogenides are anomalously large, while in their hexagonal\ncounterparts, their sign is even counterintuitive i.e. the transition metal\ntakes the negative charge. This phenomenon cannot be understood simply in terms\nof a change in the static atomic charge as it results from a local change of\npolarization. We present our theoretical understanding of these phenomena based\non the perturbative response of the system to a static electric field and by\ninvestigating the hybridization of the molecular orbitals near the Fermi level.\nFurthermore, we establish a link between the sign of the Born effective charge\nand the $\\pi$-backbonding in organic chemistry and propose an experimental\nprocedure to verify the calculated sign of the dynamical charge in the\ntransition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  We present a first internal delensing of CMB maps, both in temperature and\npolarization, using the public foreground-cleaned (SMICA) Planck 2015 maps.\nAfter forming quadratic estimates of the lensing potential, we use the\ncorresponding displacement field to undo the lensing on the same data. We build\ndifferences of the delensed spectra to the original data spectra specifically\nto look for delensing signatures. After taking into account reconstruction\nnoise biases in the delensed spectra, we find an expected sharpening of the\npower spectrum acoustic peaks with a delensing efficiency of $29\\,\\%$ ($TT$)\n$25\\,\\%$ ($TE$) and $22\\,\\%$ ($EE$). The detection significance of the\ndelensing effects is very high in all spectra: $12\\,\\sigma$ in $EE$\npolarization; $18\\,\\sigma$ in $TE$; and $20\\,\\sigma$ in $TT$. The null\nhypothesis of no lensing in the maps is rejected at $26\\,\\sigma$. While direct\ndetection of the power in lensing $B$-modes themselves is not possible at high\nsignificance at Planck noise levels, we do detect (at $4.5\\,\\sigma$ under the\nnull hypothesis) delensing effects in the $B$-mode map, with $7\\,\\%$ reduction\nin lensing power. Our results provide a first demonstration of polarization\ndelensing, and generally of internal CMB delensing, and stand in agreement with\nthe baseline $\\Lambda$CDM Planck 2015 cosmology expectations.\n", "  Electric field control of magnetic structures, particularly topological\ndefects in magnetoelectric materials, draws a great attention in recent years,\nwhich has led to experimental success in creation and manipulation by electric\nfield of single magnetic defects, such as domain walls and skyrmions. In this\nwork we explore a scenario of electric field creation of another type of\ntopological defects -- magnetic vortices and antivortices, which are\ncharacteristic for materials with easy plane (XY) symmetry. Each magnetic\n(anti)vortex in magnetoelectric materials (such as type-II multiferroics)\npossesses a quantized magnetic and an electric charge, where the former is\nresponsible for interaction between vortices and the latter couples the\nvortices to electric field. This property of magnetic vortices opens a peculiar\npossibility of creation of magnetic vortex plasma by non-uniform electric\nfields. We show that the electric field, created by a cantilever tip, produces\na \"magnetic atom\" with a localized spatially ordered spot of vortices\n(\"nucleus\" of the atom) surrounded by antivortices (\"electronic shells\"). We\nanalytically find the vortex density distribution profile and temperature\ndependence of polarizability of this structure and confirm it numerically. We\nshow that electric polarizability of the \"magnetic atom\" depends on temperature\nas $\\alpha \\sim 1/T^{1-\\eta}$ ($\\eta>0$), which is consistent with Euclidean\nrandom matrix theory prediction.\n", "  Out of thermal equilibrium, an environment imposes effective mechanical\nforces on microscopical nanofabricated devices, chemical or biological systems.\nHere we address the question of how to calculate these forces together with the\nresponse of the system from the first principles. We show that an ideal\ngas-like environment, even near thermal equilibrium, can enforce a specific\nsteady state on the system by creating effective potentials in otherwise\nhomogeneous space. An example of stable and unstable rectifications of thermal\nfluctuations is presented using modified Feynman-Smoluchowski ratchet with two\ndegrees of freedom. Moreover, the stability of a steady configuration depends\non its chiral symmetry. The transition rate probabilities and the corresponding\nkinetic equations are derived for a complex mechanical system with arbitrary\ndegrees of freedom. This work therefore extends the applicability of mechanical\nsystems as a toy model playground of statistical physics for multiple degrees\nof freedom active and living matter.\n", "  We measured the magnetic resonance of rubidium atoms passing through periodic\nmagnetic fields generated by two types of multilayered transmission magnetic\ngrating. One of the gratings reported here was assembled by stacking four\nlayers of magnetic films so that the direction of magnetization alternated at\neach level. The other grating was assembled so that the magnetization at each\nlevel was aligned. For both types of grating, the experimental results were in\ngood agreement with our calculations. We studied the feasibility of extending\nthe frequency band of the grating and narrowing its resonance linewidth by\nperforming calculations. For magnetic resonance precision spectroscopy, we\nconclude that the multi-layered transmission magnetic grating can generate\nperiodic fields with narrower linewidths at higher frequencies when a larger\nnumber of layers is assembled at a shorter period length. Moreover, the\nfrequency band of this type of grating can potentially achieve frequencies of\nup to hundreds of PHz.\n", "  In this paper we study the shear viscosity temperature dependence of\n$SU(3)$--gluodynamics within lattice simulation. To do so, we measure the\ncorrelation functions of energy-momentum tensor in the range of temperatures\n$T/T_c\\in [0.9, 1.5]$. To extract the values of shear viscosity we used two\napproaches. The first one is to fit the lattice data with some physically\nmotivated ansatz for the spectral function with unknown parameters and then\ndetermine shear viscosity. The second approach is to apply the Backus-Gilbert\nmethod which allows to extract shear viscosity from the lattice data\nnonparametrically. The results obtained within both approaches agree with each\nother. Our results allow us to conclude that within the temperature range\n$T/T_c \\in [0.9, 1.5]$ SU(3)--gluodynamics reveals the properties of a strongly\ninteracting system, which cannot be described perturbatively, and has the ratio\n$\\eta/s$ close to the value ${1}/{4\\pi}$ in $N = 4$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory.\n", "  Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation with fluorescence\ndetection has emerged as a powerful method for the study of interacting systems\nof macromolecules. It combines picomolar sensitivity with high hydrodynamic\nresolution, and can be carried out with photoswitchable fluorophores for\nmulti-component discrimination, to determine the stoichiometry, affinity, and\nshape of macromolecular complexes with dissociation equilibrium constants from\npicomolar to micromolar. A popular approach for data interpretation is the\ndetermination of the binding affinity by isotherms of weight-average\nsedimentation coefficients, sw. A prevailing dogma in sedimentation analysis is\nthat the weight-average sedimentation coefficient from the transport method\ncorresponds to the signal- and population-weighted average of all species. We\nshow that this does not always hold true for systems that exhibit significant\nsignal changes with complex formation - properties that may be readily\nencountered in practice, e.g., from a change in fluorescence quantum yield.\nCoupled transport in the reaction boundary of rapidly reversible systems can\nmake significant contributions to the observed migration in a way that cannot\nbe accounted for in the standard population-based average. Effective particle\ntheory provides a simple physical picture for the reaction-coupled migration\nprocess. On this basis we develop a more general binding model that converges\nto the well-known form of sw with constant signals, but can account\nsimultaneously for hydrodynamic co-transport in the presence of changes in\nfluorescence quantum yield. We believe this will be useful when studying\ninteracting systems exhibiting fluorescence quenching, enhancement or Forster\nresonance energy transfer with transport methods.\n", "  Sub-arcsecond localization of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102\nrevealed its coincidence with a dwarf host galaxy and a steady (`quiescent')\nnon-thermal radio source. We show that the properties of the host galaxy are\nconsistent with those of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRB) and\nhydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Both LGRBs and SLSNe-I were\npreviously hypothesized to be powered by the electromagnetic spin-down of\nnewly-formed, strongly-magnetized neutron stars with millisecond birth rotation\nperiods (`millisecond magnetars'). This motivates considering a scenario\nwhereby the repeated bursts from FRB 121102 originate from a young magnetar\nremnant embedded within a young hydrogen-poor supernova remnant. Requirements\non the GHz free-free optical depth through the expanding supernova ejecta\n(accounting for photo-ionization by the rotationally-powered magnetar nebula),\nenergetic constraints on the bursts, and constraints on the size of the\nquiescent source all point to an age of less than a few decades to a century.\nThe quiescent radio source can be attributed to synchrotron emission from the\nshock interaction between the fast outer layer of the supernova ejecta with the\nsurrounding wind of the progenitor star, or from deeper within the magnetar\nwind nebula. Alternatively, the radio emission could be an orphan afterglow\nfrom an initially off-axis LGRB jet, though this might require the source to be\ntoo young. The young age of the source can be tested by searching for a time\nderivative of the dispersion measure and predicted fading of the quiescent\nradio source. We propose future tests of the SLSNe-I/LGRB/FRB connection, such\nas searches for FRBs from nearby SLSNe-I/LGRB on timescales of decades after\ntheir explosions.\n", "  The neutrinophilic two-Higgs-doublet model ($\\nu$2HDM) provides a natural way\nto generate tiny neutrino mass from interactions with the new doublet scalar\n$\\Phi_\\nu$ ($H^\\pm,~H,~A$) and singlet neutrinos $N_R$ of TeV scale. In this\npaper, we perform detailed simulations for the lepton number violating (LNV)\nsignatures at LHC arising from cascade decays of the new scalars and neutrinos\nwith the mass order $m_{N_R}<m_{\\Phi_\\nu}$. Under constraints from lepton\nflavor violating processes and direct collider searches, their decay properties\nare explored and lead to three types of LNV signatures: $2\\ell^\\pm\n4j+\\cancel{E}_T$, $3\\ell^\\pm 4j+\\cancel{E}_T$, and $3\\ell^\\pm\\ell^\\mp 4j$. We\nfind that the same-sign trilepton signature $3\\ell^\\pm4j+\\cancel{E}_T$ is quite\nunique and is the most promising discovery channel at the high-luminosity LHC.\nOur analysis also yields the $95\\%$ C.L. exclusion limits in the plane of the\n$\\Phi_\\nu$ and $N_R$ masses at 13 (14) TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity of\n100~(3000)/fb.\n", "  The bootstrap current and flow velocity of a low-collisionality stellarator\nplasma are calculated. As far as possible, the analysis is carried out in a\nuniform way across all low-collisionality regimes in general stellarator\ngeometry, assuming only that the confinement is good enough that the plasma is\napproximately in local thermodynamic equilibrium. It is found that conventional\nexpressions for the ion flow speed and bootstrap current in the\nlow-collisionality limit are accurate only in the $1/\\nu$-collisionality regime\nand need to be modified in the $\\sqrt{\\nu}$-regime. The correction due to\nfinite collisionality is also discussed and is found to scale as $\\nu^{2/5}$.\n", "  Using full micromagnetic simulations we calculate the spectra of\nferromagnetic resonance (FMR) for an iron (core-shell) nanocube and show that\nthe FMR characteristics are strongly size dependent. For instance, for a\n$40~$nm it is found that, in contrast to a macrospin picture, the spectrum of\nthe iron nanocube possesses two bands centered around $0.4~$T and $\\approx\n0.1~$T. The peaks originate from the surface anisotropy induced by the strong\ndemagnetizing fields (DMFs) of iron. Further simulations reveal that for\n$\\approx 20~$nm nanocubes the macrospin model becomes viable. Above $40~$nm we\nfind a broad band for FMR absorption. Our results point to possible\ninterpretations of existing FMR experimental observations for the system\nstudied here.\n", "  Due to their capability to reduce turbulent transport in magnetized plasmas,\nunderstanding the dynamics of zonal flows is an important problem in the fusion\nprogramme. Since the pioneering work by Rosenbluth and Hinton in axisymmetric\ntokamaks, it is known that studying the linear and collisionless relaxation of\nzonal flow perturbations gives valuable information and physical insight.\nRecently, the problem has been investigated in stellarators and it has been\nfound that in these devices the relaxation process exhibits a characteristic\nfeature: a damped oscillation. The frequency of this oscillation might be a\nrelevant parameter in the regulation of turbulent transport, and therefore its\nefficient and accurate calculation is important. Although an analytical\nexpression can be derived for the frequency, its numerical evaluation is not\nsimple and has not been exploited systematically so far. Here, a numerical\nmethod for its evaluation is considered, and the results are compared with\nthose obtained by calculating the frequency from gyrokinetic simulations. This\n\"semianalytical\" approach for the determination of the zonal-flow frequency\nreveals accurate and faster than the one based on gyrokinetic simulations.\n", "  It has been extensively demonstrated through first principles quantum\nmechanics calculations that water exhibits strong hydrogen bond cooperativity.\nClassical molecular simulation and statistical mechanics methods typically\nassume pairwise additivity, meaning they cannot account for these 3-body and\nhigher cooperative effects. In this document, we extend second order\nthermodynamic perturbation theory to correct for hydrogen bond cooperativity in\n4 site water. We show that the association theory gives substantially different\npredictions than the first order result, which does not include hydrogen bond\ncooperativity. By comparison to spectroscopy, neutron diffraction and molecular\nsimulation data, we show that the theory accurately predicts the hydrogen\nbonding structure of water as a function of temperature and density.\n", "  We present a theory to predict the structure and thermodynamics of mixtures\nof colloids of different diameters, building on our earlier work [J. Chem.\nPhys. 145, 074904 (2016)] that considered mixtures with all particles\nconstrained to have the same size. The patchy, solvent particles have\nshort-range directional interactions, while the solute particles have\nshort-range isotropic interactions. The hard-sphere mixture without any\nassociation site forms the reference fluid. An important ingredient within the\nmulti-body association theory is the description of clustering of the reference\nsolvent around the reference solute. Here we account for the physical,\nmulti-body clusters of the reference solvent around the reference solute in\nterms of occupancy statistics in a defined observation volume. These occupancy\nprobabilities are obtained from enhanced sampling simulations, but we also\npresent statistical mechanical models to estimate these probabilities with\nlimited simulation data. Relative to an approach that describes only up to\nthree-body correlations in the reference, incorporating the complete reference\ninformation better predicts the bonding state and thermodynamics of the\nphysical solute for a wide range of system conditions. Importantly, analysis of\nthe residual chemical potential of the infinitely dilute solute from molecular\nsimulation and theory shows that whereas the chemical potential is somewhat\ninsensitive to the description of the structure of the reference fluid the\nenergetic and entropic contributions are not, with the results from the\ncomplete reference approach being in better agreement with particle\nsimulations.\n", "  We study the influence of the complex topology of scale-free graphs on the\ndynamics of anti-coordination games (e.g. snowdrift games). These reference\nmodels are characterized by the coexistence (evolutionary stable mixed\nstrategy) of two competing species, say \"cooperators\" and \"defectors\", and, in\nfinite systems, by metastability and large-fluctuation-driven fixation. In this\nwork, we use extensive computer simulations and an effective diffusion\napproximation (in the weak selection limit) to determine under which\ncircumstances, depending on the individual-based update rules, the topology\ndrastically affects the long-time behavior of anti-coordination games. In\nparticular, we compute the variance of the number of cooperators in the\nmetastable state and the mean fixation time when the dynamics is implemented\naccording to the voter model (death-first/birth-second process) and the link\ndynamics (birth/death or death/birth at random). For the voter update rule, we\nshow that the scale-free topology effectively renormalizes the population size\nand as a result the statistics of observables depend on the network's degree\ndistribution. In contrast, such a renormalization does not occur with the link\ndynamics update rule and we recover the same behavior as on complete graphs.\n", "  Superconductivity in novel bismuth-sulphur superconductors has attracted\nlarge research efforts, both experimental and theoretical, but a consensus on\nthe nature of superconductivity in these materials has yet to be reached. Using\ndensity functional theory for superconductors, we study the electron-phonon\npairing mechanism in LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. We first confirm the presence\nof a commensurate charge density wave instability, in accordance with previous\nstudies. Using a recently developed integration scheme for the electron-phonon\ncoupling, we found that its strength is much lower than previously calculated,\ndue to improved density of state calculations. We finally conclude that\nconventional phonon-mediated pairing cannot explain the high superconducting\ntransition temperatures observed in this material.\n", "  In a recent work [D. K. Burgarth et al., Nat. Commun. 5, 5173 (2014)] it was\nshown that a series of frequent measurements can project the dynamics of a\nquantum system onto a subspace in which the dynamics can be more complex. In\nthis subspace even full controllability can be achieved, although the\ncontrollability over the system before the projection is very poor since the\ncontrol Hamiltonians commute with each other. We can also think of the\nopposite: any Hamiltonians of a quantum system, which are in general\nnoncommutative with each other, can be made commutative by embedding them in an\nextended Hilbert space, and thus the dynamics in the extended space becomes\ntrivial and simple. This idea of making noncommutative Hamiltonians commutative\nis called \"Hamiltonian purification.\" The original noncommutative Hamiltonians\nare recovered by projecting the system back onto the original Hilbert space\nthrough frequent measurements. Here we generalize this idea to open-system\ndynamics by presenting a simple construction to make Lindbladians, as well as\nHamiltonians, commutative on a larger space with an auxiliary system. We show\nthat the original dynamics can be recovered through frequently measuring the\nauxiliary system in a non-selective way. Moreover, we provide a universal pair\nof Lindbladians which describes an \"accessible\" open quantum system for generic\nsystem sizes. This allows us to conclude that through a series of frequent\nnon-selective measurements a nonaccessible open quantum system generally\nbecomes accessible. This sheds further light on the role of measurement\nbackaction on the control of quantum systems.\n", "  We show how active transport of ions can be interpreted as an entropy\nfacilitated process. In this interpretation, the pore geometry through which\nsubstrates are transported can give rise to a driving force. This gives a\ndirect link between the geometry and the changes in Gibbs energy required.\nQuantifying the size of this effect for several proteins we find that the\nentropic contribution from the pore geometry is significant and we discuss how\nthe effect can be used to interpret variations in the affinity at the binding\nsite.\n", "  We provide an algorithm to check whether a given vacuum space-time\n$(\\mathcal{M},g)$ admits a Killing vector field w.r.t. which the Mars-Simon\ntensor vanishes. In particular, we obtain an algorithmic procedure to check\nwhether $(\\mathcal{M},g)$ is locally isometric to a member of the\nKerr-NUT-(A)dS family. A particular emphasis will be devoted to the Kerr-(A)dS\ncase.\n", "  The notion of compressed quantum computation is employed to simulate the\nIsing interaction of a 1D--chain consisting out of $n$ qubits using the\nuniversal IBM cloud quantum computer running on $\\log(n)$ qubits. The external\nfield parameter that controls the quantum phase transition of this model\ntranslates into particular settings of the quantum gates that generate the\ncircuit. We measure the magnetization, which displays the quantum phase\ntransition, on a two--qubit system, which simulates a four--qubit Ising chain,\nand show its agreement with the theoretical prediction within a certain error.\nWe also discuss the relevant point of how to assess errors when using a cloud\nquantum computer. As a solution, we propose to use validating circuits, that is\nto run independent controlled quantum circuits of similar complexity to the\ncircuit of interest.\n", "  We demonstrate in this work that the use of metasurfaces provides a viable\nstrategy to largely tune and enhance near-field radiative heat transfer between\nextended structures. In particular, using a rigorous coupled wave analysis, we\npredict that Si-based metasurfaces featuring two-dimensional periodic arrays of\nholes can exhibit a room-temperature near-field radiative heat conductance much\nlarger than any unstructured material to date. We show that this enhancement,\nwhich takes place in a broad range of separations, relies on the possibility to\nlargely tune the properties of the surface plasmon polaritons that dominate the\nradiative heat transfer in the near-field regime.\n", "  High-frequency photons traveling in plasma exhibit a linear polarizability\nthat can influence the dispersion of linear plasma waves. We present a detailed\ncalculation of this effect for Langmuir waves as a characteristic example. Two\nalternative formulations are given. In the first formulation, we calculate the\nmodified dispersion of Langmuir waves by solving the governing equations for\nthe electron fluid, where the photon contribution enters as a ponderomotive\nforce. In the second formulation, we provide a derivation based on the photon\npolarizability. Then, the calculation of ponderomotive forces is not needed,\nand the result is more general.\n", "  We demonstrate that the 8 multipole parameters describing the spin state of\nthe $Z$ boson are able to disentangle known $Z$ production mechanisms and\nsignals from new physics at the LHC. They can be extracted from appropriate\nasymmetries in the angular distribution of lepton pairs from the $Z$ boson\ndecay. The power of this analysis is illustrated by (i) the production of $Z$\nboson plus jets; (ii) $Z$ boson plus missing transverse energy; (iii) $W$ and\n$Z$ bosons originating from the two-body decay of a heavy resonance.\n", "  We analyze the cross-over of a homogeneous one-dimensional Bose gas from the\nideal gas into the dense quasi-condensate phase. We review a number of\nmean-field theories, perturbative or self-consistent, and provide accurate\nevaluations of equation of state, density fluctuations, and correlation\nfunctions. A smooth crossover is reproduced by classical-field simulations\nbased on the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the Yang-Yang solution\nto the one-dimensional Bose gas.\n", "  We give a systematical study on the recently reported excited charm and\ncharm-strange mesons with potential $1^-$ spin-parity, including the\n$D^*_{s1}(2700)^+$, $D^*_{s1}(2860)^+$, $D^*(2600)^0$, $D^*(2650)^0$,\n$D^*_1(2680)^0$ and $D^*_1(2760)^0$. The main strong decay properties are\nobtained by the framework of Bethe-Salpeter (BS) methods. Our results reveal\nthat the two $1^-$ charm-strange mesons can be well described by the further\n$2^3\\!S_1$-$1^3\\!D_1$ mixing scheme with a mixing angle of $8.7^{+3.9}_{-3.2}$\ndegrees. The predicted decay ratio $\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(D^*K)}{\\mathcal{B}(D~K)}$\nfor $D^*_{s1}(2860)$ is $0.62^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$.~$D^*(2600)^0$ can also be\nexplained as the $2^3\\!S_1$ predominant state with a mixing angle of\n$-(7.5^{+4.0}_{-3.3})$ degrees. Considering the mass range, $D^*(2650)^0$ and\n$D^*_1(2680)^0$ are more likely to be the $2^3\\!S_1$ predominant states,\nalthough the total widths under both the $2^3\\!S_1$ and $1^3\\!D_1$ assignments\nhave no great conflict with the current experimental data. The calculated width\nfor LHCb $D^*_1(2760)^0$ seems about 100 \\si{MeV} larger than experimental\nmeasurement if taking it as $1^3\\!D_1$ or $1^3\\!D_1$ dominant state $c\\bar u$.\nThe comparisons with other calculations and several important decay ratios are\nalso present. For the identification of these $1^-$ charm mesons, further\nexperimental information, such as\n$\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(D\\pi)}{\\mathcal{B}(D^*\\pi)}$ are necessary.\n", "  We study the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the magnetotransport\nproperties of the zirconium pentatelluride. The magnitude of resistivity\nanomaly gets enhanced with increasing pressure, but the transition temperature\n$T^{\\ast}$ is almost independent of it. In the case of H $\\parallel$ $b$, the\nquasi-linear magnetoresistance decreases drastically from 3300$\\%$ (9 T) at\nambient pressure to 400$\\%$ (14 T) at 2.5 GPa. Besides, the change of the\nquantum oscillation phase from topological nontrivial to trivial is revealed\naround 2 GPa. Both demonstrate that the pressure breaks the accidental Dirac\nnode in ZrTe$_{5}$. For H $\\parallel$ $c$, in contrast, subtle changes can be\nseen in the magnetoresistance and quantum oscillations. In the presence of\npressure, ZrTe$_{5}$ evolves from a highly anisotropic to a nearly isotropic\nelectronic system, which accompanies with the disruption of the accidental\nDirac semimetal state. It supports the assumption that ZrTe$_{5}$ is a semi-3D\nDirac system with linear dispersion along two directions and a quadratic one\nalong the third.\n", "  We characterize Cauchy data sets leading to vacuum space-times with vanishing\nMars-Simon tensor. This approach provides an algorithmic procedure to check\nwhether a given initial data set $(\\Sigma,h_{ij},K_{ij})$ evolves into a\nspace-time which is locally isometric to a member of the Kerr-(A)(dS) family.\n", "  Critical properties of the dynamical phase transition in the quenched\ngeneralized Bose-Anderson impurity model are studied in the mean-field limit of\nan infinite number of channels. The transition separates the evolution toward\nground state and toward the branch of stable excited states. We perform\nnumerically exact simulations of a close vicinity of the critical quench\namplitude. The relaxation constant describing the asymptotic evolution toward\nground state, as well as asymptotic frequency of persistent phase rotation and\nnumber of cloud particles at stable excited state are power functions of the\ndetuning from the critical quench amplitude. The critical evolution (separatrix\nbetween the two regimes) shows a non-Lyapunov power-law instability arising\nafter a certain critical time. The observed critical behavior is attributed to\nthe irreversibility of the dynamics of particles leaving the cloud and to\nmemory effects related to the low-energy behavior of the lattice density of\nstates.\n", "  Formation of molecular H2 and O2 is experimentally studied under laser\nexposure of water colloidal solution to radiation of a Nd:YAG laser at pulse\nduration of 10 ns and laser fluence in the liquid of order of 100 J/cm2. It is\nfound the partial pressure of both H2 and O2 first increases with laser\nexposure time and saturates at exposures of order of 1 hour. The balance\nbetween O2 and H2 content depends on the laser energy fluence in the solution\nand is shifted towards H2 at high fluences. Possible mechanisms of formation of\nthe dissociation products are discussed, from direct dissociation of H2O\nmolecules by electrons of plasma breakdown to emission of laser-induced plasma\nin liquid.\n", "  We derive the protected closed-string spectra of AdS3/CFT2 dual pairs with 16\nsupercharges at arbitrary values of the string tension and of the three-form\nfluxes. These follow immediately from the all-loop Bethe equations for the\nspectra of the integrable worldsheet theories. Further, representing the\nunderlying integrable systems as spin chains, we find that their dynamics\ninvolves length-changing interactions and that protected states correspond to\ngapless excitations above the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase vacuum. In the case\nof AdS3 x S3 x T4 the degeneracies of such operators precisely match those of\nthe dual CFT2 and the supergravity spectrum. On the other hand, we find that\nfor AdS3 x S3 x S3 x S1 there are fewer protected states than previous\nsupergravity calculations had suggested. In particular, protected states have\nthe same su(2) charge with respect to the two three-spheres.\n", "  The nuclear level densities and $\\gamma$-ray strength functions of\n$^{138,139,140}$La were measured using the $^{139}$La($^{3}$He, $\\alpha$),\n$^{139}$La($^{3}$He, $^{3}$He$^\\prime$) and $^{139}$La(d, p) reactions. The\nparticle-$\\gamma$ coincidences were recorded with the silicon particle\ntelescope (SiRi) and NaI(Tl) (CACTUS) arrays. In the context of these\nexperimental results, the low-energy enhancement in the A$\\sim$140 region is\ndiscussed. The $^{137,138,139}$La($n, \\gamma)$ cross sections were calculated\nat $s$- and $p$-process temperatures using the experimentally measured nuclear\nlevel densities and $\\gamma$-ray strength functions. Good agreement is found\nbetween $^{139}$La($n, \\gamma)$ calculated cross sections and previous\nmeasurements.\n", "  We study the consequences of 'super-quantum non-local correlations' as\nrepresented by the PR-box model of Popescu and Rohrlich, and show PR-boxes can\nenhance the capacity of noisy interference channels between two senders and two\nreceivers. PR-box correlations violate Bell/CHSH inequalities and are thus\nstronger -- more non-local -- than quantum mechanics; yet weak enough to\nrespect special relativity in prohibiting faster-than-light communication.\nUnderstanding their power will yield insight into the non-locality of quantum\nmechanics. We exhibit two proof-of-concept channels: first, we show a channel\nbetween two sender-receiver pairs where the senders are not allowed to\ncommunicate, for which a shared super-quantum bit (a PR-box) allows perfect\ncommunication. This feat is not achievable with the best classical (senders\nshare no resources) or quantum entanglement-assisted (senders share\nentanglement) strategies. Second, we demonstrate a class of channels for which\na tunable parameter achieves a double separation of capacities; for some range\nof \\epsilon, the super-quantum assisted strategy does better than the\nentanglement-assisted strategy, which in turn does better than the classical\none.\n", "  Masses of $^{52}$Co, $^{52}$Co$^m$, $^{52}$Fe, $^{52}$Fe$^m$, and $^{52}$Mn\nhave been measured with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer. Of\nthese, $^{52}$Co and $^{52}$Co$^m$ have been experimentally determined for the\nfirst time and found to be more bound than predicted by extrapolations. The\nisobaric multiplet mass equation for the $T=2$ quintet at $A=52$ has been\nstudied employing the new mass values. No significant breakdown (beyond the\n$3\\sigma$ level) of the quadratic form of the IMME was observed\n($\\chi^2/n=2.4$). The cubic coefficient was 6.0(32) keV ($\\chi^2/n=1.1$). The\nexcitation energies for the isomer and the $T=2$ isobaric analogue state in\n$^{52}$Co have been determined to be 374(13) keV and 2922(13) keV,\nrespectively. The $Q$ value for the proton decay from the $19/2^-$ isomer in\n$^{53}$Co has been determined with an unprecedented precision, $Q_{p} =\n1558.8(17)$ keV. The proton separation energies of $^{52}$Co and $^{53}$Ni\nrelevant for the astrophysical rapid proton capture process have been\nexperimentally determined for the first time. \\end{abstract}\n", "  The reconstruction of the orbital evolution of the propeller structure\nBl\\'eriot orbiting in Saturn's A ring from recurrent observations in Cassini\nISS images yielded a considerable offset motion from the expected Keplerian\norbit (Tiscareno et al., 2010). This offset motion can be composed by three\nsinusoidal harmonics with amplitudes and periods of 1845, 152, 58 km and 11.1,\n3.7 and 2.2 years, respectively (Srem\\v{c}evi\\'c et al., 2014). In this paper\nwe present results from N-Body simulations, where we integrated the orbital\nevolution of a moonlet, which is placed at the radial position of Bl\\'eriot\nunder the gravitational action of the Saturnian satellites. Our simulations\nyield, that especially the gravitational interactions with Prometheus, Pandora\nand Mimas is forcing the moonlet to librate with the right frequencies, but the\nlibration-amplitudes are far too small to explain the observations. Thus,\nfurther mechanisms are needed to explain the amplitudes of the forced\nlibrations - e.g. moonlet-ring interactions. Here, we develop a model, where\nthe moonlet is allowed to be slightly displaced with respect to its created\ngaps, resulting in a breaking point-symmetry and in a repulsive force. As a\nresult, the evolution of the moonlet's longitude can be described by a harmonic\noscillator. In the presence of external forcings by the outer moons, the\nlibration amplitude gets the more amplified, the more the forcing frequency\ngets close to the eigenfrequency of the disturbed propeller oscillator.\nApplying our model to Bl\\'eriot, it is possible to reproduce a libration period\nof 13 years with an amplitude of about 2000 km.\n", "  It is known that for an isolated dielectric cylinder waveguide there exists\nthe cutoff frequency $\\omega_\\ast$ below which there is no guided mode. It is\nshown in the paper that the infinite plane periodic array of such waveguides\npossesses the guided modes in the frequency domain which is below the frequency\n$\\omega_\\ast$. In the case of a finite array, the modes in this frequency\ndomain are weakly radiating ones, but their quality factor $Q$ increases with\nthe number of waveguides $N$ as $Q(N)\\sim N^3$. This dependence is obtained\nboth numerically, using the multiple scattering formalism, and is justified\nwith a simple analytical model.\n", "  The mathematical framework of multiplex networks has been increasingly\nrealized as a more suitable framework for modelling real-world complex systems.\nIn this work, we investigate the optimization of synchronizability in multiplex\nnetworks by evolving only one layer while keeping other layers fixed. Our main\nfinding is to show the conditions under which the efficiency of convergence to\nthe most optimal structure is almost as good as the case where both layers are\nrewired during an optimization process. In particular, inter-layer coupling\nstrength responsible for the integration between the layers turns out to be\ncrucial factor governing the efficiency of optimization even for the cases when\nthe layer going through the evolution has nodes interacting much weakly than\nthose in the fixed layer. Additionally, we investigate the dependency of\nsynchronizability on the rewiring probability which governs the network\nstructure from a regular lattice to the random networks. The efficiency of the\noptimization process preceding evolution driven by the optimization process is\nmaximum when the fixed layer has regular architecture, whereas the optimized\nnetwork is more synchronizable for the fixed layer having the rewiring\nprobability lying between the small-world transition and the random structure.\n", "  This paper summarizes the final results of the electron counting capacitance\nstandard experiment at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) achieved\nsince the publication of a preliminary result in 2012. All systematic\nuncertainty contributions were experimentally quantified and are discussed.\nFrequency-dependent measurements on the 1 pF cryogenic capacitor were performed\nusing a high-precision transformer-based capacitance bridge with a relative\nuncertainty of 0.03 microF/F. The results revealed a crucial problem related to\nthe capacitor, which hampered realizing the quantum metrology triangle with an\naccuracy corresponding to a combined total uncertainty of better than a few\nparts per million and eventually caused the discontinuation of the experiment\nat PTB. This paper provides a conclusion on the implications for future quantum\nmetrology triangle experiments from the latest CODATA adjustment of fundamental\nconstants, and summarizes perspectives and outlooks on future quantum metrology\ntriangle experiments based on topical developments in small-current metrology.\n", "  In presence of non-standard neutrino interactions the neutrino flavor\nevolution equation is affected by a degeneracy which leads to the so-called\nLMA-Dark solution. It requires a solar mixing angle in the second octant and\nimplies an ambiguity in the neutrino mass ordering. Non-oscillation experiments\nare required to break this degeneracy. We perform a combined analysis of data\nfrom oscillation experiments with the neutrino scattering experiments CHARM and\nNuTeV. We find that the degeneracy can be lifted if the non-standard neutrino\ninteractions take place with down quarks, but it remains for up quarks.\nHowever, CHARM and NuTeV constraints apply only if the new interactions take\nplace through mediators not much lighter than the electroweak scale. For light\nmediators we consider the possibility to resolve the degeneracy by using data\nfrom future coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments. We find that, for\nan experiment using a stopped-pion neutrino source, the LMA-Dark degeneracy\nwill either be resolved, or the presence of new interactions in the neutrino\nsector will be established with high significance.\n", "  We revisit the order $\\varepsilon$ dilatation operator of the Wilson-Fisher\nfixed point obtained by Kehrein, Pismak, and Wegner in light of recent results\nin conformal field theory. Our approach is algebraic and based only on symmetry\nprinciples. The starting point of our analysis is that the first correction to\nthe dilatation operator is a conformal invariant, which implies that its form\nis fixed up to an infinite set of coefficients associated with the scaling\ndimensions of higher-spin currents. These coefficients can be fixed using\nwell-known perturbative results, however, they were recently re-obtained using\nCFT arguments without relying on perturbation theory. Our analysis then implies\nthat all order-$\\varepsilon$ scaling dimensions of the Wilson-Fisher fixed\npoint can be fixed by symmetry.\n", "  Pre-main sequence stars are variable sources. In stars with disks, this\nvariability is related to the morphology of the inner circumstellar region\n(<0.1 AU) and that of the photosphere and corona, all impossible to be\nspatially resolved with present day techniques. This has been the main\nmotivation for the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of NGC 2264. In this\npaper, we focus on the stars with disks. We analyze the X-ray spectral\nproperties extracted during optical bursts and dips in order to unveil the\nnature of these phenomena. We analyze simultaneous CoRoT and Chandra/ACIS-I\nobservations to search for coherent optical and X-ray flux variability in stars\nwith disks. Then, stars are analyzed in two different samples. In stars with\nvariable extinction, we look for a simultaneous increase of optical extinction\nand X-ray absorption during the optical dips; in stars with accretion bursts,\nwe search for soft X-ray emission and increasing X-ray absorption during the\nbursts. Results. We find evidence for coherent optical and X-ray flux\nvariability among the stars with variable extinction. In 9/24 stars with\noptical dips, we observe a simultaneous increase of X-ray absorption and\noptical extinction. In seven dips, it is possible to calculate the NH/AV ratio\nin order to infer the composition of the obscuring material. In 5/20 stars with\noptical accretion bursts, we observe increasing soft X-ray emission during the\nbursts that we associate to the emission of accreting gas. It is not surprising\nthat these properties are not observed in all the stars with dips and bursts,\nsince favorable geometric configurations are required. The observed variable\nabsorption during the dips is mainly due to dust-free material in accretion\nstreams. In stars with accretion bursts, we observe on average a larger soft\nX-ray spectral component not observed in non accreting stars.\n", "  The experimental value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, as well\nas the LHCb anomalies, point towards new physics coupled non-universally to\nmuons and electrons. Working in extra dimensional theories, which solve the\nelectroweak hierarchy problem with a warped metric, strongly deformed with\nrespect to the AdS$_5$ geometry at the infra-red brane, the LHCb anomalies can\nbe solved by imposing that the bottom and the muon have a sizable amount of\ncompositeness, while the electron is mainly elementary. Using this set-up as\nstarting point we have proven that extra physics has to be introduced to\ndescribe the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We have proven that this\njob is done by a set of vector-like leptons, mixed with the physical muon\nthrough Yukawa interactions, and with a high degree of compositeness. The\ntheory is consistent with all electroweak indirect, direct and theoretical\nconstraints, the most sensitive ones being the modification of the\n$Z\\bar\\mu\\mu$ coupling, oblique observables and constraints on the stability of\nthe electroweak minimum. They impose lower bounds on the compositeness\n($c\\lesssim 0.37$) and on the mass of the lightest vector-like lepton ($\\gtrsim\n270$ GeV). Vector-like leptons could be easily produced in Drell-Yan processes\nat the LHC and detected at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.\n", "  Based on photon-phonon nonlinear interaction, a scheme is proposed to realize\na controllable multi-path photon-phonon converter at single-quantum level in a\ncomposed quadratically coupled optomechanical system. Considering the\nrealization of the scheme, an associated mechanical oscillator is introduced to\nenhance the effective nonlinear effect. Thus, the single-photon state can be\nconverted to the phonon state with high fidelity even under the current\nexperimental condition that the single-photon coupling rate is much smaller\nthan mechanical frequency ($g\\ll\\omega_m$). The state transfer protocols and\ntheir transfer fidelity are discussed both analytically and numerically. A\nmulti-path photon-phonon converter is designed, by combining the optomechanical\nsystem with low frequency resonators, which can be controlled by experimentally\nadjustable parameters. This work provides us a potential platform for quantum\nstate transfer and quantum information processing.\n", "  We examine the long-term behaviour of non-integrable, energy-conserved, 1D\nsystems of macroscopic grains interacting via a contact-only generalized Hertz\npotential and held between stationary walls. Existing dynamical studies showed\nthe absence of energy equipartitioning in such systems, hence their long-term\ndynamics was described as quasi-equilibrium. Here we show that these systems do\nin fact reach thermal equilibrium at sufficiently long times, as indicated by\nthe calculated heat capacity. This phase is described by equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics, opening up the possibility that the machinery of\nnon-equilibrium statistical mechanics may be used to understand the behaviour\nof these systems away from equilibrium.\n", "  We consider a cosmological model in which the tensor mode becomes massive\nduring inflation, and study the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature\nand polarization bispectra arising from the mixing between the scalar mode and\nthe massive tensor mode during inflation. The model assumes the existence of a\npreferred spatial frame during inflation. The local Lorentz invariance is\nalready broken in cosmology due to the existence of a preferred rest frame. The\nexistence of a preferred spatial frame further breaks the remaining local SO(3)\ninvariance and in particular gives rise to a mass in the tensor mode. At linear\nperturbation level, we minimize our model so that the vector mode remains\nnon-dynamical, while the scalar mode is the same as the one in single-field\nslow-roll inflation. At non-linear perturbation level, this inflationary\nmassive graviton phase leads to a sizeable scalar-scalar-tensor coupling, much\ngreater than the scalar-scalar-scalar one, as opposed to the conventional case.\nThis scalar-scalar-tensor interaction imprints a scale dependent feature in the\nCMB temperature and polarization bispectra. Very intriguingly, we find a\nsurprizing similarity between the predicted scale dependence and the\nscale-dependent non-Gaussianities at low multipoles hinted in the WMAP and\nPlanck results.\n", "  Time-centered, hence second-order, methods for integrating the relativistic\nmomentum of charged particles in an electromagnetic field are derived. A new\nmethod is found by averaging the momentum before use in the magnetic rotation\nterm, and an implementation is presented that differs from the relativistic\nBoris Push [1] only in the method for calculating the Lorentz factor. This is\nshown to have the same second-order accuracy in time as that (Boris Push) [1]\nfound by splitting the electric acceleration and magnetic rotation and that [2]\nfound by averaging the velocity in the magnetic rotation term. All three\nmethods are shown to conserve energy when there is no electric field. The Boris\nmethod and the current method are shown to be volume-preserving, while the\nmethod of [2] and the current method preserve the $\\vec{E} \\times \\vec{B}$\nvelocity. Thus, of these second-order relativistic momentum integrations, only\nthe integrator introduced here both preserves volume and gives the correct\n$\\vec{E} \\times \\vec{B}$ velocity. While all methods have error that is\nsecond-order in time, they deviate from each other by terms that increase as\nthe motion becomes relativistic. Numerical results show that [2] develops\nenergy errors near resonant orbits of a test problem that neither\nvolume-preserving integrator does.\n  [1] J.

Focusing, for simplicity, on quartic amplitudes with one of the\nexternal legs having non-zero integer spin (which can be considered as a\nprototype for Weinberg-type arguments), we review the appearance of $1/\\Box$\nnon-localities. In particular, we emphasise that it appears to be not possible\nto eliminate all of the aforementioned non-localities with a judicious choice\nof coupling constants and spectrum. We also discuss the light-cone gauge fixing\nin $d=4$, and argue that the non-local obstruction discussed in the covariant\nlanguage cannot be avoided using light-cone gauge formalism.\n", "  We consider the minimal interacting theory of a single tower of spin\nj=0,2,4,... massless Fronsdal fields in flat space for which consistent\ncovariant cubic interaction vertices are known. We address the question of\nconstraints on possible quartic interaction vertices imposed by the condition\nof on-shell gauge invariance of the tree-level four-point scattering amplitudes\ninvolving three spin 0 and one spin j particle. We find that these constraints\nadmit a local solution for quartic 000j interaction term in the action only for\nj=2 and j=4. We determine the non-local terms in four-vertices required in the\ncase of spin j greater than 4 and show that these non-localities can be\ninterpreted as a result of integrating out a tower of auxiliary ghost-like\nmassless higher spin fields in an extended theory with a local action. We also\nconsider the conformal off-shell extension of the Einstein theory and show that\nits perturbative expansion is the same as of the the non-local action resulting\nfrom integrating out the trace of the graviton field from the Einstein action.\nMotivated by this example, we conjecture the existence of a similar conformal\noff-shell extension of a massless higher spin theory that may be related to the\nabove extended theory and may have the same infinite-dimensional symmetry as\nthe conformal higher spin theory and thus may lead to a trivial S matrix.\n", "  We apply the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz to the models with gl(2|1) and\ngl}(1|2) supersymmetry. We show that form factors of local operators in these\nmodels can be expressed in terms of the universal form factors. Our derivation\nis based on the use of the RTT-algebra only. It does not refer to any specific\nrepresentation of this algebra. We obtain thus determinant representations for\nform factors of local operators in the cases where an explicit solution of the\nquantum inverse scattering problem is not known.\n", "  We demonstrate how the orientation of the Rb cell can significantly affect\nthe intensity and spectral characteristics of both the frequency up- and\ndown-converted fields generated by nonlinear processes in Rb vapour. The\nefficiency of parametric wave mixing in Rb vapour excited to the 5D5/2 level by\ntwo-colour resonant laser light can be significantly increased by seeding the\nexcitation region with coherent and directional radiation at 5.23 um that is\nresonant with the population inverted 5D5/2-6P3/2 transition. It has been shown\nthat the process of velocity insensitive two-photon excitation is central to\nunderstanding the observed coherent blue and mid-IR light enhancements and that\nthe velocity insensitive and velocity selective two-photon excitations could\nproduce two co-existing but spectrally and spatially distinguishable mid-IR\nfields at 5.23 um.\n", "  We discuss the correspondence between the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations\nassociated with $GL(N)$ and the $n$-particle quantum Calogero model in the case\nwhen $n$ is not necessarily equal to $N$. This can be viewed as a natural\n\"quantization\" of the quantum-classical correspondence between quantum Gaudin\nand classical Calogero models.\n", "  Following up on recent work by Caron-Huot et al. we consider a generalization\nof the old Lovelace-Shapiro model as a toy model for Pi-Pi scattering\nsatisfying (most of) the properties expected to hold in ('t Hooft's) large-N\nlimit of massless QCD. In particular, the model has asymptotically linear and\nparallel Regge trajectories at positive t, a positive leading Regge intercept\n$\\alpha_0 < 1$, and an effective bending of the trajectories in the negative-t\nregion producing a fixed branch point at J=0 for $t < t_0 < 0$. Fixed\n(physical) angle scattering can be tuned to match the power-like (including\nlogarithmic corrections) behavior predicted by perturbative QCD: $A(s,t) ~\ns^{-\\beta} \\log(s)^{-\\gamma} F(\\theta)$. Tree-level unitarity (i.e. positivity\nof residues for all values of s and J) imposes strong constraints on the\nallowed region in the alpha_0-beta-gamma parameter space, which nicely includes\na physically interesting region around $\\alpha_0 = 0.5$, $\\beta = 2$ and\n$\\gamma = 3$. The full consistency of the model would require an extension to\nmulti-pion processes, a program we do not undertake in this paper.\n", "  We discuss the design and optimisation of two types of junctions between\nsurface-electrode radiofrequency ion-trap arrays that enable the integration of\nexperiments with sympathetically cooled molecular ions on a monolithic chip\ndevice. A detailed description of a multi-objective optimisation procedure\napplicable to an arbitrary planar junction is presented, and the results for a\ncross junction between four quadrupoles as well as a quadrupole-to-octupole\njunction are discussed. Based on these optimised functional elements, we\npropose a multi-functional ion-trap chip for experiments with translationally\ncold molecular ions at temperatures in the millikelvin range. This study opens\nthe door to extending complex chip-based trapping techniques to\nCoulomb-crystallised molecular ions with potential applications in mass\nspectrometry, spectroscopy, controlled chemistry and quantum technology.\n", "  This article is a tutorial on the practical implementation of a method of\nmeasurement of minute deformations based on multiple scattering. This technic\nhas been recently developed and has proven to give new insights on the spatial\nrepartition of strain in a granular material. We provide here the basics to\nunderstand the method by giving a synthetic review on Diffusing Wave\nSpectroscopy and multiple scattering in granular materials. We detail a simple\nexperiment using standard lab equipment to pedagogically demonstrate the\nimplementation of the method. Finally we give a few examples of measurements\nthat have been obtained in other works to discuss the potential of the method.\n", "  In this work, a novel ring polymer representation for multi-level quantum\nsystem is proposed for thermal average calculations. The proposed presentation\nkeeps the discreteness of the electronic states: besides position and momentum,\neach bead in the ring polymer is also characterized by a surface index\nindicating the electronic energy surface. A path integral molecular dynamics\nwith surface hopping (PIMD-SH) dynamics is also developed to sample the\nequilibrium distribution of ring polymer configurational space. The PIMD-SH\nsampling method is validated theoretically and by numerical examples.\n", "  We resolved FU Ori at 29-37 GHz using the JVLA with $\\sim$0$''$.07\nresolution, and performed the complementary JVLA 8-10 GHz observations, the SMA\n224 GHz and 272 GHz observations, and compared with archival ALMA 346 GHz\nobservations to obtain the SEDs. Our 8-10 GHz observations do not find evidence\nfor the presence of thermal radio jets, and constrain the radio jet/wind flux\nto at least 90 times lower than the expected value from the previously reported\nbolometric luminosity-radio luminosity correlation. The emission at $>$29 GHz\nmay be dominated by the two spatially unresolved sources, which are located\nimmediately around FU Ori and its companion FU Ori S, respectively. Their\ndeconvolved radii at 33 GHz are only a few au. The 8-346 GHz SEDs of FU Ori and\nFU Ori S cannot be fit by constant spectral indices (over frequency). The more\nsophisticated models for SEDs suggest that the $>$29 GHz emission is\ncontributed by a combination of free-free emission from ionized gas, and\nthermal emission from optically thick and optically thin dust components. We\nhypothesize that dust in the innermost parts of the disks ($\\lesssim$0.1 au)\nhas been sublimated, and thus the disks are no more well shielded against the\nionizing photons. The estimated overall gas and dust mass based on SED\nmodeling, can be as high as a fraction of a solar mass, which is adequate for\ndeveloping disk gravitational instability. Our present explanation for the\nobservational data is that the massive inflow of gas and dust due to disk\ngravitational instability or interaction with a companion/intruder, was piled\nup at the few au scale due to the development of a deadzone with negligible\nionization. The piled up material subsequently triggered the thermal and the\nMRI instabilities when the ionization fraction in the inner sub-au scale region\nexceeded a threshold value, leading to the high protostellar accretion rate.\n", "  Antiferromagnetic spintronics is an emerging research field whose focus is on\nthe electrical and optical control of the antiferromagnetic order parameter and\nits utility in information technology devices. An example of recently\ndiscovered new concepts is the N\\'{e}el spin-orbit torque which allows for the\nantiferromagnetic order parameter to be controlled by an electrical current in\ncommon microelectronic circuits. In this review we discuss the utility of\nantiferromagnets as active and supporting materials for spintronics, the\ninterplay of antiferromagnetic spintronics with other modern research fields in\ncondensed matter physics, and its utility in future \"More than Moore\"\ninformation technologies.\n", "  We use temperature- and field-dependent resistivity measurements\n[Shubnikov--de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations] and ultrahigh resolution,\ntunable, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser-based angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) to study the three-dimensionality (3D) of the bulk\nelectronic structure in WTe2, a type-II Weyl semimetal. The bulk Fermi surface\n(FS) consists of two pairs of electron pockets and two pairs of hole pockets\nalong the X-Gamma-X direction as detected by using an incident photon energy of\n6.7 eV, which is consistent with the previously reported data. However, if\nusing an incident photon energy of 6.36 eV, another pair of tiny electron\npockets is detected on both sides of the Gamma point, which is in agreement\nwith the small quantum oscillation frequency peak observed in the\nmagnetoresistance. Therefore, the bulk, 3D FS consists of three pairs of\nelectron pockets and two pairs of hole pockets in total. With the ability of\nfine tuning the incident photon energy, we demonstrate the strong\nthree-dimensionality of the bulk electronic structure in WTe2. The combination\nof resistivity and ARPES measurements reveal the complete, and consistent,\npicture of the bulk electronic structure of this material.\n", "  Until recently almost nothing was known about the evolution of magnetic\nfields found in upper main sequence Ap/Bp stars during their long main sequence\nlifetime. We are thus studying magnetic Ap/Bp stars in open clusters in order\nto obtain observational evidence of how the properties of Ap/Bp magnetic stars,\nsuch as field strength and structure, evolve with age during the main sequence.\nOne important aspect of this study is to search for the very rare examples of\nhot magnetic stars in short-period binary systems among magnetic cluster\nmembers. In this paper we characterize the object BD-19~5044L, which is both a\nmember of the open cluster IC 4725 = M~25, and a short-period SB2 system\ncontaining a magnetic primary star. We have obtained a series of intensity and\ncircular polarisation spectra distributed through the orbital and rotation\ncycles of BD-19 5044L with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at CFHT. We find\nthat the orbit of BD-19 5044L AB is quite eccentric (e = 0.477), with a period\nof 17.63 d. The primary is a magnetic Bp star with a variable longitudinal\nmagnetic field, a polar field strength of ~1400 G and a low obliquity, while\nthe secondary is probably a hot Am star and does not appear to be magnetic. The\nrotation period of the primary (5.04 d) is not synchronised with the orbit, but\nthe rotation angular velocity is close to being synchronised with the orbital\nangular velocity of the secondary at periastron, perhaps as a result of tidal\ninteractions. The periastron separation is small enough (about 12 times the\nradius of the primary star) that BD-19 5044L may be one of the very rare known\ncases of a tidally interacting SB2 binary system containing a magnetic Ap/Bp\nstar.\n", "  We use the spinor helicity formalism to calculate the cross section for\nproduction of three partons of a given polarization in Deep Inelastic\nScattering (DIS) off proton and nucleus targets at small Bjorken x. The target\nproton or nucleus is treated as a classical color field (shock wave) from which\nthe produced partons scatter multiple times. We reported our result for the\nfinal expression for the production cross section and studied the azimuthal\nangular correlations of the produced partons in [1]. Here we provide the full\ndetails of the calculation of the production cross section using the spinor\nhelicity methods.\n", "  This paper is an extended version of our short letter on a new proposal for\nholographic boundary conformal field, i.e., BCFT. By using the\nPenrose-Brown-Henneaux (PBH) transformation, we successfully obtain the\nexpected boundary Weyl anomaly. The obtained boundary central charges satisfy\nnaturally a c-like theorem holographically. We then develop an approach of\nholographic renormalization for BCFT, and reproduce the correct boundary Weyl\nanomaly. This provides a non-trivial check of our proposal. We also investigate\nthe holographic entanglement entropy of BCFT and find that our proposal gives\nthe expected orthogonal condition that the minimal surface must be normal to\nthe spacetime boundaries if they intersect. This is another support for our\nproposal. We also find that the entanglement entropy depends on the boundary\nconditions of BCFT and the distance to the boundary; and that the entanglement\nwedge behaves a phase transition, which is important for the self-consistency\nof AdS/BCFT. Finally, we show that the proposal of arXiv:1105.5165 is too\nrestrictive that it always make vanishing some of the boundary central charges.\n", "  Below the phase transition temperature $Tc \\simeq 10^{-3}$K He-3B has a\nmixture of normal and superfluid components. Turbulence in this material is\ncarried predominantly by the superfluid component. We explore the statistical\nproperties of this quantum turbulence, stressing the differences from the\nbetter known classical counterpart. To this aim we study the time-honored\nHall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov coarse-grained equations of superfluid\nturbulence. We combine pseudo-spectral direct numerical simulations with\nanalytic considerations based on an integral closure for the energy flux. We\navoid the assumption of locality of the energy transfer which was used\npreviously in both analytic and numerical studies of the superfluid He-3B\nturbulence. For T<0.37 Tc, with relatively weak mutual friction, we confirm the\npreviously found \"subcritical\" energy spectrum E(k), given by a superposition\nof two power laws that can be approximated as $E(k)~ k^{-x}$ with an apparent\nscaling exponent 5/3 <x(k)< 3. For T>0.37 Tc and with strong mutual friction,\nwe observed numerically and confirmed analytically the scale-invariant spectrum\n$E(k)~ k^{-x}$ with a (k-independent) exponent x > 3 that gradually increases\nwith the temperature and reaches a value $x\\simeq 9$ for $T\\approx 0.72 Tc$. In\nthe near-critical regimes we discover a strong enhancement of intermittency\nwhich exceeds by an order of magnitude the corresponding level in classical\nhydrodynamic turbulence.\n", "  Plasmonics currently faces the problem of seemingly inevitable optical losses\noccurring in the metallic components that challenges the implementation of\nessentially any application. In this work we show that Ohmic losses are reduced\nin certain layered metals, such as the transition metal dichalcogenide TaS$_2$,\ndue to an extraordinarily small density of states for scattering in the near-IR\noriginating from their special electronic band structure. Based on this\nobservation we propose a new class of band structure engineered van der Waals\nlayered metals composed of hexagonal transition metal chalcogenide-halide\nlayers with greatly suppressed intrinsic losses. Using first-principles\ncalculations we show that the suppression of optical losses lead to improved\nperformance for thin film waveguiding and transformation optics.\n", "  Based on the Baikov representation, we present a systematic approach to\ncompute cuts of Feynman Integrals, appropriately defined in $d$ dimensions. The\ninformation provided by these computations may be used to determine the class\nof functions needed to analytically express the full integrals.\n", "  We introduce the notion of a leak for general process theories, and identify\nquantum theory as a theory with minimal leakage, while classical theory has\nmaximal leakage. We provide a construction that adjoins leaks to theories, an\ninstance of which describes the emergence of classical theory by adjoining\ndecoherence-leaks to quantum theory. Finally, we show that defining a notion of\npurity for processes in general process theories has to make reference to the\nleaks of that theory ---a feature missing in standard definitions--- hence, we\npropose a refined definition and study the resulting notion of purity for\nquantum, classical and intermediate theories.\n", "  We consider a discrete model of a graphene sheet with atomic interactions\ngoverned by a harmonic approximation of the 2nd-generation Brenner potential\nthat depends on bond lengths, bond angles, and two types of dihedral angles. A\ncontinuum limit is then deduced that fully describes the bending behavior. In\nparticular, we deduce for the first time an analytical expression of the\nGaussian stiffness, a scarcely investigated parameter ruling the rippling of\ngraphene, for which contradictory values have been proposed in the literature.\nWe disclose the atomic-scale sources of both bending and Gaussian stiffnesses\nand provide for them quantitative evaluations.\n", "  Motivated by a recent experiment by F. Meinert et al, arxiv:1608.08200, we\nstudy the dynamics of an impurity moving in the background of a harmonically\ntrapped one-dimensional Bose gas in the hard-core limit. We show that due to\nthe hidden \"lattice\" structure of background bosons, the impurity effectively\nfeels a quasi-periodic potential via impurity-boson interactions that can drive\nthe Bloch oscillation under an external force, even in the absence of real\nlattice potentials. Meanwhile, the inhomogeneous density of trapped bosons\nimposes an additional harmonic potential to the impurity, resulting in a\nsimilar oscillation dynamics but with different periods and amplitudes. We show\nthat the sign and the strength of impurity-boson coupling can significantly\naffect above two potentials so as to determine the impurity dynamics.\n", "  The influence of the ion mass on filament propagation in the scrape-off layer\nof toroidal magnetised plasmas is analysed for various fusion relevant majority\nspecies, like hydrogen isotopes and helium, on the basis of a computational\nisothermal gyrofluid model for the plasma edge. Heavy hydrogen isotope plasmas\nshow slower outward filament propagation and thus improved confinement\nproperties compared to light isotope plasmas, regardless of collisionality\nregimes. Similarly, filaments in fully ionised helium move more slowly than in\ndeutrium. Different mass effects on the filament inertia through polarisation,\nfinite Larmor radius, and parallel dynamics are identified.\n", "  Numerous tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates originating from galactic\ncentres have been detected (e.g., by ${\\it Swift}$ and ASASSN). Some of their\nhost galaxies show typical characteristics of a weak active galactic nucleus\n(AGN), indicative of a pre-existing accretion disc around the supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH). In this work, we develop an analytic model to study how a\npre-existing accretion disc affects a TDE. We assume the density of the disc\n$\\rho\\propto R^{-\\lambda}$, $R$ being the radial distance from the SMBH and\n$\\lambda$ varying between $0.5$ and $1.5$. Interactions between the\npre-existing accretion disc and the stream of the tidally disrupted star can\nstall the stream far from the SMBH, causing a sudden drop in the rate of\nfallback of gas into the SMBH. These interactions could explain the steep\ncut-off observed in the light curve of some TDE candidates (e.g., ${\\it Swift}$\nJ1644 and ${\\it Swift}$ J2058). With our model, it is possible to use the time\nof this cut-off to constrain some properties pertaining to the pre-existing\naccretion disc, such as $\\lambda$ and the disc viscosity parameter $\\alpha$. We\ndemonstrate this by applying our theory to the TDE candidates ${\\it Swift}$\nJ1644, ${\\it Swift}$ J2058 and ASASSN-14li. Our analysis favours a disc profile\nwith $\\lambda\\sim1$ for viscosity parameters $\\alpha\\sim0.01-0.1$.\n", "  We perform density-matrix renormalization group studies of a two-dimensional\nelectron gas in a high magnetic field and with an anisotropic band mass. At\nhalf-filling in the lowest Landau level, such a system is a Fermi liquid of\ncomposite fermions. By measuring the Fermi surface of these composite fermions,\nwe determine a relationship between the anisotropy of composite fermion\ndispersion, $\\alpha_{CF}$, and the original anisotropy $\\alpha_F$ of the\nfermion dispersion at zero magnetic field. For systems where the electrons\ninteract via a Coulomb interaction, we find $\\alpha_{CF}=\\sqrt{\\alpha_F}$\nwithin our numerical accuracy. The same result has been found concurrently in\nrecent experiments. We also show results with other forms of the\nelectron-electron interaction; this allows us (a) to benchmark our procedure\nagainst known exact results and (b) to show that the relationship between the\nanisotropies is dependent on the form of the interaction.\n", "  We present a rigorous electromagnetic method based on Green's second identity\nfor studying the plasmonic response of graphene-coated wires of arbitrary\nshape. The wire is illuminated perpendicular to its axis by a monochromatic\nelectromagnetic wave and the wire substrate is homogeneous and isotropic. The\nfield is expressed everywhere in terms of two unknown source functions\nevaluated on the graphene coating which can be obtained from the numerical\nsolution of a coupled pair of inhomogeneous integral equations. To assess the\nvalidity of the Green formulation, the scattering and absorption efficiencies\nobtained numerically in the particular case of circular wires are compared with\nthose obtained from the multipolar Mie theory. An excellent agreement is\nobserved in this particular case, both for metallic and dielectric substrates.\nTo explore the effects that the break of the rotational symmetry of the wire\nsection introduces in the plasmonic features of the scattering and absorption\nresponse, the Green formulation is applied to the case of graphene-coated wires\nof elliptical section. As might be expected from symmetry arguments, we find a\ntwo-dimensional anisotropy in the angular optical response of the wire,\nparticularly evident in the frequency splitting of multipolar plasmonic\nresonances. The comparison between the spectral position of the enhancements in\nthe scattering and absorption efficiency spectra for low-eccentricity\nelliptical and circular wires allows us to guess the multipolar order of each\nplasmonic resonance. We present calculations of the near field distribution for\ndifferent frequencies which explicitly reveal the multipolar order of the\nplasmonic resonances. They also confirm the previous guess and serve as a\nfurther test on the validity of the Green formulation.\n", "  We study the possibility of using dark soliton in quasi one dimensional Bose\nEinstein condensates to produce two level system (qubits) by exploiting the\nintrinsic nonlinear and the coherent nature of the matter waves. We calculate\nthe soliton spectrum and the conditions for a qubit to exist. We also compute\nthe coupling between the phonons and the soliton and investigate the emission\nrate of the qubits in that case. Remarkably, the qubit lifetime is estimated to\nbe of the order of a few seconds, being by the dark soliton \"death\" due to\nquantum evaporation.\n", "  We have developed an extended distance matrix approach to study the molecular\ngeometric configuration through spectral decomposition. It is shown that the\npositions of all atoms in the eigen-space can be specified precisely by their\neigen-coordinates, while the refined atomic eigen-subspace projection array\nadopted in our approach is demonstrated to be a competent invariant in\nstructure comparison. Furthermore, a visual eigen-subspace projection function\n(EPF) is derived to characterize the surrounding configuration of an atom\nnaturally. A complete set of atomic EPFs constitute an intrinsic representation\nof molecular conformation, based on which the interatomic EPF distance and\nintermolecular EPF distance in the eigen-space can be reasonably defined.\nExemplified with a few cases, the intermolecular EPF distance shows exceptional\nrationality and efficiency in structure recognition and comparison.\n", "  A warm inflationary universe in the context of Galileon model or G-model is\nstudied. Under a general formalism we study the inflationary dynamics and the\ncosmological perturbations considering a coupling of the form\n$G(\\phi,X)=g(\\phi)\\,X$. As a concrete example, we consider an exponential\npotential together with the cases in which the dissipation and Galilean\ncoefficients are constants. Also, we study the weak regime given by the\ncondition $R<1+3gH\\dot{\\phi}$, and the strong regime in which\n$1<R+3gH\\dot{\\phi}$.Additionally, we obtain constraints on the parameters\nduring the evolution of G-warm inflation, assuming the condition for warm\ninflation in which the temperature $T>H$, the conditions for the weak and\nstrong regimes, together with the consistency relation $r=r(n_s)$ from Planck\ndata.\n", "  Riemannian geometry is a particular case of Hamiltonian mechanics: the orbits\nof the hamiltonian $H=\\frac{1}{2}g^{ij}p_{i}p_{j}$ are the geodesics. Given a\nsymplectic manifold (\\Gamma,\\omega), a hamiltonian $H:\\Gamma\\to\\mathbb{R}$ and\na Lagrangian sub-manifold $M\\subset\\Gamma$ we find a generalization of the\nnotion of curvature. The particular case\n$H=\\frac{1}{2}g^{ij}\\left[p_{i}-A_{i}\\right]\\left[p_{j}-A_{j}\\right]+\\phi $ of\na particle moving in a gravitational, electromagnetic and scalar fields is\nstudied in more detail. The integral of the generalized Ricci tensor w.r.t. the\nBoltzmann weight reduces to the action principle\n$\\int\\left[R+\\frac{1}{4}F_{ik}F_{jl}g^{kl}g^{ij}-g^{ij}\\partial_{i}\\phi\\partial_{j}\\phi\\right]e^{-\\phi}\\sqrt{g}d^{n}q$\nfor the scalar, vector and tensor fields.\n", "  The velocity-space moments of the often troublesome nonlinear Landau\ncollision operator are expressed exactly in terms of multi-index\nHermite-polynomial moments of the distribution functions. The collisional\nmoments are shown to be generated by derivatives of two well-known functions,\nnamely the Rosenbluth-MacDonald-Judd-Trubnikov potentials for a Gaussian\ndistribution. The resulting formula has a nonlinear dependency on the relative\nmean flow of the colliding species normalised to the root-mean-square of the\ncorresponding thermal velocities, and a bilinear dependency on densities and\nhigher-order velocity moments of the distribution functions, with no\nrestriction on temperature, flow or mass ratio of the species. The result can\nbe applied to both the classic transport theory of plasmas, that relies on the\nChapman-Enskog method, as well as to deriving collisional fluid equations that\nfollow Grad's moment approach. As an illustrative example, we provide the\ncollisional ten-moment equations with exact conservation laws for momentum- and\nenergy-transfer rate.\n", "  Equilibrium theormodynamics is characterized by two fundamental ideas:\nthermalisation--that systems approach a late time thermal state; and phase\nstructure--that thermal states exhibit singular changes as various parameters\ncharacterizing the system are changed. We summarise recent progress that has\nestablished generalizations of these ideas to periodically driven, or Floquet,\nclosed quantum systems. This has resulted in the discovery of entirely new\nphases which exist only out of equilibrium, such as the $\\pi$-spin glass or\nFloquet time crystal.\n", "  We propose a derivation of the inflaton scalar potential from the higher\n$(D)$ dimensional $(R+\\gamma R^n-2\\Lambda)$ gravity, with the new coupling\nconstant $\\gamma$ and the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. We assume that a\ncompactification of extra dimensions happened before inflation, so that the\ninflaton scalar potential in four spacetime dimensions appears to be dependent\nupon the parameters $(\\gamma,\\Lambda ,D,n)$. We find that consistency requires\n$n=D/2$, while the dimension $D$ has to be a multiple of four. We calculate the\npotential for any $D$, and determine the values of $\\gamma$ and $\\Lambda$ from\nobservations. The cases of $D=8$ and $D=12$ are considered in more detail. Our\napproach results in the viable models of chaotic large-field inflation, and\nleads to the sharp predictions of an observable value of the tensor-to-scalar\nratio $r$ of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.\n", "  The $N=1$ supergravity models of cosmological inflation with inflaton\nbelonging to a massive vector multiplet and spontaneous SUSY breaking after\ninflation are reformulated as the supersymmetric $U(1)$ gauge theories of a\nmassless vector superfield interacting with the Higgs and Polonyi chiral\nsuperfields, all coupled to supergravity. The $U(1)$ gauge sector is identified\nwith the $U(1)$ gauge fields of the super-GUT coupled to supergravity, whose\ngauge group has a $U(1)$ factor. A positive cosmological constant (dark energy)\nis included. The scalar potential is calculated, and its de Sitter vacuum\nsolution is found to be stable.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of a three-layer nested Uhrig\ndynamical decoupling (NUDD) sequence to preserve arbitrary quantum states in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace of the four-dimensional two-qubit Hilbert space, on an\nNMR quantum information processor. The effect of the state preservation is\nstudied first on four known states, including two product states and two\nmaximally entangled Bell states. Next, to evaluate the preservation capacity of\nthe NUDD scheme, we apply it to eight randomly generated states in the\nsubspace. Although, the preservation of different states varies, the scheme on\nthe average performs very well. The complete tomographs of the states at\ndifferent time points are used to compute fidelity. State fidelities using NUDD\nprotection are compared with those obtained without using any protection. The\nnested pulse schemes are complex in nature and require careful experimental\nimplementation.\n", "  A first-order differential equation is provided for a one-form, spin-s\nconnection valued in the two-row, width-(s-1) Young tableau of GL(5). The\nconnection is glued to a zero-form identified with the spin-s Cotton tensor.\nThe usual zero-Cotton equation for a symmetric, conformal spin-s tensor gauge\nfield in 3D is the flatness condition for the sum of the GL(5) spin-s and\nbackground connections. This presentation of the equations allows to\nreformulate in a compact way the cohomological problem studied in 1511.07389,\nfeaturing the spin-s Schouten tensor. We provide full computational details for\nspin 3 and 4 and present the general spin-s case in a compact way.\n", "  We derive equations of motion for the reduced density matrix of a molecular\nsystem which undergoes energy transfer dynamics competing with fast internal\nconversion channels. Environmental degrees of freedom of such a system have no\ntime to relax to quasi-equilibrium in the electronic excited state of the donor\nmolecule, and thus the conditions of validity of Foerster and Modified Redfield\ntheories in their standard formulations do not apply. We derive non-equilibrium\nversions of the two well-known rate theories and apply them to the case of\ncarotenoid-chlorophyll energy transfer. Although our reduced density matrix\napproach does not account for the formation of vibronic excitons, it still\nconfirms the important role of the donor ground-state vibrational states in\nestablishing the resonance energy transfer conditions. We show that it is\nessential to work with a theory valid in strong system-bath interaction regime\nto obtain correct dependence of the rates on donor-acceptor energy gap.\n", "  We introduce a novel Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) algorithm which\nemploys a multispin quantum fluctuation operator. At variance with the usual\ntransverse field, short-range two-spin flip interactions are included in the\ndriver Hamiltonian. A Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, capable of efficiently\nsimulating large disordered systems, is described and tested. A first\napplication to SQA, on a random square lattice Ising spin glass reveals that\nthe multi-spin driver Hamiltonian improves upon the usual transverse field.\nThis work paves the way for more systematic investigations using multi-spin\nquantum fluctuations on a broader range of problems.\n", "  We introduce atomicrex, an open-source code for constructing interatomic\npotentials as well as more general types of atomic-scale models. Such effective\nmodels are required to simulate extended materials structures comprising many\nthousands of atoms or more, because electronic structure methods become\ncomputationally too expensive at this scale. atomicrex covers a wide range of\ninteratomic potential types and fulfills many needs in atomistic model\ndevelopment. As inputs, it supports experimental property values as well as\n\\textit{ab initio} energies and forces, to which models can be fitted using\nvarious optimization algorithms. The open architecture of atomicrex allows it\nto be used in custom model development scenarios beyond classical interatomic\npotentials while thanks to its Python interface it can be readily integrated\ne.g., with electronic structure calculations or machine learning algorithms.\n", "  We use a real-space formulation of orbital-free DFT to study the core\nenergetics and core structure of an isolated screw dislocation in Aluminum.\nUsing a direct energetics based approach, we estimate the core size of a\nperfect screw dislocation to be $\\approx$ 7 $|{\\bf b}|$, which is considerably\nlarger than previous estimates of $1-3~|{\\bf b}|$ based on displacement fields.\nThe perfect screw upon structural relaxation dissociates into two Shockley\npartials with partial separation distances of 8.2 \\AA~and 6.6 \\AA~ measured\nfrom the screw and edge component differential displacement plots,\nrespectively. Similar to a previous electronic structure study on edge\ndislocation, we find that the core energy of the relaxed screw dislocation is\nstrongly dependent on macroscopic deformations. Next, we use the edge and screw\ndislocation core energetics data with physically reasonable assumptions to\ndevelop a continuum energetics model for an aggregate of dislocations. Further,\nwe use this model in a discrete dislocation network, and from the variations of\nthe core energy with respect to the nodal positions of the network, we obtain\nthe nodal core force which can directly be incorporated into discrete\ndislocation dynamics frameworks. We analyze and classify the nodal core force\ninto three different contributions based on their decay behavior. Two of these\ncontributions to the core force, both arising from the core energy dependence\non macroscopic deformations, are not accounted for in currently used discrete\ndislocation dynamics models which assume the core energy to be a constant.\nUsing case studies involving simple dislocation structures, we demonstrate that\nthe contribution to the core force from the core energy dependence on\nmacroscopic deformations can be significant in comparison to the elastic\nPeach-Koehler force even up to distances of $10-15$ nm between dislocation\nstructures.\n", "  We study the dynamics of small perturbations to the rest state of a\nviscoelastic rate type fluid with temperature dependent material parameters. We\nshow that if the material parameters are chosen appropriately, then the\nquiescent state of the fluid filling an isolated (mechanically, thermally)\nvessel is a stable state. The outlined analysis explicitly documents the\nimportance of thermodynamic analysis in the development of advanced models for\ncomplex fluids.\n", "  We compare the recent experimentally measured forces between charged\ncolloidal particles, as well as their effective surface potentials (surface\ncharge) in the presence of multivalent counterions in a bathing monovalent salt\nsolution, with the predictions of the dressed ion theory of strongly charged\ncolloidal systems. The benchmark for comparison is provided by the DLVO theory\nand the deviations from its predictions at small separations are taken as an\nindication of the additional non-DLVO attractions that can be fitted by an\nadditional phenomenological exponential term. The parameters characterizing\nthis non-DLVO exponential term as well as the dependencies of the effective\npotential on the counterion concentration and valency predicted by the dressed\nion theory are well within the experimental values. This suggests that the\ndeviations from the DLVO theory are probably caused by ion correlations as\nformalized within the dressed ion theory.\n", "  We investigate spin pumping phenomena in polycrystalline CoFeB/Pt and\nCoFeB/Ta bilayers and the correlation between the effective spin mixing\nconductance $g^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}_{\\rm eff}$ and the obtained voltages\ngenerated by the spin-to-charge current conversion via the inverse spin Hall\neffect in the Pt and Ta layers. For this purpose we measure the in-plane\nangular dependence of the generated voltages on the external static magnetic\nfield and we apply a model to separate the spin pumping signal from the one\ngenerated by the spin rectification effect in the magnetic layer. Our results\nreveal a dominating role of anomalous Hall effect for the spin rectification\neffect with CoFeB and a lack of correlation between\n$g^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}_{\\rm eff}$ and inverse spin Hall voltages pointing to a\nstrong role of the magnetic proximity effect in Pt in understanding the\nobserved increased damping. This is additionally reflected on the presence of a\nlinear dependency of the Gilbert damping parameter on the Pt thickness.\n", "  Context: Mode identification has remained a major obstacle in the\ninterpretation of pulsation spectra in rapidly rotating stars.\n  Aims: We would like to test mode identification methods and seismic\ndiagnostics in rapidly rotating stars, using oscillation spectra based on new\ntheoretical predictions.\n  Methods: We investigate the auto-correlation function and Fourier transform\nof theoretically calculated frequency spectra, in which modes are selected\naccording to their visibilities. Given the difficulties in predicting intrinsic\nmode amplitudes, we experimented with various ad-hoc prescriptions for setting\nthese, including using random values. Furthermore, we analyse the ratios\nbetween mode amplitudes observed in different photometric bands.\n  Results: When non-random intrinsic mode amplitudes are used, our results show\nthat it is possible to extract the large frequency separation or half its\nvalue, and sometimes twice the rotation rate, from the auto-correlation\nfunction. The Fourier transforms are mostly sensitive to the large frequency\nseparation or half its value. When the intrinsic mode amplitudes include random\nfactors, the results are far less favourable. We also find that amplitude\nratios provide a good way of grouping together modes with similar\ncharacteristics. By analysing the frequencies of these groups, it is possible\nto constrain mode identification as well as determine the large frequency\nseparation and the rotation rate.\n", "  The sharp-line spectrum of the Bp star HR 6000 has peculiarities that\ndistinguish it from those of the HgMn stars with which it is sometimes\nassociated. The position of the star close to the center of the Lupus 3\nmolecular cloud, whose estimated age is on the order of 9.1 +/- 2.1 Myr, has\nlead to the hypothesis that the anomalous peculiarities of HR 6000 can be\nexplained by the young age of the star. Observational material from HST\nprovides the opportunity to extend the abundance analysis previously performed\nfor the optical region and clarify the properties of this remarkable peculiar\nstar. Our aim was to obtain the atmospheric abundances for all the elements\nobserved in a broad region from 1250 to 10000 A. An LTE synthetic spectrum was\ncompared with a high-resolution spectrum observed with STIS equipment in the\n1250-3040 A interval. The adopted model is an ATLAS12 model already used for\nthe abundance analysis of a high-resolution optical spectrum observed at ESO\nwith UVES. The stellar parameters are Teff=13450K, logg=4.3, and zero\nmicroturbulent velocity. Abundances for 28 elements and 7 upper limits were\nderived from the ultraviolet spectrum. Adding results from previous work, we\nhave now quantitative results for 37 elements, some of which show striking\ncontrasts with those of a broad sample of HgMn stars. The analysis has pointed\nout ionization anomalies and line-to-line variation in the derived abundances,\nin particular for silicon. The inferred discrepancies could be explained by\nnon-LTE effects and with the occurrence of diffusion and vertical abundance\nstratification. In the framework of the last hypothesis, we obtained, by means\nof trial and error, empirical step functions of abundance versus optical depth\nlog(tau_5000) for carbon, silicon, manganese, and gold, while we failed to find\nsuch a function for phosphorous.\n", "  Heavy ion collisions at extremely high energy, such as the top energy at\nRHIC, exhibit the property of transparency where there is a clear separation\nbetween the almost net-baryon-free central rapidity region and the\nnet-baryon-rich fragmentation region. We calculate the net-baryon rapidity loss\nand the nuclear excitation energy using the energy-momentum tensor obtained\nfrom the McLerran-Venugopalan model. Nuclear compression during the collision\nis further estimated using a simple space-time picture. The results show that\nextremely high baryon densities, about twenty times larger than the normal\nnuclear density, can be achieved in the fragmentation regions.\n", "  Non-Hermitian systems with $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can possess purely real\neigenvalue spectra. In this work two one-dimensional systems with two different\ntopological phases, the topological nontrivial Phase (TNP) and the topological\ntrivial phase (TTP) combined with $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian\npotentials are investigated. The models of choice are the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\n(SSH) model and the Kitaev chain. The interplay of a spontaneous\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking due to gain and loss with the topological\nphase is different for the two models. The SSH model undergoes a\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition in the TNP immediately with the\npresence of a non-vanishing gain and loss strength $\\gamma$, whereas the TTP\nexhibits a parameter regime in which a purely real eigenvalue spectrum exists.\nFor the Kitaev chain the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking is independent of the\ntopological phase. We show that the topological interesting states -- the edge\nstates -- are the reason for the different behaviors of the two models and that\nthe intrinsic particle-hole symmetry of the edge states in the Kitaev chain is\nresponsible for a conservation of $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in the TNP.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss dark matter candidates in a visible heavy QCD axion\nmodel. There, a mirror copied sector of the Standard Model with mass scales\nlarger than the Standard Model is introduced. By larger mass scales of the\nmirrored sector, the QCD axion is made heavy via the axial anomaly in the\nmirrored sector without spoiling the Peccei-Quinn mechanism to solve the strong\n$CP$-problem. Since the mirror copied sector possesses the same symmetry\nstructure with the Standard Model sector, the model predicts multiple stable\nparticles. As we will show, the mirrored charged pion and the mirrored electron\ncan be viable candidates for dark matter. They serve as self-interacting dark\nmatter with a long range force. We also show that the mirrored neutron can be\nlighter than the mirrored proton in a certain parameter region. There, the\nmirrored neutron can also be a viable dark matter candidate when its mass is\naround $100$ TeV. It is also shown that the mirrored neutrino can also be a\nviable candidate for dark matter.\n", "  We discuss the impact on the study of gluon transverse momentum dependent\ndistributions (TMDs) of the associated production of a lepton pair and a\n$\\Upsilon$ (or a $J/\\psi$) in unpolarised proton-proton collisions, $pp\\to\n{\\cal Q} \\, \\ell \\bar{\\ell} X$, at LHC energies, where one can assume that such\nfinal states are dominantly induced by gluon fusion. If the transverse momentum\nof the quarkonium-dilepton system - namely, the transverse momentum imbalance\nof the quarkonium state and the lepton pair - is small, the corresponding cross\nsections can be calculated within the framework of TMD factorisation. Using the\nhelicity formalism, we show in detail how these cross sections are connected to\nthe moments of two independent TMDs: the distribution of unpolarised gluons,\n$f_1^g$, and the distribution of linearly polarised gluons, $h_1^{\\perp g}$. We\ncomplete our exhaustive derivation of these general relations with a\nphenomenological analysis of the feasibility of the TMD extraction, as well as\nsome outlooks.\n", "  The strong light matter interaction and the valley selective optical\nselection rules make monolayer (ML) MoS2 an exciting 2D material for\nfundamental physics and optoelectronics applications. But so far optical\ntransition linewidths even at low temperature are typically as large as a few\ntens of meV and contain homogenous and inhomogeneous contributions. This\nprevented in-depth studies, in contrast to the better-characterized ML\nmaterials MoSe2 and WSe2. In this work we show that encapsulation of ML MoS2 in\nhexagonal boron nitride can efficiently suppress the inhomogeneous contribution\nto the exciton linewidth, as we measure in photoluminescence and reflectivity a\nFWHM down to 2 meV at T = 4K. This indicates that surface protection and\nsubstrate flatness are key ingredients for obtaining stable, high quality\nsamples. Among the new possibilities offered by the well-defined optical\ntransitions we measure the homogeneous broadening induced by the interaction\nwith phonons in temperature dependent experiments. We uncover new information\non spin and valley physics and present the rotation of valley coherence in\napplied magnetic fields perpendicular to the ML.\n", "  We present the synthesis and a detailed investigation of structural and\nmagnetic properties of polycrystalline\nNH$_4$[(V$_2$O$_3$)$_2$(4,4$^\\prime$-$bpy$)$_2$(H$_2$PO$_4$)(PO$_4$)$_2$]$\\cdot$0.5H$_2$O\nby means of x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, electron spin\nresonance, and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. Temperature\ndependent magnetic susceptibility could be described well using a weakly\ncoupled spin-$1/2$ dimer model with an excitation gap $\\Delta/k_{\\rm B}\\simeq\n26.1$ K between the singlet ground state and triplet excited states and a weak\ninter-dimer exchange coupling $J^\\prime/k_{\\rm B} \\simeq 4.6$ K. A gapped chain\nmodel also describes the data well with a gap of about 20 K. The ESR intensity\nas a function of temperature traces the bulk susceptibility nicely. The\nisotropic Land$\\acute{\\rm e}$ $g$-factor is estimated to be about $g \\simeq\n1.97$, at room temperature. We are able to resolve the $^{31}$P NMR signal as\ncoming from two inequivalent P-sites in the crystal structure. The hyperfine\ncoupling constant between $^{31}$P nucleus and V$^{4+}$ spins is calculated to\nbe $A_{\\rm hf}(1) \\simeq 2963$ Oe/$\\mu_{\\rm B}$ and $A_{\\rm hf}(2) \\simeq 1466$\nOe/$\\mu_{\\rm B}$ for the P(1) and P(2) sites, respectively. Our NMR shift and\nspin-lattice relaxation rate for both the $^{31}$P sites show an activated\nbehaviour at low temperatures, further confirming the singlet ground state. The\nestimated value of the spin gap from the NMR data measured in an applied field\nof $H = 9.394$ T is consistent with the gap obtained from the magnetic\nsusceptibility analysis using the dimer model. Because of a relatively small\nspin gap,\nNH$_4$[(V$_2$O$_3$)$_2$(4,4$^\\prime$-$bpy$)$_2$(H$_2$PO$_4$)(PO$_4$)$_2$]$\\cdot$0.5H$_2$O\nis a promising compound for further experimental studies under high magnetic\nfields.\n", "  We reconsider the minimal SU(5) Grand Unified Theory (GUT) in the context of\nno-scale supergravity, assuming that the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters\nsatisfy universality conditions at some input scale M_in above the GUT scale\nM_GUT. When setting up such a no-scale super-GUT model, special attention must\nbe paid to avoiding the Scylla of rapid proton decay and the Charybdis of an\nexcessive density of cold dark matter, while also having an acceptable mass for\nthe Higgs boson. We do not find consistent solutions if none of the matter and\nHiggs fields are assigned to twisted chiral supermultiplets, even in the\npresence of Giudice-Masiero terms. However, consistent solutions may be found\nif at least one fiveplet of GUT Higgs fields is assigned to a twisted chiral\nsupermultiplet, with a suitable choice of modular weights. Spin-independent\ndark matter scattering may be detectable in some of these consistent solutions.\n", "  There are presently several discrepancies in $b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ decays\nof $B$ mesons suggesting new physics coupling to $b$ quarks and leptons. We\nshow that a $Z'$, with couplings to quarks and muons that can explain the\n$B$-decay anomalies, can also couple to dark matter in a way that is consistent\nwith its relic abundance, direct detection limits, and hints of indirect\ndetection. The latter include possible excess events in antiproton spectra\nrecently observed by the AMS-02 experiment. We present two models, having a\nheavy (light) $Z'$ with $m_{Z'}\\sim 600\\,(12)\\,$GeV and fermionic dark matter\nwith mass $m_\\chi \\sim 50\\,(2000)\\,$GeV, producing excess antiprotons with\nenergies of $\\sim 10\\, (300)\\,$GeV. The first model is also compatible with\nfits for the galactic center GeV gamma-ray excess.\n", "  A fundamental challenge of the theory of liquids is to understand the\nsimilarities and differences in the macroscopic dynamics of both colloidal and\natomic liquids, which originate in the (Newtonian or Brownian) nature of the\nmicroscopic motion of their constituents. Starting from the recently-discovered\nlong-time dynamic equivalence between a colloidal and an atomic liquid that\nshare the same interparticle pair potential, in this work we develop a\nself-consistent generalized Langevin equation (SCGLE) theory for the dynamics\nof equilibrium multicomponent atomic liquids, applicable as an approximate but\nquantitative theory describing the long-time diffusive dynamical properties of\nsimple equilibrium atomic liquids. When complemented with a Gaussian-like\napproximation, this theory is also able to provide a reasonable representation\nof the passage from ballistic to diffusive behavior. We illustrate the\napplicability of the resulting theory with three particular examples, namely, a\nmonodisperse and a polydisperse monocomponent hard-sphere liquid, and a highly\nsize-asymmetric binary hard-sphere mixture. To assess the quantitative accuracy\nof our results, we perform event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, which\ncorroborate the general features of the theoretical predictions.\n", "  By two-color photoassociation of $^{40}$Ca four weakly bound vibrational\nlevels in the Ca$_2$ \\Xpot ground state potential were measured, using highly\nspin-forbidden transitions to intermediate states of the coupled system\n$^3\\Pi_{u}$ and $^3\\Sigma^+ _{u}$ near the ${^3P_1}$+${^1S_0}$ asymptote. From\nthe observed binding energies, including the least bound state, the long range\ndispersion coefficients $\\mathrm{C}_6, \\mathrm{C}_8,\\mathrm{C}_{10}$ and a\nprecise value for the s-wave scattering length of 308.5(50)~$a_0$ were derived.\nFrom mass scaling we also calculated the corresponding scattering length for\nother natural isotopes. From the Autler-Townes splitting of the spectra, the\nmolecular Rabi frequency has been determined as function of the laser intensity\nfor one bound-bound transition. The observed value for the Rabi-frequency is in\ngood agreement with calculated transition moments based on the derived\npotentials, assuming a dipole moment being independent of internuclear\nseparation for the atomic pair model.\n", "  We present results of numerical simulation of the direct cascade in\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence (with spatial resolution up to $16384\n\\times 16384$). If at the earlier stage (at the time of order of the inverse\npumping growth rate $\\tau\\sim\\Gamma_{max}^{-1}$), the turbulence develops\naccording to the same scenario as in the case of a freely decaying turbulence\n\\cite{KNNR-07, KKS}: quasi-singular distributions of di-vorticity are formed,\nwhich in $k$-space correspond to jets, leading to a strong turbulence\nanisotropy, then for times of the order of $10\\tau$ turbulence becomes almost\nisotropic. In particular, at these times any significant anisotropy in the\nangular fluctuations for the energy spectrum (for a fixed $k$) is not visible,\nwhile the probability distribution function of vorticity for large arguments\nhas the exponential tail with the exponent linearly dependent on vorticity, in\nthe agreement with the theoretical prediction \\cite{FalkovichLebedev2011}.\n", "  We give a geometric description of supersymmetric gravity/(non-)abelian\n$p$-form hierarchies in superspaces with 4D, $N = 1$ super-Poincare invariance.\nThese hierarchies give rise to Chern-Simons-like invariants, such as those of\nthe 5D, $N = 1$ graviphoton and the eleven-dimensional 3-form but also\ngeneralizations such as Green-Schwarz-like/BF-type couplings. Previous\nconstructions based on prepotential superfields are reinterpreted in terms of\n$p$-forms in superspace thereby elucidating the underlying geometry. This\nvastly simplifies the calculations of superspace field-strengths, Bianchi\nidentities, and Chern-Simons invariants. Using this, we prove the validity of a\nrecursive formula for the conditions defining these actions for any such tensor\nhierarchy. Solving it at quadratic and cubic orders, we recover the known\nresults for the BF-type and cubic Chern-Simons actions. As an application, we\ncompute the quartic invariant $\\sim A dA dA dA + \\ldots$ relevant, for example,\nto seven-dimensional supergravity compactifications.\n", "  We study the resummation of soft gluon emission corrections to the production\nof a top-antitop pair in association with a Z boson at the Large Hadron\nCollider to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. By means of an\nin-house parton level Monte Carlo code we evaluate the resummation formula for\nthe total cross section and several differential distributions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and we match these calculations to\nnext-to-leading order results.\n", "  In a previous paper, we assembled a collection of medium-resolution spectra\nof 35 carbon stars, covering optical and near-infrared wavelengths from 400 to\n2400 nm. The sample includes stars from the Milky Way and the Magellanic\nClouds, with a variety of $(J-K_s)$ colors and pulsation properties. In the\npresent paper, we compare these observations to a new set of high-resolution\nsynthetic spectra, based on hydrostatic model atmospheres. We find that the\nbroad-band colors and the molecular-band strengths measured by\nspectrophotometric indices match those of the models when $(J-K_s)$ is bluer\nthan about 1.6, while the redder stars require either additional reddening or\ndust emission or both. Using a grid of models to fit the full observed spectra,\nwe estimate the most likely atmospheric parameters $T_\\mathrm{eff}$, $\\log(g)$,\n$[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ and C/O. These parameters derived independently in the\noptical and near-infrared are generally consistent when $(J-K_s)<1.6$. The\ntemperatures found based on either wavelength range are typically within\n$\\pm$100K of each other, and $\\log(g)$ and $[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ are consistent\nwith the values expected for this sample. The reddest stars ($(J-K_s)$ $>$ 1.6)\nare divided into two families, characterized by the presence or absence of an\nabsorption feature at 1.53\\,$\\mu$m, generally associated with HCN and\nC$_2$H$_2$. Stars from the first family begin to be more affected by\ncircumstellar extinction. The parameters found using optical or near-infrared\nwavelengths are still compatible with each other, but the error bars become\nlarger. In stars showing the 1.53\\,$\\mu$m feature, which are all\nlarge-amplitude variables, the effects of pulsation are strong and the spectra\nare poorly matched with hydrostatic models. For these, atmospheric parameters\ncould not be derived reliably, and dynamical models are needed for proper\ninterpretation.\n", "  We study the charged slowly rotating black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell\ntheory in the large dimensions. By using the 1/D expansion in the near region\nof the black hole we obtain the effective equations for the charged slowly\nrotating black holes. The effective equations describe the charged black ring,\nthe charged slowly rotating Myers-Perry black hole and the charged slowly\nboosted black string as stationary solutions. By embedding the solution of the\neffective equations into the flat spacetime background in the ring coordinate\nwe obtain the charged black ring solution at large D analytically. We find that\nthe charge lowers the angular momentum of the black ring due to the regular\ncondition on the solution. By the perturbation analysis of the effective\nequations, we obtain the quasinormal modes of the charge perturbation and the\ngravitational perturbation analytically. Like the neutral case the charged thin\nblack ring suffers from the Gregory-Laflamme-like instability under\nnon-axisymmetric perturbations, but the charge helps weaken the instability.\nBesides, we find that the large D analysis always respect the cosmic\ncensorship.\n", "  We evaluate an efficient overset grid method for two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional particulate flows for small numbers of particles at finite\nReynolds number. The rigid particles are discretised using moving overset grids\noverlaid on a Cartesian background grid. This allows for strongly-enforced\nboundary conditions and local grid refinement at particle surfaces, thereby\naccurately capturing the viscous boundary layer at modest computational cost.\nThe incompressible Navier--Stokes equations are solved with a fractional-step\nscheme which is second-order-accurate in space and time, while the fluid--solid\ncoupling is achieved with a partitioned approach including multiple\nsub-iterations to increase stability for light, rigid bodies. Through a series\nof benchmark studies we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this\napproach compared to other boundary conformal and static grid methods in the\nliterature. In particular, we find that fully resolving boundary layers at\nparticle surfaces is crucial to obtain accurate solutions to many common test\ncases. With our approach we are able to compute accurate solutions using as\nlittle as one third the number of grid points as uniform grid computations in\nthe literature. A detailed convergence study shows a 13-fold decrease in CPU\ntime over a uniform grid test case whilst maintaining comparable solution\naccuracy.\n", "  The analysis of the Parker-Moffatt problem, recently revisited in Pezzi et\nal. (2016), is here extended by including the Hall magnetohydrodynamics and two\nhybrid kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell numerical models. The presence of dispersive and\nkinetic features is studied in detail and a comparison between the two kinetic\ncodes is also reported. Focus on the presence of non-Maxwellian signatures\nshows that - during the collision - regions characterized by strong temperature\nanisotropy are recovered and the proton distribution function displays a beam\nalong the direction of the magnetic field, similar to some recent observations\nof the solar wind.\n", "  The problem of a crack impinging on an interface has been thoroughly\ninvestigated in the last three decades due to its important role in the\nmechanics and physics of solids. In this investigation, this problem is\nrevisited in view of the recent progresses on the phase field approach to\nbrittle fracture. In this concern, a novel formulation combining the phase\nfield approach for modeling brittle fracture in the bulk and a cohesive zone\nmodel for pre-existing adhesive interfaces is herein proposed to investigate\nthe competition between crack penetration and deflection at an interface. The\nmodel, implemented within the finite element method framework using a\nmonolithic fully implicit solution strategy, is applied to provide a further\ninsight into the understanding of the role of model parameters on the above\ncompetition. In particular, in this study, the role of the fracture toughness\nratio between the interface and the adjoining bulks and the characteristic\nfracture-length scales of the dissipative models are analyzed. In the case of a\nbrittle interface, the asymptotic predictions based on linear elastic fracture\nmechanics criteria for crack penetration, single deflection or double\ndeflection are fully captured by the present method. Moreover, by increasing\nthe size of the process zone along the interface, or by varying the internal\nlength scale of the phase field model, new complex phenomena are emerging, such\nas simultaneous crack penetration and deflection and the transition from single\ncrack penetration to deflection and penetration with subsequent branching into\nthe bulk.\n", "  The direct discovery of gravitational waves from compact binary systems leads\nfor the first time to explore the possibility of black hole spectroscopy. Newly\nformed black holes produced by coalescing events are copious emitters of\ngravitational radiation, in the form of damped sinusoids, the quasi normal\nmodes. The latter provide a precious source of information on the nature of\ngravity in the strong field regime, as they represent a powerful tool to\ninvestigate the validity of the no-hair theorem. In this work we perform a\nsystematic study on the accuracy with which current and future interferometers\nwill measure the fundamental parameters of ringdown events, such as frequencies\nand damping times. We analyze how these errors affect the estimate of the mass\nand the angular momentum of the final black hole, constraining the parameter\nspace which will lead to the most precise measurements. We explore both single\nand multimode events, showing how the uncertainties evolve when multiple\ndetectors are available. We also prove that, for second generation of\ninterferometers, a network of instruments is a crucial and necessary ingredient\nto perform strong-gravity tests of the no-hair theorem. Finally, we analyze the\nconstraints that a third generation of detectors may be able to set on the\nmode's parameters, comparing the projected bounds against those obtained for\ncurrent facilities.\n", "  We derive the gravitational energy momentum tensor $\\tau^{\\eta}_{\\alpha}$ for\na general Lagrangian of any order $L=L\\left(g_{\\mu\\nu}, g_{\\mu\\nu,i_{1}},\ng_{\\mu\\nu,i_{1}i_{2}},g_{\\mu\\nu,i_{1}i_{2}i_{3}},\\cdots,\ng_{\\mu\\nu,i_{1}i_{2}i_{3}\\cdots i_{n}}\\right)$ and in particular for a\nLagrangian such as $L_{g}=(\\overline{R}+a_{0}R^{2}+\\sum_{k=1}^{p}\na_{k}R\\Box^{k}R)\\sqrt{-g}$. We prove that this tensor, in general, is not\ncovariant but only affine, then it is a pseudo-tensor. Furthermore, the\npseudo-tensor $\\tau^{\\eta}_{\\alpha}$ is calculated in the weak field limit up\nto a first non-vanishing term of order $h^{2}$ where $h$ is the metric\nperturbation. The average value of the pseudo-tensor over a suitable spacetime\ndomain is obtained. Finally we calculate the power per unit solid angle\n$\\Omega$ carried by a gravitational wave in a direction $\\hat{x}$ for a fixed\nwave number $\\mathbf{k}$ under a suitable gauge. These results are useful in\nview of searching for further modes of gravitational radiation beyond the\nstandard two modes of General Relativity and to deal with nonlocal theories of\ngravity where terms involving $\\Box R$ are present. The general aim of the\napproach is to deal with theories of any order under the same standard of\nLandau pseudo-tensor.\n", "  We have synthesized AgSn1-xBixSe2 polycrystalline samples to investigate the\neffect of partial substitution of mixed-valence Sn by Bi3+ to the\nsuperconductivity of the valence-skip superconductor AgSnSe2. The\nBi-substituted AgSn1-xBixSe2 were obtained up to x = 0.2, but an insulating\nphase Ag2SnBi2Se5 with a NaCl-type structure showed up above x = 0.3. The\nsuperconducting transition temperature increased from 4.5 K (x = 0) to 5.0 K (x\n= 0.1) by Bi substitution. The enhancement of superconductivity by the\nsuppression of the valence-skip states of Sn suggests that the valence-skip\nstates of Sn are not positively linked to the pairing mechanisms of\nsuperconductivity in the AgSnSe2 system.\n", "  We consider $\\mathcal N=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theories in four dimensions (pure or\nmass deformed) and discuss the properties of the simplest chiral observables in\nthe presence of a generic $\\Omega$-deformation. We compute them by equivariant\nlocalization and analyze the structure of the exact instanton corrections to\nthe classical chiral ring relations. We predict exact relations valid at all\ninstanton number among the traces $\\langle\\text{Tr}\\varphi^{n}\\rangle$, where\n$\\varphi$ is the scalar field in the gauge multiplet. In the\nNekrasov-Shatashvili limit, such relations may be explained in terms of the\navailable quantized Seiberg-Witten curves. Instead, the full two-parameter\ndeformation enjoys novel features and the ring relations require non trivial\nadditional derivative terms with respect to the modular parameter. Higher rank\ngroups are briefly discussed emphasizing non-factorization of correlators due\nto the $\\Omega$-deformation. Finally, the structure of the deformed ring\nrelations in the $\\mathcal N=2^{\\star}$ theory is analyzed from the point of\nview of the Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa correspondence proving consistency as well\nas some interesting universality properties.\n", "  A temperature dependent bulk viscosity coefficient is used in 3+1D\nhydrodynamic simulations. I study the effect of the increase of bulk viscosity\naround the critical temperature on the system dynamics in central Pb+Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2760$~GeV. With increasing bulk viscosity the\nlife-time of the system increases slightly. Also the shape of the freeze-out\nhypersurface changes, the outer layers of the fireball live longer. This effect\ncauses a small reduction of the ratio of two interferometry radii\n$R_{out}/R_{side}$, improving the agreement with experimental data.\n", "  We discuss a modification of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)\nsubtraction scheme based on the residue-improved sector decomposition that\nreduces the number of double-real emission sectors from five to four. In\nparticular, a sector where energies and angles of unresolved particles vanish\nin a correlated fashion is redundant and can be discarded. This simple\nobservation allows us to formulate a transparent iterative subtraction\nprocedure for double-real emission contributions, to demonstrate the\ncancellation of soft and collinear singularities in an explicit and (almost)\nprocess-independent way and to write the result of a NNLO calculation in terms\nof quantities that can be computed in four space-time dimensions. We illustrate\nthis procedure explicitly in the simple case of $O(\\alpha_s^2)$ gluonic\ncorrections to the Drell-Yan process of $q \\bar q$ annihilation into a lepton\npair. We show that this framework leads to fast and numerically stable\ncomputation of QCD corrections.\n", "  We extend the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^5)$ result of the analytic calculation of\nthe quark mass anomalous dimension in pQCD [1] to the case of a generic gauge\ngroup. We present explicit formulas which express the relevant renormalization\nconstants in terms of four-loop massless propagators. We also use our result to\nshed new light on the old puzzle of the absence of even zetas in results of\nperturbative calculations for a class of physical observables.\n", "  The diffusion-driven self-assembly of rod-like particles was studied by means\nof Monte Carlo simulation. The rods were represented as linear $k$-mers (i.e.,\nparticles occupying $k$ adjacent sites). In the initial state, they were\ndeposited onto a two-dimensional square lattice of size $L\\times L$ up to the\njamming concentration using a random sequential adsorption algorithm. The size\nof the lattice, $L$, was varied from $128$ to $2048$, and periodic boundary\nconditions were applied along both $x$ and $y$ axes, while the length of the\n$k$-mers (determining the aspect ratio) was varied from $2$ to $12$. The\n$k$-mers oriented along the $x$ and $y$ directions ($k_x$-mers and $k_y$-mers,\nrespectively) were deposited equiprobably. In the course of the simulation, the\nnumbers of intraspecific and interspecific contacts between the same sort and\nbetween different sorts of $k$-mers, respectively, were calculated. Both the\nshift ratio of the actual number of shifts along the longitudinal or transverse\naxes of the $k$-mers and the electrical conductivity of the system were also\nexamined. For the initial random configuration, quite different\nself-organization behavior was observed for short and long $k$-mers. For long\n$k$-mers ($k\\geq 6$), three main stages of diffusion-driven spatial segregation\n(self-assembly) were identified: the initial stage, reflecting destruction of\nthe jamming state, the intermediate stage, reflecting continuous cluster\ncoarsening and labyrinth pattern formation and the final stage, reflecting the\nformation of diagonal stripe domains. Additional examination of two\nartificially constructed initial configurations showed that this pattern of\ndiagonal stripe domains is an attractor, i.e., any spatial distribution of\n$k$-mers tends to transform into diagonal stripes. Nevertheless, the time for\nrelaxation to the steady state essentially increases as the lattice size\ngrowth.\n", "  We define and examine a model of epidemic propagation for a virus such as\nHepatitis C (with HIV co-infection) on a network of networks, namely the\nnetwork of French urban areas. One network level is that of the individual\ninteractions inside each urban area. The second level is that of the areas\nthemselves, linked by individuals travelling between these areas and\npotentially helping the epidemic spread from one city to another. We choose to\nencode the second level of the network as extra, special nodes in the first\nlevel. We observe that such an encoding leads to sensible results in terms of\nthe extent and speed of propagation of an epidemic, depending on its source\npoint.\n", "  We present a method to systematically study multi-photon transmission in one\ndimensional systems comprised of correlated quantum emitters coupled to input\nand output waveguides. Within the Green's function approach of the scattering\nmatrix (S-matrix), we develop a diagrammatic technique to analytically obtain\nthe system's scattering amplitudes while at the same time visualise all the\npossible absorption and emission processes. Our method helps to reduce the\nsignificant effort in finding the general response of a many-body bosonic\nsystem, particularly the nonlinear response embedded in the Green's functions.\nWe demonstrate our proposal through physically relevant examples involving\nscattering of multi-photon states from two-level emitters as well as from\narrays of correlated Kerr nonlinear resonators in the Bose-Hubbard model.\n", "  We present the first experimental demonstration over a 43-km-long urban fiber\nnetwork of a local two-way optical frequency comparison, which does not require\nany synchronization of the measurements. It was combined with a regular\nactive-noise compensation on another parallel fiber leading to a very reliable\nand robust frequency transfer. This hybrid scheme enables us to investigate the\nmajor limiting factors of the local two-way comparison. We analyze the\ncontribution to the phase noise of the recovered signal by the interferometers\nat local and remote places. By using the ability of this set up to be injected\nby a single laser or two independent lasers, we measure the contribution to the\nlong-term instability by the demodulated laser instabilities. We show that a\nfractional frequency instability level of $1\\times10^{-20}$ at 10 000 s can be\nobtained with this simple setup after 43-km-long propagation in an urban area.\n", "  Rotation of molecules embedded in He nanodroplets is explored by a\ncombination of fs laser-induced alignment experiments and angulon quasiparticle\ntheory. We demonstrate that at low fluence of the fs alignment pulse, the\nmolecule and its solvation shell can be set into coherent collective rotation\nlasting long enough to form revivals. With increasing fluence, however, the\nrevivals disappear -- instead, rotational dynamics as rapid as for an isolated\nmolecule is observed during the first few picoseconds. Classical calculations\ntrace this phenomenon to transient decoupling of the molecule from its He\nshell. Our results open novel opportunities for studying non-equilibrium\nsolute-solvent dynamics and quantum thermalization.\n", "  We investigate the formation of optical localized nonlinear structures,\nevolving upon a non-zero background plane wave, in a dispersive quadratic\nmedium. We show the existence of quadratic Akhmediev breathers and Peregrine\nsolitary waves, in the regime of cascading second-harmonic generation. This\nfinding opens a novel path for the excitation of extreme rogue waves and for\nthe description of modulation instability in quadratic nonlinear optics.\n", "  AIM: In this study we examine rotational emission lines of two isotopologues\nof water: H$_2$$^{17}$O and H$_2$$^{18}$O. By determining the abundances of\nthese molecules, we aim to use the derived isotopologue --- and hence oxygen\nisotope --- ratios to put constraints on the masses of a sample of M-type AGB\nstars that have not been classified as OH/IR stars. METHODS: We use detailed\nradiative transfer analysis based on the accelerated lambda iteration method to\nmodel the circumstellar molecular line emission of H$_2$$^{17}$O and\nH$_2$$^{18}$O for IK Tau, R Dor, W Hya, and R Cas. The emission lines used to\nconstrain our models come from Herschel/HIFI and Herschel/PACS observations and\nare all optically thick, meaning that full radiative transfer analysis is the\nonly viable method of estimating molecular abundance ratios. RESULTS: We find\ngenerally low values of the $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratio for our sample, ranging\nfrom 0.15 to 0.69. This correlates with relatively low initial masses, in the\nrange $\\sim1.0$ to 1.5 M$_\\odot$ for each source, based on stellar evolutionary\nmodels. We also find ortho-to-para ratios close to 3, which are expected from\nwarm formation predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratios found for\nthis sample are at the lower end of the range predicted by stellar evolutionary\nmodels, indicating that the sample chosen had relatively low initial masses.\n", "  Understanding high-field amplitude electromagnetic heat loss phenomena is of\ngreat importance, in particular in the biomedical field, since the\nheat-delivery treatment plans might rely on analytical models that are only\nvalid at low field amplitudes. Here, we develop a nonlinear response model\nvalid for single- domain nanoparticles of larger particle sizes and higher\nfield amplitudes in comparison to linear response theory. A nonlinear\nmagnetization expression and a generalized heat loss power equation are\nobtained and compared with the exact solution of the stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation assuming the giant-spin hypothesis. The model\nis valid within the hyperthermia therapeutic window and predicts a shift of\noptimum particle size and distinct heat loss field amplitude exponents.\nExperimental hyperthermia data with distinct ferrite-based nanoparticles, as\nwell as third harmonic magnetization data supports the nonlinear model, which\nalso has implications for magnetic particle imaging and magnetic thermometry.\n", "  High-mass diffractive production of protons on the deuteron target is studied\nin the perturbative QCD in the BFKL approach. Leading order rearrangement\ncontribution and the standard triple pomeron (the impulse approximation) are\nstudied. In the perturbative limit $\\alpha_s\\to 0$ the rearrangement\ncontribution dominates. Numerical estimates at realistic values of $\\alpha_s$\nand energies strongly depend on assumptions made about the behavior of the\npomeron attached to the proton due to unitarization. They indicate that\nirrespective of these assumptions in the realistic situation the rearrangement\nand triple pomeron contributions turn out to be of comparable magnitude due to\nlarge dimensions of the deuteron.\n", "  The formation of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks is not\nwell-understood. Streaming instability is a promising mechanism to directly\nform planetesimals from pebble-sized particles, provided a high enough\nsolids-to-gas ratio. However, local enhancements of the solids-to-gas ratio are\ndifficult to realize in a smooth disk, which motivates the consideration of\nspecial disk locations such as the snowline. In this article we investigate the\nviability of planetesimal formation by streaming instability near the snowline\ndue to water diffusion and condensation. We adopt a viscous disk model, and\nnumerically solve the transport equations for vapor and solids on a\ncylindrical, 1D grid. We take into account radial drift of solids, gas\naccretion on to the central star, and turbulent diffusion. We study the\nimportance of the back-reaction of solids on the gas and of the radial\nvariation of the mean molecular weight of the gas. We find that water diffusion\nand condensation can locally enhance the ice surface density by a factor 3--5\noutside the snowline. Assuming that icy pebbles contain many micron-sized\nsilicate grains that are released during evaporation, the enhancement is\nincreased by another factor $\\sim$$2$. In this `many-seeds' model, the\nsolids-to-gas ratio interior to the snowline is enhanced as well, but not as\nmuch as just outside the snowline. In the context of a viscous disk, the\ndiffusion-condensation mechanism is most effective for high values of the\nturbulence parameter $\\alpha$ ($10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$). Therefore, assuming young\ndisks are more vigorously turbulent than older disks, planetesimals near the\nsnowline can form in an early stage of the disk. In highly turbulent disks,\ntens of Earth masses can be stored in an annulus outside the snowline, which\ncan be identified with recent ALMA observations.\n", "  With the motivation of searching for new superconductors in the Mg-B system,\nwe performed ab initio evolutionary searches for all the stable compounds in\nthis binary system in the pressure range of 0-200 GPa. We found previously\nunknown, yet thermodynamically stable, compositions MgB$_3$ and Mg$_3$B$_{10}$.\nExperimentally known MgB$_2$ is stable in the entire pressure range 0-200 GPa,\nwhile MgB$_7$ and MgB$_{12}$ are stable at pressures below 90 GPa and 35 GPa,\nrespectively. We predict a reentrant behavior for MgB$_4$, which becomes\nunstable against decomposition into MgB$_2$ and MgB$_7$ at 4 GPa and then\nbecomes stable above 61 GPa. We find ubiquity of phases with boron sandwich\nstructures analogous to the AlB$_2$-type structure. However, with the exception\nof MgB$_2$, all other magnesium borides have low electron-phonon coupling\nconstants $\\lambda$ of 0.32 to 0.39 and are predicted to have T$_c$ below 3 K.\n", "  Solar flares are sudden and violent releases of magnetic energy in the solar\natmosphere that can be divided in eruptive flares, when plasma is ejected from\nthe solar atmosphere, resulting in a coronal mass ejection (CME), and confined\nflares when no CME is associated with the flare. We present a case-study\nshowing the evolution of key topological structures, such as spines and fans\nwhich may determine the eruptive versus non-eruptive behavior of the series of\neruptive flares, followed by confined flares, which are all originating from\nthe same site. To study the connectivity of the different flux domains and\ntheir evolution, we compute a potential magnetic field model of the active\nregion. Quasi-separatrix layers are retrieved from the magnetic field\nextrapolation. The change of behavior of the flares from one day to the next\n-eruptive to confined- can be attributed to the change of orientation of the\nmagnetic field below the fan with respect to the orientation of the overlaying\nspine, rather than an overall change in the stability of the large scale field.\nFlares tend to be more-and-more confined when the field that supports the\nfilament and the overlying field gradually become less-and-less anti-parallel,\nas a direct result of changes in the photospheric flux distribution, being\nthemselves driven by continuous shearing motions of the different magnetic flux\nconcentrations.\n", "  One of the fundamental differences of compressible fluid flows from\nincompressible fluid flows is the involvement of thermodynamics. This\ndifference should be manifested in the design of numerical methods and seems\noften be neglected in addition that the entropy inequality, as a conceptual\nderivative, is taken into account to reflect irreversible processes and\nverified for some first order schemes. In this paper, we refine the GRP solver\nto illustrate how the thermodynamical variation is integrated into the design\nof high resolution methods for compressible fluid flows and demonstrate\nnumerically the importance of thermodynamic effect in the resolution of strong\nwaves. As a by-product, we show that the GRP solver works for generic equations\nof state, and is independent of technical arguments.\n", "  We demonstrate that the stray magnetic field generated beneath magnetic\nvortex cores can be used to generate nano-scale, localized pinning sites for\nmagnetic domain walls in an underlying, perpendicularly magnetized nanostrip.\nMoreover, the pinning strength can be tuned by toggling the vortex core\npolarity. Indeed, switching the core polarity so that it is aligned with the\nmagnetization of the expanding domain (rather than against it) can be used to\nreduce the vortex-mediated wall depinning field by between 40% and 90%,\ndepending on the system geometry. Significant reductions in the depinning field\ncan also be obtained in narrow strips by shifting the core away from the\nstrip's center.\n", "  We present a new model to explain the difference between the transport and\nspectroscopy gaps in samarium hexaboride (SmB$_6$), which has been a mystery\nfor some time. We propose that SmB$_6$ can be modeled as an intrinsic\nsemiconductor with a depletion length that diverges at cryogenic temperatures.\nIn this model, we find a self-consistent solution to Poisson's equation in the\nbulk, with boundary conditions based on Fermi energy pinning due to surface\ncharges. The solution yields band bending in the bulk; this explains the\ndifference between the two gaps because spectroscopic methods measure the gap\nnear the surface, while transport measures the average over the bulk. We also\nconnect the model to transport parameters, including the Hall coefficient and\nthermopower, using semiclassical transport theory. The divergence of the\ndepletion length additionally explains the 10-12 K feature in data for these\nparameters, demonstrating a crossover from bulk dominated transport above this\ntemperature to surface-dominated transport below this temperature. We find good\nagreement between our model and a collection of transport data from 4-40 K.\nThis model can also be generalized to materials with similar band structure.\n", "  We present the first measurement of the two-particle transverse momentum\ndifferential correlation function, $P_2\\equiv\\langle \\Delta p_{\\rm T} \\Delta\np_{\\rm T} \\rangle /\\langle p_{\\rm T} \\rangle^2$, in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}} =$ 2.76 TeV. Results for $P_2$ are reported as a function\nof relative pseudorapidity ($\\Delta \\eta$) and azimuthal angle ($\\Delta\n\\varphi$) between two particles for different collision centralities. The\n$\\Delta \\phi$ dependence is found to be largely independent of $\\Delta \\eta$\nfor $|\\Delta \\eta| \\geq$ 0.9. In 5% most central Pb-Pb collisions, the\ntwo-particle transverse momentum correlation function exhibits a clear\ndouble-hump structure around $\\Delta \\varphi = \\pi$ (i.e., on the away side),\nwhich is not observed in number correlations in the same centrality range, and\nthus provides an indication of the dominance of triangular flow in this\ncollision centrality. Fourier decompositions of $P_2$, studied as a function of\ncollision centrality, show that correlations at $|\\Delta \\eta| \\geq$ 0.9 can be\nwell reproduced by a flow ansatz based on the notion that measured momentum\ncorrelations are strictly determined by the collective motion of the system.\n", "  We experimentally and numerically investigate the temporal aspects of\nturbulent spots spreading in a plane Couette flow for transitional Reynolds\nnumbers between 300 and 450. Spot growth rate, spot advection rate and\nlarge-scale flow intensity are measured as a function of time and Reynolds\nnumber. All these quantities show similar dynamics clarifying the role played\nby large-scale flows in the advection of the turbulent spot. The contributions\nof each possible growth mechanism: growth induced by large scale advection or\ngrowth by destabilization, are discussed for the different stages of the spot\ngrowth. A scenario which gathers all these elements is providing a better\nunderstanding of the growth dynamics of turbulent spots in plane Couette flow\nthat should possibly apply to other extended shear flows.\n", "  The defect in diamond formed by a vacancy surrounded by three\nnearest-neighbor nitrogen atoms and one carbon atom,\n$\\mathrm{N}_{3}\\mathrm{V}$, is found in $\\approx98\\%$ of natural diamonds.\nDespite $\\mathrm{N}_{3}\\mathrm{V}^{0}$ being the earliest electron paramagnetic\nresonance spectrum observed in diamond, to date no satisfactory simulation of\nthe spectrum for an arbitrary magnetic field direction has been produced due to\nits complexity. In this work, $\\mathrm{N}_{3}\\mathrm{V}^{0}$ is identified in\n$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-doped synthetic diamond following irradiation and annealing.\nThe $\\mathrm{^{15}N}_{3}\\mathrm{V}^{0}$ spin Hamiltonian parameters are revised\nand used to refine the parameters for $\\mathrm{^{14}N}_{3}\\mathrm{V}^{0}$,\nenabling the latter to be accurately simulated and fitted for an arbitrary\nmagnetic field direction. Study of $\\mathrm{^{15}N}_{3}\\mathrm{V}^{0}$ under\nexcitation with green light indicates charge transfer between\n$\\mathrm{N}_{3}\\mathrm{V}$ and $\\mathrm{N_s}$. It is argued that this charge\ntransfer is facilitated by direct ionization of $\\mathrm{N}_{3}\\mathrm{V}^{-}$,\nan as-yet unobserved charge state of $\\mathrm{N}_{3}\\mathrm{V}$.\n", "  A precision of order one percent is needed on the parameters of\nexoplanet-hosts stars in order to correctly characterize the planets\nthemselves. This will be achieved by asteroseismology. It is important in this\ncontext to test the influence on the derived parameters of introducing atomic\ndiffusion with radiative accelerations in the models. In this paper, we begin\nthis study with the case of the star 94 Ceti A. We performed a complete\nasteroseismic analysis of the exoplanet-host F-type star 94 Ceti A, from the\nfirst radial-velocity observations with HARPS up to the final computed best\nmodels. This star is hot enough to suffer from important effects of atomic\ndiffusion, including radiative accelerations. We tested the influence of such\neffects on the computed frequencies and on the determined stellar parameters.\nWe also tested the effect of including a complete atmosphere in the stellar\nmodels. The radial velocity observations were done with HARPS in 2007. The low\ndegree modes were derived and identified using classical methods and compared\nwith the results obtained from stellar models computed with the Toulouse Geneva\nEvolution Code (TGEC). We obtained precise parameters for the star 94 Ceti A.\nWe showed that including atomic diffusion with radiative accelerations can\nmodify the age by a few percents, whereas adding a complete atmosphere does not\nchange the results by more than one percent.\n", "  Perpetual points (PPs) are special critical points for which the magnitude of\nacceleration describing dynamics drops to zero, while the motion is still\npossible (stationary points are excluded), e.g. considering the motion of the\nparticle in the potential field, at perpetual point it has zero acceleration\nand non-zero velocity. We show that using PPs we can trace all the stable fixed\npoints in the system, and that the structure of trajectories leading from\nformer points to stable equilibria may be similar to orbits obtained from\nunstable stationary points. Moreover, we argue that the concept of perpetual\npoints may be useful in tracing unexpected attractors (hidden or rare\nattractors with small basins of attraction). We show potential applicability of\nthis approach by analysing several representative systems of physical\nsignificance, including the damped oscillator, pendula and the Henon map. We\nsuggest that perpetual points may be a useful tool for localization of\nco-existing attractors in dynamical systems.\n", "  The \"unidentified\" infrared emission (UIE) features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6,\nand 11.3 $\\mu$m are ubiquitously seen in various astrophysical regions. The UIE\nfeatures are characteristic of the stretching and bending vibrations of\naromatic hydrocarbons. The 3.3 $\\mu$m feature resulting from aromatic C--H\nstretches is often accompanied by a weaker feature at 3.4 $\\mu$m often\nattributed to aliphatic C--H stretches. The ratio of the observed intensity of\nthe 3.3 $\\mu$m aromatic C--H feature ($I_{3.3}$) to that of the 3.4 $\\mu$m\naliphatic C--H feature ($I_{3.4}$) allows one to estimate the aliphatic\nfraction (i.e. $N_{\\rm C,aliph}/N_{\\rm C,arom}$, the number of C atoms in\naliphatic units to that in aromatic rings) of the UIE carriers, provided the\nintrinsic oscillator strengths of the 3.3 $\\mu$m aromatic C--H stretch\n($A_{3.3}$) and the 3.4 $\\mu$m aliphatic C--H stretch ($A_{3.4}$) are known.\n  In this article we summarize the computational results on $A_{3.3}$ and\n$A_{3.4}$ and their implications for the aromaticity and aliphaticity of the\nUIE carriers. We use density functional theory and second-order perturbation\ntheory to derive $A_{3.3}$ and $A_{3.4}$ from the infrared vibrational spectra\nof seven PAHs with various aliphatic substituents (e.g., methyl-, dimethyl-,\nethyl-, propyl-, butyl-PAHs, and PAHs with unsaturated alkyl-chains). The mean\nband strengths of the aromatic ($A_{3.3}$) and aliphatic ($A_{3.4}$) C--H\nstretches are derived and then employed to estimate the aliphatic fraction of\nthe UIE carriers by comparing $A_{3.4}$/$A_{3.3}$ with $I_{3.4}$/$I_{3.3}$. We\nconclude that the UIE emitters are predominantly aromatic, as revealed by the\nobservationally-derived ratio <$I_{3.4}$/$I_{3.3}$> ~ 0.12 and the\ncomputationally-derived ratio <$A_{3.4}$/$A_{3.3}$> ~ 1.76 which suggest an\nupper limit of $N_{\\rm C,aliph}/N_{\\rm C,arom}$ ~ 0.02 for the aliphatic\nfraction of the UIE carriers.\n", "  This paper describes the measurements of energy and time response and\nresolution of a 3 x 3 array made of undoped CsI crystals coupled to large area\nHamamatsu Multi Pixel Photon Counters. The measurements have been performed\nusing the electron beam of the Beam Test Facility in Frascati (Rome, Italy) in\nthe energy range 80-120 MeV. The measured energy resolution, estimated with the\nFWHM, at 100 MeV is 16.4%. This resolution is dominated by the energy leakage\ndue to the small dimensions of the prototype. The time is reconstructed by\nfitting the leading edge of the digitized signals and applying a digital\nconstant fraction discrimination technique. A time resolution of about 110 ps\nat 100 MeV is achieved.\n", "  Theoretical predictions of pressure-induced phase transformations often\nbecome long-standing enigmas because of limitations of contemporary available\nexperimental possibilities. Hitherto the existence of a non-icosahedral boron\nallotrope has been one of them. Here we report on the first non-icosahedral\nboron allotrope, which we denoted as {\\zeta}-B, with the orthorhombic\n{\\alpha}-Ga-type structure (space group Cmce) synthesized in a diamond anvil\ncell at extreme high-pressure high-temperature conditions (115 GPa and 2100 K).\nThe structure of {\\zeta}-B was solved using single-crystal synchrotron X-ray\ndiffraction and its compressional behavior was studied in the range of very\nhigh pressures (115 GPa to 135 GPa). Experimental validation of theoretical\npredictions reveals the degree of our up-to-date comprehension of condensed\nmatter and promotes further development of the solid state physics and\nchemistry.\n", "  We describe in detail the method used in our previous work arXiv:1611.10344\nto study the Wilson-Fisher critical points nearby generalized free CFTs,\nexploiting the analytic structure of conformal blocks as functions of the\nconformal dimension of the exchanged operator. Our method is equivalent to the\nmechanism of conformal multiplet recombination set up by null states. We\ncompute, to the first non-trivial order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion, the\nanomalous dimensions and the OPE coefficients of infinite classes of scalar\nlocal operators using just CFT data. We study single-scalar and\n$O(N)$-invariant theories, as well as theories with multiple deformations. When\navailable we agree with older results, but we also produce a wealth of new\nones. Unitarity and crossing symmetry are not used in our approach and we are\nable to apply our method to non-unitary theories as well. Some implications of\nour results for the study of the non-unitary theories containing partially\nconserved higher-spin currents are briefly mentioned.\n", "  Starting from the generalized pp waves that are exact vacuum solutions of\ngeneral relativity with a cosmological constant, we construct a new family of\nexact vacuum solutions of Poincar\\'e gauge theory, the generalized pp waves\nwith torsion. The ansatz for torsion is chosen in accordance with the wave\nnature of the solutions. For a subfamily of these solutions, the metric is\ndynamically determined by the torsion.\n", "  We perform a systematical study of possible molecular states composed of the\n$S$ wave heavy light mesons, where the $S-D$ mixing and {$\\eta-\\eta^{\\prime}$\nmixing} are explicitly included. Our calculation indicates that the observed\n$X(3872)$ could be a loosely shallow molecular state composed of $D\\bar{D}^\\ast\n+h.c$, while neither $Z_c(3900)/Z_c(4020)$ nor $Z_b(10610)/Z_b(10650)$ is\nsupported to be a molecule. Some observed possible molecular states are\npredicted, which could be searched for by further experimental measurements.\n", "  Feedback from accreting SMBHs is often identified as the main mechanism\nresponsible for regulating star-formation in AGN host galaxies. However, the\nrelationships between AGN activity, radiation, winds, and star-formation are\ncomplex and still far from being understood. We study scaling relations between\nAGN properties, host galaxy properties and AGN winds. We then evaluate the wind\nmean impact on the global star-formation history, taking into account the short\nAGN duty cycle with respect to that of star-formation. We first collect AGN\nwind observations for 94 AGN with detected massive winds at sub-pc to kpc\nspatial scales. We then fold AGN wind scaling relations with AGN luminosity\nfunctions, to evaluate the average AGN wind mass-loading factor as a function\nof cosmic time. We find strong correlations between the AGN molecular and\nionised wind mass outflow rates and the AGN bolometric luminosity. The power\nlaw scaling is steeper for ionised winds (slope 1.29+/-0.38) than for molecular\nwinds (0.76+/-0.06), meaning that the two rates converge at high bolometric\nluminosities. The molecular gas depletion timescale and the molecular gas\nfraction of galaxies hosting powerful AGN winds are 3-10 times shorter and\nsmaller than those of main-sequence galaxies with similar SFR, stellar mass and\nredshift. These findings suggest that, at high AGN bolometric luminosity, the\nreduced molecular gas fraction may be due to the destruction of molecules by\nthe wind, leading to a larger fraction of gas in the atomic ionised phase. The\nAGN wind mass-loading factor $\\eta=\\dot M_{OF}/SFR$ is systematically higher\nthan that of starburst driven winds. Our analysis shows that AGN winds are, on\naverage, powerful enough to clean galaxies from their molecular gas only in\nmassive systems at z<=2, i.e. a strong form of co-evolution between SMBHs and\ngalaxies appears to break down for the least massive galaxies.\n", "  Three flavoured neutrino oscillations are investigated in the light of the\nLeggett-Garg inequality. The outline of an experimental proposal is suggested\nwhereby the findings of this investigation may be verified. The results\nobtained are: (a) The maximum violation of the Leggett Garg Inequality (LGI) is\n$2.17036$ for neutrino path length $L_{1}=140.15 $ Km and $\\Delta L=1255.7 $\nKm.(b) Presence of the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ enhances the maximum\nviolation of LGI by $4.6\\%$.(c) The currently known mass hierarchy parameter\n$\\alpha = 0.0305$ increases the the maximum violation of LGI by $3.7\\%$.\n(d)Presence of CP violating phase parameter enhances the maximum violation of\nLGI by $0.24\\%$, thus providing an \\textit{alternative indicator of CP\nviolation} in 3-flavoured neutrino oscillations.\n", "  We construct a quintic quasi-topological gravity in five dimensions, i.e. a\ntheory with a Lagrangian containing $\\mathcal{R}^5$ terms and whose field\nequations are of second order on spherically (hyperbolic or planar) symmetric\nspacetimes. These theories have recently received attention since when\nformulated on asymptotically AdS spacetimes might provide for gravity duals of\na broad class of CFTs. For simplicity we focus on five dimensions. We show that\nthis theory fulfils a Birkhoff's Theorem as it is the case in Lovelock gravity\nand therefore, for generic values of the couplings, there is no s-wave\npropagating mode. We prove that the spherically symmetric solution is\ndetermined by a quintic algebraic polynomial equation which resembles Wheeler's\npolynomial of Lovelock gravity. For the black hole solutions we compute the\ntemperature, mass and entropy and show that the first law of black holes\nthermodynamics is fulfilled. Besides of being of fourth order in general, we\nshow that the field equations, when linearized around AdS are of second order,\nand therefore the theory does not propagate ghosts around this background.\nBesides the class of theories originally introduced in arXiv:1003.4773 [gr-qc],\nthe general geometric structure of these Lagrangians remains an open problem.\n", "  We show how angular momentum conservation can stabilise a symmetry-protected\nquasi-topological phase of matter supporting Majorana quasi-particles as edge\nmodes in one-dimensional cold atom gases. We investigate a number-conserving\nfour-species Hubbard model in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The latter\nreduces the global spin symmetry to an angular momentum parity symmetry, which\nprovides an extremely robust protection mechanism that does not rely on any\ncoupling to additional reservoirs. The emergence of Majorana edge modes is\nelucidated using field theory techniques, and corroborated by\ndensity-matrix-renormalization-group simulations. Our results pave the way\ntoward the observation of Majorana edge modes with alkaline-earth-like fermions\nin optical lattices, where all basic ingredients for our recipe - spin-orbit\ncoupling and strong inter-orbital interactions - have been experimentally\nrealized over the last two years.\n", "  We discuss the first theory for the depinning of low dimensional,\nincommensurate, charge density waves (CDWs) in the strong electron-phonon (e-p)\nregime. Arguing that most real CDWs systems invariably develop a gigantic\ndielectric constant (GDC) at very low frequencies, we propose an\nelectromechanical mechanism which is based on a local field effect. At zero\nelectric field and large enough e-p coupling the structures are naturally\npinned by the lattice due to its discreteness, and develop modulation functions\nwhich are characterized by discontinuities. When the electric field is turned\non, we show that it exists a finite threshold value for the electric field\nabove which the discontinuities of the modulation functions vanish due to CDW\ndeformation. The CDW is then free to move. The signature of this\npinning/depinning transition as a function of the increasing electric field can\nbe directly observed in the phonon spectrum by using inelastic neutrons or\nX-rays experiments.\n", "  We use molecular dynamic simulations to investigate the relation between the\npresence of packing defects in a glass-former and the spontaneous cooperative\nmotions called dynamic heterogeneity. For that purpose we use a simple diatomic\nglass-former and add a small number of larger or smaller diatomic probes. The\ndiluted probes modify locally the packing, inducing structural defects in the\nliquid, while we find that the number of defects is small enough not to disturb\nthe average structure. We find that a small packing modification around a few\nmolecules can deeply influence the dynamics of the whole liquid, when\nsupercooled. When we use small probe molecules, the dynamics accelerates and\nthe dynamic heterogeneity decreases. In contrast, for large probes the dynamics\nslows down and the dynamic heterogeneity increases. The induced heterogeneities\nand transport coefficient modification increase when the temperature decreases\nand disappear around the onset temperature of the cage dynamics.\n", "  Using the Weinberg operator, we present a full collection of genuine two-loop\nmodels for neutrino mass generation, which contain a dark matter particle as\none of the internal messengers. These models can be constructed simply by\nadding new fields that are singlets or doublets of SU(2)L. We ensure the\nstability of the dark matter candidate by the addition of a Z2 symmetry that\nwill also be used to forbid tree level or one-loop diagrams. Thus we only\npresent models where the main contribution for neutrinos masses is generated\nfrom the corresponding two-loop diagram. We also discuss a short outline\ncorresponding to some phenomenological characteristics of these models.\n", "  The Souriau massless Galilean particle of \"colour\" $k$ and spin $s$ is shown\nto be the Galilean limit of the Souriau tachyon of mass $m = ik$ and spin $s$.\nWe compare and contrast this result with the recent Galilean limit of the\nNambu-Goto string and the Green-Schwarz superstring.\n", "  Attosecond x-ray pulses offer unprecedented opportunities for probing and\ntriggering new types of ultrafast motion. At the same time, pulse\ncharacterization of x-rays presents new challenges that do not exist in the UV\nregime. Inner-shell ionization is the dominant ionization mechanism for x-rays\nand it is followed by secondary processes like fluorescence, Auger decay, and\nshake-up.In general, we find that inner-shell ionization and secondary\nprocesses can create additional delay-dependent modulations that will affect\npulse reconstruction schemes. Our recently proposed pulse characterization\nmethod [Pabst and Dahlstr\\\"om, PRA 94, 013411 (2016)], where a bound electron\nwavepacket is sequentially photoionized by the attosecond pulse, can be adapted\nto mitigate the impact of these effects, thus opening up an avenue for reliable\npulse reconstruction in the x-ray regime.\n", "  The adiabatic limit procedure associates with every solution of Abelian Higgs\nmodel in (2+1) dimensions a geodesic in the moduli space of static solutions.\nWe show that the same procedure for Seiberg--Witten equations on 4-dimensional\nsymplectic manifolds introduced by Taubes may be considered as a complex\n(2+2)-dimensional version of the (2+1)-dimensional picture. More precisely, the\nadiabatic limit procedure in the 4-dimensional case associates with a solution\nof Seiberg--Witten equations a pseudoholomorphic divisor which may be treated\nas a complex version of a geodesic in (2+1)-dimensional case.\n", "  We derive the Bloch equations for the spin dynamics of a two-dimensional\nelectron gas in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. For the latter we consider\nboth the intrinsic mechanisms of structure inversion asymmetry (Rashba) and\nbulk inversion asymmetry (Dresselhaus), and the extrinsic ones arising from the\nscattering from impurities. The derivation is based on the SU(2) gauge-field\nformulation of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. Our main result is\nthe identification of a new spin-generation torque arising from the\nElliot-Yafet process, which opposes a similar term arising from the\nDyakonov-Perel process. The new spin-generation torque contributes to the\ncurrent-induced spin polarization (CISP) -- also known as the Edelstein or\ninverse spin-galvanic effect. As a result, the behavior of the CISP turns out\nto be more complex than one would surmise from consideration of the internal\nRashba-Dresselhaus fields alone. In particular, the symmetry of the\ncurrent-induced spin polarization does not necessarily coincide with that of\nthe internal Rashba-Dresselhaus field, and an out-of-plane component of the\nCISP is generally predicted, as observed in recent experiments. We also discuss\nthe extension to the three-dimensional electron gas, which may be relevant for\nthe interpretation of experiments in thin films.\n", "  The discovery of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics twenty years ago has\nled to a broad variety of experimental techniques to explore phenomena in\nmagnetic materials with high temporal resolution. In the present article we\npresent a study dealing with broadband excitation of spin-wave packets at\ndifferent magnonic crystal continuous magnetic film interfaces. Similar to\nprotected conducting states on the surfaces of topological band insulators,\nthese interfaces exhibit surface spin-wave modes that propagate out of the\ncrystal into the continuous film. The propagation distance depends on the\ndirection of the applied magnetic field as well as the surface geometry of the\ncrystal.\n", "  From the LHC runs we know that, with increasing collider energy,\nweak-boson-fusion Higgs production dominates as an environment for precision\nmeasurements. We show how a future hadron collider performs for three\nchallenging benchmark signatures. Because all of these measurements rely on the\ntagging jet signature, we first give a comprehensive analysis of\nweak-boson-fusion kinematics and a proposed two-step jet veto at a 100 TeV\nhadron collider. We then find this machine to be sensitive to invisible Higgs\nbranching ratios of 0.5%, a second-generation muon Yukawa coupling of 2%, and\nan enhanced total Higgs width of around 5%, the latter with essentially no\nmodel dependence. This kind of performance crucially relies on a sufficient\ndetector coverage and a dedicated weak-boson-fusion trigger channel.\n", "  Context. The SAO 206462 (HD 135344B) disk is one of the few known\ntransitional disks showing asymmetric features in scattered light and thermal\nemission. Near-infrared scattered-light images revealed two bright outer spiral\narms and an inner cavity depleted in dust. Giant protoplanets have been\nproposed to account for the disk morphology. Aims. We aim to search for giant\nplanets responsible for the disk features and, in the case of non-detection, to\nconstrain recent planet predictions using the data detection limits. Methods.\nWe obtained new high-contrast and high-resolution total intensity images of the\ntarget spanning the Y to the K bands (0.95-2.3 mic) using the VLT/SPHERE\nnear-infrared camera and integral field spectrometer. Results. The spiral arms\nand the outer cavity edge are revealed at high resolutions and sensitivities\nwithout the need for image post-processing techniques, which introduce\nphotometric biases. We do not detect any close-in companions. For the\nderivation of the detection limits on putative giant planets embedded in the\ndisk, we show that the knowledge of the disk aspect ratio and viscosity is\ncritical for the estimation of the attenuation of a planet signal by the\nprotoplanetary dust because of the gaps that these putative planets may open.\nGiven assumptions on these parameters, the mass limits can vary from ~2-5 to\n~4-7 Jupiter masses at separations beyond the disk spiral arms. The SPHERE\ndetection limits are more stringent than those derived from archival NaCo/L'\ndata and provide new constraints on a few recent predictions of massive planets\n(4-15 MJ) based on the spiral density wave theory. The SPHERE and ALMA data do\nnot favor the hypotheses on massive giant planets in the outer disk (beyond\n0.6). There could still be low-mass planets in the outer disk and/or planets\ninside the cavity.\n", "  Time delay signature (TDS) of a semiconductor laser subject to dispersive\noptical feedback from a chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG) is investigated\nexperimentally and numerically. Different from mirror, CFBG provides additional\nfrequency-dependent delay caused by dispersion, and thus induces\nexternal-cavity modes with irregular mode separation rather than a fixed\nseparation induced by mirror feedback. Compared with mirror feedback, the CFBG\nfeedback can greatly depress and even eliminate the TDS, although it leads to a\nsimilar quasi-period route to chaos with increases of feedback. In experiments,\nby using a CFBG with dispersion of 2000ps/nm, the TDS is decreased by 90% to\nabout 0.04 compared with mirror feedback. Furthermore, both numerical and\nexperimental results show that the TDS evolution is quite different: the TDS\ndecreases more quickly down to a lower plateau (even background noise level of\nautocorrelation function) and never rises again. This evolution tendency is\nalso different from that of FBG feedback, of which the TDS first decreases to a\nminimal value and then increases again as feedback strength increases. In\naddition, the CFBG feedback has no filtering effects and does not require\namplification for feedback light.\n", "  Determination of cluster masses is a fundamental tool for cosmology.\nComparing mass estimates obtained by different probes allows to understand\npossible systematic uncertainties. The cluster Abell 315 is an interesting test\ncase, since it has been claimed to be underluminous in X-ray for its mass\n(determined via kinematics and weak lensing). We have undertaken new\nspectroscopic observations with the aim of improving the cluster mass estimate,\nusing the distribution of galaxies in projected phase space. We identified\ncluster members in our new spectroscopic sample. We estimated the cluster mass\nfrom the projected phase-space distribution of cluster members using the\nMAMPOSSt method. In doing this estimate we took into account the presence of\nsubstructures that we were able to identify. We identify several cluster\nsubstructures. The main two have an overlapping spatial distribution,\nsuggesting a (past or ongoing) collision along the line-of-sight. After\naccounting for the presence of substructures, the mass estimate of Abell 315\nfrom kinematics is reduced by a factor 4, down to M200=0.8 (-0.4,+0.6) x 10^14\nMsun. We also find evidence that the cluster mass concentration is unusually\nlow, c200=r200/r-2 <~ 1. Using our new estimate of c200 we revise the weak\nlensing mass estimate down to M200=1.8 (-0.9,+1.7) x 10^14 Msun. Our new mass\nestimates are in agreement with that derived from the cluster X-ray luminosity\nvia a scaling relation, M200=0.9+-0.2 x 10^14 Msun. Abell 315 no longer belongs\nto the class of X-ray underluminous clusters. Its mass estimate was inflated by\nthe presence of an undetected subcluster in collision with the main cluster.\nWhether the presence of undetected line-of-sight structures can be a general\nexplanation for all X-ray underluminous clusters remains to be explored using a\nstatistically significant sample.\n", "  We present a systematic study of neutron-proton scattering in Nuclear Lattice\nEffective Field Theory (NLEFT), in terms of the computationally efficient\nradial Hamiltonian method. Our leading-order (LO) interaction consists of\nsmeared, local contact terms and static one-pion exchange. We show results for\na fully non-perturbative analysis up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO),\nfollowed by a perturbative treatment of contributions beyond LO. The latter\nanalysis anticipates practical Monte Carlo simulations of heavier nuclei. We\nexplore how our results depend on the lattice spacing a, and estimate sources\nof uncertainty in the determination of the low-energy constants of the\nnext-to-leading-order (NLO) two-nucleon force. We give results for lattice\nspacings ranging from a = 1.97 fm down to a = 0.98 fm, and discuss the effects\nof lattice artifacts on the scattering observables. At a = 0.98 fm, lattice\nartifacts appear small, and our NNLO results agree well with the Nijmegen\npartial-wave analysis for S-wave and P-wave channels. We expect the peripheral\npartial waves to be equally well described once the lattice momenta in the\npion-nucleon coupling are taken to coincide with the continuum dispersion\nrelation, and higher-order (N3LO) contributions are included. We stress that\nfor center-of-mass momenta below 100 MeV, the physics of the two-nucleon system\nis independent of the lattice spacing.\n", "  Tensor-polarized structure functions of a spin-1 hadron are additional\nobservables which do not exist for the spin-1/2 nucleon. They could probe novel\naspects of the internal hadron structure. Twist-2 tensor-polarized structure\nfunctions are $b_1$ and $b_2$, and they are related by the Callan-Gross-like\nrelation in the Bjorken scaling limit. In this work, we theoretically calculate\n$b_1$ in the standard convolution description for the deuteron. Two different\ntheoretical models, a basic convolution description and a virtual nucleon\napproximation, are used for calculating $b_1$ and their results are compared\nwith the HERMES measurement. We found large differences between our theoretical\nresults and the data. Although there is still room to improve by considering\nhigher-twist effects and in the experimental extraction of $b_1$ from the spin\nasymmetry $A_{zz}$, there is a possibility that the large differences require\nphysics beyond the standard deuteron model for their interpretation. Future\n$b_1$ studies could shed light on a new field of hadron physics. In particular,\ndetailed experimental studies of $b_1$ will start soon at the Thomas Jefferson\nNational Accelerator Facility. In addition, there are possibilities to\ninvestigate tensor-polarized parton distribution functions and $b_1$ at Fermi\nNational Accelerator Laboratory and a future electron-ion collider. Therefore,\nfurther theoretical studies are needed for understanding the tensor structure\nof the spin-1 deuteron, including a new mechanism to explain the large\ndifferences between the current data and our theoretical results.\n", "  We review our recent results on dark matter from Starobinsky supergravity. In\nthis context, a natural candidate for Cold Dark Matter is the gravitino. On the\nother hand, assuming the supersymmetry broken at scales much higher than the\nelectroweak scale, gravitinos are super heavy particles. In this case, they may\nbe non-thermally produced during inflation, in turn originated by the scalaron\nfield with Starobinsky's potential.Assuming gravitinos as Lightest\nsupersymmetric particles (LSSP), the non-thermal production naturally accounts\nfor the right amount of cold dark matter. Metastability of the gravitino LSSP\nleads to observable effects of their decay, putting constraints on the\ncorresponding Unstable or Decaying Dark Matters scenarios. In this model, the\ngravitino mass is controlled by the inflaton field and it runs with it. This\nimplies that a continuous spectrum of superheavy gravitinos is produced during\nthe slow-roll epoch. Implications in phenomenology, model building in GUT\nscenarios, intersecting D-branes models and instantons in string theories are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The $\\alpha'$-deformed frame-like Double Field Theory (DFT) is a T-duality\nand gauge invariant extension of DFT in which generalized Green-Schwarz\ntransformations provide a gauge principle that fixes the higher-derivative\ncorrections. It includes all the first order $\\alpha'$-corrections of the\nbosonic and heterotic string low energy effective actions and of the\nHohm-Siegel-Zwiebach $\\alpha'$-geometry. Here we gauge this theory and\nparameterize it in terms of a frame, a two-form, a dilaton, gauge vectors and\nscalar fields. This leads to a unified framework that extends the previous\nconstruction by including all duality constrained interactions in generic\n(gauged/super)gravity effective field theories in arbitrary number of\ndimensions, to first order in $\\alpha'$.\n", "  A new modified Vlasov equation has been obtained in this paper for the\nsystems with dissipative phenomena such as, for example, plasma with\nirradiation.\n", "  We revisit the possibility of distinguishing between Dirac and Majorana\nneutrinos via neutrino-electron elastic scattering in the presence of all\npossible Lorentz-invariant interactions. Defining proper observables, certain\nregions of the parameter space can only be reached for Dirac neutrinos, but\nnever for Majorana neutrinos, thus providing an alternative method to\ndifferentiate these two possibilities. We first derive analytically and\nnumerically the most general conditions that would allow to distinguish Dirac\nfrom Majorana neutrinos, both in the relativistic and non-relativistic cases.\nThen, we apply these conditions to data on $\\nu_\\mu$-$e$ and $\\bar{\\nu}_e$-$e$\nscatterings, from the CHARM-II and TEXONO experiments, and find that they are\nconsistent with both types of neutrinos. Finally, we comment on future\nprospects of this kind of tests.\n", "  The production mechanisms of open strangeness ($K^*$) and open charm ($D^*$)\nvector mesons in $\\pi^- p$ scattering, namely, $\\pi^- +p \\to K^{*0} + \\Lambda$\nand $\\pi^- + p \\to D^{*-} + \\Lambda_c^+$, are investigated within the modified\nquark-gluon string model. In order to identify the major reaction mechanisms,\nwe consider the subsequent decays of the produced vector mesons into two\npseudoscalar mesons, i.e., $K^* \\to K + \\pi$ and $D^* \\to D + \\pi$. We found\nthat the decay distributions and density matrix elements are sensitive to the\nproduction mechanisms and can be used to disentangle the vector trajectory and\npseudoscalar trajectory exchange models. Our results for $K^*$ production are\ncompared with the currently available experimental data and the predictions for\n$D^*$ production processes are presented as well. Our predictions can be tested\nat the present or planned experimental facilities.\n", "  We report the complex dielectric function of the quasi-one-dimensional\nchalcogenide Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, which exhibits a structural phase transition that\nhas been attributed to exciton condensation below $T_c = 326$ K, and of the\nisostructural Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ which does not exhibit such a transition. Using\nspectroscopic ellipsometry, we have detected exciton doublets with pronounced\nFano lineshapes in both the compounds. The exciton Fano resonances in\nTa$_2$NiSe$_5$ display an order of magnitude higher intensity than those in\nTa$_2$NiS$_5$. In conjunction with prior theoretical work by E. Rashba, we\nattribute this observation to the giant oscillator strength of spatially\nextended exciton-phonon bound states in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$. The formation of\nexciton-phonon complexes in Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ and Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is confirmed by\nthe pronounced temperature dependence of sharp interband transitions in the\noptical spectra, whose peak energies and widths scale with the thermal\npopulation of optical phonon modes. The description of the optically excited\nstates in terms of strongly overlapping exciton complexes is in good agreement\nwith the hypothesis of an EI ground state.\n", "  The guiding influence of some of Stanley Mandelstam's key contributions to\nthe development of theoretical high energy physics is discussed, from the\nmotivation for the study of the analytic properties of the scattering matrix\nthrough to dual resonance models and their evolution into string theory.\n", "  Solar \"magnetic tornadoes\" are produced by rotating magnetic field structures\nthat extend from the upper convection zone and the photosphere to the corona of\nthe Sun. Recent studies show that such rotating features are an integral part\nof atmospheric dynamics and occur on a large range of spatial scales. A\nsystematic statistical study of magnetic tornadoes is a necessary next step\ntowards understanding their formation and their role for the mass and energy\ntransport in the solar atmosphere. For this purpose, we have developed a new\nautomatic detection method for chromospheric swirls, i.e. the observable\nsignature of solar tornadoes or, more generally, chromospheric vortex flows and\nrotating motions. Unlike the previous studies that relied on visual\ninspections, our new method combines a line integral convolution (LIC) imaging\ntechnique and a scalar quantity which represents a vortex flow on a\ntwo-dimensional plane. We have tested two detection algorithms, based on the\nenhanced vorticity and vorticity strength quantities, by applying them to 3D\nnumerical simulations of the solar atmosphere with CO5BOLD. We conclude that\nthe vorticity strength method is superior compared to the enhanced vorticity\nmethod in all aspects. Applying the method to a numerical simulation of the\nsolar atmosphere revealed very abundant small-scale, short-lived chromospheric\nvortex flows that had not been found by visual inspection before.\n", "  We analyze, within several parameter scenarios of type-II two-Higgs doublet\nextensions of the standard model, the impact of heavy neutral Higgs-boson\nresonances on top-quark pair production and their subsequent decay to\ndileptonic final states at the LHC (13 TeV). In particular, we investigate the\neffects of heavy Higgs bosons on top-spin observables, that is, the\nlongitudinal top-quark polarization and top-quark spin correlations. We take\ninto account NLO QCD as well as weak interaction corrections and show that\ntop-spin observables, if evaluated in judiciously chosen top-quark pair\ninvariant mass bins, can significantly enhance the sensitivity to heavy Higgs\nresonances in top-quark pair events.\n", "  We report a methodology for measuring 85Kr/Kr isotopic abundances using Atom\nTrap Trace Analysis (ATTA) that increases sample measurement throughput by over\nan order of magnitude to 6 samples per 24 hours. The noble gas isotope 85Kr\n(half-life = 10.7 yr) is a useful tracer for young groundwater in the age range\nof 5-50 years. ATTA, an efficient and selective laser-based atom counting\nmethod, has recently been applied to 85Kr/Kr isotopic abundance measurements,\nrequiring 5-10 microliters of krypton gas at STP extracted from 50-100 L of\nwater. Previously a single such measurement required 48 hours. Our new method\ndemonstrates that we can measure 85Kr/Kr ratios with 3-5% relative uncertainty\nevery 4 hours, on average, with the same sample requirements.\n", "  Since the beginning of the new millennium, more than 100 $z\\sim 6$ quasars\nhave been discovered through several surveys and followed-up with\nmulti-wavelength observations. These data provided a large amount of\ninformation on the growth of supermassive black holes at the early epochs, the\nproperties of quasar host galaxies and the joint formation and evolution of\nthese massive systems. We review the properties of the highest-$z$ quasars\nknown so far, especially focusing on some of the most recent results obtained\nin (sub-)millimeter bands. We discuss key observational challenges and open\nissues in theoretical models and highlight possible new strategies to improve\nour understanding of the galaxy-black hole formation and evolution in the early\nUniverse.\n", "  The excitation of THz radiation by the interaction of an ultra short laser\npulse with the modes of a miniature corrugated plasma waveguide is considered.\nThe axially corrugated waveguide supports the electromagnetic (EM) modes with\nappropriate polarization and subluminal phase velocities that can be phase\nmatched to the ponderomotive potential associated with laser pulse, making\nsignificant THz generation possible. This process is studied via full format\nParticle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations that, for the first time, model the\nnonlinear dynamics of the plasma and the self-consistent evolution of the laser\npulse in the case where the laser pulse energy is entirely depleted. It is\nfound that the generated THz is characterized by lateral emission from the\nchannel, with a spectrum that may be narrow or broad depending on the laser\nintensity. A range of realistic laser pulse and plasma parameters is considered\nwith the goal of maximizing the conversion efficiency of optical energy to THz\nradiation. As an example, a fixed drive pulse (0.55 J) with a spot size of 15\n$\\mu m$ and duration of 15 $fs$ produces 37.8 mJ of THz radiation in a 1.5 cm\ncorrugated plasma waveguide with an on axis average density of\n$1.4\\times10^{18} cm^{-3}$.\n", "  Using the experimental data from the ALICE program on the centrality\ndependence of the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra in Pb+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV, we show that the double-Tsallis distribution and the\ngeneralized Fokker-Plank (FP) solution can not describe the spectra of pions,\nkaons and protons from central to peripheral collisions in the entire $p_T$\nregion, simultaneously. Hence, a new two-component distribution, which is a\nhydrodynamic extension of the generalized FP solution accounting for the\ncollective motion effect in heavy-ion collisions, is proposed in order to\nreproduce all the particle spectra. Our results suggest that the particle\nproduction dynamics may be different for different particles, especially at\nvery low $p_T$ region.\n", "  We report silicon delta doping in Gallium Oxide (\\b{eta}-Ga2O3) grown by\nplasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy using a shutter pulsing technique. We\ndescribe growth procedures that can be used to realize high Si incorporation in\nan oxidizing oxygen plasma environment. Delta doping was used to realize thin\n(12 nm) low-resistance layers with sheet resistance of 320 Ohm/square (mobility\nof 83 cm^2/Vs, integrated sheet charge of 2.4x10^14 cm^-2). A single\ndelta-doped sheet of carriers was employed as a channel to realize a field\neffect transistor with current ID,MAX =292 mA/mm and transconductance gM = 27\nmS/mm.\n", "  The ALICE detector has excellent Particle IDentification (PID) capabilities\nin the central barrel ($\\lvert \\eta \\rvert <$ 0.9). This allows identified\nhadron production to be measured over a wide transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm{T}}$)\nrange, using different sub-detectors and techniques: their specific energy loss\n(d$E$/d$x$), the velocity determination via time-of-flight measurement, the\nCherenkov angle or their characteristic weak decay topology. Results on\nidentified light flavour hadron production at mid-rapidity measured by ALICE in\nproton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are presented and compared with\nprevious measurements performed at lower energies. The results cover a wide\nrange of particle species including long-lived hadrons, resonances and\nmulti-strange baryons over the $p_{\\rm{T}}$ range from 150 MeV/$c$ up to 20\nGeV/$c$, depending on the particle species.\n", "  We propose a method based on the slice energy spread modulation to generate\nstrong subpicoseond density bunching in high-intensity relativistic electron\nbeams. A laser pulse with periodic intensity envelope is used to modulate the\nslice energy spread of the electron beam, which can then be converted into\ndensity modulation after a dispersive section. It is found that the double-horn\nslice energy distribution of the electron beam induced by the laser modulation\nis very effective to increase the density bunching. Since the modulation is\nperformed on a relativistic electron beam, the process does not suffer from\nstrong space charge force or coupling between phase spaces, so that it is\nstraightforward to preserve the beam quality for further applications, such as\nterahertz (THz) radiation and resonant excitation of plasma wakefield. We show\nin both theory and simulations that the tunable radiation from the beam can\ncover the frequency range of 1-10 THz with high power and narrow-band spectra.\n", "  Relativistic jets of plasma are a key ingredient of many types of Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN). Today we know that AGNs are powered by the accretion of\ninter stellar material into the gravitational field of a Super Massive Black\nHole and that this process can release as much power as a whole galaxy, like\nthe Milky Way, from a region that is comparable to the Solar System in size.\nDepending on the properties of the central energy source, a large fraction of\nthis power can be involved in the acceleration of magnetized plasmas at\nrelativistic speeds, to form large scale jets. The presence of jets affects the\nspectrum of AGNs through the emission of synchrotron radiation and Inverse\nCompton scattering of low energy photons, thus leading to a prominent\nnon-thermal spectrum, some times extending from radio frequencies all the way\nup to $\\gamma$-ray energies. Here we review some characteristic processes of\nradiation emission in AGN jets, which lead to the emission of photons in the\nradio, optical, X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray bands, and we present the results of a\nspectroscopic campaign of optical counterparts. We discuss our observations and\ntheir connection with $\\gamma$-ray properties in a scenario that traces the\nrole of relativistic jets in different classes of AGNs, detected both in the\nlocal as well as in the remote Universe.\n", "  We analyze in detail the global symmetries of various (2+1)d quantum field\ntheories and couple them to classical background gauge fields. A proper\nidentification of the global symmetries allows us to consider all non-trivial\nbundles of those background fields, thus finding more subtle observables. The\nglobal symmetries exhibit interesting 't Hooft anomalies. These allow us to\nconstrain the IR behavior of the theories and provide powerful constraints on\nconjectured dualities.\n", "  Several families of one-point interactions are derived from the system\nconsisting of two and three $\\delta$-potentials which are regularized by\npiecewise constant functions. In physical terms such an approximating system\nrepresents two or three extremely thin layers separated by some distance. The\ntwo-scale squeezing of this heterostructure to one point as both the width of\n$\\delta$-approximating functions and the distance between these functions\nsimultaneously tend to zero is studied using the power parameterization through\na squeezing parameter $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, so that the intensity of each\n$\\delta$-potential is $c_j =a_j \\varepsilon^{1-\\mu}$, $a_j \\in {\\mathbb{R}}$,\n$j=1,2,3$, the width of each layer $l =\\varepsilon$ and the distance between\nthe layers $r = c\\varepsilon^\\tau$, $c >0$. It is shown that at some values of\nintensities $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$, the transmission across the limit point\ninteractions is non-zero, whereas outside these (resonance) values the\none-point interactions are opaque splitting the system at the point of\nsingularity into two independent subsystems. Within the interval $1 < \\mu < 2$,\nthe resonance sets consist of two curves on the $(a_1,a_2)$-plane and three\ndisconnected surfaces in the $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$-space. While approaching the\nparameter $\\mu $ to the critical value $\\mu =2$, three types of splitting these\nsets into countable families of resonance curves and surfaces are observed.\n", "  It is well known that interpreting the cosmological constant as the pressure,\nthe AdS black holes behave as the van der Waals thermodynamic system. In this\ncase, like a phase transition from vapor to liquid in a usual van der Waals\nsystem, black holes also changes phases about a critical point in the $P$-$V$\npicture, where $P$ is the pressure and $V$ is the thermodynamic volume. Here,\nwe give a geometrical description of this phase transition. Defining the\nrelevant Legendre invariant thermogeometrics corresponding to the two\ncriticality conditions, which determine the critical values of respective\nthermodynamical entities, we show that the critical point refers to the\ndivergence of the Ricci scalars calculated from these metrics. The similar\ndescriptions are also provided for the other two pictures of the van der Waals\nlike phase transition: one is $T$-$S$ and the other one is $Y$-$X$ where $T$,\n$S$, $X$ and $Y$ are temperature, entropy, generalized force and generalized\ndisplacement; i.e. potential corresponding to external charge, respectively.\nThe whole discussion is very general as no specific black hole metric is being\nused.\n", "  For a $(3+1)$-dimensional generalization of the Schwinger model, we compute\nthe interaction energy between two test charges. The result shows that the\nstatic potential profile contains a linear term leading to the confinement of\nprobe charges, exactly as in the original model in two dimensions. We further\nshow that the same 4-dimensional model also appears as one version of the $ B\n\\wedge F$ models in $(3+1)$ dimensions under dualization of Stueckelberg-like\nmassive gauge theories. Interestingly, this particular model is characterized\nby the mixing between a $U(1)$ potential and an Abelian $3$-form field of the\ntype that appears in the topological sector of QCD.\n", "  Stop searches in supersymmetric frameworks with $R$-parity conservation\nusually assume the lightest neutralino to be the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle. In this paper we consider an alternative scenario in which the\nleft-handed tau sneutrino is lighter than neutralinos and stable at collider\nscales, but possibly unstable at cosmological scales. Moreover the (mostly\nright-handed) stop $\\widetilde t$ is lighter than all electroweakinos, and\nheavier than the scalars of the third generation doublet, whose charged\ncomponent, $\\widetilde\\tau$, is heavier than the neutral one, $\\widetilde\\nu$.\nThe remaining supersymmetric particles are decoupled from the stop\nphenomenology. In most of the parameter space, the relevant stop decays are\nonly into $t \\widetilde\\tau \\tau$, $t\\widetilde\\nu\\nu$ and $b \\widetilde\\nu\n\\tau$ via off-shell electroweakinos. We constrain the branching ratios of these\ndecays by recasting the most sensitive stop searches. Due to the \"double\ninvisible\" kinematics of the $\\widetilde t\\to t\\widetilde\\nu\\nu$ process, and\nthe low efficiency in tagging the $t\\widetilde\\tau\\tau$ decay products, light\nstops are generically allowed. In the minimal supersymmetric standard model\nwith $\\sim$ 100 GeV sneutrinos, stops with masses as small as $\\sim$ 350 GeV\nturn out to be allowed at 95% CL.\n", "  Very recently, the authors of [PRL {\\bf 118} (2017) 021102] have shown that\nviolation of energy-momentum tensor (EMT) could result in an accelerated\nexpansion state via appearing an effective cosmological constant, in the\ncontext of unimodular gravity. Inspired by this outcome, in this paper we\ninvestigate cosmological consequences of violation of the EMT conservation in a\nparticular class of $f(R,T)$ gravity when only the pressure-less fluid is\npresent. In this respect, we focus on the late time solutions of models of the\ntype $f(R,T)=R+\\beta \\Lambda(-T)$. As the first task, we study the solutions\nwhen the conservation of EMT is respected and then we proceed with those in\nwhich violation occurs. We have found, provided that the EMT conservation is\nviolated, there generally exist two accelerated expansion solutions which their\nstability properties depend on the underlying model. More exactly, we obtain a\ndark energy solution for which the effective equation of state (EoS) depend on\nmodel parameters and a de Sitter solution. We present a method to parametrize\n$\\Lambda(-T)$ function which is useful in dynamical system approach and has\nbeen employed in the herein model. Also, we discuss the cosmological solutions\nfor models with $\\Lambda(-T)=8\\pi G(-T)^{\\alpha}$ in the presence of the ultra\nrelativistic matter.\n", "  We investigated an out-of-plane exchange bias system that is based on the\nantiferromagnet MnN. Polycrystalline, highly textured film stacks of Ta / MnN /\nCoFeB / MgO / Ta were grown on SiO$_x$ by (reactive) magnetron sputtering and\nstudied by x-ray diffraction and Kerr magnetometry. Nontrivial modifications of\nthe exchange bias and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy were observed both\nas functions of film thicknesses as well as field cooling temperatures. In\noptimized film stacks, a giant perpendicular exchange bias of 3600 Oe and a\ncoercive field of 350 Oe were observed at room temperature. The effective\ninterfacial exchange energy is estimated to be $J_\\mathrm{eff} = 0.24$ mJ/m$^2$\nand the effective uniaxial anisotropy constant of the antiferromagnet is\n$K_\\mathrm{eff} = 24$ kJ/m$^3$. The maximum effective perpendicular anisotropy\nfield of the CoFeB layer is $H_\\mathrm{ani} = 3400$ Oe. These values are larger\nthan any previously reported values. These results possibly open a route to\nmagnetically stable, exchange biased perpendicularly magnetized spin valves.\n", "  Thermal production of light dark matter with sub-GeV scale mass can be\nattributed to $3\\rightarrow 2$ self-annihilation processes. We consider the\nthermal average for annihilation cross sections of dark matter at $3\\rightarrow\n2$ and general higher-order interactions. A correct thermal average for initial\ndark matter particles is important, in particular, for annihilation cross\nsections with overall velocity dependence and/or resonance poles. We apply our\ngeneral results to benchmark models for SIMP dark matter and discuss the\neffects of the resonance pole in determining the relic density.\n", "  We compute L\\\"uscher corrections to the effective string tension in the\nPilch-Warner background, holographically dual to $\\mathcal{N}=2^*$\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The same quantity can be calculated directly\nfrom field theory by solving the localization matrix model at large-$N$. We\nfind complete agreement between the field-theory predictions and explicit\nstring-theory calculation at strong coupling.\n", "  The high granularity of the CALICE Semi-Digital Hadronic CALorimeter (SDHCAL)\nprovides the capability to reveal the track segments present in hadronic\nshowers. These segments are then used as a tool to probe the behaviour of the\nactive layers in situ, to better reconstruct the energy of these hadronic\nshowers and also to distinguish them from electromagnetic ones. In addition,\nthe comparison of these track segments in data and the simulation helps to\ndiscriminate among the different shower models used in the simulation. To\nextract the track segments in the showers recorded in the SDHCAL, a Hough\nTransform is used after being adapted to the presence of the dense core of the\nhadronic showers and the SDHCAL active medium structure.\n", "  We propose a model of tunable THz metamaterials. The main advantage is the\nblueshift of resonance and phase tunability due to toroidal excitation in\nplanar metallic metamolecules with incorporated silicon inductive inclusions.\n", "  In order to avoid unphysical causality-violating effects any rigidly rotating\nsystem must be bounded in directions transverse to the axis of rotation. We\ndemonstrate that this requirement implies substantial dependence of properties\nof relativistically rotating system on the boundary conditions. We consider a\nsystem of interacting fermions described by the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a\nspace bounded by cylindrical surface of finite radius. In order to confine the\nfermions inside the cylinder we impose \"chiral\" MIT boundary conditions on its\nsurface. These boundary conditions are parameterized by a continuous chiral\nangle \\Theta. We find that at any value of \\Theta the chiral restoration\ntemperature T_c decreases as a quadratic function of the angular frequency\n\\Omega. However, the position and the slope of the critical curve T_c =\nT_c(\\Omega) in the phase diagram depends noticeably on the value of the chiral\nangle.\n", "  We show how the $S$-matrix of an extended theory of gravity defined by its\nthree-point amplitudes can be constructed by demanding factorisation. The\nresultant $S$-matrix has tree amplitudes obeying the same soft singularity\ntheorems as Einstein gravity including the sub-sub-leading terms.\n", "  Polarized extinction and emission from dust in the interstellar medium (ISM)\nare hard to interpret, as they have a complex dependence on dust optical\nproperties, grain alignment and magnetic field orientation. This is\nparticularly true in molecular clouds. The data available today are not yet\nused to their full potential.\n  The combination of emission and extinction, in particular, provides\ninformation not available from either of them alone. We combine data from the\nscientific literature on polarized dust extinction with Planck data on\npolarized emission and we use them to constrain the possible variations in dust\nand environmental conditions inside molecular clouds, and especially\ntranslucent lines of sight, taking into account magnetic field orientation.\n  We focus on the dependence between \\lambda_max -- the wavelength of maximum\npolarization in extinction -- and other observables such as the extinction\npolarization, the emission polarization and the ratio of the two. We set out to\nreproduce these correlations using Monte-Carlo simulations where the relevant\nquantities in a dust model -- grain alignment, size distribution and magnetic\nfield orientation -- vary to mimic the diverse conditions expected inside\nmolecular clouds.\n  None of the quantities chosen can explain the observational data on its own:\nthe best results are obtained when all quantities vary significantly across and\nwithin clouds. However, some of the data -- most notably the stars with low\nemission-to-extinction polarization ratio -- are not reproduced by our\nsimulation. Our results suggest not only that dust evolution is necessary to\nexplain polarization in molecular clouds, but that a simple change in size\ndistribution is not sufficient to explain the data, and point the way for\nfuture and more sophisticated models.\n", "  We study magnetization reversal in a $\\varphi_0$ Josephson junction with\ndirect coupling between magnetic moment and Josephson current. Our simulations\nof magnetic moment dynamics show that by applying an electric current pulse, we\ncan realize the full magnetization reversal. We propose different protocols of\nfull magnetization reversal based on the variation of the Josephson junction\nand pulse parameters, particularly, electric current pulse amplitude, damping\nof magnetization and spin-orbit interaction. We discuss experiments which can\nprobe the magnetization reversal in $\\varphi_0$-junctions.\n", "  Motivated by the need to understand current-induced magnetization dynamics at\nthe nanoscale, we have developed a formalism, within the framework of Keldysh\nGreen function approach, to study the current-induced dynamics of a\nferromagnetic (FM) nanoisland overlayer on a spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) Rashba\nplane. In contrast to the commonly employed classical micromagnetic LLG\nsimulations the magnetic moments of the FM are treated {\\it quantum\nmechanically}. We obtain the density matrix of the whole system consisting of\nconduction electrons entangled with the local magnetic moments and calculate\nthe effective damping rate of the FM. We investigate two opposite limiting\nregimes of FM dynamics: (1) The precessional regime where the magnetic\nanisotropy energy (MAE) and precessional frequency are smaller than the\nexchange interactions, and (2) The local spin-flip regime where the MAE and\nprecessional frequency are comparable to the exchange interactions. In the\nformer case, we show that due to the finite size of the FM domain, the\n\\textquotedblleft Gilbert damping\\textquotedblright does not diverge in the\nballistic electron transport regime, in sharp contrast to Kambersky's breathing\nFermi surface theory for damping in metallic FMs. In the latter case, we show\nthat above a critical bias the excited conduction electrons can switch the\nlocal spin moments resulting in demagnetization and reversal of the\nmagnetization. Furthermore, our calculations show that the bias-induced\nantidamping efficiency in the local spin-flip regime is much higher than that\nin the rotational excitation regime.\n", "  Dust extinction is the most robust tracer of the gas distribution in the\ninterstellar medium, but measuring extinction is limited by the systematic\nuncertainties involved in estimating the intrinsic colors to background stars.\nIn this paper we present a new technique, PNICER, that estimates intrinsic\ncolors and extinction for individual stars using unsupervised machine learning\nalgorithms. This new method aims to be free from any priors with respect to the\ncolumn density and intrinsic color distribution. It is applicable to any\ncombination of parameters and works in arbitrary numbers of dimensions.\nFurthermore, it is not restricted to color space. Extinction towards single\nsources is determined by fitting Gaussian Mixture Models along the extinction\nvector to (extinction-free) control field observations. In this way it becomes\npossible to describe the extinction for observed sources with probability\ndensities. PNICER effectively eliminates known biases found in similar methods\nand outperforms them in cases of deep observational data where the number of\nbackground galaxies is significant, or when a large number of parameters is\nused to break degeneracies in the intrinsic color distributions. This new\nmethod remains computationally competitive, making it possible to correctly\nde-redden millions of sources within a matter of seconds. With the\never-increasing number of large-scale high-sensitivity imaging surveys, PNICER\noffers a fast and reliable way to efficiently calculate extinction for\narbitrary parameter combinations without prior information on source\ncharacteristics. PNICER also offers access to the well-established NICER\ntechnique in a simple unified interface and is capable of building extinction\nmaps including the NICEST correction for cloud substructure. PNICER is offered\nto the community as an open-source software solution and is entirely written in\nPython.\n", "  Building upon work by Matsumoto, we show that the quantum relative entropy\nwith full-rank second argument is determined by four simple axioms: i)\nContinuity in the first argument, ii) the validity of the data-processing\ninequality, iii) additivity under tensor products, and iv) super-additivity.\nThis observation has immediate implications for quantum thermodynamics, which\nwe discuss. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under reasonable restrictions,\nthe free energy is singled out as a measure of athermality. In particular, we\nconsider an extended class of Gibbs-preserving maps as free operations in a\nresource-theoretic framework, in which a catalyst is allowed to build up\ncorrelations with the system at hand. The free energy is the only extensive and\ncontinuous function that is monotonic under such free operations.\n", "  Kinetics of singlet fission in organic semiconductors, in which the excited\nsinglet state (S_1) spontaneously splits into a pair of triplet (T) excitons,\nis known to be strongly influenced by back geminate annihilation of TT-pairs.\nWe show that this influence can be properly described only by taking into\naccount the diffusive exciton migration. The migration effect is treated in the\nmodel of two kinetically coupled states: the intermediate state of interacting\nTT-pairs and the state of migrating excitons. Within this model the singlet\nfission (including magnetic field effects) is studied as applied to the\nfluorescence decay kinetics (FDK) I_{S_1}(t) for S_1-state. The analysis shows\nthat migration strongly affects the FDK resulting, in particular, in the\nuniversal long-time dependence I_{S_1}(t) \\sim t^{-3/2}. The model accurately\ndescribes the FDK, recently observed for a number of systems. Possible\napplications of the considered model to the analysis of mechanisms of\nmigration, using experimentally measured FDK, are briefly discussed.\n", "  A new model of thermal inflation is introduced, in which the mass of the\nthermal waterfall field is dependent on a light spectator scalar field. Using\nthe $\\delta N$ formalism, the \"end of inflation\" scenario is investigated in\norder to ascertain whether this model is able to produce the dominant\ncontribution to the primordial curvature perturbation. A multitude of\nconstrains are considered so as to explore the parameter space, with particular\nemphasis to key observational signatures. For natural values of the parameters,\nthe model is found to yield a sharp prediction for the scalar spectral index\nand its running, well within the current observational bounds.\n", "  Engineering the electronic band structure of two-dimensional electron liquids\n(2DELs) confined at the surface or interface of transition metal oxides is key\nto unlocking their full potential. Here we describe a new approach to tailoring\nthe electronic structure of an oxide surface 2DEL demonstrating the lateral\nmodulation of electronic states with atomic scale precision on an unprecedented\nlength scale comparable to the Fermi wavelength. To this end, we use pulsed\nlaser deposition to grow anatase TiO2 films terminated by a (1 x 4) in-plane\nsurface reconstruction. Employing photo-stimulated chemical surface doping we\ninduce 2DELs with tunable carrier densities that are confined within a few TiO2\nlayers below the surface. Subsequent in-situ angle resolved photoemission\nexperiments demonstrate that the (1 x 4) surface reconstruction provides a\nperiodic lateral perturbation of the electron liquid. This causes strong\nbackfolding of the electronic bands, opening of unidirectional gaps and a\nsaddle point singularity in the density of states near the chemical potential.\n", "  The light of the merger remnant NGC 1316 is dominated by old and\nintermediate-age stars. The only sign of current star formation in this big\ngalaxy is the HII region SH2, an isolated star cluster complex with a ring-like\nmorphology and an estimated age of 0.1 Gyr at a galactocentric distance of\nabout 35 kpc. A nearby intermediate-age globular cluster, surrounded by weak\nline emission and a few more young star clusters, is kinematically associated.\nThe origin of this complex is enigmatic. The nebular emission lines permit a\nmetallicity determination which can discriminate between a dwarf galaxy or\nother possible precursors. We used the Integrated Field Unit of the VIMOS\ninstrument at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory to\nstudy the morphology, kinematics, and metallicity employing line maps, velocity\nmaps, and line diagnostics of a few characteristic spectra. The line ratios of\ndifferent spectra vary, indicating highly structured HII regions, but define a\nlocus of uniform metallicity. The strong-line diagnostic diagrams and empirical\ncalibrations point to a nearly solar or even super-solar oxygen abundance. The\nvelocity dispersion of the gas is highest in the region offset from the bright\nclusters. Star formation may be active on a low level. There is evidence for a\nlarge-scale disk-like structure in the region of SH2, which would make the\nsimilar radial velocity of the nearby globular cluster easier to understand.\nThe high metallicity does not fit to a dwarf galaxy as progenitor. We favour\nthe scenario of a free-floating gaseous complex having its origin in the merger\n2 Gyr ago. Over a long period the densities increased secularly until finally\nthe threshold for star formation was reached. SH2 illustrates how massive star\nclusters can form outside starbursts and without a considerable field\npopulation.\n", "  The reionization of the Universe is one of the most important topics of\npresent day astrophysical research. The most plausible candidates for the\nreionization process are star-forming galaxies, which according to the\npredictions of the majority of the theoretical and semi-analytical models\nshould dominate the HI ionizing background at z~3. We aim at measuring the\nLyman continuum escape fraction, which is one of the key parameters to compute\nthe contribution of star-forming galaxies to the UV background. We have used\nultra-deep U-band imaging (U=30.2mag at 1sigma) by LBC/LBT in the\nCANDELS/GOODS-North field, as well as deep imaging in COSMOS and EGS fields, in\norder to estimate the Lyman continuum escape fraction of 69 star-forming\ngalaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts at 3.27<z<3.40 to faint magnitude\nlimits (L=0.2L*, or equivalently M1500~-19). We have measured through stacks a\nstringent upper limit (<1.7% at 1sigma) for the relative escape fraction of HI\nionizing photons from bright galaxies (L>L*), while for the faint population\n(L=0.2L*) the limit to the escape fraction is ~10%. We have computed the\ncontribution of star-forming galaxies to the observed UV background at z~3 and\nwe have found that it is not enough to keep the Universe ionized at these\nredshifts, unless their escape fraction increases significantly (>10%) at low\nluminosities (M1500>-19). We compare our results on the Lyman continuum escape\nfraction of high-z galaxies with recent estimates in the literature and discuss\nfuture prospects to shed light on the end of the Dark Ages. In the future,\nstrong gravitational lensing will be fundamental to measure the Lyman continuum\nescape fraction down to faint magnitudes (M1500~-16) which are inaccessible\nwith the present instrumentation on blank fields.\n", "  Measurements of the linearly-polarized photon beam asymmetry $\\Sigma$ for\nphotoproduction from the proton of $\\eta$ and $\\eta^\\prime$ mesons are\nreported. A linearly-polarized tagged photon beam produced by coherent\nbremsstrahlung was incident on a cryogenic hydrogen target within the CEBAF\nLarge Acceptance Spectrometer. Results are presented for the $\\gamma p \\to \\eta\np$ reaction for incident photon energies from 1.070 to 1.876 GeV, and from\n1.516 to 1.836 GeV for the $\\gamma p \\to \\eta^\\prime p$ reaction. For $\\gamma p\n\\to \\eta p$, the data reported here considerably extend the range of\nmeasurements to higher energies, and are consistent with the few previously\npublished measurements for this observable near threshold. For $\\gamma p \\to\n\\eta^\\prime p$, the results obtained are consistent with the few previously\npublished measurements for this observable near threshold, but also greatly\nexpand the incident photon energy coverage for that reaction. Initial analysis\nof the data reported here with the Bonn-Gatchina model strengthens the evidence\nfor four nucleon resonances -- the $N(1895)1/2^-$, $N(1900)3/2^+$,\n$N(2100)1/2^+$ and $N(2120)3/2^-$ resonances -- which presently lack the\n\"four-star\" status in the current Particle Data Group compilation, providing\nexamples of how these new measurements help refine models of the\nphotoproduction process.\n", "  We propose a method to directly visualize the photonic band-structure of\nmicron size photonic crystals using wide angle spectroscopy. By extending\nFourier Imaging Spectroscopy sensitivity into the infrared range we have\nobtained accurate measurements of the band-structures along the high-symmetry\ndirections (X-W-K-L-U) of polymeric three-dimensional rod-connected diamond\nphotonic crystals. Our implementation also allows us to record\nsingle-wavelength reflectance far field patterns showing a very good agreement\nwith simulations of the same designs. This technique is suitable for the\ncharacterization of photonic structures working in the infrared and in\nparticular, to obtain band-structure information of complete photonic band gap\nmaterials.\n", "  Massive O-type stars play a dominant role in our Universe, but many of their\nproperties remain poorly constrained. In the last decade magnetic fields have\nbeen detected in all Galactic members of the distinctive Of?p class, opening\nthe door to a better knowledge of all O-type stars. With the aim of extending\nthe study of magnetic massive stars to nearby galaxies, to better understand\nthe role of metallicity in the formation of their magnetic fields and\nmagnetospheres, and to broaden our knowledge of the role of magnetic fields in\nmassive star evolution, we have carried out spectropolarimetry of five\nextra-Galactic Of?p stars, as well as a couple of dozen neighbouring stars. We\nhave been able to measure magnetic fields with typical error bars from 0.2 to\n1.0 kG, depending on the apparent magnitude and on weather conditions. No\nmagnetic field has been firmly detected in any of our measurements, but we have\nbeen able to estimate upper limits to the field values of our target stars. One\nof our targets, 2dFS 936, exhibited an unexpected strengthening of emission\nlines. We confirm the unusual behaviour of BI 57, which exhibits a 787 d period\nwith two photometric peaks and one spectroscopic maximum. The observed\nstrengthening of the emission lines of 2dFS 936, and the lack of detection of a\nstrong magnetic field in a star with such strong emission lines is at odd with\nexpectations. Together with the unusual periodic behaviour of BI 57, it\nrepresents a challenge for the current models of Of?p stars. The limited\nprecision that we obtained in our field measurements (in most cases as a\nconsequence of poor weather) has led to field-strength upper limits that are\nsubstantially larger than those typically measured in Galactic magnetic O\nstars. Further higher precision observations and monitoring are clearly\nrequired.\n", "  The curvature of bit transitions on granular media is a serious problem for\nthe read-back process. We address this fundamental issue and propose a\npossibility to efficiently reduce transition curvatures with state-of-the-art\nheat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) heads. We compare footprints of\nconventional with those of the proposed head design on different media,\nconsisting of exchange coupled and single phase grains. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the impact of various recording parameters, like the full width at\nhalf maximum (FWHM) of the applied heat pulse and the coercivity gradient near\nthe write temperature of the recording grains. The footprints are calculated\nwith a coarse grained model, based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation.\nThe presented simulations show a transition curvature reduction of up to 40 %,\nin the case of a medium with exchange coupled grains and a heat pulse with a\nFWHM of 40 nm. We further give the reason for the straightening of the bit\ntransitions, by means of basic considerations with regard to the effective\nrecording time window (ERTW) of the write process. Besides the transition\ncurvature reduction the proposed head design yields an improvement of the\ntransition jitter in both down-track and off-track direction.\n", "  We extend the adiabatic regularization method for an expanding universe to\ninclude the Yukawa interaction between quantized Dirac fermions and a\nhomogeneous background scalar field. We give explicit expressions for the\nrenormalized expectation values of the stress-energy tensor $\\langle T_{\\mu\\nu}\n\\rangle$ and the bilinear $\\langle \\bar\\psi\\psi\\rangle$ in a spatially flat\nFLRW spacetime. These are basic ingredients in the semiclassical field\nequations of fermionic matter in curved spacetime interacting with a background\nscalar field. The ultraviolet subtracting terms of the adiabatic regularization\ncan be naturally interpreted as coming from appropriate counterterms of the\nbackground fields. We fix the required covariant counterterms. To test our\napproach we determine the contribution of the Yukawa interaction to the\nconformal anomaly in the massless limit and show its consistency with the heat\nkernel method using the effective action.\n", "  Optical band gap properties of high-quality few-layer topological insulator\nBi2Se3 thin films grown with magnetron sputtering are investigated using\nbroadband absorption spectroscopy. We provide direct optical evidence of a\nrigid blue-shift to up to 0.5 eV in the band gap of Bi2Se3 as it approaches the\ntwo-dimensional limit. The onset of this behavior is most significant below six\nquintuple layers. The blue shift is very robust and is observed in both\nprotected (capped) and exposed (uncapped) thin films. Our results are\nconsistent with observations that finite-size effects have profound impact on\nthe electronic character of topological insulators, particularly when the top\nand bottom surface states are coupled. Our result provides new insights, and\nthe need for deeper investigations, into the scaling behavior of topological\nmaterials before they can have significant impact on electronic applications.\n", "  ZnO microspheres fabricated via laser ablation in superfluid helium were\nfound to have bubble-like voids. Even a microsphere demonstrating clear\nwhispering gallery mode resonances in the luminescence had voids. Our analysis\nconfirmed that the voids are located away from the surface and have negligible\nor little effect on the whispering gallery mode resonances since the\nelectromagnetic energy localizes near the surface of these microspheres. The\nexistence of the voids indicates that helium gas or any evaporated target\nmaterial was present within the molten microparticles during the microsphere\nformation.\n", "  We present a fast and efficient method to compute the inclusive two-particle\ntwo-hole (2p-2h) electroweak responses in the neutrino and electron\nquasielastic inclusive cross sections. The method is based on two\napproximations. The first neglects the motion of the two initial nucleons below\nthe Fermi momentum, which are considered to be at rest. This approximation,\nwhich is reasonable for high values of the momentum transfer, turns out also to\nbe quite good for moderate values of the momentum transfer $q\\gtrsim k_F$. The\nsecond approximation involves using in the \"frozen\" meson-exchange currents\n(MEC) an effective $\\Delta$-propagator averaged over the Fermi sea. Within the\nresulting \"frozen nucleon approximation\", the inclusive 2p-2h responses are\naccurately calculated with only a one-dimensional integral over the emission\nangle of one of the final nucleons, thus drastically simplifying the\ncalculation and reducing the computational time. The latter makes this method\nespecially well-suited for implementation in Monte Carlo neutrino event\ngenerators.\n", "  We report on a numerical study of the Boltzmann equation including\n$2\\leftrightarrow 2$ scatterings of gluons and quarks in an overoccupied Glasma\nundergoing longitudinal expansion. We find that when a cascade of gluon number\nto the infrared occurs, corresponding to an infrared enhancement analogous to a\ntransient Bose-Einstein condensate, gluon distributions qualitatively reproduce\nthe results of classical-statistical simulations for the expanding Glasma.\nThese include key features of the distributions that are not anticipated in the\n\"bottom-up\" thermalization scenario. We also find that quark distributions,\nlike those of gluons, satisfy self-similar scaling distributions in the\noveroccupied Glasma. We discuss the implications of these results for a deeper\nunderstanding of the self-similarity and universality of parton distributions\nin the Glasma.\n", "  Phonon transport of recently-fabricated $\\mathrm{Na_2He}$ at high pressure is\ninvestigated from a combination of first-principles calculations and the\nlinearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time\napproximation (RTA). The calculated room-temperature lattice thermal\nconductivity is 149.19 $\\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$, which is very close to one\nof Si. It is found that low-frequency optical modes comprise 16\\% of the\nlattice thermal conductivity, while high-frequency optical modes have\nnegligible contribution. The high lattice thermal conductivity is due to large\ngroup velocities, small Gr$\\mathrm{\\ddot{u}}$neisen parameters, and long phonon\nlifetimes. The size effects on lattice thermal conductivity are considered by\ncumulative thermal conductivity with respect to phonon mean free path(MFP). To\nsignificantly reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, the characteristic\nlength smaller than 100 nm is required, and can reach a decrease of 36\\%. These\nresults may be useful to understand thermal transport processes that occur\ninside giant planets.\n", "  The magnetic and structural properties of highly ordered (S ~ 0.82) epitaxial\nFe50-xMnxPt50 thin films were investigated. We report the change in the\nmagnetic properties of Mn doped FePt epitaxial thin films. This study differs\nfrom the earlier experimental studies on Mn doped FePt based alloys. Ordered\nL10 Fe50-xMnxPt50 (x=0, 6, 9, 12 and 15) thin films with a constant thickness\nof 45 nm were prepared by co-sputtering Fe50Pt50 and Mn50Pt50 on to MgO (100)\nsingle crystal substrate. We find a significant increase in the coercivity for\nFe-Mn-Pt thin films. We have shown that this increase in magnetic properties\ncoincide with the tetragonal distortion, while the recent first principles\nstudy of Mn doped FePt showed the sub lattice ordering of ferromagnetically\naligned Mn atoms would lead to increase in magnetic properties in the FeMnPt\nternary alloy system with fixed Pt concentration. At x=12 the coercivity has\nincreased by 46.4 % when compared to Fe50Pt50. The increase in magnetic\nproperties in Fe50-xMnxPt50 is due to the tetragonal distortion as experimental\nc/a ratio is larger than the expected c/a ratio for ferromagnetically ordered\nMn atoms in the sublattice at the concentration x=12. Thus we show that high\ntemperature deposition and high temperature annealing is one of the methods to\nachieve large coercivity in Mn doped FePt as it leads to tetragonal distortion.\n", "  As the target of the proposed Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA)\nmission, the near-Earth binary asteroid 65803 Didymos represents a special\nclass of binary asteroids, those whose primaries are at risk of rotational\ndisruption. To gain a better understanding of these binary systems and to\nsupport the AIDA mission, this paper investigates the creep stability of the\nDidymos primary by representing it as a cohesionless self-gravitating granular\naggregate subject to rotational acceleration. To achieve this goal, a\nsoft-sphere discrete element model (SSDEM) capable of simulating granular\nsystems in quasi-static states is implemented and a quasi-static spin-up\nprocedure is carried out. We devise three critical spin limits for the\nsimulated aggregates to indicate their critical states triggered by reshaping\nand surface shedding, internal structural deformation, and shear failure,\nrespectively. The failure condition and mode, and shear strength of an\naggregate can all be inferred from the three critical spin limits. The effects\nof arrangement and size distribution of constituent particles, bulk density,\nspin-up path, and interparticle friction are numerically explored. The results\nshow that the shear strength of a spinning self-gravitating aggregate depends\nstrongly on both its internal configuration and material parameters, while its\nfailure mode and mechanism are mainly affected by its internal configuration.\nAdditionally, this study provides some constraints on the possible physical\nproperties of the Didymos primary based on observational data and proposes a\nplausible formation mechanism for this binary system. With a bulk density\nconsistent with observational uncertainty and close to the maximum density\nallowed for the asteroid, the Didymos primary in certain configurations can\nremain geo-statically stable without including cohesion.\n", "  While the usual goal in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of Ising models is the\nefficient generation of spin configurations with Boltzmann probabilities, the\ninverse problem is to determine the coupling constants from a given set of spin\nconfigurations. Most recent work has been limited to local magnetic fields and\npair-wise interactions. We have extended solutions to multi-spin interactions,\nusing correlation function matching (CFM). A more serious limitation of\nprevious work has been the uncertainty of whether a chosen set of interactions\nis capable of faithfully representing real data. We show how our confirmation\ntesting method uses an additional MC simulation to detect significant\ninteractions that might be missing in the assumed representation of the data.\n", "  We investigate the locality of electronic interactions in aluminum as a\nfunction of smearing/electronic temperature in the context of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$\nDensity Functional Theory calculations. Specifically, we determine the\nconvergence in energy and atomic forces with truncation region size for\nsmearing of $0.001-0.15$ Ha. We find exponential convergence accompanied by a\nrate that increases sub-linearly with smearing, with truncation region sizes of\n$48-64$ Bohr required to achieve chemical accuracy for typical smearing values\nof $0.001-0.01$ Ha. This translates to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ scaling for systems\nlarger than $\\mathcal{O}(1000)$ atoms.\n", "  A new class of solution describing an anisotropic stellar configuration\nsatisfying Karmarkar's condition i.e. spherically symmetric metric of embedding\nclass 1, is reported. It has been shown that the compact star model is\nphysically well-behaved and meet all the physical requirements for a stable\nconfiguration in hydrostatic equilibrium. Our model describes compact stars\nlike Vela X-1 and 4U1608-52 to a very good approximation.\n", "  A giant planet has been recently resolved at a projected distance of 730 au\nfrom the tight pair of young ($\\sim$ 13 Myr) intermediate-mass stars HD\n106906AB in the Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) group. The stars are surrounded by a\ndebris disk which displays a ring-like morphology and strong asymmetries at\nmultiple scales. We aim at studying the likelihood of a scenario where the\nplanet formed closer to the stars in the disk, underwent inward disk-induced\nmigration, and got scattered away by the binary star before being stabilized by\na close encounter (fly-by). We performed semi-analytical calculations and\nnumerical simulations (Swift_HJS package) to model the interactions between the\nplanet and the two stars. We accounted for the migration as a simple force. We\nstudied the LCC kinematics to set constraints on the local density of stars,\nand therefore on the fly-by likelihood. We performed N-body simulations to\ndetermine the effects of the planet trajectories (ejection and secular effects)\nonto the disk morphology. The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet. Nonetheless,\nwe estimate that the fly-by hypothesis decreases the scenario probability to\nless than $10^{-7}$ for a derived local density of stars of 0.11\nstars/pc$^{3}$. We show that the concomitant effect of the planet and stars\ntrajectories induce spiral-features in the disk which may correspond to the\nobserved asymmetries. Moreover, the present disk shape suggests that the planet\nis on an eccentric orbit. The scenario we explored is a natural hypothesis if\nthe planet formed within a disk. Conversely, its low probability of occurrence\nand the fact that HD 106906 b shares some characteristics with other systems in\nSco-Cen (e.g. HIP 78530, in terms of mass ratio and separation) may indicate an\nalternative formation pathway for those objects.\n", "  We consider a propagation of transition fronts in one-dimensional chains with\nbi-stable nondegenerate on-site potential. If one adopts linear coupling in the\nchain and piecewise linear on-site force, then it is possible to develop\nwell-known exact solutions for the front and accompanying oscillatory tail. We\ndemonstrate that these solutions are essentially non-robust. Various\napproximations for the on-site potential with the same basic parameters (height\nand coordinate of the potential barrier, energy effect and distance between the\npotential wells) lead to substantially different front velocities. Besides,\ninclusion of even weak nearest neighbor nonlinearity drastically modifies the\nfront structure and parameters. The energy concentration in the front zone\nleads to a dominance of the nonlinear term. It turns out that the dynamics can\nbe efficiently studied in terms of an equivalent model with a single degree of\nfreedom. This estimation leads to accurate prediction of the front velocity and\nparameters of the oscillatory tail. Moreover, it turns out that the solution is\nrobust - exact shape of the on-site potential weakly effects the front\nparameters. This finding also conforms to the simplified model, since the\nlatter invokes only the general shape characteristics of the on-site potential.\n", "  We theoretically study transport properties of voltage-biased one-dimensional\nsuperconductor--normal metal--superconductor tunnel junctions with arbitrary\njunction transparency where the superconductors can have trivial or nontrivial\ntopology. Motivated by recent experimental efforts on Majorana properties of\nsuperconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, we consider two explicit models\nfor topological superconductors: (i) spinful p-wave, and (ii) spin-split\nspin-orbit-coupled s-wave. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the\nzero-temperature dc current $I$ and differential conductance $dI/dV$ of\nvoltage-biased junctions with or without Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The\npresence of an MZM necessarily gives rise to two tunneling conductance peaks at\nvoltages $eV = \\pm \\Delta_{\\mathrm{lead}}$, i.e., the voltage at which the\nsuperconducting gap edge of the lead aligns with the MZM. We find that the MZM\nconductance peak probed by a superconducting lead $without$ a BCS singularity\nhas a non-universal value which decreases with decreasing junction\ntransparency. This is in contrast to the MZM tunneling conductance measured by\na superconducting lead $with$ a BCS singularity, where the conductance peak in\nthe tunneling limit takes the quantized value $G_M = (4-\\pi)2e^2/h$ independent\nof the junction transparency. We also discuss the \"subharmonic gap structure\",\na consequence of multiple Andreev reflections, in the presence and absence of\nMZMs. Finally, we show that for finite-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs), the\nconductance peaks shift away from the gap bias voltage $eV = \\pm\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{lead}}$ to a larger value set by the ABSs energy. Our work\nshould have important implications for the extensive current experimental\nefforts toward creating topological superconductivity and MZMs in semiconductor\nnanowires proximity coupled to ordinary s-wave superconductors.\n", "  We argue that the Lorentzian path integral is a better starting point for\nquantum cosmology than the Euclidean version. In particular, we revisit the\nmini-superspace calculation of the Feynman path integral for quantum gravity\nwith a positive cosmological constant. Instead of rotating to Euclidean time,\nwe deform the contour of integration over metrics into the complex plane,\nexploiting Picard-Lefschetz theory to transform the path integral from a\nconditionally convergent integral into an absolutely convergent one. We show\nthat this procedure unambiguously determines which semiclassical saddle point\nsolutions are relevant to the quantum mechanical amplitude. Imposing\n\"no-boundary\" initial conditions, i.e., restricting attention to regular,\ncomplex metrics with no initial boundary, we find that the dominant saddle\ncontributes a semiclassical exponential factor which is precisely the {\\it\ninverse} of the famous Hartle-Hawking result.\n", "  Magnetic flux structure on the surface of EuFe$_2$(As$\\rm_{1-x}$P$\\rm_x$)$_2$\nsingle crystals with nearly optimal phosphorus doping levels $x=0.20$, and\n$x=0.21$ is studied by low-temperature magnetic force microscopy and decoration\nwith ferromagnetic nanoparticles. The studies are performed in a broad\ntemperature range. It is shown that the single crystal with $x=0.21$ in the\ntemperature range between the critical temperatures $T_{\\rm SC}=22$ K and\n$T_{\\rm C}=17.7$ K of the superconducting and ferromagnetic phase transitions,\nrespectively, has the vortex structure of a frozen magnetic flux, typical for\ntype-II superconductors. The magnetic domain structure is observed in the\nsuperconducting state below $T_{\\rm C}$. The nature of this structure is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present a surprisingly simple approach to high-accuracy calculations of\ncritical properties of the three-dimensional Ising model. The method uses a\nmodified block-spin transformation with a tunable parameter to improve\nconvergence in Monte Carlo renormalization group. The block-spin parameter must\nbe tuned differently for different exponents to produce optimal convergence.\n", "  Kinetic-range turbulence in magnetized plasmas and, in particular, in the\ncontext of solar-wind turbulence has been extensively investigated over the\npast decades via numerical simulations. Among others, one of the widely adopted\nreduced plasma model is the so-called hybrid-kinetic model, where the ions are\nfully kinetic and the electrons are treated as a neutralizing (inertial or\nmassless) fluid. Within the same model, different numerical methods and/or\napproaches to turbulence development have been employed. In the present work,\nwe present a comparison between two-dimensional hybrid-kinetic simulations of\nplasma turbulence obtained with two complementary approaches spanning about two\ndecades in wavenumber - from MHD inertial range to scales well below the ion\ngyroradius - with a state-of-the-art accuracy. One approach employs hybrid\nparticle-in-cell (HPIC) simulations of freely-decaying Alfv\\'enic turbulence,\nwhereas the other consists of Eulerian hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell (HVM) simulations\nof turbulence continuously driven with partially-compressible large-scale\nfluctuations. Despite the completely different initialization and\ninjection/drive at large scales, the same properties of turbulent fluctuations\nat $k_\\perp\\rho_i\\gtrsim1$ are observed. The system indeed self-consistently\n\"reprocesses\" the turbulent fluctuations while they are cascading towards\nsmaller and smaller scales, in a way which actually depends on the plasma beta\nparameter. Small-scale turbulence has been found to be mainly populated by\nkinetic Alfv\\'en wave (KAW) fluctuations for $\\beta\\geq1$, whereas KAW\nfluctuations are only sub-dominant for low-$\\beta$.\n", "  We present a systematic study of higher-twist distribution amplitudes (DAs)\nof the B-meson which give rise to power-suppressed $1/m_B$ contributions to\nB-decays in final states with energetic light particles in the framework of QCD\nfactorization. As the main result, we find that the renormalization group\nequations for the three-particle distributions are completely integrable in the\nlarge $N_c$ limit and can be solved exactly. General properties of the\nsolutions are studied. We propose simple models for higher-twist DAs which\nsatify all existing constraints and can be used in phenomenological studies.\n", "  The complexity of strongly correlated electron physics in vanadium dioxide is\nexemplified as its rich phase diagrams of all kinds, which in turn shed light\non the mechanisms behind its various phase transitions. In this work, we map\nout the hydrostatic pressure - temperature phase diagram of vanadium dioxide\nnanobeams by independently varying pressure and temperature with a diamond\nanvil cell. In addition to the well-known insulating M1 (monoclinic) and\nmetallic R (tetragonal) phases, the diagram identifies the existence at high\npressures of the insulating M1' (monoclinic, more conductive than M1) phase,\nand two metallic phases of X (monoclinic) and O (orthorhombic, at high\ntemperature only). Systematic optical and electrical measurements combined with\ndensity functional calculations allow us to delineate their phase boundaries as\nwell as reveal some basic features of the transitions.\n", "  We report, for the first time, a comprehensive study involving in situ Raman\nspectroscopy supported by quantum mechanical calculations to exactly monitor\nthe covalent binding to graphene with unprecedented precision. As a model\nreaction we have chosen the hydrogenation of reduced graphite ($KC_8$) with\n$H_2O$ and compared it with the corresponding exposure to $H_2$ and $O_2$. The\nearly stages of graphene hydrogenation are accompanied by the evolution of a\nseries of so far undiscovered D-bands ($D_1$-$D_5$). Using quantum mechanical\ncalculations, we were able to unambiguously assign these bands to distinct\nlattice vibrations in the neighborhood of the covalently bound addend.\nInterestingly, the exposure of $KC_8$ to $H_2$ and $O_2$ didn't cause covalent\nbinding, but intercalation of molecular $H_2$ or partial oxidation,\nrespectively. A combination of $H_2O$ and $O_2$ treatment led to the formation\nof additional hydroxyl (-OH) functionalities. The latter reaction represents a\nvery suitable model for the decomposition of graphenides under ambient\nconditions (hydrogenation and hydroxylation). We have applied this Raman\nanalysis to simulate and satisfactorily characterize a series of additional\ncovalently functionalised graphene derivatives prepared as bulk materials with\ndifferent composition (e.g. degree of functionalisation and the nature of\ncovalent addend) demonstrating the generality of the concept and the\nfundamental value for graphene chemistry.\n", "  A previous paper (M.F.Atiyah and N.S.Manton, Complex geometry of nuclei and\natoms, arXiv:1609.02816) modelled atoms and their isotopes by complex algebraic\nsurfaces, with the projective plane modelling Hydrogen. In this paper, models\nof the stable isotopes Helium-4 and Helium-3 are constructed.\n", "  Following the recent realisation that periodically driven quantum matter can\nsupport new types of spatiotemporal order, now known as discrete time crystals\n(DTCs), we consider the stability of this phenomenon. Motivated by its\nconceptual importance as well as its experimental relevance we consider the\neffect of coupling to an external environment. We use this to argue, both\nanalytically and numerically, that the DTC in disordered one-dimensional\nsystems is destroyed at long times by any such natural coupling. This holds\ntrue even in the case where the coupling is such that the system is prevented\nfrom heating up by an external thermal bath.\n", "  We propose the use of a combination of ultrasonic and magnetic fields in\nconductive media for the creation of RF electrical current via the Lorentz\nforce, in order to achieve current generation with extreme sub-wavelength\nresolution at large depth. We demonstrate the modeling, generation, and\nmeasurement of Lorentz current in conductive solution, and show that this\ncurrent can be localized at a distance of 13 $cm$ from the ultrasonic source to\na region about three orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding\nwavelength of electromagnetic waves at the same operation frequency. Our\nresults exhibit greater depth, tighter localization, and closer agreement with\nprediction than previous work on the measurement of Lorentz current in a\nsolution of homogeneous conductivity. The proposed method of RF current\nexcitation overcomes the trade-off between focusing and propagation that is\nfundamental in the use of RF electromagnetic excitation alone, and has the\npotential to improve localization and depth of operation for RF current-based\nbiomedical applications.\n", "  The hierarchical model of structure formation is a key prediction of the\nLambda cold dark matter model, which can be tested by studying the large-scale\nenvironment and the substructure content of massive galaxy clusters. We present\nhere a detailed analysis of the clusters RXCJ0225.9-4154, RXCJ0528.9-3927, and\nRXCJ2308.3-0211, as part of a sample of massive X-ray luminous clusters located\nat intermediate redshifts. We used a multiwavelength analysis, combining WFI\nphotometric observations, VIMOS spectroscopy, and the X-ray surface brightness\nmaps. We investigated the optical morphology of the clusters, we looked for\nsignificant counterparts in the residual X-ray emission, and we ran several\ntests to assess their dynamical state. We correlated the results to define\nvarious substructure features, to study their properties, and to quantify their\ninfluence on simple dynamical mass estimators. RXCJ0225 has a bimodal core, and\ntwo massive galaxy groups are located in its immediate surroundings; they are\naligned in an elongated structure that is also detected in X-rays. RXCJ0528 is\nlocated in a poor environment; an X-ray centroid shift and the presence of two\ncentral BCGs provide mild evidence for a recent and active dynamical history.\nRXCJ2308 has complex central dynamics, and it is found at the core of a\nsuperstes-cluster. The complexity of the cluster's central dynamics reflects\nthe richness of its large-scale environment: RXCJ0225 and RXCJ2308 present a\nmass fraction in substructures larger than the typical 0.05-0.15, whereas the\nisolated cluster RXCJ0528 does not have any major substructures within its\nvirial radius. The largest substructures are found in the cluster outskirts.\nThe optical morphology of the clusters correlates with the orientation of their\nBCG, and with the position of the main axes of accretion.\n", "  Motivated by the recent progress in analog computing [Science 343, 160\n(2014)], a new approach to perform spatial integration is presented using a\ndielectric slab waveguide. Our approach is indeed based on the fact that the\ntransmission coefficient of a simple dielectric slab waveguide at its mode\nexcitation angle matches the Green's function of first order integration.\nInspired by the mentioned dielectric-based integrator, we further demonstrate\nits graphene-based counterpart. The latter is not only reconfigurable but also\nhighly miniaturized in contrast to the previously reported designs [Opt.\nCommun. 338, 457 (2015)]. Such integrators have the potential to be used in\nultrafast analog computation and signal processing.\n", "  Context. The mechanism of disk formation around fast-rotating Be stars is not\nwell understood. In particular, it is not clear which mechanisms operate, in\naddition to fast rotation, to produce the observed variable ejection of matter.\nThe star Achernar is a privileged laboratory to probe these additional\nmechanisms because it is close, presents B-Be phase variations on timescales\nranging from 6 yr to 15 yr, a companion star was discovered around it, and\nprobably presents a polar wind or jet. Aims. Despite all these previous\nstudies, the disk around Achernar was never directly imaged. Therefore we seek\nto produce an image of the photosphere and close environment of the star.\nMethods. We used infrared long-baseline interferometry with the PIONIER/VLTI\ninstrument to produce reconstructed images of the photosphere and close\nenvironment of the star over four years of observations. To study the disk\nformation, we compared the observations and reconstructed images to previously\ncomputed models of both the stellar photosphere alone (normal B phase) and the\nstar presenting a circumstellar disk (Be phase). Results. The observations\ntaken in 2011 and 2012, during the quiescent phase of Achernar, do not exhibit\na disk at the detection limit of the instrument. In 2014, on the other hand, a\ndisk was already formed and our reconstructed image reveals an extended H-band\ncontinuum excess flux. Our results from interferometric imaging are also\nsupported by several H-alpha line profiles showing that Achernar started an\nemission-line phase sometime in the beginning of 2013. The analysis of our\nreconstructed images shows that the 2014 near-IR flux extends to 1.7 - 2.3\nequatorial radii. Our model-independent size estimation of the H-band continuum\ncontribution is compatible with the presence of a circumstellar disk, which is\nin good agreement with predictions from Be-disk models.\n", "  We present a chemical abundance analysis of the tidally disrupted globular\ncluster (GC) Palomar 5. By co-adding high-resolution spectra of 15 member stars\nfrom the cluster's main body, taken at low signal-to-noise with the Keck/HIRES\nspectrograph, we were able to measure integrated abundance ratios of 24 species\nof 20 elements including all major nucleosynthetic channels (namely the light\nelement Na; $\\alpha$-elements Mg, Si, Ca, Ti; Fe-peak and heavy elements Sc, V,\nCr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn; and the neutron-capture elements Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Sm,\nEu). The mean metallicity of $-1.56\\pm0.02\\pm0.06$ dex (statistical and\nsystematic errors) agrees well with the values from individual, low-resolution\nmeasurements of individual stars, but it is lower than previous high-resolution\nresults of a small number of stars in the literature. Comparison with Galactic\nhalo stars and other disrupted and unperturbed GCs renders Pal~5 a typical\nrepresentative of the Milky Way halo population, as has been noted before,\nemphasizing that the early chemical evolution of such clusters is decoupled\nfrom their later dynamical history. We also performed a test as to the\ndetectability of light element variations in this co-added abundance analysis\ntechnique and found that this approach is not sensitive even in the presence of\na broad range in sodium of $\\sim$0.6 dex, a value typically found in the old\nhalo GCs. Thus, while methods of determining the global abundance patterns of\nsuch objects are well suited to study their overall enrichment histories,\nchemical distinctions of their multiple stellar populations is still best\nobtained from measurements of individual stars.\n", "  We compute four-loop corrections to the hadronic decay of the Standard Model\nHiggs boson which are induced by effective couplings to bottom quarks and\ngluons, mediated by the top quark. Our numerical results are comparable in size\nto the purely massless contributions which have been known for a few years. The\nresults presented in this paper complete the order $\\alpha_s^4$ corrections to\nthe hadronic Higgs boson decay.\n", "  The sensitivity of direct terahertz detectors based on self-mixing of\nterahertz electromagnetic wave in field-effect transistors is being improved\nwith noise-equivalent power close to that of Schottky-barrier-diode detectors.\nHere we report such detectors based on AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas\nat 77~K are able to sense broadband and incoherent terahertz radiation. The\nmeasured photocurrent as a function of the gate voltage agrees well with the\nself-mixing model and the spectral response is mainly determined by the\nantenna. A Fourier-transform spectrometer equipped with detectors designed for\n340, 650 and 900~GHz bands allows for terahertz spectroscopy in a frequency\nrange from 0.1 to 2.0~THz. The 900~GHz detector at 77~K offers an optical\nsensitivity about $1~\\mathrm{pW/\\sqrt{Hz}}$ being comparable to a commercial\nsilicon bolometer at 4.2~K. By further improving the sensitivity,\nroom-temperature detectors would find applications in active/passive terahertz\nimaging and terahertz spectroscopy.\n", "  The role of mass and momentum exchanges in close massive binaries is very\nimportant in the subsequent evolution of the components. Such exchanges produce\nseveral observational signatures such as asynchronous rotation and altered\nchemical compositions, that remain after the stars detach again. We\ninvestigated these effects for the close O-star binary LSS 3074 (O4 f + O6-7\n:(f):), which is a good candidate for a past Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) episode\nbecause of its very short orbital period, P = 2.185 days, and the luminosity\nclasses of both components. We determined a new orbital solution for the\nsystem. We studied the photometric light curves to determine the inclination of\nthe orbit and Roche lobe filling factors of both stars. Using phase-resolved\nspectroscopy, we performed the disentangling of the optical spectra of the two\nstars. We then analysed the reconstructed primary and secondary spectra with\nthe CMFGEN model atmosphere code to determine stellar parameters, such as the\neffective temperatures and surface gravities, and to constrain the chemical\ncomposition of the components. We confirm the apparent low stellar masses and\nradii reported in previous studies. We also find a strong overabundance in\nnitrogen and a strong carbon and oxygen depletion in both primary and secondary\natmospheres, together with a strong enrichment in helium of the primary star.\nWe propose several possible evolutionary pathways through a RLOF process to\nexplain the current parameters of the system. We confirm that the system is\napparently in overcontact configuration and has lost a significant portion of\nits mass to its surroundings. We suggest that some of the discrepancies between\nthe spectroscopic and photometric properties of LSS 3074 could stem from the\nimpact of a strong radiation pressure of the primary.\n", "  The thermal expansion coefficients, structure factors, and viscosities of\ntwenty-five equilibrium and supercooled metallic liquids have been measured\nusing an electrostatic levitation (ESL) facility. The structure factor was\nmeasured at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, using the ESL. A clear\nconnection between liquid fragility and structural and volumetric changes at\nhigh temperatures is established; the observed changes are larger for the more\nfragile liquids. It is also demonstrated that the fragility of metallic liquids\nis determined to a large extent by the cohesive energy and is, therefore,\npredictable. These results are expected to provide useful guidance in the\nfuture design of metallic glasses.\n", "  We theoretically study the band structure and the electronic transport in the\nWeyl semimetal nanowires in magnetic fields, and demonstrate that the interplay\nof the Fermi-arc surface states and the bulk Landau levels plays a crucial role\nin the magnetotransport. We show that a magnetic field perpendicular to the\nsurface immediately hybridizes the counter-propagating surface modes into a\nseries of dispersionless 0th Landau levels, and it leads to a significant\nreduction of the traveling modes and a rapid decay of the conductance. On the\ncontrary, a magnetic field parallel to the wire adds linearly-dispersed 0th\nLandau levels to the traveling modes and increases the conductance.\n", "  In the framework of an equation of state (EoS) constructed from a momentum\nand density-dependent finite-range two-body effective interaction, the\nquantitative magnitudes of the different symmetry elements of infinite nuclear\nmatter are explored. The parameters of this interaction are determined from\nwell-accepted characteristic constants associated with homogeneous nuclear\nmatter. The symmetry energy coefficient $a_2$, its density slope $L_0$, the\nsymmetry incompressibility $K_\\delta $ as well as the density dependent\nincompressibility $K(\\rho )$ evaluated with this EoS are seen to be in good\nharmony with those obtained from other diverse perspectives. The higher order\nsymmetry energy coefficients $a_4,~a_6$ etc are seen to be not very significant\nin the domain of densities relevant to finite nuclei, but gradually build up at\nsupra-normal densities. The analysis carried with a Skyrme-inspired energy\ndensity functional obtained with the same input values for the empirical bulk\ndata associated with nuclear matter yields nearly the same results.\n", "  We study topological properties of one-triplon bands in an extended\nShastry-Sutherland model relevant for the frustrated quantum magnet\nSrCu_2(BO_3)_2. To this end perturbative continuous unitary transformations are\napplied about the isolated dimer limit allowing to calculate the one-triplon\ndispersion up to high order in various couplings including intra and inter\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and a general uniform magnetic field. We\ndetermine the Berry curvature and the Chern number of the different one-triplon\nbands. We demonstrate the occurance of Chern numbers $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm 2$ for\nthe case that two components of the magnetic field are finite. Finally, we also\ncalculate the triplon Hall effect arising at finite temperatures.\n", "  The Multi-Grid detector technology has evolved from the proof-of-principle\nand characterisation stages. Here we report on the performance of the\nMulti-Grid detector, the MG.CNCS prototype, which has been installed and tested\nat the Cold Neutron Chopper Spectrometer, CNCS at SNS. This has allowed a\nside-by-side comparison to the performance of $^3$He detectors on an\noperational instrument. The demonstrator has an active area of 0.2 m$^2$. It is\nspecifically tailored to the specifications of CNCS. The detector was installed\nin June 2016 and has operated since then, collecting neutron scattering data in\nparallel to the He-3 detectors of CNCS. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive analysis of this data, in particular on instrument energy\nresolution, rate capability, background and relative efficiency. Stability,\ngamma-ray and fast neutron sensitivity have also been investigated. The effect\nof scattering in the detector components has been measured and provides input\nto comparison for Monte Carlo simulations. All data is presented in comparison\nto that measured by the $^3$He detectors simultaneously, showing that all\nfeatures recorded by one detector are also recorded by the other. The energy\nresolution matches closely. We find that the Multi-Grid is able to match the\ndata collected by $^3$He, and see an indication of a considerable advantage in\nthe count rate capability. Based on these results, we are confident that the\nMulti-Grid detector will be capable of producing high quality scientific data\non chopper spectrometers utilising the unprecedented neutron flux of the ESS.\n", "  Most existing theories of dark energy and/or modified gravity, involving a\nscalar degree of freedom, can be conveniently described within the framework of\nthe Effective Theory of Dark Energy, based on the unitary gauge where the\nscalar field is uniform. We extend this effective approach by allowing the\nLagrangian in unitary gauge to depend on the time derivative of the lapse\nfunction. Although this dependence generically signals the presence of an extra\nscalar degree of freedom, theories that contain only one propagating scalar\ndegree of freedom, in addition to the usual tensor modes, can be constructed by\nrequiring the initial Lagrangian to be degenerate. Starting from a general\nquadratic action, we derive the dispersion relations for the linear\nperturbations around Minkowski and a cosmological background. Our analysis\ndirectly applies to the recently introduced Degenerate Higher-Order\nScalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories. For these theories, we find that one cannot\nrecover a Poisson-like equation in the static linear regime except for the\nsubclass that includes the Horndeski and so-called \"beyond Horndeski\" theories.\nWe also discuss Lorentz-breaking models inspired by Horava gravity.\n", "  Observed galactic disks have specific angular momenta similar to expectations\nfor typical dark matter halos in $\\Lambda$CDM. Cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations have recently reproduced this similarity in large galaxy samples by\nincluding strong galactic winds, but the exact mechanism that achieves this is\nnot yet clear. Here we present an analysis of key aspects contributing to this\nrelation: angular momentum selection and evolution of Lagrangian mass elements\nas they accrete onto dark matter halos, condense into Milky Way-scale galaxies,\nand join the $z=0$ stellar phase. We contrast this evolution in the Illustris\nsimulation with that in a simulation without galactic winds, where the $z=0$\nangular momentum is $\\approx0.6$ dex lower. We find that winds induce\ndifferences between these simulations in several ways: increasing angular\nmomentum, preventing angular momentum loss, and causing $z=0$ stars to sample\nthe accretion-time angular momentum distribution of baryons in a biased way. In\nboth simulations, gas loses on average $\\approx0.4$ dex between accreting onto\nhalos and first accreting onto central galaxies. In Illustris, this is followed\nby $\\approx0.2$ dex gains in the `galactic wind fountain' and no further net\nevolution past the final accretion onto the galaxy. Without feedback, further\nlosses of $\\approx0.2$ dex occur in the gas phase inside the galaxies. An\nadditional $\\approx0.15$ dex difference arises from feedback preferentially\nselecting higher angular momentum gas at accretion by expelling gas that is\npoorly aligned. These and additional effects of similar magnitude are\ndiscussed, suggesting a complex origin of the similarity between the specific\nangular momenta of galactic disks and typical halos.\n", "  We study the decay of 125 GeV Higgs boson to light LSP neutralino in the\nphenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model in the context of\ncollider searches and astrophysical experiments. We consider the parameter\nspace for light neutralinos that can be probed via the invisible Higgs decays\nand higgsino searches at the ILC. We consider the cases where the light\nneutralino is compatible with the observed relic density or where the thermal\nrelic is over-abundant, pointing to non-standard cosmology. In the former case,\nwhen the neutralino properties give rise to under-abundant relic density, the\ncorrect amount of relic abundance is assumed to be guaranteed by either\nadditional DM particles or by non-thermal cosmology. We contrast these\ndifferent cases. We assess what astrophysical measurements can be made, in\naddition to the measurements made at the ILC, which can provide a clue to the\nnature of the light neutralino. We find that a number of experiments, including\nXenon-nT, PICO-250, LZ in conjunction with measurements made at the ILC on\ninvisible Higgs width can pin down the nature of this neutralino, along with\nits cosmological implications. Additionally, we also point out potential LHC\nsignatures that could be complementary in this region of parameter space.\n", "  We investigate the form factors of $B_c$ meson into $S$-wave charmonium\nwithin the nonrelativistic QCD effective theory and obtain the next-to-leading\norder relativistic corrections to the form factors, where both the $B_c$ meson\nand the charmonium are treated as the nonrelativistic bound states. Treating\nthe charm quark as a light quark in the limit \\ $m_c/m_b\\to 0$, some form\nfactors are identical at the maximum recoil point, which are consistent with\nthe predictions in the heavy-quark effective theory and the large-energy\neffective theory. Considering that the branching ratios of $B^+_c \\to J/\\psi\nD_s^+$ and $B^+_c \\to J/\\psi D_s^{*+}$ have been measured by the LHCb and ATLAS\nCollaborations recently, we employ the form factors of $B_c$ meson into\n$S$-wave charmonium at the next-to-leading order accuracy to these two decay\nchannels and obtain more precise predictions of their decay rates. Numerical\nresults indicate that the factorizable diagrams dominate the contribution in\nthese two channels, while the colour-suppressed and the annihilation diagrams\ncontribute less than 10 percent. Our results are consistent with the LHCb and\nATLAS data.\n", "  This article proposes a new energy harvesting concept that greatly enhances\nthermionic power generation with high e ciency by exploiting the near- field\nenhancement of thermal radiation. The proposed near-field enhanced thermionic\nenergy conversion (NETEC) system is uniquely configured with a low-bandgap\nsemiconductor cathode separated from a thermal emitter with a subwavelength gap\ndistance, such that a significant amount of electrons can be photoexcited by\nnear-field thermal radiation to contribute to the enhancement of thermionic\ncurrent density. We theoretically demonstrate that the NETEC system can\ngenerate electric power at a significantly lower temperature than the standard\nthermionic generator, and the energy conver- sion e ciency can exceed 40%. The\nobtained results reveal that near-field photoexcitation can enhance the\nthermionic power output by more than 10 times, making this hybrid system\nattractive for renewable energy recycling.\n", "  New strong non-spiralling-in gravitational wave (GW) source for LIGO/VIRGO\ndetectors are proposed. Double O-Ne-Mg white dwarf mergers can produce strong\ngravitational waves with frequencies in the several hundreds Hz range. Such\nevents can be followed by a Super Nova type Ia.\n", "  We consider configuration mixing for the nonstrange positive parity excited\nbaryons in the $[\\mathbf{56'},0^+],[\\mathbf{56},2^+], [\\mathbf{70},0^+] $ and\n$[\\mathbf{70},2^+]$ quark model $SU(6) \\times O(3)$ multiplets contained in the\n$N=2$ band. Starting from the effective mass operator for these states we show\nby an explicit calculation that in the large $N_c$ limit they fall into six\ntowers of degenerate states labeled by $K=0,1,1',2,2',3$. We find that the\nmixing of the quark model states is much simpler than what is naively expected.\nTo leading order in $N_c$ only states carrying the same $K$ label can mix,\nwhich implies that for the spin-flavor states we started with configuration\nmixing can be parameterized by just two constants, $\\mu_{K=1}$ and $\\mu_{K=2}$.\n", "  The existence of closed loops of degeneracies in crystals has been intimately\nconnected to associated crystal symmetries, raising the question: what is the\nminimum symmetry required for topological character, and can one find an\nexample? Triclinic CaAs$_3$, in space group $P{\\bar 1}$ with only a center of\ninversion, has been found to display, without need for tuning, a nodal loop of\naccidental degeneracies with topological character, centered on one face of the\nBrillouin zone that is otherwise fully gapped. The small loop is very flat in\nenergy, yet is cut four times by the Fermi energy, a condition that results in\nan intricate repeated touching of inversion related pairs of Fermi surfaces at\nWeyl points. Spin-orbit coupling lifts the fourfold degeneracy along the loop,\nleaving trivial Kramers pairs. With its single nodal loop that emerges without\nprotection from any point group symmetry, CaAs$_3$ represents the primal\n\"hydrogen atom\" of nodal loop systems.\n", "  The determination of the density matrix of an ensemble of identically\nprepared quantum systems by performing a series of measurements, known as\nquantum tomography, is minimal when the number of outcomes is minimal. The most\naccurate minimal quantum tomography of qubits, sometimes called a tetrahedron\nmeasurement, corresponds to projections over four states which can be\nrepresented on the Bloch sphere as the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. We\ninvestigate whether it is possible to implement the tetrahedron measurement of\ndouble slit qubits of light, using measurements performed on a single plane.\nAssuming Gaussian slits and free propagation, we demonstrate that a judicious\nchoice of the detection plane and the double slit geometry allows the\nimplementation of a tetrahedron measurement. Finally, we consider possible sets\nof values which could be used in actual experiments.\n", "  A major issue in the development of spintronic memory devices is the\nreduction of the power consumption for the magnetization reversal. For this\npurpose, the artificial control of the magnetic anisotropy of ferromagnetic\nmaterials is of great importance. Here, we demonstrate the control of the\ncarrier-energy dependence of the magnetic anisotropy of the density of states\n(DOS) using the quantum size effect in a single-crystal ferromagnetic material,\nGaMnAs. We show that the mainly two-fold symmetry of the magnetic anisotropy of\nDOS, which is attributed to the impurity band, is changed to a four-fold\nsymmetry by enhancing the quantum size effect in the valence band of the GaMnAs\nquantum wells. By combination with the gate-electric field control technique,\nour concept of the usage of the quantum size effect for the control of the\nmagnetism will pave the way for the ultra-low-power manipulation of\nmagnetization in future spintronic devices.\n", "  The large mass of the $\\eta'$ meson indicates that a sizeable gluon component\nis present in the meson wave function. However, the $\\chi_{c0}$ and $\\chi_{c2}$\ndecays to $\\eta'$ mesons, which proceed via a purely gluonic intermediate state\nand we would therefore na\\\"{i}vely expect to be enhanced by such a component,\nare in fact relatively suppressed. We argue that this apparent contradiction\nmay be resolved by a proper treatment of interference effects in the decay. In\nparticular, by accounting for the destructive interference between the quark\nand gluon components of the $\\eta'$ distribution function, in combination with\na model for strange quark mass effects, we demonstrate that the observed\n$\\chi_{c(0,2)}\\to\\eta(')\\eta(')$ branching ratios can be reproduced for a\nreasonable gluon component of the $\\eta'$, $\\eta$ mesons.\n", "  Recently the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) approach has been extended to loop level,\nbut the resulting loop integrand has propagators that are linear in the loop\nmomentum unlike Feynman's. In this note we present a new technique that\ndirectly produces quadratic propagators identical to Feynman's from the CHY\napproach. This paper focuses on $\\Phi^3$ theory but extensions to others\ntheories are briefly discussed. In addition, our proposal has an interesting\ngeometric meaning, we can interpret this new formula as a unitary cut on a\nhigher genus Riemann surface.\n", "  We consider a class of baryogenesis models where the Lagrangian in the\nvisible sector is Charge-Parity (CP) invariant and a baryon asymmetry is\nproduced only when quantum statistics is taken into account. The CP symmetry is\nbroken by matter effects, namely the assumption that the primordial plasma\ncontains another asymmetric species, such as dark matter. Out-of-equilibrium\nbaryon number violating decays can then generate an asymmetry through Bose\nenhancement and/or Pauli blocking of certain decay channels.\n", "  In this paper we revisit the one-dimensional tunnelling problem. We consider\ndifferent approximations for the transmission through the Coulomb barrier in\nheavy ion collisions at near-barrier energies. First, we discuss approximations\nof the barrier shape by functional forms where the transmission coefficient is\nknown analytically. Then, we consider Kemble's approximation for the\ntransmission coefficient. We show how this approximation can be extended to\nabove-barrier energies by performing the analytical continuation of the radial\ncoordinate to the complex plane. We investigate the validity of the different\napproximations considered in this paper by comparing their predictions for\ntransmission coefficients and cross sections of three heavy ion systems with\nthe corresponding quantum mechanical results.\n", "  The reduced-particle model is the central element for the systematic\nderivation of the gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations from first principles.\nCoupled to the fields inside the gyrokinetic field-particle Lagrangian, the\nreduced-particle model defines polarization and magnetization effects appearing\nin the gyrokinetic Maxwell equations. It is also used for the reconstruction of\nthe gyrokinetic Vlasov equation from the particle characteristics. Various\nrepresentations of reduced-particle models are available according to the\nchoice of the gyrokinetic phase space coordinates. In this paper, the\nHamiltonian representation of the reduced particle dynamics at an order\nsuitable for the implementation in particle-in-cell simulations is explicitly\nderived from the general reduction procedure. The second-order (with respect to\nthe fluctuating electromagnetic fields), full Finite Larmor Radius (FLR)\nHamiltonian gyrokinetic particle model as well as the second-order model\nsuitable specifically for the long-wavelength approximation (i.e., containing\nup to the second-order FLR corrections), are derived and compared to the model\nrecently implemented in the particle-in-cell code ORB5. We show that the same\nlong-wavelength approximate equations can also be derived by taking the proper\nlimit of the full FLR model.\n", "  We discuss the hydrodynamic collective effects due to active protein\nmolecules that are immersed in lipid bilayer membranes and modeled as\nstochastic force dipoles. We specifically take into account the presence of the\nbulk solvent which surrounds the two-dimensional fluid membrane. Two membrane\ngeometries are considered: the free membrane case and the confined membrane\ncase. Using the generalized membrane mobility tensors, we estimate the active\ndiffusion coefficient and the drift velocity as a function of the size of a\ndiffusing object. The hydrodynamic screening lengths distinguish the two\nasymptotic regimes of these quantities. Furthermore, the competition between\nthe thermal and non-thermal contributions in the total diffusion coefficient is\ncharacterized by two length scales corresponding to the two membrane\ngeometries. These characteristic lengths describe the crossover between\ndifferent asymptotic behaviors when they are larger than the hydrodynamic\nscreening lengths.\n", "  The interstellar medium scatters radio waves which causes pulsars to\nscintillate. For intrinsically short bursts of emission, the observed signal\nshould be a direct measurement of the impulse response function. We show that\nthis is indeed the case for giant pulses from PSR B1957+20: from baseband\nobservations at 327 MHz, we demonstrate that the observed voltages of a bright\npulse allow one to coherently descatter nearby ones. We find that while the\nscattering timescale is $12.3\\,\\mu$s, the power in the descattered pulses is\nconcentrated within a span almost two orders of magnitude shorter, of\n$\\lesssim\\!200\\,$ns. This sets an upper limit to the intrinsic duration of the\ngiant pulses. We verify that the response inferred from the giant pulses is\nconsistent with the scintillation pattern obtained by folding the regular\npulsed emission, and that it decorrelates on the same timescale, of~$84\\,$s. In\nprinciple, with large sets of giant pulses, it should be possible to constrain\nthe structure of the scattering screen much more directly than with other\ncurrent techniques, such as holography on the dynamic spectrum and cyclic\nspectroscopy.\n", "  The motion of a charged particle in a nonuniform straight magnetic field with\na uniform magnetic-field gradient is solved exactly in terms of elliptic\nfunctions. The connection between this problem and the guiding-center\napproximation is discussed. It is shown that, for this problem, the predictions\nof guiding-center theory agree very well with the orbit-averaged particle\nmotion and hold well beyond the standard guiding-center limit $\\epsilon \\equiv\n\\rho/L \\ll 1$, where $\\rho$ is the gyromotion length scale and $L$ is the\nmagnetic-field gradient length scale.\n", "  Quantization of the bosonic string around the classical, perturbative vacuum\nis not consistent for spacetime dimensions 2<d<26. Recently we have showed that\nat large d there is another so-called mean field vacuum. Here we extend this\nmean field calculation to finite d and show that the corresponding mean field\nvacuum is stable under quadratic fluctuations for 2<d<26. We point out the\nanalogy with the two-dimensional O(N)-symmetric sigma-model, where the\n1/N-vacuum is very close to the real vacuum state even for finite N, in\ncontrast to the perturbative vacuum.\n", "  Magnetic structure of the multiferroic Ca$_{2}$CoSi$_{2}$O$_{7}$ was\ndetermined by neutron diffraction techniques. Combination of the\npolycrystalline and single-crystal samples experiments revealed a collinear\nantiferromagnetic structure with the easy axis along $<$100$>$ directions. The\ndielectric state was discussed in the framework of the spin-dependent $d$-$p$\nhybridization mechanism, leading to the realization of the antiferroelectric\nstructure. The origin of the magnetic anisotropy was discussed in comparison\nwith the isostructural Ba$_{2}$CoGe$_{2}$O$_{7}$.\n", "  We exploit the deep resolved Halpha kinematic data from the KMOS^3D and\nSINS/zC-SINF surveys to examine the largely unexplored outer disk kinematics of\nstar-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to the peak of cosmic star formation. Our\nsample contains 101 SFGs representative of the more massive (9.3 < log(M*/Msun)\n< 11.5) main sequence population at 0.6<z<2.6. Through a novel stacking\napproach we are able to constrain a representative rotation curve extending out\nto ~4 effective radii. This average rotation curve exhibits a significant drop\nin rotation velocity beyond the turnover, with a slope of Delta(V)/Delta(R) =\n$-0.26^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ in units of normalized coordinates V/V_max and\nR/R_turn. This result confirms that the fall-off seen previously in some\nindividual galaxies is a common feature of our sample of high-z disks. We show\nthat this outer fall-off strikingly deviates from the flat or mildly rising\nrotation curves of local spiral galaxies of similar masses. We furthermore\ncompare our data with models including baryons and dark matter demonstrating\nthat the falling stacked rotation curve can be explained by a high mass\nfraction of baryons relative to the total dark matter halo (m_d>~0.05) in\ncombination with a sizeable level of pressure support in the outer disk. These\nfindings are in agreement with recent studies demonstrating that star-forming\ndisks at high redshift are strongly baryon dominated within the disk scale, and\nfurthermore suggest that pressure gradients caused by large turbulent gas\nmotions are present even in their outer disks. We demonstrate that these\nresults are largely independent of our model assumptions such as the presence\nof a central stellar bulge, the effect of adiabatic contraction at fixed m_d,\nand variations in the concentration parameter.\n", "  We report on the results of radio observations in the 21 cm emission line of\natomic hydrogen (HI) of four relatively isolated ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs):\nDGSAT I, R-127-1, M-161-1, and SECCO-dI-2. Our Effelsberg observations resulted\nin non-detections for the first three UDGs, and a clear detection for the last.\nDGSAT I, R-127-1, and M-161-1 are quiescent galaxies with gas fractions that\nare much lower than those of typical field galaxies of the same stellar mass.\nOn the other hand, SECCO-dI-2 is a star forming gas-rich dwarf, similar to two\nother field UDGs that have literature HI data: SECCO-dI-1 and UGC 2162. This\ngroup of three gas-rich UDGs have stellar and gaseous properties that are\ncompatible with a recently proposed theoretical mechanism for the formation of\nUDGs, based on feedback-driven outflows. In contrast, the physical\ncharacteristics of R-127-1 and M-161-1 are puzzling, given their isolated\nnature. We interpret this dichotomy in the gaseous properties of field UDGs as\na sign of the existence of multiple mechanisms for their formation, with the\nformation of the quiescent gas-poor UDGs remaining a mystery.\n", "  We have developed a model of the nonlinear polariton dynamics in realistic 3D\nnon-planar microcavity wires in the driven-dissipative regime. We find that the\ntypical microcavity optical bistability evolves into multistability upon\nvariation of the model parameters. The origin of the multistability is\ndiscussed in detail. We apply linear perturbation analysis to modulational\ninstabilities, and identify conditions for localisation of composite multi-mode\npolariton solitons in the triggered parametric oscillator regime. Further, we\ndemonstrate stable polariton soliton propagation in tilted and tapered\nwaveguides, and determine maximum tilt angles for which solitons still exist.\nAdditionally, we study soliton amplitude and velocity dependence on the wire\nwidth, with a view to engineering quantum photonic devices.\n", "  We study numerically the inertial migration of a single rigid sphere and an\noblate spheroid in straight square and rectangular ducts. A highly accurate\ninterface-resolved numerical algorithm is employed to analyse the entire\nmigration dynamics of the oblate particle and compare it with that of the\nsphere. Similarly to the inertial focusing of spheres, the oblate particle\nreaches one of the four face-centred equilibrium positions, however they are\nvertically aligned with the axis of symmetry in the spanwise direction. In\naddition, the lateral trajectories of spheres and oblates collapse into an\nequilibrium manifold before ending at the equilibrium positions, with the\nequilibrium manifold tangential to lines of constant background shear for both\nsphere and oblate particles. The differences between the migration of the\noblate and sphere are also presented, in particular the oblate may focus on the\ndiagonal symmetry line of the duct cross-section, close to one of the corners,\nif its diameter is larger than a certain threshold. Moreover, we show that the\nfinal orientation and rotation of the oblate exhibit a chaotic behaviour for\nReynolds numbers beyond a critical value. Finally, we document that the lateral\nmotion of the oblate particle is less uniform than that of the spherical\nparticle due to its evident tumbling motion throughout the migration. In a\nsquare duct, the strong tumbling motion of the oblate in the first stage of the\nmigration results in a lower lateral velocity and consequently longer focusing\nlength with respect to that of the spherical particle. The opposite is true in\na rectangular duct where the higher lateral velocity of the oblate in the\nsecond stage of the migration, with negligible tumbling, gives rise to shorter\nfocusing lengths. These results can help the design of microfluidic systems for\nbio-applications.\n", "  We present ALMA detections of the [CI] 1-0, CO J=3-2, and CO J=4-3 emission\nlines, as well as the ALMA band 4 continuum for a compact star-forming galaxy\n(cSFG) at z=2.225, 3D-HST GS30274. As is typical for cSFGs, this galaxy has a\nstellar mass of $1.89 \\pm 0.47\\,\\times 10^{11}\\,\\rm{M}_\\odot$, with a star\nformation rate of $214\\pm44\\,\\rm{M}_\\odot\\,\\rm{yr}^{-1}$ putting it on the\nstar-forming `main-sequence', but with an H-band effective radius of 2.5 kpc,\nmaking it much smaller than the bulk of `main-sequence' star-forming galaxies.\nThe intensity ratio of the line detections yield an ISM density (~ 6 $\\times\n10^{4}\\,\\rm{cm}^{-3}$) and a UV-radiation field ( ~2 $\\times 10^4\\,\\rm{G}_0$),\nsimilar to the values in local starburst and ultra-luminous infrared galaxy\nenvironments. A starburst phase is consistent with the short depletion times\n($t_{\\rm H2, dep} \\leq 140$ Myr) we find using three different proxies for the\nH2 mass ([CI], CO, dust mass). This depletion time is significantly shorter\nthan in more extended SFGs with similar stellar masses and SFRs. Moreover, the\ngas fraction of 3D-HST GS30274 is smaller than typically found in extended\ngalaxies. We measure the CO and [CI] kinematics and find a FWHM line width of\n~$750 \\pm 41 $ km s$^{-1}$. The CO and [CI] FWHM are consistent with a\npreviously measured H$\\alpha$ FWHM for this source. The line widths are\nconsistent with gravitational motions, suggesting we are seeing a compact\nmolecular gas reservoir. A previous merger event, as suggested by the\nasymmetric light profile, may be responsible for the compact distribution of\ngas and has triggered a central starburst event. This event gives rise to the\nstarburst-like ISM properties and short depletion times. The centrally located\nand efficient star formation is quickly building up a dense core of stars,\nresponsible for the compact distribution of stellar light in 3D-HST GS30274.\n", "  A Stirling engine made of a colloidal particle in contact with a\nnonequilibrium bath is considered and analyzed with the tools of stochastic\nenergetics. We model the bath by non Gaussian persistent noise acting on the\ncolloidal particle. Depending on the chosen definition of an isothermal\ntransformation in this nonequilibrium setting, we find that either the\nenergetics of the engine parallels that of its equilibrium counterpart or, in\nthe simplest case, that it ends up being less efficient. Persistence, more than\nnon Gaussian effects, are responsible for this result.\n", "  We study a mechanical resonator made of aluminum near the normal to super\nconductivity phase transition. A sharp drop in the rate of mechanical damping\nis observed below the critical temperature. The experimental results are\ncompared with predictions based on the Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer theory of\nsuperconductivity and a fair agreement is obtained.\n", "  We investigate one-dimensional elementary probabilistic cellular automata\n(PCA) whose dynamics in first-order mean-field approximation yields discrete\nlogisticlike growth models for a single-species unstructured population with\nnonoverlapping generations. Beginning with a general six-parameter model, we\nfind constraints on the transition probabilities of the PCA that guarantee that\nthe ensuing approximations make sense in terms of population dynamics and\nclassify the valid combinations thereof. Several possible models display a\nnegative cubic term that can be interpreted as a weak Allee factor. We also\ninvestigate the conditions under which a one-parameter PCA derived from the\nmore general six-parameter model can generate valid population growth dynamics.\nNumerical simulations illustrate the behavior of some of the PCA found.\n", "  We examine the spectral properties of single and multiple matter-wave dark\nsolitons in Bose-Einstein condensates confined in parabolic traps, where the\nscattering length is periodically modulated. In addition to the large-density\nlimit picture previously established for homogeneous nonlinearities, we explore\na perturbative analysis in the vicinity of the linear limit, which provides\ngood agreement with the observed spectral modes. Between these two analytically\ntractable limits, we use numerical computations to fill in the relevant\nintermediate regime. We find that the scattering length modulation can cause a\nvariety of features absent for homogeneous nonlinearities. Among them, we note\nthe potential oscillatory instability even of the single dark soliton, the\npotential absence of instabilities in the immediate vicinity of the linear\nlimit for two dark solitons, and the existence of an exponential instability\nassociated with the in-phase motion of three dark solitons.\n", "  We report on an ion implantation technique utilizing a screening mask made of\nSiO$_2$ to control both the depth profile and the dose. By appropriately\nselecting the thickness of the screening layer, this method fully suppresses\nthe ion channeling, brings the location of the highest NV density to the\nsurface, and effectively reduces the dose by more than three orders of\nmagnitude. With a standard ion implantation system operating at the energy of\n10 keV and the dose of 10$^{11}$ cm$^2$ and without an additional etching\nprocess, we create single NV centers close to the surface with coherence times\nof a few tens of $\\mu$s.\n", "  We study the static black holes in the large $D$ dimensions in the\nGauss-Bonnet gravity with a cosmological constant, coupled to the Maxewell\ntheory. After integrating the equation of motion with respect to the radial\ndirection, we obtain the effective equations at large $D$ to describe the\nnonlinear dynamical deformations of the black holes. From the perturbation\nanalysis on the effective equations, we get the analytic expressions of the\nfrequencies for the quasinormal modes of charge and scalar-type perturbations.\nWe show that for a positive Gauss-Bonnet term, the black hole could become\nunstable only if the cosmological constant is positive, otherwise the black\nhole is always stable. However, for a negative Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that\nthe black hole could always be unstable. The instability of the black hole\ndepends not only on the cosmological constant and the charge, but also\nsignificantly on the Gauss-Bonnet term. Moreover, at the onset of instability\nthere is a non-trivial static zero-mode perturbation, which suggests the\nexistence of a new non-spherically symmetric solution branch. We construct the\nnon-spherical symmetric static solutions of the large $D$ effective equations\nexplicitly.\n", "  We discuss the properties of the topological soliton, or the\nElectroweak-Skyrmion, in the system of the Standard Model Higgs Lagrangian with\naddition of general O(p^4) terms. We show that the upper bound on the mass of\nthe Electroweak-Skyrmion is about 10 TeV, which is obtained from currently\navailable experimental constraints on coefficients of O(p^4) terms. The impact\non the properties of the Electroweak-Skyrmion due to further modification of\nthe Lagrangian is also discussed, and comments on possible mechanisms for the\ngeneration of the Electroweak-Skyrmion in the early Universe as a dark matter\nare given.\n", "  We show that an electric field parallel to an electrically neutral surface\ncan generate flow of electrolytic mixtures in small channels. We term this\nsolvo-osmotic flow, since the flow is induced by the asymmetric preferential\nsolvation of ions at the liquid-solid interface. The generated flow is\ncomparable in magnitude to the ubiquitous electro-osmotic flow at charged\nsurfaces, but for a fixed surface charge density, it differs qualitatively in\nits dependence on ionic strength. Solvo-osmotic flow can also be sensitively\ncontrolled with temperature. We derive a modified Helmholtz-Smoluchowski\nequation that accounts for these effects.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the spin injection in different FM/I/n-Si tunnel\ncontacts by using the lattice NEGF method. We find that the tunnel contacts\nwith low barrier materials such as TiO$_2$ and Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$, have much lower\nresistances than the conventional barrier materials, resulting in a wider and\nattainable optimum parameters window for improving the spin injection\nefficiency and MR ratio of a vertical spin MOSFET. Additionally, we find the\nspin asymmetry coefficient of TiO$_2$ tunnel contact has a negative value,\nwhile that of Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$ contact can be tuned between positive and\nnegative values, by changing the parameters.\n", "  We present an updated halo-dependent and halo-independent analysis of viable\nlight WIMP dark matter candidates which could account for the excess observed\nin CDMS-II-Si. We include recent constraints from LUX, PandaX-II, and PICO-60,\nas well as projected sensitivities for XENON1T, SuperCDMS SNOLAB, LZ, DARWIN,\nDarkSide-20k, and PICO-250, on candidates with spin-independent isospin\nconserving and isospin-violating interactions, and either elastic or exothermic\nscattering. We show that there exist dark matter candidates which can explain\nthe CDMS-II-Si data and remain very marginally consistent with the null results\nof all current experiments, however such models are highly tuned, making a dark\nmatter interpretation of CDMS-II-Si very unlikely. We find that these models\ncan only be ruled out in the future by an experiment comparable to LZ or\nPICO-250.\n", "  Context. Many databases on asteroid brightnesses (e.g. ALCDEF, WISE) are\npotential sources for extensive asteroid shape and spin modelling. Individual\nlightcurve inversion models require several apparitions and hundreds of data\npoints per target. However, we can analyse the coarse shape and spin\ndistributions over populations of at least thousands of targets even if there\nare only a few points and one apparition per asteroid. This is done by\nexamining the distribution of the brightness variations observed within the\nchosen population.\n  Aims. Brightness variation has been proposed as a population-scale rather\nthan individual-target observable in two studies so far. We aim to examine this\napproach rigorously to establish its theoretical validity, degree of\nill-posedness, and practical applicability.\n  Methods. We model the observed brightness variation of a target population by\nconsidering its cumulative distribution function (CDF) caused by the joint\ndistribution function of two fundamental shape and spin indicators. These are\nthe shape elongation and the spin latitude of a simple ellipsoidal model. The\nmain advantage of the model is that we can derive analytical basis functions\nthat yield the observed CDF as a function of the shape and spin distribution.\nThe inverse problem can be treated linearly. Even though the inaccuracy of the\nmodel is considerable, databases of thousands of targets should yield some\ninformation on the distribution.\n  Results. We establish the theoretical soundness and the typical accuracy\nlimits of the approach both analytically and numerically. Using simulations, we\nderive a practical estimate of the model distribution in the (shape,\nspin)-plane. We show that databases such as Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\n(WISE) yield coarse but robust estimates of this distribution, and as an\nexample compare various asteroid families with each other.\n", "  We perform a forecast analysis of the ability of the LISA space-based\ninterferometer to reconstruct the dark sector interaction using gravitational\nwave (GW) standard sirens at high redshift. We employ Gaussian process methods\nto reconstruct the distance-redshift relation in a model independent way. We\nadopt simulated catalogues of standard sirens given by merging massive black\nhole binaries (MBHBs) visible by LISA, with an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart\ndetectable by future telescopes. The catalogues are constructed considering\nthree different astrophysical scenarios for the evolution of MBHB mergers based\non the semi-analytic model of E. Barausse (2012). We first use these standard\nsiren datasets to assess the potential of LISA in reconstructing a possible\ninteraction between vacuum dark energy and dark matter. Then we combine the\nLISA cosmological data with supernovae data simulated for the Dark Energy\nSurvey (DES). We consider two scenarios distinguished by the time duration of\nthe LISA mission: 5 and 10 years. Using only LISA standard siren data, the dark\nsector interaction can be well reconstructed from redshift $z\\sim1$ to $z\\sim3$\n(5 yr) and $z\\sim1$ up to $z\\sim5$ (10 yr), though the reconstruction is\ninefficient at lower redshift. When combined with the DES datasets, the\ninteraction is well reconstructed in the whole redshift region from $z\\sim0$ to\n$z\\sim3$ (5 yr) and $z\\sim0$ to $z\\sim5$ (10 yr). MBHB standard sirens can thus\nbe used to constrain the dark sector interaction at redshift ranges not\nreachable by usual supernovae datasets which probe only the $z\\lesssim 1.5$\nrange. GW standard sirens will not only constitute a complementary and\nalternative way, with respect to familiar EM observations, to probe the cosmic\nexpansion, but will also provide new tests to constrain possible deviations\nfrom the standard $\\Lambda$CDM dynamics, especially at high redshift.\n", "  According to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the encounter of two collisional\nmagnetized plasmas at high velocity gives rise to shock waves. Investigations\nconducted so far have found that the same conclusion still holds in the case of\ncollisionless plasmas. For the case of a flow-aligned field, MHD stipulates\nthat the field and the fluid are disconnected, so that the shock produced is\nindependent of the field. We present a violation of this MHD prediction when\nconsidering the encounter of two cold pair plasmas along a flow-aligned\nmagnetic field. As the guiding magnetic field grows, isotropization is\nprogressively suppressed, resulting in a strong influence of the field on the\nresulting structure. A micro-physics analysis allows to understand the\nmechanisms at work. Particle-in-cell simulations also support our conclusions\nand show that the results are not restricted to a strictly parallel field.\n", "  We investigate the quench dynamics of a one-dimensional incommensurate\nlattice described by the Aubry-Andr\\'{e} model by a sudden change of the\nstrength of incommensurate potential $\\Delta$ and unveil that the dynamical\nsignature of localization-delocalization transition can be characterized by the\noccurrence of zero points in the Loschmit echo. For the quench process with\nquenching taking place between two limits of $\\Delta=0$ and $\\Delta=\\infty$, we\ngive analytical expressions of the Loschmidt echo, which indicate the existence\nof a series of zero points in the Loschmidt echo. For a general quench process,\nwe calculate the Loschmidt echo numerically and analyze its statistical\nbehavior. Our results show that if both the initial and post-quench Hamiltonian\nare in extended phase or localized phase, Loschmidt echo will always be greater\nthan a positive number; however if they locate in different phases, Loschmidt\necho can reach nearby zero at some time intervals.\n", "  In this paper, we establish the existence of both compressive stress and\ncharge transfer process in hydrothermally synthesized cobalt ferrite-graphene\noxide (CoFe2O4/GO) nanocomposites. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nresults reveal the decoration of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles on GO sheets. Magnetic\nresponse of nanocomposites was confirme from superconducting quantum\ninterference device (SQUID) magnetometer measurement. Optical properties of\nthese nanocomposites were investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Interfacial\ncompressive stress involved in this system is evaluated from observed blue\nshift of characteristic G peak of graphene oxide. Increase in full width\nhalf-maximum ( FWHM) as well as up shift in D and G peaks are clear indicator\nof involvement of charge transfer process between GO sheets and dispersed\nmagnetic nanoparticles. The effect of charge transfer process is quantified in\nterms of shifting of Fermi level of these nanocomposites. This is evaluated\nfrom variation in contact surface potential difference (CPD) using Scanning\nKelvin probe microscopy (SKPM). XRD spectra of CoFe2O4/GO confirm the\npolycrystalline nature of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. Lattice strain estimated from\nXRD peaks are correlated to the observed Raman shift.\n", "  In fusion plasmas the strong magnetic field allows the fast gyro-motion to be\nsystematically removed from the description of the dynamics, resulting in a\nconsiderable model simplification and gain of computational time. Nowadays, the\ngyrokinetic (GK) codes play a major role in the understanding of the\ndevelopment and the saturation of turbulence and in the prediction of the\nsubsequent transport. Naturally, these codes require thorough verification and\nvalidation.\n  Here we present a new and generic theoretical framework and specific\nnumerical applications to test the faithfulness of the implemented models to\ntheory and to verify the domain of applicability of existing GK codes. For a\nsound verification process, the underlying theoretical GK model and the\nnumerical scheme must be considered at the same time, which has rarely been\ndone and therefore makes this approach pioneering. At the analytical level, the\nmain novelty consists in using advanced mathematical tools such as variational\nformulation of dynamics for systematization of basic GK code's equations to\naccess the limits of their applicability. The verification of numerical scheme\nis proposed via the benchmark effort.\n  In this work, specific examples of code verification are presented for two GK\ncodes: the multi-species electromagnetic ORB5 (PIC) and the radially global\nversion of GENE (Eulerian). The proposed methodology can be applied to any\nexisting GK code. We establish a hierarchy of reduced GK Vlasov-Maxwell\nequations implemented in the ORB5 and GENE codes using the Lagrangian\nvariational formulation. At the computational level, detailed verifications of\nglobal electromagnetic test cases developed from the CYCLONE Base Case are\nconsidered, including a parametric $\\beta$-scan covering the transition from\nITG to KBM and the spectral properties at the nominal $\\beta$ value.\n", "  In curved space-time, Hamilton-Jacobi equation is a semi-classical particle's\nmotion equation, which plays an important role in the research of black hole\nphysics. In this paper, starting from Dirac equation describing the spin 1/2\nfermion and Rarita-Schwinger equation describing the spin 3/2 fermion\nrespectively, we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the non-stationary\nspherically symmetric gravitational field background. Furthermore, the quantum\ntunneling behavior of a charged spherically symmetric black hole is\ninvestigated by using this Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The result shows that the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation is helpful for people to understand the thermodynamic\nproperties and the radiation characteristics of a black hole.\n", "  We study decay properties of the $P$-wave charmed baryons using the method of\nlight-cone QCD sum rules, including the $S$-wave decays of the flavor\n$\\mathbf{\\bar 3}_F$ $P$-wave charmed baryons into ground-state charmed baryons\naccompanied by a pseudoscalar meson ($\\pi$ or $K$) or a vector meson ($\\rho$ or\n$K^*$), and the $S$-wave decays of the flavor $\\mathbf{6}_F$ $P$-wave charmed\nbaryons into ground-state charmed baryons accompanied by a pseudoscalar meson\n($\\pi$ or $K$). We study both two-body and three-body decays which are\nkinematically allowed. We find two mixing solutions from internal $\\rho$- and\n$\\lambda$-mode excitations, which can well describe both masses and decay\nproperties of the $\\Lambda_c(2595)$, $\\Lambda_c(2625)$, $\\Xi_c(2790)$ and\n$\\Xi_c(2815)$. We also discuss the possible interpretations of $P$-wave charmed\nbaryons for the $\\Sigma_c(2800)$, $\\Xi_c(2930)$, $\\Xi_c(2980)$, and the\nrecently observed $\\Omega_c(3000)$, $\\Omega_c(3050)$, $\\Omega_c(3066)$,\n$\\Omega_c(3090)$, and $\\Omega_c(3119)$.\n", "  We explore the H-alpha emission in the massive quiescent galaxies observed by\nthe KMOS-3D survey at 0.7 < z < 2.7. The H-alpha line is robustly detected in\n20 out of 120 UVJ-selected quiescent galaxies, and we classify the emission\nmechanism using the H-alpha line width and the [NII]/H-alpha line ratio. We\nfind that AGN are likely to be responsible for the line emission in more than\nhalf of the cases. We also find robust evidence for star formation activity in\nnine quiescent galaxies, which we explore in detail. The H-alpha kinematics\nreveal rotating disks in five of the nine galaxies. The dust-corrected H-alpha\nstar formation rates are low (0.2 - 7 Msun/yr), and place these systems\nsignificantly below the main sequence. The 24micron-based infrared\nluminosities, instead, overestimate the star formation rates. These galaxies\npresent a lower gas-phase metallicity compared to star-forming objects with\nsimilar stellar mass, and many of them have close companions. We therefore\nconclude that the low-level star formation activity in these nine quiescent\ngalaxies is likely to be fueled by inflowing gas or minor mergers, and could be\na sign of rejuvenation events.\n", "  A highly elongated plasma is desirable in order to increase plasma pressure\nand energy confinement to maximize fusion power output. However, there is a\nlimit to the maximum achievable elongation which is set by vertical\ninstabilities driven by the $n=0$ MHD mode. This limit can be increased by\noptimizing several parameters characterizing the plasma and the wall. The\npurpose of our study is to explore how and to what extent this can be done.\nSpecifically, we extend many earlier calculations of the $n=0$ mode and\nnumerically determine scaling relations for the maximum elongation as a\nfunction of dimensionless parameters describing (1) the plasma profile\n($\\beta_p$ and $l_i$), (2) the plasma shape ($\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$), (3) the\nwall radius ($b/a$) and (4) most importantly the feedback system capability\nparameter $\\gamma\\tau_w$. These numerical calculations rely on a new\nformulation of $n=0$ MHD theory we recently developed [Freidberg et. al. 2015;\nLee et. al. 2015] that reduces the 2-D stability problem into a 1-D problem.\nThis method includes all the physics of the ideal MHD axisymmetric instability\nwhile reducing the computation time significantly, so that many parameters can\nbe explored during the optimization process. Perhaps the most useful final\nresult is a simple analytic fit to the simulations which gives the maximum\nelongation and corresponding optimized triangularity as functions\n$\\kappa(\\epsilon,\\beta_p,l_i,b/a,\\gamma\\tau_w)$ and\n$\\delta(\\epsilon,\\beta_p,l_i,b/a,\\gamma\\tau_w)$. The scaling relations we\npresent include the effects of the optimal triangularity and the finite aspect\nratio on the maximum elongation, and can be useful for determining optimized\nplasma shapes in current experiments and future tokamak designs.\n", "  We discuss the propagation of heavy quarks (charm and bottom) through the QGP\nby means of a relativistic Boltzmann transport approach including both\ncollisional and radiative energy loss mechanisms. In particular we investigate\nthe impact of induced gluon radiation by dynamical QCD medium implementing in\nour transport model a formula for the emitted gluon spectrum calculated in a\nhigher-twist scheme. We notice that in the region of high transverse momentum\n($p_T > 10$ GeV) radiative processes play an essential role giving a dominant\ncontribution to the generation of $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ at momentum values for\nwhich the energy loss by collisions is in the perturbative regime.\n", "  The Bethe-Salpeter equation for three bosons with zero-range interaction is\nsolved for the first time. For comparison the light-front equation is also\nsolved. The input is the two-body scattering length and the outputs are the\nthree-body binding energies, Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes and light-front wave\nfunctions. Three different regimes are analyzed: ({\\it i}) For weak enough\ntwo-body interaction the three-body system is unbound. ({\\it ii}) For stronger\ntwo-body interaction a three-body bound state appears. It provides an\ninteresting example of a deeply bound Borromean system. ({\\it iii}) For even\nstronger two-body interaction this state becomes unphysical with a negative\nmass squared. However, another physical (excited) state appears, found\npreviously in light-front calculations. The Bethe-Salpeter approach implicitly\nincorporates three-body forces of relativistic origin, which are attractive and\nincrease the binding energy.\n", "  Photon anti-bunching, measured via the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss experiment, is one\nof the key signatures of quantum light and is tied to sub-Poissonian photon\nnumber statistics. Recently, it has been reported that photon anti-bunching or\nconditional sub-Poissonian photon number statistics can be obtained via\nsecond-order interference of mutually incoherent weak lasers and heralding\nbased on photon counting. Here, we report theoretical analysis on the limits of\nmanipulating conditional photon statistics via interference of weak lasers. It\nis shown that conditional photon number statistics can become super-Poissonian\nin such a scheme. We, however, demonstrate explicitly that it cannot become\nsub-Poissonian, i.e., photon anti-bunching cannot be obtained in such a scheme.\nWe point out that incorrect results can be obtained if one does not properly\naccount for seemingly negligible higher-order photon number expansions of the\ncoherent state.\n", "  Thanks to multi-spacecraft mission, it has recently been possible to directly\nestimate the current density in space plasmas, by using magnetic field time\nseries from four satellites flying in a quasi perfect tetrahedron\nconfiguration. The technique developed, commonly called 'curlometer' permits a\ngood estimation of the current density when the magnetic field time series vary\nlinearly in space. This approximation is generally valid for small spacecraft\nseparation. The recent space missions Cluster and Magnetospheric Multiscale\n(MMS) have provided high resolution measurements with inter-spacecraft\nseparation up to 100 km and 10 km, respectively. The former scale corresponds\nto the proton gyroradius/ion skin depth in 'typical' solar wind conditions,\nwhile the latter to sub-proton scale. However, some works have highlighted an\nunderestimation of the current density via the curlometer technique with\nrespect to the current computed directly from the velocity distribution\nfunctions, measured at sub-proton scales resolution with MMS. In this paper we\nexplore the limit of the curlometer technique studying synthetic data sets\nassociated to a cluster of four artificial satellites allowed to fly in a\nstatic turbulent field, spanning a wide range of relative separation. This\nstudy tries to address the relative importance of measuring plasma moments at\nvery high resolution from a single spacecraft with respect to the\nmulti-spacecraft missions in the current density evaluation.\n", "  In extensions of the Standard Model with extra scalars, the electroweak phase\ntransition can be very strong, and the bubble walls can be highly relativistic.\nWe revisit our previous argument that electroweak bubble walls can \"run away,\"\nthat is, achieve extreme ultrarelativistic velocities $\\gamma \\sim 10^{14}$. We\nshow that, when particles cross the bubble wall, they can emit transition\nradiation. Wall-frame soft processes, though suppressed by a power of the\ncoupling $\\alpha$, have a significance enhanced by the $\\gamma$-factor of the\nwall, limiting wall velocities to $\\gamma \\sim 1/\\alpha$. Though the bubble\nwalls can move at almost the speed of light, they carry an infinitesimal share\nof the plasma's energy.\n", "  While current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) have been extensively studied\nin ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, ferrimagnets have been less studied. Here\nwe report the presence of enhanced spin-orbit torques resulting from negative\nexchange interaction in ferrimagnets. The effective field and switching\nefficiency increase substantially as CoGd approaches its compensation point,\ngiving rise to 9 times larger spin-orbit torques compared to that of\nnon-compensated one. The macrospin modelling results also support efficient\nspin-orbit torques in a ferrimagnet. Our results suggest that ferrimagnets near\ncompensation can be a new route for spin-orbit torque applications due to their\nhigh thermal stability and easy current-induced switching assisted by negative\nexchange interaction.\n", "  Rotation plays a key role in the star-formation process, from pre-stellar\ncores to pre-main-sequence (PMS) objects. Understanding the formation of\nmassive stars requires taking into account the accretion of angular momentum\nduring their PMS phase. We study the PMS evolution of objects destined to\nbecome massive stars by accretion, focusing on the links between the physical\nconditions of the environment and the rotational properties of young stars. In\nparticular, we look at the physical conditions that allow the production of\nmassive stars by accretion. We present PMS models computed with a new version\nof the Geneva Stellar Evolution code self-consistently including accretion and\nrotation according to various accretion scenarios for mass and angular\nmomentum. We describe the internal distribution of angular momentum in PMS\nstars accreting at high rates and we show how the various physical conditions\nimpact their internal structures, evolutionary tracks, and rotation velocities\nduring the PMS and the early main sequence. We find that the smooth angular\nmomentum accretion considered in previous studies leads to an angular momentum\nbarrier and does not allow the formation of massive stars by accretion. A\nbraking mechanism is needed in order to circumvent this angular momentum\nbarrier. This mechanism has to be efficient enough to remove more than 2/3 of\nthe angular momentum from the inner accretion disc. Due to the weak efficiency\nof angular momentum transport by shear instability and meridional circulation\nduring the accretion phase, the internal rotation profiles of accreting stars\nreflect essentially the angular momentum accretion history. As a consequence,\ncareful choice of the angular momentum accretion history allows circumvention\nof any limitation in mass and velocity, and production of stars of any mass and\nvelocity compatible with structure equations.\n", "  The $\\sigma$ Orionis cluster is important for studying protoplanetary disk\nevolution, as its intermediate age ($\\sim$3-5 Myr) is comparable to the median\ndisk lifetime. We use ALMA to conduct a high-sensitivity survey of dust and gas\nin 92 protoplanetary disks around $\\sigma$ Orionis members with\n$M_{\\ast}\\gtrsim0.1 M_{\\odot}$. Our observations cover the 1.33 mm continuum\nand several CO $J=2-1$ lines: out of 92 sources, we detect 37 in the mm\ncontinuum and six in $^{12}$CO, three in $^{13}$CO, and none in C$^{18}$O.\nUsing the continuum emission to estimate dust mass, we find only 11 disks with\n$M_{\\rm dust}\\gtrsim10 M_{\\oplus}$, indicating that after only a few Myr of\nevolution most disks lack sufficient dust to form giant planet cores. Stacking\nthe individually undetected continuum sources limits their average dust mass to\n5$\\times$ lower than that of the faintest detected disk, supporting theoretical\nmodels that indicate rapid dissipation once disk clearing begins. Comparing the\nprotoplanetary disk population in $\\sigma$ Orionis to those of other\nstar-forming regions supports the steady decline in average dust mass and the\nsteepening of the $M_{\\rm dust}$-$M_{\\ast}$ relation with age; studying these\nevolutionary trends can inform the relative importance of different disk\nprocesses during key eras of planet formation. External photoevaporation from\nthe central O9 star is influencing disk evolution throughout the region: dust\nmasses clearly decline with decreasing separation from the photoionizing\nsource, and the handful of CO detections exist at projected separations $>1.5$\npc. Collectively, our findings indicate that giant planet formation is\ninherently rare and/or well underway by a few Myr of age.\n", "  We report generation of high harmonics in a gas-jet pumped by pulses\nself-compressed in a He-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber through the\nsoliton effect. The gas-jet is placed directly at the fiber output. As the\nenergy increases the ionization-induced soliton blue-shift is transferred to\nthe high harmonics, leading to a emission bands that are continuously tunable\nfrom 17 to 45 eV.\n", "  To shed light on the time evolution of local star formation episodes in M33,\nwe study the association between 566 Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), identified\nthrough the CO (J=2-1) IRAM-all-disk survey, and 630 Young Stellar Cluster\nCandidates (YSCCs), selected via Spitzer-24~$\\mu$m emission. The spatial\ncorrelation between YSCCs and GMCs is extremely strong, with a typical\nseparation of 17~pc, less than half the CO(2--1) beamsize, illustrating the\nremarkable physical link between the two populations. GMCs and YSCCs follow the\nHI filaments, except in the outermost regions where the survey finds fewer GMCs\nthan YSCCs, likely due to undetected, low CO-luminosity clouds. The GMCs have\nmasses between 2$\\times 10^4$ and 2$\\times 10^6$ M$_\\odot$ and are classified\naccording to different cloud evolutionary stages: inactive clouds are 32$\\%$ of\nthe total, classified clouds with embedded and exposed star formation are\n16$\\%$ and 52$\\%$ of the total respectively. Across the regular southern spiral\narm, inactive clouds are preferentially located in the inner part of the arm,\npossibly suggesting a triggering of star formation as the cloud crosses the\narm. Some YSCCs are embedded star-forming sites while the majority have\nGALEX-UV and H$\\alpha$ counterparts with estimated cluster masses and ages. The\ndistribution of the non-embedded YSCC ages peaks around 5~Myrs with only a few\nbeing as old as 8--10~Myrs. These age estimates together with the number of\nGMCs in the various evolutionary stages lead us to conclude that 14~Myrs is a\ntypical lifetime of a GMC in M33, prior to cloud dispersal. The inactive and\nembedded phases are short, lasting about 4 and 2~Myrs respectively. This\nunderlines that embedded YSCCs rapidly break out from the clouds and become\npartially visible in H$\\alpha$ or UV long before cloud dispersal.\n", "  We have studied the critical properties of the contact process on a square\nlattice with quenched site dilution by Monte Carlo simulations. This was\nachieved by generating in advance the percolating cluster, through the use of\nan appropriate epidemic model, and then by the simulation of the contact\nprocess on the top of the percolating cluster. The dynamic critical exponents\nwere calculated by assuming an activated scaling relation and the static\nexponents by the usual power law behavior. Our results are in agreement with\nthe prediction that the quenched diluted contact process belongs to the\nuniversality class of the random transverse-field Ising model. We have also\nanalyzed the model and determined the phase diagram by the use of a mean-field\ntheory that takes into account the correlation between neighboring sites.\n", "  In this {\\it Letter} we calculate the fraction of highly eccentric binary\nblack hole (BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions. Using an\n$N$-body code that includes post-Newtonian correction terms, we show that\n$\\gtrsim 1\\%$ of all BBH mergers resulting from this channel will have an\neccentricity $e>0.1$ when coming into the LIGO frequency band. As the majority\nof BBH mergers forming in globular clusters are assembled through three-body\nencounters, we suggest that such interactions are likely to dominate the\npopulation of high eccentricity BBH mergers detectable by LIGO. The relative\nfrequency of highly eccentric events could eventually help to constrain the\nastrophysical origin of BBH mergers.\n", "  $First-principles$ density functional theory computations of electronic\nstructure and local magnetic properties of the non-fluctuating ground state of\nNi$_x$Pd$_{1-x}$ alloy system around its quantum critical point $x_c = 0.026$\nhave been performed. The density of states at the Fermi energy and certain\nother parameters characterizing the Ni 3$d$ - Pd 4$d$ hybridization apparently\nfollow power-laws with $x$ similar to that obeyed by the reported ferromagnetic\nto paramagnetic transition temperature. The width of Pd $4d$ density of states\n(DOS) and centroid of Ni 3$d$ DOS show peak-like anomalies in the neighbourhood\nof $x_c$, and so indicate a possible scenario of the existence of a definite\nrelation between the orbital hybridization and the emergence of quantum\nfluctuations in the system.\n", "  Magic Sand, a hydrophobic toy granular material, is widely used in popular\nscience instructions because of its non-intuitive mechanical properties. A\ndetailed study of the failure of an underwater column of magic sand shows that\nthese properties can be traced to a single phenomenon: the system\nself-generates a cohesive skin that encapsulates the material inside. The skin,\nconsists of pinned air-water-grain interfaces, shows multi-scale mechanical\nproperties: they range from contact-line dynamics in the intra-grain roughness\nscale, plastic flow at the grain scale, all the way to the sample-scale\nmechanical responses. With decreasing rigidity of the skin, the failure mode\ntransforms from brittle to ductile (both of which are collective in nature) to\na complete disintegration at the single grain scale.\n", "  Since the mid-1920s, different strands of research used stars as \"physics\nlaboratories\" for investigating the nature of matter under extreme densities\nand pressures, impossible to realize on Earth. To trace this process this paper\nis following the evolution of the concept of a dense core in stars, which was\nimportant both for an understanding of stellar evolution and as a testing\nground for the fast-evolving field of nuclear physics. In spite of the divide\nbetween physicists and astrophysicists, some key actors working in the\ncross-fertilized soil of overlapping but different scientific cultures\nformulated models and tentative theories that gradually evolved into more\nrealistic and structured astrophysical objects. These investigations culminated\nin the first contact with general relativity in 1939, when J. Robert\nOppenheimer and his students George Volkoff and Hartland Snyder systematically\napplied the theory to the dense core of a collapsing neutron star. This\npioneering application of Einstein's theory to an astrophysical compact object\ncan be regarded as a milestone in the path eventually leading to the emergence\nof relativistic astrophysics in the early 1960s.\n", "  A microscopic configuration-interaction (CI) methodology is introduced to\nenable bottom-up Schroedinger-equation emulation of unconventional\nsuperconductivity in ultracold optical traps. We illustrate the method by\nexploring the properties of Lithium-6 atoms in a single square plaquette in the\nhole-pairing regime, and by analyzing the entanglement (symmetry-preserving)\nand disentanglement physics (via symmetry-breaking, associated with the\nseparation of charge and spin density waves) of two coupled plaquettes in the\nsame regime. The single-occupancy RVB states contribute only partially to the\nexact many-body solutions, and the CI results map onto a Hubbard Hamiltonian,\nbut not onto the double-occupancy-excluding t-J one. For the double-plaquette\ncase, effects brought about by breaking the symmetry between two\nweakly-interacting plaquettes, either by distorting, or by tilting and\ndetuning, one of the plaquettes with respect to the other, as well as spectral\nchanges caused by increased coupling between the two plaquettes, are explored.\n", "  Sub-subgiants are stars observed to be redder than normal main-sequence stars\nand fainter than normal subgiant (and giant) stars in an optical\ncolor-magnitude diagram. The red straggler stars, which lie redward of the red\ngiant branch, may be related and are often grouped together with the\nsub-subgiants in the literature. These stars defy our standard theory of\nsingle-star evolution, and are important tests for binary evolution and stellar\ncollision models. In total, we identify 65 sub-subgiants and red stragglers in\n16 open and globular star clusters from the literature; 50 of these, including\n43 sub-subgiants, pass our strict membership selection criteria (though the\nremaining sources may also be cluster members). In addition to their unique\nlocation on the color-magnitude diagram, we find that at least 58% (25/43) of\nsub-subgiants in this sample are X-ray sources with typical 0.5-2.5 keV\nluminosities of order 10^30 - 10^31 erg/s. Their X-ray luminosities and\noptical-to-X-ray flux ratios are similar to those of RS CVn active binaries. At\nleast 65% (28/43) of the sub-subgiants in our sample are variables, 21 of which\nare known to be radial-velocity binaries. Typical variability periods are <15\ndays. At least 33% (14/43) of the sub-subgiants are H-alpha emitters. These\nobservational demographics provide strong evidence that binarity is important\nfor sub-subgiant formation. Finally, we find that the number of sub-subgiants\nper unit mass increases toward lower-mass clusters, such that the open clusters\nin our sample have the highest specific frequencies of sub-subgiants.\n", "  We present near-infrared and optical spectroscopic observations of a sample\nof 450$\\mu$m and 850$\\mu$m-selected dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs)\nidentified in a 400 arcmin$^2$ area in the COSMOS field. Thirty-one sources of\nthe 102 targets were spectroscopically confirmed at $0.2<z<4$, identified\nprimarily in the near-infrared with Keck MOSFIRE and some in the optical with\nKeck LRIS and DEIMOS. The low rate of confirmation is attributable both to high\nrest-frame optical obscuration in our targets and limited sensitivity to\ncertain redshift ranges. The high-quality photometric redshifts available in\nthe COSMOS field allow us to test the robustness of photometric redshifts for\nDSFGs. We find a subset (11/31$\\approx35$%) of DSFGs with inaccurate ($\\Delta\nz/(1+z)>0.2$) or non-existent photometric redshifts; these have very distinct\nspectral energy distributions from the remaining DSFGs, suggesting a decoupling\nof highly obscured and unobscured components. We present a composite rest-frame\n4300--7300\\AA\\ spectrum for DSFGs, and find evidence of 200$\\pm$30 km s$^{-1}$\ngas outflows. Nebular line emission for a sub-sample of our detections indicate\nthat hard ionizing radiation fields are ubiquitous in high-z DSFGs, even more\nso than typical mass or UV-selected high-z galaxies. We also confirm the\nextreme level of dust obscuration in DSFGs, measuring very high Balmer\ndecrements, and very high ratios of IR to UV and IR to H$\\alpha$ luminosities.\nThis work demonstrates the need to broaden the use of wide bandwidth technology\nin the millimeter to the spectroscopic confirmations of large samples of high-z\nDSFGs, as the difficulty in confirming such sources at optical/near-infrared\nwavelengths is exceedingly challenging given their obscuration.\n", "  Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) lie to the red of the main-sequence and fainter\nthan the red giant branch in cluster color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), a region\nnot easily populated by standard stellar evolution pathways. While there has\nbeen speculation on what mechanisms may create these unusual stars, no\nwell-developed theory exists to explain their origins. Here we discuss three\nhypotheses of SSG formation: (1) mass transfer in a binary system, (2)\nstripping of a subgiant's envelope, perhaps during a dynamical encounter, and\n(3) reduced luminosity due to magnetic fields that lower convective efficiency\nand produce large star spots. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we develop\nevolutionary tracks for each of these hypotheses, and compare the expected\nstellar and orbital properties of these models with six known SSGs in the two\nopen clusters M67 and NGC 6791. All three of these mechanisms can create stars\nor binary systems in the SSG CMD domain. We also calculate the frequency with\nwhich each of these mechanisms may create SSG systems, and find that the\nmagnetic field hypothesis is expected to create SSGs with the highest frequency\nin open clusters. Mass transfer and envelope stripping have lower expected\nformation frequencies, but may nevertheless create occasional SSGs in open\nclusters. They may also be important mechanisms to create SSGs in higher mass\nglobular clusters.\n", "  We consider a quantum analogue of black holes and white holes using\nBose-Einstein condensates. The model is described by the nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation with a 'stream flow' potential, that induces a spatial translation to\nstanding waves. We then mainly consider the dynamics of dark solitons in a\nblack hole or white hole flow analogue and their interactions with the event\nhorizon. A reduced equation describing the position of the dark solitons was\nobtained using variational method. Through numerical computations and\ncomparisons with the analytical approximation we show that solitons can pass\nthrough black hole horizons even though they will break up into several\nsolitons after the collision. In the interaction with a white hole horizon, we\nshow that solitons either pass through the horizon or will be destroyed by it.\n", "  Dielectronic recombination (DR) is the dominant mode of recombination in\nmagnetically confined fusion plasmas for intermediate to low-charged ions of W.\nComplete, final-state resolved partial isonuclear W DR rate coefficient data is\nrequired for detailed collisional-radiative modelling for such plasmas in\npreparation for the upcoming fusion experiment ITER. To realize this\nrequirement, we continue {\\it The Tungsten Project} by presenting our\ncalculations for tungsten ions W$^{55+}$ to W$^{38+}$. As per our prior\ncalculations for W$^{73+}$ to W$^{56+}$, we use the collision package {\\sc\nautostructure} to calculate partial and total DR rate coefficients for all\nrelevant core-excitations in intermediate coupling (IC) and configuration\naverage (CA) using $\\kappa$-averaged relativistic wavefunctions. Radiative\nrecombination (RR) rate coefficients are also calculated for the purpose of\nevaluating ionization fractions. Comparison of our DR rate coefficients for\nW$^{46+}$ with other authors yields agreement to within 7-19\\% at peak\nabundance verifying the reliability of our method. Comparison of partial DR\nrate coefficients calculated in IC and CA yield differences of a factor\n$\\sim{2}$ at peak abundance temperature, highlighting the importance of\nrelativistic configuration mixing. Large differences are observed between\nionization fractions calculated using our recombination rate coefficient data\nand that of P\\\"{u}tterich~\\etal [Plasma Phys. and Control. Fusion 50 085016,\n(2008)]. These differences are attributed to deficiencies in the average-atom\nmethod used by the former to calculate their data.\n", "  We demonstrate that in non-Abelian ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories\nthe NSVZ relation is valid for terms quartic in the Yukawa couplings\nindependently of the subtraction scheme if the renormalization group functions\nare defined in terms of the bare couplings and the theory is regularized by\nhigher covariant derivatives. The terms quartic in the Yukawa couplings appear\nin the three-loop $\\beta$-function and in the two-loop anomalous dimension of\nthe matter superfields. We have obtained that the three-loop contribution to\nthe $\\beta$-function quartic in the Yukawa couplings is given by an integral of\ndouble total derivatives. Consequently, one of the loop integrals can be taken\nand the three-loop contribution to the $\\beta$-function is reduced to the\ntwo-loop contribution to the anomalous dimension. The remaining loop integrals\nhave been calculated for the simplest form of the higher derivative\nregularizing term. Then we construct the renormalization group functions\ndefined in terms of the renormalized couplings. In the considered approximation\nthey do not satisfy the NSVZ relation for a general renormalization\nprescription. However, we verify that the recently proposed boundary conditions\ndefining the NSVZ scheme in the non-Abelian case really lead to the NSVZ\nrelation between the terms of the considered structure.\n", "  Sirius, the seventh-nearest stellar system, is a visual binary containing the\nmetallic-line A1 V star Sirius A, brightest star in the sky, orbited in a\n50.13-year period by Sirius B, the brightest and nearest white dwarf (WD).\nUsing images obtained over nearly two decades with the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST), along with photographic observations covering almost 20 years, and\nnearly 2300 historical measurements dating back to the 19th century, we\ndetermine precise orbital elements for the visual binary. Combined with the\nparallax and the motion of the A component, these elements yield dynamical\nmasses of 2.063+/-0.023 Msun and 1.018+/-0.011 Msun for Sirius A and B,\nrespectively. Our precise HST astrometry rules out third bodies orbiting either\nstar in the system, down to masses of ~15-25 Mjup. The location of Sirius B in\nthe H-R diagram is in excellent agreement with theoretical cooling tracks for\nWDs of its dynamical mass, and implies a cooling age of ~126 Myr. The position\nof Sirius B in the mass-radius plane is also consistent with WD theory,\nassuming a carbon-oxygen core. Including the pre-WD evolutionary timescale of\nthe assumed progenitor, the total age of Sirius B is about 228+/-10 Myr. We\ncalculated evolutionary tracks for stars with the dynamical mass of Sirius A,\nusing two independent codes. We find it necessary to assume a slightly\nsub-solar metallicity, of about 0.85 Zsun, to fit its location in the\nluminosity-radius plane. The age of Sirius A based on these models is about\n237-247 Myr, with uncertainties of +/-15 Myr, consistent with that of the WD\ncompanion. We discuss astrophysical puzzles presented by the Sirius system,\nincluding the probability that the two stars must have interacted in the past,\neven though there is no direct evidence for this, and the orbital eccentricity\nremains high.\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are one of the primary manifestations of solar\nactivity and can drive severe space weather effects. Therefore, it is vital to\nwork towards being able to predict their occurrence. However, many aspects of\nCME formation and eruption remain unclear, including whether magnetic flux\nropes are present before the onset of eruption and the key mechanisms that\ncause CMEs to occur. In this work, the pre-eruptive coronal configuration of an\nactive region that produced an interplanetary CME with a clear magnetic flux\nrope structure at 1 AU is studied. A forward-S sigmoid appears in\nextreme-ultraviolet (EUV) data two hours before the onset of the eruption\n(SOL2012-06-14), which is interpreted as a signature of a right-handed flux\nrope that formed prior to the eruption. Flare ribbons and EUV dimmings are used\nto infer the locations of the flux rope footpoints. These locations, together\nwith observations of the global magnetic flux distribution, indicate that an\ninteraction between newly emerged magnetic flux and pre-existing sunspot field\nin the days prior to the eruption may have enabled the coronal flux rope to\nform via tether-cutting-like reconnection. Composition analysis suggests that\nthe flux rope had a coronal plasma composition, supporting our interpretation\nthat the flux rope formed via magnetic reconnection in the corona. Once formed,\nthe flux rope remained stable for 2 hours before erupting as a CME.\n", "  In nearly AdS2 gravity the Einstein-Hilbert term is supplemented by the\nJackiw-Teitelboim action. Integrating out the bulk metric gives rise to the\nSchwarzian action for the boundary curve. In the present note, we show how the\nextension to supergravity leads to the super-Schwarzian action for the\nsuperspace boundary.\n", "  Green light (2$\\omega$) has the potential to drive ignition target for laser\nfusion with significantly more energy than blue light (3$\\omega$) and a\nrelatively higher damage threshold for the optic components in the final optic\nassembly, but it has issues of a relatively low laser to x-ray conversion\nefficiency and a hard x-ray spectrum as compared to 3$\\omega$. In this paper,\nwe propose to drive a foam hohlraum wall with an ignition laser pulse by taking\na 4$\\omega$ laser at the pre-pulse and a 2$\\omega$ laser at the main-pulse,\ncalled as 4$\\omega$ - 2$\\omega$ ignition pulse. This novel design has the\nfollowing advantages: (1) benefiting from 2$\\omega$ of its relatively high\nenergy output and low damage threshold during main-pulse, (2) benefiting from\nfoam in its relatively high laser to x-ray conversion efficiency and relatively\nlow M-band fraction in re-emission, (3) benefiting from 4$\\omega$ of its low\nLPI during pre-pulse. From our 1D simulations with Au material, the laser to\nx-ray conversion in a foam driven by 4$\\omega$ - 2$\\omega$ pulse has an\nincrease of $28\\%$ as compared to a solid target driven by 3$\\omega$ with the\nsame pulse shape. The relatively thin optical depth of foam is one of the main\nreasons for the increase of laser to x-ray conversion efficiency inside a foam\ntarget.\n", "  The phonon-drag thermopower is studied in monolayer graphene on a\npiezoelectric substrate. The phonon-drag contribution S^g_PA from the extrinsic\npotential of piezoelectric surface acoustic (PA) phonons of a piezoelectric\nsubstrate (GaAs) is calculated as a function of temperature T and electron\nconcentration n_s. At very low temperature, S^g_PA is found to be much greater\nthan S^g_DA of the intrinsic deformation potential of acoustic (DA) phonons of\nthe graphene. There is a crossover of S^g_PA and S^g_DA at around ~5 K. In\ngraphene samples of about >10 um size, we predict S_g ~20 uV at 10 K, which is\nmuch greater than the diffusion component of the thermopower and can be\nexperimentally observed. In the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) regime T and n_s\ndependence are, respectively, given by the power laws S^g_PA (S^g_DA) ~\nT^2(T^3) and S^g_PA, S^g_DA ~ n_s^(-1/2). The T (n_s) dependence is the\nmanifestation of the two-dimensional phonons (Dirac phase of the electrons).\nThe effect of the screening is discussed. Analogous to Herring's law (S_g mu_p\n~T^-1), we predict a new relation S_g mu_p ~n_s^0, where mu_p is the\nphonon-limited mobility. We suggest that n_s dependent measurements will play a\nmore significant role in identifying the Dirac phase and the effect of\nscreening.\n", "  Using effective field theory techniques, we compute quantum corrections to\nspherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's gravity and focus in particular\non the Schwarzschild black hole. Quantum modifications are covariantly encoded\nin a non-local effective action. We work to quadratic order in curvatures\nsimultaneously taking local and non-local corrections into account. Looking for\nsolutions perturbatively close to that of classical general relativity, we find\nthat an eternal Schwarzschild black hole remains a solution and receives no\nquantum corrections up to this order in the curvature expansion. In contrast,\nthe field of a massive star receives corrections which are fully determined by\nthe effective field theory.\n", "  Aims: A previous study claimed that the star HIP 21539 passed close to the\nSun, at a distance of 1.9 pc, around 0.14 Myr ago. We show that this is not the\ncase. Methods: We redetermined the trajectory of the star relative to the Sun\nusing a new accurate radial velocity from the HARPS spectrograph combined with\nthe recent Gaia-TGAS astrometry. Results: With this new data, the closest\napproach of HIP 21539 to the Sun is now 17 pc, instead of 1.9 pc. Conclusions:\nAt this distance, the star has not perturbed the Oort cloud.\n", "  Rashba spin splitting in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor systems is\ngenerally calculated in a ${\\bf k} \\cdot {\\bf p}$ Luttinger-Kohn approach where\nthe spin splitting due to asymmetry emerges naturally from the bulk band\nstructure. In recent years, several new classes of 2D systems have been\ndiscovered where electronic correlations are believed to have an important\nrole. In these correlated systems, the effects of asymmetry leading to Rashba\nsplitting have typically been treated phenomenologically. We compare these two\napproaches for the case of 2D electron systems in SrTiO$_3$-based\nheterostructures, and find that the two models produce fundamentally different\nbehavior in regions of the Brillouin zone that are particularly relevant for\nmagnetotransport. Our results demonstrate the importance of identifying the\ncorrect approach in the quantitative interpretation of experimental data, and\nare likely to be relevant to a range of 2D systems in correlated materials.\n", "  Precise helicity-dependent cross sections and the double-polarization\nobservable $E$ were measured for $\\eta$ photoproduction from quasi-free protons\nand neutrons bound in the deuteron. The $\\eta\\rightarrow 2\\gamma$ and\n$\\eta\\rightarrow 3\\pi^0\\rightarrow 6\\gamma$ decay modes were used to optimize\nthe statistical quality of the data and to estimate systematic uncertainties.\nThe measurement used the A2 detector setup at the tagged photon beam of the\nelectron accelerator MAMI in Mainz. A longitudinally polarized deuterated\nbutanol target was used in combination with a circularly polarized photon beam\nfrom bremsstrahlung of a longitudinally polarized electron beam. The reaction\nproducts were detected with the electromagnetic calorimeters Crystal Ball and\nTAPS, which covered 98\\% of the full solid angle. The results show that the\nnarrow structure observed earlier in the unpolarized excitation function of\n$\\eta$ photoproduction off the neutron appears only in reactions with\nantiparallel photon and nucleon spin ($\\sigma_{1/2}$). It is absent for\nreactions with parallel spin orientation ($\\sigma_{3/2}$) and thus very\nprobably related to partial waves with total spin 1/2. The behavior of the\nangular distributions of the helicity-dependent cross sections was analyzed by\nfitting them with Legendre polynomials. The results are in good agreement with\na model from the Bonn-Gatchina group, which uses an interference of $P_{11}$\nand $S_{11}$ partial waves to explain the narrow structure.\n", "  We identify [Se III] 1.0994 micron in the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 5315 and\n[Kr VI] 1.2330 micron in three PNe, from spectra obtained with the FIRE\nspectrometer on the 6.5-m Baade Telescope. Se and Kr are the two most\nwidely-detected neutron-capture elements in astrophysical nebulae, and can be\nenriched by s-process nucleosynthesis in PN progenitor stars. The detection of\n[Se III] 1.0994 micron is particularly valuable when paired with observations\nof [Se IV] 2.2858 micron, as it can be used to improve the accuracy of nebular\nSe abundance determinations, and allows Se ionization correction factor (ICF)\nschemes to be empirically tested for the first time. We present new effective\ncollision strength calculations for Se^{2+} and Kr^{5+}, which we use to\ncompute ionic abundances. In NGC 5315, we find that the Se abundance computed\nfrom Se^{3+}/H^+ is lower than that determined with ICFs that incorporate\nSe^{2+}/H^+. We compute new Kr ICFs that take Kr^{5+}/H^+ into account, by\nfitting correlations found in grids of Cloudy models between Kr ionic fractions\nand those of more abundant elements, and use these to derive Kr abundances in\nfour PNe. Observations of [Se III] and [Kr VI] in a larger sample of PNe, with\na range of excitation levels, are needed to rigorously test the ICF\nprescriptions for Se and our new Kr ICFs.\n", "  Time-series, multi-color photometry and high-resolution spectra of the short\nperiod eclipsing binary V Tri were obtained by observations. The completely\ncovered light and radial velocity curves of the binary system are presented.\nAll times of light minima derived from both photoelectric and CCD photometry\nwere used to calculate the orbital period and new ephemerides of the eclipsing\nsystem. The analysis of $O-C$ diagram reveals that the orbital period is\n$0.58520481\\ days$, decreasing at a rate of $dP/dt=-7.80\\times10^{-8} d\\\nyr^{-1} $. The mass transfer between the two components and the light\ntime-travel effect due to a third body could be used to explain the period\ndecrease. However, a semidetached configuration with the less-mass component\nfilling and the primary nearly filling each of their Roche lobes was derived\nfrom the synthesis of the light and radial velocity curves by using the 2015\nversion of the Wilson-Devinney code. We consider the period decrease to be the\nnonconservative mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary and\nthe mass loss of the system, which was thought to be an EB type while it should\nbe an EA type (semi-detached Algol-type) from our study. The masses, radii and\nluminosities of the primary and secondary are $1.60\\pm0.07 M_\\odot$,\n$1.64\\pm0.02 R_\\odot$, $14.14\\pm0.73 L_\\odot$ and $0.74\\pm0.02 M_\\odot$,\n$1.23\\pm0.02 R_\\odot$, $1.65\\pm0.05 L_\\odot$, respectively.\n", "  With a counter-diabatic field supplemented to the reference control field,\nthe `shortcut to adiabaticiy' (STA) protocol is implemented in a\nsuperconducting phase qubit. The Berry phase measured in a short time scale is\nin good agreement with the theoretical result acquired from an adiabatic loop.\nThe trajectory of a qubit vector is extracted, verifying the Berry phase\nalternatively by the integrated solid angle. The classical noise is introduced\nto the amplitude or phase of the total control field. In the statistics of the\nBerry phase, the mean with either noise is almost equal to that without noise,\nwhile the variation with the amplitude noise can be described by an analytical\nexpression.\n", "  An integrated system of hardware and software allowing precise definition of\narbitrarily oriented magnetic fields up to |B| = 1 {\\mu}T within a five-layer\nmumetal shield is described. The system is calibrated with reference to\nmagnetic resonance observed between Zeeman states of the 6S$_{1/2}$ F = 4\n$^{133}$Cs ground state. Magnetic field definition over the full 4{\\pi} solid\nangle is demonstrated, with one-sigma tolerances in magnitude, orientation and\ngradient of {\\delta}|B| = 0.94 nT, {\\delta}{\\theta} = 5.9 mrad and\n{\\delta}$\\nabla$ B = 13.0 pT/mm, respectively. This field control is used to\nempirically map Mx magnetometer signal amplitude as a function of the static\nfield (B0) orientation.\n", "  We theoretically present an economical and convenient way to study\nground-state properties of a strongly interacting superfluid Fermi gas. Our\nstrategy is that complicated strong-coupling calculations are used only to\nevaluate quantum fluctuation corrections to the chemical potential $\\mu$. Then,\nwithout any further strong-coupling calculations, we calculate the\ncompressibility, sound velocity, internal energy, pressure, and Tan's contact,\nfrom the calculated $\\mu$ without loss of accuracy, by using exact\nthermodynamic identities. Using a recent precise measurement of $\\mu$ in a\nsuperfluid $^6$Li Fermi gas, we show that an extended $T$-matrix approximation\n(ETMA) is suitable for our purpose, especially in the BCS-unitary regime, where\nour results indicate that many-body corrections are dominated by superfluid\nfluctuations. Since precise determinations of physical quantities are not\nalways easy in cold Fermi gas physics, our approach would greatly reduce\nexperimental and theoretical efforts toward the understanding of ground-state\nproperties of this strongly interacting Fermi system.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional trapped gas of strongly interacting few spin-1\natoms which can be described by an effective spin chain Hamiltonian. Away from\nthe SU(3) integrable point, where the energy spectrum is highly degenerate, the\nrules of ordering and crossing of the energy levels and the symmetry of the\neigenstates in the regime of large but finite repulsion have been elucidated.\nWe study the spin-mixing dynamics which is shown to be very sensitive to the\nratio between the two channel interactions g0/g2 and the effective spin chain\ntransfers the quantum states more perfectly than the Heisenberg\nbilinear-biquadratic spin chain.\n", "  Quantification of the radial transport of gaseous species and solid particles\nis important to many applications in protoplanetary disk evolution. An\nespecially important example is determining the location of the water snow\nlines in a disk, which requires computing the rates of outward radial diffusion\nof water vapor and the inward radial drift of icy particles; however, the\napplication is generalized to evaporation fronts of all volatiles. We review\nthe relevant formulas using a uniform formalism. This uniform treatment is\nnecessary because the literature currently contains at least six mutually\nexclusive treatments of radial diffusion of gas, only one of which is correct.\nWe derive the radial diffusion equations from first principles, using Fick's\nlaw. For completeness, we also present the equations for radial transport of\nparticles. These equations may be applied to studies of diffusion of gases and\nparticles in protoplanetary and other accretion disks.\n", "  By applying a display ecology to the {\\em Deeper, Wider, Faster} proactive,\nsimultaneous telescope observing campaign, we have shown a dramatic reduction\nin the time taken to inspect DECam CCD images for potential transient\ncandidates and to produce time-critical triggers to standby telescopes. We also\nshow how facilitating rapid corroboration of potential candidates and the\nexclusion of non-candidates improves the accuracy of detection; and establish\nthat a practical and enjoyable workspace can improve the experience of an\notherwise taxing task for astronomers. We provide a critical road-test of two\nadvanced displays in a research context -- a rare opportunity to demonstrate\nhow they can be used rather than simply discuss how they might be used to\naccelerate discovery.\n", "  We investigate the elastic buckling of a triangular prism made of a soft\nelastomer. A face of the prism is bonded to a stiff slab that imposes an\naverage axial compression. We observe two possible buckling modes which are\nlocalized along the free ridge. For ridge angles $\\phi$ below a critical value\n$\\phi^\\star\\approx 90^\\circ$ experiments reveal an extended sinusoidal mode,\nwhile for $\\phi$ above $\\phi^\\star$ we observe a series of creases\nprogressively invading the lateral faces starting from the ridge. A numerical\nlinear stability analysis is set up using the finite-element method and\ncorrectly predicts the sinusoidal mode for $\\phi \\leq \\phi^\\star$, as well as\nthe associated critical strain $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\phi)$. The experimental\ntransition at $\\phi^\\star$ is found to occur when this critical strain\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\phi)$ attains the value\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\phi^\\star) = 0.44$ corresponding to the threshold of\nthe sub-critical surface creasing instability. Previous analyses have focused\non elastic crease patterns appearing on planar surfaces, where the role of\nscale-invariance has been emphasized; our analysis of the elastic ridge\nprovides a different perspective, and reveals that scale-invariance is not a\nsufficient condition for localization.\n", "  It is commonly believed that patterns of social ties affect individuals'\neconomic status. Here, we translate this concept into an operational definition\nat the network level, which allows us to infer the economic wellbeing of\nindividuals through a measure of their location and influence in the social\nnetwork. We analyze two large-scale sources: telecommunications and financial\ndata of a whole country's population. Our results show that an individual's\nlocation, measured as the optimal collective influence to the structural\nintegrity of the social network, is highly correlated with personal economic\nstatus. The observed social network patterns of influence mimics the patterns\nof economic inequality. For pragmatic use and validation, we carry out a\nmarketing campaign that shows a three-fold increase in response rate by\ntargeting individuals identified by our social network metrics as compared to\nrandom targeting. Our strategy can also be useful in maximizing the effects of\nlarge-scale economic stimulus policies.\n", "  In this paper, we construct a special kind of breather solution of the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation, the so-called breather-positon ({\\it\nb-positon} for short), which can be obtained by taking the limit $\\lambda_{j}$\n$\\rightarrow$ $\\lambda_{1}$ of the Lax pair eigenvalues in the order-$n$\nperiodic solution which is generated by the $n$-fold Darboux transformation\nfrom a special \"seed\" solution--plane wave. Further, an order-$n$ {\\it\nb-positon} gives an order-$n$ rogue wave under a limit $\\lambda_1\\rightarrow\n\\lambda_0$. Here $\\lambda_0$ is a special eigenvalue in a breather of the NLS\nequation such that its period goes to infinity. Several analytical plots of\norder-2 breather confirm visually this double degeneration. The last limit in\nthis double degeneration can be realized approximately in an optical fiber\ngoverned by the NLS equation, in which an injected initial ideal pulse is\ncreated by a frequency comb system and a programable optical filter (wave\nshaper) according to the profile of an analytical form of the {\\it b-positon}\nat a certain position $z_0$. We also suggest a new way to observe higher-order\nrogue waves generation in an optical fiber, namely, measure the patterns at the\ncentral region of the higher-order {\\it b-positon} generated by above ideal\ninitial pulses when $\\lambda_1$ is very close to the $\\lambda_0$. The excellent\nagreement between the numerical solutions generated from initial ideal inputs\nwith a low signal noise ratio and analytical solutions of order-2 {\\it\nb-positon}, supports strongly this way in a realistic optical fiber system. Our\nresults also show the validity of the generating mechanism of a higher-order\nrogue waves from a multi-breathers through the double degeneration.\n", "  We study influence of image forces on conductance of ferroelectric tunnel\njunctions. We show that the influence of image forces is twofold: i) they\nenhance the electro-resistance effect due to polarization hysteresis in\nsymmetric tunnel junctions at non-zero bias and ii) they produce the\nelectro-resistance effect due to hysteresis of dielectric permittivity of\nferroelectric barrier. We study dependence of ferroelectric tunnel junction\nconductance on temperature and show that image forces lead to strong\nconductance variation with temperature.\n", "  The even-Z odd-N neutron-halo nuclei, which are the possible lightest\nneutron-halo nuclei heavier than $^{37}$Mg, are explored by studying the\nshell-structure unique in weakly-bound neutrons for spherical or deformed\nshape. It is pointed out that due to the narrowed N=50 spherical energy-gap and\na few resulting close-lying neutron one-particle levels, 1g$_{9/2}$,\n3s$_{1/2}$, and 2d$_{5/2}$, for spherical shape, nuclei with some weakly-bound\nneutrons filling in those levels may be deformed and have a good chance to show\ndeformed s-wave halo. Promising candidates are $^{71}_{24}$Cr$_{47}$,\n$^{73}_{24}$Cr$_{49}$, $^{75}_{24}$Cr$_{51}$ and $^{77}_{26}$Fe$_{51}$ in the\ncase that those nuclei lie inside the neutron drip-line. An interesting\npossibility of the deformed p-wave or s-wave halo is suggested also for the\nnucleus $^{53}_{18}$Ar$_{35}$.\n", "  Current models predict the hose instability to crucially limit the\napplicability of plasma-wakefield accelerators. By developing an analytical\nmodel which incorporates the evolution of the hose instability over long\npropagation distances, this work demonstrates that the inherent drive-beam\nenergy loss, along with an initial beam energy spread detune the betatron\noscillations of beam electrons, and thereby mitigate the instability. It is\nalso shown that tapered plasma profiles can strongly reduce initial hosing\nseeds. Hence, we demonstrate that the propagation of a drive beam can be\nstabilized over long propagation distances, paving the way for the acceleration\nof high-quality electron beams in plasma-wakefield accelerators. We find\nexcellent agreement between our models and particle-in-cell simulations.\n", "  There is a growing evidence that due to quantum gravity effects the effective\nspacetime dimensionality might change in the UV. In this letter we investigate\nthis hypothesis by using quantum fields to derive the UV behaviour of the\nstatic, two point sources potential. We mimic quantum gravity effects by using\nnon-commutative fields associated to a Lie group momentum space with a Planck\nmass curvature scale. We find that the static potential becomes finite in the\nshort-distance limit. This indicates that quantum gravity effects lead to a\ndimensional reduction in the UV or, alternatively, that point-like sources are\neffectively smoothed out by the Planck scale features of the non-commutative\nquantum fields.\n", "  The morphological properties of large scale structure of the Universe can be\nfully described by four Minkowski functionals (MFs), which provide important\ncomplementary information to other statistical observables such as the widely\nused 2-point statistics in configuration and Fourier spaces. In this work, for\nthe first time, we present the differences in the morphology of large scale\nstructure caused by modifications to general relativity (to address the cosmic\nacceleration problem), by measuring the MFs from N-body simulations of modified\ngravity and general relativity. We find strong statistical power when using the\nMFs to constrain modified theories of gravity: with a galaxy survey that has\nsurvey volume $\\sim 0.125 (h^{-1}$Gpc$)^3$ and galaxy number density $\\sim 1 /\n(h^{-1}$Mpc$)^{3}$, the two normal-branch DGP models and the F5 $f(R)$ model\nthat we simulated can be discriminated from $\\Lambda$CDM at a significance\nlevel >~ 5$\\sigma$ with an individual MF measurement. Therefore, the MF of\nlarge scale structure is potentially a powerful probe of gravity, and its\napplication to real data deserves active explorations.\n", "  A generalized version for the Rastall theory is proposed showing the\nagreement with the cosmic accelerating expansion. In this regard, a coupling\nbetween geometry and the pressureless matter fields is derived which may play\nthe role of dark energy responsible for the current accelerating expansion\nphase. Moreover, our study also shows that the radiation field may not be\ncoupled to the geometry in a non-minimal way which represents that the ordinary\nenergy-momentum conservation law is respected by the radiation source. It is\nalso shown that the primary inflationary era may be justified by the ability of\nthe geometry to couple to the energy-momentum source in an empty flat FRW\nuniverse. In fact, this ability is independent of the existence of the\nenergy-momentum source and may compel the empty flat FRW universe to expand\nexponentially. Finally, we consider a flat FRW universe field by a spatially\nhomogeneous scalar field evolving in potential $\\mathcal{V}(\\phi)$, and study\nthe results of applying the slow-roll approximation to the system which may\nlead to an inflationary phase for the universe expansion.\n", "  We report on the detection of the ground-state rotational line of ortho-D2H+\nat 1.477 THz (203 micron) using the German REceiver for Astronomy at Terahertz\nfrequencies (GREAT) onboard the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared\nAstronomy (SOFIA). The line is seen in absorption against far-infrared\ncontinuum from the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 in Ophiuchus. The\npara-D2H+ line at 691.7 GHz was not detected with the APEX telescope toward\nthis position. These D2H+ observations complement our previous detections of\npara-H2D+ and ortho-H2D+ using SOFIA and APEX. By modeling chemistry and\nradiative transfer in the dense core surrounding the protostars, we find that\nthe ortho-D2H+ and para-H2D+ absorption features mainly originate in the cool\n(T<18 K) outer envelope of the core. In contrast, the ortho-H2D+ emission from\nthe core is significantly absorbed by the ambient molecular cloud. Analyses of\nthe combined D2H+ and H2D+ data result in an age estimate of ~500 000 yr for\nthe core, with an uncertainty of ~200 000 yr. The core material has probably\nbeen pre-processed for another 500 000 years in conditions corresponding to\nthose in the ambient molecular cloud. The inferred time scale is more than ten\ntimes the age of the embedded protobinary. The D2H+ and H2D+ ions have large\nand nearly equal total (ortho+para) fractional abundances of ~$10^{-9}$ in the\nouter envelope. This confirms the central role of H3+ in the deuterium\nchemistry in cool, dense gas, and adds support to the prediction of chemistry\nmodels that also D3+ should be abundant in these conditions.\n", "  We searched high resolution spectra of 5600 nearby stars for emission lines\nthat are both inconsistent with a natural origin and unresolved spatially, as\nwould be expected from extraterrestrial optical lasers. The spectra were\nobtained with the Keck 10-meter telescope, including light coming from within\n0.5 arcsec of the star, corresponding typically to within a few to tens of au\nof the star, and covering nearly the entire visible wavelength range from 3640\nto 7890 angstroms. We establish detection thresholds by injecting synthetic\nlaser emission lines into our spectra and blindly analyzing them for\ndetections. We compute flux density detection thresholds for all wavelengths\nand spectral types sampled. Our detection thresholds for the power of the\nlasers themselves range from 3 kW to 13 MW, independent of distance to the star\nbut dependent on the competing \"glare\" of the spectral energy distribution of\nthe star and on the wavelength of the laser light, launched from a benchmark,\ndiffraction-limited 10-meter class telescope. We found no such laser emission\ncoming from the planetary region around any of the 5600 stars. As they contain\nroughly 2000 lukewarm, Earth-size planets, we rule out models of the Milky Way\nin which over 0.1 percent of warm, Earth-size planets harbor technological\ncivilizations that, intentionally or not, are beaming optical lasers toward us.\nA next generation spectroscopic laser search will be done by the Breakthrough\nListen initiative, targeting more stars, especially stellar types overlooked\nhere including spectral types O, B, A, early F, late M, and brown dwarfs, and\nastrophysical exotica.\n", "  We study the four-body baryonic $B\\to {\\bf B_1 \\bar B_2}M_1 M_2$ decays with\n$\\bf B_{1,2}$ ($M_{1,2}$) being charmless baryons (mesons). In accordance with\nthe recent LHCb observations, each decay is considered to proceed through the\n$B\\to M_1 M_2$ transition together with the production of a baryon pair. We\nobtain that ${\\cal B}(B^-\\to \\Lambda\\bar p \\pi^+\\pi^-)=(3.7^{+1.5}_{-1.0}\n)\\times 10^{-6}$ and ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0\\to p\\bar p \\pi^+\\pi^-,p\\bar p \\pi^+\nK^-)=(3.0\\pm 0.9,6.6\\pm 2.4)\\times 10^{-6}$, in agreement with the data. We\nalso predict ${\\cal B}(B^-\\to\\Lambda\\bar p K^+ K^-)=(3.0^{+1.3}_{-0.9})\\times\n10^{-6}$, which is accessible to the LHCb and BELLE experiments.\n", "  The magnetization processes of the spin-3/2 antiferromagnet LiInCr4O8\ncomprising a \"breathing\" pyrochlore lattice, which is an alternating array of\nsmall and large tetrahedra, are studied under ultrahigh magnetic fields of up\nto 130 T using state-of-the-art pulsed magnets. A half magnetization plateau is\nobserved above 90 T to 130 T, suggesting that LiInCr4O8 has a strong\nspin-lattice coupling, similar to conventional chromium spinel oxides. The\nmagnetization of LiGa0.125In0.875Cr4O8, in which the structural and magnetic\ntransitions at low temperatures have been completely suppressed, shows a sudden\nincrease above 13 T, indicating that a spin gap of 2.2 meV exists between a\ntetramer singlet ground state and an excited state with total spin 1, with the\nlatter being stabilized by the application of a magnetic field. The breathing\npyrochlore antiferromagnet is found to be a unique frustrated system with\nstrong spin-lattice coupling and bond alternation.\n", "  TRAPPIST-1 is a late M-dwarf orbited by seven Earth-sized planets with\norbital period ratios near a chain of mean motion resonances. Due to uncertain\nsystem parameters, most orbital configurations drawn from the inferred\nposterior distribution are unstable on short timescales of $\\sim$ 0.5 Myr, even\nwhen including the eccentricity damping effect of tides. By contrast, we show\nthat most physically plausible resonant configurations generated through disk\nmigration are stable even without tidal dissipation on timescales of at least\n50 Myr ($10^{10}$ orbits), an increase of at least two orders of magnitude.\nThis result, together with the remarkable chain of period ratios in the system,\nprovide strong evidence for convergent migration naturally emplacing the system\nnear an equilibrium configuration forced by the resonant chain. We provide an\nopenly available database of physically plausible initial conditions for\nTRAPPIST-1 generated through parametrized planet-disk interactions, as well as\nbit-by-bit reproducible N-body integrations over $10^9-10^{10}$ orbits.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the morphological properties of the Crab\nNebula across the electromagnetic spectrum based on new and previous\nhigh-quality data from radio to X-rays. In the radio range we obtained an image\nof the entire nebula at 3 GHz with subarcsecond angular resolution using the\nVLA (NRAO) and an image at 100 GHz of the central region using the ALMA array.\nSimultaneously with the VLA observations we performed HST WFPC3 near infrared\nand Chandra X-ray observations of the central region of the nebula. In addition\nwe produced a new UV image of the Crab nebula at 291 nm by co-adding 75\nindividual exposures of the Optical-UV Monitor on board XMM-Newton. The\nhigh-angular resolution and high-dynamic range radio image at 3 GHz allowed us\nto improve the detection and characterization of peculiar morphological\nfeatures including arches with foot brightening and intercrossed loop-like\nstructures, likely originating in plasma confined to magnetic field lines.\nBased on the new radio image, we carried out a detailed multiwavelength\ncorrelation. In the central area, the comparison of the almost simultaneous\nimages confirms that the wisps in the three spectral ranges do not generally\ncoincide in location, the radio emission being the most discordant, which is\nsuggestive of the existence of two different synchrotron components. The X-ray\npulsar jet does not have a radio counterpart.\n  Instead, another jet-like feature is seen in radio, though with different\ncurvature and starting point.\n", "  In this letter, carrier transport in graded\nAl$\\mathrm{_x}$Ga$\\mathrm{_{1-x}}$N with a polarization-induced n-type doping\nas low as ~ 10$\\mathrm{^{17}}$ cm$\\mathrm{^{-3}}$ is reported. The graded\nAl$\\mathrm{_x}$Ga$\\mathrm{_{1-x}}$N is grown by metal organic chemical vapor\ndeposition on a sapphire substrate and a uniform n-type doping without any\nintentional doping is realized by linearly varying the Al composition from 0%\nto 20% over a thickness of 600 nm. A compensating center concentration of\n~10$\\mathrm{^{17}}$ cm$\\mathrm{^{-3}}$ was also estimated. A peak mobility of\n900 cm$\\mathrm{^2}$/V$\\mathrm \\cdot$s at room temperature is extracted at an Al\ncomposition of ~ 7%, which represents the highest mobility achieved in\nn-Al$\\mathrm{_{0.07}}$GaN with a carrier concentration ~10$\\mathrm{^{17}}$\ncm$\\mathrm{^{-3}}$. Comparison between experimental data and theoretical models\nshows that, at this low doping concentration, both dislocation scattering and\nalloy scattering are significant in limiting electron mobility; and that a\ndislocation density of <10$\\mathrm{^7}$ cm$\\mathrm{^{-2}}$ is necessary to\noptimize mobility near 10$\\mathrm{^{16}}$ cm$\\mathrm{^{-3}}$. The findings in\nthis study provide insight in key elements for achieving high mobility at low\ndoping levels in GaN, a critical parameter in design of novel power electronics\ntaking advantage of polarization doping.\n", "  We study different types of microswimmers moving in channels with varying\ncross section and thereby interacting hydrodynamically with the channel walls.\nStarting from the Smoluchowski equation for a dilute suspension, for which\ninteractions among swimmers can be neglected, we derive analytic expressions\nfor the lateral probability distribution between plane channel walls. For\nweakly corrugated channels we extend the Fick--Jacobs approach to microswimmers\nand thereby derive an effective equation for the probability distribution along\nthe channel axis. Two regimes arise dominated either by entropic forces due to\nthe geometrical confinement or by the active motion. In particular, our results\nshow that the accumulation of microswimmers at channel walls is sensitive to\nboth, the underlying swimming mechanism and the geometry of the channels.\nFinally, for asymmetric channel corrugation our model predicts a rectification\nof microswimmers along the channel, the strength and direction of which\nstrongly depends on the swimmer type.\n", "  We analyse a linear lattice Boltzmann (LB) formulation for simulation of\nlinear acoustic wave propagation in heterogeneous media. We employ the\nsingle-relaxation-time Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) as well as the general\nmulti-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operators. By calculating the dispersion\nrelation for various 2D lattices, we show that the D2Q5 lattice is the most\nsuitable model for the linear acoustic problem. We also implement a\ngrid-refinement algorithm for the LB scheme to simulate waves propagating in a\nheterogeneous medium with velocity contrasts. Our results show that the LB\nscheme performance is comparable to the classical second-order\nfinite-difference schemes. Given its efficiency for parallel computation, the\nLB method can be a cost effective tool for the simulation of linear acoustic\nwaves in complex geometries and multiphase media.\n", "  Abridged: We used the fourth internal data release of the Gaia-ESO survey to\ncharacterize the bulge chemistry, spatial distribution, kinematics, and to\ncompare it chemically with the thin and thick disks. The sample consist on\n~2500 red clump stars in 11 bulge fields ($-10^\\circ\\leq l\\leq+8^\\circ$ and\n$-10^\\circ\\leq b\\leq-4^\\circ$), and a set of ~6300 disk stars selected for\ncomparison. The bulge MDF is confirmed to be bimodal across the whole sampled\narea, with metal-poor stars dominating at high latitudes. The metal-rich stars\nexhibit bar-like kinematics and display a bimodality in their magnitude\ndistribution, a feature which is tightly associated with the X-shape bulge.\nThey overlap with the metal-rich end of the thin disk sequence in the [Mg/Fe]\nvs. [Fe/H] plane. Metal-poor bulge stars have a more isotropic hot kinematics\nand do not participate in the X-shape bulge. With similar Mg-enhancement\nlevels, the position of the metal-poor bulge sequence \"knee\" is observed at\n[Fe/H]$_{knee}=-0.37\\pm0.09$, being 0.06 dex higher than that of the thick\ndisk. It suggests a higher SFR for the bulge than for the thick disk. Finally,\nwe present a chemical evolution model that suitably fits the whole bulge\nsequence by assuming a fast ($<1$ Gyr) intense burst of stellar formation at\nearly epochs. We associate metal-rich stars with the B/P bulge formed from the\nsecular evolution of the early thin disk. On the other hand, the metal-poor\nsubpopulation might be the product of an early prompt dissipative collapse\ndominated by massive stars. Nevertheless, our results do not allow us to firmly\nrule out the possibility that these stars come from the secular evolution of\nthe early thick disk. This is the first time that an analysis of the bulge MDF\nand $\\alpha$-abundances has been performed in a large area on the basis of a\nhomogeneous, fully spectroscopic analysis of high-resolution, high S/N data.\n", "  The critical radius of a core-shell-type nucleus grown by diffusion in a\nphase-separated solution is studied. A {\\it kinetic} critical radius rather\nthan the {\\it thermodynamic} critical radius of standard classical nucleation\ntheory can be defined from the diffusional growth equations. It is shown that\nthere exist two kinetic critical radii for the core-shell-type nucleus, for\nwhich both the inner core radius and the outer shell radius will be stationary.\nTherefore, these two critical radii correspond to a single critical point of\nthe nucleation path with a single energy barrier even though the nucleation\nlooks like a two-step process. The two radii are given by formulas similar to\nthat of classical nucleation theory if the Ostwald-Freundlich boundary\ncondition is imposed at the surface of the inner nucleus and that of the outer\nshell. The subsequent growth of a core-shell-type post-critical nucleus follows\nthe classical picture of Ostwald's step rule. Our result is consistent with\nsome of the experimental and numerical results which suggest the\ncore-shell-type critical nucleus.\n", "  We present a theoretical model to predict the properties of an observed $z =$\n5.72 Lyman $\\alpha$ emitter galaxy - CIV absorption pair separated by 1384\ncomoving kpc/h. We use the separation of the pair and an outflow velocity/time\ntravelling argument to demonstrate that the observed galaxy cannot be the\nsource of metals for the CIV absorber. We find a plausible explanation for the\nmetal enrichment in the context of our simulations: a dwarf galaxy with\n$M_{\\star} =$ 1.87 $\\times$ 10$^{9} M_{\\odot}$ located 119 comoving kpc/h away\nwith a wind velocity of $\\sim$ 100 km/s launched at $z \\sim$ 7. Such a dwarf\n($M_{\\text{UV}} =$ - 20.5) is fainter than the detection limit of the observed\nexample. In a general analysis of galaxy - CIV absorbers, we find galaxies with\n-20.5 $< M_{\\text{UV}} <$ - 18.8 are responsible for the observed metal\nsignatures. In addition, we find no correlation between the mass of the closest\ngalaxy to the absorber and the distance between them, but a weak\nanti-correlation between the strength of the absorption and the separation of\ngalaxy - absorber pairs.\n", "  Despite the fact that quantum mechanical principles do not allow the\nestablishment of an exact quantum analogue of the classical transition state\ntheory (TST), the development of a quantum TST (QTST) with a proper dynamical\njustification, while recovering the TST in the classical limit, has been a long\nstanding theoretical challenge in chemical physics. One of the most recent\nefforts of this kind was put forth by Hele and Althorpe (HA) [ J. Chem. Phys.\n138 , 084108 (2013)], which can be specified for any cyclically invariant\ndividing surface defined in the space of the imaginary time path integral. The\npresent work revisits the issue of the non-uniqueness of QTST and provides a\ndetailed theoretical analysis of HA-QTST for a general class of such path\nintegral dividing surfaces. While we confirm that HA-QTST reproduces the result\nbased on the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate theory for dividing\nsurfaces containing only a quadratic form of low frequency Fourier modes, we\nfind that it produces different results for those containing higher frequency\nimaginary time paths which accommodate greater quantum fluctuations. This\nresult confirms the assessment made in our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 144,\n084110 (2016)] that HA-QTST does not provide a derivation of RPMD-TST in\ngeneral, and points to a new ambiguity of HA-QTST with respect to its\njustification for general cyclically invariant dividing surfaces defined in the\nspace of imaginary time path integrals. Our analysis also offers new insights\ninto similar path integral based QTST approaches.\n", "  We study Unruh effect for a wide class of non local theories. Using the\napproach of Bogoliubov coefficents we show that Unruh effect remains entirely\nunmodified in these theories. However, for those non local theories which\nincorporate a minimal length, the approach using Unruh-DeWitt detectors\npredicts a modification in Unruh effect. Previous work shows that this\nmodification may even be drastic. This appears contradictory, with two\napparently equivalent methods giving different results. We investigate the\norigin of the contradiction and show that for these theories, the two methods\nare indeed inequivalent. We argue that the detector method incorporates an\nassumption of local interaction that does not hold for non local theories and\ntherefore the method of Bogoliubov coefficients is preferable.\n", "  Protostellar jets and outflows are key features of the star-formation\nprocess, and primary processes of the feedback of young stars on the\ninterstellar medium. Understanding the underlying shocks is necessary to\nexplain how jets and outflows are launched, and to quantify their chemical and\nenergetic impacts on the surrounding medium. We performed a high-spectral\nresolution study of the [OI]$_{\\rm 63 \\mu m}$ emission in the outflow of the\nintermediate-mass Class 0 protostar Cep E-mm. We present observations of the OI\n$^3$P$_1 \\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_2$, OH between $^2\\Pi_{1/2}$ $J = 3/2$ and $J =\n1/2$ at 1837.8 GHz, and CO (16-15) lines with SOFIA-GREAT at three positions in\nthe Cep E outflow: mm (the driving protostar), BI (in the southern lobe), and\nBII (the terminal position in the southern lobe). The CO line is detected at\nall three positions. The OI line is detected in BI and BII, whereas the OH line\nis not detected. In BII, we identify three kinematical components in OI and CO,\nalready detected in CO: the jet, the HH377 terminal bow-shock, and the outflow\ncavity. The OI column density is higher in the outflow cavity than in the jet,\nwhich itself is higher than in the terminal shock. The terminal shock is where\nthe abundance ratio of OI to CO is the lowest (about 0.2), whereas the jet\ncomponent is atomic (ratio $\\sim$2.7). In the jet, we compare the OI\nobservations with shock models that successfully fit the integrated intensity\nof 10 CO lines: these models do not fit the OI data. The high intensity of OI\nemission points towards the propagation of additional dissociative or\nalternative FUV-irradiated shocks, where the illumination comes from the shock\nitself. From the sample of low-to-high mass protostellar outflows where similar\nobservations have been performed, the effects of illumination seem to increase\nwith the mass of the protostar.\n", "  Sequential chromospheric brightenings (SCBs) are often observed in the\nimmediate vicinity of erupting flares and are associated with coronal mass\nejections. Since their initial discovery in 2005, there have been several\nsubsequent investigations of SCBs. These studies have used differing detection\nand analysis techniques, making it difficult to compare results between\nstudies. This work employs the automated detection algorithm of Kirk et al.\n(Solar Phys. 283, 97, 2013) to extract the physical characteristics of SCBs in\n11 flares of varying size and intensity. We demonstrate that the magnetic\nsubstructure within the SCB appears to have a significantly smaller area than\nthe corresponding H-alpha emission. We conclude that SCBs originate in the\nlower corona around 0.1 R_sun above the photosphere, propagate away from the\nflare center at speeds of 35 - 85 km/s, and have peak photosphere magnetic\nintensities of 148 +/- 2.9 G. In light of these measurements, we infer SCBs to\nbe distinctive chromospheric signatures of erupting coronal mass ejections.\n", "  The intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression can give rise to large\nfluctuations and rare events that drive phenotypic variation in a population of\ngenetically identical cells. Characterizing the fluctuations that give rise to\nsuch rare events motivates the analysis of large deviations in stochastic\nmodels of gene expression. Recent developments in non-equilibrium statistical\nmechanics have led to a framework for analyzing Markovian processes conditioned\non rare events and for representing such processes by conditioning-free driven\nMarkovian processes. We use this framework, in combination with approaches\nbased on queueing theory, to analyze a general class of stochastic models of\ngene expression. Modeling gene expression as a Batch Markovian Arrival Process\n(BMAP), we derive exact analytical results quantifying large deviations of\ntime-integrated random variables such as promoter activity fluctuations. We\nfind that the conditioning-free driven process can also be represented by a\nBMAP that has the same form as the original process, but with renormalized\nparameters. The results obtained can be used to quantify the likelihood of\nlarge deviations, to characterize system fluctuations conditional on rare\nevents and to identify combinations of model parameters that can give rise to\ndynamical phase transitions in system dynamics.\n", "  Red clump stars are fundamental distance indicators in astrophysics, although\ntheoretical stellar models predict a dependence of absolute magnitudes with\nages. This effect is particularly strong below 2 Gyr, but even above this limit\na mild age dependence is still expected. We use seismically identified red\nclump stars in the Kepler field for which we have reliable distances, masses\nand ages from the SAGA survey to first explore this effect. By excluding red\nclump stars with masses larger than 1.6 Msun (corresponding to ages younger\nthan 2 Gyr), we derive robust calibrations linking intrinsic colors to absolute\nmagnitudes in the following photometric systems: Str\\\"omgren $by$, Johnson\n$BV$, Sloan $griz$, 2MASS $JHK_s$ and WISE $W1W2W3$. With the precision\nachieved we also detect a slope of absolute magnitudes 0.020(0.003) mag per\nGyrin the infrared, implying that distance calibrations of clump stars can be\noff by up to 0.2 mag in the infrared (over the range from 2 Gyr to 12 Gyr) if\ntheir ages are unknown. Even larger uncertainties affect optical bands, because\nof the stronger interdependency of absolute magnitudes on colors and age. Our\ndistance calibrations are ultimately based on asteroseismology, and we show how\nthe distance scale can be used to test the accuracy of seismic scaling\nrelations. Within the uncertainties our calibrations are in agreement with\nthose built upon local red clump with Hipparcos} parallaxes, although we find a\ntension which if confirmed would imply that scaling relations overestimate\nradii of red clump stars by 2(+-20%. Data-releases post Gaia DR1 will provide\nan important testbed for our results.\n", "  The $k$-$\\omega$ model for turbulence was first proposed by Kolmogorov\n(1942). A new $k$-$\\omega$ model for stellar convection was developed by Li\n(2012), which could reasonably describe turbulent convection not only in the\nconvectively unstable zone but also in the overshooting regions. We have\nrevised the $k$-$\\omega$ model by improving several model assumptions\n(including the macro-length of turbulence, convective heat flux, and turbulent\nmixing diffusivity, etc.), making it applicable for not only convective\nenvelopes but also convective cores. Eight parameters are introduced in the\nrevised $k$-$\\omega$ model. It should be noted that the Reynolds stress\n(turbulent pressure) is neglected in the equation of hydrostatic support. We\nhave applied it into solar models and 5$M_{\\odot}$ stellar models, in order to\ncalibrate the eight model parameters, as well as to investigate the effects of\nthe convective overshooting on the sun and intermediate mass stellar models.\n", "  In the literature, contradictory results have been published regarding the\nform of the limiting (long-time) grain size distribution (LGSD) that\ncharacterizes the late stage grain coarsening in two-dimensional and\nquasi-two-dimensional polycrystalline systems. While experiments and the\nphase-field crystal (PFC) model (a simple dynamical density functional theory)\nindicate a lognormal distribution, other works including theoretical studies\nbased on conventional phase-field simulations that rely on coarse grained\nfields, like the multi-phase-field (MPF) and orientation field (OF) models,\nyield significantly different distributions. In a recent work, we have shown\nthat the coarse grained phase-field models (whether MPF or OF) yield very\nsimilar limiting size distributions that seem to differ from the theoretical\npredictions. Herein, we revisit this problem, and demonstrate in the case of OF\nmodels [by R. Kobayashi et al., Physica D 140, 141 (2000) and H. Henry et al.\nPhys. Rev. B 86, 054117 (2012)] that an insufficient resolution of the small\nangle grain boundaries leads to a lognormal distribution close to those seen in\nthe experiments and the molecular scale PFC simulations. Our work indicates,\nfurthermore, that the LGSD is critically sensitive to the details of the\nevaluation process, and raises the possibility that the differences among the\nLGSD results from different sources may originate from differences in the\ndetection of small angle grain boundaries.\n", "  The bound state Bethe-Salpeter amplitude was expressed by Nakanishi using a\ntwo-dimensional integral representation, in terms of a smooth weight function\n$g$, which carries the detailed dynamical information. A similar, but\none-dimensional, integral representation can be obtained for the Light-Front\nwave function in terms of the same weight function $g$. By using the\ngeneralized Stieltjes transform, we first obtain $g$ in terms of the\nLight-Front wave function in the complex plane of its arguments. Next, a new\nintegral equation for the Nakanishi weight function $g$ is derived for a bound\nstate case. It has the standard form $g= N g$, where $N$ is a two-dimensional\nintegral operator. We give the prescription for obtaining the kernel $ N$\nstarting with the kernel $K$ of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The derivation is\nvalid for any kernel given by an irreducible Feynman amplitude.\n", "  Robust synchronization is indispensable for stable operation of a power grid.\nRecently, it has been reported that a large number of decentralized generators,\nrather than a small number of large power plants, provide enhanced\nsynchronization together with greater robustness against structural failures.\nIn this paper, we systematically control the spatial uniformity of the\ngeographical distribution of generators, and conclude that the more uniformly\ngenerators are distributed, the more enhanced synchronization occurs. In the\npresence of temporal failures of power sources, we observe that spatial\nuniformity helps the power grid to recover stationarity in a shorter time. We\nalso discuss practical implications of our results in designing the structure\nof a power-grid network.\n", "  The curvature effect may be responsible for the steep decay phase observed in\ngamma-ray bursts. For testing the curvature effect with observations, the zero\ntime point $t_0$ adopted to plot observer time and flux on a logarithmic scale\nshould be appropriately selected. In practice, however, the true $t_0$ cannot\nbe directly constrained from the data. Then, we move $t_0$ to a certain time in\nthe steep decay phase, which can be easily identified. In this situation, we\nderive an analytical formula to describe the flux evolution of the steep decay\nphase. The analytical formula is read as $F_\\nu\\propto (1+\\tilde t_{\\rm\nobs}/{\\tilde t_c})^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha(\\tilde{t}_{\\rm\nobs})=2+{\\int_{0}^{\\log (1+\\tilde{t}_{\\rm obs}/{\\tilde{t}_c})}\n{\\beta(\\tau)d[\\log(1+\\tau/{\\tilde{t}_c})]}}/{\\log (1 + {\\tilde t}_{\\rm\nobs}/{{\\tilde t}_c})}$, where $F_\\nu$ is the flux observed at frequency $\\nu$,\n$\\tilde t_{\\rm obs}$ is the observer time by setting zero time point $t_0$ at a\ncertain time in the steep decay phase, $\\beta$ is the spectral index estimated\naround $\\nu$, and ${\\tilde t}_c$ is the decay timescale of the phase with\n$\\tilde{t}_{\\rm obs}{\\geqslant}0$. We test the analytical formula with the data\nfrom numerical calculations. It is found that the analytical formula presents a\nwell estimation about the evolution of flux shaped by the curvature effect. Our\nanalytical formula can be used to confront the curvature effect with\nobservations and estimate the decay timescale of the steep decay phase.\n", "  We present deep wide-field optical CCD photometry and mid-infrared\nSpitzer/IRAC and MIPS 24micron data for about 100,000 stars in the young open\ncluster IC 1805. The members of IC 1805 were selected from their location in\nthe various color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, and the presence of\nHalpha emission, mid-infrared excess emission, and X-ray emission. The\nreddening law toward IC 1805 is nearly normal (R_V = 3.05+/-0.06). However, the\ndistance modulus of the cluster is estimated to be 11.9+/-0.2 mag (d =\n2.4+/-0.2 kpc) from the reddening-free color-magnitude diagrams, which is\nlarger than the distance to the nearby massive star-forming region W3(OH)\nmeasured from the radio VLBA astrometry. We also determined the age of IC 1805\n(tau_MSTO = 3.5 Myr). In addition, we critically compared the age and mass\nscale from two pre-main-sequence evolution models. The initial mass function\nwith a Salpeter-type slope of Gamma = -1.3+/-0.2 was obtained and the total\nmass of IC 1805 was estimated to be about 2700+/-200 M_sun. Finally, we found\nour distance determination to be statistically consistent with the Tycho-Gaia\nAstrometric Solution Data Release 1, within the errors. The proper motion of\nthe B-type stars shows an elongated distribution along the Galactic plane,\nwhich could be explained by some of the B-type stars being formed in small\nclouds dispersed by previous episodes of star formation or supernova\nexplosions.\n", "  An overview of ALICE results on the measurement of J/{\\psi} production in pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV collected during the LHC Run-1 period is\npresented, as well as first results at forward rapidity from pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected during the LHC Run-2 period. In particular, the\nmeasurement of J/{\\psi} production as a function of transverse momentum and\ncharged-particle multiplicity are discussed and compared to theoretical model\ncalculations.\n", "  Structural aspects of crystal nucleation in undercooled liquids are explored\nusing a nonlinear hydrodynamic theory of crystallization proposed recently [G.\nI. Toth et al., J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 26, 055001 (2014)], which is based on\ncombining fluctuating hydrodynamics with the phase-field crystal theory. We\nshow that in this hydrodynamic approach not only homogeneous and heterogeneous\nnucleation processes are accessible, but also growth front nucleation, which\nleads to the formation of new (differently oriented) grains at the solid-liquid\nfront in highly undercooled systems. Formation of dislocations at the\nsolid-liquid interface and interference of density waves ahead of the\ncrystallization front are responsible for the appearance of the new\norientations at the growth front that lead to spherulite-like nanostructures.\n", "  We investigate the focusing coupled PT-symmetric nonlocal nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation employing Darboux transformation approach. We find a\nfamily of exact solutions including pairs of Bright-Bright, Dark-Dark and\nBright-Dark solitons in addition to solitary waves. We show that one can\nconvert bright bound state onto a dark bound state in a two-soliton solution by\nselectively fine tuning the amplitude dependent parameter. We also show that\nthe energy in each mode remains conserved unlike the celebrated Manakov model.\nWe also characterize the behaviour of the soliton solutions in detail. We\nemphasize that the above phenomenon occurs due to the nonlocality of the model.\n", "  We derive a simple analytical formula to describe the evolution of spectral\nindex $\\beta$ in the steep decay phase shaped by the curvature effect with\nassumption that the spectral parameters and Lorentz factor of jet shell is the\nsame for different latitude. Here, the value of $\\beta$ is estimated in\n0.3$-$10keV energy band. For a spherical thin shell with a cutoff power law\n(CPL) intrinsic radiation spectrum, the spectral evolution can be read as a\nlinear function of observer time. For the situation with Band function\nintrinsic radiation spectrum, the spectral evolution may be complex. If the\nobserved break energy of radiation spectrum is larger than 10keV, the spectral\nevolution is the same as that shaped by jet shells with a CPL spectrum. If the\nobserved break energy is less than 0.3keV, the value of $\\beta$ would be a\nconstant. Others, the spectral evolution can be approximated as a logarithmal\nfunction of the observer time in generally.\n", "  The physical properties and its contribution to the onset of solar flare are\nstill unclear although chromospheric brightening is considered a precursor\nphenomenon of flare. Many studies suggested that photospheric magnetic field\nchanges cause destabilization of large-scale coronal structure. We aim to\nunderstand how a small photospheric change contributes to a flare and to reveal\nhow the intermediary chromosphere behaves in the precursor phase. We analyzed\nthe precursor brightening of the X1.6 flare on 2014 October 22 in the AR 12192\nusing the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and Hinode/EUV Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) data. We investigated a localized jet with the strong\nprecursor brightening, and compared the intensity, Doppler velocity, and line\nwidth in C II, Mg II k, Si IV lines by IRIS and He II, Fe XII, Fe XV lines by\nHinode/EIS. We also analyzed photospheric magnetic field and\nchromospheric/coronal structures using Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\n(AIA). We found a significant blueshift (~ 100 km/s), which is related to the\nstrong precursor brightening over a characteristic magnetic field structure,\nand the blueshift was observed at all the temperature. This might indicate that\nthe flow is accelerated by Lorentz force. Moreover, the large-scale coronal\nloop that connects the foot-points of the flare ribbons was destabilized just\nafter the precursor brightening with the blueshift. It suggests that magnetic\nreconnection locally occurred in the lower chromosphere and it triggered\nmagnetic reconnection of the X1.6 flare in the corona.\n", "  We present a derivation of coherent helicity amplitudes for a particle\ndecaying into multifinal states with nonzero spins. The results show that the\ncoherent amplitudes introduce additional rotations to transform the helicities\ninto a consistent helicity system, which allows us to add helicity amplitudes\nfor different decay chains coherently. These rotations may have significant\neffects on the interference between the decay chains in the partial wave\nanalysis.\n", "  The Earth was born in violence. Many giant collisions of protoplanets are\nthought to have occurred during the terrestrial planet formation. Here we\ninvestigated the giant impact stage by using a hybrid code that consistently\ndeals with the orbital evolution of protoplanets around the Sun and the details\nof processes during giant impacts between two protoplanets. A significant\namount of materials (up to several tens of percent of the total mass of the\nprotoplanets) is ejected by giant impacts. We call these ejected fragments the\ngiant-impact fragments (GIFs). In some of the erosive hit-and-run and\nhigh-velocity collisions, metallic iron is also ejected, which comes from the\ncolliding protoplanets' cores. From ten numerical simulations for the giant\nimpact stage, we found that the mass fraction of metallic iron in GIFs ranges\nfrom ~ 1wt% to ~ 25wt%. We also discussed the effects of the GIFs on the\ndynamical and geochemical characteristics of formed terrestrial planets. We\nfound that the GIFs have the potential to solve the following dynamical and\ngeochemical conflicts: (1) The Earth, currently in a near circular orbit, is\nlikely to have had a highly eccentric orbit during the giant impact stage. The\nGIFs are large enough in total mass to lower the eccentricity of the Earth to\nits current value via their dynamical friction. (2) The concentrations of\nhighly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the Earth's mantle are greater than what\nwas predicted experimentally. Re-accretion of the iron-bearing GIFs onto the\nEarth can contribute to the excess of HSEs. In addition, the estimated amount\nof iron-bearing GIFs provides significant reducing agent that could transform\nprimitive CO2-H2O atmosphere and ocean into more reducing H2-bearing\natmosphere. Thus, GIFs are important for the origin of Earth's life and its\nearly evolution.\n", "  Observations of radio supernovae often exhibit characteristics not readily\naccounted for by a homogeneous, spherically symmetric synchrotron model; e.g.,\nflat-topped spectra/lightcurves. It is shown that many of these deviations from\nthe standard model can be attributed to an inhomogeneous source structure. It\nis argued that the radio emission in Type Ib/c supernovae has a small volume\nfilling factor and comes from a narrow region associated with the forward\nshock, while the radio emission region in SN 1993J (Type IIb) is determined by\nthe extent of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability emanating from the contact\ndiscontinuity. Attention is also drawn to the similarities between radio\nsupernovae and the structural properties of supernova remnants.\n", "  In this paper we extend some recent results on an operatorial approach to the\ndescription of alliances between political parties interacting among themselves\nand with a basin of electors. In particular, we propose and compare three\ndifferent models, deducing the dynamics of their related {\\em decision\nfunctions}, i.e. the attitude of each party to form or not an alliance. In the\nfirst model the interactions between each party and their electors are\nconsidered. We show that these interactions drive the decision functions\ntowards certain asymptotic values depending on the electors only: this is the\n{\\em perfect party}, which behaves following the electors' suggestions. The\nsecond model is an extension of the first one in which we include a $rule$\nwhich modifies the status of the electors, and of the decision functions as a\nconsequence, at some specific time step. In the third model we neglect the\ninteractions with the electors while we consider cubic and quartic interactions\nbetween the parties and we show that we get (slightly oscillating) asymptotic\nvalues for the decision functions, close to their initial values. This is the\n{\\em real party}, which does not listen to the electors. Several explicit\nsituations are considered in details and numerical results are also shown.\n", "  We investigate the coronal and interplanetary evolution of a coronal mass\nejection (CME) launched on 2010 September 4 from a source region linking two\nactive regions (ARs) 11101 and 11103, using extreme ultraviolet imaging,\nmagnetogram, white-light and in situ observations from SDO, STEREO, SOHO, VEX\nand Wind. A potential-field source-surface model is employed to examine the\nconfiguration of the coronal magnetic field surrounding the source region. The\ngraduated cylindrical shell model and a triangulation method are applied to\ndetermine the kinematics of the CME in the corona and interplanetary space.\nFrom the remote sensing and in situ observations we obtain some key results:\n(1) the CME was deflected in both the eastward and southward directions in the\nlow corona by the magnetic pressure from the two ARs and possibly interacted\nwith another ejection, which caused that the CME arrived at VEX that was\nlongitudinally distant from the source region; (2) although VEX was closer to\nthe Sun, the observed and derived CME arrival times at VEX are not earlier than\nthose at Wind, which suggests the importance of determining both the frontal\nshape and propagation direction of the CME in interplanetary space; (3) the\nICME was compressed in the radial direction while the longitudinal transverse\nsize was extended.\n", "  We have carried out a systematic search for recoiling supermassive black\nholes (rSMBH) using the Chandra Source and SDSS Cross Matched Catalog. From the\nsurvey, we have detected a potential rSMBH, 'CXO J101527.2+625911' at z=0.3504.\nThe CXO J101527.2+625911 has a spatially offset (1.26$\\pm$0.05 kpc) active SMBH\nand kinematically offset broad emission lines (175$\\pm$25 km s$^{\\rm -1}$\nrelative to systemic velocity). The observed spatial and velocity offsets\nsuggest this galaxy could be a rSMBH, but we also have considered a possibility\nof dual SMBH scenario. The column density towards the galaxy center was found\nto be Compton thin, but no X-ray source was detected. The non-detection of the\nX-ray source in the nucleus suggests either there is no obscured actively\naccreting SMBH, or there exists an SMBH but has a low accretion rate (i.e.\nlow-luminosity AGN (LLAGN)). The possibility of the LLAGN was investigated and\nfound to be unlikely based on the H$\\alpha$ luminosity, radio power, and\nkinematic arguments. This, along with the null detection of X-ray source in the\nnucleus supports our hypothesis that the CXO J101527.2+625911 is a rSMBH. Our\nGALFIT analysis shows the host galaxy to be a bulge-dominated elliptical. The\nweak morphological disturbance and small spatial and velocity offsets suggest\nthat CXO J101527.2+625911 could be in the final stage of merging process and\nabout to turn into a normal elliptical galaxy.\n", "  The motion of energetic particles in magnetic turbulence across a mean\nmagnetic field is explored analytically. The approach presented here allows for\na full time-dependent description of the transport, including compound\nsub-diffusion. The first time it is shown systematically that as soon as there\nis transverse structure of the turbulence, diffusion is restored even if no\nCoulomb collisions are invoked. Criteria for sub-diffusion and normal Markovian\ndiffusion are found as well.\n", "  The electron-cyclotron maser is a process that generates intense and coherent\nradio emission in plasma. In this paper, we present a comprehensive parametric\ninvestigation on the electron-cyclotron-maser instability driven by non-thermal\nring-beam electrons with intrinsic Alfv\\'en waves which pervade the solar\natmosphere and interplanetary space. It is found that both forward propagating\nand backward propagating waves can be excited in the fast ordinary (O) and\nextraordinary (X) electromagnetic modes. The growth rates of X1 mode are almost\nalways weakened by Alfv\\'en waves. The average pitch-angle $\\phi_0$ of\nelectrons is a key parameter for the effect of Alfv\\'en waves on the growth\nrate of modes O1, O2 and X2. For a beam-dominated electron distribution\n($\\phi_0 \\lesssim 30^\\circ$ ), the growth rates of the maser instability for\nO1, O2 and X2 modes are enhanced with the increase of Alfv\\'en wave energy\ndensity. In other conditions, the growth rates of O1, O2 and X2 modes weakened\nwith increasing Alfv\\'en wave intensity, except that the growth of O1 mode may\nalso be enhanced by Alfv\\'en waves for a ring distribution. The results may be\nimportant for us in analyzing the mechanism of radio bursts with various fine\nstructures observed in space and astrophysical plasmas.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the real modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV)\nequation and construct a special kind of breather solution, which can be\nobtained by taking the limit $\\lambda_{j}$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\lambda_{1}$ of the\nLax pair eigenvalues used in the $n$-fold Darboux transformation that generates\nthe order-$n$ periodic solution from a constant seed solution. Further, this\nspecial kind of breather solution of order $n$ can be used to generate the\norder-$n$ rational solution by taking the limit $\\lambda_{1}$ $\\rightarrow$\n$\\lambda_{0}$, where $\\lambda_{0}$ is a special eigenvalue associated to the\neigenfunction $\\phi$ of the Lax pair of the mKdV equation. This eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_0$, for which $\\phi(\\lambda_0)=0$, corresponds to the limit of\ninfinite period of the periodic solution. %This second limit of double\neigenvalue degeneration might be realized approximately in optical fibers, in\nwhich an injected %initial ideal pulse is created by a comb system and a\nprogrammable optical filter according to the profile of the analytical %form of\nthe b-positon at a certain spatial position $x_{0}$. Therefore, we suggest a\nnew way to observe the higher-order %rational solutions in optical fibers,\nnamely, to measure the wave patterns at the central region of the higher order\nb-positon %generated by ideal initial pulses when the eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$\nis approaching $\\lambda_{0}$. Our analytical and numerical results show the\neffective mechanism of generation of higher-order rational solutions of the\nmKdV equation from the double eigenvalue degeneration process of multi-periodic\nsolutions.\n", "  We present a manifestly local and general coordinate invariant formulation of\na nonlocal approach to the cosmological constant problem which has been\nrecently proposed by Carroll and Remmen. To do that, we need to introduce a\ntopological term involving a new 3-form gauge field. The equations of motion\nfor this new 3-form gauge field lead to a constant Lagrange multiplier\nparameter and the resulting action becomes equivalent to that of Carroll and\nRemmen. In our formulation, nonlocal informations are encoded via the procedure\nof taking the space-time average at the stage of the equations of motion.\nConsequently, our theory evades a no-go theorem by Weinberg and provides a new\nsolution to the cosmological constant problem in almost exactly the same way as\nthe original proposal by Carroll et al.\n", "  We report the enthalpy of oxygen vacancy formation in thin films of\nelectron-doped SrTiO$_{3}$, under different degrees of epitaxial stress. We\ndemonstrate that both compressive and tensile strain decrease this energy at a\nvery similar rate, and promote the formation of stable doubly ionized oxygen\nvacancies. Moreover, we also show that unintentional cationic vacancies\nintroduced under typical growth conditions, produce a characteristic rotation\npattern of TiO$_6$ octahedra. The local concentration of oxygen vacancies can\nbe modulated by an electric field with an AFM tip, changing not only the local\nelectrical potential, but also producing a non-volatile mechanical response\nwhose sign (up/down) can be reversed by the electric field.\n", "  Rate-equation models are a widely-used and inexpensive tool for the\nsimulation of interstellar chemistry under a range of physical conditions.\nHowever, their application to grain-surface chemical systems necessitates a\nnumber of simplifying assumptions, due to the requirement to treat only the\ntotal population of each species, using averaged rates, rather than treating\neach surface particle as an independent entity. While the outputs from\nrate-equation models are strictly limited to such population information, the\ninputs -- in the form of the averaged rates that control the time-evolution of\nchemical populations -- can be guided by the results from more exact simulation\nmethods. Here, we examine the effects of back-diffusion, wherein particles\ndiffusing on a surface revisit binding sites on the lattice, slowing the total\nreaction rate. While this effect has been studied for two-particle systems, its\ninfluence at greater surface coverage of reactants has not been explored.\nResults from two Monte Carlo kinetics models (one a 2-D periodic lattice, the\nother the surface of a three dimensionally-realized grain) were used to develop\na means to incorporate the grain-surface back-diffusion effect into\nrate-equation methods. The effects of grain size, grain morphology, and surface\ncoverage on the magnitude of the back-diffusion effect were studied for the\nsimple H+H reaction system. The results were fit with expressions that can be\neasily incorporated into astrochemical rate-equation models to reproduce\naccurately the effects of back-diffusion on grain-surface reaction rates.\nBack-diffusion reduces reaction rates by a maximum factor of around 5 for the\ncanonical grain of $\\sim$10$^6$ surface sites, but this falls to unity at close\nto full surface coverage.\n", "  The state of a stochastic process evolving over a time $t$ is typically\nassumed to lie on a normal distribution whose width scales like $t^{1/2}$.\nHowever, processes where the probability distribution is not normal and the\nscaling exponent differs from $\\frac{1}{2}$ are known. The search for possible\norigins of such \"anomalous\" scaling and approaches to quantify them are the\nmotivations for the work reported here. In processes with stationary\nincrements, where the stochastic process is time-independent, auto-correlations\nbetween increments and infinite variance of increments can cause anomalous\nscaling. These sources have been referred to as the $\\it{Joseph}$ $\\it{effect}$\nthe $\\it{Noah}$ $\\it{effect}$, respectively. If the increments are\nnon-stationary, then scaling of increments with $t$ can also lead to anomalous\nscaling, a mechanism we refer to as the $\\it{Moses}$ $\\it{effect}$. Scaling\nexponents quantifying the three effects are defined and related to the Hurst\nexponent that characterizes the overall scaling of the stochastic process.\nMethods of time series analysis that enable accurate independent measurement of\neach exponent are presented. Simple stochastic processes are used to illustrate\neach effect. Intraday Financial time series data is analyzed, revealing that\nits anomalous scaling is due only to the Moses effect. In the context of\nfinancial market data, we reiterate that the Joseph exponent, not the Hurst\nexponent, is the appropriate measure to test the efficient market hypothesis.\n", "  The Herschel Orion Protostar Survey obtained well-sampled 1.2 - 870 micron\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of over 300 protostars in the Orion\nmolecular clouds, home to most of the young stellar objects (YSOs) in the\nnearest 500 pc. We plot the bolometric luminosities and temperatures for 330\nOrion YSOs, 315 of which have bolometric temperatures characteristic of\nprotostars. The histogram of bolometric temperature is roughly flat; 29% of the\nprotostars are in Class 0. The median luminosity decreases by a factor of four\nwith increasing bolometric temperature; consequently, the Class 0 protostars\nare systematically brighter than the Class I protostars, with a median\nluminosity of 2.3 L_sun as opposed to 0.87 L_sun. At a given bolometric\ntemperature, the scatter in luminosities is three orders of magnitude. Using\nfits to the SEDs, we analyze how the luminosities corrected for inclination and\nforeground reddening relate to the mass in the inner 2500 AU of the best-fit\nmodel envelopes. The histogram of envelope mass is roughly flat, while the\nmedian corrected luminosity peaks at 15 L_sun for young envelopes and falls to\n1.7 L_sun for late-stage protostars with remnant envelopes. The spread in\nluminosity at each envelope mass is three orders of magnitude. Envelope masses\nthat decline exponentially with time explain the flat mass histogram and the\ndecrease in luminosity, while the formation of a range of stellar masses\nexplains the dispersion in luminosity.\n", "  We report observations of the high (R$\\sim$18000) and medium (R$\\sim$5900)\nresolution, near-infrared spectra of Jupiter's polar regions with the GNIRS\ninstrument at the Gemini North telescope. The observations correspond to the\narea of main auroral oval in the South and the main spot of the Io footprint in\nthe North. We detected and assigned 18 emission lines of the H$_{3}^{+}$,\n2$\\nu_{2}\\rightarrow 0$ overtone band in the region from 4800 to 4980 cm$^{-1}$\nand 5 additional lines in the extended low-resolution spectrum. We use our new\nmodelling scheme, ATMOF to remove telluric absorption bands of CO$_2$ that\nfeature strongly in the 2 $\\mu$m region. The H${_2}$ 1-0 S(1), S(2) and S(3)\nemission lines are also detected in the observed spectral region. We found the\nrotational temperature and column density of H$_{3}^{+}$ emission at the peak\nintensity for both northern and southern auroral regions to be the same within\nthe measurement errors (T$_{rot} \\sim950$K and N(H$_{3}^{+}$) $\\sim$\n4.5$\\times10^{16}$m$^{-2}$). The estimates of T$_{rot}$ from H$_{2}$ are\nconsistent within much higher uncertainties with temperatures derived from\nH$_{3}^{+}$ emissions. We derived the profiles of the H$_{3}^{+}$ emissivity\nand ion density for both auroral regions providing the first such measurement\nfor the emission associated with the main spot of the Io footprint. We also\nfound a number of weaker lines in the high-resolution spectra that could be\nassociated with emission from high excitation levels in neutral iron, which\ncould be deposited in Jupiter's atmosphere as a result of meteor ablation.\n", "  We present the Supernova X-ray Database (SNaX), a compilation of the X-ray\ndata from young supernovae (SNe). The database includes the X-ray flux and\nluminosity of young SNe, days to years after outburst. The original goal and\nintent were to present a database of Type IIn SNe. After having accomplished\nthis we are slowly expanding it to include all SNe for which published data are\navailable. The interface allows one to search for SNe using various criteria,\nplot all or selected data-points, and download both the data and the plot. The\nplotting facility allows for significant customization. There is also a\nfacility for the user to submit data that can be directly incorporated into the\ndatabase. We include an option to fit the decay of any given SN lightcurve with\na power-law. The database includes a conversion of most datapoints to a common\n0.3-8 keV band so that SN lightcurves may be directly compared with each other.\nA mailing list has been set up to disseminate information about the database.\nWe outline the structure and function of the database, describe its various\nfeatures and outline the plans for future expansion.\n", "  We show the first simple, systematic and direct approach to decoupling\ngravitational sources in general relativity. As a direct application, a robust\nand simple way to generate anisotropic solutions for self-gravitating systems\nfrom perfect fluid solutions is presented.\n", "  The transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$ is well known to harbor a rich\nvariety of charge density wave (CDW) distortions which are correlated with\nunderlying lattice atom modulations. The long range CDW phases extend\nthroughout the whole crystal and terminate with charge displacements at the\ncrystal boundaries. Here we report on the transport properties and capacitance\ncharacteristics of the interface between freshly exfoliated flakes of\n1T-TaS$_2$ in intimate van der Waals contact with \\textit{n}-type GaAs\nsubstrates. The extracted barrier parameters (ideality, barrier height and\nbuilt-in potential) experience pronounced changes across the Mott-CDW\ntransition in the 1T-TaS$_2$. The CDW-induced changes in barrier properties are\nwell described by a bond polarization model which upon decreasing temperature\ngives rise to an increased potential drop across the interfacial region due to\nthe localization of carriers and a decreased dielectric constant.\n", "  Polarization measurements provide strong constraints on models for emission\nfrom rotation-powered pulsars. We present multiwavelength polarization\npredictions showing that measurements over a range of frequencies can be\nparticularly important for constraining the emission location, radiation\nmechanisms and system geometry. The results assume a generic model for emission\nfrom the outer magnetosphere and current sheet in which optical to hard X-ray\nemission is produced by synchrotron radiation from electron-positron pairs and\ngamma-ray emission is produced by curvature radiation or synchrotron radiation\nfrom accelerating primary electrons. The magnetic field structure of a\nforce-free magnetosphere is assumed and the phase-resolved and phase-averaged\npolarization is calculated in the frame of an inertial observer. We find that\nlarge position angle swings and deep depolarization dips occur during the light\ncurve peaks in all energy bands. For synchrotron emission, the polarization\ncharacteristics are strongly dependent on photon emission radius with larger,\nnearly $180^\\circ$, position angle swings for emission outside the light\ncylinder as the line-of-sight crosses the current sheet. The phase-averaged\npolarization degree for synchrotron radiation is less that 10% and around 20%\nfor emission starting inside and outside the light cylinder respectively, while\nthe polarization degree for curvature radiation is much larger, up to 40% -\n60%. Observing a sharp increase in polarization degree and a change in position\nangle at the transition between X-ray and gamma-ray spectral components would\nindicate that curvature radiation is the gamma-ray emission mechanism.\n", "  We are motivated by the recent measurements of dust opacity indices beta\naround young stellar objects (YSOs), which suggest that efficient grain growth\nmay have occurred earlier than the Class I stage. The present work makes use of\nabundant archival interferometric observations at submillimeter,millimeter, and\ncentimeter wavelength bands to examine grain growth signatures in the dense\ninner regions (<1000 AU) of nine Class 0 YSOs. A systematic data analysis is\nperformed to derive dust temperatures, optical depths, and dust opacity indices\nbased on single-component modified black body fittings to the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs). The fitted dust opacity indices (beta) are in a wide\nrange of 0.3 to 2.0 when single-component SED fitting is adopted. Four out of\nthe nine observed sources show beta lower than 1.7, the typical value of the\ninterstellar dust. Low dust opacity index (or spectral index) values may be\nexplained by the effect of dust grain growth, which makes beta<1.7.\nAlternatively, the very small observed values of beta may be interpreted by the\npresence of deeply embedded hot inner disks, which only significantly\ncontribute to the observed fluxes at long wavelength bands. This possibility\ncan be tested by the higher angular resolution imaging observations of ALMA, or\nmore detailed sampling of SEDs in the millimeter and centimeter bands. The beta\nvalues of the remaining five sources are close to or consistent with 1.7,\nindicating that grain growth would start to significantly reduce the values of\nbeta no earlier than the late-Class 0 stage for these YSOs.\n", "  We present H band spectroscopic and Halpha photometric observations of HD\n100546 obtained with GPI and MagAO. We detect H band emission at the location\nof the protoplanet HD 100546b, but show that choice of data processing\nparameters strongly affects the morphology of this source. It appears\npoint-like in some aggressive reductions, but rejoins an extended disk\nstructure in the majority of the others. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this\nemission appears stationary on a timescale of 4.6 yrs, inconsistent at the\n2sigma level with a Keplerian clockwise orbit at 59 au in the disk plane. The H\nband spectrum of the emission is inconsistent with any type of low effective\ntemperature object or accreting protoplanetary disk. It strongly suggests a\nscattered light origin, as it is consistent with the spectrum of the star and\nthe spectra extracted at other locations in the disk. A non detection at the\n5sigma level of HD 100546b in differential Halpha imaging places an upper\nlimit, assuming the protoplanet lies in a gap free of extinction, on the\naccretion luminosity and accretion rate of 1.7E-4 Lsun and\nMMdot<6.4E-7Mjup^2/yr for 1Rjup. These limits are comparable to the accretion\nluminosity and rate of TTauri-stars or LkCa 15b. Taken together, these lines of\nevidence suggest that the H band source at the location of HD 100546b is not\nemitted by a planetary photosphere or an accreting circumplanetary disk but is\na disk feature enhanced by the PSF subtraction process. This non-detection is\nconsistent with the non-detection in the K band reported in an earlier study\nbut does not exclude the possibility that HD 100546b is deeply embedded.\n", "  We present a study of the hierarchical clustering of the young stellar\nclusters in six local (3--15 Mpc) star-forming galaxies using Hubble Space\nTelescope broad band WFC3/UVIS UV and optical images from the Treasury Program\nLEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey). We have identified 3685 likely clusters\nand associations, each visually classified by their morphology, and we use the\nangular two-point correlation function to study the clustering of these stellar\nsystems. We find that the spatial distribution of the young clusters and\nassociations are clustered with respect to each other, forming large, unbound\nhierarchical star-forming complexes that are in general very young. The\nstrength of the clustering decreases with increasing age of the star clusters\nand stellar associations, becoming more homogeneously distributed after ~40--60\nMyr and on scales larger than a few hundred parsecs. In all galaxies, the\nassociations exhibit a global behavior that is distinct and more strongly\ncorrelated from compact clusters. Thus, populations of clusters are more\nevolved than associations in terms of their spatial distribution, traveling\nsignificantly from their birth site within a few tens of Myr whereas\nassociations show evidence of disruption occurring very quickly after their\nformation. The clustering of the stellar systems resembles that of a turbulent\ninterstellar medium that drives the star formation process, correlating the\ncomponents in unbound star-forming complexes in a hierarchical manner,\ndispersing shortly after formation, suggestive of a single, continuous mode of\nstar formation across all galaxies.\n", "  Using the NASA/IRTF SpeX & BASS spectrometers we have obtained novel 0.7 - 13\num observations of the newly imaged HD36546 debris disk system. The SpeX\nspectrum is most consistent with the photospheric emission expected from an\nLstar ~ 20 Lsun, solar abundance A1.5V star with little/no extinction and\nexcess emission from circumstellar dust detectable beyond 4.5 um.\nNon-detections of CO emission lines and accretion signatures point to the gas\npoor circumstellar environment of a very old transition disk. Combining the\nSpeX and BASS spectra with archival WISE/AKARI/IRAS/Herschel photometery, we\nfind an outer cold dust belt at ~135K and 20 - 40 AU from the primary, likely\ncoincident with the disk imaged by Subaru (Currie et al. 2017), and a new\nsecond inner belt with temperature ~570K and an unusual, broad SED maximum in\nthe 6 - 9 um region, tracing dust at 1.1 - 2.2 AU. An SED maximum at 6 - 9 um\nhas been reported in just two other A-star systems, HD131488 and HD121191, both\nof ~10 Myr age (Melis et al. 2013). From Spitzer, we have also identified the\n~12 Myr old A7V HD148567 system as having similar 5 - 35 um excess spectral\nfeatures (Mittal et al. 2015). The Spitzer data allows us to rule out water\nemission and rule in carbonaceous materials - organics, carbonates, SiC - as\nthe source of the 6 - 9 um excess. Assuming a common origin for the 4 young\nAstar systems' disks, we suggest they are experiencing an early era of\ncarbon-rich planetesimal processing.\n", "  Different combinations of input parameters to filament identification\nalgorithms, such as Disperse and FilFinder, produce numerous different output\nskeletons. The skeletons are a one pixel wide representation of the filamentary\nstructure in the original input image. However, these output skeletons may not\nnecessarily be a good representation of that structure. Furthermore, a given\nskeleton may not be as good a representation as another. Previously there has\nbeen no mathematical `goodness-of-fit' measure to compare output skeletons to\nthe input image. Thus far this has been assessed visually, introducing visual\nbias. We propose the application of the mean structural similarity index\n(MSSIM) as a mathematical goodness-of-fit measure. We describe the use of the\nMSSIM to find the output skeletons most mathematically similar to the original\ninput image (the optimum, or `best', skeletons) for a given algorithm, and\nindependently of the algorithm. This measure makes possible systematic\nparameter studies, aimed at finding the subset of input parameter values\nreturning optimum skeletons. It can also be applied to the output of\nnon-skeleton based filament identification algorithms, such as the Hessian\nmatrix method. The MSSIM removes the need to visually examine thousands of\noutput skeletons, and eliminates the visual bias, subjectivity, and limited\nreproducibility inherent in that process, representing a major improvement on\nexisting techniques. Importantly, it also allows further automation in the\npost-processing of output skeletons, which is crucial in this era of `big\ndata'.\n", "  Friction in ordered atomistic layers plays a central role in various\nnanoscale systems ranging from nanomachines to biological systems. It governs\ntransport properties, wear and dissipation. Defects and incommensurate lattice\nconstants dramatically change these properties. Recently experimental systems\nhave become accessible to probe the dynamics of nanofriction. Here, we present\na model system consisting of laser-cooled ions in which nanofriction and\ntransport processes in self-organized systems with back action can be studied\nwith atomic resolution. We show that in a system with local defects resulting\nin incommensurate layers, there is a transition from sticking to sliding with\nAubry-type signatures. We demonstrate spectroscopic measurements of the soft\nvibrational mode driving this transition and a measurement of the order\nparameter. We show numerically that both exhibit critical scaling near the\ntransition point. Our studies demonstrate a simple, well-controlled system in\nwhich friction in self-organized structures can be studied from classical- to\nquantum-regimes.\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are eruptive events that cause a solar-type\nstar to shed mass and magnetic flux. CMEs tend to occur together with flares,\nradio storms, and bursts of energetic particles. On the Sun, CME-related mass\nloss is roughly an order of magnitude less intense than that of the background\nsolar wind. However, on other types of stars, CMEs have been proposed to carry\naway much more mass and energy than the time-steady wind. Earlier papers have\nused observed correlations between solar CMEs and flare energies, in\ncombination with stellar flare observations, to estimate stellar CME rates.\nThis paper sidesteps flares and attempts to calibrate a more fundamental\ncorrelation between surface-averaged magnetic fluxes and CME properties. For\nthe Sun, there exists a power-law relationship between the magnetic filling\nfactor and the CME kinetic energy flux, and it is generalized for use on other\nstars. An example prediction of the time evolution of wind/CME mass-loss rates\nfor a solar-mass star is given. A key result is that for ages younger than\nabout 1 Gyr (i.e., activity levels only slightly higher than the present-day\nSun), the CME mass loss exceeds that of the time-steady wind. At younger ages,\nCMEs carry 10 to 100 times more mass than the wind, and such high rates may be\npowerful enough to dispel circumstellar disks and affect the habitability of\nnearby planets. The cumulative CME mass lost by the young Sun may have been as\nmuch as 1% of a solar mass.\n", "  Recent photometric studies have revealed that surface spots that produce flux\nvariations are present on virtually all L and T dwarfs. Their likely magnetic\nor dusty nature has been a much-debated problem, the resolution to which has\nbeen hindered by paucity of diagnostic multi-wavelength observations. To test\nfor a correlation between magnetic activity and photometric variability, we\nsearched for H$\\alpha$ emission among eight L3$-$T2 ultra-cool dwarfs with\nextensive previous photometric monitoring, some of which are known to be\nvariable at 3.6 $\\mu$m or 4.5 $\\mu$m. We detected H$\\alpha$ only in the\nnon-variable T2 dwarf 2MASS J12545393$-$0122474. The remaining seven objects do\nnot show H$\\alpha$ emission, even though six of them are known to vary\nphotometrically. Combining our results with those for 86 other L and T dwarfs\nfrom the literature show that the detection rate of H$\\alpha$ emission is very\nhigh (94$\\%$) for spectral types between L0 and L3.5 and much smaller (20$\\%$)\nfor spectral types $\\ge$L4, while the detection rate of photometric variability\nis approximately constant (30$\\%-$55$\\%$) from L0 to T8 dwarfs. We conclude\nthat chromospheric activity, as evidenced by H$\\alpha$ emission, and\nlarge-amplitude photometric variability are not correlated. Consequently, dust\nclouds are the dominant driver of the observed variability of ultra-cool dwarfs\nat spectral types at least as early as L0.\n", "  In the present work we study the consequences of considering a new family of\nsingle-field inflation models, called power-law plateau inflation, in the warm\ninflation framework. We consider the inflationary expansion is driven by a\nstandard scalar field with a decay ratio $\\Gamma$ having a generic power-law\ndependence with the scalar field $\\phi$ and the temperature of the thermal bath\n$T$ given by $\\Gamma(\\phi,T)=C_{\\phi}\\,\\frac{T^m}{\\phi^{m-1}}$. Assuming that\nour model evolves according to the strong dissipative regime, we study the\nbackground and perturbative dynamics, obtaining the most relevant inflationary\nobservables as the scalar power spectrum, the scalar spectral index and its\nrunning, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The free parameters characterizing our\nmodel are constrained by considering the essential condition for warm\ninflation, the conditions for the model evolves according to the strong\ndissipative regime, and the 2015 Planck results through the $n_s-r$ plane. For\ncompleteness, we study the predictions in the $n_s-dn_s/d\\ln k$ plane. The\nmodel is consistent with a strong dissipative dynamics and predicts values for\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio and for the running of the scalar spectral index\nconsistent with current bounds imposed by Planck, and we conclude that the\nmodel is viable.\n", "  We report on a technique for applying a DC bias in a 3D microwave cavity. We\nachieve this by isolating the two halves of the cavity with a dielectric and\ndirectly using them as DC electrodes. As a proof of concept, we embed a\nvariable capacitance diode in the cavity and tune the resonant frequency with a\nDC voltage, demonstrating the incorporation of a DC bias into the 3D cavity\nwith no measurable change in its quality factor at room temperature. We also\ncharacterize the architecture at millikelvin temperatures and show that the\nsplit cavity design maintains a quality factor $Q_\\text{i} \\sim 8.8 \\times\n10^5$, making it promising for future quantum applications.\n", "  The chiral magnet Cu$_{2}$OSeO$_{3}$ hosts a skyrmion lattice, that may be\nequivalently described as a superposition of plane waves or lattice of\nparticle-like topological objects. A thermal gradient may break up the skyrmion\nlattice and induce rotating domains raising the question which of these\nscenarios better describes the violent dynamics at the domain boundaries. Here\nwe show that in an inhomogeneous temperature gradient caused by illumination in\na Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscope different parts of the skyrmion\nlattice can be set into motion with different angular velocities. Tracking the\ntime dependence we show that the constant rearrangement of domain walls is\ngoverned by dynamic 5-7 defects arranging into lines. An analysis of the\nassociated defect density is described by Frank's equation and agrees well with\nclassical 2D-Monte Carlo simulations. Fluctuations of boundaries show\nsurge-like rearrangement of skyrmion clusters driven by defect rearrangement\nconsistent with simulations treating skyrmions as point particles. Our findings\nunderline the particle character of the skyrmion.\n", "  We characterize the near-infrared (NIR) dust attenuation for a sample of\n~5500 local (z<0.1) star-forming galaxies and obtain an estimate of their\naverage total-to-selective attenuation $k(\\lambda)$. We utilize data from the\nUnited Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) and the Two Micron All-Sky Survey\n(2MASS), which is combined with previously measured UV-optical data for these\ngalaxies. The average attenuation curve is slightly lower in the far-UV than\nlocal starburst galaxies, by roughly 15%, but appears similar at longer\nwavelengths with a total-to-selective normalization at V-band of\n$R_V=3.67\\substack{+0.44 \\\\ -0.35}$. Under the assumption of energy balance,\nthe total attenuated energy inferred from this curve is found to be broadly\nconsistent with the observed infrared dust emission ($L_{\\rm{TIR}}$) in a small\nsample of local galaxies for which far-IR measurements are available. However,\nthe significant scatter in this quantity among the sample may reflect large\nvariations in the attenuation properties of individual galaxies. We also derive\nthe attenuation curve for sub-populations of the main sample, separated\naccording to mean stellar population age (via $D_n4000$), specific star\nformation rate, stellar mass, and metallicity, and find that they show only\ntentative trends with low significance, at least over the range which is probed\nby our sample. These results indicate that a single curve is reasonable for\napplications seeking to broadly characterize large samples of galaxies in the\nlocal Universe, while applications to individual galaxies would yield large\nuncertainties and is not recommended.\n", "  By considering that the weak currents and the electromagnetic current are\nmembers of the same SU(3) octet, two sum rules involving leading vector form\nfactors in hyperon semileptonic decays are derived in the limit of exact flavor\nSU(3) symmetry. Deviations from this limit arise from second-order SU(3)\nsymmetry-breaking effects, according to the Ademollo-Gatto theorem. The 1/N_c\nexpansion of QCD is used to evaluate such effects. One sum rule vanishes\nidentically even in the presence of symmetry breaking and the other one obtains\ncontributions mainly from the 10+\\overline{10} representation. Results obtained\nin (heavy) baryon chiral perturbation theory are used to test the validity of\nthese sum rules. To order O(p^2) in the chiral expansion, results are\nencouraging.\n", "  We propose a continuum model to predict long-wavelength vibrational modes of\nempty and liquid-filled tubules that are very hard to reproduce using the\nconventional force-constant matrix approach based on atomistic ab initio\ncalculation. We derive simple quantitative expressions for long-wavelength\nlongitudinal and torsional acoustic modes, flexural acoustic modes, as well as\nthe radial breathing mode of empty or liquid-filled tubular structures that are\nbased on continuum elasticity theory expressions for a thin elastic plate. We\nfurthermore show that longitudinal and flexural acoustic modes of tubules are\nwell described by those of an elastic beam resembling a nanowire. Our numerical\nresults for biological microtubules and carbon nanotubes agree with available\nexperimental data.\n", "  The spreading of a cap-shaped spherical droplet on a completely wettable\nspherical substrate is studied. The non-equilibrium thermodynamic formulation\nis used to derive the thermodynamic driving force of spreading including the\nline-tension effect. Then the energy balance approach is adopted to derive the\nevolution equation of the spreading droplet. The time evolution of the contact\nangle $\\theta$ of a droplet obeys a power law $\\theta \\sim t^{-\\alpha}$ with\nthe exponent $\\alpha$, which is different from that derived from Tanner's law\non a flat substrate. Furthermore, the line tension must be positive to promote\ncomplete wetting on a spherical substrate, while it must be negative on a flat\nsubstrate.\n", "  (144977) 2005 EC127 is an V-/A-type inner-main-belt asteroid with a diameter\nof 0.6 +- 0.1 km. Asteroids of this size are believed to have rubble-pile\nstructure, and, therefore, cannot have a rotation period shorter than 2.2\nhours. However, our measurements show that asteroid 2005 EC127 completes one\nrotation in 1.65 +- 0.01 hours with a peak-to-peak light-curve variation of\n~0.5 mag. Therefore, this asteroid is identified as a large super-fast rotator.\nEither a rubble-pile asteroid with a bulk density of ~6 g cm^-3 or an asteroid\nwith an internal cohesion of 47 +- 30 Pa can explain 2005 EC127. However, the\nscenario of high bulk density is very unlikely for asteroids. To date, only six\nlarge super-fast rotators, including 2005 EC127, have been reported, and this\nnumber is very small when compared with the much more numerous fast rotators.\nWe also note that none of the six reported large SFRs are classified as C-type\nasteroids.\n", "  We further progress along the line of Ref. [Phys. Rev. {\\bf A 94}, 043614\n(2016)] where a functional for Fermi systems with anomalously large $s$-wave\nscattering length $a_s$ was proposed that has no free parameters. The\nfunctional is designed to correctly reproduce the unitary limit in Fermi gases\ntogether with the leading-order contributions in the s- and p-wave channels at\nlow density. The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities\n$\\sim0.01$ fm$^{-3}$ that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang\nfunctional, valid for $\\rho < 10^{-6}$ fm$^{-3}$. The form of the functional\nretained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional\ncorresponds to an expansion of the energy in $(a_s k_F)$ and $(r_e k_F)$ to all\norders, where $r_e$ is the effective range and $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum. One\nconclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density\nregime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in $-(a_s k_F)^{-1}$ with\nrespect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce\ndensity--dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare\ninteraction are strongly renormalized by medium effects. As a consequence, some\nof the scales at play around saturation are dominated by the unitary gas\nproperties and not directly to low-energy constants. For instance, we show that\nthe scale in the s-wave channel around saturation is proportional to the\nso-called Bertsch parameter $\\xi_0$ and becomes independent of $a_s$. We also\npoint out that these scales are of the same order of magnitude than those\nempirically obtained in the Skyrme energy density functional. We finally\npropose a slight modification of the functional such that it becomes accurate\nup to the saturation density $\\rho\\simeq 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$.\n", "  We present the results of our radio interferometric observations of pulsars\nat 325 MHz and 610 MHz using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We\nused the imaging method to estimate the flux densities of several pulsars at\nthese radio frequencies. The analysis of the shapes of the pulsar spectra\nallowed us to identify five new gigahertz-peaked spectra (GPS) pulsars. Using\nthe hypothesis that the spectral turnovers are caused by thermal free-free\nabsorption in the interstellar medium, we modeled the spectra of all known\nobjects of this kind. Using the model, we were able to put some observational\nconstrains on the physical parameters of the absorbing matter, which allows us\nto distinguish between the possible sources of absorption. We also discuss the\npossible effects of the existence of GPS pulsars on future search surveys,\nshowing that the optimal frequency range for finding such objects would be from\na few GHz (for regular GPS sources) to possibly 10 GHz for pulsars and\nradio-magnetars exhibiting very strong absorption.\n", "  An attempt is made in order to clarify the so called regular black holes\nissue. It is revisited that if one works within General Relativity minimally\ncoupled with non linear source, mainly of electromagnetic origin, and within a\nstatic spherically symmetric ansatz for the metric, there is still room for\nsingular contribution to the black hole solution. A reconstruction method is\nproposed and several examples are discussed, including new ones. A possible way\nto obtain a non singular black hole is introduced, and in this case, several\nknown examples are re-discussed, and new ones are provided.\n", "  Using patterns in the oscillation frequencies of a white dwarf observed by\nK2, we have measured the fastest rotation rate, 1.13(02) hr, of any isolated\npulsating white dwarf known to date. Balmer-line fits to follow-up spectroscopy\nfrom the SOAR telescope show that the star (SDSSJ0837+1856, EPIC 211914185) is\na 13,590(340) K, 0.87(03) solar-mass white dwarf. This is the highest mass\nmeasured for any pulsating white dwarf with known rotation, suggesting a\npossible link between high mass and fast rotation. If it is the product of\nsingle-star evolution, its progenitor was a roughly 4.0 solar-mass\nmain-sequence B star; we know very little about the angular momentum evolution\nof such intermediate-mass stars. We explore the possibility that this rapidly\nrotating white dwarf is the byproduct of a binary merger, which we conclude is\nunlikely given the pulsation periods observed.\n", "  We present a multiwavelength investigation of a region of a nearby giant\nmolecular cloud that is distinguished by a minimal level of star formation\nactivity. With our new 12CO(J=2-1) and 13CO(J=2-1) observations of a remote\nregion within the middle of the California molecular cloud, we aim to\ninvestigate the relationship between filaments, cores, and a molecular outflow\nin a relatively pristine environment. An extinction map of the region from\nHerschel Space Observatory observations reveals the presence of two 2-pc-long\nfilaments radiating from a high-extinction clump. Using the 13CO observations,\nwe show that the filaments have coherent velocity gradients and that their\nmass-per-unit-lengths may exceed the critical value above which filaments are\ngravitationally unstable. The region exhibits structure with eight cores, at\nleast one of which is a starless, prestellar core. We identify a low-velocity,\nlow-mass molecular outflow that may be driven by a flat spectrum protostar. The\noutflow does not appear to be responsible for driving the turbulence in the\ncore with which it is associated, nor does it provide significant support\nagainst gravitational collapse.\n", "  We investigate the production and absorption of $Z_b (10610)$ and $Z_b\n^{\\prime}(10650)$ states in a hadronic medium, via the processes\n  $\\bar{B}^{(*)} B^{(*)} \\rightarrow \\pi Z_b ^{(\\prime)} $ and the\ncorresponding inverses reactions. We use effective field Lagrangians based on\nan $SU(4)$-extension of the hidden gauge formalism to account for the couplings\nbetween light and heavy mesons, and a phenomenological Lagrangian involving the\n$ B^{\\ast} B^{(\\ast)} Z_b ^{(\\prime)}$ vertices. The absorption cross sections\nare found to be much larger than the production ones.\n", "  The interaction of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with the hot gas in\nclusters of galaxies, the so-called Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, is a very\nuseful tool that allows us to determine the physical conditions in such\nclusters and fundamental parameters of the cosmological models. In this work,\nwe determine the dependence of the the SZ surface brightness amplitude with\nredshift and mass of the clusters. We have used PLANCK+IRAS data in the\nmicrowave-far infrared and a catalog with >10^5 clusters of galaxies extracted\nfrom the SDSS by Wen et al. (2012). We estimate and subtract the dust emission\nfrom those clusters. From the residual flux, we extract its SZ flux densities.\n  The absolute value of the SZ amplitude indicates that the gas mass is around\n10% of the total mass for cluster masses of M~10^{14} M_sun. This amplitude is\ncompatible with no evolution with redshift and proportional to M^{2.70+/-0.37}\n(using X-ray derived masses) or M^{2.51+/-0.38} (using weak-lensing derived\nmasses), with some tension regarding the expectations of the self-similar\ndependence (amplitude proportional to M^{5/3}).\n  Other secondary products of our analysis include that clusters have a dust\nemission with emissivity index beta~2 and temperature T~25 K; we confirm that\nthe CMB temperature agrees with a dependence of T_0(1+z) with clusters of much\nlower mass than those explored previously; and we find that the cluster masses\nderived by Wen et al. (2012) from a richness-mass relationship are biased by a\nfactor of (1+z)^{-1.8} with respect to the X-ray and weak-lensing measurements.\n", "  BIGHORNS is a total power radiometer developed to identify the signal from\nthe Epoch of Reionisation in the all-sky averaged radio spectrum at low\nfrequencies (70-300 MHz). In October 2014, the system with a conical log spiral\nantenna was deployed at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) and has\nbeen collecting data since then. The system has been monitoring the radio\nfrequency interference (RFI) environment at the future site of the\nlow-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array. We have analyzed almost\ntwo years of data (October 2014 - August 2016 inclusive) in search for events\nof long distance propagation of the RFI in FM and digital TV bands due to\ntropospheric ducting and reflections (of the meteor trails or aircraft). We\npresent statistics of tropospheric ducting events observed in the digital TV\nband over nearly two years, which shows seasonal changes. We also present a\nsystem using upper atmosphere data (temperature, humidity and pressure as a\nfunction of altitude) from all stations in Western Australia to calculate the\nmodified refractive index and make predictions of tropospheric ducting events.\nPreliminary tests indicate that the system can be very useful in predicting\ntropospheric ducting events (even with limited amount of available upper\natmosphere data).\n", "  Recent state-of-the-art calculations of A-values and electron impact\nexcitation rates for Fe III are used in conjunction with the Cloudy modeling\ncode to derive emission line intensity ratios for optical transitions among the\nfine-structure levels of the 3d$^6$ configuration. A comparison of these with\nhigh resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of gaseous nebulae reveals that\nprevious discrepancies found between theory and observation are not fully\nresolved by the latest atomic data. Blending is ruled out as a likely cause of\nthe discrepancies, because temperature- and density-independent ratios (arising\nfrom lines with common upper levels) match well with those predicted by theory.\nFor a typical nebular plasma with electron temperature $T_{\\rm e} = 9000$ K and\nelectron density $\\rm N_{e}=10^4 \\, cm^{-3}$, cascading of electrons from the\nlevels $\\rm ^3G_5$, $\\rm ^3G_4$ and $\\rm ^3G_3$ plays an important role in\ndetermining the populations of lower levels, such as $\\rm ^3F_4$, which provide\nthe density diagnostic emission lines of Fe III, such as $\\rm ^5D_4$ - $\\rm\n^3F_4$ at 4658 \\AA. Hence further work on the A-values for these transitions is\nrecommended, ideally including measurements if possible. However, some Fe III\nratios do provide reliable $N_{\\rm e}$-diagnostics, such as 4986/4658. The Fe\nIII cooling function calculated with Cloudy using the most recent atomic data\nis found to be significantly greater at $T_e$ $\\simeq$ 30000 K than predicted\nwith the existing Cloudy model. This is due to the presence of additional\nemission lines with the new data, particularly in the 1000--4000 \\AA\\\nwavelength region.\n", "  In this note, we present a construction of new nonbinary quantum codes with\ngood parameters. These codes are obtained by applying the\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction. In order to do this, we show the\nexistence of (classical) cyclic codes whose defining set consists of only one\ncyclotomic coset containing at least two consecutive integers.\n", "  We report the discovery of a very large thermoelectric power over -400 microV\nK-1 in the whisker crystals of a one-dimensional telluride Ta4SiTe4, while\nmaintaining a low electrical resistivity of rho = 2 mohm cm, yielding a very\nlarge power factor of P = 80 microW cm-1 K-2 at an optimum temperature of 130\nK. This temperature is widely controlled from the cryogenic temperature of 50 K\nto room temperature by chemical doping, resulting in the largest P of 170\nmicroW cm-1 K-2 at 220-280 K. These P values far exceed those of the\nBi2Te3-Sb2Te3 alloys at around room temperature, offering an avenue for\nrealizing the practical-level thermoelectric cooling at low temperatures. The\ncoexistence of a one-dimensional electronic structure and a very small band gap\nappearing in the vicinity of the Dirac semimetals probably causes the very\nlarge power factors in Ta4SiTe4, indicating that the \"one-dimensional Dirac\nsemimetal\" is a promising way to find high-performance thermoelectric materials\nfor the low temperature applications.\n", "  The electric coupling between surface ions and bulk ferroelectricity gives\nrise to a continuum of mixed states in ferroelectric thin films, exquisitely\nsensitive to temperature and external factors, such as applied voltage and\noxygen pressure. Here we develop the comprehensive analytical description of\nthese coupled ferroelectric and ionic (\"ferroionic\") states by combining the\nGinzburg-Landau-Devonshire description of the ferroelectric properties of the\nfilm with Langmuir adsorption model for the electrochemical reaction at the\nfilm surface. We explore the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the\nferroionic states as a function of temperature, film thickness, and external\nelectric potential. These studies provide a new insight into mesoscopic\nproperties of ferroelectric thin films, whose surface is exposed to chemical\nenvironment as screening charges supplier.\n", "  The interplay between electrochemical surface charges and bulk\nferroelectricity in thin films gives rise to a continuum of coupled ferro-ionic\nstates. These states are exquisitely sensitive to chemical and electric\nconditions at the surfaces, applied voltage, and oxygen pressure. Using the\nanalytical approach combining the Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire description of the\nferroelectricity with Langmuir adsorption isotherm for the ions at the film\nsurface, we have studied the temperature-, time- and field- dependent\npolarization changes and electromechanical response of the ferro-ionic states.\nThe responses are found to be inseparable in thermodynamic equilibrium and at\nlow frequencies of applied voltage. The states become separable in high\nfrequency dynamic mode due to the several orders of magnitude difference in the\nrelaxation times of ferroelectric polarization and surface ions charge density.\nThese studies provide an insight into dynamic behavior of nanoscale\nferroelectrics with open surface exposed to different kinds of\nelectrochemically active gaseous surrounding.\n", "  The binary system AR Sco contains an M star and the only known radio-pulsing\nwhite dwarf. The system shows emission from radio to X-rays, likely dominated\nby synchrotron radiation. The mechanism that produces most of this emission\nremains unclear. Two competing scenarios have been proposed: Collimated\noutflows, and direct interaction between the magnetospheres of the white dwarf\nand the M star. The two proposed scenarios can be tested via very long baseline\ninterferometric radio observations. We conducted a radio observation with the\nAustralian Long Baseline Array (LBA) on 20 Oct 2016 at 8.5 GHz to study the\ncompactness of the radio emission. Simultaneous data with the Australian\nTelescope Compact Array (ATCA) were also recorded for a direct comparison of\nthe obtained flux densities. AR Sco shows radio emission compact on\nmilliarcsecond angular scales ($\\lesssim 0.02\\ \\mathrm{AU}$, or $4\\\n\\mathrm{R_{\\odot}}$). The emission is orbitally modulated, with an average flux\ndensity of $\\approx 6.5\\ \\mathrm{mJy}$. A comparison with the simultaneous ATCA\ndata shows that no flux is resolved out on mas scales, implying that the radio\nemission is produced in this compact region. Additionally, the obtained radio\nlight curves on hour timescales are consistent with the optical light curve.\nThe radio emission in AR Sco is likely produced in the magnetosphere of the M\nstar or the white dwarf, and we see no evidence for a radio outflow or\ncollimated jets significantly contributing to the radio emission.\n", "  We re-visit the principles of transmission spectroscopy for transiting\nextrasolar planets, focusing on the overlap between the planetary spectrum and\nthe illuminating stellar spectrum. Virtually all current models of exoplanetary\ntransmission spectra utilize an approximation that is inaccurate when the\nspectrum of the illuminating star has a complex line structure, such as\nmolecular bands in M-dwarf spectra. In those cases, it is desirable to model\nthe observations using a coupled stellar-planetary radiative transfer model\ncalculated at high spectral resolving power, followed by convolution to the\nobserved resolution. Not consistently accounting for overlap of stellar M-dwarf\nand planetary lines at high spectral resolution can bias the modeled amplitude\nof the exoplanetary transmission spectrum, producing modeled absorption that is\ntoo strong. We illustrate this bias using the exoplanet TRAPPIST-1b, as\nobserved using HST/WFC3. The bias in this case is about 250 parts-per-million,\n12% of the modeled transit absorption. Transit spectroscopy using JWST will\nhave access to longer wavelengths where the water bands are intrinsically\nstronger, and the observed signal-to-noise ratios will be higher than currently\npossible. We therefore expect that this resolution-linked bias will be\nespecially important for future JWST observations of TESS-discovered\nsuper-Earths and mini Neptunes transiting M-dwarfs.\n", "  Nuclear spirals are ubiquitous in galaxy centers. They exist not only in\nstrong barred galaxies but also in galaxies without noticeable bars. We use\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations to study the properties of nuclear gas\nspirals driven by weak bar-like and oval potentials. The amplitude of the\nspirals increases toward the center by a geometric effect, readily developing\ninto shocks at small radii even for very weak potentials. The shape of the\nspirals and shocks depends rather sensitively on the background shear. When\nshear is low, the nuclear spirals are loosely wound and the shocks are almost\nstraight, resulting in large mass inflows toward the center. When shear is\nhigh, on the other hand, the spirals are tightly wound and the shocks are\noblique, forming a circumnuclear disk through which gas flows inward at a\nrelatively lower rate. The induced mass inflow rates are enough to power black\nhole accretion in various types of Seyfert galaxies as well as to drive\nsupersonic turbulence at small radii.\n", "  We present recent improvements in the simulation of regolith sampling\nprocesses in microgravity using the numerical particle method smooth particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH). We use an elastic-plastic soil constitutive model for\nlarge deformation and failure flows for dynamical behaviour of regolith. In the\ncontext of projected small body (asteroid or small moons) sample return\nmissions, we investigate the efficiency and feasibility of a particular\nmaterial sampling method: Brushes sweep material from the asteroid's surface\ninto a collecting tray. We analyze the influence of different material\nparameters of regolith such as cohesion and angle of internal friction on the\nsampling rate. Furthermore, we study the sampling process in two environments\nby varying the surface gravity (Earth's and Phobos') and we apply different\nrotation rates for the brushes. We find good agreement of our sampling\nsimulations on Earth with experiments and provide estimations for the influence\nof the material properties on the collecting rate.\n", "  The nonlinear sigma model targeted on the coset supermanifold\n$CP^{1|1}=SU(2|1)/U(1|1)$ is derived in an attempt to describe the\nquasiclassical low-energy effective action for the doped $t-J$ model at the\nSUSY point, $J=2t.$ In spite of the fact that the supermanifold $CP^{1|1}$\nindeed appears as the phase space of the strongly correlated electrons, the\ncanonical $CP^{1|1}$ nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) is unable to capture the\nphysics of strong correlations displayed by the SUSY $t-J$ model at any finite\ndoping. This is due to the fact that, in this regime, the doping itself cannot\nbe self-consistently incorporated into the $CP^{1|1}$ NLSM. \\end{abstract}\n", "  We report the results of a characterization study of several types of\ncryogenic photomultipliers manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics and intended for\noperation in liquid Ar conditions, namely: compact 2-inch R6041-506MOD tubes,\n3-inch R11065-10 and R11065-MOD tubes for operation in liquid Ar and 3-inch\nR11410-20 tubes originally designed for operation in liquid Xe. These types of\nPMT are proposed for installation into the future two-phase cryogenic avalanche\ndetector that is developed in the Laboratory of Cosmology and Particle Physics\nof the Novosibirsk State University jointly with the Budker Institute of\nNuclear Physics. Eight R11065 PMTs and seven R11410-20 tubes were tested and\nall demonstrated excellent performance in liquid Ar in terms of gain and\nrelative single electron efficiency. All 3-inch PMTs showed a maximal gain in\nliquid Ar above 5x10^6 and relative single electron efficiency higher than 95%.\nCompact R6041-506MOD tubes have dynode system different from that of the 3-inch\nphotomultipliers and thus their single electron energy resolution and relative\nefficiency is much worse than that of 3-inch tubes. From 21 2-inch PMTs only 12\ntubes were selected with acceptable, i.e. higher than 75%, relative single\nelectron efficiency and the maximal gain higher than 5x10^6. However, these\nPMTs are very attractive because they are the only compact type of tubes that\ncan operate in liquid Ar.\n", "  We present, for the first time, simultaneous determination of shear viscosity\n($\\eta$) and entropy density ($s$) and thus, $\\eta/s$ for equilibrated nuclear\nsystems from $A$ $\\sim$ 30 to $A$ $\\sim$ 208 at different temperatures. At\nfinite temperature, $\\eta$ is estimated by utilizing the $\\gamma$ decay of the\nisovector giant dipole resonance populated via fusion evaporation reaction,\nwhile $s$ is evaluated from the nuclear level density parameter (${a}$) and\nnuclear temperature ($T$), determined precisely by the simultaneous\nmeasurements of the evaporated neutron energy spectra and the compound nuclear\nangular momenta. The transport parameter $\\eta$ and the thermodynamic parameter\n$s$ both increase with temperature resulting in a mild decrease of $\\eta$/$s$\nwith temperature. The extracted $\\eta$/$s$ is also found to be independent of\nthe neutron-proton asymmetry at a given temperature. Interestingly, the\nmeasured $\\eta$/$s$ values are comparable to that of the high-temperature\nquark-gluon plasma, pointing towards the fact that strong fluidity may be the\nuniversal feature of the strong interaction of many-body quantum systems.\n", "  A study of parameter sensitivity of nuclear energy density functionals,\ninitiated in the first part of this work \\cite{NV.16}, is extended by the\ninclusion of data on ground-state properties of finite nuclei in the\napplication of the manifold boundary approximation method (MBAM). Density\nfunctionals used in self-consistent mean-field calculations, and nuclear\nstructure models based on them, are generally \"sloppy\" and exhibit an\nexponential range of sensitivity to parameter variations. Concepts of\ninformation geometry are used to identify the presence of effective functionals\nof lower dimension in parameter space associated with parameter combinations\nthat can be tightly constrained by data. The MBAM is used in an iterative\nprocedure that systematically reduces the complexity and the dimension of\nparameter space of a sloppy functional, with properties of nuclear matter and\ndata on finite nuclei determining not only the values of model parameters, but\nalso the optimal functional form of the density dependence.\n", "  We report measurements of the in-plane London penetration depth $\\lambda$ in\nsingle crystals of the $\\alpha$-PdBi$_{2}$ superconductor --- the\n$\\alpha$-phase counterpart of the putative topological superconductor\n$\\beta$-PdBi$_{2}$, down to 0.35~K using a high-resolution tunnel-diode-based\ntechnique. Both $\\lambda$ and superfluid density $\\rho_{s}$ exhibit an\nexponential behavior for $T\\leq$ 0.35$T_{c}$, with\n$\\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\\sim$2.0, $\\Delta C/\\gamma T_{c}$$\\sim$2.0 and\n$\\lambda(0)$$\\sim$140~nm, showing that $\\alpha$-PdBi$_{2}$ is a\nmoderately-coupling, fully-gapped superconductor. The values of $\\Delta(0)$ and\n$\\Delta C/\\gamma T_{c}$ are consistent with each other via strong-coupling\ncorrections.\n", "  Chariklo is the only small Solar system body confirmed to have rings. Given\nthe instability of its orbit, the presence of rings is surprising, and their\norigin remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the dynamical history\nof the Chariklo system by integrating almost 36,000 Chariklo clones backwards\nin time for one Gyr under the influence of the Sun and the four giant planets.\nBy recording all close encounters between the clones and planets, we\ninvestigate the likelihood that Chariklo's rings could have survived since its\ncapture to the Centaur population. Our results reveal that Chariklo's orbit\noccupies a region of stable chaos, resulting in its orbit being marginally more\nstable than those of the other Centaurs. Despite this, we find that it was most\nlikely captured to the Centaur population within the last 20 Myr, and that its\norbital evolution has been continually punctuated by regular close encounters\nwith the giant planets. The great majority (> 99%) of those encounters within\none Hill radius of the planet have only a small effect on the rings. We\nconclude that close encounters with giant planets have not had a significant\neffect on the ring structure. Encounters within the Roche limit of the giant\nplanets are rare, making ring creation through tidal disruption unlikely.\n", "  Several Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) have been extensively studied, both in\nterms of the progenitor radius and the mass-loss rate in the final centuries\nbefore the explosion. While the sample is still limited, evidence has been\naccumulating that the final mass-loss rate tends to be larger for a more\nextended progenitor, with the difference exceeding an order of magnitude\nbetween the more and less extended progenitors. The high mass-loss rates\ninferred for the more extended progenitors are not readily explained by a\nprescription commonly used for a single stellar wind. In this paper, we\ncalculate a grid of binary evolution models. We show that the observational\nrelation in the progenitor radii and mass-loss rates may be a consequence of\nnon-conservative mass transfer in the final phase of progenitor evolution\nwithout fine tuning. Further, we find a possible link between SNe IIb and SNe\nIIn. The binary scenario for SNe IIb inevitably leads to a population of SN\nprogenitors surrounded by dense circumstellar matter (CSM) due to extensive\nmass loss ($\\dot{M} \\gtrsim 10^{-4} M_{\\odot} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) in the binary\norigin. About 4% of all observed SNe IIn are predicted to have dense CSM,\nproduced by binary non-conservative mass transfer, whose observed\ncharacteristics are distinguishable from SNe IIn from other scenarios. Indeed,\nsuch SNe may be observationally dominated by systems experiencing huge mass\nloss in the final $10^3$ yr, leading to luminous SNe IIn or initially bright\nSNe IIP or IIL with characteristics of SNe IIn in their early spectra.\n", "  We explore the temporal relationship between microwave/HXR emission and\nDoppler velocity during the impulsive phase of a solar flare on 2014 October 27\n(SOL2014-10-27), which displays a pulse on the light curves in microwave (34\nGHz) and hard X-ray (HXR, 25-50 keV) bands before the flare maximum. Imaging\nobservation shows that this pulse mainly comes from one footpoint of a solar\nflare loop. The slit of Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) stays at\nthis footpoint during this solar flare. The Doppler velocities of Fe XXI\n1354.09 A and Si IV 1402.77 A are extracted from the Gaussian fitting method.\nWe find that the hot line of Fe XXI 1354.09 A (logT~7.05) in corona exhibits\nblue shift, while the cool line of Si IV 1402.77 A (logT~4.8) in transition\nregion exhibits red shift, indicating explosive chromospheric evaporation. The\nevaporative upflows along the flare loop are also observed in the AIA 131 A\nimage. To our knowledge, this is the first report of chromospheric evaporation\nevidence from both spectral and imaging observations in the same flare. Both\nmicrowave and HXR pulses are well correlated with the Doppler velocities,\nsuggesting that the chromospheric evaporation is driven by nonthermal electrons\naround this footpoint of a solar flare loop.\n", "  Searching for two-dimensional (2D) realistic materials able to realize\nroom-temperature quantum spin Hall (QSH) effects is currently a growing field.\nHere, we through ab initio calculations to identify arsenene oxide, AsO, as an\nexcellent candidate, which demonstrates high stability, flexibility, and\ntunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) gaps. In contrast to known pristine or\nfunctionalized arsenene, the maximum nontrivial band gap of AsO reaches 89 meV,\nand can be further enhanced to 130 meV under biaxial strain. By sandwiching 2D\nAsO between BN sheets, we propose a quantum well in which the band topology of\nAsO is preserved with a sizeable band gap. Considering that AsO having fully\noxidized surfaces are naturally stable against surface oxidization and\ndegradation, this functionality provides a viable strategy for designing\ntopological quantum devices operating at room temperature.\n", "  We propose an efficient scheme for verifying quantum computations in the\n`high complexity' regime i.e. beyond the remit of classical computers.\nPreviously proposed schemes remarkably provide confidence against arbitrarily\nmalicious adversarial behaviour in the misfunctioning of the quantum computing\ndevice. Our scheme is not secure against arbitrarily adversarial behaviour, but\nmay nevertheless be sufficiently acceptable in many practical situations. With\nthis concession we gain in manifest simplicity and transparency, and in\ncontrast to previous schemes, our verifier is entirely classical. It is based\non the fact that adaptive Clifford circuits on general product state inputs\nprovide universal quantum computation, while the same processes without\nadaptation are always classically efficiently simulatable.\n", "  $Context$. The thermal structure of the penumbra below its visible surface\n(i.e., $\\tau_5 \\ge 1$) has important implications for our present understanding\nof sunspots and their penumbrae: their brightness and energy transport, mode\nconversion of magneto-acoustic waves, sunspot seismology, and so forth. $Aims$.\nWe aim at determining the thermal stratification in the layers immediately\nbeneath the visible surface of the penumbra: $\\tau_5 \\in [1,3]$ ($\\approx\n70-80$ km below the visible continuum-forming layer). $Methods$. We analyzed\nspectropolarimetric data (i.e., Stokes profiles) in three Fe \\textsc{i} lines\nlocated at 1565 nm observed with the GRIS instrument attached to the 1.5-meter\nsolar telescope GREGOR. The data are corrected for the smearing effects of\nwide-angle scattered light and then subjected to an inversion code for the\nradiative transfer equation in order to retrieve, among others, the temperature\nas a function of optical depth $T(\\tau_5)$. $Results$. We find that the\ntemperature gradient below the visible surface of the penumbra is smaller than\nin the quiet Sun. This implies that in the region $\\tau_5 \\ge 1$ the penumbral\ntemperature diverges from that of the quiet Sun. The same result is obtained\nwhen focusing only on the thermal structure below the surface of bright\npenumbral filaments. We interpret these results as evidence of a thick\npenumbra, whereby the magnetopause is not located near its visible surface. In\naddition, we find that the temperature gradient in bright penumbral filaments\nis lower than in granules. This can be explained in terms of the limited\nexpansion of a hot upflow inside a penumbral filament relative to a granular\nupflow, as magnetic pressure and tension forces from the surrounding penumbral\nmagnetic field hinder an expansion like this.\n", "  Previously, Nova Puppis 1991 (V351 Pup) was measured to host one of the most\nmassive ejections claimed in the literature. Multi-frequency radio detections\nfrom one epoch were published for this nova in the 1990's, and yet, the\nremaining data collected by the Very Large Array (VLA) have remained\nunpublished. In this paper, we analyze the remaining unpublished data sets for\nV351 Pup at frequencies of 4.9, 8.4, 14.9, and 22.5 GHz. We fit the resulting\nlight curve to a model of expanding thermal ejecta, under the assumption that\nthe radio emission is dominated by free-free radiation and accounting for high\nlevels of clumping in the ejecta. Images of V351 Pup in both the radio (from\nthe VLA) and H$\\alpha$+[N II] (from HST) exhibit no aspherical structure,\nstrengthening our assumption of spherical symmetry. From expansion parallax\nmethods, we estimate the distance to V351 Pup to be $5.0 \\pm 1.5$ kpc. Our\nlight curve fit yields a value of $log_{10}(M_{ej})={-5.2} \\pm {0.7}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ for the ejecta mass, implying that V351 Pup is on the low end of\nexpectations for ejecta mass from classical novae. A comparison between our\nderived ejecta mass and theoretical models gives evidence for a very massive\n(1.25 M$_{\\odot}$) white dwarf, which is consistent with spectroscopic evidence\nfor an oxygen-neon white dwarf.\n", "  Mercury monohalides are promising candidates for electron electric dipole\nmoment searches. This is due to their extremely large values of effective\nelectric fields, besides other attractive experimental features. We have\nelucidated the theoretical reasons of our previous work. We have also presented\na detailed analysis of our calculations, by including the most important of the\ncorrelation effects' contributions. We have also analyzed the major\ncontributions to the effective electric field, at the Dirac- Fock level, and\nidentified those atomic orbitals' mixings that contribute significantly to it.\n", "  We present spectroscopic redshifts of S(870)>2mJy submillimetre galaxies\n(SMGs) which have been identified from the ALMA follow-up observations of 870um\ndetected sources in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (the ALMA-LESS\nsurvey). We derive spectroscopic redshifts for 52 SMGs, with a median of\nz=2.4+/-0.1. However, the distribution features a high redshift tail, with ~25%\nof the SMGs at z>3. Spectral diagnostics suggest that the SMGs are young\nstarbursts, and the velocity offsets between the nebular emission and UV ISM\nabsorption lines suggest that many are driving winds, with velocity offsets up\nto 2000km/s. Using the spectroscopic redshifts and the extensive UV-to-radio\nphotometry in this field, we produce optimised spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) using Magphys, and use the SEDs to infer a median stellar mass of\nM*=(6+/-1)x10^{10}Msol for our SMGs with spectroscopic redshifts. By combining\nthese stellar masses with the star-formation rates (measured from the\nfar-infrared SEDs), we show that SMGs (on average) lie a factor ~5 above the\nmain-sequence at z~2. We provide this library of 52 template fits with robust\nand well-sampled SEDs available as a resource for future studies of SMGs, and\nalso release the spectroscopic catalog of ~2000 (mostly infrared-selected)\ngalaxies targeted as part of the spectroscopic campaign.\n", "  Selected from a sample of nine, isolated, dwarf early-type galaxies (ETGs)\nhaving the same range of kinematic properties as dwarf ETGs in clusters, we use\nCG 611 (LEDA 2108986) to address the Nature versus Nurture debate regarding the\nformation of dwarf ETGs. The presence of faint disk structures and rotation\nwithin some cluster dwarf ETGs has often been heralded as evidence that they\nwere once late-type spiral or dwarf irregular galaxies prior to experiencing a\ncluster-induced transformation into an ETG. However, CG 611 also contains\nsignificant stellar rotation (~20 km/s) over its inner half light radius,\nR_(e,maj)=0.71 kpc, and its stellar structure and kinematics resemble those of\ncluster ETGs. In addition to hosting a faint young nuclear spiral within a\npossible intermediate-scale stellar disk, CG 611 has accreted an\nintermediate-scale, counter-rotating gas disk. It is therefore apparent that\ndwarf ETGs can be built by accretion events, as opposed to disk-stripping\nscenarios. We go on to discuss how both dwarf and ordinary ETGs with\nintermediate-scale disks, whether under (de)construction or not, are not fully\nrepresented by the kinematic scaling S_0.5=sqrt{ 0.5(V_rot)^2 + sigma^2 }, and\nwe also introduce a modified spin-ellipticity diagram, lambda(R)-epsilon(R),\nwith the potential to track galaxies with such disks.\n", "  The determination of the physical entropies (R\\'enyi, Shannon, Tsallis) of\nhigh-dimensional quantum systems subject to a central potential requires the\nknowledge of the asymptotics of some power and logarithmic integral functionals\nof the hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials which control the wavefunctions of\nthe stationary states. For the $D$-dimensional hydrogenic and oscillator-like\nsystems, the wavefunctions of the corresponding bound states are controlled by\nthe Laguerre ($\\mathcal{L}_{m}^{(\\alpha)}(x)$) and Gegenbauer\n($\\mathcal{C}^{(\\alpha)}_{m}(x)$) polynomials in both position and momentum\nspaces, where the parameter $\\alpha$ linearly depends on $D$. In this work we\nstudy the asymptotic behavior as $\\alpha \\to \\infty$ of the associated\nentropy-like integral functionals of these two families of hypergeometric\npolynomials.\n", "  The global stability of laminar axisymmetric low-density jets is investigated\nin the low Mach number approximation. The linear modal dynamics is found to be\ncharacterised by two features: a stable arc branch of eigenmodes and an\nisolated eigenmode. Both features are studied in detail, revealing that,\nwhereas the former is highly sensitive to numerical domain size and its\nexistence can be linked to spurious feedback from the outflow boundary, the\nlatter is the physical eigenmode that is responsible for the appearance of\nself-sustained oscillations in low-density jets observed in experiments at low\nMach numbers. In contrast to previous local spatio-temporal stability analyses,\nthe present global analysis permits, for the first time, the determination of\nthe critical conditions for the onset of global instability, as well the\nfrequency of the associated oscillations, without additional hypotheses,\nyielding predictions in fair agreement with previous experimental observations.\nIt is shown that under the conditions of those experiments, viscosity variation\nwith composition, as well as buoyancy, only have a small effect on the onset of\ninstability.\n", "  The dynamic dielectric nonlinearity of barium strontium titanate\n(Ba1-x,Srx)TiO3 ceramics is investigated in their paraelectric phase. With the\ngoal to contribute to the identification of the mechanisms that govern the\ndielectric nonlinearity in this family, we analyze the amplitude and the phase\nangles of the first and the third harmonics of polarization. Our study shows\nthat an interpretation of the field-dependent polarization in paraelectric\n(Ba1-x,Srx)TiO3 ceramics in terms of the Rayleigh-type dynamics is inadequate\nfor our samples and that their nonlinear response rather resembles that\nobserved in canonical relaxor Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3.\n", "  In this paper we are going to review the latest estimates for the particle\nbackground expected on the X-IFU instrument onboard of the ATHENA mission. The\nparticle background is induced by two different particle populations: the so\ncalled \"soft protons\" and the Cosmic rays. The first component is composed of\nlow energy particles (< 100s keV) that get funnelled by the mirrors towards the\nfocal plane, losing part of their energy inside the filters and inducing\nbackground counts inside the instrument sensitivity band. The latter component\nis induced by high energy particles (> 100 MeV) that possess enough energy to\ncross the spacecraft and reach the detector from any direction, depositing a\nsmall fraction of their energy inside the instrument. Both these components are\nestimated using Monte Carlo simulations and the latest results are presented\nhere.\n", "  We theoretically study a scheme to develop an atomic based MW interferometry\nusing the Rydberg states in Rb. Unlike the traditional MW interferometry, this\nscheme is not based upon the electrical circuits, hence the sensitivity of the\nphase and the amplitude/strength of the MW field is not limited by the Nyquist\nthermal noise. Further this system has great advantage due to its very high\nbandwidth, ranging from radio frequency (RF), micro wave (MW) to terahertz\nregime. In addition, this is \\textbf{orders of magnitude} more sensitive to\nfield strength as compared to the prior demonstrations on the MW electrometry\nusing the Rydberg atomic states. However previously studied atomic systems are\nonly sensitive to the field strength but not to the phase and hence this scheme\nprovides a great opportunity to characterize the MW completely including the\npropagation direction and the wavefront. This study opens up a new dimension in\nthe Radar technology such as in synthetic aperture radar interferometry. The MW\ninterferometry is based upon a six-level loopy ladder system involving the\nRydberg states in which two sub-systems interfere constructively or\ndestructively depending upon the phase between the MW electric fields closing\nthe loop.\n", "  The compound SmB$_6$ is the best established realization of a topological\nKondo insulator, in which a topological insulator state is obtained through\nKondo coherence. Recent studies have found evidence that the surface of SmB$_6$\nhosts ferromagnetic domains, creating an intrinsic platform for unidirectional\nballistic transport at the domain boundaries. Here, surface-sensitive X-ray\nabsorption (XAS) and bulk-sensitive resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS)\nspectra are measured at the Sm N$_{4,5}$-edge, and used to evaluate electronic\nsymmetries, excitations and temperature dependence near the surface of cleaved\nsamples. The XAS data show that the density of large-moment atomic multiplet\nstates on a cleaved surface grows irreversibly over time, to a degree that\nlikely exceeds a related change that has recently been observed in the surface\n4f orbital occupation.\n", "  Providing a background discrimination tool is crucial for enhancing the\nsensitivity of next-generation experiments searching for neutrinoless double-\nbeta decay. The development of high-sensitivity (< 20 eV RMS) cryogenic light\ndetectors allows simultaneous read-out of the light and heat signals and\nenables background suppression through particle identification. The Cryogenic\nwide- Area Light Detector with Excellent Resolution (CALDER) R&D already proved\nthe potential of this technique using the phonon-mediated Kinetic Inductance\nDetectors (KIDs) approach. The first array prototype with 4 Aluminum KIDs on a\n2 $\\times$ 2 cm2 Silicon substrate showed a baseline resolution of 154 $\\pm$ 7\neV RMS. Improving the design and the readout of the resonator, the next CALDER\nprototype featured an energy resolution of 82 $\\pm$ 4 eV, by sampling the same\nsubstrate with a single Aluminum KID.\n", "  We study the operation of infrared photodetectors based on van der Waals\nheterostructures with the multiple graphene layers (GLs) and n-type emitter and\ncollector contacts. The operation of such GL infrared photodetectors (GLIPs) is\nassociated with the photoassisted escape of electrons from the GLs into the\ncontinuum states in the conduction band of the barrier layers due to the\ninterband photon absorption, the propagation of these electrons and the\nelectrons injected from the emitter across the heterostructure and their\ncollection by the collector contact. The space charge of the holes trapped in\nthe GLs provides a relatively strong injection and large photoelectric gain. We\ncalculate the GLIP responsivity and dark current detectivity as functions of\nthe energy of incident infrared photons and the structural parameters. It is\nshown that both the periodic selective doping of the inter-GL barrier layers\nand the GL doping lead to a pronounced variation of the GLIP spectral\ncharacteristics, particularly near the interband absorption threshold, while\nthe doping of GLs solely results in a substantial increase in the GLIP\ndetectivity. The doping \"engineering\" opens wide opportunities for the\noptimization of GLIPs for operation in different parts of radiation spectrum\nfrom near infrared to terahertz.\n", "  Entanglement production, generated by an evolution operator, is considered.\nThe measure of entanglement production, introduced earlier by one of the\nauthors, is employed. As an illustration, a two-qubit register is studied and\nthe corresponding measure of evolutional entanglement production is calculated.\nSuch two-qubit registers can be realized by atomic systems in a double well or\nby trapped atoms with two coherent modes.\n", "  The stability of the modular field in a warped brane world scenario has been\na subject of interest for a long time. Goldberger \\& Wise ( GW ) proposed a\nmechanism to achieve this by invoking a massive scalar field in the bulk\nspace-time neglecting the back-reaction. In this work, we examine the\npossibility of stabilizing the modulus without bringing in any external scalar\nfield. We show that instead of flat 3-branes as considered in Randall-Sundrum (\nRS ) warped braneworld model, if one considers a more generalized version of\nwarped geometry with de-Sitter 3-brane, then the brane vacuum energy\nautomatically leads to a modulus potential with a metastable minimum. Our\nresult further reveals that in this scenario the gauge hierarchy problem can\nalso be resolved for appropriate choice of brane cosmological constant.\n", "  We use a Monte Carlo simulation to study the diluted antiferromagnetic Ising\nmodel on the frustrated lattices including the pyrochlore lattice to show the\ndilution effects. Using the Wang-Landau algorithm, which directly calculates\nthe energy density of states, we accurately calculate the entropy of the\nsystem. We discuss the nonmonotonic dilution concentration dependence of\nresidual entropy for the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the pyrochlore\nlattice, and compare it to the generalized Pauling approximation proposed by Ke\net al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 137203 (2007)]. We also investigate other\nfrustrated systems, the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice\nand the kagome lattice, demonstrating the difference in the dilution effects\nbetween the system on the pyrochlore lattice and that on other frustrated\nlattices.\n", "  We report broadband spectral properties of the high mass X-ray binary pulsar\nSMC X-2 by using three simultaneous $NuSTAR$ and $Swift$/XRT observations\nduring its 2015 outburst. The pulsar was significantly bright, reaching a\nluminosity up to as high as $\\sim$5.5$\\times$10$^{38}$~ergs~s$^{-1}$ in 1-70\nkeV range. Spin period of the pulsar was estimated to be 2.37 s. Pulse profiles\nwere found to be strongly luminosity dependent. The 1-70 keV energy spectrum of\nthe pulsar was well described with three different continuum models such as (i)\nnegative and positive power-law with exponential cutoff, (ii) Fermi-Dirac\ncutoff power-law and (iii) cutoff power-law models. Apart from the presence of\nan iron line at $\\sim$6.4 keV, a model independent absorption like feature at\n$\\sim$27 keV was detected in the pulsar spectrum. This feature was identified\nas a cyclotron absorption line and detected for the first time in this pulsar.\nCorresponding magnetic field of the neutron star was estimated to be\n$\\sim$2.3$\\times$10$^{12}$ G. The cyclotron line energy showed a marginal\nnegative dependence on the luminosity. The cyclotron line parameters were found\nto be variable with pulse phase and interpreted as due to the effect of\nemission geometry or complicated structure of the pulsar magnetic field.\n", "  Relativistic Newtonian Dynamics, the simple model used previously for\npredicting accurately the anomalous precession of Mercury, is now applied to\npredict the periastron advance of a binary. The classical treatment of a binary\nas a two-body problem is modified to account for the influence of the\ngravitational potential on spacetime. Without curving spacetime, the model\npredicts the identical equation for the relativistic periastron advance as the\npost-Newtonian approximation of general relativity formalism thereby providing\nfurther substantiation of this model.\n", "  The current work reports the development of a new general grid generator\ncalled Gingred for arbitrary (e.g., number of X-points) 2D magnetic equilibria\nand plate geometries. A standardization of the construction of a grid is\nexplained, the main command lines are detailed, and examples of snowflake grids\nare shown. The main advantages of Gingred are the tracking of the step-by-step\nprogresses (from \"skeleton\" grids) of grid generations by non-experts and new\nusers, the ability to use an arbitrary magnetic configuration, and the more\naccurate numerical computation by bi-cubic interpolation of the magnetic flux\nrather than discrete cosine transform.\n", "  This paper presents an experimental study of different instability scenarios\nin a parallelogram-shaped internal wave attractor in a trapezoidal domain\nfilled with a uniformly stratified fluid. Energy is injected into the system\nvia the oscillatory motion of a vertical wall of the trapezoidal domain.\nWhole-field velocity measurements are performed with the conventional PIV\ntechnique. In the linear regime, the total kinetic energyof the fluid system is\nused to quantify the strength of attractors as a function of coordinates in the\nparameter spacedefining their zone of existence, the so-called Arnold tongue.\nIn the nonlinear regime, the choice of the operational point in the Arnold\ntongue is shown to have a significant impact on the scenario of the onset of\ntriadic instability, most notably on the influence of confinement on secondary\nwaves. The onset of triadic resonance instability may occur as a spatially\nlocalized event similar to Scolan, Ermanyuk and Dauxois (2013) in the case of\nstrong focusing or in form of growing normal modes as in McEwan (1971) for the\nlimiting case of rectangular domain. In the present paper, we describe also a\nnew intermediate scenario for the case of weak focusing. We explore the\nlong-term behaviour of cascades of triadic instabilities in wave attractors and\nshow a persistent trend toward formation of standing-wave patterns\ncorresponding to some discrete peaks of the frequency spectrum. At sufficiently\nhigh level of energy injection the system exhibits a \"mixing box\" regime which\nhas certain qualitatively universal properties regardless to the choiceof the\noperating point in the Arnold tongue. In particular, for this regime, we\nobserve a statisticsof events with high horizontal vorticity, which serve as\nkinematic indicators of mixing.\n", "  Kostant gave a model for the real geometric quantization associated to\npolarizations via the cohomology associated to the sheaf of flat sections of a\npre-quantum line bundle. This model is well-adapted for real polarizations\ngiven by integrable systems and toric manifolds. In the latter case, the\ncohomology can be computed counting integral points inside the associated\nDelzant polytope. In this article we extend Kostant's geometric quantization to\nsemitoric integrable systems and almost toric manifolds. In these cases the\ndimension of the acting torus is smaller than half of the dimension of the\nmanifold. In particular, we compute the cohomology groups associated to the\ngeometric quantization if the real polarization is the one associated to an\nintegrable system with focus-focus type singularities in dimension four. As\napplication we determine models for the geometric quantization of K3 surfaces,\na spin-spin system, the spherical pendulum, and a spin-oscillator system under\nthis scheme.\n", "  Relativistic Newtonian Dynamics (RND) was introduced in a series of recent\npapers by the author, in partial cooperation with J. M. Steiner. RND was\ncapable of describing non-classical behavior of motion under a central\nattracting force. RND incorporates the influence of potential energy on\nspacetime in Newtonian dynamics, treating gravity as a force in flat spacetime.\nIt was shown that this dynamics predicts accurately gravitational time\ndilation, the anomalous precession of Mercury and the periastron advance of any\nbinary.\n  In this paper the model is further refined and extended to describe also the\nmotion of both objects with non-zero mass and massless particles, under a\nconservative attracting force. It is shown that for any conservative force a\nproperly defined energy is conserved on the trajectories and if this force is\ncentral, the angular momentum is also preserved. An RND equation of motion is\nderived for motion under a conservative force. As an application, it is shown\nthat RND predicts accurately also the Shapiro time delay - the fourth test of\nGR.\n", "  Direct real time studies of reacting individual atoms in technologically\nimportant gold and platinum nanocatalysts in controlled reducing and oxidising\ngas environments and operating temperatures using novel environmental scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (ESTEM) with single atom sensitivity are\npresented. The direct in situ observations provide new insights into the\ndynamic behaviour of single atoms which may be important as catalytic active\nsites as well as migrating as part of deactivation mechanisms. The single atom\ndynamics reveal that the primary role of nanoparticles in the catalysts is to\nact as reservoir of ad-atoms or clusters. Possible reaction mechanisms are\ndescribed briefly\n", "  Collective behavior among coupled dynamical units can emerge in various forms\nas a result of different coupling topologies as well as different types of\ncoupling functions. Chimera states have recently received ample attention as a\nfascinating manifestation of collective behavior, in particular describing a\nsymmetry breaking spatiotemporal pattern where synchronized and desynchronized\nstates coexist in a network of coupled oscillators. In this perspective, we\nreview the emergence of different chimera states, focusing on the effects of\ndifferent coupling topologies that describe the interaction network connecting\nthe oscillators. We cover chimera states that emerge in local, nonlocal and\nglobal coupling topologies, as well as in modular, temporal and multilayer\nnetworks. We also provide an outline of challenges and directions for future\nresearch.\n", "  In a recent series of papers, the authors introduced a new Relativistic\nNewtonian Dynamics (RND) and tested its validity by the accurate prediction of\nthe gravitational time dilation, the anomalous precession of Mercury, the\nperiastron advance of any binary and the Shapiro time delay. This dynamics\nincorporates the influence of potential energy on spacetime in Newtonian\ndynamics and, unlike Einstein's General Relativity, treats gravity as a force\nwithout the need to curve spacetime. In this paper, this dynamics is applied to\nderive the gravitational deflection of both objects with non-zero mass and of\nmassless particles passing the strong gravitating field of a massive body.\nEquations for the trajectory and the resulting analytical expressions for the\ndeflection angle, in terms of the distance and velocity at the point of closest\napproach to the massive object, were derived in both cases. It is shown that\nwith a carefully defined limit, the trajectory of a massless particle is the\nlimiting case of that of an object with non-zero mass. In the \"weak\" deflection\nlimit, the derived expression for the deflection angle of a massless particle\n(photon) reproduces the experimentally tested Einstein's formula for weak\ngravitational lensing of a light ray, thereby providing another test for the\nvalidity of the RND.\n", "  We obtain the next-to-leading order correction to the spectrum of a SU(N)\nYang-Mills theory in four dimensions and we show agreement well-below 1% with\nrespect to the lattice computations for the ground state and one of the higher\nstates.\n", "  We historically trace various non-conventional explanations for the origin of\nthe cosmic microwave background and discuss their merit, while analyzing the\ndynamics of their rejection, as well as the relevant physical and\nmethodological reasons for it. It turns out that there have been many such\nunorthodox interpretations; not only those developed in the context of theories\nrejecting the relativistic (\"Big Bang\") paradigm entirely (e.g., by Alfven,\nHoyle and Narlikar) but also those coming from the camp of original thinkers\nfirmly entrenched in the relativistic milieu (e.g., by Rees, Ellis,\nRowan-Robinson, Layzer and Hively). In fact, the orthodox interpretation has\nonly incrementally won out against the alternatives over the course of the\nthree decades of its multi-stage development. While on the whole, none of the\nalternatives to the hot Big Bang scenario is persuasive today, we discuss the\nepistemic ramifications of establishing orthodoxy and eliminating alternatives\nin science, an issue recently discussed by philosophers and historians of\nscience for other areas of physics. Finally, we single out some plausible and\npossibly fruitful ideas offered by the alternatives.\n", "  In 2+1 dimensions, the evolution of flow under the influence of an external\nelectromagnetic field is simulated. The external electromagnetic field is\nexponentially decaying with time. Under the same initial conditions, flow\nevolution with and without the external electromagnetic field is compared. It\nwas found that the production of particles was enhanced when the external\nelectromagnetic field was present. As the strength of the electromagnetic field\nincreased, more particles were produced. Enhancement is greater at the high\ntransverse momentum than at the low transverse momentum. In addition, the\nelectromagnetic field also modifies the elliptic flow and the modification is\nrelated to the mass and charge of the particles.\n", "  We present a method to carry out electrical and opto-electronic measurements\non 2D materials using carbon fiber microprobes to directly make electrical\ncontacts to the 2D materials without damaging them. The working principle of\nthis microprobing method is illustrated by measuring transport in MoS2 flakes\nin vertical (transport in the out-of-plane direction) and lateral (transport\nwithin the crystal plane) configurations, finding performances comparable to\nthose reported for MoS2 devices fabricated by conventional lithographic\nprocess. We also show that this method can be used with other 2D materials.\n", "  This work proves that ranks and shares are statistically dependent on one\nanother, based on simple combinatorics. It presents a formula for rank-share\ndistribution and illustrates that Zipfs law, is descended from expected values\nof various ranks in the new distribution. All conclusions, formulas and charts\npresented here were tested against publicly available statistical data in\ndifferent areas. The correlation coefficient between the calculated values and\nstatistical numbers provided by Bureau of Labor Statistics was 0.99899.\nMonte-Carlo simulations were performed as additional evidence.\n", "  The solar Ly{\\alpha} line emission can be considered as the dominant source\nof ionization processes in the ionospheric D-region at altitudes above 70 km\nduring unperturbed conditions. However, large sudden impacts of radiation in\nsome other energy domains can also significantly influence the ionization rate\nand, in this paper, we present a study on the contribution of Ly {\\alpha}\nradiation to the ionization rate when the ionosphere is disturbed by solar\nX-flares. We give relevant analytical expressions and make calculations and\nnumerical simulations for the low ionosphere using data collected by the VLF\nreceiver located in Serbia for the VLF radio signal emitted by the DHO\ntransmitter in Germany.\n", "  To meet the 2{\\deg}C target and, in particular the 1.5{\\deg}C target defined\nin the Paris Agreement, rapid scaling-up of BECCS (Bio-Energy with Carbon\nCapture and Storage) and other negative emissions technologies (NETs) is\nessential. Recent research on BECCS has mainly focused on biophysical and\nsustainability limitations to multi-Gigatonne deployment in the latter half of\nthis century. However, this paper focuses on the critical short-term\nopportunities for immediate deployment, considering solely existing bio-energy\nfacilities in Sweden as a case study. We show that the immediate potential for\nBECCS in this country amounts to 20 Mt annually. This corresponds to 39% of\ntotal GHG emissions in 2014 in Sweden. The current costs for implementing BECCS\nat this level is compared to the present carbon taxes and other incentives. We\nshow that including BECCS in the carbon tax incentive mechanism at current\nincentive levels would yield 16.7 Mt of negative emissions annually with an\nestimated societal cost saving of more than 600 M e annually, when compared to\ncurrent incentive marginal abatement costs. We conclude that Sweden is ideally\npositioned for immediate BECCS deployment.\n", "  We calculate the scrambling rate $\\lambda_L$ and the butterfly velocity $v_B$\nassociated with the growth of quantum chaos for a solvable large-$N$\nelectron-phonon system. We study a temperature regime in which the electrical\nresistivity of this system exceeds the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit and increases\nlinearly with temperature - a sign that there are no long-lived charged\nquasiparticles - although the phonons remain well-defined quasiparticles. The\nlong-lived phonons determine $\\lambda_L$, rendering it parametrically smaller\nthan the theoretical upper-bound $\\lambda_L \\ll \\lambda_{max}=2\\pi T/\\hbar$.\nSignificantly, the chaos properties seem to be intrinsic - $\\lambda_L$ and\n$v_B$ are the same for electronic and phononic operators. We consider two\nmodels - one in which the phonons are dispersive, and one in which they are\ndispersionless. In either case, we find that $\\lambda_L$ is proportional to the\ninverse phonon lifetime, and $v_B$ is proportional to the effective phonon\nvelocity. The thermal and chaos diffusion constants, $D_E$ and $D_L\\equiv\nv_B^2/\\lambda_L$, are always comparable, $D_E \\sim D_L$. In the dispersive\nphonon case, the charge diffusion constant $D_C$ satisfies $D_L\\gg D_C$, while\nin the dispersionless case $D_L \\ll D_C$.\n", "  Though commonly used to calculate Q-factor and fractional bandwidth, the\nenergy stored by radiating systems (antennas) is a subtle and challenging\nconcept that has perplexed researchers for over half a century. Here, the\nobstacles in defining and calculating stored energy in general electromagnetic\nsystems are presented from first principles as well as using demonstrative\nexamples from electrostatics, circuits, and radiating systems. Along the way,\nthe concept of unobservable energy is introduced to formalize such challenges.\nExisting methods of defining stored energy in radiating systems are then\nreviewed in a framework based on technical commonalities rather than\nchronological order. Equivalences between some methods under common assumptions\nare highlighted, along with the strengths, weaknesses, and unique applications\nof certain techniques. Numerical examples are provided to compare the relative\nmargin between methods on several radiating structures.\n", "  In order to minimize the emittance at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring\n(CESR), we measure and correct the orbit, dispersion, and transverse coupling\nof the beam. However, this method is limited by finite measurement resolution\nof the dispersion, and so a new procedure must be used to further reduce the\nemittance due to dispersion. In order to achieve this, we use a method based\nupon the theory of sloppy models. We use a model of the accelerator to create\nthe Hessian matrix which encodes the effects of various corrector magnets on\nthe vertical emittance. A singular value decomposition of this matrix yields\nthe magnet combinations which have the greatest effect on the emittance. We can\nthen adjust these magnet \"knobs\" sequentially in order to decrease the\ndispersion and the emittance. We present here comparisons of the effectiveness\nof this procedure in both experiment and simulation using a variety of CESR\nlattices. We also discuss techniques to minimize changes to parameters we have\nalready corrected.\n", "  Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a promising two-dimensional insulator with\na large band gap and low density of charged impurities that is isostructural\nand isoelectronic with graphene. Here we report the chemical and atomic-scale\nstructure of CVD-grown wafer-scale (~25 cm2) h-BN sheets ranging in thickness\nfrom 1-20 monolayers. Atomic-scale images of h-BN on Au and graphene/Au\nsubstrates obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveal high h-BN\ncrystalline quality in monolayer samples. Further characterization of 1-20\nmonolayer samples indicates uniform thickness for wafer-scale areas; this\nthickness control is a result of precise control of the precursor flow rate,\ndeposition temperature and pressure. Raman and infrared spectroscopy indicate\nthe presence of B-N bonds and reveal a linear dependence of thickness with\ngrowth time. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows the film\nstoichiometry, and the B/N atom ratio in our films is 1 + 0.6% across the range\nof thicknesses. Electrical current transport in metal/insulator/metal\n(Au/h-BN/Au) heterostructures indicates that our CVD-grown h-BN films can act\nas excellent tunnel barriers with a high hard-breakdown field strength. Our\nresults suggest that large-area h-BN films are structurally, chemically and\nelectronically uniform over the wafer scale, opening the door to pervasive\napplication as a dielectric in layered nanoelectronic and nanophotonic\nheterostructures.\n", "  Inspired by the structural unification of unitary groups (quantum field\ntheory) with orthogonal groups (relativity) proposed recently through a\nnon-division algebra, we construct a hypercomplex field theory with an internal\nsymmetry that unifies the U(1) compact gauge group with the SO(1,1) noncompact\ngauge group, using the commutative ring of hypercomplex numbers. From the\nquantum field theory point of view, the hypercomplex field encodes two charged\nbosons with opposite charge, and corresponds thus to a neutral compound boson.\nFurthermore, normal or- dering of operators is not required for controling the\nvacuum divergences; in an analogy with SUSY, the theory under study contains\nU(1) boson particles and their hyperbolic SO(1,1) boson partners, whose\ncontributions to the vacuum energy cancel out exactly to a zero value. In fact\nthe present scheme allows us to compare finite measuments of squeezed\nboson-number statistics obtained with and without normal ordering. Additionally\nwe discuss on the potential applications of the squeezed boson states\nconstructed on the commutative ring, in quantum teleportation and in related\nareas.\n", "  Aqua MODIS Moon images obtained with bands 20 to 26 (3.66 - 4.55 and 1.36 -\n1.39 $\\mu$m) during scheduled lunar events show evidence of electronic\ncrosstalk contamination of the response of detector 1. In this work, we\ndetermined the sending bands for each receiving band. We found that the\ncontaminating signal originates, in all cases, from the detector 10 of the\ncorresponding sending band and that the signals registered by the receiving and\nsending detectors are always read out in immediate sequence. We used the lunar\nimages to derive the crosstalk coefficients, which were then applied in the\ncorrection of electronic crosstalk striping artifacts present in L1B images,\nsuccessfully restoring product quality.\n", "  The main objective of this article is to derive a mathematical theory\nassociated with the nonlinear stability and dynamic transitions of the basic\nshear flows associated with baroclinic instability, which plays a fundamental\nrole in the dominant mechanism shaping the cyclones and anticyclones that\ndominate weather in mid-latitudes, as well as the mesoscale eddies that play\nvarious roles in oceanic dynamics and the transport of tracers. This article\nprovides a general transition and stability theory for the two-layer\nquasi-geostrophic model originally derived by Pedlosky \\cite{ped1970}. We show\nthat the instability and dynamic transition of the basic shear flow occur only\nwhen the Froude number $F>(\\gamma^2+1)/2$, where $\\gamma$ is the weave number\nof lowest zonal harmonic. In this case, we derive a precise critical shear\nvelocity $U_c$ and a dynamic transition number $b$, and we show that the\ndynamic transition and associated flo0w patterns are dictated by the sign of\nthis transition number. In particular, we show that for $b>0$, the system\nundergoes a continuous transition, leading to spatiotemporal flow oscillatory\npatterns as the shear velocity $U$ crosses $U_c$; for $b<0$, the system\nundergoes a jump transition, leading to drastic change and more complex\ntransition patterns in the far field, and to unstable period solutions for\n$U<U_c$. Furthermore, we show that when the wavenumber of the zonal harmonic\n$\\gamma=1$, the transition number $b$ is always positive and the system always\nundergoes a continuous dynamic transition leading spatiotemporal oscillations.\nThis suggests that a continuous transition to spatiotemporal patterns is\npreferable for the shear flow associated with baroclinic instability.\n", "  The ratio of directional strength-to-stiffness is important in governing the\nrelative order in which individual crystals within a polycrystalline aggregate\nwill yield as the aggregate is loaded. In this paper, a strength-to-stiffness\nparameter is formulated for multiaxial loading that extends the development of\nWong and Dawson for uniaxial loading. Building on the principle of\nstrength-to-stiffness, a methodology for predicting the macroscopic stresses at\nwhich elements in a finite element mesh yield is developed. This analysis uses\nelastic strain data from one increment of a purely elastic finite element\nsimulation to make the prediction, given knowledge of the single-crystal yield\nsurface. Simulations of austenitic strainless steel AL6XN are used to\ndemonstrated the effectivness of the strength-to-stiffness parameter and yield\nprediction methodology.\n", "  The specific heat of two polymorphs of BaPd2As2 was measured. The\nThCr2Si2-type polymorph (space group I4/mmm, $D_{4h}^{17}$, No. 139) is a\npreviously reported superconductor with a transition temperature Tc $\\simeq$\n3.5 K, while the CeMg2Si2-type polymorph (P4/mmm, $D_{4h}^{1}$, No. 123) is a\nnormal metal and does not exhibit superconductivity down to 1.8 K. Our results\nrevealed that the ThCr2Si2-type has an anomalously low Debye temperature,\nindicative of soft phonons, compared to the CeMg2Si2-type. Moreover, a large\nspecific-heat jump at Tc indicated that the superconductivity of ThCr2Si2-type\nis a strong-coupling type, which is likely derived from soft phonons.\n", "  We examine discrete vortex dynamics in two-dimensional flow through a\nnetwork-theoretic approach. The interaction of the vortices is represented with\na graph, which allows the use of network-theoretic approaches to identify key\nvortex-to-vortex interactions. We employ sparsification techniques on these\ngraph representations based on spectral theory for constructing sparsified\nmodels and evaluating the dynamics of vortices in the sparsified setup.\nIdentification of vortex structures based on graph sparsification and sparse\nvortex dynamics are illustrated through an example of point-vortex clusters\ninteracting amongst themselves. We also evaluate the performance of\nsparsification with increasing number of point vortices. The\nsparsified-dynamics model developed with spectral graph theory requires reduced\nnumber of vortex-to-vortex interactions but agrees well with the full nonlinear\ndynamics. Furthermore, the sparsified model derived from the sparse graphs\nconserves the invariants of discrete vortex dynamics. We highlight the\nsimilarities and differences between the present sparsified-dynamics model and\nthe reduced-order models.\n", "  To sum up, we show in the present paper that magnetic response in\nNb$_2$O$_2$F$_3$ at the high-temperatures ($T>$90 K) is related to the orbital\nselective regime, when part of the electrons form molecular orbitals while\nother electrons have local magnetic moments. The charge disproportionation,\nwhich occurs at $T\\sim$90 K is seen in the GGA calculations, but its degree\n($\\delta n \\sim 0.1$ electron) is far from what one would expect from naive\nexpectations based on the formal ionic valences. The mechanism of the charge\nordering is argued to be related with a sizable kinetic energy gain due to\nformation of two molecular orbitals in short Nb$^{3+}$-Nb$^{3+}$ dimers caused\nby a strong nonlinearity of the distance dependence on electron hopping. We\nthink that this mechanism of charge ordering, stabilized not by decrease of\ninteraction energy, but rather by the gain in kinetic energy, may be operative\nin many other systems, especially consisting of structural dimers.\n", "  We examine the effects of a global magnetic field and outflow on radiatively\ninefficient accretion flow (RIAF) in the presence of magnetic resistivity. We\nfind a self-similar solutions for the height integrated equations that govern\nthe behavior of the flow. We use the mixing length mechanism for studying the\nconvection parameter. We adopt a radius dependent mass accretion rate as\n$\\dot{M}=\\dot{M}_{out}{(\\frac{r}{r_{out}})^{s}}$ with $s> 0$ to investigate the\ninfluence of outflow on the structure of inflow where $s$ is a constant and\nindication the effect of wind. Also, we have studied the radiation spectrum and\ntemperature of CDAFs. The thermal bermsstrahlung emission as a radiation\nmechanism is taken into account for calculating the spectra emitted by the\nCDAFs. The energy that powers bremsstrahlung emission at large radii is\nprovided by convective transport from small radii and viscous and resistivity\ndissipation. Our results indicate that the disc rotates slower and accretes\nfaster, it becomes hotter and thicker for stronger wind. By increasing all\ncomponent of magnetic field, the disc rotates faster and accretes slower while\nit becomes hotter and thicker. We show that the outflow parameter and all\ncomponent of magnetic field have the same effects on the luminosity of the\ndisc. We compare the dynamical structure of the disc in two different solutions\n(with and without resistivity parameter). We show that only the radial infall\nvelocity and the surface density could changed by resistivity parameter\nobviously. Increasing the effect of wind increases the disc's temperature and\nluminosity of the disc. The effect of magnetic field is similar to the effect\nof wind in the disc's temperature and luminosity of the disc, but the influence\nof resistivity on the observational properties is not evident.\n", "  Cells rely on focal adhesions (FAs) to carry out a variety of important\ntasks, including motion, environmental sensing, and adhesion to the\nextracellular matrix. Although attaining a fundamental characterization of FAs\nis a compelling goal, their extensive complexity and small size, which can be\nbelow the diffraction limit, have hindered a full understanding. In this study\nwe have used single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to investigate\nintegrin $\\beta$3 and paxillin in rat embryonic fibroblasts growing on two\ndifferent extracellular matrix-representing substrates (i.e. fibronectin-coated\nsubstrates and specifically bio-functionalized nano-patterned substrates). To\nquantify the substructure of FAs, we developed a method based on expectation\nmaximization of a Gaussian mixture that accounts for localization uncertainty\nand background. Analysis of our SMLM data indicates that the structures within\nFAs, characterized as a Gaussian mixture, typically have areas between 0.01 and\n1 $\\mu$m$^2$, contain 10 to 100 localizations, and can exhibit substantial\neccentricity. Our approach based on SMLM opens new avenues for studying\nstructural and functional biology of molecular assemblies that display\nsubstantial varieties in size, shape, and density.\n", "  A compact bilateral single conductor surface wave transmission line (TL) is\nproposed, converting the quasi-transverse electromagnetic (QTEM) mode of low\ncharacteristic impedance slotline into the transverse magnetic (TM) mode of\nsingle-conductor TL. The propagation constant of the proposed TL is decided by\ngeometric parameters of the periodic corrugated structure. Compared to\nconventional transitions between coplanar waveguide (CPW) and single-conductor\nTLs, such as Goubau line (G-Line) and surface plasmons TL, the proposed\nstructure halves the size and this feature gives important potentials to\ndevelop integrated surface wave devices and circuits. The designed structure,\nsample fabrication and experimental verification are discussed.\n", "  Skyrmions are localized, topologically non-trivial spin structures which have\nraised high hopes for future spintronic applications. A key issue is skyrmion\nstability with respect to annihilation into the ferromagnetic state. Energy\nbarriers for this collapse have been calculated taking only nearest neighbor\nexchange interactions into account. Here, we demonstrate that exchange\ninteractions beyond nearest neighbors can be essential to describe stability of\nskyrmionic spin structures. We focus on the prototypical film system\nPd/Fe/Ir(111) and demonstrate that an effective nearest-neighbor exchange or\nmicromagnetic model can only account for equilibrium properties such as the\nskyrmion profile or the zero temperature phase diagram. However, energy\nbarriers and critical fields of skyrmion collapse as well as skyrmion lifetimes\nare drastically underestimated since the energy of the transition state cannot\nbe accurately described. Antiskyrmions are not even metastable. Our work shows\nthat frustration of exchange interactions is a route towards enhanced skyrmion\nstability even in systems with a ferromagnetic ground state.\n", "  The complex phase present in CP-violating systems such as neutral kaons is\nshown to be of geometrical origin. It is also concluded that the complex phase\nof the Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Maskawa (CKM) matrix is a Berry-like phase.\n", "  The emergence of oscillations in models of the El-Ni\\~no effect is of utmost\nrelevance. Here we investigate a coupled nonlinear delay differential system\nmodeling theEl-Ni\\~no/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which arises\nthrough the strong coupling of the ocean-atmosphere system. In particular, we\nstudy the temporal patterns of the sea surface temperature anomaly of the two\nsub-regions. For identical sub-regions we typically observe a co-existence of\namplitude and oscillator death behavior for low delays, and heterogeneous\noscillations for high delays, when inter-region coupling is weak. For moderate\ninter-region coupling strengths one obtains homogeneous oscillations for\nsufficiently large delays and amplitude death for small delays. When the\ninter-region coupling strength is large, oscillations are suppressed\naltogether, implying that strongly coupled sub-regions do not exhibit ENSO-like\noscillations. Further we observe that larger strengths of self-delay coupling\nfavours oscillations, while oscillations die out when the delayed coupling is\nweak. This indicates again that delayed feedback, incorporating oceanic wave\ntransit effects, is the principal cause of oscillatory behaviour. So the effect\nof trapped ocean waves propagating in a basin with closed boundaries is crucial\nfor the emergence of ENSO. Further, we show how non-uniformity in delays, and\ndifference in the strengths of the self-delay coupling of the sub-regions,\naffect the rise of oscillations. Interestingly we find that larger delays and\nself-delay coupling strengths lead to oscillations, while strong inter-region\ncoupling kills oscillatory behaviour. Thus, we find that coupling sub-regions\nhas a very significant effect on the emergence of oscillations, and strong\ncoupling typically suppresses oscillations, while weak coupling of\nnon-identical sub-regions can induce oscillations, thereby favouring ENSO.\n", "  The quantum description of an atom with a magnetic quadrupole moment in the\npresence of a time-dependent magnetic field is analysed. It is shown that the\ntime-dependent magnetic field induces an electric field that interacts with the\nmagnetic quadrupole moment of the atom and gives rise to a Landau-type\nquantization. It is also shown that a time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation\ncan be obtained, i.e., without existing the interaction between the magnetic\nquadrupole moment of the atom and the time-dependent magnetic field, therefore,\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation can be solved exactly. It is also analysed this\nsystem subject to scalar potentials.\n", "  In this talk we present the recent calculation in all partonic channels of\nthe fully differential single jet inclusive cross section at\nNext-to-Next-to-Leading Order in QCD. We discuss the size and shape of the\nperturbative corrections as a function of the functional form of the\nrenormalisation and factorisation scales and compare the predictions at NLO and\nNNLO to the available ATLAS 7 TeV data. We find significant effects at\nlow-$p_T$ due to changes in the functional form of the scale choice whereas at\nhigh-$p_T$ the two most common scale choices in the literature give identical\nresults and the perturbative corrections lead to a substantial reduction in the\nscale dependence of the theoretical prediction at NNLO.\n", "  Magnetic and chiral bands have been a hot subject for more than twenty years.\nTherefore, quite large volumes of experimental data as well as theoretical\ndescriptions have been accumulated. Although some of the formalisms are not so\neasy to handle, the results agree impressively well with the data. The\nobjective of this paper is to review the actual status of both experimental and\ntheoretical investigations. Aiming at making this material accessible to a\nlarge variety of readers, including young students and researchers, I gave some\ndetails on the schematic models which are able to unveil the main features of\nchirality in nuclei. Also, since most formalisms use a rigid triaxial rotor for\nthe nuclear system's core, I devoted some space to the semi-classical\ndescription of the rigid triaxial as well as of the tilted triaxial rotor. In\norder to answer the question whether the chiral phenomenon is spread over the\nwhole nuclear chart and whether it is specific only to a certain type of\nnuclei, odd-odd, odd-even or even-even, the current results in the mass regions\nof $A\\sim 60,80,100,130,180,200$ are briefly described for all kinds of\nodd/even-odd/even systems. The chiral geometry is a sufficient condition for a\nsystem of proton-particle, neutron-hole and a triaxial rotor to have the\nelectromagnetic properties of chiral bands. In order to prove that such\ngeometry is not unique for generating magnetic bands with chiral features, I\npresented a mechanism for a new type of chiral bands. One tries to underline\nthe fact that this rapidly developing field is very successful in pushing\nforward nuclear structure studies.\n", "  This work presents the optical reconstruction of computer-generated holograms\n(CGHs) 3D scenes via spatial light modulators (SLMs). Holography is an optical\ntechnique that allows the recording and reconstruction of images of 3D objects,\nas a hologram carries the intensity and phase information about the object.\nWith the evolution of data storage and processing in computers, the viability\nof generating holograms by computers has increased. Currently the experimental\nimplementation of CGHs (Computer-Generated Holograms) is done through new\noptoelectronic devices such as SLMs (Spatial Light Modulators) and\nhigh-resolution CCDs cameras, in addition to new photosensitive materials,\nallowing the optical recording and reconstruction of 3D images and special\noptical beams. Therefore, presented here with good results are CGHs numerical\nconstruction (recording) of images both static and dynamic, 2D and 3D, and its\nreconstruction (reproduction) using optical SLMs devices to obtain 3D images\nand static and dynamic scenes.\n", "  In this paper, the looping kinetics of a long polymer chain in solution has\nbeen investigated by using two state model, where one state represents open\nchain polymer molecule and the other represents closed chain polymer molecule.\nThe dynamics of end-to end distance of both open chain and closed chain polymer\nis represented by a Smoluchowski-like equation for a single particle under two\ndifferent harmonic potentials. The coupling between these two potentials are\nassumed to be a Dirac Delta function in our model. We evaluate two rate\nconstants, the long term and the average rate constant. We have also\nincorporated the effect of all other chemical reactions involving at least one\nend of the open chain polymer molecule - on rate of end-to-end loop formation.\nThe closed chain polymer molecule can be converted to a open chain molecule by\nbreaking of any bond - the effect of this reaction on the rate of end-to-end\nloop formation is also considered in our model.\n", "  Carrier recombination and transport processes play key roles in determining\nthe optoelectronic performances such as the efficiency droop and forward\nvoltage in InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\nIn this work, we investigate the dominant carrier transport and recombination\nprocesses inside and outside the MQW region as a function of injection current\nfrom a new point of view by separately examining the carrier energy loss.\nAnalysis of the measurement results reveals that the carrier accumulation and\nsubsequent spill-over from the MQW active region to the clad is the most\nprobable mechanism of explaining the efficiency and forward voltage variation\nwith the injection current.\n", "  As an attempt to further elucidate the operating voltage increase in\nInGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the radiative and nonradiative\ncurrent components are separately analyzed in combination with the Shockley\ndiode equation. Through the analyses, we have shown that the increase in\noperating voltage is caused by phase space filling effect in high injection. We\nhave also shown that the classical Shockley diode equation is insufficient to\ncomprehensively explain the I-V curve of the LED devices since the transport\nand recombination characteristics of respective current components are\nbasically different. Hence, we have proposed a modified Shockley equation\nsuitable for modern LED devices. Our analysis gives a new insight on the cause\nof the wall-plug-efficiency drop influenced by such factors as the efficiency\ndroop and the high operating voltage in InGaN LEDs.\n", "  Choosing the Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) ternary alloy for thin films\nsolar cells might yield high benefits concerning efficiency and reliability,\nbecause its bandgap can be tuned through the Indium composition and radiations\nhave little destructive effect on it. It may also reveal challenges because\ngood quality p-doped InGaN layers are difficult to elaborate. In this letter, a\nnew design for an InGaN thin film solar cell is optimized, where the player of\na PIN structure is replaced by a Schottky contact, leading to a Metal-IN (MIN)\nstructure. With a simulated efficiency of 19.8%, the MIN structure performs\nbetter than the previously studied Schottky structure, while increasing its\nfabrication tolerance and thus functional reliability a. Owing to its good\ntolerance to radiations [1], its high light absorption [2, 3] and its\nIndium-composition-tuned bandgap [4, 5], the Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN)\nternary alloy is a good candidate for high-efficiency-high-reliability solar\ncells able to operate in harsh environments. Unfortunately, InGaN p-doping is\nstill a challenge, owing to InGaN residual n-doping [6], the lack of dedicated\nac-ceptors [7] and the complex fabrication process itself [8, 9]. To these\ndrawbacks can be added the uneasy fabrication of ohmic contacts [4] and the\ndifficulty to grow the high-quality-high-Indium-content thin films [10] which\nwould be needed to cover the whole solar spectrum. These drawbacks still\nprevent InGaN solar cells to be competitive with other well established III-V\nand silicon technologies [11]. In this letter, is proposed a new Metal-IN (MIN)\nInGaN solar cell structure where the InGaN p-doped layer is removed and\nreplaced by a Schottky contact, lifting one of the above mentioned drawbacks. A\nset of realistic physical models based on actual measurements is used to\nsimulate and optimize its behavior and performance using mathematically\nrigorous multi-criteria optimization methods, aiming to show that both\nefficiency and fabrication tolerances are better than the previously described\nsimple InGaN Schottky solar cell [12].\n", "  Nonlinear dynamics of a two-side electro-statically actuated capacitive\nmicro-beam is studied. The piezoelectric actuation leads to the generation of\nan axial force along the length of the micro-beam and this is used as a tuning\ntool to shift the primary resonance of the micro-resonator. The governing\nequation of motion is derived by minimization of the Hamiltonian and\ngeneralized to the viscously damped systems. The periodic solutions in the\nvicinity of the primary resonance are detected and their stability is\ninvestigated. The basins of attraction conforming to three individual periodic\norbits are determined. The outcomes show that the higher the amplitude of the\nperiodic orbit, the smaller is the area of the attractor.\n", "  Since the first reported traffic jam about a century ago, traffic congestion\nhas been intensively studied with various methods ranging from macroscopic to\nmicroscopic viewpoint. However, due to the population growth and fast\ncivilization, traffic congestion has become significantly worse not only\nleading to economic losses, but also causes environment damages. Without\nunderstanding of jams spatio-temporal propagation behavior in a city, it is\nimpossible to develop efficient mitigation strategies to control and improve\ncity traffic. Although some progress has been made in recent studies based on\navailable traffic data regarding general features of traffic, the understanding\nof the spatio-temporal propagation of traffic jams in urban traffic is still\nunclear. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation behavior of traffic jams\nbased on collected empirical traffic data in big cities. We developed a method\nto identify influential jam centers and find that jams spread radially from\nmultiple jam centers with a range of velocities. Our findings may help to\npredict and even control the traffic jam propagation, which could be helpful\nfor the development of future autonomous driving technology and intelligent\ntransportation system.\n", "  I purport to show why old and new claims on the role of counterfactual\nreasoning for the EPR argument and the Bell theorem are unjustified: once the\nlogical relation between locality and counterfactual reasoning is clarified,\nthe use of the latter does no harm and the nonlocality result can well follow\nfrom the EPR premises. To show why, I critically review (i) incompleteness\narguments that Einstein developed before the EPR paper, and (ii) more recent\nclaims that equate the use of counterfactual reasoning with the assumption of a\nstrong form of realism.\n", "  Flash memory technology is widely common in modern microelectronics, and is\nessentially affecting our daily life. Considering the recent progress in\nphotonic circuitry, and in particular silicon photonics circuitry, there is now\nan opportunity to embed the flash memory technology in photonic applications. A\nparticularly promising candidate that can benefit from such integration is the\nphotonic resonator. As of today, chip scale resonators are essential building\nblocks in modern silicon photonic platform. However, their properties, and in\nparticular their resonance frequencies deviate from their designed values due\nto unavoidable fabrication imperfections, imposing a stringent limitation on\nthe applicability of such devices. Here we present a solution for this major\nobstacle and demonstrate electrical approach for post trimming of such\nresonators. This is achieved by integrating the well-established flash memory\ntechnology into the photonic circuitry. More specifically, we use the nanoscale\nSilicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (SONOS) structure in order to trap charges\nin the thin silicon nitride layer, which is located in close proximity to the\nsilicon device layer. This enables the accumulation of charges in the silicon,\nmodifying the effective index of the optical mode and consequently the\nresonance frequency. By doing so, we provide a robust and elegant CMOS\ncompatible memory solution, which can be easily manufactured and\ncommercialized. We expect such an approach to pave the way for even more\nefficient utilization of resonators and interferometers in chip scale photonic\nand electro optic systems, with wide range of applications such as filters,\nmodulators, sensors, and lasers, to name a few.\n", "  In an emulsion system, emulsifier is one of the most important substances as\nit determines the formation, stability and physicochemical properties of\nemulsions. In this study, the effects of emulsifier concentration, type of\nhydrophilic emulsifier, as well as portions of primary emulsion (weight) on the\nstability of W/O/W emulsions were investigated. Microscopy images of W/O/W\nemulsions indicated that the emulsions prepared with 0.5 gram of sodium\ncaseinate have superior stability over other synthesis conditions. Finally,\nemulsions were prepared using different types of emulsifier (NaCN, Cremophor,\nTween 60). Our results showed that emulsions made form Cremophor and Tween 60\nin comparison with sodium caseinate possess smaller droplets size with enhanced\nstability.\n", "  We study the time evolution of quantum systems with a time-dependent\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian given by a linear combination of SU(1,1) and SU(2)\ngenerators.With a time-dependent metric, the pseudo-Hermitian invariant\noperator is constructed in the same manner as for both the SU(1,1) and SU(2)\nsystems. The exact common solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equations for both the\nSU(1,1) and SU(2) systems are obtained in terms of eigenstates of the\npseudo-Hermitian invariant operator.\n", "  Glass corrosion is a crucial problem in keeping and conservation of beadworks\nin museums. All kinds of glass beads undergo deterioration but blue-green\nlead-potassium glass beads of the 19th century are subjected to the destruction\nto the greatest extent. Blue-green lead-potassium glass beads of the 19th\ncentury obtained from exhibits kept in Russian museums were studied with the\npurpose to determine the causes of the observed phenomenon. For the comparison,\nyellow lead beads of the 19th century were also explored. Both kinds of beads\ncontain Sb but yellow ones are stable. Using scanning electron microscopy,\nenergy dispersive X-ray microspectrometry, electron backscatter diffraction,\ntransmission electron microscopy and X-ray powder analysis, we have registered\nthe presence of crystallites of orthorhombic KSbOSiO$_4$ and cubic\nPb$_2$Sb$_{1.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$O$_{6.5}$ in glass matrix of blue-green and yellow\nbeads, respectively. Both compounds form at rather high temperatures obviously\nduring glass melting and/or melt cooling. We suppose that the crystallites\ngenerate internal tensile strain in glass during its cooling which causes\nformation of multiple microcracks in inner domains of blue-green beads. We\nsuggest that the deterioration degree depends on quantity of the precipitates,\ntheir sizes and their temperature coefficients of linear expansion. In\nblue-green beads, the crystallites are distributed in their sizes from\n$\\sim\\,$200 nm to several tens of $\\mu$m and tend to gather in large colonies.\nThe sizes of crystallites in yellow beads are several hundreds of nm and their\nclusters contain few crystallites. This explains the difference in corrosion of\nthese kinds of beads containing crystals of Sb compounds.\n", "  We report development and application of a fluid-structure interaction (FSI)\nsolver for compressible flows with large-scale flow-induced deformation of the\nstructure. The FSI solver utilizes partitioned approach to strongly couple a\nsharp-interface immersed boundary method based flow solver with an open-source\nfinite-element structure dynamics solver. The flow solver is based on a\nhigher-order finite-difference method on Cartesian grid and employs ghost-cell\nmethodology to impose boundary conditions on the immersed boundary. A\nhigher-order accuracy near the immersed boundary is achieved by combining the\nghost-cell approach with a weighted least-square error method based on a\nhigher-order approximate polynomial. The second order spatial accuracy of the\nflow solver is established by performing a grid refinement study. The structure\nsolver is validated with a canonical elastostatics problem. The FSI solver is\nvalidated with published measurements and simulations for the large-scale\ndeformation of a thin elastic steel panel subjected to blast loading in a shock\ntube. The solver correctly predicts oscillating behavior of the tip of the\npanel with reasonable fidelity and computed shock wave propagation is\nqualitatively consistent with the published results. In order to demonstrate\nthe fidelity of the solver and to investigate coupled physics of the\nshock-structure interaction for a thin elastic plate, we employ the solver for\nsimulating 6.4 kg TNT blast loading on the thin elastic plate. The initial\nconditions of the blast are taken from field tests reported in the literature.\nUsing numerical schlieren, the shock front propagation, Mach reflection and\nvortex shedding at the tip of the plate are visualized during the shock wave\nimpact on the plate. We discuss coupling between the non-linear dynamics of the\nplate and blast loading.\n", "  The abundance of accelerators and the ambient conditions make Cygnus X a\nnatural laboratory for studying the life cycle of cosmic-rays (CRs). This\nnaturally makes the Cygnus X complex a highly interesting source in neutrino\nastronomy, in particular concerning a possible detection with the IceCube\nNeutrino Observatory, which has a good view of the northern hemisphere. In this\npaper, we model the multiwavelength spectrum of the Cygnus, for the first time\nusing a broad data set from radio, MeV (COMPTEL), GeV (Fermi), TeV (Argo) and\n10s of TeV (Milagro) energies. The modeling is performed assuming a\nleptohadronic model. We solve the steady-state transport equation for leptons\nand hadrons injected homogeneously in the region and test the role of diffusive\ntransport and energy loss by radiation and interaction. The result shows that\ndiffusion loss plays a significant role in Cygnus X and always exceeds the\nadvection loss as well as almost all other loss processes. The best-fit\nparameters we find are a magnetic field of $B=8.9\\times10^{-6}$ G, a target\ndensity of $N_t=19.4$ cm$^{-3}$, a cosmic ray spectral index of $\\alpha=2.37$\nand neutral gas distribution over a depth of 116 pc. We find that the fit\ndescribes the data up to TeV energies well, while the Milagro data are\nunderestimated. This transport model with a broad multiwavelength fit provides\na neutrino flux which approaches the sensitivity of IceCube at very high\nenergies ($>$ 50 TeV). In the future, the flux sensitivity of IceCube will be\nimproved. With this rather pessimistic model, leaving out the influence of\npossible strong, high-energy point sources, we already expect the flux in the\nCygnus X region to suffice for IceCube to measure a significant neutrino flux\nin the next decade.\n", "  Recently, Roger Colbeck and Renato Renner (C&R) have claimed that '[n]o\nextension of quantum theory can have improved predictive power'. If correct,\nthis is a spectacular impossibility theorem for hidden variable theories, which\nis more general than the theorems of Bell and Leggett. C&R's claim essentially\nmeans that in any hidden variable theory that is compatible with\nquantum-mechanical predictions, probabilities of measurement outcomes are\nindependent of these hidden variables. On closer inspection, however, the\ngenerality and validity of the claim can be contested. First, it is based on an\nassumption called 'Freedom of Choice'. As the name suggests, this assumption\ninvolves the independence of an experimenter's choice of measurement settings.\nBut in the way C&R define this assumption, a no-signalling condition is\nsurreptitiously presupposed, making the assumption less innocent than it\nsounds. When using this definition, any hidden variable theory violating\nParameter Independence, such as Bohmian Mechanics, is immediately shown to be\nincompatible with quantum-mechanical predictions. Also, the argument of C&R is\nhard to follow and their mathematical derivation contains several gaps, some of\nwhich cannot be closed in the way they suggest. We shall show that these gaps\ncan be filled. The issue with the 'Freedom of Choice' assumption can be\ncircumvented by explicitly assuming Parameter Independence. This makes the\nresult less general, but better founded. We then obtain an impossibility\ntheorem for hidden variable theories satisfying Parameter Independence only.\nSo, while quantum mechanics itself satisfies Parameter Independence, if a\nvariable is added that changes the outcome probabilities, however slightly,\nParameter Independence must be violated.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce the generalized phase space $\\left(\n\\vec{r},\\vec{v},\\dot{\\vec{v}},\\ddot{\\vec{v}},... \\right)$, which expands the\nknown phase space $\\left( \\vec{r},\\vec{v} \\right)$. The fact is that the\nintroduced space is the infinity dimensional phase space. The paper shows that\ndissipative systems in generalized phase space may be considered as\nconservative systems. It is shown that, in infinity dimensional phase space,\nthe entropy is a constant value. It is shown that the transition to finite\ndimensional phase space leads to dissipations and change of the entropy. The\npaper contains the rigorous mathematical result.\n", "  The yardstick of new first-principles approaches to key points on reaction\npaths at metal surfaces is chemical accuracy compared to reliable experiment.\nBy this we mean that such values as the activation barrier are required to\nwithin 1 kcal/mol. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a promising (albeit lengthy)\nfirst-principles method for this and we are now beyond the dawn of QMC\nbenchmarks for these systems, since hydrogen dissociation on Cu(111) has been\nstudied with quite adequate accuracy in two improving QMC studies Hoggan ArXiv\n2015, K. Doblhoff-Deir et al JCTC (2017).\n  Pt and Cu require the use of pseudo-potentials in these calculations and we\nshow that those of Pt are less problematic than those for Cu, particularly for\nQMC work.\n  In this letter, we determine the activation barrier to hydrogen dissociation\non Pt(111) using the bridging geometry. This is found to agree to better than\nchemical accuracy with recent Specific Reaction Parameter (SRP-DFT) work, which\nis itself within chemical accuracy of measurement (Kroes et al Cplett 2017).\n  The results suggest the dissociation barrier for hydrogen on Pt(111) is close\nto 5.4 (QMC) and 6.2 (SRP-DFT) kcal/mol with a QMC standard error of 1.08\nkcal/mol.\n  This is encouraging for establishing less well-known benchmark values of\nindustrial reaction barriers on Pt(111).\n", "  The Rafita asteroid family is an S-type group located in the middle main\nbelt, on the right side of the 3J:-1A mean-motion resonance. The proximity of\nthis resonance to the family left side in semi-major axis caused many former\nfamily members to be lost. As a consequence, the family shape in the $(a,1/D)$\ndomain is quite asymmetrical, with a preponderance of objects on the right side\nof the distribution. The Rafita family is also characterized by a leptokurtic\ndistribution in inclination, which allows the use of methods of family age\nestimation recently introduced for other leptokurtic families such as Astrid,\nHansa, Gallia, and Barcelona. In this work we propose a new method based on the\nbehavior of an asymmetry coefficient function of the distribution in the\n$(a,1/D)$ plane to date incomplete asteroid families such as Rafita. By\nmonitoring the time behavior of this coefficient for asteroids simulating the\ninitial conditions at the time of the family formation, we were able to\nestimate that the Rafita family should have an age of $490\\pm200$ Myr, in good\nagreement with results from independent methods such as Monte Carlo simulations\nof Yarkovsky and Yorp dynamical induced evolution and the time behaviour of the\nkurtosis of the $\\sin{(i)}$ distribution. Asteroids from the Rafita family can\nreach orbits similar to 8\\% of the currently known near Earth objects.\n$\\simeq$1\\% of the simulated objects are present in NEO-space during the final\n10 Myr of the simulation, and thus would be comparable to objects in the\npresent-day NEO population.\n", "  Based on the third allotropic form of carbon (Fullerenes) through theoretical\nstudy have been predicted structures described as non-classical fullerenes. We\nhave studied novel allotropic carbon structures with a closed cage\nconfiguration that have been predicted for the first time, by using DFT at the\nB3LYP level. Such carbon Cn-q structures (where, n=20, 42, 48 and 60), combine\nstates of hybridization sp1 and sp2, for the formation of bonds. A comparative\nanalysis of quasi-fullerenes with respect to their isomers of greater stability\nwas also performed. Chemical stability was evaluated with the criteria of\naromaticity through the different rings that build the systems. The results\nshow new isomerism of carbon nanostructures with interesting chemical\nproperties such as hardness, chemical potential and HOMO-LUMO gaps. We also\nstudied thermal stability with Lagrangian molecular dynamics method using Atom-\nCenter Density propagation (ADMP) method.\n", "  Granular materials are an important physical realization of active matter. In\nvibration-fluidized granular matter, both diffusion and self-propulsion derive\nfrom the same collisional forcing, unlike many other active systems where there\nis a clean separation between the origin of single-particle mobility and the\ncoupling to noise. Here we present experimental studies of single-particle\nmotion in a vibrated granular monolayer, along with theoretical analysis that\ncompares grain motion at short and long time scales to the assumptions and\npredictions, respectively, of the active Brownian particle (ABP) model. The\nresults demonstrate that despite the unique relation between noise and\npropulsion, granular media do show the generic features predicted by the ABP\nmodel and indicate that this is a valid framework to predict collective\nphenomena. Additionally, our scheme of analysis for validating the inputs and\noutputs of the model can be applied to other granular and non-granular systems.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the band structure of two- and\nthree-dimensional hexagonal layered materials using Landau Level optical Hall\neffect spectroscopy investigations, employing graphene and graphite as model\nsystems. We study inter-Landau-level transitions in highly oriented pyrolytic\ngraphite and a stack of multilayer graphene on C-face 6\\textit{H}-SiC, using\ndata from reflection-type optical Hall effect measurements in the mid-infrared\nspectral range at sample temperatures of $T=1.5$~K and magnetic fields up to\n$B=8$~T. We describe a comprehensive dielectric polarizability model for\ninter-Landau-level transitions, which permits analysis of the optical Hall\neffect data. From their magnetic field dependence we identify sets of H- and\nK-point inter-Landau-level transitions in graphite and sets of\ninter-Landau-level transition from decoupled graphene single, and coupled\ngraphene bi-, tri-, and quad-layer for the multilayer graphene stack. For\ninter-Landau-level transitions in decoupled graphene single-layers and H-point\ntransitions in graphite we observe polarization mode preserving behavior,\nrequiring symmetric magneto-optical contributions to the corresponding\ndielectric tensors. Inter-Landau-level transitions in coupled graphene layers\nas well as K-point transitions in graphite exhibit polarization mode mixing\nbehavior, requiring antisymmetric magneto-optical contributions to the\ncorresponding dielectric tensors. From the circular-polarization-averaged\ninter-Landau-level transition energies and the energy splitting between right-\nand left-handed circular polarized inter-Landau-level transitions we determine\nthe model parameters in the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure band structure\napproximation for two- and three-dimensional hexagonal layered materials, with\ngraphene and graphite as examples.\n", "  This article briefly reviews the significance nano-lubricants and assesses\ntheir effectiveness to provide the most promising approaches to reduce the\nfriction and anti-wear/scuffing over the boundary regime. The main purpose of\nthis review is to summarize the present knowledge about major advantages of the\nnanomaterials as nanolubricant additives in boundary lubrication. It is very\ncomplex regime involving surface topography, metallurgy, physical adsorption\nand chemical reactions. There is no intent to present an exhaustive survey of\nthe literature, but it presents the main reasons for decreasing the friction\nand wear based on lubricated by nanolubricants during heavy load and low-speed\nconditions.\n", "  The use of Standard Reference Materials (SRM) from the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) for quantitative analysis of chemical\ncomposition using Synchrotron based X-Ray Florescence (SR-XRF) and Scanning\nTransmission X-Ray Microscopy (STXM) is common. These standards however can\nsuffer from inhomogeneity in chemical composition and thickness and often\nrequire further calculations, based on sample mounting and detector geometry,\nto obtain quantitative results. These inhomogeneities negatively impact the\nreproducibility of the measurements and the quantitative measure itself. Atomic\nLayer Deposition (ALD) is an inexpensive, scalable deposition technique known\nfor producing uniform, conformal films of a wide range of compounds on nearly\nany substrate material. These traits make it an ideal deposition method for\nproducing films to replace the NIST standards and create SRM on a wide range of\nrelevant 2D and 3D substrates. Utilizing Rutherford Backscattering, X-ray\nReflectivity, Quartz crystal microbalance, STXM, and SR-XRF we show that ALD is\ncapable of producing films that are homogenous over scales ranging from 100's\nof microns to nms\n", "  We consider wave propagation along fluid-loaded structures which take the\nform of an elastic plate augmented by an array of resonators forming a\nmetasurface, that is, a surface structured with sub-wavelength resonators. Such\nsurfaces have had considerable recent success for the control of wave\npropagation in electromagnetism and acoustics, by combining the vision of\nsub-wavelength wave manipulation, with the design, fabrication and size\nadvantages associated with surface excitation. We explore one aspect of recent\ninterest in this field: graded metasurfaces, but within the context of\nfluid-loaded structures.\n  Graded metasurfaces allow for selective spatial frequency separation and are\noften referred to as exhibiting rainbow trapping. Experiments, and theory, have\nbeen developed for acoustic, electromagnetic, and even elastic, rainbow devices\nbut this has not been approached for fluid-loaded structures that support\nsurface waves coupled with the acoustic field in a bulk fluid. This surface\nwave, coupled with the fluid, can be used to create an additional effect by\ndesigning a metasurface to mode convert from surface to bulk waves. We\ndemonstrate that sub-wavelength control is possible and that one can create\nboth rainbow trapping and mode conversion phenomena for a fluid-loaded elastic\nplate model.\n", "  In a recent work on fluid infiltration in a Hele-Shaw cell with the\npore-block geometry of Sierpinski carpets (SCs), the area filled by the\ninvading fluid was shown to scale as F~t^n, with n<1/2, thus providing a\nmacroscopic realization of anomalous diffusion [Filipovitch et al, Water\nResour. Res. 52 5167 (2016)]. The results agree with simulations of a diffusion\nequation with constant pressure at one of the borders of those fractals, but\nthe exponent n is very different from the anomalous exponent nu=1/D_W of single\nparticle diffusion in the same fractals (D_W is the random walk dimension).\nHere we use a scaling approach to show that those exponents are related as\nn=nu(D_F-D_B), where D_F and D_B are the fractal dimensions of the bulk and of\nthe border from which diffusing particles come, respectively. This relation is\nsupported by accurate numerical estimates in two SCs and in two generalized\nMenger sponges (MSs), in which we performed simulations of single particle\nrandom walks (RWs) with a rigid impermeable border and of a diffusive\ninfiltration model in which that border is permanently filled with diffusing\nparticles. This study includes one MS whose external border is also fractal.\nThe exponent relation is also consistent with the recent simulational and\nexperimental results on fluid infiltration in SCs, and explains the approximate\nquadratic dependence of n on D_F in these fractals. We also show that the\nmean-square displacement of single particle RWs has log-periodic oscillations,\nwhose periods are similar for fractals with the same scaling factor in the\ngenerator (even with different embedding dimensions), which is consistent with\nthe discrete scale invariance scenario. The roughness of a diffusion front\ndefined in the infiltration problem also shows this type of oscillation, which\nis enhanced in fractals with narrow channels between large lacunas.\n", "  Although more than 2,000 astronomical gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been\ndetected, and numerous models proposed to explain their occurrence, they have\nremained enigmatic owing to the lack of an obvious counterpart at other\nwavelengths. The recent ground-based detection of a transient source in the\nvicinity of GRB 970228 may therefore have provided a breakthrough. The optical\ncounterpart appears to be embedded in an extended source which, if a galaxy as\nhas been suggested, would lend weight to those models that place GRBs at\ncosmological distances. Here we report the observations using the Hubble Space\nTelescope of the transient counterpart and extended source 26 and 39 days after\nthe initial gamma-ray outburst. We find that the counterpart has faded since\nthe initial detection (and continues to fade), but the extended source exhibits\nno significant change in brightness between the two dates of observations\nreported here. The size and apparent constancy between the two epochs of HST\nobservations imply that it is extragalactic, but its faintness makes a\ndefinitive statement about its nature difficult. Nevertheless, the decay\nprofile of the transient source is consistent with a popular impulsive-fireball\nmodel, which assumes a merger between two neutron stars in a distant galaxy.\n", "  Lattice imaging facilitates digital implementation of optical darkfield\nstrategies that have for decades played a key role in the conventional electron\nmicroscopy of materials. Applications to the microscopy of periodic structures\nare described in the context of recent developments in the mathematical\nharmonic analysis community, with hopes of inspiring further development along\nthese lines. Applications here, which push present day limits using sharp-edged\nFourier windows alone, include the location of weak periodicities in images by\nvirtue of their spatial correlations, and the quantitative mapping of projected\nstrain in a variety of nanostructures.\n", "  It is shown that a Bose gas of two-level atoms in the intense resonant laser\nfield at zero temperature is a mixture of two condensates with a definite ratio\nof the densities. The criteria of stability are found for the stationary states\nof such system against the increment of the amplitudes of quasi Bogoliubov\nelementary excitations. Besides the usual acoustic mode the gap mode is shown\nto exist and the magnitude of the gap is proportional to the laser field\namplitude. The involvement of the gas nonideality under definite conditions\nresults in an instability and decay of the condensates.\n"]}
