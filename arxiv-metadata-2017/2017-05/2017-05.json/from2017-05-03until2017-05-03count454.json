"10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2011.03.109"], "abstract": ["  Binary black holes occupy a special place in our quest for understanding the\nevolution of galaxies along cosmic history. If massive black holes grow at the\ncenter of (pre-)galactic structures that experience a sequence of merger\nepisodes, then dual black holes form as inescapable outcome of galaxy assembly.\nBut, if the black holes reach coalescence, then they become the loudest sources\nof gravitational waves ever in the universe. Nature seems to provide a pathway\nfor the formation of these exotic binaries, and a number of key questions need\nto be addressed: How do massive black holes pair in a merger? Depending on the\nproperties of the underlying galaxies, do black holes always form a close\nKeplerian binary? If a binary forms, does hardening proceed down to the domain\ncontrolled by gravitational wave back reaction? What is the role played by gas\nand/or stars in braking the black holes, and on which timescale does\ncoalescence occur? Can the black holes accrete on flight and shine during their\npathway to coalescence? N-Body/hydrodynamical codes have proven to be vital\ntools for studying their evolution, and progress in this field is expected to\ngrow rapidly in the effort to describe, in full realism, the physics of stars\nand gas around the black holes, starting from the cosmological large scale of a\nmerger. If detected in the new window provided by the upcoming gravitational\nwave experiments, binary black holes will provide a deep view into the process\nof hierarchical clustering which is at the heart of the current paradigm of\ngalaxy formation. They will also be exquisite probes for testing General\nRelativity, as the theory of gravity. The waveforms emitted during the\ninspiral, coalescence and ring-down phase carry in their shape the sign of a\ndynamically evolving space-time and the proof of the existence of an horizon.\n", "  We examine the use of submm recombination lines of H, He and He$^+$ to probe\nthe extreme ultraviolet (EUV) luminosity of starbursts (SB) and AGN. We find\nthat the submm recombination lines of H, He and He$^+$ are in fact extremely\nreliable and quantitative probes of the EUV continuum at 13.6 eV to above 54.6\neV. At submm wavelengths, the recombination lines originate from low energy\nlevels (n = 20 -- 50). The maser amplification, which poses significant\nproblems for quantitative interpretation of the higher n, radio frequency\nrecombination lines, is insignificant. Lastly, at submm wavelengths the dust\nextinction is minimal. The submm line luminosities are therefore directly\nproportional to the emission measures ($EM_{ION} = n_e \\times n_{ion} \\times\n\\rm{volume}$) of their ionized regions. We also find that the expected line\nfluxes are detectable with ALMA and can be imaged at $\\sim0.1$\\arcsec\n~resolution in low redshift ULIRGs. Imaging of the HI lines will provide\naccurate spatial and kinematic mapping of the star formation distribution in\nlow-z IR-luminous galaxies. And the relative fluxes of the HI and HeII\nrecombination lines will strongly constrain the relative contributions of\nstarbursts and AGN to the luminosity. The HI lines should also provide an\navenue to constraining the submm dust extinction curve.\n", "  We present the cross-correlation function of MgII absorbers with respect to a\nvolume-limited sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at z=0.45-0.60 using the\nlargest MgII absorber sample and a new LRG sample from SDSS DR7. We present the\nclustering signal of absorbers on projected scales r_p = 0.3-35 Mpc/h in four\nWr(2796) bins spanning Wr(2796)=0.4-5.6A. We found that on average MgII\nabsorbers reside in halos < log M_h > \\approx 12.1, similar to the halo mass of\nan L_* galaxy. We report that the weakest absorbers in our sample with\nW_r(2796)=0.4-1.1A reside in relatively massive halos with < log M_h > \\approx\n12.5^{+0.6}_{-1.3}, while stronger absorbers reside in halos of similar or\nlower masses < log M_h > \\approx 11.6^{+0.9}. We compared our bias data points,\nb, and the frequency distribution function of absorbers, f_{W_r}, with a simple\nmodel incorporating an isothermal density profile to mimic the distribution of\nabsorbing gas in halos. We also compared the bias data points with Tinker &\nChen (2008) who developed halo occupation distribution models of MgII absorbers\nthat are constrained by b and f_{W_r}. The simple isothermal model can be ruled\nat a \\approx 2.8\\sigma level mostly because of its inability to reproduce\nf_{W_r}. However, b values are consistent with both models, including TC08. In\naddition, we show that the mean b of absorbers does not decrease beyond\nW_r(2796) \\approx 1.6A. The flat or potential upturn of b for Wr(2796) \\gtrsim\n1.6A absorbers suggests the presence of additional cool gas in massive halos.\n", "  The multiphase flow mechanism in miscible displacement through porous media\nis an important topic in various applications, such as petroleum engineering,\nlow Reynolds number suspension flows, dusty gas dynamics, and fluidized beds.\nTo simulate such flows, volume averaging spatial operators are considered to\nincorporate pressure drag and skin friction experienced by a porous medium. In\nthis work, a streamline-based Lagrangian methodology is extended for an\nefficient numerical approach to handle dispersion and diffusion of solvent\nsaturation during a miscible flow. Overall pressure drag on the diffusion and\ndispersion of solvent saturation is investigated. Numerical results show\nexcellent agreement with the results obtained from asymptotic analysis. The\npresent numerical simulations indicate that the nonlinear effects due to skin\nfriction and pressure drag cannot be accurately captured by Darcy's method if\nthe contribution of the skin friction dominates over that of the pressure drag.\nMoreover, mass conservation law is investigated, which is an important feature\nfor enhanced oil recovery, and the results help to guide a good agreement with\ntheory. This investigation examines how the flow regime may be optimized for\nenhanced oil recovery methods.\n", "  Finding the infection sources in a network when we only know the network\ntopology and infected nodes, but not the rates of infection, is a challenging\ncombinatorial problem, and it is even more difficult in practice where the\nunderlying infection spreading model is usually unknown a priori. In this\npaper, we are interested in finding a source estimator that is applicable to\nvarious spreading models, including the Susceptible-Infected (SI),\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR), Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected\n(SIRI), and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models. We show that under\nthe SI, SIR and SIRI spreading models and with mild technical assumptions, the\nJordan center is the infection source associated with the most likely infection\npath in a tree network with a single infection source. This conclusion applies\nfor a wide range of spreading parameters, while it holds for regular trees\nunder the SIS model with homogeneous infection and recovery rates. Since the\nJordan center does not depend on the infection, recovery and reinfection rates,\nit can be regarded as a universal source estimator. We also consider the case\nwhere there are k>1 infection sources, generalize the Jordan center definition\nto a k-Jordan center set, and show that this is an optimal infection source set\nestimator in a tree network for the SI model. Simulation results on various\ngeneral synthetic networks and real world networks suggest that Jordan\ncenter-based estimators consistently outperform the betweenness, closeness,\ndistance, degree, eigenvector, and pagerank centrality based heuristics, even\nif the network is not a tree.\n", "  The Quantum Fourier Transform offers an interesting way to perform arithmetic\noperations on a quantum computer. We review existing Quantum Fourier Transform\nadders and multipliers and propose some modifications that extend their\ncapabilities. Among the new circuits, we propose a quantum method to compute\nthe weighted average of a series of inputs in the transform domain.\n", "  We are interested in the motion of a classical charge acted upon an external\nconstant electromagnetic field where the back reaction of the particle's own\nfield is taken into account. The Landau-Lifshitz approximation to the\nLorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation is solved exactly and in closed form. It is\nshown that the ultrarelativistic limit of the Landau-Lifshitz equation for a\nradiating charge is the equation for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the\nexternal electromagnetic field tensor.\n", "  Steepest-Entropy-Ascent Quantum Thermodynamics (SEAQT) provides a general\nframework for the description of non-equilibrium phenomena at any level,\nparticularly the atomistic one. This theory and its dynamical postulate are\nused here to develop a general mathematical framework, which at an atomistic\nlevel, in particular, can be used to predict the non-equilibrium evolution in\nstate of a closed, chemically reactive mixture such as the one examined here,\ni.e., a mixture of hydrogen (H2) and flourine (F) contained in an isolated tank\nof fixed volume. The general framework provided, however, is written for a\nreactive system subject to multiple reaction mechanisms. To predict this\nevolution in state, both the energy and particle number eigenvalue problems for\na dilute gas are set up and solved analytically. Wall and non-ideal-gas\nbehavior effects are neglected, although the extension to dense gases is\nstraightforward but left for a future paper. The system-level energy and\nparticle number eigenvalues and eigenstates found are used in the nonlinear\nequation of motion of SEAQT to determine the time evolution of the\nthermodynamic state of the system, thus, effectively describing the reaction\nkinetics of the reaction and the system's relaxation to stable equilibrium. The\npredicted time evolution is then compared to the results of a standard detailed\nkinetic model used, in the near-equilibrium limit, to extract the single time\nconstant needed by the SEAQT equation of motion.\n", "  Everett's interpretation of quantum mechanics was proposed to avoid problems\ninherent in the prevailing interpretational frame. It assumes that quantum\nmechanics can be applied to any system and that the state vector always evolves\nunitarily. It then claims that whenever an observable is measured, all possible\nresults of the measurement exist. This notion of multiplicity has been\nunderstood in different ways by proponents of Everett's theory. In fact the\nspectrum of opinions on various ontological questions raised by Everett's\napproach is rather large, as we attempt to document in this critical review. We\nconclude that much remains to be done to clarify and specify Everett's\napproach.\n", "  We show that two density operators of mixed quantum states are in the same\nlocal unitary orbit if and only if they agree on polynomial invariants in a\ncertain Noetherian ring for which degree bounds are known in the literature.\nThis implicitly gives a finite complete set of invariants for local unitary\nequivalence. This is done by showing that local unitary equivalence of density\noperators is equivalent to local ${\\rm GL}$ equivalence and then using\ntechniques from algebraic geometry and geometric invariant theory. We also\nclassify the SLOCC polynomial invariants and give a degree bound for generators\nof the invariant ring in the case of $n$-qubit pure states. Of course it is\nwell known that polynomial invariants are not a complete set of invariants for\nSLOCC.\n", "  We introduce a sub-symmetry of a differential system as an infinitesimal\ntransformation of a subset of the system that leaves the subset invariant on\nthe solution set of the entire system. We discuss the geometrical meaning and\nproperties of sub-symmetries, as well as an algorithm for finding\nsub-symmetries of a system. We show some of the benefits of using\nsub-symmetries in the search for solutions of a system; in particular , we show\nhow sub-symmetries can be used in decoupling a differential system. We also\ndiscuss the role of sub-symmetries in the deformation of known conservation\nlaws of a system into other (often, new) conservation laws and show that, in\nthis regard, a sub-symmetry is a considerably more powerful tool than a regular\nsymmetry. We demonstrate that all lower conservation laws of the nonlinear\ntelegraph system can be generated by sub-symmetries.\n", "  Using the nested coordinate Bethe ansatz, we study 33-vertex models, where\nonly one global charge with degenerate eigenvalues exists and each site\npossesses three internal degrees of freedom. In the context of Markovian\nprocesses, they correspond to diffusing particles with two possible internal\nstates which may be exchanged during the diffusion (transmutation). The first\nstep of the nested coordinate Bethe ansatz is performed providing the\neigenvalues in terms of rapidities. We give the constraints ensuring the\nconsistency of the computations. These rapidities also satisfy Bethe equations\ninvolving $4\\times 4$ R-matrices, solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation which\nimplies new constraints on the models. We solve them allowing us to list all\nthe solvable 33-vertex models.\n", "  We present the first model that couples high-resolution simulations of the\nformation of Local Group galaxies with calculations of the galactic habitable\nzone (GHZ), a region of space which has sufficient metallicity to form\nterrestrial planets without being subject to hazardous radiation. These\nsimulations allow us to make substantial progress in mapping out the asymmetric\nthree-dimensional GHZ and its time evolution for the Milky Way (MW) and\nTriangulum (M33) galaxies, as opposed to works that generally assume an\nazimuthally symmetric GHZ.\n  Applying typical habitability metrics to MW and M33, we find that while a\nlarge number of habitable planets exist as close as a few kiloparsecs from the\ngalactic centre, the probability of individual planetary systems being\nhabitable rises as one approaches the edge of the stellar disc. Tidal streams\nand satellite galaxies also appear to be fertile grounds for habitable planet\nformation.\n  In short, we find that both galaxies arrive at similar GHZs by different\nevolutionary paths, as measured by the first and third quartiles of surviving\nbiospheres. For the Milky Way, this interquartile range begins as a narrow band\nat large radii, expanding to encompass much of the galaxy at intermediate times\nbefore settling at a range of 2-13kpc. In the case of M33, the opposite\nbehaviour occurs - the initial and final interquartile ranges are quite\nsimilar, showing gradual evolution. This suggests that galaxy assembly history\nstrongly influences the time evolution of the GHZ, which will affect the\nrelative time lag between biospheres in different galactic locations. We end by\nnoting the caveats involved in such studies and demonstrate that high\nresolution cosmological simulations will play a vital role in understanding\nhabitability on galactic scales, provided that these simulations accurately\nresolve chemical evolution.\n", "  Motivated by the recent realization of the Haldane model in shaking optical\nlattice, we investigate the effects of attractive interaction and BEC-BCS\ncrossover in this model at and away from half filling. We show that, contrary\nto the usual s-wave BEC-BCS crossover in the lattice, a topological superfluid\nwith Chern number C=2 appears in an extended region of phase space for\nintermediate strength of the attractive interaction in the interaction-density\nplane. When inversion symmetry is broken, a new gapless topological state is\nrealized. We also investigate the fluctuations in these superfluid phases and\nshow that the Anderson-Bogoliubov mode is quadratic due to time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking and the existence of an undamped Leggett mode in the strong\ncoupling limit.\n", "  An optical field inside a Fabry-Perot cavity would exhibit multistability\neither when an atomic medium, acting as a classical dielectric, is filled into\nthe cavity or when the cavity becomes optomechanical where one reflecting end\nbecomes movable. An external laser is essential in both cases to drive the\ncavity mode out of the zero equilibrium state. We study the equilibrium states\nof an atom-filled optomechanical cavity, where the atoms are considered a\ncollective two-level systems as well as an active component that replaces the\nrole of the driving laser. Multistability is found when the atomic ensemble is\nlossy, for which the complex atom-photon coupling breaks the\n\\mathcal{PT}-symmetry of the system Hamiltonian and matches in a periodic\npattern to the frequencies and the linewidths of the cavity mode and the\ncollective bosonic mode of the atoms. We show an input-output hystersis cycle\nbetween the atomic mode and the cavity mode to demonstrate the driving role the\natoms replace an extra-cavity laser.\n", "  We study for the first time the internal structure of 140Te through the\nbeta-delayed gamma-ray spectroscopy of 140Sb. The very neutron-rich 140Sb, Z =\n51 and N = 89, ions were produced by the in-flight fission of 238U beam on a\n9Be target at 345 MeV per nucleon at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory, RIKEN.\nThe half-life and spin-parity of 140Sb are reported as 124(30) ms and (4-),\nrespectively. In addition to the excited states of 140Te produced by the\nbeta-decay branch, the beta-delayed one-neutron and two-neutron emission\nbranches were also established. By identifying the first 2+ and 4+ excited\nstates of 140Te, we found that Te isotopes persist their vibrator character\nwith E(4+)/E(2+) = 2. We discuss the distinctive features manifest in this\nregion, such as valence neutron symmetry and asymmetry, revealed in pairs of\nisotopes with the same neutron holes and particles with respect to N = 82.\n", "  Trapping a Rydberg atom close to a surface is an important step towards the\nrealisation of many proposals of quantum information or hybrid quantum systems.\nOne of the challenges in these experiments is to overcome the electric field\nemanating from contaminations on the surface. Here we report on measurements of\nan electric field created by $^{87}$Rb atoms absorbed on a 25$\\,$nm thick layer\nof SiO$_2$, covering a 90$\\,$nm layer of Au. The electric field is measured\nusing a two-photon transition to the 23$D_{5/2}$ and 25$S_{1/2}$ state. The\nelectric field value that we measure is higher than typical values measured\nabove metal surfaces, but is consistent with other measurements above SiO$_2$\nsurfaces. In addition, we measure the temporal behaviour of the field and\nobserve that we can reduce it in a single experimental cycle, using UV light or\nby mildly heating the surface, whereas the buildup of the field takes thousands\nof cycles. We explain these results by a change in the ad-atoms distribution on\nthe surface. These results indicate that the stray electric field can be\nreduced, opening new possibilities for experiments with trapped Rydberg atoms\nnear surfaces.\n", "  We do a search for topological insulators which are associated with\nferromagnetic ordering and show anomalous quantum Hall effect, among transition\nmetal oxide superlattices taking the parent compounds as LaAlO3 and SrTiO3.\nAmong the various superlattices which are studied here, (LaAlO3)10/(LaOsO3)2\nexhibits a ferromagnetic ground state with a topologically non-trivial energy\ngap when a spin-orbit interaction is turned on. The study of transverse\nconductivity shows that the system has quantized Hall conductivity inside the\ntopological energy gap without applying any external magnetic field. The\nferromagnetic order parameters and the ordering temperature (Tc) have been\nestimated by taking a simple Heisenberg model of ferromagnetism.\n", "  We extract the long-distance asymptotic behaviour of two-point correlation\nfunctions in massless quantum integrable models containing multi-species\nexcitations. For such a purpose, we extend to these models the method of a\nlarge-distance regime re-summation of the form factor expansion of correlation\nfunctions. The key feature of our analysis is a technical hypothesis on the\nlarge-volume behaviour of the form factors of local operators in such models.\nWe check the validity of this hypothesis on the example of the\n$SU(3)$-invariant XXX magnet by means of the determinant representations for\nthe form factors of local operators in this model. Our approach confirms the\nstructure of the critical exponents obtained previously for numerous models\nsolvable by the nested Bethe Ansatz.\n", "  Band gap control by an external field is useful in various optical, infrared\nand THz applications. However, widely tunable band gaps are still not practical\ndue to variety of reasons. Using the orthogonal tight-binding method for\n$\\pi$-electrons, we have investigated the effect of the external electric field\non a subclass of monolayer chevron-type graphene nanoribbons that can be\nreferred to as jagged graphene nanoribbons. A classification of such ribbons\nwas proposed and band gaps for applied fields up to the SiO$_2$ breakdown\nstrength ($1$ V/nm) were calculated. According to the tight-binding model, band\ngap opening (or closing) takes place for some type of jagged graphene\nnanoribbons in the external electric field that lays in the plane of the\nstructure and perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. Tunability of the band\ngap up to $0.6$ eV is attainable for narrow ribbons. In the case of jagged\nribbons with armchair edges larger jags forming a chevron pattern of the ribbon\nenhance the controllability of the band gap. For jagged ribbons with zigzag and\narmchair edges regions of linear and quadratic dependence of the band gap on\nthe external electric field can be found that are useful in devices with\ncontrollable modulation of the band gap.\n", "  We present a version of the twin Higgs mechanism with vector-like top\npartners. In this setup all gauge anomalies automatically cancel, even without\ntwin leptons. The matter content of the most minimal twin sector is therefore\njust two twin tops and one twin bottom. The LHC phenomenology, illustrated with\ntwo example models, is dominated by twin glueball decays, possibly in\nassociation with Higgs bosons. We further construct an explicit\nfour-dimensional UV completion and discuss a variety of UV completions relevant\nfor both vector-like and fraternal twin Higgs models.\n", "  Neutron stars are thought to be born rapidly rotating and then exhibit a\nphase of a rotation-powered pulsations as they slow down to 1-10 s periods. The\nsignificant population of millisecond pulsars observed in our Galaxy is\nexplained by the recycling concept: during an epoch of accretion from a donor\nstar in a binary system, the neutron star is spun up to millisecond periods.\nHowever, only a few pulsars are observed during this recycling process, with\nrelatively high rotational frequencies. Here we report the detection of an\nX-ray pulsar with $P_{\\rm spin} = 1.20$ s in the globular cluster B091D in the\nAndromeda galaxy, the slowest pulsar ever found in a globular cluster. This\nbright (up-to 30% of the Eddington luminosity) spinning-up pulsar, persistent\nover the 12 years of observations, must have started accreting less than 1 Myr\nago and has not yet had time to accelerate to hundreds of Hz. The neutron star\nin this unique wide binary with an orbital period $P_{\\rm orb} = 30.5$ h in a\n12 Gyr old, metal rich star cluster, accretes from a low mass, slightly evolved\npost-main sequence companion. We argue that we are witnessing a binary formed\nat relatively recent epoch by getting a $\\sim 0.8M_\\odot$ star in a dynamical\ninteraction -- a viable scenario in a massive dense globular cluster like B091D\nwith high global and specific stellar encounter rates. This intensively\naccreting non-recycled X-ray pulsar provides therefore a long-sought missing\npiece in the standard pulsar recycling picture.\n", "  Doubts regarding the completeness of quantum mechanics as raised by Einstein,\nPodolsky and Rosen(EPR) have predominantly been resolved by resorting to a\nmeasurement of correlations between entangled photons which clearly demonstrate\nviolation of Bell's inequality. This article is an attempt to reconcile\nincompatibility of hidden variable theories with reality by demonstrating\nexperimentally a violation of Bell's inequality in locally correlated systems\nwhose two degrees of freedom, the spin and orbital angular momentum, are\nmaximally correlated. To this end we propose and demonstrate a linear,\nachromatic modified Sagnac interferometer to project orbital angular momentum\nstates which we combine with spin projections to measure correlations.\n", "  Recently, it has been suggested in [JHEP 12(2015)003] that the Brown-York\nmechanism can be used to measure the quasilocal energy in Lovelock gravity. We\nhave used this method in a system of M0-branes and show that the Brown-York\nenergy evolves in the process of birth and growth of Lovelock gravity. This can\nhelp us to predict phenomenological events which are emerged as due to\ndynamical structure of Lovelock gravity in our universe. In this model, first,\nM0-branes join to each other and form an M3-brane and an anti-M3-branes\nconnected by an M2-brane. This system is named BIon. Universes and\nanti-universes live on M3-branes and M2 plays the role of wormhole between\nthem. By passing time, M2 dissolves in M3's and nonlinear massive gravities,\nlike Lovelock massive gravity, emerges and grows. By closing M3-branes, BIon\nevolves and wormhole between branes makes a transition to black hole. During\nthis stage, Brown-York energy increases and shrinks to large values at the\ncolliding points of branes. By approaching M3-branes towards each other, the\nsquare energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states are\nproduced. To remove these states, M3-branes compact, the sign of compacted\ngravity changes, anti-gravity is created which leads to getting away of branes\nfrom each other. Also, the Lovelock gravity disappears and it's energy forms a\nnew M2 between M3-branes. By getting away of branes from each other, Brown-York\nenergy decreases and shrinks to zero.\n", "  The quantum transport of electrons in an artificial atom, such as a quantum\ndot (QD), is governed by the Coulomb blockade (CB) effects, revealing the\nground-state charge configuration of the electronic system under interplays of\nthe on-site strong Coulomb interactions. In a coherently-coupled QD array, i.e.\nartificial molecules, the phenomenon of collective CB (CCB) was predicted by\ntheoretical studies circa two decades ago but its evidence remains\ncontroversial. Here, we present direct evidence for the observation of CCB in a\nsix-quantum-dot array (QDA) under high magnetic fields at 20 mK. The coherent\ninter-dot coupling is enhanced and mediated via the Quantum Hall edge states of\nthe GaAs sample substrate. Two continuously fine-tuned gate voltages enable the\nquantum dot conductance spectrum to undergo a localization to delocalization\ntransition process which manifests as an emergence and a collapse of CCB. The\ntransition between these two distinct quantum phases is analogous to the\nMott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition. The gate-voltage-dependent conductance\nmap thus obtained makes it possible to utilize QDA as an on-chip laboratory for\nstudying CCB and Mott physics. Our QDA device provides a platform for\ndeveloping engineered QD materials, qubit systems and artificial molecular\ndevices in the future.\n", "  Mass measurements of astronomical objects are most wanted but still elusive.\nWe need them to trace the formation and evolution of cosmic structure but we\ncan get direct measurements only for a minority. This lack can be circumvented\nwith a proxy and a scaling relation. The twofold goal of estimating the\nunbiased relation and finding the right proxy value to plug in can be hampered\nby systematics, selection effects, Eddington/Malmquist biases and time\nevolution. We present a Bayesian hierarchical method which deals with these\nissues. Masses to be predicted are treated as missing data in the regression\nand are estimated together with the scaling parameters. The calibration\nsubsample with measured masses does not need to be representative of the full\nsample as far as it follows the same scaling relation. We apply the method to\nforecast weak lensing calibrated masses of the Planck, redMaPPer and MCXC\nclusters. Planck masses are biased low with respect to weak lensing calibrated\nmasses, with a bias more pronounced for high redshift clusters. MCXC masses are\nunder-estimated by ~20 per cent, which may be ascribed to hydrostatic bias.\nPackages and catalogs are made available with the paper.\n", "  The Fermi Bubbles are giant Galactic structures observed in both gamma-rays\nand microwaves. Recent studies have found support for the hypothesis that the\ngamma-ray and microwave emission can both be understood as arising from a hard\ncosmic-ray electron population within the volume of the Bubbles, via inverse\nCompton scattering and synchrotron radiation respectively. The relative rates\nof these processes are set by the relative energy density of the interstellar\nradiation field and the magnetic field within the Bubbles; consequently, under\nthe hypothesis of a common origin, the combination of the gamma-ray and\nmicrowave measurements can be used to estimate the magnetic field within the\nBubbles. We revisit the consistency of this hypothesis on a\nlatitude-by-latitude basis, using data from Fermi, WMAP and Planck; estimate\nthe variation of the electron spectrum within the Bubbles; and infer bounds on\nthe magnetic field within the Bubbles as a function of distance from the\nGalactic plane. We find that while the microwave and gamma-ray spectra are\ngenerally consistent with the leptonic hypothesis for few-microGauss magnetic\nfields, there appears to be a preference for spectral hardening in the\nmicrowaves at mid-latitudes (especially in the |b|~ 25-35 degree range) that is\nnot mirrored in the gamma rays. This result may hint at a non-leptonic\ncontribution to the gamma-ray spectra; however, the discrepancy can be\nreconciled in purely leptonic models if the cutoff energy for the electrons is\nlower in this latitude range and the spectrum below the cutoff is harder.\n", "  We develop Haag-Ruelle scattering theory for Wigner particles in local\nrelativistic Quantum Field Theory without assuming mass gaps or any other\nrestrictions on the spectrum of the mass operator near the particle masses. Our\napproach is based on the Reeh-Schlieder property of the vacuum state. It is\nshown that a strengthened variant of this property, concerning the relative\napproximation error for single-particle states, implies the existence of\nscattering states.\n", "  We introduce a double power series method for finding approximate analytical\nsolutions for systems of differential equations commonly found in cosmological\nperturbation theory. The method was set out, in a non-cosmological context, by\nFeshchenko, Shkil' and Nikolenko (FSN) in 1966, and is applicable to cases\nwhere perturbations are on sub-horizon scales. The FSN method is essentially an\nextension of the well known Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method for finding\napproximate analytical solutions for ordinary differential equations. The FSN\nmethod we use is applicable well beyond perturbation theory to solve systems of\nordinary differential equations, linear in the derivatives, that also depend on\na small parameter, which here we take to be related to the inverse wave-number.\n  We use the FSN method to find new approximate oscillating solutions in linear\norder cosmological perturbation theory for a flat radiation-matter universe.\nTogether with this model's well known growing and decaying M\\'esz\\'aros\nsolutions, these oscillating modes provide a complete set of sub-horizon\napproximations for the metric potential, radiation and matter perturbations.\nComparison with numerical solutions of the perturbation equations shows that\nour approximations can be made accurate to within a typical error of 1%, or\nbetter. We also set out a heuristic method for error estimation. A Mathematica\nnotebook which implements the double power series method is made available\nonline.\n", "  The most sensitive process able to probe the Majorana nature of neutrinos and\ndiscover Lepton Number Violation is the neutrino-less double beta decay. Thanks\nto the excellent energy resolution, efficiency and intrinsic radio-purity,\ncryogenic calorimeters are primed for the search for this process. A novel\napproach able to improve the sensitivity of the current experiments is the\nrejection of $\\alpha$ interactions, that represents the dominant background\nsource. In TeO$_2$ calorimeters, $\\alpha$ particles can be tagged as, in\ncontrast to electrons, they do not emit Cherenkov light. Nevertheless, the very\nlow amount of detected Cherenkov light undermines the complete rejection of\n$\\alpha$ background. In this paper we compare the results obtained in previous\nmeasurements of the TeO$_2$ light yield with a detailed Monte Carlo simulation\nable to reproduce the number of Cherenkov photons produced in $\\beta/\\gamma$\ninteractions within the calorimeter and their propagation in the experimental\nset-up. We demonstrate that the light yield detectable from a\n$5\\times5\\times5$~cm$^{3}$ TeO$_2$ bolometer can be increased by up to 60% by\nincreasing the surface roughness of the crystal and improving the light\ndetector design. Moreover, we study the possibility to disentangle $\\alpha$,\n$\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ interactions, which represent the ultimate background\nsource. Unfortunately $\\gamma$ rejection is not feasible but $\\alpha$ rejection\ncan be achieved exploiting high sensitivity light detectors.\n", "  We examine the possibility of using graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with directly\nsubstituted chromium atoms as spintronic device. Using density functional\ntheory, we simulate a voltage bias across a constructed GNR in a device setup,\nwhere a magnetic dimer has been substituted into the lattice. Through this\nfirst principles approach, we calculate the electronic and magnetic properties\nas a function of Hubbard U, voltage, and magnetic configuration. By calculating\nof the total energy of each magnetic configuration, we determine that initial\nantiferromagnetic ground state flips to a ferromagnetic state with applied\nbias. Mapping this transition point to the calculated conductance for the\nsystem reveals that there is a distinct change in conductance through the GNR,\nwhich indicates the possibility of a spin valve. We also show that this\ncorresponds to a distinct change in the induced magnetization within the\ngraphene.\n", "  In this review we present a progress report of the connection between\nlong-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their accompanying supernovae (SNe).\nThe analysis is from the point of view of an observer, with much of the\nemphasis placed on how observations, and the modelling of observations, have\nconstrained what we known about GRB-SNe. We discuss their photometric and\nspectroscopic properties, their role as cosmological probes, including their\nmeasured luminosity$-$decline relationships, and how they can be used to\nmeasure the Hubble constant. We present a statistical analysis of their\nbolometric properties, and use this to determine the properties of the\n\"average\" GRB-SNe: which has a kinetic energy of $E_{\\rm K} \\approx\n2.5\\times10^{52}$ erg, an ejecta mass of $M_{\\rm ej} \\approx 6$ M$_{\\odot}$, a\nnickel mass of $M_{\\rm Ni} \\approx 0.4$ M$_{\\odot}$, a peak photospheric\nvelocity of $v_{\\rm ph} \\approx 21,000$ km s$^{-1}$, a peak bolometric\nluminosity of $L_{\\rm p} \\approx 1\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and it reaches\npeak bolometric light in $t_{\\rm p} \\approx 13$ days. We discuss their\ngeometry, consider the various physical processes that are thought to power the\nluminosity of GRB-SNe, and whether differences exist between GRB-SNe and the\nSNe associated with ultra-long duration GRBs. We discuss how observations of\nthe environments of GRB-SNe further constrain the physical properties of their\nprogenitor stars, and give an overview of the current theoretical paradigms of\ntheir suspected central engines. We also present an overview of the\nradioactively powered transients that have been photometrically associated with\nshort-duration GRBs. We conclude the review by discussing what additional\nresearch is needed to further our understanding of GRB-SNe, in particular the\nrole of binary-formation channels and the connection of GRB-SNe with\nsuperluminous SNe (abridged).\n", "  We present a list of galaxy-scale lens candidates including a highly probable\ninteracting galaxy-scale lens in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging survey. We\ncombine HSC imaging with the blended-spectra catalog from the Galaxy And Mass\nAssembly (GAMA) survey to identify lens candidates, and use lens mass modeling\nto confirm the candidates. We find 46 matches between the HSC S14A_0b imaging\ndata release and the GAMA catalog. Ten of them are probable lens systems\naccording to their morphology and redshifts. There is one system with an\ninteracting galaxy pair, HSC J084928+000949, that has a valid mass model. We\npredict the total mass enclosed by the Einstein radius of $\\sim0.72$\"\n($\\sim1.65$kpc) for this new expected lens system to be\n$\\sim10^{10.59}M_{\\odot}$. Using the photometry in the {\\it grizy} bands of the\nHSC survey and stellar population synthesis modeling with a Salpeter stellar\ninitial mass function, we estimate the stellar mass within the Einstein radius\nto be $\\sim10^{10.46}\\,M_{\\odot}$. We thus find a dark matter mass fraction\nwithin the Einstein radius of $\\sim25\\%$. Further spectroscopy or\nhigh-resolution imaging would allow confirmation of the nature of these lens\ncandidates. The particular system with the interacting galaxy pair, if\nconfirmed, would provide an opportunity to study the interplay between dark\nmatter and stars as galaxies build up through hierarchical mergers.\n", "  We present a newly developed moving-mesh technique for the multi-dimensional\nBoltzmann-Hydro code for the simulation of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe).\nWhat makes this technique different from others is the fact that it treats not\nonly hydrodynamics but also neutrino transfer in the language of the 3+1\nformalism of general relativity (GR), making use of the shift vector to specify\nthe time evolution of the coordinate system. This means that the transport part\nof our code is essentially general relativistic although in this paper it is\napplied only to the moving curvilinear coordinates in the flat Minknowski\nspacetime, since the gravity part is still Newtonian. The numerical aspect of\nthe implementation is also described in detail. Employing the axisymmetric\ntwo-dimensional version of the code, we conduct two test computations:\noscillations and runaways of proto-neutron star (PNS). We show that our new\nmethod works fine, tracking the motions of PNS correctly. We believe that this\nis a major advancement toward the realistic simulation of CCSNe.\n", "  We study the high temperature series expansion of the Berkooz-Douglas matrix\nmodel which describes the D0/D4--brane system. At high temperature the model is\nweakly coupled and we develop the series to second order. We check our results\nagainst the high temperature regime of the bosonic model (without fermions) and\nfind excellent agreement. We track the temperature dependence of the bosonic\nmodel and find backreaction of the fundamental fields lifts the zero\ntemperature adjoint mass degeneracy. In the low temperature phase the system is\nwell described by a gaussian model with three masses $m^t_A=1.964 \\pm 0.003$,\n$m^l_A=2.001 \\pm 0.003$ and $m_f=1.463 \\pm 0.001$, the adjoint longitudional\nand transverse masses and the mass of the fundamental fields respectively.\n", "  The Bass model, which is an effective forecasting tool for innovation\ndiffusion based on large collections of empirical data, assumes an homogeneous\ndiffusion process. We introduce a network structure into this model and we\ninvestigate numerically the dynamics in the case of networks with link density\n$P(k)=c/k^\\gamma$, where $k=1, \\ldots , N$. The resulting curve of the total\nadoptions in time is qualitatively similar to the homogeneous Bass curve\ncorresponding to a case with the same average number of connections. The peak\nof the adoptions, however, tends to occur earlier, particularly when $\\gamma$\nand $N$ are large (i.e., when there are few hubs with a large maximum number of\nconnections). Most interestingly, the adoption curve of the hubs anticipates\nthe total adoption curve in a predictable way, with peak times which can be,\nfor instance when $N=100$, between 10% and 60% of the total adoptions peak.\nThis may allow to monitor the hubs for forecasting purposes. We also consider\nthe case of networks with assortative and disassortative correlations and a\ncase of inhomogeneous advertising where the publicity terms are \"targeted\" on\nthe hubs while maintaining their total cost constant.\n", "  The Frontier Fields are a director's discretionary time campaign with HST and\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope to see deeper into the universe than ever before.\nThe Frontier Fields combine the power of HST and Spitzer with the natural\ngravitational telescopes of massive high-magnification clusters of galaxies to\nproduce the deepest observations of clusters and their lensed galaxies ever\nobtained. Six clusters - Abell 2744, MACSJ0416.1-2403, MACSJ0717.5+3745,\nMACSJ1149.5+2223, Abell S1063, and Abell 370 - were selected based on their\nlensing strength, sky darkness, Galactic extinction, parallel field\nsuitability, accessibility to ground-based facilities, HST, Spitzer and JWST\nobservability, and pre-existing ancillary data. These clusters have been\ntargeted by the HST ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR with coordinated parallels of adjacent\nblank fields for over 840 HST orbits. The Spitzer Space Telescope has dedicated\n> 1000 hours of director's discretionary time to obtain IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron\nimaging to ~26.5, 26.0 ABmag 5-sigma point-source depths in the six cluster and\nsix parallel Frontier Fields. The Frontier Field parallel fields are the\nsecond-deepest observations thus far by HST with ~29th ABmag 5-sigma point\nsource depths in seven optical - near-infrared bandpasses. Galaxies behind the\nFrontier Field cluster lenses experience typical magnification factors of a\nfew, with small regions near the critical curves magnified by factors 10-100.\nTherefore, the Frontier Field cluster HST images achieve intrinsic depths of\n~30-33 magnitudes over very small volumes. Early studies of the Frontier Fields\nhave probed galaxies fainter than any seen before during the epoch of\nreionization 6 < z < 10, mapped out the cluster dark matter to unprecedented\nresolution, and followed lensed transient events.\n", "  We study the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) signature in South Pole\nTelescope (SPT) data for an ensemble of 719 optically identified galaxy\nclusters selected from 124.6 deg$^2$ of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) science\nverification data, detecting a stacked SZE signal down to richness\n$\\lambda\\sim20$. The SZE signature is measured using matched-filtered maps of\nthe 2500 deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey at the positions of the DES clusters, and the\ndegeneracy between SZE observable and matched-filter size is broken by adopting\nas priors SZE and optical mass-observable relations that are either calibrated\nusing SPT selected clusters or through the Arnaud et al. (2010, A10) X-ray\nanalysis. We measure the SPT signal to noise $\\zeta$-$\\lambda$, relation and\ntwo integrated Compton-$y$ $Y_\\textrm{500}$-$\\lambda$ relations for the\nDES-selected clusters and compare these to model expectations accounting for\nthe SZE-optical center offset distribution. For clusters with $\\lambda > 80$,\nthe two SPT calibrated scaling relations are consistent with the measurements,\nwhile for the A10-calibrated relation the measured SZE signal is smaller by a\nfactor of $0.61 \\pm 0.12$ compared to the prediction. For clusters at $20 <\n\\lambda < 80$, the measured SZE signal is smaller by a factor of\n$\\sim$0.20-0.80 (between 2.3 and 10~$\\sigma$ significance) compared to the\nprediction, with the SPT calibrated scaling relations and larger $\\lambda$\nclusters showing generally better agreement. We quantify the required\ncorrections to achieve consistency, showing that there is a richness dependent\nbias that can be explained by some combination of contamination of the\nobservables and biases in the estimated masses. We discuss possible physical\neffects, as contamination from line-of-sight projections or from point sources,\nlarger offsets in the SZE-optical centering or larger scatter in the\n$\\lambda$-mass relation at lower richnesses.\n", "  We show that for a particular choice of gauge the vector potential of any\nnon-radiating source is spatially localized along with its electric and\nmagnetic fields. Important on its own, this special property of non-radiating\nsources dramatically simplifies the analysis of their quantitative aspects, and\nenables the interpretation of non-radiating sources as distributions of the\nelementary dynamic anapoles. Using the developed approach we identify and\ndiscuss a possible scenario for observing the time-dependent version of the\nAharonov-Bohm effect in such systems.\n", "  We present a dynamical explanation of the hollowness effect observed in\nproton-proton scattering at $\\sqrt s\\!=\\!7$ TeV. This phenomenon, not observed\nat lower energies, consists in a depletion of the inelasticity density at zero\nimpact parameter of the collision. Our analysis is based on three main\ningredients: we rely gluonic hot spots inside the proton as effective degrees\nof freedom for the description of the scattering process. Next we assume that\nsome non-trivial correlation between the transverse positions of the hot spots\ninside the proton exists. Finally we build the scattering amplitude from a\nmultiple scattering, Glauber-like series of collisions between hot spots. In\nour approach, the onset of the hollowness effect is naturally explained as due\nto the diffusion or growth of the hot spots in the transverse plane with\nincreasing collision energy.\n", "  The first result of the present paper is to provide classes of explicit\nsolutions for integrable boundary matrices for the multi-species ASEP with an\narbitrary number of species.\n  All the solutions we have obtained can be seen as representations of a new\nalgebra that contains the boundary Hecke algebra. The boundary Hecke algebra is\nnot sufficient to build these solutions. This is the second result of our\npaper.\n", "  Measurements of the luminosity distance have played a key role in discovering\nthe late-time cosmic acceleration. However, when accounting for inhomogeneities\nin the Universe, its interpretation has been plagued with infrared divergences\nin its theoretical predictions, which are in some cases used to explain the\ncosmic acceleration without dark energy. The divergences in most calculations\nare artificially removed by imposing an infrared cut-off scale. For the first\ntime, we show that a gauge-invariant calculation of the luminosity distance is\ndevoid of such divergences and consistent with the equivalence principle,\neliminating the need to impose a cut-off scale. We present proper numerical\ncalculations of the luminosity distance using the gauge-invariant expression\nand demonstrate that the numerical results with an ad hoc cut-off scale in\nprevious calculations have negligible systematic errors as long as the cut-off\nscale is larger than the horizon scale. We discuss the origin of infrared\ndivergences and their cancellation in the luminosity distance.\n", "  Although Zipf's law is widespread in natural and social data, one often\nencounters situations where one or both ends of the ranked data deviate from\nthe power-law function. Previously we proposed the Beta rank function to\nimprove the fitting of data which does not follow a perfect Zipf's law. Here we\nshow that when the two parameters in the Beta rank function have the same\nvalue, the Lavalette rank function, the probability density function can be\nderived analytically. We also show both computationally and analytically that\nLavalette distribution is approximately equal, though not identical, to the\nlognormal distribution. We illustrate the utility of Lavalette rank function in\nseveral datasets. We also address three analysis issues on the statistical\ntesting of Lavalette fitting function, comparison between Zipf's law and\nlognormal distribution through Lavalette function, and comparison between\nlognormal distribution and Lavalette distribution.\n", "  The finite-temperature transport properties of FeRh compounds are\ninvestigated by first-principles Density Functional Theory-based calculations.\nThe focus is on the behavior of the longitudinal resistivity with rising\ntemperature, which exhibits an abrupt decrease at the metamagnetic transition\npoint, $T = T_m$ between ferro- and antiferromagnetic phases. A detailed\nelectronic structure investigation for $T \\geq 0$ K explains this feature and\ndemonstrates the important role of (i) the difference of the electronic\nstructure at the Fermi level between the two magnetically ordered states and\n(ii) the different degree of thermally induced magnetic disorder in the\nvicinity of $T_m$, giving different contributions to the resistivity. To\nsupport these conclusions, we also describe the temperature dependence of the\nspin-orbit induced anomalous Hall resistivity and Gilbert damping parameter.\nFor the various response quantities considered the impact of thermal lattice\nvibrations and spin fluctuations on their temperature dependence is\ninvestigated in detail. Comparison with corresponding experimental data finds\nin general a very good agreement.\n", "  We propose to use pulsar scintillation measurements to test predictions of\nalternative theories of gravity. Comparing to single-path pulsar timing\nmeasurements, the scintillation measurements can achieve a factor of 10^5\nimprovement in timing accuracy, due to the effect of multi-path interference.\nPrevious scintillation measurements of PSR B0834+06 have data acquisition for\nhours, making this approach sensitive to mHz gravitational waves. Therefore it\nhas unique advantages in measuring gravitational effect or other mechanisms (at\nmHz and above frequencies) on light propagation. We illustrate its application\nin constraining scalar gravitational-wave background, in which case the\nsensitivities can be greatly improved with respect to previous limits. We\nexpect much broader applications in testing gravity with existing and future\npulsar scintillation observations.\n", "  We demonstrate a two phase-grating, multi-beam neutron interferometer by\nusing a modified Ronchi setup in a far-field regime. The functionality of the\ninterferometer is based on the universal \\moire effect that was recently\nimplemented for X-ray phase-contrast imaging in the far-field regime.\nInterference fringes were achieved with monochromatic, bichromatic, and\npolychromatic neutron beams; for both continuous and pulsed beams. This\nfar-field neutron interferometry allows for the utilization of the full neutron\nflux for precise measurements of potential gradients, and expands neutron\nphase-contrast imaging techniques to more intense polycromatic neutron beams.\n", "  LISA Pathfinder's measurement of a relative acceleration noise between two\nfree-falling test masses with a square root of the power spectral density of\n$5.2 \\pm 0.1 \\mbox{ fm s}^{-2}/\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$ appreciably constrains collapse\nmodels. In particular, we bound the localization rate parameter, $\\lambda_{\\rm\nCSL}$, in the continuous spontaneous localization model (CSL) to be at most\n$\\left( 2.96 \\pm 0.12 \\right) \\times 10^{-8} \\mbox{ s}^{-1}$. Moreover, we\nbound the regularization scale, $\\sigma_{\\rm DP}$, used in the Diosi-Penrose\n(DP) model to be at least $40.1 \\pm 0.5 \\mbox{ fm}$. These bounds significantly\nconstrain the validity of these models. In particular: (i) a lower bound of\n$2.2 \\times 10^{-8\\pm2} \\mbox{s}^{-1}$ for $\\lambda_{\\rm CSL}$ has been\nproposed in (although a lower bound of about $10^{-17} \\mbox{s}^{-1}$ is\nsometimes used), in order for the collapse noise to be substantial enough to\nexplain the phenomenology of quantum measurement, and (ii) 40 fm is larger than\nthe size of any nucleus, while the regularization scale has been proposed to be\nthe size of the nucleus.\n", "  In spite of the vast literature on spreading dynamics on complex networks,\nthe role of local synergy, i.e., the interaction of elements that when combined\nproduce a total effect greater than the sum of the individualelements, has been\nstudied but only for irreversible spreading dynamics. Reversible spreading\ndynamics are ubiquitous but their interplay with synergy has remained unknown.\nTo fill this knowledge gap, we articulate a model to incorporate local\nsynergistic effect into the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible process,\nin which the probability for a susceptible node to become infected through an\ninfected neighbor is enhanced when the neighborhood of the latter contains a\nnumber of infected nodes. We derive master equations incorporating the\nsynergistic effect, with predictions that agree well with the numerical\nresults. A striking finding is that, when a parameter characterizing the\nstrength of the synergy reinforcement effect is above a critical value, the\nsteady state density of the infected nodes versus the basic transmission rate\nexhibits an explosively increasing behavior and a hysteresis loop emerges. In\nfact, increasing the synergy strength can promote the spreading and reduce the\ninvasion and persistence thresholds of the hysteresis loop. A physical\nunderstanding of the synergy promoting explosive spreading and the associated\nhysteresis behavior can be obtained through a mean-field analysis.\n", "  We discuss the collective modes in an alkaline-earth Fermi gas close to an\norbital Feshbach resonance. Unlike the usual Feshbach resonance, the orbital\nFeshbach resonance in alkaline-earth atoms realizes a two-band superfluid\nsystem where the fermionic nature of both the open and the closed channel has\nto be taken into account. We show that apart from the usual Anderson-Bogoliubov\nmode which corresponds to the oscillation of total density, there also appears\nthe long-sought Leggett mode corresponding to the oscillation of relative\ndensity between the two channels. The existence of the phonon and the Leggett\nmodes and their evolution are discussed in detail. We show how these collective\nmodes are reflected in the density response of the system.\n", "  A pair of neutral atoms separated by several microns and prepared in\nidentical s-states of large principal quantum number experience a van der Waals\ninteraction. If microwave fields are used to generate a superposition of\ns-states with different principal quantum numbers, a null point may be found at\nwhich a specific superposition state experiences no van der Waals interaction.\nAn application of this novel Rydberg state in a quantum controlled-Z gate is\nproposed, which takes advantage of GHz rate transitions to nearby Rydberg\nstates. A gate operation time in the tens of nanoseconds is predicted.\n", "  We present an approach to theoretical assessment of the mean specific\ninterface area $(\\delta{S}/\\delta{V})$ for a well-stirred system of two\nimmiscible liquids experiencing interfacial boiling. The assessment is based on\nthe balance of transformations of mechanical energy and the laws of the\nmomentum and heat transfer in the turbulent boundary layer. The theory yields\nrelations between the specific interface area and the characteristics of the\nsystem state. In particular, this allows us to derive the equations of\nself-cooling dynamics of the system in the absence of external heat supply. The\nresults provide possibility for constructing a self-contained mathematical\ndescription of the process of interfacial boiling. In this study, we assume the\nvolume fractions of two components to be similar as well as the values of their\nkinematic viscosity and molecular heat diffusivity.\n", "  Strong gravitational lens systems with time delays between the multiple\nimages allow measurements of time-delay distances, which are primarily\nsensitive to the Hubble constant that is key to probing dark energy, neutrino\nphysics, and the spatial curvature of the Universe, as well as discovering new\nphysics. We present H0LiCOW ($H_0$ Lenses in COSMOGRAIL's Wellspring), a\nprogram that aims to measure $H_0$ with $<3.5\\%$ uncertainty from five lens\nsystems (B1608+656, RXJ1131-1231, HE0435-1223, WFI2033-4723 and HE1104-1805).\nWe have been acquiring (1) time delays through COSMOGRAIL and Very Large Array\nmonitoring, (2) high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging for the lens\nmass modeling, (3) wide-field imaging and spectroscopy to characterize the lens\nenvironment, and (4) moderate-resolution spectroscopy to obtain the stellar\nvelocity dispersion of the lenses for mass modeling. In cosmological models\nwith one-parameter extension to flat $\\Lambda$CDM, we expect to measure $H_0$\nto $<3.5\\%$ in most models, spatial curvature $\\Omega_{\\rm k}$ to 0.004, $w$ to\n0.14, and the effective number of neutrino species to 0.2 (1$\\sigma$\nuncertainties) when combined with current CMB experiments. These are,\nrespectively, a factor of $\\sim15$, $\\sim2$, and $\\sim1.5$ tighter than CMB\nalone. Our data set will further enable us to study the stellar initial mass\nfunction of the lens galaxies, and the co-evolution of supermassive black holes\nand their host galaxies. This program will provide a foundation for extracting\ncosmological distances from the hundreds of time-delay lenses that are expected\nto be discovered in current and future surveys.\n", "  Near zero temperature, quantum magnetism can non-trivially arise from\nshort-range interactions, but the occurrence of magnetic order depends\ncrucially on the interplay of interactions, lattice geometry, dimensionality\nand doping. Even though the consequences of this interplay are not yet fully\nunderstood, quantum magnetism is believed to be connected to a range of complex\nphenomena in the solid state, for example, in the context of high-$T_c$\nsuperconductivity and spin liquids in frustrated lattices. Ultracold atomic\nFermi gases in optical lattices constitute an experimental system with\nunrivalled tunability and detection capabilities to explore quantum magnetism\nby analog quantum simulation. In this work, we study the emergence of\nantiferromagnetic correlations between ultracold fermionic atoms in two\ndimensions with decreasing temperature. We determine the magnetic\nsusceptibility of the Hubbard model from simultaneous measurements of the\nin-situ density of both spin components. At half-filling and strong\ninteractions our data approach the Heisenberg model of localized spins with\nantiferromagnetic correlations. Moreover, we observe the disappearance of\nmagnetic correlations when the system is doped away from half-filling. Our\nobservation of the dependence of quantum magnetism on doping paves the way for\nfuture studies on the emergence of pseudogap and pairing phenomena away from\nhalf-filling.\n", "  I have used a practical method to calculate the one-loop quantum correction\nto the energy of the non-topological soliton in Friedberg-Lee model. The\nquantum effects which come from the quarks of the Dirac sea scattering with the\nsoliton bag are calculated by a summation of the discrete and continuum energy\nspectrum of the Dirac equation in the background field of soliton. The phase\nshift of the continuum spectrum is numerically calculated in an efficient way\nand all the divergences are removed by the same renormalization procedure.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological implications of studying galaxy clustering\nusing a tomographic approach applied to the final BOSS DR12 galaxy sample,\nincluding both auto- and cross-correlation functions between redshift shells.\nWe model the signal of the full shape of the angular correlation function,\n$\\omega(\\theta)$, in redshift bins using state-of-the-art modelling of\nnon-linearities, bias and redshift-space distortions. We present results on the\nredshift evolution of the linear bias of BOSS galaxies, which cannot be\nobtained with traditional methods for galaxy-clustering analysis. We also\nobtain constraints on cosmological parameters, combining this tomographic\nanalysis with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia\nsupernova (SNIa). We explore a number of cosmological models, including the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model and its most interesting extensions, such as\ndeviations from $w_\\rm{DE} = -1$, non-minimal neutrino masses, spatial\ncurvature and deviations from general relativity using the growth-index\n$\\gamma$ parametrisation. These results are, in general, comparable to the most\nprecise present-day constraints on cosmological parameters, and show very good\nagreement with the standard model. In particular, combining CMB,\n$\\omega(\\theta)$ and SNIa, we find a value of $w_\\rm{DE}$ consistent with $-1$\nto a precision better than 5\\% when it is assumed to be constant in time, and\nbetter than 6\\% when we also allow for a spatially-curved Universe.\n", "  We present measurements of the clustering of galaxies as a function of their\nstellar mass in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We compare the\nclustering of samples using 12 different methods for estimating stellar mass,\nisolating the method that has the smallest scatter at fixed halo mass. In this\ntest, the stellar mass estimate with the smallest errors yields the highest\namplitude of clustering at fixed number density. We find that the PCA stellar\nmasses of Chen etal (2012) clearly have the tightest correlation with halo\nmass. The PCA masses use the full galaxy spectrum, differentiating them from\nother estimates that only use optical photometric information. Using the PCA\nmasses, we measure the large-scale bias as a function of Mgal for galaxies with\nlogMgal>=11.4, correcting for incompleteness at the low-mass end of our\nmeasurements. Using the abundance-matching ansatz to connect dark matter halo\nmass to stellar mass, we construct theoretical models of b(Mgal) that match the\nsame stellar mass function but have different amounts of scatter in stellar\nmass at fixed halo mass, sigma_logM. Using this approach, we find\nsigma_logM=0.18^{+0.01}_{-0.02}. This value includes both intrinsic scatter as\nwell as random errors in the stellar masses. To partially remove the latter, we\nuse repeated spectra to estimate statistical errors on the stellar masses,\nyielding an upper limit to the intrinsic scatter of 0.16 dex.\n", "  Quantum systems lose coherence upon interaction with the environment and tend\ntowards classical states. Quantum coherence is known to exponentially decay in\ntime so that macroscopic quantum superpositions are generally unsustainable. In\nthis work, slower than exponential decay of coherences is experimentally\nrealized in an atom-optics kicked rotor system subjected to non-stationary\nL\\'{e}vy noise in the applied kick sequence. The slower coherence decay\nmanifests in the form of quantum subdiffusion that can be controlled through\nthe L\\'{e}vy exponent. The experimental results are in good agreement with the\nanalytical estimates and numerical simulations for the mean energy growth and\nmomentum profiles of atom-optics kicked rotor.\n", "  It has been thought that the long chiral edge channels cannot support any\nsupercurrent between the superconducting electrodes. We show theoretically that\nthe supercurrent can be mediated by a non-local interaction that facilitates a\nlong-distance information transfer in the direction opposite to electron flow.\nWe compute the supercurrent for several interaction models, including that of\nan external circuit.\n", "  Upcoming observations of the 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization will\nsoon provide the first direct detection of this era. This signal is influenced\nby many astrophysical effects, including long range X-ray heating of the\nintergalactic gas. During the preceding Cosmic Dawn era the impact of this\nheating on the 21-cm signal is particularly prominent, especially before spin\ntemperature saturation. We present the largest-volume (349\\,Mpc\ncomoving=244~$h^{-1}$Mpc) full numerical radiative transfer simulations to date\nof this epoch that include the effects of helium and multi-frequency heating,\nboth with and without X-ray sources. We show that X-ray sources contribute\nsignificantly to early heating of the neutral intergalactic medium and, hence,\nto the corresponding 21-cm signal. The inclusion of hard, energetic radiation\nyields an earlier, extended transition from absorption to emission compared to\nthe stellar-only case. The presence of X-ray sources decreases the absolute\nvalue of the mean 21-cm differential brightness temperature. These hard sources\nalso significantly increase the 21-cm fluctuations compared the common\nassumption of temperature saturation. The 21-cm differential brightness\ntemperature power spectrum is initially boosted on large scales, before\ndecreasing on all scales. Compared to the case of the cold, unheated\nintergalactic medium, the signal has lower rms fluctuations and increased\nnon-Gaussianity, as measured by the skewness and kurtosis of the 21-cm\nprobability distribution functions. Images of the 21-cm signal with resolution\naround 11~arcmin still show fluctuations well above the expected noise for deep\nintegrations with the SKA1-Low, indicating that direct imaging of the X-ray\nheating epoch could be feasible.\n", "  We consider a population of globally coupled oscillators driven by common\nnoise. By applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz and by averaging over the fast\noscillations, we obtain analytically tractable equations for the noisy\nevolution of the order parameter. While noise always tends to synchronize the\noscillators, the coupling can act against synchrony if it is repulsive. For\nidentical oscillators, the fully synchronous state remains stable for small\nenough repulsive coupling; moreover it is an absorbing state which always wins\nover the asynchronous regime. For oscillators with a distribution of natural\nfrequencies, we report on a counter-intuitive effect of dispersion of the\noscillators frequencies at synchrony.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) plays an essential role in many exotic and\ninteresting phenomena in condensed matter physics. In neutral-atom-based\nquantum simulations, synthetic SOC constitutes a key enabling element. The\nstrength of SOC realized so far is limited by various reasons or constraints.\nThis work reports tunable SOC synthesized with a gradient magnetic field (GMF)\nfor atoms in a harmonic trap. Nearly ten-fold enhancement is observed when the\nGMF is modulated near the harmonic-trap resonance in comparison with free-space\natoms. A theory is developed that well explains the experimental results. Our\nwork offers a clear physical insight into and analytical understanding of how\nto tune the strength of atomic SOC synthesized with GMF using harmonic trap\nresonance.\n", "  The impact of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) on the magnon\ndamping in magnetic-insulator/nonmagnetic-metal bilayers was recently discussed\nin several reports. However, results of those experiments can be blurred by\nmultimode excitation within the measured linewidth. In order to avoid possible\nintermodal interference, we investigated the damping of a single magnon group\nin a platinum covered Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) film by measurement of the\nthreshold of its parametric excitation. Both dipolar and exchange spin-wave\nbranches were probed. It turned out that the LSSE-related modification of\nspin-wave damping in a micrometer-thick YIG film is too weak to be observed in\nthe entire range of experimentally accessible wavevectors. At the same time,\nthe change in the mean temperature of the YIG layer, which can appear by\napplying a temperature gradient, strongly modifies the damping value.\n", "  Transport measurements under a tilted magnetic field were performed on a\nseries of C-doped (001) AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional hole samples. Due to\na large g-factor, Zeeman energy is large and comparable to the cyclotron energy\nin these samples. On the other hand, it was found that the in-plane component\ng// is small, and the effect of tilted magnetic field is mainly to increase the\neffective mass of holes. We investigate the spin transition of composite\nfermion states around Landau level (LL) filling factor 3/2. We found that the\n{\\nu} = 4/3 state encounters a partial to full spin polarization transition,\nconforming to the same pattern as that of electron samples. In addition,\nhigh-resistance phase emerges at {\\nu} = 3/2 under very high tilt angles. We\ninterpret both of these phenomena as a consequence of LL crossings that are\nmainly driven by the orbital effects. The roles that the spin degrees of\nfreedom play in FQH states around {\\nu} = 3/2 in these systems will be\ndiscussed.\n", "  We explore constraints on multipartite dark matter (DM) framework composed of\nsinglet scalar DM interacting with the Standard Model (SM) through Higgs portal\ncoupling. We compute relic density and direct search constraints including the\nupdated LUX bound for two component scenario with non-zero interactions between\ntwo DM components in $\\mathcal{Z}_2\\times \\mathcal{Z}_2^{'}$ framework in\ncomparison with the one having $\\mathcal{O}(2)$ symmetry. We point out\navailability of a significantly large region of parameter space of such a\nmultipartite model with DM-DM interactions.\n", "  We discuss the simulation of the low-energy effective field theory (EFT) for\ngraphene in the presence of an external magnetic field. Our fully\nnonperturbative calculation uses methods of lattice gauge theory to study the\ntheory using a hybrid Monte Carlo approach. We investigate the phenomenon of\nmagnetic catalysis in the context of graphene by studying the chiral condensate\nwhich is the order parameter characterizing the spontaneous breaking of chiral\nsymmetry. In the EFT, the symmetry breaking pattern is given by $U(4) \\to U(2)\n\\times U(2)$. We also comment on the difficulty, in this lattice formalism, of\nstudying the time-reversal-odd condensate characterizing the ground state in\nthe presence of a magnetic field. Finally, we study the mass spectrum of the\ntheory, in particular the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode as well as the Dirac\nquasiparticle, which is predicted to obtain a dynamical mass.\n", "  We investigate flow pattern formation and viscosity reduction mechanisms in\nactive fluids by studying a generalized Navier-Stokes model that captures the\nexperimentally observed bulk vortex dynamics in microbial suspensions. We\npresent exact analytical solutions including stress-free vortex lattices and\nintroduce a computational framework that allows the efficient treatment of\npreviously intractable higher-order shear boundary conditions. Large-scale\nparameter scans identify the conditions for spontaneous flow symmetry breaking,\ngeometry-dependent viscosity reduction and negative-viscosity states amenable\nto energy harvesting in confined suspensions. The theory uses only generic\nassumptions about the symmetries and long-wavelength structure of active stress\ntensors, suggesting that inviscid phases may be achievable in a broad class of\nnon-equilibrium fluids by tuning confinement geometry and pattern scale\nselection.\n", "  The properties of radiation created by a classical ultrarelativistic scalar\ncharged particle in a constant homogeneous crossed electromagnetic field are\ndescribed both analytically and numerically with radiation reaction taken into\naccount in the form of the Landau-Lifshitz equation. The total radiation\nnaturally falls into two parts: the radiation formed at the entrance point of a\nparticle into the crossed field (the synchrotron entrance radiation), and the\nradiation coming from the late-time asymptotics of a particle motion (the\nde-excited radiation). The synchrotron entrance radiation resembles, although\ndoes not coincide with, the ultrarelativistic limit of the synchrotron\nradiation: its distribution over energies and angles possesses almost the same\nproperties. The de-excited radiation is soft, not concentrated in the plane of\nmotion of a charged particle, and almost completely circularly polarized. The\nphoton energy delivering the maximum to its spectral angular distribution\ndecreases with increasing the initial energy of a charged particle, while the\nmaximum value of this distribution remains the same at the fixed observation\nangle. The ultraviolet and infrared asymptotics of the total radiation are also\ndescribed.\n", "  We consider quantum metrology with arbitrary prior knowledge of the\nparameter. We demonstrate that a single sensing two-level system can act as a\nvirtual multi-level system that offers increased sensitivity in a Bayesian,\nsingle-shot, metrology scenario and that allows one to estimate (arbitrary)\nlarge parameter values by avoiding phase wraps. This is achieved by making use\nof additional degrees of freedom or auxiliary systems not participating in the\nsensing process. The joint system is manipulated by intermediate control\noperations in such a way that an effective Hamiltonian, with an arbitrary\nspectrum, is generated that mimics the spectrum of a multi-level system\ninteracting with the field. We show how to use additional internal degrees of\nfreedom of a single trapped ion to achieve a high-sensitivity magnetic field\nsensor for fields with arbitrary prior.\n", "  We simulate shock-free and shocked viscous accretion flow onto a black hole\nin a two dimensional cylindrical geometry, where initial conditions were chosen\nfrom analytical solutions. The simulation code used the Lagrangian Total\nVariation Diminishing (LTVD) and remap routine, which enabled us to attain high\naccuracy in capturing shocks and to handle the angular momentum distribution\ncorrectly. Inviscid shock-free accretion disk solution produced a thick disk\nstructure, while the viscous shock-free solution attained a Bondi-like\nstructure, but in either case, no jet activity nor any QPO-like activity\ndeveloped. The steady state shocked solution in the inviscid, as well as, in\nthe viscous regime, matched theoretical predictions well. However, increasing\nviscosity renders the accretion shock unstable. Large amplitude shock\noscillation is accompanied by intermittent, transient inner multiple shocks.\nSuch oscillation of the inner part of disk is interpreted as the source of QPO\nin hard X-rays observed in micro-quasars. Strong shock oscillation induces\nstrong episodic jet emission. The jets also showed existence of shocks, which\nare produced as one shell hits the preceding one. The periodicity of jets and\nshock oscillation were similar. The jets for higher viscosity parameter are\nevidently stronger and faster.\n", "  Feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and subsequent jet cocoons and\noutflow bubbles can have a significant impact on star formation in the host\ngalaxy. To investigate feedback physics on small scales, we perform\nhydrodynamic simulations of realistically fast AGN winds striking Bonnor-Ebert\n(BE) spheres and examine gravitational collapse and ablation. We test AGN wind\nvelocities ranging from 300--3,000 km s$^{-1}$ and wind densities ranging from\n0.5--10 $m_\\mathrm{p}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. We include heating and cooling of\nlow- and high-temperature gas, self-gravity, and spatially correlated\nperturbations in the shock, with a maximum resolution of 0.01 pc. We find that\nthe ram pressure is the most important factor that determines the fate of the\ncloud. High ram pressure winds increase fragmentation and decrease the star\nformation rate, but also cause star formation to occur on a much shorter time\nscale and with increased velocities of the newly formed stars. We find a\nthreshold ram pressure of $\\sim 2\\times10^{-8}$ dyne cm$^{-2}$ above which\nstars are not formed because the resulting clumps have internal velocities\nlarge enough to prevent collapse. Our results indicate that simultaneous\npositive and negative feedback will be possible in a single galaxy as AGN wind\nparameters will vary with location within a galaxy.\n", "  The magnetic fields of the nascent neutron stars could be submerged in the\ncrust by rapid fallback accretion and could diffuse to the surface later in\nlife. According to this field burial scenario young pulsars may have growing\nmagnetic fields, a process known to result with less-than-three braking\nindices; larger braking indices implying longer field-growth time-scales. A\nnascent neutron star with a larger kick velocity would accrete less amount of\nmatter leading to a shallower burial of its field and a more rapid field\ngrowth. Such an inverse relation between the field growth time-scale inferred\nfrom the braking indices and space velocity of pulsars was claimed in the past\nas a prediction of the field-burial scenario. With a braking index of $n\\sim 2$\nand large space velocity PSR~B0540--69 was then an outlier in the claimed\nrelation. The object recently made a transition to a rapid spin-down state\naccompanied by a low braking index. This new braking index implies a much\nshorter time-scale for the field growth which is consistent with the high space\nvelocity of the object, in better agreement with the claimed relation. This\nobservation lends support to the field burial scenario and implies that the\ngrowth of the magnetic field does not proceed at a constant pace but is slowed\nor completely halted at times. The slow spin-down state associated with the\nhigh braking index before 2011 which lasted for at least about 30 years was\nthen such an episode of slow field growth.\n", "  Cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) are close binary systems consisting of a\nwhite dwarf (primary) that is accreting matter from a low-mass companion star\n(secondary). From time to time such systems undergo large-amplitude\nbrightenings. The most spectacular eruptions, over $10^4$ times in brightness,\noccur in classical novae and are caused by a thermonuclear runaway on the\nsurface of the white dwarf. Such eruptions are thought to recur on timescales\nof $10^4-10^6$. In between, the system's properties depend primarily on the\nmass-transfer rate: if it is lower than a $10^{-9} M_{\\odot}$/year, the\naccretion becomes unstable and the matter is dumped onto the white dwarf during\nquasi-periodic dwarf nova outbursts. The hibernation hypothesis predicts that\nnova eruptions strongly affect the mass-transfer rate, keeping it high for\ncenturies after the event. Subsequently, the mass-transfer rate should\nsignificantly decrease for $10^3-10^6$ years, starting the hibernation phase.\nAfter that the nova awakes again - with accretion returning to the pre-eruption\nlevel and leading to a new nova explosion. The hibernation model predicts\ncyclical evolution of CVs through phases of high and low mass-transfer. The\ntheory gained some support from the discovery of ancient nova shells around\ndwarf novae Z Cam and AT Cnc, but direct evidence for considerable\nmass-transfer changes prior, during and after nova eruptions has not hitherto\nbeen found. Here we report long-term observations of the classical nova V1213\nCen (Nova Cen 2009) covering its pre- and post-eruption phases. Within the six\nyears before the explosion, the system revealed dwarf nova outbursts indicative\nof a low mass-transfer rate. The post-nova is two orders of magnitude brighter\nthan the pre-nova at minimum light with no trace of dwarf nova behavior,\nimplying that the mass-transfer rate increased considerably as a result of the\nnova explosion.\n", "  The response of lipid bilayers to osmotic stress is an important part of\ncellular function. Previously, in [Oglecka et al. 2014], we reported that\ncell-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exposed to hypotonic media,\nrespond to the osmotic assault by undergoing a cyclical sequence of swelling\nand bursting events, coupled to the membrane's compositional degrees of\nfreedom. Here, we seek to deepen our quantitative understanding of the\nessential pulsatile behavior of GUVs under hypotonic conditions, by advancing a\ncomprehensive theoretical model for vesicle dynamics. The model quantitatively\ncaptures our experimentally measured swell-burst parameters for\nsingle-component GUVs, and reveals that thermal fluctuations enable rate\ndependent pore nucleation, driving the dynamics of the swell-burst cycles. We\nfurther identify new scaling relationships between the pulsatile dynamics and\nGUV properties. Our findings provide a fundamental framework that has the\npotential to guide future investigations on the non-equilibrium dynamics of\nvesicles under osmotic stress.\n", "  We suggest a class of two-dimensional lattice spin Hamiltonians describing\nnon-Abelian SU(2) chiral spin liquids - spin-analogues of fractional\nnon-Abelian quantum Hall states- with gapped bulk and gapless chiral edge\nexcitations described by the SU(2)$_n$ Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten conformal\nfield theory. The models are constructed from an array of a generalized\nspin-$n/2$ ladders with multi-spin exchange interaction which are coupled by\nisolated spins. Such models allow a controllable analytic treatment starting\nfrom the one-dimensional limit and are characterized by a bulk gap and\nnon-Abelian SU(2)$_n$ gapless edge excitations.\n", "  The total energy of the ground state of the quantum harmonic oscillator is\nobtained with minimal assumptions. The vacuum energy density of the universe is\nderived and a cutoff frequency is obtained for the upper bound of the quantum\nharmonic oscillator.\n", "  We herein present a first-principles formulation of the Green-Kubo method\nthat allows the accurate assessment of the non-radiative thermal conductivity\nof solid semiconductors and insulators in equilibrium ab initio molecular\ndynamics calculations. Using the virial for the nuclei, we propose a unique ab\ninitio definition of the heat flux. Accurate size- and time convergence are\nachieved within moderate computational effort by a robust, asymptotically exact\nextrapolation scheme. We demonstrate the capabilities of the technique by\ninvestigating the thermal conductivity of extreme high and low heat conducting\nmaterials, namely diamond Si and tetragonal ZrO$_2$.\n", "  We show that the Pauli exclusion principle in a system of $M0$-branes can\ngive rise to the expansion and contraction of the universe which is located on\nan $M3$-brane. We start with a system of $M0$-branes with high symmetry, which\njoin mutually and form pairs of $M1$-anti-$M1$-branes. The resulting symmetry\nbreaking creates gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes and play the role of\ngraviton tensor modes, which induce an attractive force between the $M1$ and\nanti-$M1$ branes. Consequently, the gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes,\nand the scalar fields which are attached symmetrically to all parts of these\nbranes, decay to fermions that attach anti-symmetrically to the upper and lower\nparts of the branes, and hence the Pauli exclusion principle emerges. By\nclosing $M1$-branes mutually, the curvatures produced by parallel spins will be\ndifferent from the curvatures produced by anti-parallel spins, and this leads\nto an inequality between the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary\nsurface and the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk region. This behavior\nis inherited in the $M3$-brane on which the universe is located, and hence this\nleads to the emergence of the universe expansion and contraction. In this\nsense, the Pauli exclusion principle rules the cosmic dynamics.\n", "  The Hartle-Hawking state is a proposal for a preferred initial state for\nquantum gravity, based on a path integral over all compact Euclidean\nfour-geometries which have a given three-geometry as a boundary. The wave\nfunction constructed this way satisfies the (Lorentzian) Hamiltonian constraint\nof general relativity in ADM variables in a formal sense. In this article we\nmimic this procedure of constructing an initial state in terms of\nAshtekar-Barbero variables, and observe that the wave function thus constructed\ndoes not satisfy the Lorentzian Hamiltonian constraint even in a formal sense.\nWe also investigate this issue for the relativistic particle. We finally\nsuggest a modification of the proposal that does satisfy the constraint at\nleast in a formal sense and start to consider its implications in quantum\ncosmology. We find that for certain variables, and in the saddle point\napproximation, the state is very similar to the Ashtekar-Lewandowski state of\nloop quantum gravity.\n", "  The analysis of some braking mechanisms for neutron stars was carried out to\ndetermine the sign of the second derivative of the pulsar period. This quantity\nis the important parameter for calculations of the braking index n. It is shown\nthat this derivative can be positive and lead to decreasing of n. It is\nnecessary to correct the methods of calculations of n used this moment because\nthey are based as a rule on the suggestion on the constancy of pulsar\nparameters (magnetic fields, angles between some axes and so on). The\nestimations of corrections to braking indices are obtained. It is shown that\nthese corrections can be marked for pulsars with long periods and their small\nderivatives.\n", "  There is increasingly more evidence being accumulated for the occurrence of\nlarge amounts of organic material in the cosmos, particularly in the form of\naromatic compounds. These molecules can be found on the surface of Earth and\nMars, in the atmospheres of the larger planets and on many of their satellites,\non asteroids, comets, meteorites, the atmospheres of red giant stars,\ninterstellar nebulae, and in the spiral arms of galaxies. Many of these\nenvironments are expected to be of low temperature and pressure, implying that\nthe Gibbs free energy for the formation of these complex molecules should be\npositive and large, suggesting that their existence could only be attributed to\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamic processes. In this article we first review the\nevidence for the abundance of these molecules in the cosmos and then describe\nhow the ubiquity can be explained from within the framework of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics on the basis of the catalytic properties of these pigment\nmolecules in dissipating photons of the ultraviolet and visible emission\nspectra of neighboring stars, leading to greater local entropy production. A\nrelation between the maximum wavelength of absorption of these organic pigments\nand the corresponding stellar photon environment, provides a guide to\ndetermining which aromatic compounds are most probable in a given stellar\nneighborhood, a postulate that can be verified on Earth. It is suggested that\nat least some of the baryonic dark matter may be associated with these\nmolecules which emit in the extreme infrared with many, but weak, emission\nlines, thus so far escaping detection. This thermodynamic explanation for the\nubiquity of these organic molecules also has relevance to the possibility of\nlife, both as we know it, and as we may not know it, throughout the universe.\n", "  Modelling of gravitational waves from binary black hole inspiral has played\nan important role in the recent observations of such signals. The late-stage\nringdown phase of the gravitational waveform is often associated with the null\nparticle orbit (\"light ring\") of the black hole spacetime. With simple models\nwe show that this link between the light ring and spacetime ringing is based\nmore on the history of specific models than on an actual constraining\nrelationship. We also show, in particular, that a better understanding of the\ndissociation of the two may be relevant to the astrophysically interesting case\nof rotating (Kerr) black holes.\n", "  The alkali-doped fullerides A$_3$C$_{60}$ are half-filled three-orbital\nHubbard systems which exhibit an unconventional superconducting phase next to a\nMott insulator. While the pairing is understood to arise from an effectively\nnegative Hund coupling, the highly unusual Jahn-Teller metal near the Mott\ntransition, featuring both localized and itinerant electrons, has not been\nunderstood. This property is consistently explained by a previously\nunrecognized phenomenon: the spontaneous transition of multiorbital systems\nwith negative Hund coupling into an orbital-selective Mott state. This\nsymmetry-broken state, which has no ordinary orbital moment, is characterized\nby an orbital-dependent two-body operator (the double occupancy) or an\norbital-dependent kinetic energy, and may be regarded as a diagonal-order\nversion of odd-frequency superconductivity. We propose that the recently\ndiscovered Jahn-Teller metal phase of Rb$_x$Cs$_{3-x}$C$_{60}$ is an\nexperimental realization of this novel state of matter.\n", "  The challenge of one-dimensional systems is to understand their physics\nbeyond the level of known elementary excitations. By high-resolution neutron\nspectroscopy in a quantum spin ladder material, we probe the leading\nmultiparticle excitation by characterizing the two-magnon bound state at zero\nfield. By applying high magnetic fields, we create and select the singlet\n(longitudinal) and triplet (transverse) excitations of the fully spin-polarized\nladder, which have not been observed previously and are close analogs of the\nmodes anticipated in a polarized Haldane chain. Theoretical modelling of the\ndynamical response demonstrates our complete quantitative understanding of\nthese states.\n", "  The morphology of an elastic strip subject to vertical compressive stress on\na frictional rigid substrate is investigated by a combination of theory and\nexperiment. We find a rich variety of morphologies, which -when the bending\nelasticity dominates over the effect of gravity- are classified into three\ndistinct types of states: pinned, partially slipped, and completely slipped,\ndepending on the magnitude of the vertical strain and coefficient of static\nfriction. We develop a theory of elastica under mixed clamped-hinged boundary\nconditions combined with the Coulomb-Amontons friction law, and find excellent\nquantitative agreement with simulations and controlled physical experiments. We\nalso discuss the effect of gravity in order to bridge the difference in\nqualitative behaviors of stiff strips and flexible strings, or ropes. Our study\nthus complements recent work on elastic rope coiling, and takes a significant\nstep towards establishing a unified understanding of how a thin elastic object\ninteracts vertically with a solid surface.\n", "  We propose a novel method to reconstruct event by event the full kinematics\nof the cascade decay process, $h \\to \\tau^+\\tau^- \\to (\\pi^+ \\bar{\\nu}) (\\pi^-\n\\nu)$, which allows us to measure the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ spin correlation, a\nmeasure of the CP property of the Higgs boson. By noting that the $\\tau^{\\pm}$\nmomenta lie on the plane spanned by the accurately measured impact parameter\nand momentum vectors of charged pions, we can obtain the most likely momenta of\nthe two missing neutrinos by using the probability distribution functions of\nthe $\\met$ vector and the location of the primary vertex. A simple detector\nlevel simulation shows an excellent agreement between the reconstructed and the\ntrue kinematics, both in the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ rest frames.\nThe method can be tested in $Z \\to \\tau^+\\tau^-$ events, which should exhibit\nno correlation.\n", "  Recent experiments on non-interacting ultra-cold atoms in correlated disorder\nhave yielded conflicting results regarding the so-called mobility edge, i.e.\nthe energy threshold separating Anderson localized from diffusive states. At\nthe same time, there are theoretical indications that the experimental data\noverestimate the position of this critical energy, sometimes by a large amount.\nThe non-trivial effect of anisotropy in the spatial correlations of\nexperimental speckle potentials have been put forward as a possible cause for\nsuch discrepancy. Using extensive numerical simulations we show that the effect\nof anisotropy alone is not sufficient to explain the experimental data. In\nparticular, we find that, for not-too-strong anisotropy, realistic disorder\nconfigurations are essentially identical to the isotropic case, modulo a simple\nrescaling of the energies.\n", "  We present first results from a series of $NuSTAR$ observations of the black\nhole X-ray binary V404 Cyg obtained during its summer 2015 outburst, primarily\nfocusing on observations during the height of this outburst activity. The\n$NuSTAR$ data show extreme variability in both the flux and spectral properties\nof the source. This is partly driven by strong and variable line-of-sight\nabsorption, similar to previous outbursts. The latter stages of this\nobservation are dominated by strong flares, reaching luminosities close to\nEddington. During these flares, the central source appears to be relatively\nunobscured and the data show clear evidence for a strong contribution from\nrelativistic reflection, providing a means to probe the geometry of the\ninnermost accretion flow. Based on the flare properties, analogy with other\nGalactic black hole binaries, and also the simultaneous onset of radio\nactivity, we argue that this intense X-ray flaring is related to transient jet\nactivity during which the ejected plasma is the primary source of illumination\nfor the accretion disk. If this is the case, then our reflection modelling\nimplies that these jets are launched in close proximity to the black hole (as\nclose as a few gravitational radii), consistent with expectations for jet\nlaunching models that tap either the spin of the central black hole, or the\nvery innermost accretion disk. Our analysis also allows us to place the first\nconstraints on the black hole spin for this source, which we find to be $a^* >\n0.92$ (99% statistical uncertainty, based on an idealized lamppost geometry).\n", "  Data dimensionality reduction in radio interferometry can provide savings of\ncomputational resources for image reconstruction through reduced memory\nfootprints and lighter computations per iteration, which is important for the\nscalability of imaging methods to the big data setting of the next-generation\ntelescopes. This article sheds new light on dimensionality reduction from the\nperspective of compressed sensing theory and studies its interplay with imaging\nalgorithms designed in the context of convex optimization. We propose a\npost-gridding linear data embedding to the space spanned by the left singular\nvectors of the measurement operator, providing a dimensionality reduction below\nimage size. This embedding preserves the null space of the measurement operator\nand hence also its sampling properties as per compressed sensing theory. We\nshow that this can be approximated by first computing the dirty image and then\napplying a weighted subsampled discrete Fourier transform to obtain the final\nreduced data vector. This Fourier dimensionality reduction model ensures a fast\nimplementation of the full measurement operator, essential for any iterative\nimage reconstruction method. The proposed reduction also preserves the i.i.d.\nGaussian properties of the original measurement noise. For convex\noptimization-based imaging algorithms, this is key to justify the use of the\nstandard L2-norm as the data fidelity term. Our simulations confirm that this\ndimensionality reduction approach can be leveraged by convex optimization\nalgorithms with no loss in imaging quality relative to reconstructing the image\nfrom the complete visibility data set. Reconstruction results in simulation\nsettings with no direction dependent effects or calibration errors show\npromising performance of the proposed dimensionality reduction. MATLAB code\nimplementing the proposed reduction method is available on GitHub.\n", "  We perform magnetically-assisted Sisyphus laser cooling of the triatomic free\nradical strontium monohydroxide (SrOH). This is achieved with principal optical\ncycling in the rotationally closed $P\\left(N\"=1\\right)$ branch of either the\n$\\tilde{X}^{2}\\Sigma^{+}\\left(000\\right)\\leftrightarrow\\tilde{A}^{2}\\Pi_{1/2}\\left(000\\right)$\nor the\n$\\tilde{X}^{2}\\Sigma^{+}\\left(000\\right)\\leftrightarrow\\tilde{B}^{2}\\Sigma^{+}\\left(000\\right)$\nvibronic transitions. Molecules lost into the excited vibrational states during\nthe cooling process are repumped back through the $\\tilde{B}\\left(000\\right)$\nstate for both the $\\left(100\\right)$ level of the Sr-O stretching mode and the\n$\\left(02^{0}0\\right)$ level of the bending mode. The transverse temperature of\na SrOH molecular beam is reduced in one dimension by two orders of magnitude to\n$\\sim700\\ {\\rm \\mu K}$. This approach opens a path towards creating a variety\nof ultracold polyatomic molecules, including much larger ones, by means of\ndirect laser cooling.\n", "  In this article, we investigate the role of the self-interaction error in the\nsimulation of collisions using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)\nand Ehrenfest dynamics. We compare many different approximations of the\nexchange and correlation potential, using as a test system the collision of\n$\\mathrm{H^+ + CH_4}$ at $30~\\mathrm{eV}$. We find that semi-local\napproximations, like PBE, and even hybrid functionals, like B3LYP, produce\nqualitatively incorrect predictions for the scattering of the proton. This\ndiscrepancy appears because the self-interaction error allows the electrons to\njump too easily to the proton, leading to radically different forces with\nrespect to the non-self-interacting case. From our results, we conclude that\nusing a functional that is self-interaction free is essential to properly\ndescribe charge-transfer collisions between ions and molecules in TDDFT.\n", "  Cosmological simulations suggest a strong correlation between high\noptical-depth Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers, which arise from the intergalactic medium\n(IGM), and 3-D mass overdensities on scales of $10-30$ $h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc.\nBy examining the absorption spectra of $\\sim$ 80,000 QSO sight-lines over a\nvolume of 0.1 Gpc$^3$ in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), we have\nidentified an extreme overdensity, BOSS1441, which contains a rare group of\nstrong Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers at $z=2.32\\pm 0.02$. This absorber group is\nassociated with six QSOs at the same redshift on a 30 comoving Mpc scale. Using\nMayall/MOSAIC narrowband and broadband imaging, we detect Ly$\\alpha$ emitters\n(LAEs) down to $0.7\\times L_{\\rm{Ly\\alpha}}^*$, and reveal a large-scale\nstructure of Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in this field. Our follow-up Large\nBinocular Telescope (LBT) observations have spectroscopically confirmed 19\ngalaxies in the density peak. We show that BOSS1441 has an LAE overdensity of\n$10.8\\pm 2.6$ on a 15 comoving Mpc scale which could collapse to a massive\ncluster with $M\\gtrsim10^{15}$ M$_\\odot$ at $z\\sim0$. This overdensity is among\nthe most massive large-scale structures at $z\\sim2$ discovered to date.\n", "  We propose a semi-classical description of the low-energy properties of\nquantum spin ice in the strong Ising limit. Within the framework of a\nsemiclassical, perturbative Villain expansion, that can be truncated at\narbitrary order, we give an analytic and quantitative treatment of the\ndeconfining phase. We find that photon-photon interactions significantly\nrenormalise the speed of light and split the two transverse photon\npolarisations at intermediate wavevectors. We calculate the photon velocity and\nthe ground state energy to first and second order in perturbation theory,\nrespectively. The former is in good agreement with recent numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  Improvements in the accuracy of shape measurements are essential to exploit\nthe statistical power of planned imaging surveys that aim to constrain\ncosmological parameters using weak lensing by large-scale structure. Although a\nrange of tests can be performed using the measurements, the performance of the\nalgorithm can only be quantified using simulated images. This yields, however,\nonly meaningful results if the simulated images resemble the real observations\nsufficiently well. In this paper we explore the sensitivity of the\nmultiplicative bias to the input parameters of Euclid-like image simulations.We\nfind that algorithms will need to account for the local density of sources. In\nparticular the impact of galaxies below the detection limit warrants further\nstudy, because magnification changes their number density, resulting in\ncorrelations between the lensing signal and multiplicative bias. Although\nachieving sub-percent accuracy will require further study, we estimate that\nsufficient archival Hubble Space Telescope data are available to create\nrealistic populations of galaxies.\n", "  We consider two quenched, chiral ensembles which are coupled in such a way\nthat a combined chiral symmetry is preserved. The coupling also links the\ntopology of the two systems such that the number of exact zero modes in the\ncoupled system equals the sum of the number of zero modes in the two uncoupled\nsystems counted with sign. The canceled modes that turn non-topological due to\nthe coupling become near-zero modes at small coupling. We analyze the\ndistribution of these would-be zero modes using effective field theory. The\ndistribution is universal and, in the limit of small coupling, the would-be\nzero modes are distributed according to a finite size chiral Gaussian ensemble,\nwhere the width of the distribution scales as the inverse square root of the\nvolume.\n", "  We investigate the scaling behavior of longitudinal and transverse structure\nfunctions in homogeneous and isotropic magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence by\nmeans of an exact hierarchy of structure function equations as well as by\ndirect numerical simulations of two- and three-dimensional MHD turbulence. In\nparticular, rescaling relations between longitudinal and transverse structure\nfunctions are derived and utilized in order to compare different scaling\nbehavior in the inertial range. It is found that there are no substantial\ndifferences between longitudinal and transverse structure functions in MHD\nturbulence. This finding stands in contrast to the case of hydrodynamic\nturbulence which shows persistent differences even at high Reynolds numbers. We\npropose a physical picture that is based on an effective reduction of pressure\ncontributions due to local regions of same magnitude and alignment of velocity\nand magnetic field fluctuations. Finally, our findings underline the importance\nof the pressure term for the actually observed scaling differences in\nhydrodynamic turbulence.\n", "  A detailed comparison is made between different viewpoints on reversible\nheating in electric double layer capacitors. We show in the limit of slow\ncharging that a combined Poisson-Nernst-Planck and heat equation, first studied\nby d'Entremont and Pilon [J. Power Sources {\\bf 246}, 887 (2014)], recovers the\ntemperature changes as predicted by the thermodynamic identity of Janssen,\nH\\\"{a}rtel, and van Roij [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 113}, 268501 (2014)], and\ndisagrees with the approximative model of Schiffer, Linzen, and Sauer [J. Power\nSources {\\bf 160}, 765 (2006)] that predominates the literature.\n", "  We propose that stellar-mass binary black holes like GW150914 will become a\ntool to explore the local Universe within ~100Mpc in the era of the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA). High calibration accuracy and annual\nmotion of LISA could enable us to localize up to ~60 binaries more accurately\nthan the error volume of ~100Mpc^3 without electromagnetic counterparts under\nmoderately optimistic assumptions. This accuracy will give us a fair chance to\ndetermine the host object solely by gravitational waves. By combining the\nluminosity distance extracted from gravitational waves with the cosmological\nredshift determined from the host, the local value of the Hubble parameter will\nbe determined up to a few % without relying on the empirically constructed\ndistance ladder. Gravitational-wave cosmography would pave the way for\nresolution of the disputed Hubble tension, where the local and global\nmeasurements disagree in the value of the Hubble parameter at 3.4sigma level,\nwhich amounts to ~9%.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of magnetoconductivity for general\nthree-dimensional non-magnetic metals within the Berry-curvature-corrected\nsemiclassical and Boltzmann framework. We find a new contribution, which is\nintrinsic in the sense that its ratio to the zero-magnetic-field conductivity\nis fully determined by the intrinsic band properties, independent of the\ntransport relaxation time, showing a clear violation of Kohler's rule.\nRemarkably, this contribution can generally be positive for the longitudinal\nconfiguration, providing a new mechanism for the appearance of positive\nmagnetoconductivity under longitudinal configuration besides the chiral anomaly\neffect.\n", "  We study how close-in systems such as those detected by Kepler are affected\nby the dynamics of bodies in the outer system. We consider two scenarios: outer\nsystems of giant planets potentially unstable to planet--planet scattering, and\nwide binaries that may be capable of driving Kozai or other secular variations\nof outer planets' eccentricities. Dynamical excitation of planets in the outer\nsystem reduces the multiplicity of Kepler-detectable planets in the inner\nsystem in $\\sim20-25\\%$ of our systems. Accounting for the occurrence rates of\nwide-orbit planets and binary stars, $\\approx18\\%$ of close-in systems could be\ndestabilised by their outer companions in this way. This provides some\ncontribution to the apparent excess of systems with a single transiting planet\ncompared to multiple, however, it only contributes at most $25\\%$ of the\nexcess. The effects of the outer dynamics can generate systems similar to\nKepler-56 (two coplanar planets significantly misaligned with the host star)\nand Kepler-108 (two significantly non-coplanar planets in a binary). We also\nidentify three pathways to the formation of eccentric warm Jupiters resulting\nfrom the interaction between outer and inner systems: direct inelastic\ncollision between an eccentric outer and an inner planet, secular eccentricity\noscillations that may \"freeze out\" when scattering resolves in the outer\nsystem; and scattering in the inner system followed by \"uplift\", where inner\nplanets are removed by interaction with the outer planets. In these scenarios,\nthe formation of eccentric warm Jupiters is a signature of a past history of\nviolent dynamics among massive planets beyond $\\sim1$ au.\n", "  Multi-Weyl semimetals are new types of Weyl semimetals which have anisotropic\nnon-linear energy dispersion and a topological charge larger than one, thus\nexhibiting a unique quantum response. Using a unified lattice model, we\ncalculate the optical conductivity numerically in the multi-Weyl semimetal\nphase and in its neighboring gapped states, and obtain the characteristic\nfrequency dependence of each phase analytically using a low-energy continuum\nmodel. The frequency dependence of longitudinal and transverse optical\nconductivities obeys scaling relations that are derived from the winding number\nof the parent multi-Weyl semimetal phase and can be used to distinguish these\nelectronic states of matter.\n", "  We show how to evaluate one-dimensional Minkowski-region Mellin-Barnes\nrepresentations arising from massive loop integrals, by modifying the contours\nof integration. We implement an exact solution to the differential equation\ndetermining the contours of stationary phase. We also present several simple\napproximations to these contours. Our approach points the way to more efficient\ncomputations of massless and massive Mellin-Barnes integrals in both Euclidean\nand Minkowski regions.\n", "  On-chip spectroscopy that could realize real-time fingerprinting with\nlabel-free and high-throughput detection of trace molecules is one of the 'holy\ngrails\" of sensing. Such miniaturized spectrometers would greatly enable\napplications in chemistry, bio-medicine, material science or space\ninstrumentation, such as hyperspectral microscopy of live cells or\npharmaceutical quality control. Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS), a recent\ntechnique of Fourier transform spectroscopy without moving parts, is\nparticularly promising since it measures high-precision spectra in the gas\nphase using only a single detector. Here, we present a microresonator-based\nplatform designed for mid-infrared (mid-IR) DCS. A single continuous-wave (CW)\nlow-power pump source generates two mutually coherent mode-locked frequency\ncombs spanning from 2.6 $\\mu$m to 4.1 $\\mu$m in two silicon micro-resonators.\nThermal control and free-carrier injection control modelocking of each comb and\ntune the dual-comb parameters. The large line spacing of the combs (127 GHz)\nand its precise tuning over tens of MHz, unique features of chip-scale comb\ngenerators, are exploited for a proof-of-principle experiment of vibrational\nabsorption DCS in the liquid phase, with spectra of acetone spanning from 2870\nnm to 3170 nm at 127-GHz (4.2-cm$^{-1}$) resolution. We take a significant step\ntowards a broadband, mid-IR spectroscopy instrument on a chip. With further\nsystem development, our concept holds promise for real-time and time-resolved\nspectral acquisition on the nanosecond time scale.\n", "  The de Haas-van Alphen effect (dHvAe) describes the periodic oscillation of\nthe magnetisation in a material as a function of inverse applied magnetic\nfield. It forms the basis of a well established procedure for measuring Fermi\nsurface properties and its observation is typically taken as a direct signature\nof a system being metallic. However, certain insulators can show similar\noscillations of the magnetisation from quantisation of the energies of electron\nstates in filled bands. Recently the theory of such an ${\\it anomalous}$ dHvAe\n(AdHvAe) has been worked out but so far there is no clear experimental\nobservation. Here, we show that the inverted narrow gap regime of InAs/GaSb\nquantum wells is an ideal platform for the observation of the AdHvAe. From our\nmicroscopic calculations we make quantitative predictions for the relevant\nmagnetic field and temperature regimes, and describe unambiguous experimental\nsignatures.\n", "  The gravitino problem is revisited in the framework of cosmological models in\nwhich the primordial cosmic matter is described by a relativistic imperfect\nfluid. Dissipative effects (or bulk viscosity effects) arise owing to the\ndifferent cooling rates of the fluid components. We show that the effects of\nthe bulk viscosity allow to avoid the late abundance of gravitinos. In\nparticular, we found that for a particular choice of the parameters\ncharacterizing the cosmological model, the gravitino abundance turns out to be\nindependent on the reheating temperature.\n", "  We study the exotic $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ four-quark states in Laplace sum rules\n(LSR) and finite energy sum rules (FESR). We use the vector tetraquark-like\ncurrents as interpolating currents in the correlator, from which the $1^{+-}$\nstates are also studied. In the mass extraction, we use the standard stability\ncriterion with respect to the Borel parameters and the QCD continuum thresholds\nand consider the effect of the violation of factorization in estimating the\nhigh dimensional condensates as a source of uncertainties. The obtained mass\nprediction $1.66\\pm0.14$ GeV is much lower than the previous sum rule\npredictions obtained using the scalar currents. Our result favours the\nfour-quark interpretation of the possible $\\rho\\pi$ dominance in the $D^0$\ndecay. We also discuss the possible decay patterns of these exotic four-quark\nstates.\n", "  Using the production reactions $pd\\to {}^3\\mbox{He}\\,\\omega$ and $pp\\to\npp\\omega$, the Dalitz plot distribution for the $\\omega \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0$\ndecay is studied with the WASA detector at COSY, based on a combined data\nsample of $ (4.408\\pm 0.042) \\times 10^4$ events. The Dalitz plot density is\nparametrised by a product of the $P$-wave phase space and a polynomial\nexpansion in the normalised polar Dalitz plot variables $Z$ and $\\phi$. For the\nfirst time, a deviation from pure $P$-wave phase space is observed with a\nsignificance of $4.1\\sigma$. The deviation is parametrised by a linear term\n$1+2\\alpha Z$, with $\\alpha$ determined to be $+0.147\\pm0.036$, consistent with\nthe expectations of $\\rho$-meson-type final-state interactions of the $P$-wave\npion pairs.\n", "  We present a supersymmetric (SUSY) model based on trinification\n$[\\mathrm{SU}(3)]^3$ and family $\\mathrm{SU}(3)_\\mathrm{F}$ symmetries embedded\ninto a maximal subgroup of $\\mathrm{E}_8$, where the sectors of light Higgs\nbosons and leptons are unified into a single chiral supermultiplet. The common\norigin of gauge trinification and of the family symmetry from $\\mathrm{E}_8$\nseparates the model from other trinification-based GUTs, as it protects, in\nparticular, the Standard Model fermions from gaining mass until the electroweak\nsymmetry is broken. Furthermore, it allows us to break the trinification\nsymmetry via vacuum expectation values in $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$-adjoint scalars down\nto a left-right symmetric theory. Simultaneously, it ensures the unification of\nthe gauge and Yukawa couplings as well as proton stability. Although the\nlow-energy regime (e.g. mass hierarchies in the scalar sector determined by a\nsoft SUSY-breaking mechanism) is yet to be established, these features are one\nkey to revive the once very popular trinification-based GUTs.\n", "  [Background] Various cluster states of astrophysical interest are expected to\nexist in the excited states of $^{28}{\\rm Si}$. However, they have not been\nidentified firmly, because of the experimental and theoretical difficulties.\n[Purpose] To establish the $^{24}$Mg+$\\alpha$, $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C and\n$^{20}$Ne+2$\\alpha$ cluster bands, we theoretically search for the\nnegative-parity cluster bands that are paired with the positive-parity bands to\nconstitute the inversion doublets. We also offer the isoscalar monopole and\ndipole transitions as a promising probe for the clustering. We numerically show\nthat these transition strengths from the ground state to the cluster states are\nvery enhanced. [Method] The antisymmetrized molecular dynamics with Gogny D1S\neffective interaction is employed to calculate the excited states of $^{28}{\\rm\nSi}$. The isoscalar monopole and dipole transition strengths are directly\nevaluated from wave functions of the ground and excited states. [Results]\nNegative-parity bands having $^{24}$Mg+$\\alpha$ and $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C cluster\nconfigurations are obtained in addition to the newly calculated\n$^{20}$Ne+2$\\alpha$ cluster bands. All of them are paired with the\ncorresponding positive-parity bands to constitute the inversion doublets with\nvarious cluster configurations. The calculation show that the band-head of the\n$^{24}$Mg+$\\alpha$ and $^{20}$Ne+2$\\alpha$ cluster bands are strongly excited\nby the isoscalar monopole and dipole transitions. [Conclusions] The present\ncalculation suggests the existence of the inversion doublets with the\n$^{24}$Mg+$\\alpha$, $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C and $^{20}$Ne+2$\\alpha$\nconfigurations.Because of the enhanced transition strengths, we offer the\nisoscalar monopole and dipole transitions as good probe for the\n$^{24}$Mg+$\\alpha$ and $^{20}$Ne+2$\\alpha$ cluster bands.\n", "  We investigate black holes formed by static perfect fluid with $p=-\\rho/3$.\nThese represent the black holes in $S_3$ and $H_3$ spatial geometries. There\nare three classes of black-hole solutions, two $S_3$ types and one $H_3$ type.\nThe interesting solution is the one of $S_3$ type which possesses two\nsingularities. The one is at the north pole behind the horizon, and the other\nis naked at the south pole. The observers, however, are free from falling to\nthe naked singularity. There are also nonstatic cosmological solutions in $S_3$\nand $H_3$, and a singular static solution in $H_3$.\n", "  We present the first results on the third order corrections to on-shell form\nfactor (FF) of the Konishi operator in ${\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory using Feynman diagrammatic approach in modified dimensional reduction\n($\\overline {DR}$) scheme. We show that it satisfies KG equation in $\\overline\n{DR}$ scheme while the result obtained in four dimensional helicity (FDH)\nscheme needs to be suitably modified not only to satisfy the KG equation but\nalso to get the correct ultraviolet (UV) anomalous dimensions. We find that the\ncusp, soft and collinear anomalous dimensions obtained to third order are same\nas those of the FF of the half-BPS operator confirming the universality of the\ninfrared (IR) structures of on-shell form factors. In addition, the highest\ntranscendental terms of the FF of Konishi operator are identical to those of\nhalf-BPS operator indicating the probable existence of deeper structure of the\non-shell FF. We also confirm the UV anomalous dimensions of Konishi operator up\nto third order providing a consistency check on the both UV and universal IR\nstructures in ${\\cal N}=4$.\n", "  In which-way double-slit experiments with perfect detectors, it is assumed\nthat having a second detector at the slits is redundant, as it will not change\nthe interference pattern. We however show that if higher-order or non-classical\npaths are accounted for, the presence of the second detector will have an\neffect on the interference pattern. Accounting for these non-classical paths\nalso means that the Sorkin parameter in triple-slit experiments is only an\napproximate measure of Born rule violation. Using the difference between single\nand double which-way detectors, we give an alternative parameter which is an\nexact measure of Born rule violation.\n", "  We consider classically scale-invariant theories with non-minimally coupled\nscalar fields, where the Planck mass and the hierarchy of physical scales are\ndynamically generated. The classical theories possess a fixed point, where\nscale invariance is spontaneously broken. In these theories, however, the\nPlanck mass becomes unstable in the presence of explicit sources of scale\ninvariance breaking, such as non-relativistic matter and cosmological constant\nterms. We quantify the constraints on such classical models from Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis that lead to an upper bound on the non-minimal coupling and\nrequire trans-Planckian field values. We show that quantum corrections to the\nscalar potential can stabilise the fixed point close to the minimum of the\nColeman-Weinberg potential. The time-averaged motion of the evolving fixed\npoint is strongly suppressed, thus the limits on the evolving gravitational\nconstant from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and other measurements do not presently\nconstrain this class of theories. Field oscillations around the fixed point, if\nnot damped, contribute to the dark matter density of the Universe.\n", "  We present results from four new broadband X-ray observations of the extreme\nultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg IX X-1 ($L_{\\rm{X}} > 10^{40}$ erg/s),\nperformed by $Suzaku$ and $NuSTAR$ in coordination. Combined with the archival\ndata, we now have broadband observations of this remarkable source from six\nseparate epochs. Two of these new observations probe lower fluxes than seen\npreviously, allowing us to extend our knowledge of the broadband spectral\nvariability exhibited. The spectra are well fit by two thermal blackbody\ncomponents, which dominate the emission below 10 keV, as well as a steep\n($\\Gamma \\sim 3.5$) powerlaw tail which dominates above $\\sim$15 keV.\nRemarkably, while the 0.3-10.0 keV flux varies by a factor of $\\sim$3 between\nall these epochs, the 15-40 keV flux varies by only $\\sim$20%. Although the\nspectral variability is strongest in the $\\sim$1-10 keV band, both of the\nthermal components are required to vary when all epochs are considered. We also\nre-visit the search for iron absorption features, leveraging the high-energy\n$NuSTAR$ data to improve our sensitivity to extreme velocity outflows in light\nof the ultra-fast outflow recently detected in NGC 1313 X-1. Iron absorption\nfrom a similar outflow along our line of sight can be ruled out in this case.\nWe discuss these results in the context of super-Eddington accretion models\nthat invoke a funnel-like geometry for the inner flow, and propose a scenario\nin which we have an almost face-on view of a funnel that expands to larger\nradii with increasing flux, resulting in an increasing degree of geometrical\ncollimation for the emission from intermediate temperature regions.\n", "  We report the first measurement of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry\n$A_{LL}$ for mid-rapidity di-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV. The di-jet cross section was\nmeasured and is shown to be consistent with next-to-leading order (NLO)\nperturbative QCD predictions. $A_{LL}$ results are presented for two distinct\ntopologies, defined by the jet pseudorapidities, and are compared to\npredictions from several recent NLO global analyses. The measured asymmetries,\nthe first such correlation measurements, support those analyses that find\npositive gluon polarization at the level of roughly 0.2 over the region of\nBjorken-$x > 0.05$.\n", "  The one-clean qubit model (or the DQC1 model) is a restricted model of\nquantum computing where only a single qubit of the initial state is pure and\nothers are maximally mixed. Although the model is not universal, it can\nefficiently solve several problems whose classical efficient solutions are not\nknown. Furthermore, it was recently shown that if the one-clean qubit model is\nclassically efficiently simulated, the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the\nsecond level. A disadvantage of the one-clean qubit model is, however, that the\nclean qubit is too clean: for example, in realistic NMR experiments,\npolarizations are not enough high to have the perfectly pure qubit. In this\npaper, we consider a more realistic one-clean qubit model, where the clean\nqubit is not clean, but depolarized. We first show that, for any polarization,\na multiplicative-error calculation of the output probability distribution of\nthe model is possible in a classical polynomial time if we take an\nappropriately large multiplicative error. The result is in a strong contrast to\nthat of the ideal one-clean qubit model where the classical efficient\nmultiplicative-error calculation (or even the sampling) with the same amount of\nerror causes the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. We next show that, for\nany polarization lower-bounded by an inverse polynomial, a classical efficient\nsampling (in terms of a sufficiently small multiplicative error or an\nexponentially-small additive error) of the output probability distribution of\nthe model is impossible unless BQP is contained in the second level of the\npolynomial hierarchy, which suggests the hardness of the classical efficient\nsimulation of the one non-clean qubit model.\n", "  Non-collinear chiral antiferromagnets like Mn3Sn and Mn3Ge are known to show\ngigantic anomalous Hall response depending on the orientation of their inverse\nchiral magnetic order of Mn atoms in Kagome layers. Here we study the stability\nof such magnetic order in the absence of external magnetic fields on the basis\nof stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for a simplified two-dimensional\nmodel of these materials. We find that even without external magnetic fields,\nthe ordered state is, once formed, highly stable against thermal fluctuations.\nMoreover, we show that if Mn spins are well confined inside each Kagome layers,\nby injecting spin-current using spin-filtering effect of ferromagnetic metals,\nwe can control the in-plane magnetic structure in a field free way.\n", "  Hybrid photoelectric detection of NV magnetic resonances (PDMR) is\nanticipated to lead to scalable quantum chip technology. To achieve this goal,\nit is crucial to prove that PDMR readout is compatible with the coherent spin\ncontrol. Here we present PDMR MW pulse protocols that filter background\ncurrents related to ionization of NS0 defects and achieve a high contrast and\nS/N ratio. We demonstrate Rabi and Ramsey protocols on shallow\nnitrogen-implanted electronic grade diamond and the coherent readout of ~ 5 NV\nspins, as a first step towards the fabrication of scalable photoelectric\nquantum devices.\n", "  Ultracold neutrons (UCNs) are key for precision studies of fundamental\nparameters of the neutron and in searches for new CP violating processes or\nexotic interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The most\nprominent example is the search for a permanent electric dipole moment of the\nneutron (nEDM). We have performed an experimental comparison of the leading UCN\nsources currently operating. We have used a 'standard' UCN storage bottle with\na volume of 32 liters, comparable in size to nEDM experiments, which allows us\nto compare the UCN density available at a given beam port.\n", "  We present results from point-contact spectroscopy of the antiferromagnetic\nheavy-fermion superconductor UPd$_2$Al$_3$: conductance spectra are taken from\nsingle crystals with two major surface orientations as a function of\ntemperature and magnetic field, and analyzed using a theory of co-tunneling\ninto an Anderson lattice. Spectroscopic signatures are clearly identified\nincluding the distinct asymmetric double-peak structure arising from the\nopening of a hybridization gap when a coherent heavy Fermi liquid is formed.\nBoth the hybridization gap, found to be 7.2 $\\pm$ 0.3 meV at 4 K, and the\nconductance enhancement above a flat background decrease upon increasing\ntemperature. While the hybridization gap is extrapolated to remain finite up to\n$\\sim$28 K, close to the temperature around which the magnetic susceptibility\ndisplays a broad peak, the conductance enhancement vanishes at $\\sim$18 K,\nslightly above the antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_\\textrm{N}$\n$\\approx$ 14 K). This rapid decrease of the conductance enhancement is\nunderstood as a consequence of the junction drifting away from the ballistic\nregime due to increased scattering off magnons associated with the localized U\n5$f$ electrons. This shows that while the hybridization gap opening is not\ndirectly associated with the antiferromagnetic ordering, its visibility in the\nconductance is greatly affected by the temperature-dependent magnetic\nexcitations. Our findings are not only consistent with the 5$f$ dual-nature\npicture in the literature but also shed new light on the interplay between the\nitinerant and localized electrons in UPd$_2$Al$_3$.\n", "  We investigate two approaches to non minimally coupled gravity theories which\npresent linear inflation as attractor solution: a) the scalar-tensor theory\napproach, where we look for a scalar-tensor theory that would restore results\nof linear inflation in the strong coupling limit for any form of the\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity of the form of $f(\\varphi)R/2$; b) the particle\nphysics approach, where we motivate the form of the Jordan frame potential by\nthe loop corrections to the inflaton field. In both cases the Jordan frame\npotentials are modifications of the induced inflation, but instead of the\nStarobinsky attractor they lead to the linear inflation in the strong coupling\nlimit.\n", "  If a small \"particle\" of mass $\\mu M$ (with $\\mu \\ll 1$) orbits a black hole\nof mass $M$, the leading-order radiation-reaction effect is an\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\mu^2)$ \"self-force\" acting on the particle, with a corresponding\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\mu)$ \"self-acceleration\" of the particle away from a geodesic.\nSuch \"extreme--mass-ratio inspiral\" systems are likely to be important\ngravitational-wave sources for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.\nHere we consider the \"toy model\" problem of computing the self-force for a\nscalar-field particle on a bound eccentric orbit in Kerr spacetime. We use the\nBarack-Golbourn-Vega-Detweiler effective-source regularization with a 4th order\npuncture field, followed by an $e^{im\\phi}$ (\"m-mode\") Fourier decomposition\nand a separate time-domain numerical evolution in $2+1$ dimensions for each\n$m$. We introduce a finite worldtube that surrounds the particle worldline and\ndefine our evolution equations in a piecewise manner so that the effective\nsource is only used within the worldtube. Viewed as a spatial region, the\nworldtube moves to follow the particle's orbital motion. We use slices of\nconstant Boyer-Lindquist time in the region of the particle's motion, deformed\nto be asymptotically hyperboloidal and compactified near the horizon and\n$\\mathcal{J}^+$. We present numerical results for a number of test cases with\norbital eccentricities as high as $0.98$. In some cases we find large\noscillations (\"wiggles\") in the self-force shortly after periastron passage.\n", "  We reformulate the projected imaginary-time evolution of Full Configuration\nInteraction Quantum Monte Carlo in terms of a Lagrangian minimization. This\nnaturally leads to the admission of polynomial complex wavefunction\nparameterizations, circumventing the exponential scaling of the approach. While\npreviously these functions have traditionally inhabited the domain of\nVariational Monte Carlo, we consider recently developments for the\nidentification of deep-learning neural networks to optimize this Lagrangian,\nwhich can be written as a modification of the propagator for the wavefunction\ndynamics. We demonstrate this approach with a form of Tensor Network State, and\nuse it to find solutions to the strongly-correlated Hubbard model, as well as\nits application to a fully periodic ab-initio Graphene sheet. The number of\nvariables which can be simultaneously optimized greatly exceeds alternative\nformulations of Variational Monte Carlo, allowing for systematic improvability\nof the wavefunction flexibility towards exactness for a number of different\nforms, whilst blurring the line between traditional Variational and Projector\nquantum Monte Carlo approaches.\n", "  The mutual interaction between the different eigenmodes of a spin-torque\noscillator can lead to a large variety of physical mechanisms from mode hopping\nto multi-mode generation, that usually reduce their performances as\nradio-frequency devices. To tackle this issue for the future applications, we\ninvestigate the properties of a model spin-torque oscillator that is composed\nof two coupled vortices with one vortex in each of the two magnetic layers of\nthe oscillator. In such double-vortex system, the remarkable properties of\nenergy transfer between the coupled modes, one being excited by spin transfer\ntorque while the second one being damped, result into an alteration of the\ndamping parameters. As a consequence, the oscillator nonlinear behavior is\nconcomitantly drastically impacted. This efficient coupling mechanism, driven\nmainly by the dynamic dipolar field generated by the spin transfer torque\ninduced motion of the vortices, gives rise to an unexpected dynamical regime of\nself-resonance excitation. These results show that mode coupling can be\nleveraged for controlling the synchronization process as well as the frequency\ntunability of spin-torque oscillators.\n", "  We report the discovery of a multiply-imaged gravitationally lensed Type Ia\nsupernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift $z=0.409$. This phenomenon could\nbe identified because the light from the stellar explosion was magnified more\nthan fifty times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening\ngalaxy. We used high spatial resolution observations to resolve four images of\nthe lensed supernova, approximately 0.3\" from the center of the foreground\ngalaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of $\\sim$1 kiloparsec, smaller\nthan what is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational lensing.\nThe large magnification and symmetric image configuration implies close\nalignment between the line-of-sight to the supernova and the lens. The relative\nmagnifications of the four images provide evidence for sub-structures in the\nlensing galaxy.\n", "  We study how a strong gravity affects the equation of state of matters. For\nthis purpose, we employ a canonical ensemble of classical monoatomic ideal gas\ninside a box in a Rindler spacetime. The total energy decreases monotonically\nwith the increase of the external gravity representing its attractiveness. It\nis however bounded below, which is different from that of the Newtonian gravity\ncase. As for the entropy, it decreases with the external gravity in the\nNewtonian regime. However, in the presence of strong gravity or\nultra-relativistic high temperature, the entropy increases with the gravity.\nThis result can be a resolution of the negative entropy problem of the ideal\ngas in the Newtonian gravity. In the presence of strong gravity, the bottom of\nthe box is very close to the event horizon of the Rindler spacetime mimicking a\nblackhole and the gas behaves as if it is on an effective two dimensional\nsurface located at the bottom of the box. Investigating the equation of state\nin the strong gravity regime, the temperature of the system is found to be not\na free parameter but to approach a fixed value proportional to the external\ngravity, which is reminiscent of the Unruh temperature.\n", "  We characterize the selection function of RAVE using 2MASS as our underlying\npopulation, which we assume represents all stars which could have potentially\nbeen observed. We evaluate the completeness fraction as a function of position,\nmagnitude, and color in two ways: first, on a field-by-field basis, and second,\nin equal-size areas on the sky. Then, we consider the effect of the RAVE\nstellar parameter pipeline on the final resulting catalogue, which in principle\nlimits the parameter space over which our selection function is valid. Our\nfinal selection function is the product of the completeness fraction and the\nselection function of the pipeline. We then test if the application of the\nselection function introduces biases in the derived parameters. To do this, we\ncompare a parent mock catalogue generated using Galaxia with a mock-RAVE\ncatalogue where the selection function of RAVE has been applied. We conclude\nthat for stars brighter than I = 12, between $4000 \\rm K < T_{\\rm eff} < 8000\n\\rm K$ and $0.5 < \\rm{log}\\,g < 5.0$, RAVE is kinematically and chemically\nunbiased with respect to expectations from Galaxia.\n", "  Recent experimental signals have led to a revival of tetraquarks, the\nhypothetical $q^2\\bar{q}^2$ hadronic states proposed by Jaffe in 1976 to\nexplain the light scalar mesons. Mesonic structures with exotic quantum numbers\nhave indeed been observed recently, though a controversy persists whether these\nare true resonances and not merely kinematical threshold enhancements, or\notherwise states not of a true $q^2\\bar{q}^2$ nature. Moreover, puzzling\nnon-exotic mesons are also often claimed to have a tetraquark configuration.\nHowever, the corresponding model calculations are practically always carried\nout in pure and static bound-state approaches, ignoring completely the coupling\nto asymptotic two-meson states and unitarity, especially the dynamical effects\nthereof. In this short paper we argue that such static predictions of real\ntetraquark masses are highly unreliable and provide little evidence of the very\nexistence of such states.\n", "  We describe a macroscopic beam splitter for polar neutral molecules. A\ncomplex electrode structure is required for the beam splitter which would be\nvery difficult to produce with traditional manufacturing methods. Instead, we\nmake use of a nascent manufacturing technique: 3D printing of a plastic piece,\nfollowed by electroplating. This fabrication method opens a plethora of avenues\nfor research, since 3D printing imposes practically no limitations on possible\nshapes, and the plating produces chemically robust, conductive construction\nelements with an almost free choice of surface material; it has the added\nadvantage of dramatically reduced production cost and time. Our beam splitter\nis an electrostatic hexapole guide that smoothly transforms into two bent\nquadrupoles. We demonstrate the correct functioning of this device by\nseparating a supersonic molecular beam of ND3 into two correlated fractions. It\nis shown that this device can be used to implement experiments with\ndifferential detection wherein one of the fractions serves as a probe and the\nother as a reference. Reverse operation would allow to merging of two beams of\nneutral polar molecules.\n", "  The transition between a Minkowski space region and a parity breaking medium\ndomain is thoroughly discussed. The requirement of continuity of the field\noperator content across the separating boundary of the two domains leads to\nBogolyubov transformations, squeezed pairs states and squeeze operators that\nturn out to generate a functional SU(2) algebra. According to this algebraic\napproach, the reflection and transmission probability amplitude across the\nseparating boundary are computed. The probability rate of the emission or\nabsorption of squeezed pairs out of the vacuum (generalization of the\nSauter-Schwinger-Nikishov formula) is obtained.\n", "  We show that the out-of-time-order correlation (OTOC) $ \\langle W(t)^\\dagger\nV(0)^\\dagger W(t)V(0)\\rangle$ in many-body localized (MBL) and marginal MBL\nsystems can be efficiently calculated by the spectrum bifurcation\nrenormalization group (SBRG). We find that in marginal MBL systems, the\nscrambling time $t_\\text{scr}$ follows a stretched exponential scaling with the\ndistance $d_{WV}$ between the operators $W$ and $V$:\n$t_\\text{scr}\\sim\\exp(\\sqrt{d_{WV}/l_0})$, which demonstrates Sinai diffusion\nof quantum information and the enhanced scrambling by the quantum criticality\nin non-chaotic systems.\n", "  Long-wavelength matter inhomogeneities contain cleaner information on the\nnature of primordial perturbations as well as the physics of the early\nuniverse. The large-scale coherent overdensity and tidal force, not directly\nobservable for a finite-volume galaxy survey, are both related to the Hessian\nof large-scale gravitational potential and therefore of equal importance. We\nshow that the coherent tidal force causes a homogeneous anisotropic distortion\nof the observed distribution of galaxies in all three directions, perpendicular\nand parallel to the line-of-sight direction. This effect mimics the\nredshift-space distortion signal of galaxy peculiar velocities, as well as a\ndistortion by the Alcock-Paczynski effect. We quantify its impact on the\nredshift-space power spectrum to the leading order, and discuss its importance\nfor the ongoing and upcoming galaxy surveys.\n", "  We present a tuneup protocol for qubit gates with tenfold speedup over\ntraditional methods reliant on qubit initialization by energy relaxation. This\nspeedup is achieved by constructing a cost function for Nelder-Mead\noptimization from real-time correlation of non-demolition measurements\ninterleaving gate operations without pause. Applying the protocol on a transmon\nqubit achieves 0.999 average Clifford fidelity in one minute, as independently\nverified using randomized benchmarking and gate set tomography. The adjustable\nsensitivity of the cost function allows detecting fractional changes in gate\nerror with nearly constant signal-to-noise ratio. The restless concept\ndemonstrated can be readily extended to the tuneup of two-qubit gates and\nmeasurement operations.\n", "  A quantum algorithm that solves the time-dependent Dirac equation on a\ndigital quantum computer is developed and analyzed. The time evolution is\nperformed by an operator splitting decomposition technique that allows for a\nmapping of the Dirac operator to a quantum walk supplemented by unitary\nrotation steps in spinor space. Every step of the splitting method is\ndecomposed into sets of quantum gates. It is demonstrated that the algorithm\nhas an exponential speedup over the implementation of the same numerical scheme\non a classical computer, as long as certain conditions are satisfied. Finally,\nan explicit decomposition of this algorithm into elementary gates from a\nuniversal set is carried out to determine the resource requirements. It is\nshown that a proof-of-principle calculation may be possible with actual quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "  Optical pump-THz probe spectroscopy is used to investigate the exciton\nformation dynamics and its intensity dependence in bulk Ge. Associated with the\nintra-excitonic 1s-2p transition, the gradual build-up of an absorption peak\naround 3.1 meV (0.75 THz) signifies the delayed exciton formation after optical\npump which is accelerated for higher excitation densities. Analyzing the\nspectral shape of this THz absorption resonance, two distinct resonances are\nfound which are attributed to the mass-anisotropy of L valley electrons via a\nmicroscopic theory.\n", "  We report ALMA observations of the most massive (star forming) galaxy in the\nredshift range 3<z<4 within the whole GOODS-S field. We detect a large\nelongated structure of molecular gas around the massive primeval galaxy, traced\nby the CO(4-3) emission, and extended over 40 kpc. We infer a mass of the large\ngaseous structure of Mgas~2-6x10^11 Msun. About 60% of this mass is not\ndirectly associated with either the central galaxy or its two lower mass\nsatellites. The CO extended structure is also detected in continuum thermal\nemission. The kinematics of the molecular gas shows the presence of different\ncomponents, which cannot be ascribed to simple rotation. Furthermore, on even\nlarger scales, we detect nine additional CO systems within a radius of 250 kpc\nfrom the massive galaxy and mostly distributed in the same direction as the CO\nelongated structure found in the central 40 kpc. The stacked images of these CO\nsystems show detections in the thermal continuum and in the X-rays, suggesting\nthat these systems are forming stars at a rate of 30-120 Msun/yr. We suggest\nthat the extended gas structure, combined with its kinematic properties, and\nthe gas rich star forming systems detected on larger scales, are tracing the\ninner and densest regions of large scale accreting streams, feeding the central\nmassive galaxy. These results corroborate models of galaxy formation, in which\naccreting streams are clumpy and undergo some star formation (hence enriching\nthe streams with metals) even before accreting onto the central galaxy.\n", "  Working within the Nonequilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, a\nformula for the two-time current correlation function is derived for the case\nof transport through a nanojunction in response to an arbitrary time-dependent\nbias. The one-particle Hamiltonian and the Wide Band Limit Approximation (WBLA)\nare assumed, enabling us to extract all necessary Green's functions and self\nenergies for the system, extending the analytic work presented previously\n[Ridley et al. Phys. Rev. B (2015)]. We show that our new expression for the\ntwo-time correlation function generalises the B\\\"uttiker theory of shot and\nthermal noise on the current through a nanojunction to the time-dependent bias\ncase including the transient regime following the switch-on. Transient terms in\nthe correlation function arise from an initial state that does not assume (as\nis usually done) that the system is initially uncoupled, i.e. our approach is\npartition-free. We show that when the bias loses its time-dependence, the long\ntime-limit of the current correlation function depends on the time difference\nonly, as in this case an ideal steady state is reached. This enables derivation\nof known results for the single frequency power spectrum and for the zero\nfrequency limit of this power spectrum. In addition, we present a technique\nwhich for the first time facilitates fast calculations of the transient quantum\nnoise, valid for arbitrary temperature, time and voltage scales. We apply this\nto the quantum dot and molecular wire systems for both DC and AC biases, and\nfind a novel signature of the traversal time for electrons crossing the wire in\nthe time-dependent cross-lead current correlations.\n", "  The use of artificial atoms as an active lasing medium opens a way to\nconstruct novel sources of nonclassical radiation. An example is the creation\nof photon-number squeezed light. Here we present a design of a laser consisting\nof multiple Cooper-pair transistors coupled to a microwave resonator. Over a\nbroad range of experimentally realizable parameters, this laser creates\nphoton-number squeezed microwave radiation, characterized by a Fano factor $F\n\\ll 1$, at a very high resonator photon number. We investigate the impact of\ngate-charge disorder in a Cooper-pair transistor and show that the system can\ncreate squeezed strong microwave fields even in the presence of maximum\ndisorder.\n", "  We will show that the period $T$ of a closed orbit of the planar circular\nrestricted three-body problem (viewed on rotating coordinates) depends on the\nregion it encloses. Roughly speaking, we show that, $2 T=k\\pi+\\int_\\Omega g$\nwhere $k$ is an integer, $\\Omega$ is the region enclosed by the periodic orbit\nand $g:\\mathbb{R}^2\\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a function that only depends on the\nconstant $C$ known as the Jacobian integral; it does not depend on $\\Omega$.\nThis theorem has a Keplerian flavor in the sense that it relates the period\nwith the space \"swept\" by the orbit. As an application, we prove that there is\na neighborhood around $L_4$ such that every periodic solution contained in this\nneighborhood must move clockwise. The same result holds true for $L_5$.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the prospects of future $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders\nin testing a Higgs triplet model with a scalar triplet and a scalar singlet\nunder $SU(2)$. The parameters of the model are fixed so that the lightest\n$CP-$even state corresponds to the Higgs particle observed at the LHC at around\n$125$ GeV. This study investigates if the second heaviest $CP-$even, the\nheaviest $CP-$odd and the singly charged states can be observed at existing and\nfuture colliders by computing their accessible production and decay channels.\nIn general, the LHC is not well equipped to produce a Higgs boson which is not\nmainly doublet-like, so we turn our focus to lepton colliders. We find\ndistinctive features of this model in cases when the second heaviest $CP-$even\nHiggs is triplet-like, singlet-like or a mixture. These features could\ndistinguish the model from other scenarios at future $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders.\n", "  We simulate the spindle gravitational collapse of a collisionless particle\nsystem in a 3D numerical relativity code and compare the qualitative results\nwith the old work done by Shapiro and Teukolsky(ST). The simulation starts from\nthe prolate-shaped distribution of particles and a spindle collapse is\nobserved. The peak value and its spatial position of curvature invariants are\nmonitored during the time evolution. We find that the peak value of the\nKretschmann invariant takes a maximum at some moment, when there is no apparent\nhorizon, and its value is greater for a finer resolution, which is consistent\nwith what is reported in ST. We also find a similar tendency for the Weyl\ncurvature invariant. Therefore, our results lend support to the formation of a\nnaked singularity as a result of the axially symmetric spindle collapse of a\ncollisionless particle system in the limit of infinite resolution. However,\nunlike in ST, our code does not break down then but go well beyond.We find that\nthe peak values of the curvature invariants start to gradually decrease with\ntime for a certain period of time. Another notable difference from ST is that,\nin our case, the peak position of the Kretschmann curvature invariant is always\ninside the matter distribution.\n", "  The ultraviolet completion of a large N QCD model requires introducing new\ndegrees of freedom at certain scale so that the UV behavior may become\nasymptotically conformal with no Landau poles and no UV divergences of Wilson\nloops. These UV degrees of freedom are represented by certain anti-branes\narranged on the blown-up sphere of a warped resolved conifold in a way that\nthey are separated from the other set of branes that control the IR behavior of\nthe theory. This separation of the branes and the anti-branes creates\ninstability in the theory. Further complications arise from the curvature of\nthe ambient space. We show that, despite these analytical hurdles, stability\nmay still be achieved by switching on appropriate world-volume fluxes on the\nbranes. The UV degrees of freedom, on the other hand, modify the RG flow in the\nmodel. We discuss this in details by evaluating the flow from IR confining to\nUV conformal. Finally we lay down a calculational scheme to study bulk\nviscosity which, in turn, would signal the inherent non-conformality in this\nmodel.\n", "  Explicit analytic expressions are derived for the effective-range function\nfor the case when the interaction is represented by a sum of the short-range\nsquare-well and long-range Coulomb potentials. These expressions are then\ntransformed into forms convenient for extrapolating to the negative-energy\nregion and obtaining the information about bound-state properties. Alternative\nways of extrapolation are discussed. Analytic properties of separate terms\nentering these expressions for the effective-range function and the\npartial-wave scattering amplitude are investigated.\n", "  An effective theory of dark matter offers an attractive framework for global\nanalyses of dark matter. In the light of global fits we test the validity of\nthe link between the non-relativistic dark matter annihilation, or the\npredicted relic density, and LHC signatures. Specifically, we study how well\nthe effective theory describes the main features of simple models with\ns-channel and t-channel mediators coupling to the Standard Model at tree level\nor through one-loop diagrams. Our results indicate that global dark matter\nanalyses in terms of effective Lagrangians are highly non-trivial to interpret\nin term of actual models.\n", "  Recent machine learning methods make it possible to model potential energy of\natomic configurations with chemical-level accuracy (as calculated from\nab-initio calculations) and at speeds suitable for molecular dynam- ics\nsimulation. Best performance is achieved when the known physical constraints\nare encoded in the machine learning models. For example, the atomic energy is\ninvariant under global translations and rotations, it is also invariant to\npermutations of same-species atoms. Although simple to state, these symmetries\nare complicated to encode into machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we\npresent a machine learning approach based on graph theory that naturally\nincorporates translation, rotation, and permutation symmetries. Specifically,\nwe use a random walk graph kernel to measure the similarity of two adjacency\nmatrices, each of which represents a local atomic environment. This Graph\nApproximated Energy (GRAPE) approach is flexible and admits many possible\nextensions. We benchmark a simple version of GRAPE by predicting atomization\nenergies on a standard dataset of organic molecules.\n", "  The temperature-dependent electronic structures of heavy fermion compound\nCeB$_{6}$ are investigated thoroughly by means of the combination of density\nfunctional theory and single-site dynamical mean-field theory. The band\nstructure, density of states, and 4$f$ valence state fluctuation of CeB$_{6}$\nare calculated in a broad temperature range of 10 $\\sim$ 120 K. Overall, the\n4$f$ electrons remain incoherent, approximately irrespective of the\ntemperature. However, we find that these observables exhibit some unusual\nfeatures near 20 K. In addition, the evolution of 4$f$ orbital occupancy, total\nangular momentum, and total energy with respect to temperature shows apparent\nsingularity around 20 K. We believe that these tantalizing characteristics are\nprobably related to a \"hidden\" electronic transition.\n", "  Using density matrix renormalization group numerical calculations, we study\nthe phase diagram of the half filled Bose-Hubbard system in the sawtooth\nlattice with strong frustration in the kinetic energy term. We focus in\nparticular on values of the hopping terms which produce a flat band and show\nthat, in the presence of contact and near neighbor repulsion, three phases\nexist: Mott insulator (MI), charge density wave (CDW), and the topological\nHaldane insulating (HI) phase which displays edge states and particle imbalance\nbetween the two ends of the system. We find that, even though the entanglement\nspectrum in the Haldane phase is not doubly degenerate, it is in excellent\nagreement with the entanglement spectrum of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki\n(AKLT) state built in the Wannier basis associated with the flat band. This\nemphasizes that the absence of degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum is not\nnecessarily a signature of a non-topological phase, but rather that the\n(hidden) protecting symmetry involves non-local states. Finally, we also show\nthat the HI phase is stable against small departure from flatness of the band\nbut is destroyed for larger ones.\n", "  Using a reliably measured intrinsic (i.e. corrected for absorption effects)\npresent-day luminosity function of high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the\n0.25-2 keV energy band per unit star-formation rate, we estimate the preheating\nof the early Universe by soft X-rays from such systems. We find that X-ray\nirradiation, mainly executed by ultraluminous and supersoft ultraluminous X-ray\nsources with luminosity L> 10^39 erg/s, could significantly heat (T>T_cmb,\nwhere T_cmb is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background) the\nintergalactic medium by z~10 if the specific X-ray emissivity of the young\nstellar population in the early Universe was an order of magnitude higher than\nat the present epoch (which is possible due to the low metallicity of the first\ngalaxies) and the soft X-ray emission from HMXBs did not suffer strong\nabsorption within their galaxies. This makes it possible to observe the 21 cm\nline of neutral hydrogen in emission from redshifts z<10.\n", "  We use 3mm multi-line and continuum CARMA observations towards the first\nhydrostatic core (FHSC) candidate L1451-mm to characterize the envelope\nkinematics at 1000 AU scales and investigate its evolutionary state. We detect\nevidence of infall and rotation in the N2H+(1-0), NH2D(1(1,1)-1(0,1)) and\nHCN(1-0) molecular lines. We compare the position velocity diagram of the NH2D\nline with a simple kinematic model and find that it is consistent with an\nenvelope that is both infalling and rotating while conserving angular momentum\naround a central mass of about 0.06 Msun. The N2H+(1-0) LTE mass of the\nenvelope along with the inferred infall velocity leads to a mass infall rate of\napproximately 6e-6 Msun/yr, implying a young age of 10,000 years for this FHSC\ncandidate. Assuming that the accretion onto the central object is the same as\nthe infall rate we obtain that the minimum source size is 1.5-5 AU consistent\nwith the size expected for a first core. We do not see any evidence of outflow\nmotions or signs of outflow-envelope interaction at scales > 2000 AU. This is\nconsistent with previous observations that revealed a very compact outflow\n(<500 AU). We conclude that L1451-mm is indeed at a very early stage of\nevolution, either a first core or an extremely young Class 0 protostar. Our\nresults provide strong evidence that L1451-mm is the best candidate for being a\nbonafide first core.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein\ncondensate confined in a two-dimensional toroidal trap. In the immiscible\nregime we find an azimuthally periodic density distribution, with the\nperiodicity highly tuneable as a function of the spin-orbit coupling strength\nand which favours an odd number of petals in each component. This allows for a\nwide range of states that can be created. We further show that in the miscible\nregime, both components possess states with persistent flows with a unit\nwinding number difference between them and with the absolute values of these\nwinding numbers depending on the spin-orbit coupling strength. All features of\nthe odd-petal and the persistent flow states can be explained using a simple\nbut effective model.\n", "  In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of the renormalization group\n(RG) method on thermal tensor networks (TTN). By Trotter-Suzuki decomposition,\none obtains the 1+1D TTN representing the partition function of 1D quantum\nlattice models, and then employs efficient RG contractions to obtain the\nthermodynamic properties with high precision. The linearized tensor\nrenormalization group (LTRG) method, which can be used to contract TTN in an\nefficient and accurate way, is briefly reviewed. In addition, the single-layer\nLTRG can be generalized to a bilayer form, dubbed as LTRG++, in both finite-\nand infinite-size systems, with accuracies significantly improved. We provide\nthe details of LTRG++ in finite-size system, comparing its accuracy with\nsingle-layer algorithm, and elaborate the infinite-size LTRG++ in the context\nof fermion chain model. We show that the LTRG++ algorithm in infinite-size\nsystem is in essence equivalent to transfer-matrix renormalization group\nmethod, while expressed in a tensor network language. LTRG++ is then applied to\nstudy an extended Hubbard model, where the phase separation phenomenon,\ngroundstate phase diagram, as well as quantum criticality-enhanced\nmagnetocaloric effects under external fields, are investigated.\n", "  We address the problem of superconductivity for non-Fermi liquids using two\ncommonly adopted, yet apparently distinct methods: 1) the renormalization group\n(RG) and 2) Eliashberg theory. The extent to which both methods yield\nconsistent solutions for the low energy behavior of quantum metals has remained\nunclear. We show that the perturbative RG beta function for the 4-Fermi\ncoupling can be explicitly derived from the linearized Eliashberg equations,\nunder the assumption that quantum corrections are approximately local across\nenergy scales. We apply our analysis to the test case of phonon mediated\nsuperconductivity and show the consistency of both the Eliashberg and RG\ntreatments. We next study superconductivity near a class of quantum critical\npoints and find a transition between superconductivity and a \"naked\" metallic\nquantum critical point with finite, critical BCS couplings. We speculate on the\napplications of our theory to the phenomenology of unconventional metals.\n", "  In many generalized models of gravity, perfect fluids in cosmology give rise\nto gravitational slip. Simultaneously, in very broad classes of such models,\nthe propagation of gravitational waves is altered. We investigate the extent to\nwhich there is a one-to-one relationship between these two properties in three\nclasses of models with one extra degree of freedom: scalar (Horndeski and\nbeyond), vector (Einstein-Aether) and tensor (bimetric).\n  We prove that in bimetric gravity and Einstein-Aether, it is impossible to\ndynamically hide the gravitational slip on all scales whenever the propagation\nof gravitational waves is modified. Horndeski models are much more flexible,\nbut it is nonetheless only possible to hide gravitational slip dynamically when\nthe action for perturbations is tuned to evolve in time toward a divergent\nkinetic term. These results provide an explicit, theoretical argument for the\ninterpretation of future observations if they disfavoured the presence of\ngravitational slip.\n", "  In this short note we will revisit the large $N$ solution of $\\mathbb{C}P^N$\nsigma model on a finite interval of length $L$. We will find a family of\nboundary conditions for which the large $N$ saddle point can be found\nanalytically. For a certain choice of the boundary conditions the theory has\nonly one phase for all values of $L$. Also, we will provide an example when\nthere are two phases: for large $L$ there is a standard phase with an unbroken\n$U(1)$ gauge symmetry and for small $L$ there is Higgs phase with a broken\ngauge symmetry.\n", "  We propose and analyze an experimental scheme using the quantum kicked rotor\nto observe the newly-predicted coherent forward scattering peak together with\nits long-known twin brother, the coherent backscattering peak. Contrary to\ncoherent backscattering, which arises already under weak-localization\nconditions, coherent forward scattering is only triggered by Anderson or strong\nlocalization. So far, coherent forward scattering has not been observed in\nconservative systems with elastic scattering by spatial disorder. We propose to\nturn to the quantum kicked rotor, which has a long and succesful history as an\naccurate experimental platform to observe dynamical localization, i.e.,\nAnderson localization in momentum space. We analyze the coherent forward\nscattering effect for the quantum kicked rotor by extensive numerical\nsimulations, both in the orthogonal and unitary class of disordered quantum\nsystems, and show that an experimental realization involving phase-space\nrotation techniques is within reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments.\n", "  We analyze the equivalence between discrete-time coined quantum walks and\nSzegedy's quantum walks. We characterize a class of flip-flop coined models\nwith generalized Grover coin on a graph $\\Gamma$ that can be directly converted\ninto Szegedy's model on the subdivision graph of $\\Gamma$ and we describe a\nmethod to convert one model into the other. This method improves previous\nresults in literature that need to use the staggered model and the concept of\nline graph, which are avoided here.\n", "  We report on the electronic band structure, structural, magnetic and thermal\nproperties of Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Sn$_5$. Ce $L_{\\mathrm{III}}$-edge XAS spectra give\ndirect evidence for an intermediate valence behaviour. Thermodynamic\nmeasurements reveal magnetic transitions at $T_{\\mathrm{N1}}\\approx$ 2.9 K and\n$T_{\\mathrm{N2}}\\approx$ 2.4 K. Electrical resistivity shows behaviour typical\nfor Kondo lattices. The coexistence of magnetic order and valence fluctuations\nin a Kondo lattice system we attribute to a peculiar crystal structure in which\nCe ions occupy two distinct lattice sites. Analysis of the structural features\nof Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Sn$_5$, together with results of electronic band structure\ncalculations and thermodynamic data indicate that Ce2 ions are in an\nintermediate valence state with the ground state electronic configuration close\nto 4$f^0$, whereas Ce1 ions are trivalent (4$f^1$) and contribute to the low\ntemperature magnetic ordering. Thus, our joined experimental and theoretical\ninvestigations classify Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Sn$_5$ as a multivalent charge-ordered\nsystem.\n", "  Transition form factors $F_{P\\gamma^*\\gamma^{(*)}}$ of pseudoscalar mesons\nare studied within the framework of the domain model of confinement, chiral\nsymmetry breaking and hadronization. In this model, the QCD vacuum is described\nby the statistical ensemble of domain wall networks which represents the almost\neverywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual gluon field configurations.\nCalculations of the form factors are performed consistently with mass spectra\nof light, heavy-light and double-heavy mesons, their weak and strong decay\nconstants. Influence of the nonperturbative intermediate range gluon fields on\nasymptotic behaviour of pion transition form factor is of particular interest,\nas it can potentially lead to the growth of $Q^2F_{\\pi\\gamma^*\\gamma}(Q^2)$. It\nis found that $Q^2F_{\\pi\\gamma^*\\gamma}(Q^2)$ approaches a constant value at\nasymptotically large $Q^2$. However, this limit differs from the standard\nfactorization bound, though for pion form factor complies with Belle data more\nlikely than with BaBar ones. At the same time the generally accepted\nfactorization bound is shown to be satisfied for the case of the symmetric\nkinematics, $Q^2F_{P\\gamma^*\\gamma^*}(Q^2)$. Peculiarities of description of\n$\\eta$, $\\eta'$ and $\\eta_c$ form factors within the model are discussed in\ndetail.\n", "  We derive the charged current absorption rate of electron and anti-electron\nneutrinos in dense matter using a fully relativistic approach valid at\narbitrary matter degeneracy. We include mean field energy shifts due to nuclear\ninteractions and the corrections due to weak magnetism. The rates are derived\nboth from the familiar Fermi's Golden Rule, and from the techniques of finite\ntemperature field theory, and shown to be equivalent. In various limits, these\nresults can also be used to calculate neutral current opacities. We find that\nsome pieces of the response have been left out in previous derivations and\ntheir contribution at high density can be significant. Useful formulae and\ndetailed derivations are presented and we provide a new open source\nimplementation of these opacities for use in radiation hydrodynamic simulations\nof core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers.\n", "  Chiral tensors of mixed Young symmetry, which exist in the same spacetime\ndimensions $2 + 4n$ where chiral $p$-forms can be defined, are investigated.\nSuch chiral tensors have been argued to play a central role in exotic\nformulations of gravity in 6 dimensions and possess intriguing properties. A\nvariational principle that yields the chiral equations of motion is explicitly\nconstructed and related to the action for a non-chiral tensor. The use of\nprepotentials turns out to be essential in our analysis. We also comment on\ndimensional reduction.\n", "  We present a calibration of halo assembly bias using the Separate Universe\ntechnique. Specifically, we measure the response of halo abundances at fixed\nmass and concentration to the presence of an infinite-wavelength initial\nperturbation. We develop an analytical framework for describing the\nconcentration dependence of this peak-background split halo bias -- a measure\nof assembly bias -- relying on the near-Lognormal distribution of halo\nconcentration at fixed halo mass. The combination of this analytical framework\nand the Separate Universe technique allows us to achieve very high precision in\nthe calibration of the linear assembly bias $b_1$, and qualitatively reproduces\nknown trends such as the monotonic decrease (increase) of $b_1$ with halo\nconcentration at large (small) masses. The same framework extends to the\nconcentration dependence of higher order bias parameters $b_n$, and we present\nthe first calibration of assembly bias in $b_2$. Our calibrations are directly\napplicable in analytical Halo Model calculations that seek to robustly detect\ngalaxy assembly bias in observational samples. We detect a non-universality in\nthe $b_1 - b_2$ relation arising from assembly bias, and suggest that\nsimultaneous measurements of these bias parameters could be used to both detect\nthe signature of assembly bias as well as mitigate its effects in cosmological\nanalyses.\n", "  We study the quantum melting of stripe phases in models with competing short\nrange and long range interactions decaying with distance as $1/r^{\\sigma}$ in\ntwo space dimensions. At zero temperature we find a two step disordering of the\nstripe phases with the growth of quantum fluctuations. A quantum critical point\nseparating a phase with long range positional order from a phase with long\nrange orientational order is found when $\\sigma \\leq 4/3$, which includes the\nCoulomb interaction case $\\sigma=1$. For $\\sigma > 4/3$ the transition is first\norder, which includes the dipolar case $\\sigma=3$. Another quantum critical\npoint separates the orientationally ordered (nematic) phase from a quantum\ndisordered phase for any value of $\\sigma$. Critical exponents as a function of\n$\\sigma$ are computed at one loop order in an $\\epsilon$ expansion and,\nwhenever available, compared with known results. For finite temperatures it is\nfound that for $\\sigma \\geq 2$ orientational order decays algebraically with\ndistance until a critical Kosterlitz-Thouless line. Nevertheless, for $\\sigma <\n2$ it is found that long range orientational order can exist at finite\ntemperatures until a critical line which terminates at the quantum critical\npoint at $T=0$. The temperature dependence of the critical line near the\nquantum critical point is determined as a function of $\\sigma$.\n", "  Recent progress in cosmology has relied on combining different cosmological\nprobes. In earlier work, we implemented an integrated approach to cosmology\nwhere the probes are combined into a common framework at the map level. This\nhas the advantage of taking full account of the correlations between the\ndifferent probes, to provide a stringent test of systematics and of the\nvalidity of the cosmological model. We extend this analysis to include not only\nCMB temperature, galaxy clustering, weak lensing from SDSS but also CMB\nlensing, weak lensing from the DES SV survey, Type Ia SNe and $H_{0}$\nmeasurements. This yields 12 auto- and cross-power spectra as well as\nbackground probes. Furthermore, we extend the treatment of systematic\nuncertainties. For $\\Lambda$CDM, we find results that are consistent with our\nearlier work. Given our enlarged data set and systematics treatment, this\nconfirms the robustness of our analysis and results. Furthermore, we find that\nour best-fit cosmological model gives a good fit to the data we consider with\nno signs of tensions within our analysis. We also find our constraints to be\nconsistent with those found by WMAP9, SPT and ACT and the KiDS weak lensing\nsurvey. Comparing with the Planck Collaboration results, we see a broad\nagreement, but there are indications of a tension from the marginalized\nconstraints in most pairs of cosmological parameters. Since our analysis\nincludes CMB temperature Planck data at $10 < \\ell < 610$, the tension appears\nto arise between the Planck high$-\\ell$ and the other measurements.\nFurthermore, we find the constraints on the probe calibration parameters to be\nin agreement with expectations, showing that the data sets are mutually\nconsistent. In particular, this yields a confirmation of the amplitude\ncalibration of the weak lensing measurements from SDSS, DES SV and Planck CMB\nlensing from our integrated analysis. [abridged]\n", "  We explore the dependence of the incidence of moderate-luminosity ($L_{X} =\n10^{41.9-43.7}$ erg s$^{-1}$) AGNs and the distribution of their accretion\nrates on host color at 0.5 < z < 2.5, using deep X-ray data in GOODS fields. We\nuse extinction-corrected rest-frame U-V colors to divide both AGN hosts and\nnon-AGN galaxies into red sequence (quiescent), green valley (transition), and\nblue cloud (star-forming) populations. We find that both the AGN fraction at\nfixed stellar mass and its evolution with redshift are dependent on host\ncolors. Most notably, red galaxies have the lowest AGN fraction (~5\\%) at z~1\nyet with most rapid redshift evolution, increasing by a factor of 5 (~24\\%) at\nz~2. Green galaxies exhibit the highest AGN fraction across all redshifts,\nwhich is most pronounced at z~2 with more than half of them hosting an AGN at\n$M_{*} > 10^{10.6} M_{\\odot}$. Together with the high AGN fraction in red\ngalaxies at z~2, this indicates that X-ray AGNs could be important in both\ntransforming blue galaxies into red ones and subsequently maintaining their\nquiescence at high redshift. Furthermore, consistent with low-redshift studies,\nwe find that the probability of hosting an AGN in the total galaxy population\ncan be characterized by a universal Eddington ratio ($p(\\lambda_{Edd}) \\sim\n\\lambda_{Edd}^{-0.4}$) and a moderate redshift evolution. Yet consistent with\ntheir different AGN fractions, different populations appear to also have\ndifferent $p(\\lambda_{Edd})$ with red galaxies exhibiting more rapid redshift\nevolution than green and blue ones. Evidence for a steeper power law of\n$p(\\lambda_{Edd})$ in red galaxies is also presented, though larger samples are\nneeded to confirm. These results suggest that the AGN accretion or the growth\nof supermassive black holes is related to their host properties, and may also\ninfluence their hosts in a different mode dependent on the host color.\n", "  We present results of long NuSTAR (200 ks) and XMM-Newton (100 ks)\nobservations of the Arches stellar cluster, a source of bright thermal (kT~2\nkeV) X-rays with prominent Fe XXV K_alpha 6.7 keV line emission and a nearby\nmolecular cloud, characterized by an extended non-thermal hard X-ray continuum\nand fluorescent Fe K_alpha 6.4 keV line of a neutral or low ionization state\nmaterial around the cluster. Our analysis demonstrates that the non-thermal\nemission of the Arches cloud underwent a dramatic change, with its homogeneous\nmorphology, traced by fluorescent Fe K_alpha line emission, vanishing after\n2012, revealing three bright clumps. The declining trend of the cloud emission,\nif linearly fitted, is consistent with half-life decay time of ~8 years. Such\nstrong variations have been observed in several other molecular clouds in the\nGalactic Centre, including the giant molecular cloud Sgr B2, and point toward a\nsimilar propagation of illuminating fronts, presumably induced by the past\nflaring activity of Sgr A*.\n", "  Printing technology based on plasmonic structures has many advantages over\npigment based color printing such as high resolution, ultra-compact size and\nlow power consumption. However, due to high losses and broad resonance behavior\nof metals in the visible spectrum, it becomes challenging to produce\nwell-defined colors. Here, we investigate cross-shaped dielectric\nnanoresonators which enable high quality resonance in the visible spectral\nregime and, hence, high quality colors. We numerically predict and\nexperimentally demonstrate that the proposed all-dielectric nanostructures\nexhibit high quality colors with selective wavelengths, in particular, due to\nlower losses as compared to metal based plasmonic filters. This results in\nfundamental colors (RGB) with high hue and saturation. We further show that a\nlarge gamut of colors can be achieved by selecting the appropriate length and\nwidth of individual $Si$ nanoantennas. Moreover, the proposed all-dielectric\nmetasurface based color filters can be integrated with the well matured\nfabrication technology of electronic devices.\n", "  In addition to the emission of gravitational waves (GWs) the coalescence and\nmerger of two neutron stars will produce a variety of electromagnetic (EM)\nsignals. In this work we combine a large set of numerical relativity\nsimulations performed by different groups and we present fits for the mass,\nkinetic energy, and the velocities of the dynamical ejected material.\nAdditionally, we comment on the geometry and composition of the ejecta and\ndiscuss the influence of the stars' individual rotation.\n  The derived fits can be used to approximate the luminosity and lightcurve of\nthe kilonovae (macronovae) and to estimate the main properties of the radio\nflares. This correlation between the binary parameters and the EM signals\nallows in case of a GW detection to approximate possible EM counterparts when\nfirst estimates of the masses are available. After a possible kilonovae\nobservation our results could also be used to restrict the region of the\nparameter space which has to be covered by numerical relativity simulations.\n", "  We present a general model, based on a Hamiltonian approach, for the joint\nquantum state of photon pairs generated through pulsed spontaneous four-wave\nmixing, including nonlinear phase-modulation and a finite material response\ntime. For the case of a silica fiber, it is found that the pair-production rate\ndepends weakly on the waveguide temperature, due to higher-order Raman\nscattering events, and more strongly on pump-pair frequency detuning. From the\nanalytical model, a numerical scheme is derived, based on the well-known\nsplit-step method. This scheme allows computation of joint states where\nnontrivial effects are included, such as group-velocity dispersion and Raman\nscattering. In this work, the numerical model is used to study the impact of\nthe non-instantaneous response on the pre-filtering purity of heralded single\nphotons. We find that for pump pulses shorter than 1 ps, a significant\ndetuning-dependent change in quantum-mechanical purity may be observed in\nsilica.\n", "  Thermal inflation driven by a scalar field called \"flaton\" is a possible\nscenario to solve the cosmological moduli problem. We study a model of thermal\ninflation with a flaton chemical potential. In the presence of the chemical\npotential, a negative mass squared of the flaton, which is necessary to\nterminate the thermal inflation, is naturally induced. We identify the allowed\nparameter region for the chemical potential ($\\mu$) and the flaton\nself-coupling constant to solve the cosmological moduli problem and satisfy\ntheoretical consistencies. In general, the chemical potential is a free\nparameter and it can be taken to be much larger than the typical scale of soft\nsupersymmetry breaking parameters of $\\mathcal{O} (1)$ TeV. For $\\mu \\gtrsim\n10^8$ GeV, we find that the reheating temperature after the thermal inflation\ncan be high enough for the thermal leptogenesis scenario to be operative. This\nis in sharp contrast to the standard thermal inflation scenario, in which the\nreheating temperature is quite low and a special mechanism is necessary for\ngenerating sufficient amount of baryon asymmetry in the Universe after thermal\ninflation.\n", "  There are a variety of different techniques available to estimate the ages of\npre-main-sequence stars. Components of physical pairs, thanks to their strict\ncoevality and the mass difference, such as the binary system analysed in this\npaper, are best suited to test the effectiveness of these different techniques.\nWe consider the system WW Psa + TX Psa whose membership of the 25-Myr beta\nPictoris association has been well established by earlier works. We investigate\nwhich age dating technique provides the best agreement between the age of the\nsystem and that of the association. We have photometrically monitored WW Psa\nand TX Psa and measured their rotation periods as P = 2.37d and P = 1.086d,\nrespectively. We have retrieved from the literature their Li equivalent widths\nand measured their effective temperatures and luminosities. We investigate\nwhether the ages of these stars derived using three independent techniques are\nconsistent with the age of the beta Pictoris association. We find that the\nrotation periods and the Li contents of both stars are consistent with the\ndistribution of other bona fide members of the cluster. On the contrary, the\nisochronal fitting provides similar ages for both stars, but a factor of about\nfour younger than the quoted age of the association, or about 30% younger when\nthe effects of magnetic fields are included. We explore the origin of the\ndiscrepant age inferred from isochronal fitting, including the possibilities\nthat either the two components may be unresolved binaries or that the basic\nstellar parameters of both components are altered by enhanced magnetic\nactivity. The latter is found to be the more reasonable cause, suggesting that\nage estimates based on the Li content is more reliable than isochronal fitting\nfor pre-main-sequence stars with pronounced magnetic activity.\n", "  I show that a nonequilibrium paraelectric to ferroelectric transition can be\ninduced using midinfrared pulses. This relies on a quartic\n$lQ_{\\textrm{l$_z$}}^2Q_{\\textrm{h$_x$}}^2$ coupling between the lowest\n($Q_{\\textrm{l$_z$}}$) and highest ($Q_{\\textrm{h$_x$}}$) frequency\ninfrared-active phonon modes of a paraelectric material. Density functional\ncalculations show that the coupling constant $l$ is negative, which causes a\nsoftening of the $Q_{\\textrm{l$_z$}}$ mode when the $Q_{\\textrm{h$_x$}}$ mode\nis externally pumped. A rectification along the $Q_{\\textrm{l$_z$}}$ coordinate\nthat stabilizes the nonequilibrium ferroelectric state occurs only above a\ncritical threshold for the electric field of the pump pulse, demonstrating that\nthis is a nonperturbative phenomenon. A first principles calculation of the\ncoupling between light and the $Q_{\\textrm{h$_x$}}$ mode shows that\nferroelectricity can be induced in the representative case of strained KTaO$_3$\nby a midinfrared pulse with a peak electric field of 17 MV cm$^{-1}$ and\nduration of 2 ps. Furthermore, other odd-order nonlinear couplings make it\npossible to arbitrarily switch off the light-induced ferroelectric state,\nmaking this technique feasible for all-optic devices.\n", "  We study a class of $3d$ and $4d$ topological insulators whose topological\nnature is characterized by the Hopf map and its generalizations. We identify\nthe symmetry $\\mathcal{C}^\\prime$, a generalized particle-hole symmetry that\ngives the Hopf insulator a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification. The $4d$ analogue of\nthe Hopf insulator with symmetry $\\mathcal{C}^\\prime$ has the same\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification. The minimal models for the $3d$ and $4d$ Hopf\ninsulator can be heuristically viewed as \"Chern-insulator$ \\rtimes S^1$\" and\n\"Chern-insulator$\\rtimes T^2$\" respectively. We also discuss the relation\nbetween the Hopf insulator and the Weyl semimetals, which points the direction\nfor its possible experimental realization.\n", "  Organic dye molecules have been used in great many scientific and\ntechnological applications, but their wider use in quantum optics has been\nhampered by transitions to short-lived vibrational levels, which limit their\ncoherence properties. To remedy this, one can take advantage of optical\nresonators. Here we present the first results on coherent molecule-resonator\ncoupling, where a single polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule extinguishes\n38\\% of the light entering a microcavity at liquid helium temperature. We also\ndemonstrate four-fold improvement of single-molecule stimulated emission\ncompared to free-space focusing and set the ground for coherent mechanical\nmanipulation of the molecular transition. Our experimental approach based on a\nmicrocavity of low mode volume and low quality factor paves the way for the\nrealization of various nonlinear and collective quantum optical effects with\nmolecules.\n", "  Several sub-diffusive stochastic processes in nature, e.g., motion of tagged\nmonomer in polymers, height fluctuation of interfaces and particle dynamics in\nsingle-file diffusion etc. can be described rigorously or approximately by the\nsuperposition of various modes whose relaxation times are broadly distributed.\nIn this paper, we propose a mode analysis generating super-diffusion, which is\npaired or complementary with that for sub-diffusion. The key point in our\ndiscussion lies in the identification of a pair of conjugated variables, which\nundergoes sub- and super-diffusion, respectively. We provide a simple\ninterpretation for the sub- and superdiffusion duality for these variables\nusing the language of polymer physics. The analysis also suggests the\nusefulness to look at the force fluctuation in experiments, where a polymer is\ndriven by a constant velocity.\n", "  We study the UV divergences in the action of the \"Wheeler-de Witt patch\" in\nasymptotically AdS spacetimes, which has been conjectured to be dual to the\ncomputational complexity of the state of the dual field theory on a spatial\nslice of the boundary. We show that including a surface term in the action on\nthe null boundaries which ensures invariance under coordinate transformations\nhas the additional virtue of removing a stronger than expected divergence,\nmaking the leading divergence proportional to the proper volume of the boundary\nspatial slice. We compare the divergences in the action to divergences in the\nvolume of a maximal spatial slice in the bulk, finding that the qualitative\nstructure is the same, but subleading divergences have different relative\ncoefficients in the two cases.\n", "  In recent work with high-resolution grating spectrometers (RGS) aboard\nXMM-Newton Pinto et al. (2016) have discovered that two bright and archetypal\nultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have strong relativistic winds in agreement\nwith theoretical predictions of high accretion rates. It has been proposed that\nsuch winds can become optically thick enough to block and reprocess the disk\nX-ray photons almost entirely, making the source appear as a soft thermal\nemitter or ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS). To test this hypothesis\nwe have studied a ULX where the wind is strong enough to cause significant\nabsorption of the hard X-ray continuum: NGC 55 ULX. The RGS spectrum of NGC 55\nULX shows a wealth of emission and absorption lines blueshifted by significant\nfractions of the light speed (0.01 - 0.20)c indicating the presence of a\npowerful wind. The wind has a complex dynamical structure with the ionization\nstate increasing with the outflow velocity, which may indicate launching from\ndifferent regions of the accretion disk. The comparison with other ULXs such as\nNGC 1313 X-1 and NGC 5408 X-1 suggests that NGC 55 ULX is being observed at\nhigher inclination. The wind partly absorbs the source flux above 1 keV,\ngenerating a spectral drop similar to that observed in ULSs. The softening of\nthe spectrum at lower (~ Eddington) luminosities and the detection of a soft\nlag agree with the scenario of wind clumps crossing the line of sight, partly\nabsorbing and reprocessing the hard X-rays from the innermost region.\n", "  On April 15, 2016, the Kumamoto earthquake (Mw 7.3) occurred in Japan with no\nwarning signals. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers provide\nuseful information on disturbances in ionosphere by calculating the changes in\nTotal Electron Content (TEC), which is the number of electrons in ionosphere.\nHere we show our recently proposed correlation analysis of TEC data which can\ndetect the pre-seismic ionospheric anomalies from the public GNSS data. Our\nmethod detected the ionospheric anomaly several tens of minutes before the 2016\nKumamoto earthquake near its epicenter. Furthermore, we gave an indicator to\ndistinguish between the pre-seismic TEC anomalies and the medium scale\ntraveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) by calculating the anomalous area\nrates. These results support the hypothesis for existence of the preceding\nphenomena before large earthquakes.\n", "  We use first-principles methods to investigate the effects of collective\nlattice excitations on the formation of oxygen vacancies in perovskite thin\nfilms. We find that phonons play a crucial role on the strain-mediated control\nof defect chemistry at finite temperatures. In particular, zero-temperature\noxygen vacancy formation trends deduced as a function of epitaxial strain can\nbe fully reversed near room temperature. Our first-principles calculations\nevidence a direct link between the lattice contribution to the oxygen vacancy\nfree energy and the volume expansion that the system undergoes when is\nchemically reduced: The larger the resulting volume expansion, the more\nfavorable thermal excitations are to point defect formation. However, the\ninterplay between the vibrational vacancy entropy, or equivalently, chemical\nexpansion, and epitaxial strain is difficult to generalise as this can be\nstrongly influenced by underlying structural and magnetic transitions. In\naddition, we find that vacancy ordering can be largely hindered by the thermal\nlattice excitations.\n", "  Enabling the confinement of light to a scale far below the one of\nconventional optics, surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) induced by an\nelectromagnetic field in a metal-dielectric interface supply an ideal system to\nexplore strong quantized light-matter coupling. The fast matter-SPP population\nexchange reported in previous works makes it a candidate for spin manipulation,\nbut such reversible dynamics asymptotically vanishes accompanying the quantum\nmatter relaxing completely to its ground state. Here, we study the exact\ndissipative dynamics of a quantum emitter (QE) coupled to SPPs. It is\ninteresting to find that, qualitatively different from conventional findings,\nthe QE can be partially stabilized in its excited state even in the presence of\nthe lossy metal. Our analysis reveals that it is the formation of a QE-SPP\nbound state which results in such suppressed dissipation. Enriching the\ndecoherence dynamics of the QE in the lossy medium, our result is helpful to\nunderstand QE-SPP interactions and apply plasmonic nanostructures in quantum\ndevices.\n", "  We investigate the influence of intrinsic noise on stable states of a\none-dimensional dynamical system that shows in its deterministic version a\nsaddle-node bifurcation between monostable and bistable behaviour. The system\nis a modified version of the Schl\\\"ogl model, which is a chemical reaction\nsystem with only one type of molecule. The strength of the intrinsic noise is\nvaried without changing the deterministic description by introducing bursts in\nthe autocatalytic production step. We study the transitions between monostable\nand bistable behavior in this system by evaluating the number of maxima of the\nstationary probability distribution. We find that changing the size of bursts\ncan destroy and even induce saddle-node bifurcations. This means that a bursty\nproduction of molecules can qualitatively change the dynamics of a chemical\nreaction system even when the deterministic description remains unchanged.\n", "  Pion energy spectra are presented for central collisions of neutron-rich\n132Sn+124Sn and neutron-deficient 108Sn+112Sn systems using simulations with\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model. These calculations, which\nincorporate isospin-dependent mean field potentials for relevant baryons and\nmesons, display a sensitivity to the pion spectra that could allow significant\nconstraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy and its mean field\npotential at supra-saturation densities. The predicted sensitivity increases\nwith the isospin asymmetry of the total system and decreases with incident\nenergy.\n", "  Mercury is expected to deviate from the classical Cassini state since this\nstate is defined for a uniformly precessing rigid planet. We develop an\nextended Cassini state model that includes the variations (or nutations) in\nobliquity and deviation induced by the slow precession of the pericenter. The\nmodel also describes the constant shift over time in mean obliquity and\ndeviation associated with the short-periodic tidal deformations of Mercury,\ncharacterized by the tidal love number k2 and by the ratio k2/Q of the tidal\nLove number over the tidal quality factor, respectively. This model is then\nused to interpret Mercury's orientation, including the deviation from the\nclassical Cassini state, in terms of parameters of Mercury's interior.\n  We determine and solve analytically the angular momentum equation,\nhighlighting the respective roles of the pericenter precession and tidal\ndeformations on the spin precession behavior. We also show explicitly that\nPeale's equation is sometimes wrongly cited in the literature, resulting in\nwrong estimates of the polar moment of inertia, and review the importance of\nmany effects that change the determination of the polar moment of inertia from\nobliquity measurements.\n  From the observed orientation of Stark et al. (2015b), we estimate that\nC/MR^2=0.3434+/-0.0102, which is ~0.9% smaller than the estimate by Stark et\nal. (2015b) themselves. That difference is due to our refinements of the\nCassini state model (0.1%) and to their wrong use of Peale's equation (0.8%).\nThe difference is smaller than the actual precision (3-4%) on the polar moment\nof inertia but may be of the order of precision that can be reached with\nBepiColombo mission (<=0.3%).\n", "  Recent experimental advances in the cooling and manipulation of bialkali\ndimer molecules have enabled the production of gases of ultracold molecules\nthat are not chemically reactive. It has been presumed in the literature that\nin the absence of an electric field the low-energy scattering of such\nnonreactive molecules (NRMs) will be similar to atoms, in which a single\n$s$-wave scattering length governs the collisional physics. However, in Ref.\n[1], it was argued that the short-range collisional physics of NRMs is much\nmore complex than for atoms, and that this leads to a many-body description in\nterms of a multi-channel Hubbard model. In this work, we show that this\nmulti-channel Hubbard model description of NRMs in an optical lattice is robust\nagainst the approximations employed in Ref. [1] to estimate its parameters. We\ndo so via an exact, albeit formal, derivation of a multi-channel resonance\nmodel for two NRMs from an ab initio description of the molecules in terms of\ntheir constituent atoms. We discuss the regularization of this two-body\nmulti-channel resonance model in the presence of a harmonic trap, and how its\nsolutions form the basis for the many-body model of Ref. [1]. We also\ngeneralize the derivation of the effective lattice model to include multiple\ninternal states (e.g., rotational or hyperfine). We end with an outlook to\nfuture research.\n", "  We calculate the parameters of the recently-derived many-channel Hubbard\nmodel that is predicted to describe ultracold nonreactive molecules in an\noptical lattice, going beyond the approximations used in Do\\c{c}aj \\textit{et\nal.}~[Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{116}, 135301 (2016)]. Although those\napproximations are expected to capture the qualitative structure of the model\nparameters, finer details and quantitative values are less certain. To set\nexpectations for experiments, whose results depend on the model parameters, we\ndescribe the approximations' regime of validity and the likelihood that\nexperiments will be in this regime, discuss the impact that the failure of\nthese approximations would have on the predicted model, and develop theories\ngoing beyond these approximations. Not only is it necessary to know the model\nparameters in order to describe experiments, but the connection that we\nelucidate between these parameters and the underlying assumptions that are used\nto derive them will allow molecule experiments to probe new physics. For\nexample, transition state theory, which is used across chemistry and chemical\nphysics, plays a key role in our determination of lattice parameters, thus\nconnecting its physical assumptions to highly accurate experimental\ninvestigation.\n", "  Self-propelled particles with hydrodynamic interactions (microswimmers) have\npreviously been shown to produce long-range ordering phenomena. Many\ntheoretical explanations for these collective phenomena are connected to\ninstabilities in the hydrodynamic or kinetic equations. By incorporating\nstochastic fluxes into the mean field kinetic equation, we quantify the\ndynamics of a suspension of microswimmers in the parameter regime where the\ndeterministic equation is stable. We can thereby compute nontrivial collective\nphenomena concerning spatial correlations of orientation and stress as well as\nthe enhanced diffusion of tracer particles. Our analysis here focuses primarily\non two-dimensional systems, though we also show how superdiffusion of tracers\nin three dimensions can occur by our framework.\n", "  Outflows in active galaxies (AGNs) are common, although their launching\nmechanism, location, and physical impact on the host galaxy remain\ncontroversial. We conducted a multiwavelength six-month campaign to observe the\nnearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 with several observatories in order to better\nunderstand and quantify the outflow in this AGN. We report on the\ntime-integrated line-resolved X-ray spectrum of NGC 7469 obtained with the\nReflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on board XMM-Newton. We use the RGS\nspectrum to discern the many AGN outflow components. A global fit is applied to\nobtain their physical parameters. We find that the AGN wind can be well\ndescribed by three narrow velocity components at -650, -950, and -2050 km/s.\nThe RGS clearly resolves the -20 50 km/s component in C5+ Ly$\\alpha$, while the\n-650 km/s and -950 km/s velocities are blended. Similar velocities are resolved\nin the UV. The H-equivalent column densities of these components are,\nrespectively, NH = 7x10^20, 2.2x10^21, and 10^20 cm^-2, for a total of 3x10^21\ncm^-2. The -650 km/s component shows a broad ionisation distribution. We\nidentify a photo-ionised emission component blue-shifted by -450 km/s which we\nascribe to the same outflow that produces the absorption lines. The elemental\nabundance ratios of C, N, Ne, S, and Fe to O in the outflow tend to be between\n1 - 2 times solar. Preliminary estimates of the absorber distance from the AGN\ncenter suggest it is at least a few pc away from the center, but more advanced\nmethods need to be applied in order to obtain better constraints. The complex\nX-ray spectrum of NGC 7469 demonstrates the richness of high energy phenomena\ntaking place in AGN cores. The subtle spectroscopic differences between the\nvarious components require deep, high-resolution observations, such as the\npresent RGS spectrum, if one is to resolve them and perform quantitative plasma\ndiagnostics.\n", "  Dust modeling is crucial to infer dust properties and budget for galaxy\nstudies. However, there are systematic disparities between dust grain models\nthat result in corresponding systematic differences in the inferred dust\nproperties of galaxies. Quantifying these systematics requires a consistent\nfitting analysis. We compare the output dust parameters and assess the\ndifferences between two dust grain models, Compiegne et al (2011), and THEMIS\n(Jones et al 2013, Kohler et al 2015). In this study, we use a single fitting\nmethod applied to all the models to extract a coherent and unique statistical\nanalysis. We fit the models to the dust emission seen by Spitzer and Herschel\nin the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC). The observations cover\nthe infrared (IR) spectrum from a few microns to the sub-millimeter range. For\neach fitted pixel, we calculate the full n-D likelihood, based on the method\ndescribed in Gordon et al (2014). The free parameters are both environmental\n($U$, the interstellar radiation field strength; $\\alpha_\\mathrm{ISRF}$,\npower-law coefficient for a multi-U environment; $\\Omega^*$, the starlight\nstrength) and intrinsic to the model ($Y_\\mathrm{i}$: abundances of the grain\nspecies $i$; $\\alpha_\\mathrm{sCM20}$, coefficient in the small carbon grain\nsize distribution). Fractional residuals of 5 different sets of parameters show\nthat fitting THEMIS brings a more accurate reproduction of the observations\nthan the Compiegne model. However, independent variations of the dust species\nshow strong model-dependencies. We find that the abundance of silicates can\nonly be constrained to an upper-limit and the silicate/carbon ratio is\ndifferent than that seen in our Galaxy. In the LMC, our fits result in dust\nmasses slightly lower than those found in literature , by a factor lower than\n2. In the SMC, we find dust masses in agreement with previous studies.\n", "  We discuss the properties of non-abelian gauge theories formulated on\nmanifolds with compactified dimensions and in the presence of fermionic fields\ncoupled to magnetic backgrounds. We show that different phases may emerge,\ncorresponding to different realizations of center symmetry and translational\ninvariance, depending on the compactification radius and on the magnitude of\nthe magnetic field. Our discussion focuses on the case of an $SU(3)$ gauge\ntheory in 4 dimensions with fermions fields in the fundamental representation,\nfor which we provide some exploratory numerical lattice results.\n", "  We study the overdamped sedimentation of non-Brownian objects of irregular\nshape using fluctuating hydrodynamics. The anisotropic response of the objects\nto flow, caused by their tendency to align with gravity, directly suppresses\nconcentration and velocity fluctuations. This allows the suspension to avoid\nthe anomalous fluctuations predicted for suspensions of symmetric spheroids.\nThe suppression of concentration fluctuations leads to a correlated,\nhyperuniform structure. For certain object shapes, the anisotropic response may\nact in the opposite direction, destabilizing uniform sedimentation.\n", "  The Kepler space telescope yielded unprecedented data for the study of\nsolar-like oscillations in other stars. The large samples of multi-year\nobservations posed an enormous data analysis challenge that has only recently\nbeen surmounted. Asteroseismic modeling has become more sophisticated over\ntime, with better methods gradually developing alongside the extended\nobservations and improved data analysis techniques. We apply the latest version\nof the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP) to the full-length Kepler data sets\nfor 57 stars and the Sun, comprising planetary hosts, binaries, solar-analogs,\nand active stars. From an analysis of the derived stellar properties for the\nfull sample, we identify a variation of the mixing-length parameter with\natmospheric properties. We also derive a linear relation between the stellar\nage and a characteristic frequency separation ratio. In addition, we find that\nthe empirical correction for surface effects suggested by Kjeldsen and\ncoworkers is adequate for solar-type stars that are not much hotter (Teff <\n6200 K) or significantly more evolved (logg > 4.2, <Delta_nu> > 80 muHz) than\nthe Sun. Precise parallaxes from the Gaia mission and future observations from\nTESS and PLATO promise to improve the reliability of stellar properties derived\nfrom asteroseismology.\n", "  The Mott insulator is characterized by having small deviations around the\n(integer) average particle density n, with pairs with n-1 and n+1 particles\nforming bound states. In one dimension, the effect is captured by a non-zero\nvalue of a non-local \"string\" of parities, which instead vanishes in the\nsuperfluid phase where density fluctuations are large. Here, we investigate the\ninteraction induced transition from the superfluid to the Mott insulator, in\nthe paradigmatic Bose Hubbard model at n=1. By means of quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations and finite size scaling analysis on LxM ladders, we explore the\nbehavior of \"brane\" parity operators for L going to infinity from one dimension\n(i.e., M=1) to two dimensions (i.e., M going to infinity). We confirm the\nconjecture that, adopting a standard definition, their average value decays to\nzero in two dimensions also in the insulating phase, evaluating the scaling\nfactor of the \"perimeter law\" [S.P. Rath et al., Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 334, 256\n(2013)]. Upon introducing a further phase in the brane parity, we show that its\nexpectation value becomes non-zero in the insulator, while still vanishing at\nthe transition to the superfluid phase. These quantities are directly\naccessible to experimental measures, thus providing an insightful signature of\nthe Mott insulator.\n", "  In this paper we analyse non-supersymmetric single centred extremal black\nhole solutions in N=2 supergravity theory coupled to $n$ vector multiplets with\npurely cubic pre-potential in four dimensions. We consider the algebraic\nattractor equations in their most general form at the black hole horizon. We\nexplicitly construct a new class of solutions for these attractor equations.\nThese solutions are characterised by a set of involutory matrices. These\ninvolutions are obtained from a constraint involving the parameters in the\npre-potential and generate new attractor points in the moduli space.\n", "  In this work, we extend previous analyses of the structure formation in the\n$f(\\Box^{-1}R)$ model of nonlocal gravity proposed by Deser and Woodard (DW),\nwhich reproduces the background expansion of $\\Lambda$CDM with no need of a\ncosmological constant nor of any dimensional constant beside Newton's one. A\nprevious analysis based on redshift-space distortions (RSD) data concluded that\nthe model was ruled out. In this work we revisit the issue and find that, when\nrecast in a localized model, the DW model is not ruled out and actually gives a\nbetter fit to RSD data than $\\Lambda$CDM. At the same time, the model predicts\na slightly lower value of $\\sigma_{8}$ than $\\Lambda$CDM, in agreement with\nrecent estimates based on lensing. We also produce analytical approximations of\nthe two modified gravity functions and of $f\\sigma_{8}(z)$ as a function of\nredshift. Finally, we also show how much the fit depends on initial conditions\nwhen these are generalized with respect to a standard matter-dominated era.\n", "  Lorentz invariance is the fundamental symmetry of Einstein's theory of\nspecial relativity, and has been tested to great level of detail. However,\ntheories of quantum gravity at the Planck scale indicate that Lorentz symmetry\nmay be broken at that scale motivating further tests. While the Planck energy\nis currently unreachable by experiment, tiny residual effects at attainable\nenergies can become measurable when photons propagate over sufficiently large\ndistances. The Standard-Model Extension (SME) is an effective field theory\napproach to describe low-energy effects of quantum gravity theories. Lorentz\nand CPT symmetry violating effects are introduced by adding additional terms to\nthe Standard Model Lagrangian. These terms can be ordered by the mass dimension\nof the corresponding operator, and the leading terms of interest have dimension\nd = 5. Effects of these operators are a linear variation of the speed of light\nwith photon energy, and a rotation of the linear polarization of photons\nquadratic in photon energy, as well as anisotropy. We analyzed optical\npolarization data from 72 AGN and GRBs and derived the first set of limits on\nall 16 coefficients of mass dimension d = 5 of the SME photon sector. Our\nconstraints imply a lower limit on the energy scale of quantum gravity of\n$10^6$ times the Planck energy, severly limiting the phase space for any theory\nthat predicts a rotation of the photon polarization quadratic in energy.\n", "  We propose a model which accounts for the dynamical origin of the electroweak\nsymmetry breaking (EWSB), directly linking to the mass generation of dark\nmatter (DM) candidate and active neutrinos. The standard model (SM) is weakly\ncharged under the $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ gauge symmetry, in conjunction with newly\nintroduced three right-handed Majorana neutrinos and the $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$\nHiggs. The model is built on the classical scale invariance, that is\ndynamically broken by a new strongly coupled sector, what is called the\nhypercolor (HC) sector, which is also weakly coupled to the $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$\ngauge. At the HC strong scale, the simultaneous breaking of the EW and\n$U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ gauge symmetries is triggered by dynamically induced multiple\nseesaw mechanisms, namely bosonic seesaw mechanisms. Thus, all the origins of\nmasses are provided singly by the HC dynamics: that is what we call the\ndynamical scalegenesis. We also find that an HC baryon, with mass on the order\nof a few TeV, can be stabilized by the HC baryon number and the $U(1)_{\\rm\nB-L}$ charge, so identified as a DM candidate. The relic abundance of the\nHC-baryon DM can be produced dominantly via the bosonic-seesaw portal process,\nand the HC-baryon DM can be measured through the large magnetic moment coupling\ngenerated from the HC dynamics, or the $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$-gauge boson portal in\ndirect detection experiments.\n", "  In this paper, we study phase diagrams of the extended Bose-Hubbard model\n(EBHM) in one dimension by means of the quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulation\nusing the stochastic-series expansion (SSE).In the EBHM, there exists a\nnearest-neighbor repulsion as well as the on-site repulsion. In the SSE-QMC\nsimulation, the highest particle number at each site, $n_c$, is also a\ncontrollable parameter, and we found that the phase diagrams depend on the\nvalue of $n_c$. It is shown that in addition to the Mott insulator, superfluid,\ndensity wave, the phase so-called Haldane insulator and supersolid appear in\nthe phase diagrams, and their locations in the phase diagrams are clarified.\n", "  Previous studies show that the physical structures and kinematics of a region\ndepend significantly on the ionisation fraction. In this paper, we extend our\nprevious studies of the effect of ionisation fractions on star formation to\nclouds that include both non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics and turbulence. We aim\nto quantify the importance of a treatment of the ionisation fraction in\nturbulent magnetised media and investigate the effect of turbulence on shaping\nthe clouds and filaments before star formation sets in. In particular, we\ninvestigate how the structure, mass and width of filamentary structures depend\non the amount of turbulence in ionised media and the initial mass-to-flux\nratio. We compare the resulting density and mass-to-flux ratio structures both\nqualitatively and quantitatively via filament and core masses and filament\nfitting techniques (Gaussian and Plummer profiles.) We find that even with\nalmost no turbulence, filamentary structure still exists. Comparison of\nsimulations show that for turbulent Mach numbers above 2, there is little\nstructural difference between the Step-Like (SL) and Cosmic Ray only (CR-only)\nionisation models, while below this threshold the ionisation structure\nsignificantly affects the formation of filaments. Analysis of the mass within\ncores and filaments show decrease in mass as the degree of turbulence\nincreases. Finally, observed filaments within the Taurus L1495/B213 complex are\nbest reproduced by models with supercritical mass-to-flux ratios and/or at\nleast mildly supersonic turbulence, however, our models show that sterile\nfibres observed within Taurus may occur in highly ionised, subcritical\nenvironments. Based on this, we suggest that regions with fertile fibres likely\nindicate a trans- or supercritical mass-to-flux ratio within the region while\nsterile fibres are likely subcritical and transient.\n", "  In Quantum Private Query (QPQ), a client obtains values corresponding to his\nquery only and nothing else from the server and the server does not get any\ninformation about the queries. Giovannetti et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008) gave\nthe first QPQ protocol and since then quite a few variants and extensions have\nbeen proposed. However, none of the existing protocols are device independent,\ni.e., all of them assume implicitly that the entangled states supplied to the\nclient and the server are as prescribed. In this work, we exploit the idea of\nlocal CHSH game and connect it with the scheme of Yang et al. (Quantum Inf.\nProcess., 2014) to present the concept of device independent QPQ protocol for\nthe first time.\n", "  We investigate the connection between the star formation rate (SFR) of\ngalaxies and their central black hole accretion rate (BHAR) using the EAGLE\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We find, in striking concurrence with\nrecent observational studies, that the <SFR>--BHAR relation for an AGN selected\nsample produces a relatively flat trend, whilst the <BHAR>--SFR relation for a\nSFR selected sample yields an approximately linear trend. These trends remain\nconsistent with their instantaneous equivalents even when both SFR and BHAR are\ntime-averaged over a period of 100~Myr. There is no universal relationship\nbetween the two growth rates. Instead, SFR and BHAR evolve through distinct\npaths that depend strongly on the mass of the host dark matter halo. The\ngalaxies hosted by haloes of mass M200 $\\lesssim 10^{11.5}$Msol grow steadily,\nyet black holes (BHs) in these systems hardly grow, yielding a lack of\ncorrelation between SFR and BHAR. As haloes grow through the mass range\n$10^{11.5} \\lesssim$ M200 $\\lesssim 10^{12.5 }$Msol BHs undergo a rapid phase\nof non-linear growth. These systems yield a highly non-linear correlation\nbetween the SFR and BHAR, which are non-causally connected via the mass of the\nhost halo. In massive haloes (M200 $\\gtrsim 10^{12.5}$Msol) both SFR and BHAR\ndecline on average with a roughly constant scaling of SFR/BHAR $\\sim 10^{3}$.\nGiven the complexity of the full SFR--BHAR plane built from multiple\nbehaviours, and from the large dynamic range of BHARs, we find the primary\ndriver of the different observed trends in the <SFR>--BHAR and <BHAR>--SFR\nrelationships are due to sampling considerably different regions of this plane.\n", "  Colliding stellar winds in massive binary systems have been studied through\ntheir radio, optical lines and strong X-ray emission for decades. More\nrecently, near-infrared spectrointerferometric observations have become\navailable in a few systems, but isolating the contribution from the individual\nstars and the wind collision region still remains a challenge. In this paper,\nwe study the colliding wind binary gamma2 Velorum and aim at identifying the\nwind collision zone from infrared interferometric data, which provide unique\nspatial information to determine the wind properties. Our analysis is based on\nmulti-epoch VLTI/AMBER data that allows us to separate the spectral components\nof both stars. First, we determine the astrometric solution of the binary and\nconfirm previous distance measurements. We then analyse the spectra of the\nindividual stars, showing that the O star spectrum is peculiar within its\nclass. Then, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the\nsystem from which we extract model images, visibility curves and closure phases\nwhich can be directly compared with the observed data. The hydrodynamic\nsimulations reveal the 3D spiral structure of the wind collision region, which\nresults in phase-dependent emission maps. Our model visibility curves and\nclosure phases provide a good match when the wind collision region accounts for\n3 to 10 per cent of the total flux in the near infrared. The dialogue between\nhydrodynamic simulations, radiative transfer models and observations allows us\nto fully exploit the observations. Similar efforts will be crucial to study\ncircumstellar environments with the new generation of VLTI instruments like\nGRAVITY and MATISSE.\n", "  Quantum search on the two-dimensional lattice with one marked vertex and\ncyclic boundary conditions is an important problem in the context of quantum\nalgorithms with an interesting unfolding. It avails to test the ability of\nquantum walk models to provide efficient algorithms from the theoretical side\nand means to implement quantum walks in laboratories from the practical side.\nIn this paper, we rigorously prove that the recent-proposed staggered quantum\nwalk model provides an efficient quantum search on the two-dimensional lattice,\nif the reflection operators associated with the graph tessellations are used as\nHamiltonians, which is an important theoretical result for validating the\nstaggered model with Hamiltonians. Numerical results show that on the\ntwo-dimensional lattice staggered models without Hamiltonians are not as\nefficient as the one described in this paper and are, in fact, as slow as\nclassical random-walk-based algorithms.\n", "  The progenitors of high-mass stars and clusters are still challenging to\nrecognise. Only unbiased surveys, sensitive to compact regions of high dust\ncolumn density, can unambiguously reveal such a small population of\nparticularly massive and cold clumps. Here we study a flux limited sample of\ncompact sources from the ATLASGAL survey to identify a sample of candidate\nprogenitors of massive clusters in the inner Galaxy. Sensitive mid-infrared\ndata at 21-24 $\\mu$m from the WISE and MIPSGAL surveys were explored to search\nfor embedded objects, and complementary spectroscopic data were used to\ninvestigate their stability and star formation activity. Based on such\nancillary data we identify an unbiased sample of infrared-quiet massive clumps\nin the Galaxy that potentially represent the earliest stages of massive cluster\nformation. An important fraction of this sample consists of sources that have\nnot been studied in detail before. Comparing their properties to clumps hosting\nmore evolved embedded objects, we find that they exhibit similar physical\nproperties in terms of mass and size, suggesting that infrared-quiet massive\nclumps are not only capable of forming high-mass stars, but likely also follow\na single evolutionary track leading to the formation of massive clusters. The\nmajority of the sources are not in virial-equilibrium, suggesting collapse on\nthe clump scale. This is in line with the low number of infrared-quiet massive\nclumps and earlier findings that star formation, in particular for high-mass\nobjects is a fast, dynamic process. We propose a scenario in which massive\nclumps start to fragment and collapse before their final mass is accumulated\nindicating that strong self-gravity and global collapse is needed to build up\nrich clusters and the most massive stars.\n", "  Context. The distribution of elements in galaxies forms an important\ndiagnostic tool to characterize the system's formation and evolution. This tool\nis however complex to use in practice, as galaxies are subject to a range of\nsimultaneous physical processes active from pc to kpc scales. This renders\nobservations of the full optical extent of galaxies down to sub-kpc scales\nessential. Aims. Using the WiFeS integral field spectrograph, we previously\ndetected abrupt and localized variations in the gas-phase oxygen abundance of\nthe spiral galaxy HCG91c. Here, we follow-up on these observations to map\nHCG91c's disk out to ~2Re at a resolution of 600pc, and characterize the\nnon-radial variations of the gas-phase oxygen abundance in the system. Methods.\nWe obtained deep MUSE observations of the target under ~0.6 arcsec seeing\nconditions. We perform both a spaxel-based and aperture-based analysis of the\ndata to map the spatial variations of 12+log(O/H) across the disk of the\ngalaxy. Results. We confirm the presence of rapid variations of the oxygen\nabundance across the entire extent of the galaxy previously detected with\nWiFeS, for all azimuths and radii. The variations can be separated in two\ncategories: a) localized and associated with individual HII regions, and b)\nextended over kpc scales, and occurring at the boundaries of the spiral\nstructures in the galaxy. Conclusions. Our MUSE observations suggest that the\nenrichment of the interstellar medium in HGC91c has proceeded preferentially\nalong spiral structures, and less efficiently across them. Our dataset\nhighlights the importance of distinguishing individual star-forming regions\ndown to scales of a few 100pc when using integral field spectrographs to\nspatially resolve the distribution of oxygen abundances in a given system, and\naccurately characterize azimuthal variations and intrinsic scatter.\n", "  In this paper we address the derivation of causal relativistic hydrodynamics,\nformulated within the framework of Divergence Type Theories (DTTs), from\nkinetic theory for spinless particles obeying Fermi-Dirac statistics. The\napproach leads to expressions for the particle current and energy momentum\ntensor that are formally divergent, but may be given meaning through a process\nof regularization and renormalization. We demonstrate the procedure through an\nanalysis of the stability of an homogeneous anisotropic configuration. In the\nDTT framework, as in kinetic theory, these configurations are stable. By\ncontrast, hydrodynamics as derived from the Grad approximation would predict\nthat highly anisotropic configurations are unstable.\n", "  We explore properties of Type Ib and IIb SN progenitors that are produced by\nstable mass transfer in binary systems, using a new grid of stellar evolution\nmodels from an initial primary mass in the range of 10 - 18 $\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$\nat solar and Large Magellanic Cloud metallicities. We find that blue and yellow\nsupergiant SN IIb progenitors (e.g., of SN 2008ax, SN 2011dh, SN 2016gkg) have\na hydrogen envelope mass less than about 0.15 $\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, mostly\nresulting from early Case B mass transfer with relatively low initial masses\nand/or low metallicity. Red supergiant (RSG) SN IIb progenitors (e.g., of SN\n1993J, SN 2013df) are produced via late Case B mass transfer and have a more\nmassive hydrogen envelope ($M_\\mathrm{H,env} > 0.15~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$). SN Ib\nprogenitors are predominantly produced by early Case B mass transfer. Our\nmodels predict that SN IIb progenitors are systematically more luminous in the\noptical ($-8.0 \\lesssim M_\\mathrm{V} \\lesssim -5.0$) than the majority of SN Ib\nprogenitors ($M_\\mathrm{V} \\gtrsim -5.0$) for our considered initial mass\nrange. However, the optically bright progenitor of SN Ib iPTF13bvn (i.e.,\n$M_\\mathrm{V} \\simeq -6.5$) can be well explained by a relatively low-mass\nprogenitor with a final mass of $\\sim 3.0~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. The event rate of\nblue and yellow SN IIb progenitors would increase as metallicity decreases,\nwhile the event rate of SN Ib progenitors would decrease instead. By contrast,\nthe population of RSG SN IIb progenitors would not be significantly affected by\nmetallicity.\n", "  We investigate the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in quantum dissipative\nsystems by employing a hierarchical equations of motion approach which is\nbeyond the usual Markovian approximation, the rotating wave approximation, and\nthe perturbative approximation. The quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno dynamics of a\nbiased qubit-boson model and a biased qutrit-boson model are provided as\nillustrative examples. It is found that (i) there exists multiple\nZeno-anti-Zeno crossover phenomena, (ii) the non-Markovian characteristic of\nthe bath may be favorable for the accessibility of the Zeno dynamics, and (iii)\nhigh bath temperature may add the difficulty in observing the quantum Zeno\neffect in quantum dissipative systems.\n", "  By introducing loss to one sublattice of a dimer chain described by the\nextended Aubry-Andr\\'e or Harper (AAH) model, we study the topological features\nincluding the edge states, spectrum and winding number of the chain. We find\nthat the parameter region for the system to have real band-gap-closing is\nincreased due to the loss, and the average displacement of the single\nexcitation can still witness the topological features of the chain in the\npresence of loss. The robustness of the zero energy eigenstate against four\nkinds of disorders is also examined. A feasible experiment setup based on\ncoupled waveguides to observe the prediction of this paper is proposed.\n", "  A Fermi-liquid (FL) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) supports a special type of\ncollective modes--chiral spin waves--which are oscillations of magnetization\neven in the absence of the external magnetic field. We study the chiral spin\nwaves of a two-dimensional FL in the presence of both the Rashba and\nDresselhaus types of SOC and also subject to the in-plane magnetic field. We\nmap the system of coupled kinetic equations for the angular harmonics of the\noccupation number onto an effective one-dimensional tight-binding model, in\nwhich the lattice sites correspond to angular-momentum channels.\nLinear-in-momentum SOC ensures that the effective tight-binding model has only\nnearest-neighbor hopping on a bipartite lattice. In this language, the\ncontinuum of spin-flip particle-hole excitations becomes a conduction band of\nthe lattice model, whereas electron-electron interaction, parameterized by the\nharmonics of the Landau function, is mapped onto lattice defects of both\non-site and bond type. Collective modes correspond to bound states formed by\nsuch defects. All the features of the collective-mode spectrum receive natural\nexplanation in the lattice picture as resulting from the competition between\non-site and bond defects.\n", "  The task of finding the smallest energy needed to bring a solid to its onset\nof mechanical instability arises in many problems in materials science, from\nthe determination of the elasticity limit to the consistent assignment of free\nenergies to mechanically unstable phases. However, unless the space of possible\ndeformations is low-dimensional and a priori known, this problem is numerically\ndifficult, as it involves minimizing a function under a constraint on its\nHessian, which is computionally prohibitive to obtain in low symmetry systems,\nespecially if electronic structure calculations are used. We propose a method\nthat is inspired by the well-known dimer method for saddle point searches but\nthat adds the necessary ingredients to solve for the lowest onset of mechanical\ninstability. The method consists of two nested optimization problems. The inner\none involves a dimer-like construction to find the direction of smallest\ncurvature as well as the gradient of this curvature function. The outer\noptimization then minimizes energy using the result of the inner optimization\nproblem to constrain the search to the hypersurface enclosing all points of\nzero minimum curvature. Example applications to both model systems and\nelectronic structure calculations are given.\n", "  We analyze entanglement and nonlocal properties of the convex set of\nsymmetric $N$-qubits states which are diagonal in the Dicke basis. First, we\ndemonstrate that within this set, positivity of partial transposition (PPT) is\nnecessary and sufficient for separability --- which has also been reported\nrecently in https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.060101 {Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{94}, 060101(R) (2016)}. Further, we show which states among the\nentangled DS are nonlocal under two-body Bell inequalities. The diagonal\nsymmetric convex set contains a simple and extended family of states that\nviolate the weak Peres conjecture, being PPT with respect to one partition but\nviolating a Bell inequality in such partition. Our method opens new directions\nto address entanglement and non-locality on higher dimensional symmetric\nstates, where presently very few results are available.\n", "  The electronic structure of \\graySn(001) thin films strained compressively\nin-plane was studied both experimentally and theoretically. A new topological\nsurface state (TSS) located entirely within the gapless projected bulk bands is\nrevealed by \\textit{ab initio}-based tight-binding calculations as well as\ndirectly accessed by soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission. The topological\ncharacter of this state, which is a surface resonance, is confirmed by\nunravelling the band inversion and by calculating the topological invariants.\nIn agreement with experiment, electronic structure calculations show the\nmaximum density of states in the subsurface region, while the already\nestablished TSS near the Fermi level is strongly localized at the surface. Such\nvaried behavior is explained by the differences in orbital composition between\nthe specific TSS and its associated bulk states, respectively. This provides an\norbital protection mechanism for topological states against mixing with the\nbackground of bulk bands.\n", "  We show that the application of circularly polarized electromagnetic\nradiation on the surface of a Weyl semi-metal can generate states at that\nsurface. These states can be characterized by their surface momentum. The\nFloquet eigenvalues of these states come in complex conjugate pairs rather than\nbeing equal to $\\pm 1$. If the amplitude of the radiation is small, we find\nsome unusual bulk-boundary relations: the Floquet eigenvalues of the surface\nstates lie at the extrema of the Floquet eigenvalues of the bulk system, and\nthe peaks of the Fourier transforms of the surface state wave functions lie at\nthe momenta where the bulk Floquet eigenvalues have extrema. For the case of\nzero surface momentum, we can analytically derive scaling relations between the\ndecay length of the surface states and the amplitude and penetration length of\nthe radiation. For topological insulators, we again find that circularly\npolarized radiation can generate states on the surfaces; these states have much\nlarger decay lengths than the surface states which are present even in the\nabsence of radiation. Finally, we show that radiation can generate surface\nstates for trivial insulators also.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the possibility of interpreting two nucleon\nresonances, the $N(1875)$ and the $N(2100)$, as hadronic molecular states from\nthe $\\Sigma^*K$ and $\\Sigma K^*$ interactions, respectively. With the help of\neffective Lagrangians in which coupling constants are determined by the SU(3)\nsymmetry, the $\\Sigma^*K$ and $\\Sigma K^*$ interactions are described by the\nvector-meson and pseudoscalar-meson exchanges. With the one-boson-exchange\npotential obtained, bound states from the $\\Sigma^*K$ and $\\Sigma K^*$\ninteractions are searched for in a quasipotential Bethe-Saltpeter equation\napproach. A bound state with quantum number $I(J^P)=1/2(3/2^-)$ is produced\nfrom the $\\Sigma^*K$ interaction, which can be identified as the $N(1875)$\nlisted in PDG. It can be seen as a strange partner of the LHCb pentaquark\n$P_c(4380)$ with the same quantum numbers in the molecular state picture. The\n$\\Sigma K^*$ interaction also produces a bound state with quantum number\n$I(J^P)=1/2(3/2^-)$, which is related to experimentally observed $N(2100)$ in\nthe $\\phi$ photoproduction. Our results suggest that the $N(2120)$ observed in\nthe $K\\Lambda(1520)$ photoproduction and the $N(2100)$ observed in the $\\phi$\nphotoproduction have different origins. The former is a conventional\nthree-quark state while the latter is a $\\Sigma K^*$ molecular state, which can\nbe seen as a strange partner of the $P_c(4450)$ with different spin parity.\n", "  By applying chiral-perturbation-theory methods to the QCD sector of the\nLorentz-violating Standard-Model Extension, we investigate Lorentz violation in\nthe strong interactions. In particular, we consider the CPT-even pure-gluon\noperator of the minimal Standard-Model Extension. We construct the lowest-order\nchiral effective Lagrangian for three as well as two light quark flavors. We\ndevelop the power-counting rules and construct the heavy-baryon\nchiral-perturbation-theory Lagrangian, which we use to calculate\nLorentz-violating contributions to the nucleon self energy. Using the\nconstructed effective operators, we derive the first stringent limits on many\nof the components of the relevant Lorentz-violating parameter. We also obtain\nthe Lorentz-violating nucleon-nucleon potential. We suggest that this potential\nmay be used to obtain new limits from atomic-clock or deuteron storage-ring\nexperiments.\n", "  N-methylformamide, CH3NHCHO, may be an important molecule for interstellar\npre-biotic chemistry because it contains a peptide bond. The rotational\nspectrum of the most stable trans conformer of CH3NHCHO is complicated by\nstrong torsion-rotation interaction due to the low barrier of the methyl\ntorsion. We use two absorption spectrometers in Kharkiv and Lille to measure\nthe rotational spectra over 45--630 GHz. The analysis is carried out using the\nRho-axis method and the RAM36 code. We search for N-methylformamide toward the\nhot molecular core Sgr B2(N2) using a spectral line survey carried out with\nALMA. The astronomical results are put into a broader astrochemical context\nwith the help of a gas-grain chemical kinetics model. The laboratory data set\nfor the trans conformer of CH3NHCHO consists of 9469 line frequencies with J <=\n62, including the first assignment of the rotational spectra of the first and\nsecond excited torsional states. All these lines are fitted within experimental\naccuracy. We report the tentative detection of CH3NHCHO towards Sgr B2(N2). We\nfind CH3NHCHO to be more than one order of magnitude less abundant than NH2CHO,\na factor of two less abundant than CH3NCO, but only slightly less abundant than\nCH3CONH2. The chemical models indicate that the efficient formation of HNCO via\nNH + CO on grains is a necessary step in the achievement of the observed\ngas-phase abundance of CH3NCO. Production of CH3NHCHO may plausibly occur on\ngrains either through the direct addition of functional-group radicals or\nthrough the hydrogenation of CH3NCO. Provided the detection of CH3NHCHO is\nconfirmed, the only slight underabundance of this molecule compared to its more\nstable structural isomer acetamide and the sensitivity of the model abundances\nto the chemical kinetics parameters suggest that the formation of these two\nmolecules is controlled by kinetics rather than thermal equilibrium.\n", "  We introduce the concept of tunable ideal magnetic dipole scattering, where a\nnonmagnetic nanoparticle scatters lights as a pure magnetic dipole. High\nrefractive index subwavelength nanoparticles usually support both electric and\nmagnetic dipole responses. Thus, to achieve ideal magnetic dipole scattering\none has to suppress the electric dipole response. Such a possibility was\nrecently demonstrated for the so-called anapole mode, which is associated with\nzero electric dipole scattering. By overlapping magnetic dipole resonance with\nthe anapole mode we achieve ideal magnetic dipole scattering in the far-field\nwith tunable high scattering resonances in near infrared spectrum. We\ndemonstrate that such condition can be realized for two subwavelength\ngeometries. One of them is core-shell nanosphere consisting of Au core and\nsilicon shell. It can be also achieved in other geometries, including\nnanodisks, which are compatible with current nanofabrication technology.\n", "  This paper studies the structure of a parabolic partial differential equation\non graphs and digital n-dimensional manifolds, which are digital models of\ncontinuous n-manifolds. Conditions for the existence of solutions of equations\nare determined and investigated. Numerical solutions of the equation on a Klein\nbottle, a projective plane, a 4D sphere and a Moebius strip are presented.\n", "  In this study, we present observations of a type Iax supernova, PS1-12bwh,\ndiscovered during the Pan-STARRS1 3$\\pi$-survey. Our analysis was driven by\npreviously unseen pre-maximum, spectroscopic heterogeneity. While the light\ncurve and post-maximum spectra of PS1-12bwh are virtually identical to those of\nthe well-studied type Iax supernova, SN 2005hk, the $-$2 day spectrum of\nPS1-12bwh does not resemble SN 2005hk at a comparable epoch; instead, we found\nit to match a spectrum of SN 2005hk taken over a week earlier ($-$12 day). We\nare able to rule out the cause as being incorrect phasing, and argue that it is\nnot consistent with orientation effects predicted by existing explosion\nsimulations. To investigate the potential source of this difference, we\nperformed radiative transfer modelling of both supernovae. We found that the\npre-maximum spectrum of PS1-12bwh is well matched by a synthetic spectrum\ngenerated from a model with a lower density in the high velocity ($\\gtrsim$6000\nkm~s$^{-1}$) ejecta than SN 2005hk. The observed differences between SN 2005hk\nand PS1-12bwh may therefore be attributed primarily to differences in the high\nvelocity ejecta alone, while comparable densities for the lower velocity ejecta\nwould explain the nearly identical post-maximum spectra. These two supernovae\nfurther highlight the diversity within the SNe Iax class, as well as the\nchallenges in spectroscopically identifying and phasing these objects,\nespecially at early epochs.\n", "  New Horizons mission observations show that the small satellites Styx, Nix,\nKerberos and Hydra, of the Pluto-Charon system, have not tidally spun-down to\nnear synchronous spin states and have high obliquities with respect to their\norbit about the Pluto-Charon binary (Weaver et al. 2016). We use a damped\nmass-spring model within an N-body simulation to study spin and obliquity\nevolution for single spinning non-round bodies in circumbinary orbit.\nSimulations with tidal dissipation alone do not show strong obliquity\nvariations from tidally induced spin-orbit resonance crossing and this we\nattribute to the high satellite spin rates and low orbital eccentricities.\nHowever, a tidally evolving Styx exhibits intermittent obliquity variations and\nepisodes of tumbling. During a previous epoch where Charon migrated away from\nPluto, the minor satellites could have been trapped in orbital mean motion\ninclination resonances. An outward migrating Charon induces large variations in\nNix and Styx's obliquities. The cause is a commensurability between the mean\nmotion resonance frequency and the spin precession rate of the spinning body.\nAs the minor satellites are near mean motion resonances, this mechanism could\nhave lifted the obliquities of all four minor satellites. The high obliquities\nneed not be primordial if the minor satellites were at one time captured into\nmean motion resonances.\n", "  In this work we use the newly reported Boron-to-Carbon ratio (B/C) from\nAMS-02 and the time-dependent proton fluxes from PAMELA and AMS-02 to constrain\nthe source and propagation parameters of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. A linear\ncorrelation of the solar modulation parameter with solar activities is assumed\nto account for the time-varying cosmic ray fluxes. A comprehensive set of\npropagation models, with/without reacceleration or convection, have been\ndiscussed and compared. We find that only the models with reacceleration can\nself-consistently fit both the proton and B/C data. The rigidity dependence\nslope of the diffusion coefficient, $\\delta$, is found to be about $0.38-0.50$\nfor the diffusion-reacceleration models. The plain diffusion and\ndiffusion-convection models fit the data poorly. We compare different model\npredictions of the positron and antiproton fluxes with the data. We find that\nthe diffusion-reacceleration models over-produce low energy positrons, while\nnon-reacceleration models give better fit to the data. As for antiprotons,\nreacceleration models tend to under-predict low energy antiproton fluxes,\nunless a phenomenological modification of the velocity-dependence of the\ndiffusion coefficient is applied. Our results suggest that there could be\nimportant differences of the propagation for nuclei and leptons, in either the\nMilky Way or the solar heliosphere.\n", "  Search of novel two-dimensional giant Rashba semiconductors is a crucial step\nin the development of the forthcoming nano-spintronics technology. Using\nfirst-principle calculations, we study a stable two-dimensional crystal phase\nof BiSb having buckled honeycomb lattice geometry, which is yet unexplored. The\nphonon, room temperature molecular dynamics and elastic constant calculations\nverify the dynamical and mechanical stability of the monolayer at 0~K and at\nroom temperature. The calculated electronic bandstructure reveals the direct\nbandgap semiconducting nature of BiSb monolayer with presence of highly mobile\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) near Fermi-level. Inclusion of spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) yields the giant Rashba spin-splitting of 2DEG near Fermi-level.\nThe calculated Rashba energy and Rashba splitting constant are 13 meV and 2.3\neV\\AA, respectively. The strength of the Rashba splitting is amongst the\nlargest yet known 2D Rashba semiconductors. We demonstrate that the strength of\nthe Rashba spin-splitting can be significantly tuned by applying in-plane\nbi-axial strain on the BiSb monolayer. Presence of the giant Rashba\nspin-splitting together with the large electronic bandgap (1.6 eV) makes this\nsystem of peculiar interest for optoelectronics applications. Furthermore, we\nstudy the electronic properties of BiSb/AlN heterostructures having a lattice\nmismatch of 1.3\\% at the interface. Our results suggest that BiSb monolayer and\nheterostructure systems could be potentially used to develop highly efficient\nspin field-effect transistors, optoelectronics and nano-spintronics devices.\nThus, this comprehensive study of two-dimensional BiSb systems can expand the\nrange of possible applications in the future spintronics technology.\n", "  We calculate the conductances of a three-way junction of spinless\nLuttinger-liquid wires as functions of bias voltages applied to three\nindependent Fermi-liquid reservoirs. In particular, we consider the setup that\nis characteristic of a tunneling experiment, in which the strength of\nelectron-electron interactions in one of the arms of the junction (\"tunneling\ntip\") is different from that in the other two arms (which together form a \"main\nwire\"). The scaling dependence of the two independent conductances on bias\nvoltages is determined within a fermionic renormalization-group approach in the\nlimit of weak interactions. The solution shows that, in general, the\nconductances scale with the bias voltages in an essentially different way\ncompared to their scaling with the temperature $T$. Specifically, unlike in the\ntwo-terminal setup, the nonlinear conductances cannot be generically obtained\nfrom the linear ones by simply replacing $T$ with the \"corresponding\" bias\nvoltage or the largest one. Remarkably, a finite tunneling bias voltage\nprevents the interaction-induced breakup of the main wire into two disconnected\npieces in the limit of zero $T$ and a zero source-drain voltage.\n", "  Photonic losses pose a major limitation for implementation of quantum state\ntransfer between nodes of a quantum network. A measurement that heralds\nsuccessful transfer without revealing any information about the qubit may\nalleviate this limitation. Here, we demonstrate heralded absorption of a single\nphotonic qubit generated by a single neutral quantum dot, by a single-electron\ncharged quantum dot that is located 5 meters away. The transfer of quantum\ninformation to the spin degree of freedom takes place upon emission of a\nphoton: for a properly chosen or prepared quantum dot, detection of this photon\nyields no information about the qubit. We show that this process can be\ncombined with local operations optically performed on the destination node, by\nmeasuring classical correlations between the absorbed photon color and the\nfinal state of the electron spin. Our work suggests alternative avenues for\nrealization of quantum information protocols based on cascaded quantum systems.\n", "  Using mm-wavelength data from ALMA, the EMoCA spectral line survey revealed\nthe presence of both the straight-chain and branched forms of propyl cyanide\n(C$_3$H$_7$CN) toward the Galactic Center star-forming source Sgr B2(N2). This\nwas the first interstellar detection of a branched aliphatic molecule. Through\ncomputational methods, we seek to explain the observed $i$:$n$ ratio for propyl\ncyanide, and to predict the abundances of the four different forms of the\nhomologous nitrile, butyl cyanide (C$_4$H$_9$CN). We also investigate whether\nother molecules will show a similar degree of branching, by modeling alkanes up\nto pentane (C$_5$H$_{12}$). We use a coupled three-phase chemical kinetics\nmodel to simulate the chemistry of Sgr B2(N2), using an updated chemical\nnetwork that includes grain-surface/ice-mantle formation routes for branched\nnitriles and alkanes. We use the EMoCA survey data to search for the\nstraight-chain form of butyl cyanide toward Sgr B2(N2). The observed $i$:$n$\nratio for propyl cyanide is reproduced by the models. Butyl cyanide is\npredicted to show similar abundances to propyl cyanide, and to exhibit strong\nbranching, with the $sec$ form clearly dominant over all others. The addition\nof CN to acetylene and ethene is found to be important to the production of\nvinyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl cyanide. We report a non-detection of\n$n$-C$_4$H$_9$CN toward Sgr B2(N2), with an abundance at least 1.7 times lower\nthan that of $n$-C$_3$H$_7$CN. This value is within the range predicted by the\nchemical models. The models indicate that the degree of branching rises with\nincreasing molecular size. The efficiency of CN addition to unsaturated\nhydrocarbons boosts the abundances of nitriles in the model, and enhances the\nratio of straight-to-branched molecule production. The predicted abundance of\n$s$-C$_4$H$_9$CN makes it a good candidate for future detection toward Sgr\nB2(N2).\n", "  The $K_{S}^{0}-K_{L}^{0}$ asymmetries in the $D$ meson decays, induced by the\ninterference between the Cabibbo-favored and the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed\namplitudes, can help to understand the dynamics of charm decays. All possible\nprocesses of two-body non-leptonic $D$ decays into one neutral kaon and another\npseudoscalar or vector meson are considered. We study the $K_{S}^{0}-K_{L}^{0}$\nasymmetries and the branching fractions of corresponding processes in the\nfactorization-assisted topological-amplitude approach in which significant\nflavor $SU(3)$ symmetry breaking effects are included. The branching fractions\nof $K_{L}^{0}$ modes are predicted. It is first found that the\n$K_{S}^{0}-K_{L}^{0}$ asymmetries in the $D^0$-meson decays are shifted by the\n$D^0-\\overline D^0$ mixing parameter $y_{D}\\simeq0.006$, to be $0.113\\pm0.001$\nfor all the relevant $D^{0}$ decay modes. Our results on $K_{S}^{0}-K_{L}^{0}$\nasymmetries are consistent with the current data and could be tested by\nexperiments in the future.\n", "  A simple variation of a two-Higgs-doublet model is proposed to describe the\n$30\\,{\\rm GeV}$ dimuon excess reported by Heister in his reanalysis of $Z \\to\n\\bar bb$ events in ALEPH data taken in 1992-95. The heavier CP-even Higgs $H$\nis the $125\\,{\\rm GeV}$ Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. The model admits two\noptions for describing the dimuon excess: (1) The lighter CP-even Higgs $h$ and\nthe CP-odd state $\\eta_A$ are approximately degenerate and contribute to the\n$30\\,{\\rm GeV}$ excess. (2) Only the $h$ is at $30\\,{\\rm GeV}$ while the\n$\\eta_A$ and $H$ are approximately degenerate at $125\\,{\\rm GeV}$. The ALEPH\ndata favor option 1. Testable predictions are presented for LHC as well as LEP\nexperiments. A potential no-go theorem for models of this type is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  A theory for the thermodynamic properties of steps on faceted crystalline\nsurfaces is presented. The formalism leads to the definition of step excess\nquantities, including an excess step stress that is the step analogy of surface\nstress. The approach is used to develop a relationship between the temperature\ndependence of the step free energy ($\\gamma^\\mathrm{st}$) and step excess\nquantities for energy and stress that can be readily calculated by atomistic\nsimulations. We demonstrate the application of this formalism in\nthermodynamic-integration (TI) calculations of the step free energy, based on\nmolecular-dynamics simulations, considering $\\left< 110 \\right>$ steps on the\n$\\{111\\}$ surface of a classical potential model for elemental Cu. In this\napplication we employ the Frenkel-Ladd approach to compute the reference value\nof $\\gamma^\\mathrm{st}$ for the TI calculations. Calculated results for excess\nenergy and stress show relatively weak temperature dependencies up to a\nhomologous temperature of approximately 0.6, above which these quantities\nincrease strongly and the step stress becomes more isotropic. From the\ncalculated excess quantities we compute $\\gamma^\\mathrm{st}$ over the\ntemperature range from zero up to the melting point ($T_\\mathrm{m}$). We find\nthat $\\gamma^\\mathrm{st}$ remains finite up to $T_\\mathrm{m}$, indicating the\nabsence of a roughening temperature for this $\\{111\\}$ surface facet, but\ndecreases by roughly fifty percent from the zero-temperature value. The\nstrongest temperature dependence occurs above homologous temperatures of\napproximately 0.6, where the step becomes configurationally disordered due to\nthe formation of point defects and appreciable capillary fluctuations.\n", "  Multi-Weyl semimetals (m-WSMs) are a new type of Weyl semimetal that have\nlinear dispersion along one symmetry direction but anisotropic non-linear\ndispersion along the two transverse directions with a topological charge larger\nthan one. Using the Boltzmann transport theory and fully incorporating the\nanisotropy of the system, we study the DC conductivity as a function of carrier\ndensity and temperature. We find that the characteristic density and\ntemperature dependence of the transport coefficients at the level of Boltzmann\ntheory are controlled by the topological charge of the multi-Weyl point and\ndistinguish m-WSMs from their linear Weyl counterparts.\n", "  We show theoretically and experimentally that the propagation of an acoustic\nwave in an airflow duct going through a pair of diaphragms, with equivalent\namount of mean-flow-induced effective gain and loss, displays all the features\nof a parity-time (PT) symmetric system. Using a scattering matrix formalism, we\nobserve experimentally the properties which reflect the PT-symmetry of the\nscattering acoustical system: the existence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking\nwith symmetry-broken pairs of scattering eigenstates showing amplification and\nreduction, and the existence of points with unidirectional invisibility.\n", "  We discuss the inflationary dynamics of a system with a non-minimal coupling\nbetween the Higgs and the Ricci scalar as well as a Ricci scalar squared term.\nThere are two scalar modes in this system, i.e. the Higgs and the spin-zero\nmode of the graviton, or the scalaron. We study the two-field dynamics of the\nHiggs and the scalaron during inflation, and clarify the condition where\ninflation is dominated by the Higgs/scalaron. We also find that the cut-off\nscale at around the vacuum is as large as the Planck scale, and hence there is\nno unitarity issue, although there is a constraint on the couplings from the\nperturbativity of the theory at around the vacuum.\n", "  In the exceptional field theory, there are two natural parameterizations for\nthe generalized metric; in terms of bosonic fields in the eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity (M-theory parameterization) and the type IIB supergravity (type\nIIB parameterization). In order to translate various results known in the\nM-theory to the type IIB theory or vice versa, an explicit map between the two\nparameterizations will be useful. In this note, we present such a linear map.\nComparing the two parameterizations under the linear map, we reproduce the\nknown T-duality transformation rules for the supergravity fields. We also\nobtain the T-duality rules for non-geometric $\\beta$-/$\\gamma$-fields appearing\nin the type II theory on a torus.\n", "  We present a model for simulating Carbon Monoxide (CO) rotational line\nemission in molecular clouds, taking account of their 3D spatial distribution\nin galaxies with different geometrical properties. The model implemented is\nbased on recent results in the literature and has been designed for performing\nMonte-Carlo simulations of this emission. We compare the simulations produced\nwith this model and calibrate them, both on the map level and on the power\nspectrum level, using the second release of data from the Planck satellite for\nthe Galactic plane, where the signal-to-noise ratio is highest. We use the\ncalibrated model to extrapolate the CO power spectrum at low Galactic latitudes\nwhere no high sensitivity observations are available yet. We then forecast the\nlevel of unresolved polarized emission from CO molecular clouds which could\ncontaminate the power spectrum of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\npolarization B-modes away from the Galactic plane. Assuming realistic levels of\nthe polarization fraction, we show that the level of contamination is\nequivalent to a cosmological signal with $r \\lesssim 0.02$. The Monte-Carlo\nMOlecular Line Emission (MCMole3D) Python package, which implements this model,\nis being made publicly available.\n", "  We perform an exhaustive scan of the allowed resonant production regime for\nsterile neutrino dark matter in order to improve constraints for dark matter\nstructures which arise from the non-thermal sterile neutrino energy spectra.\nSmall-scale structure constraints are particularly sensitive to large lepton\nasymmetries/small mixing angles which result in relatively warmer sterile\nneutrino momentum distributions. We revisit Milky Way galaxy subhalo count\nconstraints and combine them with recent searches for X-ray emission from\nsterile neutrino decays. Together they rule out models outside the mass range\n7.0 keV < m_nu_s < 36 keV and lepton asymmetries smaller than 15 x 10-6 per\nunit entropy density at 95 percent CI or greater. We also find that while a\nportion of the parameter space remains unconstrained, the combination of\nsubhalo counts and X-ray data indicate the candidate 3.55 keV X-ray line signal\npotentially originating from a 7.1 keV sterile neutrino decay to be disfavored\nat 93 percent CI.\n", "  Superconducting spintronics in hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet (S-F)\nheterostructures provides an exciting potential new class of device. The\nprototypical super-spintronic device is the superconducting spin-valve, where\nthe critical temperature, $T_c$, of the S-layer can be controlled by the\nrelative orientation of two (or more) F-layers. Here, we show that such control\nis also possible in a simple S/F bilayer. Using field history to set the\nremanent magnetic state of a thin Er layer, we demonstrate for a Nb/Er bilayer\na high level of control of both $T_c$ and the shape of the resistive\ntransition, R(T), to zero resistance. We are able to model the origin of the\nremanent magnetization, treating it as an increase in the effective exchange\nfield of the ferromagnet and link this, using conventional S-F theory, to the\nsuppression of $T_c$. We observe stepped features in the R(T) which we argue is\ndue to a fundamental interaction of superconductivity with inhomogeneous\nferromagnetism, a phenomena currently lacking theoretical description.\n", "  The main features of the convolution model which, in the region of\ntwo-nucleon (2N) and three-nucleon (3N) short-range correlations (SRC),\ndescribes the one-nucleon momentum distribution n(k_1) and the spectral\nfunction P(k_1,E) in terms of a convolution integral involving the relative\nn_{rel}(k_{rel}) and the center-of-mass n_{c.m.}(K_{c.m.}) momentum\ndistributions of a nucleon-nucleon pair, are illustrated in detail. It is\nstressed that the model, which stems from the universal property of\nfactorization exhibited by the nuclear wave function at short inter-nucleon\ndistances, is only applicable in a well-defined region of k_{rel} and K_{c.m.};\nit is shown, in particular, that the requirement of factorization introduces a\nsevere constraint on the values of k_{rel} and K_{c.m.} that appear in the\nconvolution integral. Using ab-initio relative and c.m. momentum distributions\nfor ^3He, the validity of the convolution model is investigated by comparing\nthe model spectral function and momentum distributions with the ones resulting\nfrom ab-initio calculations performed with realistic local NN interaction of\nthe Argonne family. It is shown that when the constraint on the value of\nk_{rel} and K_{c.m.} are correctly taken into account and only 2N SRC are taken\ninto account, the convolution model is in good agreement with the ab-initio\nspectral function in the region of the peak exhibited by the latter, whereas\nfar from the peak, particularly at high values of the removal energy, the model\nspectral function can be qualitatively reconciled with the ab-initio spectral\nfunction only by considering the effects of 3N SRC. As for the nucleon momentum\ndistribution, the effects of 3N SRC appears to be very small.\n", "  We consider the problem of determining the presence of genuine multipartite\nentanglement through the violation of Mermin's Bell-type inequality (MI).\nThough the violation of MI cannot certify the presence of genuine nonlocality,\nbut can certify genuine tripartite entanglement whenever the violation is\nstrictly greater than $2\\sqrt{2}$. Here we show that MI suffices as genuine\nentanglement witness even when its value is $2\\sqrt{2}$ if at least two of the\nlocal marginal distributions are not completely random provided the local\nHilbert space dimension of at least one of the sub-systems is two. Thus local\nmarginals suffice as semi-device independent genuine entanglement witness. This\nis intriguing in a sense, as the local properties of a composite system can\nhelp to identify its global property. Furthermore, analyzing another quantity\nconstructed from Mermin polynomials we show that genuine entanglement\ncertification task for the correlations with MI violation equal to $2\\sqrt{2}$\ncan actually be made fully device independent.\n", "  Properties of the wave function equivalent potentials introduced by HAL QCD\ncollaboration are studied in a non-relativistic coupled-channel model. The\nderivative expansion is generalized, and then applied to the energy-independent\nand non-local potentials. The expansion coefficients are determined from\nanalytic solutions to the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter wave functions. The scattering\nphase shifts computed from these potentials are compared with the exact values\nto examine the convergence of the expansion. It is confirmed that the\ngeneralized derivative expansion converges in terms of the scattering phase\nshift rather than the functional structure of the non-local potentials. It is\nalso found that the convergence can be improved by tuning either the choice of\ninterpolating fields or expansion scale in the generalized derivative\nexpansion.\n", "  Most of the plasma microphysics which shapes the acceleration process of\nparticles at collisionless shock waves takes place in the cosmic-ray precursor,\nthrough the interaction of accelerated particles with the unshocked plasma.\nDetecting directly or indirectly the synchrotron radiation of accelerated\nparticles in this precursor would open a new window on the microphysics of\nacceleration and of collisionless shock waves. We provide analytical estimates\nof the spectrum and of the polarization fraction of the synchrotron precursor\nfor both relativistic and non-relativistic collisionless shock fronts,\naccounting for the self-generation or amplification of magnetic turbulence. In\nrelativistic sources, the spectrum of the precursor is harder than that of the\nshocked plasma, because the upstream residence time increases with particle\nenergy, leading to an effectively hard spectrum of accelerated particles in the\nprecursor volume. At high frequencies, typically in the optical to X-ray range,\nthe contribution of the precursor becomes sizeable, but we find that in most\ncases studied, it remains dominated by the synchrotron or inverse Compton\ncontribution of the shocked plasma; its contribution might be detectable only\nin trans-relativistic shock waves. Non-relativistic sources offer the\npossibility of spectral imaging of the precursor by viewing the shock front\nedge-on. We calculate this spectro-morphological contribution for various\nparameters. The synchrotron contribution is also sizeable at the highest\nfrequencies (X-ray range). If the turbulence is tangled in the plane transverse\nto the shock front, the resulting synchrotron radiation should be nearly\nmaximally linearly polarized; polarimetry thus arises as an interesting tool to\nreveal this precursor.[Abridged]\n", "  The strong spin-spin exchange interaction in some low-dimensional magnetic\nmaterials can give rise to a high group velocity and thermal conductivity\ncontribution from magnons. One example is the incommensurate layered compounds\n(Sr,Ca,La)14Cu24O41. The effects of grain boundaries and defects on\nquasi-one-dimensional magnon transport in these compounds are not well\nunderstood. Here we report the microstructures and anisotropic thermal\ntransport properties of textured Sr14Cu24O41, which are prepared by solid-state\nreaction followed by spark plasma sintering. Transmission electron microscopy\nclearly reveals nano-layered grains and the presence of dislocations and planar\ndefects. The thermal conductivity contribution and mean free paths of magnons\nin the textured samples are evaluated with the use of a kinetic model for\none-dimensional magnon transport, and found to be suppressed significantly as\ncompared to single crystals at low temperatures. The experimental results can\nbe explained by a one-dimensional magnon-defect scattering model, provided that\nthe magnon-grain boundary scattering mean free path in the anisotropic magnetic\nstructure is smaller than the average length of these nano-layers along the c\naxis. The finding suggests low transmission coefficients for magnons across\ngrain boundaries.\n", "  One of the most significant challenges involved in efforts to understand the\neffects of repeated earthquake cycle activity are the computational costs of\nlarge-scale viscoelastic earthquake cycle models. Computationally intensive\nviscoelastic codes must be evaluated thousands of times and locations, and as a\nresult, studies tend to adopt a few fixed rheological structures and model\ngeometries, and examine the predicted time-dependent deformation over short\n(<10 yr) time periods at a given depth after a large earthquake. Training a\ndeep neural network to learn a computationally efficient representation of\nviscoelastic solutions, at any time, location, and for a large range of\nrheological structures, allows these calculations to be done quickly and\nreliably, with high spatial and temporal resolution. We demonstrate that this\nmachine learning approach accelerates viscoelastic calculations by more than\n50,000%. This magnitude of acceleration will enable the modeling of\ngeometrically complex faults over thousands of earthquake cycles across wider\nranges of model parameters and at larger spatial and temporal scales than have\nbeen previously possible.\n", "  We study an exotic state which is localized only at an intersection of edges\nof a topological material. This \"edge-of-edge\" state is shown to exist\ngenerically. We construct explicitly generic edge-of-edge states in\n5-dimensional Weyl semimetals and their dimensional reductions, such as\n4-dimensional topological insulators of class A and 3-dimensional chiral\ntopological insulators of class AIII. The existence of the edge-of-edge state\nis due to a topological charge of the edge states. The notion of the Berry\nconnection is generalized to include the space of all possible boundary\nconditions, where Chern-Simons forms are shown to be nontrivial.\n", "  Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence driven by the magnetorotational\ninstability can provide diffusive transport of angular momentum in\nastrophysical disks, and a widely studied computational model for this process\nis the ideal, stratified, isothermal shearing box. Here we report results of a\nconvergence study of such boxes up to a resolution of $N = 256$ zones per scale\nheight, performed on blue waters at NCSA with ramses-gpu. We find that the time\nand vertically integrated dimensionless shear stress $\\overline{\\alpha} \\sim\nN^{-1/3}$, i.e. the shear stress is resolution dependent. We also find that the\nmagnetic field correlation length decreases with resolution, $\\lambda \\sim\nN^{-1/2}$. This variation is strongest at the disk midplane. We show that our\nmeasurements of $\\alpha$ are consistent with earlier studies. We discuss\npossible reasons for the lack of convergence.\n", "  Milky Way open clusters are very diverse in terms of age, chemical\ncomposition, and kinematic properties. Intermediate-age and old open clusters\nare less common, and it is even harder to find them inside the solar\nGalactocentric radius, due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction\ninside this region. NGC 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (IOCs)\nobserved by the $Gaia$-ESO survey (GES). This cluster is an important target\nfor calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and\nchemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. Using the measurements\nfrom $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4), we identify 95 main-sequence\ndwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list, and eight giants as\ncluster members from the UVES target list. The dwarf cluster members have a\nmedian radial velocity of $13.6\\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster\nmembers have a median radial velocity of $12.0\\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median\n[Fe/H] of $0.10\\pm0.02$ dex. The color-magnitude diagram of these cluster\nmembers suggests an age of $0.9\\pm0.1$ Gyr, with $(m-M)_0=11.4$ and\n$E(B-V)=0.86$. We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC\n6802, including 27 elemental species. To gain a more general picture about\nIOCs, the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs\npreviously studied by GES, that is, NGC 4815, Trumpler 20, NGC 6705, and\nBerkeley 81. NGC 6802 shows similar C, N, Na, and Al abundances as other IOCs.\nThese elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of\ncluster turn-off mass. The $\\alpha$, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements\nare also explored in a self-consistent way.\n", "  Ocean-atmosphere chemistry on Earth has undergone dramatic evolutionary\nchanges through its long history, with potentially significant ramifications\nfor the emergence and long-term stability of atmospheric biosignatures. Though\na great deal of work has centered on refining our understanding of false\npositives for remote life detection, much less attention has been paid to the\npossibility of false negatives, that is, cryptical biospheres that are\nwidespread and active on a planet's surface but are ultimately undetectable or\ndifficult to detect in the composition of a planet's atmosphere. Here, we\nsummarize recent developments from geochemical proxy records and Earth system\nmodels that provide insight into the long-term evolution of the most readily\ndetectable potential biosignature gases on Earth - oxygen (O2), ozone (O3), and\nmethane (CH4). We suggest that the canonical O2-CH4 disequilibrium biosignature\nwould perhaps have been challenging to detect remotely during Earth's ~4.5\nbillion year history and that in general atmospheric O2/O3 levels have been a\npoor proxy for the presence of Earth's biosphere for all but the last ~500\nmillion years. We further suggest that detecting atmospheric CH4 would have\nbeen problematic for most of the last ~2.5 billion years of Earth's history.\nMore broadly, we stress that internal oceanic recycling of biosignature gases\nwill often render surface biospheres on ocean-bearing silicate worlds cryptic,\nwith the implication that the planets most conducive to the development and\nmaintenance of a pervasive biosphere will often be challenging to characterize\nvia conventional atmospheric biosignatures.\n", "  The field of high energy nuclear collisions has witnessed a surge of interest\nin the role played by hydrodynamic fluctuations. Hydrodynamic fluctuations may\nhave significant effects on matter created in heavy-ion accelerators whose\ntrajectories in the plane of temperature versus chemical potential pass near a\npossible critical endpoint. We extend previous studies to explore the impact of\nthese fluctuations on Hanbury Brown-Twiss interferometry of identical hadrons.\nWith an appropriately defined correlation function we find that the\nfluctuations increase substantially when the trajectory passes near a critical\nendpoint, and also displays a damped oscillatory behavior in the rapidity\ndistance $\\Delta y$ unlike that originating from initial-state fluctuations.\n", "  We realise a circular gray-field polariscope to image stress-induced\nbirefringence in thin (submicron thick) silicon nitride (SiN) membranes and\nstrings. This enables quantitative mapping of the orientation of principal\nstresses and stress anisotropy, complementary to, and in agreement with, finite\nelement modeling (FEM). Furthermore, using a sample with a well known stress\nanisotropy, we extract a new value for the photoelastic (Brewster) coefficient\nof silicon nitride, $C \\approx (3.4~\\pm~0.1)\\times~10^{-6}~\\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$.\nWe explore possible applications of the method to analyse and quality-control\nstressed membranes with phononic crystal patterns\n", "  The nonequilibrium dynamics of strongly-correlated fermions in lattice\nsystems have attracted considerable interest in the condensed matter and\nultracold atomic-gas communities. While experiments have made remarkable\nprogress in recent years, there remains a need for the further development of\ntheoretical tools that can account for both the nonequilibrium conditions and\nstrong correlations. For instance, time-dependent theoretical quantum\napproaches based on the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods\nhave been primarily applied to one-dimensional setups. Recently,\ntwo-dimensional quantum simulations of the expansion of fermions based on\nnonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF) have been presented [Schluenzen et al.,\nPhys. Rev. B 93, 035107 (2016)] that showed excellent agreement with the\nexperiments. Here we present an extensive comparison of the NEGF approach to\nnumerically accurate DMRG results. The results indicate that NEGF are a\nreliable theoretical tool for weak to intermediate coupling strengths in\narbitrary dimensions and make long simulations possible. This is complementary\nto DMRG simulations which are particularly efficient at strong coupling.\n", "  One of the fundamental parameters entering neutrino oscillation framework is\nthe leptonic CP phase $\\delta_{13}$ and its measurement is an important goal of\nthe planned long baseline experiments. It should be noted that ordinary matter\neffects complicate the determination of this parameter and there are studies in\nliterature that deal with separation of intrinsic versus extrinsic CP\nviolation. It is important to investigate the consequences of new physics\neffects that can not only hamper the measurement of $\\delta_{13}$, but also\nimpact the consequences of discrete symmetries such as CP, T and unitarity in\ndifferent oscillation channels. In the present work, we explore these discrete\nsymmetries and implications on unitarity in presence of two new physics\nscenarios (non-standard interaction in propagation and presence of sterile\nneutrinos) that serve as good examples of going beyond the standard scenario in\ndifferent directions. We uncover the impact of new physics scenarios on\ndisentangling intrinsic and extrinsic CP violation.\n", "  We investigate from first principles the field-like spin-orbit torques (SOTs)\nin a Ag$_{2}$Bi-terminated Ag(111) film grown on ferromagnetic Fe(110). We find\nthat a large part of the SOT arises from the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in\nthe Ag$_{2}$Bi layer far away from the Fe layers. These results clearly hint at\na long range spin transfer in the direction perpendicular to the film that does\nnot originate in the spin Hall effect. In order to bring evidence of the\nnon-local character of the computed SOT, we show that the torque acting on the\nFe layers can be engineered by the introduction of Bi vacancies in the\nAg$_{2}$Bi layer. Overall, we find a drastic dependence of the SOT on the\ndisorder type, which we explain by a complex interplay of different\ncontributions to the SOT in the Brillouin zone.\n", "  We report on the observation of magnetic quantum ratchet effect in (Cd,Mn)Te-\nand CdTe-based quantum well structures with an asymmetric lateral dual grating\ngate superlattice subjected to an external magnetic field applied normal to the\nquantum well plane. A dc electric current excited by cw terahertz laser\nradiation shows 1/B-oscillations with an amplitude much larger as compared to\nthe photocurrent at zero magnetic field. We show that the photocurrent is\ncaused by the combined action of a spatially periodic in-plane potential and\nthe spatially modulated radiation due to the near field effects of light\ndiffraction. Magnitude and direction of the photocurrent are determined by the\ndegree of the lateral asymmetry controlled by the variation of voltages applied\nto the individual gates. The observed magneto-oscillations with enhanced\nphotocurrent amplitude result from Landau quantization and, for (Cd,Mn)Te at\nlow temperatures, from the exchange enhanced Zeeman splitting in diluted\nmagnetic heterostructures. Theoretical analysis, considering the magnetic\nquantum ratchet effect in the framework of semiclassical approach, describes\nquite well the experimental results.\n", "  We present the generation of continuous-wave optical squeezing from a\ntitanium-indiffused lithium niobate waveguide resonator. We directly measure\n2.9\\pm 0.1 dB of single-mode squeezing, which equates to a produced level of\n4.9\\pm 0.1 dB after accounting for detection losses. This device showcases the\ncurrent capabilities of this waveguide architecture and precipitates more\ncomplicated integrated continuous-wave quantum devices in the\ncontinuous-variable regime.\n", "  We address the problem of analyzing the radius of convergence of perturbative\nexpansion of non-equilibrium steady states of Lindblad driven spin chains. A\nsimple formal approach is developed for systematically computing the\nperturbative expansion of small driven systems. We consider the paradigmatic\nmodel of an open $XXZ$ spin 1/2 chain with boundary supported ultralocal\nLindblad dissipators and treat two different perturbative cases: (i) expansion\nin system-bath coupling parameter and (ii) expansion in driving (bias)\nparameter. In the first case (i) we find that the radius of convergence quickly\nshrinks with increasing the system size, while in the second case (ii) we find\nthat the convergence radius is always larger than $1$, and in particular it\napproaches $1$ from above as we change the anisotropy from easy plane ($XY$) to\neasy axis (Ising) regime.\n", "  In the Solar System, interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) originating mainly\nfrom asteroid collisions and cometary activities drift to the Earth orbit due\nto the Poynting-Robertson drag. We analyzed the thermal emission from IDPs that\nwas observed by the first Japanese infrared astronomical satellite, AKARI. The\nobserved surface brightness in the trailing direction of the Earth orbit is\n3.7% greater than that in the leading direction in the $9{\\rm \\mu m}$ band and\n3.0% in the $18{\\rm \\mu m}$ band. In order to reveal dust properties causing\nthe leading-trailing surface brightness asymmetry, we numerically integrated\norbits of the Sun, the Earth, and a dust particle as a restricted three-body\nproblem including radiation from the Sun. The initial orbits of particles are\ndetermined according to the orbits of main-belt asteroids or Jupiter-family\ncomets. The orbital trapping in mean motion resonances results in a significant\nleading-trailing asymmetry so that intermediate sized dust (~10-100${\\rm \\mu\nm}$) produces a greater asymmetry than the zodiacal light has. The\nleading-trailing surface brightness difference integrated over the size\ndistribution of the asteroidal dust is obtained to be the values of 27.7% and\n25.3% in the $9{\\rm \\mu m}$ and $18{\\rm \\mu m}$ bands, respectively. In\ncontrast, the brightness difference for cometary dust is calculated as the\nvalues of 3.6% and 3.1% in the $9{\\rm \\mu m}$ and $18{\\rm \\mu m}$ bands,\nrespectively, if the maximum dust radius is set to be $s_{\\rm max} = 3000{\\rm\n\\mu m}$. Taking into account these values and their errors, we conclude that\nthe contribution of asteroidal dust to the zodiacal infrared emission is less\nthan ~10%, while cometary dust of the order of 1 mm mainly accounts for the\nzodiacal light in infrared.\n", "  In the framework of the GAPS project, we are conducting an observational\nprogramme aimed at the determination of the orbital obliquity of known\ntransiting exoplanets. The targets are selected to probe the obliquity against\na wide range of stellar and planetary physical parameters. We exploit\nhigh-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements, delivered by the HARPS-N\nspectrograph at the 3.6m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, to measure the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect in RV time-series bracketing planet transits,\nand to refine the orbital parameters determinations with out-of-transit RV\ndata. We also analyse new transit light curves obtained with several 1-2m class\ntelescopes to better constrain the physical fundamental parameters of the\nplanets and parent stars. We report here on new transit spectroscopic\nobservations for three very massive close-in giant planets: WASP43b, HATP20b\nand Qatar2b orbiting dwarf K-type stars with effective temperature well below\n5000K. We find lambda = 3.5pm6.8 deg for WASP43b and lambda = -8.0pm6.9 deg for\nHATP20b, while for Qatar2, our faintest target, the RM effect is only\nmarginally detected, though our best-fit value lambda = 15pm20 deg is in\nagreement with a previous determination. In combination with stellar rotational\nperiods derived photometrically, we estimate the true spin-orbit angle, finding\nthat WASP43b is aligned while the orbit of HATP20b presents a small but\nsignificant obliquity (Psi=36 _{-12}^{+10} deg). By analyzing the CaII H&K\nchromospheric emission lines for HATP20 and WASP43, we find evidence for an\nenhanced level of stellar activity which is possibly induced by star-planet\ninteractions.\n", "  We present calculations of the one-loop vacuum polarization correction\n(Uehling potential) for the three-body problem in the NRQED formalism. The case\nof one-electron molecular systems is considered. Numerical results of the\nvacuum polarization contribution at m$\\alpha$7 and higher orders for the\nfundamental transitions (v = 0, L = 0) $\\rightarrow$ (v ' = 1, L ' = 0) in the\nH2+ and HD+ molecular ions are presented and compared with calculations\nperformed in the adiabatic approximation. The residual uncertainty from this\ncontribution on the transition frequencies is shown to be of a few tens of Hz.\n", "  Anisotropic charge carrier transport in black phosphorus limited by ionized\nimpurity scattering at finite temperature is explored theoretically. The\nanisotropic electronic structure enters the calculation for the polarizability\n(screening), the momentum relaxation time, and the mobility. For finite\ntemperature, scattering is not limited to the Fermi surface and the\npolarizability is temperature dependent. The impact of screening is\ninvestigated in detail with its dependence on carrier density and temperature.\nCompeting with the thermal excitation effects, the temperature dependence of\nthe polarizability is found to dominate for T<100K. As a result, the charge\ncarrier mobility slowly decreases with increasing temperature. The weak\ntemperature dependence of the mobility and its anisotropy ratio of 1.9-3.2\nagree with published experimental data.\n", "  We revisited solution of a linearized form of leading order\nBalitsky-Kovchegov equation (linear in S-matrix for dipole-nucleus scattering).\nHere we adopted dipole transverse width dependent cutoff in order to regulate\nthe dipole integral. We also have taken care of all the higher order terms\n(higher order in the cutoff) that have been reasonably neglected before. The\nsolution reproduces both McLerran-Venugopalan type initial condition (Gaussian\nin scaling variable) and Levin-Tuchin solution (Gaussian in logarithm of\nscaling variable) in the appropriate limits. It also connects this two opposite\nlimits smoothly with better accuracy for sets of rescaled rapidity when\ncompared to numerical solutions of full leading order Balitsky-Kovchegov\nequation.\n", "  In the present work, we explore the existence, stability and dynamics of\nsingle and multiple vortex ring states that can arise in Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. Earlier works have illustrated the bifurcation of such states, in\nthe vicinity of the linear limit, for isotropic or anisotropic\nthree-dimensional harmonic traps. Here, we extend these states to the regime of\nlarge chemical potentials, the so-called Thomas-Fermi limit, and explore their\nproperties such as equilibrium radii and inter-ring distance, for multi-ring\nstates, as well as their vibrational spectra and possible instabilities. In\nthis limit, both the existence and stability characteristics can be partially\ntraced to a particle picture that considers the rings as individual particles\noscillating within the trap and interacting pairwise with one another. Finally,\nwe examine some representative instability scenarios of the multi-ring dynamics\nincluding breakup and reconnections, as well as the transient formation of\nvortex lines.\n", "  High speed solar wind streams (HSSs) are very efficient drivers of\ngeomagnetic activity at high latitudes. In this paper we use a recently\ndeveloped $\\Delta{H}$ parameter of geomagnetic activity, calculated from the\nnight-side hourly magnetic field measurements of the Sodankyl\\\"a observatory,\nas a proxy for solar wind (SW) speed at monthly time resolution in 1914-2014\n(solar cycles 15-24). The seasonal variation in the relation between monthly\n$\\Delta{H}$ and solar wind speed is taken into account by calculating separate\nregressions between $\\Delta{H}$ and SW speed for each month. Thereby, we obtain\na homogeneous series of proxy values for monthly solar wind speed for the last\n100 years. We find that the strongest HSS-active months of each solar cycle\noccur in the declining phase, in years 1919, 1930, 1941, 1952, 1959, 1973,\n1982, 1994 and 2003. Practically all these years are the same or adjacent to\nthe years of annual maximum solar wind speeds. This implies that the most\npersistent coronal holes, lasting for several solar rotations and leading to\nthe highest annual SW speeds, are also the sources of the highest monthly SW\nspeeds. Accordingly, during the last 100 years, there were no coronal holes of\nshort duration (of about one solar rotation) that would produce faster monthly\n(or solar rotation) averaged solar wind than the most long-living coronal holes\nin each solar cycle produce.\n", "  We study the physical properties of giant molecular cloud associations (GMAs)\nin M100 (NGC 4321) using the ALMA Science Verification feathered (12-m+ACA)\ndata in 12CO (1-0). To examine the environmental dependence of GMA properties,\nGMAs are classified based on their locations in the various environments as\ncircumnuclear ring (CNR), bar, spiral, and inter-arm GMAs. The CNR GMAs are\nmassive and compact, while the inter-arm GMAs are diffuse with low surface\ndensity. GMA mass and size are strongly correlated, as suggested by Larson\n(1981). However, the diverse power-law index of the relation implies that the\nGMA properties are not uniform among the environments. The CNR and bar GMAs\nshow higher velocity dispersion than those in other environments. We find\nlittle evidence for a correlation between GMA velocity dispersion and size,\nwhich indicates that the GMAs are in diverse dynamical states. Indeed, the\nvirial parameter of GMAs spans nearly two orders of magnitude. Only the spiral\nGMAs are in general self-gravitating. Star formation activity of the GMAs\ndecreases in order over the CNR, spiral, bar, and the inter-arm GMAs. The\ndiverse GMA and star formation properties in different environments lead to\nvariations in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. A combination of multiple\nmechanisms or gas phase change is necessary to explain the observed slopes.\nComparisons of GMA properties acquired with the use of the 12-m-array\nobservations with those from the feathered data are also presented. The results\nshow that the missing flux and extended emission cannot be neglected for the\nstudy of environmental dependence.\n", "  Potassium is introduced into the crystalline herringbone structure of\npentacene searching for a compound showing metallic electronic transport\nproperties and, hopefully, superconductivity at small enough temperatures.\nSeveral possible structures for stoichiometric KPentacene (1:1), K2Pentacene\n(2:1) and K3Pentacene (3:1) compounds are theoretically investigated. Detailed\ndensities of states for all of them are presented. As a more prominent result,\na new monoclinic structure has been stabilized for the potassium richer\nmaterial that could correspond to the recently synthesized superconducting\nphase of K3Pentacene. Although energetically unfavorable, it is the only\nmetallic candidate found to date.\n", "  We study anisotropic deformations of the spatially open homogeneous and\nisotropic cosmology in the ghost free massive gravity theory with flat\nreference metric. We find that if the initial perturbations are not too strong\nthen the physical metric relaxes back to the isotropic de Sitter state.\nHowever, the dumping of the anisotropies is achieved at the expense of exciting\nthe Stueckelberg fields in such a way that the reference metric changes and\ndoes not share anymore with the physical metric the same rotational and\ntranslational symmetries. As a result, the universe evolves towards a fixed\npoint which does not coincide with the original solution, but for which the\nphysical metric is still de Sitter. If the initial perturbation is strong, then\nits evolution generically leads to a singular anisotropic state or, for some\nparameter values, to a decay into flat spacetime. We also present an infinite\ndimensional family of new homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies in the theory.\n", "  We report on electrostatic measurements made on board the European Space\nAgency mission LISA Pathfinder. Detailed measurements of the charge-induced\nelectrostatic forces exerted on free-falling test masses (TMs) inside the\ncapacitive gravitational reference sensor are the first made in a relevant\nenvironment for a space-based gravitational wave detector. Employing a\ncombination of charge control and electric-field compensation, we show that the\nlevel of charge-induced acceleration noise on a single TM can be maintained at\na level close to 1.0 fm/s^2/sqrt(Hz) across the 0.1-100 mHz frequency band that\nis crucial to an observatory such as LISA. Using dedicated measurements that\ndetect these effects in the differential acceleration between the two test\nmasses, we resolve the stochastic nature of the TM charge build up due to\ninterplanetary cosmic rays and the TM charge-to-force coupling through stray\nelectric fields in the sensor. All our measurements are in good agreement with\npredictions based on a relatively simple electrostatic model of the LISA\nPathfinder instrument.\n", "  Detection of entanglement in quantum networks consisting of many parties is\none of the important steps towards building quantum communication and\ncomputation networks. We consider a scenario where the measurement devices used\nfor this certification are uncharacterised. In this case, it is well known that\nby using quantum states as inputs for the measurement devices it is possible to\ndetect any entangled state (a situation known as measurement device-independent\nentanglement witnessing). Here we go beyond entanglement detection and provide\nmethods to estimate the amount of entanglement in a quantum network. We also\nconsider the task of randomness certification and show that randomness can be\ncertified in a variety of cases, including single-partite experiments or setups\nusing only separable states.\n", "  We measured magnetization, specific heat, electron spin resonance, neutron\ndiffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering of CrVMoO$_7$ powder. An\nantiferromagnetically ordered state appears below $T_{\\rm N} = 26.5 \\pm 0.8$ K.\nWe consider that the probable spin model for CrVMoO$_7$ is an interacting\nantiferromagnetic spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ dimer model. We evaluated the intradimer\ninteraction $J$ to be $25 \\pm 1$ K and the effective interdimer interaction\n$J_{\\rm eff}$ to be $8.8 \\pm 1$ K. CrVMoO$_7$ is a rare spin dimer compound\nthat shows an antiferromagnetically ordered state at atmospheric pressure and\nzero magnetic field. The magnitude of ordered moments is $0.73(2) \\mu_{\\rm B}$.\nIt is much smaller than a classical value $\\sim 3 \\mu_{\\rm B}$.\nLongitudinal-mode magnetic excitations may be observable in single crystalline\nCrVMoO$_7$.\n", "  We explore aspects of the correspondence between Seifert 3-manifolds and 3d\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric theories with a distinguished abelian flavour\nsymmetry. We give a prescription for computing the squashed three-sphere\npartition functions of such 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories constructed from\nboundary conditions and interfaces in a 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theory, mirroring\nthe construction of Seifert manifold invariants via Dehn surgery. This is\nextended to include links in the Seifert manifold by the insertion of\nsupersymmetric Wilson-'t Hooft loops in the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theory. In the\npresence of a mass parameter for the distinguished flavour symmetry, we recover\naspects of refined Chern-Simons theory with complex gauge group, and in\nparticular construct an analytic continuation of the $S$-matrix of refined\nChern-Simons theory.\n", "  (Abridged) The formation of large-scale (hundreds to few thousands of AU)\nbipolar structures in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of post-Asymptotic\nGiant Branch (post-AGB) stars is poorly understood. The shape of these\nstructures, traced by emission from fast molecular outflows, suggests that the\ndynamics at the innermost regions of these CSEs does not depend only on the\nenergy of the radiation field of the central star. Deep into the Water\nFountains is an observational project based on the results of programs carried\nout with three telescope facilities: The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\n(JVLA), The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), and the Very Large\nTelescope (SINFONI-VLT). Here we report the results of the observations towards\nthe WF nebula IRAS 18043$-$2116: Detection of radio continuum emission in the\nfrequency range 1.5GHz - 8.0GHz; H$_{2}$O maser spectral features and radio\ncontinuum emission detected at 22GHz, and H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational emission lines\ndetected at the near infrared. The high-velocity H$_{2}$O maser spectral\nfeatures, and the shock-excited H$_{2}$ emission detected could be produced in\nmolecular layers which are swept up as a consequence of the propagation of a\njet-driven wind. Using the derived H$_{2}$ column density, we estimated a\nmolecular mass-loss rate of the order of $10^{-9}$M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. On the\nother hand, if the radio continuum flux detected is generated as a consequence\nof the propagation of a thermal radio jet, the mass-loss rate associated to the\noutflowing ionized material is of the order of 10$^{-5}$M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$.\nThe presence of a rotating disk could be a plausible explanation for the\nmass-loss rates estimated.\n", "  An observational constraint on the contribution of double degenerates to Type\nIa supernovae requires multiple radial velocity measurements of ideally\nthousands of white dwarfs. This is because only a small fraction of the double\ndegenerate population is massive enough, with orbital periods short enough, to\nbe considered viable Type Ia progenitors. We show how the radial velocity\ninformation available from public surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\ncan be used to pre-select targets for variability, leading to a ten-fold\nreduction in observing time required compared to an unranked or random survey.\nWe carry out Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the detection probability of\nvarious types of binaries in the survey and show that this method, even in the\nmost pessimistic case, doubles the survey size of the largest survey to date\n(the SPY survey) in less than 15 per cent of the required observing time. Our\ninitial follow-up observations corroborate the method, yielding 15 binaries so\nfar (eight known and seven new), as well as orbital periods for four of the new\nbinaries.\n", "  We explore the Euclidean supersymmetric solutions admitting the self-dual\ngauge field in the framework of ${\\cal N}=2$ minimal gauged supergravity in\nfour dimensions. According to the classification scheme utilizing the spinorial\ngeometry or the bilinears of Killing spinors, the general solution preserves\none quarter of supersymmetry and is described by the Przanowski-Tod class with\nthe self-dual Weyl tensor. We demonstrate that there exists an additional\nKilling spinor, provided the Przanowski-Tod metric admits a Killing vector that\ncommutes with the principal one. The proof proceeds by recasting the metric\ninto another Przanowski-Tod form. This formalism enables us to show that the\nself-dual Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-Taub-NUT-AdS metric possesses a second Killing\nspinor, which has been missed over many years. We also address the\nsupersymmetry when the Przanowski-Tod space is conformal to each of the\nself-dual ambi-toric K\\\"ahler metrics. It turns out that three classes of\nsolutions are all reduced to the self-dual Carter family, by virtue of the\nnondegenerate Killing-Yano tensor.\n", "  We show how to emulate a conventional pump-probe scheme using a single\nfrequency-chirped ultrashort UV pulse to obtain a time-resolved image of\nmolecular ultrafast dynamics. The chirp introduces a spectral phase in time\nthat encodes the delay between the pump and the probe frequencies contained in\nthe pulse. By comparing the results of full dimensional ab initio calculations\nfor the H$^+_2$ molecule with those of a simple sequential model, we\ndemonstrate that, by tuning the chirp parameter, two-photon energy-differential\nionization probabilities directly map the wave packet dynamics generated in the\nmolecule. As a result, one can also achieve a significant amount of control of\nthe total ionization yields, with a possible enhancement by more than an order\nof magnitude.\n", "  We investigate the influence of time-delayed coupling in a ring network of\nnon-locally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators upon chimera states, i.e.,\nspace-time patterns with coexisting partially coherent and partially incoherent\ndomains. We focus on amplitude chimeras which exhibit incoherent behavior with\nrespect to the amplitude rather than the phase and are transient patterns, and\nshow that their lifetime can be significantly enhanced by coupling delay. To\ncharacterize their transition to phase-lag synchronization (coherent traveling\nwaves) and other coherent structures, we generalize the Kuramoto order\nparameter. Contrasting the results for instantaneous coupling with those for\nconstant coupling delay, for time-varying delay, and for distributed-delay\ncoupling, we demonstrate that the lifetime of amplitude chimera states and\nrelated partially incoherent states can be controlled, i.e., deliberately\nreduced or increased, depending upon the type of coupling delay.\n", "  Message passing equations yield a sharp percolation transition in finite\ngraphs, as an artifact of the locally treelike approximation. For an arbitrary\nfinite, connected, undirected graph we construct an infinite tree having the\nsame local structural properties as this finite graph, when observed by a\nnonbacktracking walker. Formally excluding the boundary, this infinite tree is\na generalization of the Bethe lattice. We indicate an infinite, locally\ntreelike, random network whose local structure is exactly given by this\ninfinite tree. Message passing equations for various cooperative models on this\nconstruction are the same as for the original finite graph, but here they\nprovide the exact solutions of the corresponding cooperative problems. These\nsolutions are good approximations to observables for the models on the original\ngraph when it is sufficiently large and not strongly correlated. We show how to\nexpress these solutions in the critical region in terms of the principal\neigenvector components of the nonbacktracking matrix. As representative\nexamples we formulate the problems of the random and optimal destruction of a\nconnected graph in terms of our construction, the nonbacktracking expansion. We\nanalyze the limitations and the accuracy of the message passing algorithms for\ndifferent classes of networks and compare the complexity of the message passing\ncalculations to that of direct numerical simulations. Notably, in a range of\nimportant cases, simulations turn out to be more efficient computationally than\nthe message passing.\n", "  We discuss the production and evolution of cosmological gravitons showing how\nthe cosmological background affects their dynamics. Besides, the detection of\ncosmological gravitons could constitute an extremely important signature to\ndiscriminate among different cosmological models. Here we consider the cases of\nscalar-tensor gravity and $f(R)$ gravity where it is demonstrated the\namplification of graviton amplitude changes if compared with General\nRelativity. Possible observational constraints are discussed.\n", "  The extensive grid of numerical simulations of nova eruptions of Yaron et\nal.(2005) first predicted that some classical novae might deviate significantly\nfrom the Maximum Magnitude - Rate of Decline (MMRD) relation, which purports to\ncharacterise novae as standard candles. Kasliwal et al. (2011) have announced\nthe observational detection of an apparently new class of faint, fast classical\nnovae in the Andromeda galaxy. These objects deviate strongly from the MMRD\nrelationship, exactly as predicted by Yaron et al. (2005). Shara et al. (2016)\nrecently reported the first detections of faint, fast novae in M87. These\npreviously overlooked objects are as common in the giant elliptical galaxy M87\nas they are in the giant spiral M31; they comprise about 40% of all classical\nnova eruptions and greatly increase the observational scatter in the MMRD\nrelation. We use the extensive grid of nova simulations of Yaron et al. (2005)\nto identify the underlying causes of the existence of faint, fast novae. These\nare systems which have accreted, and can thus eject, only very low mass\nenvelopes, of order 10^-7 - 10^-8 Msun, on massive white dwarfs. Such binaries\ninclude, but are not limited to, the recurrent novae. These same models predict\nthe existence of ultrafast novae which display decline times t2 as short as\nfive hours. We outline a strategy for their future detection.\n", "  Swendsen-Wang dynamics for the Potts model was proposed in the late 1980's as\nan alternative to single-site heat-bath dynamics, in which global updates allow\nthis MCMC sampler to switch between metastable states and ideally mix faster.\nGore and Jerrum (1999) found that this dynamics may in fact exhibit slow\nmixing: they showed that, for the Potts model with $q\\geq 3$ colors on the\ncomplete graph on $n$ vertices at the critical point $\\beta_c(q)$,\nSwendsen-Wang dynamics has $t_{\\mathrm{mix}}\\geq \\exp(c\\sqrt n)$. The same\nlower bound was extended to the critical window $(\\beta_s,\\beta_S)$ around\n$\\beta_c$ by Galanis et al. (2015), as well as to the corresponding mean-field\nFK model by Blanca and Sinclair (2015). In both cases, an upper bound of\n$t_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\leq \\exp(c' n)$ was known. Here we show that the mixing time\nis truly exponential in $n$: namely, $t_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\geq \\exp (cn)$ for\nSwendsen-Wang dynamics when $q\\geq 3$ and $\\beta\\in(\\beta_s,\\beta_S)$, and the\nsame bound holds for the related MCMC samplers for the mean-field FK model when\n$q>2$.\n", "  Using an electron-positron collision data sample of 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ collected\nat a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=3.773$ GeV with the BESIII detector, we\npresent the first search for the radiative leptonic decay $D^{+} \\rightarrow\n\\gamma e^{+}{\\nu}_{e}$. The analysis is performed with a double tag method. We\ndo not observe a significant $D^{+} \\rightarrow \\gamma e^{+}{\\nu}_{e}$ signal,\nand obtain an upper limit on the branching fraction of $D^{+} \\rightarrow\n\\gamma e^{+}{\\nu}_{e}$ decay with the energy of radiative photon larger than 10\nMeV of $3.0\\times10^{-5}$ at the 90% confidence level.\n", "  The finite-frequency transport properties of a large-spin molecule attached\nto ferromagnetic contacts are studied theoretically in the Kondo regime. The\nfocus is on the behavior of the dynamical conductance in the linear response\nregime, which is determined by using the numerical renormalization group\nmethod. It is shown that the dynamical conductance depends greatly on the\nmagnetic configuration of the device and intrinsic parameters of the molecule.\nIn particular, conductance exhibits characteristic features for frequencies\ncorresponding to the dipolar and quadrupolar exchange fields resulting from the\npresence of spin-dependent tunneling. Moreover, a dynamical spin accumulation\nin the molecule, associated with the off-diagonal-in-spin component of the\nconductance, is predicted. This spin accumulation becomes enhanced with\nincreasing the spin polarization of the leads, and it results in a nonmonotonic\ndependence of the conductance on frequency, with local maxima occurring for\ncharacteristic energy scales.\n", "  We study the entanglement structure of states dual to multiboundary wormhole\ngeometries using tensor network models. Perfect and random tensor networks\ntiling the hyperbolic plane have been shown to provide good models of the\nentanglement structure in holography. We extend this by quotienting the plane\nby discrete isometries to obtain models of the multiboundary states. We show\nthat there are networks where the entanglement structure is purely bipartite,\nextending results obtained in the large temperature limit. We analyse the\nentanglement structure in a range of examples.\n", "  We study Andreev reflection and the Josephson effect in a ballistic monolayer\nof black phosphorous, known as phosphorene. Due to the anisotropic band\nstructure of this system, the supercurrent changes with an order of magnitude\nwhen comparing tunneling along two perpendicular directions in the monolayer.\nWe show that the main reason for this effect is a large difference in the\nnumber of transverse modes in Andreev bound states. The oscillatory behavior of\nthe supercurrent as a function of the length and chemical potential of the\njunction also differs substantially depending on the orientation of the\nsuperconducting electrodes deposited on the phosphorene sheet. For Andreev\nreflection, we show that a gate voltage controls the probability of this\nprocess and that the anisotropic behavior found in the supercurrent case is\nalso present for conductance spectra.\n", "  We present new Keck/NIRC2 3$-$5 $\\mu$m infrared photometry of the\nplanetary-mass companion to ROXS 42B in $L^\\prime$, and for the first time in\nBrackett-$\\alpha$ (Br$\\alpha$) and in $M_\\mathrm{s}$-band. We combine our data\nwith existing near-infrared photometry and $K$-band (2$-$2.4 $\\mu$m)\nspectroscopy and compare these with models and other directly imaged\nplanetary-mass objects using forward modeling and retrieval methods in order to\ncharacterize the atmosphere of ROXS 42B b. ROXS 42B b's 1.25$-$5 $\\mu$m\nspectral energy distribution most closely resembles that of GSC 06214 B and\n$\\kappa$ And b, although it has a slightly bluer $K_{\\rm s}$$-$$M_{\\rm s}$\ncolor than GSC 06214 B and thus so far lacks evidence for a circumplanetary\ndisk. We cannot formally exclude the possibility that any of the tested\ndust-free/dusty/cloudy forward models describe atmosphere of ROXS 42B b well.\nHowever, models with substantial atmospheric dust/clouds yield temperatures and\ngravities that are consistent when fit to photometry and spectra separately,\nwhereas dust-free model fits to photometry predict temperatures/gravities\ninconsistent with ROXS 42B b's $K$-band spectrum and vice-versa. Atmospheric\nretrieval on the 1$-$5 $\\mu$m photometry places a limit on the fractional\nnumber density of CO$_2$ of $\\log(n_{\\rm CO_2})<-2.7$ but provides no other\nconstraints so far. We conclude that ROXS 42B b has mid-IR photometric features\nthat are systematically different from other previously observed planetary-mass\nand field objects of similar temperature. It remains unclear whether this is in\nthe range of the natural diversity of targets at the very young ($\\sim$2 Myr)\nage of ROXS 42B b, or unique to its early evolution and environment.\n", "  Motivated by the proposal to simulate para-Bose oscillators in a trapped-ion\nsetup [C. Huerta Alderete and B. M. Rodr\\'iguez-Lara, Phys. Rev. A 95, 013820\n(2017)], we introduce an overcomplete, nonorthogonal basis for para-Bose\nHilbert spaces. The states spanning these bases can be experimentally realized\nin the trapped-ion simulation via time evolution. The para-Bose states show\nboth nonclassical and semiclassical statistics on their Fock state\ndistribution, asymmetric field quadrature variances, and do not minimize the\nuncertainty relation for the field quadratures. These properties are\nanalytically controlled by the para-Bose order and the evolution time; both\nparameters might be feasible for fine tuning in the trapped-ion quantum\nsimulation.\n", "  We present gas kinematics based on the [OIII] $\\lambda$5007 line and their\nconnection to galaxy gravitational potential, active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nenergetics, and star formation, using a large sample of ~110,000 AGNs and\nstar-forming (SF) galaxies at z<0.3. Gas and stellar velocity dispersions are\ncomparable to each other in SF galaxies, indicating that the ionized gas\nkinematics can be accounted by the gravitational potential of host galaxies. In\ncontrast, AGNs clearly show non-gravitational kinematics, which is comparable\nto or stronger than the virial motion caused by the gravitational potential.\nThe [OIII] velocity-velocity dispersion (VVD) diagram dramatically expands\ntoward high values as a function of AGN luminosity, implying that the outflows\nare AGN-driven, while SF galaxies do not show such a trend. We find that the\nfraction of AGNs with a signature of outflow kinematics, steeply increases with\nAGN luminosity and Eddington ratio. In particular, the majority of luminous\nAGNs presents strong non-gravitational kinematics in the [OIII] profile. AGNs\nwith strong outflow signatures show on average similar specific star formation\nrate (SSFR) to that of starforming galaxies. In contrast, AGNs with weak or no\noutflows have an order of magnitude lower SSFR, suggesting that AGNs with\ncurrent strong outflows do now show any negative AGN feedback and that it may\ntake the order of a dynamical time to impact on star formation over galactic\nscales.\n", "  We extend a known multi-quark three-flavor Lagrangian of the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio type, which includes a set of effective interactions\nproportional to the current quark masses, to include the multi-quark\ninteractions of vector and axial-vector types. It is shown that the mass\nspectrum of the four low-lying meson nonets are in agreement with current\nphenomenological expectations. The role of the new interactions is analyzed in\ndetail.\n", "  Recently it was suggested that stationary spin supercurrents (spin\nsuperfluidity) are possible in the magnon condensate observed in\nyttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) magnetic films under strong external pumping. Here we\nanalyze this suggestion. From topology of the equilibrium order parameter in\nYIG one must not expect energetic barriers making spin supercurrents\nmetastable. However some small barriers of dynamical origin are possible\nnevertheless. The critical phase gradient (analog of the Landau critical\nvelocity in superfluids) is proportional to intensity of the coherent spin wave\n(number of condensed magnons). The conclusion is that although spin\nsuperfluidity in YIG films is possible in principle, the published claim of its\nobservation is not justified.\n  The analysis revealed that the widely accepted spin-wave spectrum in YIG\nfilms with magnetostatic and exchange interaction required revision. This led\nto revision of non-linear corrections, which determine stability of the magnon\ncondensate with and without spin supercurrents.\n", "  We propose to use degree-scale angular clustering of fast radio bursts (FRBs)\nto identify their origin and the host galaxy population. We study the\ninformation content in autocorrelation of the angular positions and dispersion\nmeasures (DM) and in cross-correlation with galaxies. We show that the\ncross-correlation with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies will place\nstringent constraints on the mean physical quantities associated with FRBs. If\n$\\sim$10,000 FRBs are detected with $\\lesssim \\rm deg$ resolution in the SDSS\nfield, the clustering analysis with the intrinsic DM scatter of $100\\, {\\rm\npc}/{\\rm cm}^3$ can constrain the global abundance of free electrons at $z\\lt1$\nand the large-scale bias of FRB host galaxies (the statistical relation between\nthe distribution of host galaxies and cosmic matter density field) with\nfractional errors (with a $68\\%$ confidence level) of $\\sim10\\%$ and\n$\\sim20\\%$, respectively. The mean near-source dispersion measure and the delay\ntime distribution of FRB rates relative to the global star forming rate can be\nalso determined by combining the clustering and the probability distribution\nfunction of DM. Our approach will be complementary to high-resolution ($\\ll\n{\\rm deg}$) event localization using e.g., VLA and VLBI for identifying the\norigin of FRBs and the source environment. We strongly encourage future\nobservational programs such as CHIME, UTMOST, and HIRAX to survey FRBs in the\nSDSS field.\n", "  We provide a description of spontaneous emission in a dispersive and\ndissipative linear inhomogeneous medium based on the generalized\nHuttner-Barnett model [Phys. Rev. A 46, 4306 (1992)]. Our discussion considers\non an equal footing both the photonic and material fluctuations which are\nnecessary to preserve unitarity of the quantum evolution. Within this approach\nwe justify the results obtained in the past using the Langevin noise method\nthat neglects the removal of photonic fluctuations. We finally discuss the\nconcept of local density of states (LDOS) in a lossy and dispersive\ninhomogeneous environment that provides a basis for theoretical studies of\nfluorescent emitters near plasmonic and polaritonic antennas.\n", "  Magnetic monopoles are suggested to play an important role in strongly\ncoupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) near the deconfinement temperature. So far,\ntheir many-body treatment has only been done classically, with just binary\nscattering solved in quantum mechanics. In this paper we start quantum\nmany-body studies of the monopole ensembles. Specifically, we carry out\nnumerical simulations of the path integral for one- and two-component Coulomb\nBose systems. We determine the relation between the critical temperature for\nthe Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition $T_\\text{c}$ and the Coulomb\ncoupling strength using two methods, the classic finite-size scaling of the\ncondensate and a lattice-tested method based on permutation cycles. For a\none-component Coulomb Bose gas, we observe the same behavior of the critical\ntemperature -- initially rising slightly then falling as interaction strength\nis increased -- as seen in the case of hard spheres; we also observe the same\nbehavior for a two-component Coulomb Bose gas. We then calculate sets of radial\ncorrelation functions between the like and unlike charged particles. By\nmatching those with the correlation functions previously calculated on the\nlattice, we derive an effective quantum model of color magnetic monopoles in\nQCD. From this matched model, we are able to extract the monopole contribution\nto QCD equation of state near $T_\\text{c}$.\n", "  To investigate the existence of sterile neutrino, we propose a new neutrino\nproduction method using $^{13}$C beams and a $^{9}$Be target for short-baseline\nelectron antineutrino (${\\bar{\\nu}}_{e}$) disappearance study. The production\nof secondary unstable isotopes which can emit neutrinos from the $^{13}$C +\n$^{9}$Be reaction is calculated with three different nucleus-nucleus (AA)\nreaction models. Different isotope yields are obtained using these models, but\nthe results of the neutrino flux are found to have unanimous similarities. This\nfeature gives an opportunity to study neutrino oscillation through shape\nanalysis. In this work, expected neutrino flux and event rates are discussed in\ndetail through intensive simulation of the light ion collision reaction and the\nneutrino flux from the beta decay of unstable isotopes followed by this\ncollision. Together with the reactor and accelerator anomalies, the present\nproposed ${\\bar{\\nu}}_{e}$ source is shown to be a practically alternative test\nof the existence of the $\\Delta m^{2}$ $\\sim$ 1 eV$^{2}$ scale sterile\nneutrino.\n", "  In this paper we have studied particle collision around a spinning dilaton\nblack hole in 2 +1 dimensions. This black hole is a solution to the low energy\nstring theory in 2+1 dimensions. Time-like geodesics are presented in detail\nand the center of mass energy of two particles collision at the horizon of a\nspinning black hole is considered. We noticed that there is a possibility of\nthe two masses to create infinite center of mass energy.\n", "  We examine the phase behavior of a quasi-one-dimensional system of hard\nsquares with side-length $\\sigma$, where the particles are confined between two\nparallel walls and only nearest neighbor interactions occur. As in our previous\nwork (PRE, 94, 050603 (2016)), the transfer operator method is used, but here\nwe impose a restricted orientation and position approximation to yield an\nanalytic description of the physical properties. This allows us to study the\nparallel fluid-like to zigzag solid-like structural transition, where the\ncompressibility and heat capacity peaks sharpen and get higher as $H\n\\rightarrow H_c=2\\sqrt{2}-1\\approx 1.8284$ and $p \\rightarrow p_c= \\infty$.\nHere $H$ is the width of the channel measured in $\\sigma$ units and $p$ is the\npressure. We have found that this structural change becomes critical at the\n$(p_c,H_c)$ point. The obtained critical exponents belong to the universality\nclass of the one-dimensional Ising model. We believe this behavior holds for\nthe unrestricted orientational and positional case.\n", "  Quantum digital signatures (QDS) provide a means for signing electronic\ncommunications with informationtheoretic security. However, all previous\ndemonstrations of quantum digital signatures assume trusted measurement\ndevices. This renders them vulnerable against detector side-channel attacks,\njust like quantum key distribution. Here, we exploit a\nmeasurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum network, over a\n200-square-kilometer metropolitan area, to perform a field test of a\nthree-party measurement-device-independent quantum digital signature (MDI-QDS)\nscheme that is secure against any detector side-channel attack. In so doing, we\nare able to successfully sign a binary message with a security level of about\n1E-7. Remarkably, our work demonstrates the feasibility of MDI-QDS for\npractical applications.\n", "  The Poincar\\'e gauge gravity (PGG) with the underlying vector fields of\ntetrads and spin-connections is perhaps the best theory candidate for\ngravitation to be unified with the other three elementary forces of nature.\nThere is a clear analogy between local frame in PGG and local internal symmetry\nspace in the Standard Model. As a result, the spin-connection fields, gauging\nthe local frame Lorentz symmetry group SO(1,3)_{LF}, appear in PGG much as\nphotons and gluons appear in SM. We propose that such an analogy may follow\nfrom their common emergent nature allowing to derive PGG in the same way as\nconventional gauge theories. In essence, we start with an arbitrary theory of\nsome vector and fermion fields which possesses only global spacetime\nsymmetries, such as Lorentz and translational invariance, in flat Minkowski\nspace. The two vector field multiplets involved are proposed to belong,\nrespectively, to the adjoint (A_{{\\mu}}^{ij}) and vector (e_{{\\mu}}^{i})\nrepresentations of the starting global Lorentz symmetry. We show that if these\nprototype vector fields are covariantly constrained,\nA_{{\\mu}}^{ij}A_{ij}^{{\\mu}}=M_{A} and e_{{\\mu}}^{i}e_{i}^{{\\mu}}=M_{e}, thus\ncausing a spontaneous violation of the accompanying global symmetries (M_{A,e}\nare their proposed violation scales), then the only possible theory compatible\nwith these length-preserving constraints is turned out to be the gauge\ninvariant PGG, while the corresponding massless (pseudo)Goldstone modes are\nnaturally collected in the emergent gauge fields of tetrads and\nspin-connections. In a minimal theory case being linear in a curvature we\nunavoidably come to the Einstein-Cartan theory. The extending theories with\npropagating spin-connection and tetrad modes are also considered and their\npossible unification with the Standard Model is briefly discussed.\n", "  We study impurity scattering in the normal and d-wave superconducting states\nof line nodal semimetals and show that, due to additional scattering phase\nspace available for impurities on the surface, the quasiparticle interference\npattern acquires an extended character instead of a discrete collection of\ndelta function peaks. Moreover, using the T-matrix formalism, we demonstrate\nthat the conventional behavior of a scalar impurity in a d-wave superconductor\nbreaks down on the surface of a line nodal semimetal in the quasi flat band\nlimit.\n", "  Black hole X-ray binaries undergo occasional outbursts caused by changing\ninner accretion flows. Here we report high-angular resolution radio\nobservations of the 2013 outburst of the black hole candidate X-ray binary\nsystem J1908+094, using data from the VLBA and EVN. We show that following a\nhard-to-soft state transition, we detect moving jet knots that appear\nasymmetric in morphology and brightness, and expand to become laterally\nresolved as they move away from the core, along an axis aligned approximately\n$-11$\\degree\\ east of north. We initially see only the southern component,\nwhose evolution gives rise to a 15-mJy radio flare and generates the observed\nradio polarization. This fades and becomes resolved out after 4 days, after\nwhich a second component appears to the north, moving in the opposite\ndirection. From the timing of the appearance of the knots relative to the X-ray\nstate transition, a 90\\degree\\ swing of the inferred magnetic field\norientation, the asymmetric appearance of the knots, their complex and evolving\nmorphology, and their low speeds, we interpret the knots as working surfaces\nwhere the jets impact the surrounding medium. This would imply a substantially\ndenser environment surrounding XTE J1908+094 than has been inferred to exist\naround the microquasar sources GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40.\n", "  Removing the aberrations introduced by the Point Spread Function (PSF) is a\nfundamental aspect of astronomical image processing. The presence of noise in\nobserved images makes deconvolution a nontrivial task that necessitates the use\nof regularisation. This task is particularly difficult when the PSF varies\nspatially as is the case for the Euclid telescope. New surveys will provide\nimages containing thousand of galaxies and the deconvolution regularisation\nproblem can be considered from a completely new perspective. In fact, one can\nassume that galaxies belong to a low-rank dimensional space. This work\nintroduces the use of the low-rank matrix approximation as a regularisation\nprior for galaxy image deconvolution and compares its performance with a\nstandard sparse regularisation technique. This new approach leads to a natural\nway to handle a space variant PSF. Deconvolution is performed using a Python\ncode that implements a primal-dual splitting algorithm. The data set considered\nis a sample of 10 000 space-based galaxy images convolved with a known\nspatially varying Euclid-like PSF and including various levels of Gaussian\nadditive noise. Performance is assessed by examining the deconvolved galaxy\nimage pixels and shapes. The results demonstrate that for small samples of\ngalaxies sparsity performs better in terms of pixel and shape recovery, while\nfor larger samples of galaxies it is possible to obtain more accurate estimates\nof the galaxy shapes using the low-rank approximation.\n", "  The production of the vector meson pairs $B_s^* \\bar B_s^*$ in the $e^+e^-$\nannihilation is generally contributed by two $P$ wave amplitudes with different\ntotal spin $S$ of the mesons, $S=0$ and $S=2$, and also by an $F$ wave\namplitude. Belle has recently reported a study of the available data at the\nenergy of the $\\Upsilon(5S)$ peak in terms of the two $P$ wave contributions\nonly. It is argued here that although at this energy the $F$ wave should be\nquite suppressed, especially for the strange-bottom vector mesons, the\nparticular studied angular distribution is very sensitive to a presence of even\nsmall $F$ wave amplitude due to a significant interference with the dominant\n$S=2$ $P$ wave. Thus the available data are not conclusive with regards to the\npartial wave structure of the production amplitude. Additional angular\ncorrelations are discussed that can be measured for a full amplitude analysis\nof the production process.\n", "  We present spectroscopy of 880 galaxies within a 2-degree field around the\nmassive, merging cluster Abell 3266. This sample, which includes 704 new\nmeasurements, was combined with the existing redshifts measurements to generate\na sample of over 1300 spectroscopic redshifts; the largest spectroscopic sample\nin the vicinity of A3266 to date. We define a cluster sub-sample of 790\nredshifts which lie within a velocity range of 14,000 to 22,000 kms$^{-1}$ and\nwithin 1 degree of the cluster centre. A detailed structural analysis finds\nA3266 to have a complex dynamical structure containing six groups and filaments\nto the north of the cluster as well as a cluster core which can be decomposed\ninto two components split along a northeast-southwest axis, consistent with\nprevious X-ray observations. The mean redshift of the cluster core is found to\nbe $0.0594 \\pm 0.0005$ and the core velocity dispersion is given as\n$1462^{+99}_{-99}$ kms$^{-1}$. The overall velocity dispersion and redshift of\nthe entire cluster and related structures are $1337^{+67}_{-67}$ kms$^{-1}$ and\n$0.0596 \\pm 0.0002$, respectively, though the high velocity dispersion does not\nrepresent virialised motions but rather is due to relative motions of the\ncluster components. We posit A3266 is seen following a merger along the\nnortheast southwest axis, however, the rich substructure in the rest of the\ncluster suggests that the dynamical history is more complex than just a simple\nmerger with a range of continuous dynamical interactions taking place. It is\nthus likely that turbulence in A3266 is very high, even for a merging cluster.\n", "  Space-based photometric surveys have discovered large numbers of planets\ntransiting other stars, but these observe in a single band-pass and yield only\nthe planet radius, orbital period, and transit duration. Information on the\nmasses, compositions, and any atmospheres of these planets requires additional\nobservations from the ground or space. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite (TESS) will yield thousands of planets around bright stars suitable\nfor such follow-up. In the absence of spectroscopy or spectrophotometry from\nspace, observations through the different pass-bands of multiple space\ntelescopes provide some spectral information useful for identifying false\npositive signals, distinguishing between reflected light and thermal emission\nfrom hot Jupiters, and detecting Rayleigh scattering by planetary atmospheres.\nWe calculated the expected difference in transit depths measured by the TESS\nand Characterizing Exoplanets Satellites (CHEOPS) missions, which will be more\nsensitive to redder and bluer optical wavelengths, respectively. The difference\ndue to companion or background stars is small (<3% for main sequence\ncompanions) and likely to be negligible and undetectable. For only a few \"hot\"\nJupiters, can combined photometry disambiguate between the reflected and\nthermal signals from planets. However, Rayleigh scattering by hazy atmospheres\nwith particles sizes near 0.04 $\\mu$m and at pressure altitudes above ~1 mbar\ncan be detected for ~100 transiting planets, assuming every planet has such an\natmosphere. Hazes with this characteristic particle size do not obscure\nobservations at longer (near-infrared) wavelengths; CHEOPS follow-up of\nTESS-detected planets could thus identify candidates suitable for further study\nwith the James Webb Space Telescope.\n", "  We present the results of our investigation of the star-forming complexes W51\nand W43, two of the brightest in the first Galactic quadrant. In order to\ndetermine the young stellar object (YSO) populations in W51 and W43 we used\ncolor-magnitude relations based on Spitzer mid-infrared and 2MASS/UKIDSS\nnear-infrared data. We identified 302 Class I YSOs and 1178 Class II/transition\ndisk candidates in W51, and 917 Class I YSOs and 5187 Class II/transition disk\ncandidates in W43. We also identified tens of groups of YSOs in both regions\nusing the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) method. We found similar cluster\ndensities in both regions even though Spitzer was not able to probe the densest\npart of W43. By using the Class II/I ratios, we traced the relative ages within\nthe regions and based on the morphology of the clusters we argue that several\nsites of star formation are independent of one another in terms of their ages\nand physical conditions. We used spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitting to\nidentify the massive YSO (MYSO) candidates since they play a vital role in the\nstar formation process and then examined them to see if they are related to any\nmassive star formation tracers such as UCH II regions, masers and dense\nfragments. We identified 17 MYSO candidates in W51, and 14 in W43, respectively\nand found that groups of YSOs hosting MYSO candidates are positionally\nassociated with H II regions in W51, though we do not see any MYSO candidates\nassociated with previously identified massive dense fragments in W43.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the implications of having a varying second\nslow-roll index on the canonical scalar field inflationary dynamics. We shall\nbe interested in cases that the second slow-roll can take small values and\ncorrespondingly large values, for limiting cases of the function that\nquantifies the variation of the second slow-roll index. As we demonstrate, this\ncan naturally introduce a smooth transition between slow-roll and constant-roll\neras. We discuss the theoretical implications of the mechanism we introduce and\nwe use various illustrative examples in order to better understand the new\nfeatures that the varying second slow-roll index introduces. In the examples we\nwill present, the second slow-roll index has exponential dependence on the\nscalar field, and in one of these cases, the slow-roll era corresponds to a\ntype of $\\alpha$-attractor inflation. Finally, we briefly discuss how the\ncombination of slow-roll and constant-roll may lead to non-Gaussianities in the\nprimordial perturbations.\n", "  Mass outflow generated by the dynamical feedback from massive stars is\ncurrently a topic of high interest. Using a purpose-developed analysis\ntechnique, and taking full advantage of the high kinematic and angular\nresolution of our instrument we have detected a number of expanding\nsuperbubbles in the interacting pair of galaxies Arp 244 (NGC 4038/9) commonly\nknown as the Antennae. We use a Fabry-P\\'erot interferometer GH{\\alpha}FaS to\nmeasure the profile of H{\\alpha} in emission over the full extent of the\nobject, except for the extended HI tails. The superbubbles are found centred on\nmost of the brightest HII regions, especially in the overlap area of the two\nmerging galaxies. We use measured sizes, expansion velocities and luminosities\nof the shells to estimate most of the physical parameters of the bubbles,\nincluding the kinetic energy of the expansion. In order to assess the validity\nof our results and approximations we perform a hydrodynamic simulation and\nmanage to reproduce well our best measured superbubble with reasonable physical\ninput assumptions. We also study the sources of ionization of the shells,\nfinding that at the current, quite late stage of expansion, radiation from the\nremaining stars dominates, though the effect of supernova shocks can still be\nnoted.\n", "  We calculate the spectrum of the Andreev bound states in a one-dimensional\nsuperconductor with a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We focus on the fate\nof the zero-energy Andreev modes in the presence of time reversal\nsymmetry-breaking perturbations, both at the boundary and in the bulk. It is\nshown that the zero modes are destroyed by time reversal symmetry-breaking\nfluctuations, even if the mean-field state of the system is time-reversal\ninvariant and topologically nontrivial.\n", "  Although conjunctions and oppositions frequently occur in planetary systems,\neclipse-related phenomena are usually described from an Earth-centric\nperspective. Space missions to different parts of the Solar system, as well as\nthe mounting number of known exo-planets in habitable zones and the possibility\nof sending featherweight robot spacecraft to them, prompt broader\nconsiderations. Here, we derive the geometry of eclipses, transits and\noccultations from a primarily exo-Earth viewpoint, and apply the formulation to\nthe Solar system and three types of three-body extrasolar planetary systems:\nwith 1 star and 2 planets (Case I), with 2 stars and 1 planet (Case II), and\nwith 1 planet, 1 star and 1 moon (Case III). We derive the general conditions\nfor total, partial and annular eclipses to occur at exo-syzygy, and implement\nthem in each case in concert with stability criteria. We then apply the\nformalism to the TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-444 and Kepler-77 systems -- the first of\nwhich contains multiple potentially habitable planets -- and provide reference\ntables of both Solar system and TRAPPIST-1 syzygy properties. We conclude by\ndetailing a basic algebraic algorithm which can be used to quickly characterize\neclipse properties in any three-body system.\n", "  In this paper, we report the evidence for a planetary mass body orbiting the\nclose binary star KIC 5095269. This detection arose from a search for eclipse\ntiming variations among the more than 2,000 eclipsing binaries observed by\nKepler. Light curve and periodic eclipse time variations have been analysed\nusing Systemic and a custom Binary Eclipse Timings code based on the Transit\nAnalysis Package which indicates a $7.70\\pm0.08M_{Jup}$ object orbiting every\n$237.7\\pm0.1d$ around a $1.2M_\\odot$ primary and $0.51M_\\odot$ secondary in an\n18.6d orbit. A dynamical integration over $10^7$ years suggests a stable\norbital configuration. Radial velocity observations are recommended to confirm\nthe properties of the binary star components and the planetary mass of the\ncompanion.\n", "  W4 is a giant H{\\sc ii} region ionized by the OB stars of the cluster\nIC~1805. The H{\\sc ii} region/cluster complex has been a subject of numerous\ninvestigations as it is an excellent laboratory for studying the feedback\neffect of massive stars on the surrounding region. However, the low-mass\nstellar content of the cluster IC~1805 remains poorly studied till now. With\nthe aim to unravel the low-mass stellar population of the cluster, we present\nthe results of a multiwavelength study based on deep optical data obtained with\nthe Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, infrared data from 2MASS, $Spitzer$ Space\nTelescope and X-ray data from $Chandra$ Space Telescope. The present optical\ndataset is complete enough to detect stars down to 0.2~M$_\\odot$, which is the\ndeepest optical observations so far for the cluster. We identified 384\ncandidate young stellar objects (YSOs; 101 Class I/II and 283 Class III) within\nthe cluster using various colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams. We\ninferred the mean age of the identified YSOs to be $\\sim$ 2.5 Myr and mass in\nthe range 0.3 - 2.5 M$_\\odot$. The mass function of our YSO sample has a power\nlaw index of -1.23 $\\pm$ 0.23, close to the Salpeter value (-1.35), and\nconsistent with those of other star-forming complexes. We explored the disk\nevolution of the cluster members and found that the diskless sources are\nrelatively older compared to the disk bearing YSO candidates. We examined the\neffect of high-mass stars on the circumstellar disks and found that within\nuncertainties, the influence of massive stars on the disk fraction seems to be\ninsignificant. We also studied the spatial correlation of the YSOs with the\ndistribution of gas and dust of the complex to conclude that IC 1805 would have\nformed in a large filamentary cloud.\n", "  Both classical and quantum dynamics of the synchronization between two\nnonlinear mechanical modes scattered from Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by\nthe standing-wave laser beam are comparatively investigated. As the ultra-low\ndissipations of the momentum modes in the atomic BECs, the synchronized\ndynamics are studied in a framework of closed-system theory in order to track\ndown both the classical and the quantum synchronizations from an angle of\nquantum control. The classical synchronization and the relevant dynamics of\nmeasure synchronization, the quantum synchronization and two different types of\nmeasures proposed by Mari and estimated by mutual information based on\n$Q$-function are studied respectively in order to reveal both the macroscopic\nand the microscopic signatures of synchronized behaviors in a closed quantum\nsystem. The results demonstrate that the \"revival and collapse\" of the quantum\nfluctuations beyond the classical mean-value dynamics due to long-lasting mode\ncoherence discriminates the quantum synchronization from the classical one,\nwhich not only excludes the possibilities of an exact synchronization and a\nperfect density overlap in phase space, but also leads to upper limitations to\nMari measure and large unceasing fluctuations to mutual information between two\nscattering modes. We reveal a close dynamic connection between Mari measure and\nthe mutual information of two nonlinear momentum modes in closed BEC systems by\ndemonstrating an opposite mean-value behavior but a similar fluctuation\nvariation with respect to their respective evolutionary scales.\n", "  We continue the study of the first sample of shear-selected clusters (Wittman\net al. 2006) from the initial 8.6 square degrees of the Deep Lens Survey (DLS,\nWittman et al. 2002); a sample with well-defined selection criteria\ncorresponding to the highest ranked shear peaks in the survey area. We aim to\ncharacterize the weak lensing selection by examining the sample's X-ray\nproperties. There are multiple X-ray clusters associated with nearly all the\nshear peaks: 14 X-ray clusters corresponding to seven DLS shear peaks. An\nadditional three X-ray clusters cannot be definitively associated with shear\npeaks, mainly due to large positional offsets between the X-ray centroid and\nthe shear peak. Here we report on the X-ray properties of the 17 X-ray\nclusters. The X-ray clusters display a wide range of luminosities and\ntemperatures; the Lx-Tx relation we determine for the shear-associated X-ray\nclusters is consistent with X-ray cluster samples selected without regard to\ndynamical state, while it is inconsistent with self-similarity. For a subset of\nthe sample, we measure X-ray masses using temperature as a proxy, and compare\nto weak lensing masses determined by the DLS team (Abate et al. 2009; Wittman\net al. 2014). The resulting mass comparison is consistent with equality. The\nX-ray and weak lensing masses show considerable intrinsic scatter (~48%), which\nis consistent with X-ray selected samples when their X-ray and weak lensing\nmasses are independently determined.\n", "  Multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) polarimetry observation of\nthe GHz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) quasar OQ172 (J1445+0958) has been performed at\n1.6, 2.2, 4.8, 8.3 and 15.3 GHz in 2005. Core-jet structures are detected in\nall bands with the jet strongly bent at about 3 mas from the core. The radio\nemission of the source is polarised at all five bands. We study the Faraday\nRotation in the core and jet components at all five bands, and find good linear\nfits of Faraday Rotation in the core and jet components at 4.8 and 8.3 GHz. At\nthese two frequencies, the Rotation Measure (RM) is $\\sim 2000~\\rm rad~m^{-2}$\nin the core and $\\sim 700~\\rm rad~m^{-2}$ in the inner jet components and\ncontinues to decrease at the outer jet parts. We find that the depolarisation\nat 4.8 and 8.3 GHz might be caused by the internal medium in the source. We\ninvestigate consistency of the turnover spectra of VLBI components with the\nSynchrotron Self-Absorption (SSA) and Free-Free Absorption (FFA) models.\nAlthough these two models can not be easily distinguished due to the lack of\nlow-frequency data, the physical parameters can be constrained for each model.\nWe find that the large width of the $\\rm [OIII]_{5007}$ line is likely caused\nby a jet interaction with a Narrow Line Region (NLR) medium. The jet bending,\nsignificant RM variations, Faraday depolarisation, spectral turnover, and broad\nline width of $\\rm [OIII]_{5007}$ could be closely related, likely caused by\nthe same nucleus medium, presumably NLR.\n", "  We describe a model where breaking of W3 symmetry will lead to the emergence\nof time and subsequently of space. Surprisingly the simplest such models which\nlead to higher dimensional spacetimes are based on the four \"magical\" Jordan\nalgebras of 3x3 Hermitian matrices with real, complex, quaternion and octonion\nentries, respectively. The simplest symmetry breaking leads to universes with\nspacetime dimensions 3, 4, 6, and 10.\n", "  We compare two rotationally invariant decomposition techniques on linear\npolarisation data: the spin-2 spherical harmonic decomposition in two opposite\nparities, the $E$- and $B$-mode, and the multiscale analysis of the gradient of\nlinear polarisation, $|\\nabla \\mathbf{P}|$. We demonstrate that both\ndecompositions have similar properties in the image domain and the spatial\nfrequency domain. They can be used as complementary tools for turbulence\nanalysis of interstellar magnetic fields in order to develop a better\nunderstanding of the origin of energy sources for the turbulence, the origin of\npeculiar magnetic field structures and their underlying physics. We also\nintroduce a new quantity $|\\nabla EB|$ based on the $E$- and $B$-modes and we\nshow that in the intermediate and small scales limit $|\\nabla EB| \\simeq\n|\\nabla \\mathbf{P}|$. Analysis of the 2.3 GHz S-band Polarization All Sky\nSurvey (S -PASS) shows many extended coherent filament-like features appearing\nas 'double-jumps' in the $|\\nabla \\mathbf{P}|$ map that are correlated with\nnegative and positive filaments of $B$-type polarisation. These local\nasymmetries between the two polarisation types, $E$ and $B$, of the non-thermal\nGalactic synchrotron emission have an influence on the $E$- and $B$-mode power\nspectra analyses. The wavelet-based formalism of the polarisation gradient\nanalysis allows us to locate the position of $E$- or $B$-mode features\nresponsible for the local asymmetries between the two polarisation types. In\nanalysed subregions, the perturbations of the magnetic field are trigged by\nstar clusters associated with HII regions, the Orion-Eridanus superbubble and\nthe North Polar Spur at low Galactic latitude.\n", "  We present the first NuSTAR observation of a 'true' Type 2 Seyfert galaxy.\nThe 3-40 keV X-ray spectrum of NGC3147 is characterised by a simple power-law,\nwith a standard {\\Gamma}~1.7 and an iron emission line, with no need for any\nfurther component up to ~40 keV. These spectral properties, together with\nsignificant variability on time-scales as short as weeks (as shown in a 2014\nSwift monitoring campaign), strongly support an unobscured line-of-sight for\nthis source. An alternative scenario in terms of a Compton-thick source is\nstrongly disfavoured, requiring an exceptional geometrical configuration,\nwhereas a large fraction of the solid angle to the source is filled by a highly\nionised gas, whose reprocessed emission would dominate the observed luminosity.\nMoreover, in this scenario the implied intrinsic X-ray luminosity of the source\nwould be much larger than the value predicted by other luminosity proxies, like\nthe [OIII]{\\lambda}5007 emission line extinction-corrected luminosity.\nTherefore, we confirm with high confidence that NGC3147 is a true Type 2\nSeyfert galaxy, intrinsically characterised by the absence of a BLR.\n", "  We present the third paper about our ongoing HST survey for the search for\nmultiple stellar populations (MPs) within Magellanic Cloud clusters. We report\nhere the analysis of NGC 419, a $\\sim 1.5$ Gyr old, massive ($\\gtrsim 2 \\times\n10^5 \\, {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$) star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). By\ncomparing our photometric data with stellar isochrones, we set a limit on\n[N/Fe] enhancement of $\\lesssim$+0.5 dex and hence we find that no MPs are\ndetected in this cluster. This is surprising because, in the first two papers\nof this series, we found evidence for MPs in 4 other SMC clusters (NGC 121;\nLindsay 1, NGC 339, NGC 416), aged from 6 Gyr up to $\\sim 10-11$ Gyr. This\nfinding raises the question whether age could play a major role in the MPs\nphenomenon. Additionally, our results appear to exclude mass or environment as\nthe only key factors regulating the existence of a chemical enrichment, since\nall clusters studied so far in this survey are equally massive ($\\sim 1-2\n\\times 10^5 \\, {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$) and no particular patterns are found when\nlooking at their spatial distribution in the SMC.\n", "  Since CoRoT observations unveiled the very low amplitude modes that form a\nflat plateau in the power spectrum structure of delta Scuti stars, the nature\nof this phenomenon, including the possibility of spurious signals due to the\nlight curve analysis, has been a matter of long-standing scientific debate. We\ncontribute to this debate by finding the structural parameters of a sample of\nfour delta Scuti stars, CID 546, CID 3619, CID 8669, and KIC 5892969, and\nlooking for a possible relation between these stars' structural parameters and\ntheir power spectrum structure. For the purposes of characterization, we\ndeveloped a method of studying and analysing the power spectrum with high\nprecision and have applied it to both CoRoT and Kepler light curves. We obtain\nthe best estimates to date of these stars' structural parameters. Moreover, we\nobserve that the power spectrum structure depends on the inclination,\noblateness, and convective efficiency of each star. Our results suggest that\nthe power spectrum structure is real and is possibly formed by 2-period island\nmodes and chaotic modes.\n", "  We present a comparison of void properties between the standard model of\ncosmology, $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM), and two alternative\ncosmological models with evolving and interacting dark sectors: a quintessence\nmodel ($\\phi$CDM) and a Coupled Dark Matter-Dark Energy (CDE) model. Using\n$N$-body simulations of these models, we derive several measures of void\nstatistics and properties, including distributions of void volume, ellipticity,\nprolateness, and average density. We find that the volume distribution derived\nfrom the CDE simulation deviates from the volume distribution derived from the\n$\\Lambda$CDM simulation in the present-day universe, suggesting that the\npresence of a coupled dark sector could be observable through this statistic.\nWe also find that the distributions of void ellipticity and prolateness are\npractically indistinguishable among the three models over the redshift range\n$z=0.0-1.0$, indicating that simple void shape statistics are insensitive to\nsmall changes in dark sector physics. Interestingly, we find that the\ndistributions of average void density measured in each of the three simulations\nare distinct from each other. In particular, voids on average tend to be\nemptiest under a quintessence model, and densest under the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nOur results suggest that it is the scalar field present in both alternative\nmodels that causes emptier voids to form, while the coupling of the dark sector\nmitigates this effect by slowing down the evacuation of matter from voids.\n", "  We present the discovery of rotation in quenched, low-mass early-type\ngalaxies that are isolated. This finding challenges the claim that (all)\nrotating dwarf early-type galaxies in clusters were once spiral galaxies that\nhave since been harassed and transformed into early-type galaxies. Our search\nof the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data within the Local volume ($z<0.02$) has\nyielded a sample of 46 galaxies with a stellar mass $M_\\star \\lesssim\n5\\times10^9$ M$_\\odot$ (median $M_\\star \\sim 9.29 \\times 10^8$ M$_\\odot$), a\nlow H$\\alpha$ equivalent width EW$_{{\\rm H}\\alpha}< 2$ \\AA, and no massive\nneighbour ($M_{\\star}\\gtrsim3 \\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$) within a velocity\ninterval of $\\Delta V = 500$ km s$^{-1}$ and a projected distance of $\\sim$1\nMpc. Nine of these galaxies were subsequently observed with Keck ESI and their\nradial kinematics are presented here. These extend out to the half-light radius\n$R_e$ in the best cases, and beyond $R_e/2$ for all. They reveal a variety of\nbehaviours similar to those of a comparison sample of early-type dwarf galaxies\nin the Virgo cluster observed by Toloba et al. Both samples have similar\nfrequencies of slow and fast rotators, as well as kinematically decoupled\ncores. This, and especially the finding of rotating quenched low-mass galaxies\nin isolation, reveals that the early-type dwarfs in galaxy clusters need not be\nharassed or tidally stirred spiral galaxies.\n", "  We have collected and analyzed the complete archive of {\\itshape XMM-Newton\\}\n(116), {\\itshape Chandra\\} (151), and {\\itshape RXTE\\} (952) observations of\nthe Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), spanning 1997-2014. The resulting\nobservational library provides a comprehensive view of the physical, temporal\nand statistical properties of the SMC pulsar population across the luminosity\nrange of $L_X= 10^{31.2}$--$10^{38}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. From a sample of 67 pulsars\nwe report $\\sim$1654 individual pulsar detections, yielding $\\sim$1260 pulse\nperiod measurements. Our pipeline generates a suite of products for each pulsar\ndetection: spin period, flux, event list, high time-resolution light-curve,\npulse-profile, periodogram, and spectrum. Combining all three satellites, we\ngenerated complete histories of the spin periods, pulse amplitudes, pulsed\nfractions and X-ray luminosities. Some pulsars show variations in pulse period\ndue to the combination of orbital motion and accretion torques. Long-term\nspin-up/down trends are seen in 12/11 pulsars respectively, pointing to\nsustained transfer of mass and angular momentum to the neutron star on decadal\ntimescales. Of the sample 30 pulsars have relatively very small spin period\nderivative and may be close to equilibrium spin. The distributions of\npulse-detection and flux as functions of spin-period provide interesting\nfindings: mapping boundaries of accretion-driven X-ray luminosity, and showing\nthat fast pulsars ($P<$10 s) are rarely detected, which yet are more prone to\ngiant outbursts. Accompanying this paper is an initial public release of the\nlibrary so that it can be used by other researchers. We intend the library to\nbe useful in driving improved models of neutron star magnetospheres and\naccretion physics.\n", "  The magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars of the upper main sequence\nexhibit strong, globally-organised magnetic fields which are inclined to the\nrotational axis and facilitate the development of surface abundance\ninhomogeneities resulting in photometric and spectroscopic variability.\nTherefore, mCP stars are perfectly suited for a direct measurement of the\nrotational period without the need for any additional calibrations. We have\ninvestigated the rotational properties of mCP stars based on an unprecedentedly\nlarge sample consisting of more than 500 objects with known rotational periods.\nUsing precise parallaxes from the Hipparcos and Gaia satellite missions,\nwell-established photometric calibrations and state-of-the-art evolutionary\nmodels, we have determined the location of our sample stars in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram and derived astrophysical parameters such as\nstellar masses, effective temperature, radii, inclinations and critical\nrotational velocities. We have confirmed the conservation of angular momentum\nduring the main sequence evolution; no signs of additional magnetic braking\nwere found. The inclination angles of the rotational axes are randomly\ndistributed, although an apparent excess of fast rotators with comparable\ninclination angles has been observed. We have found a rotation rate of\n$\\upsilon/\\upsilon_{\\rm crit} \\geq 0.5$ for several stars, whose\ncharacteristics cannot be explained by current models. For the first time, we\nhave derived the relationship between mass and rotation rate of mCP stars, and\nprovide an analysis that links mass and rotation with magnetic field strength.\nOur sample is unique and offers crucial input for forthcoming evolutionary\nmodels that include the effects of magnetic fields for upper main sequence\nstars.\n", "  We start from a static, spherically symmetric space-time in the presence of\nan electrostatic field and construct the mini-superspace Lagrangian that\nreproduces the well known Reissner - Nordstr\\\"om solution. We identify the\nclassical integrals of motion that are to be mapped to quantum observables and\nwhich are associated with the mass and charge. Their eigenvalue equations are\nused as supplementary conditions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and a link is\nprovided between the existence of an horizon and to whether the spectrum of the\nobservables is fully discrete or not. For each case we provide an orthonormal\nbasis of states as emerges through the process of canonical quantization.\n", "  We report on the results of a detailed phase-resolved spectroscopy of\narchival XMM--Newton observations of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Stars (XDINSs).\nOur analysis revealed a narrow and phase-variable absorption feature in the\nX-ray spectrum of RX J1308.6+2127. The feature has an energy of $\\sim$740 eV\nand an equivalent width of $\\sim$15 eV. It is detected only in $\\sim$ 1/5 of\nthe phase cycle, and appears to be present for the entire timespan covered by\nthe observations (2001 December - 2007 June). The strong dependence on the\npulsar rotation and the narrow width suggest that the feature is likely due to\nresonant cyclotron absorption/scattering in a confined high-B structure close\nto the stellar surface. Assuming a proton cyclotron line, the magnetic field\nstrength in the loop is B$_{loop} \\sim 1.7 \\times 10^{14}$ G, about a factor of\n$\\sim$5 higher than the surface dipolar magnetic field (B$_{surf} \\sim 3.4\n\\times 10^{13}$ G). This feature is similar to that recently detected in\nanother XDINS, RX J0720.4-3125, showing (as expected by theoretical\nsimulations) that small scale magnetic loops close to the surface might be\ncommon to many highly magnetic neutron stars (although difficult to detect with\ncurrent X-ray instruments). Furthermore, we investigated the available\nXMM--Newton, data of all XDINSs in search for similar narrow phase-dependent\nfeatures, but could derive only upper limits for all the other sources.\n", "  We report the discovery of periodic modulation of pulsation in 51 fundamental\nmode classical Cepheids of the Magellanic Clouds observed by the Optical\nGravitational Lensing Experiment. Although the overall incidence rate is very\nlow, about 1 per cent in each of the Magellanic Clouds, in the case of the SMC\nand pulsation periods between 12 and 16d the incidence rate is nearly 40 per\ncent. On the other hand, in the LMC the highest incidence rate is 5 per cent\nfor pulsation periods between 8 and 14d, and the overall amplitude of the\neffect is smaller. It indicates that the phenomenon is metallicity dependent.\nTypical modulation periods are between 70 and 300d. In nearly all stars the\nmean brightness is modulated, which, in principle, may influence the use of\nclassical Cepheids for distance determination. Fortunately, the modulation of\nmean brightness does not exceed 0.01 mag in all but one star. Also, the effect\naverages out in typical observations spanning a long time base. Consequently,\nthe effect of modulation on the determination of the distance moduli is\nnegligible. The relative modulation amplitude of the fundamental mode is also\nlow and, with one exception, it does not exceed 6 per cent. The origin of the\nmodulation is unknown. We draw a hypothesis that the modulation is caused by\nthe 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone that\nshapes the famous Hertzsprung bump progression.\n", "  The four-wave interaction in quantum nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger lattices with\ndisorder is shown to destroy the Anderson localization of waves, giving rise to\nunlimited spreading of the nonlinear field to large distances. Moreover, the\nprocess is not thresholded in the quantum domain, contrary to its \"classical\"\ncounterpart, and leads to an accelerated spreading of the subdiffusive type,\nwith the dispersion $\\langle(\\Delta n)^2\\rangle \\sim t^{1/2}$ for\n$t\\rightarrow+\\infty$. The results, presented here, shed new light on the\norigin of subdiffusion in systems with a broad distribution of relaxation\ntimes.\n", "  Space observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia are providing\nunprecedented 6D phase space information of satellite galaxies. Such\nmeasurements can shed light on the structure and assembly history of the Local\nGroup, but improved statistical methods are needed to use them efficiently.\nHere we illustrate such a method using analogs of the Local Group's two most\nmassive satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Triangulum\n(M33), from the Illustris dark-matter-only cosmological simulation. We use a\nBayesian inference scheme combining measurements of positions, velocities, and\nspecific orbital angular momenta ( j ) of the LMC/M33 with importance sampling\nof their simulated analogs to compute posterior estimates of the Milky Way (MW)\nand Andromeda's (M31) halo masses. We conclude the resulting host halo mass is\nmore susceptible to bias when using measurements of the current position and\nvelocity of satellites, especially when satellites are at short-lived phases of\ntheir orbits (i.e. at pericentre). Instead, the j value of a satellite is\nwell-conserved over time and provides a more reliable constraint on host mass.\nThe inferred virial mass of the MW (M31) using j of the LMC (M33) is $\\rm\nM_{vir, MW}=1.02^{+0.77}_{-0.55}\\times10^{12}\\; M_{\\odot}$ ($\\rm M_{vir,\nM31}=1.37^{+1.39}_{-0.75}\\times10^{12}\\; M_{\\odot}$). Choosing simulated\nanalogs whose j values are consistent with the conventional picture of a\nprevious (< 3 Gyr ago), close encounter (< 100 kpc) of M33 about M31 results in\na very low virial mass for M31 ($\\rm\\sim\\!10^{12}\\; M_{\\odot}$). This supports\nthe new scenario put forth in Patel et al. (2017), wherein M33 is on its first\npassage about M31 or on a long period orbit. We conclude that this Bayesian\ninference scheme, utilising satellite j, is a promising method to reduce the\ncurrent factor of two spread in the mass range of the MW and M31 moving\nforward.\n", "  We present results of our study of PDS 11 binary system, which belongs to a\nrare class of isolated, high galactic latitude T Tauri stars. Our spectroscopic\nanalysis reveals that PDS 11 is a M2-M2 binary system with both components\nshowing similar H-alpha emission strength. Both the components appear to be\naccreting, and are classical T Tauri stars. The lithium doublet Li I 6708\nAngstrom, a signature of youth, is present in the spectrum of PDS 11A, but not\nin PDS 11B. From the application of lithium depletion boundary age-dating\nmethod and a comparison with the Li I 6708 equivalent width distribution of\nmoving groups, we estimated an age of 10-15 Myr for PDS 11A. Comparison with\npre-main sequence evolutionary models indicates that PDS 11A is a 0.4 solar\nmass T Tauri star at a distance of 114-131 pc. PDS 11 system does not appear to\nbe associated with any known star forming regions or moving groups. PDS 11 is a\nnew addition, after TWA 30 and LDS 5606, to the interesting class of old,\ndusty, wide binary classical T Tauri systems in which both components are\nactively accreting.\n", "  We investigate the behaviour of bouncing Bianchi type IX `Mixmaster'\nuniverses in general relativity. This generalises all previous studies of the\ncyclic behaviour of closed spatially homogeneous universes with and without\nentropy increase. We determine the behaviour of models containing radiation by\nanalytic and numerical integration and show that increase of radiation entropy\nleads to increasing cycle size and duration. We introduce a null energy\ncondition violating ghost field to create a smooth, non-singular bounce of\nfinite size at the end of each cycle and compute the evolution through many\ncycles with and without entropy increase injected at the start of each cycle.\nIn the presence of increasing entropy we find that the cycles grow larger and\nlonger and the dynamics approach flatness, as in the isotropic case. However,\nsuccessive cycles become increasingly anisotropic at the expansion maxima which\nis dominated by the general-relativistic effects of anisotropic 3-curvature.\nHowever, it becomes positive after expansion drives the dynamics close enough\nto isotropy for the curvature to become positive and for gravitational collapse\nto ensue. In the presence of a positive cosmological constant, radiation and a\nghost field we show that, for a very wide range of cosmological constant\nvalues, the growing oscillations always cease and the dynamics subsequently\napproach those of the isotropic de Sitter universe at late times. This model is\nnot included in the scope of earlier cosmic no-hair theorems because the\n3-curvature can be positive. In the case of negative cosmological constant,\nradiation and an ultra-stiff field (to create non-singular bounces) we show\nthat a sequence of chaotic oscillations also occurs, with sensitive dependence\non initial conditions. In all cases, we follow the oscillatory evolution of the\nscale factors, the shear, and the 3-curvature from cycle to cycle.\n", "  We present new JVLA multi-frequency measurements of a set of stars in\ntransition from the post-AGB to the Planetary Nebula phase monitored in the\nradio range over several years. Clear variability is found for five sources.\nTheir light curves show increasing and decreasing patterns. New radio\nobservations at high angular resolution are also presented for two sources.\nAmong these is IRAS 18062+2410, whose radio structure is compared to\nnear-infrared images available in the literature. With these new maps, we can\nestimate inner and outer radii of 0.03$\"$ and 0.08$\"$ for the ionised shell, an\nionised mass of $3.2\\times10^{-4}$ M$_\\odot$, and a density at the inner radius\nof $7.7\\times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, obtained by modelling the radio shell with\nthe new morphological constraints. The combination of multi-frequency data and,\nwhere available, spectral-index maps leads to the detection of spectral indices\nnot due to thermal emission, contrary to what one would expect in planetary\nnebulae. Our results allow us to hypothesise the existence of a link between\nradio variability and non-thermal emission mechanisms in the nebulae. This link\nseems to hold for IRAS 22568+6141 and may generally hold for those nebulae\nwhere the radio flux decreases over time.\n", "  We use the observed properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and a number of\ngeneral physical considerations to provide a broad-brush model for the physical\nproperties of FRB sources and the radiation mechanism. We show that the\nmagnetic field in the source region should be at least 10^{14} Gauss. This\nstrong field is required to ensure that the electrons have sufficiently high\nground state Landau energy so that particle collisions, instabilities, and\nstrong electric and magnetic fields associated with the FRB radiation do not\nperturb electrons' motion in the direction transverse to the magnetic field and\ndestroy their coherent motion; coherence is required by the high observed\nbrightness temperature of FRB radiation. The electric field in the source\nregion required to sustain particle motion for a wave period is estimated to be\nof order 10^{11} esu. These requirements suggest that FRBs are produced near\nthe surface of magnetars perhaps via forced reconnection of magnetic fields to\nproduce episodic, repeated, outbursts. The beaming-corrected energy release in\nthese bursts is estimated to be ~10^{36} ergs, whereas the total energy in the\nmagnetic field is at least ~10^{45} ergs. We provide a number of predictions\nfor this model which can be tested by future observations. One of which is that\nshort duration FRB-like bursts should exist at much higher frequencies,\npossibly up to optical.\n", "  We investigate the dynamic behavior of long guest rod-like particles immersed\nin liquid crystalline phases formed by shorter host rods, tracking both guest\nand host particles by fluorescence microscopy. Counter-intuitively, we evidence\nthat long rods diffuse faster than short rods forming the one-dimensional\nordered smectic-A phase. This results from the larger and non-commensurate size\nof the guest particles as compared to the wavelength of the energy landscape\nset by the lamellar stack of liquid slabs. The long guest particles are also\nshown to be still mobile in the crystalline smectic-B phase, as they generate\ntheir own voids in the adjacent layers.\n", "  In this paper we study the effects of quantum scalar field vacuum\nfluctuations on scalar test particles in an analog model for the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker spatially flat geometry. In this scenario, the cases\nwith one and two perfectly reflecting plane boundaries are considered as well\nthe case without boundary. We find that the particles can undergo Brownian\nmotion with a nonzero mean squared velocity induced by the quantum vacuum\nfluctuations due to the time dependent background and the presence of the\nboundaries. Typical singularities which appears due to the presence of the\nboundaries in flat spacetime can be naturally regularized for an asymptotically\nbounded expanding scale function. Thus, shifts in the velocity could be, at\nleast in principle, detectable experimentally. The possibility to implement\nthis observation in an analog cosmological model by the use of a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate is also discussed.\n", "  The primordial deuterium abundance probes fundamental physics during the Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis and can be used to infer cosmological parameters.\nObservationally, the abundance can be measured using absorbing clouds along the\nlines of sight to distant quasars. Observations of the quasar PKS1937--101\ncontain two absorbers for which the deuterium abundance has previously been\ndetermined. Here we focus on the higher redshift one at $z_{abs} = 3.572$. We\npresent new observations with significantly increased signal-to-noise ratio\nwhich enable a far more precise and robust measurement of the deuterium to\nhydrogen column density ratio, resulting in D/H = $2.62\\pm0.05\\times10^{-5}$.\nThis particular measurement is of interest because it is among the most precise\nassessments to date and it has been derived from the second lowest\ncolumn-density absorber [N(HI) $=17.9\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$] that has so-far been\nutilised for deuterium abundance measurements. The majority of existing\nhigh-precision measurements were obtained from considerably higher column\ndensity systems [i.e. N(HI) $>19.4\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$]. This bodes well for\nfuture observations as low column density systems are more common.\n", "  Wide gravitationally bound pairs of stars can be formed from adjacent\nprestellar cores that happen to move slowly enough relative to each other.\nThese binaries are remnants of the primordial clustering. It is shown that the\nexpected fraction of wide bound pairs in low-density star formation regions can\nbe larger than the fraction of wide pairs in the field. On the other hand, wide\nbinaries do not form or survive in dense clusters. Recent works on the\nseparation distribution of young binaries, summarized here, confirm these\nexpectations. Alternative formation mechanisms of wide binaries such as cluster\ndissolution or unfolding of triple stars cannot explain the large observed\nfraction of young wide pairs and therefore are not dominant. The fact that more\nthan a half of wide pairs contain subsystems matches the general multiplicity\nstatistics and does not imply that hierarchical multiplicity and wide binaries\nare genetically related.\n", "  We report a detailed characterization of the Kepler-19 system. This star was\npreviously known to host a transiting planet with a period of 9.29 days, a\nradius of 2.2 R$_\\oplus$ and an upper limit on the mass of 20 M$_\\oplus$. The\npresence of a second, non-transiting planet was inferred from the transit time\nvariations (TTVs) of Kepler-19b, over 8 quarters of Kepler photometry, although\nneither mass nor period could be determined. By combining new TTVs measurements\nfrom all the Kepler quarters and 91 high-precision radial velocities obtained\nwith the HARPS-N spectrograph, we measured through dynamical simulations a mass\nof $8.4 \\pm 1.6$ M$_\\oplus$ for Kepler-19b. From the same data, assuming system\ncoplanarity, we determined an orbital period of 28.7 days and a mass of $13.1\n\\pm 2.7$ M$_\\oplus$ for Kepler-19c and discovered a Neptune-like planet with a\nmass of $20.3 \\pm 3.4$ M$_\\oplus$ on a 63 days orbit. By comparing dynamical\nsimulations with non-interacting Keplerian orbits, we concluded that neglecting\ninteractions between planets may lead to systematic errors that could hamper\nthe precision in the orbital parameters when the dataset spans several years.\nWith a density of $4.32 \\pm 0.87$ g cm$^{-3}$ ($0.78 \\pm 0.16$ $\\rho_\\oplus$)\nKepler-19b belongs to the group of planets with a rocky core and a significant\nfraction of volatiles, in opposition to low-density planets characterized by\ntransit-time variations only and the increasing number of rocky planets with\nEarth-like density. Kepler-19 joins the small number of systems that reconcile\ntransit timing variation and radial velocity measurements.\n", "  We present Atacama Large Millimeter/ sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations\nof V883 Ori, an FU Ori object. We describe the molecular outflow and envelope\nof the system based on the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emissions, which together\ntrace a bipolar molecular outflow. The C$^{18}$O emission traces the rotational\nmotion of the circumstellar disk. From the $^{12}$CO blue-shifted emission, we\nestimate a wide opening angle of $\\sim$ 150$^{^{\\circ}}$ for the outflow\ncavities. Also, we find that the outflow is very slow (characteristic velocity\nof only 0.65 km~s$^{-1}$), which is unique for an FU Ori object. We calculate\nthe kinematic properties of the outflow in the standard manner using the\n$^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emissions. In addition, we present a P Cygni profile\nobserved in the high-resolution optical spectrum, evidence of a wind driven by\nthe accretion and being the cause for the particular morphology of the\noutflows. We discuss the implications of our findings and the rise of these\nslow outflows during and/or after the formation of a rotationally supported\ndisk.\n", "  We present new high-resolution ALMA (13CO J=1-0 and J= 2-1) and CARMA (12CO\nand 13CO J=1-0) observations of two Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs): Arp 55\nand NGC 2623. The new data are complementary to published and archival\nSubmillimeter Array observations of 12CO J=2-1 and J=3-2. We perform a Bayesian\nlikelihood non-local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis to constrain the\nmolecular gas physical conditions such as temperature, column and volume\ndensities and the [12CO]/[13CO] abundance ratio. For Arp 55, an\nearly/intermediate staged merger, the line measurements are consistent with\ncold (~10-20 K), dense (>10$^{3.5}$ cm$^{-3}$) molecular gas. For NGC 2623, the\nmolecular gas is warmer (~110 K) and less dense (~10$^{2.7}$ cm$^{-3}$). Since\nArp 55 is an early/intermediate stage merger while NGC 2623 is a merger\nremnant, the difference in physical conditions may be an indicator of merger\nstage. Comparing the temperature and volume density of several LIRGs shows that\nthe molecular gas, averaged over ~kpc scale, of advanced mergers is in general\nwarmer and less dense than early/intermediate stage mergers. We also find that\nthe [12CO]/[13CO] abundance ratio of NGC 2623 is unusually high (>250) when\ncompared to the Milky Way; however, it follows a trend seen with other LIRGs in\nliterature. This high [12CO]/[13CO] value is very likely due to stellar\nnucleosynthesis enrichment of the interstellar medium. On the other hand, Arp\n55 has a more Galactic [12CO]/[13CO] value with the most probable [12CO]/[13CO]\nvalue being 20-30. We measure the CO-to-H2 conversion factor, $\\alpha_{CO}$, to\nbe ~0.1 and ~0.7 (3x10$^{-4}$/x$_{CO}$) M$_{\\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$\npc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$ for Arp 55 and NGC 2623, respectively. Since Arp 55 is an\nearly/intermediate , this suggests that the transition from a Galactic\nconversion factor to a LIRG value happens at an even earlier merger stage.\n", "  We study the merging and evolution of isolated supernovae (SNe) remnants in a\nstellar cluster into a collective superbubble, with the help of 3-D\nhydrodynamic simulations. We particularly focus on the transition stage when\nthe isolated SNe remnants gradually combine to form a superbubble. We find that\nwhen the SN rate is high ($\\nu_{\\rm sn}\\sim 10^{-9}$ pc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$), the\nmerging phase lasts for $\\sim 10^4$ yr, for $n=1\\hbox{--}10$ cm$^{-3}$, and the\nmerging phase lasts for a longer time ($\\sim 0.1$ Myr or more) for lower SN\nrates ($\\nu_{\\rm sn}\\le 10^{-10}$ pc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$). During this transition\nphase, the growing superbubble is filled with dense and cool fragments of\nshells and most of the energy is radiated away during this merging process.\nAfter passing through the intermediate phase, the superbubble eventually\nsettles on to a new power-law wind asymptote that is smaller than estimated in\na continuous wind model. This results in a significant (more than {\\it several\ntimes}) underestimation of the mechanical luminosity needed to feed the bubble.\nWe determine the X-ray and H$\\alpha$ surface brightnesses as functions of time\nfor such merging SNe in a stellar cluster and find that clusters with high SN\nrate shine predominantly in soft X-rays and H$\\alpha$. In particular, a low\nvalue of the volume averaged H$\\alpha$ to H$\\beta$ ratio and its large spread\ncan be a good indicator of the transition phase of merging SNe.\n", "  Linear polarization can be used as a probe of the existence of atmospheric\ncondensates in ultracool dwarfs. Models predict that the observed linear\npolarization increases withthe degree of oblateness, which is inversely\nproportional to the surface gravity. We aimed to test the existence of optical\nlinear polarization in a sample of bright young brown dwarfs, with spectral\ntypes between M6 and L2, observable from the Calar Alto Observatory, and\ncataloged previously as low gravity objects using spectroscopy. Linear\npolarimetric images were collected in I and R-band using CAFOS at the 2.2 m\ntelescope in Calar Alto Observatory (Spain). The flux ratio method was employed\nto determine the linear polarization degrees. With a confidence of 3$\\sigma$,\nour data indicate that all targets have a linear polarimetry degree in average\nbelow 0.69% in the I-band, and below 1.0% in the R-band, at the time they were\nobserved. We detected significant (i.e. P/$\\sigma$ $\\le$ 3) linear polarization\nfor the young M6 dwarf 2MASS J04221413+1530525 in the R-band, with a degree of\n$\\mathrm{p^{*}}$ = 0.81 $\\pm$ 0.17 %.\n", "  We considered a model for the prompt phase of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) emission\narising from a magnetized jet undergoing gradual energy dissipation due to\nmagnetic reconnection. The dissipated magnetic energy is translated to bulk\nkinetic energy and to acceleration of particles. The energy in these particles\nis released via synchrotron radiation as they gyrate around the strong magnetic\nfields in the jet. At small radii, the optical depth is large, and the\nradiation is reprocessed through Comptonization into a narrow, strongly peaked,\ncomponent. At larger distances the optical depth becomes small and radiation\nescapes the jet with a non-thermal distribution. The obtained spectra typically\npeak around $\\approx 300$keV (as observed) and with spectral indices below and\nabove the peak that are, for a broad range of the model parameters, close to\nthe observed values. The small radius of dissipation causes the emission to\nbecome self absorbed at a few keV and can sufficiently suppress the optical and\nX-ray fluxes within the limits required by observations (Beniamini & Piran\n2014).\n", "  Mrk 1018 is a \"changing-look\" AGN whose optical spectrum transitioned from a\nType 1.9 to Type 1 between 1979 and 1984 and back to a Type 1.9 in 2015. This\nlatest transition was accompanied by a decrease in X-ray flux. We analyze the\nChandra spectra from 2010 and 2016 and NuSTAR spectra from 2016, carefully\ntreating pile-up in the Chandra spectrum from 2010 and self-consistently\nmodeling absorption, reflection, and Fe K$\\alpha$ line emission in the X-ray\nspectra from 2016. We demonstrate that while the 2-10 keV X-ray flux decreased\nby an order of magnitude (1.46$^{+0.10}_{-0.13} \\times 10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$\ncm$^{-2}$ to 1.31$^{+0.09}_{-0.04} \\times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$),\nthe Fe K$\\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) increased from 0.18$^{+0.17}_{-0.12}$ to\n0.61$^{+0.27}_{-0.25}$ keV, due to a depressed AGN continuum. We jointly fit\nthe Chandra and NuSTAR spectra from 2016 using the physically-motivated MYTorus\nmodel, finding that the torus orientation is consistent with a face-on\ngeometry, and lines of sight intersecting the torus are ruled out. While we\nmeasure no line-of-sight absorption, we measure a column density of $N_{\\rm H}$\n= 5.38$^{+14}_{-4.0} \\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ for gas out of the line-of-sight\nwhich reprocesses the X-ray emission. We find a high relative normalization\nbetween the Compton scattered emission and transmitted continuum, indicative of\ntime lags between the primary X-ray source and reprocessing gas. We predict\nthat the Fe K$\\alpha$ line will respond to the decrease in AGN flux, which\nwould manifest as a decrease in the Fe K$\\alpha$ EW.\n", "  In the classic picture of standard thin accretion disks, the viscous heating\nis balanced by the radiative cooling through the diffusion process, and the\nradiation-pressure-dominated inner disk suffers convective instability.\nHowever, recent simulations have shown that the vertical advection process\nowing to the magnetic buoyancy can make significant contribution to the energy\ntransport. In addition, no convective instability has been found by comparing\nthe simulation results with the local convective stability criterion. In this\nwork, following the spirit of simulations, we revisit the vertical structure of\nradiation-pressure-dominated thin disks by including the vertical advection\nprocess. Our study indicates a link between the additional energy transport and\nthe convectively stable property. Thus, the vertical advection not only has\nsignificant contribution to the energy transport, but also plays an important\nrole to make the disk convectively stable. Our analyses may be helpful to\nunderstand the discrepancy between the classic theory and simulations on\nstandard thin disks.\n", "  We combine $Spitzer$ and ground-based KMTNet microlensing observations to\nidentify and precisely measure an Earth-mass ($1.43^{+0.45}_{-0.32} M_\\oplus$)\nplanet OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb at $1.16^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ AU orbiting a\n$0.078^{+0.016}_{-0.012} M_\\odot$ ultracool dwarf. This is the lowest-mass\nmicrolensing planet to date. At $3.91^{+0.42}_{-0.46}$ kpc, it is the third\nconsecutive case among the $Spitzer$ \"Galactic distribution\" planets toward the\nGalactic bulge that lies in the Galactic disk as opposed to the bulge itself,\nhinting at a skewed distribution of planets. Together with previous\nmicrolensing discoveries, the seven Earth-size planets orbiting the ultracool\ndwarf TRAPPIST-1, and the detection of disks around young brown dwarfs,\nOGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb suggests that such planets might be common around\nultracool dwarfs. It therefore sheds light on the formation of both ultracool\ndwarfs and planetary systems at the limit of low-mass protoplanetary disks.\n", "  We revisited a mass ejection phenomenon that occurred in asteroid P/2010 A2\nin terms of the dynamical properties of the dust particles and large fragments.\nWe constructed a model assuming anisotropic ejection within a solid cone-shaped\njet and succeeded in reproducing the time-variant features in archival\nobservational images over ~3 years from 2010 January to 2012 October. When we\nassumed that the dust particles and fragments were ejected in the same\ndirection from a point where no object had been detected in any observations,\nthe anisotropic model can explain all of the observations including (i) the\nunique dust cloud morphology, (ii) the trail surface brightness and (iii) the\nmotions of the fragments. Our results suggest that the original body was\nshattered by an impact with the specific energy of Q* <~ 350 J/kg, and remnants\nof slow antipodal ejecta (i.e., anisotropic ejection in our model) were\nobserved as P/2010 A2. The observed quantities are consistent with those\nobtained through laboratory impact experiments, supporting the idea that the\nP/2010 A2 event is the first evidence of the impact shattering occurred in the\npresent main asteroid belt.\n", "  The outer architectures of Kepler's compact systems of multiple transiting\nplanets remain poorly constrained and few of these systems have lower bounds on\nthe orbital distance of any massive outer planets. We infer a minimum orbital\ndistance and upper limits on the inclination of a hypothetical Jovian-mass\nplanet orbiting exterior to the six transiting planets at Kepler-11. Our\nconstraints are derived from dynamical models together with observations\nprovided by the Kepler mission. Firstly, the lack of transit timing variations\n(TTV) in the outermost transiting planet Kepler-11 g imply that the system does\nnot contain a Jovian mass perturber within 2 AU from the star. Secondly, we\ntest under what initial conditions a Jovian-mass planet moderately inclined\nfrom the transiting planets would make their co-transiting configuration\nunlikely. The transiting planets are secularly coupled and exhibit small mutual\ninclinations over long time-scales, although the outermost transiting planet,\nKepler-11 g is weakly coupled to the inner five. We rule out a Jovian-mass\nplanet on a 3 degree inclination within 3.0 AU, and higher inclinations out to\nfurther orbital distances, unless an undetected planet exists orbiting in the\ndynamical gap between Kepler-11 f and Kepler-11 g. Our constraints depend\nlittle on whether we assume the six transiting planets of Kepler-11 were\ninitially perfectly co-planar or whether a minimum initial mutual inclination\nbetween the transiting planets is adopted based on the measured impact\nparameters of the transiting planets.\n", "  The cold-dense plasma is occasionally detected in the solar wind with in situ\ndata, but the source of the cold-dense plasma remains illusive. Interchange\nreconnections (IRs) between closed fields and nearby open fields are well known\nto contribute to the formation of solar winds. We present a confined filament\neruption associated with a puff-like coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2014\nDecember 24. The filament underwent successive activations and finally erupted,\ndue to continuous magnetic flux cancellations and emergences. The confined\nerupting filament showed a clear untwist motion, and most of the filament\nmaterial fell back. During the eruption, some tiny blobs escaped from the\nconfined filament body, along newly-formed open field lines rooted around the\nsouth end of the filament, and some bright plasma flowed from the north end of\nthe filament to remote sites at nearby open fields. The newly-formed open field\nlines shifted southward with multiple branches. The puff-like CME also showed\nmultiple bright fronts and a clear southward shift. All the results indicate an\nintermittent IR existed between closed fields of the confined erupting filament\nand nearby open fields, which released a portion of filament material (blobs)\nto form the puff-like CME. We suggest that the IR provides a possible source of\ncold-dense plasma in the solar wind.\n", "  The nuclear force has been understood to have a repulsive core at short\ndistances, similar to a molecular force, since Jastrow proposed it in 1951. The\nexistence of the repulsion was experimentally confirmed from the proton-proton\nscattering 1S_0 phase shift, which becomes negative beyond 230 MeV. This\nrepulsion is essential for preventing the nucleon-nucleon system from\ncollapsing by attraction. The origin of the repulsion has been considered to be\ndue to the Pauli principle, similar to the repulsion originally revealed in\nalpha-alpha scattering, in many studies including recent lattice QCD\ncalculations. On the other hand, very recently it was shown that an\ninter-nuclear potential including alpha-alpha interactions has a\nLuneburg-lens-like attraction at short distances rather than repulsion. We show\nthat the nuclear force with an attractive potential at short distances that\nreproduces the experimental phase shifts well has a Luneburg-lens-like\nstructural Pauli attractive core (SPAC) at short distances and acts as apparent\nrepulsion. The apparent repulsion is caused by the deeply embedded unobservable\nPauli forbidden state similar to nucleus-nucleus potentials.\n", "  Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) switch between an accretion-powered\nstate without radio pulsations and a rotation-powered state with radio\npulsations. In the former state, they are X-ray bright, in the latter X-ray\ndim. Soft X-ray transients (SXTs) undergo similar switches in X-ray, between\n\"high\" states with bright X-ray outbursts and a \"low\" state of quiescence. The\nupper limit on the quiescent X-ray luminosity of SXT 1H 1905+000 suggests that\nits luminosity might be similar to that of the known tMSPs. A detection of\nradio pulsations would link SXTs more strongly with tMSPs; and thus e.g. put\nstricter constraints on tMSP transitional timescales, through the connection\nwith the well-known SXT periods of quiescence. A non-detection allows us, based\non the telescope sensitivity, to estimate how likely these sources are to\npulsate in radio. Over a ten-year span, 2006-2015, we carried out targeted\nradio observations at 400/800 MHz with Arecibo, and searched for radio\npulsations from the quiescent SXT 1H 1905+000. None of the observations have\nrevealed radio pulsations from the targeted SXT. For a 1-ms pulsar our flux\ndensity upper limit is 10.3 $\\rm{\\mu}$Jy. At an assumed distance of 10 kpc this\ntranslates to a pseudo-luminosity upper limit of 1.0 mJy kpc$^2$, which makes\nour search complete to $\\sim85$% of the known MSP population. Given the high\nsensitivity, and the generally large beaming fraction of millisecond pulsars,\nwe conclude that SXT 1H 1905+000 is unlikely to emit in radio as a transitional\nmillisecond pulsar.\n", "  We present an analysis of new and published data on P/2013 R3, the first\nasteroid detected while disintegrating. Thirteen discrete components are\nmeasured in the interval between UT 2013 October 01 and 2014 February 13. We\ndetermine a mean, pair-wise velocity dispersion amongst these components of\n$\\Delta v = 0.33\\pm0.03$ m s$^{-1}$ and find that their separation times are\nstaggered over an interval of $\\sim$5 months. Dust enveloping the system has,\nin the first observations, a cross-section $\\sim$30 km$^2$ but fades\nmonotonically at a rate consistent with the action of radiation pressure\nsweeping. The individual components exhibit comet-like morphologies and also\nfade except where secondary fragmentation is accompanied by the release of\nadditional dust. We find only upper limits to the radii of any embedded solid\nnuclei, typically $\\sim$100 to 200 m (geometric albedo 0.05 assumed). Combined,\nthe components of P/2013 R3 would form a single spherical body with radius\n$\\lesssim$400 m, which is our best estimate of the size of the precursor\nobject. The observations are consistent with rotational disruption of a weak\n(cohesive strength $\\sim$50 to 100 N m$^{-2}$) parent body, $\\sim$400 m in\nradius. Estimated radiation (YORP) spin-up times of this parent are $\\lesssim$1\nMyr, shorter than the collisional lifetime. If present, water ice sublimating\nat as little as 10$^{-3}$ kg s$^{-1}$ could generate a torque on the parent\nbody rivaling the YORP torque. Under conservative assumptions about the\nfrequency of similar disruptions, the inferred asteroid debris production rate\nis $\\gtrsim$10$^3$ kg s$^{-1}$, which is at least 4% of the rate needed to\nmaintain the Zodiacal Cloud.\n", "  Ark 564 is an archetypal Narrow line Seyfert 1 that has been well observed in\nsoft X-rays from 0.3-10 keV, revealing a steep spectrum, strong soft excess,\niron K emission line and dramatic variability on the order of hours. Because of\nits very steep spectrum, observations of the source above 10 keV have been\nsparse. We report here on the first NuSTAR observation of Ark 564. The source\nwas observed for 200 ks with NuSTAR, 50 ks of which were concurrent with Suzaku\nobservations. NuSTAR and Suzaku observed a dramatic flare, in which the hard\nemission is clearly delayed with respect to the soft emission, consistent with\nprevious detections of a low-frequency hard lag found in XMM-Newton data. The\nNuSTAR spectrum is well described by a low-temperature Comptonisation continuum\n(with an electron temperature of 15 +/- 2 keV), which irradiates a highly\nionised disc. No further relativistic broadening or ionized absorption is\nrequired. These spectral results show that Ark 564 has one of the lowest\ntemperature coronae observed by NuSTAR to date. We discuss possible reasons for\nlow-temperature coronae in high-Eddington sources.\n", "  The eShel, an off-the-shelf, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph ($R \\approx\n10,000$), was installed on the 1m telescope at the Wise observatory in Israel.\nWe report the installation of the multi-order spectrograph, and describe our\npipeline to extract stellar radial velocity from the obtained spectra. We also\nintroduce a new algorithm---UNICOR, to remove radial-velocity systematics that\ncan appear in some of the observed orders. We show that the system performance\nis close to the photon-noise limit for exposures with more than $10^7$ counts,\nwith a precision that can get better than 200 m/s for F--K stars, for which the\neShel spectral response is optimal. This makes the eShel at Wise a useful tool\nfor studying spectroscopic binaries brighter than $m_V=11$. We demonstrate this\ncapability with orbital solutions of two binaries from projects being performed\nat Wise.\n", "  We report on the first NuSTAR observation of the gamma-ray emitting\nmillisecond pulsar binary PSR J1723-2837. X-ray radiation up to 79 keV is\nclearly detected and the simultaneous NuSTAR and Swift spectrum is well\ndescribed by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of ~1.3. We also find\nX-ray modulations in the 3-10 keV, 10-20 keV, 20-79 keV, and 3-79 keV bands at\nthe 14.8-hr binary orbital period. All these are entirely consistent with\nprevious X-ray observations below 10 keV. This new hard X-ray observation of\nPSR J1723-2837 provides strong evidence that the X-rays are from the\nintrabinary shock via an interaction between the pulsar wind and the outflow\nfrom the companion star. We discuss how the NuSTAR observation constrains the\nphysical parameters of the intrabinary shock model.\n", "  Astronomy is in an era where all-sky surveys are mapping the Galaxy. The\nplethora of photometric, spectroscopic, asteroseismic and astrometric data\nallows us to characterise the comprising stars in detail. Here we quantify to\nwhat extent precise stellar observations reveal information about the\nproperties of a star, including properties that are unobserved, or even\nunobservable. We analyse the diagnostic potential of classical and\nasteroseismic observations for inferring stellar parameters such as age, mass\nand radius from evolutionary tracks of solar-like oscillators on the lower main\nsequence. We perform rank correlation tests in order to determine the capacity\nof each observable quantity to probe structural components of stars and infer\ntheir evolutionary histories. We also analyse the principal components of\nclassic and asteroseismic observables to highlight the degree of redundancy\npresent in the measured quantities and demonstrate the extent to which\ninformation of the model parameters can be extracted. We perform multiple\nregression using combinations of observable quantities in a grid of\nevolutionary simulations and appraise the predictive utility of each\ncombination in determining the properties of stars. We identify the\ncombinations that are useful and provide limits to where each type of\nobservable quantity can reveal information about a star. We investigate the\naccuracy with which targets in the upcoming TESS and PLATO missions can be\ncharacterized. We demonstrate that the combination of observations from GAIA\nand PLATO will allow us to tightly constrain stellar masses, ages and radii\nwith machine learning for the purposes of Galactic and planetary studies.\n", "  Hubble Space Telescope photometry from the ACS/WFC and WFPC2 cameras is used\nto detect and measure globular clusters (GCs) in the central region of the rich\nPerseus cluster of galaxies. A detectable population of Intragalactic GCs is\nfound extending out to at least 500 kpc from the cluster center. These objects\ndisplay luminosity and color (metallicity) distributions that are entirely\nnormal for GC populations. Extrapolating from the limited spatial coverage of\nthe HST fields, we estimate very roughly that the entire Perseus cluster should\ncontain ~50000 or more IGCs, but a targetted wide-field survey will be needed\nfor a more definitive answer. Separate brief results are presented for the rich\nGC systems in NGC 1272 and NGC 1275, the two largest Perseus ellipticals. For\nNGC 1272 we find a specific frequency S_N = 8, while for the central giant NGC\n1275, S_N ~ 12. In both these giant galaxies, the GC colors are well matched by\nbimodal distributions, with the majority in the blue (metal-poor) component.\nThis preliminary study suggests that Perseus is a prime target for a more\ncomprehensive deep imaging survey of Intragalactic GCs.\n", "  Debris disk morphology is wavelength dependent due to the wide range of\nparticle sizes and size-dependent dynamics influenced by various forces.\nResolved images of nearby debris disks reveal complex disk structures that are\ndifficult to distinguish from their spectral energy distributions. Therefore,\nmulti-wavelength resolved images of nearby debris systems provide an essential\nfoundation to understand the intricate interplay between collisional,\ngravitational, and radiative forces that govern debris disk structures. We\npresent the SOFIA 35 um resolved disk image of epsilon Eri, the closest debris\ndisk around a star similar to the early Sun. Combining with the Spitzer\nresolved image at 24 um and 15-38 um excess spectrum, we examine two proposed\norigins of the inner debris in epsilon Eri: (1) in-situ planetesimal belt(s)\nand (2) dragged-in grains from the cold outer belt. We find that the presence\nof in-situ dust-producing planetesmial belt(s) is the most likely source of the\nexcess emission in the inner 25 au region. Although a small amount of\ndragged-in grains from the cold belt could contribute to the excess emission in\nthe inner region, the resolution of the SOFIA data is high enough to rule out\nthe possibility that the entire inner warm excess results from dragged-in\ngrains, but not enough to distinguish one broad inner disk from two narrow\nbelts.\n", "  Important tracers for the dark matter halo of the Galaxy are hypervelocity\nstars (HVSs), which are faster than the local escape velocity of the Galaxy and\ntheir slower counterparts, the high-velocity stars in the Galactic halo. Such\nHVSs are believed to be ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) through tidal\ndisruption of a binary by the super-massive black hole (Hills mechanism). The\nHyper-MUCHFUSS survey aims at finding high-velocity potentially unbound hot\nsubdwarf stars. We present the spectroscopic and kinematical analyses of a\nHe-sdO as well as three candidates among the sdB stars using optical Keck/ESI\nand VLT (Xshooter, FORS) spectroscopy. Proper motions are determined by\ncombining positions from early-epoch photographic plates with those derived\nfrom modern digital sky surveys. The Galactic rest frame velocities range from\n203 km\\,s$^{-1}$ to 660 km\\,s$^{-1}$, indicating that most likely all four\nstars are gravitationally bound to the Galaxy. With $T_\\text{eff}=47000$ K and\na surface gravity of $\\log g = 5.7$, SDSS J205030.39$-$061957.8 (J2050) is a\nspectroscopic twin of the hypervelocity He-sdO US 708. As for the latter, the\nGC is excluded as a place of origin based on the kinematic analysis. Hence, the\nHills mechanism can be excluded for J2050. The ejection velocity is much more\nmoderate ($385\\pm79$ km\\,s$^{-1}$) than that of US 708 ($998\\pm68$\nkm\\,s$^{-1}$). The binary thermonuclear supernova scenario suggested for US 708\nwould explain the observed properties of J2050 very well without pushing the\nmodel parameters to their extreme limits, as required for US 708. Accordingly,\nthe star would be the surviving donor of a type Ia supernova. Three sdB stars\nalso showed extreme kinematics; one could be a HVS ejected from the GC, whereas\nthe other two could be ejected from the Galactic disk through the binary\nsupernova mechanism. Alternatively, they might be extreme halo stars.\n", "  We describe a Bayesian rejection sampling algorithm designed to efficiently\ncompute posterior distributions of orbital elements for data covering short\nfractions of long-period exoplanet orbits. Our implementation of this method,\nOrbits for the Impatient (OFTI), converges up to several orders of magnitude\nfaster than two implementations of MCMC in this regime. We illustrate the\nefficiency of our approach by showing that OFTI calculates accurate posteriors\nfor all existing astrometry of the exoplanet 51 Eri b up to 100 times faster\nthan a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. We demonstrate the accuracy of OFTI by\ncomparing our results for several orbiting systems with those of various MCMC\nimplementations, finding the output posteriors to be identical within shot\nnoise. We also describe how our algorithm was used to successfully predict the\nlocation of 51 Eri b six months in the future based on less than three months\nof astrometry. Finally, we apply OFTI to ten long-period exoplanets and brown\ndwarfs, all but one of which have been monitored over less than 3% of their\norbits, producing fits to their orbits from astrometric records in the\nliterature.\n", "  We present low-frequency spectral energy distributions of 60 known radio\npulsars observed with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescope. We\nsearched the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey images for\n200-MHz continuum radio emission at the position of all pulsars in the ATNF\npulsar catalogue. For the 60 confirmed detections we have measured flux\ndensities in 20 x 8 MHz bands between 72 and 231 MHz. We compare our results to\nexisting measurements and show that the MWA flux densities are in good\nagreement.\n", "  We study the star formation (SF) law in 12 Galactic molecular clouds with\nongoing high-mass star formation (HMSF) activity, as traced by the presence of\na bright IRAS source and other HMSF tracers. We define the molecular cloud (MC)\nassociated to each IRAS source using 13CO line emission, and count the young\nstellar objects (YSOs) within these clouds using GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL 24 micron\nSpitzer databases.The masses for high luminosity YSOs (Lbol>10~Lsun) are\ndetermined individually using Pre Main Sequence evolutionary tracks and the\nevolutionary stages of the sources, whereas a mean mass of 0.5 Msun was adopted\nto determine the masses in the low luminosity YSO population. The star\nformation rate surface density (sigsfr) corresponding to a gas surface density\n(siggas) in each MC is obtained by counting the number of the YSOs within\nsuccessive contours of 13CO line emission. We find a break in the relation\nbetween sigsfr and siggas, with the relation being power-law (sigsfr ~\nsiggas^N) with the index N varying between 1.4 and 3.6 above the break. The\nsiggas at the break is between 150-360 Msun/pc^2 for the sample clouds, which\ncompares well with the threshold gas density found in recent studies of\nGalactic star-forming regions. Our clouds treated as a whole lie between the\nKennicutt (1998) relation and the linear relation for Galactic and\nextra-galactic dense star-forming regions. We find a tendency for the high-mass\nYSOs to be found preferentially in dense regions at densities higher than 1200\nMsun/pc^2 (~0.25 g/cm^2).\n", "  With approximately one ninth of Earth's mass, Mars is widely considered to be\na stranded planetary embryo that never became a fully-grown planet. A currently\npopular planet formation theory predicts that Mars formed near Earth and Venus\nand was subsequently scattered outwards to its present location. In such a\nscenario, the compositions of the three planets are expected to be similar to\neach other. However, bulk elemental and isotopic data for martian meteorites\ndemonstrate that key aspects of Mars' composition are markedly different from\nthat of Earth. This suggests that Mars formed outside of the terrestrial\nfeeding zone during primary accretion. It is therefore probable that Mars\nalways remained significantly farther from the Sun than Earth; its growth was\nstunted early and its mass remained relatively low. Here we identify a\npotential dynamical pathway that forms Mars in the asteroid belt and keeps it\noutside of Earth's accretion zone while at the same time accounting for strict\nage and compositional constraints, as well as mass differences. Our uncommon\npathway (approximately 2% probability) is based on the Grand Tack scenario of\nterrestrial planet formation, in which the radial migration by Jupiter\ngravitationally sculpts the planetesimal disc at Mars' current location. We\nconclude that Mars' formation requires a specific dynamical pathway, while this\nis less valid for Earth and Venus. We further predict that} Mars' volatile\nbudget is most likely different from Earth's and that Venus formed close enough\nto our planet that it is expected to have a nearly identical composition from\ncommon building blocks.\n", "  We present and analyze deep Herschel/HIFI observations of the [CII] 158um,\n[CI] 609um, and [CI] 370um lines towards 54 lines-of-sight (LOS) in the Large\nand Small Magellanic clouds. These observations are used to determine the\nphysical conditions of the line--emitting gas, which we use to study the\ntransition from atomic to molecular gas and from C^+ to C^0 to CO in their low\nmetallicity environments. We trace gas with molecular fractions in the range\n0.1<f(H2)<1, between those in the diffuse H2 gas detected by UV absorption\n(f(H2)<0.2) and well shielded regions in which hydrogen is essentially\ncompletely molecular. The C^0 and CO column densities are only measurable in\nregions with molecular fractions f(H2)>0.45 in both the LMC and SMC. Ionized\ncarbon is the dominant gas-phase form of this element that is associated with\nmolecular gas, with C^0 and CO representing a small fraction, implying that\nmost (89% in the LMC and 77% in the SMC) of the molecular gas in our sample is\nCO-dark H2. The mean X_CO conversion factors in our LMC and SMC sample are\nlarger than the value typically found in the Milky Way. When applying a\ncorrection based on the filling factor of the CO emission, we find that the\nvalues of X_CO in the LMC and SMC are closer to that in the Milky Way. The\nobserved [CII] intensity in our sample represents about 1% of the total\nfar-infrared intensity from the LOSs observed in both Magellanic Clouds.\n", "  We have discovered large amounts of molecular gas, as traced by CO emission,\nin the ram pressure stripped gas tail of the Coma cluster galaxy D100 (GMP\n2910), out to large distances of about 50 kpc. D100 has a 60 kpc long,\nstrikingly narrow tail which is bright in X-rays and H{\\alpha}. Our\nobservations with the IRAM 30m telescope reveal in total ~ 10^9 M_sun of H_2\n(assuming the standard CO-to-H_2 conversion) in several regions along the tail,\nthus indicating that molecular gas may dominate its mass. Along the tail we\nmeasure a smooth gradient in the radial velocity of the CO emission that is\noffset to lower values from the more diffuse H{\\alpha} gas velocities. Such a\ndynamic separation of phases may be due to their differential acceleration by\nram pressure. D100 is likely being stripped at a high orbital velocity >2200\nkm/s by (nearly) peak ram pressure. Combined effects of ICM viscosity and\nmagnetic fields may be important for the evolution of the stripped ISM. We\npropose D100 has reached a continuous mode of stripping of dense gas remaining\nin its nuclear region. D100 is the second known case of an abundant molecular\nstripped-gas tail, suggesting that conditions in the ICM at the centers of\ngalaxy clusters may be favorable for molecularization. From comparison with\nother galaxies, we find there is a good correlation between the CO flux and the\nH{\\alpha} surface brightness in ram pressure stripped gas tails, over about 2\ndex.\n", "  We derive the Sun's offset from the local mean Galactic plane($z_\\odot$)\nusing the observed $z$ distribution of young pulsars. Pulsar distances are\nobtained from measurements of annual parallax, HI absorption spectra or\nassociations where available and otherwise from the observed pulsar dispersion\nand a model for the distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy. We fit the\ncumulative distribution function for a ${\\rm sech}^2(z)$ distribution function,\nrepresenting an isothermal self-gravitating disk, with uncertainties being\nestimated using the bootstrap method. We take pulsars having characteristic age\n$\\tau_c<10^{6.5}$~yr and located within 4.5~kpc of the Sun, omitting those\nwithin the local spiral arm and those significantly affected by the Galactic\nwarp, and solve for $z_\\odot$ and the scale height, $H$, for different cutoffs\nin $\\tau_c$. We compute these quantities using just the independently\ndetermined distances, and these together with DM-based distances separately\nusing the YMW16 and NE2001 Galactic electron density models. We find that an\nage cutoff at $10^{5.75}$~yr with YMW16 DM-distances gives the best results\nwith a minimum uncertainty in $z_\\odot$ and an asymptotically stable value for\n$H$ showing that, at this age and below, the observed pulsar $z$-distribution\nis dominated by the dispersion in their birth locations. From this sample of\n115 pulsars, we obtain $z_\\odot=13.4\\pm$4.4~pc and $H=56.9\\pm$6.5~pc, similar\nto estimated scale heights for OB stars and open clusters. Consistent results\nare obtained using the independent-only distances and using the NE2001 model\nfor the DM-based distances.\n", "  Giant planets are thought to have cores in their deep interiors, and the\ndivision into a heavy-element core and hydrogen-helium envelope is applied in\nboth formation and structure models. We show that the primordial internal\nstructure depends on the planetary growth rate, in particular, the ratio of\nheavy elements accretion to gas accretion. For a wide range of likely\nconditions, this ratio is in one-to-one correspondence with the resulting\npost-accretion profile of heavy elements within the planet. This flux ratio\ndepends sensitively on the assumed solid surface density in the surrounding\nnebula. We suggest that giant planets' cores might not be distinct from the\nenvelope and includes some hydrogen and helium, and the deep interior can have\na gradual heavy-element structure. Accordingly, Jupiter's core may not be\nwell-defined. Accurate measurements of Jupiter's gravitational field by Juno\ncould put constraints on Jupiter's core mass. However, as we suggest here, the\ndefinition of Jupiter's core is complex, and the core's physical properties\n(mass, density) depend on the actual definition of the core and on its growth\nhistory.\n", "  By fitting the bolometric light curves of 31 super-luminous supernovae\n(SLSNe) with the magnetar engine model, we derive the ejecta masses and\nmagnetar parameters for these SLSNe. The lower boundary of magnetic field\nstrengths of SLSN magnetars can be set just around the critical field strength\n$B_{\\rm c}$ of electron Landau quantization. In more details, SLSN magnetars\ncan further be divided into two subclasses of magnetic fields of\n$\\sim(1-5)B_{\\rm c}$ and $\\sim(5-10)B_{\\rm c}$, respectively. It is revealed\nthat these two subclasses of magnetars are just associated with the\nslow-evolving and fast-evolving bolometric light curves of SLSNe. In\ncomparison, the magnetars harbored in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and associated\nhypernovae are usually inferred to have much higher magnetic fields with a\nlower boundary about $\\sim10B_{\\rm c}$. This robustly suggests that it is the\nmagnetic fields that play the crucial role in distinguishing SLSNe from\nGRBs/hypernovae. The rotational energy of SLSN magnetars are found to be\ncorrelated with the masses of supernova ejecta, which provides a clue to\nexplore the nature of their progenitors. Moreover, the distribution of ejecta\nmasses of SLSNe is basically intermediate between those of normal core-collapse\nsupernovae and hypernovae. This could indicate an intrinsic connection among\nthese different stellar explosions.\n", "  Overcoming type I migration and preventing low-mass planets from spiralling\ninto the central star is a long-studied topic. It is well known that outward\nmigration is possible in viscous-heated discs relatively close to the central\nstar because the entropy gradient can be sufficiently steep that the positive\ncorotation torque overcomes the negative Lindblad torque. Yet efficiently\ntrapping planets in this region remains elusive. Here we study disc conditions\nthat yield outward migration for low-mass planets under specific planet\nmigration prescriptions. Using a steady-state disc model with a constant\nalpha-viscosity, outward migration is only possible when the negative\ntemperature gradient exceeds ~0.87. We derive an implicit relation for the\nmaximum mass at which outward migration is possible as a function of viscosity\nand disc scale height. We apply these criteria, using a simple power-law disc\nmodel, to planets that have reached their pebble isolation mass after an\nepisode of rapid accretion. It is possible to trap planets with the pebble\nisolation mass farther than the inner edge of the disc provided that alpha_crit\n>~ 0.004 for discs older than 1 Myr. In very young discs the high temperature\ncauses the planets to grow to masses exceeding the maximum for outward\nmigration. As the disc evolves, these more massive planets often reach the\ncentral star, generally only towards the end of the disc's lifetime. Saving\nsuper-Earths is therefore a delicate interplay between disc viscosity, the\nopacity profile and the temperature gradient in the viscously heated inner\ndisc.\n", "  We use Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study the structural properties of\nten of the most massive ($M \\geq 10^{11.25}$ Msun) quiescent galaxies (QGs) in\nthe UKIDSS UDS at $2.5<z<3.0$. The low spatial density of these galaxies\nrequired targeted WFC3 $H_{160}$ imaging, as such systems are rare in existing\nsurveys like CANDELS. We fit Sersic models to the 2D light profiles and find\nthat the median half-light radius is $R_e \\sim 3$ kpc, a factor of $\\sim 3$\nsmaller than QGs with similar masses at $z \\sim 0$. Complementing our sample\nwith similarly massive QGs at lower redshifts, we find that the median size\nevolves as $R_e \\propto H(z)^{-0.85 \\pm 0.12}$ (or alternatively, $R_e \\propto\n(1+z)^{-0.90 \\pm 0.12}$). This rate of evolution is slower than that for lower\nmass QGs. When compared to low redshift QGs, the axis ratio distribution for\nour high redshift massive QG sample is most consistent with those in which\nspheroids are dominant. These observations point to earlier size growth among\nmassive QGs that also resulted in spheroidal systems. Finally, we measured\nresidual-corrected surface brightness profiles for our sample. These show that\nthe Sersic parameterization is generally representative out to several\neffective radii and does not miss excess low surface brightness light. The\nsizes inferred from the light profiles therefore confirm the compactness of\nthese most massive high redshift QGs.\n", "  We investigate indeterminate points in discrete integrable system. They\nappear in singularity confinement phenomenon naturally. We develop a method to\nanalyse indeterminate points of dynamical maps and using this method we clarify\nbehaviour of indeterminate points of some integrable maps. As a result, (1) we\ndetermine their indeterminacy, (2) find they are `confined' by the map, and (3)\nobtain a periodicity condition of the map from indeterminate point. Finally, we\npropose a new type of entropy using the indeterminacy in conclusion.\n", "  The cosmic optical background is an important observable that constrains\nenergy production in stars and more exotic physical processes in the universe,\nand provides a crucial cosmological benchmark against which to judge theories\nof structure formation. Measurement of the absolute brightness of this\nbackground is complicated by local foregrounds like the Earth's atmosphere and\nsunlight reflected from local interplanetary dust, and large discrepancies in\nthe inferred brightness of the optical background have resulted. Observations\nfrom probes far from the Earth are not affected by these bright foregrounds.\nHere we analyze data from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI)\ninstrument on NASA's New Horizons mission acquired during cruise phase outside\nthe orbit of Jupiter, and find a statistical upper limit on the optical\nbackground's brightness similar to the integrated light from galaxies. We\nconclude that a carefully performed survey with LORRI could yield uncertainties\ncomparable to those from galaxy counting measurements.\n", "  We show that correlated Gaussians with good angular momentum and parity\nprovide flexible basis functions for specific elongated shape. As its\napplication we study linear-chain states of four-alpha particles in\nvariation-after-projection calculations in which all the matrix elements are\nevaluated analytically. We find possible chain states for $J=0^+$, $2^+$, $4^+$\nand perhaps $6^+$ with the bandhead energy being about 33 MeV from the ground\nstate of $^{16}$O. No chain states with $J\\geq 8$ are found. The nature of the\nrotational sequence of the chain states is clarified in contrast to a\nrigid-body rotation. The quadrupole deformation parameters estimated from the\nchain states increase from 0.59 to 1.07 for $2^+$ to $6^+$. This work suggests\nundeveloped fields for the correlated Gaussians beyond those problems which\nhave hitherto been solved successfully.\n", "  CRTS J084133.15+200525.8 is an optically bright quasar at z=2.345 that has\nshown extreme spectral variability over the past decade. Photometrically, the\nsource had a visual magnitude of V~17.3 between 2002 and 2008. Then, over the\nfollowing five years, the source slowly brightened by approximately one\nmagnitude, to V~16.2. Only ~1 in 10,000 quasars show such extreme variability,\nas quantified by the extreme parameters derived for this quasar assuming a\ndamped random walk model. A combination of archival and newly acquired spectra\nreveal the source to be an iron low-ionization broad absorption line (FeLoBAL)\nquasar with extreme changes in its absorption spectrum. Some absorption\nfeatures completely disappear over the 9 years of optical spectra, while other\nfeatures remain essentially unchanged. We report the first definitive redshift\nfor this source, based on the detection of broad H-alpha in a Keck/MOSFIRE\nspectrum. Absorption systems separated by several 1000 km/s in velocity show\ncoordinated weakening in the depths of their troughs as the continuum flux\nincreases. We interpret the broad absorption line variability to be due to\nchanges in photoionization, rather than due to motion of material along our\nline of sight. This source highlights one sort of rare transition object that\nastronomy will now be finding through dedicated time-domain surveys.\n", "  The structural and dynamical properties of FePt nanoparticles were studied\nwithin the density functional theory. The effect of size and chemical\ncomposition on dynamical stability of nanoparticles was investigated for the\ncuboctahedral and icosahedral symmetries. In cuboctahedra, the structural\ndistortion is observed, which for systems with odd number of Pt layers leads to\nlowering of the tetragonal symmetry. Significant differences between the\nvibrational properties of FePt particles and bulk crystal is observed, but\nsimilarly to the FePt crystal, cuboctahedral particles exhibit a strong\nanisotropy of atomic vibrations. The icosahedral particles with perfect shell\ngeometry are unstable due to enlarged distances between Fe atoms. They can be\nstabilized by removing a central atom or replacing it by a smaller one. The\nheat capacity and entropy of nanoparticles show typical enhancement due to\nlow-energy vibrations at the surface layers.\n", "  The recent experiment of Stettenheim, et al. showed that, contrary to\nconventional belief, the coupling of a quantum electronic device to its\nsubstrate can have important effects on the noise power spectrum, since the\nsubstrate functions as a mechanical oscillator. We carry out a theoretical\nanalysis of this coupling in the case of a quantum point contact (QPC). First\nwe derive the noise power spectrum from the Hamiltonian without making the\nMarkovian approximation, and obtain numerical results that reproduce the\nexperimental data. Next we investigate the nature of the coupling. In most\nprevious analyses, the coupling of an electronic device to a mechanical\noscillator has been modeled as a position coupling. We model it both as a\nposition coupling and as a momentum coupling and compare the results. We find\nthat, as long as one includes backaction between position and momentum, the\nassumed mode of coupling makes little difference, since the backaction\ntransmits momentum fluctuations to position fluctuations and vice versa.\nFinally, we ask whether the salient features of the model persist in the\nMarkovian approximation. We find that a Markovian analysis confirms the\nQPC-substrate coupling, but underestimates the noise floor and leads to\nexcessively sharp and narrow noise peaks around the resonant frequencies.\n", "  The hidden broad-line regions (BLRs) in Seyfert 2 galaxies, which display\nbroad emission lines (BELs) in their polarized spectra, are a key piece of\nevidence in support of the unified model for active galactic nuclei (AGNs).\nHowever, the detailed kinematics and geometry of hidden BLRs are still not\nfully understood. The virial factor obtained from reverberation mapping of type\n1 AGNs may be a useful diagnostic of the nature of hidden BLRs in type 2\nobjects. In order to understand the hidden BLRs, we compile six type 2 objects\nfrom the literature with polarized BELs and dynamical measurements of black\nhole masses. All of them contain pseudobulges. We estimate their virial\nfactors, and find the average value is 0.60 and the standard deviation is 0.69,\nwhich agree well with the value of type 1 AGNs with pseudobulges. This study\ndemonstrates that (1) the geometry and kinematics of BLR are similar in type 1\nand type 2 AGNs of the same bulge type (pseudobulges), and (2) the small values\nof virial factors in Seyfert 2 galaxies suggest that, similar to type 1 AGNs,\nBLRs tend to be very thick disks in type 2 objects.\n", "  We consider $d$-dimensional solutions to the electrovacuum Einstein-Maxwell\nequations with the Weyl tensor of type N and a null Maxwell $(p+1)$-form field.\nWe prove that such spacetimes are necessarily aligned, i.e. the Weyl tensor of\nthe corresponding spacetime and the electromagnetic field share the same\n\\textit{aligned null direction} (AND). Moreover, this AND is geodetic,\nshear-free, non-expanding and non-twisting and hence Einstein-Maxwell equations\nimply that Weyl type N spacetimes with a null Maxwell $(p+1)$-form field belong\nto the Kundt class. Moreover, these Kundt spacetimes are necessarily $CSI$ and\nthe $(p+1)$ form is $VSI$. Finally, a general coordinate form of solutions and\na reduction of the field equations are discussed.\n", "  Quantifying coherence is a key task in both quantum mechanical theory and\npractical applications. Here, a reliable quantum coherence measure is presented\nby utilizing the quantum skew information of the state of interest subject to a\ncertain broken observable. This coherence measure is proven to fulfill all the\ncriteria (especially the strong monotonicity) recently introduced in the\nresource theories of quantum coherence. The coherence measure has an analytic\nexpression and an obvious operational meaning related to quantum metrology. In\nterms of this coherence measure, the distribution of the quantum coherence,\ni.e., how the quantum coherence is distributed among the multiple parties is\nstudied and a corresponding polygamy relation is proposed. As a further\napplication, it is found that the coherence measure forms the natural upper\nbounds for quantum correlations prepared by incoherent operations. The\nexperimental measurement of our coherence measure as well as the\nrelative-entropy coherence, $l_p$-norm coherence is studied finally.\n", "  In this paper, we study the bigraded vector space structure of\nLandau-Ginzburg orbifolds. We prove the formula for the generating function of\nthe Hodge numbers of possibly nonabelian Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. As an\napplication, we calculate the Hodge numbers for all nondegenerate quintic\nhomogeneous polynomials with five variables. These results yield an evidence\nfor the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence between the Calabi-Yau\ngeometries and the Landau-Ginzburg B-models.\n", "  In the present work we study strange stars in $f(R)$ theories of gravity in\nthe Palatini formalism. We consider two concrete well-known cases, namely the\n$R+R^2/(6 M^2)$ model as well as the $R-\\mu^4/R$ model for two different values\nof the mass parameter $M$ or $\\mu$. We integrate the modified\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically, and we show the mass-radius\ndiagram for each model separately. The standard case corresponding to the\nGeneral Relativity is also shown in the same figure for comparison. Our\nnumerical results show that the interior solution can be vastly different\ndepending on the model and/or the value of the parameter of each model. In\naddition, our findings imply that i) for the cosmologically interesting values\nof the mass scales $M,\\mu$ the effect of modified gravity on strange stars is\nnegligible, while ii) for the values predicting an observable effect, the\nmodified gravity models discussed here would be ruled out by their cosmological\neffects.\n", "  Studies of cluster galaxies are increasingly finding galaxies with\nspectacular one-sided tails of gas and young stars, suggestive of intense\nram-pressure stripping. These so-called \"jellyfish\" galaxies typically have\nlate-type morphology. In this paper, we present MUSE observations of an\nelliptical galaxy in Abell 2670 with long tails of material visible in the\noptical spectra, as well as blobs with tadpole-like morphology. The spectra in\nthe central part of the galaxy reveals a stellar component as well as ionized\ngas. The stellar component does not have significant rotation, while the\nionized gas defines a clear star-forming gas disk. We argue, based on deep\noptical images of the galaxy, that the gas was most likely acquired during a\npast wet merger. It is possible that the star-forming blobs are also remnants\nof the merger. In addition, the direction and kinematics of the one-sided\nionized tails, combined with the tadpole morphology of the star-forming blobs,\nstrongly suggests that the system is undergoing ram pressure from the\nintracluster medium. In summary, this paper presents the discovery of a\npost-merger elliptical galaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping.\n", "  We present the first detection of the ortho-H2O 4_23-3_30 transition at 448\nGHz in space. We observed this transition in the local (z = 0.010) luminous\ninfrared (IR) galaxy ESO 320-G030 (IRAS F11506-3851) using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The water 4_23-3_30 emission, which\noriginates in the highly obscured nucleus of this galaxy, is spatially resolved\nover a region of ~65 pc in diameter and shows a regular rotation pattern\ncompatible with the global molecular and ionized gas kinematics. The line\nprofile is symmetric and well fitted by a Gaussian with an integrated flux of\n37.0 +- 0.7 Jy km s-1 . Models predict this water transition as a potential\ncollisionally excited maser transition. On the contrary, in this galaxy, we\nfind that the 4_23-3_30 emission is primarily excited by the intense far-IR\nradiation field present in its nucleus. According to our modeling, this\ntransition is a probe of deeply buried galaxy nuclei thanks to the high dust\noptical depths (tau_100{\\mu}m > 1, N_H > 1e24 cm-2) required to efficiently\nexcite it.\n", "  Everett's interpretation of quantum mechanics was proposed to avoid problems\ninherent in the prevailing interpretational frame. It assumes that quantum\nmechanics can be applied to any system and that the state vector always evolves\nunitarily. It then claims that whenever an observable is measured, all possible\nresults of the measurement exist. This assertion of multiplicity has been\nunderstood in many ways by proponents of Everett's theory. Here we shall\nillustrate how different views on multiplicity carry onto different views on\nspacetime.\n", "  We present the first identification of a candidate precursor for an imminent\nred nova. Our prediction is based on the example of the precursor to the red\nnova V1309 Sco, which was retrospectively found to be a contact binary with an\nexponentially decreasing period. We explore the use of this distinctive timing\nsignature to identify precursors, developing the observational and analysis\nsteps needed. We estimate that our Galaxy has roughly 1-10 observable\nprecursors. Specifically, we lay out the observational case for KIC 9832227,\nwhich we identified as a tentative candidate two years ago (Molnar et al. 2015,\nAAS Meeting Abstracts 415.05). Orbital timing over the past two years has\nfollowed the tentative exponential fit. As of late 2015, the period time\nderivative went beyond the range found in other systems (dP/dt < 1x10^{-8}), a\nnecessary criterion for a serious candidate. We estimate time of merger is the\nyear 2022.2(7). Double absorption line spectra confirm directly the 0.458 d\nlight curve period is a contact binary system and yield a mass ratio m_B/m_A =\n0.228(3). Closer analysis of the Kepler timing data shows evidence of a\ncomponent C with orbital period P_C = 590(8) days and m_C x sin i_C = 0.11\nsolar masses. An alternative interpretation of the long term timing trend,\nlight travel time delay due to orbit around a distant component D, is ruled out\nby the spectroscopic data for any nondegenerate star. Additional measurements\nare needed to test further the merging hypothesis and to utilize fully this\nfortuitous opportunity.\n", "  We present a method to reconstruct the complete statistical mode structure\nand optical losses of multimode conjugated optical fields using an\nexperimentally measured joint photon-number probability distribution. We\ndemonstrate that this method evaluates classical and non-classical properties\nusing a single measurement technique and is well-suited for quantum mesoscopic\nstate characterization. We obtain a nearly-perfect reconstruction of a field\ncomprised of up to 10 modes based on a minimal set of assumptions. To show the\nutility of this method, we use it to reconstruct the mode structure of an\nunknown bright parametric down-conversion source.\n", "  Current protoplanetary dust coagulation theory does not predict dry silicate\nplanetesimals, in tension with the Earth. While remedies to this predicament\nhave been proposed, they have generally failed numerical studies, or are in\ntension with the Earth's (low, volatility dependent) volatile and moderately\nvolatile elemental abundances. Expanding on the work of Boley et al. (2014), we\nexamine the implications of molten grain collisions and find that they may\nprovide a solution to the dry silicate planetesimal problem. Further, the\nsource of the heating, be it the hot inner disk or an FU Orionis scale\naccretion event, would dictate the location of the resulting planetesimals,\npotentially controlling subsequent planetary system architectures. We\nhypothesize that systems which did undergo FU Orionis scale accretion events\nhost planetary systems similar to our own, while ones that did not instead host\nvery close in, tightly packed planets such as seen by Kepler.\n", "  After a quiescence period of about 10 years, the classical EXor source V1118\nOri has undergone an accretion outburst in 2015 September. The maximum\nbrightness (DV > 4 mag) was reached in 2015 December and was maintained for\nseveral months. Since 2016 September, the source is in a declining phase.\nPhotometry and low/ high-resolution spectroscopy were obtained with MODS and\nLUCI2 at the {\\it Large Binocular Telescope}, with the facilities at the Asiago\n1.22 and 1.82 m telescopes, and with GIANO at the {\\it Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo}. The spectra are dominated by emission lines of \\hi\\ and neutral\nmetallic species. From line and continuum analysis we derive the mass accretion\nrate and its evolution during the outburst. Considering that extinction may\nvary between 1.5 and 2.9 mag, we obtain m_acc= 0.3$-$2.0 10$^{-8}$ m_sun/yr, in\nquiescence and m_acc= 0.2$-$1.9 10$^{-6}$ m_sun/yr, at the outburst peak. The\nBalmer decrement shape has been interpreted by means of line excitation models,\nfinding that from quiescence to outburst peak, the electron density has\nincreased from $\\sim$ 2 10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ to $\\sim$ 4 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. The\nprofiles of the metallic lines are symmetric and narrower than 100 km s$^{-1}$,\nwhile \\hi\\, and \\hei\\,\\,lines show prominent wings extending up to $\\pm$ 500 km\ns$^{-1}$. The metallic lines likely originate at the base of the accretion\ncolumns, where neutrals are efficiently shielded against the ionizing photons,\nwhile faster ionized gas is closer to the star. Outflowing activity is\ntestified by the detection of a variable P Cyg-like profile of the H$\\alpha$\nand \\hei\\, 1.08\\,$\\mu$m lines.\n", "  We report a study of extended $\\gamma$-ray emission with the Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which is likely to\nbe the second case of a $\\gamma$-ray detection from a star-forming region (SFR)\nin our Galaxy. The LAT source is located in the G25 region, $1.7^{\\circ} \\times\n2.1^{\\circ}$ around $(l, b) = (25.0^{\\circ}, 0.0^{\\circ})$. The $\\gamma$-ray\nemission is found to be composed of two extended sources and one point-like\nsource. The extended sources have a similar sizes of about $1.4^{\\circ} \\times\n0.6^{\\circ}$. An $\\sim 0.4^{\\circ}$ diameter sub-region of one has a photon\nindex of $\\Gamma = 1.53 \\pm 0.15$; and is spatially coincident with HESS\nJ1837$-$069, likely a pulsar wind nebula. The other parts of the extended\nsources have a photon index of $\\Gamma = 2.1 \\pm 0.2$ without significant\nspectral curvature. Given their spatial and spectral properties, they have no\nclear associations with sources at other wavelengths. Their $\\gamma$-ray\nproperties are similar to those of the Cygnus cocoon SFR, the only firmly\nestablished $\\gamma$-ray detection of an SFR in the Galaxy. Indeed, we find\nbubble-like structures of atomic and molecular gas in G25, which may be created\nby a putative OB association/cluster. The $\\gamma$-ray emitting regions appear\nconfined in the bubble-like structure; similar properties are also found in the\nCygnus cocoon. In addition, using observations with the the XMM-Newton we find\na candidate young massive OB association/cluster G25.18+0.26 in the G25 region.\nWe propose that the extended $\\gamma$-ray emission in G25 is associated with an\nSFR driven by G25.18+0.26. Based on this scenario, we discuss possible\nacceleration processes in the SFR and compare them with the Cygnus cocoon.\n", "  As the largest, clearly defined building blocks of our Universe, galaxy\nclusters are interesting astrophysical laboratories and important probes for\ncosmology. X-ray surveys for galaxy clusters provide one of the best ways to\ncharacterise the population of galaxy clusters. We provide a description of the\nconstruction of the NORAS II galaxy cluster survey based on X-ray data from the\nnorthern part of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. NORAS II extends the NORAS survey\ndown to a flux limit of 1.8 x 10^(-12) erg s^-1 cm^-2 (0.1 - 2.4 keV)\nincreasing the sample size by about a factor of two. The NORAS II cluster\nsurvey now reaches the same quality and depth of its counterpart, the Southern\nREFLEX II survey, allowing us to combine the two complementary surveys. The\npaper provides information on the determination of the cluster X-ray\nparameters, the identification process of the X-ray sources, the statistics of\nthe survey, and the construction of the survey selection function, which we\nprovide in numerical format. Currently NORAS II contains 860 clusters with a\nmedian redshift of z = 0.102. We provide a number of statistical functions\nincluding the logN-logS and the X-ray luminosity function and compare these to\nthe results from the complementary REFLEX II survey. Using the NORAS II sample\nto constrain the cosmological parameters, sigma_8 and Omega_m, yields results\nperfectly consistent with those of REFLEX II. Overall, the results show that\nthe two hemisphere samples, NORAS II and REFLEX II, can be combined without\nproblems to an all-sky sample, just excluding the Zone-of-Avoidance.\n", "  In our previous paper we obtained a full classification of nonequivalent\nquasitriangular quantum deformations for the complex $D=4$ Euclidean Lie\nsymmetry $\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})$. The result was presented in the form of\na list consisting of three three-parameter, one two-parameter and one\none-parameter nonisomorphic classical $r$-matrices which provide 'directions'\nof the nonequivalent quantizations of $\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})$. Applying\nreality conditions to the complex $\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})$ $r$-matrices we\nobtained the nonisomorphic classical $r$-matrices for all possible real forms\nof $\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})$: Euclidean $\\mathfrak{o}(4)$, Lorentz\n$\\mathfrak{o}(3,1)$, Kleinian $\\mathfrak{o}(2,2)$ and quaternionic\n$\\mathfrak{o}^{\\star}(4)$ Lie algebras. In the case of $\\mathfrak{o}(4)$ and\n$\\mathfrak{o}(3,1)$ real symmetries these $r$-matrices give the full\nclassifications of the inequivalent quasitriangular quantum deformations,\nhowever for $\\mathfrak{o}(2,2)$ and $\\mathfrak{o}^{\\star}(4)$ the\nclassifications are not full. In this paper we complete these classifications\nby adding three new three-parameter $\\mathfrak{o}(2,2)$-real $r$-matrices and\none new three-parameter $\\mathfrak{o}^{\\star}(4)$-real $r$-matrix. All\nnonisomorphic classical $r$-matrices for all real forms of\n$\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})$ are presented in the explicite form what is\nconvenient for providing the quantizations. We will mention also some\napplications of our results to the deformations of space-time symmetries and\nstring $\\sigma$-models.\n", "  In the present work we investigate wormhole structures and the energy\nconditions supporting them, in Einstein-Cartan theory ({\\sf ECT}). The matter\ncontent consists of a Weyssenhoff fluid along with an anisotropic matter which\ntogether generalize the anisotropic energy momentum tensor in general\nrelativity ({\\sf GR}) to include spin effects. Assuming that the radial\npressure and energy density obey a linear equation of state, we introduce exact\nasymptotically flat and anti-de-Sitter spacetimes that admit traversable\nwormholes and respect energy conditions. Such wormhole solutions are studied in\ndetail for two specific forms for the redshift function, namely a constant\nredshift function and the one with power law dependency.\n", "  The spatial and kinematic distribution of warm gas in and around the Coma\nCluster is presented through observations of Lyman-alpha absorbers using\nbackground QSOs. Updates to the Lyman-alpha absorber distribution found in Yoon\net al. (2012) for the Virgo Cluster are also presented. At 0.2-2.0 R_vir of\nComa we identify 14 Lyman-alpha absorbers (N_HI = 10^{12.8-15.9} cm^-2) towards\n5 sightlines and no Lyman-alpha absorbers along 3 sightlines within\n3\\sigmav_coma. For both Coma and Virgo, most Lyman-alpha absorbers are found\noutside the virial radius or beyond 1\\sigmav consistent with them largely\nrepresenting the infalling intergalactic medium. The few exceptions in the\ncentral regions can be associated with galaxies. The Lyman-alpha absorbers\navoid the hot ICM, consistent with the infalling gas being shock-heated within\nthe cluster. The massive dark matter halos of clusters do not show the\nincreasing column density with decreasing impact parameter relationship found\nfor the smaller mass galaxy halos. In addition, while the covering fraction\nwithin R_vir is lower for clusters than galaxies, beyond R_vir the covering\nfraction is somewhat higher for clusters. The velocity dispersion of the\nabsorbers compared to the galaxies is higher for Coma, consistent with the\nabsorbers tracing additional turbulent gas motions in the cluster outskirts.\nThe results are overall consistent with cosmological simulations, with the\ncovering fraction being high in the observations standing out as the primary\ndiscrepancy.\n", "  This paper is motivated by the recent demonstration of three-wave mixing\nbased phononic frequency comb. While the previous experiments have shown the\nexistence of three-wave mixing pathway in a system of two-coupled phonon modes,\nthis work demonstrates a similar pathway in a system of three-coupled phonon\nmodes. The paper also presents a number of interesting experimental facts\nconcomitant to the three-mode three-wave mixing based frequency comb observed\nin a specific micromechanical device. The experimental validation of three-mode\nthree-wave mixing along with the previous demonstration of two-mode three-wave\nmixing points to the ultimate possibility of multimode frequency combs.\n", "  We have employed RMF+BCS (relativistic mean-field plus BCS) ap- proach to\nstudy behaviour of N = 16 shell closure with the help of ground state\nproperties of even-even nuclei. Our present investigations include sin- gle\nparticle energies, deformations, separation energies as well as pairing\nenergies etc. As per recent experiments showing neutron magicity at N = 16 for\nO isotopes, our results indicate a strong shell closure at N = 16 in 22C and\n24O. A large gap is found in between neutron 2s1/2 and 1d3/2 states for 22C and\n24O. These results are also supported by a sharp increase in two neutron shell\ngap, zero pairing energy contribution and with excellent agreement with\navailable experimental data. Moreover, our calculations of N = 16 isotones are\nhowever found at variance for higher Z isotones like 36Ca, where experiments\nshow high lying first excited 2+ state indicating shell closure at N = 16.\n", "  We associate an explicit equivalent descendent insertion to any relative\ninsertion in quantum K-theory of Nakajima varieties. This also serves as an\nexplicit formula for off-shell Bethe eigenfunctions for general quantum loop\nalgebras associated to quivers and gives the general integral solution to the\ncorresponding quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov and dynamical q-difference\nequations.\n", "  In this work, we aim to study the thermal properties of materials using\nclassical molecular dynamics simulations and specialized numerical methods. We\nfocus primarily on the thermal conductivity \\kappa using non-equilibrium\nmolecular dynamics to study the response of a crystalline solid, namely\nhematite (alpha-Fe2O3), to an imposed heat flux as is the case in real life\napplications. We present a methodology for the calculation of \\kappa as well as\nan adapted potential for hematite. Taking into account the size of the\nsimulation box, we show that not only the longitudinal size (in the direction\nof the heat flux) but also the transverse size plays a role in the\ndetermination of \\kappa and should be converged properly in order to have\nreliable results. Moreover we propose a comparison of thermal conductivity\ncalculations in two different crystallographic directions to highlight the\nspatial anisotropy and we investigate the non-linear temperature behavior\ntypically observed in NEMD methods.\n", "  In this work, a new integral equation (IE) based formulation is proposed\nusing vector and scalar potentials for electromagnetic scattering. The new\nintegral equations feature decoupled vector and scalar potentials that satisfy\nLorentz gauge. The decoupling of the two potentials allows low-frequency\nstability. The formulation presented also results in Fredholm integral\nequations of second kind. The spectral properties of second kind integral\noperators leads to a well-conditioned system.\n", "  New exact analytical bound-state solutions of the radial Dirac equation in\n3+1 dimensions for two sets of couplings and radial potential functions are\nobtained via mapping onto the nonrelativistic bound-state solutions of the\none-dimensional generalized Morse potential. The eigenfunctions are expressed\nin terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials, and the eigenenergies are\nexpressed in terms of solutions of equations that can be transformed into\npolynomial equations. Several analytical results found in the literature,\nincluding the Dirac oscillator, are obtained as particular cases of this\nunified approach.\n", "  Precise prediction of the neutrino flux is a key ingredient to achieving the\nphysics goals of accelerator-based neutrino experiments. In modern\naccelerator-based neutrino experiments, neutrino beams are created by colliding\nprotons with a nuclear target. Secondary hadrons are produced in these\ncollisions, and their decays contribute to the neutrino flux. The hadron\nproduction is the leading systematic uncertainty source on the neutrino flux\nprediction; therefore its precise measurement is desirable.\n  In these proceedings, review of recent hadron production measurements and the\nlatest results from the NA61/SPS Heavy Ion and Neutrino Experiment (NA61/SHINE)\nare presented. In addition, plans of NA61/SHINE hadron production measurements\nfor the next generation neutrino experiments and NA61/SHINE physics program\nextension beyond 2020 are discussed.\n", "  A key task in the emerging field of bioelectronics is the transduction\nbetween ionic/protonic and electronic signals at high fidelity. This is a\nconsiderable challenge since the two carrier types exhibit intrinsically\ndifferent physics and are best supported by very different materials types --\nelectronic signals in inorganic semiconductors and ionic/protonic signals in\norganic or bio-organic polymers, gels or electrolytes. Here we demonstrate a\nnew class of organic-inorganic transducing interface featuring semiconducting\nnanowires electrostatically gated using a solid proton-transporting hygroscopic\npolymer. This model platform allows us to study the basic transducing\nmechanisms as well as deliver high fidelity signal conversion by tapping into\nand drawing together the best candidates from traditionally disparate realms of\nelectronic materials research. By combining complementary n- and p-type\ntransducers we demonstrate functional logic with significant potential for\nscaling towards high-density integrated bioelectronic circuitry.\n", "  We present a $Chandra$ study of the hot intragroup medium (hIGM) of the\ngalaxy group NCG2563. The $Chandra$ mosaic observations, with a total exposure\ntime of ~430 ks, allow the gas density to be detected beyond $R_{200}$ and the\ngas temperature out to 0.75 $R_{200}$. This represents the first observational\nmeasurement of the physical properties of a poor groups beyond $R_{500}$. By\ncapitalizing on the exquisite spatial resolution of $Chandra$ that is capable\nto remove unrelated emission from point sources and substructures, we are able\nto radially constrain the inhomogeneities of gas (\"clumpiness\"), gas fraction,\ntemperature and entropy distribution. Although there is some uncertainty in the\nmeasurements, we find evidences of gas clumping in the virialization region,\nwith clumping factor of about 2 - 3 at $R_{200}$. The gas clumping-corrected\ngas fraction is significantly lower than the cosmological baryon budget. These\nresults may indicate a larger impact of the gas inhomogeneities with respect to\nthe prediction from hydrodynamic numerical simulations, and we discuss possible\nexplanations for our findings.\n", "  The dynamics of polypropylene glycol, both neat and attached to silica\nnanoparticles, were investigated using elastic neutron backscattering and\ndielectric spectroscopy. The mean square displacement measured by the former is\nsuppressed by the particles at temperatures corresponding to a dielectric\nsecondary relaxation (that involves only a portion of the repeat unit) and the\nsegmental relaxation (glass transition). Despite the suppression of the\ndisplacements, the motions are faster in the nanocomposite, primarily due to\npoorer packing (lower density) at the particle interface. At very low\ntemperatures we discovered a new dynamic process in the polymer. Reflecting its\nvery local nature, this process is unaffected by attachment of the chains to\nthe silica.\n", "  SNO+ inherits much of it's infrastructure from the Noble prize winning SNO\ndetector. However due to the two orders of magnitude increase in light output\nin liquid scintillator many upgrades have been made. Details of these upgrades\nand their commissioning status are presented, along with an update on the\ncurrent status of SNO+.\n", "  Core-collapse supernovae are one of the most energetic events in the universe\n($10^{46} J$). When a massive star (M $>$ 8 M$_{\\odot}$) ignites its last\nfusion stage where silicon fusion makes iron, its end is then very close.\nBasically, the core of the star falls inwardly and the gravitational energy is\nthen released in a supernova explosion. The basic picture of this explosion was\nconfirmed by the few neutrinos detected from the SN1987a supernova at\nKamiokande, IMB and Baksan detectors. However, there are many details that are\nstill unknown. Since then, a large detector network has grown with better\ncapabilities. Nowadays, in the case of a supernova explosion in our galaxy, the\ninformation that we would acquire would allow us to learn much more about these\nenergetic events and constrain our models. Here, I present a brief summary of\nthis network with special emphasis in SuperK-Gd (the upgraded Super-Kamiokande\ndetector with efficient neutron tagging).\n", "  The cold classical Kuiper belt objects have low inclinations and\neccentricities and are the only Kuiper belt population suspected to have formed\nin situ. Compared with the dynamically excited populations, which exhibit a\nbroad range of colours and a low binary fraction of ~10% cold classical Kuiper\nbelt objects typically have red optical colours with ~30% of the population\nfound in binary pairs; the origin of these differences remains unclear. We\nreport the detection of a population of blue-coloured, tenuously bound binaries\nresiding among the cold classical Kuiper belt objects. Here we show that widely\nseparated binaries could have survived push-out into the cold classical region\nduring the early phases of Neptune's migration. The blue binaries may be\ncontaminants, originating at ~38 au, and could provide a unique probe of the\nformative conditions in a region now nearly devoid of objects. The idea that\nthe blue objects, which are predominantly binary, are the products of push-out\nrequires that the planetesimals formed entirely as multiples. Plausible\nformation routes include planetesimal formation via pebble accretion and\nsubsequent binary production through dynamic friction and binary formation\nduring the collapse of a cloud of solids.\n", "  I discuss different theories of leptonic flavor and their capability of\ndescribing the features of the lepton sector, namely charged lepton masses,\nneutrino masses, lepton mixing angles and leptonic (low and high energy) CP\nphases. In particular, I show examples of theories with an abelian flavor\nsymmetry G_f, with a non-abelian G_f as well as theories with non-abelian G_f\nand CP.\n", "  The structural coefficient of restitution describes the kinetic energy\ndissipation upon low-velocity (~0.1 m/s) impact of a small asteroid lander,\nMASCOT, against a hard, ideally elastic plane surface. It is a crucial\nworst-case input for mission analysis for landing MACOT on a 1km asteroid in\n2018. We conducted pendulum tests and describe their analysis and the results.\n", "  This is a comment on 'Table-like magnetocaloric effect and enhanced\nrefrigerant capacity in Eu8Ga16Ge30-EuO composite materials', published few\nyears ago. Refrigerant Capacity (RC) and Relative Cooling Power (RCP) are\nproperties that characterize the magnetocaloric effect. RCP and mainly RC are\nalso important to characterize other i-caloric effects (electrocaloric and\nmechanocaloric effects). This comment intends to point out mistakes in a\nspecific paper and to be helpful to prevent inappropriate comparisons between\nRC and RCP.\n", "  Numerical simulations for 2-D unsteady, incompressible flow with heat\ntransfer in a four-sided lid-driven rectangular domain are reported in the\npresent study. For the four-sided lid-driven rectangular domain, the lower wall\nis moved to the left, the upper wall is moved to the right, while the right\nwall is moved upwards and the left wall is moved downwards. All four walls move\nwith equal speed. Different constant temperatures are applied to the left and\nright moving walls, and thermal insulation is applied to the upper and bottom\nmoving walls. The governing equations are discretized using the QUICK scheme of\nfinite volume methods. The SIMPLE algorithm is adopted to compute the numerical\nsolutions of the flow variables, $u$-velocity, $v$-velocity, $P$, and $\\theta$\nas well as local and average Nusselt numbers for $50 \\le Re \\le 1500$ and\n$Pr=6.63$. Due to the force generated by moving fluid, the direction of moving\nwalls and the Reynolds number affect fluid flow in the rectangular domain in\naddition, at different Reynolds numbers along the cold wall of the domain, the\nvariation in average and local Nusselt numbers reveals that overall heat\ntransfer increases isotherms showed that as Reynolds numbers increase, the\nhorizontal temperature gradient near the vertical walls decreases, because of\nwhich heat transfer decreases.decreases.\n", "  LANL Memorandum of potentially broad interest. A direct comparison is\nperformed between transport coefficients for weakly coupled plasmas obtained\nwith different formalisms to demonstrate that these formalisms give identical\npredictions. This is what one would expect since for weakly coupled plasmas all\nthe formalisms rely on the same physical assumptions and mathematical\napproximations.\n", "  The transfer of mechanical signals through cells is a complex phenomenon. To\nuncover a new mechanotransduction pathway, we study the frequency-dependent\ntransport of mechanical stimuli by single microtubules and small networks in a\nbottom-up approach using optically trapped beads as anchor points. We\ninterconnected microtubules to linear and triangular geometries to perform\nmicro-rheology by defined oscillations of the beads relative to each other. We\nfound a substantial stiffening of single filaments above a characteristic\ntransition frequency of 1-30 Hz depending on the filament's molecular\ncomposition. Below this frequency, filament elasticity only depends on its\ncontour and persistence length. Interestingly, this elastic behavior is\ntransferable to small networks, where we found the surprising effect that\nlinear two filament connections act as transistor-like, angle dependent\nmomentum filters, whereas triangular networks act as stabilizing elements.\nThese observations implicate that cells can tune mechanical signals by temporal\nand spatial filtering stronger and more flexibly than expected.\n", "  We present 1-second cadence observations of M32 (NGC221) with the CHIMERA\ninstrument at the Hale 200-inch telescope of the Palomar Observatory. Using\nfield stars as a baseline for relative photometry, we are able to construct a\nlight curve of the nucleus in the g-prime and r-prime band with 1sigma=36\nmilli-mag photometric stability. We derive a temporal power spectrum for the\nnucleus and find no evidence for a time-variable signal above the noise as\nwould be expected if the nuclear black hole were accreting gas. Thus, we are\nunable to constrain the spin of the black hole although future work will use\nthis powerful instrument to target more actively accreting black holes. Given\nthe black hole mass of (2.5+/-0.5)*10^6 Msun inferred from stellar kinematics,\nthe absence of a contribution from a nuclear time-variable signal places an\nupper limit on the accretion rate which is 4.6*10^{-8} of the Eddington rate, a\nfactor of two more stringent than past upper limits from HST. The low mass of\nthe black hole despite the high stellar density suggests that the gas liberated\nby stellar interactions was primarily at early cosmic times when the low-mass\nblack hole had a small Eddington luminosity. This is at least partly driven by\na top-heavy stellar initial mass function at early cosmic times which is an\nefficient producer of stellar mass black holes. The implication is that\nsupermassive black holes likely arise from seeds formed through the coalescence\nof 3-100 Msun mass black holes that then accrete gas produced through stellar\ninteraction processes.\n", "  In spite of many years of research, the mechanism of avian magnetoreception\nremains a mystery due to its seemingly insurmountable intricacies. Recently Xie\nand colleagues proposed that IscA1 can act as a protein biocompass due to the\nmeasured intrinsic ferromagneticity, and thus named it MagR. However, Meister's\ncalculations showed that the interaction energy of the magnetic moment of IscA1\nwith Earth's magnetic field is five magnitudes smaller than thermal fluctuation\nat room temperature. The other long-proposed compass protein is cryptochrome\n(Cry) with a mechanism of forming singlet-triplet radical pairs. However, this\nsensory mechanism still has no inferable information transmission routes. We\npropose a magnetoreception mechanism involving both the Cry and IscA1 proteins,\nthrough which photoinduced electrons are transported to redox-regulated ion\nchannels to provoke neuronal responses. The structural features of the\nCry-IscA1 complex that make it suitable for long-range electron transfer are\ndiscussed and how the magnetic effect leads to neuronal activity is described.\n", "  Recent work has brought renewed attention to the possibility that the cross\nsection for producing $n$ Higgs bosons grows large with $n$ at a sufficiently\nenergetic hadron collider. In particular, this \"Higgsplosion'\" mechanism has\nbeen suggested as a solution to the hierarchy problem. We investigate the\nphenomenology of this scenario. Discovery is trivial, so we consider several\nvariables for use in measuring large Higgs multiplicities and evaluate their\neffectiveness. We find that a $10$% level measurement of the number of Higgs\nbosons is possible with a handful of events, using the scalar sum of jet\ntransverse momenta, but determining the exact multiplicity may take a few\nthousand events, depending on the degree of statistical significance desired\nfor the measurement. While this situation may be acceptable given the\npotentially large cross sections in this scenario, future research to improve\nthe measurement is warranted.\n", "  We present a framework to segregate the roles of elastic and non-elastic\ndeformations in the examination of real-space experiments of solid-solid\nMartensitic transitions. The Martensitic transformation of a\nbody-centred-tetragonal(BCT) to a body-centred-orthorhombic(BCO) crystal\nstructure has been studied in a model system of micron-scale ionic microgel\ncolloids. Non-affine fluctuations, i.e., displacement fluctuations that do not\narise from purely elastic(affine) deformations, are detected in particle\nconfigurations acquired from the experiment. Tracking these fluctuations serves\nas a highly sensitive tool in signaling the onset of the Martensitic transition\nand precisely locating particle rearrangements occurring at length scales of a\nfew particle diameters. Particle rearrangements associated with non-affine\ndisplacement modes become increasingly favorable during the transformation\nprocess. The nature of the displacement fluctuation modes that govern the\ntransformation are shown to be different from those predominant in an\nequilibrium crystal. We show that BCO crystallites formed through shear may,\nremarkably, co-exist with those resulting from local rearrangements within the\nsame sample.\n", "  The photon production rate from the deconfined medium is analyzed with the\nphoton self-energy constructed from the quark propagator obtained by the\nnumerical simulation on the quenched lattice for two values of temperature,\n$T=1.5T_{\\rm c}$ and $3T_{\\rm c}$, above the critical temperature $T_{\\rm c}$.\nThe photon self-energy is calculated by the Schwinger-Dyson equation with the\nlattice quark propagator and a vertex function determined so as to satisfy the\nWard-Takahashi identity. The obtained photon production rate exhibits a similar\nbehavior as the perturbative results at the energy of photons larger than\n$0.5$~GeV.\n", "  Due to its two dimensional nature, ferromagnetism and charge doping can be\ninduced by proximity and electric field effects in graphene. Taking advantage\nof these features, we propose an electrically engineered spin valve by\ncombining two magnetic insulators (using EuO, EuS, or YIG) and three coating\ngates. Two top gates are used to cancel the heavy electron doping's in these\nmagnets and one back gate is used to utilize the normal or half-metallic\nferromagnetisms. We demonstrate that, when the second top gate is tuned to\nutilize the insulating or spin insulating states, huge giant magnetoresistance\n(GMR) at high temperature (several times of $10^5\\%$ at 68K and 100K) can be\nachieved for EuO and YIG. These results imply a distinguished GMR that is\nmagnetism tunable, vertical configured (ferromagnetism versus insulating), and\nmagnetic field-free. Our work may offer a viable path to a tantalizing magnetic\nfield-free spintronics.\n", "  We demonstrate all-optical demultiplexing at 160 Gigabits per second in the\nC-band, based on nonlinear optics using four-wave mixing (FWM) in a silicon\nnanowire. We achieve error-free operation with a penalty of ~ 3.9dB.\n", "  Three questions should be interesting, for better understanding of the basic\nphysics of damage creation and stopping ions of different types, in the damaged\ntube: 1) Between the mass and charge effects, i.e. potential- independent and\npotential- dependent effects on the damaged tube, Which ones may the cross-\nsection $\\sigma$ effects belong to? 2) One method has calculated number of\nenergetic recoils (both ions and carbon atoms), which hit the metal layer below\nthe damaged tube, to study the stopping of both incident ions and recoil carbon\natoms in it. Another method has calculated the ion- deposited energy\n$E_0-E_{penetrating}$ in the damaged tube, to distinguish between penetrating\nand stopped ions. Which method is better for studying the stopping between two\nones? 3) Why can tens of the graphitic shells easily stop energetic ions with\nenergies up to 10 keV? Which effects on the stopping? In kinetic energy\nformulas, we give answers for discussion.\n", "  Experimental and numerical study of the steady-state cyclonic vortex from\nisolated heat source in a rotating fluid layer is described. The structure of\nlaboratory cyclonic vortex is similar to the typical structure of tropical\ncyclones from observational data and numerical modelling including secondary\nflows in the boundary layer. Differential characteristics of the flow were\nstudied by numerical simulation using CFD software FlowVision. Helicity\ndistribution in rotating fluid layer with localized heat source was analysed.\nTwo mechanisms which play role in helicity generation are found. The first one\nis the strong correlation of cyclonic vortex and intensive upward motion in the\ncentral part of the vessel. The second one is due to large gradients of\nvelocity on the periphery. The integral helicity in the considered case is\nsubstantial and its relative level is high.\n", "  Quantum information science has profoundly changed the ways we understand,\nstore, and process information. A major challenge in this field is to look for\nan efficient means for classifying quantum state. For instance, one may want to\ndetermine if a given quantum state is entangled or not. However, the process of\na complete characterization of quantum states, known as quantum state\ntomography, is a resource-consuming operation in general. An attractive\nproposal would be the use of Bell's inequalities as an entanglement witness,\nwhere only partial information of the quantum state is needed. The problem is\nthat entanglement is necessary but not sufficient for violating Bell's\ninequalities, making it an unreliable state classifier. Here we aim at solving\nthis problem by the methods of machine learning. More precisely, given a family\nof quantum states, we randomly picked a subset of it to construct a\nquantum-state classifier, accepting only partial information of each quantum\nstate. Our results indicated that these transformed Bell-type inequalities can\nperform significantly better than the original Bell's inequalities in\nclassifying entangled states. We further extended our analysis to three-qubit\nand four-qubit systems, performing classification of quantum states into\nmultiple species. These results demonstrate how the tools in machine learning\ncan be applied to solving problems in quantum information science.\n", "  We report an investigation of the superconducting states of\n$\\mathrm{Lu}_3\\mathrm{Os}_4\\mathrm{Ge}_{13}$ and\n$\\mathrm{Y}_3\\mathrm{Ru}_4\\mathrm{Ge}_{13}$ single crystals by measurements of\nthe electrical resistivity, ac susceptibility and London penetration depth. The\nanalysis of the penetration depth and the derived superfluid density indicates\nthe presence of nodeless superconductivity and suggest that there are multiple\nsuperconducting gaps in both materials. Furthermore, ac susceptibility\nmeasurements of both compounds display the peak effect in the low temperature\nregion of the $H-T$ phase diagram. This anomalous increase of the critical\ncurrent with field gives an indication of a change of the arrangement of flux\nlines in the mixed state, as found in some of the isostructural stannide\nmaterials.\n", "  Ac electrical measurements have been reported for alkali halide mixed\ncrystals that were melt grown from NaCl, KCl and KBr starting materials. They\nshowed a nonlinear variation of all the electrical parameters with the bulk\ncomposition. Here, we show that these mixed systems, depending on their major\nconstituent, are classified into three categories in each of which, the\nactivation energy for the ac conductivity increases linearly with B$\\Omega$,\nwhere B is the isothermal bulk modulus and $\\Omega$ the mean volume per atom.\n", "  The subject of this work is the shock development problem in fluid mechanics.\nA shock originates from an acoustically spacelike surface in spacetime at which\nthe 1st derivatives of the physical variables blow up. The solution requires\nthe construction of a hypersurface in spacetime which is acoustically timelike\nas viewed from its future, acoustically spacelike as viewed from its past, the\nshock hypersurface, across which the physical variables suffer discontinuities\nobeying jump conditions in accordance with the integral form of the particle\nand energy-momentum conservation laws. Mathematically, this is a free boundary\nproblem, with nonlinear conditions at the free boundary, for a 1st order\nquasilinear hyperbolic system of p.d.e., with characteristic initial data which\nare singular at the past boundary of the initial characteristic hypersurface,\nthat boundary being the surface of origin. This work solves, in any number of\nspatial dimensions, a restricted form of the problem which retains the\nessential difficulties due to the singular nature of the surface of origin. The\nsolution is accomplished through the introduction of new geometric and analytic\nmethods.\n", "  We analyze the collision of a high energy electron beam with an oscillating\nelectric and magnetic field configuration, which represents a three-dimensional\nstanding electromagnetic wave. The radiating electrons are stopped at the\ndistance of the order of or less than the electromagnetic wave wavelength, and\nbecome trapped near the electric field local maxima due to the nonlinear\ndependence of the radiation friction force on the electromagnetic field\nstrength, while the quantum effects on the radiation friction remain\nnegligible.\n", "  First results are presented obtained with an experimental setup developed to\nrecord IR spectra of rotationally state-selected ions. The method we use is a\nstate-selective version of a method developed by S. Schlemmer, D. Gerlich and\ncoworkers (Int. J. Mass. Spec. 185, 589 (1999); J. Chem. Phys. 117, 2068\n(2002)) to record IR spectra of ions. Ions are produced in specific rotational\nlevels using mass-analyzed-threshold-ionization spectroscopy. The\nstate-selected ions generated by pulsed-field ionization of Rydberg states of\nhigh principal quantum number ($n\\approx200$) are extracted toward an octupole\nion guide containing a neutral target gas. Prior to entering the octupole, the\nions are excited by an IR laser. The target gas is chosen so that only excited\nions react to form product ions. These product ions are detected mass\nselectively as a function of the IR laser wavenumber. To illustrate this\nmethod, we present IR spectra of C$_2$H$_2^+$ in selected rotational levels of\nthe $^2\\Pi_{\\textrm{u,}3/2}$ and $^2\\Pi_{\\textrm{u,}1/2}$ spin-orbit components\nof the vibronic ground state.\n", "  The Adler-Bobenko-Suris (ABS) list contains all scalar quadrilateral\nequations which are consistent around the cube. Each equation in the ABS list\nadmits a beautiful decomposition. In this paper, we first revisit these\ndecomposition formulas, by which we construct B\\\"acklund transformations (BTs)\nand consistent triplets. Some BTs are used to construct new solutions, lattice\nequations and weak Lax pairs.\n", "  Since polycrystals of alkali halides are highly useful as components in\noptical devices, a number of mixed crystals of NaBr and KBr have been prepared\nfrom melt by other workers. Among these crystals, it was reported that the\npolycrystal Na$_{0.4}$K$_{0.6}$Br exhibits the strongest temperature variation\nof the dielectric constant. Here, we show quantitatively that this is due to\nthe temperature variation of the ionic polarizability.\n", "  Heavy-fermion materials are mostly rare-earth or actinide intermetallics with\nvery few exceptions in d-electron systems. The physical mechanism for these\nd-electron heavy fermion systems remains unclear. Here by studying the\nquadruple-perovskite CaCu3Ir4O12, we propose a symmetry-based mechanism that\nmay enforce heavy-fermion physics in d-electron systems. We show that electron\nhoppings between neighboring Cu 3d-orbitals are strictly prohibited by the\ncrystal symmetry, so that Cu 3d-electrons can only become delocalized through\nhybridization with other more itinerant bands, resembling that in typical\nheavy-fermion rare-earth intermetallics. This provides a useful way to enforce\nheavy-fermion physics in d-electron systems and may help future design of new\nheavy-fermion materials.\n", "  The term values of all rotational levels of the\n$^4$He${_2}^+\\,X^+\\,^2\\Sigma_u^+\\,(\\nu^+=0)$ ground vibronic state with\nrotational quantum number $N^+\\le 19$ have been determined with an accuracy of\n8 x 10$^{-4}$ cm$^{-1}$ ($\\sim{25}$ MHz) by MQDT-assisted Rydberg spectroscopy\nof metastable He$_2^*$. Comparison of these term values with term values\nrecently calculated ab initio by Tung et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 136, 104309\n(2012)] reveal discrepancies that rapidly increase with increasing rotational\nquantum number and reach values of 0.07 cm$^{-1}$ ($\\sim{2.1}$ GHz) at\n$N^+=19$.\n", "  Almost all parameterizations of turbulence in NWP models and GCM make the\nassumption of equality of exchange coefficients for heat $K_h$ and water $K_w$.\nHowever, large uncertainties exists in old papers published in the 1950s, 1960s\nand 1970s, where the turbulent Lewis number Le_t $= K_h / K_w$ have been\nevaluated from observations and then set to Le_t$=1$.\n  The aim of this note is: 1) to trust the recommendations of Richardson\n(1919), who suggested to use the moist-air entropy as a variable on which the\nturbulence is acting; 2) to compute a new exchange coefficients $K_s$ for the\nmoist-air entropy; 3) to determine the values of the new entropy-Lewis number\nLe_ts $= K_s / K_w$ from observations (M\\'et\\'eopole-Flux and Cabauw masts) and\nfrom LES and SCM outputs for the IHOP case (Couvreux et al., 2005).\n  It is shown that values of Le_ts significantly different from $1$ are\nfrequently observed and may have large consequences on the way the turbulence\nfluxes are computed in NWP models and GCMs.\n", "  Studies of ion-molecule reactions at low temperatures are difficult because\nstray electric fields in the reaction volume affect the kinetic energy of\ncharged reaction partners. We describe a new experimental approach to study\nion-molecule reactions at low temperatures and present, as example, a\nmeasurement of the ${\\rm H}_2^+ + {\\rm H}_2\\rightarrow {\\rm H}_3^+ + {\\rm H}$\nreaction with the ${\\rm H}_2^+$ ion prepared in a single rovibrational state at\ncollision energies in the range $E_{\\rm col}/k_{\\rm B} = 5$-60 K. To reach such\nlow collision energies, we use a merged-beam approach and observe the reaction\nwithin the orbit of a Rydberg electron, which shields the ions from stray\nfields. The first beam is a supersonic beam of pure ground-state H$_2$\nmolecules and the second is a supersonic beam of H$_2$ molecules excited to\nRydberg-Stark states of principal quantum number $n$ selected in the range\n20-40. Initially, the two beams propagate along axes separated by an angle of\n10$^\\circ$. To merge the two beams, the Rydberg molecules in the latter beam\nare deflected using a surface-electrode Rydberg-Stark deflector. The collision\nenergies of the merged beams are determined by measuring the velocity\ndistributions of the two beams and they are adjusted by changing the\ntemperature of the pulsed valve used to generate the ground-state ${\\rm H}_2$\nbeam and by adapting the electric-potential functions to the electrodes of the\ndeflector. The collision energy is varied down to below $E_{\\rm col}/k_{\\rm B}=\n10$ K, i.e., below $E_{\\rm col}\\approx 1$ meV, with an energy resolution of 100\n$\\mu$eV. We demonstrate that the Rydberg electron acts as a spectator and does\nnot affect the cross sections, which are found to closely follow a\nclassical-Langevin-capture model in the collision-energy range investigated.\nBecause all neutral atoms and molecules can be excited to Rydberg states, this\nmethod of studying\n", "  Assuming basic familiarity with neutrino physics, I give a telegraphic and\npanoramic view of the current status and the main open challenges in the field.\nI also illustrate how the mechanism responsible for neutrino mass generation\nmay shed light upon some of the current puzzles in particle physics as well as\ncosmology\n", "  We calculate the form factors of the $K \\to \\pi l \\nu$ semileptonic decays in\nthree-flavor lattice QCD, and study their chiral behavior as a function of the\nmomentum transfer and the Nambu-Goldstone boson masses. Chiral symmetry is\nexactly preserved by using the overlap quark action, which enables us to\ndirectly compare the lattice data with chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). We\ngenerate gauge ensembles at a lattice spacing of 0.11fm with four pion masses\ncovering 290-540 MeV and a strange quark mass m_s close to its physical value.\nBy using the all-to-all quark propagator, we calculate the vector and scalar\nform factors with high precision. Their dependence on m_s and the momentum\ntransfer is studied by using the reweighting technique and the twisted boundary\nconditions for the quark fields. We compare the results for the semileptonic\nform factors with ChPT at next-to-next-to leading order in detail. While many\nlow-energy constants appear at this order, we make use of our data of the light\nmeson electromagnetic form factors in order to control the chiral\nextrapolation. We determine the normalization of the form factors as f_+(0) =\n0.9636(36)(+57/-35), and observe reasonable agreement of their shape with\nexperiment.\n", "  Dynamical (propagating) torsion can be observed by using conventional\ngravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, LISA and bar detectors. We\ndiscuss specific signatures of different types of torsion, in particular those\nof vector and mixed symmetric torsion (skew symmetric torsion cannot be\ndetected in this way). These signatures are specific to torsion and therefore\nthey can be unambiguously distinguished from those of gravitational waves.\n", "  We investigate the transition probability of a Unruh-deWitt particle detector\nevolving in flat space and in a wormhole spacetime, in various scenarios. In\nMinkowski space, we look at the response of the detector on trajectories having\ndiscontinuities and rapid variations, as well as the effect of finite-time\ncoupling. It is found that these features induce spurious oscillations in the\nprobability and rate of transition. At large times the oscillations are damped\nand the probability tends to a constant value. Next, we look at the response of\nan inertial detector on a radial trajectory that passes through a thin-shell\nwormhole. After finding the appropriate modes, we look at the renormalized\ndetector response, defined by subtracting the flat space analogues from the\npartial probabilities. The resulting curve has a peak around the wormhole\nthroat followed by a period of damped oscillations, before stabilizing to a\nconstant value. This is very similar to the flat space results, which is\nsurprising given that in this case the trajectory is continuous. The features\nof the transition probability are due entirely to the nontrivial topology\ninduced by the wormhole.\n", "  Recently, the educational initiative TED-Ed has published a popular brain\nteaser coined the 'frog riddle', which illustrates non-intuitive implications\nof conditional probabilities. In its intended form, the frog riddle is a\nreformulation of the classic boy-girl paradox. However, the authors alter the\nnarrative of the riddle in a form, that subtly changes the way information is\nconveyed. The presented solution, unfortunately, does not take this point into\nfull account, and as a consequence, lacks consistency in the sense that\ndifferent parts of the problem are treated on unequal footing. We here review,\nhow the mechanism of receiving information matters, and why this is exactly the\nreason that such kind of problems challenge intuitive thinking. Subsequently,\nwe present a generalized solution, that accounts for the above difficulties,\nand preserves full logical consistency. Eventually, the relation to the\nboy-girl paradox is discussed.\n", "  A totally new energy harvesting architecture that exploits ambient\nelectric-field (E-field) emitting from fluorescent light fixtures is presented.\nA copper plate, 50 x 50 cm in size, is placed in between the ambient field to\nextract energy by capacitive coupling. A low voltage prototype is designed,\nstructured and tested on a conventional ceiling-type 4-light fluorescent\ntroffer operating in 50 Hz 220 V AC power grid. It is examined that the\nharvester is able to collect roughly 1.25 J of energy in 25 min when a 0.1 F of\nsuper-capacitor is employed. The equivalent circuit and the physical model of\nthe proposed harvesting paradigm are provided, and the attainable power is\nevaluated in both theoretical and experimental manner. The scavenged energy is\nplanned to be utilized for building battery-less Internet of Things (IoT)\nnetworks that are obliged to sense environmental parameters, analyze the\ngathered data, and remotely inform a higher authority within predefined\nperiods.\n", "  The current-driven domain wall motion in a ratchet memory due to spin-orbit\ntorques is studied from both full micromagnetic simulations and the one\ndimensional model. Within the framework of this model, the integration of the\nanisotropy energy contribution leads to a new term in the well known q-$\\Phi$\nequations, being this contribution responsible for driving the domain wall to\nan equilibrium position. The comparison between the results drawn by the one\ndimensional model and full micromagnetic simulations proves the utility of such\na model in order to predict the current-driven domain wall motion in the\nratchet memory. Additionally, since current pulses are applied, the paper shows\nhow the proper working of such a device requires the adequate balance of\nexcitation and relaxation times, being the latter longer than the former.\nFinally, the current-driven regime of a ratchet memory is compared to the\nfield-driven regime described elsewhere, then highlighting the advantages of\nthis current-driven regime.\n", "  We report the capability to simulate in a quantum mechanical tight-binding\n(TB) atomistic fashion NW devices featuring several hundred to millions of\natoms and diameter up to 18 nm. Such simulations go far beyond what is\ntypically affordable with today's supercomputers using a traditional real space\n(RS) TB Hamiltonian technique. We have employed an innovative TB mode space\n(MS) technique instead and demonstrate large speedup (up to 10,000x) while\nkeeping good accuracy (error smaller than 1 percent) compared to the RS NEGF\nmethod. Such technique and capability open new avenues to explore and\nunderstand the physics of nanoscale and mesoscopic devices dominated by quantum\neffects. In particular, our method addresses in an unprecedented way the\ntechnological relevant case of band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) in III-V nanowire\nMOSFETs and broken gap heterojunction tunnel-FETs (TFETs). We demonstrate an\naccurate match of simulated BTBT currents to experimental measurements in a\n[111] InAs NW having a 12 nm diameter and a 300 nm long channel. We apply the\npredictivity of our TB MS simulations and report an in-depth atomistic study of\nthe scaling potential of III-V GAA nanowire heterojunction n and pTFETs\nquantifying the benefits of this technology for low-power, low-voltage CMOS\napplication. At VDD = 0.3 V and IOFF = 50 pA/um, the on-current (Ion) and\nenergy-delay product (ETP) gain over a Si NW GAA MOSFET are 58x and 56x\nrespectively.\n", "  This study reveals the influence of the surface energy and solid/liquid\nboundary condition on the breakup mechanism of dewetting ultra-thin polymer\nfilms. Using silane self-assembled monolayers, SiO$_2$ substrates are rendered\nhydrophobic and provide a strong slip rather than a no-slip solid/liquid\nboundary condition. On undergoing these changes, the thin-film breakup\nmorphology changes dramatically -- from a spinodal mechanism to a breakup which\nis governed by nucleation and growth. The experiments reveal a dependence of\nthe hole density on film thickness and temperature. The combination of lowered\nsurface energy and hydrodynamic slip brings the studied system closer to the\nconditions encountered in bursting unsupported films. As for unsupported\npolymer films, a critical nucleus size is inferred from a free energy model.\nThis critical nucleus size is supported by the film breakup observed in the\nexperiments using high speed \\emph{in situ} atomic force microscopy.\n", "  Nanoparticles grown in reactive plasmas and nanodusty plasmas gain high\ninterest from basic science and technology. One of the great challenges of\nnanodusty plasmas is the in-situ diagnostic of the nanoparticle size and\nrefractive index. The analysis of scattered light by means of the Mie solution\nof the Maxwell equations was proposed and used as an in-situ size diagnostic\nduring the past two decades. Today, imaging ellipsometry techniques and the\ninvestigation of dense, i. e. optically thick nanoparticle clouds demand for\nanalysis methods to take multiple scattering into account. We present the first\n3D Monte-Carlo polarized radiative transfer simulations of the scattered light\nin a dense nanodusty plasma. This technique extends the existing diagnostic\nmethods for the in-situ analysis of the properties of nanoparticles to systems\nwhere multiple scattering can not be neglected.\n", "  Kippenhahn discovered a real algebraic plane curve whose convex hull is the\nnumerical range of a matrix. The correctness of this theorem was called into\nquestion when Chien and Nakazato found an example where the spatial analogue\nfails. They showed that the mentioned plane curve indeed lies inside the\nnumerical range. We prove the easier converse direction of the theorem. Finding\nhigher-dimensional generalizations of Kippenhahn's theorem is a challenge in\nreal algebraic geometry.\n", "  Fully exploiting the properties of 2D crystals requires a mass production\nmethod able to produce heterostructures of arbitrary complexity on any\nsubstrate, including plastic. Solution processing of graphene allows simple and\nlow-cost techniques such as inkjet printing to be used for device fabrication.\nHowever, available inkjet printable formulations are still far from ideal as\nthey are either based on toxic solvents, have low concentration, or require\ntime-consuming and expensive formulation processing. In addition, none of those\nformulations are suitable for thin-film heterostructure fabrication due to the\nre-mixing of different 2D crystals, giving rise to uncontrolled interfaces,\nwhich results in poor device performance and lack of reproducibility. In this\nwork we show a general formulation engineering approach to achieve highly\nconcentrated, and inkjet printable water-based 2D crystal formulations, which\nalso provides optimal film formation for multi-stack fabrication. We show\nexamples of all-inkjet printed heterostructures, such as large area arrays of\nphotosensors on plastic and paper and programmable logic memory devices, fully\nexploiting the design flexibility of inkjet printing. Finally, dose-escalation\ncytotoxicity assays in vitro also confirm the inks biocompatible character,\nrevealing the possibility of extending use of such 2D crystal formulations to\ndrug delivery and biomedical applications.\n", "  Many well-known and well-studied four by four universal quantum logic gates\nin the literature are of a specific form, the so called eight-vertex form\n\\eqref{8vertexform} \\cite{kaufman etal 05-1,kaufman etal 05-2}, or {\\it\nsimilar} to it.\n  We present a formalism for universal quantum logic gates of such a form.\nFirst, we provide explicit formulas in terms of matrix entries, which are the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for such a matrix to be a solution to the\nYang-Baxter equation \\eqref{byb}. Then, combining this with the conditions\nneeded for being unitary \\eqref{unitarycond} and being entangling\n\\eqref{entanglingcond}, we give a full description of entangling unitary\nsolutions to the Yang-Baxter equation (hence, universal quantum logic gates) of\nsuch a specific form. We investigate in detail all the possible cases where\nsome of the eight main entries might or might not be zero.\n", "  Low mass galaxies are thought to provide the bulk of the ionizing radiation\nnecessary to reionize the Universe. The amount of photons escaping the galaxies\nis poorly constrained theoretically, and difficult to measure observationally.\nYet it is an essential parameter of reionization models. We study in detail how\nionizing radiation can leak from high redshift galaxies. For this purpose, we\nuse a series of high resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations, zooming on\nthree dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context. We find that the energy and\nmomentum input from the supernova explosions has a pivotal role in regulating\nthe escape fraction, by disrupting dense star forming clumps, and clearing\nsight lines in the halo. In the absence of supernovae, photons are absorbed\nvery locally, within the birth clouds of massive stars. We follow the time\nevolution of the escape fraction, and find that it can vary by more than six\norders of magnitude. This explains the large scatter in the value of the escape\nfraction found by previous studies. This fast variability also impacts the\nobservability of the sources of reionization: a survey even as deep as $M_{\\rm\nUV} = -14$ would miss about half of the underlying population of\nLyman-continuum emitters.\n", "  We show that the Clifford gates and stabilizer circuits in the quantum\ncomputing literature, which admit efficient classical simulation, are\nequivalent to affine signatures under a unitary condition. The latter is a\nknown class of tractable functions under the Holant framework.\n", "  Heuristic derivations of the Navier-Stokes equations are unable to reveal the\napplicability limits of these equations. In this paper we rederive the\nNavier-Stokes equations from kinetic theory, using a method that affords a step\nby step insight into the required simplifying assumptions. The major, but not\nthe only task on this way is to find the conditions needed to truncate the\nresulting infinite system of transport equations at a finite level. The minimal\nobtainable closed set comprises three equations, for the particle number\ndensity {\\it N}, the macroscopic velocity {\\bf v}, and the temperature {\\it T}.\nIt is verified that this 3--equation system conserves the total energy, i.e.,\nthe sum of kinetic and internal energy. As a consequence, the energy is not\nconserved if the integrity of this closed system is violated, as for instance\nin the case of the so-called incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (and\nlikewise the incompressible Euler equations), where the equation for T is\ndiscarded and replaced by {\\nabla \\cdot {\\bf v} = 0}. The Navier-Stokes system\nin its common form rests upon the tacit assumption that the particles are\npoints without finite volume and without collective forces between them,\nwhereby dense gases and liquids are excluded. In the final section of this\npaper, an attempt is made to generalize the equations for applicability to real\nfluids.\n", "  Casimir forces from fermions in an extra dimension can stabilise\nRandall-Sundrum models. Contrary to previous expectations, the stabilisation\ncan produce large electroweak hierarchies without fine tuning. The Casimir\nstabilisation occurs in the same five-dimensional fermion models which have\nbeen found to give the observed fermion mass hierarchies. This is shown for\nmasses generated by the Higgs mechanism and by a Higgsless symmetry breaking\nmechanism, where new light Kaluza-Klein states are presented\n", "  The photoelectron spectrum of water has been recorded in the vicinity of the\n${\\mathrm {\\tilde A^+}}$ $\\leftarrow$ $\\tilde{\\mathrm{X}}$ transition between\n112 000 and 116 000 cm$^{-1}$ (13.89-14.38 eV). The high-resolution allowed the\nobservation of the rotational structure of several bands. Rotational\nassignments of the transitions involving the $\\Pi(080)$, $\\Sigma(070)$ and\n$\\Pi(060)$ vibronic states of the $\\tilde{\\mathrm{A}}^+$ electronic state are\ndeduced from previous studies of the $\\tilde{\\mathrm{A}}^+ -\n\\tilde{\\mathrm{X}}^+$ band system of H$_2$O$^+$ (Lew, Can. J. Phys. 54, 2028\n(1976) and Huet et al., J. Chem. Phys. 107, 5645 (1997)) and photoionization\nselection rules. The transition to the $\\Sigma(030)$ vibronic state is\ntentatively assigned.\n", "  It is shown that the proof of [1] that the specific heat of the system of\nclassical point particles interacting with each other via uniform gravitational\npotential energy may be negative is incorrect.\n", "  We use a direct observational approach to investigate the possibility of\ntesting the Copernican principle with data from upcoming radio surveys. In\nparticular we illustrate the importance of measuring derivatives transverse to\nthe past light-cone when prior knowledge of the value of the cosmological\nconstant is not available.\n", "  We investigate transport and thermoelectric properties of hybrid systems\nbased on a single-level quantum dot and one superconducting lead. The other\nlead is generally normal-metallic ferromagnet. In the latter case\nsingle-particle transport is spin-polarized. Our main interest is in the\ninterplay of Andreev tunneling of Cooper pairs and single-particle tunneling.\nThe latter is responsible for relatively large thermopower and figure of merit\ndue to a diverging density of single-particle states at the superconducting gap\nedges. System with ferromagnetic and superconducting leads can also reveal spin\nthermoelectric phenomena. Finite superconducting gap is considered within the\nBCS theory, and the thermoelectric coefficients are calculated by means of\nnonequilibrium Green's function technique within Hartree-Fock like\napproximation with respect to the intradot Coulomb interaction.\n", "  It has long been a challenge to describe the origin of unconventional\nsuperconductivity. The two known examples with high Tc, based on iron and\ncopper, have very different electronic structures, while other materials with\nsimilar electronic structure may not show superconductivity at all. In this\npaper, the authors show that by using high accuracy diffusion Monte Carlo\ncalculations, the unconventional superconductors of both high Tc types form a\ncluster at intermediate spin-charge coupling. The spin-charge coupling may\nserve as a normal state marker for unconventional superconductivity, and\nprovides evidence that unconventional superconductivity is due to interaction\nof charge with local spins in materials.\n", "  We consider a model with three Higgs doublet in a discrete $B - L\\times\n\\mathbb{Z}_3$ discrete symmetries. Two of the scalar doublets are inert due to\nthe $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. We calculated all the mass spectra in the scalar\nand lepton sectors and accommodate the leptonic mixing matrix as well.\n", "  As part of a project to better characterize comparatively bright, yet little\nstudied cataclysmic variables time resolved photometry of the three eclipsing\nnovalike variables EC 21178-5417, GS Pav und V345 Pav is presented. Previously\nknown orbital periods are significantly improved and long-term ephemeris are\nderived. Variations of eclipse profiles, occurring on time scales of days to\nweeks, are analyzed. Out of eclipse the light curves are characterized by low\nscale flickering superposed on more gradual variations with amplitudes limited\nto a few tenths of a magnitude and profiles which at least in EC 21178-5417 and\nGS Pav roughly follow the same pattern in all observed cycles. Additionally,\nsigns for variations on the time scale of some tens of minutes are seen in GS\nPav, most clearly in two subsequent nights when in the first of these a signal\nwith a period of 15.7 min was observed over several hours. In the second night\nvariations with twice this period were seen. While no additional insight could\nbe gained on quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) and dwarf nova oscillations in\nEC 21178-5417, previously detected by Warner et al. (2003), and while such\noscillations could not be found in V345 Pav, stacked power spectra of GS Pav\nclearly reveal the presence of QPOs over time intervals of several hours with\nperiods varying between 200 sec and 500 sec in that system.\n", "  We consider the double-shock structure of ultra-relativistic flows produced\nby the interaction of magnetized wind with magnetized external medium. The\ncontact discontinuity (CD) is a special point in the flow - density, kinetic\npressure and magnetic field experience a jump or are non-analytic on the CD. To\nconnect dynamically the outside region (the forward shock flow) with the inside\nregion (the reverse shock flow) requires resolving flow singularities at the\ncontact discontinuity. On the CD the pressure is communicated exclusively by\nthe magnetic field on both sides - the CD becomes an Alfven tangential\ndiscontinuity. Thus, the dynamic amplification of the magnetic field leads to a\nformation of a narrow magnetosheath. We discussed a possibility that particles\nemitting early $X$-ray afterglows, as well as Fermi GeV photons, are\naccelerated via magnetic reconnection processes in the post-reverse shock\nregion, and in the magnetosheath in particular.\n", "  We consider the problem of transmitting classical information over a\ntime-invariant channel with memory. A popular class of time-invariant channels\nwith memory are finite-state-machine channels, where a \\emph{classical} state\nevolves over time and governs the relationship between the classical input and\nthe classical output of the channel. For such channels, various techniques have\nbeen developed for estimating and bounding the information rate. In this paper\nwe consider a class of time-invariant channels where a \\emph{quantum} state\nevolves over time and governs the relationship between the classical input and\nthe classical output of the channel. We propose algorithms for estimating and\nbounding the information rate of such channels. In particular, we discuss\nsuitable graphical models for doing the relevant computations.\n", "  The main result of this paper is a discrete Lawson correspondence between\ndiscrete CMC surfaces in R^3 and discrete minimal surfaces in S^3. This is a\ncorrespondence between two discrete isothermic surfaces. We show that this\ncorrespondence is an isometry in the following sense: it preserves the metric\ncoefficients introduced previously by Bobenko and Suris for isothermic nets.\nExactly as in the smooth case, this is a correspondence between nets with the\nsame Lax matrices, and the immersion formulas also coincide with the smooth\ncase.\n", "  The mean field type approach based on the self-consistent consideration of an\neffective field created by electron transfer is developed for a description of\nthermodynamics of the Hubbard type models with an infinitely large on-site\nrepulsion. This procedure, formulated by Izyumov et al, is an extension of the\nrecently proposed generalized random phase approximation(GRPA).\n  Within this approach, the thermodynamic properties of the two-sublattice\npseudospin-electron model (the Hubbard model with local anharmonicity) are\nstudied. Such a model can be used for a description of dielectric properties of\nYBaCuO-type superconductors along c-axis; pseudospins represent anharmonic\nmotions of apical oxygens O4. It is shown that there are either phase\ntransitions in the model with jumps of the mean values of a pseudospin and of\nelectron concentration (in the $\\mu=const$ regime) or the phase separation (in\nthe $n=const$ regime). The phase transitions or phase separation are caused by\npseudospin-pseudospin interaction as well as by electron transfer (the latter\nresults in appearing of effective interaction between pseudospins). The\npossibility of the ferroelectric type ordering of pseudospins is investigated.\n", "  In this brief review of recent theoretical developments associated with the\nsearch for dark matter I describe the following: why baryons are now ruled out\nas dark matter candidates; SUSY WIMPS and signatures in the MSSM and NMSSM why\nclaimed indirect signatures are probably not WIMP related, why axions may be of\nnew interest, how WIMP detection might tell us about the galactic halo, and how\ntheorists are preparing to avoid the next generation of experimental\nconstraints.\n"]}
