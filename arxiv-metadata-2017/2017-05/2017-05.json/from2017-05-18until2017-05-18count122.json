In a first\nanalysis, we consider current measurements of the expansion rate H(z) (with two\npriors on the local Hubble parameter) and 288 Type Ia supernovae from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (within the framework of the mlcs2k2 light-curve fitting\nmethod). We find that the joint analysis involving these data is an interesting\ntool to impose limits on the brane tension density parameter (Omega_{lambda})\nand that the spatial curvature has a negligible influence on Omega_{lambda}\nestimates. In order to obtain stronger bounds for the contribution of the\n$\\Omega_{\\lambda}$ we also add in our analysis the baryon oscillation peak\n(BAO) and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) observations by using the\nso-called CMB/BAO ratio. From this analysis we find that the Omega_{lambda}\ncontribution is less than 4.10^{-5} (1sigma).\n", "  In this paper we study the creation of super-massive real scalar particles in\nthe framework of a $f(R)=R-\\beta/R^n$ modified gravity theory, with parameters\nconstrained by observational data. The analysis is restrict to a homogeneous\nand isotropic flat and radiation dominated universe. We compare the results to\nthe standard Einstein gravity with cosmological constant ($\\Lambda CDM$ model),\nand we show that the total number density of created particles in the $f(R)$\nmodel is very close to the standard case. Another interesting result is that\nthe spectrum of created particles is $\\beta$ independent at early times.\n", "  The quasi-normal modes for black holes are the resonances for the scattering\nof incoming waves by black holes. Here we consider scattering of massless\nuncharged Dirac fields propagating in the outer region of de\nSitter-Reissner-Nordstr{\\\"o}m black hole, which is spherically symmetric\ncharged exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Using the spherical\nsymmetry of the equation and restricting to a fixed harmonic the problem is\nreduced to a scattering problem for the 1D massless Dirac operator on the line.\nThe resonances for the problem are related to the resonances for a certain\nsemiclassical Schr{\\\"o}dinger operator with exponentially decreasing positive\npotential. We give exact relation between the sets of Dirac and Schr{\\\"o}dinger\nresonances. The asymptotic distribution of the resonances is close to the\nlattice of pseudopoles associated to the non-degenerate maxima of the\npotentials.\n  Using the techniques of quantum Birkhoff normal form we give the complete\nasymptotic formulas for the resonances. In particular, we calculate the first\nthree leading terms in the expansion. Moreover, similar results are obtained\nfor the de Sitter-Schwarzschild quasi-normal modes, thus improving the result\nof S\\'a Barreto and Zworski from 1997.\n", "  The caged compound LaRu2Zn20 exhibits a structural transition at TS =150 K,\nwhose driving mechanism remains elusive. We have investigated atomic dynamics\nby the measurements of specific heat C and inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS).\nThe lattice part of the specific heat Clat divided by T3, Clat/T3, shows a\nbroad peak at around 15 K, which is reproduced by two Einstein modes with\ncharacteristic temperatures of 35 K and 82 K, respectively. IXS measurements\nalong the [111] and [110] directions reveal optical phonon modes at 3 meV (35\nK) and 7 meV (80 K), respectively, whose values agree with the values of\nEinstein temperatures. The first principles calculation has assigned the phonon\nmodes at 3 meV as the optical modes of Zn atoms located at the middle of two La\natoms. The low-energy vibration of the Zn atom perpendicular to the there-fold\naxis is thought to lead the structural instability of LaRu2Zn20.\n", "  The conventional interpretation of the one-loop effective potentials of the\nHiggs field in the Standard Model and the gravitino condensate in dynamically\nbroken supergravity is that these theories are unstable at large field values.\nA PT-symmetric reinterpretation of these models at a quantum-mechanical level\neliminates these instabilities and suggests that these instabilities may also\nbe tamed at the quantum-field-theory level.\n", "  EuRhAl4Si2, crystallizes in tetragonal crystal structure and orders\nantiferromagnetically at ~12 K. The isothermal magnetization along the two\nprinciple directions is highly anisotropic despite Eu2+ being an S-state ion.\nThe variation of entropy change, which is a measure of MCE, with field and\ntemperature, calculated from the isothermal magnetization data taken at various\ntemperatures along the principal crystallographic directions present\ninteresting behavior in EuRhAl4Si2. In the magnetically ordered state the\nentropy change is non-monotonic below spin flip fields; however, in the\nparamagnetic region, it is negative irrespective of the strength of applied\nmagnetic field. For H || [001] the maximum entropy change at 7 T is -21 J/Kg K\naround TN, which is large and comparable to the largest known values in this\ntemperature range. The variation of the MCE with field strongly depends upon\nthe direction of the applied magnetic field. Magnetic phase diagram of\nEuRhAl4Si2 derived from M(H) data is also constructed.\n", "  On-demand creation of entanglement between distant qubits is a necessary\ningredient for distributed quantum computation. We propose an entanglement\nscheme that allows for single-shot deterministic entanglement creation by\ndetecting a single photon passing through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with\none transmon qubit in each arm. The entanglement production essentially relies\non the fact that superconducting microwave structures allow to achieve strong\ncoupling between the qubit and the photon. By detecting the photon via a photon\ncounter, a parity measurement is implemented and the wave function of the two\nqubits is projected onto a maximally entangled state. Most importantly, the\nentanglement generation is heralded such that our protocol is not susceptible\nto photon loss due to the indivisible nature of single photons.\n", "  Dark matter constitutes about $23\\%$ of the total energy density of the\nuniverse but its properties are still little known besides that it should be\ncomposed by cold and weakly interacting particles. Many beyond standard model\ntheories can provide proper candidates to serve as dark matter and the axion\nintroduced to solve the strong CP problem turns out to be an attractive one. In\nthis paper, we briefly review several important features of the axion and the\naxion dark matter.\n", "  We study the Hall conductance of a Chern insulator after a global quench of\nthe Hamiltonian. The Hall conductance in the long time limit is obtained by\napplying the linear response theory to the diagonal ensemble. It is expressed\nas the integral of the Berry curvature weighted by the occupation number over\nthe Brillouin zone. We identify a topologically driven nonequilibrium phase\ntransition, which is indicated by the nonanalyticity of the Hall conductance as\na function of the energy gap m_f in the post-quench Hamiltonian H_f. The\ntopological invariant for the quenched state is the winding number of the\nGreen's function W, which equals the Chern number for the ground state of H_f.\nIn the limit that m_f goes to zero, the derivative of the Hall conductance with\nrespect to m_f is proportional to ln(|m_f|), with the constant of\nproportionality being the ratio of the change of W at m_f = 0 to the energy gap\nin the initial state. This nonanalytic behavior is universal in two-band Chern\ninsulators such as the Dirac model, the Haldane model, or the Kitaev honeycomb\nmodel in the fermionic basis.\n", "  The phenomenon of many-body localization in disordered quantum many-body\nsystems occurs when all transport is suppressed despite the fact that the\nexcitations of the system interact. In this work we report on the numerical\nsimulation of autonomous quantum dynamics for disordered Heisenberg chains when\nthe system is prepared with an initial inhomogeneity in the energy density\nprofile. Using exact diagonalisation and a dynamical code based on Krylov\nsubspaces we are able to simulate dynamics for up to L = 26 spins. We find,\nsurprisingly, the breakdown of energy diffusion even before the many-body\nlocalization transition whilst the system is still in the ergodic phase.\nMoreover, in the ergodic phase we also find a large region in parameter space\nwhere the energy dynamics remains diffusive but where spin transport has been\npreviously evidenced to occur only subdiffusively: this is found to be true for\ninitial states composed of infinitely many hydrodynamic modes (square-wave\nenergy profile) or just the single longest mode (sinusoidal profile). This\nsuggestive finding points towards a peculiar ergodic phase where particles are\ntransported slower than energy, reminiscent of the situation in amorphous\nsolids and of the gapped phase of the anisotropic Heisenberg model.\n", "  The International Trade Network (ITN) is the network formed by trade\nrelationships between world countries. The complex structure of the ITN impacts\nimportant economic processes such as globalization, competitiveness, and the\npropagation of instabilities. Modeling the structure of the ITN in terms of\nsimple macroeconomic quantities is therefore of paramount importance. While\ntraditional macroeconomics has mainly used the Gravity Model to characterize\nthe magnitude of trade volumes, modern network theory has predominantly focused\non modeling the topology of the ITN. Combining these two complementary\napproaches is still an open problem. Here we review these approaches and\nemphasize the double role played by GDP in empirically determining both the\nexistence and the volume of trade linkages. Moreover, we discuss a unified\nmodel that exploits these patterns and uses only the GDP as the relevant\nmacroeconomic factor for reproducing both the topology and the link weights of\nthe ITN.\n", "  Single photon first order interferences of spatially separated regions from\nthe cone structure of spontaneous parametric down conversion allow for\nanalyzing the role of the mode function in quantum optics. In earlier\nexperiments the role of the vacuum fields could be demonstrated in induced\ncoherence experiments as the source of complementarity \\cite{Heu14}. Here the\nspatial coherence properties of these vacuum fields are measured and as the\nphysical reason for complementarity in single photon quantum optics\ndemonstrated.\n", "  We calculate the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the deuteron in the standard\nmodel with $|\\Delta S| =1$ interactions by taking into account the $NN -\n\\Lambda N - \\Sigma N$ channel coupling, which is an important nuclear level\nsystematics. The two-body problem is solved with the Gaussian Expansion Method\nusing the realistic Argonne $v18$ nuclear force and the $YN$ potential which\ncan reproduce the binding energies of $^3_\\Lambda$H, $^3_\\Lambda$He, and\n$^4_\\Lambda$He. The $|\\Delta S| =1$ interbaryon potential is modeled by the\none-meson exchange process. It is found that the deuteron EDM is modified by\nless than 10\\%, and the main contribution to this deviation is due to the\npolarization of the hyperon-nucleon channels. The effect of the $YN$\ninteraction is small, and treating $ \\Lambda N$ and $ \\Sigma N$ channels as\nfree is a good approximation for the EDM of the deuteron.\n", "  A theory is developed for the initial stage of cavitation in the framework of\nZel'dovich-Fisher theory of nucleation in the field of negative pressure, while\ntaking into account the surface tension dependence on the nanopore radius. A\nsaturation mechanism is proposed that limits the exponential dependence of the\nnucleation rate on the energy required to create nanopores. An estimate of the\nsaturated density of nanopores at the nucleation stage is obtained. It is shown\nthat Rayleigh scattering can detect nanopores arising at the initial stage of\ncavitation development.\n", "  Topos quantum theory provides representations of quantum states as direct\ngeneralizations of the probability distribution, namely probability valuation.\nIn this article, we consider extensions of a known bijective correspondence\nbetween quantum states and probability valuations to composite systems and to\nstate transformations. We show that multipartite probability valuations on\ncomposite systems have a bijective correspondence to positive over pure tensor\nstates, according to a candidate definition of the composite systems in topos\nquantum theory. Among the multipartite probability valuations, a special\nattention is placed to Markov chains which are defined by generalizing\nclassical Markov chains from probability theory. We find an incompatibility\nbetween the multipartite probability valuations and a monogamy property of\nquantum states, which trivializes the Markov chains to product probability\nvaluations. Several observations on the transformations of probability\nvaluations are deduced from the results on multipartite probability valuations,\nthrough duality relations between multipartite states and state\ntransformations.\n", "  D. discoideum has been recently suggested as an example of bet-hedging. Upon\nstarvation a population of unicellular amoebae splits between aggregators,\nwhich form a fruiting body made of a stalk and resistant spores, and\nnon-aggregators. Spores are favored by long starvation periods, but vegetative\ncells can exploit resources in fast-recovering environments. This partition can\nbe understood as a bet-hedging strategy that evolves in response to stochastic\nstarvation times. A genotype is defined by a different balance between each\ntype of cells. In this framework, if the ecological conditions are defined in\nterms of the mean starvation time (i.e. time between onset of starvation and\nthe arrival of a new food pulse), a single genotype dominates each environment,\nwhich is inconsistent with the huge genetic diversity observed in nature. We\ninvestigate whether seasonality, represented by a periodic alternation in the\nmean starvation times, allows the coexistence of several strategies. We use a\nnon-spatial (well-mixed) setting where different strains compete for a pulse of\nresources. We find that seasonality, which we model via two seasons, induces a\ntemporal storage effect that can promote the stable coexistence of multiple\ngenotypes. Two conditions need to be met. First, the distributions of\nstarvation times in each season cannot overlap in order to create two well\ndifferentiated habitats within the year. Second, numerous growth-starvation\ncycles have to occur during each season to allow well-adapted strains to grow\nand survive the subsequent unfavorable period. Additional tradeoffs among\nlife-history traits can expand the range of coexistence and increase the number\nof coexisting strategies, contributing towards explaining the genetic diversity\nobserved in D. discoideum\n", "  We present a formulation of Laplace-transformed atomic orbital-based\nsecond-order M{\\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) energies for\ntwo-component Hamiltonians in the Kramers-restricted formalism. This low-order\nscaling technique can be used to enable correlated relativistic calculations\nfor large molecular systems. We show that the working equations to compute the\nrelativistic MP2 energy differ by merely a change of algebra (quaternion\ninstead of real) from their non-relativistic counterparts. With a\nproof-of-principle implementation we study the effect of the nuclear charge on\nthe magnitude of half-transformed integrals and show that for light elements\nspin-free and spin-orbit MP2 energies are almost identical. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the effect of separation of charge distributions on the Coulomb and\nexchange energy con- tributions, which show the same long-range decay with the\ninter-electronic / atomic distance as for non-relativistic MP2. A linearly\nscaling implementation is possible if the proper distance behavior is\nintroduced to the quaternion Schwarz-type estimates as for non-relativistic\nMP2.\n", "  The study of molecular gas is crucial for understanding star formation,\nfeedback, and the broader ecosystem of a galaxy as a whole. However, we have\nlimited understanding of its physics and distribution in all but the nearest\ngalaxies. We present a new technique for studying the composition and\ndistribution of molecular gas in high-redshift galaxies inaccessible to\nexisting methods. Our proposed approach is an extension of carbon monoxide\nintensity mapping methods, which have garnered significant experimental\ninterest in recent years. These intensity mapping surveys target the 115 GHz\n$^{12}$CO (1-0) line, but also contain emission from the substantially fainter\n110 GHz $^{13}$CO (1-0) transition. The method leverages the information\ncontained in the $^{13}$CO line by cross-correlating pairs of frequency\nchannels in an intensity mapping survey. Since $^{13}$CO is emitted from the\nsame medium as the $^{12}$CO, but saturates at a much higher column density,\nthis cross-correlation provides valuable information about both the gas density\ndistribution and isotopologue ratio, inaccessible from the $^{12}$CO alone.\nUsing a simple model of these molecular emission lines, we show that a future\nintensity mapping survey can constrain the abundance ratio of these two species\nand the fraction of emission from optically thick regions to order $\\sim30\\%$.\nThese measurements cannot be made by traditional CO observations, and\nconsequently the proposed method will provide unique insight into the physics\nof star formation, feedback, and galactic ecology at high redshifts.\n", "  Modifications of gravity generated by a multiplicative coupling of a scalar\nfield to the electromagnetic Lagrangian lead to a breaking of Einstein\nequivalence principle (EEPB) as well as to variations of fundamental constants.\nIn these theoretical frameworks, deviations of standard values of the fine\nstructure constant, $\\Delta \\alpha/\\alpha=\\phi$, and of the cosmic distance\nduality relation, $D_L(1+z)^{-2}/D_A=\\eta=1$, where $D_L$ and $D_A$ are the\nluminosity and angular diameter distances, respectively, are unequivocally\nlinked. In this paper, we search for cosmological signatures of the EEPB by\nusing angular diameter distance from galaxy clusters, obtained via their\nSunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) and X-ray observations, and distance modulus of\ntype Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The crucial point here is that we take into\naccount the dependence of the SZE/X-ray technique with $\\phi$ and $\\eta$. Our\nnew results show no indication of the EEPB.\n", "  We consider a multi-group microscopic model for pedestrian flow describing\nthe behaviour of large groups. It is based on an interacting particle system\ncoupled to an eikonal equation. Hydrodynamic multi-group models are derived\nfrom the underlying particle system as well as scalar multi-group models. The\neikonal equation is used to compute optimal paths for the pedestrians. Particle\nmethods are used to solve the equations on all levels of the hierarchy.\nNumerical test cases are investigated and the models and, in particular, the\nresulting evacuation times are compared for a wide range of different\nparameters.\n", "  Bipartite networks are currently regarded as providing a major insight into\nthe organization of many real-world systems, unveiling the mechanisms driving\nthe interactions occurring between distinct groups of nodes. One of the most\nimportant issues encountered when modeling bipartite networks is devising a way\nto obtain a (monopartite) projection on the layer of interest, which preserves\nas much as possible the information encoded into the original bipartite\nstructure. In the present paper we propose an algorithm to obtain\nstatistically-validated projections of bipartite networks, according to which\nany two nodes sharing a statistically-significant number of neighbors are\nlinked. Since assessing the statistical significance of nodes similarity\nrequires a proper statistical benchmark, here we consider a set of four null\nmodels, defined within the exponential random graph framework. Our algorithm\noutputs a matrix of link-specific p-values, from which a validated projection\nis straightforwardly obtainable, upon running a multiple hypothesis testing\nprocedure. Finally, we test our method on an economic network (i.e. the\ncountries-products World Trade Web representation) and a social network (i.e.\nMovieLens, collecting the users' ratings of a list of movies). In both cases\nnon-trivial communities are detected: while projecting the World Trade Web on\nthe countries layer reveals modules of similarly-industrialized nations,\nprojecting it on the products layer allows communities characterized by an\nincreasing level of complexity to be detected; in the second case, projecting\nMovieLens on the films layer allows clusters of movies whose affinity cannot be\nfully accounted for by genre similarity to be individuated.\n", "  We argue that many features of the structure of nuclei emerge from a strictly\nperturbative expansion around the unitarity limit, where the two-nucleon S\nwaves have bound states at zero energy. In this limit, the gross features of\nstates in the nuclear chart are correlated to only one dimensionful parameter,\nwhich is related to the breaking of scale invariance to a discrete scaling\nsymmetry and set by the triton binding energy. Observables are moved to their\nphysical values by small, perturbative corrections, much like in descriptions\nof the fine structure of atomic spectra. We provide evidence in favor of the\nconjecture that light, and possibly heavier, nuclei are bound weakly enough to\nbe insensitive to the details of the interactions but strongly enough to be\ninsensitive to the exact size of the two-nucleon system.\n", "  We introduce a new basis for the gauge-invariant Hilbert space of lattice\ngauge theory and loop quantum gravity in $(2+1)$ dimensions, the fusion basis.\nIn doing so, we shift the focus from the original lattice (or spin-network)\nstructure directly to that of the magnetic (curvature) and electric (torsion)\nexcitations themselves. These excitations are classified by the irreducible\nrepresentations of the Drinfel'd double of the gauge group, and can be readily\n\"fused\" together by studying the tensor product of such representations. We\nwill also describe in detail the ribbon operators that create and measure these\nexcitations and make the quasi-local structure of the observable algebra\nexplicit. Since the fusion basis allows for both magnetic and electric\nexcitations from the onset, it turns out to be a precious tool for studying the\nlarge scale structure and coarse-graining flow of lattice gauge theories and\nloop quantum gravity. This is in neat contrast with the widely used\nspin-network basis, in which it is much more complicated to account for\nelectric excitations, i.e. for Gau\\ss~constraint violations, emerging at larger\nscales. Moreover, since the fusion basis comes equipped with a hierarchical\nstructure, it readily provides the language to design states with sophisticated\nmulti-scale structures. Another way to employ this hierarchical structure is to\nencode a notion of subsystems for lattice gauge theories and $(2+1)$ gravity\ncoupled to point particles. In a follow-up work, we will exploit this notion to\nprovide a new definition of entanglement entropy for these theories.\n", "  The exposure of YBCO to an air atmosphere at first at pH2O = 110 Pa and then\nat pH2O = 1 kPa has been used for uncharacteristic and unusual properties of\nYBCO to be observed. Among them there was an increased reactivity of YBCO with\nrespect to water. Besides, it was experimentally obtained extremely excessive\nweight gain of hydrated YBCO samples that was not corresponding to the quantity\nof the absorbed water. Finally, we obtained the significant negative value of\nthe room-temperature (RT) magnetic susceptibility in conventional magnetic\nstudy of the hydrated YBCO that was confirmed by the direct observation of\ndecreasing weight of the same samples that were suspended above the source of\ncontrolled magnetic field (DC mode) at RT. All the results were explained on\nthe basis of an approximate idea that there is a certain source of attractive\nforce inside YBCO, acting on surrounding particles and bodies.\n", "  This review elaborates pedagogically on the fundamental concept, basic\ntheory, expected properties, and materials realizations of topological\nsuperconductors. The relation between topological superconductivity and\nMajorana fermions are explained, and the difference between dispersive Majorana\nfermions and a localized Majorana zero mode is emphasized. A variety of routes\nto topological superconductivity are explained with an emphasis on the roles of\nspin-orbit coupling. Present experimental situations and possible signatures of\ntopological superconductivity are summarized with an emphasis on intrinsic\ntopological superconductors.\n", "  This article investigates the properties of a few interacting particles\ntrapped in a few wells and how these properties change under adiabatic tuning\nof interaction strength and inter-well tunneling. While some system properties\nare dependent on the specific shapes of the traps and the interactions, this\narticle applies symmetry analysis to identify generic features in the spectrum\nof stationary states of few-particle, few-well systems. Extended attention is\ngiven to a simple but flexible three-parameter model of two particles in two\nwells in one dimension. A key insight is that two limiting cases, hard-core\nrepulsion and no inter-well tunneling, can both be treated as emergent\nsymmetries of the few-particle Hamiltonian. These symmetries are the\nmathematical consequences of infinite barriers in configuration space. They are\nnecessary to explain the pattern of degeneracies in the energy spectrum, to\nunderstand how degeneracies are broken for models away from limiting cases, and\nto explain separability and integrability. These symmetry methods are\nextendable to more complicated models and the results have practical\nconsequences for stable state control in few-particle, few-well systems with\nultracold atoms in optical traps.\n", "  In this work, we extend our previous work on largeness tracing among\nphysicists to other fields, namely mathematics, economics and biomedical\nscience. Overall, the results confirm our previous discovery, indicating that\nscientists in all these fields trace large topics. Surprisingly, however, it\nseems that researchers in mathematics tend to be more likely to trace large\ntopics than those in the other fields. We also find that on average, papers in\ntop journals are less largeness-driven. We compare researchers from the USA,\nGermany, Japan and China and find that Chinese researchers exhibit consistently\nlarger exponents, indicating that in all these fields, Chinese researchers\ntrace large topics more strongly than others. Further correlation analyses\nbetween the degree of largeness tracing and the numbers of authors,\naffiliations and references per paper reveal positive correlations -- papers\nwith more authors, affiliations or references are likely to be more\nlargeness-driven, with several interesting and noteworthy exceptions: in\neconomics, papers with more references are not necessary more largeness-driven,\nand the same is true for papers with more authors in biomedical science. We\nbelieve that these empirical discoveries may be valuable to science\npolicy-makers.\n", "  We in this paper investigate the formation and evolution of primordial black\nholes (PBHs) in nonsingular bouncing cosmologies. We discuss the formation of\nPBH in the contracting phase and calculate the PBH abundance as a function of\nthe sound speed and Hubble parameter. Afterwards, by taking into account the\nsubsequent PBH evolution during the bouncing phase, we derive the density of\nPBHs and their Hawking radiation. Our analysis shows that nonsingular bounce\nmodels can be constrained from the backreaction of PBHs.\n", "  In this review, we summarize the theoretical development on the electric\ndipole moment of light nuclei. We first describe the nucleon level CP violation\nand its parametrization. We then present the results of calculations of the EDM\nof light nuclei in the ab initio approach and in the cluster model. The\nanalysis of the effect of several models beyond standard model is presented,\ntogether with the prospects for its discovery. The advantage of the electric\ndipole moment of light nuclei is focused in the point of view of the many-body\nphysics. The evaluations of the nuclear electric dipole moment generated by the\n$\\theta$-term and by the CP phase of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix are\nalso reviewed.\n", "  Entanglement entropy is a valuable tool for characterizing the correlation\nstructure of quantum field theories. When applied to gauge theories, subtleties\narise which prevent the factorization of the Hilbert space underlying the\nnotion of entanglement entropy. Borrowing techniques from extended topological\nfield theories, we introduce a new definition of entanglement entropy for both\nAbelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Being based on the notion of\nexcitations, it provides a completely relational way of defining regions.\nTherefore, it naturally applies to background independent theories, e.g.\ngravity, by circumventing the difficulty of specifying the position of the\nentangling surface. We relate our construction to earlier proposals and argue\nthat it brings these closer to each other. In particular, it yields the\nnon-Abelian analogue of the \"magnetic centre choice\", as obtained through an\nextended-Hilbert-space method, but applied to the recently introduced fusion\nbasis for 3D lattice gauge theories. We point out that the different\ndefinitions of entanglement theory can be related to a choice of (squeezed)\nvacuum state.\n", "  It is known that unconfined dust explosions typically starts off with a\nrelatively weak primary flame followed by a severe secondary explosion. We show\nthat clustering of dust particles in a temperature stratified turbulent flow\nahead of the primary flame may give rise to a significant increase in the\nradiation penetration length. These particle clusters, even far ahead of the\nflame, are sufficiently exposed and heated by the radiation from the flame to\nbecome ignition kernels capable to ignite a large volume of fuel-air mixtures.\nThis efficiently increases the total flame surface area and the effective\ncombustion speed, defined as the rate of reactant consumption of a given\nvolume. We show that this mechanism explains the high rate of combustion and\noverpressures required to account for the observed level of damage in\nunconfined dust explosions, e.g., at the 2005 Buncefield vapor-cloud explosion.\nThe effect of the strong increase of radiation transparency due to turbulent\nclustering of particles goes beyond the state-of-the-art of the application to\ndust explosions and has many implications in atmospheric physics and\nastrophysics.\n", "  The relic abundance of light millicharged particles (MCPs) with the electric\ncharge $e' = 5\\cdot 10^{-5} e$ and with the mass slightly below or above the\nelectron mass is calculated. The abundance depends on the mass ratio\n$\\eta=m_X/m_e$ and for $\\eta<1$ can be high enough to allow MCPs to be the\ncosmological dark matter or to make a noticeable contribution to it. On the\nother hand, for $\\eta \\gtrsim 1$ the cosmological energy density of MCPs can be\nquite low, $\\Omega_X h_0^2 \\approx 0.02$ for scalar MCPs, and $\\Omega_X h_0^2\n\\approx 0.001$ for spin 1/2 fermions. But even the lowest value of $\\Omega_X\nh_0^2$ is in tension with several existing limits on the MCP abundances and\nparameters. However, these limits have been derived under some natural or\nreasonable assumptions on the properties of MCPs. If these assumptions are\nrelaxed, a patch in the mass-charge plot of MCPs may appear, permitting them to\nbe dark matter particles.\n", "  Entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of freedom drives the formation of\nnovel quantum and topological physical states. Discovering new spin-orbit\nentangled ground states and emergent phases of matter requires both\nexperimentally probing the relevant energy scales and applying suitable\ntheoretical models. Here we report resonant inelastic x-ray scattering\nmeasurements of the transition metal oxides Ca$_3$LiOsO$_6$ and Ba$_2$YOsO$_6$.\nWe invoke an intermediate coupling approach that incorporates both spin-orbit\ncoupling and electron-electron interactions on an even footing and reveal the\nground state of $5d^3$ based compounds, which has remained elusive in\npreviously applied models, is a novel spin-orbit entangled J=3/2 electronic\nground state. This work reveals the hidden diversity of spin-orbit controlled\nground states in 5d systems and introduces a new arena in the search for\nspin-orbit controlled phases of matter.\n", "  Using previously described functional techniques for exact, non-perturbative,\ngauge-invariant renormalized QCD processes, a simplified version of the\namplitudes - in which forms akin to Pomerons naturally appear - provides fits\nto ISR Elastic pp scattering data. Extension of this work to LHC reactions is\npresently underway.\n", "  We present a technique for measuring microwave (MW) field based on Rabi\nresonances induced by the interaction of atoms with a phase-modulated MW field.\nA theoretical model of field measurement is used to calculate Rabi frequency.\nSingle-peak feature of the measurement model makes the technique a valuable\ntool for simple and fast field measurement. As an example, we use the technique\nto determine the MW field strength inside a Cs vapor cell in the X-band\nrectangular cavity for applied power in the range of -21 dBm to 20 dBm. The\nresults show that this proposed technique is capable for detecting the field\nover a broad dynamical range.\n", "  This article summarizes new features and enhancements of the first major\nupdate of Package-X. Package-X 2.0 can now generate analytic expressions for\narbitrarily high rank dimensionally regulated tensor integrals with up to four\ndistinct propagators, each with arbitrary integer weight, near an arbitrary\neven number of spacetime dimensions, giving UV divergent, IR divergent, and\nfinite parts at (almost) any real-valued kinematic point. Additionally, it can\ngenerate multivariable Taylor series expansions of these integrals around any\nnon-singular kinematic point to arbitrary order. All special functions and\nabbreviations output by Package-X 2.0 supports Mathematica's arbitrary\nprecision evaluation capabilities to deal with issues of numerical stability.\nFinally, tensor algebraic routines of Package-X have been polished and extended\nto support open fermion chains both on and off shell. The documentation\n(equivalent to over 100 printed pages) is accessed through Mathematica's\nWolfram Documentation Center and contains information on all Package-X symbols,\nwith over 300 basic usage examples, 3 project-scale tutorials, and instructions\non linking to FeynCalc and LoopTools.\n", "  We propose a six-dimensional regularization of four dimensional chiral gauge\ntheories. We consider a massive Dirac fermion in six dimensions with two\ndifferent operators having domain-wall profiles in the fifth and the sixth\ndirections, respectively. A Weyl fermion appears as a localized mode at the\njunction of the two domain-walls. In our formulation, the Stora-Zumino chain of\nthe anomaly descent equations, starting from the axial $U(1)$ anomaly in\nsix-dimensions to the gauge anomaly in four-dimensions, is naturally embedded.\nMoreover, a similar inflow of the global anomalies is found. The anomaly free\ncondition is equivalent to requiring that the axial $U(1)$ anomaly and the\nparity anomaly are canceled among the six-dimensional Dirac fermions. Putting\nthe gauge field at the four- dimensional junction and extending it to the bulk\nusing the Yang-Mills gradient flow, as recently proposed by Grabowska and\nKaplan, we define the four-dimensional path integral of the target chiral gauge\ntheory.\n", "  We present an overview of the electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties\nof polycrystalline graphene. Most global properties of this material, such as\nthe charge mobility, thermal conductivity, or Young's modulus, are sensitive to\nits microstructure, for instance the grain size and the presence of line or\npoint defects. Both the local and global features of polycrystalline graphene\nhave been investigated by a variety of simulations and experimental\nmeasurements. In this review, we summarize the properties of polycrystalline\ngraphene, and by establishing a perspective on how the microstructure impacts\nits large-scale physical properties, we aim to provide guidance for further\noptimization and improvement of applications based on this material, such as\nflexible and wearable electronics, and high-frequency or spintronic devices.\n", "  We address the question whether quantum probes in a gravitational field can\nbe considered as test particles obeying the weak equivalence principle (WEP). A\nformulation of the WEP is proposed which applies also in the quantum regime,\nwhile maintaining the physical content of its classical counterpart. Such\nformulation requires the introduction of a gravitational field not to modify\nthe Fisher information about the mass of a freely-falling probe, extractable\nthrough measurements of its position. We discover that, while in a uniform\nfield quantum probes satisfy our formulation of the WEP exactly, gravity\ngradients can encode nontrivial information about the particle's mass in its\nwavefunction, leading to violations of the WEP.\n", "  Nowadays, thanks to the improved precision of cosmological data, it has been\npossible to search for deviation from the general relativity theory with tests\non large cosmic scales. Particularly, there is a class of modified gravity\ntheories that breaks the Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) in the\nelectromagnetic sector, generating variations of the fine structure constant,\nviolations of the cosmic distance duality relation and the evolution law of the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. In recent papers, this class of\ntheories has been tested with angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters,\ntype Ia supernovae and CMB temperature.\n  In this work we propose a new test by considering the most recent X-ray\nsurface brightness observations of galaxy clusters jointly with type Ia\nsupernovae and CMB temperature. {The crucial point here is that we take into\naccount the dependence of the X-ray gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters on\npossible variations of the fine structure constant and violations of the cosmic\ndistance duality relation.} Our basic result is that this new approach is\ncompetitive with the previous one and it also does not show significant\ndeviations from the general relativity.\n", "  We numerically analyse the density field of three-dimensional randomly jammed\npackings of monodisperse soft frictionles spherical particles, paying special\nattention to fluctuations occurring at large lengthscales. We study in detail\nthe two-point static structure factor at low wavevectors in Fourier space. We\nalso analyse the nature of the density field in real space by studying the\nlarge-distance behavior of the two-point pair correlation function, of density\nfluctuations in subsystems of increasing sizes, and of the direct correlation\nfunction. We show that such real space analysis can be greatly improved by\nintroducing a coarse-grained density field to disentangle genuine large-scale\ncorrelations from purely local effects. Our results confirm that both Fourier\nand real space signatures of vanishing density fluctuations at large scale are\nabsent, indicating that randomly jammed packings are not hyperuniform. In\naddition, we establish that the pair correlation function displays a\nsurprisingly complex structure at large distances, which is however not\ncompatible with the long-range negative correlation of hyperuniform systems but\nfully compatible with an analytic form for the structure factor. This implies\nthat the direct correlation function is short-ranged, as we also demonstrate\ndirectly. Our results reveal that density fluctuations in jammed packings do\nnot follow the behavior expected for random hyperuniform materials, but display\ninstead a more complex behavior.\n", "  Strongly enhanced and confined electromagnetic fields generated in metal\nnanostructures upon illumination are exploited in many emerging technologies by\neither fabricating sophisticated nanostructures or synthesizing colloid\nnanoparticles. Here we study effects driven by field enhancement in vanishingly\nsmall gaps between gold islands in thin films near the electrically determined\npercolation threshold. Optical explorations using two-photon luminescence (TPL)\nand near-field microscopies reveals super-cubic TPL power dependencies with\nwhite-light spectra, establishing unequivocally that the strongest TPL signals\nare generated with close to the percolation threshold films, and occurrence of\nextremely confined (~ 30 nm)and strongly enhanced (~ 100 times) fields at the\nillumination wavelength. For linearly polarized and sufficiently powerful\nlight, we observe pronounced optical damage with TPL images being sensitive to\nboth wavelength and polarization of illuminating light. We relate these effects\nto thermally induced morphological changes observed with scanning electron\nmicroscopy images. Fascinating physics involved in light interaction with\nnear-percolation metal films along with their straightforward and scalable\none-step fabrication procedure promises a wide range of fascinating\ndevelopments and technological applications within diverse areas of modern\nnanotechnology, from bio-molecule optical sensing to ultra-dense optical data\nstorage.\n", "  The topological Hall effect (THE), as one of the primary manifestations of\nnon-trivial topology of chiral skyrmions, is traditionally used to detect the\nemergence of skyrmion lattices with locally ferromagnetic order. In this work\nwe demonstrate that the appearance of non-trivial two-dimensional chiral\ntextures with locally {\\it anti}-ferromagnetic order can be detected through\nthe spin version of the THE $-$ the topological spin Hall effect (TSHE).\nUtilizing the semiclassical formalism, here used to combine chiral\nantiferromagnetic textures with a density functional theory description of the\ncollinear, degenerate electronic structure, we follow the real-space real-time\nevolution of electronic SU(2) wavepackets in an external electric field to\ndemonstrate the emergence of sizeable transverse pure spin current in synthetic\nantiferromagnets of the Fe/Cu/Fe trilayer type. We further unravel the extreme\nsensitivity of the TSHE to the details of the electronic structure, suggesting\nthat the magnitude and sign of the TSHE in transition-metal synthetic\nantiferromagnets can be engineered by tuning such parameters as the thickness\nor band filling. Besides being an important step in our understanding of the\ntopological properties of ever more complex skyrmionic systems, our results\nbear great potential in stimulating the discovery of antiferromagnetic\nskyrmions.\n", "  In this paper, new bounds on possible variations of the fine structure\nconstant, $\\alpha$, for a class of runaway dilaton models are performed. By\nconsidering a possible evolution with redshift, $z$, such as\n$\\frac{\\Delta\\alpha}{\\alpha}=-\\gamma\\ln(1+z)$, where in $\\gamma$ are the\nphysical properties of the model, we constrain this parameter by using a\ndeformed cosmic distance duality relation jointly with gas mass fraction (GMF)\nmeasurements of galaxy clusters and luminosity distances of type Ia supernovae.\nThe GMF's used in our analyses are from cluster mass data from 82 galaxy\nclusters in the redshift range $0.12<z<1.36$, detected via the\nSunyaev-Zeldovich effect at 148 GHz by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The\ntype Ia supernovae are from the Union2.1 compilation. We also explore the\ndependence of the results from four models used to describe the galaxy\nclusters. As a result no evidence of variation was obtained.\n", "  In this paper, we use the characteristic function, i.e., the Fourier\ntransform of the Glauber-Sudarshan phase-space distribution, to find the degree\nof nonclassicality of a given state. This degree of nonclassicality quantifies\nthe nonclassicality in terms of quantum superpositions. We demonstrate two ways\nto determine or to estimate the degree of nonclassicality by studying the\nproperties of the characteristic functions. The developed criteria are applied\nto two examples of squeezed states undergoing a classical mixing or a\nnonclassical superposition with vacuum.\n", "  The baryon asymmetry, together with a dark matter asymmetry, may be produced\nduring a first order phase transition in a generative sector. We study the\npossibility of a gravitational wave signal in a model realising such a\nscenario. We identify areas of parameter space with strong phase transitions\nwhich can be probed by future, space based, gravitational wave detectors. Other\nsignals of this scenario include collider signatures of a $Z'$, DM self\ninteractions, a contribution to $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ and nuclear recoils at\ndirect detection experiments.\n", "  PT-symmetric quantum mechanics began with a study of the Hamiltonian\n$H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\\varepsilon$. When $\\varepsilon\\geq0$, the eigenvalues of this\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian are discrete, real, and positive. This portion of\nparameter space is known as the region of unbroken PT symmetry. In the region\nof broken PT symmetry $\\varepsilon<0$ only a finite number of eigenvalues are\nreal and the remaining eigenvalues appear as complex-conjugate pairs. The\nregion of unbroken PT symmetry has been studied but the region of broken PT\nsymmetry has thus far been unexplored. This paper presents a detailed numerical\nand analytical examination of the behavior of the eigenvalues for\n$-4<\\varepsilon<0$. In particular, it reports the discovery of an\ninfinite-order exceptional point at $\\varepsilon=-1$, a transition from a\ndiscrete spectrum to a partially continuous spectrum at $\\varepsilon=-2$, a\ntransition at the Coulomb value $\\varepsilon=-3$, and the behavior of the\neigenvalues as $\\varepsilon$ approaches the conformal limit $\\varepsilon=-4$.\n", "  We consider time-dependent solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations using\nanti-de Sitter (AdS) boundary conditions, and provide the first counterexample\nto the weak cosmic censorship conjecture in four spacetime dimensions. Our\ncounterexample is entirely formulated in the Poincar\\'e patch of AdS. We claim\nthat our results have important consequences for quantum gravity, most notably\nto the weak gravity conjecture.\n", "  High-throughput computational screening has emerged as a critical component\nof materials discovery. Direct density functional theory (DFT) simulation of\ninorganic materials and molecular transition metal complexes is often used to\ndescribe subtle trends in inorganic bonding and spin-state ordering, but these\ncalculations are computationally costly and properties are sensitive to the\nexchange-correlation functional employed. To begin to overcome these\nchallenges, we trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict\nquantum-mechanically-derived properties, including spin-state ordering,\nsensitivity to Hartree-Fock exchange, and spin- state specific bond lengths in\ntransition metal complexes. Our ANN is trained on a small set of\ninorganic-chemistry-appropriate empirical inputs that are both maximally\ntransferable and do not require precise three-dimensional structural\ninformation for prediction. Using these descriptors, our ANN predicts\nspin-state splittings of single-site transition metal complexes (i.e., Cr-Ni)\nat arbitrary amounts of Hartree-Fock exchange to within 3 kcal/mol accuracy of\nDFT calculations. Our exchange-sensitivity ANN enables improved predictions on\na diverse test set of experimentally-characterized transition metal complexes\nby extrapolation from semi-local DFT to hybrid DFT. The ANN also outperforms\nother machine learning models (i.e., support vector regression and kernel ridge\nregression), demonstrating particularly improved performance in\ntransferability, as measured by prediction errors on the diverse test set. We\nestablish the value of new uncertainty quantification tools to estimate ANN\nprediction uncertainty in computational chemistry, and we provide additional\nheuristics for identification of when a compound of interest is likely to be\npoorly predicted by the ANN.\n", "  We analytically derive, in the context of the replica formalism, the first\nfinite size corrections to the average optimal cost in the random assignment\nproblem for a quite generic distribution law for the costs. We show that, when\nmoving from a power-law distribution to a $\\Gamma$ distribution, the leading\ncorrection changes both in sign and in its scaling properties. We also examine\nthe behavior of the corrections when approaching a $\\delta$-function\ndistribution. By using a numerical solution of the saddle-point equations, we\nprovide predictions that are confirmed by numerical simulations.\n", "  Thousands of tons of isotopic mixtures are processed annually for heavy-water\nproduction and tritium decontamination. The existing technologies remain\nextremely energy intensive and require large capital investments. New\napproaches are needed to reduce the industry's footprint. Recently, micron-size\ncrystals of graphene were shown to act as efficient sieves for hydrogen\nisotopes pumped through graphene electrochemically. Here we report a\nfully-scalable approach, using graphene obtained by chemical vapor deposition,\nwhich allows a proton-deuteron separation factor of ca. 8, despite cracks and\nimperfections. The energy consumption is projected to be orders of magnitude\nsmaller with respect to existing technologies. A membrane based on 30 m2 of\ngraphene, a readily accessible amount, could provide a heavy-water output\ncomparable to that of modern plants. Even higher efficiency is expected for\ntritium separation. With no fundamental obstacles for scaling up, the\ntechnology's simplicity, efficiency and green credentials call for\nconsideration by the nuclear and related industries.\n", "  We explore whether quantum gravity effects within the asymptotic safety\nparadigm can provide a predictive ultraviolet completion for Abelian gauge\ntheories. We evaluate the effect of quantum gravity fluctuations on the running\ncouplings in the gauge sector and discover an asymptotically safe fixed point\nof the Renormalization Group. In particular, if the strength of gravitational\ninteractions remains below a critical strength, the minimal gauge coupling\nbecomes asymptotically free. Further, we point out that a completely\nasymptotically free dynamics for the gauge field is impossible to achieve, as\nasymptotically safe quantum gravity necessarily induces nonvanishing\nhigher-order interactions for the gauge field in the ultraviolet.\n", "  Photons propagating in Laguerre-Gaussian modes have characteristic orbital\nangular momentums, which are fundamental optical degrees of freedom. The\norbital angular momentum of light has potential application in high capacity\noptical communication and even in quantum information processing. In this work,\nwe experimentally construct a ring cavity with 4 lenses and 4 mirrors that is\ncompletely degenerate for Laguerre-Gaussian modes. By measuring the\ntransmission peaks and patterns of different modes, the ring cavity is shown to\nsupporting more than 31 Laguerre-Gaussian modes. The constructed degenerate\ncavity opens a new way for using the unlimited resource of available angular\nmomentum states simultaneously.\n", "  In this paper, we explore various forms of osmotic transport in the regime of\nhigh solute concentration. We consider both the osmosis across membranes and\ndiffusio-osmosis at solid interfaces, driven by solute concentration gradients.\nWe follow a mechanical point of view of osmotic transport, which allows us to\ngain much insight into the local mechanical balance underlying osmosis. We\ndemonstrate in particular how the general expression of the osmotic pressure\nfor mixtures, as obtained classically from the thermodynamic framework, emerges\nfrom the mechanical balance controlling non-equilibrium transport under solute\ngradients. Expressions for the rejection coefficient of osmosis and the\ndiffusio-osmotic mobilities are accordingly obtained. These results generalize\nexisting ones in the dilute solute regime to mixtures with arbitrary\nconcentrations.\n", "  In this paper, we explore osmotic transport by means of molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations. We first consider osmosis through a membrane, and investigate\nthe reflection coefficient of an imperfectly semi-permeable membrane, in the\ndilute and high concentration regimes. We then explore the diffusion-osmotic\nflow of a solute-solvent fluid adjacent to a solid surface, driven by a\nchemical potential gradient parallel to the surface. We propose a novel\nnon-equilibrium MD (NEMD) methodology to simulate diffusion-osmosis, by\nimposing an external force on every particle, which properly mimics the\nchemical potential gradient on the solute in spite of the periodic boundary\nconditions. This NEMD method is validated theoretically on the basis of\nlinear-response theory by matching the mobility with their Green-Kubo\nexpressions. Finally, we apply the framework to more realistic systems, namely\na water-ethanol mixture in contact with a silica or a graphene surface.\n", "  The quantum transport of electrons in a wire of localized dots by hopping,\ninteraction and dissipation is calculated and a representation by an equivalent\nRCL circuit is found. The exact solution for the electric-field induced\ncurrents allows to discuss the role of virtual currents to decay initial\ncorrelations and Bloch oscillations. The dynamical response function in random\nphase approximation (RPA) is calculated analytically with the help of which the\nstatic structure function and pair correlation function are determined. The\npair correlation function contains a form factor from the Brillouin zone and a\nstructure factor caused by the localized dots in the wire.\n", "  We consider an instance of black-box quantum metrology in the Gaussian\nframework, where we aim to estimate the amount of squeezing applied on an input\nprobe, without previous knowledge on the phase of the applied squeezing. By\ntaking the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as the figure of merit, we evaluate\nits average and variance with respect to this phase in order to identify probe\nstates that yield good precision for many different squeezing directions. We\nfirst consider the case of single-mode Gaussian probes with the same energy,\nand find that pure squeezed states maximize the average quantum Fisher\ninformation (AvQFI) at the cost of a performance that oscillates strongly as\nthe squeezing direction is changed. Although the variance can be brought to\nzero by correlating the probing system with a reference mode, the maximum AvQFI\ncannot be increased in the same way. A different scenario opens if one takes\ninto account the effects of photon losses: coherent states represent the\noptimal single-mode choice when losses exceed a certain threshold and,\nmoreover, correlated probes can now yield larger AvQFI values than all\nsingle-mode states, on top of having zero variance.\n", "  The propagation of waves in the nonlinear acoustic metamaterials (NAMs) is\nfundamentally different from that in the conventional linear ones. In this\narticle we consider two one-dimensional NAM systems featuring respectively a\ndiatomic and a tetratomic meta unit-cell. We investigate the attenuation of the\nwave, the band structure and the bifurcations to demonstrate novel nonlinear\neffects, which can significantly expand the bandwidth for elastic wave\nsuppression and cause nonlinear wave phenomena. Harmonic averaging approach,\ncontinuation algorithm, Lyapunov exponents are combined to study the frequency\nresponses, the nonlinear modes, bifurcations of periodic solutions and chaos.\nThe nonlinear resonances are studied and the influence of damping on\nhyper-chaotic attractors is evaluated. Moreover, a \"quantum\" behavior is found\nbetween the low-energy and high-energy orbits. This work provides an important\ntheoretical base for the further understandings and applications of NAMs.\n", "  We experimentally realize higher-order catastrophic structures in light\nfields to access the rich class of caustic swallowtail and butterfly beams.\nThese beams present solutions of paraxial diffraction catastrophe integrals\nthat are determined by potential functions, whose singular mapping manifests as\ncaustic hypersurfaces in control parameter space. We systematically analyze the\nswallowtail and butterfly beams' caustics analytically and observe their field\ndistributions experimentally in real and Fourier space. Their spectra can be\ndescribed by polynomials or expressions with rational exponents capable to form\na cusp.\n", "  Thermoelectric energy conversion - the exploitation of the Seebeck effect to\nconvert waste heat into electricity - has attracted an increasing amount of\nresearch attention for energy harvesting technology. Niobium-doped strontium\ntitanate (SrTi1-xNbxO3) is one of the most promising thermoelectric material\ncandidates, particularly as it poses a much lesser environmental risk in\ncomparison to materials based on heavy metal elements. Two-dimensional electron\nconfinement, e.g. through the formation of superlattices or two-dimensional\nelectron gases, is recognized as an effective strategy to improve the\nthermoelectric performance of SrTi1-xNbxO3. Although electron confinement is\nclosely related to the electronic structure, the fundamental electronic phase\nbehavior of the SrTi1-xNbxO3 solid solution system has yet to be\ncomprehensively investigated. Here, we present a thermoelectric phase diagram\nfor the SrTi1-xNbxO3 (0.05 =< x =< 1) solid solution system, which we derived\nfrom the characterization of epitaxial films. We observed two thermoelectric\nphase boundaries in the system, which originate from the step-like decrease in\ncarrier effective mass at x ~ 0.3, and from a local minimum in carrier\nrelaxation time at x ~ 0.5. The origins of these phase boundaries are\nconsidered to be related to isovalent/heterovalent B-site substitution:\nparabolic Ti 3d orbitals dominate electron conduction for compositions with x <\n0.3, whereas the Nb 4d orbital dominates when x > 0.3. At x ~ 0.5, a tetragonal\ndistortion of the lattice, in which the B-site is composed of Ti4+ and Nb4+\nions, leads to the formation of tail-like impurity bands, which maximizes the\nelectron scattering. These results provide a foundation for further research\ninto improving the thermoelectric performance of SrTi1-xNbxO3.\n", "  Silicon carbide (SiC) grains are a major dust component in carbon-rich AGB\nstars. The formation pathways of these grains are, however, not fully\nunderstood.\\ We calculate ground states and energetically low-lying structures\nof (SiC)$_n$, $n=1,16$ clusters by means of simulated annealing (SA) and Monte\nCarlo simulations of seed structures and subsequent quantum-mechanical\ncalculations on the density functional level of theory. We derive the infrared\n(IR) spectra of these clusters and compare the IR signatures to observational\nand laboratory data.\\ According to energetic considerations, we evaluate the\nviability of SiC cluster growth at several densities and temperatures,\ncharacterising various locations and evolutionary states in circumstellar\nenvelopes.\\ We discover new, energetically low-lying structures for\nSi$_{4}$C$_{4}$, Si$_{5}$C$_{5}$, Si$_{15}$C$_{15}$ and Si$_{16}$C$_{16}$, and\nnew ground states for Si$_{10}$C$_{10}$ and Si$_{15}$C$_{15}$. The clusters\nwith carbon-segregated substructures tend to be more stable by 4-9 eV than\ntheir bulk-like isomers with alternating Si-C bonds. However, we find ground\nstates with cage (\"bucky\"-like) geometries for Si$_{12}$C$_{12}$ and\nSi$_{16}$C$_{16}$ and low-lying, stable cage structures for n $\\ge$ 12. The\nlatter findings indicate thus a regime of clusters sizes that differs from\nsmall clusters as well as from large-scale crystals. Thus, and owing to their\nstability and geometry, the latter clusters may mark a transition from a\nquantum-confined cluster regime to crystalline, solid bulk-material.\n  The calculated vibrational IR spectra of the ground-state SiC clusters shows\nsignificant emission. They include the 10-13 $\\mu$m wavelength range and the\n11.3 $\\mu$m feature inferred from laboratory measurements and observations,\nrespectively, though the overall intensities are rather low.\n", "  In this paper, we study anisotropic universe using Noether symmetries in\nmodified gravity. In particular, we choose locally rotationally symmetric\nBianchi type-$I$ universe for the analysis in $f(R,\\mathcal{G})$ gravity, where\n$R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\\mathcal{G}$ is the Gauss-Bonnet invariant.\nFirstly, a model $f(R,\\mathcal{G})=f_0R^l+f_1\\mathcal{G}^n$ is proposed and the\ncorresponding Noether symmetries are investigated. Further, we have also\nrecovered the Noether symmetries for $f(R)$ and $f(\\mathcal{G})$ theories of\ngravity. Secondly, some important cosmological solutions are reconstructed.\nExponential and power law solutions are reported for a well-known\n$f(R,\\mathcal{G})$ model, i.e., $f(R,\\mathcal{G})=f_0R^n\\mathcal{G}^{1-n}$.\nEspecially, the Kasner's solution is recovered and it is anticipated that the\nfamiliar de-Sitter spacetime giving $\\Lambda CDM$ cosmology may be\nreconstructed for some suitable value of $n$.\n", "  We introduce an almost analytical method to simulate 2D electronic spectra as\na double Fourier transform of the the non-linear response function (NRF)\ncorresponding to a particular optical pulse sequence. We employ a unitary\ntransformation to represent the total system Hamiltonian in a stationary basis\nthat allows us to separate contributions from decoherence and phonon-mediated\npopulation relaxation to the NRF. Previously, one of us demonstrated the use of\nan analytic, cumulant expansion approach to calculate the decoherence term.\nHere, we extend this idea to obtain an accurate expression for the population\nrelaxation term, a significant improvement over standard quantum master\nequation-based approximations. We numerically demonstrate the accuracy of our\nmethod by computing the photon echo spectrum of a two-level system coupled to a\nthermal bath, and we highlight the mechanistic insights obtained from our\nsimulation.\n", "  PSR B1820$-$30A is located in the globular cluster NGC 6624 and is the\nclosest known pulsar to the centre of any globular cluster. We present more\nthan 25 years of high-precision timing observations of this millisecond pulsar\nand obtain four rotational frequency time derivative measurements. Modelling\nthese higher-order derivatives as being due to orbital motion, we find\nsolutions which indicate that the pulsar is in either a low-eccentricity\n($0.33\\lesssim e\\lesssim0.4$) smaller orbit with a low mass companion (such as\na main sequence star, white dwarf, neutron star, or stellar mass black hole) or\na high-eccentricity ($e\\gtrsim0.9$) larger orbit with a massive companion. The\ncluster mass properties and the observed properties of 4U 1820$-$30 and the\nother pulsars in the cluster argue against the low-eccentricity possibility.\nThe high-eccentricity solution reveals that the pulsar is most likely orbiting\naround an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of mass $> 7,500$~M$_\\odot$\nlocated at the cluster centre. A gravitational model for the globular cluster,\nwhich includes such a central black hole (BH), predicts an acceleration that is\ncommensurate with that measured for the pulsar. It further predicts that the\nmodel-dependent minimum mass of the IMBH is $\\sim60,000$~M$_\\odot$. Accounting\nfor the associated contribution to the observed period derivative indicates\nthat the $\\gamma$-ray efficiency of the pulsar should be between 0.08 and 0.2.\nOur results suggest that other globular clusters may also contain central black\nholes and they may be revealed by the study of new pulsars found sufficiently\nclose to their centres.\n  Note that we found an erratum in Section 5 and thus, the\n$\\sim$60,000~M$_\\odot$ mass mentioned above has to be replaced by the correct\nmodel-dependent mass limit of $\\sim$20,000~M$_\\odot$. See the erratum appended.\n", "  The relativistic quantum dynamics of scalar bosons in the background of a\nfull vector coupling (minimal plus nonminimal vector couplings) is explored in\nthe context of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau formalism. The Coulomb phase shift is\ndetermined for a general mixing of couplings and it is shown that the space\ncomponent of the nonminimal coupling is a {\\it sine qua non} condition for the\nexact closed-form scattering amplitude. It follows that the Rutherford cross\nsection vanishes in the absence of the time component of the minimal coupling.\nBound-state solutions obtained from the poles of the partial scattering\namplitude show that the time component of the minimal coupling plays an\nessential role. The bound-state solutions depend on the nonminimal coupling and\nthe spectrum consists of particles or antiparticles depending on the sign of\nthe time component of the minimal coupling without chance for pair production\neven in the presence of strong couplings. It is also shown that an accidental\ndegeneracy appears for a particular mixing of couplings.\n", "  The value of the parton to hadron fragmentation function in QCD in vacuum\n(for example from proton-proton collisions at high energy colliders) is\ndirectly/indirectly used in the literature to study the jet quenching and the\nhadron production from quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC. In this paper we\nshow that this is not possible because, unlike the perturbative propagator in\nnon-equilibrium QCD, the parton to hadron fragmentation function is a\nnon-perturbative quantity in QCD and hence it is not possible to decompose the\nfragmentation function in non-equilibrium QCD into the vacuum part and the\nmedium part.\n", "  Switching magnetization in a perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ)\nvia voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) has shown the potential to\nmarkedly reduce the switching energy. However, the requirement of an external\nmagnetic field poses a critical bottleneck for its practical applications. In\nthis work, we propose an elliptical-shaped pMTJ to eliminate the requirement of\nproviding an external field by an additional circuit. We demonstrate that a 10\nnm thick in-plane magnetized bias layer (BL) separated by a metallic spacer of\n3 nm from the free layer (FL) can be engineered within the MTJ stack to provide\nthe 50 mT bias magnetic field for switching. By conducting macrospin\nsimulation, we find that a fast switching in 0.38 ns with energy consumption as\nlow as 0.3 fJ at a voltage of 1.6 V can be achieved. Furthermore, we study the\nphase diagram of switching probability, showing that a pulse duration margin of\n0.15 ns is obtained and a low-voltage operation (~ 1 V) is favored. Finally,\nthe MTJ scalability is considered, and it is found that scaling-down may not be\nappealing in terms of both the energy consumption and the switching time for\nthe precession based VCMA switching.\n", "  Using Relativistic Quantum Geometry (RQG), we study the emergence of\nback-reaction modes with solitonic properties, on astrophysical and\ncosmological scales, in a model of pre-inflation where the universe emerge from\na topological phase transition. We found that, modes of the geometrical field\nthat describes back-reaction effects related to larger scales (cosmological\nscales), are more coherent than those related to astrophysical scales, so that\nthey can be considered a coarse-grained soliton.\n", "  We generalize the Thomas-Fermi approach to galaxy structure to include\nself-consistently and non-linearly central supermassive black holes. This\napproach naturally incorporates the quantum pressure of the warm dark matter\n(WDM) particles and shows its full powerful and clearness in the presence of\nsupermassive black holes (SPMHs). We find the main galaxy and central black\nhole magnitudes: halo radius r_h , halo mass M_h, black hole mass M_BH,\nvelocity dispersion, phase space density, with their realistic astrophysical\nvalues, masses and sizes over a wide galaxy range. The SMBH masses arise\nnaturally in this framework. Our extensive numerical calculations and detailed\nanalytic resolution show that with SMBH's, both WDM regimes: classical\n(Boltzmann dilute) and quantum (compact) do necessarily co-exist in any galaxy:\nfrom the smaller and compact galaxies to the largest ones. The transition from\nthe quantum to the classical region occurs precisely at the same point r_A\nwhere the chemical potential vanishes. A novel halo structure with three\nregions shows up: A small quantum compact core of radius r_A around the SMBH,\nfollowed by a less compact region till the BH influence radius r_i, and then\nfor r> r_i the known halo galaxy shows up with its astrophysical size. Three\nrepresentative families of galaxy plus central SMBH solutions are found and\nanalyzed:small, medium and large galaxies having SMBH masses of 10^5, 10^7 and\n10^9 M_sun respectively. A minimum galaxy size and mass ~ 10^7 M_sun larger\nthan the one without SMBH is found. Small galaxies in the range 10^4 M_sun <\nM_h < 10^7 M_sun cannot harbor central SMBHs. We find novel scaling M_BH - r_h\n- M_h relations. The galaxy equation of state is derived: The pressure P(r)\ntakes huge values in the SMBH vecinity and then sharply decreases entering the\nclassical region following a local perfect gas behaviour.(Abridged)\n", "  We Propose A Novel Automaton Model which uses Arithmetic Operations as the\nEvolving Rules, each cell has the states of the Natural Numbers k = (N), a\nradius of r = 1/2 and operates on an arbitrary input size. The Automaton reads\nan Arithmetic Expression as an input and outputs another Arithmetic Expression.\nIn Addition, we simulate a variety of One Dimensional Cellular Automata\nStructures with different Dynamics including Elementary Cellular Automata.\n", "  We propose a number of apparently equivalent criteria necessary for the\nconsistency of a 5d SCFT in its Coulomb phase and use these criteria to\nclassify 5d SCFTs arising from a gauge theory with simple gauge group. These\ncriteria include the convergence of the 5-sphere partition function; the\npositivity of particle masses and monopole string tensions; and the positive\ndefiniteness of the metric in some region in the Coulomb branch. We find that\nfor large rank classical groups simple classes of SCFTs emerge where the bounds\non the matter content and the Chern-Simons level grow linearly with rank. For\nclassical groups of rank less than or equal to 8, our classification leads to\nadditional cases which do not fit in the large rank analysis. We also classify\nthe allowed matter content for all exceptional groups.\n", "  The orbit and physical parameters of the previously unsolved double-lined\neclipsing binary Tyc 5227-1023-1, discovered during the search for RR Lyr\nvariables candidate members of the Aquarius stream, are derived using high\nresolution \\'echelle spectroscopy and $V$, $i^\\prime$ photometry. Synthetic\nspectral analysis of both components has been performed, yielding metallicity\n[M/H] = $-0.63 \\pm 0.11$ for both stars and the temperature of the secondary\nwhich is in close agreement with the one from the orbital solution, while the\ntemperature of the primary is determined from photometry (T$_1 = 6350$ K). The\nmasses and radii ($M_1 = 0.96 \\pm 0.02, M_2 = 0.84 \\pm 0.01$ M$_{\\odot}$, $R_1\n= 1.39 \\pm 0.01, R_2 = 0.98 \\pm 0.01$ R$_{\\odot}$) reveal that both stars have\nalready slightly evolved away from the Main Sequence band having an age of\nabout $7$ Gyr, and the results of synthetic spectral analysis support the claim\nof co-rotation with the orbital motion. The radial velocity of the system is\n$-60 \\pm 2$ km sec$^{-1}$ while its distance, computed from orbital parameters\nand the derived reddening $E_{B-V}$ = 0.053, is $496 \\pm 35$ pc. Even though\nTyc 5227-1023-1 was initially treated as a possible member of the Aquarius\nstream, the results presented here disagree with reported values for this\nancient structure, and suggest a likely membership of the thick disk.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate a strong dependence of the annihilation rate\nbetween (singlet) excitons on the sign of dipole-dipole couplings between\nmolecules. For molecular H-aggregates, where this sign is positive, the phase\nrelation of the delocalized two-exciton wavefunctions causes a destructive\ninterference in the annihilation probability. For J-aggregates, where this sign\nis negative, the interference is constructive instead, as a result of which no\nsuch coherent suppression of the annihilation rate occurs. As a consequence,\nroom temperature annihilation rates of typical H- and J-aggregates differ by a\nfactor of ~3, while an order of magnitude difference is found for\nlow-temperature aggregates with a low degree of disorder. These findings, which\nexplain experimental observations, reveal a fundamental principle underlying\nexciton-exciton annihilation, with major implications for technological devices\nand experimental studies involving high excitation densities.\n", "  Genus two partition functions of 2d chiral conformal field theories are given\nby Siegel modular forms. We compute their conformal blocks and use them to\nperform the conformal bootstrap. The advantage of this approach is that it\nimposes crossing symmetry of an infinite family of four point functions and\nalso modular invariance at the same time. Since for a fixed central charge the\nring of Siegel modular forms is finite dimensional, we can perform this\nanalytically. In this way we derive bounds on three point functions and on the\nspectrum of such theories.\n", "  We study the evolution of long-lived controversial debates as manifested on\nTwitter from 2011 to 2016. Specifically, we explore how the structure of\ninteractions and content of discussion varies with the level of collective\nattention, as evidenced by the number of users discussing a topic. Spikes in\nthe volume of users typically correspond to external events that increase the\npublic attention on the topic -- as, for instance, discussions about `gun\ncontrol' often erupt after a mass shooting.\n  This work is the first to study the dynamic evolution of polarized online\ndebates at such scale. By employing a wide array of network and content\nanalysis measures, we find consistent evidence that increased collective\nattention is associated with increased network polarization and network\nconcentration within each side of the debate; and overall more uniform lexicon\nusage across all users.\n", "  In studies of neutrino electromagnetic properties we discuss three very\ninteresting aspects related to neutrino spin oscillations. First we consider\nneutrino mixing and oscillations in the mass and flavour bases under the\ninfluence of a constant magnetic field with nonzero transversal and\nlongitudinal components. Then we discuss the effect of neutrino spin\noscillations induced by electroweak interactions of neutrino with moving matter\nin case there is matter transversal current or polarization. In the final part\nof the paper we discuss recently developed approach to description of neutrino\nspin and spin-flavour oscillations in a constant magnetic field that is based\non the use of the exact neutrino stationary states in the magnetic field.\n", "  This article consists of two parts. In Part 1, we present a formulation of\ntwo-dimensional topological quantum field theories in terms of a functor from a\ncategory of Ribbon graphs to the endofuntor category of a monoidal category.\nThe key point is that the category of ribbon graphs produces all Frobenius\nobjects. Necessary backgrounds from Frobenius algebras, topological quantum\nfield theories, and cohomological field theories are reviewed. A result on\nFrobenius algebra twisted topological recursion is included at the end of Part\n1.\n  In Part 2, we explain a geometric theory of quantum curves. The focus is\nplaced on the process of quantization as a passage from families of Hitchin\nspectral curves to families of opers. To make the presentation simpler, we\nunfold the story using SL_2(\\mathbb{C})-opers and rank 2 Higgs bundles defined\non a compact Riemann surface $C$ of genus greater than $1$. In this case,\nquantum curves, opers, and projective structures in $C$ all become the same\nnotion. Background materials on projective coordinate systems, Higgs bundles,\nopers, and non-Abelian Hodge correspondence are explained.\n", "  We have undertaken an algorithmic search for new integrable\nsemi-discretizations of physically relevant nonlinear partial differential\nequations. The search is performed by using a compatibility condition for the\ndiscrete Lax operators and symbolic computations. We have discovered a new\nintegrable system of coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations which combines\nelements of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice and the triangular-lattice ribbon\nstudied by Vakhnenko. We show that the continuum limit of the new integrable\nsystem is given by uncoupled complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equations and\nuncoupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations.\n", "  We summarize the current status of the determination of the CKM matrix\nelements |V_ud| and |V_us|, which is at the precision frontier of CKM\nphenomenology. We also review recent progress on the study of charm\n(semi)leptonic decays, and the determination of |V_cd| and |V_cs|.\n", "  The black hole binary V404 Cygni (= GS 2023+338) had an outburst on June 15,\n2015 after 26 years of quiescence. We report the multi-color optical\nobservation (g', Rc, and Ic) of this object at the beginning of its outburst\nperformed by the MITSuME 50cm telescope in Akeno, Yamanashi, and the\nMURIKABUSHI 105 cm Telescope at Ishigakijima Astronomical Observatory. With\ntime domain analysis of the multi-color light curves, we successfully\ndecomposed optical variations into two components: a highly-variable, and a\nlittle-variable component. The loci of the little-variable component in the\ncolor-color diagram are consistent with that of the multi-temperature blackbody\nradiation, while those of the highly-variable component trace out a power-law\nspectrum with a spectral index {\\alpha}~0.6-1.0. For the little-variable\ncomponent, we argue that an irradiated disk with the innermost temperature\nhigher than ~2.0$\\times10^4$ K and the outermost temperature lower than\n~6.5$\\times10^3$ K is the most plausible source. The gradual rise trend of the\nlight curve during our observation is probably due to the growing of the\nlittle-variable component. The observed spectral energy distribution (SED) from\nthe optical to ultraviolet can be expressed by a model consisting of a\npower-law component and an irradiated disk component.\n", "  An array of eight CsI(Tl) detectors has been set up to measure the light\ncharged particles in nuclear reactions using heavy ions from the Pelletron\nLinac Facility, Mumbai. The energy response of CsI(Tl) detector to\n$\\alpha$-particles from 5 to 40 MeV is measured using radioactive sources and\nthe $^{12}$C($^{12}$C, $\\alpha$) reaction populating discrete states in\n$^{20}$Ne. The energy non-linearity and the count rate effect on the pulse\nshape discrimination property have also been measured and observed the\ndeterioration of pulse shape discrimination with higher count rate.\n", "  We investigate the ground state and finite-temperature properties of the\nspin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on an infinite octa-kagome lattice by\nutilizing state-of-the-art tensor network-based numerical methods. It is shown\nthat the ground state has a vanishing local magnetization and possesses a\n$1/2$-magnetization plateau with up-down-up-up spin configuration. A quantum\nphase transition at the critical coupling ratio $J_{d}/J_{t}=0.6$ is found.\nWhen $0<J_{d}/J_{t}<0.6$, the system is in a valence bond state, where an\nobvious zero-magnetization plateau is observed, implying a gapful spin\nexcitation; when $J_{d}/J_{t}>0.6$, the system exhibits a gapless excitation,\nin which the dimer-dimer correlation is found decaying in a power law, while\nthe spin-spin and chiral-chiral correlation functions decay exponentially. At\nthe isotropic point ($J_{d}/J_{t}=1$), we unveil that at low temperature ($T$)\nthe specific heat depends linearly on $T$, and the susceptibility tends to a\nconstant for $T\\rightarrow 0$, giving rise to a Wilson ratio around unity,\nimplying that the system under interest is a fermionic algebraic quantum spin\nliquid.\n", "  Using two crystals for spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a parallel\nsetup, we observe two-photon interference with high visibility. The high\nvisibility is consistent with complementarity and the absence of which-path\ninformation. The observations are explained as effects of entanglement or\nequivalently in terms of interfering probability amplitudes, and also by the\ncalculation of a second-order field correlation function in the Heisenberg\npicture. The latter approach brings out explicitly the role of the vacuum\nfields in the down-conversion at the crystals and in the photon coincidence\ncounting. For comparison we show that the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip can be explained\nby the same approach in which the role of the vacuum signal and idler fields,\nas opposed to entanglement involving vacuum states, is emphasized.\n", "  We investigate a highly-nonlocal generalization of the Lindhard function,\ngiven by the jellium-with-gap model. We find a band-gap-dependent gradient\nexpansion of the kinetic energy, which performs noticeably well for large\natoms. Using the static linear response theory and the simplest semilocal model\nfor the local band gap, we derive a non-empirical generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA) of the kinetic energy. This GGA kinetic energy functional\nis remarkably accurate for the description of weakly interacting molecular\nsystems within the subsystem formulation of Density Functional Theory.\n", "  Bulk boundary correspondence is crucial to topological insulator as it\nassociates the boundary states (with zero energy, chiral or helical) to\ntopological numbers defined in bulk. The application of this correspondence\nneeds a prerequisite condition which is usually not mentioned explicitly: the\nboundaries themselves cannot alter the bulk states, so as to the topological\nnumbers defined on them. In non-hermitian models with fractional winding\nnumber, we prove that such precondition fails and the bulk boundary\ncorrespondence is cut out. We show that, as eliminating the hopping between the\nboundaries to simulate the evolution of a system from the periodic boundary\ncondition to the open boundary condition, exceptional points must be passed\nthrough and the topological structure of the spectrum has been changed. This\nmakes the topological structures of a chain with open boundary totally\ndifferent from that without the boundary. We also argue that such exotic\nbehavior does not emerge when the open boundary is replaced by a domain-wall.\nSo the index theorem can be applied to the systems with domain-walls but cannot\nbe further used to those with open boundary.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to give a short review of recent results of the\nauthors concerning classical Hamiltonian many particle systems. We hope that\nthese results support the new possible formulation of Boltzmann's ergodicity\nhypothesis which sounds as follows. For almost all potentials, the minimal\ncontact with external world, through only one particle of $N$, is sufficient\nfor ergodicity. But only if this contact has no memory. Also new results for\nquantum case are presented.\n", "  We report radio observations of the quasar PMN J1106-3647. Our data, taken\nwith the Australia Telescope Compact Array, show large variations in the\namplitude and shape of its spectrum, on a short time-scale. A great variety of\nspectral features is evident, including: sharp kinks; broad spectral peaks; and\nwiggles. No two spectra are alike. We interpret the variations as interstellar\nscintillation of a radio source that is compact, but not point-like. Under this\ninterpretation, complex spectral structure can arise purely refractively, under\nhigh magnification conditions, or from interference between waves that have\nbeen scattered by small-scale density fluctuations (diffractive scintillation).\nBoth effects may be playing a role in J1106-3647, and we tentatively identify\nkinks with the former, and wiggles with the latter. Diffractive scintillation\nof AGN is uncommon, as the fringe visibility is low for all but the most\ncompact radio sources. Refractive interpretation of the kink implies that the\nsource has a sharp, concave boundary. Our data are consistent with a mildly\nboosted synchrotron source, provided the scattering material is at a distance\n~50 pc from us.\n", "  The Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (Athena) is the X-ray\nobservatory mission selected by ESA within its Cosmic Vision 2015-2025\nprogramme to address the Hot and Energetic Universe scientific theme. The\nESO-Athena Synergy Team (EAST) has been tasked to single out the potential\nscientific synergies between Athena and optical/near-infrared (NIR) and sub/mm\nground based facilities, in particular those of ESO (i.e., the VLT and ELT,\nALMA and APEX), by producing a White Paper to identify and develop the: 1.\nneeds to access ESO ground-based facilities to achieve the formulated Athena\nscience objectives; 2. needs to access Athena to achieve the formulated science\nobjectives of ESO facilities contemporary to Athena; 3. science areas where the\nsynergetic use of Athena and ESO facilities in the late 2020s will result in\nscientific added value. Community input to the process happened primarily via a\ndedicated ESO - Athena Synergy Workshop that took place on Sept. 14 - 16, 2016\nat ESO, Garching. This White Paper presents the results of the EAST's work,\nsorted by synergy area, and deals with the following topics: 1. the Hot\nUniverse: Early groups and clusters and their evolution, Physics of the\nIntracluster medium, Missing baryons in cosmic filaments; 2. the Energetic\nUniverse: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) history, SMBH accretion disks, Active\nGalactic Nuclei feedback - Molecular outflows, Ultra-fast outflows, Accretion\nPhysics, Transient Science; 3. Observatory Science: Star Formation, Stars. It\nthen discusses the optical-NIR-sub-mm perspective by providing details on\nVLT/MOONS, the E-ELT instruments, in particular the MOS, VISTA/4MOST, the ESO\nand ALMA archives, future ALMA and ESO developments, and finally the (likely)\nESO - Athena astronomical scene in the 2020s. (abridged)\n", "  Understanding the oxidation and reduction mechanisms of catalytically active\ntransition metal nanoparticles is important to improve their application in a\nvariety of chemical processes. In nanocatalysis the nanoparticles can undergo\noxidation or reduction in situ, and thus the redox species are not what are\nobserved before and after reactions. We have used the novel environmental\nscanning transmission electron microscope (ESTEM) with 0.1 nm resolution in\nsystematic studies of complex dynamic oxidation and reduction mechanisms of\ncopper nanoparticles. The oxidation of copper has previously been reported to\nbe dependent on its crystallography and its interaction with the substrate. By\nfollowing the dynamic oxidation process in situ, in real time, with high-angle\nannular dark-field imaging in the ESTEM, we use conditions ideal to track the\noxidation front as it progresses across a copper nanoparticle by following the\nchanges in the atomic number (z) contrast with time. The oxidation occurs via\nthe nucleation of the oxide phase (Cu2O) from one area of the nanoparticle\nwhich then progresses unidirectionally across the particle, with the Cu-to-Cu2O\ninterface having a relationship of Cu{111} parallel to Cu2O{111}. The oxidation\nkinetics are related to the temperature and oxygen pressure. When the process\nis reversed in hydrogen, the reduction process is observed to be similar to the\noxidation, with the same crystallographic relationship between the two phases.\nThe dynamic observations provide unique insights into redox mechanisms which\nare important to understanding and controlling the oxidation and reduction of\ncopper-based nanoparticles.\n", "  Electrons in two-dimensional graphene sheets behave as interacting chiral\nDirac fermions and have unique screening properties due to their symmetry and\nreduced dimensionality. By using a combination of scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements and theoretical modeling we have\ncharacterized how graphene's massless charge carriers screen individual charged\ncalcium atoms. A back-gated graphene device configuration has allowed us to\ndirectly visualize how the screening length for this system can be tuned with\ncarrier density. Our results provide insight into electron-impurity and\nelectron-electron interactions in a relativistic setting with important\nconsequences for other graphene-based electronic devices.\n", "  Optical metasurfaces have great potential to form the platform for\nmanipulation of surface waves. A plethora of advanced surface-wave phenomena\nutilizing negative refraction, self-collimation and channeling of 2D waves can\nbe realized through on-demand engineering of dispersion properties of a\nperiodic metasurface. In this letter, we report on the first-time direct\nexperimental polarization-resolved measurement of dispersion of 2D optical\nplasmons supported by an anisotropic metasurface. We demonstrate that a\nsubdiffractive array of strongly coupled resonant anisotropic plasmonic\nnanoparticles supports unusual optical surface waves with mixed TE- and TM-like\npolarizations. With the assistance of numerical simulations we identify dipole\nand quadrupole dispersion bands. The shape of isofrequency contours changes\ndrastically with frequency exhibiting nontrivial transformations of their\ncurvature and topology that is consistently confirmed by the experimental data.\nBy revealing polarization degree of freedom for surface waves, our results open\nnew routes for designing of planar on-chip devices for surface photonics.\n", "  The flavour lepton symmetry is gauged for both the Standard Model flavor\ngroup and its extension with three degenerate right-handed neutrinos. As a\nconsequence of anomaly cancellation, exotic leptons are introduced which induce\na see-saw mechanism that generates the masses of the SM leptons. The model is\ncompared with Minimal Flavour Violation, the difference between the low-energy\neffective operators resulting is identified, as well as the distinctive\nexperimental signals, particularly promising in the $\\mu-\\tau$ sector.\n", "  We revisit Kesten's argument for the upper bound on the growth rate of DLA.\nWe are able to make the argument robust enough so that it applies to many\ngraphs, where only control of the heat kernel is required. We apply this to\nmany examples including transitive graphs of polynomial growth, graphs of\nexponential growth, non-amenable graphs, super-critical percolation on Z^d,\nhigh dimensional pre-Sierpinski carpets. We also observe that a careful\nanalysis shows that Kesten's original bound on Z^3 can be improved from t^{2/3}\nto (t log t)^{1/2} .\n", "  Half-Heusler alloys have been one of the benchmark high temperature\nthermoelectric materials owing to their thermal stability and promising figure\nof merit ZT. Simonson et al. early showed that small amounts of vanadium doped\nin Hf0.75Zr0.25NiSn enhanced the Seebeck coefficient and correlated the change\nwith the increased density of states near the Fermi level. We herein report a\nsystematic study on the role of vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), and tantalum (Ta)\nas prospective resonant dopants in enhancing the ZT of n-type half-Heusler\nalloys based on Hf0.6Zr0.4NiSn0.995Sb0.005. The V doping was found to increase\nthe Seebeck coefficient in the temperature range 300-1000 K, consistent with a\nresonant doping scheme. In contrast, Nb and Ta act as normal n-type dopants, as\nevident by the systematic decrease in electrical resistivity and Seebeck\ncoefficient. The combination of enhanced Seebeck coefficient due to the\npresence of V resonant states and the reduced thermal conductivity has led to a\nstate-of-the-art ZT of 1.3 near 850 K in n-type\n(Hf0.6Zr0.4)0.99V0.01NiSn0.995Sb0.005 alloys.\n", "  Anton Pannekoek (1873-1960) was both an influential Marxist and an innovative\nastronomer. This paper will analyse the various innovative methods that he\ndeveloped to represent the visual aspect of the Milky Way and the statistical\ndistribution of stars in the galaxy through a framework of epistemic virtues.\nDoing so will not emphasize the unique aspects of his astronomical research,\nbut also reveal its connections to his left radical brand of Marxism. A crucial\nfeature of Pannekoek's astronomical method was the active role ascribed to\nastronomers. They were expected to use their intuitive ability to organize data\naccording to the appearance of the Milky Way, while at the same time they had\nto avoid the influence of personal experience and theoretical presuppositions\nabout the shape of the system. With this method, he produced results that went\nagainst the Kapteyn Universe and instead made him the first astronomer in the\nNetherlands to find supporting evidence for Harlow Shapley's extended galaxy.\nAfter exploring Pannekoek's Marxist philosophy, it is argued that both his\nastronomical method and his interpretation of historical materialism can be\nseen as strategies developed to make optical use of his particular conception\nof the human mind.\n", "  A simple double-decker molecule with magnetic anisotropy, nickelocene, is\nattached to the metallic tip of a low-temperature scanning tunneling\nmicroscope. In the presence of a Cu(100) surface, the conductance around the\nFermi energy is governed by spin-flip scattering, the nature of which is\ndetermined by the tunneling barrier thickness. The molecular tip exhibits\ninelastic spin-flip scattering in the tunneling regime, while in the contact\nregime a Kondo ground state is stabilized causing an order of magnitude change\nin the zero-bias conductance. First principle calculations show that\nnickelocene reversibly switches from a spin 1 to 1/2 between the two transport\nregimes.\n", "  Mapping time series onto graphs and the use of graph theory methods opens up\nthe possibility to study the structure of the phase space manifolds underlying\nthe fluctuations of a dynamical variable. Here, we propose to go beyond the\nstandard graph measures and analyze the higher-order structures such as\ntriangles, tetrahedra and higher-order cliques and their complexes occurring in\nthe time-series networks, which are detectable by the algebraic topology\nmethods. We apply the methodology to the signal of Barkhausen noise\naccompanying the domain-wall dynamics on the hysteresis loop of disordered\nferromagnets driven by the external field. Our analysis demonstrates how the\nappearance of the complexes with cliques of a high order correlates to the\nenhanced collective fluctuations in the central part of the hysteresis loop, in\ncontrast to the fractional Gaussian noise fluctuations at the beginning of the\nloop, which correspond to the graph of a simpler topology. The multifractal\nanalysis of the corresponding segments of these time series confirms that we\ndeal with different types of the stochastic process.\n", "  The controversy regarding the precise nature of the high-temperature phase of\n1T-TiSe2 lasts for decades. It has intensified in recent times when new\nevidence for the excitonic origin of the low-temperature charge-density wave\nstate started to unveil. Here we address the problem of the high-temperature\nphase through precise measurements and detailed analysis of the optical\nresponse of 1T-TiSe2 single crystals. The separate responses of electron and\nhole subsystems are identified and followed in temperature. We show that\nneither semiconductor nor semimetal pictures can be applied in their generic\nforms as the scattering for both types of carriers is in the vicinity of the\nIoffe-Regel limit with decay rates being comparable to or larger than the\noffsets of band extrema. The nonmetallic temperature dependence of transport\nproperties comes from the anomalous temperature dependence of scattering rates.\nNear the transition temperature the heavy electrons and the light holes\ncontribute equally to the conductivity. This surprising coincidence is regarded\nas the consequence of dominant intervalley scattering that precedes the\ntransition. The low-frequency peak in the optical spectra is identified and\nattributed to the critical softening of the L-point collective mode.\n", "  We propose a strategy for large volume non-perturbative renormalization which\nalleviates the window problem by reducing cut-off effects. We perform a\nproof-of-concept study using position space renormalization scheme and the CLS\n$N_f=2+1$ ensembles generated at 5 different lattice spacings. We show that in\nthe advocated strategy results for the renormalization constants are to a large\nextend independent of the specific lattice direction used to define the\nrenormalization condition. Hence, very short lattice distances become\naccessible even on coarse lattices and the contact with perturbation theory can\nbe performed at much higher energy scales. Our results include\nnon-perturbatively estimated renormalization constants for quark bilinear\noperators in the scalar, pseudoscalar and axial-vector channels using position\nspace renormalization scheme which we subsequently translate to the\n$\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme perturbatively at $1.5$ GeV. Our proposal is\napplicable to other non-perturbative large volume renormalization schemes such\nas RI-MOM and its variants.\n", "  The phase, amplitude, speed, and polarization, in addition to many other\nproperties of light, can be modulated by photonic Bragg structures. In\nconjunction with nonlinearity and quantum effects, a variety of ensuing micro-\nor nano-photonic applications can be realized. This paper reviews various\noptical phenomena in several exemplary 1D Bragg gratings. Important examples\nare resonantly absorbing photonic structures, chirped Bragg grating, and\ncholesteric liquid crystals; their unique operation capabilities and key issues\nare considered in detail. These Bragg structures are expected to be used in\nwide-spread applications involving light field modulations, especially in the\nrapidly advancing field of ultrafast optical signal processing.\n", "  We present direct measurements of the superconducting order parameter in\nnearly optimal FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ single crystals with critical temperature\n$T_C \\approx 14$ K. Using intrinsic multiple Andreev reflection effect (IMARE)\nspectroscopy and measurements of lower critical field, we directly determined\ntwo superconducting gaps, $\\Delta_L \\approx 3.3 - 3.4$ meV and $\\Delta_S\n\\approx 1$ meV, and their temperature dependences. We show that a two-band\nmodel fits well the experimental data. The estimated electron-boson coupling\nconstants indicate a strong intraband and a moderate interband interaction.\n", "  Due to complexity and invisibility of human organs, diagnosticians need to\nanalyze medical images to determine where the lesion region is, and which kind\nof disease is, in order to make precise diagnoses. For satisfying clinical\npurposes through analyzing medical images, registration plays an essential\nrole. For instance, in Image-Guided Interventions (IGI) and computer-aided\nsurgeries, patient anatomy is registered to preoperative images to guide\nsurgeons complete procedures. Medical image registration is also very useful in\nsurgical planning, monitoring disease progression and for atlas construction.\nDue to the significance, the theories, methods, and implementation method of\nimage registration constitute fundamental knowledge in educational training for\nmedical specialists. In this chapter, we focus on image registration of a\nspecific human organ, i.e. the lung, which is prone to be lesioned. For\npulmonary image registration, the improvement of the accuracy and how to obtain\nit in order to achieve clinical purposes represents an important problem which\nshould seriously be addressed. In this chapter, we provide a survey which\nfocuses on the role of image registration in educational training together with\nthe state-of-the-art of pulmonary image registration. In the first part, we\ndescribe clinical applications of image registration introducing artificial\norgans in Simulation-based Education. In the second part, we summarize the\ncommon methods used in pulmonary image registration and analyze popular papers\nto obtain a survey of pulmonary image registration.\n", "  We report on the development of an ultralow noise thin-film based SQUID\nmagnetometer. A niobium thin-film pickup coil is connected to the input coil of\na SQUID current sensor. The low capacitance of the used sub-micrometer\ncross-type Josephson junctions enable superior noise performance of the device.\nApplication scenarios e.g. in geophysics and ultra-low field magnetic resonance\nimaging are discussed.\n", "  A deformed fermion gas model aimed at taking into account thermal and\nelectronic properties of quasiparticle systems is devised. The model is\nconstructed by the fermionic Fibonacci oscillators whose spectrum is given by a\ngeneralized Fibonacci sequence. We first introduce some new properties\nconcerning the Fibonacci calculus. We then investigate the low-temperature\nthermostatistical properties of the model, and derive many of the deformed\nthermostatistical functions such as the chemical potential and the entropy in\nterms of the model deformation parameters p and q. We specifically focus on the\np,q-deformed Sommerfeld parameter for the heat capacity of the model, and its\nbehavior is compared with those of both the free-electron Fermi theory and the\nexperimental data for some materials. The results obtained in this study reveal\nthat the present deformed fermion model leads to an effective approach\naccounting for interaction and compositeness of quasiparticles, which have\nremarkable implications in many technological applications such as in\nnanomaterials.\n", "  The traveling wave solutions to some nonlinear conformable time fractional\npartial differential equations in RLW-class are set up by using sech and csch\nansatzs. The conformable time fractional forms of the equal-width (EW),\nregularized long wave (RLW) and symmetric regularized long wave (sRLW)\nequations are considered in the study. By the assist of the simple traveling\nwave transformation, the equations are converted to some ordinary differential\nequations. Then, assuming these equations have solutions of forms of powers of\nsech and csch functions lead to determine the powers of the solutions if exist.\nThe determination of the relation among the other parameters in the solutions\nfollows the previous process. Finally, the solutions are expressed in some\nexplicit forms.\n", "  We report on the development of nearly quantum limited SQUIDs with miniature\npickup loop dimensions. The implemented high quality and low capacitance\ncross-type Nb/AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions offer large $I_CR_N$-products and\ntherefore enable an exceptional low noise level of the SQUIDs. Devices with\nloop dimensions of 1 {\\mu}m exhibit white flux noise levels as low as $45\nn{\\Phi}_0/Hz^{1/2}$ corresponding to an energy resolution {\\epsilon} of about 1\nh at 4.2 K, with h being Plancks constant. Moreover, the large usable voltage\nswings of the devices of about 300 {\\mu}V allow highly sensitive and easy\nsingle-stage operation while exploring nearly the intrinsic noise of the\nSQUIDs, beneficial e.g. for sensor arrays in SQUID microscopy.\n", "  The charged exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) observed by the Belle\ncollaboration in 2011 are very close to the B*Bbar and B*B*bar thresholds,\nrespectively. This suggests their interpretation as shallow hadronic molecules\nof B and B* mesons. Using the masses of the Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) as\ninput, we predict the phase shifts for the scattering of B and B* mesons off\nthe exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) to leading order in a\nnon-relativistic effective field theory with contact interactions. Moreover, we\nrule out the possibility for universal bound states of three B and B* mesons\narising from the Efimov effect.\n", "  We review the two standard equations of states based on the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and the thermodynamic bag (tdBag) model for\ndense, cold quark matter from a perspective based on the Dyson-Schwinger (DS)\nformalism. A different, but technically not more complicated approximation\nreproduces the model of Munczek and Nemirovsky (MN) which accounts in a\nsimplified way for chiral symmetry breaking and confinement as a dynamic\nprocess rooted in the momentum dependence of QCD model gap solutions. We review\nthe mass gap solutions for the MN model in the chiral limit and sketch the\nbehavior of mass gap solutions for finite bare quark masses at finite chemical\npotential.\n", "  We perform a detailed spectral study of a recent flaring activity from the\nFlat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ), 3C\\,454.3, observed simultaneously in\noptical, UV, X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray energies during 16 to 28 August, 2015. The\nsource reached its peak $\\gamma$-ray flux of $(1.9\\pm0.2)\\times\\,10^{-05} \\;\n{\\rm ph\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$ on 22 August. The time averaged broadband spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) is obtained for three time periods, namely \"flaring\nstate\"; covering the peak $\\gamma$-ray flux, \"post flaring state\"; immediately\nfollowing the peak flare and \"quiescent state\"; separated from the flaring\nevent and following the post flaring state. The SED corresponding to the\nflaring state is investigated using different emission models involving\nsynchrotron, synchrotron self Compton (SSC) and external Compton (EC)\nmechanisms. Our study suggests that the X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray emission from\n3C\\,454.3 cannot be attributed to a single emission mechanism and instead, one\nneeds to consider both SSC and EC mechanisms. Moreover, the target photon\nenergy responsible for the EC process corresponds to an equivalent temperature\nof 564 K, suggesting that the flare location lies beyond the broad line\nemitting region of the FSRQ. SED fitting of the other two flux states further\nsupports these inferences.\n", "  In the first part of this paper we establish a uniqueness result for\ncontinuity equations with velocity field whose derivative can be represented by\na singular integral operator of an $L^1$ function, extending the Lagrangian\ntheory in \\cite{BouchutCrippa13}. The proof is based on a combination of a\nstability estimate via optimal transport techniques developed in \\cite{Seis16a}\nand some tools from harmonic analysis introduced in \\cite{BouchutCrippa13}. In\nthe second part of the paper, we address a question that arose in\n\\cite{FilhoMazzucatoNussenzveig06}, namely whether 2D Euler solutions obtained\nvia vanishing viscosity are renormalized (in the sense of DiPerna and Lions)\nwhen the initial data has low integrability. We show that this is the case even\nwhen the initial vorticity is only in~$L^1$, extending the proof for the $L^p$\ncase in \\cite{CrippaSpirito15}.\n", "  During 2015 and 2016, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory\n(LIGO) conducted a three-month observing campaign. These observations delivered\nthe first direct detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole\nmergers. To search for these signals, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration uses\nthe PyCBC search pipeline. To deliver science results in a timely manner, LIGO\ncollaborated with the Open Science Grid (OSG) to distribute the required\ncomputation across a series of dedicated, opportunistic, and allocated\nresources. To deliver the petabytes necessary for such a large-scale\ncomputation, our team deployed a distributed data access infrastructure based\non the XRootD server suite and the CernVM File System (CVMFS). This data access\nstrategy grew from simply accessing remote storage to a POSIX-based interface\nunderpinned by distributed, secure caches across the OSG.\n", "  This report describes the methodology and results of an assessment study of\nthe performance of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) in its planned\nefforts to detect and catalog near-Earth objects (NEOs). The baseline LSST\nsurvey approach is designed to make only two visits to a given field in a given\nnight, leading to two possible NEO detections per night. These nightly pairs\nmust be linked across nights to derive orbits of moving objects. However, the\npresence of false detections in the data stream leads to the possibility of\nhigh rates of false tracklets, and the ensuing risk that the resulting orbit\ncatalog may be contaminated by false orbits. To understand the challenges\nstemming from a two-visit-per-night cadence, we conducted high-fidelity linkage\ntests on a full-density simulated LSST detection stream. We also sought to\nquantify the overall performance of LSST as an NEO discovery system under the\nhypothesis that detections from the baseline cadence can be successfully\nlinked. Our simulations revealed that in 10 years LSST would catalog ~60% of\nNEOs with absolute magnitude H<22, which is a proxy for 140m and larger\nobjects. This results neglects linking losses and the contribution of any other\nNEO surveys. Including our worst-case linking efficiency we reach a overall\nperformance assessment of 55% completeness of NEOs with H<22. We estimate that\nsurvey mis-modeling could account for systematic errors of up to 5%. We find\nthat restricting the evaluation metric to so-called Potentially Hazardous\nAsteroids (PHAs) increases the completeness by 3-4%, and that including the\nbenefits of past and expected future NEO survey activity increases completeness\nat the end of the baseline LSST survey by 15-20%. Assembling these results\nleads to a projection that by the end of the baseline LSST survey the NEO\ncatalog will be 80+/-5% complete for PHAs with H < 22.\n", "  Dark matter self-interactions are a well-motivated solution to the\ncore-vs.-cusp and the too-big-to-fail problems. They are commonly induced by\nmeans of a light mediator, that is also responsible for the dark matter\nfreeze-out in the early universe. Motivated by the fact that such scenario is\nexcluded in its simplest realizations, we will discuss the possibility that the\nrelic density of a self-interacting dark matter candidate can proceed from the\nfreeze-out of only annihilations into SM particles. We will argue that scalar\nand Majorana dark matter in the mass range of 10 to 500 MeV, coupled to a\nslightly heavier massive gauge boson, are the only candidates in agreement with\nmultiple current experimental constraints. We will also discuss prospects of\nestablishing or excluding these two scenarios in future experiments.\n", "  The velocity profile in a water bridge is reanalyzed. Assuming hypothetically\nthat the bulk charge has a radial distribution, a surface potential is formed\nthat is analogous to the Zeta potential. The Navier Stokes equation is solved,\nneglecting the convective term; then, analytically and for special field and\npotential ranges, a sign change of the total mass flow is reported caused by\nthe radial charge distribution.\n", "  The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) aims to detect extensive air showers\ncaused by the interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays with the Earth's\natmosphere, providing complementary information to the Auger surface,\nfluorescence and muon detectors. AERA, currently consisting of 124 radio\nstations, comprises an area of about 6 km$^{2}$. The main objective for\nexploiting a radio detector is to measure the fundamental air-shower\nparameters, such as the direction, energy and composition. We have developed\nreconstruction strategies and algorithms to precisely measure the air-shower\nparameters with high efficiency. In addition, we will present the results\nobtained by applying the reconstruction strategies on the experimental data\ntaken by AERA.\n", "  The extraction system of CSNS mainly consists of two kinds of magnets: eight\nkickers and one lambertson magnet. In this paper, firstly, the magnetic test\nresults of the eight kickers were introduced and then the filed uniformity and\nmagnetizing relationship of the kickers were given. Secondly, during the beam\ncommissioning in the future, in order to obtain more accurate magnetizing\nrelationship, a new method to measure the magnetizing coefficients of the\nkickers by the real extraction beam was given and the data analysis would also\nbe processed.\n", "  A charging method for electric vehicle using multi battery series mode which\nconsisted of the following steps was introduced: the battery series is firstly\ncharged at a constant power with a charging current of I1. When the terminal\nvoltage over the battery series has reached the 1st threshold voltage, the\ncharging current will reduce to I2 and the power remains constant. When the\nterminal voltage over the battery series has reached the 2nd threshold voltage,\nthe charging current will reduce to I3 and the power remains constant (the 2nd\nthreshold voltage is larger than 1st threshold voltage). When the terminal\nvoltage over the battery series has reached the 3rd threshold voltage, which is\nthe rated voltage of the battery series, the charging process is completed (3rd\nthreshold voltage is larger than 2nd threshold voltage). Contents in this paper\nprovide a charging method for electric vehicles using multi battery series mode\nwith high charging efficiency and security level.\n", "  In classical physics, properties of the objects exist independently on the\ncontext, i.e. whether and how measurements are performed. Quantum physics\nshowed this assumption to be wrong and that Nature is indeed \"contextual\".\nContextuality has been observed in the simplest physical systems such as single\nparticles, and plays fundamental roles in quantum computation advantage. Here,\nwe demonstrate for the first time quantum contextuality in an integrated\nphotonic chip. The chip implements different combinations of measurements on a\nsingle photon delocalized on four distinct spatial modes. We show violations of\na CHSH-like non-contextuality inequality by 14 standard deviations. This paves\nthe way to compact and portable devices for contextuality-based quantum-powered\nprotocols.\n", "  We examine the dynamics of strongly localized periodic solutions (discrete\nbreathers) in two-dimensional array of coupled finite one-dimensional chains of\noscillators. Localization patterns with both single and multiple localization\nsites (multibreathers) are considered. The model is scalar, i.e. each particle\ncan move only parallel to the axis of the chain it belongs to. The model\ninvolves symmetric parabolic on-site potential with rigid constraints (the\ndisplacement domain of each particle is finite) and a linear nearest-neighbor\ncoupling in the chain, and also between the neighbors in adjacent chains. When\nthe particle approaches the constraint, it undergoes an elastic Newtonian\nimpact. The rigid impact constraints are the only source of nonlinearity in the\nsystem. The model allows easy computation of highly accurate approximate\nsolutions for the breathers and multibreathers with an arbitrary set of\nlocalization sites in conservative setting. The vibro-impact nonlinearity\npermits explicit derivation of a monodromy matrix for the breather and\nmulti-breather solutions. Consequently, the stability of the derived breather\nand multibreather solutions can be studied in the framework of simple methods\nof linear algebra, without additional approximations. It is shown that due to\nthe coupling of the chains, the breather solutions can undergo the symmetry\nbreaking.\n", "  For metallic point contacts with Be and Al the magnetoquantum oscillations in\nthe contact resistance have been investigated as a function of the applied\nvoltage over the contact. For one set of point contacts the oscillation\namplitude is found to vary nonmonotonously with the applied voltage with\nsimilarities to the point-contact spectrum of the electron-phonon interaction.\nThe other part of the investigated point contacts shows a decrease of the\noscillation amplitude with increasing bias voltage. For the understanding of\nthe voltage dependence of the amplitude of the point-contact magnetoresistance\noscillations the influence of nonequilibrium phonons generated by the\nballistically injected electrons will be discussed.\n", "  The unique terahertz properties of graphene has been identified for novel\noptoelectronic applications. In a graphene sample with bias voltage added,\nthere is an enhanced absorption in the far infrared region and a diminished\nabsorption in the infrared region. The strength of enhancement(diminishment)\nincreases with the gate voltage, and the enhancement compensates the\ndiminishment. We find that it is the coherence length of electrons in graphene\nthat allows pure electronic transitions between states differing by small\nmomentums and makes intraband transition possible, is responsible for the far\ninfrared enhancement. Phonon assisted processes are not necessary and would not\nin any case contribute to a sum rule. This naturally leads to results obeying\nthe general sum-rule in optical absorptions. Our prediction of the strength of\nenhancement(diminishment) in terms of the bias agrees with experiments. This is\nthe first direct calculation we are aware of, since the prior phonon assisted\nmodel for indirect transition should not obey a sum rule.\n", "  The development of attosecond technology has enabled the real-time\nobservation of coherent electron motion in atoms, molecules and condensed\nphases. Experimentally, it is now possible to generate laser pulses of\ndurations of only a few tens of attoseconds. These durations are of the order\nof the revolution period of the first Bohr orbit (150 asec), opening the way to\nvisualize and even control electron dynamics at its natural time scale. This\nPhD thesis constitutes a theoretical study of fundamental phenomena occurring\nin gas-phase molecules upon interaction with light. We have investigated\nultrafast charge migration in biological molecules initiated by attosecond XUV\npulses. In addition, we have studied the high-energy interferences that arise\nin the vibrationally-resolved photoelectron spectra of small polyatomic\nmolecules. In order to explore these complex phenomena, we have employed\nnumerical methods that describe molecular photoionization by evaluating\ncontinuum scattering wave functions, allowing us to compute different\nobservables such as time-dependent electron densities or photoionization cross\nsections.\n"]}
