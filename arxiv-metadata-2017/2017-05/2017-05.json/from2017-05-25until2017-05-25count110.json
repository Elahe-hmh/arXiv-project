Some new features in our model are that (i) as the natural\nconsequences of anomaly cancelation the right-handed neutrinos exist, and the\nnumber of the observed fermion families is equal to the number of the\nfundamental colors; (ii) although the lepton and baryon charges are conserved,\nthe neutrinos can obtain small masses through the type I seesaw mechanism in\nsimilarity to the standard context, and the baryogenesis can be generated in\nseveral cases. They all are natural results due to the spontaneous breaking of\nthese charges. Some constraints on the new physics via flavor changing and\nrelated phenomenologies such as the stable scalar with anomalous electric\ncharge and interested processes at colliders are also discussed.\n", "  We propose a realistic experiment to demonstrate a dynamic\nKosterlitz-Thouless transition in ultra-cold atomic gases in two dimensions.\nWith a numerical implementation of the Truncated Wigner Approximation we\nsimulate the time evolution of several correlation functions, which can be\nmeasured via matter wave interference. We demonstrate that the relaxational\ndynamics is well-described by a real-time renormalization group approach, and\nargue that these experiments can guide the development of a theoretical\nframework for the understanding of critical dynamics.\n", "  We provide a self-consistent electromagnetic theory of the coupling between\ndipole emitters and dissipative nanoresonators. The theory that relies on the\nconcept of quasi-normal modes with complex frequencies provides an accurate\nclosed-form expression for the electromagnetic local density of states (LDOS)\nof any photonic or plasmonic resonator with strong radiation leakage,\nabsorption and material dispersion. It represents a powerful tool to calculate\nand conceptualize the electromagnetic response of systems that are governed by\na small number of resonance modes. We use the formalism to revisit Purcell's\nfactor. The new formula substantially differs from the usual one; in\nparticular, it predicts that a spectral detuning between the emitter and the\nresonance does not necessarily result in a Lorentzian response in the presence\nof dissipation. Comparisons with fully-vectorial numerical calculations for\nplasmonic nanoresonators made of gold nanorods evidence the high accuracy of\nthe predictions achieved by our semi-analytical treatment.\n", "  In the framework of the Europlanet-RI program, a prototype of Virtual\nObservatory dedicated to Planetary Science was defined. Most of the activity\nwas dedicated to the elaboration of standards to retrieve and visualize data in\nthis field, and to provide light procedures to teams who wish to contribute\nwith on-line data services. The architecture of this VO system and selected\nsolutions are presented here, together with existing demonstrators.\n", "  A Data Access Protocol has been set up to search and retrieve Planetary\nScience data in general. This protocol will allow the user to select a subset\nof data from an archive in a standard way, based on the IVOA Table Access\nProtocol (TAP). The TAP mechanism is completed by an underlying Data Model and\nreference dictionaries. This paper describes the principle of the EPN- TAP\nprotocol and interfaces, underlines the choices that have been made, and\ndiscusses possible evolutions.\n", "  A toolbox for the quantum simulation of polarons in ultracold atoms is\npresented. Motivated by the impressive experimental advances in the area of\nultracold atomic mixtures, we theoretically study the problem of ultracold\natomic impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate mixture (BEC). The\ncoupling between impurity and BEC gives rise to the formation of polarons whose\nmutual interaction can be effectively tuned using an external laser driving a\nquasi-resonant Raman transition between the BEC components. Our scheme allows\none to change the effective interactions between polarons in different sites\nfrom attractive to zero. This is achieved by simply changing the intensity and\nthe frequency of the two lasers. Such arrangement opens new avenues for the\nstudy of strongly correlated condensed matter models in ultracold gases.\n", "  We report results of the analysis for families of one-dimensional (1D)\ntrapped solitons, created by competing self-focusing (SF) quintic and\nself-defocusing (SDF) cubic nonlinear terms. Two trapping potentials are\nconsidered, the harmonic-oscillator (HO) and delta-functional ones. The models\napply to optical solitons in colloidal waveguides and other photonic media, and\nto matter-wave solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) loaded into a\nquasi-1D trap. For the HO potential, the results are obtained in an approximate\nform, using the variational and Thomas-Fermi approximations (VA and TFA), and\nin a full numerical form, including the ground state and the first\nantisymmetric excited one. For the delta-functional attractive potential, the\nresults are produced in a fully analytical form, and verified by means of\nnumerical methods. Both exponentially localized solitons and weakly localized\ntrapped modes are found for the delta-functional potential. The most essential\nconclusions concern the applicability of competing Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) and\nanti-VK criteria to the identification of the stability of solitons created\nunder the action of the competing SF and SDF terms.\n", "  We consider a lattice model of itinerant electrons coupled to an array of\nlocalized classical Heisenberg spins. The nature of the ground state ordered\nmagnetic phases that result from the indirect spin-spin coupling mediated by\nthe electrons is determined as a function of density and the spin-fermion\ncoupling $J$. At a fixed chemical potential, spiral phases exist only up to\nvalues of $J$ which are less than roughly half the electronic bandwidth. At a\nfixed electron density and near half filling, the system phase separates into a\nhalf-filled antiferromagnetic phase and a spiral phase. The ferromagnetic\nphases are shown to be fully polarized, while the spiral phases have equal\nadmixture of up and down spins. Phase separation survives in the presence of\nweak pairing field $\\Delta$ but disappears when $\\Delta$ exceeds a critical\nvalue $\\Delta_c$. If pairing fields are large enough, an additional spiral\nstate arises at strong coupling $J$. The relevance of this study, especially\nthe phase separation, to artificially engineered systems of adjacent itinerant\nelectrons and localized spins is discussed. In particular, we propose a method\nwhich might allow for the braiding of Majorana fermions by changing the density\nand moving their location as they are pulled along by a phase separation\nboundary.\n", "  In this paper we naturally obtain the values of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter\nas the solution of the simplicity constraints rather than setting it a priori.\nParticularly the Main theorem shows that if $\\gamma = \\pm i$ then the\nsimplicity constraints require that the corresponding Lorentz group\nrepresentations be necessary finite dimensional and therefore non-unitary.\n", "  Relativistic quantum metrology provides an optimal strategy for the\nestimation of parameters encoded in quantum fields in flat and curved\nspacetime. These parameters usually correspond to physical quantities of\ninterest such as proper times, accelerations, gravitational field strengths,\namong other spacetime parameters. The precise estimation of these parameters\ncan lead to novel applications in gravimeters, spacetime probes and\ngravitational wave detectors. Previous work in this direction only considered\npure probe states. In realistic situations, however, probe states are mixed. In\nthis paper, we provide a framework for the computation of optimal precision\nbounds for mixed single- and two-mode Gaussian states within quantum field\ntheory. This enables the estimation of spacetime parameters in case the field\nstates are initially at finite temperature.\n", "  In previous work it was shown that if certain series based on sums over\nprimes of non-principal Dirichlet characters have a conjectured random walk\nbehavior, then the Euler product formula for its $L$-function is valid to the\nright of the critical line $\\Re (s) > \\tfrac{1}{2}$, and the Riemann Hypothesis\nfor this class of $L$-functions follows. Building on this work, here we propose\nhow to extend this line of reasoning to the Riemann zeta function and other\nprincipal Dirichlet $L$-functions. We apply these results to the study of the\nargument of the zeta function. In another application, we define and study a\n1-point correlation function of the Riemann zeros, which leads to the\nconstruction of a probabilistic model for them. Based on these results we\ndescribe a new algorithm for computing very high Riemann zeros, and we\ncalculate the googol-th zero, namely $10^{100}$-th zero to over 100 digits, far\nbeyond what is currently known.\n", "  Observations of center of mass dynamics offer a straightforward method to\nidentify strongly interacting quantum phases of atoms placed in optical\nlattices. We theoretically study the dynamics of states derived from the\ndisordered Bose-Hubbard model in a trapping potential. We find that the edge\nstates in the trap allow center of mass motion even with insulating states in\nthe center. We identify short and long-time scale mechanisms for edge state\ntransport in insulating phases. We also argue that the center of mass velocity\ncan aid in identifying a Bose-glass phase. Our zero temperature results offer\nimportant insights into mechanisms of transport of atoms in trapped optical\nlattices while putting bounds on center of mass dynamics expected at non-zero\ntemperature.\n", "  We demonstrate automated generation of diffusion databases from\nhigh-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A total of more\nthan 230 dilute solute diffusion systems in Mg, Al, Cu, Ni, Pd, and Pt host\nlattices have been determined using multi-frequency diffusion models. We apply\na correction method for solute diffusion in alloys using experimental and\nsimulated values of host self-diffusivity. We find good agreement with\nexperimental solute diffusion data, obtaining a weighted activation barrier RMS\nerror of 0.176 eV when excluding magnetic solutes in non-magnetic alloys. The\ncompiled database is the largest collection of consistently calculated\nab-initio solute diffusion data in the world.\n", "  We reconsider the hypothesis of a vast cometary reservoir surrounding the\nSolar System - the Oort cloud of comets - within the framework of Milgromian\nDynamics (MD or MOND). For this purpose we built a numerical model of the cloud\nassuming QUMOND, a modified gravity theory of MD. In the modified gravity\nversions of MD, the internal dynamics of a system is influenced by the external\ngravitational field in which the system is embedded, even when this external\nfield is constant and uniform, a phenomenon dubbed the external field effect\n(EFE). Adopting the popular pair $\\nu(x)=[1-\\exp(-x^{1/2})]^{-1}$ for the MD\ninterpolating function and $a_{0}=1.2\\times10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ for the MD\nacceleration scale, we found that the observationally inferred Milgromian cloud\nof comets is much more radially compact than its Newtonian counterpart. The\ncomets of the Milgromian cloud stay away from the zone where the Galactic tide\ncan torque their orbits significantly. However, this does not need to be an\nobstacle for the injection of the comets into the inner solar system as the EFE\ncan induce significant change in perihelion distance during one revolution of a\ncomet around the Sun. Adopting constraints on different interpolating function\nfamilies and a revised value of $a_{0}$ (provided recently by the Cassini\nspacecraft), the aforementioned qualitative results no longer hold, and, in\nconclusion, the Milgromian cloud is very similar to the Newtonian in its\noverall size, binding energies of comets and hence the operation of the\nJupiter-Saturn barrier. However, EFE torquing of perihelia still play a\nsignificant role in the inner parts of the cloud. Consequently Sedna-like\norbits and orbits of large semi-major axis Centaurs are easily comprehensible\nin MD. In MD, they both belong to the same population, just in different modes\nof their evolution.\n", "  We consider the nonlinear scattering theory for three-terminal thermoelectric\ndevices, used for power generation or refrigeration. Such systems are quantum\nphase-coherent versions of a thermocouple, and the theory applies to systems in\nwhich interactions can be treated at a mean-field level. We consider an\narbitrary three-terminal system in any external magnetic field, including\nsystems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as chiral thermoelectrics, as\nwell as systems in which the magnetic field plays no role. We show that the\nupper bound on efficiency at given power output is of quantum origin and is\nstricter than Carnot's bound. The bound is exactly the same as previously found\nfor two-terminal devices, and can be achieved by three-terminal systems with or\nwithout broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. chiral and non-chiral\nthermoelectrics.\n", "  We present the first high-resolution sub-mm survey of both dust and gas for a\nlarge population of protoplanetary disks. Characterizing fundamental properties\nof protoplanetary disks on a statistical level is critical to understanding how\ndisks evolve into the diverse exoplanet population. We use ALMA to survey 89\nprotoplanetary disks around stars with $M_{\\ast}>0.1~M_{\\odot}$ in the young\n(1--3~Myr), nearby (150--200~pc) Lupus complex. Our observations cover the\n890~$\\mu$m continuum and the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O 3--2 lines. We use the\nsub-mm continuum to constrain $M_{\\rm dust}$ to a few Martian masses\n(0.2--0.4~$M_{\\oplus}$) and the CO isotopologue lines to constrain $M_{\\rm\ngas}$ to roughly a Jupiter mass (assuming ISM-like $\\rm {[CO]/[H_2]}$\nabundance). Of 89 sources, we detect 62 in continuum, 36 in $^{13}$CO, and 11\nin C$^{18}$O at $>3\\sigma$ significance. Stacking individually undetected\nsources limits their average dust mass to $\\lesssim6$ Lunar masses\n(0.03~$M_{\\oplus}$), indicating rapid evolution once disk clearing begins. We\nfind a positive correlation between $M_{\\rm dust}$ and $M_{\\ast}$, and present\nthe first evidence for a positive correlation between $M_{\\rm gas}$ and\n$M_{\\ast}$, which may explain the dependence of giant planet frequency on host\nstar mass. The mean dust mass in Lupus is 3$\\times$ higher than in Upper Sco,\nwhile the dust mass distributions in Lupus and Taurus are statistically\nindistinguishable. Most detected disks have $M_{\\rm gas}\\lesssim1~M_{\\rm Jup}$\nand gas-to-dust ratios $<100$, assuming ISM-like $\\rm {[CO]/[H_2]}$ abundance;\nunless CO is very depleted, the inferred gas depletion indicates that planet\nformation is well underway by a few Myr and may explain the unexpected\nprevalence of super-Earths in the exoplanet population.\n", "  We compare the predictions of Horizon-AGN, a hydro-dynamical cosmological\nsimulation that uses an adaptive mesh refinement code, to observational data in\nthe redshift range 0<z<6. We study the reproduction, by the simulation, of\nquantities that trace the aggregate stellar-mass growth of galaxies over cosmic\ntime: luminosity and stellar-mass functions, the star formation main sequence,\nrest-frame UV-optical-near infrared colours and the cosmic star-formation\nhistory. We show that Horizon-AGN, which is not tuned to reproduce the local\nUniverse, produces good overall agreement with these quantities, from the\npresent day to the epoch when the Universe was 5% of its current age. By\ncomparison to Horizon-noAGN, a twin simulation without AGN feedback, we\nquantify how feedback from black holes is likely to help shape galaxy\nstellar-mass growth in the redshift range 0<z<6, particularly in the most\nmassive galaxies. Our results demonstrate that Horizon-AGN successfully\ncaptures the evolutionary trends of observed galaxies over the lifetime of the\nUniverse, making it an excellent tool for studying the processes that drive\ngalaxy evolution and making predictions for the next generation of galaxy\nsurveys.\n", "  We present full volume cosmological simulations using the moving-mesh code\nAREPO to study the coevolution of dust and galaxies. We extend the dust model\nin AREPO to include thermal sputtering of grains and investigate the evolution\nof the dust mass function, the cosmic distribution of dust beyond the\ninterstellar medium, and the dependence of dust-to-stellar mass ratio on\ngalactic properties. The simulated dust mass function is well-described by a\nSchechter fit and lies closest to observations at $z = 0$. The radial scaling\nof projected dust surface density out to distances of $10 \\, \\text{Mpc}$ around\ngalaxies with magnitudes $17 < i < 21$ is similar to that seen in Sloan Digital\nSky Survey data, albeit with a lower normalisation. At $z = 0$, the predicted\ndust density of $\\Omega_\\text{dust} \\approx 1.3 \\times 10^{-6}$ lies in the\nrange of $\\Omega_\\text{dust}$ values seen in low-redshift observations. We find\nthat dust-to-stellar mass ratio anti-correlates with stellar mass for galaxies\nliving along the star formation main sequence. Moreover, we estimate the $850\n\\, \\mu\\text{m}$ number density functions for simulated galaxies and analyse the\nrelation between dust-to-stellar flux and mass ratios at $z = 0$. At high\nredshift, our model fails to produce enough dust-rich galaxies, and this\ntension is not alleviated by adopting a top-heavy initial mass function. We do\nnot capture a decline in $\\Omega_\\text{dust}$ from $z = 2$ to $z = 0$, which\nsuggests that dust production mechanisms more strongly dependent on star\nformation may help to produce the observed number of dusty galaxies near the\npeak of cosmic star formation.\n", "  We investigate the possibility that a chiral asymmetry during inflation can\nmanifest as net circular polarization in photons. Using an example known to\nproduce a helicity imbalance in fermions, we show that superhorizon photon\nmodes produced during inflation acquire net circular polarization. Modes that\nreenter the horizon around last scattering can thermalize into the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background while retaining a portion of their net circular\npolarization. We also consider the possibility of direct detection of the\ncircular polarization in the CMB.\n", "  We present systematic and comprehensive correlated-electron calculations of\nthe linear photoabsorption spectra of small neutral closed- and open-shell\nsodium clusters (Na_{n}, n=2-6), as well as closed-shell cation clusters\n(Na_{n}^{+}, n=3, 5). We have employed the configuration interaction (CI)\nmethodology at the full CI (FCI) and quadruple CI (QCI) levels to compute the\nground, and the low-lying excited states of the clusters. For most clusters,\nbesides the minimum energy structures, we also consider their energetically\nclose isomers. The photoabsorption spectra were computed under the\nelectric-dipole approximation, employing the dipole-matrix elements connecting\nthe ground state with the excited states of each isomer. Our calculations were\ntested rigorously for convergence with respect to the basis set, as well as\nwith respect to the size of the active orbital space employed in the CI\ncalculations. These calculations reveal that as far as electron-correlation\neffects are concerned, core excitations play an important role in determining\nthe optimized ground state geometries of various clusters, thereby requiring\nall-electron correlated calculations. But, when it comes to low-lying optical\nexcitations, only valence electron correlation effects play an important role,\nand excellent agreement with the experimental results is obtained within the\nfrozen-core approximation. For the case of Na_{6}, the largest cluster studied\nin this work, we also discuss the possibility of occurrence of plasmonic\nresonance in the optical absorption spectrum.\n", "  Two superconductors coupled by a weak link support an equilibrium Josephson\nelectrical current which depends on the phase difference $\\varphi$ between the\nsuperconducting condensates [1]. Yet, when a temperature gradient is imposed\nacross the junction, the Josephson effect manifests itself through a coherent\ncomponent of the heat current that flows oppositely to the thermal gradient for\n$ \\varphi <\\pi/2$ [2-4]. The direction of both the Josephson charge and heat\ncurrents can be inverted by adding a $\\pi$ shift to $\\varphi$. In the static\nelectrical case, this effect was obtained in a few systems, e.g. via a\nferromagnetic coupling [5,6] or a non-equilibrium distribution in the weak link\n[7]. These structures opened new possibilities for superconducting quantum\nlogic [6,8] and ultralow power superconducting computers [9]. Here, we report\nthe first experimental realization of a thermal Josephson junction whose phase\nbias can be controlled from $0$ to $\\pi$. This is obtained thanks to a\nsuperconducting quantum interferometer that allows to fully control the\ndirection of the coherent energy transfer through the junction [10]. This\npossibility, joined to the completely superconducting nature of our system,\nprovides temperature modulations with unprecedented amplitude of $\\sim$ 100 mK\nand transfer coefficients exceeding 1 K per flux quantum at 25 mK. Then, this\nquantum structure represents a fundamental step towards the realization of\ncaloritronic logic components, such as thermal transistors, switches and memory\ndevices [10,11]. These elements, combined with heat interferometers [3,4,12]\nand diodes [13,14], would complete the thermal conversion of the most important\nphase-coherent electronic devices and benefit cryogenic microcircuits requiring\nenergy management, such as quantum computing architectures and radiation\nsensors.\n", "  Our Galaxy hosts the annihilation of a few $\\times 10^{43}$ low-energy\npositrons every second. Radioactive isotopes capable of supplying such\npositrons are synthesised in stars, stellar remnants, and supernovae. For\ndecades, however, there has been no positive identification of a main stellar\npositron source leading to suggestions that many positrons originate from\nexotic sources like the Galaxy's central super-massive black hole or dark\nmatter annihilation. %, but such sources would not explain the\nrecently-detected positron signal from the extended Galactic disk. Here we show\nthat a single type of transient source, deriving from stellar populations of\nage 3-6 Gyr and yielding ~0.03 $M_\\odot$ of the positron emitter $^{44}$Ti, can\nsimultaneously explain the strength and morphology of the Galactic positron\nannihilation signal and the solar system abundance of the $^{44}$Ti decay\nproduct $^{44}$Ca. This transient is likely the merger of two low-mass white\ndwarfs, observed in external galaxies as the sub-luminous, thermonuclear\nsupernova known as SN1991bg-like.\n", "  Magnetic and thermodynamical properties of a system of spins in a honeycomb\nlattice, such as magnetization, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat, in a\nlow-temperature regime are investigated by considering the effects of a\nKekul\\'e scalar exchange and QED vacuum polarization corrections to the\ninterparticle potential. The spin lattice calculations are carried out by means\nof Monte Carlo simulations. We present a number of comparative plots of all the\nphysical quantities we have considered and a detailed analysis is presented to\nillustrate the main features and the variation profiles of the properties with\nthe applied external magnetic field and temperature.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the intensity mapping technique using\nupdated models for the different emission lines from galaxies and identify\nwhich ones are more promising for cosmological studies of the post reionization\nepoch. We consider the emission of ${\\rm Ly\\alpha}$, ${\\rm H\\alpha}$, H$\\beta$,\noptical and infrared oxygen lines, nitrogen lines, CII and the CO rotational\nlines. We then identify that ${\\rm Ly\\alpha}$, ${\\rm H\\alpha}$, OII, CII and\nthe lowest rotational CO lines are the best candidates to be used as IM probes.\nThese lines form a complementary set of probes of the galaxies emission\nspectra. We then use reasonable experimental setups from current, planned or\nproposed experiments to access the detectability of the power spectrum of each\nemission line. Intensity mapping of ${\\rm Ly\\alpha}$ emission from $z=2$ to 3\nwill be possible in the near future with HETDEX, while far-infrared lines\nrequire new dedicated experiments. We also show that the proposed SPHEREx\nsatellite can use OII and ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ IM to study the large-scale\ndistribution of matter in intermediate redshifts of 1 to 4. We found that\nsubmilimeter experiments with bolometers can have similar performances at\nintermediate redshifts using CII and CO(3-2).\n", "  Strongly correlated electrostatics of DNA systems has drawn the interest of\nmany groups, especially the condensation and overcharging of DNA by multivalent\ncounterions. By adding counterions of different valencies and shapes, one can\nenhance or reduce DNA overcharging. In this papers, we focus on the effect of\nmultivalent co-ions, specifically divalent co-ions such as SO$_4^{2-}$. A\ncomputational experiment of DNA condensation using Monte$-$Carlo simulation in\ngrand canonical ensemble is carried out where DNA system is in equilibrium with\na bulk solution containing a mixture of salt of different valency of co-ions.\nCompared to system with purely monovalent co-ions, the influence of divalent\nco-ions shows up in multiple aspects. Divalent co-ions lead to an increase of\nmonovalent salt in the DNA condensate. Because monovalent salts mostly\nparticipate in linear screening of electrostatic interactions in the system,\nmore monovalent salt molecules enter the condensate leads to screening out of\nshort-range DNA$-$DNA like charge attraction and weaker DNA condensation free\nenergy. The overcharging of DNA by multivalent counterions is also reduced in\nthe presence of divalent co$-$ions. Strong repulsions between DNA and divalent\nco-ions and among divalent co-ions themselves leads to a {\\em depletion} of\nnegative ions near DNA surface as compared to the case without divalent\nco-ions. At large distance, the DNA$-$DNA repulsive interaction is stronger in\nthe presence of divalent co$-$ions, suggesting that divalent co$-$ions role is\nnot only that of simple stronger linear screening.\n", "  The experimental study of the second-order interference with fermions is much\nless than the one with bosons since it is much more difficult to do experiments\nwith fermions than with photons. Based on the conclusion that the behavior of\ntwo identical classical particles has exactly half fermionic and half bosonic\ncharacteristics (PRA \\textbf{88}, 012130 (2013)), we have studied the\nsecond-order interference of fermions via the second-order interference of\nphotons in Hanbury Brown-Twiss and Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometers,\nrespectively. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical\npredictions, which serve as an efficient guidance for the future interference\nexperiments with fermions. The employed method offers an interesting and\nconvenient way to study the coherence of fermions.\n", "  We consider the mechanical motion of a system of six macroscopic pendula\nwhich are connected with springs and arranged in a hexagonal geometry. When the\nsprings are pre-tensioned, the coupling between neighbouring pendula along the\nlongitudinal (L) and the transverse (T) directions are different: identifying\nthe motion along the L and T directions as a spin-like degree of freedom, we\ntheoretically and experimentally verify that the pre-tensioned springs result\nin a tunable spin-orbit coupling. We elucidate the structure of such a\nspin-orbit coupling in the extended two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, making\nconnections to physics of graphene. The experimental frequencies and the\noscillation patterns of the eigenmodes for the hexagonal ring of pendula are\nextracted from a spectral analysis of the motion of the pendula in response to\nan external excitation and are found to be in good agreement with our\ntheoretical predictions. We anticipate that extending this classical analogue\nof quantum mechanical spin-orbit coupling to two-dimensional lattices will lead\nto exciting new topological phenomena in classical mechanics.\n", "  Effective operators have been used extensively to understand small deviations\nfrom the Standard Model in the search for new physics. So far there has been no\ngeneral method to fit for small parameters when higher order corrections in\nthese parameters are present but unknown. We present a new technique that\nsolves this problem, allowing for an exact p-value calculation under the\nassumption that higher order theoretical contributions can be treated as\ngaussian distributed random variables. The method we propose is general, and\nmay be used in the analysis of any perturbative theoretical prediction,\nie.~truncated power series. We illustrate this new method by performing a fit\nof the Standard Model Effective Field Theory parameters, which include\neg.~anomalous gauge and four-fermion couplings.\n", "  We report an experimental-computational study of the optical properties of\nplasma mirrors (PMs) at the incident laser frequency when irradiated directly\nat relativistic intensity (1e18 < I_0 < 1e19 W/cm^2) by near-normally incident\n(4 degree), high-contrast, 30 fs, 800 nm laser pulses. We find that such\nrelativistic PMs are highly reflective (0.6 to 0.8), and focus a significant\nfraction of reflected light to intensity as large as 10I_0 at distance f as\nsmall 25 microns from the PM, provided that pre-pulses do not exceed 1e14\nW/cm^2 prior to 20 ps before arrival of the main pulse peak. Particle-in-cell\nsimulations show that focusing results from denting of the reflecting surface\nby light pressure combined with relativistic transparency, and that\nreflectivity and f can be adjusted by controlling pre-plasma length L over the\nrange 0.5 < L < 3 microns. Pump-probe reflectivity measurements show the PM's\nfocusing properties evolve on a ps time scale.\n", "  It is seen by a coupled-channel calculation that in the two-baryon N-Delta or\nDelta-Delta system the width of the state is greatly diminished due to the\nrelative kinetic energy of the two baryons, since the internal energy of the\nparticles, available for pionic decay, is smaller. A similar state dependent\neffect arises from the centrifugal barrier in N-Delta or Delta-Delta systems\nwith non-zero orbital angular momentum. The double-Delta width can become even\nsmaller than the free width of a single Delta. This has some bearing to the\ninterpretation of the d'(2380) resonance recently discovered at COSY.\n", "  In this paper, we compute the probability that an $N \\times N$ matrix from\nthe generalised Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (gGUE) is positive definite,\nextending a previous result of Dean and Majumdar \\cite{DM}. For this purpose,\nwe work out the large degree asymptotics of semi-classical Laguerre polynomials\nand their recurrence coefficients, using the steepest descent analysis of the\ncorresponding Riemann--Hilbert problem.\n", "  Cross sections for the production of a Z boson in association with jets in\nproton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 8 TeV are\nmeasured using a data sample collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC\ncorresponding to 19.6 inverse femtobarns. Differential cross sections are\npresented as functions of up to three observables that describe the jet\nkinematics and the jet activity. Correlations between the azimuthal directions\nand the rapidities of the jets and the Z boson are studied in detail. The\npredictions of a number of multileg generators with leading or next-to-leading\norder accuracy are compared with the measurements. The comparison shows the\nimportance of including multi-parton contributions in the matrix elements and\nthe improvement in the predictions when next-to-leading order terms are\nincluded.\n", "  We present the zero temperature phase diagram of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet\non a frustrated triangular lattice with nearest neighbor ($J_1$) and next\nnearest neighbor ($J_2$) interactions, in a magnetic field. We show that the\nclassical model has an accidental degeneracy for all $J_2/J_1$ and all fields,\nbut the degeneracy is lifted by quantum fluctuations. We show that at large\n$S$, for $J_2/J_1 <1/8$, quantum fluctuations select the same sequence of three\nsublattice co-planar states in a field as for $J_2 =0$, and for $1/8<J_2/J_1\n<1$ they select the canted stripe state for all non-zero fields. The transition\nbetween the two states is first order in all fields, with the hysteresis width\nset by quantum fluctuations. We study the model with arbitrary $S$, including\n$S=1/2$, near the saturation field by exploring the fact that near saturation\nthe density of bosons is small for all $S$. We show that for $S >1$, the\ntransition remains first order, with a finite hysteresis width, but for $S=1/2$\nand, possibly, $S=1$, there appears a new intermediate phase, likely without a\nspontaneous long-range order.\n", "  A search for single production of vector-like top quark partners (T) decaying\ninto a Higgs boson and a top quark is performed using data from pp collisions\nat a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the\nCERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns.\nThe top quark decay includes an electron or a muon while the Higgs boson decays\ninto a pair of b quarks. No significant excess over standard model backgrounds\nis observed. Exclusion limits on the product of the production cross section\nand the branching fraction are derived in the T quark mass range 700 to 1800\nGeV. For a mass of 1000 GeV, values of the product of the production cross\nsection and the branching fraction greater than 0.8 and 0.7 pb are excluded at\n95% confidence level, assuming left- and right-handed coupling of the T quark\nto standard model particles, respectively. This is the first analysis setting\nexclusion limits on the cross section of singly produced vector-like T quarks\nat a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.\n", "  These notes grew out of a lecture course on mathematical methods of classical\nphysics for students of mathematics and mathematical physics at the master's\nlevel. Also, physicists with a strong interest in mathematics may find this\ntext useful as a resource complementary to existing textbooks on classical\nphysics. Topics include Lagrangian Mechanics, Hamiltonian Mechanics,\nHamilton-Jacobi Theory, as well as Classical Field Theory formulated in the\nlanguage of jet bundles. The latter topic also covers important examples of\nfield theories such as sigma models, gauge theory, and Einstein's theory of\ngeneral relativity.\n", "  We consider the existence and stability of the Einstein static universe under\nthe Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) effects. We show that this solution\nin the presence of perfect fluid with a minimal length is cyclically stable\naround a center equilibrium point. By taking linear homogeneous perturbations,\nwe find that the scale factor of Einstein static universe for closed deformed\nisotropic and homogeneous FLRW universe depends on the GUP coupling parameter\n$\\alpha$. Thus, in the model by GUP effects, our universe can stay at the\nEinstein static state past-eternally, which means that the big bang singularity\nmight be resolved successfully by an emergent scenario.\n", "  Uncertainty relation lies at the heart of quantum mechanics, characterizing\nthe incompatibility of non-commuting observables in the preparation of quantum\nstates. An important question is how to improve the lower bound of uncertainty\nrelation. Here we present a variance-based sum uncertainty relation for $N$\nincompatible observables stronger than the simple generalization of the\nuncertainty relation for two observables derived by Maccone and Pati [Phys.\nRev. Lett. {\\bf113}, 260401 (2014)]. Further comparisons of our uncertainty\nrelation with other related ones for spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$ particles\nindicate that the obtained uncertainty relation gives a better lower bound.\n", "  Topological semimetals are systems in which the conduction and the valence\nbands cross each other and this crossing is protected by topological\nconstraints. These materials provide an intriguing test of fundamental theory\nand their exceptional physical properties promise a wide range of possible\napplications. Here we report a study of the thermoelectric power (S) for a\nsingle crystal of ZrSiS that is believed to be a topological nodal-line\nsemimetal. We detect multiple quantum oscillations in the magnetic field\ndependence of S that are still visible at temperature as high as T = 100 K. Two\nof these oscillation frequencies are shown to arise from 3D and 2D bands, each\nwith linear dispersion and the additional Berry phase expected theoretically.\n", "  The anti-Stokes scattering and Stokes scattering in stimulated Brillouin\nscattering (SBS) cascade have been researched by the Vlasov-Maxwell simulation.\nIn the high-intensity laser-plasmas interaction, the stimulated anti-Stokes\nBrillouin scattering (SABS) will occur after the second stage SBS rescattering.\nThe mechanism of SABS has been put forward to explain this phenomenon. And the\nSABS will compete with the SBS rescattering to determine the total SBS\nreflectivity. Thus, the SBS rescattering including the SABS is an important\nsaturation mechanism of SBS, and should be taken into account in the\nhigh-intensity laser-plasmas interaction.\n", "  We provide a physical definition of new homological invariants $\\mathcal{H}_a\n(M_3)$ of 3-manifolds (possibly, with knots) labeled by abelian flat\nconnections. The physical system in question involves a 6d fivebrane theory on\n$M_3$ times a 2-disk, $D^2$, whose Hilbert space of BPS states plays the role\nof a basic building block in categorification of various partition functions of\n3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theory $T[M_3]$: $D^2\\times S^1$ half-index, $S^2\\times S^1$\nsuperconformal index, and $S^2\\times S^1$ topologically twisted index. The\nfirst partition function is labeled by a choice of boundary condition and\nprovides a refinement of Chern-Simons (WRT) invariant. A linear combination of\nthem in the unrefined limit gives the analytically continued WRT invariant of\n$M_3$. The last two can be factorized into the product of half-indices. We show\nhow this works explicitly for many examples, including Lens spaces, circle\nfibrations over Riemann surfaces, and plumbed 3-manifolds.\n", "  We detected the seasonal modulation of the $^7$Be neutrino interaction rate\nwith the Borexino detector at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy.\nThe period, amplitude, and phase of the observed time evolution of the signal\nare consistent with its solar origin, and the absence of an annual modulation\nis rejected at 99.99\\% C.L. The data are analyzed using three methods: the\nsinusoidal fit, the Lomb-Scargle and the Empirical Mode Decomposition\ntechniques, which all yield results in excellent agreement.\n", "  It has been proposed that interactions lead to ferromagnetism on a zigzag\nedge of a graphene sheet. While not yet directly studied experimentally,\ndramatically improving techniques for making and studying clean zigzag edges\nmay soon make this possible. So far, most theoretical investigations of this\nclaim have been based on mean field theories or more exact calculations using\nthe Hubbard model. But long-range Coulomb interactions are unscreened in\ngraphene so it is important to consider their effects. We study rather general\nnon-local interactions, including of Coulomb $1/r$ form, using the technique of\nprojection to a strongly interacting edge Hamiltonian, valid at first order in\nthe interactions. The ground states as well as electron/hole and exciton\nexcitations are studied in this model. Our results indicate that ferromagnetism\nsurvives with unscreened Coulomb interactions.\n", "  Elliptic flow, $v_2$, and triangular flow, $v_3$, are to a good approximation\nlinearly proportional to the corresponding spatial anisotropies of the initial\ndensity profile, $\\varepsilon_2$ and $\\varepsilon_3$. Using event-by-event\nhydrodynamic simulations, we point out when deviations from this linear scaling\nare to be expected. When these deviations are negligible, relative $v_n$\nfluctuations are equal to relative $\\varepsilon_n$ fluctuations, and one can\ndirectly probe models of initial conditions using ratios of cumulants, for\ninstance $v_n\\{4\\}/v_n\\{2\\}$. We argue that existing models of initial\nconditions tend to overestimate flow fluctuations in central Pb+Pb collisions,\nand to underestimate them in peripheral collisions. We make predictions for\n$v_3\\{6\\}$ in noncentral Pb+Pb collisions, and for $v_3\\{4\\}$ and $v_3\\{6\\}$ in\nhigh-multiplicity p+Pb collisions.\n", "  Low-energy excitations in graphene exhibit relativistic properties due to the\nlinear dispersion relation close to the Dirac points in the first Brillouin\nzone. Two of the Dirac points located at opposite corners of the first\nBrillouin zone can be chosen as inequivalent, representing a new valley degree\nof freedom, in addition to the charge and spin of an electron. Using the valley\ndegree of freedom to encode information has attracted significant interest,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, and gave rise to the field of\nvalleytronics. We study a graphene $p$-$n$ junction in a uniform out-of-plane\nmagnetic field as a platform to generate and controllably manipulate the valley\npolarization of electrons. We show that by tuning the external potential giving\nrise to the $p$-$n$ junction we can switch the current from one valley\npolarization to the other. We also consider the effect of different types of\nedge terminations and present a setup, where we can partition an incoming\nvalley-unpolarized current into two branches of valley-polarized currents. The\nbranching ratio can be chosen by changing the location of the $p$-$n$ junction\nusing a gate.\n", "  We propose a scenario where both inflation and dark matter are described by a\nsingle axion-like particle (ALP) in a unified manner. In a class of the minimal\naxion hilltop inflation, the effective masses at the maximum and mimimum of the\npotential have equal magnitude but opposite sign, so that the ALP inflaton is\nlight both during inflation and in the true vacuum. After inflation, most of\nthe ALPs decay and evaporate into plasma through a coupling to photons, and the\nremaining ones become dark matter. We find that the observed CMB and matter\npower spectrum as well as the dark matter abundance point to an ALP of mass\n$m_\\phi = {\\cal O}(0.01)$ eV and the axion-photon coupling $g_{\\phi \\gamma\n\\gamma} ={\\cal O}(10^{-11})$GeV$^{-1}$: the ALP miracle. The suggested\nparameter region is within the reach of the next generation axion helioscope,\nIAXO. Furthermore, thermalized ALPs contribute to hot dark matter and its\nabundance is given in terms of the effective number of extra neutrino species,\n$\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 0.03$, which can be tested by the future CMB\nexperiments. We also discuss a case with multiple ALPs, where the coupling to\nphotons can be enhanced in the early Universe by an order of magnitude or more,\nwhich enlarges the parameter space for the ALP miracle. The heavy ALP plays a\nrole of the waterfall field in hybrid inflation, and reheats the Universe, and\nit can be searched for in various experiments such as SHiP.\n", "  The simplicity constraint is studied in the context of 4d spinfoam models\nwith cosmological constant. We find that the quantum simplicity constraint is\nrealized as the 2d surface defect in SL(2,$\\mathbb{C}$) Chern-Simons theory in\nthe construction of spinfoam amplitudes. By this realization of simplicity\nconstraint in Chern-Simons theory, we are able to construct the new spinfoam\namplitude with cosmological constant for arbitrary simplicial complex (with\nmany 4-simplices). The semiclassical asymptotics of the amplitude is shown to\nreproduce correctly the 4-dimensional Einstein-Regge action with cosmological\nconstant term.\n", "  Nonuniform strain distributions in a graphene lattice can give rise to\nuniform pseudomagnetic fields and associated pseudo-Landau levels without\nbreaking time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate that by inducing\nsuperconductivity in a nonuniformly strained graphene sheet, the lowest\npseudo-Landau levels split by a pairing gap can be inverted by changing the\nsign of the pairing potential. As a consequence of this inversion, we predict\nthat a Josephson $\\pi$ junction deposited on top of a strained graphene sheet\nexhibits one-dimensional gapless modes propagating along the junction. These\ngapless modes mediate single electron tunneling across the junction, giving\nrise to the $4\\pi$-periodic fractional Josephson effect.\n", "  We present a time-dependent solution of the Maxwell equations in the Einstein\nuniverse, whose electric and magnetic fields, as seen by the stationary\nobservers, are aligned with the Clifford parallels of the $3$-sphere $S^3$. The\nconformal equivalence between Minkowski's spacetime and (a region of) the\nEinstein cylinder is then exploited in order to obtain a knotted, finite\nenergy, radiating solution of the Maxwell equations in flat spacetime. We also\ndiscuss similar electromagnetic fields in expanding closed Friedmann models,\nand compute the matter content of such configurations.\n", "  We study the current-driven skyrmion expulsion from magnetic nanostrips using\nmicromagnetic simulations and analytic calculations. We explore the threshold\ncurrent density for the skyrmion expulsion, and show that this threshold is\ndetermined by the critical boundary force as well as the spin-torque\nparameters. We also find the dependence of the critical boundary force on the\nmagnetic parameters; the critical boundary force decreases with increasing the\nexchange stiffness and perpendicular anisotropy constants, while it increases\nwith increasing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and saturation magnetization\nconstants. Using a simple model describing the skyrmion and locally-tilted edge\nmagnetization, we reveal the underlying physics of the dependence of the\ncritical boundary force on the magnetic parameters based on the relation\nbetween the scaled Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction parameter and the critical\nboundary force. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the skyrmion\nexpulsion and the interaction between the skymion and boundaries of devices and\nshows that the stability of the skyrmion in devices can be related to the\nscaled Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction parameter of magnetic materials.\n", "  We developed a new mechanical model for determining the compression and shear\nmechanical behavior of four different hemoglobin structures. Previous studies\non hemoglobin structures have focused primarily on overall mechanical behavior;\nhowever, this study investigates the mechanical behavior of hemoglobin, a major\nconstituent of red blood cells (RBCs), using steered molecular dynamics (SMD)\nsimulations to obtain anisotropic mechanical behavior under compression and\nshear loading conditions. Four different configurations of hemoglobin molecules\nwere considered: deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb), oxyhemoglobin (HbO2),\ncarboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The SMD simulations\nwere performed on the hemoglobin variants to estimate their unidirectional\nstiffness and shear stiffness. Although hemoglobin is structurally denoted as a\nglobular protein due to its spherical shape and secondary structure, our\nsimulation results show a significant variation in the mechanical strength in\ndifferent directions (anisotropy) and also a strength variation among the four\ndifferent hemoglobin configurations studied. The glycated hemoglobin molecule\npossesses an overall higher compressive mechanical stiffness and shear\nstiffness when compared to deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and\ncarboxyhemoglobin molecules. Further results from the models indicate that the\nhemoglobin structures studied possess a soft outer shell and a stiff core based\non stiffness.\n", "  In this work, I improve on and extend to low and high $Q^2$ values the\nextractions of the $\\varepsilon$ dependence of the real parts of the two-photon\nexchange (TPE) amplitudes relative to the magnetic form factor, as well as the\nratio $P_l/P_l^{Born} (\\varepsilon,Q^2)$ by using world data on\n$\\sigma_R(\\varepsilon,Q^2)$ with an emphasis on precise new data covering the\nlow-momentum region which is sensitive to the large-scale structure of the\nnucleon. I provide simple parametrizations of the TPE amplitudes, along with an\nestimate of the fit uncertainties. The extracted TPE amplitudes are compared\nwith previous phenomenological extractions and TPE calculations. The\n$P_l/P_l^{Born}$ ratio is extracted by using the new parametrizations of the\nTPE amplitudes and compared to previous extractions, TPE calculations, and\ndirect measurements at $Q^2$ = 2.50 (GeV/c)$^2$. The extracted TPE amplitudes\nare on the few-percentage-points level and behave roughly linearly with\nincreasing $Q^2$ where they become nonlinear at high $Q^2$. Contrary to $Y_M$,\nwhich is influenced mainly by elastic contributions, I find $Y_E$ to be\ninfluenced by inelastic contributions at large $Q^2$ values. While $Y_E$ and\n$Y_3$ differ in magnitude, they have opposite sign and tend to partially cancel\neach other. This suggests that the TPE correction to\n$\\sigma_R(\\varepsilon,Q^2)$ is driven mainly by $Y_M$ and to a lesser extent by\n$Y_3$ in agreement with previous phenomenological extractions and hadronic TPE\ncalculations.\n", "  One important development in interaction potential models, or atomistic force\nfields, for molecular simulation is the inclusion of explicit polarisation,\nwhich represents the induction effects of charged or polar molecules on\npolarisable electron clouds. Polarisation can be included through fluctuating\ncharges, induced multipoles or Drude dipoles. This work uses Drude dipoles and\nis focused on room-temperature ionic liquids, for which fixed-charge models\npredict too slow dynamics. The aim of this study is to devise a strategy to\nadapt existing non-polarisable force fields upon addition of polarisation,\nbecause induction was already contained to an extent, implicitly, due to\nparametrisation against empirical data. Therefore, a fraction of the van der\nWaals interaction energy should be subtracted so that the Lennard-Jones terms\nonly account for dispersion and the Drude dipoles for induction.\nSymmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is used to resolve the dispersion\nand induction terms in dimers and to calculate scaling factors to reduce the\nLennard-Jones terms from the non-polarisable model. Simply adding Drude dipoles\nto an existing fixed-charge model already improves the prediction of transport\nproperties, increasing diffusion coefficients and lowering the viscosity.\nScaling down the Lennard-Jones terms leads to still faster dynamics and to\ndensities that match experiment extremely well. The concept developed here\nimproves the prediction of density and transport properties and can be adapted\nto other models and systems. The inclusion of polarisation and the down-scaling\nof Lennard-Jones terms affects onyl slightly the ordering of the first shell of\ncounterions, leading to small decreases in coordination numbers. The effect of\npolarisation is major beyond first neighbours, weakening spatial correlations,\na structural effect related to the faster dynamics of polarisable models.\n", "  We introduce and experimentally characterize a superconducting\nsingle-sideband modulator compatible with cryogenic microwave circuits, and\npropose its use for frequency domain multiplexing of superconducting qubit\nreadout. The monolithic single-quadrature modulators that comprise the device\nare formed with purely reactive elements (capacitors and Josephson junction\ninductors) and require no microwave-frequency control tones. Microwave signals\nin the 4 to 8 GHz band, with power up to -85 dBm, are converted up or down in\nfrequency by as much as 120 MHz. Spurious harmonics in the device can be\nsuppressed by up to 25 dB for select probe and modulation frequencies.\n", "  Bragg-reflection waveguides emitting broadband parametric down-conversion\n(PDC) have been proven to be well suited for the on-chip generation of\npolarization entanglement in a straightforward fashion [R. T. Horn et al., Sci.\nRep. 3, 2314 (2013)]. Here, we investigate how the properties of the created\nstates can be modified by controlling the relative temporal delay between the\npair of photons created via PDC. Our results offer an easily accessible\napproach for changing the coherence of the polarization entanglement, in other\nwords, to tune the phase of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix.\nFurthermore, we provide valuable insight in the engineering of these states\ndirectly at the source.\n", "  This study proceeds with the development of the technique employing velocity\ngradients that were identified in (\\cite{GL17}, henceforth GL17) as a means of\nprobing magnetic field in interstellar media. We demonstrate a number of\npractical ways on improving the accuracy of tracing magnetic fields in diffuse\ninterstellar media using velocity centroid gradients (VCGs). Addressing the\nmagnetic field tracing in super-Alfvenic turbulence we introduce the procedure\nof filtering low spatial frequencies, that enables magnetic field tracing in\nthe situations when the kinetic energy of turbulent plasmas dominate its\nmagnetic energy. We propose the synergic way of of using VCGs together with\nintensity gradients (IGs), synchrotron intensity gradients (SIGs) as well as\ndust polarimetry. We show that while the IGs trace magnetic field worse than\nthe VCGs, the deviations of the angle between the IGs and VCGs trace the shocks\nin diffuse media. Similarly the perpendicular orientation of the VCGs and the\nSIGs or to the dust polarimetry data trace the regions of gravitational\ncollapse. We demonstrate the utility of combining the VCGs, IGs and polarimetry\nusing GALFA HI and Planck polarimetry data. We also provide an example of\nsynergy of the VCGs and the SIGs using the HI4PI full-sky HI survey together\nwith the Planck synchrotron intensity data.\n", "  We have found the possible region of parameters of the minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model (MSSM) within the bounds from the experimental results of the\nHiggs mass, the rare decay mode of $b$-quark, the muon $g-2$, the dark matter\nabundance, and the direct searches for the lighter stop (i.e., one of the\nsupersymmetric partners of top quark) at the LHC. We present numerical results\nof calculations for the one loop effects of supersymmetric particles in the\nprocesses of $\\tau^+ \\tau^-$, $b \\overline{b}$, $t \\overline{t}$, and $Z h$\nproduction at the ILC by using benchmark points within the possible region of\nthe MSSM parameters.\n", "  The Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol BB84 has been proven secure\nagainst several important types of attacks: the collective attacks and the\njoint attacks. Here we analyze the security of a modified BB84 protocol, for\nwhich information is sent only in the z basis while testing is done in both the\nz and the x bases, against collective attacks. The proof follows the framework\nof a previous paper (Boyer, Gelles, and Mor, 2009), but it avoids the classical\ninformation-theoretical analysis that caused problems with composability. We\nshow that this modified BB84 protocol is as secure against collective attacks\nas the original BB84 protocol, and that it requires more bits for testing.\n", "  Statistical plasma theory far from thermal equilibrium is subject to\nLiouville's equation which is at the base of the BBGKY hierarchical approach to\nplasma kinetic theory from which in the absence of collisions Vlasov's equation\nfollows. It is also at the base of Klimontovich's approach which includes\nsingle particle effects like spontaneous emission. All these theories have been\napplied to plasmas with admirable success even though they suffer from a\nfundamental omission in their use of the electrodynamic equations in the\ndescription of the highly dynamic interactions in many-particle particle\nconglomerations. In the following we extend this theory to taking into account\nthat the interaction between particles separated from each other at a distance\nrequires the transport of information. Action needs to be transported and thus\nin the spirit of the direct-interaction theory as developed by Wheeler and\nFeynman (1945) requires time. This is done by reference to the retarded\npotentials. We derive the fundamental Liouville equation for the phase space\ndensity of a system composed of a very large number of charged particles.\nApplying the approach of Klimontovich (1967) we obtain the retarded time\nevolution equation of the one-particle distribution function in plasmas which\nreplaces Klimontovich's equation in cases when the direct-interaction effects\nhave to be taken into account. This becomes important in all systems where the\ndistance between two points $|\\Delta \\vec{q} | \\sim ct$ is comparable to the\nproduct of observation time and light velocity, which is typical in cosmic\nphysics and astrophysics.\n", "  We apply The Tractor image modeling code to improve upon existing multi-band\nphotometry for the Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (SERVS).\nSERVS consists of post-cryogenic Spitzer observations at 3.6 and 4.5 micron\nover five well-studied deep fields spanning 18 square degrees. In concert with\ndata from ground-based near-infrared (NIR) and optical surveys, SERVS aims to\nprovide a census of the properties of massive galaxies out to z ~ 5. To\naccomplish this, we are using The Tractor to perform \"forced photometry.\" This\ntechnique employs prior measurements of source positions and surface brightness\nprofiles from a high-resolution fiducial band from the VISTA Deep Extragalactic\nObservations (VIDEO) survey to model and fit the fluxes at lower-resolution\nbands. We discuss our implementation of The Tractor over a square degree test\nregion within the XMM-LSS field with deep imaging in 12 NIR/optical bands. Our\nnew multi-band source catalogs offer a number of advantages over traditional\nposition-matched catalogs, including 1) consistent source cross-identification\nbetween bands, 2) de-blending of sources that are clearly resolved in the\nfiducial band but blended in the lower-resolution SERVS data, 3) a higher\nsource detection fraction in each band, 4) a larger number of candidate\ngalaxies in the redshift range 5 < z < 6, and 5) a statistically significant\nimprovement in the photometric redshift accuracy as evidenced by the\nsignificant decrease in the fraction of outliers compared to spectroscopic\nredshifts. Thus, forced photometry using The Tractor offers a means of\nimproving the accuracy of multi-band extragalactic surveys designed for galaxy\nevolution studies. We will extend our application of this technique to the full\nSERVS footprint in the future.\n", "  SPIDERS (SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources) is an SDSS-IV\nsurvey running in parallel to the eBOSS cosmology project. SPIDERS will obtain\noptical spectroscopy for large numbers of X-ray-selected AGN and galaxy cluster\nmembers detected in wide area eROSITA, XMM-Newton and ROSAT surveys. We\ndescribe the methods used to choose spectroscopic targets for two\nsub-programmes of SPIDERS: X-ray selected AGN candidates detected in the ROSAT\nAll Sky and the XMM-Newton Slew surveys. We have exploited a Bayesian\ncross-matching algorithm, guided by priors based on mid-IR colour-magnitude\ninformation from the WISE survey, to select the most probable optical\ncounterpart to each X-ray detection. We empirically demonstrate the high\nfidelity of our counterpart selection method using a reference sample of bright\nwell-localised X-ray sources collated from XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift-XRT\nserendipitous catalogues, and also by examining blank-sky locations. We\ndescribe the down-selection steps which resulted in the final set of\nSPIDERS-AGN targets put forward for spectroscopy within the eBOSS/TDSS/SPIDERS\nsurvey, and present catalogues of these targets. We also present catalogues of\n~12000 ROSAT and ~1500 XMM-Newton Slew survey sources which have existing\noptical spectroscopy from SDSS-DR12, including the results of our visual\ninspections. On completion of the SPIDERS program, we expect to have collected\nhomogeneous spectroscopic redshift information over a footprint of ~7500\ndeg$^2$ for >85 percent of the ROSAT and XMM-Newton Slew survey sources having\noptical counterparts in the magnitude range 17<r<22.5, producing a large and\nhighly complete sample of bright X-ray-selected AGN suitable for statistical\nstudies of AGN evolution and clustering.\n", "  Silicon carbide (SiC) is a wide band gap semiconductor with a variety of\nindustrial applications. Among its many useful properties is its high thermal\nconductivity, which makes it advantageous for thermal management applications.\nIn this paper we present \\textit{ab initio} calculations of the in-plane and\ncross-plane thermal conductivities, $\\kappa_{\\text{in}}$ and\n$\\kappa_{\\text{out}}$, of three common hexagonal polytypes of SiC: 2H, 4H and\n6H. The phonon Boltzmann transport equation is solved iteratively using as\ninput interatomic force constants determined from density functional theory.\nBoth $\\kappa_{\\text{in}}$ and $\\kappa_{\\text{out}}$ decrease with increasing\n$n$ in $n$H SiC because of additional low-lying optic phonon branches. These\noptic branches are characterized by low phonon group velocities, and they\nincrease the phase space for phonon-phonon scattering of acoustic modes. Also,\nfor all $n$, $\\kappa_{\\text{in}}$ is found to be larger than\n$\\kappa_{\\text{out}}$ in the temperature range considered. At electron\nconcentrations present in experimental samples, scattering of phonons by\nelectrons is shown to be negligible except well below room temperature where it\ncan lead to a significant reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity. This\nwork highlights the power of \\textit{ab initio} approaches in giving\nquantitative, predictive descriptions of thermal transport in materials. It\nhelps explain the qualitative disagreement that exists among different sets of\nmeasured thermal conductivity data and provides information of the relative\nquality of samples from which measured data was obtained.\n", "  The probability of finding a spherical cavity or \"hole\" of arbitrarily large\nsize in typical disordered many-particle systems in the infinite-size limit\n(e.g., equilibrium liquid states) is non-zero. Such \"hole\" statistics are\nintimately linked to the physical properties of the system. Disordered\n\"stealthy' many-particle configurations in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ are exotic amorphous states of matter that lie between a liquid\nand crystal that prohibit single-scattering events for a range of wave vectors\nand possess no Bragg peaks [Torquato et al., Phys. Rev. X, 2015, 5, 021020]. In\nthis paper, we provide strong numerical evidence that disordered stealthy\nconfigurations across the first three space dimensions cannot tolerate\narbitrarily large holes in the infinite-system-size limit, i.e., the hole\nprobability has compact support. This structural \"rigidity\" property apparently\nendows disordered stealthy systems with novel thermodynamic and physical\nproperties, including desirable band-gap, optical and transport\ncharacteristics. We also determine the maximum hole size that any stealthy\nsystem can possess across the first three space dimensions.\n", "  A measurement of ionization yields in noble-gas liquids is relevant to the\nenergy calibration of nuclear recoil detectors for dark matter search and\ncoherent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments. In this work we further study\nthe ionization yield of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar, using a two-phase\ndetector with an electroluminescence gap and DD neutron generator. The\nionization yields of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar were measured at 233 keV and\nelectric fields of 0.56 and 0.62 kV/cm; their values amounted to 5.9 $\\pm$ 0.8\nand 7.4 $\\pm$ 1 e$^-$/keV, respectively. The characteristic dependences of the\nionization yield on energy and electric field were determined, while comparing\nthe results obtained to those at lower energies and higher fields.\n", "  Motivated by the question of exploring the \"theory space\" of quantum field\ntheories, we review the concept of \"decomposing\" and \"gluing\" quantum field\ntheories. We explain this in the context of three-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupersymmetric domain walls inside four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories,\nwhere the latter arise from the 6d $(2,0)$ theory compactified on Riemann\nsurfaces. We find that $S^3$ partition functions of the three-dimensional\ntheories can be interpreted as partition functions of a three-dimensional\ntopological quantum field theory.\n", "  We review how the (quantum) cluster algebra naturally emerges in the study of\nfour-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories.\n", "  In this work we report ab initio calculations for the $H_2^+$ molecule\ninteracting with ultrashort intense laser pulses. We analyse several\nobservables that can, in principle, be available experimentally, in order to\nget a deeper understanding of the strong field molecular dynamics. In\nparticular, we will focus our attention to the interplay between electronic and\nnuclear dynamics and how the two motions are correlated.\n  We have extended the Resolvent Technique to molecules and we have extracted\nthe correlated energy spectra in different regimes of ionization: from the\nperturbative regime to the tunneling ionization regime. We have applied this\nnew method, called resolvent operator method (ROM), to a 1+1D model of the\n$H_2^+$ molecule. We have applied this method to several photoionization\nregimes and we have compared with previous results in the literature. We show\nthat the correlated spectra can provide us much more information than the\nintegrated spectra on the electron or nuclear energy. We report the correlated\nenergy spectrum from the multiphoton ionization to the tunneling ionization\nregime and how the sharing of the excess energy is different for the two\nregimes.\n  We have also applied the ROM to a 3D model of the $H_2^+$ molecule in which\nangular distributions can be obtained. With these angular correlated spectra we\nshow that the contributions of electrons coming from absorption of different\nnumber of photons can be disentangled.\n  We have calculated the high harmonic spectra for a 3D model of the $H_2^+$\nmolecule and its isotopes. In these calculations we have observed that for\nsufficiently long pulses and for light molecules we observe even harmonic\ngeneration, a phenomenon that is not expected in a centrosymmetric molecule.\n", "  We consider two qubit teleportation via quantum channel affected by amplitude\ndamping noise. Addressing the same problem, X. Hu, Y. Gu, Q. Gong and G. Guo\n[Phys. Rev. A 81, 054302, (2010)] recently showed that in presence of noise,\nsubjecting more qubits in quantum channel to amplitude damping can increase the\nfidelity of teleportation protocol. However, in this paper, by making some\nadjustments on quantum channel, we obtain teleportation fidelity which is even\nhigher than one in the case of X. Hu et al. Moreover, our strategy is simpler\nthan quantum distillation and compared to using weak measurement, it is\ndeterministic. Furthermore, explicit analysis of fidelity is provided, we show\nthat in general, choosing appropriate quantum channel enhances the ability of\nteleportation better and negates the fact that more amplitude damping noise\nmore quality.\n", "  The measurement of $R_D$ ($R_{D^*}$), the ratio of the branching fraction of\n$\\overline{B} \\to D \\tau \\bar{\\nu}_\\tau (\\overline{B} \\to D^* \\tau\n\\bar{\\nu}_\\tau)$ to that of $\\overline{B} \\to D l \\bar{\\nu}_l (\\overline{B} \\to\nD^* l \\bar{\\nu}_l)$, shows $1.9 \\sigma$ $(3.3 \\sigma)$ deviation from its\nStandard Model (SM) prediction. The combined deviation is at the level of $4\n\\sigma$ according to the Heavy Flavour Averaging Group (HFAG). We perform an\neffective field theory analysis (at the dimension 6 level) of these potential\nNew Physics (NP) signals assuming $ SU(3)_{C} \\times SU(2)_{L} \\times U(1)_{Y}$\ngauge invariance. We first show that, in general, $R_D$ and $R_{D^*}$ are\ntheoretically independent observables and hence, their theoretical predictions\nare not correlated. We identify the operators that can explain the experimental\nmeasurements of $R_D$ and $R_{D^*}$ individually and also together. Motivated\nby the recent measurement of the $\\tau$ polarisation in $\\overline{B} \\to D^*\n\\tau \\bar{\\nu}_\\tau$ decay, $P_\\tau^{D^*}$ by the {\\sc Belle} collaboration, we\nstudy the impact of a more precise measurement of $P_\\tau^{D^*}$ (and a\nmeasurement of $P_\\tau^D$) on the various possible NP explanations.\nFurthermore, we show that the measurement of $R_{D^*}$ in bins of $q^2$, the\nsquare of the invariant mass of the lepton neutrino system, along with the\ninformation on $\\tau$ polarisation, can completely distinguish the various\noperator structures.\n", "  We advocate a low-cost strategy for long-duration research into the\n'milligravity' environment of asteroids, comets and small moons, where surface\ngravity is a vector field typically less than 1/1000 the gravity of Earth.\nUnlike the microgravity environment of space, there is a directionality that\ngives rise, over time, to strangely familiar geologic textures and landforms.\nIn addition to advancing planetary science, and furthering technologies for\nhazardous asteroid mitigation and in-situ resource utilization, simplified\naccess to long-duration milligravity offers significant potential for advancing\nhuman spaceflight, biomedicine and manufacturing. We show that a commodity 3U\n($10\\times10\\times34$ cm$^3$) cubesat containing a laboratory of loose\nmaterials can be spun to 1 rpm = $2\\pi/60$ s$^{-1}$ on its long axis, creating\na centrifugal force equivalent to the surface gravity of a kilometer-sized\nasteroid. We describe the first flight demonstration, where small meteorite\nfragments will pile up to create a patch of real regolith under realistic\nasteroid conditions, paving the way for subsequent missions where landing and\nmobility technology can be flight-proven in the operational environment, in\nLow-Earth Orbit (LEO). The 3U design can be adapted for use onboard the\nInternational Space Station (ISS) to allow for variable gravity experiments\nunder ambient temperature and pressure for a broader range of experiments.\n", "  It is shown that in the previous calculations of $K^0_{S}$ regeneration the\nnoncoupled equations of motion have been considered instead of coupled one. We\npresent the calculations based on the exact solution of coupled equations of\nmotion and perturbation theory. The results differ radically from the previous\nones.\n", "  We show that if a Lagrangian is invariant under a transformation (with the\ninvariance defined in the standard manner), then the equations of motion\nobtained from it maintain their form under the transformation. We also show\nthat the converse is not true, giving examples of equations of motion that are\nform-invariant under a transformation, but these equations can be derived from\na Lagrangian that is not invariant under such transformation. The conclusions\nare valid for discrete or continuous systems.\n", "  From the energy-momentum tensors of the electromagnetic field and the\nmechanical energy-momentum, the equations of energy conservation and balance of\nelectromagnetic and mechanical forces are obtained. The equation for the\nAbraham force in a dielectric medium with losses is obtained\n", "  Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows to probe matter at atomic scale by\nmeasuring the perturbation of a nanomechanical oscillator induced by near-field\ninteraction forces. The quest to improve sensitivity and resolution of AFM has\nforced the introduction of a new class of resonators with dimensions well below\nthe micrometer scale. In this context, nanotube resonators are the ultimate\nmechanical oscillators because of their one dimensional nature, small mass and\nalmost perfect crystallinity, coupled to the possibility of functionalisation,\nthese properties make them the perfect candidates as ultra sensitive, on-demand\nforce sensors. However their tiny dimensions make the measurement of the\nmechanical properties a very challenging task in particular when working in\ncavity free geometry at ambient temperature. By using a highly focused electron\nbeam, we show that the mechanical response of nanotubes can be quantitatively\nmeasured while approaching to a surface sample. By coupling electron beam\ndetection of individual nanotubes with a custom AFM we can image the surface\ntopography of a sample by measuring in real time the mechanical properties of\nthe nanoresonators. The combination of very small size and mass together with\nthe high resolution of the electron beam detection method offers unprecedented\nopportunities for the development of a new class of Atomic Force Nanoscope\n(AFN).\n", "  An important class of contextuality arguments in quantum foundations are the\nAll-versus-Nothing (AvN) proofs, generalising a construction originally due to\nMermin. We present a general formulation of All-versus-Nothing arguments, and a\ncomplete characterisation of all such arguments which arise from stabiliser\nstates. We show that every AvN argument for an n-qubit stabiliser state can be\nreduced to an AvN proof for a three-qubit state which is local\nClifford-equivalent to the tripartite GHZ state. This is achieved through a\ncombinatorial characterisation of AvN arguments, the AvN triple Theorem, whose\nproof makes use of the theory of graph states. This result enables the\ndevelopment of a computational method to generate all the AvN arguments in\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ on n-qubit stabiliser states. We also present new insights into\nthe stabiliser formalism and its connections with logic.\n", "  It is well known that the addition of noise in a multistable system can\ninduce random transitions between stable states. The rate of transition can be\ncharacterised in terms of the noise-free system's dynamics and the added noise:\nfor potential systems in the presence of asymptotically low noise the\nwell-known Kramers' escape time gives an expression for the mean escape time.\nThis paper examines some general properties and examples of transitions between\nlocal steady and oscillatory attractors within networks: the transition rates\nat each node may be affected by the dynamics at other nodes. We use first\npassage time theory to explain some properties of scalings noted in the\nliterature for an idealised model of initiation of epileptic seizures in small\nsystems of coupled bistable systems with both steady and oscillatory\nattractors. We focus on the case of sequential escapes where a steady attractor\nis only marginally stable but all nodes start in this state. As the nodes\nescape to the oscillatory regime, we assume that the transitions back are very\ninfrequent in comparison. We quantify and characterise the resulting sequences\nof noise-induced escapes. For weak enough coupling we show that a master\nequation approach gives a good quantitative understanding of sequential\nescapes, but for strong coupling this description breaks down.\n", "  If new physics (e.g. SUSY) does not show up as direct evidence at the LHC, it\ncould still be observable in FCNC processes involving the $t$-quark. We take a\nclose look at the process $t\\to c + h/Z$ and show that its branching ratio in\nthe Standard Model is subject to three mechanisms of suppression. To obtain an\nobservable signal, one needs to evade all these mechanisms in a theory beyond\nthe Standard Model. We show that a theory like the cMSSM cannot provide a big\nenough enhancement. However, in a framework like $R$-parity-violating SUSY,\nobservable signals are a distinct possibility.\n", "  We study the reactions of the low ionosphere during tropical depressions\n(TDs) which have been detected before the hurricane appearances in the Atlantic\nOcean. We explore 41 TD events using very low frequency (VLF) radio signals\nemitted by NAA transmitter located in the USA and recorded by VLF receiver\nlocated in Belgrade (Serbia). We found VLF signal deviations (caused\nionospheric turbulence) in the case of 36 out of 41 TD events (88%).\nAdditionally, we explore 27 TDs which have not been developed in hurricanes and\nfound similar low ionospheric reactions. However, in the sample of 41 TDs which\nare followed by hurricanes the typical low ionosphere perturbations seem to be\nmore frequent than other TDs.\n", "  We present a flexible ultra-thin conformal patch antenna array operating in\nthe Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band (2.4-2.4835 GHz) for\nwireless sensor nodes. The antenna was designed on a flexible polyimide film\n(Kapton HN) substrate with the size of 95180.1 mm3 and the number of 7\nradiating elements. The antenna exhibits S11 < -10 dB at the band of interest\nwith broadband behavior. The measured gain is 4.72 dB in vertical polarization\nat 2.48 GHz. To obtain the maximum gain of the array, distances of the elements\nin the array are optimized by using the genetic algorithm (GA) in conjunction\nwith the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA). The VSWR is less than 2\nover 2.408-2.555 GHz, frequency band. The method of moment (MOM) based on the\nelectric field integral equation (EFIE) is applied to analyze the radiation\ncharacteristics of the proposed antenna. The resulting matrix equation obtained\nby the discretization of the EFIE is solved iteratively using the MLFMA. The\nradiation patterns and return loss obtained from numerical analysis and\nsimulations show a good impedance matching and a gain enhancement of the\nproposed antenna.\n", "  In this work, the Quasi-Random Lattice (QRL) model is summarized and\ncritically discussed, in order to outline its potentialities and limitations,\nin perspective of future developments. QRL primarily focuses on the mean\nactivity coefficient of ionic solutions, the model having first been developed\nin order to provide practical equations, able to involve a minimal number of\nunknown or unpredictable quantities. QRL at present depends on one adjustable\nparameter (at given pressure and temperature), experimentally known for many\ncommon salts either symmetric or asymmetric, and corresponding to a\nwell-defined concentration, which also sets the upper limit of applicability of\nthe model. For aqueous electrolytes, the concentration-parameter ranges from 1\nM to 8 M (about). In the following it will be seen that, although belonging to\nthe class of simplified approaches, QRL can provide very interesting results\nsince its simple parametrisation is more significant, from a theoretical point\nof view, than so far recognized. A general overview of the QRL theory will\nfirst be presented. Then, some preliminary results will be discussed, in\nparticular concerned with volumetric and thermal properties of electrolyte\nsolutions.\n", "  Many reduced order models are neither robust with respect to the parameter\nchanges nor cost-effective enough for handling the nonlinear dependence of\ncomplex dynamical systems. In this study, we put forth a robust machine\nlearning framework for projection based reduced order modeling of such\nnonlinear and nonstationary systems. As a demonstration, we focus on a\nnonlinear advection-diffusion system given by the viscous Burgers equation,\nwhich is a prototype setting of more realistic fluid dynamics applications with\nthe same quadratic nonlinearity. In our proposed methodology the effects of\ntruncated modes are modeled using a singe layer feed-forward neural network\narchitecture. The neural network architecture is trained by utilizing both the\nBayesian regularization and extreme learning machine approaches, where the\nlatter one is found to be computationally more efficient. A particular effort\nis devoted to the selection of basis functions considering the proper\northogonal decomposition and Fourier bases. It is shown that the proposed\nmodels yield significant improvements in the accuracy over the standard\nGalerkin projection models with a negligibly small computational overhead and\nprovide reliable predictions with respect to the parameter changes.\n", "  The Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is a cornerstone of Molecular Dynamics (MD)\nsimulations and among the most widely used computational kernels in science.\nThe potential models atomistic attraction and repulsion with century old\nprescribed parameters ($q=6, \\; p=12$, respectively), originally related by a\nfactor of two for simplicity of calculations. We re-examine the value of the\nrepulsion exponent through data driven uncertainty quantification. We perform\nHierarchical Bayesian inference on MD simulations of argon using experimental\ndata of the radial distribution function (RDF) for a range of thermodynamic\nconditions, as well as dimer interaction energies from quantum mechanics\nsimulations. The experimental data suggest a repulsion exponent ($p \\approx\n6.5$), in contrast to the quantum simulations data that support values closer\nto the original ($p=12$) exponent. Most notably, we find that predictions of\nRDF, diffusion coefficient and density of argon are more accurate and robust in\nproducing the correct argon phase around its triple point, when using the\nvalues inferred from experimental data over those from quantum mechanics\nsimulations. The present results suggest the need for data driven recalibration\nof the LJ potential across MD simulations.\n", "  Ro-vibrational Stark-associated phenomena of small polyatomic molecules are\nmodelled using extensive spectroscopic data generated as part of the ExoMol\nproject. The external field Hamiltonian is built from the computed\nro-vibrational line list of the molecule in question. The Hamiltonian we\npropose is general and suitable for any polar molecule in the presence of an\nelectric field. By exploiting precomputed data, the often prohibitively\nexpensive computations associated with high accuracy simulations of\nmolecule-field interactions are avoided. Applications to strong terahertz\nfield-induced ro-vibrational dynamics of PH$_3$ and NH$_3$, and spontaneous\nemission data for optoelectrical Sisyphus cooling of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$Cl are\ndiscussed.\n", "  This study investigates short-crested wave breaking over a planar beach by\nusing the mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model, GPUSPH. The\nshort-crested waves are created by generating intersecting wave trains in a\nnumerical wave basin. We examine the influence of beach slope, incident wave\nheight, and incident wave angle on the generated short-crested waves.\nShort-crested wave breaking over a steeper beach generates stronger rip\ncurrents, and larger circulation cells in front of the beach. Intersecting wave\ntrains with a larger incident wave height drive a more complicated\nshort-crested wave field including isolated breakers and wave amplitude\ndiffraction. Nearshore circulation induced by short-crested wave breaking is\ngreatly influenced by the incident wave angle (or the rip current spacing).\nThere is no secondary circulation cell between the nodal line and the antinodal\nline if the rip current spacing is narrow. However, there are multiple\nsecondary circulation cells observed when the rip current spacing is relatively\nlarge.\n", "  We performed a series of 3D N-body simulations where the initial conditions\nwere chosen to get two sets of models; unbarred and barred ones. In this work,\nwe analyze the growth of spirals and bar structures using 1D, and 2D Fourier\nTransforms FT methods. Spectrograms and diagrams of the amplitude of the\nFourier coefficients as a function of time, radius and pitch angle show that\nthe general morphology, of our modeled galaxies, is due to the superposition of\nstructures which have different values of pitch angle and number of arms. Also,\nwe made in barred models a geometric classification of orbits from the bar\nreference frame showing that the barred potential and the Lagrangian points\n$L_4$ and $L_5$ catch approximately one-third of the total disk mass.\n", "  In this paper, we shall consider an infinite-derivative theory of gravity,\nwith a view to making it renormalisable. First, we derive the modified\nsuperficial degree of divergence. Next, we establish that the theory is\ninvariant under BRS (Becchi-Rouet-Stora) transformations. Consequently, we show\nthat the corresponding Slavnov identities hold for the theory. Finally, we\nsummarise our results and discuss renormalisability.\n", "  A Stark decelerator is an effective tool for controlling motional degrees of\nfreedom of polar molecules. Due to technical limitations, many of the current\nStark decelerators focus on molecules in low-field-seeking quantum states and\nare built based on a fixed electrode size and spacing (type-A architecture).\nHere, we present an alternative method based on a different architecture,\nso-called type-B, with microstructured electrodes and a simpler electric field\npulse timing with the prospect of producing cold, quasi-CW molecular beams. We\ndemonstrate with simulations the feasibility of this method and show that a 2\ncm decelerator consisting of 100 stages can bring molecules from 200 m/s to a\nnear standstill in about 150 microseconds. Subsequently, the molecules can be\nreaccelerated to 200 m/s in a phase-stable manner. Our simulations focus on the\nlongitudinal transmission leaving the problem of a transverse confinement for a\nfuture study. This work points to a possible way of integrating polar molecule\naccelerators with solid-state electronics.\n", "  We present a new family of solutions for the Jackiw-Teitelboim model of\ntwo-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Here, a metric\nof constant Ricci scalar curvature is constructed, and explicit linearly\nindependent solutions of the corresponding dilaton field equations are\ndetermined. The metric is transformed to a black hole metric, and the dilaton\nsolutions are expressed in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. Using these\nsolutions we compute, for example, Killing vectors for the metric.\n", "  In this document, the technical details of the JSNS$^2$ (J-PARC Sterile\nNeutrino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source) experiment are described.\n  The search for sterile neutrinos is currently one of the hottest topics in\nneutrino physics. The JSNS$^2$ experiment aims to search for the existence of\nneutrino oscillations with $\\Delta m^2$ near 1 eV$^2$ at the J-PARC Materials\nand Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF). A 1 MW beam of 3 GeV protons\nincident on a spallation neutron target produces an intense neutrino beam from\nmuon decay at rest. Neutrinos come predominantly from $\\mu^+$ decay: $\\mu^{+}\n\\to e^{+} + \\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu} + \\nu_{e}$. The experiment will search for\n$\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}$ to $\\bar{\\nu}_{e}$ oscillations which are detected by the\ninverse beta decay interaction $\\bar{\\nu}_{e} + p \\to e^{+} + n$, followed by\ngammas from neutron capture on Gd. The detector has a fiducial volume of 17\ntons and is located 24 meters away from the mercury target. JSNS$^2$ offers the\nultimate direct test of the LSND anomaly.\n  In addition to the sterile neutrino search, the physics program includes\ncross section measurements with neutrinos with a few 10's of MeV from muon\ndecay at rest and with monochromatic 236 MeV neutrinos from kaon decay at rest.\nThese cross sections are relevant for our understanding of supernova explosions\nand nuclear physics.\n", "  We convert a GeV laser-plasma electron accelerator into a compact\nfemtosecond-pulsed $\\gamma$-ray source by inserting a $100 \\mu$m-thick glass\nplate $\\sim3$ cm after the accelerator exit. With near-unity reliability, and\nrequiring only crude alignment, this glass plasma mirror retro-reflected spent\ndrive laser pulses (photon energy $\\hbar\\omega_L = 1.17$ eV) with $>50\\%$\nefficiency back onto trailing electrons (peak Lorentz factor $1000 < \\gamma_e <\n4400$), creating an optical undulator that generated $\\sim10^8 \\gamma$-ray\nphotons with sub-mrad divergence, estimated peak brilliance $\\sim10^{21}$\nphotons/s/mm$^2$/mrad$^2$/$0.1\\%$ bandwidth and negligible bremsstrahlung\nbackground. The $\\gamma$-ray photon energy $E_\\gamma = 4\\gamma_e^2\n\\hbar\\omega_L$, inferred from the measured $\\gamma_e$ on each shot, peaked from\n5 to 85 MeV, spanning a range otherwise available with comparable brilliance\nonly from large-scale GeV-linac-based high-intensity $\\gamma$-ray sources.\n", "  We demonstrate that nonlinearity may play a constructive role in supporting\nBloch oscillations in a model which is discrete, in one dimension and\ncontinuous in the orthogonal one. The model can be experimentally realized in\nseveral fields of physics such as optics and Bose-Einstein condensates. We\ndemonstrate that designing an optimal relation between the nonlinearity and the\nlinear gradient strength provides extremely long-lived Bloch oscillations with\nlittle degradation. Such robust oscillations can be observed for a broad range\nof parameters and even for moderate nonlinearities and large enough values of\nlinear potential. We also present an approximate analytical description of the\nwave packet's evolution featuring a hybrid Bloch oscillating wave-soliton\nbehavior that excellently corresponds to the direct numerical simulations.\n", "  Detecting defection and alarming partners about the possible danger could be\nessential to avoid being exploited. This act, however, may require a huge\nindividual effort from those who take this job, hence such a strategy seems to\nbe unfavorable. But structured populations can provide an opportunity where a\nlargely unselfish excluder strategy can form an effective alliance with other\ncooperative strategies, hence they can sweep out defection. Interestingly, this\nalliance is functioning even at the extremely high cost of exclusion where the\nsole application of an exclusion strategy would be harmful otherwise. These\nresults may explain why the emergence of extreme selfless behavior is not\nnecessarily against individual selection but could be the result of an\nevolutionary process.\n", "  Biochemical networks play a crucial role in biological systems, implementing\na broad range of vital functions. They normally operate at low copy numbers and\nin spatial settings, but this is often ignored and well-stirred conditions are\nassumed. Yet, it is increasingly becoming clear that even microscopic spatial\ninhomogeneities oftentimes can induce significant differences on the\nmacroscopic level. Since experimental observation of single-molecule behavior\nis extremely challenging, theoretical modeling of biochemical reactions on the\nsingle-particle level is an important tool for understanding spatial effects in\nbiochemical systems. While purely analytical models quickly become intractable\nhere, spatial-stochastic simulations can capture a wide range of biochemical\nprocesses with the necessary levels of detail. Here we discuss different\ntechniques for spatial-stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems, and\nexplain important precautions required to make them biochemically accurate and\nefficient. We illustrate non-negligible accuracy issues arising even in the\nmost simple approaches to biochemical simulation, and present methods to deal\nwith them. We first explain how Brownian Dynamics, a widely used particle-based\ndiffusion simulation technique with fixed propagation time, can be adapted to\nincorporate chemical reactions, and portray a range of schemes that elaborate\non this idea. We then introduce event-driven spatial-stochastic simulation\nmethods, in which system updates are performed asynchronously with\nsituation-dependent, varying time steps; here we particularly focus on eGFRD, a\ncomputationally efficient particle-based algorithm that makes use of analytical\nfunctions to accurately sample interparticle reactions and diffusive motion\nwith large jumps in time and space. We end by briefly presenting recent\ndevelopments in the field of spatial-stochastic biochemical simulation.\n", "  We explore the effects coming from the nested structures on propagation of\nradial light rays going through them in the simple self-similar configuration\ncontaining pairs of voids and overdense regions. Each pair can be described\nwith the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric and is composed of interior dust ball and\nexterior Schwarzschild region. A relation between the redshift and amount of\nnested pairs is studied numerically in order to answer a question whether a\nstrong relativistic effect can be obtained when every component of the\nstructure can be described by the weak field approximation of general\nrelativity.\n", "  Recent experiments on mixed liquid crystals have highlighted the hugely\nsignificant role of ferromagnetic nanoparticle impurities in defining the\nnematic-smectic-A phase transition point. Structured around a Flory-Huggins\nfree energy of isotropic mixing and Landau-de Gennes free energy, this article\npresents a phenomenological mean-field model that quantifies the role of such\nimpurities in analyzing thermodynamic phases, in a mixture of thermotropic\nsmectic liquid crystal and ferromagnetic nanoparticles. First we discuss the\nimpact of ferromagnetic nanoparticles on the isotropic-ferronematic and\nferronematic-ferrosmectic phase transitions and their transition temperatures.\nThis is followed by analysis of various topologies in the phase diagrams. Our\nmodel results indicate that there exists a critical concentration of\nnanoparticle impurities for which the second order N-SmA transition becomes\nfirst order at a tricritical point. Calculations based on this model show\nremarkable agreement with experiment.\n", "  We have carried out a series of helium atom scattering measurements in order\nto characterise the adsorption properties of hydrogen on antimony(111).\nMolecular hydrogen does not adsorb at temperatures above 110 K in contrast to\npre-dissociated atomic hydrogen. Depending on the substrate temperature, two\ndifferent adlayer phases of atomic hydrogen on Sb(111) occur. At low substrate\ntemperatures ($110~$K), the deposited hydrogen layer does not show any ordering\nwhile we observe a perfectly ordered $(1\\times 1)$ H/Sb(111) structure for\ndeposition at room temperature. Furthermore, the amorphous hydrogen layer\ndeposited at low temperature forms an ordered overlayer upon heating the\ncrystal to room temperature. Hydrogen starts to desorb at $T_m = 430~$K which\ncorresponds to a desorption energy of $E_{des}=(1.33\\pm0.06)~$eV. Using\nmeasurements of the helium reflectivity during hydrogen exposure at different\nsurface temperatures, we conclude that the initial sticking coefficient of\natomic hydrogen on Sb(111) decreases with increasing surface temperature.\nFurthermore, the scattering cross section for the diffuse scattering of helium\nfrom hydrogen on Sb(111) is determined as $\\Sigma = (12 \\pm 1)~\\mbox{\\AA}^{2}$.\n", "  Starting from a Langevin formulation of a thermally perturbed nonlinear\nelastic model of the ferroelectric smectic-C$^*$ (SmC${*}$) liquid crystals in\nthe presence of an electric field, this article characterizes the hitherto\nunexplored dynamical phase transition from a thermo-electrically forced\nferroelectric SmC${}^{*}$ phase to a chiral nematic liquid crystalline phase\nand vice versa. The theoretical analysis is based on a combination of dynamic\nrenormalization (DRG) and numerical simulation of the emergent model. While the\nDRG architecture predicts a generic transition to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nuniversality class at dynamic equilibrium, in agreement with recent\nexperiments, the numerical simulations of the model show simultaneous existence\nof two phases, one a \"subdiffusive\" (SD) phase characterized by a dynamical\nexponent value of 1, and the other a KPZ phase, characterized by a dynamical\nexponent value of 1.5. The SD phase flows over to the KPZ phase with increased\nexternal forcing, offering a new universality paradigm, hitherto unexplored in\nthe context of ferroelectric liquid crystals.\n", "  Identifying the flavour of neutral $B$ mesons production is one of the most\nimportant components needed in the study of time-dependent $CP$ violation. The\nharsh environment of the Large Hadron Collider makes it particularly hard to\nsucceed in this task. We present an inclusive flavour-tagging algorithm as an\nupgrade of the algorithms currently used by the LHCb experiment. Specifically,\na probabilistic model which efficiently combines information from reconstructed\nvertices and tracks using machine learning is proposed. The algorithm does not\nuse information about underlying physics process. It reduces the dependence on\nthe performance of lower level identification capacities and thus increases the\noverall performance. The proposed inclusive flavour-tagging algorithm is\napplicable to tag the flavour of $B$ mesons in any proton-proton experiment.\n", "  Strongly coupled quantum fluids are found in different forms, including\nultracold Fermi gases or tiny droplets of extremely hot Quark-Gluon Plasma.\nAlthough the systems differ in temperature by many orders of magnitude, they\nexhibit a similar almost inviscid fluid dynamical behavior. In this work, we\nsummarize some of the recent theoretical developments toward better\nunderstanding this property in cold Fermi gases at and near unitarity.\n", "  This work compares several node (and network) criticality measures\nquantifying to which extend each node is critical with respect to the\ncommunication flow between nodes of the network, and introduces a new measure\nbased on the Bag-of-Paths (BoP) framework. Network disconnection simulation\nexperiments show that the new BoP measure outperforms all the other measures on\na sample of Erdos-Renyi and Albert-Barabasi graphs. Furthermore, a faster\n(still O(n^3)), approximate, BoP criticality relying on the Sherman-Morrison\nrank-one update of a matrix is introduced for tackling larger networks. This\napproximate measure shows similar performances as the original, exact, one.\n", "  In this work, a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is used to\nperform a large-eddy simulation (LES) of a subsonic isothermal jet at high\nReynolds number Re D = 10^6 on a fully un-structured mesh. Its radiated\nacoustic field is computed using the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings formulation.\nIn order to assess the accuracy of the DG method, the simulation results are\ncompared to experimental measurements and a reference simulation based on a\nfinite volume method. The comparisons are made on the flow quantities (mean,\nrms and spectra) and pressure far field (rms and spectra).\n", "  We study the inertial migration of finite-size neutrally buoyant spherical\nparticles in dilute and semi-dilute suspensions in laminar square duct flow. We\nperform several direct numerical simulations using an immersed boundary method\nto investigate the effects of the bulk Reynolds number $Re_b$, particle\nReynolds number $Re_p$ and duct to particle size ratio $h/a$ at different solid\nvolume fractions $\\phi$, from very dilute conditions to $20\\%$. We show that\nthe bulk Reynolds number $Re_b$ is the key parameter in inertial migration of\nparticles in dilute suspensions. At low solid volume fraction ($\\phi=0.4\\%$)\nand low bulk Reynolds number $(Re_b= 144)$, particles accumulate at the center\nof the duct walls. As $Re_b$ is increased, the focusing position moves\nprogressively towards the corners of the duct. At higher volume fractions,\n$\\phi=5, 10$ and $20\\%$, and in wider ducts with $Re_b=550$, particles are\nfound to migrate away from the duct core towards the walls. In particular, for\n$\\phi=5$ and $10\\%$, particles accumulate preferentially at the corners. At the\nhighest volume fraction considered, $\\phi=20\\%$, particles sample all the\nvolume of the duct, with a lower concentration at the duct core. The presence\nof particles induces secondary cross-stream motions in the duct cross-section,\nfor all $\\phi$. The intensity of these secondary flows depends strongly on\nparticle rotation rate, on the maximum concentration of particles in focusing\npositions, and on the solid volume fraction. We find that the secondary flow\nintensity increases with the volume fraction up to $\\phi=5\\%$. However, beyond\n$\\phi=5\\%$ excluded volume effects lead to a strong reduction of cross-stream\nvelocities.\n", "  We consider Heisenberg-Euler-type model of nonlinear electrodynamics with two\nparameters. Heisenberg-Euler electrodynamics is a particular case of this\nmodel. Corrections to Coulomb's law at $r\\rightarrow\\infty$ are obtained and\nenergy conditions are studied. The total electrostatic energy of charged\nparticles is finite. The charged black hole solution in the framework of\nnonlinear electrodynamics is investigated. We find the asymptotic of the metric\nand mass functions at $r\\rightarrow\\infty$. Corrections to the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m solution are obtained.\n", "  A dark matter halo model is developed postulating a new state of matter,\nentities which have internal spin-like terms. Their motion in an external\nSchwarzschild metric is discussed. The internal spin motion contributes to the\ncentrifugal force along with the usual orbital angular momentum term and can\nseverely limit the distance of closest approach to the attractor. An\nenergy-momentum tensor associated with an aggregate of them is shown to have\nprimarily pressure-like components. A model of the spiral galaxy halos is\ndeveloped which can match the observed `flat' rotation curves of some galaxies.\nThe halo dark matter `missing mass' results from the pressure term's\ncontribution to the metric tensor. A possible rationale for the presence of the\ncosmological constant is discussed. An addendum to the standard cosmology\npicture allows an estimate of the amount of dark matter; this is in reasonable\nagreement with that observed. It is possible that the adopted representation of\nthe internal spin motion could be replaced by a boson string Lagrangian.\n", "  By drawing an analogy with superfluid 4He vortices we suggest that dark\nmatter may consist of irreducibly small remnants of cosmic strings.\n", "  The precision measurement of the $d\\sigma(e^+e^- \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-\n\\gamma)/d\\sqrt{s}$ cross section with the photon emitted in the initial state\nwith the KLOE detector has been used to measure the running of the QED coupling\nconstant $\\alpha(s)$ in the energy range 0.6 $< \\sqrt{s} <$ 0.975 GeV in the\ntime-like region. We were able to achieve a significance of the hadronic\ncontribution to the running of $\\alpha(s)$ of more than 5$\\sigma$ with a clear\ncontribution of the $\\rho - \\omega$ resonances to the photon propagator. The\nreal and imaginary part of the shift $\\Delta\\alpha$ to the running has been\nestracted and a fit of the real part allowed us to measure the branching\nfraction $BR(\\omega \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-)$ =\n(6.6$\\pm$1.4$_{stat}$$\\pm$1.7$_{syst}$ )$\\cdot$10$^{-5}$.\n", "  We evaluate the performance of four machine learning methods for modeling and\npredicting FCC solute diffusion barriers. More than 200 FCC solute diffusion\nbarriers from previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations served as\nour dataset to train four machine learning methods: linear regression (LR),\ndecision tree (DT), Gaussian kernel ridge regression (GKRR), and artificial\nneural network (ANN). We separately optimize key physical descriptors favored\nby each method to model diffusion barriers. We also assess the ability of each\nmethod to extrapolate when faced with new hosts with limited known data. GKRR\nand ANN were found to perform the best, showing 0.15 eV cross-validation errors\nand predicting impurity diffusion in new hosts to within 0.2 eV when given only\n5 data points from the host. We demonstrate the success of a combined DFT +\ndata mining approach towards solving materials science challenges and predict\nthe diffusion barrier of all available impurities across all FCC hosts.\n", "  HL-LHC federates the efforts and R&D of a large international community\ntowards the ambitious HL- LHC objectives and contributes to establishing the\nEuropean Research Area (ERA) as a focal point of global research cooperation\nand a leader in frontier knowledge and technologies. HL-LHC relies on strong\nparticipation from various partners, in particular from leading US and Japanese\nlaboratories. This participation will be required for the execution of the\nconstruction phase as a global project. In particular, the US LHC Accelerator\nR&D Program (LARP) has developed some of the key technologies for the HL-LHC,\nsuch as the large-aperture niobium-tin ($Nb_{3}Sn) quadrupoles and the crab\ncavities. The proposed governance model is tailored accordingly and should pave\nthe way for the organization of the construction phase.\n", "  In this paper, we have compared two different accretion mechanisms of dark\nmatter particles by a canonical neutron star with $M=1.4~M_{\\odot}$ and\n$R=10~{\\rm km}$, and shown the effects of dark matter heating on the surface\ntemperature of star. We should take into account the Bondi accretion of dark\nmatter by neutron stars rather than the accretion mechanism of Kouvaris (2008)\n\\citep{Kouvaris08}, once the dark matter density is higher than $\\sim3.81~\\rm\nGeV/cm^3$. Based on the Bondi accretion mechanism and heating of dark matter\nannihilation, the surface temperature platform of star can appear at $\\sim\n10^{6.5}$ year and arrive $\\sim 1.12\\times10^5$ K for the dark matter density\nof $3.81~\\rm GeV/cm^3$, which is one order of magnitude higher than the case of\nKouvaris (2008) with dark matter density of $30~\\rm GeV/cm^3$.\n", "  Specific heat and magnetization measurements of the compound\n[Cu2(apyhist)2Cl2](ClO4)2, where apyhist =\n(4-imidazolyl)ethylene-2-amino-1-ethylpyridine), were used to identify a\nmagnetic-field-induced long-range antiferromagnetic ordered phase at low\ntemperatures (T < 0.36 K) and magnetic fields (1.6 T < H < 5.3 T). This system\nconsists of a Schiff base copper(II) complex, containing chloro-bridges between\nadjacent copper ions in a dinuclear arrangement, with an antiferromagnetic\nintradimer interaction |Jintra|/kB = 3.65 K linked by an antiferromagnetic\ncoupling |Jinter|z/kB = 2.7 K. The magnetic-field-induced ordering behavior was\nanalyzed using the mean field approximation and Monte Carlo simulation results.\nThe obtained physical properties of the system are consistent with the\ndescription of the ordered phase as a Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) of\nmagnetic excitations. We present the phase diagram of this compound, which\nshows one of the lowest critical magnetic field among all known members of the\nfamily of BEC quantum magnets.\n", "  The description is presented for the dependence of the indirect exciton\ncondensate density at the ring as a function of the polar angle at zero\ntemperature with the involvement of the processes of formation and\nrecombination of the excitons. In particular, starting from the quasi\none-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a spatially uniform generating\nterm, we derive an exact analytical solution yielding the fragmentation of an\nexciton ring which is probably observed in the experiments.\n"]}
