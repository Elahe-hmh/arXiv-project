The relationship is shown\nto remain valid for a wide family of initial conditions, such as canonical,\nconstrained canonical, multi-canonical and grand canonical distributions, as\nwell as both for classical and quantum systems.\n", "  Within the theory of general relativity gravitational phenomena are usually\nattributed to the curvature of four-dimensional spacetime. In this context we\nare often confronted with the question of how the concept of ordinary physical\nthree-dimensional space fits into this picture. In this work we present a\nsimple and intuitive model of space for both the Schwarzschild spacetime and\nthe de Sitter spacetime in which physical space is defined as a specified set\nof freely moving reference particles. Using a combination of orthonormal basis\nfields and the usual formalism in a coordinate basis we calculate the physical\nvelocity field of these reference particles. Thus we obtain a vivid description\nof space in which space behaves like a river flowing radially toward the\nsingularity in the Schwarzschild spacetime and radially toward infinity in the\nde Sitter spacetime. We also consider the effect of the river of space upon\nlight rays and material particles and show that the river model of space\nprovides an intuitive explanation for the behavior of light and particles at\nand beyond the event horizons associated with these spacetimes.\n", "  Ruprecht 147 is a hitherto unappreciated open cluster that holds great\npromise as a standard in fundamental stellar astrophysics. We have conducted a\nradial velocity survey of astrometric candidates with Lick, Palomar, and MMT\nobservatories and have identified over 100 members, including 5 blue\nstragglers, 11 red giants, and 5 double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s). We\nestimate the cluster metallicity from spectroscopic analysis, using\nSpectroscopy Made Easy (SME), and find it to be [M/H] = +0.07 \\pm 0.03. We have\nobtained deep CFHT/MegaCam g'r'i' photometry and fit Padova isochrones to the\n(g' - i') and 2MASS (J - K) CMDs using the \\tau^2 maximum-likelihood procedure\nof Naylor (2009), and an alternative method using 2D cross-correlations\ndeveloped in this work. We find best fits for isochrones at age t = 2.5 \\pm\n0.25 Gyr, m - M = 7.35 \\pm 0.1, and A_V = 0.25 \\pm 0.05, with additional\nuncertainty from the unresolved binary population and possibility of\ndifferential extinction across this large cluster. The inferred age is heavily\ndependent by our choice of stellar evolution model: fitting Dartmouth and\nPARSEC models yield age parameters of 3 Gyr and 3.25 Gyr respectively. At\napproximately 300 pc and 3 Gyr, Ruprecht 147 is by far the oldest nearby star\ncluster.\n", "  A mechanism of the self-organization in an unbounded two-dimensional (2D)\npoint vortex system is discussed. A kinetic equation for the system with\npositive and negative vortices is derived using the Klimontovich formalism.\nSimilar to the Fokker-Planck collision term, the obtained collision term\nconsists of a diffusion term and a drift term. It is revealed that the\nmechanism for the self-organization in the 2D point vortex system at negative\nabsolute temperature is mainly provided by the drift term. Positive and\nnegative vortices are driven toward opposite directions respectively by the\ndrift term. As a result, well-known, two isolated clumps with positive and\nnegative vortices, respectively, are formed as an equilibrium distribution.\nRegardless of the number of species of the vortices, either single- or\ndouble-sign, it is found that the collision term has following physically good\nproperties: (i) When the system reaches a quasi-stationary state near the\nthermal equilibrium state with negative absolute temperature, the sign of $d\n\\omega / d \\psi$ is expected to be positive, where $\\omega$ is the vorticity\nand $\\psi$ is the stream function. In this case, the diffusion term decreases\nthe mean field energy, while the drift term increases it. As a whole, the total\nmean field energy is conserved. (ii) Similarly, the diffusion term increases\nthe Boltzmann entropy, while the drift term decreases it. As a whole, the total\nentropy production rate is positive or zero ($H$ theorem), which ensures that\nthe system relaxes to the global thermal equilibrium state characterized by the\nzero entropy production.\n", "  We study the non-perturbative stability of the Large Volume Scenario (LVS) of\nIIB string compactifications, by analysing transitions mediated by the\nBrown-Teitelboim (BT) brane nucleations and by Coleman De Luccia tunneling\n(CDL). We find that, as long as the effective field theory description holds,\nthe LVS AdS minima are stable despite being non-supersymmetric. This opens the\npossibility of having a CFT dual. Metastable de Sitter vacua behave differently\ndepending on the uplifting mechanism. We find explicit expressions for the\ndifferent decay rates in terms of exponentials of the volume. Among the\ntransitions of dS to dS those with increasing volume and decreasing vacuum\nenergy are preferred, though dS decays to AdS (big-crunch sinks) have higher\nprobability. However, the probability of transitions via the CDL mechanism to\ndecompactification are exponentially much larger compared to these. The BT\ndecays correspond to flux/D3 brane transitions mediated by the nucleation of\nD5/NS5 branes. We compare our results with previous analysis for KKLT, type\nIIA, and 6D Einstein-Maxwell studies. In particular we find no indication for a\nbubble of nothing decay.\n", "  We consider Higgsino-like dark matter (DM) in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) with additional right-handed neutrino chiral superfields,\nand propose a new non-thermal way of generating the right amount of relic DM\nvia sneutrino late decays. Due to the large DM annihilation cross-section,\ndecays must occur at lower temperatures than the freeze-out temperature $T_d\\ll\nT_{F,\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1}\\sim \\mu/25$, implying a mostly right-handed lightest\nsneutrino with very small Yukawa interactions. In that context, the right\namount of Higgsino-like DM relic density can be accounted for if sneutrinos are\nproduced via thermal freeze-in in the early Universe.\n", "  We study a two fluid system which models the motion of a charged fluid with\nRayleigh friction, and in the presence of an electro-magnetic field satisfying\nMaxwell's equations. We study the well-posdness of the system in both space\ndimensions two and three. Regardless of the size of the initial data, we first\nprove the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem when the space dimension\nis two. However, in space dimension three, we construct global weak-solutions\n\\`a la Leray, and we prove the local well-posedness of Kato-type solutions.\nThese solutions turn out to be global when the initial data are sufficiently\nsmall. Our results extend Giga-Yoshida (1984) ones to the space dimension two,\nand improve them in terms of requiring less regularity on the velocity fields.\n", "  Muttalib--Borodin ensembles are characterised by the pair interaction term in\nthe eigenvalue probability density function being of the form $\\prod_{1 \\le j <\nk \\le N}(\\lambda_k - \\lambda_j) (\\lambda_k^\\theta - \\lambda_j^\\theta)$. We\nstudy the Laguerre and Jacobi versions of this model --- so named by the form\nof the one-body interaction terms --- and show that for $\\theta \\in \\mathbb\nZ^+$ they can be realised as the eigenvalue PDF of certain random matrices with\nGaussian entries. For general $\\theta > 0$, realisations in terms of the\neigenvalue PDF of ensembles involving triangular matrices are given. In the\nLaguerre case this is a recent result due to Cheliotis, although our derivation\nis different. We make use of a generalisation of a double contour integral\nformula for the correlation functions contained in a paper by Adler, van\nMoerbeke and Wang to analyse the global density (which we also analyse by\nstudying characteristic polynomials), and the hard edge scaled correlation\nfunctions. For the global density functional equations for the corresponding\nresolvents are obtained; solving this gives the moments in terms of\nFuss--Catalan numbers (Laguerre case --- a known result) and particular\nbinomial coefficients (Jacobi case). For $\\theta \\in \\mathbb Z^+$ the Laguerre\nand Jacobi cases are closely related to the squared singular values for\nproducts of $\\theta$ standard Gaussian random matrices, and truncations of\nunitary matrices, respectively. At the hard edge the double contour integral\nformulas provide a double contour integral form of the scaled correlation\nkernel obtained by Borodin in terms of Wright's Bessel function.\n", "  We derive a dynamical bound on the propagation of correlations in local\nrandom quantum circuits - lattice spin systems where piecewise quantum\noperations - in space and time - occur with classical probabilities.\nCorrelations are quantified by the Frobenius norm of the commutator of two\npositive operators acting on space-like separated local Hilbert spaces. For\ntimes $t=O(L)$ correlations spread to distances $\\mathcal{D}=t$ growing, at\nbest, diffusively for any distance within that radius with extensively\nsuppressed distance dependent corrections whereas for $t=o(L^2)$ all parts of\nthe system get almost equally correlated with exponentially suppressed distance\ndependent corrections and approach the maximum amount of correlations that may\nbe established asymptotically.\n", "  Purpose: To develop an ESPIRiT-based method to estimate coil sensitivities\nwith image phase as a building block for efficient and robust image\nreconstruction with phase constraints. Theory and Methods: ESPIRiT is a new\nframework for calibration of the coil sensitivities and reconstruction in\nparallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Applying ESPIRiT to a combined set\nof physical and virtual conjugate coils (VCC-ESPIRiT) implicitly exploits\nconjugate symmetry in k-space similar to VCC-GRAPPA. Based on this method, a\nnew post-processing step is proposed for the explicit computation of coil\nsensitivities that include the absolute phase of the image. The accuracy of the\ncomputed maps is directly validated using a test based on projection onto fully\nsampled coil images and also indirectly in phase-constrained parallel-imaging\nreconstructions. Results: The proposed method can estimate accurate\nsensitivities which include low-resolution image phase. In case of\nhigh-frequency phase variations VCC-ESPIRiT yields an additional set of maps\nthat indicates the existence of a high-frequency phase component. Taking this\nadditional set of maps into account can improve the robustness of\nphase-constrained parallel imaging. Conclusion: The extended VCC-ESPIRiT is a\nuseful tool for phase-constrained imaging.\n", "  Biological systems often involve the self-assembly of basic components into\ncomplex and function- ing structures. Artificial systems that mimic such\nprocesses can provide a well-controlled setting to explore the principles\ninvolved and also synthesize useful micromachines. Our experiments show that\nimmotile, but active, components self-assemble into two types of structure that\nexhibit the fundamental forms of motility: translation and rotation.\nSpecifically, micron-scale metallic rods are designed to induce extensile\nsurface flows in the presence of a chemical fuel; these rods interact with each\nother and pair up to form either a swimmer or a rotor. Such pairs can\ntransition reversibly be- tween these two configurations, leading to kinetics\nreminiscent of bacterial run-and-tumble motion.\n", "  We examine the refractive index from the viewpoint of modern first-principles\nmaterials physics. We first argue that the standard formula, $n^2 =\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm r} \\mu_{\\mathrm r}$, is generally in conflict with\nfundamental principles on the microscopic level. Instead, it turns out that an\nallegedly approximate relation, $n^2 = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm r}$, which is\nalready being used for most practical purposes, can be justified theoretically\nat optical wavelengths. More generally, starting from the fundamental,\nLorentz-covariant electromagnetic wave equation in materials as used in plasma\nphysics, we rederive a well-known, three-dimensional form of the wave equation\nin materials and thereby clarify the connection between the covariant\nfundamental response tensor and the various cartesian tensors used to describe\noptical properties. Finally, we prove a general theorem by which the\nfundamental, covariant wave equation can be reformulated concisely in terms of\nthe microscopic dielectric tensor.\n", "  The boundary effects affecting the Hamiltonian for the nanocone with\ncurvatureinduced spin orbit coupling were considered and the corresponding\nelectronic structure was calculated. These boundary effects include the spin\norbit coupling, the electron mass acquisition and the Coulomb interaction.\nDifferent numbers of the pentagonal defects in the tip were considered. The\nGreen function approach into the second order was used for getting more precise\nresults in the case of the spin orbit coupling.\n", "  We study the $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow M^{+}M^{-}(M=\\pi, K)$ processes with\nthe contributions from the two-particle twist-2 and twist-3 distribution\namplitudes of pion and kaon mesons on BHL prescription in the standard\nhard-scattering approach. The results show that the contributions from twist-3\nparts are actually not power suppressed comparing with the leading-twist\ncontributions and the cross sections agree well with the experimental data in\nthe two-photon center-of-mass energy $W>2.8$ GeV. We also predict the cross\nsection ratio $\\sigma_{0}(\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-})/\\sigma_{0}(K^{+}K^{-})$, which is\ncompatible with the experimental data from TPC and Belle.\n", "  We investigate an approach to universal quantum computation based on the\nmodulation of longitudinal qubit-oscillator coupling. We show how to realize a\ncontrolled-phase gate by simultaneously modulating the longitudinal coupling of\ntwo qubits to a common oscillator mode. In contrast to the more familiar\ntransversal qubit-oscillator coupling, the magnitude of the effective\nqubit-qubit interaction does not rely on a small perturbative parameter. As a\nresult, this effective interaction strength can be made large, leading to short\ngate times and high gate fidelities. We moreover show how the gate infidelity\ncan be exponentially suppressed with squeezing and how the entangling gate can\nbe generalized to qubits coupled to separate oscillators. Our proposal can be\nrealized in multiple physical platforms for quantum computing, including\nsuperconducting and spin qubits.\n", "  We analyze the intrinsic flux ratios of various visible--near-infrared\nfilters with respect to 3.5micron for simple and composite stellar populations,\nand their dependence on age, metallicity and star formation history. UV/optical\nlight from stars is reddened and attenuated by dust, where different sightlines\nacross a galaxy suffer varying amounts of extinction. Tamura et al. (2009)\ndeveloped an approximate method to correct for dust extinction on a\npixel-by-pixel basis, dubbed the \"beta_V\" method, by comparing the observed\nflux ratio to an empirical estimate of the intrinsic ratio of visible and\n~3.5micron data. Through extensive modeling, we aim to validate the \"beta_V\"\nmethod for various filters spanning the visible through near-infrared\nwavelength range, for a wide variety of simple and composite stellar\npopulations. Combining Starburst99 and BC03 models, we built spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of simple (SSP) and composite (CSP) stellar populations\nfor various realistic star formation histories (SFHs), while taking metallicity\nevolution into account. We convolve various 0.44--1.65micron filter throughput\ncurves with each model SED to obtain intrinsic flux ratios beta_{lam,0}. When\nunconstrained in redshift, the total allowed range of beta_{V,0} is 0.6--4.7,\nor almost a factor of eight. At known redshifts, and in particular at low\nredshifts (z<0.01), beta_{V,0} is predicted to span a narrow range of 0.6--1.9,\nespecially for early-type galaxies (0.6--0.7), and is consistent with observed\nbeta_V values. The beta_lam method can therefore serve as a first-order dust\ncorrection method for large galaxy surveys that combine JWST (rest-frame\n3.5micron) and HST (rest-frame visible--near-IR) data.\n", "  We study how two fully-featured hydrogenlike atoms harvest entanglement from\nthe electromagnetic field vacuum, even when the atoms are spacelike separated.\nWe compare the electromagnetic case ---qualitatively and quantitatively--- with\nprevious results that used scalar fields and featureless, idealized atomic\nmodels. Our study reveals the new traits that emerge when we relax these\nidealizations, such as anisotropies in entanglement harvesting and the effect\nof exchange of angular momentum. We show that, under certain circumstances,\nrelaxing previous idealizations makes vacuum entanglement harvesting more\nefficient.\n", "  Motivated by experiments with cold atoms, we investigate a mobile impurity\nimmersed in a Fermi sea in three dimensions at zero temperature by means of the\nfunctional renormalization group. We first perform the derivative expansion of\nthe effective action to calculate the ground state energy and Tan's contact\nacross the polaron-molecule transition for several mass imbalances. Next we\nstudy quasiparticle properties of the impurity by using a real-time method\nrecently developed in nuclear physics, which allows one to go beyond the\nderivative expansion. We obtain the spectral function of the polaron, the\neffective mass and quasiparticle weight of attractive and repulsive polarons,\nand clarify how they are affected by mass imbalances.\n", "  We derive a fluctuating lattice Boltzmann method for the diffusion equation.\nThe derivation removes several shortcomings of previous derivations for\nfluctuating lattice Boltzmann methods for hydrodynamic systems. The comparative\nsimplicity of this diffusive system highlights the basic features of this first\nexact derivation of a fluctuating lattice Boltzmann method.\n", "  We present a comprehensive set of elastic and inelastic neutron scattering\nmeasurements on a range of Fe-doped samples of U(Ru$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$)$_2$Si$_2$\nwith 0.01~$\\le~x~\\le$~0.15. All of the samples measured exhibit long-range\nantiferromagnetic order, with the size of the magnetic moment quickly\nincreasing to 0.51~$\\mu_B$ at 2.5\\% doping and continuing to increase\nmonotonically with doping, reaching 0.69~$\\mu_B$ at 15\\% doping. Time-of-flight\nand inelastic triple-axis measurements show the existence of excitations at\n(1~0~0) and (1.4~0~0) in all samples, which are also observed in the parent\ncompound. While the excitations in the 1\\% doping are quantitatively identical\nto the parent material, the gap and width of the excitations change rapidly at\n2.5\\% Fe doping and above. The 1\\% doped sample shows evidence for a separation\nin temperature between the hidden order and antiferromagnetic transitions,\nsuggesting that the antiferromagnetic state emerges at very low Fe dopings. The\ncombined neutron scattering data suggests not only discontinuous changes in the\nmagnetic moment and excitations between the hidden order and antiferromagnetic\nphases, but that these changes continue to evolve up to at least $x$~=~0.15.\n", "  We find that the nonperturbative physics of the standard-model Higgs\nLagrangian provides a dark matter candidate, \"dormant skyrmion in the standard\nmodel\", the same type of the skyrmion, a soliton, as in the hadron physics. It\nis stabilized by another nonperturbative object in the standard model, the\ndynamical gauge boson of the hidden local symmetry, which is also an analogue\nof the rho meson.\n", "  Future neutrino-oscillation experiments are expected to bring definite\nanswers to the questions of neutrino-mass hierarchy and violation of\ncharge-parity symmetry in the lepton sector. To realize this ambitious program\nit is necessary to ensure a significant reduction of uncertainties,\nparticularly those related to neutrino-energy reconstruction. In this paper, we\ndiscuss different sources of systematic uncertainties, paying special attention\nto those arising from nuclear effects and detector response. By analyzing\nnuclear effects we show the importance of developing accurate theoretical\nmodels, capable to provide quantitative description of neutrino cross sections,\ntogether with the relevance of their implementation in Monte Carlo generators\nand extensive testing against lepton-scattering data. We also point out the\nfundamental role of efforts aiming to determine detector responses in test-beam\nexposures.\n", "  The type-II Weyl/Dirac fermions are a generalization of conventional or\ntype-I Weyl/Dirac fermions, whose conic spectrum is tilted such that the Fermi\nsurface becomes lines in two dimensions, and surface in three dimensions rather\nthan discrete points of the conventional Weyl/Dirac fermions. The\nmass-independent renormalization group calculations show that the tilting\nparameter decreases monotonically with respect to the length scale, which leads\nto a transition from two dimensional type-II Weyl/Dirac fermions to the type-I\nones. Because of the non-trivial Fermi surface, a photon gains a finite mass\npartially via the chiral anomaly, leading to the strong screening effect of the\nWeyl/Dirac fermions. Consequently, anisotropic type-II Dirac semimetals become\nstable against the Coulomb interaction. This work provides deep insight into\nthe interplay between the geometry of Fermi surface and the Coulomb\ninteraction.\n", "  This work implements pionless effective field theory with the two-nucleon\nsystem expanded around the unitarity limit at second order perturbation theory.\nThe expansion is found to converge well. All Coulomb effects are treated in\nperturbation theory, including two-photon contributions at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order. After fixing a three-nucleon force to the 3He\nbinding energy at this order, proton-deuteron scattering in the doublet S-wave\nchannel is calculated for moderate center-of-mass momenta.\n", "  We present a new computational approach that addresses the difficulty of\nobtaining the correct interaction between the solar corona and the transition\nregion in response to rapid heating events. In the coupled corona, transition\nregion and chromosphere system, an enhanced downward conductive flux results in\nan upflow (chromospheric evaporation). However, obtaining the correct upflow\ngenerally requires high spatial resolution in order to resolve the transition\nregion. With an unresolved transition region, artificially low coronal\ndensities are obtained because the downward heat flux jumps across the\nunresolved region to the chromosphere, underestimating the upflows. Here, we\ntreat the lower transition region as a discontinuity that responds to changing\ncoronal conditions through the imposition of a jump condition that is derived\nfrom an integrated form of energy conservation. To illustrate and benchmark\nthis approach against a fully resolved one-dimensional model, we present\nfield-aligned simulations of coronal loops in response to a range of impulsive\n(spatially uniform) heating events. We show that our approach leads to a\nsignificant improvement in the coronal density evolution than just when using\ncoarse spatial resolutions insufficient to resolve the lower transition region.\nOur approach compensates for the jumping of the heat flux by imposing a\nvelocity correction that ensures that the energy from the heat flux goes into\ndriving the transition region dynamics, rather than being lost through\nradiation. Hence, it is possible to obtain improved coronal densities. The\nadvantages of using this approach in both one-dimensional hydrodynamic and\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations are discussed.\n", "  The sensitivity of top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider to\nthe presence and nature of an underlying Z' boson is studied, accounting for\nsix-fermion decay with full tree-level Standard Model ttbar interference and\nall intermediate particles allowed off-shell. Focus is placed on the\nlepton-plus-jets final state, emulating experimental conditions, including\nkinematic requirements and top quark pair reconstruction in the presence of\nmissing transverse energy and combinatorial ambiguity in jet-top assignment.\nConsidering a resonance with mass of 4 TeV, and assuming 300 inverse fb of\nproton-proton collisions with a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV data, a\ncombination of forward-backward and top polarisation asymmetries are shown to\ndistinguish Z' embedded by different classes of Grand-Unified-Theory-inspired\nmodels. In combination with the differential cross section, they may be used to\nincrease the significance of the signal when tested against the Standard Model,\nas shown using a likelihood-based statistical test.\n", "  Despite their use as cosmological distance indicators and their importance in\nthe chemical evolution of galaxies, the unequivocal identification of the\nprogenitor systems and explosion mechanism of normal type Ia supernova (SN Ia)\nremains elusive. The leading hypothesis is that such a supernova is a\nthermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, but the exact explosion\nmechanism is still a matter of debate. Observation of a galactic SN Ia would be\nof immense value in answering the many open questions related to these events.\nOne potentially useful source of information about the explosion mechanism and\nprogenitor is the neutrino signal.\n  In this paper we compute the expected neutrino signal from a gravitationally\nconfined detonation (GCD) explosion scenario for a SN~Ia and show how the flux\nat Earth contains features in time and energy unique to this scenario. We then\ncalculate the expected event rates in the Super-K, Hyper-K, JUNO, DUNE, and\nIceCube detectors and find both Hyper-K and IceCube would see a few events for\na GCD supernova at 1 kpc or closer, while Super-K, JUNO, and DUNE would see a\nevents if the supernova were closer than ${\\sim}0.3$ kpc. The distance and\ndetector criteria needed to resolve the time and spectral features arising from\nthe explosion mechanism, neutrino production, and neutrino oscillation\nprocesses are also discussed.\n  The neutrino signal from the GCD is then compared with the signal from a\ndeflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) explosion model computed\npreviously. We find the overall event rate is the most discriminating feature\nbetween the two scenarios followed by the event rate time structure. Using the\nevent rate in the Hyper-K detector alone, the DDT can be distinguished from the\nGCD at 2$\\sigma$ if the distance to the supernova is less than $2.3\\;{\\rm kpc}$\nfor a normal mass ordering and $3.6\\;{\\rm kpc}$ for an inverted ordering.\n", "  This is the second part of a work in which we show how to solve a large class\nof Lindblad master equations for non-interacting particles on $L$ sites. Here\nwe concentrate on fermionic particles. In parallel to part I for bosons, but\nwith important differences, we show how to reduce the problem to diagonalizing\nan $L \\times L$ non-Hermitian matrix which, for boundary dissipative driving of\na uniform chain, is a tridiagonal bordered Toeplitz matrix. In this way, both\nfor fermionic and spin systems alike, we can obtain analytical expressions for\nthe normal master modes and their relaxation rates (rapidities) and we show how\nto construct the non-equilibrium steady state.\n", "  Communication games are collaborative information processing tasks involving\na number of players with limited communication. Such games are useful tools for\nstudying physical theories. A physical theory exhibits preparation\ncontextuality whenever observed behaviour cannot be explained by a preparation\nnoncontextual model. Here we show that there is a fundamental connection\nbetween the performance in communication games and the degree of preparation\n(non)contextuality. For this purpose, we present a general framework that\nallows us to construct communication games such that the game performance\ncorresponds to a measure of preparation (non)contextuality. We illustrate the\npower of this framework by, 1) deriving many examples of tests of preparation\ncontextuality, 2) showing that quantum violations of Bell inequalities can be\nderived from quantum violations of preparation noncontextuality, 3)\nqualitatively and quantitatively explaining related previous results on\npreparation contextuality in quantum communication games, and 4) solving the\nopen problem of revealing the preparation contextuality of the maximally mixed\nquantum state in any dimension.\n", "  We report parity-time (PT) symmetry breaking in electrically injected,\ncoherently coupled, vertical cavity surface emitting laser arrays. We predict\nbeam steering, mode evolution and mode hopping as a consequence of the\nnon-Hermiticity of the array analyzed by temporal coupled mode theory with both\nasymmetric gain distribution and local frequency detuning. We present\nexperimental confirmation of the predicted mode evolution, mode hopping and PT\nsymmetry breaking with quantitative agreement with the theory.\n", "  We evaluate dark matter (DM) limits from cosmic-ray antiproton observations\nusing the recent precise AMS-02 measurements. We properly take into account\ncosmic-ray propagation uncertainties fitting at the same time DM and\npropagation parameters, and marginalizing over the latter. We find a\nsignificant (~4.5 sigma) indication of a DM signal for DM masses near 80 GeV,\nwith a hadronic annihilation cross-section close to the thermal value, sigma v\n~3e-26 cm3s-1. Intriguingly, this signal is compatible with the DM\ninterpretation of the Galactic center gamma-ray excess. Confirmation of the\nsignal will require a more accurate study of the systematic uncertainties,\ni.e., the antiproton production cross-section, and modelling of the solar\nmodulation effect. Interpreting the AMS-02 data in terms of upper limits on\nhadronic DM annihilation, we obtain strong constraints excluding a thermal\nannihilation cross-section for DM masses below about 50 GeV and in the range\nbetween approximately 150 and 500 GeV, even for conservative propagation\nscenarios. Except for the range around 80 GeV, our limits are a factor 4\nstronger than the limits from gamma-ray observations of dwarf galaxies.\n", "  Zhang (2013) proposed a type of GRB-less X-ray transient associated with\ndouble neutron star (NS-NS) mergers under the conjecture of a rapidly-spinning\nmagnetar merger product with the line of sight off the short GRB jet. We\ninvestigate possible light curves of these transients by considering different\nobserver's viewing angles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the\npeak luminosity function (LF) and event rate density of these X-ray transients.\nBy considering that a fraction of massive neutron stars may be supra-massive\nand later collapse into black holes after spinning down, we investigate how the\npredicted LF depends on the equation of state (EoS) of the central object and\nthe geometry of the system. In general, the LF can be fit by two log-normal\ndistributions peaking around $10^{46.4}$ and $10^{49.6}$ $\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$,\ncorresponding to the trapped and free zones, respectively. For the majority of\nthe EoS models, the current non-detection is consistent with having a free zone\nsolid angle at most a few times of the solid angle of the short GRB jet. The\nevent rate density of these X-ray transients is around a few tens of $\\rm\nGpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for luminosity above $10^{45}$ $\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$. We predict\nthat future X-ray telescopes (such as Einstein Probe) with sensitivity $\\sim\n10^{-11}$ $\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}$ would detect as many as several tens of\nsuch transients per year per steradian. Within 200 Mpc, the aLIGO average range\nfor NS-NS mergers, the estimated event rate of these transients is about 1\ntransient per year all sky.\n", "  In the light of the progress in quantum technologies, the task of verifying\nthe correct functioning of processes and obtaining accurate tomographic\ninformation about quantum states becomes increasingly important. Compressed\nsensing, a machinery derived from the theory of signal processing, has emerged\nas a feasible tool to perform robust and significantly more resource-economical\nquantum state tomography for intermediate-sized quantum systems. In this work,\nwe provide a comprehensive analysis of compressed sensing tomography in the\nregime in which tomographically complete data is available with reliable\nstatistics from experimental observations of a multi-mode photonic\narchitecture. Due to the fact that the data is known with high statistical\nsignificance, we are in a position to systematically explore the quality of\nreconstruction depending on the number of employed measurement settings,\nrandomly selected from the complete set of data, and on different model\nassumptions. We present and test a complete prescription to perform efficient\ncompressed sensing and are able to reliably use notions of model selection and\ncross-validation to account for experimental imperfections and finite counting\nstatistics. Thus, we establish compressed sensing as an effective tool for\nquantum state tomography, specifically suited for photonic systems.\n", "  The peculiar velocity field measured by redshift-space distortions (RSD) in\ngalaxy surveys provides a unique probe of the growth of large-scale structure.\nHowever, systematic effects arise when including satellite galaxies in the\nclustering analysis. Since satellite galaxies tend to reside in massive halos\nwith a greater halo bias, the inclusion boosts the clustering power. In\naddition, virial motions of the satellite galaxies cause a significant\nsuppression of the clustering power due to nonlinear RSD effects. We develop a\nnovel method to recover the redshift-space power spectrum of halos from the\nobserved galaxy distribution by minimizing the contamination of satellite\ngalaxies. The cylinder grouping method (CGM) we study effectively excludes\nsatellite galaxies from a galaxy sample. However, we find that this technique\nproduces apparent anisotropies in the reconstructed halo distribution over all\nthe scales which mimic RSD. On small scales, the apparent anisotropic\nclustering is caused by exclusion of halos within the anisotropic cylinder used\nby the CGM. On large scales, the misidentification of different halos in the\nlarge-scale structures, aligned along the line-of-sight, into the same CGM\ngroup, causes the apparent anisotropic clustering via their cross-correlation\nwith the CGM halos. We construct an empirical model for the CGM halo power\nspectrum, which includes correction terms derived using the CGM window function\nat small scales as well as the linear matter power spectrum multiplied by a\nsimple anisotropic function at large scales. We apply this model to a mock\ngalaxy catalog at z=0.5, designed to resemble SDSS-III BOSS CMASS galaxies, and\nfind that our model can predict both the monopole and quadrupole power spectra\nof the host halos up to k<0.5 h/Mpc to within 5%.\n", "  Embedding rigid inclusions into elastic matrix materials is a procedure of\nhigh practical relevance, for instance for the fabrication of elastic composite\nmaterials. We theoretically analyze the following situation. Rigid spherical\ninclusions are enclosed by a homogeneous elastic medium under stick boundary\nconditions. Forces and torques are directly imposed from outside onto the\ninclusions, or are externally induced between them. The inclusions respond to\nthese forces and torques by translations and rotations against the surrounding\nelastic matrix. This leads to elastic matrix deformations, and in turn results\nin mutual long-ranged matrix-mediated interactions between the inclusions.\nAdapting a well-known approach from low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, we\nexplicitly calculate the displacements and rotations of the inclusions from the\nexternally imposed or induced forces and torques. Analytical expressions are\npresented as a function of the inclusion configuration in terms of\ndisplaceability and rotateability matrices. The role of the elastic environment\nis implicitly included in these relations. That is, the resulting expressions\nallow a calculation of the induced displacements and rotations directly from\nthe inclusion configuration, without having to explicitly determine the\ndeformations of the elastic environment. In contrast to the hydrodynamic case,\ncompressibility of the surrounding medium is readily taken into account. We\npresent the complete derivation based on the underlying equations of linear\nelasticity theory. In the future, the method will, for example, be helpful to\ncharacterize the behavior of externally tunable elastic composite materials, to\naccelerate numerical approaches, as well as to improve the quantitative\ninterpretation of microrheological results.\n", "  The orbits of many observed hot Jupiters are decaying rapidly due to tidal\ninteraction, eventually reaching the Roche limit. We analytically study the\nensuing coupled mass loss and orbital evolution during the Roche-lobe overflow\nand find two possible scenarios. Planets with light cores $M_c\\lesssim\n6M_\\oplus$ (assuming a nominal tidal dissipation factor $Q\\sim 10^6$ for the\nhost star) are transformed into Neptune-mass gas planets, orbiting at a\nseparation (relative to the stellar radius) $a/R_\\star\\approx 3.5$. Planets\nwith heavier cores $M_c\\gtrsim 6M_\\oplus$ plunge rapidly until they are\ndestroyed at the stellar surface. Remnant gas-Neptunes, which are stable to\nphoto-evaporation, are absent from the observations, despite their unique\ntransit radius ($5-10R_\\oplus$). This result suggests that $M_c\\gtrsim\n6M_\\oplus$, providing a useful constraint on the poorly-known core mass that\nmay distinguish between different formation theories of gas giants.\nAlternatively, if one assumes a prior of $M_c\\approx 6 M_\\oplus$ from the\ncore-accretion theory, our results suggest that $Q$ does not lie in the range\n$10^6\\lesssim Q\\lesssim 10^7$.\n", "  Singlet $S$-wave superfluidity of dilute neutron matter is studied within the\ncorrelated BCS method, which takes into account both pairing and short-range\ncorrelations. First, the equation of state (EOS) of normal neutron matter is\ncalculated within the Correlated Basis Function (CBF) method in lowest cluster\norder using the ${}^1{S_0}$ and ${}^3P$ components of the Argonne $V_{18}$\npotential, assuming trial Jastrow-type correlation functions. The ${}^1{S_0}$\nsuperfluid gap is then calculated with the corresponding component of the\nArgonne $V_{18}$ potential and the optimally determined correlation functions.\nThe dependence of our results on the chosen forms for the correlation functions\nis studied, and the role of the $P$-wave channel is investigated. Where\ncomparison is meaningful, the values obtained for the ${}^1{S_0}$ gap within\nthis simplified scheme are consistent with the results of similar and more\nelaborate microscopic methods.\n", "  We show that the free Euclidean Dirac equation can preserve the positivity of\nits initial data only in two spacetime dimensions.\n", "  The current-phase relation (CPR) of a Josephson junction (JJ) determines how\nthe supercurrent evolves with the superconducting phase difference across the\njunction. Knowledge of the CPR is essential in order to understand the response\nof a JJ to various external parameters. Despite the rising interest in\nultra-clean encapsulated graphene JJs, the CPR of such junctions remains\nunknown. Here, we use a fully gate-tunable graphene superconducting quantum\nintereference device (SQUID) to determine the CPR of ballistic graphene JJs.\nEach of the two JJs in the SQUID is made with graphene encapsulated in\nhexagonal boron nitride. By independently controlling the critical current of\nthe JJs, we can operate the SQUID either in a symmetric or asymmetric\nconfiguration. The highly asymmetric SQUID allows us to phase-bias one of the\nJJs and thereby directly obtain its CPR. The CPR is found to be skewed,\ndeviating significantly from a sinusoidal form. The skewness can be tuned with\nthe gate voltage and oscillates in anti-phase with Fabry-P\\'{e}rot resistance\noscillations of the ballistic graphene cavity. We compare our experiments with\ntight-binding calculations which include realistic graphene-superconductor\ninterfaces and find a good qualitative agreement.\n", "  This study presents a review of the current state of research on teaching\nquantum mechanics in secondary and lower undergraduate education. A conceptual\napproach to quantum mechanics is being implemented in more and more\nintroductory physics courses around the world. Because of the differences\nbetween the conceptual nature of quantum mechanics and classical physics,\nresearch on misconceptions, testing, and teaching strategies for introductory\nquantum mechanics is needed. For this review, 74 articles were selected and\nanalyzed for the misconceptions, research tools, teaching strategies and\nmultimedia applications investigated. Outcomes were categorized according to\ntheir contribution to the various subtopics of quantum mechanics. Analysis\nshows that students have difficulty relating quantum physics to physical\nreality. It also shows that the teaching of complex quantum behavior, such as\ntime dependence, superposition and the measurement problem, has barely been\ninvestigated for the secondary and lower undergraduate level. At the secondary\nschool level, this review shows a need to investigate student difficulties\nconcerning wave functions and potential wells. Investigation of research tools\nshows the necessity for the development of assessment tools for secondary and\nlower undergraduate education, which cover all major topics and are suitable\nfor statistical analysis. Furthermore, this review shows the existence of very\ndiverse ideas concerning teaching strategies for quantum mechanics and a lack\nof research into which strategies promote understanding. This review underlines\nthe need for more empirical research into student difficulties, teaching\nstrategies, activities and research tools intended for a conceptual approach\nfor quantum mechanics.\n", "  Airbnb, an online marketplace for accommodations, has experienced a\nstaggering growth accompanied by intense debates and scattered regulations\naround the world. Current discourses, however, are largely focused on opinions\nrather than empirical evidences. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting\nthe first large-scale measurement study on Airbnb, using a crawled data set\ncontaining 2.3 million listings, 1.3 million hosts, and 19.3 million reviews.\nWe measure several key characteristics at the heart of the ongoing debate and\nthe sharing economy. Among others, we find that Airbnb has reached a global yet\nheterogeneous coverage. The majority of its listings across many countries are\nentire homes, suggesting that Airbnb is actually more like a rental marketplace\nrather than a spare-room sharing platform. Analysis on star-ratings reveals\nthat there is a bias toward positive ratings, amplified by a bias toward using\npositive words in reviews. The extent of such bias is greater than Yelp\nreviews, which were already shown to exhibit a positive bias. We investigate a\nkey issue---commercial hosts who own multiple listings on Airbnb---repeatedly\ndiscussed in the current debate. We find that their existence is prevalent,\nthey are early-movers towards joining Airbnb, and their listings are\ndisproportionately entire homes and located in the US. Our work advances the\ncurrent understanding of how Airbnb is being used and may serve as an\nindependent and empirical reference to inform the debate.\n", "  Understanding the operation of biological molecular motors, nanoscale\nmachines that transduce electrochemical energy into mechanical work, is\nenhanced by bottom-up strategies to synthesize novel motors.\n", "  The CMS tracker consists of 206 square meters of silicon strip sensors\nassembled on carbon fibre composite structures and is designed for operation in\nthe temperature range from -25 to +25 degrees C. The mechanical stability of\ntracker components during physics operation was monitored with a few micron\nresolution using a dedicated laser alignment system as well as particle tracks\nfrom cosmic rays and hadron-hadron collisions. During the LHC operational\nperiod of 2011-2013 at stable temperatures, the components of the tracker were\nobserved to experience relative movements of less than 30 microns. In addition,\ntemperature variations were found to cause displacements of tracker structures\nof about 2 microns/degree C, which largely revert to their initial positions\nwhen the temperature is restored to its original value.\n", "  Quantum parameter estimation plays a key role in many fields like quantum\ncomputation, communication and metrology. Optimal estimation allows one to\nachieve the most precise parameter estimates, but requires accurate knowledge\nof the model. Any inevitable uncertainty in the model parameters may heavily\ndegrade the quality of the estimate. It is therefore desired to make the\nestimation process robust to such uncertainties. Robust estimation was\npreviously studied for a varying phase, where the goal was to estimate the\nphase at some time in the past, using the measurement results from both before\nand after that time within a fixed time interval up to current time. Here, we\nconsider a robust guaranteed-cost filter yielding robust estimates of a varying\nphase in real time, where the current phase is estimated using only past\nmeasurements. Our filter minimizes the largest (worst-case) variance in the\nallowable range of the uncertain model parameter(s) and this determines its\nguaranteed cost. It outperforms in the worst case the optimal Kalman filter\ndesigned for the model with no uncertainty, that corresponds to the center of\nthe possible range of the uncertain parameter(s). Moreover, unlike the Kalman\nfilter, our filter in the worst case always performs better than the best\nachievable variance for heterodyne measurements, that we consider as the\ntolerable threshold for our system. Furthermore, we consider effective quantum\nefficiency and effective noise power, and show that our filter provides the\nbest results by these measures in the worst case.\n", "  The influence of uniaxial single-ion anisotropy -DSz^2 on the magnetic and\nthermal properties of Heisenberg antiferromagnets (AFMs) is investigated. The\nuniaxial anisotropy is treated exactly and the Heisenberg interactions are\ntreated within unified molecular field theory (MFT) [Phys. Rev. B 91, 064427\n(1915)], where thermodynamic variables are expressed in terms of directly\nmeasurable parameters. The properties of collinear AFMs with ordering along the\nz axis (D > 0) in applied fields Hz = 0 are calculated versus D and temperature\nT. The high-field average magnetization per spin muz(Hz,D,T) is found, and the\ncritical field Hc(D,T) is derived at which the second-order AFM to PM phase\ntransition occurs. The magnetic properties of the spin-flop (SF) phase are\ncalculated, including the zero-field properties TN(D) and mu(D,T). The\nhigh-field muz(Hz,D,T) is determined, together with the associated spin-flop\nfield HSF(D,T) at which a second-order SF to PM phase transition occurs. The\nfree energies of the AFM, SF and PM phases are derived from which Hz-T phase\ndiagrams are constructed. For a certain combination of parameters we find a\ntopologically distinct phase diagram where a spin-flop bubble occurs at finite\nHz and T. Also calculated are properties arising from a perpendicular magnetic\nfield. In addition to the above results for D > 0, some properties with D < 0\nare determined. In order to compare the properties of the above spin systems\nwith those of noninteracting systems with DSz^2 uniaxial anisotropy with either\nsign of D, an Appendix is included in which results for the thermal and\nmagnetic properties of such noninteracting spin systems are provided.\n", "  We extend Dain's construction of a geometric invariant characterising static\ninitial data sets for the vacuum Einstein field equations to situations with a\nnon-vanishing extrinsic curvature. This invariant gives a measure of how much\nthe initial data sets deviates from stationarity. In particular, it vanishes if\nand only if the initial data set is stationary. Thus, the invariant provides a\nquantification of the amount of gravitational radiation contained in the\ninitial data set.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to investigate the non-relativistic limit of\nintegrable quantum field theories with fermionic fields, such as the O(N)\nGross-Neveu model, the supersymmetric Sinh-Gordon and non-linear sigma models.\nThe non-relativistic limit of these theories is implemented by a double scaling\nlimit which consists of sending the speed of light c to infinity and rescaling\nat the same time the relevant coupling constant of the model in such a way to\nhave finite energy excitations. For the general purpose of mapping the space of\ncontinuous non-relativistic integrable models, this paper completes and\nintegrates the analysis done in Ref.[1] on the non-relativistic limit of purely\nbosonic theories.\n", "  We explore the field-temperature phase diagram of the XY pyrochlore\nantiferromagnet Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, by means of magnetization and neutron\ndiffraction experiments. Depending on the field strength and direction relative\nto the high symmetry cubic directions $[001], [1\\bar{1}0]$ and $[111]$, the\nrefined field induced magnetic structures are derived from the zero field\n$\\psi_2$ and $\\psi_3$ states of the $\\Gamma_5$ irreducible representation which\ndescribes the ground state of XY pyrochlore antiferromagnets. At low field,\ndomain selection effects are systematically at play. In addition, for $[001]$,\na phase transition is reported towards a $\\psi_3$ structure at a characteristic\nfield $H_c^{001}=$ 43 mT. For $[1\\bar{1}0]$ and $[111]$, the spins are\ncontinuously tilted by the field from the $\\psi_2$ state, and no phase\ntransition is found while domain selection gives rise to sharp anomalies in the\nfield dependence of the Bragg peaks intensity. For $[1\\bar{1}0]$, these results\nare confirmed by high resolution inelastic neutron scattering experiments,\nwhich in addition allow us to determine the field dependence of the spin gap.\nThis study agrees qualitatively with the scenario proposed theoretically by\nMaryasin {\\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 93}, 100406(R) (2016)], yet the\nstrength of the field induced anisotropies is significantly different from\ntheory.\n", "  A search for single production of vector-like quarks, T and B, decaying into\na Z boson and a top or a bottom quark, respectively, is presented. The search\nis performed using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. An exotic T quark production mode through\nthe decay of a heavy Z' resonance is also considered. The search is performed\nin events with a Z boson decaying leptonically, accompanied by a bottom or a\ntop quark decaying hadronically. No excess of events is observed over the\nstandard model background expectation. Products of production cross section and\nbranching fraction for T and B quarks from 1.26 and 0.13 pb are excluded at 95%\nconfidence level for the range of resonance mass considered, which is between\n0.7 and 1.7 TeV. Limits on the product of the Z' boson production cross section\nand branching fraction, with the Z' boson decaying to the Tt final state, are\nset between 0.31 and 0.13 pb, for Z' boson masses in the range from 1.5 to 2.5\nTeV. This is the first search at 13 TeV for single production of vector-like\nquarks in events with a Z boson decaying leptonically accompanied by boosted\njets.\n", "  The Principle of Maximal Conformality (PMC) provides a rigorous method for\neliminating renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities for perturbative QCD\npredictions. The PMC uses the renormalization group equation to fix the\n$\\beta$-pattern of each order in an arbitrary pQCD approximant, and it then\ndetermines the optimal renormalization scale by absorbing all $\\{\\beta_{i}\\}$\nterms into the running coupling at each order. The resulting coefficients of\nthe pQCD series match the scheme-independent conformal series with $\\beta=0$.\nAs in QED, different renormalization scales appear at each order; we call this\nthe multi-scale approach. In this paper, we present a novel single-scale\napproach for the PMC, in which a single effective scale is constructed to\neliminate all non-conformal $\\beta$-terms up to a given order simultaneously.\nThe PMC single-scale approach inherits the main features of the multi-scale\napproach; for example, its predictions are scheme-independent, and the pQCD\nconvergence is greatly improved due to the elimination of divergent renormalon\nterms. As an application of the single-scale approach, we investigate the\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation cross-section ratio $R_{e^+e^-}$ and the Higgs\ndecay-width $\\Gamma(H \\to b \\bar{b})$, including four-loop QCD contributions.\nThe resulting predictions are nearly identical to the multi-scale predictions\nfor both the total and differential contributions. Thus in many cases, the PMC\nsingle-scale approach PMC-s, which requires a simpler analysis, could be\nadopted as a reliable substitution for the PMC multi-scale approach for setting\nthe renormalization scale for high-energy processes, particularly when one does\nnot need detailed information at each order. The elimination of the\nrenormalization scale uncertainty increases the precision of tests of the\nStandard Model at the LHC.\n", "  The swimming direction of biological or artificial microscale swimmers tends\nto be randomised over long time-scales by thermal fluctuations. Bacteria use\nvarious strategies to bias swimming behaviour and achieve directed motion\nagainst a flow, maintain alignment with gravity or travel up a chemical\ngradient. Herein, we explore a purely geometric means of biasing the motion of\nartificial nanorod swimmers. These artificial swimmers are bimetallic rods,\npowered by a chemical fuel, which swim on a substrate printed with\nteardrop-shaped posts. The artificial swimmers are hydrodynamically attracted\nto the posts, swimming alongside the post perimeter for long times before\nleaving. The rods experience a higher rate of departure from the higher\ncurvature end of the teardrop shape, thereby introducing a bias into their\nmotion. This bias increases with swimming speed and can be translated into a\nmacroscopic directional motion over long times by using arrays of\nteardrop-shaped posts aligned along a single direction. This method provides a\nprotocol for concentrating swimmers, sorting swimmers according to different\nspeeds, and could enable artificial swimmers to transport cargo to desired\nlocations.\n", "  We determine experimentally the spinor interaction constants of\nlower-polaritons $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ using resonant pump-probe\nspectroscopy with a spectrally narrow pump pulse. Our experimental findings are\nanalyzed with the Bogoliubov-like theory and mean-field two channel model based\non the lower-polariton and biexciton basis. We find an enhancement of the\nattractive interaction and dissipative nonlinearity of lower-polaritons with\nanti-parallel spins in the vicinity of the biexciton resonance when the energy\nof two lower-polaritons approaches energetically that of the biexciton. These\nobservations are consistent with the existence of a scattering resonance\nbetween lower-polaritons and biexcitons (polaritonic Feshbach resonance).\n", "  HIPSR (HI-Pulsar) is a digital signal processing system for the Parkes 21-cm\nMultibeam Receiver that provides larger instantaneous bandwidth, increased\ndynamic range, and more signal processing power than the previous systems in\nuse at Parkes. The additional computational capacity enables finer spectral\nresolution in wideband HI observations and real-time detection of Fast Radio\nBursts during pulsar surveys. HIPSR uses a heterogeneous architecture,\nconsisting of FPGA-based signal processing boards connected via high-speed\nEthernet to high performance compute nodes. Low-level signal processing is\nconducted on the FPGA-based boards, and more complex signal processing routines\nare conducted on the GPU-based compute nodes. The development of HIPSR was\ndriven by two main science goals: to provide large bandwidth, high-resolution\nspectra suitable for 21-cm stacking and intensity mapping experiments; and to\nupgrade the Berkeley-Parkes-Swinburne Recorder (BPSR), the signal processing\nsystem used for the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) Survey and the Survey\nfor Pulsars and Extragalactic Radio Bursts (SUPERB).\n", "  Second-order phase transitions are characterized by a divergence of the\nspatial correlation length of the order parameter fluctuations. For confined\nsystems, this is known to lead to remarkable equilibrium physical phenomena,\nincluding finite-size effects and critical Casimir forces. We explore here some\nnon-equilibrium aspects of these effects in the stationary state resulting from\nthe action of external forces: by analyzing a model of a correlated fluid under\nshear, spatially confined by two parallel plates, we study the resulting\nviscosity within the setting of (Gaussian) Landau-Ginzburg theory.\nSpecifically, we introduce a model in which the hydrodynamic velocity field\n(obeying the Stokes equation) is coupled to an order parameter with dissipative\ndynamics. The well-known Green-Kubo relation for bulk systems is generalized\nfor confined systems. This is shown to result in a non-local Stokes equation\nfor the fluid flow, due to the correlated fluctuations. The resulting effective\nshear viscosity shows universal as well as non-universal contributions, which\nwe study in detail. In particular, the deviation from the bulk behavior is\nuniversal, depending on the ratio of the correlation length and the film\nthickness $L$. In addition, at the critical point the viscosity is proportional\nto $\\ell/L$, where $\\ell$ is a dynamic length scale. These findings are\nexpected to be experimentally observable, especially for systems where the bulk\nviscosity is affected by critical fluctuations.\n", "  The assembly of banana-shaped rodlike proteins on membranes, and the\nassociated membrane shape transformations, are investigated by analytical\ntheory and coarse-grained simulations. The membrane-mediated interactions\nbetween two banana-shaped inclusions are derived theoretically using a\npoint-like formalism based on fixed anisotropic curvatures, both for zero\nsurface tension and for finite surface tension. On a larger scale, the\ninteractions between assemblies of such rodlike inclusions are determined\nanalytically. Meshless membrane simulations are performed in the presence of a\nlarge number of inclusions of two types, corresponding to curved rods of\nopposite curvatures, both for flat membranes and vesicles. Rods of the same\ntype aggregate into linear assemblies perpendicular to the rod axis, leading to\nmembrane tubulation. However, rods of the other type, those of opposite\ncurvature, are attracted to the lateral sides of these assemblies, and\nstabilize a straight bump structure that prevents tubulation. When the two\ntypes of rods have almost opposite curvatures, the bumps attract one another,\nforming a stripe structure. Positive surface tension is found to stabilize the\nstripe formation. The simulation results agree well with the theoretical\npredictions provided the point-like curvatures of the model are scaled-down to\naccount for the effective flexibility of the simulated rods.\n", "  Recent 60Fe results have suggested that the estimated distances of supernovae\nin the last few million years should be reduced from 100 pc to 50 pc. Two\nevents or series of events are suggested, one about 2.7 million years to 1.7\nmillion years ago, and another may at 6.5 to 8.7 million years ago. We ask what\neffects such supernovae are expected to have on the terrestrial atmosphere and\nbiota. Assuming that the Local Bubble was formed before the event being\nconsidered, and that the supernova and the Earth were both inside a weak,\ndisordered magnetic field at that time, TeV-PeV cosmic rays at Earth will\nincrease by a factor of a few hundred. Tropospheric ionization will increase\nproportionately, and the overall muon radiation load on terrestrial organisms\nwill increase by a factor of 150. All return to pre-burst levels within 10kyr.\nIn the case of an ordered magnetic field, effects depend strongly on the field\norientation. The upper bound in this case is with a largely coherent field\naligned along the line of sight to the supernova, in which case TeV-PeV cosmic\nray flux increases are 10^4; in the case of a transverse field they are below\ncurrent levels. We suggest a substantial increase in the extended effects of\nsupernovae on Earth and in the lethal distance estimate; more work is\nneeded.This paper is an explicit followup to Thomas et al. (2016). We also here\nprovide more detail on the computational procedures used in both works.\n", "  A multiscale approach based on the phase-field model is developed to simulate\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous formation of {\\theta}' precipitates during high\ntemperature ageing in Al-Cu alloys. The model parameters that determine the\ndifferent energy contributions (chemical free energy, interfacial energy,\nlattice parameters, elastic constants) were obtained from either computational\nthermodynamics databases or from first-principles density functional theory and\nmolecular statics simulations. From the information, the evolution and\nequilibrium morphology of the {\\theta}' precipitates is simulated in 3D using\nthe phase-field model. The model was able to reproduce the evolution of the\ndifferent orientation variants of plate-like shaped {\\theta}' precipitates with\norientation relationship (001){\\theta}'//(001){\\alpha} and\n[100]{\\theta}'//[100]{\\alpha} during homogeneous nucleation as well as the\nheterogeneous nucleation on dislocations, leading to the formation of\nprecipitate arrays. Heterogeneous nucleation on pre-existing dislocation(s) was\ntriggered by the interaction energy between the dislocation stress field and\nthe stress-free transformation strain associated to the nucleation of the\n{\\theta}' precipitates. Moreover, the mechanisms controlling the evolution of\nthe morphology and the equilibrium aspect ratio of the precipitates were\nascertained. All the predictions of the multiscale model were in good agreement\nwith experimental data.\n", "  Type II supergravity admits an AdS(3) x S(2) x S(2) x T(3) solution with\nfluxes depending on several free parameters. We determine the constraints on\nthese parameters imposed by the requirement of (classical) integrability of the\nsuperstring sigma model. To do this we analyze the low-energy effective action\nfor the spinning GKP string. The absence of particle production in the\ntree-level S-matrix of bosonic excitations is shown to imply the vanishing of\ntwo of the four parameters in the NSNS three-form flux. This reduces the\nsupergravity background to either the one-parameter AdS(3) x S(2) x S(2) x T(3)\nbackground preserving eight supersymmetries, or a non-supersymmetric branch,\nwhich differs only by flipping a sign in the RR flux. We show that both these\nbranches can be obtained from AdS(3) x S(3) x S(3) x S(1) by T-dualities on the\n(Hopf) circle fibers of the three-spheres and therefore the integrability of\nthe string in these backgrounds follows.\n", "  Complex and exotic nuclear geometries are expected to appear naturally in\ndense nuclear matter found in the crust of neutron stars and supernovae\nenvironment collectively referred to as nuclear pasta. The pasta geometries\ndepend on the average baryon density, proton fraction and temperature and are\ncritically important in the determination of many transport properties of\nmatter in supernovae and the crust of neutron stars. Using a set of\nself-consistent microscopic nuclear energy density functionals we present the\nfirst results of large scale quantum simulations of pasta phases at baryon\ndensities $0.03 \\leq \\rho \\leq 0.10$ fm$^{-3}$, proton fractions $0.05 \\leq Y_p\n\\leq 0.40$, and zero temperature. The full quantum simulations, in particular,\nallow us to thoroughly investigate the role and impact of the nuclear symmetry\nenergy on pasta configurations. We use the Sky3D code that solves the Skyrme\nHartree-Fock equations on a three-dimensional Cartesian grid. For the nuclear\ninteraction we use the state of the art UNEDF1 parametrization, which was\nintroduced to study largely deformed nuclei, hence is suitable for studies of\nthe nuclear pasta. Density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is\nsimulated by tuning two purely isovector observables that are insensitive to\nthe current available experimental data. We find that a minimum total number of\nnucleons $A=2000$ is necessary to prevent the results from containing spurious\nshell effects and to minimize finite size effects. We find that a variety of\nnuclear pasta geometries are present in the neutron star crust and the result\nstrongly depends on the nuclear symmetry energy. The impact of the nuclear\nsymmetry energy is less pronounced as the proton fractions increase. Quantum\nnuclear pasta calculations at $T=0$ MeV are shown to get easily trapped in\nmeta-stable states, and possible remedies to avoid meta-stable solutions are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Motivated by the new theoretical paradigm that views spacetime geometry as\nemerging from the entanglement of a pre-geometric theory, we investigate the\nissue of the signature of the presence of horizons and localized matter on the\nentanglement entropy (EE) S_E for the case of three-dimensional AdS (AdS_3)\ngravity. We use the holographically dual two-dimensional CFT on the torus and\nthe related modular symmetry in order to treat bulk black holes and conical\nsingularities (sourced by pointlike masses not shielded by horizons) on the\nsame footing. In the regime where boundary tori can be approximated by\ncylinders we are able to give universal expressions for the EE of black holes\nand conical singularities. We argue that the presence of horizons/localized\nmatter in the bulk is encoded in the EE in terms of (i) enhancement/reduction\nof the entanglement of the AdS_3 vacuum, (ii) scaling as area/volume of the\nleading term of the perturbative expansion of S_E, (iii) exponential/periodic\nbehaviour of S_E, (iv) presence of unaccessible regions in the\nnoncompact/compact dimension of the boundary cylinder. In particular, we show\nthat the reduction effect of matter on the entanglement of the vacuum found by\nVerlinde for the de Sitter vacuum extends to the AdS_3 vacuum\n", "  Universal properties of entangled many-body states are controlled by their\nsymmetry and quantum fluctuations. By magnetic-field tuning of the spin-orbital\ndegeneracy in a Kondo-correlated quantum dot, we have modified quantum\nfluctuations to directly measure their influence on the many-body properties\nalong the crossover from $SU(4)$ to $SU(2)$ symmetry of the ground state.\nHigh-sensitive current noise measurements combined with the non-equilibrium\nFermi liquid theory clarify that the Kondo resonance and electron correlations\nare enhanced as the fluctuations, measured by the Wilson ratio, increase along\nthe symmetry crossover. Our achievement demonstrates that non-linear noise\nconstitutes a measure of quantum fluctuations that can be used to tackle\nquantum phase transitions.\n", "  Artificial atomic systems in solids such as single photon emitters are\nbecoming increasingly important building blocks in quantum information\nprocessing and scalable quantum nanophotonic networks. Here, we report on a\ncontrollable way to engineer emitters in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) crystals using plasma processing. The method is robust, and\nyields a 7-fold increase in the density of emitters in hBN, which is promising\nfor their deployment in practical devices. While as-fabricated emitters suffer\nfrom blinking and bleaching, a subsequent annealing step yields photo-stable\nemitters. The presented process is the first step towards controllable\nplacement of quantum emitters in hBN for integrated on-chip quantum\nnanophotonics based on 2D materials.\n", "  The ground state of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a distorted\ntriangular lattice is studied using a numerical-diagonalization method. The\nnetwork of interactions is the $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ type; the interactions\nare continuously controlled between the undistorted triangular lattice and the\ndice lattice. We find new states between the nonmagnetic 120-degree-structured\nstate of the undistorted triangular case and the up-up-down state of the dice\ncase. The intermediate states show spontaneous magnetizations that are smaller\nthan one third of the saturated magntization corresponding to the up-up-down\nstate.\n", "  The dynamics along the particle trajectories for the 3D axisymmetric Euler\nequations are considered. It is shown that if the inflow is rapidly increasing\n(pushy) in time, the corresponding laminar profile of the incompressible Euler\nflow is not (in some sense) stable provided that the swirling component is not\nzero. It is also shown that if the vorticity on the axis is not zero (with some\nextra assumptions), then there is no steady flow. We can rephrase these\ninstability to an instantaneous blow-up. In the proof, Frenet-Serret formulas\nand orthonormal moving frame are essentially used.\n", "  We show that scattering a quantum particle on a one-dimensional potential\nbarrier as well as scattering the electromagnetic wave on a\nquasi-one-dimensional layered structure (both represent scattering problems\nwith one 'source' and two 'sinks') violate the superposition principle; the\nrole of nonlinear elements is played here by the potential barrier and the\nlayered structure, splitting the incident (probability and electromagnetic)\nwave into two parts (transmitted and reflected). This explains why all attempts\nto solve the tunneling time problem within the framework of the standard\n(linear) models of these processes, both in quantum mechanics and in classical\nelectrodynamics, have been unsuccessful. We revise the traditional formulation\nof the superposition principle, present a new (nonlinear) wave model, by the\nexample of the quantum-mechanical scattering process, and show that concepts of\nthe tunneling time developed on its basis are free from the Hartman paradox.\n", "  Fermilab carries out an extensive program of accelerator-based high energy\nparticle physics research at the Intensity Frontier that relies on the\noperation of 8 GeV and 120 GeV proton beamlines for a number of fixed target\nexperiments. Routine operation with a world-record 700kW of average 120 GeV\nbeam power on the neutrino target was achieved in 2017 as the result of the\nProton Improvement Plan (PIP) upgrade. There are plans to further increase the\npower to 900 - 1000 kW. The next major upgrade of the FNAL accelerator complex,\ncalled PIP-II, is under development. It aims at 1.2MW beam power on target at\nthe start of the LBNF/DUNE experiment in the middle of the next decade and\nassumes replacement of the existing 40-years old 400 MeV normal-conducting\nLinac with a modern 800 MeV superconducting RF linear accelerator. There are\nseveral concepts to further double the beam power to >2.4MW after replacement\nof the existing 8 GeV Booster synchrotron. In this article we discuss current\nperformance of the Fermilab proton accelerator complex, the upgrade plans for\nthe next two decades and the accelerator R&D program to address cost and\nperformance risks for these upgrades.\n", "  Quantum Correlations are studied extensively in quantum information domain.\nEntanglement Measures and Quantum Discord are good examples of these actively\nstudied correlations. Detection of violation in Bell inequalities is also a\nwidely active area in quantum information theory world. In this work, we\nrevisit the problem of analyzing the behavior of quantum correlations and\nviolation of Bell inequalities in noisy channels. We extend the problem defined\nin [1] by observing the changes in negativity measure, quantum discord and a\nmodified version of Horodecki measure for violation of Bell inequalities under\namplitude damping, phase damping and depolarizing channels. We report different\ninteresting results for each of these correlations and measures. All these\ncorrelations and measures decrease under decoherence channels, but some changes\nare very dramatical comparing to others. We investigate also separability\nconditions of example studied states.\n", "  Motivated by a host of empirical evidences revealing the bursty character of\nhuman dynamics, we develop a model of human activity based on successive\nswitching between an hesitation state and a decision-realization state, with\nresidency times in the hesitation state distributed according to a heavy-tailed\nPareto distribution. This model is particularly reminiscent of an individual\nstrolling through a randomly distributed human crowd. Using a stochastic model\nbased on the concept of anomalous and non-Markovian L\\'evy walk, we show\nexactly that successive decision-making processes drastically slow down the\nprogression of an individual faced with randomly distributed obstacles.\nSpecifically, we prove exactly that the average displacement exhibits a\nsublinear scaling with time that finds its origins in: (i) the intrinsically\nnon-Markovian character of human activity, and (ii) the power law distribution\nof hesitation times.\n", "  A suitable generalisation of the Lichnerowicz formula can relate the squares\nof supersymmetric operators to the effective action, the Bianchi identities for\nfluxes, and some equations of motion. Recently, such formulae have also been\nshown to underlie the (generalised) geometry of supersymmetric theories. In\nthis paper, we derive an M-theoretic Lichnerowicz formula that describes\neleven-dimensional supergravity together with its higher-derivative couplings.\nThe first corrections to the action appear at eight-derivative level, and the\nconstruction yields two different supersymmetric invariants, each with a free\ncoefficient. We discuss the restriction of our construction to\nseven-dimensional internal spaces, and implications for compactifications on\nmanifolds of $G_2$ holonomy. Inclusion of fluxes and computation of\ncontributions with higher than eight derivatives are also discussed.\n", "  RedGOLD searches for red-sequence galaxy overdensities while minimizing\ncontamination from dusty star-forming galaxies. It imposes an NFW profile and\ncalculates cluster detection significance and richness. We optimize these\nlatter two parameters using both simulations and X-ray detected cluster\ncatalogs, and obtain a catalog $\\sim 80\\%$ pure up to $z \\sim 1$, and $\\sim\n100\\%$ ($\\sim 70\\%$) complete at $z\\le 0.6$ ( $z\\lesssim1$) for galaxy clusters\nwith $M \\gtrsim 10^{14}\\ {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ at the CFHT-LS Wide depth. In the\nCFHT-LS W1, we detect 11 cluster candidates per $\\rm deg^2$ out to $z\\sim1.1$.\nWhen we optimize both completeness and purity, RedGOLD obtains a cluster\ncatalog with higher completeness and purity than other public catalogs,\nobtained using CFHT-LS W1 observations, for $M \\gtrsim 10^{14}\\ {\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$. We use X-ray detected cluster samples to extend the study of the\nX-ray temperature-optical richness relation to a lower mass threshold, and find\na mass scatter at fixed richness of $\\sigma_{lnM|\\lambda}=0.39\\pm0.07$ and\n$\\sigma_{lnM|\\lambda}=0.30\\pm0.13$ for the Gozaliasl et al. (2014) and Mehrtens\net al. (2012) samples. When considering similar mass ranges as previous work,\nwe recover a smaller scatter in mass at fixed richness. We recover $93\\%$ of\nthe redMaPPer detections, and find that its richness estimates is on average\n$\\sim 40-50\\%$ larger than ours at $z>0.3$. RedGOLD recovers X-ray cluster\nspectroscopic redshifts at better than $5\\%$ up to $z\\sim1$, and the centers\nwithin a few tens of arcseconds.\n", "  Kloosterman sums play a special role in analytic number theory, for\nexpressing the integer Fourier coefficients of modular forms as an infinite sum\nof Bessel functions, also known as Rademacher formula. The generalization to\nvector-valued modular forms is known as generalized Kloosterman sums. In the\npaper arxiv:1404.0033, a remarkable connection between these arithmetic sums\nand quantum black hole entropy was found. Nevertheless, the computation was\nparticular for one-eighth BPS black holes in $\\mathcal{N}=8$ string theory,\nwhich have a simple counting formula. Here, we review this construction and\nextend it to the case of one-quarter BPS black holes in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ string\ntheory, which are counted by (mock) Jacobi forms of arbitrary index. The main\nresult is an holographic derivation of the Kloosterman sums which includes the\nintricate sum over phases and depends exactly on the spectral flow sectors and\nthe spectrum of polar states. On the microscopic side we derive an analytic\nformula for the Kloosterman sums valid for any index, whereas from the\nmacroscopic side we reproduce the same formula from the M-theory path integral\non $\\mathbb{Z}_c$ orbifolds of $AdS_2\\times S^1$. A key aspect of the\nderivation is the identification of the spectral flow sectors with the\ncontribution of M2 branes wrapping cycles on the compactification manifold.\nAfter a careful treatment of the measure, the sum over orbifolds results in the\nsum over Bessels, in perfect agreement with the Rademacher expansion at any\norder in perturbation theory.\n", "  A correlation between giant-planet mass and atmospheric heavy elemental\nabundance was first noted in the past century from observations of planets in\nour own Solar System, and has served as a cornerstone of planet formation\ntheory. Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5\nmicrons, we conducted a detailed atmospheric study of the transiting\nNeptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b. We detected prominent H2O absorption bands\nwith a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525ppm in the transmission spectrum.\nUsing the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b's\natmospheric heavy element content [4.8 (-4.0 +21.5) times solar]. This likely\nindicates that HAT-P-26b's atmosphere is primordial and obtained its gaseous\nenvelope late in its disk lifetime, with little contamination from metal-rich\nplanetesimals.\n", "  New Massive Gravity is an alternative theory to General Relativity that is\nused to describe the gravitational field in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime.\nBlack hole solutions have been found in this theory, in particular an\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter rotating black hole. We analyse some features of\nthis solution as its event horizon, black hole area and distance to the\nhorizon, specially in the rotating extreme case, showing that they have shared\nfeatures with extreme black holes in 4-dimensional General relativity. This\nlimit case is interesting in the search of geometric inequalities as the ones\nfound for the Kerr black hole in (3+1)-General Relativity.\n", "  In contrast to the usual quantum systems which have at most a finite number\nof open spectral gaps if they are periodic in more than one direction, periodic\nquantum graphs may have gaps arbitrarily high in the spectrum. This property of\ngraph Hamiltonians, being generic in a sense, inspires the question about the\nexistence of graphs with a finite and nonzero number of spectral gaps. We show\nthat the answer depends on the vertex couplings together with commensurability\nof the graph edges. A finite and nonzero number of gaps is excluded for graphs\nwith scale invariant couplings; on the other hand, we demonstrate that graphs\nfeaturing a finite nonzero number of gaps do exist, illustrating the claim on\nthe example of a rectangular lattice with a suitably tuned $\\delta$-coupling at\nthe vertices.\n", "  Evolutionary dynamics experienced by mixed microbial populations of\ncooperators and cheaters has been examined in experiments in the literature\nusing a protocol of periodic dilution to investigate the properties of\nresilience and adaptability to environmental changes. Data depicted on an\nappropriate phase diagram indicate, among other features, a stable equilibrium\npoint at which cooperators and cheaters coexist [A. Sanchez, J. Gore, PLOs\nBiology, 11 (4), e1001547 (2013)]. We present here a phenomenological analysis\nof these data focusing on an eco-evolutionary-game perspective. To that end, we\nwork on an extension of the model proposed by Tao and Cressman Y. Tao, R.\nCressman, Bull. Math. Biol. 69, 1377 - 1399 (2007). It's original version takes\ninto account changes of the total population density while the individuals\nexperience pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma game. The extension devised here\ncontains a dilution factor to be conform with the experimental procedure, in\naddition of a term accounting for Allee effects. Differently from other\ndescriptions proposed in similar contexts, however, the model here does not\naccount for assortative encounters, group or kin selection. Nonetheless, it\ndescribes surprisingly well both qualitatively and quantitatively the features\nof the observed phase diagram. We discuss these results in terms of the\nbehavior of an effective payoff matrix defined accordingly.\n", "  We present a detailed path integral derivation of the topological response of\ngapped free fermions, in $2+1$ dimensions, to an external $\\text{U}(1)$ Gauge\nfield. The well-known Hall response is obtained by identifying the Chern-Simons\nterm in the effective action with the correct coefficient. We extend the result\nto $2d+1$ dimensions in which the response is associated to a Chern-Simons term\nwith a coefficient related to a characteristic class coming from topological\nband theory. We comment on the bulk-to-boundary principle which arises\nnaturally when one considers the theory on a manifold with boundary.\n", "  This report is a literature review of significant and successful tests of\ngeneral relativity [GR]. The GR predicted value for the perihelion advance of\nMercury was Deltaf = 43.03 arcsec century^-1 and fit well with observation,\nbeing the first success of GR. The GR result for the bending of light around\nthe Sun dGR = 1.75 arcsec, confirmed by observation, marked the second\nsuccessful validation of GR. Gravitational Redshift [GvR] was first detected\n1925 and is the third successful classical test. The parametrized\npost-Newtonian PPN employs b and g for GR testing. Shapiro delay was also\nconfirmed with g = 1.000021 +/- 0.000023, against GR value g = 1, some consider\nthis to be the fourth classical test. So too gravitational time dilation GvT\nwas experimentally confirmed in 1971, while GvT for GPS is a daily validation\nof GR. Frame-dragging and the Geodetic effect have also been confirmed. The\nstrong equivalence principle SEP has been confirmed to h = 4.4 x 10^-4, to GR h\n= 0. Gravitational slip has been constrained to EG = 0.48 +/- 0.10 at z = 0.32,\nagainst the GR value, EG = 0.30 +/- 0.07. The first gravitational wave\ndetection from GW150914, in 2015, has confirmed a long-awaited phenomenon that\nhas taken GR testing to higher precision. Gravitational lensing has also\nconfirmed GR to better than 1%. GR continues to be tested, eliminating\ncompeting gravity theories.\n", "  We derive the asymptotic behavior of the transition probability density of\nthe Bessel-like diffusions for \"dimension\" $\\rho = 0$.\n", "  Linear transformer drivers (LTD) allow to greatly reduce the size of\npulsed-power drivers while increasing their efficiency and repetition rate.\nHowever, limitations on the capacitors voltage and current exist, mostly driven\nby technological imperatives. As a result, LTD required to be connected in\nseries and in parallel to form a practical pulsed-power generator. The High\nAmperage Driver for Extreme States (HADES) proposed here can generate 250 GW of\npower, i.e. a 1 MA on current with a rise time of 150 ns into a 20nH load. The\nkey feature of the driver is its size. The machine footprint is less than 5m2\nand its height is less than 1.6m. This reduction in footprint, compared to\nother 1 MA LTD based-systems, comes from a compact transmission line geometry\nwhich allow to connect LTDs is series and in parallel efficiently. This paper\nsummarizes this design and describes HADES operation and maintenance.\n", "  Growth of perovskite oxide thin films on Si in crystalline form has long been\na critical obstacle for the integration of multifunctional oxides into Si-based\ntechnologies. In this study, we propose pulsed laser deposition of a\ncrystalline SrTiO3 thin film on a Si using graphene substrate. The SrTiO3 thin\nfilm on graphene has a highly (00l)-oriented crystalline structure which\nresults from the partial epitaxy. Moreover, graphene promotes a sharp interface\nby highly suppressing the chemical intermixing. The important role of graphene\nas a 2D substrate and diffusion barrier allows expansion of device applications\nbased on functional complex oxides.\n", "  We considered a generic case of pre-transitional materials with static\nstress-generating defects, dislocations and coherent nano-precipitates, at\ntemperatures close but above the starting temperature of martensitic\ntransformation, Ms. Using the Phase Field Microelasticity theory and 3D\nsimulation, we demonstrated that the local stress generated by these defects\nproduces equilibrium nano-size martensitic embryos (MEs) in pre-transitional\nstate, these embryos being orientation variants of martensite. This is a new\ntype of equilibrium: the thermoelastic equilibrium between the MEs and parent\nphase in which the total volume of MEs and their size are equilibrium internal\nthermodynamic parameters. This thermoelastic equilibrium exists only in\npresence of the stress-generating defects. Cooling the pre-transitional state\ntowards Ms or applying the external stimuli, stress or magnetic field, results\nin a shift of the thermoelastic equilibrium provided by a reversible\nanhysteretic growth of MEs that results in a giant ME-generated macroscopic\nstrain. In particular, this effect can be associated with the diffuse phase\ntransformations observed in some ferroelectrics above the Curie point. It is\nshown that the ME-generated strain is giant and describes a superelasticity if\nthe applied field is stress. It describes a super magnetostriction if the\nmartensite (or austenite) are ferromagnetic and the applied field is a magnetic\nfield. In general, the material with defects can be a multiferroic with a giant\nmultiferroic response if the parent and martensitic phase have different\nferroic properties. Finally the ME-generated strain may explain or, at least,\ncontribute to the Invar and Elinvar effects that are typically observed in\npre-transitional austenite. The thermoelastic equilibrium and all these effects\nexist only if the interaction between the defects and MEs is infinite-range.\n", "  Transition metal oxides have been extensively studied and utilized as\nefficient catalysts. However, the strongly correlated behavior which often\nresults in intriguing emergent phenomena in these materials has been mostly\noverlooked in understanding the electrochemical activities. Here, we\ndemonstrate a close correlation between the phase transitions and oxygen\nevolution reaction (OER) in a strongly correlated SrRuO3. By systematically\nintroducing Ru-O vacancies into the single-crystalline SrRuO3 epitaxial thin\nfilms, we induced phase transition in crystalline symmetry which resulted in\ncorresponding modification in the electronic structure. The modified electronic\nstructure significantly affect the electrochemical activities, so a 30%\ndecrease in the overpotential for the OER activity was achieved. Our study\nsuggests that a substantial enhancement in the OER activity can be realized\neven within single material systems, by rational design and engineering of\ntheir crystal and electronic structures.\n", "  A wide bandwidth, dual polarized, modified four-square antenna is presented\nas a feed antenna for radio astronomical measurements. A linear array of these\nantennas is used as a line-feed for cylindrical reflectors for Tianlai, a radio\ninterferometer designed for 21~cm intensity mapping. Simulations of the feed\nantenna beam patterns and scattering parameters are compared to experimental\nresults at multiple frequencies across the 650 - 1420 MHz range. Simulations of\nthe beam patterns of the combined feed array/reflector are presented as well.\n", "  We describe a simple manganin foil resistance manometer for uniaxial stress\nmeasurements. The manometer functions at low pressures and over a range of\ntemperatures. In this design no temperature seasoning is necessary, although\nthe manometer must be prestressed to the upper end of the desired pressure\nrange. The prestress pressure cannot be increased arbitrarily; irreversibility\narising from shear stress limits its range. Attempting larger pressures yields\nirreproducible resistance measurements.\n", "  Coupled resonator arrays have been shown to exhibit interesting many- body\nphysics including Mott and Fractional Hall states of photons. One of the main\ndifferences between these photonic quantum simulators and their cold atoms\ncoun- terparts is in the dissipative nature of their photonic excitations. The\nnatural equi- librium state is where there are no photons left in the cavity.\nPumping the system with external drives is therefore necessary to compensate\nfor the losses and realise non-trivial states. The external driving here can\neasily be tuned to be incoherent, coherent or fully quantum, opening the road\nfor exploration of many body regimes beyond the reach of other approaches. In\nthis chapter, we review some of the physics arising in driven dissipative\ncoupled resonator arrays including photon fermionisa- tion, crystallisation, as\nwell as photonic quantum Hall physics out of equilibrium. We start by briefly\ndescribing possible experimental candidates to realise coupled resonator arrays\nalong with the two theoretical models that capture their physics, the\nJaynes-Cummings-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians. A brief review of the\nanalytical and sophisticated numerical methods required to tackle these systems\nis included.\n", "  We study the net-charge fluctuations, $D$-measure variable, in high energy\nheavy-ion collisions in heavy-ion jet interaction generator (HIJING),\nultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) and hadron resonance gas\n(HRG) models for various center-of-mass energies (\\sqsn). The effect of\nkinematic acceptance and resonance decay, in the pseudorapidity acceptance\ninterval ($\\Delta\\eta$) and lower transverse momentum ($p_{T}^{min}$)\nthreshold, on fluctuation measures are discussed. A strong dependence of $D$\nwith the $\\Delta\\eta$ in HIJING and UrQMD models is observed as opposed to\nresults obtained from the HRG model. The dissipation of fluctuation signal is\nestimated by fitting the $D$-measure as a function of the $\\Delta\\eta$. An\nextrapolated function for higher $\\Delta\\eta$ values at lower \\sqsn is\ndifferent from the results obtained from models. Particle species dependence of\n$D$ and the effect of the $p_T^{min}$ selection threshold are discussed in\nHIJING and HRG models. The comparison of $D$, at midrapidity, of net-charge\nfluctuations at various \\sqsn obtained from the models with the data from the\nALICE experiment is discussed. The results from the present work as a function\nof $\\Delta\\eta$ and \\sqsn will provide a baseline for comparison to\nexperimental measurements.\n", "  Interface phonon (IF) modes of c-plane oriented [AlN/GaN]20 and\nAl0.35Ga0.65N/Al0.55Ga0.45N]20 multi quantum well (MQW) structures grown via\nplasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy are reported. The effect of variation in\ndielectric constant of barrier layers to the IF optical phonon modes of well\nlayers periodically arranged in the MQWs investigated.\n", "  Trisoctahedral (TOH) shaped Au nanocrystals (NCs) have emerged as a new class\nof metal nanoparticles (MNP) due to its superior catalystic and SERS activities\ncaused by the presence of high density atomic steps and dangling bonds on their\nhigh index facets. We examine the radiative localized surface plasmon resonance\n(LSPR) modes of an isolated single TOH Au NC using cathodoluminescence (CL),\nwith high resolution spatial information of the local density of optical states\n(LDOS) across the visible spectral range. Further we show pronounced\nenhancement factor in the Raman scattering by performing Raman spectroscopic\nmeasurements on Rhodamine 6G (R6G) covered TOH Au NPs aggregates on a Si\nsubstrate. We believe that the hot spots between two adjacent MNP surfaces\n(nanogaps) can be significantly stronger than single particle LSPRs. Such\nnanogaps hotspots may have crucial role on the substantial SERS enhancement\nobserved in this report. Consequently, the present study indicates that MNPs\naggregates are highly desirable than individual plasmonic nanoparticles for\npossible applications in SERS based biosensing.\n", "  In order to provide a better understanding of rotating universe models, and\nin particular the G\\\"{o}del universe, we discuss the relationship between\ncosmic rotation and perfect inertial dragging. In this connection, the concept\nof \\emph{causal mass} is defined in a cosmological context, and discussed in\nrelation to the cosmic inertial dragging effect. Then, we calculate the mass\ninside the particle horizon of the flat $\\Lambda$CDM-model integrated along the\npast light cone. The calculation shows that the Schwarzschild radius of this\nmass is around three times the radius of the particle horizon. This indicates\nthat there is close to perfect inertial dragging in our universe. Hence, the\ncalculation provides an explanation for the observation that the swinging plane\nof a Foucault pendulum follows the stars.\n", "  We quantify the constraints on the flavour separation between the quarks and\nantiquarks in the proton provided by the recent forward weak gauge boson\nproduction data from the LHCb experiment at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV. Performed\nin the framework of the NNPDF3.1 global analysis, this study highlights the key\nrole that the LHCb W and Z data have in achieving a robust quark flavour\nseparation in the large-x region, including the strange and charm quarks. We\ndemonstrate how the LHCb measurements lead to improved determinations of the\nthe up and down quark PDFs in the region $x\\ge 0.1$, with an uncertainty\nreduction that can be as large as a factor 2. We also show how the LHCb forward\nmeasurements severely restrict the size of the fitted charm PDF at large x,\nimposing stringent constraints on non-perturbative models for the charm content\nof the nucleon.\n", "  We have theoretically demonstrated the emission of circularly-polarized\nterahertz (THz) waves from intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) which is\nlocally heated by an external heat source such as the laser irradiation. We\nfocus on a mesa-structured IJJ whose geometry is slightly deviate from a square\nand find that the local heating make it possible to emit circularly-polarized\nTHz waves. In this mesa, the inhomogeneity of critical current density induced\nby the local heating excites the electromagnetic cavity modes TM (1,0) and TM\n(0,1), whose polarizations are orthogonal to each other. The mixture of these\nmodes results in the generation of circularly-polarized THz waves. We also show\nthat the circular polarization dramatically changes with the applied voltage.\nThe emitter based on IJJs can emit circularly-polarized and continuum THz waves\nby the local heating, and will be useful for various technological application.\n", "  Polarization speckle is a fine granular light pattern having spatially\nvarying random polarization profile. We generate these speckle patterns by\nusing the scattering of Poincar\\'e beams, a special class of vector vortex\nbeams, through a ground glass plate. Here, the Poincar\\'e beams are generated\nusing a polarization sensitive spatial light modulator displaying an on-axis\nhologram corresponding to an optical vortex phase profile. The different\ninhomogeneities of the rough surface experience different polarizations, which\ncontrol the ability for scattered waves to interfere at the detection plane and\ncauses a spatially varying polarization profile. We experimentally determined\nthe spatial variation of local degree of polarization and orientation of the\npolarization ellipse for these speckle patterns from the Stokes analysis. We\nalso determined the size of scalar speckles using the auto-correlation function\nof Stokes parameter S0 and the size of polarization speckles using the sum of\nauto-correlation functions of remaining three Stokes parameters. We found that\nthe scalar speckle size is independent of index of the vector beam but the size\nof polarization speckles decreases with the increase in index of the vector\nbeam.\n", "  We present an analytical study of oscillatory laminar shear flow over a\ncompliant viscoelastic layer on a rigid base. This problem relates to\noscillating blood flow in viscoelastic vessels. The deeper motivation for this\nstudy, however, is the possible use of compliant coatings for turbulent drag\nreduction. An analytical solution of the fluid and solid velocity is presented,\nand five dimensionless parameters emerge. The interaction between fluid and\nsolid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter,\nwhich we call the shear interaction parameter $\\chi$. The fluid satisfies a\nno-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow 0$, which occurs\nwhen the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. In contrast, the fluid obeys a\nfree-slip boundary condition when $\\left|\\chi\\right| \\rightarrow \\infty$, which\ncorresponds to a lightweight and/or soft solid. Three types of resonance modes\nare identified for an elastic solid. Two modes (odd and even) are specific to\nthe solid. The third mode results from the coupling with the fluid. The three\nmodes are less pronounced or even absent for a viscoelastic solid. These\nfindings have a twofold use. First, they help to understand the fluid and solid\ndynamics when shear coupling is important. Second, the presented analytical\nsolution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction\nsolvers. Future work might include the extension of the theory to multiple\nviscoelastic layers and the dynamic coupling of normal stresses.\n", "  We report on studies of collisions between 3 keV Ar$^+$ projectile ions and\nneutral targets of isolated 1,3-butadiene (C$_4$H$_6$) molecules and cold,\nloosely bound clusters of these molecules. We identify molecular growth\nprocesses within the molecular clusters that appears to be driven by knockout\nprocesses and that could result in the formation of (aromatic) ring structures.\nThese types of reactions are not unique to specific projectile ions and target\nmolecules, but will occur whenever atoms or ions with suitable masses and\nkinetic energies collide with aggregates of matter, such as carbonaceous grains\nin the interstellar medium or aerosol nanoparticles in the atmosphere.\n", "  Hfq is a bacterial protein that is involved in several aspects of nucleic\nacids metabolism. It has been described as one of the nucleoid associated\nproteins shaping the bacterial chromosome, although it is better known to\ninfluence translation and turnover of cellular RNAs. Here, we explore the role\nof Escherichia coli Hfq C-terminal domain in the compaction of double stranded\nDNA. Various experimental methodologies, including fluorescence microscopy\nimaging of single DNA molecules confined inside nanofluidic channels, atomic\nforce microscopy, isothermal titration microcalorimetry, and electrophoretic\nmobility assays have been used to follow the assembly of the C-terminal and\nN-terminal regions of Hfq on DNA. Results highlight the role of Hfq C-terminal\narms in DNA binding, change in mechanical properties of the double helix and\ncompaction of DNA into a condensed form. The propensity for bridging and\ncompaction of DNA by the C-terminal domain might be related to aggregation of\nbound protein and may have implications for protein binding related gene\nregulation.\n", "  CrN/MgO(111) multilayers modeled via \\textit{ab initio} calculations give\nrise to nanoscale, scalable, spatially separated two-dimensional electron and\nhole gases (2DEG+2DHG), each confined to its own CrN interface. Due to the Cr\n$3d^3$ configuration, both electron and hole gases are based on correlated\ntransition metal layers involving bands of $3d$ character. Transport\ncalculations predict each subsystem will have a large thermopower, on the order\nof 250 $\\mu$$V /K$ at room temperature. These heterostructures combine a large\nthermoelectric efficiency with scalable nanoscale conducting sheets; for\nexample, operating at a temperature difference of 50K, 40 bilayers could\nproduce a 1 V voltage with a film thickness of 100 nm.\n", "  With Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data, we systematically study the\ncross-correlation and time lag in all spectral states of black hole X-ray\nbinary (BHXB) XTE J1859+226 in detail during its entire 1999-2000 outburst that\nlasted for 166 days. Anti-correlations and positive correlations and their\nrespective soft and hard X-ray lags are only detected in the first 100 days of\nthe outburst when the luminosity is high. This suggests that the\ncross-correlations may be related to high luminosity. Positive correlations are\ndetected in every state of XTE J1859+226, viz., hard state, hard-intermediate\nstate (HIMS), soft-intermediate state (SIMS) and soft state. However,\nanti-correlations are only detected in HIMS and SIMS, anti-correlated hard lags\nare only detected in SIMS, while anti-correlated soft lags are detected in both\nHIMS and SIMS. Moreover, the ratio of the observations with anti-correlated\nsoft lags to hard lags detected in XTE J1859+226 is significantly different\nfrom that in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs). So far,\nanti-correlations are never detected in the soft state of BHXBs but detected in\nevery branch or state of NS LMXBs. This may be due to the origin of soft seed\nphotons in BHXBs is confined to the accretion disk and, for NS LMXBs, from both\naccretion disk and the surface of the NS. We notice that the timescale of\nanti-correlated time lags detected in XTE J1859+226 is similar with that of\nother BHXBs and NS LMXBs. We suggest that anti-correlated soft lag detected in\nBHXB may result from fluctuation in the accretion disk as well as NS LMXB.\n", "  A rigorous analytical study of the eigenmodes supported by a charge\naccumulation layer within a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) is presented.\nThe new class of surface plasmons termed Accumulation-Layer Surface Plasmon\n(ASP) is introduced. Near resonance ASP are tightly bound and display a vast\neffective index tunability that could be of great practical interest. The\nsuppression of ASP in the presence of epsilon-near zero regions is discussed.\n", "  For the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2016, the Institute of\nComputational Cosmology from Durham University created the Galaxy Makers\nexhibit to communicate our computational cosmology and astronomy research. In\naddition to the physical exhibit we created an online component to foster\nre-engagement, create a permanent home for our content and to allow us to\ncollect the ever-more important information about participation and impact.\nHere we summarise the details of the exhibit and the successes of creating an\nonline component. We also share suggestions of further uses and improvements\nthat could be implemented for online components of other science exhibitions.\n", "  In a recent work by Maitra et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 2017), it was shown that the\nexisting Quantum Private Query (QPQ) protocols fail to maintain the database\nsecurity if the entangled states shared between Alice and Bob are not of a\ncertain form. So it is necessary to certify the states a priori. In this\nregard, the local CHSH test was proposed. However, the proposed scheme works\nperfectly for the asymptotic case when we have infinite number of qubits. In\nthis brief report, we upgrade the protocol for finite number of qubits and\nconnect the sample size to the success probability of CHSH test. We also\nperform a rigorous security analysis of the proposed protocol.\n", "  Planck's formula and General Relativity indicate that potential energy\ninfluences spacetime. Using Einstein's Equivalence Principle and an extension\nof his Chock Hypothesis, an explicit description of this influence is derived.\nWe present a new relativity model by incorporating the influence of the\npotential energy on spacetime in Newton's dynamics for motion under a central\nforce. This model extends the model used by Friedman and Steiner to obtain the\nexact precession of Mercury without curving spacetime. We also present a\nsolution of this model for a hydrogen-like atom, which explains the reason for\na probabilistic description.\n", "  The discrete variables (DV) time-frequency (TF) quantum key distribution\n(QKD) protocol is a BB84 like protocol, which utilizes time and frequency as\ncomplementary bases. As orthogonal modulations, pulse position modulation (PPM)\nand frequency shift keying (FSK) are capable of transmitting several bits per\nsymbol, i.e. per photon. However, unlike traditional binary polarization shift\nkeying, PPM and FSK do not allow perfectly complementary bases. So information\nis not completely deleted when the wrong-basis filters are applied. Since a\ngeneral security proof does not yet exist, we numerically assess DV-TF-QKD. We\nshow that the secret key rate increases with a higher number of symbols per\nbasis. Further we identify the optimal pulse relations in the two bases in\nterms of key rate and resistance against eavesdropping attacks.\n", "  Emulsions are a central component of many modern formulations in food,\npharmaceuticals, agrichemicals and personal care products. The droplets in\nthese formulations are limited to being spherical as a consequence of the\ninterfacial tension between the dispersed phase and continuous phase. The\nability to control emulsion droplet morphology and stabilise non-spherical\ndroplets would enable the modification of emulsion properties such as\nstability, substrate binding, delivery rate and rheology. One way of\ncontrolling droplet microstructure is to apply an elastic film around the\ndroplet to prevent it from relaxing into a sphere. We have previously shown\nthat BslA, an interfacial protein produced by the bacterial genus Bacillus,\nforms an elastic film when exposed to an oil- or air-water interface. Here, we\nhighlight BslA's ability to stabilise anisotropic emulsion droplets. First, we\nshow that BslA is capable of arresting dynamic emulsification processes leading\nto emulsions with variable morphologies depending on the conditions and\nemulsification technique applied. We then show that frozen emulsion droplets\ncan be manipulated to induce partial coalescence. The structure of the\npartially coalesced droplets is retained after melting, but only when there is\nsufficient free BslA in the continuous phase. That the fidelity of replication\ncan be tuned by adjusting the amount of free BslA in solution suggests that\nfreezing BslA-stabilised droplets disrupts the BslA film. Finally, we utilise\nBslA's ability to preserve emulsion droplet structural integrity throughout the\nmelting process to design emulsion droplets with a chosen shape and size.\n", "  Polarized light passing through twisted special wave plates show entangled\nstate of both SAM and OAM. The variable circular and linear retarders (VCR and\nVLR) are studied here from the view point of quantum processing of entangled\nstates. Interestingly the geometric phase in association with twist dependent\ngain of OAM has been discussed here. As an application of VLR, the origin of\ngradual flattened shape of wave fronts through successive array of antennas\n(QHQ) has been explained through new physical approach of the concurrence of\nentangled states.\n", "  In this paper we present formulae for chord length distribution in the\nframework of Poissonian Voronoi Tessellation (PVT) and non Poissonian Voronoi\nTessellation (NPVT). The introduction of the scale parameter in the obtained\ndistributions allows us to model the chord for cosmic voids. A graphical\ncomparison between cosmic voids visible on two catalogs of galaxies, 2dFGRS and\nVIPERS, and theoretical random chords is reported.\n", "  In this paper I discuss how we might go about about performing a Bell\nexperiment in which humans are used to decide the settings at each end. To get\na sufficiently high rate of switching at both ends, I suggest an experiment\nover a distance of about 100km with 100 people at each end wearing EEG\nheadsets, with the signals from these headsets being used to switch the\nsettings.\n  The radical possibility we wish to investigate is that, when humans are used\nto decide the settings (rather than various types of random number generators),\nwe might then expect to see a violation of Quantum Theory in agreement with the\nrelevant Bell inequality. Such a result, while very unlikely, would be\ntremendously significant for our understanding of the world (and I will discuss\nsome interpretations).\n  Possible radical implications aside, performing an experiment like this would\npush the development of new technologies. The biggest problem would be to get\nsufficiently high rates wherein there has been a human induced switch at each\nend before a signal as to the new value of the setting could be communicated to\nthe other end and, at the same time, a photon pair is detected. It looks like\nan experiment like this, while challenging, is just about feasible with current\ntechnologies.\n", "  Given that the assumption of perfect rationality is rarely met in the real\nworld, we explore a graded notion of rationality in socioecological systems of\nnetworked actors. We parametrize an actors' rationality via their place in a\nsocial network and quantify system rationality via the average Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence between the games Nash and logit quantal response equilibria.\nPrevious work has argued that scale-free topologies maximize a system's overall\nrationality in this setup. Here we show that while, for certain games, it is\ntrue that increasing degree heterogeneity of complex networks enhances\nrationality, rationality-optimal configurations are not scale-free. For the\nPrisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt games, we provide analytic arguments\ncomplemented by numerical optimization experiments to demonstrate that\ncore-periphery networks composed of a few dominant hub nodes surrounded by a\nperiphery of very low degree nodes give strikingly smaller overall deviations\nfrom rationality than scale-free networks. Similarly, for the Battle of the\nSexes and the Matching Pennies games, we find that the optimal network\nstructure is also a core-periphery graph but with a smaller difference in the\naverage degrees of the core and the periphery. These results provide insight on\nthe interplay between the topological structure of socioecological systems and\ntheir collective cognitive behavior, with potential applications to\nunderstanding wealth inequality and the structural features of the network of\nglobal corporate control.\n", "  The Workshop on Nuclear Data Needs and Capabilities for Basic Science was\nheld at the University of Notre Dame on 10-11 August 2016. The purpose of this\ntargeted workshop was to assemble and prioritize the needs of the nuclear\nphysics research community for data sets, services and capabilities in areas\nincluding nuclear structure, nuclear reactions, nuclear astrophysics,\nfundamental interactions, neutrino physics and nuclear theory. An overview of\nnuclear data needs and capabilities identified at this meeting are summarized\nin the present document.\n", "  Characteristic features of tunneling times for dissipative tunneling of a\nparticle through a rectangular barrier are studied within a semiclassical model\ninvolving dissipation in the form of a velocity dependent frictional force. The\naverage dwell time and traversal time with dissipation are found to be less\nthan those without dissipation. This counter-intuitive behaviour is reversed if\none evaluates the physically relevant transmission dwell time. Apart from these\nobservations, we find that the percentage of energy lost by the tunneling\nparticle is higher for smaller energies. The above observations are tested and\nconfirmed in a realistic case by applying the dissipation model to study the\ncurrent-voltage data in a Al/Al$_2$O$_3$/Al solid state junction at various\ntemperatures. The friction coefficient for Al$_2$O$_3$ as a function of\ntemperature is presented. It is found to decrease with increasing temperature.\n", "  We study the Rolie-Poly model for entangled polymers, using a singular\nperturbation analysis for the limit of large relaxation time. In this limit, it\nis shown that the model displays the characteristic features of thixotropic\nyield stress fluids, including yield stress hysteresis, delayed yielding and\nlong term persistence of a decreased viscosity after cessation of flow. We\nfocus on the startup and cessation of shear flow. We identify dynamic regimes\nof fast, slow and yielded dynamics, and show how the combination of these\nregimes can be used to describe the flow.\n"]}
