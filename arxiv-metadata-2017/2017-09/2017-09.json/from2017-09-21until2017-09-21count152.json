It creates an anthropic decision theory (ADT) that\ndecides these problems from a small set of principles. By doing so, it\ndemonstrates that the attitude of agents with regards to each other (selfish or\naltruistic) changes the decisions they reach, and that it is very important to\ntake this into account. To illustrate ADT, it is then applied to two major\nanthropic problems and paradoxes, the Presumptuous Philosopher and Doomsday\nproblems, thus resolving some issues about the probability of human extinction.\n", "  We report an approach to confine the carriers in single-layer graphene, which\nleads to quantum devices with field-induced quantum confinement. We\ndemonstrated that the Coulomb-blockade effect evolves under a uniform magnetic\nfield perpendicular to the graphene device. Our experimental results show that\nfield-induced quantum dots are realized in graphene, and a quantum\nconfinement-deconfinement transition is switched by the magnetic field.\n", "  Motivated by the recent and growing interest in smart grid technology, we\nstudy the operation of DC/AC inverters in an inductive microgrid. We show that\na network of loads and DC/AC inverters equipped with power-frequency droop\ncontrollers can be cast as a Kuramoto model of phase-coupled oscillators. This\nnovel description, together with results from the theory of coupled\noscillators, allows us to characterize the behavior of the network of inverters\nand loads. Specifically, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for\nthe existence of a synchronized solution that is unique and locally\nexponentially stable. We present a selection of controller gains leading to a\ndesirable sharing of power among the inverters, and specify the set of loads\nwhich can be serviced without violating given actuation constraints. Moreover,\nwe propose a distributed integral controller based on averaging algorithms\nwhich dynamically regulates the system frequency in the presence of a\ntime-varying load. Remarkably, this distributed-averaging integral controller\nhas the additional property that it maintains the power sharing properties of\nthe primary droop controller. Our results hold without assumptions on identical\nline characteristics or voltage magnitudes.\n", "  In this paper, we apply the method of approximate transformation groups\nproposed by Baikov, Gaziziv and Ibragimov, to compute the first-order\napproximate symmetry for the Gardner equations with the small parameters. We\ncompute the optimal system and analyze some invariant solutions of These types\nof equations. Particularly, general forms of approximately Galilean-invariant\nsolutions have been computed.\n", "  While introductory electricity and magnetism (E&M) has been investigated for\ndecades, research at the upper-division is relatively new. The University of\nColorado has developed the Colorado Upper-Division Electrostatics (CUE)\nDiagnostic to test students' understanding of the content of the first semester\nof an upper-division E&M course. While the questions on the CUE cover many\nlearning goals in an appropriate manner, we believe the rubric for the CUE is\nparticularly aligned to the topics and methods of teaching at the University of\nColorado. We suggest that changes to the rubric would allow for better\nassessment of a wider range of teaching schemes. As an example, we highlight\none problem from the CUE involving the superposition principle. Using data from\nboth Oregon State University and the University of Colorado, we discuss the\nlimitations of the current rubric, compare results using a different analysis\nscheme, and discuss the implications for assessing students' understanding.\n", "  The Colorado Upper-Division Electrostatics (CUE) Diagnostic is an exam\ndeveloped as part of the curriculum reform at the University of Colorado,\nBoulder (CU). It was designed to assess conceptual learning within\nupper-division electricity and magnetism (E&M). Using the CUE, we have been\ndocumenting students' understanding of E&M at Oregon State University (OSU)\nover a period of 5 years. Our analysis indicates that the CUE identifies\nconcepts that are generally difficult for students, regardless of the\ncurriculum. The overall pattern of OSU students' scores reproduces the pattern\nreported by Chasteen et al. at CU. There are, however, some important\ndifferences that we will address. In particular, our students struggle with the\nCUE problems involving separation of variables and boundary conditions. We will\ndiscuss the possible causes for this, as well as steps that may rectify the\nsituation.\n", "  We establish localization type dynamical bounds as a corollary of positive\nLyapunov exponents for general operators with quasiperiodic potentials defined\nby piecewise Holder functions.\n", "  In this paper, we will study the effect of having a minimum measurable length\non inflationary cosmology. We will analyze the inflationary cosmology in the\nJacobson approach. In this approach, gravity is viewed as an emergent\nthermodynamical phenomenon. We will demonstrate that the existence of a minimum\nmeasurable length will modify the Friedmann equations in the Jacobson approach.\nWe will use this modified Friedmann equation to analyze the effect of minimum\nmeasurable length scale on inflationary cosmology. This analysis will be\nperformed using the Hamiltonian-Jacobi approach. We compare our results to\nrecent data and find that our model may agree with the recent data.\n", "  The appearance of Hamiltonian constraint in the canonical formalism for\ngeneral relativity reflects the lack of a fixed external time. The dynamics of\ngeneral relativistic systems can be expressed with respect to an arbitrarily\nchosen internal degree of freedom, the so called internal clock. We investigate\nthe way in which the choice of internal clock determines the quantum dynamics\nand how much different quantum dynamics induced by different clocks are. We\ndevelop our method of comparison by extending the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of\ncontact transformations to include a new type of transformations which\ntransform both the canonical variables and the internal clock. We employ our\nmethod to study the quantum dynamics of the Friedmann-Lemaitre model and obtain\nsemiclassical corrections to the classical dynamics, which depend on the choice\nof internal clock. For a unique quantisation map we find the abundance of\ninequivalent semiclassical corrections induced by quantum dynamics taking place\nin different internal clocks. It follows that the concepts like minimal volume,\nmaximal curvature and the number of quantum bounces, often used to describe\nquantum effects in cosmological models, depend on the choice of internal clock.\n", "  A theorem of Feigin, Frenkel and Reshetikhin provides expressions for the\neigenvalues of the higher Gaudin Hamiltonians on the Bethe vectors in terms of\nelements of the center of the affine vertex algebra at the critical level. In\nour recent work, explicit Harish-Chandra images of generators of the center\nwere calculated in all classical types. We combine these results to calculate\nthe eigenvalues of the higher Gaudin Hamiltonians on the Bethe vectors in an\nexplicit form. The Harish-Chandra images can be interpreted as elements of\nclassical $W$-algebras. We provide a direct connection between the rings of\n$q$-characters and classical $W$-algebras by calculating classical limits of\nthe corresponding screening operators.\n", "  Increasing student retention and persistence -- in particular classes or in\ntheir major area of study -- is a challenge for universities. Students'\nacademic and social integration into an institution seems to be vital for\nstudent retention, yet, research on the effect of interpersonal interactions is\nrare. Social network analysis is an approach that can be used to identify\npatterns of interaction that contribute to integration into the university. We\nanalyze how students position within a social network in a Modeling Instruction\n(MI) course that strongly emphasizes interactive learning impacts their\npersistence in taking a subsequent MI course. We find that students with higher\ncentrality at the end of the first semester of MI are more likely to enroll in\na second semester of MI. While the correlation with increased persistence is an\nongoing study, these findings suggest that student social integration\ninfluences persistence.\n", "  In evolving complex systems such as air traffic and social organizations,\ncollective effects emerge from their many components' dynamic interactions.\nWhile the dynamic interactions can be represented by temporal networks with\nnodes and links that change over time, they remain highly complex. It is\ntherefore often necessary to use methods that extract the temporal networks'\nlarge-scale dynamic community structure. However, such methods are subject to\noverfitting or suffer from effects of arbitrary, a priori imposed timescales,\nwhich should instead be extracted from data. Here we simultaneously address\nboth problems and develop a principled data-driven method that determines\nrelevant timescales and identifies patterns of dynamics that take place on\nnetworks as well as shape the networks themselves. We base our method on an\narbitrary-order Markov chain model with community structure, and develop a\nnonparametric Bayesian inference framework that identifies the simplest such\nmodel that can explain temporal interaction data.\n", "  We show that the shape resonances induced by a one dimensional well of delta\nfunctions disappear as soon as a small constant electric field is applied. In\nparticular, in any compact subset below the positive real axis there are no\nresonances if the non-zero field is small enough. In contrast to the lack of\nconvergence of the lifetimes computed from the widths of the resonances we show\nthat the \"experimental lifetimes\" are continuous at zero field. The shape\nresonances are replaced by an infinite set of other resonances whose location\nand number we analyze.\n", "  Modeling the creative mathematical sensemaking that characterizes expert\nthinking in physics is typically a struggle for new learners. To help students\nlearn to reason this way, we created a set of supplemental activities called\nPhysics Invention Tasks (PITs)*. PITs engage students in quantification, the\nprocess of mathematically generating quantities central to modeling in physics.\nPITs depict a scenario in which students need to engage in decision-making\nassociated with creating quantities in order to resolve a problem. Students\nmake decisions about the arithmetic construction, the magnitude and associated\nunit, and in some cases spatial direction of a new quantity. The design of PITs\nis informed by Inventing with Contrasting Cases, an instructional approach\nshown to foster generativity, i.e., creativity with mathematical structures. In\nthis paper, we describe the theoretical foundation of PITs, and their structure\nand implementation. We share preliminary observations of the impact of PITs in\none course, averaged over two years, as measured by the FCI and CLASS. We see\nan improvement in the FCI normalized gain corresponding to the introduction of\nPITS and we see CLASS pre- to post-test gains that may be the highest reported\nfrom a large enrollment calculus-based physics course. We discuss future\nresearch into the learning mechanisms and instructor influence associated with\nPITs.\n  *available at http://inventiontasks.physics.rutgers.edu\n", "  The phenomenon of jet quenching provides essential information about the\nproperties of hot and dense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions. Recent results from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nshow evidence for an unexpectedly similar suppression of both light and heavy\nflavor jets. Furthermore, the role of radiative energy loss of heavy quarks is\nstill under active discussion within the theoretical community. By employing\nthe parton cascade Boltzmann Approach to Multi-Parton Scatterings (BAMPS),\nwhich numerically solves the 3+1D Boltzmann equation both for light and heavy\nflavor partons, we calculate the nuclear modification factor of inclusive and\nb-tagged reconstructed jets in 0-10% central $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm LHC}}$ = 2.76 ATeV\nPb+Pb collisions. Based on perturbative QCD cross sections we find a\nsuppression of both light and heavy flavor jets. While the inclusive jets are\nslightly too strong suppressed within BAMPS in comparison with data, both\nelastic+radiative and only elastic interactions lead to a realistic b-tagged\njet suppression. To further investigate light and heavy flavor energy loss we\npredict the R dependence of inclusive and b-tagged jet suppression.\nFurthermore, we propose the medium modification of b-tagged jet shapes as an\nobservable for discriminating between different heavy quark energy loss\nscenarios.\n", "  In contrast to the first-order correlation-driven Mott metal-insulator\ntransition (MIT), contin- uous disorder-driven transitions are intrinsically\nquantum critical. Here, we investigate transport quantum criticality in the\nFalicov-Kimball model, a representative of the latter class in the \"strong\ndisorder\" category. Employing cluster-dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT), we\nfind clear and anomalous quantum critical scaling behavior manifesting as\nperfect mirror symmetry of scaling curves on both sides of the MIT.\nSurprisingly, we find that the beta-function, \\b{eta}(g), scales like log(g)\ndeep into the bad-metallic phase as well, providing sound unified basis for\nthese findings. We argue that such \"strong localization\" quantum criticality\nmay manifest in real three-dimensional systems where disorder effects are more\nimportant than electron-electron interactions.\n", "  Electrons in the pyrochore iridates experience a large interaction energy in\naddition to a strong spin-orbit interaction. Both features make the iridates\npromising for realizing novel states such as the Topological Mott Insulator.\nThe pyrochlore iridate Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ shows a metal-insulator transition at\n$T_N \\sim$ 120 K below which a magnetically ordered state develops. Using\ntorque magnetometry, we uncover a highly unusual magnetic response. A magnetic\nfield $\\bf H$ applied in its $a$-$b$ plane produces a nonlinear magnetization\n$M_\\perp$ orthogonal to the plane. $M_\\perp$ displays a $d$-wave field-angle\npattern consistent with octupolar order, with a handedness dictated by field\ncooling, leading to symmetry breaking of the chirality $\\omega$. A surprise is\nthat the lobe orientation of the $d$-wave pattern is sensitive to the direction\nof the field when the sample is field-cooled below $T_N$, suggestive of an\nadditional order parameter $\\eta$ already present at 300 K.\n", "  With recent improvements in coherence times, superconducting transmon qubits\nhave become a promising platform for quantum computing. They can be flexibly\nengineered over a wide range of parameters, but also require us to identify an\nefficient operating regime. Using state-of-the-art quantum optimal control\ntechniques, we exhaustively explore the landscape for creation and removal of\nentanglement over a wide range of design parameters. We identify an optimal\noperating region outside of the usually considered strongly dispersive regime,\nwhere multiple sources of entanglement interfere simultaneously, which we name\nthe quasi-dispersive straddling qutrits (QuaDiSQ) regime. At a chosen point in\nthis region, a universal gate set is realized by applying microwave fields for\ngate durations of 50 ns, with errors approaching the limit of intrinsic\ntransmon coherence. Our systematic quantum optimal control approach is easily\nadapted to explore the parameter landscape of other quantum technology\nplatforms.\n", "  We present a general treatment of the leading order dynamics of the\ncollective modes of charged dilatonic $p$-brane solutions of (super)gravity\ntheories in arbitrary backgrounds. To this end we employ the general strategy\nof the blackfold approach which is based on a long-wavelength derivative\nexpansion around an exact or approximate solution of the (super)gravity\nequations of motion. The resulting collective mode equations are formulated as\nforced hydrodynamic equations on dynamically embedded hypersurfaces. We derive\nthem in full generality (including all possible asymptotic fluxes and dilaton\nprofiles) in a far-zone analysis of the (super)gravity equations and in\nrepresentative examples in a near-zone analysis. An independent treatment based\non the study of external couplings in hydrostatic partition functions is also\npresented. Special emphasis is given to the forced collective mode equations\nthat arise in type IIA/B and eleven-dimensional supergravities, where besides\nthe standard Lorentz force couplings our analysis reveals additional couplings\nto the background, including terms that arise from Chern-Simons interactions.\nWe also present a general overview of the blackfold approach and some of the\nkey conceptual issues that arise when applied to arbitrary backgrounds.\n", "  In this Letter, we study analytically the evolutions of the flat\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe and its linear\nperturbations in the framework of {\\em the dressed metric approach} in loop\nquantum cosmology (LQC). Assuming that the evolution of the background is\ndominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the quantum bounce, we find\nthat both evolutions of the background and its perturbations are independent of\nthe inflationary potentials during the pre-inflationary phase. During this\nperiod the effective potentials of the perturbations can be well approximated\nby a P\\\"oschl-Teller (PT) potential, from which we find analytically the mode\nfunctions and then calculate the corresponding Bogoliubov coefficients at the\nonset of the slow-roll inflation, valid for any inflationary model with a\nsingle scalar field. Imposing the Bunch-Davies (BD) vacuum in the contracting\nphase prior to the bounce when the modes are all inside the Hubble horizon, we\nshow that particles are generically created due to the pre-inflation dynamics.\nMatching them to those obtained in the slow-roll inflationary phase, we\ninvestigate the effects of the pre-inflation dynamics on the scalar and tensor\npower spectra and find features that can be tested by current and forthcoming\nobservations. In particular, to be consistent with the Planck 2015 data, we\nfind that the universe must have expanded at least $141$ e-folds since the\nbounce.\n", "  We consider an unpinned chain of harmonic oscillators with periodic boundary\nconditions, whose dynamics is perturbed by a random flip of the sign of the\nvelocities. The dynamics conserves the total volume (or elongation) and the\ntotal energy of the system. We prove that in a diffusive space-time scaling\nlimit the profiles corresponding to the two conserved quantities converge to\nthe solution of a diffusive system of differential equations. While the\nelongation follows a simple autonomous linear diffusive equation, the evolution\nof the energy depends on the gradient of the square of the elongation.\n", "  The determination of the resolution of cosmological N-body simulations, i.e.,\nthe range of scales in which quantities measured in them represent accurately\nthe continuum limit, is an important open question. We address it here using\nscale-free models, for which self-similarity provides a powerful tool to\ncontrol resolution. Such models also provide a robust testing ground for the\nso-called stable clustering approximation, which gives simple predictions for\nthem. Studying large N-body simulations of such models with different force\nsmoothing, we find that these two issues are in fact very closely related: our\nconclusion is that the accuracy of two point statistics in the non-linear\nregime starts to degrade strongly around the scale at which their behaviour\ndeviates from that predicted by the stable clustering hypothesis. Physically\nthe association of the two scales is in fact simple to understand: stable\nclustering fails to be a good approximation when there are strong interactions\nof structures (in particular merging) and it is precisely such non-linear\nprocesses which are sensitive to fluctuations at the smaller scales affected by\ndiscretisation. Resolution may be further degraded if the short distance\ngravitational smoothing scale is larger than the scale to which stable\nclustering can propagate. We examine in detail the very different conclusions\nof studies by Smith et al. (2003) and Widrow et al. (2009} and find that the\nstrong deviations from stable clustering reported by these works are the\nresults of over-optimistic assumptions about scales resolved accurately by the\nmeasured power spectra, and the reliance on Fourier space analysis. We\nemphasise the much poorer resolution obtained with the power spectrum compared\nto the two point correlation function..\n", "  Spin-orbit interactions are known to have drastic effects on the band\nstructure of heavy-element-based materials. Celebrated examples are the\nrecently identified 3D and 2D topological insulators. In those systems\ntransport takes place at surfaces or along edges, and spin-momentum locking\nprovides protection against (non-magnetic) impurity scattering, favoring\nspin-polarized ballistic transport. We have used the measurement of the current\nphase relation of a micrometer-long single crystal bismuth nanowire connected\nto superconducting electrodes, to demonstrate that transport occurs\nballistically along two edges of this high-spin-orbit material. In addition, we\nshow that a magnetic field can induce to 0-pi transitions and phi0-junction\nbehavior, thanks to the extraordinarily high g-factor and spin orbit coupling\nin this system, providing a way to manipulate the phase of the\nsupercurrent-carrying edge states.\n", "  Motivated by a recent experiment which synthesizes Landau levels for photons\non cones [Schine {\\em et al.}, Nature 534, 671 (2016)], and more generally the\ninterest in understanding gravitational responses of quantum Hall states, we\nstudy fractional quantum Hall states of bosons on cones. A variety of trial\nwave functions for conical systems are constructed and compared with exact\ndiagonalization results. The tip of a cone is a localized geometrical defect\nwith singular curvature which can modify the density profiles of quantum Hall\nstates. The density profiles on cones can be used to extract some universal\ninformation about quantum Hall states. The values of certain quantities are\ncomputed numerically using the density profiles of some quantum Hall states and\nthey agree with analytical predictions.\n", "  Recently a significant interest in ferromagnetic curved thin films has\nappeared. In particular, thin spherical shells are currently of great interest\ndue to their capability to support skyrmion solutions which can be stabilized\nby curvature effects only, in contrast to the planar case where the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is required. This paper aims to a\n$\\Gamma$-asymptotic analysis of the micromagnetic energy functional, when the\nshell is generated, like in the case of a sphere, by a bounded, convex and\nsmooth surface.\n", "  We investigate a brane model based on Randall-Sundrum scenarios with a\ngeneric dark energy component. The latter drives the accelerated expansion at\nlate times of the Universe. In this scheme, extra terms are added into Einstein\nField equations that are propagated to the Friedmann equations. To constrain\nthe dark energy equation of state (EoS) and the brane tension we use\nobservational data with different energy levels (Supernovae type Ia, $H(z)$,\nbaryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background radiation\ndistance, and a joint analysis) in a background cosmology. Beside EoS being\nconsistent with a cosmological constant at the $3\\sigma$ confidence level for\neach dataset, the baryon acoustic oscillations probe favors an EoS consistent\nwith a quintessence dark energy. Although we found different lower limit bounds\non the brane tension for each data sets, being the most restricted for CMB,\nthere is not enough evidence of modifications in the cosmological evolution of\nthe Universe by the existence of an extra dimension within observational\nuncertainties. Nevertheless, these new bounds are complementary to those\nobtained by other probes like table-top experiments, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,\nand stellar dynamics. Our results show that a further test of the braneworld\nmodel with appropriate correction terms or a profound analysis with\nperturbations, may be needed to improve the constraints provided by the current\ndata.\n", "  Dirac and Weyl semimetals display a host of novel properties. In\nCd$_3$As$_2$, the Dirac nodes lead to a protection mechanism that strongly\nsuppresses backscattering in zero magnetic field, resulting in ultrahigh\nmobility ($\\sim$ 10$^7$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$). In applied magnetic field,\nan anomalous Nernst effect is predicted to arise from the Berry curvature\nassociated with the Weyl nodes. We report observation of a large anomalous\nNernst effect in Cd$_3$As$_2$. Both the anomalous Nernst signal and transport\nrelaxation time $\\tau_{tr}$ begin to increase rapidly at $\\sim$ 50 K. This\nsuggests a close relation between the protection mechanism and the anomalous\nNernst effect. In a field, the quantum oscillations of bulk states display a\nbeating effect, suggesting that the Dirac nodes split into Weyl states,\nallowing the Berry curvature to be observed as an anomalous Nernst effect.\n", "  We discuss a new type of Higgs-portal dark matter (DM)-production mechanism,\ncalled bosonic-seesaw portal (BSP) scenario. The BS provides the dynamical\norigin of the electroweak symmetry breaking, triggered by mixing between the\nelementary Higgs and a composite Higgs generated by a new-color strong\ndynamics, hypercolor (HC). At the HC strong coupling scale, the classical-scale\ninvariance assumed in the model is dynamically broken as well as the \"chiral\"\nsymmetry present in the HC sector. In addition to the composite Higgs, HC\nbaryons emerge to potentially be stable because of the unbroken HC baryon\nnumber symmetry. Hence the lightest HC baryon can be a DM candidate. Of\ninterest in the present scenario is that HC pions can be as heavy as the HC\nbaryon due to the possibly enhanced-explicit \"chiral\"-breaking effect triggered\nafter the BS mechanism, so the HC baryon pair cannot annihilate into HC pions.\nAs in the standard setup of freeze-in scenario, it is assumed that the DM was\nnever in the thermal equilibrium, which ends up with no thermal abundance. It\nis then the non-thermal BSP process that crucially comes into the game below\nthe HC scale: the HC baryon significantly couples to the standard-model Higgs\nvia the BS mechanism, and can non-thermally be produced from the thermal plasma\nbelow the HC scale, which turns out to allow the TeV mass scale for the\ncomposite baryonic DM, much smaller than the generic bound placed in the\nconventional thermal freeze-out scenario, to account for the observed relic\nabundance. Thus the DM can closely be related to the mechanism of the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking.\n", "  Chern-Simons gauge theories coupled to massless fundamental scalars or\nfermions define interesting non-supersymmetric 3d CFTs that possess approximate\nhigher-spin symmetries at large N. In this paper, we compute the scaling\ndimensions of the higher-spin operators in these models, to leading order in\nthe 1/N expansion and exactly in the 't Hooft coupling. We obtain these results\nin two independent ways: by using conformal symmetry and the classical\nequations of motion to fix the structure of the current non-conservation, and\nby a direct Feynman diagram calculation. The full dependence on the 't Hooft\ncoupling can be restored by using results that follow from the weakly broken\nhigher-spin symmetry. This analysis also allows us to obtain some explicit\nresults for the non-conserved, parity-breaking structures that appear in planar\nthree-point functions of the higher-spin operators. At large spin, we find that\nthe anomalous dimensions grow logarithmically with the spin, in agreement with\ngeneral expectations. This logarithmic behavior disappears in the strong\ncoupling limit, where the anomalous dimensions turn into those of the critical\nO(N) or Gross-Neveu models, in agreement with the conjectured 3d bosonization\nduality.\n", "  We establish a detailed phenomenology of photocarrier transport in the copper\noxide plane by studying the transient terahertz photoconductivity of\nSr$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_6$. The peak photoconductivity\nsaturates with fluence, decays on multiple picosecond timescales, and evolves\ninto a state characterized by activated transport. The time dependence shows\nlittle change with fluence, indicating that the decay is governed by\nfirst-order recombination kinetics. We find that most photocarriers make a\nnegligible contribution to the dc photoconductivity, and we estimate the\nintrinsic photocarrier mobility to be 0.6-0.7 cm$^2$/V s at early times,\ncomparable to the mobility in chemically doped materials.\n", "  We propose a covariant holographic conjecture for the entanglement negativity\nof mixed states in bipartite systems described by $d$-dimensional conformal\nfield theories dual to bulk non static $AdS_{d+1}$ configurations. Application\nof our conjecture to $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories dual to bulk\nrotating BTZ black holes exactly reproduces the corresponding entanglement\nnegativity in the large central charge limit and characterizes the distillable\nentanglement. We further demonstrate that our conjecture applied to the case of\nbulk extremal rotating BTZ black holes also characterizes the entanglement\nnegativity for the chiral half of the corresponding zero temperature\n$(1+1)$-dimensional holographic conformal field theories.\n", "  We study theoretically the teleportation of controlled-phase (CZ) gate\nthrough measurement-based quantum information processing for\ncontinuous-variable systems. We examine the degree of entanglement in the\noutput modes of the teleported CZ-gate for two classes of resource states: the\ncanonical cluster states that are constructed via direct implementations of\ntwo-mode squeezing operations, and the linear-optical version of cluster states\nwhich are built from linear-optical networks of beam splitters and phase\nshifters. In order to reduce the excess noise arising from finite-squeezed\nresource states, teleportation through resource states with different\nmulti-rail designs will be considered and the enhancement of entanglement in\nthe teleported CZ-gates will be analyzed. For multi-rail cluster with an\narbitrary number of rails, we obtain analytical expressions for the\nentanglement in the output modes and analyze in detail the results for both\nclasses of resource states. At the same time, we also show that for uniformly\nsqueezed clusters the multi-rail noise reduction can be optimized when the\nexcess noise is allocated uniformly to the rails. To facilitate the analysis,\nwe develop a trick with manipulations of quadrature operators that can reveal\nrather efficiently the measurement sequence and corrective operations needed\nfor the measurement-based gate teleportation, which will also be explained in\ndetail.\n", "  We embed the component fields of eleven-dimensional supergravity into a\nsuperspace of the form $X\\times Y$ where $X$ is the standard 4D, $N=1$\nsuperspace and $Y$ is a smooth 7-manifold. The eleven-dimensional 3-form gives\nrise to a tensor hierarchy of superfields gauged by the diffeomorphisms of $Y$.\nIt contains a natural candidate for a $G_2$ structure on $Y$, and being a\ncomplex of superforms, defines a superspace Chern-Simons invariant. Adding to\nthis a natural generalization of the Riemannian volume on $X\\times Y$ and\nfreezing the (superspin-$\\frac32$ and 1) supergravity fields on $X$, we obtain\nan approximation to the eleven-dimensional supergravity action that suffices to\ncompute the scalar potential. In this approximation the action is the sum of\nthe superspace Chern-Simons term and a superspace generalization of the Hitchin\nfunctional for $Y$ as a $G_2$-structure manifold. Integrating out auxiliary\nfields, we obtain the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry and the scalar\npotential. The latter reproduces the Einstein-Hilbert term on $Y$ in a form due\nto Bryant.\n", "  Synchrotron emission pervades the Galactic plane at low radio frequencies,\noriginating from cosmic ray electrons interacting with the Galactic magnetic\nfield. Using a low-frequency radio telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array\n(MWA), we measure the free-free absorption of this Galactic synchrotron\nemission by intervening HII regions along the line of sight. These absorption\nmeasurements allow us to calculate the Galactic cosmic-ray electron emissivity\nbehind and in front of 47 detected HII regions in the region $250^\\circ < l <\n355^\\circ$, $|b| < 2^\\circ$. We find that all average emissivities between the\nHII regions and the Galactic edge along the line of sight ($\\epsilon_b$) are in\nthe range of 0.24$\\,\\,\\sim\\,\\,$0.70$\\,\\,$K$\\,\\,$pc$^{-1}$ with a mean of\n0.40$\\,\\,$K$\\,\\,$pc$^{-1}$ and a variance of 0.10$\\,\\,$K$\\,\\,$pc$^{-1}$ at\n88$\\,\\,$MHz. Our best model, the Two-circle model, divides the Galactic disk\ninto three regions using two circles centring on the Galactic centre. It shows\na high emissivity region near the Galactic centre, a low emissivity region near\nthe Galactic edge, and a medium emissivity region between these two regions,\ncontrary to the trend found by previous studies.\n", "  We perform a direct calculation of the gluon momentum fraction of the nucleon\nusing maximally twisted mass fermion ensembles with $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors at a\npion mass of about $370\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ and a lattice spacing of $a\\approx\n0.082\\,\\mathrm{fm}$ and with $N_f=2$ flavors at the physical pion mass and a\nlattice spacing of $a\\approx 0.093\\,\\mathrm{fm}$. In the definition of the\ngluon operator we employ stout smearing to obtain a statistically significant\nresult for the bare matrix elements. In addition, we perform a lattice\nperturbative calculation including 2 levels of stout smearing to carry out the\nmixing and the renormalization of the quark and gluon operators. We find, after\nconversion to the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at a scale of\n$2\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$: $\\langle x\\rangle^R_g {=} 0.284(23)(23)$ for pion mass of\nabout $370\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\\langle x\\rangle^R_g {=} 0.283(23)(15)$ for the\nphysical pion mass.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the study, with variational technique, of\n(p,q)-Laplacian equations in presence of general nonlinearities. Especially we\nobtain the existence result for the zero mass case, which includes a large\nclass of pure power nonlinearities. More general quasilinear problems of\nBorn-Infeld type are also considered.\n", "  The rigorous analysis of textbook result(Chiu and Quinn, 1974) gives\nunexpectedly the dramatic change of magnetoplasmon spectrum taking into account\nboth the arbitrary dissipation and asymmetric off-plane structure of 2D system.\nFor given wave vector the dissipation enhancement leads to decrease(increase)\nof magnetoplasmon frequency at low(high) magnetic field. At certain range of\ndisorder the purely relaxational mode appears in magnetoplasmon spectrum. In\nstrong magnetic fields the magnetoplasmon frequency falls to cyclotron\nresonance line even in presence of finite dissipation. The recent observation\nof 2D magnetoplasmon spectrum is consistent with our findings.\n", "  ZrTe$_5$ has been of recent interest as a potential Dirac/Weyl semimetal\nmaterial. Here, we report the results of experiments performed via in-situ 3D\ndouble-axis rotation to extract the full $4\\pi$ solid angular dependence of the\ntransport properties. A clear anomalous Hall effect (AHE) was detected for\nevery sample, with no magnetic ordering observed in the system to the\nexperimental sensitivity of torque magnetometry. Interestingly, the AHE takes\nlarge values when the magnetic field is rotated in-plane, with the values\nvanishing above $\\sim 60$ K where the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance\n(LMR) also disappears. This suggests a close relation in their origins, which\nwe attribute to Berry curvature generated by the Weyl nodes.\n", "  A common way to simulate the transport and spread of pollutants in the\natmosphere is via stochastic Lagrangian dispersion models. Mathematically,\nthese models describe turbulent transport processes with stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs). The computational bottleneck is the Monte Carlo\nalgorithm, which simulates the motion of a large number of model particles in a\nturbulent velocity field; for each particle, a trajectory is calculated with a\nnumerical timestepping method. Choosing an efficient numerical method is\nparticularly important in operational emergency-response applications, such as\ntracking radioactive clouds from nuclear accidents or predicting the impact of\nvolcanic ash clouds on international aviation, where accurate and timely\npredictions are essential. In this paper, we investigate the application of the\nMultilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to simulate the propagation of particles\nin a representative one-dimensional dispersion scenario in the atmospheric\nboundary layer. MLMC can be shown to result in asymptotically superior\ncomputational complexity and reduced computational cost when compared to the\nStandard Monte Carlo (StMC) method, which is currently used in atmospheric\ndispersion modelling. To reduce the absolute cost of the method also in the\nnon-asymptotic regime, it is equally important to choose the best possible\nnumerical timestepping method on each level. To investigate this, we also\ncompare the standard symplectic Euler method, which is used in many operational\nmodels, with two improved timestepping algorithms based on SDE splitting\nmethods.\n", "  Developing on a recent work on localized bubbles of ordinary relativistic\nfluids, we study the comparatively richer leading order surface physics of\nrelativistic superfluids, coupled to an arbitrary stationary background metric\nand gauge field in $3+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions. The analysis is performed with\nthe help of a Euclidean effective action in one lower dimension, written in\nterms of the superfluid Goldstone mode, the shape-field (characterizing the\nsurface of the superfluid bubble) and the background fields. We find new terms\nin the ideal order constitutive relations of the superfluid surface, in both\nthe parity-even and parity-odd sectors, with the corresponding transport\ncoefficients entirely fixed in terms of the first order bulk transport\ncoefficients. Some bulk transport coefficients even enter and modify the\nsurface thermodynamics. In the process, we also evaluate the stationary first\norder parity-odd bulk currents in $2+1$ dimensions, which follows from four\nindependent terms in the superfluid effective action in that sector. In the\nsecond part of the paper, we extend our analysis to stationary surfaces in\n$3+1$ dimensional Galilean superfluids via the null reduction of null\nsuperfluids in $4+1$ dimensions. The ideal order constitutive relations in the\nGalilean case also exhibit some new terms similar to their relativistic\ncounterparts. Finally, in the relativistic context, we turn on slow but\narbitrary time dependence and answer some of the key questions regarding the\ntime-dependent dynamics of the shape-field using the second law of\nthermodynamics. A linearized fluctuation analysis in $2+1$ dimensions about a\ntoy equilibrium configuration reveals some new surface modes, including\nparity-odd ones. Our framework can be easily applied to model more general\ninterfaces between distinct fluid-phases.\n", "  We present new features of low energy Bogoliubov quasiparticle excitations of\na two component Bose-Einstein condensate (TBEC) in quasi-2D geometry at zero\ntemperature using Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB). We, in particular, consider\nthe TBECs of $^{133}$Cs~-$^{87}$Rb and $^{85}$Rb~-$^{87}$Rb, and show specific\nfeatures in the low energy excitation spectrum as a function of the interaction\nstrength. For $^{85}$Rb~-$^{87}$Rb TBEC, the appearance of a new zero energy\nmode is observed. Whereas for $^{133}$Cs~-$^{87}$Rb TBEC we report a\nbifurcation of the softened Kohn mode at the point of transition from miscible\nto immiscible domain. The lower energy mode, after the bifurcation, goes soft\nand becomes a new Goldstone mode of the system.\n", "  Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of mass $M_{\\bullet} \\approx 10^{2} -\n10^{5}$ solar masses, $M_{\\odot}$, are the long-sought missing link between\nstellar black holes, born of supernovae, and massive black holes, tied to\ngalaxy evolution by the empirical $M_{\\bullet}/\\sigma_{\\star}$ correlation. We\nshow that low-mass black hole seeds that accrete stars from locally dense\nenvironments in galaxies following a universal $M_{\\bullet}/\\sigma_{\\star}$\nrelation grow over the age of the Universe to be above\n${\\mathcal{M}}_{0}\\approx3\\times10^{5}M_{\\odot}$ ($5\\%$ lower limit),\nindependent of the unknown seed masses and formation processes. The mass\n${\\mathcal{M}}_{0}$ depends weakly on the uncertain formation redshift, and\nsets a universal minimal mass scale for present-day black holes. This can\nexplain why no IMBHs have yet been found, and it implies that present-day\ngalaxies with\n${\\sigma_{\\star}<{\\mathcal{S}}_{0}\\approx40\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}}$ lack a\ncentral black hole, or formed it only recently. A dearth of IMBHs at low\nredshifts has observable implications for tidal disruptions and gravitational\nwave mergers.\n", "  We study the luminosity function of intermediate-age red-clump stars using\ndeep, near-infrared photometric data covering $\\sim$ 20 deg$^2$ located\nthroughout the central part of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), comprising the\nmain body and the galaxy's eastern wing, based on observations obtained with\nthe VISTA Survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC). We identified regions which\nshow a foreground population ($\\sim$11.8 $\\pm$ 2.0 kpc in front of the main\nbody) in the form of a distance bimodality in the red-clump distribution. The\nmost likely explanation for the origin of this feature is tidal stripping from\nthe SMC rather than the extended stellar haloes of the Magellanic Clouds and/or\ntidally stripped stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud. The homogeneous and\ncontinuous VMC data trace this feature in the direction of the Magellanic\nBridge and, particularly, identify (for the first time) the inner region\n($\\sim$ 2 -- 2.5 kpc from the centre) from where the signatures of interactions\nstart becoming evident. This result provides observational evidence of the\nformation of the Magellanic Bridge from tidally stripped material from the SMC.\n", "  We propose an experiment to demonstrate a novel blockade mechanism caused by\nlong-range anisotropic interactions in an ultracold dipolar gas composed of the\nrecently observed \"butterfly\" Rydberg molecules. At the blockade radius, the\nstrong intermolecular interaction between two adjacent molecules shifts their\nmolecular states out of resonance with the photoassociation laser, preventing\ntheir simultaneous excitation. When the molecules are prepared in a\nquasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) trap, the interaction's strength can be tuned via a\nweak external field. The molecular density thus depends strongly on the angle\nbetween the trap axis and the field. The available Rydberg and molecular states\nprovide a wide range of tunability.\n", "  The non-perturbative structure of the photon and gluon propagators plays an\nimportant role in governing the dynamics of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and\nquantum chromodynamics (QCD) respectively. Although it is often assumed that\nthese interacting field propagators can be decomposed into longitudinal and\ntransverse components, as for the free case, it turns out that in general this\nis not possible. Moreover, the non-abelian gauge symmetry of QCD permits the\nmomentum space gluon propagator to contain additional singular terms involving\nderivatives of $\\delta(p)$, the appearance of which is related to confinement.\nDespite the possibility of the failure of the transverse-longitudinal\ndecomposition for the photon and gluon propagators, and the appearance of\nsingular terms in the gluon propagator, the Slavnov-Taylor identity\nnevertheless remains preserved.\n", "  In this paper, we examine the potential of Higgs boson production associated\nwith a photon at the LHC to probe the new physics effects in the framework of\nthe standard model effective field theory. It is shown that the differential\nkinematic distributions such as photon transverse momentum and invariant mass\nof Higgs+$\\gamma$ in Higgs associated production are powerful variables to\nexplore the coefficients of dimension six operators. The analysis is performed\nin the decay channel of Higgs boson into a $b\\bar{b}$ pair including the main\nsources of background processes and a realistic simulation of the detector\neffects. We provide constraints at $95\\%$ confidence level on the Wilson\ncoefficients of dimension-six operators affecting Higgs boson plus a photon\nproduction. We show to what extent these limits could be improved at the high\nluminosity LHC. The effect of these constraints on a well-motivated beyond\nstandard model scenario is presented.\n", "  We introduce intertwining operators among twisted modules or twisted\nintertwining operators associated to not-necessarily-commuting automorphisms of\na vertex operator algebra. Let $V$ be a vertex operator algebra and let\n$g_{1}$, $g_{2}$ and $g_{3}$ be automorphisms of $V$. We prove that for\n$g_{1}$-, $g_{2}$- and $g_{3}$-twisted $V$-modules $W_{1}$, $W_{2}$ and\n$W_{3}$, respectively, such that the vertex operator map for $W_{3}$ is\ninjective, if there exists a twisted intertwining operator of type\n${W_{3}\\choose W_{1}W_{2}}$ such that the images of its component operators\nspan $W_{3}$, then $g_{3}=g_{1}g_{2}$. We also construct what we call the\nskew-symmetry and contragredient isomorphisms between spaces of twisted\nintertwining operators among twisted modules of suitable types. The proofs of\nthese results involve careful analysis of the analytic extensions corresponding\nto the actions of the not-necessarily-commuting automorphisms of the vertex\noperator algebra.\n", "  Effects of decoherence by wave packet separation on collective neutrino\noscillations in dense neutrino gases are considered. We estimate the length of\nthe wave packets of neutrinos produced in core collapse supernovae and the\nexpected neutrino coherence length, and then proceed to consider the\ndecoherence effects within the density matrix formalism of neutrino flavour\ntransitions. First, we demonstrate that for neutrino oscillations in vacuum the\ndecoherence effects are described by a damping term in the equation of motion\nof the density matrix of a neutrino as a whole (as contrasted to that of the\nfixed-momentum components of the neutrino density matrix). Next, we consider\nneutrino oscillations in ordinary matter and dense neutrino backgrounds, both\nin the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. In the latter case we study two\nspecific models of adiabaticity violation -- one with short-term and another\nwith extended non-adiabaticity. It is demonstrated that, while in the adiabatic\ncase a damping term is present in the equation of motion of the neutrino\ndensity matrix (just like in the vacuum oscillation case), no such term in\ngeneral appears in the non-adiabatic regime.\n", "  We describe and analyze some Monte Carlo methods for manifolds in Euclidean\nspace defined by equality and inequality constraints. First, we give an MCMC\nsampler for probability distributions defined by un-normalized densities on\nsuch manifolds. The sampler uses a specific orthogonal projection to the\nsurface that requires only information about the tangent space to the manifold,\nobtainable from first derivatives of the constraint functions, hence avoiding\nthe need for curvature information or second derivatives. Second, we use the\nsampler to develop a multi-stage algorithm to compute integrals over such\nmanifolds. We provide single-run error estimates that avoid the need for\nmultiple independent runs. Computational experiments on various test problems\nshow that the algorithms and error estimates work in practice. The method is\napplied to compute the entropies of different sticky hard sphere systems. These\npredict the temperature or interaction energy at which loops of hard sticky\nspheres become preferable to chains.\n", "  In this thesis we want to introduce the first steps towards realising a new\nmethod to investigate the cosmological parameters and conduct a detailed\nanalysis of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Toward this end, we use the current\nmodel from Grillo et al. (2015) as a template and the publicly available\nlensing code Lenstool. This code has previously been used by Jauzac et al.\n(2014), Richard et al. (2014), Jauzac et al. (2015) and Caminha et al. (2016)\nto model MACS J0416 (Grillo et al. (2015) used GLEE). We created $10$ different\nmodels to cover a reasonable set of different approaches. In addition to the\nreplication of the Grillo et al. (2015) models, with two cluster scale halos\nand 175 circular cluster member mass-density profiles, we created models using\nelliptical mass-density profiles for the cluster members and models where we\noptimize the cluster member scaling relation slopes. In order to investigate\nthe viability of using the projected total mass estimate from different\ncosmological models to estimate the cosmological parameter values, we created\n49 models each representing a different set of cosmological parameters.\n", "  The collapse of a collisionless self-gravitating system, with the fast\nachievement of a quasi-stationary state, is driven by violent relaxation, with\na typical particle interacting with the time-changing collective potential. It\nis traditionally assumed that this evolution is governed by the Vlasov-Poisson\nequation, in which case entropy must be conserved. We run N-body simulations of\nisolated self-gravitating systems, using three simulation codes: NBODY-6\n(direct summation without softening), NBODY-2 (direct summation with softening)\nand GADGET-2 (tree code with softening), for different numbers of particles and\ninitial conditions. At each snapshot, we estimate the Shannon entropy of the\ndistribution function with three different techniques: Kernel, Nearest Neighbor\nand EnBiD. For all simulation codes and estimators, the entropy evolution\nconverges to the same limit as N increases. During violent relaxation, the\nentropy has a fast increase followed by damping oscillations, indicating that\nviolent relaxation must be described by a kinetic equation other than the\nVlasov-Poisson, even for N as large as that of astronomical structures. This\nindicates that violent relaxation cannot be described by a time-reversible\nequation, shedding some light on the so-called \"fundamental paradox of stellar\ndynamics\". The long-term evolution is well described by the orbit-averaged\nFokker-Planck model, with Coulomb logarithm values in the expected range 10-12.\nBy means of NBODY-2, we also study the dependence of the 2-body relaxation\ntime-scale on the softening length. The approach presented in the current work\ncan potentially provide a general method for testing any kinetic equation\nintended to describe the macroscopic evolution of N-body systems.\n", "  By introducing a superconducting gap in Weyl- or Dirac semi-metals, the\nsuperconducting state inherits the non-trivial topology of their electronic\nstructure. As a result, Weyl superconductors are expected to host exotic\nphenomena such as non-zero-momentum pairing due to their chiral node structure,\nor zero- energy Majorana modes at the surface. These are of fundamental\ninterest to improve our understanding of correlated topological systems, and\nmoreover practical applications in phase coherent devices and quantum\napplications have been proposed. Proximity-induced superconductivity promises\nto allow such experiments on non-superconducting Weyl semi-metals. Here we show\na new route to reliably fabricating superconducting microstructures from the\nnon-superconducting Weyl semi-metal NbAs under ion irradiation. The significant\ndifference in the surface binding energy of Nb and As leads to a natural\nenrichment of Nb at the surface during ion milling, forming a superconducting\nsurface layer (Tc~3.5K). Being formed from the target crystal itself, the ideal\ncontact between the superconductor and the bulk may enable an effective gapping\nof the Weyl nodes in the bulk due to the proximity effect. Simple ion\nirradiation may thus serve as a powerful tool to fabricating topological\nquantum devices from mono-arsenides, even on an industrial scale.\n", "  We show that observations of solar $\\gamma$-rays offer a novel probe of dark\nmatter in scenarios where interactions with the visible sector proceed via a\nlong-lived mediator. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that there exists\na class of models which yield solar $\\gamma$-ray fluxes observable with the\nnext generation of $\\gamma$-ray telescopes, while being allowed by a variety of\ncurrent experimental constraints. The parameter space allowed by big bang\nnucleosynthesis and beam dump experiments naturally leads to mediator lifetimes\nsufficient to produce observable solar $\\gamma$-ray signals. The model allows\nfor solar $\\gamma$-ray fluxes up to orders of magnitude larger compared to\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies, without reaching equilibrium between dark matter\nannihilation and capture rate. Our results suggest that solar $\\gamma$-ray\nobservations are complementary, and in some cases superior, to existing and\nfuture dark matter detection efforts.\n", "  We study light propagation through a slab of cold gas using both the standard\nelectrodynamics of polarizable media, and massive atom-by-atom simulations of\nthe electrodynamics. The main finding is that the predictions from the two\nmethods may differ qualitatively when the density of the atomic sample $\\rho$\nand the wavenumber of resonant light $k$ satisfy $\\rho k^{-3}\\gtrsim 1$. The\nreason is that the standard electrodynamics is a mean-field theory, whereas for\nsufficiently strong light-mediated dipole-dipole interactions the atomic sample\nbecomes correlated. The deviations from mean-field theory appear to scale with\nthe parameter $\\rho k^{-3}$, and we demonstrate noticeable effects already at\n$\\rho k^{-3} \\simeq 10^{-2}$. In dilute gases and in gases with an added\ninhomogeneous broadening the simulations show shifts of the resonance lines in\nqualitative agreement with the predicted Lorentz-Lorenz shift and \"cooperative\nLamb shift\", but the quantitative agreement is unsatisfactory. Our\ninterpretation is that the microscopic basis for the local-field corrections in\nelectrodynamics is not fully understood.\n", "  A Type IIn supernova (SN) is dominated by the interaction of SN ejecta with\nthe circumstellar medium (CSM). Some SNe IIn (e.g., SN 2006jd) have episodes of\nre-brightening (\"bumps\") in their light curves. We present iPTF13z, a SN IIn\ndiscovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and\ncharacterised by several bumps in its light curve. We analyse this peculiar\nbehaviour trying to infer the properties of the CSM and of the SN explosion, as\nwell as the nature of its progenitor star. We obtained multi-band optical\nphotometry for over 1000 days after discovery with the P48 and P60 telescopes\nat Palomar Observatory. We obtained low-resolution optical spectra in the same\nperiod. We did an archival search for progenitor outbursts. We analyse our\nphotometry and spectra, and compare iPTF13z to other SNe IIn. A simple\nanalytical model is used to estimate properties of the CSM. iPTF13z was a SN\nIIn showing a light curve with five bumps during its decline phase. The bumps\nhad amplitudes between 0.4 and 0.9 mag and durations between 20 and 120 days.\nThe most prominent bumps appeared in all our different optical bands. The\nspectra showed typical SN IIn characteristics, with emission lines of H$\\alpha$\n(with broad component FWHM ~$10^{3}-10^{4} ~{\\rm ~km ~s^{-1}}$ and narrow\ncomponent FWHM ~$10^2 \\rm ~km ~s^{-1}$) and He I, but also with Fe II, Ca II,\nNa I D and H$\\beta$ P-Cygni profiles (with velocities of ~$10^{3}$ ${\\rm ~km\n~s^{-1}}$). A pre-explosion outburst was identified lasting $\\gtrsim 50$ days,\nwith $M_r \\approx -15$ mag around 210 days before discovery. Large, variable\nprogenitor mass-loss rates (~> 0.01 $M_{\\odot} \\rm ~yr^{-1}$) and CSM densities\n(~> 10$^{-16}$ g cm$^{-3}$) are derived. We suggest that the light curve bumps\nof iPTF13z arose from SN ejecta interacting with denser regions in the CSM,\npossibly produced by the eruptions of a luminous blue variable star.\n", "  We propose to use graphene-based Josephson junctions (gJjs) to detect single\nphotons in a wide electromagnetic spectrum from visible to radio frequencies.\nOur approach takes advantage of the exceptionally low electronic heat capacity\nof monolayer graphene and its constricted thermal conductance to its phonon\ndegrees of freedom. Such a system could provide high sensitivity photon\ndetection required for research areas including quantum information processing\nand radio-astronomy. As an example, we present our device concepts for gJj\nsingle photon detectors in both the microwave and infrared regimes. The dark\ncount rate and intrinsic quantum efficiency are computed based on parameters\nfrom a measured gJj, demonstrating feasibility within existing technologies.\n", "  The spherically symmetric accretion onto a noncommutative (NC) inspired\nSchwarzschild black hole is treated for a polytropic fluid. The critical\naccretion rate $\\dot{M}$, sonic speed $a_s$ and other flow parameters are\ngeneralised for the NC inspired black hole and compared with the results\nobtained for the standard Schwarzschild black holes. We also derive explicit\nexpressions for gas compression ratios and temperature profiles below the\naccretion radius and at the event horizon. This analysis is a generalisation of\nMichel's solution to the NC geometry. Owing to the NC corrected black hole, the\naccretion flow parameters have also been modified. It turns out that $ \\dot{M}\n\\approx {M^2}$ is still achievable but $r_s$ seems to be substantially\ndecreased due to NC effects, that in turn does affect the accretion process.\n", "  A kinetic model for studying the time evolution of the distribution function\nfor microwave start-up is presented. The model for the distribution function is\ntwo dimensional in momentum space, but, for simplicity and rapid calculations,\nhas no spatial dependence. Experiments on the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak have\nshown that the plasma current is carried mainly by electrons with energies\ngreater than $70$ keV, and effects thought to be important in these experiments\nare included, i.e. particle sources, orbital losses, the loop voltage and\nmicrowave heating, with suitable volume averaging where necessary to give terms\nindependent of spatial dimensions. The model predicts current carried by\nelectrons with the same energies as inferred from the experiments, though the\ncurrent drive efficiency is smaller.\n", "  The simulation of lattice gauge theories with tensor network (TN) methods is\nbecoming increasingly fruitful. The vision is that such methods will,\neventually, be used to simulate theories in $(3+1)$ dimensions in regimes\ndifficult for other methods. So far, however, TN methods have mostly simulated\nlattice gauge theories in $(1+1)$ dimensions. The aim of this paper is to\nexplore the simulation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) on infinite lattices\nwith TNs, i.e., fermionic matter fields coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field,\ndirectly in the thermodynamic limit. With this idea in mind we first consider a\ngauge-invariant iDMRG simulation of the Schwinger model -i.e., QED in\n$(1+1)d$-. After giving a precise description of the numerical method, we\nbenchmark our simulations by computing the substracted chiral condensate in the\ncontinuum, in good agreement with other approaches. Our simulations of the\nSchwinger model allow us to build intuition about how a simulation should\nproceed in $(2+1)$ dimensions. Based on this, we propose a variational ansatz\nusing infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) to describe the ground\nstate of $(2+1)d$ QED. The ansatz includes $U(1)$ gauge symmetry at the level\nof the tensors, as well as fermionic (matter) and bosonic (gauge) degrees of\nfreedom both at the physical and virtual levels. We argue that all the\nnecessary ingredients for the simulation of $(2+1)d$ QED are, a priori, already\nin place, paving the way for future upcoming results.\n", "  Hot Jupiters have proven themselves to be a rich class of exoplanets which\ntest our theories of planetary evolution and atmospheric dynamics under extreme\nconditions. Here, we present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations\nand analytic results which demonstrate that a dynamo can be maintained in the\nthin, stably-stratified atmosphere of a hot Jupiter, independent of the\npresumed deep-seated dynamo. This dynamo is maintained by conductivity\nvariations arising from strong asymmetric heating from the planets' host star.\nThe presence of a dynamo significantly increases the surface magnetic field\nstrength and alters the overall planetary magnetic field geometry, possibly\naffecting star-planet magnetic interactions.\n", "  The idea that dark matter may be a composite state of a hidden nonabelian\ngauge sector has received great attention in recent years. Frameworks such as\nasymmetric dark matter motivate the idea that dark matter may have similar mass\nto the proton, while mirror matter and $G \\times G$ grand unified theories\nprovide rationales for additional gauge sectors which may have minimal\ninteractions with standard model particles. In this work we explore the\nhadronic spectra that these dark QCD models can allow. The effects of the\nnumber of light colored particles and the value of the confinement scale on the\nlightest stable state, the dark matter candidate, are examined in the\nhyperspherical constituent quark model for baryonic and mesonic states.\n", "  We introduce and analyze graph-associated entanglement cost, a generalization\nof the entanglement cost of quantum states to multipartite settings. We\nidentify a necessary and sufficient condition for any multipartite entangled\nstate to be constructible when quantum communication between the multiple\nparties is restricted to a quantum network represented by a tree. The condition\nfor exact state construction is expressed in terms of the Schmidt ranks of the\nstate defined with respect to edges of the tree. We also study approximate\nstate construction and provide a second-order asymptotic analysis.\n", "  One of the fundamental open questions in cosmology is whether we can regard\nthe universe evolution without singularity like a Big Bang or a Big Rip. This\nchallenging subject stimulates one to regard a nonsingular universe in the far\npast with an arbitrarily large vacuum energy. Considering the high energy\nregime in the cosmic history, it is believed that Einstein gravity should be\ncorrected to an effective energy dependent theory which could be acquired by\ngravity's rainbow. On the other hand, employing massive gravity provided us\nwith solutions to some of the long standing fundamental problems of cosmology\nsuch as cosmological constant problem and self acceleration of the universe.\nConsidering these aspects of gravity's rainbow and massive gravity, in this\npaper, we initiate studying FRW cosmology in the massive gravity's rainbow\nformalism. At first, we show that although massive gravity modifies the FRW\ncosmology, but it does not itself remove the big bang singularity. Then, we\ngeneralize the massive gravity to the case of energy dependent spacetime and\nfind that massive gravity's rainbow can remove the early universe singularity.\nWe bring together all the essential conditions for having a nonsingular\nuniverse and the effects of both gravity's rainbow and massive gravity\ngeneralizations on such criteria are determined.\n", "  In a scalar reaction-diffusion equation, it is known that the stability of a\nsteady state can be determined from the Maslov index, a topological invariant\nthat counts the state's critical points. In particular, this implies that pulse\nsolutions are unstable. We extend this picture to pulses in reaction-diffusion\nsystems with gradient nonlinearity. In particular, we associate a Maslov index\nto any asymptotically constant state, generalizing existing definitions of the\nMaslov index for homoclinic orbits. It is shown that this index equals the\nnumber of unstable eigenvalues for the linearized evolution equation. Finally,\nwe use a symmetry argument to show that any pulse solution must have nonzero\nMaslov index, and hence be unstable.\n", "  This short article presents a summary of the NetSciEd (Network Science and\nEducation) initiative that aims to address the need for curricula, resources,\naccessible materials, and tools for introducing K-12 students and the general\npublic to the concept of networks, a crucial framework in understanding\ncomplexity. NetSciEd activities include (1) the NetSci High educational\noutreach program (since 2010), which connects high school students and their\nteachers with regional university research labs and provides them with the\nopportunity to work on network science research projects; (2) the NetSciEd\nsymposium series (since 2012), which brings network science researchers and\neducators together to discuss how network science can help and be integrated\ninto formal and informal education; and (3) the Network Literacy: Essential\nConcepts and Core Ideas booklet (since 2014), which was created collaboratively\nand subsequently translated into 18 languages by an extensive group of network\nscience researchers and educators worldwide.\n", "  We present results for the nucleon electromagnetic form factors using an\nensemble of maximally twisted mass clover-improved fermions with pion mass of\nabout 130 MeV. We use multiple sink-source separations and three analysis\nmethods to probe ground-state dominance. We evaluate both the connected and\ndisconnected contributions to the nucleon matrix elements. We find that the\ndisconnected quark loop contributions to the isoscalar matrix elements are\nsmall, giving an upper bound of up to 2$\\%$ of the connected contribution and\nsmaller than its statistical error. We present results for the isovector and\nisoscalar electric and magnetic Sachs form factors and the corresponding proton\nand neutron form factors. By fitting the momentum dependence of the form\nfactors to a dipole form or to the z-expansion we extract the nucleon electric\nand magnetic radii, as well as, the magnetic moment. We compare our results to\nexperiment as well as to other recent lattice QCD calculations.\n", "  We discuss the scattering of a quantum particle by two independent successive\npoint interactions in one dimension. The parameter space for two point\ninteractions is given by $U(2)\\times U(2)$, which is described by eight real\nparameters. We perform an analysis of perfect resonant transmission on the\nwhole parameter space. By investigating the effects of the two point\ninteractions on the scattering matrix of plane wave, we find the condition\nunder which perfect resonant transmission occurs. We also provide the physical\ninterpretation of the resonance condition.\n", "  We report the results of a direct comparison between different kinetic models\nof collisionless plasma turbulence in two spatial dimensions. The models\nconsidered include a first principles fully-kinetic (FK) description, two\nwidely used reduced models [gyrokinetic (GK) and hybrid-kinetic (HK) with fluid\nelectrons], and a novel reduced gyrokinetic approach (KREHM). Two different ion\nbeta ($\\beta_i$) regimes are considered: 0.1 and 0.5. For $\\beta_i=0.5$, good\nagreement between the GK and FK models is found at scales ranging from the ion\nto the electron gyroradius, thus providing firm evidence for a kinetic Alfv\\'en\ncascade scenario. In the same range, the HK model produces shallower spectral\nslopes, presumably due to the lack of electron Landau damping. For\n$\\beta_i=0.1$, a detailed analysis of spectral ratios reveals a slight\ndisagreement between the GK and FK descriptions at kinetic scales, even though\nkinetic Alfv\\'en fluctuations likely still play a significant role. The\ndiscrepancy can be traced back to scales above the ion gyroradius, where the FK\nand HK results seem to suggest the presence of fast magnetosonic and ion\nBernstein modes in both plasma beta regimes, but with a more notable deviation\nfrom GK in the low-beta case. The identified practical limits and strengths of\nreduced-kinetic approximations, compared here against the fully-kinetic model\non a case-by-case basis, may provide valuable insight into the main kinetic\neffects at play in turbulent collisionless plasmas, such as the solar wind.\n", "  Cascading failures are a critical vulnerability of complex information or\ninfrastructure networks. Here we investigate the properties of load-based\ncascading failures in real and synthetic spatially-embedded network structures,\nand propose mitigation strategies to reduce the severity of damages caused by\nsuch failures. We introduce a stochastic method for optimal heterogeneous\ndistribution of resources (node capacities) subject to a fixed total cost.\nAdditionally, we design and compare the performance of networks with N-stable\nand (N-1)-stable network-capacity allocations by triggering cascades using\nvarious real-world node-attack and node-failure scenarios. We show that failure\nmitigation through increased node protection can be effectively achieved\nagainst single node failures. However, mitigating against multiple node\nfailures is much more difficult due to the combinatorial increase in possible\nfailures. We analyze the robustness of the system with increasing protection,\nand find that a critical tolerance exists at which the system undergoes a phase\ntransition, and above which the network almost completely survives an attack.\nMoreover, we show that cascade-size distributions measured in this region\nexhibit a power-law decay. Finally, we find a strong correlation between\ncascade sizes induced by individual nodes and sets of nodes. We also show that\nnetwork topology alone is a weak factor in determining the progression of\ncascading failures.\n", "  We consider the Ising Field Theory (IFT), and the 3-state Potts Field Theory\n(PFT), which describe the scaling limits of the two- dimensional lattice\nq-state Potts model with q=2, and q=3, respectively. At zero magnetic field\nh=0, both field theories are integrable away from the critical point, have q\ndegenerate vacua in the ferromagnetic phase, and q(q-1) particles of the same\nmass - the kinks interpolating between two different vacua. Application of a\nweak magnetic field induces confinement of kinks into bound states - the mesons\n(for q =2,3) consisting predominantly of two kinks, and baryons (for q=3),\nwhich are essentially the three-kink excitations. The kinks in the confinement\nregime are also called the quarks. We review and refine the Form Factor\nPerturbation Theory (FFPT), adapting it to the analysis of the confinement\nproblem in the limit of small h, and apply it to calculate the corrections to\nthe kink (quark) masses induced by the multi-kink fluctuations caused by the\nweak magnetic field. It is shown that the subleading third-order correction to\nthe kink mass vanishes in the IFT. The leading second order correction to the\nkink mass in the 3-state PFT is estimated by truncation the infinite form\nfactor expansion at the first term representing contribution of the two-kink\nfluctuations into the kink self energy.\n", "  In the light of recent possible tensions in the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the\nstructure growth rate $\\sigma_8$ between the Planck and other measurements, we\ninvestigate a hidden-charged dark matter (DM) model where DM interacts with\nhidden chiral fermions, which are charged under the hidden SU(N) and U(1) gauge\ninteractions. The symmetries in this model assure these fermions to be\nmassless. The DM in this model, which is a Dirac fermion and singlet under the\nhidden SU(N), is also assumed to be charged under the U(1) gauge symmetry,\nthrough which it can interact with the chiral fermions. Below the confinement\nscale of SU(N), the hidden quark condensate spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge\nsymmetry such that there remains a discrete symmetry, which accounts for the\nstability of DM. This condensate also breaks a flavor symmetry in this model\nand Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with this flavor symmetry appear below\nthe confinement scale. The hidden U(1) gauge boson and hidden\nquarks/Nambu-Goldstone bosons are components of dark radiation (DR) above/below\nthe confinement scale. These light fields increase the effective number of\nneutrinos by $\\delta N_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 0.59$ above the confinement scale for\n$N=2$, resolving the tension in the measurements of the Hubble constant by\nPlanck and Hubble Space Telescope if the confinement scale is $\\lesssim 1$ eV.\nDM and DR continuously scatter with each other via the hidden U(1) gauge\ninteraction, which suppresses the matter power spectrum and results in a\nsmaller structure growth rate. The DM sector couples to the Standard Model\nsector through the exchange of a real singlet scalar mixing with the Higgs\nboson, which makes it possible to probe our model in DM direct detection\nexperiments. Variants of this model are also discussed, which may offer\nalternative ways to investigate this scenario.\n", "  A new generation of cold atom experiments trapping atomic mixtures in species\nselective optical potentials opens up the intriguing possibility to create\nsystems in which different atoms live in different spatial dimensions. Inspired\nby this, we investigate a mixed dimensional Bose polaron consisting of an\nimpurity particle moving in a two-dimensional (2D) layer immersed in a 3D\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC), using a theory that includes the mixed\ndimensional vacuum scattering between the impurity and the bosons exactly. We\nshow that similarly to the pure 3D case, this system exhibits a well-defined\npolaron state for attractive boson-impurity interaction that evolves smoothly\ninto a mixed-dimensional dimer for strong attraction, as well as a well-defined\npolaron state for weak repulsive interaction, which becomes over-damped for\nstrong interaction. We furthermore find that the properties of the polaron\ndepend only weakly on the gas parameter of the BEC as long as the Bogoliubov\ntheory remains a valid description for the BEC. This indicates that higher\norder correlations between the impurity and the bosons are suppressed by the\nmixed dimensional geometry in comparison to a pure 3D system, and that the\nmixed dimensional polaron has universal properties in the unitarity limit of\nthe impurity-boson interaction.\n", "  The $\\gamma N \\to \\pi^0 N$ and $\\gamma N \\to \\eta N$ reactions at photon beam\nenergies above 4 GeV are investigated within Regge models. The models include\n$t$-channel exchanges of vector ($\\rho$ and $\\omega$) and axial vector ($b_1$\nand $h_1$) mesons. Moreover, Regge cuts of $\\rho{\\mathbb P}$, $\\rho f_2$,\n$\\omega{\\mathbb P}$, and $\\omega f_2$ are investigated. A good description of\ndifferential cross sections and polarization observables at photon beam\nenergies from 4 to 15 GeV can be achieved.\n", "  We propose a scheme of loss resilient entanglement swapping between two\ndistant parties in lossy optical fibre. In this scheme, Alice and Bob each\nbegin with a pair of entangled non-classical states; these \"hybrid states\" of\nlight are entangled discrete variable (Fock state) and continuous variable\n(coherent state) pairs. The continuous variable halves of each of these pairs\nare sent through lossy optical fibre to a middle location, where these states\nare then mixed (using a 50:50 beam-splitter) and measured. The detection scheme\nwe use is to measure one of these modes via vacuum detection, and to measure\nthe other mode using homodyne detection.\n  In this work we show that the Bell state $\\lvert\\Phi^{+}\\rangle=(\\lvert\n00\\rangle+\\lvert 11\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ can theoretically be produced following\nthis scheme with high fidelity and entanglement, even when allowing for a small\namount of loss. It can be shown that there is an optimal amplitude value\n($\\alpha$) of the coherent state when allowing for such loss. We also\ninvestigate the realistic circumstance when the loss is not balanced in the\npropagating modes. We demonstrate that a small amount of loss mismatch does not\ndestroy the overall entanglement, thus demonstrating the physical practicality\nof this protocol.\n", "  Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may play an important role in mass- and\nangular momentum loss of young Sun-like stars. If occurring frequently, they\nmay also have a strong effect on planetary evolution by increasing atmospheric\nerosion. So far it has not been possible to infer the occurrence frequency of\nstellar CMEs from observations. Based on their close relation with flares on\nthe Sun, we develop an empirical model combining solar flare-CME relationships\nwith stellar flare rates to estimate the CME activity of young Sun-like and\nlate-type main-sequence stars. By comparison of the obtained CME mass-loss\nrates with observations of total mass-loss rates, we find that our modeled\nrates may exceed those from observations by orders of magnitude for the most\nactive stars. This reveals a possible limit to the extrapolation of such models\nto the youngest stars. We find that the most uncertain component in the model\nis the flare-CME association rate adopted from the Sun, which does not properly\naccount for the likely stronger coronal confinement in active stars. Simple\nestimates of this effect reveal a possible suppression of CME rates by several\norders of magnitude for young stars, indicating that this issue should be\naddressed in more detail in the future.\n", "  In quantum information processing it may be possible to have efficient\ncomputation and secure communication beyond the limitations of classical\nsystems. In a fundamental point of view, however, evolution of quantum systems\nby the laws of quantum mechanics is more restrictive than classical systems,\nidentified to a specific form of dynamics, that is, unitary transformations\nand, consequently, positive and completely positive maps to subsystems. This\nalso characterizes classes of disallowed transformations on quantum systems,\namong which positive but not completely maps are of particular interest as they\ncharacterize entangled states, a general resource in quantum information\nprocessing. Structural physical approximation offers a systematic way of\napproximating those non-physical maps, positive but not completely positive\nmaps, with quantum channels. Since it has been proposed as a method of\ndetecting entangled states, it has stimulated fundamental problems on\nclassifications of positive maps and the structure of Hermitian operators and\nquantum states, as well as on quantum measurement such as quantum design in\nquantum information theory. It has developed efficient and feasible methods of\ndirectly detecting entangled states in practice, for which proof-of-principle\nexperimental demonstrations have also been performed with photonic qubit\nstates. Here, we present a comprehensive review on quantum information\nprocessing with structural physical approximations and the related progress.\nThe review mainly focuses on properties of structural physical approximations\nand their applications toward practical information applications.\n", "  We theoretically study transport properties in one-dimensional interacting\nquasiperiodic systems at infinite temperature. We compare and contrast the\ndynamical transport properties across the many-body localization (MBL)\ntransition in quasiperiodic and random models. Using exact diagonalization we\ncompute the optical conductivity $\\sigma(\\omega)$ and the return probability\n$R(\\tau)$ and study their average low-frequency and long-time power-law\nbehavior, respectively. We show that the low-energy transport dynamics is\nmarkedly distinct in both the thermal and MBL phases in quasiperiodic and\nrandom models and find that the diffusive and MBL regimes of the quasiperiodic\nmodel are more robust than those in the random system. Using the distribution\nof the DC conductivity, we quantify the contribution of sample-to-sample and\nstate-to-state fluctuations of $\\sigma(\\omega)$ across the MBL transition. We\nfind that the activated dynamical scaling ansatz works poorly in the\nquasiperiodic model but holds in the random model with an estimated activation\nexponent $\\psi\\approx 0.9$. We argue that near the MBL transition in\nquasiperiodic systems, critical eigenstates give rise to a subdiffusive\ncrossover regime on finite-size systems.\n", "  From industry to government to academia, attracting and retaining science,\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics majors is recognized as a key element\nof the 21$^{\\text{st}}$ century knowledge economy. The ability to retain\nstudents seems to be intimately tied with understanding their immersion into\nthe academic and social system of an institution. For instance, it has been\nnoted that insufficient interactions with peers can lead to a low commitment to\nthe university and, ultimately, affect one's decision about whether to drop\nout. Since nearly half of first-time students who leave a university by the end\nof the freshman year never come back to college, the importance of\nunderstanding experiences in introductory courses as a means for improving\nstudents' persistence is particularly pronounced. We investigate students'\nexperiences in an introductory physics courses, focusing on their self-reported\nperception of the values of out-of-class collaborations. We find that, even\nthough students consider the out-of-class collaborations to be important for\nsuccess, it takes a relatively long time before they start practicing\ncollaborative learning.\n", "  Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), a kind of energetic solar eruptions, are an\nintegral subject of space weather research. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nmodeling, which requires powerful computational resources, is one of the\nprimary means of studying the phenomenon. With increasing accessibility of such\nresources, grows the demand for user-friendly tools that would facilitate the\nprocess of simulating CMEs for scientific and operational purposes. The\nEruptive Event Generator based on Gibson-Low flux rope (EEGGL), a new publicly\navailable computational model presented in this paper, is an effort to meet\nthis demand. EEGGL allows one to compute the parameters of a model flux rope\ndriving a CME via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). We provide a\nbrief overview of the physical principles behind EEGGL and its functionality.\nWays towards future improvements of the tool are outlined.\n", "  Recent experimental results point to the existence of coherent quantum\nphenomena in systems made of a large number of particles, despite the fact that\nfor many-body systems the presence of decoherence is hardly negligible and\nemerging classicality is expected. This behaviour hinges on collective\nobservables, named quantum fluctuations, that retain a quantum character even\nin the thermodynamic limit: they provide useful tools for studying properties\nof many-body systems at the mesoscopic level, in between the quantum\nmicroscopic scale and the classical macroscopic one. We hereby present the\ngeneral theory of quantum fluctuations in mesoscopic systems and study their\ndynamics in a quantum open system setting, taking into account the unavoidable\neffects of dissipation and noise induced by the external environment. As in the\ncase of microscopic systems, decoherence is not always the only dominating\neffect at the mesoscopic scale: certain type of environments can provide means\nfor entangling collective fluctuations through a purely noisy mechanism.\n", "  Cooling atoms to ultralow temperatures has produced a wealth of opportunities\nin fundamental physics, precision metrology, and quantum science. The more\nrecent application of sophisticated cooling techniques to molecules, which has\nbeen more challenging to implement due to the complexity of molecular\nstructures, has now opened door to the longstanding goal of precisely\ncontrolling molecular internal and external degrees of freedom and the\nresulting interaction processes. This line of research can leverage fundamental\ninsights into how molecules interact and evolve to enable the control of\nreaction chemistry and the design and realization of a range of advanced\nquantum materials.\n", "  The simulation of certain flow problems requires a means for modeling a free\nfluid surface; examples being viscoelastic die swell or fluid sloshing in\ntanks. In a finite-element context, this type of problem can, among many other\noptions, be dealt with using an interface-tracking approach with the\nDeforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized-Space-Time (DSD/SST) formulation. A\ndifficult issue that is connected with this type of approach is the\ndetermination of a suitable coupling mechanism between the fluid velocity at\nthe boundary and the displacement of the boundary mesh nodes. In order to avoid\nlarge mesh distortions, one goal is to keep the nodal movements as small as\npossible; but of course still compliant with the no-penetration boundary\ncondition. Standard displacement techniques are full velocity, velocity in a\nspecific coordinate direction, and velocity in normal direction. In this work,\nwe investigate how the interface-tracking approach can be combined with\nisogeometric analysis for the spatial discretization. If NURBS basis functions\nof sufficient order are used for both the geometry and the solution, both a\ncontinuous normal vector as well as the velocity are available on the entire\nboundary. This circumstance allows the weak imposition of the no-penetration\nboundary condition. We compare this option with an alternative that relies on\nstrong imposition at discrete points. Furthermore, we examine several coupling\nmethods between the fluid equations, boundary conditions, and equations for the\nadjustment of interior control point positions.\n", "  Information theory is increasingly invoked by physicists concerned with\nfundamental physics, including black hole physics. But to what extent is the\napplication of information theory in those contexts legitimate? Using the case\nof black hole thermodynamics and Bekenstein's celebrated argument for the\nentropy of black holes, I will argue that information-theoretic notions are\nproblematic in the present case. Bekenstein's original argument, as suggestive\nas it may appear, thus fails. This example is particularly pertinent to the\ntheme of the present collection because the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for\nblack hole entropy is widely accepted as 'empirical data' in notoriously\nempirically deprived quantum gravity, even though the laws of black hole\nthermodynamics have so far evaded empirical confirmation.\n", "  We review the four-loop QED corrections to the anomalous magnetic moment of\nthe muon. The fermionic contributions with closed electron and tau\ncontributions are discussed. Furthermore, we report on a new independent\ncalculation of the universal four-loop contribution and compare with existing\nresults.\n", "  A family of exact vacuum solutions, representing generalized plane waves\npropagating on the (anti-)de Sitter background, is constructed in the framework\nof Poincar\\'e gauge theory. The wave dynamics is defined by the general\nLagrangian that includes all parity even and parity odd invariants up to the\nsecond order in the gauge field strength. The structure of the solution shows\nthat the wave metric significantly depends on the spacetime torsion.\n", "  A Large Size air Cherenkov Telescope (LST) prototype, proposed for the\nCherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), is under construction at the Canary Island of\nLa Palma (Spain) this year. The LST camera, which comprises an array of about\n500 photomultipliers (PMTs), requires a precise and regular calibration over a\nlarge dynamic range, up to $10^3$ photo-electrons (pe's), for each PMT. We\npresent a system built to provide the optical calibration of the camera\nconsisting of a pulsed laser (355 nm wavelength, 400 ps pulse width), a set of\nfilters to guarantee a large dynamic range of photons on the sensors, and a\ndiffusing sphere to uniformly spread the laser light, with flat fielding within\n3%, over the camera focal plane 28 m away. The prototype of the system\ndeveloped at INFN is hermetically closed and filled with dry air to make the\nsystem completely isolated from the external environment. In the paper we\npresent the results of the tests for the evaluation of the photon density at\nthe camera plane, the system isolation from the environment, and the shape of\nthe signal as detected by the PMTs. The description of the communication of the\nsystem with the rest of detector is also given.\n", "  We report the thermoelectric transport properties in the orbital-ordered Mott\ninsulating phase of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ close to and far from equilibrium. Near\nequilibrium conditions where the temperature gradient is only applied to the\nsample, an insulating but non-monotonic temperature variation of the Seebeck\ncoefficient is observed, which is accounted for in terms of a\ntemperature-induced suppression of the orbital order. In non-equilibrium\nconditions where we have applied high electrical currents, we find that the\nSeebeck coefficient is anomalously increased in magnitude with increasing\nexternal current. The present result clearly demonstrates a non-thermal effect\nsince the heating simply causes a decrease of the Seebeck coefficient, implying\na non-trivial non-equilibrium effect such as a modification of the spin and\norbital state in currents.\n", "  Free-standing ferromagnetic nano-membranes with thicknesses below 10 nm could\neffectively be used for spin selective filtering of electrons. Such membranes\ncan work both as spin detectors in electron-spectroscopy, -microscopy and\n-diffraction as well as a source of spin polarized electrons. Theoretical\nstudies and previous work has indicated that ferromagnetic membranes of a few\nnm have Sherman functions in the 30-60 % range and would provide an effective\nalternative to current spin detection technology. Here we demonstrate the\nfabrication of gold capped Co nano-membranes with a 2.6 nm Co layer and a total\nthickness below 10 nm. The membranes have a Sherman function $S\\approx 0.41$\nand a transmission of $3.7\\times 10^{-2}$ for electron energies of 2 eV. The\nintegration of such spin-filtering membranes in a hemispherical electron\nanalyzer is shown to provide massively parallel detection capabilities and a\n\"2-dimensional\" figure of merit $FOM_\\mathrm{2D}$ = 67.2, the highest reported\nto date.\n", "  Analogue gravity studies the physics of curved spacetime in laboratory\nexperiments, where the propagation of elementary excitations in inhomogeneous\nflows is mapped to those of scalar fields in a curved spacetime metric. While\nmost analogue gravity experiments are performed in 1+1 dimensions (one spatial\nplus time) and thus can only mimic only 1+1D spacetime, we present a 2+1D\nphoton (room temperature) superfluid where the geometry of a rotating acoustic\nblack hole can be realized in 2+1D dimensions. By measuring the local flow\nvelocity and speed of waves in the superfluid, we identify a 2D region\nsurrounded by an ergo sphere and a spatially separated event horizon. This\nprovides the first direct experimental evidence of an ergosphere and horizon in\nany system, and the possibility in the future to study the analogue of Penrose\nsuperradiance from rotating black holes with quantised angular momentum and\nmodified dispersion relations.\n", "  Studying the interplay between superconductivity and quantum magnetotransport\nin two-dimensional materials has been a topic of interest in recent years.\nTowards such a goal it is important to understand the impact of magnetic field\non the charge transport at the superconductor-normal channel (SN) interface.\nHere we carried out a comprehensive study of Andreev conductance under weak\nmagnetic fields using diffusive superconductor- graphene Josephson weak links.\nWe observe that the Andreev conductance is suppressed even in magnetic fields\nfar below the upper critical field of the superconductor. The suppression of\nAndreev conductance depends on and can be minimized by controlling the ramping\nof the magnetic field. We identify that the key factor behind this suppression\nis the reduction of the superconducting gap due to the piling of vortices on\nthe superconducting contacts. In devices where superconducting gap at the\nsuperconductor-graphene interface is heavily reduced by proximity effect, the\nenlarged vortex cores overlap quickly with increasing magnetic field, resulting\nin a rapid decrease of the interfacial gap. However, in weak links with\nrelatively large effective superconducting gap the AR conductance persists up\nto the upper critical field. Our results provide guidance to the study of\nquantum material-superconductor systems in presence of magnetic field, where\n'survival' of induced superconductivity is critical.\n", "  The unique physical and optical properties of nanoparticles make their\nreliable and rapid assembly an important goal for nanotechnology. To this end,\nmany competing driving forces have been targeted to control the self-assembly,\nthough issues with reliability and efficiency indicate that interfaces on the\nnanoscale are not yet fully understood. In this letter we report for the first\ntime that the flow of water media from the interface between chemically\nnanopatterned hydrophobic surfaces and adjacent hydrophilic regions (a Janus\ninterface) can effectively be employed for rapid nanoparticle assembly with\nsingle nanoparticle resolution. We find that the dewetting of water molecules\nfrom this Janus interface drives the assembly of nanoparticles from\nelectrostatically stabilised nanoparticle colloids onto the hydrophobic areas,\nexpedited by removing the resistance to adhesion between wetted interfaces\nexerted by any hydration barrier, such that nanoparticle assembly is achieved\nin under a minute. We call this method of controlled nanoparticle assembly\nJanus Interface Nanoparticle Assembly - JINA. We then demonstrate control of\nthis mechanism through pH switching and prove its effectiveness for fabrication\nby rapidly creating single-nanoparticle sites and single particle wide lines\nwhilst simultaneously densely coating macro-scale features. Not only does this\nassembly method have far-reaching implications in nanomanufacturing, the\nunanticipated nature of this mechanism also challenges many commonly held\nassumptions about the interfacial interactions of nanoparticle self-assembly.\n", "  We theoretically study scattering process and superconducting triplet\ncorrelations in a graphene junction comprised of ferromagnet-RSO-superconductor\nin which RSO stands for a region with Rashba spin orbit interaction. Our\nresults reveal spin-polarized subgap transport through the system due to an\nanomalous equal-spin Andreev reflection in addition to conventional back\nscatterings. We calculate equal- and opposite-spin pair correlations near the\nF-RSO interface and demonstrate direct link of the anomalous Andreev reflection\nand equal-spin pairings arised due to the proximity effect in the presence of\nRSO interaction. Moreover, we show that the amplitude of anomalous Andreev\nreflection, and thus the triplet pairings, are experimentally controllable when\nincorporating the influences of both tunable strain and Fermi level in the\nnonsuperconducting region. Our findings can be confirmed by a conductance\nspectroscopy experiment and provide better insights into the proximity-induced\nRSO coupling in graphene layers reported in recent experiments.\n", "  Quantum phase transitions are sudden changes in the ground-state wavefunction\nof a many-body system that can occur as a control parameter such as a\nconcentration or a field strength is varied. They are driven purely by the\ncompetition between quantum fluctuations and mutual interactions among\nconstituents of the system, not by thermal fluctuations; hence they can occur\neven at zero temperature. Examples of quantum phase transitions in many-body\nphysics may be found in systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors\nto topological insulators. A quantum phase transition usually can be\ncharacterized by nonanalyticity/discontinuity in certain order parameters or\ndivergence of the ground state energy eigenvalue and/or its derivatives with\nrespect to certain physical quantities. Here in a circular one-dimensional spin\nmodel with Heisenberg XY interaction and no magnetic field, we observe critical\nphenomena for the $n_0=1/N\\rightarrow0$ Mott insulator caused by a qualitative\nchange of the boundary condition. We demonstrate in the vicinity of the\ntransition point a sudden change in ground-state properties accompanied by an\navoided level-crossing between the ground and the first excited states.\nNotably, our result links conventional quantum phase transitions to microscopic\nboundary conditions, with significant implications for quantum information,\nquantum control, and quantum computing.\n", "  Astrobiology is a scientific discipline that studies life in the Universe. We\ncall it a discipline and not a science because some authors have cast doubts\nover its epistemological status by calling it 'a science without an object of\nstudy'. As with astrophysics, the scientific nature of astrobiology is related\nto historical-narrative sciences and nomothetic sciences. This discipline also\nintegrates complex methodological and conceptual problems which originate from\nthe methodological and epistemological differences that exist between physics\nand biology. This is why it is so important to evidence the different\nphilosophical approaches from which its results are interpreted. After a brief\nhistorical introduction, we will consider the problem of life and we will\nanalyse the influence that different philosophical approaches have on\nastrobiology. Subsequently, we will introduce ontological and epistemological\nquestions that originate from interdisciplinarity, for example, their role in a\nphysicalistic type of reductionism and in teleology.\n", "  U-duality plays a special role in the study of the microscopic degrees of\nfreedom of supersymmetric black holes. To be consistent with duality, the black\nhole quantum degeneracy must obey special arithmetic properties, which are\nnon-perturbative in nature. In this work, we study these properties from a\nholographic point of view, establishing a connection between arithmetic\nproperties of Kloosterman sums and quantum gravity in $\\text{AdS}_2$ space. To\nthis end, we consider the entropy of black holes that carry non-primitive\ncharges, in both $\\mathcal{N}=8$ and $\\mathcal{N}=4$ four dimensional\ncompactifications; our analysis includes all the perturbative and\nnon-perturbative bulk quantum corrections. The key result relies on special\narithmetic properties of generalized Kloosterman sums that we develop. These\nare a generalization of the known Selberg identity of classical Kloosterman\nsums. In both the $\\mathcal{N}=8$ and $\\mathcal{N}=4$ examples, we recover,\nfrom the bulk quantum gravity, the non-primitive answer which is a sum over the\nprimitive degeneracies, depending non-trivially on the discrete duality\ninvariants. In particular, for the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ case we show that the\nquantum gravity answer reproduces the dependence on the torsion invariant\n$I=\\text{gcd}(Q\\wedge P)$, in agreement with the microscopic formulas. For the\n$\\mathcal{N}=8$ case, we solve a puzzle related to U-duality invariance of the\nsupergravity answer and the corresponding one-eighth BPS degeneracy.\n", "  This paper provides an overview and critical analysis on the modeling and\napplications of the dynamics of human crowds, where social interactions can\nhave an important influence on the behavioral dynamics of the crowd viewed as a\nliving, hence complex, system. The analysis looks at real physical situations\nwhere safety problems might arise in some specific circumstances. The approach\nis based on the methods of the kinetic theory of active particles.\nComputational applications enlighten the role of human behaviors.\n", "  Following [D,BDG,DR], I describe several exactly solvable families of closed\noperators. Some of these families are defined by the theory of singular rank\none perturbations. The remaining families are Schrodinger operators with\ninverse square potentials and various boundary conditions. I describe a close\nrelationship between these families. In all of them one can observe interesting\nrenormalization group flows (action of the group of dilations).\n", "  The basins of convergence, associated with the roots (attractors) of a\ncomplex equation, are revealed in the Hill problem with oblateness and\nradiation, using a large variety of numerical methods. Three cases are\ninvestigated, regarding the values of the oblateness and radiation. In all\ncases, a systematic and thorough scan of the complex plane is performed in\norder to determine the basins of attraction of the several iterative schemes.\nThe correlations between the attracting domains and the corresponding required\nnumber of iterations are also illustrated and discussed. Our numerical analysis\nstrongly suggests that the basins of convergence, with the highly fractal basin\nboundaries, produce extraordinary and beautiful formations on the complex\nplane.\n", "  - New advance technologies based on reverse engineering , design and additive\nmanufacturing, have expanded design capabilities for biomedical applications to\ninclude Patient Specific Implants (PSI). This change in design paradigms needs\nadvanced tools to assess the mechanical performance of the product, and\nsimulate the impact on the patient. In this work, we perform a structural\nanalysis on the interface of a cranial PSI under static loading conditions.\nBased on those simulations, we have identified the regions with high stress and\nstrain and checked the failure criteria both in the implant and the skull. We\nevaluate the quality of the design of the implant and determine their response\ngiven different materials, in order to ensure optimality of the final product\nto be manufactured .\n", "  Using combined experimental and computational approaches we show that at 43\nGPa and 1300 K gallium phosphide adopts the super-Cmcm structure, here\nindicated with its Pearson notation oS24. First-principles enthalpy\ncalculations demonstrate that this oS24 structure is more thermodynamically\nstable above about 20 GPa than other proposed polymorphs, such as cubic ZB and\nSC16 or the ubiquitous orthorhombic Cmcm phase (oS8). It is found that\noS24-structured GaP exhibits short P-P bonds, according to our high-resolution\nstructural analysis. Such phosphorous dimerization in GaP, observed for the\nfirst time and confirmed by ab initio calculations, sheds light on the nature\nof the super-Cmcm structure and provides critical new insights into the\nhigh-pressure polymorphism of octet semiconductors. Bond directionality and\nanisotropy, in addition to 5-fold phosphorous coordination, explain the\nrelatively low symmetry of this high-pressure structure.\n", "  Human activity follows an approximately 24-hour day-night cycle, but there is\nsignificant individual variation in awake and sleep times. Individuals with\ncircadian rhythms at the extremes can be categorized into two chronotypes:\n\"larks\", those who wake up and go to sleep early, and \"owls\", those who stay up\nand wake up late. It is well established that a person's chronotype can affect\ntheir activities and health. However, less is known on the effects of\nchronotypes on the social behavior, even though it is evident that social\ninteractions require coordinated timings. To study how chronotypes relate to\nsocial behavior, we use data collected using a smartphone app on a population\nof more than seven hundred volunteer students to simultaneously determine their\nchronotypes and social network structure. We find that owls maintain larger\npersonal networks, albeit with less time spent per contact. On average, owls\nare more central in the social network of students than larks, frequently\noccupying the dense core of the network. Owls also display strong homophily, as\nseen in an unexpectedly large number of social ties connecting owls to owls.\n", "  With the aim of performing an argument supplement to the previous paper by\nthe present authors, in this paper, a practical scheme for constructing the\nminimum weight states of the su(n)-Lipkin model in arbitrary fermion number is\ndiscussed. The idea comes from the following two points : (i) consideration on\nthe property of one-fermion transfer induced by the su(n)-generators in the\nLipkin model and (ii) use of the auxiliary su(2)-algebra presented by the\npresent authors. The form obtained under the points (i) and (ii) is simple.\n", "  Evanescent waves in a metal thin film with nonlocality are found to propagate\nin normal direction to film surface with quenched (to zero) energy dissipation\nassociated with intra-band electron transitions when wave numbers satisfy a\nresonant condition. It is shown that resonant quenching of energy dissipation\n(RQED) effect occurs in metal films with thicknesses of less or larger than,\nbut still on the order of, the nonlocality scale length. RQED ceases to exist\nin metal films whose thickness exceeds a cutoff length or in metal films with\nlocal dielectric permittivity. Resonant quenching of energy dissipation is\ncaused by destructive interference of partial contributions to electric\ndisplacement field, spatially dispersed over thin film thickness. It is\ndemonstrated that RQED effect can be used for designing a new type of plasmonic\nwaveguides, such as a slit waveguide representing a metal film with a narrow\nslit filled with a dielectric, to achieve near zero propagation losses for\nplasmonic modes with few nanometer scale confinement.\n", "  In (2+1)-dimensional pure gravity with cosmological constant, the dynamics of\ndouble torus universe with pinching parameter is investigated. Each mode of\naffine stretching deformation is illustrated in the context of horizontal\nfoliation along the holomorphic quadratic differential. The formulation of the\nEinstein Hilbert action for the parameters of the affine stretching is\ndeveloped. Then the dynamics along one holomorphic quadratic differential will\nbe solved concretely.\n", "  Since the industrial revolution, accelerated urban growth has overflown\nadministrative divisions, merged cities into large built extensions, and\nblurred the boundaries between urban and rural land-uses. These traits, present\nin most of contemporary metropolis, complicate the definition of cities, a\ncrucial issue considering that objective and comparable metrics are the basic\ninputs needed for the planning and design of sustainable urban environments. In\nthis context, city definitions that respond to administrative or political\ncriteria usually overlook human dynamics, a key factor that could help to make\ncities comparable across the urban fabric of diverse social, cultural and\neconomic realities. Using a technique based on the spectral analysis of complex\nnetworks, we rank places in 11 of the major Chilean urban regions from a\nhigh-resolution human mobility dataset: Official origin-destination (OD)\nsurveys. We propose a method for further distinguishing urban and rural\nland-uses within these regions, by means of a network centrality measure from\nwhich we construct a spectre of geographic places. This spectre, constructed\nfrom the ranking of locations as measured by their approximate number of\nembedded human flows, allows us to probe several urban boundaries. From the\nanalysis of the urban scaling exponent of trips in relation to the population\nacross these city delineations, we identify two clearly distinct scaling\nregimes occurring in urban and rural areas. The comparison of our results with\nland cover derived from remote sensing suggests that, for the case of trips,\nthe scaling exponent in urban areas is close to linear. We conclude with\nestimations for well-formed cities in the Chilean urban system, which according\nto our analysis could emerge from clusters composed by places that capture at\nleast ~138 trips (over the expectation) of the underlying mobility network.\n", "  We present a generator of virtual molecules that selects valid chemistry on\nthe basis of the octet rule. Also, we introduce a mesomer group key that allows\na fast detection of duplicates in the generated structures.\n  Compared to existing approaches, our model is simpler and faster, generates\nnew chemistry and avoids invalid chemistry. Its versatility is illustrated by\nthe correct generation of molecules containing third-row elements and a\nsurprisingly adept handling of complex boron chemistry.\n  Without any empirical parameters, our model is designed to be valid also in\nunexplored regions of chemical space. One first unexpected finding is the high\nprevalence of dipolar structures among generated molecules.\n", "  This contribution aims at presenting and generalizing a recent work of\nHernandez, Jara and Valentim [DOI:10.1016/j.spa.2016.06.026]. We consider the\nweakly asymmetric version of the so-called discrete Atlas model, which has been\nintroduced there. Precisely, we look at some equilibrium fluctuation field of a\nweakly asymmetric zero-range process which evolves on a discrete half-line,\nwith a source of particles at the origin. We prove that its macroscopic\nevolution is governed by a stochastic heat equation with Neumann or Robin\nboundary conditions, depending on the range of the parameters of the model.\n", "  This document briefly introduces the key concepts to understand the\nphenomenon of fluorescence enhancement with optical nanostructures. The\nequations remain simple, with the major goal to illustrate the different\nphysical effects at play. It also provides an overview of different recent\napproaches to enhance single molecule fluorescence with plasmonic and\nnon-plasmonic nanoantennas, and describes three main biochemical applications.\n", "  New CCD photometric observations of fourteen short-period low-mass eclipsing\nbinaries (LMB) in the photometric filters I, R and V were used for the light\ncurve analysis. There still exists a discrepancy between radii as observed and\nthose derived from the theoretical modelling for LMB in general. Mass\ncalibration of all observed LMB was done using only the photometric indices.\nThe light curve modelling of these selected systems were performed, yielding\nthe new derived masses and radii for both components. We compared these systems\nwith the compilation of other known double-lined LMB systems with uncertainties\nof masses and radii less then 5 \\%, which includes 66 components of binaries\nwhere both spectroscopy and photometry were combined together. All of our\nsystems are circular short-period binaries, and for some of them the\nphotospheric spots were also used. A purely photometric study of the light\ncurves without spectroscopy seems unable to achieve high enough precision and\naccuracy in the masses and radii to provide for a meaningful test of the M-R\nrelation for low-mass stars.\n", "  Ultrathin ferromagnetic strips with high perpendicular anisotropy have been\nproposed for the development of memory devices where the information is coded\nin tiny domains separated by domain walls. The design of practical devices\nrequires creating, manipulating and detecting domain walls in ferromagnetic\nstrips. Recent observations have shown highly efficient current-driven domain\nwall dynamics in multilayers lacking structural symmetry, where the walls adopt\na chiral structure and can be driven at high velocities. However, putting such\na device into practice requires the continuous and synchronous injection of\ndomain walls as the first step. Here, we propose and demonstrate an efficient\nand simple scheme for nucleating domain walls using the symmetry of the spin\norbit torques. Trains of short sub-nanosecond current pulses are injected in a\ndouble bit line to generate a localized longitudinal Oersted field in the\nferromagnetic strip. Simultaneously, other current pulses are injected through\nthe heavy metal under the ferromagnetic strip. Notably, the Slonczewski-like\nspin orbit torque assisted by the Oersted field allows the controlled injection\nof a series of domain walls, giving rise to a controlled manner for writing\nbinary information and, consequently, to the design of a simple and efficient\ndomain wall shift register.\n", "  A promising trend in plasmonics involves shrinking the size of\nplasmon-supporting structures down to a few nanometers, thus enabling control\nover light-matter interaction at extreme-subwavelength scales. In this limit,\nquantum mechanical effects, such as nonlocal screening and size quantization,\nstrongly affect the plasmonic response, rendering it substantially different\nfrom classical predictions. For very small clusters and molecules, collective\nplasmonic modes are hard to distinguish from other excitations such as\nsingle-electron transitions. Using rigorous quantum mechanical computational\ntechniques for a wide variety of physical systems, we describe how an optical\nresonance of a nanostructure can be classified as either plasmonic or\nnonplasmonic. More precisely, we define a universal metric for such\nclassification, the generalized plasmonicity index (GPI), which can be\nstraightforwardly implemented in any computational electronic-structure method\nor classical electromagnetic approach to discriminate plasmons from\nsingle-particle excitations and photonic modes. Using the GPI, we investigate\nthe plasmonicity of optical resonances in a wide range of systems including:\nthe emergence of plasmonic behavior in small jellium spheres as the size and\nthe number of electrons increase; atomic-scale metallic clusters as a function\nof the number of atoms; and nanostructured graphene as a function of size and\ndoping down to the molecular plasmons in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Our\nstudy provides a rigorous foundation for the further development of ultrasmall\nnanostructures based on molecular plasmonics\n", "  Covert communication offers a method to transmit messages in such a way that\nit is not possible to detect that the communication is happening at all. In\nthis work, we report an experimental demonstration of covert communication that\nis provably secure against unbounded quantum adversaries. The covert\ncommunication is carried out over 10 km of optical fiber, addressing the\nchallenges associated with transmission over metropolitan distances. We deploy\nthe protocol in a dense wavelength-division multiplexing infrastructure, where\nour system has to coexist with a co-propagating C-band classical channel. The\nnoise from the classical channel allows us to perform covert communication in a\nneighbouring channel. We perform an optimization of all protocol parameters and\nreport the transmission of three different messages with varying levels of\nsecurity. Our results showcase the feasibility of secure covert communication\nin a practical setting, with several possible future improvements from both\ntheory and experiment.\n", "  We show that for any centered stationary Gaussian process of integrable\ncovariance, whose spectral measure has compact support, or finite exponential\nmoments (and some additional regularity), the number of zeroes of the process\nin $[0,T]$ is within $\\eta T$ of its mean value, up to an exponentially small\nin $T$ probability.\n", "  The quest for designing new self-propelled colloids is fuelled by the demand\nfor simple experimental models to study the collective behaviour of their more\ncomplex natural counterparts. Most synthetic self-propelled particles move by\nconverting the input energy into translational motion. In this work we address\nthe question if simple self-propelled spheres can assemble into more complex\nstructures that exhibit rotational motion, possibly coupled with translational\nmotion as in flagella. We exploit a combination of induced dipolar interactions\nand a bonding step to create permanent linear bead chains, composed of\nself-propelled Janus spheres, with a well-controlled internal structure. Next,\nwe study how flexibility between individual swimmers in a chain can affect its\nswimming behaviour. Permanent rigid chains showed only active rotational or\nspinning motion, whereas longer semi-flexible chains showed both translational\nand rotational motion resembling flagella like-motion, in the presence of the\nfuel. Moreover, we are able to reproduce our experimental results using\nnumerical calculations with a minimal model, which includes full hydrodynamic\ninteractions with the fluid. Our method is general and opens a new way to\ndesign novel self-propelled colloids with complex swimming behaviours, using\ndifferent complex starting building blocks in combination with the flexibility\nbetween them.\n", "  This work investigates the morphological stability of a soft body composed of\ntwo heavy elastic layers, attached to a rigid surface and subjected only to the\nbulk gravity force. Using theoretical and computational tools, we characterize\nthe selection of different patterns as well as their nonlinear evolution,\nunveiling the interplay between elastic and geometric effects for their\nformation.\n  Unlike similar gravity-induced shape transitions in fluids, as the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability, we prove that the nonlinear elastic effects\nsaturate the dynamic instability of the bifurcated solutions, displaying a rich\nmorphological diagram where both digitations and stable wrinkling can emerge.\nThe results of this work provide important guidelines for the design of novel\nsoft systems with tunable shapes, with several applications in engineering\nsciences.\n", "  Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool allowing one to probe the\nstructure of quasars on sub-parsec scale. We report recent results, focusing on\nthe broad absorption and emission line regions. In particular microlensing\nreveals the intrinsic absorption hidden in the P Cygni-type line profiles\nobserved in the broad absorption line quasar H1413+117, as well as the\nexistence of an extended continuum source. In addition, polarization\nmicrolensing provides constraints on the scattering region. In the quasar\nQ2237+030, microlensing differently distorts the H$\\alpha$ and CIV broad\nemission line profiles, indicating that the low- and high-ionization broad\nemission lines must originate from regions with distinct kinematical\nproperties. We also present simulations of the effect of microlensing on line\nprofiles considering simple but representative models of the broad emission\nline region. Comparison of observations to simulations allows us to conclude\nthat the H$\\alpha$ emitting region in Q2237+030 is best represented by a\nKeplerian disk.\n", "  Georg Von Bekesy was awarded a nobel price in 1961 for his pioneering work on\nthe cochlea function in the mammalian hearing organ. He postulated that the\nplacement of sensory cells in the cochlea corresponds to a specific frequency\nof sound. This theory, known as tonotopy, is the ground of our understanding on\nthis complex organ. With the advance of technologies, this knowledge broaden\ncontinuously and seems to confirm Bekesy initial observations. However, a\nmystery still lies in the center of this organ: how does its microscopic\ntissues exactly act together to decode the sounds that we perceive?\n  One of these tissues, the Reissner membrane, forms a double cell layer\nelastic barrier separating two fundamental ducts of this organ. Yet, until\nrecently, this membrane, was not considered in the modelling of the inner ear\ndue to its smallness. Nowadays, objects of this size are at the reach of the\nmedical imagining and measuring expertise. Newly available observations coupled\nwith the increasing availability of computational resources should enable\nmodellers to consider the impact of these microscopic tissues in the inner ear\nmechanism.\n  In this report, we explore the potential fluid-structure interactions\nhappening in the inner ear, more particularly on the Reissner membrane. This\nstudy aims at answering two separate questions. Can nowadays computational\nfluid dynamics solvers simulate interaction with inner ear microscopic tissues?\nHas the Reissner membrane function on the auditory system been overlooked?\n", "  We map the phase-space trajectories of an external-cavity semiconductor laser\nusing phase portraits. This is both a visualization tool as well as a\nthoroughly quantitative approach enabling unprecedented insight into the\ndynamical regimes, from continuous-wave through coherence collapse as feedback\nis increased. Namely, the phase portraits in the intensity versus laser-diode\nterminal-voltage (serving as a surrogate for inversion) plane are mapped out.\nWe observe a route to chaos interrupted by two types of limit cycles, a\nsubharmonic regime and period-doubled dynamics at the edge of chaos. The\ntransition of the dynamics are analyzed utilizing bifurcation diagrams for both\nthe optical intensity and the laser-diode terminal voltage. These observations\nprovide visual insight into the dynamics in these systems.\n", "  This paper presents a Lyapunov based controller to stabilize and manipulate\nan observed quantum system. The proposed control is applied to the stochastic\nSchrodinger equation. In order to ensure the stability of the system at the\ndesired final state, the conventional Ito formula is further extended to the\nun-differentiable random processes. Using this extended Ito formula, a novel\nstochastic stability theorem is developed. Continued by another convergence\ntheorem, which ensured the convergence of the state trajectory to the desired\nfinal state, a complete Lyapunov based controller design scheme is developed\nfor the observed open quantum systems.\n", "  Certain reductions of the rank 2, genera 2 and 3 Hitchin systems are\nconsidered, which are shown to give an integrable system of 2, resp. 3,\ninteracting points on the line. It is shown that the reduced systems are\nparticular cases of a certain universal integrable system related to the\nLagrange interpolation polynomial. Admissibility of the reduction is proved\nusing computer technique. The corresponding codes are given in the text.\n", "  This work reports flexible fully transparent high-voltage diodes that feature\nhigh rectification ratio (Rr 10 8) and high breakdown voltage (Vb 150 V)\nsimultaneously, combined with their applications as building blocks of energy\nmanagement systems in wearable electronics where triboelectric nanogenerators\n(TENGs) are used as power source. Both experimental results and technology\ncomputer aided design (TCAD) simulations suggest that Rr and Vb can be\nmodulated by the offset length in an opposite tendency. The low reverse leakage\ncurrent (fA/MICRON) guarantees an ultra-low power consumption in standby mode,\nwhich is a core issue in wearable device applications. Besides the\nunprecedented electrical performance, the diodes exhibit good mechanical\nrobustness with minimal degradation throughout the strain and fatigue tests. By\nincorporating these high-voltage diodes into half-wave and full-wave rectifier\ncircuits, the high alternating current (AC) output voltage of TENGs is\nsuccessfully rectified into direct current (DC) voltage and charged into\nsupercapacitors (SCs), indicating their high integration and compatibility with\nTENGs, and thus their promising applications in various wearable electronic\nsystems.\n", "  Laser diodes with optical feedback can exhibit periodic intensity\noscillations at or near the relaxation-oscillation frequency. We demonstrate\noptoelectronic oscillators based on external-cavity semiconductor lasers in a\nperiodic dynamical regime tunable over the entire X-band. Moreover, unlike\nstandard optoelectronic oscillators, we need not employ the time-dependent\noptical intensity incident on a photodiode to generate the microwave signal,\nbut rather have the option of generating the electrical microwave signal\ndirectly as a voltage $V(t)$ at the laser-diode injection terminals under\nconstant current operation; no photodiode need be involved, thus circumventing\noptical-to-electrical conversion. We achieve a timing jitter of $\\lesssim 10$\nps and a quality factor of $\\gtrsim 2\\times 10^5$ across the entire X-band,\nthat ranges from 6.79 GHz to 11.48 GHz. Tuning is achieved by varying the\ninjection current $J$.\n", "  A multi-GHz chaotic optoelectronic oscillator based on an external cavity\nsemiconductor laser (ECL) is demonstrated. Unlike standard optoelectronic\noscillators for microwave applications, we do not employ the dynamic light\noutput incident on a photodiode to generate the microwave signal, but instead\ngenerate the microwave signal directly by measuring the terminal voltage V (t)\nof the laser diode of the ECL under constant-current operation, thus obviating\nthe photodiode entirely.\n", "  In the polarised Drell-Yan experiment at the COMPASS facility in CERN pion\nbeam with momentum of 190 GeV/c and intensity about $10^8$ pions/s interacted\nwith transversely polarised NH$_3$ target. Muon pairs produced in Drel-Yan\nprocess were detected. The measurement was done in 2015 as the 1st ever\npolarised Drell-Yan fixed target experiment. The hydrogen nuclei in the\nsolid-state NH$_3$ were polarised by dynamic nuclear polarisation in 2.5 T\nfield of large-acceptance superconducting magnet. Large helium dilution\ncryostat was used to cool the target down below 100 mK. Polarisation of\nhydrogen nuclei reached during the data taking was about 80 %. Two oppositely\npolarised target cells, each 55 cm long and 4 cm in diameter were used.\nOverview of COMPASS facility and the polarised target with emphasis on the\ndilution cryostat and magnet is given. Results of the polarisation measurement\nin the Drell-Yan run and overviews of the target material, cell and dynamic\nnuclear polarisation system are given in the part II.\n", "  We present an ab initio approach for the description of collective\nexcitations and transition strength distributions of arbitrary nuclei up into\nthe sd-shell that based on the No-Core Shell Model in combination with the\nLanczos strength-function method. Starting from two- and three-nucleon\ninteractions from chiral effective field theory, we investigate the electric\nmonopole, dipole, and quadrupole response of the even oxygen isotopes from 16-O\nto 24-O. The method describes the full energy range from low-lying excitations\nto the giant resonance region and beyond in a unified and consistent framework,\nincluding a complete description of fragmentation and fine-structure. This\nopens unique opportunities for understanding dynamic properties of nuclei from\nfirst principles and to further constrain nuclear interactions. We demonstrate\nthe computational efficiency and the robust model-space convergence of our\napproach and compare to established approximate methods, such as the Random\nPhase Approximation, shedding new light on their deficiencies.\n", "  We have discovered a new compound of the composition ScPd2Al3 crystallizing\nin unknown structure type. Moreover, ScPd2Al3 reveals polymorphism. We have\nfound an orthorhombic crystal structure at room temperature and a high\ntemperature cubic phase. The polymorphic phases are separated by a reversible\nfirst order transition at 1053{\\deg}C with a hysteresis of 19{\\deg}C. ScPd2Al3\nexists as a very stable intermetallic phase just in the vicinity of the\nicosahedral quasicrystal Tsai-type i-phase Al54Pd30Sc16.\n", "  The so-called principle of relativity is able to fix a general coordinate\ntransformation which differs from the standard Lorentzian form only by an\nunknown speed which cannot in principle be identified with the light speed.\nBased on a reanalysis of the Michelson-Morley experiment using this extended\ntransformation we show that such unknown speed is analytically determined\nregardless of the Maxwell equations and conceptual issues related to\nsynchronization procedures, time and causality definitions. Such a result\ndemonstrates in a pedagogical manner that the constancy of the speed of light\ndoes not need to be assumed as a basic postulate of the special relativity\ntheory since it can be directly deduced from an optical experiment in\ncombination with the principle of relativity. The approach presented here\nprovides a simple and insightful derivation of the Lorentz transformations\nappropriated for an introductory special relativity theory course.\n", "  A relativistic quantum harmonic oscillator in 3+1 dimensions is derived from\na quaternionic non-relativistic quantum harmonic oscillator. This quaternionic\nequation also yields the Klein-Gordon wave equation with a covariant\n(space-time dependent) mass. This mass is quantized and is given by\n$m_{*n}^2=m_\\omega^2\\left(n_r^2-1-\\beta\\,\\left(n+1\\right)\\right)\\,,$ where\n$m_\\omega=\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{c^2}\\,,$ $\\beta=\\frac{2mc^2}{\\hbar\\,\\omega}\\, $,\n$n$, is the oscillator index, and $n_r$ is the refractive index in which the\noscillator travels. The harmonic oscillator in 3+1 dimensions is found to have\na total energy of $E_{*n}=(n+1)\\,\\hbar\\,\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the\noscillator frequency. A Lorentz invariant solution for the oscillator is also\nobtained. The time coordinate is found to contribute a term\n$-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\hbar\\,\\omega$ to the total energy. The squared interval of a\nmassive oscillator (wave) depends on the medium in which it travels. Massless\noscillators have null light cone. The interval of a quantum oscillator is found\nto be determined by the equation, $c^2t^2-r^2=\\lambda^2_c(1-n_r^2)$, where\n$\\lambda_c$ is the Compton wavelength. The space-time inside a medium appears\nto be curved for a massive wave (field) propagating in it.\n", "  Quantum secure signature schemes have a lot of attention recently, in\nparticular because of the NIST call to standardize quantum safe cryptography.\nHowever, only few signature schemes can have concrete quantum security because\nof technical difficulties associated with the Quantum Random Oracle Model\n(QROM). In this paper, we show that code-based signature schemes based on the\nfull domain hash paradigm can behave very well in the QROM i.e. that we can\nhave tight security reductions. We also study quantum algorithms related to the\nunderlying code-based assumption. Finally, we apply our reduction to a concrete\nexample: the SURF signature scheme. We provide parameters for 128 bits of\nquantum security in the QROM and show that the obtained parameters are\ncompetitive compared to other similar quantum secure signature schemes.\n", "  In a graph or complex network, communities and anti-communities are node sets\nwhose modularity attains extremely large values, positive and negative,\nrespectively. We consider the simultaneous detection of communities and\nanti-communities, by looking at spectral methods based on various matrix-based\ndefinitions of the modularity of a vertex set. Invariant subspaces associated\nto extreme eigenvalues of these matrices provide indications on the presence of\nboth kinds of modular structure in the network. The localization of the\nrelevant invariant subspaces can be estimated by looking at particular matrix\nangles based on Frobenius inner products.\n", "  We present a microfluidic method leading to accurate measurements of the\nmutual diffusion coefficient of a liquid binary mixture over the whole solute\nconcentration range in a single experiment. This method fully exploits solvent\npervaporation through a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) membrane to obtain a\nsteady concentration gradient within a microfluidic channel. Our method is\napplicable for solutes which cannot permeate through PDMS, and requires the\nactivity and the density over the full concentration range as input parameters.\nWe demonstrate the accuracy of our methodology by measuring the mutual\ndiffusion coefficient of the water (1) $+$ glycerol (2) mixture, from\nmeasurements of the concentration gradient using Raman confocal spectroscopy\nand the pervaporation-induced flow using particle tracking velocimetry.\n", "  A set formed by five reversibly-switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs)\ndisplay spread over 40~nm in absorption maxima and only 18~nm in emission. The\nfive proteins -- Dronpa, rsFastLime, rsKame, Padron(anionic form) and bsDronpa\n-- carry exactly the same chromophore and differ just in a few mutations. Thus\nthey form an ideal set for mechanistic investigation. Starting with the results\nof molecular dynamics simulations we use QM/MM calculations to investigate the\neffects controlling the spectral tuning . In this contribution we show that the\nmodels, which are based on CASPT2//CASSCF level of QM theory, reproduce the\nobserved absorption trend with only a limited blue-shift of 4.5 kcal/mol and\nemission trend with even smaller blue-shift of 1.5 kcal/mol. Using CASSCF QM/MM\ncalculations we analyze the chromophore's charge-transfer patterns during the\nabsorption and emission, which, in turn trigger a cascade of\nhydrogen-bond-network rearrangements indicating a preparation to an\nisomerization event. We also show how the contribution of individual aminoacids\nto the chromophore conformational changes correlates with spectral tuning of\nthe absorption and emission. Furthermore, we identify how the conical\nintersection topography correlates with protein's photophysical properties. In\nconclusion, we establish a detailed mechanistic explanation of variations in\nphoto-switching speed as well as higher sensitivity of RSFPs to mutation\nobserved for light absorption relative to light emission.\n", "  The associated production of top-antitop-bottom-antibottom quarks is a\nrelevant irreducible background for Higgs boson analyses in the\ntop-antitop-Higgs production channel, with Higgs decaying into a\nbottom-antibottom quark pair. We implement this process in the PowHel event\ngenerator, considering the bottom quarks as massive in all steps of the\ncomputation which involves hard-scattering matrix-elements in the 4-flavour\nnumber scheme combined with 4-flavour Parton Distribution Functions.\nPredictions with NLO QCD + Parton Shower accuracy, as obtained by PowHel +\nPYTHIA, are compared to those which resulted from a previous PowHel\nimplementation with hard-scattering matrix-elements in the 5-flavour number\nscheme, considering as a baseline the example of a realistic analysis of\ntop-antitop hadroproduction with additional $b$-jet activity, performed by the\nCMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  Transformers and transmission lines are critical components of a grid\nnetwork. This paper analyzes the statistical properties of the electrical\nparameters of transmission branches and especially examines their\ninterdependence on the voltage levels. Some interesting findings include: (a)\nwith appropriate conversion of MVA rating, a transformers per unit reactance\nexhibits consistent statistical pattern independent of voltage levels and\ncapacity; (b) the distributed reactance (ohms/km) of transmission lines also\nhas some consistent patterns regardless of voltage levels; (c) other parameters\nsuch as the branch resistance, the MVA ratings, the transmission line length,\netc, manifest strong interdependence on the voltage levels which can be\napproximated by a power function with different power constants. The results\nwill be useful in both creation of synthetic power grid test cases and\nvalidation of existing grid models.\n", "  Interaction of an electron system with a strong electromagnetic wave leads to\nrearrangement both the electron and vibrational energy spectra of a dissipative\nsystem. For instance, the optically coupled electron levels become split in the\nconditions of the ac Stark effect that gives rise to appearance of the\nnonadiabatic coupling between the electron and vibrational motions. The\nnonadiabatic coupling exerts a substantial impact on the electron and phonon\ndynamics and must be taken into account to determine the system wave functions.\nIn this paper, the vibronic coupling induced by the ac Stark effect is\nconsidered. It is shown that the interaction between the electron states\ndressed by an electromagnetic field and the forced vibrations of reservoir\noscillators under the action of rapid changing of the electron density with the\nRabi frequency is responsible for establishment of the photoinduced vibronic\ncoupling. However, if the resonance conditions for the optical phonon frequency\nand the transition frequency of electrons in the dressed state basis are\nsatisfied, the vibronic coupling is due to the electron-phonon interaction.\nAdditionally, photoinduced vibronic coupling results in appearance of the\ndoubly dressed states which are formed by both the electron-photon and\nelectron-vibrational interactions.\n", "  Neutronic performance is investigated for a potential accident tolerant fuel\n(ATF),which consists of U$_3$Si$_2$ fuel and FeCrAl cladding. In comparison\nwith current UO$_2$-Zr system, FeCrAl has a better oxidation resistance but a\nlarger thermal neutron absorption cross section. U$_3$Si$_2$ has a higher\nthermal conductivity and a higher uranium density, which can compensate the\nreactivity suppressed by FeCrAl. Based on neutronic investigations, a possible\nU$_3$Si$_2$-FeCrAl fuel-cladding systemis taken into consideration. Fundamental\nproperties of the suggested fuel-cladding combination are investigated in a\nfuel assembly.These properties include moderator and fuel temperature\ncoefficients, control rods worth, radial power distribution (in a fuel rod),\nand different void reactivity coefficients. The present work proves that the\nnew combination has less reactivity variation during its service lifetime.\nAlthough, compared with the current system, it has a little larger deviation on\npower distribution and a little less negative temperature coefficient and void\nreactivity coefficient and its control rods worth is less important, variations\nof these parameters are less important during the service lifetime of fuel.\nHence, U$_3$Si$_2$-FeCrAl system is a potential ATF candidate from a neutronic\nview.\n", "  We study the existence and stability of Dirac nodal lines in\nthree-dimensional layered systems, whose layers individually have Dirac nodal\npoints protected by chiral (sublattice) symmetry. The model system we consider\nis the rhombohedral stack of graphene layers with each layer subjected to a\nuniform external potential that respects either AIII or BDI classes. From the\nHamiltonians in either classes, a pair of nontrivial spiraling Dirac nodal\nlines can be derived. The results are reasonable in accord to the topological\nclassification of gapless phases for codimension $2$. The nodal lines approach\neach other as the magnitude of the potential increases, revealing their\nannihilation due to the fact that regarding the full system their topological\ninvariants are cancelled out.\n", "  Although the Fluctuation-Dissipation framework is a first step to get a\nquantum model for electrical noise, the merging of displacement and conduction\ncurrents into the sole current of a series notion like the resistance R(f) does\nnot help in it this task. Used to handle these currents as orthogonal\ncomponents in electromagnetic waves, the usage of the impedance\nZ(jf)=R(f)+jX(f) for the noisy device hides the way it interacts with its\nthermal bath. In contrast to this, the admittance Y(jf) is a parallel notion\ndirectly linked with the aforementioned interaction that has led us to develop\na discrete model for current fluctuations where single electrons randomly\nshuttling between any pair of terminals generate the voltage noise we can\nmeasure between them.\n", "  Today freshwater is more important than ever before and it is contaminated\nfrom textile industry. Removal of dyes from effluent of textile using amorphous\nalloys has been studied extensively by many researchers. In this review article\nit is presented up to date development on the azo dye degradation performance\nof amorphous alloys, a new class of catalytic materials. Numerous amorphous\nalloys have been developed for increasing higher degradation efficiency in\ncomparison to conventional ones for the removal of azo dyes in wastewater. One\nof the objectives of this review article is to organize the scattered available\ninformation on various aspects on a wide range of potentially effective in the\nremoval of dyes by using amorphous alloys. This study comprises the affective\nremoval factors of azo dye such as solution pH, initial dye concentration, and\nadsorbent dosage. It was concluded that Fe, Mg, Co, Al and Mn-based amorphous\nalloys with wide availability have appreciable for removing several types of\nazo dyes from wastewater. Concerning amorphous alloys for future research, some\nsuggestions are proposed and conclusions have been drawn.\n", "  This paper presents a study on the influence of welding residual stresses\n(RS) on fatigue crack propagation rate (FCPR) in mode I. The objective of this\nwork is to develop a novel methodology that allows a variation of a RS field in\nthe studied specimen while keeping constant all other variables influencing\nFCPR. This led to the development of a novel specimen geometry, named CT-RES,\nin which RS are introduced by weld bead deposition far from the region in which\nfatigue crack propagation (FCP) occurs. As a consequence, the effect of factors\ninfluencing FCPR other than RS such as microstructural changes or plastic\ndeformation, often introduced by welding processes, can be avoided. The welding\nRS introduced in the CT-RES specimen were determined by the contour method and\nthe weight functions method was used to calculate the stress intensity factor\n(SIF), Kres, resulting from the RS as the fatigue crack propagates into the\nspecimen. The evolution of cyclic stress ratio at the crack tip, Rlocal, was\nthen computed from Kres to quantify the influence of RS on the cyclic stress\nratio. The results show that for a given stress intensity range, dK, the FCPR\nof the welded geometry with fixed externally low R ratio (R = 0.1), but\nconstantly increasing Rlocal, is the same as for the as-machined geometry\nwithout RS, solicited at high cyclic stress ratio (R = 0.7). These observations\npartially validate the BS7910 standard philosophy in which the remaining life\nof a flawed structure in presence of tensile RS is calculated from a high\ncyclic stress ratio (R > 0.5) crack propagation curve to eliminate crack\nclosure effects.\n", "  Vanadium (IV) oxide is one of the most promising materials for thermochromic\nfilms due to its unique, reversible crystal phase transition from monoclinic\n(M1) to rutile (R) at its critical temperature (T$_c$) which corresponds to a\nchange in optical properties: above T$_c$, VO$_2$ films exhibit a decreased\ntransmittance for wavelengths of light in the near-infrared region. However, a\nhigh transmittance modulation often sacrifices luminous transmittance which is\nnecessary for commercial and residential applications of this technology. In\nthis study, we explore the potential for synthesis of VO$_2$ films in a matrix\nof metal oxide nanocrystals, using In$_2$O$_3$, TiO$_2$, and ZnO as diluents.\nWe seek to optimize the annealing conditions to yield desirable optical\nproperties. Although the films diluted with TiO$_2$ and ZnO failed to show\ntransmittance modulation, those diluted with In$_2$O$_3$ exhibited strong\nthermochromism. Our investigation introduces a novel window film consisting of\na 0.93 metal ionic molar ratio VO$_2$-In$_2$O$_3$ nanocrystalline matrix,\ndemonstrating a significant increase in luminous transmittance without any\nmeasurable impact on thermochromic character. Furthermore, solution-processing\nmitigates costs, allowing this film to be synthesized 4x-7x cheaper than\nindustry standards. This study represents a crucial development in film\nchemistry and paves the way for further application of VO$_2$ nanocomposite\nfilms in chromogenic fenestration.\n", "  We present two band models for free fermion with charge conjugation symmetry\nin three dimensions. Without time reversal symmetry (TRS), the weak pairing\ngapless $A$-phase is a Majorana fermion $p_x+ip_y$ wave FFLO state while the\nstrong pairing gapped $B$-phase belongs to topologically trivial Class $D$.\nWith TRS, there is a Majorana fermion $B$-phase belonging to Class $DIII$ with\na non-zero Hopf invariant. The TRS $A$-phase is also a Majorana fermion FFLO\nstate with TRS. The surface states of the TRS $B$-phase are either a\nvalley-momentum locked Majorana-Dirac cone or a linear-quadratic mixed cone for\na specific surface. The surface states of the $A$-phase on one surface are\ntopologically nontrivial, either having $\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\ninvariant depending on whether the system is TRS or not. The edge states of\nthat surface are gapless Majorana modes. The Majorana fermion gapless FFLO\nstates can be realized in critical Weyl semimetals (WSM) in which dual single\nWeyl nodes form dipoles and are nearly annihilated. The gapped $B$-phase\nemerges when Weyl node dipoles are about to be created. The WSM TaAs-family, a\ntype-II WSM series Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$-family, possible WSM La/LuBi$_{1-x}$\nSb$_x$Te$_3$ and topological crystalline insulators Sn$_{1-x}$Pb$_x$(Te,Se) are\ncandidates to be manipulated into these critical states based on Majorana\nfermion models.\n", "  Recent studies have proposed that the diffusion of messenger molecules, such\nas monoamines, can mediate the plastic adaptation of synapses in supervised\nlearning of neural networks. Based on these findings we developed a model for\nneural learning, where the signal for plastic adaptation is assumed to\npropagate through the extracellular space. We investigate the conditions\nallowing learning of Boolean rules in a neural network. Even fully excitatory\nnetworks show very good learning performances. Moreover, the investigation of\nthe plastic adaptation features optimizing the performance suggests that\nlearning is very sensitive to the extent of the plastic adaptation and the\nspatial range of synaptic connections.\n", "  We consider the adjacency matrix associated with a graph that describes\ntransitions between $2^{N}$ states of the discrete Preisach memory model. This\nmatrix can also be associated with the last-in-first-out inventory management\nrule. We present an explicit solution for the spectrum by showing that the\ncharacteristic polynomial is the product of Chebyshev polynomials. The\neigenvalue distribution (density of states) is explicitly calculated and is\nshown to approach a scaled Devil's staircase. The eigenvectors of the adjacency\nmatrix are also expressed analytically.\n", "  This note revisits recent results regarding the geometry and moduli of\nsolutions of the heterotic string on manifolds $Y$ with a $G_2$ structure. In\nparticular, such heterotic $G_2$ systems can be rephrased in terms of a\ndifferential $\\check {\\cal D}$ acting on a complex $\\check\\Omega^*(Y , {\\cal\nQ})$, where ${\\cal Q}=T^*Y\\oplus{\\rm End}(TY)\\oplus{\\rm End}(V)$ and $\\check\n{\\cal D}$ is an appropriate projection of an exterior covariant derivative\n${\\cal D}$ which satisfies an instanton condition. The infinitesimal moduli are\nfurther parametrised by the first cohomology $H^1_{\\check {\\cal D}}(Y,{\\cal\nQ})$. We proceed to restrict this system to manifolds $X$ with an $SU(3)$\nstructure corresponding to supersymmetric compactifications to four dimensional\nMinkowski space, often referred to as Strominger--Hull solutions. In doing so,\nwe derive a new result: the Strominger-Hull system is equivalent to a\nparticular holomorphic Yang-Mills covariant derivative on ${\\cal\nQ}\\vert_X=T^*X\\oplus{\\rm End}(TX)\\oplus{\\rm End}(V)$.\n", "  I present approximate N$^3$LO theoretical results for top-antitop pair\nproduction, and for single-top production in association with a $W$ boson. The\nhigher-order corrections are from soft-gluon radiation, which is dominant near\npartonic threshold. I present results for total cross sections as well as\ntransverse-momentum and rapidity distributions of the top quark, and compare\nwith data at LHC energies.\n", "  I present theoretical calculations for charged Higgs production in\nassociation with a $W$ boson via bottom quark annihilation. I discuss\nhigher-order radiative corrections from collinear and soft gluon emission and\nshow that they are important. I present theoretical results for total cross\nsections, and for transverse-momentum and rapidity distributions of the charged\nHiggs boson at LHC energies.\n", "  We predict a huge anisotropic thermal magnetoresistance (ATMR) in the\nnear-field radiative heat transfer between magneto-optical particles when the\ndirection of an external magnetic field is changed with respect to the heat\ncurrent direction. We illustrate this effect with the case of two InSb\nspherical particles where we find that the ATMR amplitude can reach values of\nup to 800% for a magnetic field of 5 T, which is many orders of magnitude\nlarger than its spintronic analogue in electronic devices. This thermomagnetic\neffect could find broad applications in the fields of ultrafast thermal\nmanagement as well as magnetic and thermal remote sensing.\n", "  The discovery of ferroelectric properties of binary oxides revitalized the\ninterest in ferroelectrics and bridged the scaling gap between the\nstate-of-the-art semiconductor technology and ferroelectric memories. However,\nbefore hitting the markets, the origin of ferroelectricity and in-depth studies\nof device characteristics are needed. Establishing a correlation between the\nperformance of the device and underlying physical mechanisms is the first step\ntoward understanding the device and engineering guidelines for a novel,\nsuperior device. Therefore, in this paper a holistic modeling approaches which\nlead to a better understanding of ferroelectric memories based on hafnium and\nzirconium oxide is addressed. Starting from describing the stabilization of the\nferroelectric phase within the binary oxides via physical modeling the physical\nmechanisms of the ferroelectric devices are reviewed. Besides, limitations and\nmodeling of the multilevel operation and switching kinetics of ultimately\nscaled devices as well as the necessity for Landau-Khalatnikov approach are\ndiscussed. Furthermore, a device-level model of ferroelectric memory devices\nthat can be used to study the array implementation and their operational\nschemes are addressed. Finally, a circuit model of the ferroelectric memory\ndevice is presented and potential further applications of ferroelectric devices\nare outlined.\n", "  We show that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting\nin atomic systems can lead to the existence of bound states in the continuum\n(BICs) supported by trapping potentials. Such states have energies falling well\nwithin the continuum spectrum, but nevertheless they are localized and fully\nradiationless. We report the existence of BICs, in some cases in exact\nanalytical form, in systems with tunable spin-orbit coupling and show that the\nphenomenon is physically robust. We also found that BIC states may be excited\nin spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates, where under suitable\nconditions they may be metastable with remarkably long lifetimes.\n", "  We provide examples of operators $T(D)+V$ with decaying potentials that have\nembedded eigenvalues. The decay of the potential depends on the curvature of\nthe Fermi surfaces of constant kinetic energy $T$. We make the connection to\ncounterexamples in Fourier restriction theory.\n", "  International efforts play a key role in driving all areas of astrophysics.\nStrategic planning is essential to explore possible partnerships and joint\nprojects that otherwise could not be afforded, and to maximize their scientific\nreturn. For these reasons, the International Astronomical Union (IAU)\nestablished in 2016 the Working Group on Global Coordination of Ground and\nSpace Astrophysics. The Working Group held a Kavli IAU Workshop on \"Global\nCoordination: Future Space-Based Ultraviolet-Optical-Infrared Telescopes\" in\nJuly 2017, bringing together scientific leaders from 17 countries to discuss\ncompelling science drivers, technical requirements, political constraints, and\nopportunities for a future large-scale UV/optical/Infrared space mission. This\nreport summarizes the workshop and recommends that astronomers worldwide\nintensify their activities to explore the possibilities for science with such a\nmission, including consideration of instrumentation and technology definition\nand development, construction, launch, data analysis, and complementary\nscience.
