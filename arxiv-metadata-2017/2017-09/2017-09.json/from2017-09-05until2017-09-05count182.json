This has vexed physicists for several decades now. In\nthis connection we deduce a formula that gives the masses of all known\nelementary particles, even though other quantum numbers are suppressed. These\nconsiderations become important in view of the LHC which is expected to attain\n14 TeV by 2013.\n", "  We present a new result based on an analysis of the data collected by the MEG\ndetector at the Paul Scherrer Institut in 2009 and 2010, in search of the\nlepton flavour violating decay mu->e gamma. The likelihood analysis of the\ncombined data sample, which corresponds to a total of 1.8 x 10**14 muon decays,\ngives a 90% C.L. upper limit of 2.4 x 10**-12 on the branching ratio of the\nmu->e gamma decay, constituting the most stringent limit on the existence of\nthis decay to date.\n", "  Using gauge-gravity duality, we extend thermodynamic studies and present\nresults for thermal screening masses in strongly coupled N=2* supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory. This non-conformal theory is a mass deformation of maximally\nsupersymmetric N=4 gauge theory. Results are obtained for the entropy density,\npressure, specific heat, equation of state, and screening masses, down to\npreviously unexplored low temperatures. The temperature dependence of screening\nmasses in various symmetry channels, which characterize the longest length\nscales over which thermal fluctuations in the non-Abelian plasma are\ncorrelated, is examined and found to be asymptotically linear in the low\ntemperature regime.\n", "  In this dissertation a simple Hamiltonian for a system of inter-acting\nmolecules and radiation field is developed from a model of N Two-Level\nMolecules interacting, via a dipole approximation, with a single mode,\nquantized radiation field. The exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this\nHamiltonian are compared with analytical results obtained from several\ndifferent approximation schemes applied to the simple model. The consequence of\nthis comparison is the development of validity criteria for the utilization of\nthese approximation schemes to more difficult problems. For example, an\nanalysis done here indicates that using an independent molecule approximation\nin an explanation of the \"build up\" of coherent radiation in a gas laser\n(maser) may be inappropriate.\n", "  Community detection in networks is a key exploratory tool with applications\nin a diverse set of areas, ranging from finding communities in social and\nbiological networks to identifying link farms in the World Wide Web. The\nproblem of finding communities or clusters in a network has received much\nattention from statistics, physics and computer science. However, most\nclustering algorithms assume knowledge of the number of clusters k. In this\npaper we propose to automatically determine k in a graph generated from a\nStochastic Blockmodel. Our main contribution is twofold; first, we\ntheoretically establish the limiting distribution of the principal eigenvalue\nof the suitably centered and scaled adjacency matrix, and use that distribution\nfor our hypothesis test. Secondly, we use this test to design a recursive\nbipartitioning algorithm. Using quantifiable classification tasks on real world\nnetworks with ground truth, we show that our algorithm outperforms existing\nprobabilistic models for learning overlapping clusters, and on unlabeled\nnetworks, we show that we uncover nested community structure.\n", "  We present a bit-string quantum oblivious transfer protocol based on\nsingle-qubit rotations. Our protocol is built upon a previously proposed\nquantum public-key protocol and its practical security relies on the laws of\nQuantum Mechanics. Practical security is reflected in the fact that, due to\ntechnological limitations, the receiver (Bob) of the transferred bit-string is\nrestricted to performing only \"few-qubit\" coherent measurements. We also\npresent a single-bit oblivious transfer based on the proposed bit-string\nprotocol. The protocol can be implemented with current technology based on\noptics.\n", "  We show that the stationary density fluctuations of exclusion processes with\nlong jumps, whose rates are of the form $c^\\pm |y-x|^{-(1+\\alpha)}$ where\n$c\\pm$ depends on the sign of $y-x$, are given by a fractional\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process for $\\alpha \\in (0,\\frac{3}{2})$. When $\\alpha\n=\\frac{3}{2}$ we show that the density fluctuations are tight, in a suitable\ntopology, and that any limit point is an energy solution of the fractional\nBurgers equation, previously introduced in \\cite{GubJar} in the finite volume\nsetting.\n", "  Reshetikhin-Turaev (a.k.a. Chern-Simons) TQFT is a functor that associates\nvector spaces to two-dimensional genus g surfaces and linear operators to\nautomorphisms of surfaces. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that\nthere exists a Macdonald q,t-deformation -- refinement -- of these operators\nthat preserves the defining relations of the mapping class groups beyond genus\n1. For this we explicitly construct the refined TQFT representation of the\ngenus 2 mapping class group in the case of rank one TQFT. This is a direct\ngeneralization of the original genus 1 construction of arXiv:1105.5117, opening\na question if it extends to any genus. Our construction is built upon a\nq,t-deformation of the square of q-6j symbol of U_q(sl_2), which we define\nusing the Macdonald version of Fourier duality. This allows to compute the\nrefined Jones polynomial for arbitrary knots in genus 2. In contrast with genus\n1, the refined Jones polynomial in genus 2 does not appear to agree with the\nPoincare polynomial of the triply graded HOMFLY knot homology.\n", "  We report the propagation of high-intensity sound beams in a sonic crystal,\nunder self-collimation or reduced-divergence conditions. The medium is a fluid\nwith elastic quadratic nonlinearity, where the dominating nonlinear effect is\nharmonic generation. The conditions for the efficient generation of narrow,\nnon-diverging beam of second harmonic are discussed. Numerical simulations are\nin agreement with the analytical predictions made, based on the linear\ndispersion characteristics in modulated media and the nonlinear interaction in\na quadratic medium under phase matching conditions.\n", "  We use a novel technique to experimentally explore transport properties\nthrough a single metallic nanoparticle with variable coupling to electric\nleads. For strong dot-lead coupling the conductance is an oscillatory function\nof the gate voltage with periodicity determined by the charging energy, as\nexpected. For weaker coupling we observe the appearance of additional\nmulti-periodic oscillations of the conductance with the gate voltage. These\nharmonics correspond to a change of the charge on the dot by a fraction of an\nelectron. This notion is supported by theoretical calculations based on\ndissipative action theory. Within this framework the multiple periodicity of\nthe conductance oscillations arises due to non-pertubative instanton solutions.\n", "  It is argued that the multiplicity distribution in proton-proton ($pp$)\ncollisions, which is often parameterized by the negative binomial distribution,\nmay result from the multiplicity distribution measured in electron-positron\n($e^{+}e^{-}$) collisions, once the fluctuating energy carried by two leading\nprotons in $pp$ is taken into account.\n", "  In scientific computing, it is time-consuming to calculate an inverse\noperator ${\\mathscr A}^{-1}$ of a differential equation ${\\mathscr A}\\varphi =\nf$, especially when ${\\mathscr A}$ is a highly nonlinear operator. In this\npaper, based on the homotopy analysis method (HAM), a new approach, namely the\nmethod of directly defining inverse mapping (MDDiM), is proposed to gain\nanalytic approximations of nonlinear differential equations. In other words,\none can solve a nonlinear differential equation ${\\mathscr A}\\varphi = f$ by\nmeans of directly defining an inverse mapping $\\mathscr J$, i.e. without\ncalculating any inverse operators. Here, the inverse mapping $\\mathscr J$ is\neven unnecessary to be explicitly expressed in a differential form, since\n\"mapping\" is a more general concept than \"differential operator\". To guide how\nto directly define an inverse mapping $\\mathscr J$, some rules are provided.\nBesides, a convergence theorem is proved, which guarantees that a convergent\nseries solution given by the MDDiM must be a solution of problems under\nconsideration. In addition, three nonlinear differential equations are used to\nillustrate the validity and potential of the MDDiM, and especially the great\nfreedom and large flexibility of directly defining inverse mappings for various\ntypes of nonlinear problems. The method of directly defining inverse mapping\n(MDDiM) might open a completely new, more general way to solve nonlinear\nproblems in science and engineering, which is fundamentally different from\ntraditional methods.\n", "  Terrestrial planets are thought to be the result of a vast number of\ngravitational interactions and collisions between smaller bodies. We use\nnumerical simulations to show that practically identical initial conditions\nresult in a wide array of final planetary configurations. This is a result of\nthe chaotic evolution of trajectories which are highly sensitive to minuscule\ndisplacements. We determine that differences between systems evolved from\nvirtually identical initial conditions can be larger than the differences\nbetween systems evolved from very different initial conditions. This implies\nthat individual simulations lack predictive power. For example, there is not a\nreproducible mapping between the initial and final surface density profiles.\nHowever, some key global properties can still be extracted if the statistical\nspread across many simulations is considered. Based on these spreads, we\nexplore the collisional growth and orbital properties of terrestrial planets\nwhich assemble from different initial conditions (we vary the initial\nplanetesimal distribution, planetesimal masses, and giant planet orbits).\nConfirming past work, we find that the resulting planetary systems are sculpted\nby sweeping secular resonances. Configurations with giant planets on eccentric\norbits produce fewer and more massive terrestrial planets on tighter orbits\nthan those with giants on circular orbits. This is further enhanced if the\ninitial mass distribution is biased to the inner regions. In all cases, the\nouter edge of the system is set by the final location of the $\\nu_6$ resonance\nand we find that the mass distribution peaks at the $\\nu_5$ resonance. Using\nexisting observations, we find that extrasolar systems follow similar trends.\nAlthough differences between our numerical modelling and exoplanetary systems\nremain, we suggest that CoRoT-7, HD 20003, and HD 20781 may host undetected\ngiant planets.\n", "  Understanding the limiting behavior of eigenvalues of random matrices is the\ncentral problem of random matrix theory. Classical limit results are known for\nmany models, and there has been significant recent progress in obtaining more\nquantitative, non-asymptotic results. In this paper, we describe a systematic\napproach to bounding rates of convergence and proving tail inequalities for the\nempirical spectral measures of a wide variety of random matrix ensembles. We\nillustrate the approach by proving asymptotically almost sure rates of\nconvergence of the empirical spectral measure in the following ensembles:\nWigner matrices, Wishart matrices, Haar-distributed matrices from the compact\nclassical groups, powers of Haar matrices, randomized sums and random\ncompressions of Hermitian matrices, a random matrix model for the Hamiltonians\nof quantum spin glasses, and finally the complex Ginibre ensemble. Many of the\nresults appeared previously and are being collected and described here as\nillustrations of the general method; however, some details (particularly in the\nWigner and Wishart cases) are new.\n  Our approach makes use of techniques from probability in Banach spaces, in\nparticular concentration of measure and bounds for suprema of stochastic\nprocesses, in combination with more classical tools from matrix analysis,\napproximation theory, and Fourier analysis. It is highly flexible, as evidenced\nby the broad list of examples. It is moreover based largely on \"soft\" methods,\nand involves little hard analysis.\n", "  Numerous Lie supergroups do not admit superunitary representations except the\ntrivial one, e.g., Heisenberg and orthosymplectic supergroups in mixed\nsignature. To avoid this situation, we introduce in this paper a broader\ndefinition of superunitary representation, relying on a new definition of\nHilbert superspace. The latter is inspired by the notion of Krein space and was\ndeveloped initially for noncommutative supergeometry. For Heisenberg\nsupergroups, this new approach yields a smooth generalization, whatever the\nsignature, of the unitary representation theory of the classical Heisenberg\ngroup. First, we obtain Schrodinger-like representations by quantizing generic\ncoadjoint orbits. They satisfy the new definition of irreducible superunitary\nrepresentations and serve as ground to the main result of this paper: a\ngeneralized Stone-von Neumann theorem. Then, we obtain the superunitary dual\nand build a group Fourier transformation, satisfying Parseval theorem. We\neventually show that metaplectic representations, which extend Schrodinger-like\nrepresentations to metaplectic supergroups, also fit into this definition of\nsuperunitary representations.\n", "  Consider the product $GX$ of two rectangular complex random matrices coupled\nby a constant matrix $\\Omega$, where $G$ can be thought to be a Gaussian matrix\nand $X$ is a bi-invariant polynomial ensemble. We prove that the squared\nsingular values form a biorthogonal ensemble in Borodin's sense, and further\nthat for $X$ being Gaussian the correlation kernel can be expressed as a double\ncontour integral. When all but finitely many eigenvalues of $\\Omega^{}\n\\Omega^{*}$ are equal, the corresponding correlation kernel is shown to admit a\nphase transition phenomenon at the hard edge in four different regimes as the\ncoupling matrix changes. Specifically, the four limiting kernels in turn are\nthe Meijer G-kernel for products of two independent Gaussian matrices, a new\ncritical and interpolating kernel, the perturbed Bessel kernel and the finite\ncoupled product kernel associated with $GX$. In the special case that $X$ is\nalso a Gaussian matrix and $\\Omega$ is scalar, such a product has been recently\ninvestigated by Akemann and Strahov. We also propose a Jacobi-type product and\nprove the same transition.\n", "  The plasma response from an external n = 2 magnetic perturbation field in\nASDEX Upgrade has been measured using mainly electron cyclotron emission (ECE)\ndiagnostics and a rigid rotating field. To interpret ECE and ECE-imaging\n(ECE-I) measurements accurately, forward modeling of the radiation transport\nhas been combined with ray tracing. The measured data is compared to synthetic\nECE data generated from a 3D ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equilibrium\ncalculated by VMEC. The measured amplitudes of the helical displacement around\nthe low field side midplane are in reasonable agreement with the one from the\nsynthetic VMEC diagnostics. Both exceed the prediction from the vacuum field\ncalculations and indicate the presence of a kink response at the edge, which\namplifies the perturbation. VMEC and MARS-F have been used to calculate the\nproperties of this kink mode. The poloidal mode structure of the magnetic\nperturbation of this kink mode at the edge peaks at poloidal mode numbers\nlarger than the resonant components |m| > |nq|, whereas the poloidal mode\nstructure of its displacement is almost resonant |m| ~ |nq|. This is expected\nfrom ideal MHD in the proximity of rational surfaces. The displacement measured\nby ECE-I confirms this resonant response.\n", "  The emergence of location-based social networks provides an unprecedented\nchance to study the interaction between human mobility and social relations.\nThis work is a step towards quantifying whether a location is suitable for\nconducting social activities, and the notion is named location sociality. Being\nable to quantify location sociality creates practical opportunities such as\nurban planning and location recommendation. To quantify a location's sociality,\nwe propose a mixture model of HITS and PageRank on a heterogeneous network\nlinking users and locations. By exploiting millions of check-in data generated\nby Instagram users in New York and Los Angeles, we investigate the relation\nbetween location sociality and several location properties, including location\ncategories, rating and popularity. We further perform two case studies, i.e.,\nfriendship prediction and location recommendation, experimental results\ndemonstrate the usefulness of our quantification.\n", "  If we add one neutron to doubly magic ^{100}Sn, we can associate the low\nlying states in^{101} Sn with single particle states.The the J=5/2^{+} and J=\n7/2^{+} states are identified as d_{5/2}and g_{7/2}states respectively...They\nare separated by an energy of 0.18 MeV.Unfortunately there is a disputeas to\nthe ordering of these states.We examine how the 2 scenarios-- J=5/2^{+} ground\nstate or J=7/2^{+}ground state-- affect spectra of higher Sn isotopes .\n", "  Contextuality is usually defined as absence of a joint distribution for a set\nof measurements (random variables) with known joint distributions of some of\nits subsets. However, if these subsets of measurements are not disjoint,\ncontextuality is mathematically impossible even if one generally allows (as one\nmust) for random variables not to be jointly distributed. To avoid\ncontradictions one has to adopt the Contextuality-by-Default approach:\nmeasurements made in different contexts are always distinct and stochastically\nunrelated to each other. Contextuality is reformulated then in terms of the\n(im)possibility of imposing on all the measurements in a system a joint\ndistribution of a particular kind: such that any measurements of one and the\nsame property made in different contexts satisfy a specified property,\n$\\mathcal{C}$. In the traditional analysis of contextuality $\\mathcal{C}$ means\n\"are equal to each other with probability 1\". However, if the system of\nmeasurements violates the \"no-disturbance principle\", due to signaling or\nexperimental biases, then the meaning of $\\mathcal{C}$ has to be generalized,\nand the proposed generalization is \"are equal to each other with maximal\npossible probability\" (applied to any set of measurements of one and the same\nproperty). This approach is illustrated on arbitrary systems of binary\nmeasurements, including most of quantum systems of traditional interest in\ncontextuality studies (irrespective of whether \"no-disturbance\" principle holds\nin them).\n", "  Background: Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a\npopular tool for structural determination of biological macromolecular\ncomplexes. High-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction often requires hundreds of\nthousands of single-particle images. Particle extraction from experimental\nmicrographs thus can be laborious and presents a major practical bottleneck in\ncryo-EM structural determination. Existing computational methods of particle\npicking often use low-resolution templates as inputs for particle matching,\nmaking it possible to cause reference-dependent bias. It is critical to develop\na highly efficient template-free method to automatically recognize particle\nimages from cryo-EM micrographs. Results: We developed a deep learning-based\nalgorithmic framework, DeepEM, for single-particle recognition from noisy\ncryo-EM micrographs, enabling automated particle picking, selection and\nverification in an integrated fashion. The kernel of DeepEM is built upon a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) of eight layers, which can be recursively\ntrained to be highly \"knowledgeable\". Our approach exhibits improved\nperformance and high precision when tested on the standard KLH dataset.\nApplication of DeepEM to several challenging experimental cryo-EM datasets\ndemonstrates its capability in avoiding selection of un-wanted particles and\nnon-particles even when true particles contain fewer features. Conclusions: The\nDeepEM method derived from a deep CNN allows automated particle extraction from\nraw cryo-EM micrographs in the absence of templates, which demonstrated\nimproved performance, objectivity and accuracy. Application of this novel\napproach is expected to free the labor involved in single-particle\nverification, thus promoting the efficiency of cryo-EM data processing.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum of graphene plasmons\nwhich arise when a pair of sheets are confined between conducting materials.\nThe associated enhanced local fields may be employed in the manipulation of\nlight on the nanoscale by adjusting the separation between the graphene layers,\nthe energy band gap as well as the concentration of charge carriers in the\nconducting media surrounding the two-dimensional (2D) layers. We present a\ntheoretical formalism, based on the calculation of the surface response\nfunction, for determining the plasmon spectrum of an encapsulated pair of 2D\nlayers and apply it to graphene. We solve the coupled equations involving the\ncontinuity of the electric potential and discontinuity of the electric field at\nthe interfaces separating the constituents of the hybrid structure. We have\ncompared the plasmon modes for encapsulated gapped and gapless graphene. The\nassociated nonlocal graphene plasmon spectrum coupled to the \"sandwich\" system\nshow a linear acoustic plasmon mode as well as a low-frequency mode\ncorresponding to in-phase oscillations of the adjacent 2D charge densities.\nThese calculations are relevant to the study of energy transfer via plasmon\nexcitations when graphene is confined by a pair of thick conducting materials.\n", "  We numerically solve the equations of motion (EOM) for two models of circular\ncosmic string loops with windings in a simply connected internal space. Since\nthe windings cannot be topologically stabilized, stability must be achieved (if\nat all) dynamically. As toy models for realistic compactifications, we consider\nwindings on a small section of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is valid as an\napproximation to any simply connected internal manifold if the winding radius\nis sufficiently small, and windings on an $S^2$ of constant radius\n$\\mathcal{R}$. We then use Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory to analyze the\nJacobi stability of the string equations and determine bounds on the physical\nparameters that ensure dynamical stability of the windings. We find that, for\nthe same initial conditions, the curvature and topology of the internal space\nhave nontrivial effects on the microscopic behavior of the string in the higher\ndimensions, but that the macroscopic behavior is remarkably insensitive to the\ndetails of the motion in the compact space. This suggests that\nhigher-dimensional signatures may be extremely difficult to detect in the\neffective $(3+1)$-dimensional dynamics of strings compactified on an internal\nspace, even if configurations with nontrivial windings persist over long time\nperiods.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale topological spin structures offering great\npromise for next-generation information storage technologies. The recent\ndiscovery of sub-100 nm room temperature (RT) skyrmions in several multilayer\nfilms has triggered vigorous efforts to modulate their physical properties for\ntheir use in devices. Here we present a tunable RT skyrmion platform based on\nmultilayer stacks of Ir/Fe/Co/Pt, which we study using X-ray microscopy,\nmagnetic force microscopy and Hall transport techniques. By varying the\nferromagnetic layer composition, we can tailor the magnetic interactions\ngoverning skyrmion properties, thereby tuning their thermodynamic stability\nparameter by an order of magnitude. The skyrmions exhibit a smooth crossover\nbetween isolated (metastable) and disordered lattice configurations across\nsamples, while their size and density can be tuned by factors of 2 and 10\nrespectively. We thus establish a platform for investigating functional sub-50\nnm RT skyrmions, pointing towards the development of skyrmion-based memory\ndevices.\n", "  A high NMR detection sensitivity is indispensable when dealing with mass and\nvolume-limited samples, or whenever a high spatial resolution is required. The\nuse of miniaturised RF coils is a proven way to increase sensitivity, but may\nbe impractical and is not applicable to every experimental situation. We\npresent the use of magnetic lenses, denoted as Lenz lenses due to their working\nprinciple, to focus the magnetic flux of a macroscopic RF coil into a smaller\nvolume and thereby locally enhance the sensitivity of the NMR experiment - at\nthe expense of the total sensitive volume. Besides focusing, such lenses\nfacilitate re-guiding or re-shaping of magnetic fields much like optical lenses\ndo with light beams. For the first time we experimentally demonstrate the use\nof Lenz lenses in magnetic resonance and provide a compact mathematical\ndescription of the working principle. Through simulations we show that optimal\narrangements can be found.\n", "  We study the question of what kind of a macroscopic superposition can(not)\nnaturally exist as a ground state of some gapped local many-body Hamiltonian.\nWe derive an upper bound on the energy gap of an arbitrary physical Hamiltonian\nprovided that its ground state is a superposition of two well-distinguishable\nmacroscopic \"semi-classical\" states. For a large class of macroscopic\nsuperposition states we show that the gap vanishes in the macroscopic limit.\nThis in turn shows that preparation of such states by simple cooling to the\nground state is not experimentally feasible and requires different strategy.\nOur approach is very general and can be used to rule out a variety of quantum\nstates, some of which do not even exhibit macroscopic quantum properties.\nMoreover, our methods and results can be used for addressing quantum marginal\nrelated problems.\n", "  In this paper, we study some control problems that derive from time optimal\ncontrol of coupled spin dynamics in NMR spectroscopy and quantum information\nand computation. Time optimal control helps to minimize relaxation losses. The\nability to synthesize, local unitaries, much more rapidly than evolution of\ncouplings, gives a natural time scale separation in these problems. The\ngenerators of evolution, $\\g$, are decomposed into fast generators $\\k$ (local\nHamiltonians) and slow generators $\\p$ (couplings) as a Cartan decomposition\n$\\g = \\p \\oplus \\k$. Using this decomposition, we exploit some convexity ideas\nto completely characterize the reachable set and time optimal control for these\nproblems. In this paper, we carry out a second order analysis of time\noptimality.\n", "  The next generation interferometric radio telescope, the Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA), which will be the most sensitive and largest radio telescope ever\nconstructed, could greatly contribute to the detection, survey and\ncharacterization of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). By the SKA, it will be possible to\nperform the follow up of GRBs even for several months. This approach would be\nextremely useful to extend the Spectrum Energetic Distribution (SED) from the\ngamma to the to radio band and would increase the number of radio detectable\nGRBs. In principle, the SKA could help to understand the physics of GRBs by\nsetting constraints on theoretical models. This goal could be achieved by\ntaking into account multiple observations at different wavelengths in order to\nobtain a deeper insight of the sources. Here, we present an estimation of GRB\nradio detections, showing that the GRBs can really be observed by the SKA. The\napproach that we present consists in determining blind detection rates derived\nby a very large sample consisting of merging several GRB catalogues observed by\ncurrent missions as Swift, Fermi, Agile and INTEGRAL and by previous missions\nas BeppoSAX, CGRO, GRANAT, HETE-2, Ulysses and Wind. The final catalogue counts\n7516 distinct sources. We compute the fraction of GRBs that could be observed\nby the SKA at high and low frequencies, above its observable sky. Considering\nthe planned SKA sensitivity and through an extrapolation based on previous\nworks and observations, we deduce the minimum fluence in the range 15-150 keV.\nThis is the energy interval where a GRB should emit to be detectable in the\nradio band by the SKA. Results seem consistent with observational capabilities.\n", "  We selected 82 u-band variable objects based on the u-band photometry data\nfrom SCUSS and SDSS, in the field of LAMOST Complete Spectroscopic Survey of\nPointing Area at Southern Galactic Cap. The magnitude variation of the targets\nis restricted to larger than 0.2 mag and limiting magnitude down to 19.0 mag in\nu-band. According to the spectra from LAMOST, there are 11 quasars with\nred-shift between 0.4 and 1.8, 60 variable stars and 11 unidentified targets.\nThe variable stars include one active M-dwarf with a series of Balmer emission\nlines, seven Horizontal Branch stars containing six RR Lyrae stars matching\nwith SIMBAD, and one giant, one AGB star and two RR Lyrae candidates by\ndifferent colour selections. All these variable stars mainly locate near the\nmain sequence in the g-r verse u-g diagram. The quasars are well distinguished\nfrom stars by both u-g colour and variation in u-band.\n", "  We establish a topological criterion for connection between reducibility to\nconstant rotations and dual localization, for the general family of analytic\nquasiperiodic Jacobi operators. As a corollary, we obtain the sharp arithmetic\nphase transition for the extended Harper's model in the positive Lyapunov\nexponent region.\n", "  Privacy amplification is the task by which two cooperating parties transform\na shared weak secret, about which an eavesdropper may have side information,\ninto a uniformly random string uncorrelated from the eavesdropper. Privacy\namplification against passive adversaries, where it is assumed that the\ncommunication is over a public but authenticated channel, can be achieved in\nthe presence of classical as well as quantum side information by a\nsingle-message protocol based on strong extractors.\n  In 2009 Dodis and Wichs devised a two-message protocol to achieve privacy\namplification against active adversaries, where the public communication\nchannel is no longer assumed to be authenticated, through the use of a\nstrengthening of strong extractors called non-malleable extractors which they\nintroduced. Dodis and Wichs only analyzed the case of classical side\ninformation.\n  We consider the task of privacy amplification against active adversaries with\nquantum side information. Our main result is showing that the Dodis-Wichs\nprotocol remains secure in this scenario provided its main building block, the\nnon-malleable extractor, satisfies a notion of quantum-proof non-malleability\nwhich we introduce. We show that an adaptation of a recent construction of\nnon-malleable extractors due to Chattopadhyay et al. is quantum proof, thereby\nproviding the first protocol for privacy amplification that is secure against\nactive quantum adversaries. Our protocol is quantitatively comparable to the\nnear-optimal protocols known in the classical setting.\n", "  We present a random number generation scheme based on measuring the phase\nfluctuations of a laser with a simple and compact experimental setup. A simple\nmodel is established to analyze the randomness and the simulation result based\non this model fits well with the experiment data. After the analog to digital\nsampling and suitable randomness extraction integrated in the field\nprogrammable gate array, the final random bits are delivered to a PC, realizing\na 5.4 Gbps real time quantum random number generation. The final random bit\nsequences have passed all the NIST and DIEHARD tests.\n", "  Electrospinning is a nanotechnology process whereby an external electric\nfield is used to accelerate and stretch a charged polymer jet, so as to produce\nfibers with nanoscale diameters. In quest of a further reduction in the cross\nsection of electrified jets hence of a better control on the morphology of the\nresulting electrospun fibers, we explore the effects of an external rotating\nelectric field orthogonal to the jet direction. Through extensive particle\nsimulations, it is shown that by a proper tuning of the electric field\namplitude and frequency, a reduction of up to a $30 \\%$ in the aforementioned\nradius can be obtained, thereby opening new perspectives in the design of\nfuture ultra-thin electrospun fibres. Applications can be envisaged in the\nfields of nanophotonic components as well as for designing new and improved\nfiltration materials.\n", "  The phenomenon of the displacement of the position of the pressure, intensity\nand acoustic radiation force maxima along the axis of focused acoustic beams\nunder increasing driving amplitudes (nonlinear focal shift) is studied for the\ncase of a moderately focused beam excited with continuous and 25 kHz amplitude\nmodulated signals, both in water and tissue. We prove that in amplitude\nmodulated beams the linear and nonlinear propagation effects coexist in a\nsemi-period of modulation, giving place to a complex dynamic behaviour, where\nthe singular points of the beam (peak pressure, rarefaction, intensity and\nacoustic radiation force) locate at different points on axis as a function of\ntime. These entire phenomena are explained in terms of harmonic generation and\nabsorption during the propagation in a lossy nonlinear medium both, for a\ncontinuous and an amplitude modulated beam. One of the possible applications of\nthe acoustic radiation force displacement is the generation of shear waves at\ndifferent locations by using a focused mono-element transducer excited with an\namplitude modulated signal.\n", "  This work theoretically analyzes the sound absorption properties of a chirped\nmulti-layer porous material including transmission, in particular showing the\nbroadband unidirectional absorption properties of the system. Using the\ncombination of the impedance matching condition and the balance between the\nleakage and the intrinsic losses, the system is designed to have broadband\nunidirectional and quasi perfect absorption. The transfer and scattering matrix\nformalism, together with numerical simulations based on the finite element\nmethod are used to demonstrate the results showing excellent agreement between\nthem. The proposed system allows to construct broadband sound absorbers with\nimproved absorption in the low frequency regime using less amount of material\nthan the complete bulk porous layer.\n", "  We derive the latest constraints on various simplified models of natural SUSY\nwith light higgsinos, stops and gluinos, using a detailed and comprehensive\nreinterpretation of the most recent 13 TeV ATLAS and CMS searches with $\\sim\n15$ fb$^{-1}$ of data. We discuss the implications of these constraints for\nfine-tuning of the electroweak scale. While the most \"vanilla\" version of SUSY\n(the MSSM with $R$-parity and flavor-degenerate sfermions) with 10% fine-tuning\nis ruled out by the current constraints, models with decoupled valence squarks\nor reduced missing energy can still be fully natural. However, in all of these\nmodels, the mediation scale must be extremely low ($<100$ TeV). We conclude by\nconsidering the prospects for the high-luminosity LHC era, where we expect the\ncurrent limits on particle masses to improve by up to $\\sim 1$ TeV, and discuss\nfurther model-building directions for natural SUSY that are motivated by this\nwork.\n", "  Current all-orders proofs of factorization of hard processes are made by\nextracting the leading power behavior of Feynman graphs, i.e., by extracting\nasymptotics strictly order-by-order in perturbation theory. The resulting\nparton densities and fragmentation functions include non-perturbative effects.\nI show how there are missing elements in the proofs; these are related to and\nexemplified by string and cluster models of hadronization. The proofs rely on\nlarge rapidity differences between different parts of graphs for the process;\nbut in reality large rapidity gaps are filled in\n", "  The electrical and heat currents flowing through a quantum dot are calculated\nin the presence of a time-modulated gate voltage with the help of the\nout-of-equilibrium Green function technique. From the first harmonics of the\ncurrents, we extract the electrical and thermoelectrical trans-admittances and\nac-conductances. Next, by a careful comparison of the ac-conductances with the\nfinite-frequency electrical and mixed electrical-heat noises, we establish the\nfluctuation-dissipation relations linking these quantities, which are thus\ngeneralized out-of-equilibrium for a quantum system. It is shown that the\nelectrical ac-conductance associated to the displacement current is directly\nlinked to the electrical noise summed over reservoirs, whereas the relation\nbetween the thermoelectrical ac-conductance and the mixed noise contains an\nadditional term proportional to the energy step that the electrons must\novercome when traveling through the junction. A numerical study reveals however\nthat a fluctuation-dissipation relation involving a single reservoir applies\nfor both electrical and thermoelectrical ac-conductances when the frequency\ndominates over the other characteristic energies.\n", "  Recent ab-initio calculations showed that oversized solute atoms (OSA) in BCC\nand FCC iron exhibit a very strong attraction with a nearby vacancy (V) at\nfirst neighbour distance (1NN). The attraction it is so large that the 1NN pair\nOSA+V is no longer stable and relaxes spontaneously towards a new configuration\nwhere the OSA sits in the middle of the bond, the two ends of which are\ndecorated with two half-vacancies (V/2). Taking into account the formation of\nthis complex V/2+OSA+V/2 in the migration process has never been done before:\nit requires a new formulation of correlation effects. This is the aim of the\npresent contribution which establishes the expression of the diffusion\ncoefficient of the OSA and evaluates exactly the correlation factor in BCC and\nFCC lattices, thanks to the introduction of macrojumps. The formalism is\napplied to the case of Y in BCC iron and its results are compared to those\nobtained by previous authors. It is shown that the smallness of the correlation\nfactor is not due to the transport mechanism of the OSA but only to the jump\nfrequencies of the vacancy in the vicinity of the OSA. This smallness of the\ncorrelation factor is however overcompensated by a large macrojump frequency,\nand, as a result, the Y atom diffuses more rapidly than iron at all\ntemperatures by orders of magnitude in the two structures.\n", "  The results of behavioral experiments typically exhibit inconsistent\nconnectedness, i.e., they violate the condition known as \"no-signaling,\"\n\"no-disturbance,\" or \"marginal selectivity.\" This prevents one from evaluating\nthese experiments in terms of quantum contextuality if the latter understood\ntraditionally (as, e.g., in the Kochen-Specker theorem or Bell-type\ninequalities). The Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory separates\ncontextuality from inconsistent connectedness. When applied to quantum physical\nexperiments that exhibit inconsistent connectedness (due to context-dependent\nerrors and/or signaling), the CbD computations reveal quantum contextuality in\nspite of this. When applied to a large body of published behavioral\nexperiments, the CbD computations reveal no quantum contextuality: all\ncontext-dependence in these experiments is described by inconsistent\nconnectedness alone. Until recently, however, experimental analysis of\ncontextuality was confined to so-called cyclic systems of binary random\nvariables. Here, we present the results of a psychophysical double-detection\nexperiment that do not form a cyclic system: their analysis requires that we\nuse a recent modification of CbD, one that makes the class of noncontextual\nsystems more restricted. Nevertheless our results once again indicate that when\ninconsistent connectedness is taken into account, the system exhibits no\ncontextuality. KEYWORDS: contextuality, cyclic systems, double-detection,\ninconsistent connectedness, psychophysics.\n", "  A renormalization group treatment of the Kondo model with logarithmic Van\nHove singularity in the electron density of states is performed within\nnext-leading order scaling, different magnetic phases being considered. The\neffective coupling constant remains small, renormalized magnetic moment and\nspin-fluctuation frequency decreasing by several orders of magnitude. Thus wide\nnon-Fermi-liquid behavior regions are found from the scaling trajectories in a\nbroad interval of the bare coupling parameter. Applications to itinerant\nmagnetism theory are discussed.\n", "  We consider three different communication tasks for quantum broadcast\nchannels, and we determine the capacity region of a Hadamard broadcast channel\nfor these various tasks. We define a Hadamard broadcast channel to be such that\nthe channel from the sender to one of the receivers is entanglement-breaking\nand the channel from the sender to the other receiver is complementary to this\none. As such, this channel is a quantum generalization of a degraded broadcast\nchannel, which is well known in classical information theory. The first\ncommunication task we consider is classical communication to both receivers,\nthe second is quantum communication to the stronger receiver and classical\ncommunication to other, and the third is entanglement-assisted classical\ncommunication to the stronger receiver and unassisted classical communication\nto the other. The structure of a Hadamard broadcast channel plays a critical\nrole in our analysis: the channel to the weaker receiver can be simulated by\nperforming a measurement channel on the stronger receiver's system, followed by\na preparation channel. As such, we can incorporate the classical output of the\nmeasurement channel as an auxiliary variable and solve all three of the above\ncapacities for Hadamard broadcast channels, in this way avoiding known\ndifficulties associated with quantum auxiliary variables.\n", "  An infinite dimensional canonical symplectic structure and\nstructure-preserving geometric algorithms are developed for the photon-matter\ninteractions described by the Schr\\\"odinger-Maxwell equations. The algorithms\npreserve the symplectic structure of the system and the unitary nature of the\nwavefunctions, and bound the energy error of the simulation for all time-steps.\nThis new numerical capability enables us to carry out first-principle based\nsimulation study of important photon-matter interactions, such as the high\nharmonic generation and stabilization of ionization, with long-term accuracy\nand fidelity.\n", "  Backscattering-immune chiral modes arise along certain line defects in\nthree-dimensional materials. In this paper, we study Floquet chiral modes along\nFloquet topological defects, namely, the defects come entirely from spatial\nmodulations of periodic driving. We define a precise topological invariant that\ncounts the number of Floquet chiral modes, which is expressed as an integral on\na five-dimensional torus parameterized by $(k_x,k_y,k_z,\\theta,t)$. This work\ndemonstrates the possibility of creating chiral modes in three-dimensional bulk\nmaterials by modulated driving. We hope that it will stimulate further studies\nof Floquet topological defects.\n", "  The spin-3/2 elementary particle, known as Rarita-Schwinger (RS) fermion, is\ndescribed by a vector-spinor field {\\psi}_{{\\mu}{\\alpha}}, whose number of\ncomponents is larger than its independent degrees of freedom (DOF). Thus the RS\nequations contain nontrivial constraints to eliminate the redundant DOF.\nConsequently the standard procedure adopted in realizing relativistic spin-1/2\nquasi-particle is not capable of creating the RS fermion in condensed matter\nsystems. In this work, we propose a generic method to construct a Hamiltonian\nwhich implicitly contains the RS constraints, thus includes the eigenstates and\nenergy dispersions being exactly the same as those of RS equations. By\nimplementing our 16X16 or 6X6 Hamiltonian, one can realize the 3 dimensional or\n2 dimensional (2D) massive RS quasiparticles, respectively. In the\nnon-relativistic limit, the 2D 6X6 Hamiltonian can be reduced to two 3X3\nHamiltonians which describe the positive and negative energy parts\nrespectively. Due to the nontrivial constraints, this simplified 2D massive RS\nquasiparticle has an exotic property: it has vanishing orbital magnetic moment\nwhile its orbital magnetization is finite. Finally, we discuss the material\nrealization of RS quasiparticle. Our study provides an opportunity to realize\nhigher spin elementary fermions with constraints in condensed matter systems.\n", "  We demonstrate a new generation mechanism for polarisation- and\ncolour-entangled photon pairs. In our approach we tailor the phase-matching of\na periodically poled KTP crystal such that two downconversion processes take\nplace simultaneously. Relying on this effect, our source emits entangled\nbipartite photon states, emerging intrinsically from a single, unidirectionally\npumped crystal with uniform poling period. Its property of being maximally\ncompact and luminous at the same time makes our source unique compared to\nexisting photon-entanglement sources and is therefore of high practical\nsignificance in quantum information experiments.\n", "  Sound propagation within certain non-relativistic condensed matter models\nobeys a relativistic wave equation despite such systems admitting entirely\nnon-relativistic descriptions. A natural question that arises upon\nconsideration of this is, \"do devices exist that will experience the relativity\nin these systems?\" We describe a thought experiment in which 'acoustic\nobservers' possess devices called sound clocks that can be connected to form\nchains. Careful investigation shows that appropriately constructed chains of\nstationary and moving sound clocks are perceived by observers on the other\nchain as undergoing the relativistic phenomena of length contraction and time\ndilation by the Lorentz factor, with c the speed of sound. Sound clocks within\nmoving chains actually tick less frequently than stationary ones and must be\nseparated by a shorter distance than when stationary to satisfy simultaneity\nconditions. Stationary sound clocks appear to be length contracted and time\ndilated to moving observers due to their misunderstanding of their own state of\nmotion with respect to the laboratory. Observers restricted to using sound\nclocks describe a universe kinematically consistent with the theory of special\nrelativity, despite the preferred frame of their universe in the laboratory.\nSuch devices show promise in further probing analogue relativity models, for\nexample in investigating phenomena that require careful consideration of the\nproper time elapsed for observers.\n", "  Gravitational vacuum stars (gravastars) have become a viable theoretical\nalternative to the black hole (BH) end-stage of stellar evolution. These\nobjects gravitate in vacuum like BHs, yet have no event horizons. In this\npaper, we present tests of the gravastar hypothesis within flat Friedmann\ncosmology. Such tests are complementary to optical and gravitational wave\nmerger signatures, which have uncertainties dominated by the poorly constrained\ngravastar crust. We motivate our analysis directly from the action principle,\nand show that a population of gravastars must induce a time-dependent dark\nenergy (DE). The possibility of such a contribution has been overlooked due to\na subtlety in the de facto definition of the isotropic and homogeneous stress.\nConservation of stress-energy directly relates the time evolution of this DE\ncontribution to the measured BH comoving mass function and a gravastar\npopulation crust parameter $\\eta$. We show that a population of gravastars\nformed between redshift $8 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 20$ readily produces the\npresent-day DE density over a large range of $\\eta$, providing a natural\nresolution to the coincidence problem. We compute an effective DE equation of\nstate $w_\\mathrm{eff}(a)$ as a function of present-epoch BH population\nobservables and $\\eta$. Using a BH population model developed from the cosmic\nstar formation history, we obtain $w_0$ and $w_a$ consistent with Planck\nbest-fit values. In summary, the gravastar hypothesis leads to an unexpected\ncorrelation between the BH population and the magnitude and time-evolution of\nDE.\n", "  Motivated by the magnetic properties of the spin-chain compounds\nLiCuSbO$_4$$\\equiv$LiSbCuO$_4$ and Rb$_2$Cu$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{12}$, we study the\nground state of the Heisenberg chain with dimerized nearest-neighbor\nferromagnetic (FM)($J_1, J_1^\\prime<0$) and next-nearest-neighbor\nantiferromagnetic ($J_2>0$) couplings. Using the density-matrix renormalization\ngroup technique and spin-wave theory we find a first-order transition between a\nfully-polarized FM and an incommensurate spiral state at\n$2\\alpha=\\beta/(1+\\beta)$, where $\\alpha$ is the frustration ratio $J_2/|J_1|$\nand $\\beta$ the degree of dimerization $J_1^\\prime/J_1$.In the singlet spiral\nstate the spin-gap is vanishingly small in the vicinity of the FM transition,\ncorresponding to a situation of LiCuSbO$_4$. For larger $\\alpha$, corresponding\nto Rb$_2$Cu$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{12}$, and smaller $\\beta$ there is a crossover from\nthis frustration induced incommensurate state to an\nAffleck-Lieb-Kennedy-Tasaki-type valence bond solid state with substantial\nspin-gaps.\n", "  This paper aims to establish theoretical foundations of graph product\nmultilayer networks (GPMNs), a family of multilayer networks that can be\nobtained as a graph product of two or more factor networks. Cartesian, direct\n(tensor), and strong product operators are considered, and then generalized. We\nfirst describe mathematical relationships between GPMNs and their factor\nnetworks regarding their degree/strength, adjacency, and Laplacian spectra, and\nthen show that those relationships can still hold for nonsimple and generalized\nGPMNs. Applications of GPMNs are discussed in three areas: predicting epidemic\nthresholds, modeling propagation in nontrivial space and time, and analyzing\nhigher-order properties of self-similar networks. Directions of future research\nare also discussed.\n", "  We present a time-resolved study of the DC-current driven magnetization\ndynamics in a microstructured Cr/Heusler/Pt waveguide by means of Brillouin\nlight scattering. A reduction of the effective spin-wave damping via the\nspin-transfer-torque effect leads to a strong increase in the magnon density.\nThis is accompanied by a decrease of the spin-wave frequencies. By evaluating\nthe time scales of these effects, the origin of this frequency shift can be\nidentified. However, recently, we found that the experimental setup partially\ninfluences the decay of the spin-wave intensity after the current pulse is\nswitched off. Thus, further investigations on the presented effect are needed\nto allow for a more detailed analysis. For this reason, we need to withdraw the\nmanuscript at this point and might publish an updated version later.\n", "  In this paper, we study the Hardy nonlocal argument (HNA) and the Cabello\nnonlocal argument (CNA) under the Information Causality, Macroscopic Locality\nand Local Orthogonality principles in the context of Local Randomness. We see\nthat, in the context of all the possibilities of local randomness, the gap\nbetween the quantum mechanics and the above principles, in the Cabello's\nnonlocality argument is larger than the Hardy's case. Therefore the CNA is\nstronger control than the HNA for detecting post-quantum nosignalling\ncorrelations.\n", "  We numerically study jamming transitions in pedestrian flow interacting with\nan attraction, mostly based on the social force model for pedestrians who can\njoin the attraction. We formulate the joining probability as a function of\nsocial influence from others, reflecting that individual choice behavior is\nlikely influenced by others. By controlling pedestrian influx and the social\ninfluence parameter, we identify various pedestrian flow patterns. For the\nbidirectional flow scenario, we observe a transition from the free flow phase\nto the freezing phase, in which oppositely walking pedestrians reach a complete\nstop and block each other. On the other hand, a different transition behavior\nappears in the unidirectional flow scenario, i.e., from the free flow phase to\nthe localized jam phase and then to the extended jam phase. It is also observed\nthat the extended jam phase can end up in freezing phenomena with a certain\nprobability when pedestrian flux is high with strong social influence. This\nstudy highlights that attractive interactions between pedestrians and an\nattraction can trigger jamming transitions by increasing the number of\nconflicts among pedestrians near the attraction. In order to avoid excessive\npedestrian jams, we suggest suppressing the number of conflicts under a certain\nlevel by moderating pedestrian influx especially when the social influence is\nstrong.\n", "  I present estimates of the branching fractions in the non-leptonic charmonium\ntwo-body decay rates for $B^0\\rightarrow \\psi(2S)\\pi^0$ decay and the same\ndecays of $B^+\\rightarrow \\psi(2S)\\pi^+$, $B^0\\rightarrow \\psi(2S)K^0$ and\n$B^+\\rightarrow \\psi(2S)K^+$. These estimates are based on a generalized\nfactorization approach making use of leading order (LO) and next-to-leading\norder (NLO) contributions. I find that when the large enhancements from the\nknown NLO contributions by using the QCD factorization approach are taken into\naccount, the branching ratios are the following: $Br(B^0\\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S)\\pi^0)=(1.067\\pm0.059)\\times10^{-5}$, $Br(B^+\\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S)\\pi^+)=(2.134\\pm0.0.118)\\times10^{-5}$, $Br(B^0\\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S)K^0)=(6.344\\pm0.376)\\times10^{-4}$ and $Br(B^+\\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S)K^+)=(6.344\\pm0.376)\\times10^{-4}$, while the experimental results are\n$(1.17\\pm 0.17)\\times 10^{-5}$, $(2.44\\pm 0.30)\\times 10^{-5}$, $(6.20\\pm\n0.50)\\times 10^{-4}$ and $(6.39\\pm 0.33)\\times 10^{-4}$ respectively. All\nestimates are in good agreement with the experimental results.\n", "  The order horismos induces the Zeeman $Z$ topology, which is coarser than the\nFine Zeeman Topology $F$. The causal curves in a spacetime under $Z$ are\npiecewise null. $F$ is considered to be the most physical topology in a\nspacetime manifold $M$, as the group of homeomorphisms of $M$ is isomorphic to\nthe group of homothetic transformations of $M$. $Z$ was used in the Ambient\nBoundary-Ambient Space cosmological model, in order to show that there is no\npossibility of formation of spacetime singularities. In this article we\nquestion this result, by reviewing the corresponding articles, and we propose\nnew questions towards the improvement of this model.\n", "  In low-collisionality scenarios exhibiting mitigation of edge localized modes\n(ELMs), stable ideal kink modes at the edge are excited by externally applied\nmagnetic perturbation (MP)-fields. In ASDEX Upgrade these modes can cause\nthree-dimensional (3D) boundary displacements up to the centimeter range. These\ndisplacements have been measured using toroidally localized high resolution\ndiagnostics and rigidly rotating n = 2 MP-fields with various applied poloidal\nmode spectra. These measurements are compared to non-linear 3D ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equilibria calculated by VMEC. Comprehensive\ncomparisons have been conducted, which consider for instance plasma movements\ndue to the position control system, attenuation due to internal conductors and\nchanges in the edge pressure profiles. VMEC accurately reproduces the amplitude\nof the displacement and its dependencies on the applied poloidal mode spectra.\nQuantitative agreement is found around the low field side (LFS) midplane. The\nresponse at the plasma top is qualitatively compared. The measured and\npredicted displacements at the plasma top maximize when the applied spectra is\noptimized for ELM-mitigation. The predictions from the vacuum modeling\ngenerally fails to describe the displacement at the LFS midplane as well as at\nthe plasma top. When the applied mode spectra is set to maximize the\ndisplacement, VMEC and the measurements clearly surpass the predictions from\nthe vacuum modeling by a factor of four. Minor disagreements between VMEC and\nthe measurements are discussed. This study underlines the importance of the\nstable ideal kink modes at the edge for the 3D boundary displacement in\nscenarios relevant for ELM-mitigation.\n", "  We investigate the Hawking radiation of massive spin-1 vector particles,\nwhich are coupled to vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field, from Rindler\nmodified Schwarzschild black hole. Rindler acceleration is used to produce the\npost-general relativistic theory of gravity for the distant field of a point\nmass. The gravitational lensing problem of the Rindler modified Schwarzschild\nblack hole is also studied. We compute the deflection angle for the IR region\n(large distance limit as infrared) by using the Gaussian curvature of the\noptical metric of this back hole. Our investigations clarify how the Rindler\nacceleration plays a role on the Hawking radiation and gravitational lensing.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of cosmic web since $z=5$ in grid based\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations, focusing on the mass and velocity\nfield of both baryonic and cold dark matter. The tidal tensor of density is\nused as the main method for web identification, with $\\lambda_{th}=0.2-1.2$.\nThe evolution trends in baryonic and dark matter are similar, while moderate\ndifferences are observed. Sheets appeared early and their large scale pattern\nmay have been set up by $z=3$. In term of mass, filaments superseded sheets as\nthe primary collapsing structures at $z\\sim2-3$. Tenuous filaments assembled\nwith each other to form prominent ones at $z<~2$. In accordance with the\nconstruction of the frame of sheets, the cosmic divergence velocity, $v_{div}$,\nhad been well developed above 2-3 Mpc by z=3. Afterwards, curl velocity,\n$v_{curl}$, grown dramatically along with the rising of filaments, become\ncomparable to $v_{div}$, for $<2-3 Mpc$ at $z=0$. The scaling of $v_{curl}$ can\nbe described by the hierarchical turbulence model. The alignment between\nvorticity and eigenvectors of shear tensor in baryonic matter field resembles\ndark matter, and is even moderately stronger between $\\vec{\\omega}$ and\n$\\vec{e}_1$, and $\\vec{e}_3$. Compared with dark matter, mildly less baryonic\nmatter is found residing in filaments and clusters, and its vorticity has been\ndeveloped more significantly below $2-3 Mpc$. These differences may be\nunderestimated due to the limited resolution and lack of star formation in our\nsimulation. The impact of the change of dominant structures in over-dense\nregions at $z\\sim2-3$ on galaxy formation and evolution is shortly discussed.\n", "  We consider an exclusion process with long jumps in the box $\\Lambda\\_N=\\{1,\n\\ldots,N-1\\}$, for $N \\ge 2$, in contact with infinitely extended reservoirs on\nits left and on its right. The jump rate is described by a transition\nprobability $p(\\cdot)$ which is symmetric, with infinite support but with\nfinite variance. The reservoirs add or remove particles with rate proportional\nto $\\kappa N^{-\\theta}$, where $\\kappa>0$ and $\\theta \\in\\mathbb R$. If\n$\\theta>0$ (resp. $\\theta<0$) the reservoirs add and fastly remove (resp.\nslowly remove) particles in the bulk. According to the value of $\\theta$ we\nprove that the time evolution of the spatial density of particles is described\nby some reaction-diffusion equations with various boundary conditions.\n", "  The $P'_5$ and $R_K$ anomalies, recently observed by the LHCb collaboration\nin $B \\to K^{(*)}$ transitions, may indicate the existence of a new $Z'$ boson,\nwhich may arise from gauged $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$ symmetry. Flavor-changing neutral\ncurrent $Z'$ couplings, such as $tcZ'$, can be induced by the presence of extra\nvector-like quarks. In this paper we study the LHC signatures of the induced\nright-handed $tcZ'$ coupling that is inspired by, but not directly linked to,\nthe $B \\to K^{(*)}$ anomalies. The specific processes studied are $cg \\to tZ'$\nand its conjugate process each followed by $Z'\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$. By constructing\nan effective theory for the $tcZ'$ coupling, we first explore\nmodel-independently the discovery potential of such a $Z'$ at the 14 TeV LHC\nwith 300 and 3000 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosities. We then reinterpret the\nmodel-independent results within the gauged $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$ model. In\nconnection with $tcZ'$, the model also implies the existence of a\nflavor-conserving $ccZ'$ coupling, which can drive the $c \\bar c \\to Z' \\to\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ process. Our study shows that existing LHC results for dimuon\nresonance searches already constrain the $ccZ'$ coupling, and that the $Z'$ can\nbe discovered in either or both of the $cg \\to tZ'$ and $c \\bar c \\to Z'$\nprocesses. We further discuss the sensitivity to the left-handed $tcZ'$\ncoupling and find that the coupling values favored by the $B \\to K^{(*)}$\nanomalies lie slightly below the LHC discovery reach even with 3000 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  Dirac materials are characterized by energy-momentum relations that resemble\nthose of relativistic massless particles. Commonly denominated Dirac cones,\nthese dispersion relations are considered to be their essential feature. These\nmaterials comprise quite diverse examples, such as graphene and topological\ninsulators. Band-engineering techniques should aim to a full control of the\nparameter that characterizes the Dirac cones: the Fermi velocity. We propose a\ngeneral mechanism that enables the fine-tuning of the Fermi velocity in Dirac\nmaterials in a readily accessible way for experiments. By embedding the sample\nin a uniform electric field, the Fermi velocity is substantially modified. We\nfirst prove this result analytically, for the surface states of a topological\ninsulator/semiconductor interface, and postulate its universality to other\nDirac materials. Then we check its correctness in carbon-based Dirac materials,\nnamely graphene nanoribbons and nanotubes, thus showing the validity of our\nhypothesis in both continuum and tight-binding calculations and in different\nDirac systems.\n", "  In quantum mechanics the unitary evolution is most often described in a\npre-selected Hilbert space ${\\cal H}^{(textbook)}$ in which, due to the Stone\ntheorem, the Schr\\\"odinger-picture Hamiltonian is self-adjoint,\n$\\mathfrak{h}=\\mathfrak{h}^\\dagger$. Via a unitary transformation one can also\ntranslate the theory (i.e., usually, differential evolution equations) to the\nHeisenberg or interaction picture. Once we decide to treat ${\\cal\nH}^{(textbook)}$ as a \"Dyson's\" non-unitary one-to-one image of a new,\nauxiliary Hilbert space ${\\cal H}^{(friendlier)}$, the corresponding (i.e.,\npresumably, user-friendlier) avatar $H= \\Omega^{-1}\\mathfrak{h}\\Omega$ of the\nSchr\\\"odinger-picture Hamiltonian keeps describing the same physics but becomes\nnon-self-adjoint in ${\\cal H}^{(friendlier)}$. Of course, a completion of the\ntheory requires a Dyson-proposed reinstallation of the Stone theorem in ${\\cal\nH}^{(friendlier)}$. This is routinely achieved by an ad hoc redefinition of the\ninner product, i.e., formally, by a move to the third Hilbert representation\nspace ${\\cal H}^{(standard)}$. In some detail we show that in the\nnon-stationary Dyson-inspired Heisenberg- and interaction-picture settings the\nresulting description of the unitary evolution becomes technically more\ncomplicated. As an illustration we describe an application to the Klein-Gordon\nequation with a space- and time-dependent mass term.\n", "  A method to obtain all-order asymptotic results for the coefficients of\nperturbative expansions in zero-dimensional quantum field is described. The\nfocus is on the enumeration of the number of skeleton or primitive diagrams of\na certain QFT and its asymptotics. The procedure heavily applies techniques\nfrom singularity analysis and is related to resurgence. To utilize singularity\nanalysis, a representation of the zero-dimensional path integral as a\ngeneralized hyperelliptic curve is deduced. As applications the full asymptotic\nexpansions of the number of disconnected, connected, 1PI and skeleton Feynman\ndiagrams in various theories are given.\n", "  Strongly lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide a unique opportunity to\nmake progress in the study of the evolution of the correlation between the mass\nof supermassive black holes ($\\mathcal M_{BH}$) and their host galaxy\nluminosity ($L_{host}$). We demonstrate the power of lensing by analyzing two\nsystems for which state-of-the-art lens modelling techniques have been applied\nto Hubble Space Telescope imaging data. We use i) the reconstructed images to\ninfer the total and bulge luminosity of the host and ii) published broad-line\nspectroscopy to estimate $\\mathcal M_{BH}$ using the so-called virial method.\nWe then enlarge our sample with new calibration of previously published\nmeasurements to study the evolution of the correlation out to z~4.5. Consistent\nwith previous work, we find that without taking into account passive luminosity\nevolution, the data points lie on the local relation. Once passive luminosity\nevolution is taken into account, we find that BHs in the more distant Universe\nreside in less luminous galaxies than today. Fitting this offset as $\\mathcal\nM_{BH}$/$L_{host}$ $\\propto$ (1+z)$^{\\gamma}$, and taking into account\nselection effects, we obtain $\\gamma$ = 0.6 $\\pm$ 0.1 and 0.8$\\pm$ 0.1 for the\ncase of $\\mathcal M_{BH}$-$L_{bulge}$ and $\\mathcal M_{BH}$-$L_{total}$,\nrespectively. To test for systematic uncertainties and selection effects we\nalso consider a reduced sample that is homogeneous in data quality. We find\nconsistent results but with considerably larger uncertainty due to the more\nlimited sample size and redshift coverage ($\\gamma$ = 0.7 $\\pm$ 0.4 and\n0.2$\\pm$ 0.5 for $\\mathcal M_{BH}$-$L_{bulge}$ and $\\mathcal\nM_{BH}$-$L_{total}$, respectively), highlighting the need to gather more\nhigh-quality data for high-redshift lensed quasar hosts. Our result is\nconsistent with a scenario where the growth of the black hole predates that of\nthe host galaxy.\n", "  We investigate the mechanics of elastic fibres carrying liquid droplets. In\nsuch systems, buckling may localize inside the drop cavity if the fibre is thin\nenough. This so-called drop-on-coilable-fibre system exhibits a surprising\nliquid-like response under compression, and a solid-like response under\ntension. Here we analyze this unconventional behavior in further details and\nfind theoretical, numerical and experimental evidences of negative stiffness\nevents. We find that the first and main negative stiffness regime owes its\nexistence to the transfer of capillary-stored energy into mechanical curvature\nenergy. The following negative stiffness events are associated with changes in\nthe coiling morphology of the fibre. Eventually coiling becomes tightly locked\ninto an ordered phase where liquid and solid deformations coexist.\n", "  We propose the use of a quantum thermal machine for low-temperature\nthermometry. A hot thermal reservoir coupled to the machine allows for\nsimultaneously cooling the sample while determining its temperature without\nknowing the model-dependent coupling constants. In its most simple form, the\nproposed scheme works for all thermal machines which perform at Otto efficiency\nand can reach Carnot efficiency. We consider a circuit QED implementation which\nallows for precise thermometry down to $\\sim$15 mK with realistic parameters.\nBased on the quantum Fisher information, this is close to the optimal\nachievable performance. This implementation demonstrates that our proposal is\nparticularly promising in systems where thermalization between different\ncomponents of an experimental setup cannot be guaranteed.\n", "  We investigate the spin-wave excitations in the spin-density wave state of\ndoped iron pnictides within a five-orbital model. We find that the excitations\nalong ($\\pi, 0$)$\\rightarrow$($\\pi, \\pi$) are very sensitive to the doping\nwhereas they do not exhibit a similar sensitivity along ($0, 0$) $\\rightarrow$\n($\\pi, 0$). Secondly, anisotropy in the excitations around ($\\pi, 0$) with an\nelliptical shape grows on moving towards the hole-doped region for low energy,\nwhereas it decreases for the high-energy excitations on the contrary. Thirdly,\nspin-wave spectral weight shifts towards the low-energy region on moving away\nfrom zero doping. We find these features to be in qualitative agreement with\nthe inelastic neutron-scattering measurements for the doped pnictides.\n", "  The nature of excited states of open quantum systems produced by incoherent\nnatural thermal light is analyzed based on a description of the generator of\nthe dynamics. Natural thermal light is shown to generate long-lasting coherent\ndynamics because of (i) the super-Ohmic character of the radiation, and (ii)\nthe absence of pure dephasing dynamics. In the presence of an environment, the\nlong-lasting coherences induced by suddenly turned-on incoherent light\ndissipate and stationary coherences are established. As a particular\napplication, dynamics in a subunit of the PC-645 light-harvesting complex is\nconsidered where it is further shown that aspects of the energy pathways\nlandscape depend on the nature of the exciting light and number of chromophores\nexcited. Specifically, pulsed laser and natural broadband incoherent excitation\ninduce significantly different energy transfer pathways. In addition, we\ndiscuss differences in perspective associated with the eigenstate vs site\nbasis, and note an important difference in the phase of system coherences when\ncoupled to blackbody radiation or when coupled to a phonon background. Finally,\nan Appendix contains an open systems example of the loss of coherence as the\nturn on time of the light assumes natural time scales.\n", "  We give a classification of the different types of noise in a quantum dot,\nfor variable temperature, voltage and frequency. It allows us first to show\nwhich kind of information can be extracted from the electrical noise, such as\nthe ac-conductance or the Fano factor. And next, to classify the mixed\nelectrical-heat noise, and to identify in which regimes information on the\nSeebeck coefficient, on the thermoelectric figure of merit, or on the\nthermoelectric efficiency can be obtained.\n", "  Field-line localized ballooning modes have been observed at the edge of high\nconfinement mode plasmas in ASDEX Upgrade with rotating 3D perturbations\ninduced by an externally applied n = 2 error field and during a moderate level\nof edge localized mode-mitigation. The observed ballooning modes are localized\nto the field-lines which experience one of the two zero-crossings of the radial\nflux surface displacement during one rotation period. The localization of the\nballooning modes agrees very well with the localization of the largest growth\nrates from infinite-n ideal ballooning stability calculations using a realistic\n3D ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium. This analysis predicts a lower\nstability with respect to the axisymmetric case. The primary mechanism for the\nlocal lower stability is the 3D distortion of the local magnetic shear.\n", "  Angle-resolved (AR) RABBIT measurements offer a high information content\nmeasurement scheme, due to the presence of multiple, interfering, ionization\nchannels combined with a phase-sensitive observable in the form of angle and\ntime-resolved photoelectron interferograms. In order to explore the\ncharacteristics and potentials of AR-RABBIT, a perturbative 2-photon model is\ndeveloped; based on this model, example AR-RABBIT results are computed for\nmodel and real systems, for a range of RABBIT schemes. These results indicate\nsome of the phenomena to be expected in AR-RABBIT measurements, and suggest\nvarious applications of the technique in photoionization metrology.\n", "  Can global internal and spacetime symmetries be connected without\nsupersymmetry? To answer this question, we investigate Minkowski spacetimes\nwith d space-like extra dimensions and point out under which general conditions\nexternal symmetries induce internal symmetries in the effective 4-dimensional\ntheories. We further discuss in this context how internal degrees of freedom\nand spacetime symmetries can mix without supersymmetry in agreement with the\nColeman-Mandula theorem. We present some specific examples which rely on a\ndirect product structure of spacetime such that orthogonal extra dimensions can\nhave symmetries which mix with global internal symmetries. This mechanism opens\nup new opportunities to understand global symmetries in particle physics.\n", "  We consider the FRW cosmological model in which the matter content of\nuniverse (playing a role of inflaton or quintessence) is given by a novel\ngeneralization of the massive scalar field. The latter is a scalar version of\nthe recently introduced Nonlinear Field Space Theory (NFST), where physical\nphase space of a given field is assumed to be compactified at large energies.\nFor our analysis we choose the simple case of a field with the spherical phase\nspace and endow it with the generalized Hamiltonian analogous to the XXZ\nHeisenberg model, normally describing a system of spins in condensed matter\nphysics. Subsequently, we study both the homogenous cosmological sector and\nlinear perturbations of such a test field. In the homogenous sector we find\nthat nonlinearity of the field phase space is becoming relevant for large\nvolumes of universe and then it can lead to a recollapse, and possibly also at\nvery high energies, leading to the phase of a bounce. Quantization of the field\nis performed in the limit where nontrivial nature of its phase space can be\nneglected, while there is a non-vanishing contribution from the Lorentz\nsymmetry breaking term of the Hamiltonian. As a result, in the leading order of\nthe XXZ anisotropy parameter, we find that the inflationary spectral index\nremains unmodified with respect to the standard case but the total amplitude of\nperturbations is subject to a correction. The Bunch-Davies vacuum state also\nbecomes appropriately corrected. The proposed new approach is bringing\ncosmology and condensed matter physics closer together, which may turn out to\nbe beneficial for both disciplines.\n", "  Metallic LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO) interfaces attract enormous attention,\nbut the relationship between the electron mobility and the sheet electron\ndensity, $n_s$, is poorly understood. Here we derive a simple expression for\nthe three-dimensional electron density near the interface, $n_{3D}$, as a\nfunction of $n_s$ and find that the mobility for LAO/STO-based interfaces\ndepends on $n_{3D}$ in the same way as it does for bulk doped STO. It is known\nthat undoped bulk STO is strongly compensated with $N \\simeq 5 \\times\n10^{18}~\\rm{cm^{-3}}$ background donors and acceptors. In intentionally doped\nbulk STO with a concentration of electrons $n_{3D} < N$ background impurities\ndetermine the electron scattering. Thus, when $n_{3D} < N$ it is natural to see\nin LAO/STO the same mobility as in the bulk. On the other hand, in the bulk\nsamples with $n_{3D} > N$ the mobility collapses because scattering happens on\n$n_{3D}$ intentionally introduced donors. For LAO/STO the polar catastrophe\nwhich provides electrons is not supposed to provide equal number of random\ndonors and thus the mobility should be larger. The fact that the mobility is\nstill the same implies that for the LAO/STO the polar catastrophe model should\nbe revisited.\n", "  We present the results of an extensive observational campaign on the nearby\nType Ibn SN 2015G, including data from radio through ultraviolet wavelengths.\nSN 2015G was asymmetric, showing late-time nebular lines redshifted by ~1000\nkm/s. It shared many features with the prototypical SN In 2006jc, including\nextremely strong He I emssion lines and a late-time blue pseudocontinuum. The\nyoung SN 2015G showed narrow P-Cygni profiles of He I, but never in its\nevolution did it show any signature of hydrogen - arguing for a dense, ionized,\nand hydrogen-free circumstellar medium moving outward with a velocity of ~1000\nkm/s and created by relatively recent mass loss from the progenitor star.\nUltraviolet through infrared observations show that the fading SN 2015G (which\nwas probably discovered some 20 days post-peak) had a spectral energy\ndistribution that was well described by a simple, single-component blackbody.\nArchival HST images provide upper limits on the luminosity of SN 2015G's\nprogenitor, while nondetections of any luminous radio afterglow and optical\nnondetections of outbursts over the past two decades provide constraints upon\nits mass-loss history.\n", "  We present a formalism to calculate the orbital magnetization of interacting\nDirac fermions under a magnetic field. In this approach, the divergence\ndifficulty is overcome with a special limit of the derivative of the\nthermodynamic potential with respect to the magnetic field. The formalism\nsatisfies the particle-hole symmetry of the Dirac fermions system. We apply the\nformalism to the interacting Dirac fermions in graphene. The charge and spin\norderings and the exchange interactions between all the Landau levels are taken\ninto account by the mean-field theory. The results for the orbital\nmagnetization of interacting Dirac fermions are compared with that of\nnon-interacting cases.\n", "  The combustion characteristics of ethanol/Jet A-1 fuel droplets having three\ndifferent proportions of ethanol (10%, 30%, and 50% by vol.) are investigated\nin the present study. The large volatility differential between ethanol and Jet\nA-1 and the nominal immiscibility of the fuels seem to result in combustion\ncharacteristics that are rather different from our previous work on butanol/Jet\nA-1 droplets (miscible blends). Abrupt explosion was facilitated in fuel\ndroplets comprising lower proportions of ethanol (10%), possibly due to\ninsufficient nucleation sites inside the droplet and the partially unmixed fuel\nmixture. For the fuel droplets containing higher proportions of ethanol (30%\nand 50%), micro-explosion occurred through homogeneous nucleation, leading to\nthe ejection of secondary droplets and subsequent significant reduction in the\noverall droplet lifetime. The rate of bubble growth is nearly similar in all\nthe blends of ethanol; however, the evolution of ethanol vapor bubble is\nsignificantly faster than that of a vapor bubble in the blends of butanol. The\nprobability of disruptive behavior is considerably higher in ethanol/Jet A-1\nblends than that of butanol/Jet A-1 blends. The Sauter mean diameter of the\nsecondary droplets produced from micro-explosion is larger for blends with a\nhigher proportion of ethanol. Both abrupt explosion and micro-explosion create\na large-scale distortion of the flame, which surrounds the parent droplet. The\nsecondary droplets generated from abrupt explosion undergo rapid evaporation\nwhereas the secondary droplets from micro-explosion carry their individual\nflame and evaporate slowly. The growth of vapor bubble was also witnessed in\nthe secondary droplets, which leads to the further breakup of the droplet\n(puffing/micro-explosion).\n", "  Due to the interaction between topological defects of an order parameter and\nunderlying fermions, the defects can possess induced fermion numbers, leading\nto several exotic phenomena of fundamental importance to both condensed matter\nand high energy physics. One of the intriguing outcome of induced fermion\nnumber is the presence of fluctuating competing orders inside the core of\ntopological defect. In this regard, the interaction between fermions and\nskyrmion excitations of antiferromagnetic phase can have important consequence\nfor understanding the global phase diagrams of many condensed matter systems\nwhere antiferromagnetism and several singlet orders compete. We critically\ninvestigate the relation between fluctuating competing orders and skyrmion\nexcitations of the antiferromagnetic insulating phase of a half-filled\nKondo-Heisenberg model on honeycomb lattice. By combining analytical and\nnumerical methods we obtain exact eigenstates of underlying Dirac fermions in\nthe presence of a single skyrmion configuration, which are used for computing\ninduced chiral charge. Additionally, by employing this nonperturbative\neigenbasis we calculate the susceptibilities of different translational\nsymmetry breaking charge, bond and current density wave orders and\ntranslational symmetry preserving Kondo singlet formation. Based on the\ncomputed susceptibilities we establish spin Peierls and Kondo singlets as\ndominant competing orders of antiferromagnetism. We show favorable agreement\nbetween our findings and field theoretic predictions based on perturbative\ngradient expansion scheme which crucially relies on adiabatic principle and\nplane wave eigenstates for Dirac fermions. The methodology developed here can\nbe applied to many other correlated systems supporting competition between\nspin-triplet and spin-singlet orders in both lower and higher spatial\ndimensions.\n", "  We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of energy deposition\ninto the envelope of a red giant star as a result of the merger of two close\nmain sequence stars or brown dwarfs, and show that the outcome is a highly\nnon-spherical outflow. Such a violent interaction of a triple stellar system\ncan explain the formation of `messy', i.e., lacking any kind of symmetry,\nplanetary nebulae (PNe) and similar nebulae around evolved stars. We do not\nsimulate the merging process, but simply assume that after the tight binary\nsystem enters the envelope of the giant star the interaction with the envelope\ncauses the two components, stars or brown dwarfs, to merge and liberate\ngravitational energy. We deposit the energy over a time period of about nine\nhours, which is about one per cent of the orbital period of the merger product\naround the centre of the giant star. The ejection of the fast hot gas and its\ncollision with previously ejected mass are very likely to lead to a transient\nevent, i.e., an intermediate luminosity optical transient (ILOT).\n", "  The ability to generate and tune quantized persistent supercurrents is\ncrucial for building superconducting or atomtronic devices with novel\nfunctionalities. In ultracold atoms, previous methods for generating quantized\nsupercurrents are generally based on dynamical processes to prepare atoms in\nmetastable excited states. Here we show that arbitrary quantized circulation\nstates can be adiabatically prepared and tuned as the ground state of a\nring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate by utilizing spin-orbital-angular-momentum\n(SOAM) coupling and an external potential. There exists superfluid hysteresis\nfor tuning supercurrents between different quantization values with nonlinear\natomic interactions, which is explained by developing a nonlinear Landau-Zener\ntheory. Our work will provide a powerful platform for studying SOAM coupled\nultracold atomic gases and building novel atomtronic circuits.\n", "  We consider the ensemble of n x n 0 - 1 matrices with all column and row sums\nequal r. We give this ensemble the uniform weighting to construct a measure E.\nWe know from the work of Wanless and Pernici that E(prod_{i=1}^N\n(perm_{m_i}(A)) = prod_{i=1}^N (E(perm_{m_i}(A)) * (1+ O(1/n^4)) In this paper\nwe prove E_1(prod_{i=1}^N (perm_{m_i}(A)) = prod_{i=1}^N (E_1(perm_{m_i}(A)) *\n(1+ O(1/n^2)) where E_1 is the measure constructed on the ensemble of n x n 0 -\n1 matrices with non-negative integer entries realized as the sum of r random\npermutation matrices. E_1 is often used as an \"approximation\" to E. We have\ncomputer evidence for\n  E_1(prod_{i=1}^N (perm_{m_i}(A)) = prod_{i=1}^N (E_1(perm_{m_i}(A)) * (1+\nO(1/n^4)).\n", "  Weyl points with monopole charge $\\pm 1$ have been extensively studied,\nhowever, real materials of multi-Weyl points, whose monopole charges are higher\nthan $1$, have yet to be found. In this Rapid Communication, we show that\nnodal-line semimetals with nontrivial line connectivity provide natural\nplatforms for realizing Floquet multi-Weyl points. In particular, we show that\ndriving crossing nodal lines by circularly polarized light generates\ndouble-Weyl points. Furthermore, we show that monopole combination and\nannihilation can be observed in crossing-nodal-line semimetals and nodal-chain\nsemimetals. These proposals can be experimentally verified in pump-probe\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.\n", "  Ground-based observations of the Earthshine, i.e., the light scattered by\nEarth to the Moon, and then reflected back to Earth, simulate space\nobservations of our planet and represent a powerful benchmark for the studies\nof Earth-like planets. Earthshine spectra are strongly linearly polarized,\nowing to scattering by molecules and small particles in the atmosphere of the\nEarth and surface reflection, and may allow us to measure global atmospheric\nand surface properties of planet Earth. Aims. We aim to interpret already\npublished spectropolarimetric observations of the Earthshine by comparing them\nwith new radiative transfer model simulations including a fully realistic\nthree-dimensional (3D) surface-atmosphere model for planet Earth. We used the\nhighly advanced Monte Carlo radiative transfer model MYSTIC to simulate\npolarized radiative transfer in the atmosphere of the Earth without\napproximations regarding the geometry, taking into account the polarization\nfrom surface reflection and multiple scattering by molecules, aerosol\nparticles, cloud droplets, and ice crystals. We have shown that Earth\nspectropolarimetry is highly sensitive to all these input parameters, and we\nhave presented simulations of a fully realistic Earth atmosphere-surface model\nincluding 3D cloud fields and two-dimensional (2D) surface property maps. Our\nmodeling results show that scattering in high ice water clouds and reflection\nfrom the ocean surface are crucial to explain the continuum polarization at\nlonger wavelengths as has been reported in Earthshine observations taken at the\nVery Large Telescope in 2011 (3.8 % and 6.6 % at 800 nm, depending on which\npart of Earth was visible from the Moon at the time of the observations). We\nfound that the relatively high degree of polarization of 6.6 % can be\nattributed to light reflected by the ocean surface in the sunglint region.\n", "  To guarantee the availability and reliability of data source in Magnetic\nConfinement Fusion (MCF) devices, incorrect diagnostic data, which cannot\nreflect real physical properties of measured objects, should be sorted out\nbefore further analysis and study. Traditional data sorting cannot meet the\ngrowing demand of MCF research because of the low-efficiency, time-delay, and\nlack of objective criteria. In this paper, a Time-Domain Global Similarity\n(TDGS) method based on machine learning technologies is proposed for the\nautomatic data cleaning of MCF devices. Traditional data sorting aims to the\nclassification of original diagnostic data sequences, which are different in\nboth length and evolution properties under various discharge parameters. Hence\nthe classification criteria are affected by many discharge parameters and vary\nshot by shot. The focus of TDGS method is turned to the physical similarity\nbetween data sequences from different channels, which are more essential and\nindependent of discharge parameters. The complexity arisen from real discharge\nparameters during data cleaning is avoided in the TDGS method by transforming\nthe general data sorting problem into a binary classification problem about the\nphysical similarity between data sequences. As a demonstration of its\napplication to multi-channel measurement systems, the TDGS method is applied to\nthe EAST POlarimeter-INterferomeTer (POINT) system. The optimized performance\nof the method has reached 0.9871.\n", "  Thermoelectric properties of monolayer indium selenide (InSe) are\ninvestigated by using Boltzman transport theory and first-principles\ncalculations as a function of Fermi energy and crystal orientation. We find\nthat the maximum power factor of p-type (n-type) monolayer InSe can be as large\nas 0.049 (0.043) W/K$^2$m at 300 K in the armchair direction. The excellent\nthermoelectric performance of monolayer InSe is attributed to both of its\nSeebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. The large Seebeck coefficient\noriginates from the moderate (about 2 eV) band gap of monolayer InSe as an\nindirect gap semiconductor, while its large electrical conductivity is due to\nits unique two-dimensional density of states (DOS), which consists of an almost\nconstant DOS near the conduction band bottom and a sharp peak near the valence\nband top.\n", "  A substantial control of dispersion features of the hybrid EH01 and HE11\nmodes of a circular waveguide which is completely filled by a longitudinally\nmagnetized composite finely-stratified ferrite-semiconductor structure is\ndiscussed. A relation between the resonant conditions of such a composite\ngyroelectromagnetic filling of the circular waveguide and dispersion features\nof the supported modes are studied. Three distinct frequency bands with the\nsingle-mode operation under normal as well as anomalous dispersion conditions\nof the EH01 mode are identified by solving an optimization problem with respect\nto the filling factors of the composite medium. The possibility of achieving\nisolated propagation of the HE11 mode is revealed.\n", "  The question of suitability of transfer matrix description of electrons\ntraversing grating-type dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) structures is\naddressed. It is shown that although matrix considerations lead to interesting\ninsights, the basic transfer properties of DLA cells cannot be described by a\nmatrix. A more general notion of a transfer function is shown to be a simple\nand useful tool for formulating problems of particle dynamics in DLA. As an\nexample, a focusing structure is proposed which works simultaneously for all\nelectron phases.\n", "  The minimization of the length of syntactic dependencies is a\nwell-established principle of word order and the basis of a mathematical theory\nof word order. Here we complete that theory from the perspective of information\ntheory, adding a competing word order principle: the maximization of\npredictability of a target element. These two principles are in conflict: to\nmaximize the predictability of the head, the head should appear last, which\nmaximizes the costs with respect to dependency length minimization. The\nimplications of such a broad theoretical framework to understand the\noptimality, diversity and evolution of the six possible orderings of subject,\nobject and verb are reviewed.\n", "  We present covariant quantization rules for nonsingular finite dimensional\nclassical theories with flat and curved configuration spaces. In the beginning,\nwe construct a family of covariant quantizations in flat spaces and Cartesian\ncoordinates. This family is parametrized by a function $\\omega(\\theta)$,\n$\\theta\\in\\left( 1,0\\right)$, which describes an ambiguity of the quantization.\nWe generalize this construction presenting covariant quantizations of theories\nwith flat configuration spaces but already with arbitrary curvilinear\ncoordinates. Then we construct a so-called minimal family of covariant\nquantizations for theories with curved configuration spaces. This family of\nquantizations is parametrized by the same function $\\omega \\left( \\theta\n\\right)$. Finally, we describe a more wide family of covariant quantizations in\ncurved spaces. This family is already parametrized by two functions, the\nprevious one $\\omega(\\theta)$ and by an additional function $\\Theta \\left(\nx,\\xi \\right)$. The above mentioned minimal family is a part at $\\Theta =1$ of\nthe wide family of quantizations. We study constructed quantizations in detail,\nproving their consistency and covariance. As a physical application, we\nconsider a quantization of a non-relativistic particle moving in a curved\nspace, discussing the problem of a quantum potential. Applying the covariant\nquantizations in flat spaces to an old problem of constructing quantum\nHamiltonian in Polar coordinates, we directly obtain a correct result.\n", "  A detailed study on the crystal structure and bulk magnetic properties of Cr\nsubstituted Ising type lanthanide gallium garnets\n$Ln_3\\text{CrGa}_4\\text{O}_{12}$ ($Ln$ = Tb, Dy, Ho) has been carried out using\nroom temperature powder X-Ray and neutron diffraction, magnetic susceptibility,\nisothermal magnetisation and heat capacity measurements. The magnetocaloric\neffect (MCE) in $Ln_3\\text{CrGa}_4\\text{O}_{12}$ is compared to that of\n$Ln_3\\text{Ga}_5\\text{O}_{12}$. In lower magnetic fields attainable by a\npermanent magnet ($\\leq$ 2 T), Cr substitution greatly enhances the MCE by 20%\nfor $Ln$ = Dy and 120% for $Ln$ = Ho compared to the unsubstituted\n$Ln_3\\text{Ga}_5\\text{O}_{12}$. This is likely due to changes in the magnetic\nground state as Cr substitution also significantly reduces the frustration in\nthe magnetic lattice for the Ising type $Ln_3\\text{Ga}_5\\text{O}_{12}$.\n", "  Topological phases of matter are often characterized by interface states,\nwhich were already known to occur at the boundary of a band-inverted junction\nin semiconductor heterostructures. In IV-VI compounds such interface states are\nproperly described by a two-band model, predicting the appearance of a Dirac\ncone in single junctions. We study the quantum-confined Stark effect of\ninterface states due to an electric field perpendicular to a band-inverted\njunction. We find a closed expression to obtain the interface dispersion\nrelation at any field strength and show that the Dirac cone widens under an\napplied bias. Thus, the Fermi velocity can be substantially lowered even at\nmoderate fields, paving the way for tunable band-engineered devices based on\nband-inverted junctions.\n", "  We investigate the relation between vacuum energy and the hierarchy of forces\nin habitable universes. The hierarchy of forces studied in \\cite{fred} was\nbound by $\\frac{\\alpha_G}{\\alpha} \\le 10^{-34}$, using structure formation\narguments which involve the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ and the\ngravitational constant $\\alpha_G$. Previously we showed that the requirement of\nvacuum domination epoch occuring after matter radiation equality time, places a\nbound on vacuum energy in terms of the density perturbation parameter Q. Here\nwe impose a further condition: we require that at equality time the size of the\ngas cloud which forms a galaxy at virialization time, be smaller than the\nhorizon size. The latter condition leads to an intriguing relation whereby\nvacuum energy is bound by a power law function of the hierarchy of forces. The\nconstraint introduced by the hierarchy of forces on the amount of dark energy\nis suggestive of an unknown microphysical mechanism that relates vacuum energy\nto the other constants of nature, specifically to the gravitational and fine\nstructure constants and to their hierarchy.\n", "  We consider the BRST symmetric four dimensional BF theory, a topological\ntheory, containing antysymmetric tensor fields in Landau gauge and extend the\nBRST symmetry by introducing a shift symmetry to it. Within this formulation,\nthe antighost fields corresponding to shift symmetry coincide with antifields\nof standard field/antifield formulation. Further, we provide a superspace\ndescription for the BF model possessing extended BRST and extended anti-BRST\ntransformations.\n", "  In a first-principles study based on many-body perturbation theory, we\nanalyze the optical excitations of azobenzene-functionalized SAMs with\nincreasing packing density and different terminations, considering for\ncomparison the corresponding gas-phase molecules and dimers. The intermolecular\ncoupling increases with the density of the chromophores independently of the\nfunctional groups. The intense $\\pi\\rightarrow\\pi^*$ resonance that triggers\nphoto-isomerization is present in the spectra of isolated dimers and diluted\nSAMs, but it is almost completely washed out in tightly packed architectures.\nIntermolecular coupling is partially inhibited by mixing differently\nfunctionalized azobenzene derivatives, in particular when large groups are\ninvolved. In this way the excitation band inducing the photo-isomerization\nprocess is partially preserved and the effects of dense packing partly\ncounterbalanced. Our results suggest that a tailored design of\nazobenzene-functionalized SAMs, that optimizes the interplay between the\npacking density of the chromophores and their termination, can lead to\nsignificant improvements in the photo-switching efficiency of these systems.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers are highly interesting for\npotential valleytronic applications due to the coupling of spin and valley\ndegrees of freedom and valley-selective excitonic transitions. However,\nultrafast recombination of excitons in these materials poses a natural limit\nfor applications, so that a transfer of polarization to resident carriers is\nhighly advantageous. Here, we study the low-temperature spin-valley dynamics in\nnominally undoped and n-doped MoSe$_2$ monolayers using time-resolved Kerr\nrotation. In the n-doped MoSe$_2$, we find a long-lived component of the Kerr\nsignal which we attribute to the spin polarization of resident carriers. This\ncomponent is absent in the nominally undoped MoSe$_2$. The long-lived spin\npolarization is stable under applied in-plane magnetic fields. Spatially\nresolved measurements allow us to determine an upper boundary for the electron\nspin diffusion constant in MoSe$_2$.\n", "  We study the effect of external companion on the orbital and spin evolution\nof merging black-hole (BH) binaries. An sufficiently close by and inclined\ncompanion can excite Lidov-Kozai (LK) eccentricity oscillations in the binary,\nthereby shortening its merger time. During such LK-enhanced orbital decay, the\nspin axis of the BH generally exhibits chaotic evolution, leading to a wide\nrange ($0^\\circ$-$180^\\circ$) of final spin-orbit misalignment angle from an\ninitially aligned configuration. For systems that do not experience\neccentricity excitation, only modest ($\\lesssim 20^\\circ$) spin-orbit\nmisalignment can be produced, and we derive an analytic expression for the\nfinal misalignment using the principle of adiabatic invariance. The spin-orbit\nmisalignment directly impacts the gravitational waveform, and can be used to\nconstrain the formation scenarios of BH binaries and dynamical influences of\nexternal companions.\n", "  We present a systematic analysis of the dynamics of flat\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmological models with radiation and\ndust matter in generalized teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity. We show that the\ncosmological dynamics of this model is fully described by a function $W(H)$ of\nthe Hubble parameter, which is constructed from the function $f(T)$. After\nreducing the phase space to two dimensions we derive the conditions on $W(H)$\nfor the occurrence of de Sitter fixed points, accelerated expansion, crossing\nthe phantom divide, and finite time singularities. Depending on the model\nparameters it is possible to have a bounce (from contraction to expansion) or a\nturnaround (from expansion to contraction), but cyclic or oscillating scenarios\nare prohibited. As an illustration of the formalism we consider power law $f(T)\n= T + \\alpha(-T)^n$ models, and show that these allow only one period of\nacceleration and no phantom divide crossing.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dynamical Casimir effect in a single-mode\ncavity endowed with a driven off-resonant mirror. We explore the dynamics of\nphoton generation as a function of the ratio between the cavity mode and the\nmirror's driving frequency. Interestingly, we find that this ratio defines a\nthreshold---which we referred to as a metal-insulator phase\ntransition---between an exponential growth and a low photon production. The low\nphoton production is due to Bloch-like oscillations that produce a strong\nlocalization of the initial vacuum state, thus preventing higher generation of\nphotons. To break localization of the vacuum state, and enhance the photon\ngeneration, we impose a dephasing mechanism, based on dynamic disorder, into\nthe driving frequency of the mirror. Additionally, we explore the effects of\nfinite temperature on the photon production. Concurrently, we propose a\nclassical analogue of the dynamical Casimir effect in engineered photonic\nlattices, where the propagation of classical light emulates the photon\ngeneration from the quantum vacuum of a single-mode tunable cavity.\n", "  We present a detailed numerical investigation of five nonlinear materials and\ntheir properties regarding photon-pair creation using parametric\ndownconversion. Periodic poling of ferroelectric nonlinear materials is a\nconvenient way to generate collinearly propagating photon pairs. Most\napplications and experiments use the well-known potassium titanyl phosphate\n(KTiOPO4, ppKTP) and lithium niobate (LiNbO3, ppLN) crystals for this purpose.\nIn this article we provide a profound discussion on the family of\nKTP-isomorphic nonlinear materials, including KTP itself but also the much less\ncommon CTA (CsTiOAsO4), KTA (KTiOAsO4), RTA (RbTiOAsO4) and RTP (RbTiOPO4). We\ndiscuss in which way these crystals can be used for creation of spectrally pure\ndownconversion states and generation of crystal-intrinsic polarisation- and\nfrequency entanglement. The investigation of the new materials disclosed a\nwhole new range of promising experimental setups, in some cases even\noutperforming the established materials ppLN and ppKTP.\n", "  In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) searches for the heaviest\nCP-even and CP-odd Higgs $H$, $A$ to tau-lepton pairs severely constrain the\nparameter region for large values of $\\tan\\beta$ and light Higgs bosons $H$,\n$A$. We demonstrate how the experimental constraint can be avoided by new\ndecays to light third-generation sfermions, whose left-right couplings to $H$\ncan be maximised in regions of large trilinear couplings $A_{b}$, $A_{\\tau}$\nfor sbottoms and staus, or large supersymmetric (SUSY) Higgs mass $\\mu$ for\nstops. Due to the $\\tan\\beta$-enhancement in the production cross-sections via\ngluon-fusion and in association with bottom-quark pairs for $H$ and $A$, we\nfind that down-type sfermions, in particular, sbottoms perform a better job in\nallowing more parameter space than up-type sfermions such as stops, which\nrequire much larger values of $\\mu$ to compensate for $\\tan\\beta$. Vacuum\nstability as well as flavour observables constraints and direct searches for\nSUSY particles are imposed. We also associate the lightest CP-even Higgs with\nthe observed 125 GeV SM-like Higgs and impose the experimental constraints from\nthe LHC.\n", "  Considering a certain interpolation problem, we derive a series of elliptic\ndifference isomonodromic systems together with their Lax forms. These systems\ngive a multivariate extension of the elliptic Painlev\\'e equation.\n", "  With the discovery of gravitational waves (GW), attention has turned towards\ndetecting counterparts to these sources. In discussions on counterpart\nsignatures and multi-messenger follow-up strategies to GW detections,\nultra-violet (UV) signatures have largely been neglected, due to UV facilities\nbeing limited to SWIFT, which lacks high-cadence UV survey capabilities. In\nthis paper, we examine the UV signatures from merger models for the major GW\nsources, highlighting the need for further modelling, while presenting\nrequirements and a design for an effective UV survey telescope. Using $u'$-band\nmodels as an analogue, we find that a UV survey telescope requires a limiting\nmagnitude of m$_{u'}\\rm (AB)\\approx 24$ to fully complement the aLIGO range and\nsky localisation. We show that a network of small, balloon-based UV telescopes\nwith a primary mirror diameter of 30~cm could be capable of covering the aLIGO\ndetection distance from $\\sim$60--100\\% for BNS events and $\\sim$40\\% for BHNS\nevents. The sensitivity of UV emission to initial conditions suggests that a UV\nsurvey telescope would provide a unique dataset, that can act as an effective\ndiagnostic to discriminate between models.\n", "  We study a general phase transition between spinless topological nodal-line\nsemimetal and Weyl semimetal phases. We classify topological nodal lines into\ntwo types based on their positions and shapes, and their phase transitions\ndepends on their types. We show that the topological nodal-line semimetal\nbecomes the Weyl semimetal by breaking time-reversal symmetry when the nodal\nlines enclose time-reversal invariant momenta (type-A nodal lines). We also\ndiscuss an effect of crystallographic symmetries determining the band structure\nof the topological nodal-line semimetals. Thanks to protection by the\nsymmetries, the topological nodal-line semimetals can transit into the spinless\nWeyl semimetals or maintain the nodal lines in many crystals after inversion\nsymmetry is broken.\n", "  It has been known for long that the fluctuation surface tension of membranes\n$r$, computed from the height fluctuation spectrum, is not equal to the bare\nsurface tension $\\sigma$ introduced in the Helfrich theory. In this work we\nrelate these two surface tensions both analytically and numerically and compare\nthem to the Laplace tension $\\gamma$, and the mechanical frame tension $\\tau$.\nUsing one-loop renormalisation calculations, we obtain, in addition to the\neffective bending modulus $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$, a new expression for the\neffective surface tension $\\sigma_{\\rm eff}=\\sigma - \\epsilon k_{\\rm\nB}T/(2a_p)$ where $a_p$ the projected cut-off area, and $\\epsilon=3$ or 1\naccording to the allowed configurations. Moreover we show that the crumpling\ntransition for an infinite planar membrane occurs for $\\sigma_{\\rm eff}=0$, and\nalso that it coincides with vanishing Laplace and frame tensions. Using\nextensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, triangulated membranes of vesicles made\nof $N=100-2500$ vertices are simulated. No local constraint is applied. It is\nshown that the numerical $r$ is equal to $\\sigma_{\\rm eff}$ both with radial MC\nmoves ($\\epsilon=3$) and with corrected MC moves locally normal to the\nfluctuating membrane ($\\epsilon=1$). For finite vesicles of typical size $R$,\ntwo different regimes are defined: a tension regime for $\\hat \\sigma_{\\rm\neff}=\\sigma_{\\rm eff}R^2/\\kappa_{\\rm eff}>0$ and a bending one for $-1<\\hat\n\\sigma_{\\rm eff}<0$. A shape transition from a quasi-spherical shape imposed by\nthe large surface energy, to more deformed shapes only controlled by the\nbending energy, is observed numerically at $\\hat \\sigma_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 0$. We\npropose that the buckling transition, observed for planar supported membranes\nin the literature, occurs for $\\hat \\sigma_{\\rm eff}\\simeq-1$, the associated\nnegative frame tension playing the role of a compressive force.\n", "  We recently proposed a new variational theory of \"tensor-optimized\nantisymmetrized molecular dynamics\" (TOAMD), which treats the strong\ninteraction explicitly for finite nuclei [T. Myo et al., Prog. Theor. Exp.\nPhys. 2015, 073D02 (2015)]. In TOAMD, the correlation functions for the tensor\nforce and the short-range repulsion and their multiple products are\nsuccessively operated to the AMD state. The correlated Hamiltonian is expanded\ninto many-body operators by using the cluster expansion and all the resulting\noperators are taken into account in the calculation without any truncation. We\nshow detailed results for TOAMD with the nucleon-nucleon interaction\nAV8$^\\prime$ for $s$-shell nuclei. The binding energy and the Hamiltonian\ncomponents are successively converged to exact values of the few-body\ncalculations. We also apply TOAMD to the Malfliet-Tjon central potential having\na strong short-range repulsion. TOAMD can treat the short-range correlation and\nprovided accurate energies of $s$-shell nuclei, reproducing the results of\nfew-body calculations. It turns out that the numerical accuracy of TOAMD with\ndouble products of the correlation functions is beyond the variational Monte\nCarlo method with Jastrow's product-type correlation functions.\n", "  We suggest a method to compute the correlation functions in conformal quantum\nmechanics (CFT$_1$) for the fields that transform under a non-local\nrepresentation of $\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ basing on the invariance properties.\nExplicit calculations of 2- and 3-point correlation functions are presented.\n", "  There is a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the terrestrial\nplanets' water as well as the hydrated C-type asteroids. Here we show that the\ninner Solar System's water is a simple byproduct of the giant planets'\nformation. Giant planet cores accrete gas slowly until the conditions are met\nfor a rapid phase of runaway growth. As a gas giant's mass rapidly increases,\nthe orbits of nearby planetesimals are destabilized and gravitationally\nscattered in all directions. Under the action of aerodynamic gas drag, a\nfraction of scattered planetesimals are deposited onto stable orbits interior\nto Jupiter's. This process is effective in populating the outer main belt with\nC-type asteroids that originated from a broad (5-20 AU-wide) region of the\ndisk. As the disk starts to dissipate, scattered planetesimals reach\nsufficiently eccentric orbits to cross the terrestrial planet region and\ndeliver water to the growing Earth. This mechanism does not depend strongly on\nthe giant planets' orbital migration history and is generic: whenever a giant\nplanet forms it invariably pollutes its inner planetary system with water-rich\nbodies.\n", "  Some recent studies exposed rather strong statistical evidence of\nin-vacuo-dispersion-like spectral lags for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a linear\ncorrelation between time of observation and energy of GRB particles. Those\nresults focused on testing in-vacuo dispersion for the most energetic GRB\nparticles, and in particular only included photons with energy at emission\ngreater than 40 GeV. We here extend the window of the statistical analysis down\nto 5 GeV and find results that are consistent with what had been previously\nnoticed at higher energies.\n", "  We present experimental phase functions of three types of millimeter-sized\ndust grains consisting of enstatite, quartz and volcanic material from Mount\nEtna, respectively. The three grains present similar sizes but different\nabsorbing properties. The measurements are performed at 527 nm covering the\nscattering angle range from 3 to 170 degrees. The measured phase functions show\ntwo well defined regions i) soft forward peaks and ii) a continuous increase\nwith the scattering angle at side- and back-scattering regions. This behavior\nat side- and back-scattering regions are in agreement with the observed phase\nfunctions for the Fomalhaut and HR 4796A dust rings. Further computations and\nmeasurements (including polarization) for millimeter sized-grains are needed to\ndraw some conclusions about the fluffy or compact structure of the dust grains.\n", "  Various aspects of the Generalised Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for QCD in four\ndimensions are reviewed. The properties of mesonic excitations are discussed in\ndetail, with special attention paid to the chiral pion. The spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking in the vacuum and the effective chiral symmetry restoration\nin the spectrum of highly excited mesons and baryons are described\nmicroscopically.\n", "  We bound an exponential sum that appears in the study of irregularities of\ndistribution (the low-frequency Fourier energy of the sum of several Dirac\nmeasures) by geometric quantities: a special case is that for all $\\left\\{ x_1,\n\\dots, x_N\\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{T}^2$, $X \\geq 1$ and a universal $c>0$ $$\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}{ \\frac{X^2}{1 + X^4 \\|x_i -x_j\\|^4}} \\lesssim \\sum_{k \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\atop \\|k\\| \\leq X}{ \\left| \\sum_{n=1}^{N}{ e^{2 \\pi i\n\\left\\langle k, x_n \\right\\rangle}}\\right|^2} \\lesssim \\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}{ X^2\ne^{-c X^2\\|x_i -x_j\\|^2}}.$$ Since this exponential sum is intimately tied to\nrather subtle distribution properties of the points, we obtain nonlocal\nstructural statements for near-minimizers of the Riesz-type energy. In the\nregime $X \\gtrsim N^{1/2}$ both upper and lower bound match for\nmaximally-separated point sets satisfying $\\|x_i -x_j\\| \\gtrsim N^{-1/2}$.\n", "  Poor economies not only produce less; they typically produce things that\ninvolve fewer inputs and fewer intermediate steps. Yet the supply chains of\npoor countries face more frequent disruptions---delivery failures, faulty\nparts, delays, power outages, theft, government failures---that systematically\nthwart the production process. To understand how these disruptions affect\neconomic development, we model an evolving input--output network in which\ndisruptions spread contagiously among optimizing agents. The key finding is\nthat a poverty trap can emerge: agents adapt to frequent disruptions by\nproducing simpler, less valuable goods, yet disruptions persist. Growing out of\npoverty requires that agents invest in buffers to disruptions. These buffers\nrise and then fall as the economy produces more complex goods, a prediction\nconsistent with global patterns of input inventories. Large jumps in economic\ncomplexity can backfire. This result suggests why \"big push\" policies can fail,\nand it underscores the importance of reliability and of gradual increases in\ntechnological complexity.\n", "  Most optical and IR spectra are now acquired using detectors with\nfinite-width pixels in a square array. This paper examines the effects of such\npixellation, using computed simulations to illustrate the effects which most\nconcern the astronomer end-user. Coarse sampling increases the random noise\nerrors in wavelength by typically 10 - 20% at 2 pixels/FWHM, but with wide\nvariation depending on the functional form of the instrumental Line Spread\nFunction (LSF) and on the pixel phase. Line widths are even more strongly\naffected at low sampling frequencies. However, the noise in fitted peak\namplitudes is minimally affected. Pixellation has a substantial but complex\neffect on the ability to see a relative minimum between two closely-spaced\npeaks (or relative maximum between two absorption lines). The consistent scale\nof resolving power presented by Robertson (2013) is extended to cover\npixellated spectra. The systematic bias errors in wavelength introduced by\npixellation are examined. While they may be negligible for smooth well-sampled\nsymmetric LSFs, they are very sensitive to asymmetry and high spatial frequency\nsubstructure. The Modulation Transfer Function for sampled data is shown to\ngive a useful indication of the extent of improperly sampled signal in an LSF.\nThe common maxim that 2 pixels/FWHM is the Nyquist limit is incorrect and most\nLSFs will exhibit some aliasing at this sample frequency. While 2 pixels/FWHM\nis often an acceptable minimum for moderate signal/noise work, it is preferable\nto carry out simulations for any actual or proposed LSF to find the effects of\nsampling frequency. Where end-users have a choice of sampling frequencies,\nthrough on-chip binning and/or spectrograph configurations, the instrument user\nmanual should include an examination of their effects. (Abridged)\n", "  Regulatory frameworks are a common tool in governance to incent and coerce\nbehaviors supporting national or strategic stability. This includes domestic\nregulations and international agreements. Though regulation is always a\nchallenge, the domain of fast evolving threats, like cyber, are proving much\nmore difficult to control. Many discussions are underway searching for\napproaches that can provide national security in these domains. We use game\ntheoretic learning models to explore the question of strategic stability with\nrespect to the democratization of certain technologies (such as cyber). We\nsuggest that such many-player games could inherently be chaotic with no\ncorresponding (Nash) equilibria. In the absence of such equilibria, traditional\napproaches, as measures to achieve levels of overall security, may not be\nsuitable approaches to support strategic stability in these domains. Altogether\nnew paradigms may be needed for these issues. At the very least, regulatory\nregimes that fail to address the basic nature of the technology domains should\nnot be pursued as a default solution, regardless of success in other domains.\nIn addition, the very chaotic nature of these domains may hold the promise of\nnovel approaches to regulation.\n", "  A systematic study of the structural and magnetic properties of\nthree-dimensionally frustrated lanthanide garnets $Ln_3A_2X_3\\text{O}_{12}$,\n$Ln$ = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, $A$ = Ga, Sc, In, Te, $X$ = Ga, Al, Li is presented.\nGarnets with $Ln$ = Gd show magnetic behaviour consistent with isotropic\nGd$^{3+}$ spins; no magnetic ordering is observed for T $\\geq$ 0.4 K. Magnetic\nordering features are seen for garnets with $Ln$ = Tb, Dy, Ho in the\ntemperature range 0.4 < T < 2.5 K, however the nature of the magnetic ordering\nvaries for the different $Ln$ as well as for different combinations of $A$ and\n$X$. The changes in magnetic behaviour can be explained by tuning of the\nmagnetic interactions and changes in the single-ion anisotropy. The change in\nmagnetic entropy is evaluated from isothermal magnetisation measurements to\ncharacterise the magnetocaloric effect in these materials. Among the Gd\ngarnets, the maximum change in magnetic entropy per mole (15.45 J K$^{-1}$\nmol$_{\\text{Gd}}^{-1}$) is observed for Gd$_3$Sc$_2$Ga$_3$O$_{12}$ at 2 K, in a\nfield of 9 T. The performance of Dy$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ as a magnetocaloric\nmaterial surpasses the other garnets with $Ln$ = Tb, Dy, Ho.\n", "  The bulk magnetic properties of the lanthanide metaborates, $Ln$(BO$_2$)$_3$,\n$Ln$ = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb are studied using magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity\nand isothermal magnetisation measurements. They crystallise in a monoclinic\nstructure containing chains of magnetic $Ln^{3+}$ and could therefore exhibit\nfeatures of low-dimensional magnetism and frustration. Pr(BO$_2$)$_3$ is found\nto have a non-magnetic singlet ground state. No magnetic ordering is observed\ndown to 0.4 K for Nd(BO$_2$)$_3$. Gd(BO$_2$)$_3$ exhibits a sharp magnetic\ntransition at 1.1 K, corresponding to three-dimensional magnetic ordering.\nTb(BO$_2$)$_3$ shows two magnetic ordering features at 1.05 K and 1.95 K. A\nmagnetisation plateau at a third of the saturation magnetisation is seen at 2 K\nfor both Nd(BO$_2$)$_3$ and Tb(BO$_2$)$_3$ which persists in an applied field\nof 14 T. This is proposed to be a signature of quasi one-dimensional behaviour\nin Nd(BO$_2$)$_3$ and Tb(BO$_2$)$_3$.\n", "  Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) was investigated in the single crystal of\nCsGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$ in the temperature range from 2 to 30 K and fields up to 5 T\napplied along the easy and hard magnetic axis. The analysis of specific heat\nand magnetization provided the refinement of crystal electric field (CEF)\nparameters supporting the dominance of uniaxial symmetry. The knowledge of CEF\nenergy levels enabled the extrapolation of MCE parameters outside the\nexperimental region. Consequently, maximum values of the isothermal entropy\nchange, $-\\Delta S_{\\rm M}$, in magnetic fields up to 5 T are expected to occur\nat temperatures between 1 and 2 K. While $-\\Delta S_{\\rm M}$ achieves 19.2\nJ/kgK already for the field 1 T, for the field change 7 T, maximal $-\\Delta\nS_{\\rm M}$ $\\approx$ 26.8 J/kgK with a refrigerant capacity of 215 J/kg is\nexpected. The absence of thermal hysteresis and the losses due to eddy currents\nas well as good chemical stability makes the compound CsGd(MoO$_4$)$_2$\nattractive for magnetic refrigeration at low temperatures. The possibilities of\nfurther enhancement of MCE parameters are discussed.\n", "  We have obtained CO(J=2-1) spectra of nine face-on low surface brightness\ngalaxies(LSBGs) using the JCMT 15-meter telescope and observed Ha images using\nthe 2.16-meter telescope of NAOC. As no CO has been detected, only upper limits\non the H2 masses are given. The upper limits of total molecular hydrogen masses\nare about (1.2-82.4) x 10^7 Msun. Their star formation rates are mainly lower\nthan 0.4 Msun/yr and star formation efficiencies are lower than 1.364 x 10^10\n/yr. Our results show that the absence of molecular gas content is the direct\nreason for the low star formation rate. The low star formation efficiency\nprobably resulted from the low efficiency of HI gas transforming to H2 gas.\n", "  We elucidate the origin of the phonon-mediated superconductivity in\n2$H$-NbS$_2$ using the ab initio anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory including\nCoulomb interactions. We demonstrate that superconductivity is associated with\nFermi surface hot spots exhibiting an unusually strong electron-phonon\ninteraction. The electron-lattice coupling is dominated by low-energy\nanharmonic phonons, which place the system on the verge of a charge density\nwave instability. We also provide definitive evidence for two-gap\nsuperconductivity in 2$H$-NbS$_2$, and show that the low- and high-energy peaks\nobserved in tunneling spectra correspond to the $\\Gamma$- and $K$-centered\nFermi surface pockets, respectively. The present findings call for further\nefforts to determine whether our proposed mechanism underpins superconductivity\nin the whole family of metallic transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  In a recent paper (J. Chem. Theory. Comput., 2017, 13, 180-190) we proposed\nthe Truncated Conjugate Gradient (TCG) approach to compute the polarization\nenergy and forces in polarizable molecular simulations. The method consists in\ntruncating the Conjugate Gradient algorithm at a fixed predetermined order\nleading to a fixed computational cost and can thus be considered\n\"non-iterative\". This gives the possibility to derive analytical forces\navoiding the usual energy conservation (i.e. drifts) issues occurring with\niterative approaches. A key point concerns the evaluation of the 1\n", "  Traditional approach on quantum Zeno effect (QZE) and quantum anti-Zeno\neffect (QAZE) in open quantum systems (implicitly) assumes the bath\n(environment) state returning to its original state after each instantaneous\nprojective measurement on the system and thus ignores the cross-correlations of\nthe bath operators between different Zeno intervals. However, this assumption\nis not generally true, especially for a bath with a considerably non-negligible\nmemory effect and for a system repeatedly projected into an initial general\nsuperposition state. We find that in stark contrast to the result of a constant\nvalue found in the traditional approach, the scaled average decay rate in unit\nZeno interval of the survival probability is generally time-dependent or has an\noscillatory behavior. In the case of strong bath correlation, the transition\nbetween the QZE and QAZE depends sensitively on the number of measurements $N$.\nFor a fixed $N$, a QZE region predicted by the tradition approach may be in\nfact already in the QAZE region. We illustrate our findings using an exactly\nsolvable open qubit system model with a Lorentzian bath spectral density, which\nis directly related to realistic circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics\nsystems. Thus the results and dynamics presented here can be verified by\ncurrent superconducting circuit technology.\n", "  We study rapidly-rotating Boussinesq convection driven by internal heating in\na full sphere. We use a numerical model based on the quasi-geostrophic\napproximation for the velocity field, whereas the temperature field is\nthree-dimensional. This approximation allows us to perform simulations for\nEkman numbers down to 1e-8, Prandtl numbers relevant for liquid metals (~0.1)\nand Reynolds numbers up to 3e4. Persistent zonal flows composed of multiple\njets form as a result of the mixing of potential vorticity. For the largest\nRayleigh numbers computed, the zonal velocity is larger than the convective\nvelocity despite the presence of boundary friction. The convective structures\nand the zonal jets widen when the thermal forcing increases. Prograde and\nretrograde zonal jets are dynamically different: in the prograde jets (which\ncorrespond to weak potential vorticity gradients) the convection transports\nheat efficiently and the mean temperature tends to be homogenised; by contrast,\nin the cores of the retrograde jets (which correspond to steep gradients of\npotential vorticity) the dynamics is dominated by the propagation of Rossby\nwaves, resulting in the formation of steep mean temperature gradients and the\ndominance of conduction in the heat transfer process. Consequently, in\nquasi-geostrophic systems, the width of the retrograde zonal jets controls the\nefficiency of the heat transfer.\n", "  The merger scenario of two galaxy subclusters to form the massive galaxy\ncluster 'El Gordo' is investigated using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nsimulations. Idealized cluster models are used to initialize the states of both\nsubclusters prior to the merger, assuming the commonly used Navarro-Frenk-White\n(NFW) dark matter (DM) density profile and solving the hydrostatic equilibrium\nequation for a ${\\beta}$-model with ${\\beta}$ = 0.6 to obtain the gas density\nprofile. The impact parameter (P) and zero-energy orbit fraction (${\\epsilon}$)\nof the two merging subclusters are varied to put constraints on the space of\nparameter values which result in projections of X-ray luminosity,\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, and DM density that correlate well with\nobservational features of 'El Gordo'. We are able to reproduce the remarkable\nwake-like feature seen in X-ray observations that trails after the secondary\n(bullet) subcluster as well as the rough shape of the combined cluster with P ~\n800 kpc and ${\\epsilon}$ = 0.6, which corroborate the results of prior\nsimulations that support an off-axis, high-speed collision as the merger\nscenario. We argue that the large separation distance between the mass centers\nof the two subclusters in this merger scenario may be resolved by finding a\nbetter fit for other parameters in the idealized subcluster models.\n", "  We analyse the linear confinement of a Majorana fermion in\n$\\left(1+1\\right)$-dimensions. We show that the Dirac equation can be solved\nanalytically. Besides, we show that the spectrum of energy is discrete,\nhowever, the energy levels are not equally spaced.\n", "  We present analytical results for the distribution of shortest path lengths\n(DSPL) in a network growth model which evolves by node duplication (ND). The\nmodel captures essential properties of the structure and growth dynamics of\nsocial networks, acquaintance networks and scientific citation networks, where\nduplication mechanisms play a major role. Starting from an initial seed\nnetwork, at each time step a random node, referred to as a mother node, is\nselected for duplication. Its daughter node is added to the network, forming a\nlink to the mother node, and with probability $p$ to each one of its neighbors.\nThe degree distribution of the resulting network turns out to follow a\npower-law distribution, thus the ND network is a scale-free network. To\ncalculate the DSPL we derive a master equation for the time evolution of the\nprobability $P_t(L=\\ell)$, $\\ell=1,2,\\dots$, where $L$ is the distance between\na pair of nodes and $t$ is the time. Finding an exact analytical solution of\nthe master equation, we obtain a closed form expression for $P_t(L=\\ell)$. The\nmean distance, $\\langle L \\rangle_t$, and the diameter, $\\Delta_t$, are found\nto scale like $\\ln t$, namely the ND network is a small world network. The\nvariance of the DSPL is also found to scale like $\\ln t$. Interestingly, the\nmean distance and the diameter exhibit properties of a small world network,\nrather than the ultrasmall world network behavior observed in other scale-free\nnetworks, in which $\\langle L \\rangle_t \\sim \\ln \\ln t$.\n", "  Surprisingly, the issue of events localization in spacetime is poorly\nunderstood and a fortiori realized even in the context of Einstein's\nrelativity. Accordingly, a comparison between observational data and\ntheoretical expectations might then be strongly compromised. In the present\npaper, we give the principles of relativistic localizing systems so as to\nbypass this issue. Such systems will allow to locate users endowed with\nreceivers and, in addition, to localize any spacetime event. These localizing\nsystems are made up of relativistic auto-locating positioning sub-systems\nsupplemented by an extra satellite. They indicate that spacetime must be\nsupplied everywhere with an unexpected local four dimensional projective\nstructure besides the well-known three dimensional relativistic projective one.\nAs a result, the spacetime manifold can be seen as a generalized Cartan space\nmodeled on a four dimensional real projective space, i.e., a spacetime with\nboth a local four dimensional projective structure and a compatible\n(pseudo-)Riemannian structure. Localization protocols are presented in details,\nwhile possible applications to astrophysics are also considered.\n", "  Machine learning (ML) has been widely applied to image classification. Here,\nwe extend this application to data generated by a camera comprised of only a\nstandard CMOS image sensor with no lens. We first created a database of\nlensless images of handwritten digits. Then, we trained a ML algorithm on this\ndataset. Finally, we demonstrated that the trained ML algorithm is able to\nclassify the digits with accuracy as high as 99% for 2 digits. Our approach\nclearly demonstrates the potential for non-human cameras in machine-based\ndecision-making scenarios.\n", "  We consider the Riemann problem of the dilute approximation equations with\nspatiotemporally dependent volume fractions from the full model of suspension,\nin which the particles settle to the solid substrate and the clear liquid film\nflows over the sediment [Murisic et al., J. Fluid. Mech. {\\bf{717}}, 203--231\n(2013)]. We present a method to find shock waves, rarefaction waves for the\nRiemann problem of this system. Our method is mainly based on [Smoller,\nSpringer-Verlag, New York, second edition, (1994)].\n", "  We study the oxygen abundance profiles of the gas-phase components in\nhydrodynamical simulations of pre-prepared disc galaxies including major\nmergers, close encounters and isolated configurations. We analyse the evolution\nof the slope of oxygen abundance profiles and the specific star formation rate\n(sSFR) along their evolution. We find that galaxy-galaxy interactions could\ngenerate either positive and negative gas-phase oxygen profiles depending on\nthe state of evolution. Along the interaction, galaxies are found to have\nmetallicity gradients and sSFR consistent with observations, on average. Strong\ngas inflows produced during galaxy-galaxy interactions or as a result of strong\nlocal instabilities in gas-rich discs are able to produce both a quick dilution\nof the central gas-phase metallicity and a sudden increase of the sSFR. Our\nsimulations show that, during these events, a correlation between the\nmetallicity gradients and the sSFR can be set up if strong gas inflows are\ntriggered in the central regions in short timescales. Simulated galaxies\nwithout experiencing strong disturbances evolve smoothly without modifying the\nmetallicity gradients. Gas-rich systems show large dispersion along the\ncorrelation. The dispersion in the observed relation could be interpreted as\nproduced by the combination of galaxies with different gas-richness and/or\nexperiencing different types of interactions. Hence, our findings suggest that\nthe observed relation might be the smoking gun of galaxies forming in a\nhierarchical clustering scenario.\n", "  Measurements of mixing and $CP$ violation in $b$-hadron decays are great\nprobes to search for physics beyond the Standard Model. A selection of recent\nresults based upon $3.0\\ \\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of LHCb data are presented. These\nare the first measurement of the $CP$ violating phase $\\phi_{s}$ using\n$B_{s}^{0}\\to J/\\psi K^{+}K^{-}$ in the mass region above the $\\phi(1020)$\nresonance and $B_{s}^{0}\\to \\psi(2S) \\phi$ decays, the determination of\n$B_{s}^{0}$ lifetime using $B_{s}^{0}\\to D^{(*)-}\\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu}$ decays, the\nupdated measurements of the CKM angle $\\gamma$ with $B^{\\pm}\\to D K^{*\\pm}$ and\n$B_{s}^{0} \\to D_{s}^{\\mp}K^{\\pm}$ decay modes and the CP violation searches in\n$\\varLambda^{0}_{b}\\to p\\pi^{-}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ and $\\varLambda^{0}_{b}\\to\npK^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decays.\n", "  A long range corrected range separated hybrid functional is developed based\non the density matrix expansion (DME) based semilocal exchange hole with\nLee-Yang-Parr (LYP) correlation. An extensive study involving the proposed\nrange separated hybrid for thermodynamic as well as properties related to the\nfractional occupation number is compared with different BECKE88 family\nsemilocal, hybrid and range separated hybrids. It has been observed that using\nKohn-Sham kinetic energy dependent exchange hole several properties related to\nthe fractional occupation number can be improved without hindering the\nthermochemical accuracy. The newly constructed range separated hybrid\naccurately describe the hydrogen and non-hydrogen reaction barrier heights. The\npresent range separated functional has been constructed using full semilocal\nmeta-GGA type exchange hole having exact properties related to exchange hole\ntherefore, it has a strong physical basis.\n", "  In the present work we have modeled the supernova remnant (SNR) G296.5+10, by\nmeans of 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. This remnant belongs to the\nbilateral SNR group and has an additional striking feature: the rotation\nmeasure (RM) in its eastern and western parts are very different. In order to\nexplain both the morphology observed in radio-continuum and the RM, we consider\nthat the remnant expands into a medium shaped by the superposition of the\nmagnetic field of the progenitor star with a constant Galactic magnetic field.\nWe have also carried out a polarization study from our MHD results, obtaining\nsynthetic maps of the linearly polarized intensity and the Stokes parameters.\nThis study reveals that both the radio morphology and the reported RM for\nG$296.5+10$ can be explained if the quasi-parallel acceleration mechanism is\ntaking place in the shock front of this remnant.\n", "  In the present note we analyze the one-dimensional multi-particle diffusion\nlimited aggregation (MDLA) model: the initial number of particles at each\npositive integer site has Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$, independently\nof all other sites. Particles perform independent continuous-time simple\nsymmetric random walks until they come to the site neighbouring the sticky\naggregate, which initially consists only of the origin. If a particle tries to\njump on the aggregate, the size of the aggregate increases by one, i.e., its\nrightmost point moves to the right by one unit. All particles which are present\nat the site neighbouring the aggregate at the moment when the aggregate\nadvances, are immediately deleted. The $d-$dimensional MDLA model, $d \\geq 1$,\nwas introduced in 1980 by Rosenstock and Marquardt, and studied numerically by\nVoss (1984). The one dimensional model exhibits a phase transition for the rate\nof growth of the aggregate: it was proven by Kesten and Sidoravicius (2008)\nthat if $\\mu<1$ then the size $R(t)$ of the aggregate grows like $\\sqrt{t}$ and\nSly (2016+) proved that if $\\mu>1$ then $R(t)$ grows linearly. In this note we\ngive heuristic predictions about the constant $c(\\mu)$ for which $R(t)\\approx\nc(\\mu)\\sqrt{t}$ in the subcritical case $\\mu<1$, $R(t)\\approx\nc(1+\\varepsilon)t$ in the barely supercritical case $\\mu=1+\\varepsilon$ and\n$R(t) \\approx c(1) t^{2/3}$ in the critical case $\\mu=1$. We compare our\npredictions with new computer simulation results of the 1-dimensional\nmulti-particle DLA model.\n", "  Deep photometric surveys of the Milky Way have revealed diffuse structures\nencircling our Galaxy far beyond the \"classical\" limits of the stellar disk.\nThis paper reviews results from our own and other observational programs, which\ntogether suggest that, despite their extreme positions, the stars in these\nstructures were formed in our Galactic disk. Mounting evidence from recent\nobservations and simulations implies kinematic connections between several of\nthese distinct structures. This suggests the existence of collective disk\noscillations that can plausibly be traced all the way to asymmetries seen in\nthe stellar velocity distribution around the Sun. There are multiple\ninteresting implications of these findings: they promise new perspectives on\nthe process of disk heating, they provide direct evidence for a stellar halo\nformation mechanism in addition to the accretion and disruption of satellite\ngalaxies, and, they motivate searches of current and near-future surveys to\ntrace these oscillations across the Galaxy. Such maps could be used as\ndynamical diagnostics in the emerging field of \"Galactoseismology\", which\npromises to model the history of interactions between the Milky Way and its\nentourage of satellites, as well examine the density of our dark matter halo.\nAs sensitivity to very low surface brightness features around external galaxies\nincreases, many more examples of such disk oscillations will likely be\nidentified. Statistical samples of such features not only encode detailed\ninformation about interaction rates and mergers, but also about long\nsought-after dark matter halo densities and shapes. Models for the Milky Way's\nown Galactoseismic history will therefore serve as a critical foundation for\nstudying the weak dynamical interactions of galaxies across the universe.\n", "  The Monte Carlo (MC) setups used by ATLAS to model boson$+\\mathrm{jets}$ and\nmulti-boson processes at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in proton-proton collisions are\ndescribed. Comparisons between data and several event generators are provided\nfor key kinematic distributions. Issues associated with the evaluation of\nsystematic uncertainties are also discussed. This proceeding is a summary of\nthe results collected in two recent ATLAS PUB notes published for the MC\nworkshop jointly-organised by the the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations and held at\nCERN in May 2017.\n", "  Significative enhance in magnetocaloric effect due to finite size and surface\neffects is reported in Terbium(Tb) thin films in the helimagnetic phase\n(corresponding to a temperature range from $T_C$=219 K to $T_N$=231 K), for\nexternal fields of the order of kOe. For a Tb thin film of 6 monolayers\nsubmitted to an applied field ($\\Delta$H= 30 kOe, $\\Delta$H= 50 kOe and\n$\\Delta$H= 70 kOe) we report a significative change in adiabatic temperature,\n$\\Delta$T/$\\Delta$H, near the N\\'eel temperature, of the order ten times higher\nthan that observed for Tb bulk. On the other hand, for small values of the\nmagnetic field, large thickness effects are found. For external field strength\naround few kOe, we have found that the thermal caloric efficiency increases\nremarkably for ultrathin films. For an ultrathin film with 6 monolayers, we\nhave found $\\Delta$T/$\\Delta$H=43 K/T while for thicker films, with 20\nmonolayers, $\\Delta$T/$\\Delta$H=22 K/T. Our results suggest that thin films of\nTb are a promising material for magnetocaloric effect devices for applications\nat intermediate temperatures.\n", "  A new analytical approach for bubble deformation was used for optimization of\nthe electron acceleration in the 3D highly nonlinear laser wake-field regime.\nInjection of the electron bunch with initial velocity in the bubble was\nconsidered in the inhomogeneous plasma with linearly density ramp. The\nresearchers show that deformation of the bubble shape has an efficient role on\nthe trapping of the electrons in the acceleration region. The influence of the\nlinearly density ramp on the electron bunch trapping ratio and its mean energy\nwas considered by the numerical method.\n", "  In this paper, structural and electronic properties and stability of (10, 0)\nborn nitride nanotube (BNNT) are considered within density functional theory by\ndoping group IV elements of the periodic table. The HOMO-LUMO gap has been\nstrongly modified and treated a dual manner by choosing B or N sites for dopant\natoms. Formation energy calculation shows that B site doping is more stable\nthan N site doping. Results also show that all dopants turn the pristine BNNT\ninto a p-type semiconductor except for carbon-doped BNNT at B site.\n", "  The interaction between graphene and substrates provides a viable routes to\nenhance functionality of both materials. Depending on the nature of electronic\ninteraction at the interface, the electron band structure of graphene is\nstrongly influenced, allowing us to make use the intrinsic properties of\ngraphene or to design additional functionality in graphene. Here, we present an\nangle-resolved photoemission study on the interaction between graphene and a\nplatinum substrate. The formation of an interface between graphene and platinum\nleads to a strong deviation in the electronic structure of graphene not only\nfrom its freestanding form but also from the behavior observed on typical\nmetals. The combined study on the experimental and theoretical electron band\nstructure unveils the unique electronic properties of graphene on a platinum\nsubstrate, which singles out graphene/platinum as a model system investigating\ngraphene on a metallic substrate with strong interaction.\n", "  The rational design of transition metal dichalcogenide electrocatalysts for\nefficiently catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is believed to lead to\nthe generation of a renewable energy carrier. To this end our work has made\nthree main contributions. At first, we have demonstrated that exfoliation via\nionic liquid assisted grinding combined with gradient centrifugation is an\nefficient method to exfoliate bulk WS2 to nanosheets with a thickness of a few\natomic layers and lateral size dimensions in the range of 100 nm to 2 nm. These\nWS2 nanosheets decorated with scattered nanodots exhibited highly enhanced\ncatalytic performance for HER with an onset potential of -130 mV vs. RHE, an\noverpotential of 337 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec-1 in 0.5 M\nH2SO4. Secondly, we found a strong aging effect on the electrocatalytic\nperformance of WS2 stored in high boiling point organic solvents such as\ndimethylformamide (DMF). Importantly, the HER ability could be recovered by\nremoving the organic (DMF) residues, which obstructed the electron transport,\nwith acetone. Thirdly, we established that the HER performance of WS2\nnanosheets/nanodots could be significantly enhanced, by activating the\nelectrode surface at a positive voltage for a very short time (60 s),\ndecreasing the kinetic overpotential by more than 80 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The\nperformance enhancement was found to arise primarily from the ability of a\nformed proton-intercalated amorphous tungsten trioxide (a-WO3) to provide\nadditional active sites and favourably modify the immediate chemical\nenvironment of the WS2 catalyst, rendering it more favorable for local proton\ndelivery and/or transport to the active edge site of WS2. Our results provide\nnew insights into the effects of organic solvents and electrochemical\nactivation on the catalytic performance of two-dimensional WS2 for HER.\n", "  The interaction of a drum's head with its enclosed air is presented in the\nsimplest possible form appropriate to the questions and issues that arise in\nunderstanding the timbre of the banjo. The inherent air-head impedance mismatch\nallows treating the head as driver of the air and the air's effect, in turn, as\nback reaction. Any particular question can then be addressed with a calculation\nin simple wave mechanics. The analysis confirms and quantifies the notion that\ninternal air resonances enhance the response of the head at its and their\nfrequencies. However, the details of just how are fairly complicated.\n", "  Birational toggling on Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns appeared first in the study\nof geometric crystals and geometric Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.\nBased on these birational toggle relations, Einstein and Propp introduced a\ndiscrete dynamical system called birational rowmotion associated with a\npartially ordered set. We generalize birational rowmotion to the class of\narbitrary strongly connected directed graphs, calling the resulting discrete\ndynamical system the $R$-system. We study its integrability from the points of\nview of singularity confinement and algebraic entropy. We show that in many\ncases, singularity confinement in an $R$-system reduces to the Laurent\nphenomenon either in a cluster algebra, or in a Laurent phenomenon algebra, or\nbeyond both of those generalities, giving rise to many new sequences with the\nLaurent property possessing rich groups of symmetries. Some special cases of\n$R$-systems reduce to Somos and Gale-Robinson sequences.\n", "  A composite representation of the turbulent boundary-layer velocity profile\nis proposed, which combines a recently determined accurate interpolation of the\nuniversal law of the wall with a simple analytical expression of the smooth\ntransition of velocity to a constant value in the outer stream. Several\nexamples are given of application of this representation to DNS and\nexperimental data from the literature, and a conjecture is offered for the\nasymptotic approach of the velocity to its constant inviscid value.\n", "  In LHC Run 3, ALICE will increase the data taking rate significantly to\n50\\,kHz continuous read out of minimum bias Pb-Pb events. This challenges the\nonline and offline computing infrastructure, requiring to process 50 times as\nmany events per second as in Run 2, and increasing the data compression ratio\nfrom 5 to 20. Such high data compression is impossible by lossless ZIP-like\nalgorithms, but it must use results from online reconstruction, which in turn\nrequires online calibration. These important online processing steps are the\nmost computing-intense ones, and will use GPUs as hardware accelerators. The\nnew online features are already under test during Run 2 in the High Level\nTrigger (HLT) online processing farm. The TPC (Time Projection Chamber)\ntracking algorithm for Run 3 is derived from the current HLT online tracking\nand is based on the Cellular Automaton and Kalman Filter. HLT has deployed\nonline calibration for the TPC drift time, which needs to be extended to space\ncharge distortions calibration. This requires online reconstruction for\nadditional detectors like TRD (Transition Radiation Detector) and TOF (Time Of\nFlight). We present prototypes of these developments, in particular a data\ncompression algorithm that achieves a compression factor of~9 on Run 2 TPC\ndata, and the efficiency of online TRD tracking. We give an outlook to the\nchallenges of TPC tracking with continuous read out.\n", "  This book presents the proceedings of the IVth Azores International Advanced\nSchool in Space Sciences entitled \"Asteroseismology and Exoplanets: Listening\nto the Stars and Searching for New Worlds\", which took place in Horta, Azores\nIslands, Portugal in July 2016. The school addressed the topics at the\nforefront of scientific research being conducted in the fields of\nasteroseismology and exoplanetary science, two fields of modern astrophysics\nthat share many synergies and resources. The book compiles the contributions\nfrom 18 invited lecturers, including a number of hands-on tutorials.\n", "  By nonperturbatively solving the nonequilibrium Anderson two-impurity model\nwith the hierarchical equations of motion approach, we report a robust\nferromagnetic (FM) phase in series-coupled double quantum dots, which can\nsuppress the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and dominate the phase diagram at\nfinite bias and detuning energy in the strongly correlated limit. The FM\nexchange interaction origins from the passive parallel spin arrangement caused\nby the Pauli exclusion principle during the electrons transport. At very low\ntemperature, the Kondo screening of the magnetic moment in the FM phase induces\nsome nonequilibrium Kondo effects in magnetic susceptibility, spectral\nfunctions and current. In the weakly correlated limit, the AFM phase is found\nstill stable, therefore, a magnetic-field-free internal control of spin states\ncan be expected through the continuous FM--AFM phase transition.\n", "  Superconductivity in some metals at low temperature is known to arise from an\nelectron-phonon coupling mechanism. Such the mechanism enables an effective\nattraction to bind two mobile electrons together, and even form a kind of\npairing system(called Cooper pair) to be physically responsible for\nsuperconductivity. But, is it possible by an analogy with the electrodynamics\nto describe the electron-phonon coupling as a resistivity-dependent attraction?\nActually so, it will help us to explore a more operational quantum model for\nthe formation of Cooper pair. In particularly, by the calculation of quantum\nstate of Cooper pair, the explored model can provide a more explicit\nexplanation for the fundamental properties of metal superconductor, and answer:\n1) How the transition temperature of metal superconductor is determined? 2)\nWhich metals can realize the superconducting transition at low temperature?\n", "  The spin and valley polarizations and plasmonics in Van der Waals\nheterostructures of strained graphene monolayer on 2D transition metal\ndichalcogenide (GrTMD) substrate are reported in this communication. The\nsubstrate induced interactions (SII) involve sub-lattice-resolved, and enhanced\nintrinsic spin-orbit couplings, the extrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling\n(RSOC), and the orbital gap related to the transfer of the electronic charge\nfrom graphene to the substrate. Furthermore, magnetic impurity atoms are\ndeposited to the graphene surface and the corresponding exchange field is\nincluded in the band dispersion. A Rashba coupling dependent pseudo Zeeman term\narising due to the interplay of SIIs was found to be responsible for the spin\ndegeneracy lifting and the spin polarization. The latter turns out to be\nelectrostatic doping and the exchange field tunable and inversely proportional\nto the square root of the carrier concentration. The strain field, on the other\nhand, brings about the valley polarization. The intra-band plasmon dispersion\nfor the finite doping and the long wavelength limit has also been obtained. The\ndispersion involves the q2/3 behavior and not the well known q1/2 behavior. The\nuniform, uniaxial strain does not bring about any change in this behavior.\nHowever, the plasmon dispersion gets steeper for the wavevector perpendicular\nto the direction of strain and is flattened for wave vectors along the\ndirection of the strain with the term responsible for the flattening\nproportional to the strain field. The stronger confinement capability of GrTMD\nPlasmon compared to that of standalone, doped graphene is an important outcome\nof the present work. One finds that whereas the intra-band absorbance of GrTMD\nis decreasing function of the frequency at a given strain field, it is an\nincreasing function of the strain field at a given frequency.\n", "  We explain the effective renormalization method of quantum field theory in\nthe Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and illustrate its mathematical applications\nby three geometric examples: (1) Topological quantum mechanics and algebraic\nindex, (2) Elliptic curve and higher genus mirror symmetry, (3) Calabi-Yau\ngeometry and integrable hierarchy. This note is an expansion of author's talk\nat ICCM 2016.\n", "  Much like ordinary matter, dark matter might consist of elementary particles,\nand weakly interacting massive particles are one of the prime suspects. During\nthe past decade, the sensitivity of experiments trying to directly detect them\nhas improved by three to four orders of magnitude, but solid evidence for their\nexistence is yet to come. We overview the recent progress in direct dark matter\ndetection experiments and discuss future directions.\n", "  These are reminiscences of my interactions with Julian Schwinger from 1968\nthrough 1981 and beyond.\n", "  We report fully differential photoelectron spectra from an {\\it ab-inito}\ncoupled channels treatment of CO$_2$. Photoionization by laser pulses centered\nat 400 nm and 800 nm wavelength are considered, with arbitrary molecular\nalignment and polarization (linear and elliptic). Calculations reveal\nsignificant excited state channel contributions that are, at certain molecular\norientations, an order of magnitude larger than the ground state channel in the\nrescattering plateau. Partial wash out of the multiphoton structure in the ATI\nspectra and of the nodal features in angle resolved spectra is observed due to\nionization to excited state channels. The qualitative nature of the spectra is\ndetermined by ionization thresholds, orbital symmetries and interchannel\ncoupling in the order of precedence.\n", "  In this work, facile, rapid and green biosynthesis and characterization of\nsilvermontmorillonite nanocomposite is reported at room temperature. Silver\nnanoparticles were prepared by water extract of Satureja hortensis as the\nreducing agent and MMT as interlamellar space for controlling the size of\nAg-NPs. MMT was suspended in the aqueous AgNO3 solution, and after the\nabsorption of silver ions, Ag+ was reduced to Ag0 using water extract of\nSatureja hortensis. Evaluations of the antibacterial properties are also\nreported. The nanocomposite was characterized by ultraviolet-visible\nspectroscopy, powder Xray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and\ntransmission electron microscopy . TEM study showed the formations of\nnanocomposite using water extract of Satureja hortensis L in the 4.88-26.70 nm\nrange and an average particles size of 15.79 nm. In addition, XRD study showed\nthat the particles have a face centered cubic structure. The nanocomposite\nshowed antibacterial properties against Gram positive and negative bacteria.\n", "  Classical novae are runaway thermonuclear burning events on the surfaces of\naccreting white dwarfs in close binary star systems, sometimes appearing as new\nnaked-eye sources in the night sky. The standard model of novae predicts that\ntheir optical luminosity derives from energy released near the hot white dwarf\nwhich is reprocessed through the ejected material. Recent studies with the\nFermi Large Area Telescope have shown that many classical novae are accompanied\nby gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray emission. This emission likely originates from\nstrong shocks, providing new insights into the properties of nova outflows and\nallowing them to be used as laboratories to study the unknown efficiency of\nparticle acceleration in shocks. Here we report gamma-ray and optical\nobservations of the Milky Way nova ASASSN-16ma, which is among the brightest\nnovae ever detected in gamma-rays. The gamma-ray and optical light curves show\na remarkable correlation, implying that the majority of the optical light comes\nfrom reprocessed emission from shocks rather than the white dwarf. The ratio of\ngamma-ray to optical flux in ASASSN-16ma directly constrains the acceleration\nefficiency of non-thermal particles to be ~0.005, favouring hadronic models for\nthe gamma-ray emission. The need to accelerate particles up to energies\nexceeding 100 gigaelectronvolts provides compelling evidence for magnetic field\namplification in the shocks.\n", "  BSM landscape of motivated and unmotivated theories is overviewed with an\nemphasis on new developments guided by naturalness principle.\n", "  The control of the ultracold collisions between neutral atoms is an extensive\nand successful field of study. The tools developed allow for ultracold chemical\nreactions to be managed using magnetic fields, light fields and spin-state\nmanipulation of the colliding particles among other methods. The control of\nchemical reactions in ultracold atom-ion collisions is a young and growing\nfield of research. Recently, the collision energy and the ion electronic state\nwere used to control atom-ion interactions. Here, we demonstrate\nspin-controlled atom-ion inelastic processes. In our experiment, both\nspin-exchange and charge-exchange reactions are controlled in an ultracold\nRb-Sr$^+$ mixture by the atomic spin state. We prepare a cloud of atoms in a\nsingle hyperfine spin-state. Spin-exchange collisions between atoms and ion\nsubsequently polarize the ion spin. Electron transfer is only allowed for\n(RbSr)$^+$ colliding in the singlet manifold. Initializing the atoms in various\nspin states affects the overlap of the collision wavefunction with the singlet\nmolecular manifold and therefore also the reaction rate. We experimentally show\nthat by preparing the atoms in different spin states one can vary the\ncharge-exchange rate in agreement with theoretical predictions.\n", "  Animal cells in tissues are supported by biopolymer matrices, which typically\nexhibit highly nonlinear mechanical properties. While the linear elasticity of\nthe matrix can significantly impact cell mechanics and functionality, it\nremains largely unknown how cells, in turn, affect the nonlinear mechanics of\ntheir surrounding matrix. Here we show that living contractile cells are able\nto generate a massive stiffness gradient in three distinct 3D extracellular\nmatrix model systems: collagen, fibrin, and Matrigel. We decipher this\nremarkable behavior by introducing Nonlinear Stress Inference Microscopy\n(NSIM), a novel technique to infer stress fields in a 3D matrix from nonlinear\nmicrorheology measurement with optical tweezers. Using NSIM and simulations, we\nreveal a long-ranged propagation of cell-generated stresses resulting from\nlocal filament buckling. This slow decay of stress gives rise to the large\nspatial extent of the observed cell-induced matrix stiffness gradient, which\ncould form a mechanism for mechanical communication between cells.\n", "  Biological tissue has a complex structure and exhibits rich spectroscopic\nbehavior. There is \\emph{no} tissue model up to now able to account for the\nobserved spectroscopy of tissue light scattering and its anisotropy. Here we\npresent, \\emph{for the first time}, a plum pudding random medium (PPRM) model\nfor biological tissue which succinctly describes tissue as a superposition of\ndistinctive scattering structures (plum) embedded inside a fractal continuous\nmedium of background refractive index fluctuation (pudding). PPRM faithfully\nreproduces the wavelength dependence of tissue light scattering and attributes\nthe \"anomalous\" trend in the anisotropy to the plum and the powerlaw dependence\nof the reduced scattering coefficient to the fractal scattering pudding. Most\nimportantly, PPRM opens up a novel venue of quantifying the tissue architecture\nand microscopic structures on average from macroscopic probing of the bulk with\nscattered light alone without tissue excision. We demonstrate this potential by\nvisualizing the fine microscopic structural alterations in breast tissue\n(adipose, glandular, fibrocystic, fibroadenoma, and ductal carcinoma) deduced\nfrom noncontact spectroscopic measurement.\n", "  In this study, an implicit scheme for the gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) on the\nunstructured hybrid mesh is proposed. The Spalart-Allmaras (SA) one equation\nturbulence model is incorporated into the implicit gas-kinetic scheme (IGKS) to\npredict the effects of turbulence. The implicit macroscopic governing equations\nare constructed and solved by the matrix-free lower-upper\nsymmetric-Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) method. To reduce the number of cells and\ncomputational cost, the hybrid mesh is applied. A modified non-manifold hybrid\nmesh data(NHMD) is used for both unstructured hybrid mesh and uniform grid.\nNumerical investigations are performed on different 2D laminar and turbulent\nflows. The convergence property and the computational efficiency of the present\nIGKS method are investigated. Much better performance are obtained compared\nwith the standard explicit gas-kinetic scheme. Also, our numerical results are\nfound to be in good agreement with experiment data and other numerical\nsolutions, demonstrating the good applicability and high efficiency of the\npresent IGKS for the simulations of laminar and turbulent flows.\n", "  We report resistivity, specific heat and optical spectroscopy measurements on\nsingle crystal samples of La$_3$Co$_4$Sn$_{13}$ and Ce$_3$Co$_4$Sn$_{13}$. We\nobserved clear temperature-induced spectral weight suppression below 4000 \\cm\nfor both compounds in conductivity spectra $\\sigma_1(\\omega)$, indicating the\nprogressive formation of gap-like features with decreasing temperature. The\nsuppressed spectral weight transfers mostly to the higher energy region. The\nobservation reflects the presence of correlation effect in the compounds. We\nattribute the correlation effect to the Co 3d electrons.\n", "  A simple and efficient algorithm to numerically compute the genus of surfaces\nof three-dimensional objects using the Euler characteristic formula is\npresented. The algorithm applies to objects obtained by thresholding a scalar\nfield in a structured-collocated grid, and does not require any triangulation\nof the data. This makes the algorithm fast, memory-efficient and suitable for\nlarge datasets. Applications to the characterization of complex surfaces in\nturbulent flows are presented to illustrate the method.\n", "  The invariants of the velocity gradient tensor, $R$ and $Q$, and their\nenstrophy and strain components are studied in the logarithmic layer of an\nincompressible turbulent channel flow. The velocities are filtered in the three\nspatial directions and the results analyzed at different scales. We show that\nthe $R$--$Q$ plane does not capture the changes undergone by the flow as the\nfilter width increases, and that the enstrophy/enstrophy-production and\nstrain/strain-production planes represent better choices. We also show that the\nconditional mean trajectories may differ significantly from the instantaneous\nbehavior of the flow since they are the result of an averaging process where\nthe mean is 3-5 times smaller than the corresponding standard deviation. The\norbital periods in the $R$--$Q$ plane are shown to be independent of the\nintensity of the events, and of the same order of magnitude than those in the\nenstrophy/enstrophy-production and strain/strain-production planes. Our final\ngoal is to test whether the dynamics of the flow are self-similar in the\ninertial range, and the answer turns out to be no. The mean shear is found to\nbe responsible for the absence of self-similarity and progressively controls\nthe dynamics of the eddies observed as the filter width increases. However, a\nself-similar behavior emerges when the calculations are repeated for the\nfluctuating velocity gradient tensor. Finally, the turbulent cascade in terms\nof vortex stretching is considered by computing the alignment of the vorticity\nat a given scale with the strain at a different one. These results generally\nsupport a non-negligible role of the phenomenological energy-cascade model\nformulated in terms of vortex stretching.\n", "  An Extended Phase Graph framework for modelling systems with exchange or\nmagnetization transfer (MT) is proposed. The framework, referred to as EPG-X,\nmodels coupled two-compartment systems by describing each compartment with\nseparate phase graphs that exchange during evolution periods. There are two\nvariants: EPG-X(BM) for systems governed by the Bloch-McConnell equations; and\nEPG-X(MT) for the pulsed MT formalism. For the MT case the \"bound\" protons have\nno transverse components so their phase graph consists only longitudinal\nstates. EPG-X was used to model steady-state gradient echo imaging, MT effects\nin multislice Turbo Spin Echo imaging, multiecho CPMG for multicomponent T2\nrelaxometry and transient variable flip angle gradient echo imaging of the type\nused for MR Fingerprinting. Experimental data were also collected for the final\ncase. Steady-state predictions from EPG-X closely match directly derived\nsteady-state solutions which differ substantially from classic \"single pool\"\nEPG predictions. EPG-X(MT) predicts similar MT related levels of signal\nattenuation in white matter as have been reported elsewhere in the literature.\nModelling of CPMG echo trains with EPG-X(BM) suggests that exchange processes\ncan lead to an underestimate of the fraction of short T2 species. Modelling of\ntransient gradient echo sequences with EPG-X(MT) suggests that measurable MT\neffects result from variable saturation of bound protons, particularly after\ninversion pulses. In conclusion, EPG-X can be used for modelling of the\ntransient signal response of systems exhibiting chemical exchange or MT. This\nmay be particularly beneficial for relaxometry approaches that rely on\ncharacterising transient rather than steady-state sequences.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the stability and linear oscillatory behavior of\na naturally unstable particle whose potential energy is harmonically modulated.\nWe find this fundamental dynamical system is analogous in time to a quantum\nharmonic oscillator. In a certain modulation limit, a.k.a. the Kapitza regime,\nthe modulated oscillator can behave like an effective classic harmonic\noscillator. But in the overlooked opposite limit, the stable modes of\nvibrations are quantized in the modulation parameter space. By analogy with the\nstatistical interpretation of quantum physics, those modes can be characterized\nby the time-energy uncertainty relation of a quantum harmonic oscillator.\nReducing the almost-periodic vibrational modes of the particle to their\nperiodic eigenfunctions, one can transform the original equation of motion to a\ndimensionless Schr\\\"odinger stationary wave equation with a harmonic potential.\nThis reduction process introduces two features reminiscent of the quantum\nrealm: a wave-particle duality and a loss of causality that could legitimate a\nstatistical interpretation of the computed eigenfunctions. These results shed\nnew light on periodically time-varying linear dynamical systems and open an\noriginal path in the recently revived field of quantum mechanical analogs.\n", "  The production of single top quarks allows to study the interplay of top\nquark physics and the electroweak sector of the standard model. Deviations from\npredictions can be a hint for physics beyond the standard model. The t-channel\nis the dominant production mode for single top quarks at the LHC. This talk\npresents the latest measurements from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.\n", "  A novel approach to the synthesis of the electromagnetic field distribution\nin a chain of coupled resonators has been developed. This approach is based on\nthe new matrix form of the solutions of the second-order difference equations.\nIf a chain of coupled resonators can be described by the second-order\ndifference equation for amplitudes of expansion of the electromagnetic field,\ntwo linearly independent solutions can be constructed on the basis of the\nsolutions of nonlinear Riccaty equation. Setting the structure of one solution,\nfrom the Riccaty equation we can find the electrodynamical characteristics of\nresonators and coupling holes, at which the desired distribution of amplitudes\nis realized. On the base of this approach we considered the problem of\nseparation of the electromagnetic field into forward and backward components in\nthe inhomogeneous chain of resonators. It was shown that in the frame of\nconsidered model such separation is not defined uniquely.\n", "  The propagation of coherent light through a random scattering medium\ngenerates speckle pattern. Although the speckle is random in nature, the object\ninformation is scrambled into it. The scrambled object information can be\nretrieved using off-axis holographic technique where the retrieval is made from\ncoherence hologram which is constructed from the interferogram formed by object\nspeckle and a tilted reference speckle. It is shown that the SNR of the object\nretrieved from the coherence hologram, calculated from the far-field intensity\ncorrelation of the interferogram, depends on the average number of reference\nspeckles. The effect of average number of reference speckles on the SNR of the\nretrieved object in off-axis holographic technique is investigated\nexperimentally by changing the reference speckle while keeping the object\nspeckle unchanged. The experimental observations are presented in this paper.\n", "  Searches for the direct pair production of the third generation squarks are\npresented in this conference report, based on proton-proton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 35.9 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the CMS detector. New techniques have been\ndeveloped to address different kinematical regimes. In absence of statistically\nsignificant deviations from the standard model background, limits have been\nderived in terms of simplified model spectra, excluding for example a stop up\nto a mass of 1.05~TeV when it decays to a top and a massless neutralino.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos are an attractive extension of the Standard Model of\nelementary particles towards including a mechanism for generating the observed\nlight neutrino masses. We discuss that when an approximate protective \"lepton\nnumber\"-like symmetry is present, the sterile neutrinos can have masses around\nthe electroweak scale and potentially large neutrino Yukawa couplings, which\nmakes them well testable at planned future particle colliders. We\nsystematically discuss the production and decay channels for sterile neutrinos\nat electron-proton colliders and give a complete list of the leading order\nsignatures for sterile neutrino searches. We highlight several novel search\nchannels and present a first look at the possible sensitivities for the\nactive-sterile mixing parameters and the heavy neutrino masses. We also compare\nthe performance of electron-proton colliders with the ones of proton-proton and\nelectron-positron colliders, and discuss the complementarity of the different\ncollider types.\n", "  Starting from the integral representation of the three-dimensional Coulomb\ntransition matrix elaborated by us formerly with the use of specific symmetry\nof the interaction in a four-dimensional Euclidean space introduced by Fock,\nthe possibility of the analytical solving of the integral equation for the\npartial wave transition matrices at the excited bound state energy has been\nstudied. New analytical expressions for the partial s-, p- and d-wave Coulomb\nt-matrices for like-charged particles and the expression for the partial d-wave\nt-matrix for unlike-charged particles at the energy of the first excited bound\nstate have been derived.\n", "  This activity has been developed as a resource for the \"EU Space Awareness\"\neducational programme. As part of the suite \"Our Fragile Planet\" together with\nthe \"Climate Box\" it addresses aspects of weather phenomena, the Earth's\nclimate and climate change as well as Earth observation efforts like in the\nEuropean \"Copernicus\" programme. In this activity, students investigate how\nsatellite images obtained at different wavelengths help to identify Earth\nsurface features like vegetation and open water areas by using a specially\ndesigned software package, LEO Works. Students inspect and analyse real\nsatellite data to produce colour images and maps of spectral indices and learn\nhow to interpret them and their uses.\n", "  The variation in the radiative output of the Sun, described in terms of solar\nirradiance, is important to climatology. A common assumption is that solar\nirradiance variability is driven by its surface magnetism. Verifying this\nassumption has, however, been hampered by the fact that models of solar\nirradiance variability based on solar surface magnetism have to be calibrated\nto observed variability. Making use of realistic three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmosphere and state-of-the-art\nsolar magnetograms from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we present a model of\ntotal solar irradiance (TSI) that does not require any such calibration. In\ndoing so, the modeled irradiance variability is entirely independent of the\nobservational record. (The absolute level is calibrated to the TSI record from\nthe Total Irradiance Monitor.) The model replicates 95% of the observed\nvariability between April 2010 and July 2016, leaving little scope for\nalternative drivers of solar irradiance variability at least over the time\nscales examined (days to years).\n", "  The giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1316 is the brightest galaxy in the Fornax\ncluster, and displays a number of morphological features that might be\ninterpreted as an intermediate age merger remanent ($\\sim$3 Gyr). Based on the\nidea that globular clusters systems (GCS) constitute genuine tracers of the\nformation and evolution of their host galaxies, we conducted a spectroscopic\nstudy of approximately 40 globular clusters (GCs) candidates associated with\nthis interesting galaxy. We determined ages, metallicities, and\n$\\alpha$-element abundances for each GC present in the sample, through the\nmeasurement of different Lick indices and their subsequent comparison with\nsimple stellar populations models (SSPs).\n", "  A key parameter in models for the spread of infectious diseases is the basic\nreproduction number $R_0$, which is the expected number of secondary cases a\ntypical infected primary case infects during its infectious period in a large\nmostly susceptible population. In order for this quantity to be meaningful, the\ninitial expected growth of the number of infectious individuals in the\nlarge-population limit should be exponential.\n  We investigate to what extent this assumption is valid by performing repeated\nsimulations of epidemics on selected empirical networks, viewing each epidemic\nas a random process in discrete time. The initial phase of each epidemic is\nanalyzed by fitting the number of infected people at each time step to a\ngeneralised growth model, allowing for estimating the shape of the growth. For\nreference, similar investigations are done on some elementary graphs such as\ninteger lattices in different dimensions and configuration model graphs, for\nwhich the early epidemic behaviour is known.\n  We find that for the empirical networks tested in this paper, exponential\ngrowth characterizes the early stages of the epidemic, except when the network\nis restricted by a strong low-dimensional spacial constraint, such as is the\ncase for the two-dimensional square lattice. However, on finite integer\nlattices of sufficiently high dimension, the early development of epidemics\nshows exponential growth.\n", "  Muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools would serve to verify the\nsimulated muon fluxes and offer the possibility of studying cosmic muons in\ngeneral. This reconstruction is, however, complicated by many optical obstacles\nand the small coverage of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as compared to other\nlarge water Cherenkov detectors. The PMTs' timing information is useful only in\nthe case of direct, unreflected Cherenkov light. This requires PMTs to be added\nand removed as an hypothesized muon trajectory is iteratively improved, to\naccount for the changing effects of obstacles and direction of light.\nTherefore, muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools does not lend itself\nto a general fitting procedure employing smoothly varying functions with\ncontinuous derivatives. Here, an algorithm is described which overcomes these\ncomplications. It employs the method of Least Mean Squares to determine an\nhypothesized trajectory from the PMTs' charge-weighted positions. This\ninitially hypothesized trajectory is then iteratively refined using the PMTs'\ntiming information. Reconstructions with simulated data reproduce the simulated\ntrajectory to within about 5 degrees in direction and about 45 cm in position\nat the pool surface, with a bias that tends to pull tracks away from the\nvertical by about 3 degrees.\n", "  In this study we present the analysis of the dust properties of a local storm\nimaged in the Atlantis Chaos region on Mars by the OMEGA imaging spectrometer\non March 2nd 2005. We use the radiative transfer model MITRA to study the dust\nproperties at solar wavelengths between 0.5 {\\mu}m and 2.5 {\\mu}m and infer the\nconnection between the local storm dynamics and the topography. We retrieve\nmaps of effective grain radius (reff), optical depth at 9.3 {\\mu}m ({\\tau}9.3)\nand top altitude (ta) of the dust layer. Our results show that large particles\n(reff = 1.6 {\\mu}m) are gathered in the centre of the storm (lat=33.5{\\deg} S;\nlon=183.5 W{\\deg}), where the optical depth is maximum ({\\tau}9.3 > 7.0) and\nthe top altitude exceeds 18 km. Outside the storm, we obtain {\\tau}9.3 < 0.2,\nin agreement with the estimates derived from global climate models (GCM). We\nspeculate that a low thermal inertia region at the western border of Atlantis\nChaos is a possible source of the dust storm. Moreover, we find evidence that\ntopography plays a role in confining the local storm in Atlantis Chaos. The\nvertical wind component from the GCM does not provide any hint for the\ntriggering of dust lifting. On the other hand, the combination of the\nhorizontal and vertical wind profiles suggests that the dust, once lifted, is\npushed eastward and then downward and gets confined within the north-east ridge\nof Atlantis Chaos. (continues in article)\n", "  The use of x-ray imaging in medicine and other research is well known.\nGenerally, the image quality is proportional to the total flux, but high photon\nenergy could severely damage the specimen, so how to decrease the radiation\ndose while maintaining image quality is a fundamental problem. In \"ghost\"\nimaging, an image is retrieved from a known patterned illumination field and\nthe total intensity transmitted through the object collected by a bucket\ndetector. Using a table-top x-ray source we have realized ghost imaging of\nplane and natural objects with ultra-low radiation on the order of single\nphotons. Compared with conventional x-ray imaging, a higher contrast-to-noise\nratio is obtained for the same radiation dose. This new technique could greatly\nreduce radiation damage of biological specimens.\n", "  Hot-Jupiters are subject to extreme radiation and plasma flows coming from\ntheir host stars. Past ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope observations,\nsupported by hydrodynamic models, confirmed that these factors lead to the\nformation of an extended envelope, part of which lies beyond the Roche lobe. We\nuse gas-dynamic simulations to study the impact of time variations in the\nparameters of the stellar wind, namely that of coronal mass ejections (CMEs),\non the envelope of the typical hot-Jupiter HD 209458b. We consider three CMEs\ncharacterized by different velocities and densities, taking their parameters\nfrom typical CMEs observed for the Sun. The perturbations in the ram-pressure\nof the stellar wind during the passage of each CME tear off most of the\nenvelope that is located beyond the Roche lobe. This leads to a substantial\nincrease of the mass-loss rates during the interaction with the CME. We find\nthat the mass lost by the planet during the whole crossing of a CME is of\n${\\approx}10^{15}$ g, regardless of the CME taken into consideration. We also\nfind that over the course of 1 Gyr, the mass lost by the planet because of CME\nimpacts is comparable to that lost because of high-energy stellar irradiation.\n", "  Understanding geometric frustration of ordered phases in two-dimensional\ncondensed matters on curved surfaces is closely related to a host of scientific\nproblems in condensed matter physics and materials science. Here we show how\ntwo-dimensional Lennard-Jones crystal clusters confined on a sphere resolve the\ngeometric frustration and lead to pentagonal vacancy structures. These\nvacancies, originated from the combination of curvature and physical\ninteraction, are found to be topological defects and they can be further\nclassified into dislocational and disclinational types. We analyze the dual\nrole of these crystallographic defects as both vacancies and topological\ndefects, illustrate their formation mechanism, and present the phase diagram.\nThe revealed dual role of the topological vacancies may find applications in\nthe fabrication of robust nanopores. This work also suggests the promising\npotential of exploiting the richness in both physical interactions and\nsubstrate geometries to create new types of crystallographic defects, which\nhave strong connections with the design of crystalline materials.\n", "  Polymer solar cells are considered as very promising candidates for\ndevelopment of photovoltaics of the future. They are cheap and easy to\nfabricate, however, up to now, they possess fundamental drawback, low\neffectiveness. In the most popular BHJ (bulk heterojunction) architecture the\nactual record of efficiency is about 13 percent. One ask the question how\nfundamental this limitation is. In our paper we propose the simple model which\nexamines the limitations of efficiency by analysis of geometrical aspects of\nthe BHJ architecture. In this paper we considered two dimensional model. We\ncalculated the effective length of the donor-acceptor border in the random\nmixture of donor and acceptor nanocrystals and further compared it with an\nideal comb architecture. It turns out that in the BHJ architecture, this\neffective length is about 2 times smaller than in the comb architecture.\n", "  Two of the most important parameters in supersymmetry are the masses of the\nstop and sbottom, the supersymmetric partners of the third generation quarks. A\nstop mass lighter than 1 TeV is favored theoretically, however, conventional\nsearches based on the simplified models have not produced experimental evidence\nfor a light stop. It is possible that the light stop evades our searches due to\na compressed sparticle mass spectrum. Therefore, the searches are extended to\ncover a broader range of signal scenarios with different mass splittings\nbetween the stop, neutralino(s), and chargino(s). The searches are then\ninterpreted in the context of both simplified models and pMSSM models. Searches\nare also performed for various R-parity violating stop (sbottom) models. Recent\nATLAS results from searches for direct stop (sbottom) pair production are\npresented in final states with jets, missing transverse-momentum, and leptons.\nThe analyses are based on 36 fb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV proton-proton\ncollision data recorded with ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016.\n", "  In this paper, we have proved that there exists no translation invariant pure\nstate of $\\mathbb{M}=\\otimes_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\!M^{(k)}_d(\\mathbb{C})$ that is\nreal, lattice symmetric with a certain twist and $SU_2(\\mathbb{C})$ invariant\nfor any even integer $d \\ge 2$. In particular, this result also says that the\nHeisenberg iso-spin anti-ferromagnetic model with ${1 \\over 2}$-odd integer\nspin degrees of freedom does not admit a unique ground state.\n"]}
