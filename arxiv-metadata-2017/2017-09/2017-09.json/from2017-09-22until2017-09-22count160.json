A worldsheet perspective is used to clarify quantization\nconditions associated to the fluxes and the constraints these place on the\nmoduli spaces of resulting compactifications. We propose that these vacua fit\nnaturally in the context of heterotic/IIA duality as heterotic duals to\ncompactifications on K3-fibered but not elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau\nthree-folds. We present some examples of such potential dual pairs.\n", "  Lattices of topological defects, such as Abrikosov lattices and domain wall\nlattices often arise as metastable ground states in higher-dimensional field\ntheoretical models. We demonstrate that such lattice states may be described as\nextra-dimensional metamaterials via higher-dimensional effective medium theory.\nA 4+1 dimensional extension of Maxwell electrodynamics with a compactified\ntime-like dimension has been considered as an example. It is demonstrated that\nfrom the point of view of macroscopic electrodynamics an Abrikosov lattice\nstate in such a 4+1 dimensional spacetime may be described as a uniaxial\nhyperbolic metamaterial. Extraordinary photons perceive this medium as a 3+1\ndimensional Minkowski spacetime in which one of the original spatial dimensions\n(the optical axis of the metamaterial) plays the role of a new time-like\ncoordinate. Since metric signature of this effective space-time depends on the\nAbrikosov lattice periodicity, the described model may be useful in studying\nmetric signature transitions. A particular kind of metric signature transition\nunderstood as a macroscopic medium effect may emulate cosmological inflation.\n", "  The hydrodynamic equation derived by N-particle statistical mechanics is\ninvestigated. This is an attempt to provide additional information concerning\nthe closure problem of turbulence theory. The equation is interpreted as mean\nvelocity equation for turbulent fluid flow. The third-order term of the\nfriction force is calculated. Multilinear mode coupling theory is applied in\norder to obtain formulas for the third- und fourth-order equilibrium time\ncorrelation functions appearing in the expression. The force term is obtained\nas a convolution integral containing higher order gradients of the velocity\nfield.\n", "  We discuss a family of time-reversible, scale-invariant diffusions with\nsingular coefficients. In analogy with the standard Gaussian theory, a\ncorresponding family of generalized characteristic functions provides a useful\ntool for proving limit theorems resulting in non-Gaussian, scale-invariant\ndiffusions. We apply the generalized characteristic functions in combination\nwith a martingale construction to prove a simple invariance principle starting\nfrom a spatially inhomogeneous nearest-neighbor random walk.\n", "  We study two inverse problems on a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold\n$(M,g)$. The problems are:\n  1. Passive observations in spacetime: Consider observations in a neighborhood\n$V\\subset M$ of a time-like geodesic $\\mu$. Under natural causality conditions,\nwe reconstruct the conformal type of the unknown open, relatively compact set\n$W\\subset M$, when we are given $V$, the conformal class of $g|_V$, and the\nlight observations sets $P_V(q)$ corresponding to all source points $q$ in $W$.\nThe light observation set $P_V(q)$ is the intersection of $V$ and the\nlight-cone emanating from the point $q$, i.e., the points in the set $V$ where\nlight from a point source at $q$ is observed.\n  2. Active measurements in spacetime: We develop a new method for inverse\nproblems for non-linear hyperbolic equations that utilizes the non-linearity as\na tool. This enables us to solve inverse problems for non-linear equations for\nwhich the corresponding problems for linear equations are still unsolved. To\nillustrate this method, we solve an inverse problem for semilinear wave\nequations with quadratic non-linearities. We assume that we are given the\nneighborhood $V$ of the time-like geodesic $\\mu$ and the source-to-solution\noperator that maps the source supported on $V$ to the restriction of the\nsolution of the wave equation in $V$. When $M$ is 4-dimensional, we show that\nthese data determine the topological, differentiable, and conformal structures\nof the spacetime in the maximal set where waves can propagate from $\\mu$ and\nreturn back to $\\mu$.\n", "  The work describes an analogy-based small oscillations analysis of a standard\nstatic equilibrium lab problem. In addition to force analysis, a potential\nenergy function for the system is developed, and by drawing out mathematical\nsimilarities to the simple harmonic oscillator, we are able to describe (and\nverify) the period of small oscillations about the static equilibrium state.\nThe problem was developed and implemented in a standard University Physics\ncourse at Winona State University.\n", "  Reconsidering the already known important question that whether all the\naxioms and theorems in classical theory of probability are applicable to\nprobability functions in quantum theory, we want to show that the so-called\nBayes theorem isn't applicable to nonfactorizable quantum entangled states.\n", "  The nonbaryonic dark matter of the Universe is assumed to consist of new\nstable forms of matter. Their stability reflects symmetry of micro world and\nmechanisms of its symmetry breaking. In the early Universe heavy metastable\nparticles can dominate, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs) after their\ndecay, as well as the structure of particle symmetry breaking gives rise to\ncosmological phase transitions, from which massive black holes and/or their\nclusters can originate. PBHs can be formed in such transitions within a narrow\ninterval of masses about $10^{17}$g and, avoiding severe observational\nconstraints on PBHs, can be a candidate for the dominant form of dark matter.\nPBHs in this range of mass can give solution of the problem of reionization in\nthe Universe at the redshift $z\\sim 5... 10$. Clusters of massive PBHs can\nserve as a nonlinear seeds for galaxy formation, while PBHs evaporating in such\nclusters can provide an interesting interpretation for the observations of\npoint-like gamma-ray sources. Analysis of possible PBH signatures represents a\nuniversal probe for super-high energy physics in the early Universe in studies\nof indirect effects of the dark matter.\n", "  The motion of a quantum particle hopping on a simple cubic lattice under the\ninfluence of thermal noise and of a static random potential is expected to be\ndiffusive, i.e., the particle is expected to exhibit `quantum Brownian motion',\nno matter how weak the thermal noise is. This is shown to be true in a model\nwhere the dynamics of the particle is governed by a Lindblad equation for a\none-particle density matrix. The generator appearing in this equation is the\nsum of two terms: a Liouvillian corresponding to a random Schr\\\"odinger\noperator and a Lindbladian describing the effect of thermal noise in the\nkinetic limit. Under suitable but rather general assumptions on the\nLindbladian, the diffusion constant characterizing the asymptotics of the\nmotion of the particle is proven to be strictly positive and finite. If the\ndisorder in the random potential is so large that transport is completely\nsuppressed in the limit where the thermal noise is turned off, then the\ndiffusion constant tends to $0$ proportional to the coupling of the particle to\nthe heat bath.\n", "  The addition of noise has a regularizing effect on Hermitian matrices. This\neffect is studied here for $H=A+V$, where $A$ is the base matrix and $V$ is\nsampled from the GOE or the GUE random matrix ensembles. We bound the mean\nnumber of eigenvalues of $H$ in an interval, and present tail bounds for the\ndistribution of the Frobenius and operator norms of $H^{-1}$ and for the\ndistribution of the norm of $H^{-1}$ applied to a fixed vector. The bounds are\nuniform in $A$ and exceed the actual suprema by no more than multiplicative\nconstants. The probability of multiple eigenvalues in an interval is also\nestimated.\n", "  Despite modest declines in residential segregation levels since the Civil\nRights Era, segregation remains a defining feature of the U.S. landscape. This\nstudy highlights the importance of considering physical barriers--features of\nthe urban environment that disconnect locations--when measuring segregation. We\nuse population and geographic data for 20 U.S. Rustbelt cities from the 2010\ndecennial census and a novel approach for measuring and analyzing segregation\nthat incorporates the connectivity of roads and the excess distance imposed by\nphysical barriers, such as highways, railroad tracks, and dead-end streets. We\nfind that physical barriers divide urban space in ways that reinforce or\nexacerbate segregation, but there is substantial variation in the extent to\nwhich they increase segregation both within and across these cities and for\ndifferent ethnoracial groups. By uncovering a new source of variation in the\nsegregation experienced by city residents, the findings have implications for\nunderstanding the mechanisms that contribute to the persistence of segregation\nand the consequences of segregation.\n", "  Graphene-covered copper surfaces have been exposed to borazine, (BH)3(NH)3,\nwith the resulting surfaces characterized by low-energy electron microscopy.\nAlthough the intent of the experiment was to form hexagonal boron nitride\n(h-BN) on top of the graphene, such layers were not obtained. Rather, in\nisolated surface areas, h-BN is found to form micrometer-size islands that\nsubstitute for the graphene. Additionally, over nearly the entire surface, the\nproperties of the layer that was originally graphene is observed to change in a\nmanner that is consistent with the formation of a mixed h-BN/graphene alloy,\ni.e. h-BNC alloy. Furthermore, following the deposition of the borazine, a\nsmall fraction of the surface is found to consist of bare copper, indicating\netching of the overlying graphene. The inability to form h-BN layers on top of\ngraphene is discussed in terms of the catalytic behavior of the underlying\ncopper surface and the decomposition of the borazine on top of the graphene.\n", "  The mean veloctiy equation for fluctuating flow derived in an earlier paper\nof the author has been applied to circular jet flow for low Reynolds numbers.\nNumerical solutions have been obtained from an iteration starting with the\ncorresponding solution of the Navier-Stokes equation. Deviations become\ndistinct for Re > 30.\n", "  We consider stationary axially symmetric black holes with the background\nscalar field and test particles that can interact with this field directly.\nThen, particle collision near a black hole can lead to the unbounded energy $%\nE_{c.m.}$ in the centre of mass frame (contrary to some recent claims in\nliterature). This happens always if one of particles is neutral whereas another\none has nonzero scalar charge. Kinematically, two cases occur here. (i) A\nneutral particle approaches the horizon with the speed of light while the\nvelocity of the charged one remains separated from it (this is direct analogue\nof the situation with collision of geodesic particles.). (ii) Both particles\napproach the horizon with the speed almost equal to that of light but with\ndifferent rates. As a result, in both cases the relative velocity also\napproaches the speed of light, so that $E_{c.m.}$ $\\ $becomes unbounded. We\nconsider also a case when the metric coefficient $g_{\\phi \\phi }\\rightarrow 0$\nnear a black hole. Then, overlap between the geometric factor and the presence\nof the scalar field opens additional scenarios in which unbounded energy\n$E_{c.m.}$ is possible as well. We give a full list of possible scenarios of\nhigh-energy collisions for the situations considered.\n", "  The calibration of a quantum channel, i.e. the determination of the\ntransmission losses affecting it, is definitely one of the principal objectives\nin both the quantum communication and quantum metrology frameworks. Another\ntask of the utmost relevance is the identification, e.g. by extracting its\nphoton number distribution, of the noise potentially present in the channel.\nHere we present a protocol, based on the response of a photon-number-resolving\ndetector at different quantum efficiencies, able to accomplish both of these\ntasks at once, providing with a single measurement an estimate of the\ntransmission losses as well as the photon statistics of the noise present in\nthe exploited quantum channel. We show and discuss the experimental results\nobtained in the practical implementation of such protocol, with different kinds\nand levels of noise.\n", "  Bearing in mind physical and social aspects, health issues connected with\noperation of nuclear facilities are under continuous control of national and\ninternational regulatory institutions. The main purpose of doing so is to\nreduce risk of ionizing radiation on human health. Under standard operation of\nany controlled nuclear facility, direct injuries connected by nonstochastic\neffects of ionizing radiation, such as Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) are\ntheoretically possible only if health and safety measures are violated. On the\nother hand, the stochastic effect of radiation may cause tumors with increasing\nprobability of received radioactive dose. Nuclear facilities such as nuclear\npower plants use certain formulas to calculate the cost of potential health\ndamage caused by ionizing radiation. These formulas are derived according to\nLinear No-Threshold Relationship between the dose and cancer risk. However,\nthis Linear No-Threshold relationship (LNT) is becoming debatable with new\nradiological research. Therefore, a new methodology of cost estimation of\nhealth risks induced by ionizing radiation is introduced in this paper.\n", "  We investigate the structural, electronic and optical properties of mixed\nbromide-iodide lead perovskite solar cell CH$_3$NH$_3$Pb(I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_3$\nby means of the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) within density functional\ntheory (DFT). Optimizing the atomic positions and lattice parameters increasing\nthe bromide content $x$ from 0.0 to 1.0, we fit the calculated lattice\nparameter and energy band gap to the linear and quadratic function of Br\ncontent, respectively, which are in good agreement with the experiment,\nrespecting the Vegard's law. With the calculated exciton binding energy and\nlight absorption coefficient, we make sure that VCA gives consistent results\nwith the experiment, and the mixed halide perovskites are suitable for\ngenerating the charge carriers by light absorption and conducting the carriers\neasily due to their strong photon absorption coefficient, low exciton bindign\nenergy, and high carrier mobility at low Br contents. Furthermore analyzing the\nbonding lengths between Pb and X (I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$: virtual atom) as well as C\nand N, we stress that the stability of perovskite solar cell is definitely\nimproved at $x$=0.2.\n", "  For the purpose of elucidating the gas sensing mechanism of SnO$_2$ for NO\nand NO$_2$ gases, we calculate the phase diagram of SnO$_2$(110) surface in\ncontact with an O$_2$ and NO gas environment by means of {\\it ab initio}\nthermodynamic method. Firstly we build a range of surface slab models of oxygen\npre-adsorbed SnO$_2$(110) surfaces using (1$\\times$1) and (2$\\times$1) surface\nunit cells and calculate their Gibbs free energies considering only oxygen\nchemical potential. The fully reduced surface containing the bridging and\nin-plane oxygen vacancies in the oxygen-poor condition, while the fully\noxidized surface containing the bridging oxygen and oxygen dimer in the\noxygen-rich condition, and the stoichiometric surface in between, were proved\nto be most stable. Using the selected plausible NO-adsorbed surfaces, we then\ndetermine the surface phase diagram of SnO$_2$(110) surfaces in\n($\\Delta\\mu_\\text{O}$, $\\Delta\\mu_\\text{NO}$) space. In the NO-rich condition,\nthe most stable surfaces were those formed by NO adsorption on the most stable\nsurfaces in contact with only oxygen gas. Through the analysis of electronic\ncharge transferring and density of states during NO$_x$ adsorption on the\nsurface, we provide a meaningful understanding about the gas sensing mechanism.\n", "  A standard model is suggested to explore correlation features of two\nspatially separated optomechanical cavities. The cavities are coupled through\nthe photon-hopping process. In particular, we investigate the generation of\nentanglement between mechanical resonators in the strong coupling regime and\nthe two cavities are assumed to be driven by a coherent laser field. In order\nto quantify entanglement we use the logarithmic negativity. The analytical\nsolutions are presented for the system in a parameter regime very close to the\ncurrent experimental results. We show that in the presence of the photon\nhopping process between the cavities, the two mechanical resonators and the\nfield modes can be entangled. This shows clearly that the entanglement can be\ntransfer via radiation pressure of a photon hopping coupling from the\nintracavity photon-phonon entanglements to an inter-cavity photon-photon or\nphonon-phonon entanglement.\n", "  We report an experimental proof of principle for ghost imaging in the hard\nx-ray energy range. We used a synchrotron x-ray beam that was split using a\nthin crystal in Laue diffraction geometry. With an ultra-fast imaging camera,\nwe were able to image x-rays generated by isolated electron bunches. At this\ntime scale, the shot noise of the synchrotron emission process is measurable as\nspeckles, leading to speckle correlation between the two beams. The integrated\ntransmitted intensity from a sample located in the first beam was correlated\nwith the spatially resolved intensity measured on the second, empty, beam to\nretrieve the shadow of the sample. The demonstration of ghost imaging with hard\nx-rays may open the way to protocols to reduce radiation damage in medical\nimaging and in non-destructive structural characterization using Free Electron\nLasers.\n", "  Bottom-up synthesized GNRs and GNR heterostructures have promising electronic\nproperties for high performance field effect transistors (FETs) and ultra-low\npower devices such as tunnelling FETs. However, the short length and wide band\ngap of these GNRs have prevented the fabrication of devices with the desired\nperformance and switching behaviour. Here, by fabricating short channel (Lch\n~20 nm) devices with a thin, high-k gate dielectric and a 9-atom wide (0.95 nm)\narmchair GNR as the channel material, we demonstrate FETs with high on-current\n(Ion >1 uA at Vd = -1 V) and high Ion/Ioff ~10^5 at room temperature. We find\nthat the performance of these devices is limited by tunnelling through the\nSchottky barrier (SB) at the contacts and we observe an increase in the\ntransparency of the barrier by increasing the gate field near the contacts. Our\nresults thus demonstrate successful fabrication of high performance\nshort-channel FETs with bottom-up synthesized armchair GNRs.\n", "  In this work, low-energy electron microscopy is employed to probe structural\nas well as electronic information in few-layer WSe$_2$ on epitaxial graphene on\nSiC. The emergence of unoccupied states in the WSe$_2$--graphene\nheterostructures are studied using spectroscopic low-energy electron\nreflectivity. Reflectivity minima corresponding to specific WSe$_2$ states that\nare localized between the monolayers of each vertical heterostructure are shown\nto reveal the number of layers for each point on the surface. A theory for the\norigin of these states is developed and utilized to explain the experimentally\nobserved featured in the WSe$_2$ electron reflectivity.\n", "  A study of differential cross sections and azimuthal observables for\nsemi-hard processes at LHC energies, including BFKL resummation effects, is\npresented. Particular attention has been paid to the behaviour of the azimuthal\ncorrelation momenta, when a couple of forward/backward jets or identified\nhadrons is produced in the final state with a large rapidity separation. Three-\nand four- jet production has been also considered, the main focus lying on the\ndefinition of new, generalized azimuthal observables, whose dependence on the\ntransverse momenta and the rapidities of the central jet(s) can be considered\nas a distinct signal of the onset of BFKL dynamics.\n", "  Chiral $p$-wave superconductors in applied magnetic field can exhibit more\ncomplex topological defects than just conventional superconducting vortices,\ndue to the two-component order parameter (OP) and the broken time-reversal\nsymmetry. We investigate the electronic properties of those exotic states, some\nof which contain clusters of one-component vortices in chiral components of the\nOP and/or exhibit skyrmionic character in the \\textit{relative} OP space, all\nobtained as a self-consistent solution of the microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nequations. We reveal the link between the local density of states (LDOS) of the\nnovel topological states and the behavior of the chiral domain wall between the\nOP components, enabling direct identification of those states in scanning\ntunneling microscopy. For example, a skyrmion always contains a closed chiral\ndomain wall, which is found to be mapped exactly by zero-bias peaks in LDOS.\nMoreover, the LDOS exhibits electron-hole asymmetry, which is different from\nthe LDOS of conventional vortex states with the same vorticity. Finally, we\npresent the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the properties of a\nskyrmion, indicating that this topological defect can be surprisingly large in\nsize, and can be pinned by an artificially indented non-superconducting closed\npath in the sample. These features are expected to facilitate the experimental\nobservation of skyrmionic states, thereby enabling experimental verification of\nchirality in emerging superconducting materials.\n", "  We consider the most general asymptotically anti-de Sitter boundary\nconditions in three-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative cosmological\nconstant. The metric contains in total twelve independent functions, six of\nwhich are interpreted as chemical potentials (or non-normalizable fluctuations)\nand the other half as canonical boundary charges (or normalizable\nfluctuations). Their presence modifies the usual Fefferman-Graham expansion.\nThe asymptotic symmetry algebra consists of two sl(2)_k current algebras, the\nlevels of which are given by k=l/(4G_N), where l is the AdS radius and G_N the\nthree-dimensional Newton constant.\n", "  We consider the absorption by bound electrons of dark matter in the form of\ndark photons and axion-like particles, as well as of dark photons from the Sun,\nin current and next-generation direct detection experiments. Experiments\nsensitive to electron recoils can detect such particles with masses between a\nfew eV to more than 10 keV. For dark photon dark matter, we update a previous\nbound based on XENON10 data and derive new bounds based on data from XENON100\nand CDMSlite. We find these experiments to disfavor previously allowed\nparameter space. Moreover, we derive sensitivity projections for SuperCDMS at\nSNOLAB for silicon and germanium targets, as well as for various possible\nexperiments with scintillating targets (cesium iodide, sodium iodide, and\ngallium arsenide). The projected sensitivity can probe large new regions of\nparameter space. For axion-like particles, the same current direction detection\ndata improves on previously known direct-detection constraints but does not\nbound new parameter space beyond known stellar cooling bounds. However,\nprojected sensitivities of the upcoming SuperCDMS SNOLAB using germanium can go\nbeyond these and even probe parameter space consistent with possible hints from\nthe white dwarf luminosity function. We find similar results for dark photons\nfrom the sun. For all cases, direct-detection experiments can have\nunprecedented sensitivity to dark-sector particles.\n", "  The Wegner orbital model is a class of random operators introduced by Wegner\nto model the motion of a quantum particle with many internal degrees of freedom\n(orbitals) in a disordered medium. We consider the case when the matrix\npotential is Gaussian, and prove three results: localisation at strong\ndisorder, a Wegner-type estimate on the mean density of eigenvalues, and a\nMinami-type estimate on the probability of having multiple eigenvalues in a\nshort interval. The last two results are proved in the more general setting of\ndeformed block-Gaussian matrices, which includes a class of Gaussian band\nmatrices as a special case. Emphasis is placed on the dependence of the bounds\non the number of orbitals. As an additional application, we improve the upper\nbound on the localisation length for one-dimensional Gaussian band matrices.\n", "  Relativistic fermions in topological quantum materials are characterized by\nlinear energy-momentum dispersion near band crossing points. Under magnetic\nfield, relativistic fermions acquire Berry phase of {\\pi} in cyclotron motion,\nleading to a zeroth Landau level (LL) at the crossing point. Such\nfield-independent zeroth LL, which distinguishes relativistic fermions from\nconventional electron systems, is hardly probed in transport measurements since\nthe Fermi energy (EF) is usually not right at the band crossing points in most\ntopological materials. Here we report the observation of exotic quantum\ntransport behavior resulting from the zeroth LL in a multiband topological\nsemimetal YbMnBi2 which possesses linear band crossings both at and away from\nthe Fermi level (FL). We show that the Dirac bands with the crossing points\nbeing above or below the FL leads to Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations in the\nin-plane magnetoresistance, whereas the Dirac bands with the crossing points\nbeing at the FL results in unusual angular dependences of the out-of-plane\nmagnetoresistance and in-plane Hall resistivity due to the dependence of the\nzeroth LL's degeneracy on field orientation. Our results shed light on the\ntransport mechanism of the zeroth LL's relativistic fermions in layered\nmaterials.\n", "  Over the last decades, the distribution of income and wealth has been\ndeteriorating in many countries, leading to increased inequalities within and\nbetween societies. This tendency has revived the interest in the subject\ngreatly, yet it still receives very little attention within the realm of\nmainstream economic thinking. One reason for this is that the basic paradigm of\n\"standard economics\", the representative-agent General Equilibrium framework,\nis badly equipped to cope with distributional issues. Here we argue that when\nthe economy is treated as a complex system composed of many heterogeneous\ninteracting agents who give rise to emergent phenomena, to address the main\nstylized facts of income/wealth distribution requires leaving the toolbox of\nmainstream economics in favour of alternative approaches. The \"k-generalized\"\nfamily of income/wealth distributions, building on the categories of\ncomplexity, is an example of how advances in the field can be achieved within\nnew interdisciplinary research contexts.\n", "  For the assessment of radiation effects of clinical ion-beams, dosimetry has\nto be complemented by information on particle-energy distribution or related\nquantities. Fluorescence nuclear track detectors made from C,Mg-doped alumina\nsingle crystals allow for the quantification of ion track density and energy\nloss on a single-track basis. In this study, their feasibility and accuracy to\nquantify fluence, linear-energy-transfer (LET) distributions, and eventually\ndose for a spread-out carbon ion Bragg peak was investigated. We found that the\nprimary ions track densities agreed well with the reference data, but the\ndetermination of the individual detector sensitivity represented a major source\nof uncertainty in LET (and dose) assessment. While low-LET fragments in the\nbeam are not contributing to this dose significantly, their number of was\nlargely underestimated by approximately a factor three. The effect was most\npronounced for protons where the measured fluence deviates at least an order of\nmagnitude. We conclude that this is mainly caused by the wide angular\ndistribution of protons in a carbon beam. The use of a dedicated FNTD reader\ndevice and semi-automated workflow improved outcome due to the considerably\nlarger amount of data available as compared to a state-of-the-art multi-purpose\nconfocal laser scanning microscope.\n", "  This review covers results on the production of all possible electroweak\nboson pairs and 2-to-1 vector boson fusion at the CERN Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV.\nThe data were taken between 2010 and 2012. Limits on anomalous triple gauge\ncouplings (aTGCs) then follow. In addition, data on electroweak triple gauge\nboson production and 2-to-2 vector boson scattering yield limits on anomalous\nquartic gauge boson couplings (aQGCs). The LHC hosts two general purpose\nexperiments, ATLAS and CMS, which have both reported limits on aTGCs and aQGCs\nwhich are herein summarized. The interpretation of these limits in terms of an\neffective field theory is reviewed, and recommendations are made for testing\nother types of new physics using multi-gauge boson production.\n", "  Theoretical predictions are made for the current-voltage characteristics of\ntwo-dimensional heterojunction interlayer tunneling field-effect transistors\n(Thin-TFETs), focusing on the magnitude of the current that is achievable in\nsuch devices. A theory based on the Bardeen tunneling method is employed, using\nwavefunctions from first-principles density-functional theory. This method\npermits convenient incorporation of differing materials into the source and\ndrain electrodes, i.e. with different crystal structures, lattice constants,\nand/or band structures. Large variations in the tunnel currents are found,\ndepending on the particular two-dimensional materials used for the source and\ndrain electrodes. Tunneling between states derived from the center\n(Gamma-point) of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is found, in general, to lead to\nlarger current than for zone-edge (e.g. K-point) states. Differences, as large\nas an order of magnitude, between the present results and various prior\npredictions are discussed. Predicted values for the tunneling currents,\nincluding subthreshold swing, are compared with benchmark values for low-power\ndigital applications. Contact resistance is considered and its effect on the\ntunneling currents is demonstrated.\n", "  We review a construction called Non-Perturbative Gauge-Higgs Unification\nwhich is a rather rare type of Higgs mechanism that is a pure quantum and\nbosonic effect. It is constructed on a five-dimensional \"orbifold lattice\" with\nSU(2) bulk gauge symmetry and a (spontaneously broken) Abelian-Higgs like\ntheory on the boundaries.\n", "  This paper studies the effects of velocity gradients and secondary currents\non the distribution of the shear force between the walls and bed of rectangular\nopen channels. We show that neglecting the effect of secondary currents and\nassuming zero-shear division lines does not yield acceptable results. We,\naccordingly, introduce a method to determine the percentage of the total shear\nforce acting on the walls and bed of rectangular open channels, which takes\nboth the velocity gradients and secondary currents into account. Using the\nchannel bisectors, along which there is no secondary flows effect, and\northogonal trajectories to isovels, along which there is no shear stress, we\ndivide the channel cross section into three major subsections, namely bed area,\nwalls area, and shared area. The geometry of each subsection is derived given\nthe location of the maximum velocity. The share of the bed and wall shear\nforces from the shared area, are calculated afterward. The results for bed and\nwalls shear forces agree well with the experimental data with an average\nrelative error less than 5% for both regular flows and flows carrying suspended\nsediment. This method also provides a physics-driven range for the wall and bed\nshear forces which nicely covers the experimental data.\n", "  In the present work, we intend to predict the production rates of the Higgs\nbosons in the simplest extension of the Standard Model (SM) by a neutral\ncomplex singlet (cSMCS). This model has an additional source of CP violation\nand provides strong enough first-order electroweak phase transition to generate\nthe baryon asymmetry of universe (BAU). The scalar spectrum of the cSMCS\nincludes three neutral Higgs particles with the lightest one considered to be\nthe 125 GeV Higgs boson found at LHC. The SM-like Higgs boson comes mostly from\nthe SM-like SU(2) doublet, with a small correction from the singlet. To predict\nthe production rates of the Higgs bosons, we use a conventional effective LO\nQCD framework and the unintegrated parton distribution functions (UPDF) of\nKimber-Martin-Ryskin (KMR). We first compute the SM Higgs production\ncross-section and compare the results to the existing theoretical calculations\nfrom different frameworks as well as the experimental data from the CMS and\nATLAS collaborations. It is shown that our framework is capable of producing\nsound predictions for these high-energy QCD events in the SM. Afterwards we\npresent our predictions for the Higgs boson production in the cSMCS.\n", "  The thickness and interfacial geometry of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) films\ngrown by chemical vapor deposition on polycrystalline nickel foils is studied\nusing low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM). The reflectivity of the electrons,\nmeasured over an energy range of 0 - 20 eV, reveals distinct minima and maxima.\nThe measured data is compared with simulations based on a first-principles\ndescription of the electronic structure of the material. From this comparison,\nthe number of hBN layers and the separation between the lowest hBN layer and\nthe nickel surface is deduced. The coupling of interlayer states of the hBN to\nboth image-potential and Shockley-type surface states of the nickel is\ndiscussed, and the dependence of the reflectivity spectra on the surface\norientation of nickel grains is examined.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce an interactive coastal wave simulation and\nvisualization software, called Celeris. Celeris is an open source software\nwhich needs minimum preparation to run on a Windows machine. The software\nsolves the extended Boussinesq equations using a hybrid finite volume - finite\ndifference method and supports moving shoreline boundaries. The simulation and\nvisualization are performed on the GPU using Direct3D libraries, which enables\nthe software to run faster than real-time. Celeris provides a first-of-its-kind\ninteractive modeling platform for coastal wave applications and it supports\nsimultaneous visualization with both photorealistic and colormapped rendering\ncapabilities. We validate our software through comparison with three standard\nbenchmarks for non-breaking and breaking waves.\n", "  Nonabelian anyons offer the prospect of storing quantum information in a\ntopological qubit protected from decoherence, with the degree of protection\ndetermined by the energy gap separating the topological vacuum from its low\nlying excitations. Originally proposed to occur in quantum wells in high\nmagnetic fields, experimental systems thought to harbor nonabelian anyons range\nfrom p-wave superfluids to superconducting systems with strong spin orbit\ncoupling. However, all of these systems are characterized by small energy gaps,\nand despite several decades of experimental work, definitive evidence for\nnonabelian anyons remains elusive. Here, we report the observation of arobust,\nincompressible even-denominator fractional quantum Hall phase in a new\ngeneration of dual-gated, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated bilayer graphene\nsamples. Numerical simulations suggest that this state is in the Pfaffian phase\nand hosts nonabelian anyons, and the measured energy gaps are several times\nlarger than those observed in other systems. Moreover, the unique electronic\nstructure of bilayer graphene endows the electron system with two new control\nparameters. Magnetic field continuously tunes the effective electron\ninteractions, changing the even-denominator gap non-monotonically and\nconsistent with predictions that a transition between the Pfaffian phase and\nthe composite Fermi liquid (CFL) occurs just beyond the experimentally explored\nmagnetic field range. Electric field, meanwhile, tunes crossings between levels\nfrom different valleys. By directly measuring the valley polarization, we\nobserve a continuous transition from an incompressible to a compressible phase\nat half-filling mediated by an unexpected incompressible, yet polarizable,\nintermediate phase. Valley conservation implies this phase is an electrical\ninsulator with gapless neutral excitations.\n", "  Superconductivity develops in bulk doped SrTiO$_3$ and at the\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface with a dome-shaped density dependence of the\ncritical temperature $T_c$, despite different dimensionalities and geometries.\nWe propose that the $T_c$ dome of LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ is a shape resonance due\nto quantum confinement of superconducting bulk SrTiO$_3$. We substantiate this\ninterpretation by comparing the exact solutions of a three-dimensional and\nquasi-two-dimensional two-band BCS gap equation. This comparison highlights the\nrole of heavy bands for $T_c$ in both geometries. For bulk SrTiO$_3$, we\nextract the density dependence of the pairing interaction from the fit to\nexperimental data. We apply quantum confinement in a square potential well of\nfinite depth and calculate $T_c$ in the confined configuration. We compare the\ncalculated $T_c$ to transport experiments and provide an explanation as to why\nthe optimal $T_c$'s are so close to each other in two-dimensional interfaces\nand the three-dimensional bulk material.\n", "  Topological band structures can be designed by subjecting lattice systems to\ntime-periodic modulations, as was recently demonstrated in cold atoms and\nphotonic crystals. However, changing the topological nature of Floquet Bloch\nbands from trivial to non-trivial, by progressively launching the\ntime-modulation, is necessarily accompanied with gap-closing processes: this\nhas important consequences for the loading of particles into a target Floquet\nband with non-trivial topology, and hence, on the subsequent measurements. In\nthis work, we analyse how such loading sequences can be optimized in view of\nprobing the topology of Floquet bands through transport measurements. In\nparticular, we demonstrate the robustness of center-of-mass responses, as\ncompared to current responses, which present important irregularities due to an\ninterplay between the micro-motion of the drive and inter-band interference\neffects. The results presented in this work illustrate how probing the\ncenter-of-mass displacement of atomic clouds offers a reliable method to detect\nthe topology of Floquet bands, after realistic loading sequences.\n", "  A little addition of Cl to \\ce{MAPbI3} has been reported to improve the\nmaterial stability as well as light harvesting and carrier conducting\nproperties of organometal trihalide perovskites, the key component of\nperovskite solar cell (PSC). However, the mechanism of performance enhancement\nof PSC by Cl addition is still unclear. Here, we apply the efficient virtual\ncrystal approximation method to revealing the effects of Cl addition on the\nstructural, electronic, optical properties and material stability of\n\\ce{MAPb(I_{1-x}Cl_x)3}. Our {\\it ab initio} calculations present that as the\nincrease of Cl content cubic lattice constants and static dielectric constants\ndecrease linearly, while band gaps and exciton binding energies increase\nquadratically. Moreover, we find the minimum of exciton binding energy at the\nCl content of 7\\%, at which the chemical decomposition reaction changes\ncoincidentally to be from exothermic to endothermic. Interactions among\nconstituents of compound and electronic charge transferring during formation\nare carefully discussed. This reveals new prospects for understanding and\ndesigning of stable, high efficiency PSCs.\n", "  We present the potential sensitivity of a future recoil detector for a first\ndetection of the process of coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering\n(CE$\\nu$NS). We use the Chooz reactor complex in France as our luminous source\nof reactor neutrinos. Leveraging the ability to cleanly separate the rate\ncorrelated with the reactor thermal power against (uncorrelated) backgrounds,\nwe show that a 10 kilogram cryogenic bolometric array with 100 eV threshold\nshould be able to extract a CE$\\nu$NS signal within one year of running.\n", "  The validity of the anelastic approximation has recently been questioned in\nthe regime of rapidly-rotating compressible convection in low Prandtl number\nfluids (Calkins et al. 2015). Given the broad usage and the high computational\nefficiency of sound-proof approaches in this astrophysically relevant regime,\nthis paper clarifies the conditions for a safe application. The potential of\nthe alternative pseudo-incompressible approximation is investigated, which in\ncontrast to the anelastic approximation is shown to never break down for\npredicting the point of marginal stability. Its accuracy, however, decreases\nclose to the parameters corresponding to the failure of the anelastic approach,\nwhich is shown to occur when the sound-crossing time of the domain exceeds a\nrotation time scale, i.e. for rotational Mach numbers greater than one.\nConcerning the supercritical case, which is naturally characterised by smaller\nrotational Mach numbers, we find that the anelastic approximation does not show\nunphysical behaviour. Growth rates computed with the linearised anelastic\nequations converge toward the corresponding fully compressible values as the\nRayleigh number increases. Likewise, our fully nonlinear turbulent simulations,\nproduced with our fully compressible and anelastic models and carried out in a\nhighly supercritical, rotating, compressible, low Prandtl number regime show\ngood agreement. However, this nonlinear test example is for only a moderately\nlow convective Rossby number of 0.14.\n", "  We relate the forward two-photon exchange (TPE) amplitudes to integrals of\nthe inclusive lepton-proton scattering cross sections. These relations yield an\nalternative way for the evaluation of the TPE correction to hyperfine-splitting\n(HFS) in the hydrogen-like atoms with an equivalent to the standard approach\n(Iddings, Drell and Sullivan) result implying the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum\nrule. For evaluation of the individual effects (e.g., elastic contribution) our\napproach yields a distinct result. We compare both methods numerically on\nexamples of the elastic contribution and the full TPE correction to HFS in\nelectronic and muonic hydrogen.\n", "  We investigate generalized band structures of Rayleigh wave in 1-D phononic\ncrystals in the context of Green-Nagdhi thermoelastic (TE) theory. Solutions of\nthe coupled equations included thermal field are obtained firstly. Then\naccording to boundary conditions, phase velocity is derived. The transfer\nmatrix methodology is adopted in order to formulate the band structures of\ngeneralized TE Rayleigh wave. It is demonstrated that the band structure of TE\nRayleigh wave is comprised of elastic and thermal bands. For Aluminum-Epoxy\nphononic crystal, the thermoelasticity can influence the transmission ability\nof band gaps as well as narrow down the band gap width.\n", "  Nonreciprocal microwave devices, such as circulators, are useful in routing\nquantum signals in quantum networks and protecting quantum systems against\nnoise coming from the detection chain. However, commercial, cryogenic\ncirculators, now in use, are unsuitable for scalable superconducting quantum\narchitectures due to their appreciable size, loss, and inherent magnetic field.\nWe report on the measurement of a key nonreciprocal element, i.e., the gyrator,\nwhich can be used to realize a circulator. Unlike state-of-the-art gyrators,\nwhich use a magneto-optic effect to induce a phase shift of $\\pi$ between\ntransmitted signals in opposite directions, our device uses the phase\nnonreciprocity of a Josephson-based three-wave-mixing device. By coupling two\nof these mixers and operating them in noiseless frequency-conversion mode, we\nshow that the device acts as a nonreciprocal phase shifter whose phase shift is\ncontrolled by the phase difference of the microwave tones driving the mixers.\nSuch a device could be used to realize a lossless, on-chip, superconducting\ncirculator suitable for quantum-information-processing applications.\n", "  Energies from alpha- and proton-decay experiments yield information of\ncapital importance for deriving the atomic masses of superheavy and exotic\nnuclides. We present a procedure to correct the published decay energies in\ncase the recoiling daughter nuclides were not considered properly in\nimplantation experiments. A program has been developed based on Lindhard's\nintegral theory, which can accurately predict the energy deposition of heavy\natomic projectiles in matter.\n", "  We analyze the propagation of quantum states in the presence of weak\ndisorder. In particular, we investigate the reliable transmittance of quantum\nstates, as potential carriers of quantum information, through\ndisorder-perturbed waveguides. We quantify wave-packet distortion,\nbackscattering, and disorder-induced dephasing, which all act detrimentally on\ntransport, and identify conditions for reliable transmission. Our analysis\nrelies on the treatment of the nonequilibrium dynamics of ensemble-averaged\nquantum states in terms of quantum master equations.\n", "  Recent experiments show that an atomic step on the surface of atomically thin\nmetallic films can strongly affect electronic transport. Here we reveal\nmultiple and versatile effects that such a surface step can have on\nsuperconductivity in ultrathin films. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nequations self-consistently in this regime, where quantum confinement dominates\nthe emergent physics, we show that the electronic structure is profoundly\nmodified on the two sides of the step, as is the spatial distribution of the\nsuperconducting order parameter and its dependence on temperature and\nelectronic gating. Furthermore, the surface step changes non-trivially the\ntransport properties both in the proximity-induced superconducting order\nparameter and the Josephson effect, depending on the step height. These results\noffer a new route to tailor superconducting circuits and design atomically thin\nhetero-junctions made of one same material.\n", "  In this work we have applied the recently formulated self-compressed\ninhomogeneous stabilized jellium model [M. Payami and T. Mahmoodi, Can. J.\nPhys. {\\bf 89}, 967 (2011)] to describe the equilibrium electronic and\ngeometric properties of atomic-closed-shell simple metal clusters of Al$_N$\n($N$=13, 19, 43, 55, 79, 87, 135, 141), Na$_N$, and Cs$_N$ ($N$=9, 15, 27, 51,\n59, 65, 89, 113). To validate the results, we have also performed\nfirst-principles pseudo-potential calculations and used them as our reference.\nIn the model, we have considered two regions consisting of \"surface\" and\n\"inner\" ones, the border separating them is sharp. This generalization makes\npossible to decouple the relaxations of different parts of the system. The\nresults show that the present model correctly predicts the size reductions seen\nin most of the clusters. It also predicts increase in size of some clusters, as\nobserved from first-principles results. The other property is the change of\ninter-layer distances, which in most cases were realized as contractions and in\na few cases as expansions, are reproduced in good agreement with the atomic\nsimulation results. For a better description of the properties, it is possible\nto improve the method of choosing the thicknesses or generalize the model to\ninclude more regions than just two.\n", "  At the exceptional point where two eigenstates coalesce in open quantum\nsystems, the usual diagonalization scheme breaks down and the Hamiltonian can\nonly be reduced to Jordan block form. Most of the studies on the exceptional\npoint appearing in the literature introduce a phenomenological effective\nHamiltonian that essentially reduces the problem to that of a finite\nnon-Hermitian matrix for which it is straightforward to obtain the Jordan form.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate how the Hamiltonian of an open quantum system\nreduces to Jordan block form at an exceptional point in an exact manner that\ntreats the continuum without any approximation. Our method relies on the\nBrillouin-Wigner-Feshbach projection method according to which we can obtain a\nfinite dimensional effective Hamiltonian that shares the discrete sector of the\nspectrum with the original Hamiltonian. While owing to its eigenvalue\ndependence this effective Hamiltonian cannot be used to write the Jordan block\ndirectly, we show that by formally extending the problem to include eigenstates\nwith complex eigenvalues that reside outside the usual Hilbert space, we can\nobtain the Jordan block form at the exceptional point without introducing any\napproximation. We also introduce an extended Jordan form basis away from the\nexceptional point, which provides an alternative way to obtain the Jordan block\nat an exceptional point. The extended Jordan block connects continuously to the\nJordan block exactly at the exceptional point implying that the observable\nquantities are continuous at the exceptional point.\n", "  Dark matter that possesses a particle-antiparticle asymmetry and has\nthermalised in the early universe, requires a larger annihilation cross-section\ncompared to symmetric dark matter, in order to deplete the dark antiparticles\nand account for the observed dark matter density. The annihilation\ncross-section determines the residual symmetric component of dark matter, which\nmay give rise to annihilation signals during CMB and inside haloes today. We\nconsider dark matter with long-range interactions, in particular dark matter\ncoupled to a light vector or scalar force mediator. We compute the couplings\nrequired to attain a final antiparticle-to-particle ratio after the thermal\nfreeze-out of the annihilation processes in the early universe, and then\nestimate the late-time annihilation signals. We show that, due to the\nSommerfeld enhancement, highly asymmetric dark matter with long-range\ninteractions can have a significant annihilation rate, potentially larger than\nsymmetric dark matter of the same mass with contact interactions. We discuss\ncaveats in this estimation, relating to the formation of stable bound states.\nFinally, we consider the non-relativistic partial-wave unitarity bound on the\ninelastic cross-section, we discuss why it can be realised only by long-range\ninteractions, and showcase the importance of higher partial waves in this\nregime of large inelasticity. We derive upper bounds on the mass of symmetric\nand asymmetric thermal-relic dark matter for s-wave and p-wave annihilation,\nand exhibit how these bounds strengthen as the dark asymmetry increases.\n", "  The ability of the mammalian ear in processing high frequency sounds, up to\n$\\sim$100 kHz, is based on the capability of outer hair cells (OHCs) responding\nto stimulation at high frequencies. These cells show a unique motility in their\ncell body coupled with charge movement. With this motile element, voltage\nchanges generated by stimuli at their hair bundles drives the cell body and\nthat, in turn, amplifies the stimuli. In vitro experiments show that the\nmovement of these charges significantly increases the membrane capacitance,\nlimiting the motile activity by additionally attenuating voltage changes. It\nwas found, however, that such an effect is due to the absence of mechanical\nload. In the presence of mechanical resonance, such as in vivo conditions, the\nmovement of motile charges is expected to create negative capacitance near the\nresonance frequency. Therefore this motile mechanism is effective at high\nfrequencies.\n", "  We address the dynamics of a bosonic system coupled to either a bosonic or a\nmagnetic environment, and derive a set of sufficient conditions that allow one\nto describe the dynamics in terms of the effective interaction with a classical\nfluctuating field. We find that for short interaction times the dynamics of the\nopen system is described by a Gaussian noise map for several different\ninteraction models and independently on the temperature of the environment. In\norder to go beyond a qualitative understanding of the origin and physical\nmeaning of the above short-time constraint, we take a general viewpoint and,\nbased on an algebraic approach, suggest that any quantum environment can be\ndescribed by classical fields whenever global symmetries lead to the definition\nof environmental operators that remain well defined when increasing the size,\ni.e. the number of dynamical variables, of the environment. In the case of the\nbosonic environment this statement is exactly demonstrated via a constructive\nprocedure that explicitly shows why a large number of environmental dynamical\nvariables and, necessarily, global symmetries, entail the set of conditions\nderived in the first part of the work.\n", "  We study minimizers of the pseudo-relativistic Hartree functional\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{a}(u):=\\|(-\\Delta+m^{2})^{1/4}u\\|_{L^{2}}^{2}-\\frac{a}{2}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}}(\\left|\\cdot\\right|^{-1}\\star\n|u|^{2})(x)|u(x)|^{2}{\\rm d}x+\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}}V(x)|u(x)|^{2}{\\rm d}x$$\nunder the mass constraint $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3}|u(x)|^2{\\rm d}x=1$. Here $m>0$\nis the mass of particles and $V\\geq 0$ is an external potential. We prove that\nminimizers exist if and only if $a$ satisfies $0\\leq a<a^{*}$, and there is no\nminimizer if $a\\geq a^*$, where $a^*$ is called the Chandrasekhar limit}. When\n$a$ approaches $a^*$ from below, the blow-up behavior of minimizers is derived\nunder some general external potentials $V$. Here we consider three cases of\n$V$: trapping potential, i.e. $V\\in L_{{\\rm loc}}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^3)$\nsatisfies $\\lim_{|x|\\to \\infty}V(x)=\\infty$; periodic potential, i.e. $V\\in\nC(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ stisfies $V(x+z)=V(x)$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{Z}^3$; and\nring-shaped potential, e.g. $\n  V(x)=||x|-1|^p$ for some $p>0$.\n", "  Recently, Hawking, Perry and Strominger described a physical process that\nimplants supertranslational hair on a Schwarzschild black hole by an infalling\nmatter shock wave without spherical symmetry. Using the BMS-type symmetries of\nthe Rindler horizon, we present an analogous process that implants\nsupertranslational hair on a Rindler horizon by a matter shock wave without\nplanar symmetry, and we investigate the corresponding memory effect on the\nRindler family of uniformly linearly accelerated observers. We assume each\nobserver to remain linearly uniformly accelerated through the wave, in the\nsense of the curved spacetime generalisation of the Letaw-Frenet equations.\nStarting with a family of observers who follow the orbits of a single boost\nKilling vector before the wave, we find that after the wave has passed, each\nobserver still follows the orbit of a boost Killing vector but this boost\ndiffers from trajectory to trajectory, and the trajectory-dependence carries a\nmemory of the planar inhomogeneity of the wave. We anticipate this classical\nmemory phenomenon to have a counterpart in Rindler space quantum field theory.\n", "  The Higgs self-coupling is notoriously intangible at the LHC. It was recently\nproposed to probe the trilinear Higgs interaction through its radiative\ncorrections to single-Higgs processes. This approach however requires to\ndisentangle these effects from those associated to deviations of other\nHiggs-couplings to fermions and gauge bosons. We show that a global fit\nexploiting only single-Higgs inclusive data suffers from degeneracies that\nprevent one from extracting robust bounds on each individual coupling. We show\nhow the inclusion of double-Higgs production via gluon fusion, and the use of\ndifferential measurements in the associated single-Higgs production channels\nWH, ZH and ttH, can help to overcome the deficiencies of a global\nHiggs-couplings fit. In particular, we bound the variations of the Higgs\ntrilinear self-coupling relative to its SM value to the interval [0.1, 2.3] at\n68% confidence level at the high-luminosity LHC, and we discuss the robustness\nof our results against various assumptions on the experimental uncertainties\nand the underlying new physics dynamics. We also study how to obtain a\nparametrically enhanced deviation of the Higgs self-couplings and we estimate\nhow large this deviation can be in a self-consistent effective field theory\nframework.\n", "  We perform a three-dimensional (3D) global simulation of Earth's\nmagnetosphere with kinetic reconnection physics to study the flux transfer\nevents (FTEs) and dayside magnetic reconnection with the recently developed\nmagnetohydrodynamics with embedded particle-in-cell model (MHD-EPIC). During\nthe one-hour long simulation, the FTEs are generated quasi-periodically near\nthe subsolar point and move toward the poles. We find the magnetic field\nsignature of FTEs at their early formation stage is similar to a `crater FTE',\nwhich is characterized by a magnetic field strength dip at the FTE center.\nAfter the FTE core field grows to a significant value, it becomes an FTE with\ntypical flux rope structure. When an FTE moves across the cusp, reconnection\nbetween the FTE field lines and the cusp field lines can dissipate the FTE. The\nkinetic features are also captured by our model. A crescent electron phase\nspace distribution is found near the reconnection site. A similar distribution\nis found for ions at the location where the Larmor electric field appears. The\nlower hybrid drift instability (LHDI) along the current sheet direction also\narises at the interface of magnetosheath and magnetosphere plasma. The LHDI\nelectric field is about 8 mV/m and its dominant wavelength relative to the\nelectron gyroradius agrees reasonably with MMS observations.\n", "  We investigate the possible collider signatures of a new Higgs in simple\nextensions of the Standard Model where baryon number is a local symmetry\nspontaneously broken at the low scale. We refer to this new Higgs as \"Baryonic\nHiggs\". This Higgs has peculiar properties since it can decay into all Standard\nModel particles, the leptophobic gauge boson, and the vector-like quarks\npresent in these theories to ensure anomaly cancellation. We investigate in\ndetail the constraints from the $\\gamma \\gamma$, $Z \\gamma$, $Z Z$, and $W W$\nsearches at the Large Hadron Collider, needed to find a lower bound on the\nscale at which baryon number is spontaneously broken. The di-photon channel\nturns out to be a very sensitive probe in the case of small scalar mixing and\ncan severely constrain the baryonic scale. We also study the properties of the\nleptophobic gauge boson in order to understand the testability of these\ntheories at the LHC.\n", "  This paper studies different signaling techniques on the continuous spectrum\n(CS) of nonlinear optical fiber defined by nonlinear Fourier transform. Three\ndifferent signaling techniques are proposed and analyzed based on the\nstatistics of the noise added to CS after propagation along the nonlinear\noptical fiber. The proposed methods are compared in terms of error performance,\ndistance reach, and complexity. Furthermore, the effect of chromatic dispersion\non the data rate and noise in nonlinear spectral domain is investigated. It is\ndemonstrated that, for a given sequence of CS symbols, an optimal bandwidth (or\nsymbol rate) can be determined so that the temporal duration of the propagated\nsignal at the end of the fiber is minimized. In effect, the required guard\ninterval between the subsequently transmitted data packets in time is minimized\nand the effective data rate is significantly enhanced. Moreover, by selecting\nthe proper signaling method and design criteria a reach distance of 7100 km is\nreported by only singling on the CS at a rate of 9.6 Gbps.\n", "  Recently we have proved factorization of infrared divergences in NRQCD S-wave\nheavy quarkonium production at high energy colliders at all orders in coupling\nconstant. One of the problem which still exists in the higher order pQCD\ncalculation of color singlet P-wave heavy quarkonium production/anihillation is\nthe appearance of non-canceling infrared divergences due to real soft gluons\nexchange, although no such infrared divergences are present in the color\nsinglet S-wave heavy quarkonium. In this paper we find that since the\nnon-perturbative matrix element of the color singlet P-wave heavy quarkonium\nproduction contains derivative operators, the gauge links are necessary to make\nit gauge invariant and be consistent with the factorization of such\nnon-canceling infrared divergences at all orders in coupling constant.\n", "  The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description of plasmas with relativistic\nparticles necessarily includes an additional new field, the chiral chemical\npotential associated with the axial charge (i.e., the number difference between\nright- and left-handed relativistic fermions). This chiral chemical potential\ngives rise to a contribution to the electric current density of the plasma\n(\\emph{chiral magnetic effect}). We present a self-consistent treatment of the\n\\emph{chiral MHD equations}, which include the back-reaction of the magnetic\nfield on a chiral chemical potential and its interaction with the plasma\nvelocity field. A number of novel phenomena are exhibited. First, we show that\nthe chiral magnetic effect decreases the frequency of the Alfv\\'{e}n wave for\nincompressible flows, increases the frequencies of the Alfv\\'{e}n wave and of\nthe fast magnetosonic wave for compressible flows, and decreases the frequency\nof the slow magnetosonic wave. Second, we show that, in addition to the\nwell-known laminar chiral dynamo effect, which is not related to fluid motions,\nthere is a dynamo caused by the joint action of velocity shear and chiral\nmagnetic effect. In the presence of turbulence with vanishing mean kinetic\nhelicity, the derived mean-field chiral MHD equations describe turbulent\nlarge-scale dynamos caused by the chiral alpha effect, which is dominant for\nlarge fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers. The chiral alpha effect is due to an\ninteraction of the chiral magnetic effect and fluctuations of the small-scale\ncurrent produced by tangling magnetic fluctuations (which are generated by\ntangling of the large-scale magnetic field by sheared velocity fluctuations).\nThese dynamo effects may have interesting consequences in the dynamics of the\nearly universe, neutron stars, and the quark--gluon plasma.\n", "  We have developed a hyperspectral imaging scheme that involves a combination\nof dual-comb spectroscopy and Hadamard-transform-based single-pixel imaging.\nThe scheme enables us to obtain 12,000 hyperspectral images of amplitude and\nphase at a spatial resolution of 46 um without mechanical scanning. The\nspectral resolution is 20 MHz, as determined by the linewidth of a single comb\nmode, and the spectral interval is 100 MHz over a spectral range of 1.2 THz\ncentred at 191.5 THz. As an initial demonstration of our scheme, we obtained\nspectroscopic images of a standard test chart through an etalon plate. The\nthickness of an absorptive chromium-coated layer on a float-glass substrate was\ndetermined to be 70 nm from the hyperspectral phase images in the near-infrared\nwavelength region.\n", "  We present results on the nucleon axial and induced pseudo-scalar form\nfactors using an ensemble of two degenerate twisted mass clover-improved\nfermions generated at the physical value of the pion mass. We evaluate the\nisovector and the isoscalar, as well as, the strange and the charm axial form\nfactors. The disconnected contributions are evaluated using recently developed\nmethods that include deflation of the lower eigenstates, allowing us to extract\nthe isoscalar, strange and charm axial form factors. We find that the\ndisconnected quark loop contributions are non-zero and particularly large for\nthe induced pseudo-scalar form factor.\n", "  We study scalar and electromagnetic perturbations of a family of nonsingular\nnonrotating black hole spacetimes that are solutions in a large class of\nconformally invariant theories of gravity. The effective potential for scalar\nperturbations depends on the exact form of the scaling factor. Electromagnetic\nperturbations do not feel the scaling factor, and the corresponding quasinormal\nmode spectrum is the same as in the Schwarzschild metric. We find that these\nblack hole metrics are stable under scalar and electromagnetic perturbations.\nAssuming that the quasinormal mode spectrum for scalar perturbations is not too\ndifferent from that for gravitational perturbations, we can expect that the\ncalculation of the quasinormal mode spectrum and the observation with\ngravitational wave detectors of quasinormal modes from astrophysical black\nholes can constrain the scaling factor and test these solutions.\n", "  We investigate the use of twin-mode quantum states of light with symmetric\nstatistical features in their photon number for improving intensity-sensitive\nsurface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors. For this purpose, one of the modes is\nsent into a prism setup where the Kretschmann configuration is employed as a\nsensing platform and the analyte to be measured influences the SPR excitation\nconditions. This influence modifies the output state of light that is\nsubsequently analyzed by an intensity-difference measurement scheme. We show\nthat quantum noise reduction is achieved not only as a result of the\nsub-Poissonian statistical nature of a single mode, but also as a result of the\nnon-classical correlation of the photon number between the two modes. When\ncombined with the high sensitivity of the SPR sensor, we show that the use of\ntwin-mode quantum states of light notably enhances the estimation precision of\nthe refractive index of an analyte. With this we are able to identify a clear\nstrategy to further boost the performance of SPR sensors, which are already a\nmature technology in biochemical and medical sensing applications.\n", "  One of the few accepted dynamical foundations of non-additive\n\"non-extensive\") statistical mechanics is that the choice of the appropriate\nentropy functional describing a system with many degrees of freedom should\nreflect the rate of growth of its configuration or phase space volume. We\npresent an example of a group, as a metric space, that may be used as the phase\nspace of a system whose ergodic behavior is statistically described by the\nrecently proposed $\\delta$-entropy. This entropy is a one-parameter variation\nof the Boltzmann/Gibbs/Shannon functional and is quite different, in form, from\nthe power-law entropies that have been recently studied. We use the first\nGrigorchuk group for our purposes. We comment on the connections of the above\nconstruction with the conjectured evolution of the underlying system in phase\nspace.\n", "  The ability to monitor respiratory rate is extremely important for medical\ntreatment, healthcare and fitness sectors. In many situations, mobile methods,\nwhich allow users to undertake every day activities, are required. However,\ncurrent monitoring systems can be obtrusive, requiring users to wear\nrespiration belts or nasal probes. Recent advances in thermographic systems\nhave shrunk their size, weight and cost, to the point where it is possible to\ncreate smart-phone based respiration rate monitoring devices that are not\naffected by lighting conditions. However, mobile thermal imaging is challenged\nin scenes with high thermal dynamic ranges. This challenge is further amplified\nby general problems such as motion artifacts and low spatial resolution,\nleading to unreliable breathing signals. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nrobust approach for respiration tracking which compensates for the negative\neffects of variations in the ambient temperature and motion artifacts and can\naccurately extract breathing rates in highly dynamic thermal scenes. It has\nthree main contributions. The first is a novel Optimal Quantization technique\nwhich adaptively constructs a color mapping of absolute temperature to improve\nsegmentation, classification and tracking. The second is the Thermal Gradient\nFlow method that computes thermal gradient magnitude maps to enhance accuracy\nof the nostril region tracking. Finally, we introduce the Thermal Voxel method\nto increase the reliability of the captured respiration signals compared to the\ntraditional averaging method. We demonstrate the extreme robustness of our\nsystem to track the nostril-region and measure the respiratory rate in high\ndynamic range scenes.\n", "  To study the nature of the state $Y(2175)$, a dedicated data set of $e^+e^-$\ncollision data was collected at the center-of-mass energy of 2.125 GeV with the\nBESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. By analyzing large-angle Bhabha\nscattering events, the integrated luminosity of this data set is determined to\nbe $108.49\\pm0.02\\pm0.85$ pb$^{-1}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical\nand the second one is systematic. In addition, the center-of-mass energy of the\ndata set is determined with radiative dimuon events to be\n$2126.55\\pm0.03\\pm0.85$ MeV, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the\nsecond one is systematic.\n", "  Spectroscopic ellipsometry is a means to investigate optical and dielectric\nmaterial responses. Conventional spectroscopic ellipsometry has trade-offs\nbetween spectral accuracy, resolution, and measurement time. Polarization\nmodulation has afforded poor performance due to its sensitivity to mechanical\nvibrational noise, thermal instability, and polarization wavelength dependency.\nWe equip a spectroscopic ellipsometer with dual-optical-comb spectroscopy, viz.\ndual-optical-comb spectroscopic ellipsometry (DCSE). The DCSE directly and\nsimultaneously obtains amplitude and phase information with ultra-high spectral\nprecision that is beyond the conventional limit. This precision is due to the\nautomatic time-sweeping acquisition of the interferogram using Fourier\ntransform spectroscopy and optical combs with well-defined frequency.\nEllipsometric evaluation without polarization modulation also enhances the\nstability and robustness of the system. In this study, we evaluate the DCSE of\nbirefringent materials and thin films, which showed improved spectral accuracy\nand a resolution of up to 1.2x10-5 nm across a 5-10 THz spectral bandwidth\nwithout any mechanical movement.\n", "  In this work we present, for the first time, the non-perturbative\nrenormalization for the unpolarized, helicity and transversity quasi-PDFs, in\nan RI' scheme. The proposed prescription addresses simultaneously all aspects\nof renormalization: logarithmic divergences, finite renormalization as well as\nthe linear divergence which is present in the matrix elements of fermion\noperators with Wilson lines. Furthermore, for the case of the unpolarized\nquasi-PDFs, we describe how to eliminate the unwanted mixing with the twist-3\nscalar operator. We utilize perturbation theory for the one-loop conversion\nfactor that brings the renormalization functions to the MS-scheme at a scale of\n2 GeV. We also explain how to improve the estimates on the renormalization\nfunctions by eliminating lattice artifacts. The latter can be computed in\none-loop perturbation theory and to all orders in the lattice spacing. We apply\nthe methodology for the renormalization to an ensemble of twisted mass fermions\nwith Nf=2+1+1 dynamical light quarks, and a pion mass of around 375 MeV.\n", "  We show that the uncertainty in distance and time measurements found by the\nheuristic combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity is reproduced\nin a purely classical and flat multi-fractal spacetime whose geometry changes\nwith the probed scale (dimensional flow) and has non-zero imaginary dimension,\ncorresponding to a discrete scale invariance at short distances. Thus,\ndimensional flow can manifest itself as an intrinsic measurement uncertainty\nand, conversely, measurement-uncertainty estimates are generally valid because\nthey rely on this universal property of quantum geometries. These general\nresults affect multi-fractional theories, a recent proposal related to quantum\ngravity, in two ways: they can fix two parameters previously left free (in\nparticular, the value of the spacetime dimension at short scales) and point\ntowards a reinterpretation of the ultraviolet structure of geometry as a\nstochastic foam or fuzziness. This is also confirmed by a correspondence we\nestablish between Nottale scale relativity and the stochastic geometry of\nmulti-fractional models.\n", "  Balanced gain and loss renders the mean-field description of Bose-Einstein\ncondensates PT symmetric. However, any experimental realization has to deal\nwith unbalancing in the gain and loss contributions breaking the PT symmetry.\nWe will show that such an asymmetry does not necessarily lead to a system\nwithout a stable mean-field ground state. Indeed, by exploiting the nonlinear\nproperties of the condensate, a small asymmetry can stabilize the system even\nfurther due to a self-regulation of the particle number.\n", "  We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the CP$^{N-1}$ model on the square\nlattice for $N=10$, $21$, and $41$. Our focus is on the severe slowing down\nrelated to instantons. To fight this problem we employ open boundary conditions\nas proposed by L\\\"uscher and Schaefer for lattice QCD. Furthermore we test the\nefficiency of parallel tempering in a line defect. Our results for open\nboundary conditions are consistent with the expectation that topological\nfreezing is avoided, while autocorrelation times are still large. The results\nobtained with parallel tempering are encouraging.\n", "  Minimum energy paths for transitions such as atomic and/or spin\nrearrangements in thermalized systems are the transition paths of largest\nstatistical weight. Such paths are frequently calculated using the nudged\nelastic band method, where an initial path is iteratively shifted to the\nnearest minimum energy path. The computational effort can be large, especially\nwhen ab initio or electron density functional calculations are used to evaluate\nthe energy and atomic forces. Here, we show how the number of such evaluations\ncan be reduced by an order of magnitude using a Gaussian process regression\napproach where an approximate energy surface is generated and refined in each\niteration. When the goal is to evaluate the transition rate within harmonic\ntransition state theory, the evaluation of the Hessian matrix at the initial\nand final state minima can be carried out beforehand and used as input in the\nminimum energy path calculation, thereby improving stability and reducing the\nnumber of iterations needed for convergence. A Gaussian process model also\nprovides an uncertainty estimate for the approximate energy surface, and this\ncan be used to focus the calculations on the lesser-known part of the path,\nthereby reducing the number of needed energy and force evaluations to a half in\nthe present calculations. The methodology is illustrated using the\ntwo-dimensional M\\\"uller-Brown potential surface and performance assessed on an\nestablished benchmark involving 13 rearrangement transitions of a heptamer\nisland on a solid surface.\n", "  Simulating the detailed movement of a rising bubble can be challenging,\nespecially when it comes to bubble path instabilities. Free rising ellipsoidal\nbubbles not only move in straight lines but can describe sinusoidal, zigzag or\nspiraling paths. The common Euler Euler (EE) simulation techniques can no\nlonger resolve the actual movement patterns and Direct Numerical Simulations\n(DNS) tend to be very costly when simulating a larger number of bubbles. A\nsolution based on the Euler Lagrange (EL) approach is presented, where the\nbubbles show oscillating shape and/or instable paths while computational cost\nare at a far lower level than in DNS. The model calculates direction, shape and\nrotation of the bubbles to finally create typical instable path lines. This is\nembedded in an EL simulation, which can resolve bubble size distribution, mass\ntransfer and chemical reactions. To ensure realistic solution, validation\nagainst experimental data of single rising bubbles and bubble swarms are\npresented. References with 2D and also 3D analysis are taken into account to\ncompare simulative data in terms of typical geometrical parameters and average\nfield values.\n", "  Recently Ding et al. [Phys. Rev. B 95, 184404 (2017)] reported that their\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study on EuCo$_2$As$_2$ successfully\ncharacterized the antiferromagnetic (AFM) propagation vector of the\nincommensurate helix AFM state, showing that NMR is a unique tool for\ndetermination of the spin structures in incommensurate helical AFMs. Motivated\nby this work, we have carried out $^{153}$Eu, $^{31}$P and $^{59}$Co NMR\nmeasurements on the helical antiferromagnet EuCo$_2$P$_2$ with an AFM ordering\ntemperature $T_{\\rm N}$ = 66.5 K. An incommensurate helical AFM structure was\nclearly confirmed by $^{153}$Eu and $^{31}$P NMR spectra on single crystalline\nEuCo$_2$P$_2$ in zero magnetic field at 1.6 K and its external magnetic field\ndependence. Furthermore, based on $^{59}$Co NMR data in both the paramagnetic\nand the incommensurate AFM states, we have determined the model-independent\nvalue of the AFM propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.73 $\\pm$ 0.09)2$\\pi$/$c$ where\n$c$ is the $c$-axis lattice parameter. The temperature dependence of k is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present results from a three-dimensional Babcock--Leighton dynamo model\nthat is sustained by the explicit emergence and dispersal of bipolar magnetic\nregions (BMRs). On average, each BMR has a systematic tilt given by Joy's law.\nRandomness and nonlinearity in the BMR emergence of our model produce variable\nmagnetic cycles. However, when we allow for a random scatter in the tilt angle\nto mimic the observed departures from Joy's law, we find more variability in\nthe magnetic cycles. We find that the observed standard deviation in Joy's law\nof $\\sigma_\\delta = 15^\\circ$ produces a variability comparable to observed\nsolar cycle variability of $\\sim $ 32%, as quantified by the sunspot number\nmaxima between 1755--2008. We also find that tilt angle scatter can promote\ngrand minima and grand maxima. The time spent in grand minima for\n$\\sigma_\\delta = 15^\\circ$ is somewhat less than that inferred for the Sun from\ncosmogenic isotopes (about 9% compared to 17%). However, when we double the\ntilt scatter to $\\sigma_\\delta = 30^\\circ$, the simulation statistics are\ncomparable to the Sun ($\\sim $18% of the time in grand minima and $\\sim 10$% in\ngrand maxima). Though the Babcock--Leighton mechanism is the only source of\npoloidal field, we find that our simulations always maintain magnetic cycles\neven at large fluctuations in the tilt angle. We also demonstrate that tilt\nquenching is a viable and efficient mechanism for dynamo saturation; a\nsuppression of the tilt by only 1-2$^\\circ$ is sufficient to limit the dynamo\ngrowth. Thus, any potential observational signatures of tilt quenching in the\nSun may be subtle.\n", "  Lyapunov exponents characterize the chaotic nature of dynamical systems by\nquantifying the growth rate of uncertainty associated with the imperfect\nmeasurement of initial conditions. Finite-time estimates of the exponent,\nhowever, experience fluctuations due to both the initial condition and the\nstochastic nature of the dynamical path. The scale of these fluctuations is\ngoverned by the Lyapunov susceptibility, the finiteness of which typically\nprovides a sufficient condition for the law of large numbers to apply. Here, we\nobtain a formally exact expression for this susceptibility in terms of the\nRuelle dynamical zeta function for one-dimensional systems. We further show\nthat, for systems governed by sequences of random matrices, the cycle expansion\nof the zeta function enables systematic computations of the Lyapunov\nsusceptibility and of its higher-moment generalizations. The method is here\napplied to a class of dynamical models that maps to static disordered spin\nchains with interactions stretching over a varying distance, and is tested\nagainst Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  The recent article entitled \"Cosmological inviability of $f(R,T)$ gravity\"\n[Phys. Rev. D 95 (2017) 123536], by H. Velten and T.R.P. Caram\\^es, claims that\nthe reference \"A transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase of the\nuniverse expansion from the simplest non-trivial polynomial function of T in\nthe f(R,T) formalism\" by P.H.R.S. Moraes, G. Ribeiro and R.A.C. Correa\n[Astrophys. Space Sci. 361 (2016) 227] has \"problematic points\" concerning its\nmathematical approach and observable consequences. Velten and Caram\\^es argue\nthat the equation of the scale factor evolution in time in the $f(R,T)=R+\\alpha\nT+\\beta T^{2}$ cosmology was erroneously calculated. One crucial consequence of\nthe supposed corrected version of such an equation, presented by the authors in\n[Phys. Rev. D 95 (2017) 123536], would be the absence of the transition from a\ndecelerated to an accelerated phase of the expansion of the universe, an\noutcome originally predicted by Moraes, Ribeiro and Correa. We show that the\nabove claim is incorrect and that there are no inconsistencies with the results\nby Moraes, Ribeiro and Correa in the referred work. In particular, we show that\nVelten and Caram\\^es have incorrectly performed their calculations,\ninvalidating all their mathematical and physical criticism regarding the\narticle by Moraes, Ribeiro and Correa. In addition, we quote that the solutions\nobtained by Velten and Caram\\^es are unfeasible in view of their mathematical\nmisunderstanding.\n", "  We derive constraints on three-point functions involving the stress tensor,\n$T$, and a conserved $U(1)$ current, $j$, in 2+1 dimensional conformal field\ntheories that violate parity, using conformal collider bounds introduced by\nHofman and Maldacena. Conformal invariance allows parity-odd tensor-structures\nfor the $\\langle T T T \\rangle$ and $ \\langle j j T \\rangle$ correlation\nfunctions which are unique to three space-time dimensions. Let the parameters\nwhich determine the $\\langle T T T \\rangle$ correlation function be $t_4$ and\n$\\alpha_T$ , where $\\alpha_T$ is the parity-violating contribution. Similarly\nlet the parameters which determine $ \\langle j j T \\rangle$ correlation\nfunction be $a_2$, and $\\alpha_J$ , where $\\alpha_J$ is the parity-violating\ncontribution. We show that the parameters $(t_4, \\alpha_T)$ and $(a_2,\n\\alpha_J)$ are bounded to lie inside a disc at the origin of the $t_4$ -\n$\\alpha_T$ plane and the $a_2$ - $\\alpha_J$ plane respectively. We then show\nthat large $N$ Chern-Simons theories coupled to a fundamental fermion/boson lie\non the circle which bounds these discs. The `t Hooft coupling determines the\nlocation of these theories on the boundary circles.\n", "  In much of the literature on linearized gravitational waves two completely\ndifferent notions are called transverse traceless modes and labelled\n$h_{ab}^{TT}$, often in different sections of the same reference, without\nrealizing the underlying inconsistency. We compare and contrast the two notions\nand find that the difference persists even at leading asymptotic order near\nfuture null infinity $\\mathit{I}^+$. We discuss why the distinction has\nnonetheless remained largely unnoticed, and also point out that there are some\nimportant physical effects where only one of the notions gives the correct\nanswer.\n", "  Starting from the Gisin-Percival state diffusion equation for the pure state\ntrajectory of a composite bipartite quantum system and exploiting the\npurification of a mixed state via its Schmidt decomposition, we write the\ndiffusion equation for the quantum trajectory of the mixed state of a subsystem\n$S$ of the bipartite system, when the initial state in $S$ is mixed. Denoting\nthe diffused state of the system $S$ at time $t$ by $\\rho_t(\\mathbf{B})$ for\neach $t\\geq 0$, where $\\mathbf{B}$ is the underlying complex $n$-dimensional\nvector-valued Brownian motion process and using It{\\^o} calculus, along with an\ninduction procedure, we arrive at the stochastic differential of the\nscalar-valued moment process ${\\rm Tr}[\\rho_t^m( \\mathbf{B})], \\,\\,\\,\nm=2,3,\\ldots$ in terms of $d\\,\\mathbf{B}$ and $d\\,t$. This shows that each of\nthe processes $\\{{\\rm Tr}[\\rho_t^m( \\mathbf{B})], t\\geq 0\\}$ admits a\nDoob-Meyer decomposition as the sum of a martingale $M^{(m)}_t(\\mathbf{B})$ and\na non-negative increasing process $S^{(m)}_t(\\mathbf{B})$. This ensures the\nexistence of $\\underset{t\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\lim}\\, {\\rm Tr}[\\rho_t^m(\n\\mathbf{B})]$ almost surely with respect to the Wiener probability measure\n$\\mu$ of the Brownian motion $\\mathbf{B}$, for each $m=2,\\, 3,\\, \\ldots$. In\nparticular, when $S$ is a finite level system, the spectrum and therefore the\nentropy of $\\rho_t (\\mathbf{B})$ converge almost surely to a limit as\n$t\\rightarrow \\infty$. In the Appendix, by employing probabilistic means, we\nprove a technical result which implies the almost sure convergence of the\nspectrum for countably infinite level systems.\n", "  We show that there are six different choice of tensor product of\nsupersymmetric N=(1,1) spectral data in the context of supersymmetric quantum\ntheory and noncommutative geometry. We also show that the procedure of\nextending a supersymmetric N=1 spectral data to N=(1,1) spectral data respects\nonly one tensor product among these. We refer this as the multiplicativity\nproperty of the extension procedure. Therefore, if we demand that the extension\nprocedure is multiplicative then there is a unique choice of tensor product of\nN=(1,1) spectral data.\n", "  Starting with a quark model of nucleon structure in which the valence quarks\nare strongly correlated within a nucleon, the light nuclei are constructed by\nassuming similar correlations of the quarks of neighboring nucleons. Applying\nthe model to larger collections of nucleons reveals the emergence of the\nface-centered cubic (FCC) symmetry at the nuclear level. Nuclei with closed\nshells possess octahedral symmetry. Binding of nucleons are provided by quark\nloops formed by three and four nucleon correlations. Quark loops are\nresponsible for formation of exotic (borromean) nuclei, as well. The model\nunifies independent particle (shell) model, liquid-drop and cluster models.\n", "  We establish the gravitational detectability of a Dirac monopole using a\nweak-field limit of general relativity, which can be developed from the\nNewtonian gravitational potential by including energy as a source. The\nresulting potential matches (by construction) the weak-field limit of two\ndifferent solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity: one\nassociated with the magnetically monopolar spray of field lines emerging from\nthe half-infinite solenoid that makes up the Dirac monopole, the other\nassociated with the field-energetic source of the solenoid itself (the Dirac\nstring). The string's gravitational effect dominates, and we suggest that the\nprimary strong-field contribution of the Dirac configuration is that of a\nhalf-infinite line of energy, whose GR solution is known.\n", "  Whilst astronomy as a science is historically founded on observations at\noptical wavelengths, studying the Universe in other bands has yielded\nremarkable discoveries, from pulsars in the radio, signatures of the Big Bang\nat submm wavelengths, through to high energy emission from accreting,\ngravitationally-compact objects and the discovery of gamma-ray bursts.\nUnsurprisingly, the result of combining multiple wavebands leads to an enormous\nincrease in diagnostic power, but powerful insights can be lost when the\nsources studied vary on timescales shorter than the temporal separation between\nobservations in different bands. In July 2015, the workshop \"Paving the way to\nsimultaneous multi-wavelength astronomy\" was held as a concerted effort to\naddress this at the Lorentz Center, Leiden. It was attended by 50 astronomers\nfrom diverse fields as well as the directors and staff of observatories and\nspaced-based missions. This community white paper has been written with the\ngoal of disseminating the findings of that workshop by providing a concise\nreview of the field of multi-wavelength astronomy covering a wide range of\nimportant source classes, the problems associated with their study and the\nsolutions we believe need to be implemented for the future of observational\nastronomy. We hope that this paper will both stimulate further discussion and\nraise overall awareness within the community of the issues faced in a\ndeveloping, important field.\n", "  A new lease on life was given to ESA's International Gamma-ray Astrophysics\nLaboratory, because of its unique capability to identify electromagnetic\ncounterparts to sources of gravitational waves and ultra-high energy neutrinos.\n", "  PICARD is a scientific space mission dedicated to the study of the solar\nvariability origin. A French micro-satellite will carry an imaging telescope\nfor measuring the solar diameter, limb shape and solar oscillations, and two\nradiometers for measuring the total solar irradiance and the irradiance in five\nspectral domains, from ultraviolet to infrared. The mission is planed to be\nlaunched in 2009 for a 3-year duration. This article presents the PICARD\nPayload Data Centre, which role is to collect, process and distribute the\nPICARD data. The Payload Data Centre is a joint project between laboratories,\nspace agency and industries. The Belgian scientific policy office funds the\nindustrial development and future operations under the European Space Agency\nprogram. The development is achieved by the SPACEBEL Company. The Belgian\noperation centre is in charge of operating the PICARD Payload Data Centre. The\nFrench space agency leads the development in partnership with the French\nscientific research centre, which is responsible for providing all the\nscientific algorithms. The architecture of the PICARD Payload Data Centre\n(software and hardware) is presented. The software system is based on a Service\nOriented Architecture. The host structure is made up of the basic functions\nsuch as data management, task scheduling and system supervision including a\ngraphical interface used by the operator to interact with the system. The other\nfunctions are mission-specific: data exchange (acquisition, distribution), data\nprocessing (scientific and non-scientific processing) and managing the payload\n(programming, monitoring). The PICARD Payload Data Centre is planned to be\noperated for 5 years. All the data will be stored into a specific data centre\nafter this period.\n", "  The obscuring circumnuclear torus of dusty molecular gas is one of the major\ncomponents of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The torus can be studied by\nanalyzing the time response of its infrared (IR) dust emission to variations in\nthe AGN continuum luminosity, a technique known as reverberation mapping. The\nIR response is the convolution of the AGN ultraviolet/optical light curve with\na transfer function that contains information about the size, geometry, and\nstructure of the torus. Here, we describe a new computer model that simulates\nthe reverberation response of a clumpy torus. Given an input optical light\ncurve, the code computes the emission of a 3D ensemble of dust clouds as a\nfunction of time at selected IR wavelengths, taking into account light travel\ndelays. We present simulated dust emission responses at 3.6, 4.5, and 30 $\\mu$m\nthat explore the effects of various geometrical and structural properties, dust\ncloud orientation, and anisotropy of the illuminating radiation field. We also\nbriefly explore the effects of cloud shadowing (clouds are shielded from the\nAGN continuum source). Example synthetic light curves have also been generated,\nusing the observed optical light curve of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 6418 as the\ninput. The torus response is strongly wavelength-dependent, due to the gradient\nin cloud surface temperature within the torus, and because the cloud emission\nis strongly anisotropic at shorter wavelengths. Anisotropic illumination of the\ntorus also significantly modifies the torus response, reducing the lag between\nthe IR and optical variations.\n", "  We calculate the star formation quenching timescales in green valley galaxies\nat intermediate redshifts ($z\\sim0.5-1$) using stacked zCOSMOS spectra of\ndifferent galaxy morphological types: spheroidal, disk-like, irregular and\nmerger, dividing disk-like galaxies further into unbarred, weakly-barred and\nstrongly-barred, assuming a simple exponentially-decaying star formation\nhistory model and based on the H$_{\\delta}$ absorption feature and the $4000$\n\\AA ~break. We find that different morphological types present different star\nformation quenching timescales, reinforcing the idea that the galaxy morphology\nis strongly correlated with the physical processes responsible for quenching\nstar formation. Our quantification of the star formation quenching timescale\nindicates that disks have typical timescales $60\\%$ to 5 times longer than that\nof galaxies presenting spheroidal, irregular or merger morphologies. Barred\ngalaxies in particular present the slowest transition timescales through the\ngreen valley. This suggests that although secular evolution may ultimately lead\nto gas exhaustion in the host galaxy via bar-induced gas inflows that trigger\nstar formation activity, secular agents are not major contributors in the rapid\nquenching of galaxies at these redshifts. Galaxy interaction, associated with\nthe elliptical, irregular and merger morphologies contribute, to a more\nsignificant degree, to the fast transition through the green valley at these\nredshifts. In the light of previous works suggesting that both secular and\nmerger processes are responsible for the star formation quenching at low\nredshifts, our results provide an explanation to the recent findings that star\nformation quenching happened at a faster pace at $z\\sim0.8$.\n", "  We report on the existence and stability of freely moving solitons in a\nspatially inhomogeneous Bose- Einstein condensate with helicoidal spin-orbit\n(SO) coupling. In spite of the periodically varying parameters, the system\nallows for the existence of stable propagating solitons. Such states are found\nin the rotating frame, where the helicoidal SO coupling is reduced to a\nhomogeneous one. In the absence of the Zeeman splitting, the coupled\nGross-Pitaevskii equations describing localized states feature many properties\nof the integrable systems. In particular, four-parametric families of solitons\ncan be obtained in the exact form. Such solitons interact elastically. Zeeman\nsplitting still allows for the existence of two families of moving solitons,\nbut makes collisions of solitons inelastic.\n", "  The arXiv is the most popular preprint repository in the world. Since its\ninception in 1991, the arXiv has allowed researchers to freely share\npublication-ready articles prior to formal peer review. The growth and the\npopularity of the arXiv emerged as a result of new technologies that made\ndocument creation and dissemination easy, and cultural practices where\ncollaboration and data sharing were dominant. The arXiv represents a unique\nplace in the history of research communication and the Web itself, however it\nhas arguably changed very little since its creation. Here we look at the\nstrengths and weaknesses of arXiv in an effort to identify what possible\nimprovements can be made based on new technologies not previously available.\nBased on this, we argue that a modern arXiv might in fact not look at all like\nthe arXiv of today.\n", "  Single-photon and correlated two-photon sources are important elements for\noptical information systems. Nonlinear downconversion light sources are robust\nand stable emitters of single photons and entangled photon pairs. However, the\nrate of downconverted light emission, dictated by the properties of\nlow-symmetry nonlinear crystals, is typically very small, leading to\nsignificant constrains in device design and integration. In this paper, we show\nthat the principles for spontaneous emission control (i.e. Purcell effect) of\nisolated emitters in nanoscale structures, such as metamaterials, can be\ngeneralized to describe the enhancement of nonlinear light generation processes\nsuch as parametric down conversion. We develop a novel theoretical framework\nfor quantum nonlinear emission in a general anisotropic, dispersive and lossy\nmedia. We further find that spontaneous parametric downconversion in media with\nhyperbolic dispersion is broadband and phase-mismatch-free. We predict a\n1000-fold enhancement of the downconverted emission rate with up to 105 photon\npairs per second in experimentally realistic nanostructures. Our theoretical\nformalism and approach to Purcell enhancement of nonlinear optical processes,\nprovides a framework for description of quantum nonlinear optical phenomena in\ncomplex nanophotonic structures.\n", "  We present a brief, observational review about the study of the cooling\nbehaviour of accretion-heated neutron stars and the inferences about the\nneutron-star crust and core that have been obtained from these studies.\nAccretion of matter during outbursts can heat the crust out of thermal\nequilibrium with the core and after the accretion episodes are over, the crust\nwill cool down until crust-core equilibrium is restored. We discuss the\nobserved properties of the crust cooling sources and what has been learned\nabout the physics of neutron-star crusts. We also briefly discuss those systems\nthat have been observed long after their outbursts were over, i.e, during times\nwhen the crust and core are expected to be in thermal equilibrium. The surface\ntemperature is then a direct probe for the core temperature. By comparing the\nexpected temperatures based on estimates of the accretion history of the\ntargets with the observed ones, the physics of neutron-star cores can be\ninvestigated. Finally, we discuss similar studies performed for strongly\nmagnetized neutron stars in which the magnetic field might play an important\nrole in the heating and cooling of the neutron stars.\n", "  We obtain the superfluid transition temperature of equal Rashba-Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit and Rabi coupled Fermi superfluids, from the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) regimes in\nthree dimensions. Spin-orbit coupling enhances the critical temperature in the\nBEC limit, and can convert a first order phase transition in the presence of\nRabi coupling into second order, as a function of the Rabi coupling for fixed\ninteractions. We derive the Ginzburg-Landau equation to sixth power in the\nsuperfluid order parameter to describe both first and second order transitions\nas a function of spin-orbit and Rabi couplings.\n", "  ALMA will sustain its transformational science through 2030 via an aggressive\nseries of upgrades, for which an overview is provided.\n", "  The extraction bucket position in the Fermilab Booster is controlled with a\ncogging process that involves the comparison of the Booster RF count and the\nRecycler Ring revolution marker. A one RF bucket jitter in the extraction\nbucket position results from the variability of the process that phase matches\nthe Booster to the Recycler. However, the new slow phase lock process used to\nlock the frequency and phase of the Booster RF to the Recycler RF has been made\ndigital and programmable and has been modified to correct the extraction notch\nposition. The beam loss at the Recycler injection has been reduced by 20%. Beam\nstudies and the phase lock system will be discussed in this paper.\n", "  In the quest to develop spintronic logic, it was discovered that\nmagnetoelectric switching results in lower energy and shorter switching time\nthan other mechanisms. Magnetoelectric (ME) field due to exchange bias at the\ninterface with a multi-ferroic (such as BiFeO3) is well suited for 180 degree\nswitching of magnetization. The ME field is determined by the direction of\ncanted magnetization in BiFeO3 which can point at an angle to the plane, to\nwhich voltage is applied. Dependence of switching time and the threshold of ME\nfield on its angles was determined by micromagnetic simulations. Switching\noccurs by formation of a domain wall on the side of the nanomagnet on top of\nBFO and its propagation to the rest of the magnet. For in-plane magnetization,\nswitching occurs over a wide range of angles and at all magnitudes of ME field\nabove threshold. For out-of-plane magnetization failure occurs (with an\nexception of a narrow range of angles and magnitudes of ME field) due to the\ndomain wall reflecting from the opposite end of the nanomagnet.\n", "  A second harmonic tunable RF cavity is being developed for the Fermilab\nBooster. This device, which promises reduction of the particle beam loss at the\ninjection, transition, and extraction stages, employs perpendicularly biased\ngarnet material for frequency tuning. The required range of the tuning is\nsignificantly wider than in previously built and tested tunable RF devices. As\na result, the magnetic field in the garnet comes fairly close to the\ngyromagnetic resonance line at the lower end of the frequency range. The chosen\ndesign concept of a tuner for the cavity cannot ensure uniform magnetic field\nin the garnet material; thus, it is important to know the static magnetic\nproperties of the material to avoid significant increase in the local RF loss\npower density. This report summarizes studies performed at Fermilab to\nunderstand variations in the magnetic properties of the AL800 garnet material\nused to build the tuner of the cavity.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a low-noise, bandwidth tunable microwave photonics\nfilter (MPF) based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) losses. By\nsuppressing the out-of-band signal with two broadened symmetric SBS losses,\npass bandwidth can be tuned from 500 MHz to 10 GHz. Considering the limited\ninteraction in the center frequency range, a flat-top response with 0.3 dB\nripple is easily achieved. Unlike a SBS gain based filter, due to the\ntransparency of the pass band in our proposed filter, hardly no noise is\ndetected in a noise measurement against an obvious maximum 5 dB noise pedestal\nfor a SBS gain based one. Considering the wide independent bandwidth and center\nfrequency tunability, flat-top response, and low-noise characteristic, our\nproposed filter can be perfectly used as a supplement of most commericalized\ntunable single bandpass filters, whose minimum bandwidth is limited by 10 GHz.\n", "  In this paper, we are discussing the effect of the use of magnetic compasses\non the orientation of ancient Chinese architectonical complexes. As Czech\nresearchers proposed in 2011, assuming these complexes ideally oriented by the\nancient architects along north-south direction, in the case that the surveys\nwere made by means of magnetic compasses, we can find the axes of the complexes\ndeviating from the cardinal direction, according to the local magnetic\ndeclination that existed at the time the structures were built. Following this\nidea, here we discuss some examples of possible alignments obtained by means of\nmagnetic compasses, concluding that the Chinese surveyors adopted, during the\nMing dynasty, a method based on the magnetic compasses. The architects of the\nantecedent Yuan Dynasty probably used an astronomical method.\n", "  Interaction of nonrelativistic electrons with a standing electromagnetic wave\nis considered. The modulation amplitude of an electron current in the field of\na standing or traveling electromagnetic wave is calculated in the quantum\napproach.\n", "  The variation problem associated with the solution of Dirac's relativistic\nelectron equation is reviewed here. Derivation of the min-max theorem is\ndiscussed. A new observation is that the spurious roots of negative energy\nsatisfy a max-min theorem. The min-max principle (MMP) for solution of Dirac\nequation, extendable to the Dirac-Fock case, is concisely reviewed. MMP for\ntwo-electron Dirac-Coulomb equation is discussed. The min-max theorem is\nphysically interpreted for both Dirac and Dirac-Coulomb problems. Applications\nof MMP are collated in tables. Associated theoretical and computational\ndevelopments are outlined. Limitations of MMP are spelt out and recent\nmathematical developments are discussed.\n", "  We critically analyse the point of view for which laws of nature are just a\nmean to compress data. Discussing some basic notions of dynamical systems and\ninformation theory, we show that the idea that the analysis of large amount of\ndata by means of an algorithm of compression is equivalent to the knowledge one\ncan have from scientific laws, is rather naive. In particular we discuss the\nsubtle conceptual topic of the initial conditions of phenomena which are\ngenerally incompressible. Starting from this point, we argue that laws of\nnature represent more than a pure compression of data, and that the\navailability of large amount of data, in general, is not particularly useful to\nunderstand the behaviour of complex phenomena.\n", "  The Standard Model of particle physics was established based on the\nequivalence principle and gauge invariance. The Lagrangians were built upon\nexperimental data demonstrating the violation of discrete symmetries together\nwith ideas of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The features of vector and\naxial-vector interactions and chirality principle are manually added on in\norder to fit in the observation data, rather than explained by the model as one\nmay hope. Here we develop a theory of interactions based on the Dirac algebra\ntogether with the exterior operations the wedge product and the star operator\non the space-time, and develop a scheme for determining all possible\ninteraction formulations. In our scheme, the chirality transformation and the\nleft and right handedness come up naturally. A simple postulate about the\nuniversality of physical interactions based on the space-time causal structure\nyields the attracting features mentioned above as consequences.\n", "  Relativistic iron K$\\alpha$ spectral emission line from the inner disc of a\nneutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) was first detected in 2007. This\ndiscovery opened up new ways to probe strong gravity and dense matter. The past\ndecade has seen detections of such a line from many neutron star LMXBs, and\nconfirmation of this line from the same source with several X-ray satellites.\nThese have firmly established the new field of relativistic disc line from\nneutron star systems in only ten years. Fitting the shape of such a line with\nan appropriate general relativistic model provides the accretion disc inner\nedge radius to the stellar mass ratio. In this review, we briefly discuss how\nan accurate measurement of this ratio with a future larger area X-ray\ninstrument can be used to constrain neutron star equation of state models.\n", "  A Global Enhanced Vibrational Kinetic (GEVKM) model is presented for a new\nHigh Current Negative Hydrogen Ion Source (HCNHIS) developed by Busek Co. Inc.\nand Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The HCNHIS consists of a high-pressure\nradio-frequency discharge (RFD) chamber where high-lying vibrational states of\nthe hydrogen molecules are produced, a bypass system, a nozzle, and a\nlow-pressure negative hydrogen ion production region where $\\text{H}^-$ are\ngenerated by the dissociative attachment of low energy electrons to\nrovibrationally excited hydrogen molecules. The GEVKM is developed from moment\nequations for multi-temperature chemically reacting plasmas derived from the\nWang Chang-Uhlenbeck equations for a cylindrical geometry of an inductively\ncoupled RFD chamber. The species included into the model are $\\text{H}(n),\nn=0-3, \\text{H}_2(v), v=0-14, \\text{H}^+, \\text{H}_2^+, \\text{H}_3^+,\n\\text{H}^-$, and $e$. The volume-averaged steady-state continuity equations\ncoupled with the electron energy equation, the total energy equation and heat\ntransfer to the chamber walls are solved simultaneously to obtain the\nvolume-averaged number densities of the plasma components, the electron,\nheavy-particle and wall temperatures. The GEVKM is supplemented by a\ncomprehensive set of surface and volumetric chemical processes governing\nvibrational and ionization kinetics of hydrogen plasmas. Analytic boundary\nconditions developed for the flow in the bypass tubes and in the nozzle take\ninto account rarefaction effects and are validated by comparing pressures\npredictions in the RFD chamber with the pressure measurements. The GEVKM is\nverified and validated in the wide range of pressures and absorbed powers of\ndifferent plasma reactors and is used in a parametric investigation of the RFD\nchamber of the HCNHIS with hydrogen inlet flow rates 5-1000 sccm and absorbed\npowers 200-1000 W.\n", "  In the same way that seismologists study the interior of the earth from the\nwaves generated by earthquakes, heliosismology is the science that is\ninterested in the study of oscillatory waves inside the Sun. Temperature,\nchemical composition, rotational velocities at different depths are all factors\nthat influence the oscillation frequencies of the waves trapped inside the Sun.\nThe observation and measurement of the frequencies (or velocities) of\noscillations of the principal modes on the surface of the Sun allow us to study\nthe internal properties of the star. In our study, we use a local helioseismic\nmethod, called \"Time-Distance\"; the latter, after appropriate treatment\n(remapping, tracking, and filtering) of the data, which carried out from the\nGONG (Global Oscillation Network Group) observation network, allows us to\ndeduce, by correlation of the observed signals, the relationship between the\ntime of the wave path and its crossed distance (hence the name of the method)\nbetween different points on the surface as a function of the different solar\nsub-surface parameters, via the dispersion relation. Once the travel times have\nbeen established by approximation of the correlation function by a Gaussian\nwave packet and based on the Fermat principle dealing with acoustic waves, we\nfind the relationship between these times and the internal parameters of the\ncrossed medium. Two models are considered in this study. The first does not\ninclude the effects of the magnetic field and takes into account the flow\nvelocity and the sound speed. The second, on the other hand, includes the\nmagnetic effects, by means of the Alfven velocity (magnetic field perturbation\nvelocity), in addition to the parameters mentioned above. The last part of this\npaper was devoted to the inversion of the obtained times, which allows us to go\nback to the solar internal parameters.\n", "  Large area surveys will dominate the forthcoming decades of astronomy and\ntheir success requires characterizing thousands of discoveries through\nadditional observations at higher spatial or spectral resolution, and at\ncomplementary cadences or periods. Only the full automation of adaptive optics\nsystems will enable high-acuity, high-sensitivity follow-up observations of\nseveral tens of thousands of these objects per year, maximizing on-sky time.\nAutomation will also enable rapid response to target-of-opportunity events\nwithin minutes, minimizing the time between discovery and characterization.\n  In June 2012, we demonstrated the first fully automated operation of an\nastronomical adaptive optics system by observing 125 objects in succession with\nthe Robo-AO system. Efficiency has increased ever since, with a typical night\ncomprising 200-250 automated observations at the visible diffraction limit. By\nobserving tens of thousands of targets in the largest-ever adaptive-optics\nsurveys, Robo-AO has demonstrated the ability to address the follow-up needs of\ncurrent and future large astronomical surveys.\n", "  In these proceedings we use recent LHC heavy-ion data to set a limit on\naxion-like particles coupling to electromagnetism with mass in the range 10-100\nGeV. We recast ATLAS data as per the strategy proposed in 1607.06083, and find\nresults in-line with the projections given there.\n", "  The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem plays a fundamental role in density functional\ntheory, which has become a basic tool for the study of electronic structure of\nmatter. In this article, we study the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for a class of\nexternal potentials based on a unique continuation principle.\n", "  The sea quark contribution to the nucleon spin is an important piece for a\ncomplete understanding of the nucleon spin structure. The production of W\nbosons in longitudinally polarized $p + p$ collisions at RHIC provides an\nunique probe for the sea quark polarization, through the parity-violating\nsingle-spin asymmetry, $A_L$. At the STAR experiment, W bosons through the\nleptonic decay channel $W \\to e \\nu $ can be effectively determined with the\nElectromagnetic Calorimeters and Time Projection Chamber at mid-rapidity. The\nprevious STAR measurements of $A_L$ for W boson production from datasets taken\nin 2011 and 2012, have provided significant constraints on the helicity\ndistribution functions of $\\bar u$ and $\\bar d$ quarks. In 2013 the STAR\nexperiment collected $p+p$ data with an integrated luminosity of about 300\npb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt s$ = 510 GeV with an average beam polarization of about\n$56\\%$, which is more than three times larger than the total integrated\nluminosity of previous years. The preliminary results of W-boson $A_L$ from\n2013 data sample will be presented.\n", "  Current-induced magnetization switching through spin-orbit torques (SOTs) is\nthe fundamental building block of spin-orbitronics. The SOTs generally arise\nfrom the spin-orbit coupling of heavy metals. However, even in a\nheterostructure where a metallic magnet is sandwiched by two different\ninsulators, a nonzero current-induced SOT is expected because of the broken\ninversion symmetry; an electrical insulator can be a spin-torque generator.\nHere, we demonstrate current-induced magnetization switching using an\ninsulator. We show that oxygen incorporation into the most widely used\nspintronic material, Pt, turns the heavy metal into an electrically-insulating\ngenerator of the SOTs, enabling the electrical switching of perpendicular\nmagnetization in a ferrimagnet sandwiched by electrically-insulating oxides. We\nfurther found that the SOTs generated from the Pt oxide can be controlled\nelectrically through voltage-driven oxygen migration. These findings open a\nroute towards energy-efficient, voltage-programmable spin-orbit devices based\non solid-state switching of heavy metal oxidation.\n", "  The linear canonical transform (LCT) was extended to complex-valued\nparameters, called complex LCT, to describe the complex amplitude propagation\nthrough lossy or lossless optical systems. Bargmann transform is a special case\nof the complex LCT. In this paper, we normalize the Bargmann transform such\nthat it can be bounded near infinity. We derive the relationships of the\nnormalized Bargmann transform to Gabor transform, Hermite-Gaussian functions,\ngyrator transform, and 2D nonseparable LCT. Several kinds of fast and accurate\ncomputational methods of the normalized Bargmann transform and its inverse are\nproposed based on these relationships.\n", "  Non-fullerene acceptors based on perylenediimides (PDIs) have garnered\nsignificant interest as an alternative to fullerene acceptors in organic\nphotovoltaics (OPVs), but their charge transport phenomena are not well\nunderstood, especially in bulk heterojunctions (BHJs). Here, we investigate\ncharge transport and current fluctuations by performing correlated\nlow-frequency noise and impedance spectroscopy measurements on two BHJ OPV\nsystems, one employing a fullerene acceptor and the other employing a dimeric\nPDI acceptor. In the dark, these measurements reveal that PDI-based OPVs have a\ngreater degree of recombination in comparison to fullerene-based OPVs.\nFurthermore, for the first time in organic solar cells, 1/f noise data are fit\nto the Kleinpenning model to reveal underlying current fluctuations in\ndifferent transport regimes. Under illumination, 1/f noise increases by\napproximately four orders of magnitude for the fullerene-based OPVs and three\norders of magnitude for the PDI-based OPVs. An inverse correlation is also\nobserved between noise spectral density and power conversion efficiency.\nOverall, these results show that low-frequency noise spectroscopy is an\neffective in-situ diagnostic tool to assess charge transport in emerging\nphotovoltaic materials, thereby providing quantitative guidance for the design\nof next-generation solar cell materials and technologies.\n", "  The tacnode process is a universal behavior arising in nonintersecting\nparticle systems and tiling problems. For Dyson Brownian bridges, the tacnode\nprocess describes the grazing collision of two packets of walkers. We consider\nsuch a Dyson sea on the unit circle with drift. For any integer k, we show that\nan appropriate double scaling of the drift and return time leads to a\ngeneralization of the tacnode process in which k particles are expected to wrap\naround the circle. We derive winding number probabilities and an expression for\nthe correlation kernel in terms of functions related to the generalized\nHastings-McLeod solutions to the inhomogeneous Painleve-II equation. The method\nof proof is asymptotic analysis of discrete orthogonal polynomials with a\ncomplex weight.\n", "  Magnetic fields in rotating and radiating astrophysical plasma can be\nproduced due to a radiative interaction between plasma layers moving relative\nto each other. The efficiency of current drive, and with it the associated\ndynamo effect, is considered in a number of limits. It is shown here, however,\nthat predictions for these generated magnetic fields can be significantly\nhigher when kinetic effects, previously neglected, are taken into account.\n", "  We show that deliberately engineered dispersive metamaterial slab can enable\nthe co-existence and phase matching of contra-propagating ordinary fundamental\nand extraordinary backward second harmonic surface electromagnetic modes.\nEnergy flux and phase velocity are contra-directed in the backward waves which\nis the phenomenon that gives rise to unique nonlinear optical propagation\nprocesses. We show that frequencies, phase, and group velocities, as well as\nnanowaveguide losses inherent to the electromagnetic modes supported by such\nmetamaterial, can be tailored to maximize conversion of frequencies and to\nreverse propagation direction of the generated wave. Such a possibility, which\nis of paramount importance for nonlinear photonics, is proved with a numerical\nmodel of the hyperbolic metamaterial made of carbon nanotubes standing on the\nmetal surface. Extraordinary properties of the backward-wave second harmonic\ngeneration in the reflection direction and of the corresponding frequency\ndoubling metareflector in the THz are investigated with a focus on the pulsed\nregime.\n", "  We study, using direct numerical simulations, the effect of geometrical\nconfinement on heat transport and flow structure in Rayleigh-B\\'enard\nconvection in fluids with different Prandtl numbers. Our simulations span over\ntwo decades of Prandtl number $Pr$, $0.1 \\leq Pr \\leq 40$, with the Rayleigh\nnumber $Ra$ fixed at $10^8$. The width-to-height aspect ratio $\\Gamma$ spans\nbetween $0.025$ and $0.25$ while the length-to-height aspect ratio is fixed at\none. We first find that for $Pr \\geq 0.5$, geometrical confinement can lead to\na significant enhancement in heat transport as characterized by the Nusselt\nnumber $Nu$. For those cases, $Nu$ is maximal at a certain $\\Gamma =\n\\Gamma_{opt}$. It is found that $\\Gamma_{opt}$ exhibits a power-law relation\nwith $Pr$ as $\\Gamma_{opt}=0.11Pr^{-0.06}$, and the maximal relative\nenhancement generally increases with $Pr$ over the explored parameter range. As\nopposed to the situation of $Pr \\geq 0.5$, confinement-induced enhancement in\n$Nu$ is not realized for smaller values of $Pr$, such as $0.1$ and $0.2$. The\n$Pr$ dependence of the heat transport enhancement can be understood in its\nrelation to the coverage area of the thermal plumes over the thermal boundary\nlayer (BL) where larger coverage is observed for larger $Pr$ due to a smaller\nthermal diffusivity. We further show that $\\Gamma_{opt}$ is closely related to\nthe crossing of thermal and momentum BLs, and find that $Nu$ declines sharply\nwhen the thickness ratio of the thermal and momentum BLs exceeds a certain\nvalue of about one. In addition, through examining the temporally averaged flow\nfields and 2D mode decomposition, it is found that for smaller $Pr$ the\nlarge-scale circulation is robust against the geometrical confinement of the\nconvection cell.\n", "  This article presents a brief description of India's AstroSat mission which\nis a powerful space based observatory for compact star research. An account is\ngiven of observational constraints and spectral and timing capabilities as\nrealised post-launch. Some preliminary results of observations of the Crab\npulsar and an X-ray binary system GX~301-2 are presented to illustrate some of\nthe capabilities of the mission.\n", "  We studied the Ehrenfest urn model in which particles in the same urn\ninteract with each other. Depending on the nature of interaction, the system\nundergoes a first-order or second-order phase transition. The relaxation time\nto the equilibrium state, the Poincare cycles of the equilibrium state and the\nmost far-from-equilibrium state, and the duration time of the states during\nfirst-order phase transition are calculated. It was shown that the scaling\nbehavior of the Poincare cycles could be served as an indication to the nature\nof phase transition, and the ratio of duration time of the states could be a\nstrong evidence of the metastability during first-order phase transition.\n", "  This review arose from the European Radio Astronomy Technical Forum (ERATec)\nmeeting held in Firenze, October 2015, and aims to highlight the breadth and\ndepth of the high-impact science that will be aided and assisted by the use of\nsimultaneous mm-wavelength receivers. Recent results and opportunities are\npresented and discussed from the fields of: continuum VLBI (observations of\nweak sources, astrometry, observations of AGN cores in spectral index and\nFaraday rotation), spectral line VLBI (observations of evolved stars and\nmassive star-forming regions) and time domain observations of the flux\nvariations arising in the compact jets of X-ray binaries. Our survey brings\ntogether a large range of important science applications, which will greatly\nbenefit from simultaneous observing at mm-wavelengths. Such facilities are\nessential to allow these applications to become more efficient, more sensitive\nand more scientifically robust. In some cases without simultaneous receivers\nthe science goals are simply unachievable. Similar benefits would exist in many\nother high frequency astronomical fields of research.\n", "  Structural, elastic, electronic and optical properties of laves phase\nintermetallic compounds CaRh2 and LaRh2 prototype with MgCu2 are investigated\nby using the first principle calculations. These calculations stand on density\nfunctional theory (DFT) from CASTEP code. The calculated lattice parameters are\nconsistent with the experimental values. The significant elastic properties,\nlike as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Youngs modulus and the Poissons ratio are\ndetermined by applying the Voigt Reuss Hill (VRH) approximation. The analysis\nof Pughs ratio shows the ductile nature of both the phases. Metallic\nconductivity is observed for both the compounds. Most of the contribution\noriginates from Rh 4d states at Fermi level in DOS. The study of bonding\ncharacteristics reveals the existence of ionic and metallic bonds in both\nintermetallics. The study of optical properties indicates that maximum\nreflectivity occurs in low energy region implying the characteristics of high\nconductance of both the phases. Absorption quality of both the phases is good\nin the visible region.\n", "  The principle of optical trapping is conventionally based on the interaction\nof optical fields with linear induced polarizations. However, the optical force\noriginating from the nonlinear polarization becomes significant when nonlinear\noptical nanoparticles are trapped by ultrafast laser pulses. Herein we\nestablish the time-averaged optical forces on a nonlinear optical nanoparticle\nusing high-repetition-rate ultrafast laser pulses, based on the linear and\nnonlinear polarization effects. We investigate the dependence of the optical\nforces on the magnitudes and signs of the refractive nonlinearities. It is\nfound that the self-focusing effect enhances the trapping ability, whereas the\nself-defocusing effect leads to the splitting of potential well at the focal\nplane and destabilizes the optical trap. Our results show good agreement with\nthe reported experimental observations and provide a theoretical support for\ncapturing nonlinear optical particles.\n", "  It is a common perception that the transport of a spin current in\npolycrystalline metal is isotropic and independent of the polarization\ndirection, even though spin current is a tensorlike quantity and its\npolarization direction is a key variable. We demonstrate surprising anisotropic\nspin relaxation in mesoscopic polycrystalline Cu channels in nonlocal spin\nvalves. For directions in the substrate plane, the spin-relaxation length is\nlonger for spins parallel to the Cu channel than for spins perpendicular to it,\nby as much as 9% at 10 K. Spin-orbit effects on the surfaces of Cu channels can\naccount for this anisotropic spin relaxation. The finding suggests novel\ntunability of spin current, not only by its polarization direction but also by\nelectrostatic gating.\n", "  Oxygen vacancies, especially their distribution, are directly coupled to the\nelectromagnetic properties of oxides and related emergent functionalities that\nhave implication in device applications. Here using a homoepitaxial strontium\ntitanate thin film, we demonstrate a controlled manipulation of the oxygen\nvacancy distribution using the mechanical force from a scanning probe\nmicroscope tip. By combining Kelvin probe force microscopy imaging and\nphase-field simulations, we show that oxygen vacancies can move under a\nstress-gradient-induced depolarisation field. When tailored, this nanoscale\nflexoelectric effect enables a controlled spatial modulation. In motion, the\nscanning probe tip thereby deterministically reconfigures the spatial\ndistribution of vacancies. The ability to locally manipulate oxygen vacancies\non-demand provides a tool for the exploration of mesoscale quantum phenomena,\nand engineering multifunctional oxide devices.\n", "  With exactly forty years since the discovery of the first cyclotron line in\nHer X-1, there have been remarkable advancements in the field related to study\nof the physics of accreting neutron stars -- cyclotron lines have been a major\ntorchbearer in this regard, from being the only direct estimator of the\nmagnetic field strength, a tracer of accretion geometry and an indicator of the\nemission beam in these systems. The main flurry of activities have centred\naround studying the harmonic separations, luminosity dependence, pulse phase\ndependence and more recently the shapes of the line and the trend for long term\nevolution in the line energy. This article visits the important results related\nto cyclotron lines since its discovery and reviews their significance. An\nemphasis is laid on pulse phase resolved spectroscopy and the important clues a\njoint timing and spectral study in this context can provide, to build a\ncomplete picture for the physics of accretion and hence X-ray emission in\naccreting neutron stars.\n", "  Neutron stars involve extreme physics which is difficult (perhaps impossible)\nto explore in laboratory experiments. We have to turn to astrophysical\nobservations, and try to extract information from the entire range of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. In addition, neutron stars may radiate gravitational\nwaves through a range of scenarios. In this brief summary I outline some of the\nmain ideas, focussing on what we do and do not know, and describe the\nchallenges involved in trying to catch these faint whispers from the very edge\nof physics.\n", "  Deep learning algorithms offer a powerful means to automatically analyze the\ncontent of medical images. However, many biological samples of interest are\nprimarily transparent to visible light and contain features that are difficult\nto resolve with a standard optical microscope. Here, we use a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) not only to classify images, but also to optimize the\nphysical layout of the imaging device itself. We increase the classification\naccuracy of a microscope's recorded images by merging an optical model of image\nformation into the pipeline of a CNN. The resulting network simultaneously\ndetermines an ideal illumination arrangement to highlight important sample\nfeatures during image acquisition, along with a set of convolutional weights to\nclassify the detected images post-capture. We demonstrate our joint\noptimization technique with an experimental microscope configuration that\nautomatically identifies malaria-infected cells with 5-10% higher accuracy than\nstandard and alternative microscope lighting designs.\n", "  Observations obtained in the last years challenged the widespread notion that\nrotation-powered neutron stars are steady X-ray emitters. Besides a few\nallegedly rotation-powered neutron stars that showed \"magnetar-like\"\nvariability, a particularly interesting case is that of PSR B0943+10. Recent\nobservations have shown that this pulsar, well studied in the radio band where\nit alternates between a bright and a quiescent mode, displays significant X-ray\nvariations, anticorrelated in flux with the radio emission. The study of such\nsynchronous radio/X-ray mode switching opens a new window to investigate the\nprocesses responsible for the pulsar radio and high-energy emission. Here we\nreview the main X-ray properties of PSR B0943+10 derived from recent\ncoordinated X-ray and radio observations.\n", "  Light scattered from multiple surfaces can be used to retrieve information of\nhidden environments. However, full three-dimensional retrieval of an object\nhidden from view by a wall has only been achieved with scanning systems and\nrequires intensive computational processing of the retrieved data. Here we use\na non-scanning, single-photon single-pixel detector in combination with an\nartificial neural network: this allows us to locate the position and to also\nsimultaneously provide the actual identity of a hidden person, chosen from a\ndatabase of people (N=3). Artificial neural networks applied to specific\ncomputational imaging problems can therefore enable novel imaging capabilities\nwith hugely simplified hardware and processing times\n", "  The strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s(M_Z)$ is determined from inclusive jet\nand dijet cross sections in neutral-current deep-inelastic $ep$ scattering\n(DIS) measured at HERA by the H1 collaboration using next-to-next-to-leading\norder (NNLO) QCD predictions. The dependence of the NNLO predictions and of the\nresulting value of $\\alpha_s(M_Z)$ at the $Z$-boson mass $m_Z$ are studied as a\nfunction of the choice of the renormalisation and factorisation scales. Using\ninclusive jet and dijet data together, the strong coupling constant is\ndetermined to be $\\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1157\\,(20)_{\\rm exp}\\,(29)_{\\rm th}$.\nComplementary, \\asmz\\ is determined together with parton distribution functions\nof the proton (PDFs) from jet and inclusive DIS data measured by the H1\nexperiment. The value $\\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1142\\,(28)_{\\rm tot}$ obtained is\nconsistent with the determination from jet data alone. The impact of the jet\ndata on the PDFs is studied. The running of the strong coupling is tested at\ndifferent values of the renormalisation scale and the results are found to be\nin agreement with expectations.\n", "  Modularity for multilayer networks, also called multislice modularity, is\nparametric to a resolution factor and an inter-layer coupling factor. The\nformer is useful to express layer-specific relevance and the latter quantifies\nthe strength of node linkage across the layers of a network. However, such\nparameters can be set arbitrarily, thus discarding any structure information at\ngraph or community level. Other issues are related to the inability of properly\nmodeling order relations over the layers, which is required for dynamic\nnetworks.\n  In this paper we propose a new definition of modularity for multilayer\nnetworks that aims to overcome major issues of existing multislice modularity.\nWe revise the role and semantics of the layer-specific resolution and\ninter-layer coupling terms, and define parameter-free unsupervised approaches\nfor their computation, by using information from the within-layer and\ninter-layer structures of the communities. Moreover, our formulation of\nmultilayer modularity is general enough to account for an available ordering of\nthe layers and relating constraints on layer coupling. Experimental evaluation\nwas conducted using three state-of-the-art methods for multilayer community\ndetection and nine real-world multilayer networks. Results have shown the\nsignificance of our modularity, disclosing the effects of different\ncombinations of the resolution and inter-layer coupling functions. This work\ncan pave the way for the development of new optimization methods for\ndiscovering community structures in multilayer networks.\n", "  Given a spacetime with nonvanishing torsion, we discuss the equation for the\nevolution of the separation vector between infinitesimally close curves in a\ncongruence. We show that the presence of a torsion field leads, in general, to\ntangent and orthogonal effects on the congruence; in particular, the presence\nof a completely generic torsion field contributes to a relative acceleration\nbetween test particles. We derive, for the first time in the literature, the\nRaychaudhuri equation for a congruence of timelike and null curves in a\nspacetime with the most generic torsion field.\n", "  Dispersion problem has always constrained the development of see-through\nnear-eye displays with diffractive waveguide. Here, we propose a design method\nand optical systems for achromatic surface microstructure composed with a\ntriple-carved-sub-grating. The triple-carved-sub-grating with specified period\nis designed based on rigorous coupled wave theory, corresponding to Red, Green\nand Blue (RGB) wavelengths, respectively, with diffraction efficiencies of\n1st(-1st) orders reach 47.5% under TE polarization. The surface microstructure\nwith period of 18.9um is realized by integrating the three sub-gratings\ntogether, and it is verified numerically that the diffractive angle of RGB\nwavelengths is 35{\\deg} and the crosstalk is less than 4.5% under the normal\nincidence of TE polarization, which imply the surface microstructure diffracts\nthe certain RGB wavelengths achromatically. Via proper duplication it could be\nutilized as the combining optics of diffractive-waveguide near-eye display and\nhead-up display because of its light and compact features.\n", "  We extend quantum Stein's lemma in asymmetric quantum hypothesis testing to\ncomposite null and alternative hypotheses. As our main result, we show that the\nasymptotic error exponent for testing convex combinations of quantum states\n$\\rho^{\\otimes n}$ against convex combinations of quantum states\n$\\sigma^{\\otimes n}$ is given by a regularized quantum relative entropy\ndistance formula. We prove that in general such a regularization is needed but\nalso discuss various settings where our formula as well as extensions thereof\nbecome single-letter. This includes a novel operational interpretation of the\nrelative entropy of coherence in terms of hypothesis testing. For our proof, we\nstart from the composite Stein's lemma for classical probability distributions\nand lift the result to the non-commutative setting by only using elementary\nproperties of quantum entropy. Finally, our findings also imply an improved\nMarkov type lower bound on the quantum conditional mutual information in terms\nof the regularized quantum relative entropy - featuring an explicit and\nuniversal recovery map.\n", "  We investigate the histograms of conductance values obtained during\ncontrolled electromigration thinning of Cu thin films. We focus on the question\nwhether the most frequently observed conductance values, apparent as peaks in\nconductance histograms, can be attributed to the atomic structure of the wire.\nTo this end we calculate the Fourier transform of the conductance histograms.\nWe find all the frequencies matching the highly symmetric crystallographic\ndirections of fcc-Cu. In addition, there are other frequencies explainable by\noxidation and possibly formation of hcp-Cu. With these structures we can\nexplain all peaks occurring in the Fourier transform within the relevant range.\nThe results remain the same if only a third of the samples are included. By\ncomparing our results to the ones available in the literature on work-hardened\nnanowires we find indications that even at low temperatures of the environment,\nmetallic nanocontacts could show enhanced electromigration at low current\ndensities due to defects enhancing electron scattering.\n", "  The investigation about the volume of a black hole is closely related to the\nquantum nature of the black hole. The entropy is a significant concept for\nthis. A recent work by Majhi and Samanta [Phys. Lett. B 770 (2017) 314] after\nus presented a similar conclusion that the entropy associated with the volume\nis proportional to the surface area of the black hole, but the proportionality\ncoefficient is different from our earlier result. In this paper, we clarify the\ndifference and show that their calculation is unrelated to the interior of the\nblack hole.\n", "  Neutron stars, the compact stellar remnants of core-collapse supernova\nexplosions, are unique cosmic laboratories for exploring novel phases of matter\nunder extreme conditions. In particular, the occurrence of superfluidity and\nsuperconductivity in neutron stars will be briefly reviewed.\n", "  The Capture Theory gives planet production through a tidal interaction\nbetween a condensed star and a diffuse protostar within a dense embedded\ncluster. Initial extensive and highly eccentric planetary orbits round-off and\ndecay in a circumstellar disk of material captured from the protostar.\nCollapsing protoplanets leave behind a circumplanetary disk within which\nsatellites form by an accretion process. Many properties of exoplanets: orbits\nvery close to and very far from stars, highly eccentric orbits, planets around\nbinary stars, the proportion of stars with planets and spin-orbit misalignments\nare straightforwardly explained in terms of this model. It is proposed that the\ninitial Solar System contained six major planets, the existing four plus\nBellona of mass 2.5 MJ and Enyo of mass 1.9 MJ, where MJ is the mass of\nJupiter. The products of a collision between the two additional planets explain\nmany features of the Solar System: the larger terrestrial planets, Mars and\nMercury and their characteristics, the Earth-Moon relationship and the surface\nfeatures of the Moon, the formation of asteroids, comets and dwarf planets, the\nformation of the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, the relationship between Neptune,\nPluto and Triton, the characteristics of ice-giants and isotopic anomalies in\nmeteorites. All the mechanisms involved in these processes are well understood\nand occur in other astronomical contexts.\n", "  Flux-limited Keller-Segel (FLKS) model has been recently derived from kinetic\ntransport models for bacterial chemotaxis and shown to represent better the\ncollective movement observed experimentally. Recently, associated to the\nkinetic model, a new instability formalism has been discovered related to stiff\nchemotactic response. This motivates our study of traveling wave and\naggregation in population dynamics of chemotactic cells based on the FLKS model\nwith a population growth term. Our study includes both numerical and\ntheoretical contributions. In the numerical part, we uncover a variety of\nsolution types in the one-dimensional FLKS model additionally to standard\nFisher/KPP type traveling wave. The remarkable result is a counter-intuitive\nbackward traveling wave, where the population density initially saturated in a\nstable state transits toward an unstable state in the local population\ndynamics. Unexpectedly, we also find that the backward traveling wave solution\ntransits to a localized spiky solution as increasing the stiffness of\nchemotactic response. In the theoretical part, we obtain a novel analytic\nformula for the minimum traveling speed which includes the counterbalancing\neffect of chemotactic drift vs. reproduction/diffusion in the propagating\nfront. The front propagation speeds of numerical results only slightly deviate\nfrom the minimum traveling speeds, except for the localized spiky solutions,\neven for the backward traveling waves. We also discover an analytic solution of\nunimodal traveling wave in the large-stiffness limit, which is certainly\nunstable but exists in a certain range of parameters.\n", "  As a serious attempt for constructing a new foundation for describing\nmicro-entities from a causal standpoint, it was explained before in [1, 2, 3]\nthat by unifying the concepts of information, matter and energy, each\nmicro-entity is assumed to be composed of a probability field joined to a\nparticle called a particle-field or PF system. In this essay, the relativistic\ngeneralization of the PF theory has been considered. The equation of motion for\nthe PF system is derived in a form which is Lorentz-invariant. Moreover, based\non constitutional similarities to classical equations of motion, a well-defined\nrelativistic time-independent Schrodinger equation is derived, which is one of\nour main achievements in developing a micro-relativistic physics of PF theory.\nThis relativistic Schrodinger equation is solved for a relativistic\nmicro-particle in one-dimensional box to find its eigenstate and energy\nspectrum.\n", "  As a serious attempt for constructing a new foundation for describing\nmicro-entities from a causal standpoint, it was explained before in [1, 2, 3]\nthat by unifying the concepts of information, matter and energy, each\nmicro-entity is assumed to be composed of a probability field joined to a\nparticle called a particle-field or PF system. The relativistic generalization\nof this theory and its invariance under Lorentz transformation has been proved.\nIn this essay, based on the relativistic generalization of Schrodinger equation\nderived in [4], we solve the relativistic Schrodinger equation for relativistic\nmicro-harmonic oscillator to find its energy. Also we obtain the energy\nspectrum of Hydrogen atom that is the main purpose of this paper. We see that\nthe result is completely consistent with the relativistic correction to the\nHydrogen's energy in first-order perturbation theory.\n", "  We explore the possibility of performing an HI intensity mapping survey with\nthe South African MeerKAT radio telescope, which is a precursor to the Square\nKilometre Array (SKA). We propose to use cross-correlations between the MeerKAT\nintensity mapping survey and optical galaxy surveys, in order to mitigate\nsystematic effects and produce robust cosmological measurements. Our forecasts\nshow that precise measurements of the HI signal can be made in the near future.\nThese can be used to constrain HI and cosmological parameters across a wide\nrange of redshift.\n", "  This is a review of the observational and theoretical evidence for nanoflare\nheating of the magnetically-closed corona.\n", "  Cosmic rays are atomic nuclei arriving from outer space that reach the\nhighest energies observed in nature. Clues to their origin come from studying\nthe distribution of their arrival directions. Using $3 \\times 10^4$ cosmic rays\nabove $8 \\times 10^{18}$ electron volts, recorded with the Pierre Auger\nObservatory from a total exposure of 76,800 square kilometers steradian year,\nwe report an anisotropy in the arrival directions. The anisotropy, detected at\nmore than the 5.2$\\sigma$ level of significance, can be described by a dipole\nwith an amplitude of $6.5_{-0.9}^{+1.3}$% towards right ascension $\\alpha_{d} =\n100 \\pm 10$ degrees and declination $\\delta_{d} = -24_{-13}^{+12}$ degrees.\nThat direction indicates an extragalactic origin for these ultra-high energy\nparticles.\n", "  The surface magnetic field strength of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is found to\nbe about 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of garden variety radio pulsars\n(with a spin of $\\sim 0.5-5$ s and $B\\sim 10^{12}$G). The exact mechanism of\nthe apparent reduction of field strength in MSPs is still a subject of debate.\nOne of the proposed mechanisms is burial of the surface magnetic field under\nmatter accreted from a companion. In this article we review the recent work on\nmagnetic confinement of accreted matter on neutron stars poles. We present the\nsolutions of the magneto-static equations with a more accurate equation of\nstate of the magnetically confined plasma and discuss its implications for the\nfield burial mechanism.\n", "  With the construction of the VLTI (Very Large Telescope Interferometer of the\nEuropean Observatory ESO for the southern hemisphere) it is now possible to\nmake observations with resolutions of the order of milli-arc-seconds,\nespecially in IR with AMBER instrument (Astronomical Multi Beam Recombine).\nThese new capabilities allow us to better constrain the stellar structures such\nas polar jets, equatorial disks and flattened photospheres of rotating stars.\nThus the estimation of stellar fundamental parameters allows to explore in\ndetail the mechanisms of mass loss, pulsation and magnetism governing the\nvariability and the evolution of the stars.\n  This thesis presents the results of fast rotating stars observations carried\nout on the AMBER spectro-interferometer VLTI in its high \\& medium spectral\nresolutions modes. The observations were highly degraded by the optical defects\nof AMBER and their analysis required the development of specific digital\nreduction tools to reach the necessary precision for the interferometric\nmeasurements interpretation. In order to interpret those measures I developed a\nchromatic semi-analytical model of rapidly rotating star that allowed me to\nestimate, from the differential phases; the degree of flattening, the\nequatorial radius, the rotation velocity, the angle of inclination, the\nposition angle of the star rotation axis in the sky, the local distribution of\nthe effective temperature and the surface gravity of the star within the von\nZeipel theorem. The results for four massive stars of spectral types B, A and F\nhave allowed me to characterize the mechanisms discussed above and thus open\nsome prospect for more systematic studies of similar objects, with extending\nlater these studies to the relationship photosphere - circumstellar envelope.\n", "  Including an extra reactant in the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model, the\ndynamical competition between different chemical species during the Turing\npattern formation can lead to species territory invasion phenomenon among\ndifferent patterns of respective species. We report a peculiar oscillatory\nchange on respective mass of a 2D pattern under competition condition by\nnumerical simulation. The invaded Turing spot pattern can turn from a steady\nfading mode into a spontaneous resonant oscillation mode, the firefly lighting\nmode, which occurs synchronously among nearest neighboring spots, until the\nlargest spot is annihilated finally. Such resonant oscillation behavior for\nannihilation can continue but in a more chaotic way towards final dying of the\npattern by invasion of another pattern. The resonant frequency is found to be\nintrinsic character of the invaded pattern, depending on its control\nparameters.\n", "  Many equations have been introduced and derived by the author indicated in\nthe title in relation to multi-electron densities between the Hohenberg-Kohn\ntheorems and variational principle, conversion of the non-relativistic\nelectronic Schrodinger equation to scaling correct moment functional of ground\nstate one-electron density to estimate ground state electronic energy,\nparticipation of electron-electron repulsion energy operator in the\nnon-relativistic electronic Schrodinger equation via the coupling strength\nparameter along with generalizing the Hund rule, the emblematic theorems\nvirial-, Moller-Plesset-, Hohenberg-Kohn-, Koopmans-, Brillouin theorem and\nconfiguration interactions formalism, and with analytic evaluation of Coulomb\nintegrals for one, two and three-electron operators, as well as focusing on\nground state electronic energy, correlation energy and zero point energy of\nstationer molecular systems.\n", "  Calculation of the rotation-vibration spectrum of H3+, as well as of its\ndeuterated isotopologues, with near-spectroscopic accuracy requires the\ndevelopment of sophisticated theoretical models, methods, and codes. The\npresent paper reviews the state-of-the-art in these fields. Computation of\nrovibrational states on a given potential energy surface (PES) has now become\nstandard for triatomic molecules, at least up to intermediate energies, due to\ndevelopments achieved by the present authors and others. However, highly\naccurate Born--Oppenheimer energies leading to highly accurate PESs are not\naccessible even for this two-electron system using conventional electronic\nstructure procedures e.g., configuration-interaction or coupled-cluster\ntechniques with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit). For this\npurpose highly specialized techniques must be used, e.g., those employing\nexplicitly correlated Gaussians and nonlinear parameter optimizations. It has\nalso become evident that a very dense grid of \\ai\\ points is required to obtain\nreliable representations of the computed points extending from the minimum to\nthe asymptotic limits. Furthermore, adiabatic, relativistic, and QED correction\nterms need to be considered to achieve near-spectroscopic accuracy during\ncalculation of the rotation-vibration spectrum of H3+. The remaining and most\nintractable problem is then the treatment of the effects of non-adiabatic\ncoupling on the rovibrational energies, which, in the worst cases, may lead to\ncorrections on the order of several \\cm. A promising way of handling this\ndifficulty is the further development of effective, motion- or even\ncoordinate-dependent, masses and mass surfaces. Finally, the unresolved\nchallenge of how to describe and elucidate the experimental pre-dissociation\nspectra of H$_3^+$ and its isotopologues is discussed.\n", "  We derive a closed formula for the generating function of genus two\nGromov-Witten invariants of quintic 3-folds and verify the corresponding mirror\nsymmetry conjecture of Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri and Vafa.\n", "  In this paper we explore the intermediate line region (ILR) by using the\nphotoionisation simulations of the gas clouds present at different radial\ndistances from the center, corresponding to the locations from BLR out to NLR\nin four types of AGNs. We let for the presence of dust whenever conditions\nallow for dust existence. All spectral shapes are taken from the recent\nmulti-wavelength campaigns. The cloud density decreases with distance as a\npower law. We found that the slope of the power law density profile does not\naffect the line emissivity radial profiles of major emission lines: H${\\beta}$,\nHe~II, Mg~II, C~III] ~and [O~III]. When the density of the cloud at the\nsublimation radius is as high as 10$^{11.5}$ cm$^{-3}$, the ILR should clearly\nbe seen in the observations independently of the shape of the illuminating\nradiation. Moreover, our result is valid for low ionization nuclear emission\nregions of active galaxies.\n", "  We show that the anti-de Sitter(AdS) space naturally emerges from the\nconformal field theory(CFT). The behavior of the leading divergent term in the\nentanglement entropy implies the underlying AdS geometry. The coefficient of\nthe leading divergent term is related to the radius of the AdS space. All these\nare confirmed fully for the two dimensional CFTs. We also give comments for the\nhigher dimensional CFTs.\n", "  In this note, we prove the completeness of Bethe vectors for the six vertex\nmodel with diagonal reflecting boundary conditions. We show that as\ninhomogeneity parameters get sent to infinity in a successive order the Bethe\nvectors give a complete basis of the space of states.\n", "  This review focuses on the physics of Gamma Ray Bursts probed through their\nradio afterglow emission. Even though radio band is the least explored of the\nafterglow spectrum, it has played an important role in the progress of GRB\nphysics, specifically in confirming the hypothesized relativistic effects.\nCurrently radio astronomy is in the beginning of a revolution. The high\nsensitive Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is being planned, its precursors and\npathfinders are about to be operational, and several existing instruments are\nundergoing upgradation. Thus, the afterglow detection statistics and results\nfrom follow up programs are expected to improve in the coming years. We list a\nfew avenues unique to radio band which if explored to full potential have the\npromise to greatly contribute to the future of GRB physics.\n", "  Neutron stars in X-ray binary systems are fascinating objects that display a\nwide range of timing and spectral phenomena in the X-rays. Not only parameters\nof the neutron stars, like magnetic field strength and spin period evolve in\ntheir active binary phase, the neutron stars also affect the binary systems and\ntheir immediate surroundings in many ways. Here we discuss some aspects of the\ninteractions of the neutron stars with their environments that are revelaed\nfrom their X-ray emission. We discuss some recent developments involving the\nprocess of accretion onto high magnetic field neutron stars: accretion stream\nstructure and formation, shape of pulse profile and its changes with accretion\ntorque. Various recent studies of reprocessing of X-rays in the accretion disk\nsurface, vertical structures of the accretion disk and wind of companion star\nare also discussed here. The X-ray pulsars among the binary neutron stars\nprovide excellent handle to make accurate measurement of the orbital parameters\nand thus also evolution of the binray orbits that take place over time scale of\na fraction of a million years to tens of millions of years. The orbital period\nevolution of X-ray binaries have shown them to be rather complex systems.\nOrbital evolution of X-ray binaries can also be carried out from timing of the\nX-ray eclipses and there have been some surprising results in that direction,\nincluding orbital period glitches in two X-ray binaries and possible detection\nof the most massive circum-binary planet around a Low Mass X-ray Binary.\n", "  At the beginning of 2016, LIGO reported the first-ever direct detection of\ngravitational waves. The measured signal was compatible with the merger of two\nblack holes of about 30 solar masses, releasing about 3 solar masses of energy\nin gravitational waves. We consider the possible neutrino emission from a\nbinary black hole merger relative to the energy released in gravitational waves\nand investigate the constraints coming from the non-detection of counterpart\nneutrinos, focusing on IceCube and its energy range. The information from\nsearches for counterpart neutrinos is combined with the diffuse astrophysical\nneutrino flux in order to put bounds on neutrino emission from binary black\nhole mergers. Prospects for future LIGO observation runs are shown and compared\nwith model predictions.\n", "  Quantum Markov semigroups characterize the time evolution of an important\nclass of open quantum systems. Studying convergence properties of such a\nsemigroup, and determining concentration properties of its invariant state,\nhave been the focus of much research. Quantum versions of functional\ninequalities (like the modified logarithmic Sobolev and Poincar\\'{e}\ninequalities) and the so-called transportation cost inequalities, have proved\nto be essential for this purpose. Classical functional and transportation cost\ninequalities are seen to arise from a single geometric inequality, called the\nRicci lower bound, via an inequality which interpolates between them. The\nlatter is called the HWI-inequality, where the letters I, W and H are,\nrespectively, acronyms for the Fisher information (arising in the modified\nlogarithmic Sobolev inequality), the so-called Wasserstein distance (arising in\nthe transportation cost inequality) and the relative entropy (or Boltzmann H\nfunction) arising in both. Hence, classically, all the above inequalities and\nthe implications between them form a remarkable picture which relates elements\nfrom diverse mathematical fields, such as Riemannian geometry, information\ntheory, optimal transport theory, Markov processes, concentration of measure,\nand convexity theory. Here we consider a quantum version of the Ricci lower\nbound introduced by Carlen and Maas, and prove that it implies a quantum HWI\ninequality from which the quantum functional and transportation cost\ninequalities follow. Our results hence establish that the unifying picture of\nthe classical setting carries over to the quantum one.\n"]}
