The shapes of the pair\ncorrelation distributions are studied in a variety of collision centrality\nclasses between 0 and 50% of the total hadronic cross section for particles in\nthe pseudorapidity interval $|\\eta| < 1.0$. Distributions in relative azimuth\n$\\Delta\\phi \\equiv \\phi^t - \\phi^a$ are analyzed for $|\\Delta\\eta| \\equiv\n|\\eta^t - \\eta^a| > 0.8$, and are referred to as \"long-range correlations\".\nFourier components $V_{n\\Delta} \\equiv \\langle \\cos(n\\Delta\\phi)\\rangle$ are\nextracted from the long-range azimuthal correlation functions. If particle\npairs are correlated to one another through their individual correlation to a\ncommon symmetry plane, then the pair anisotropy $V_{n\\Delta}(p_{T}^t, p_{T}^a)$\nis fully described in terms of single-particle anisotropies $v_n (p_{T})$ as\n$V_{n\\Delta}(p_{T}^t, p_{T}^a) = v_n(p_{T}^t) \\, v_n(p_{T}^a)$.

It is found that for $2 \\leq n \\leq 5$, the fit agrees well with data\nup to $p_T^a \\sim 3$-4 GeV/$c$, with a trend of increasing deviation as\n$p_{T}^t$ and $p_{T}^a$ are increased or as collisions become more peripheral.\nThis suggests that no pair correlation harmonic can be described over the full\n$0.25 < p_{T} < 15$ GeV/$c$ range using a single $v_n(p_T)$ curve; such a\ndescription is however approximately possible for $2 \\leq n \\leq 5$ when $p_T^a\n< 4$ GeV/$c$. For the $n=1$ harmonic, however, a single $v_1(p_T$ curve is not\nobtained even within the reduced range $p_T^a < 4$ GeV/$c$.\n", "  The yield of charged particles associated with high-$p_{\\rm T}$ trigger\nparticles ($8 < p_{\\rm T} < 15$ GeV/$c$) is measured with the ALICE detector in\nPb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV relative to proton-proton\ncollisions at the same energy. The conditional per-trigger yields are extracted\nfrom the narrow jet-like correlation peaks in azimuthal di-hadron correlations.\nIn the 5% most central collisions, we observe that the yield of associated\ncharged particles with transverse momenta $p_{\\rm T}> 3$ GeV/$c$ on the\naway-side drops to about 60% of that observed in pp collisions, while on the\nnear-side a moderate enhancement of 20-30% is found.\n", "  The $p_{\\rm T}$-differential inclusive production cross sections of the\nprompt charmed mesons $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D^{*+}$ in the rapidity range |y|<0.5\nwere measured in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV at the LHC\nusing the ALICE detector. Reconstructing the decays $D^0\\rightarrow K^-\\pi^+$,\n$D^+\\rightarrow K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$, $D^{*+}\\rightarrow D^0\\pi^+$, and their charge\nconjugates, about 8,400 $D^0$, 2,900 $D^+$, and 2,600 $D^{*+}$ mesons with\n1<$p_{\\rm T}$<24 GeV/$c$ were counted, after selection cuts, in a data sample\nof 3.14x10$^8$ events collected with a minimum-bias trigger (integrated\nluminosity $L_{\\rm int}$ = 5/nb). The results are described within\nuncertainties by predictions based on perturbative QCD.\n", "  We have studied J/psi production in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV at the\nLHC through its muon pair decay. The polar and azimuthal angle distributions of\nthe decay muons were measured, and results on the J/$\\psi$ polarization\nparameters $\\lambda_{\\theta}$ and $\\lambda_\\phi$ were obtained. The study was\nperformed in the kinematic region 2.5<y<4, 2<$p_{\\rm T}$<8 GeV/$c$, in the\nhelicity and Collins-Soper reference frames. In both frames, the polarization\nparameters are compatible with zero, within uncertainties.\n", "  The ALICE experiment has measured low-mass dimuon production in pp collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV in the dimuon rapidity region 2.5<y<4. The observed\ndimuon mass spectrum is described as a superposition of resonance decays\n($\\eta$, $\\rho$, $\\omega$, $\\eta^{'}$, $\\phi$) into muons and semi-leptonic\ndecays of charmed mesons. The measured production cross sections for $\\omega$\nand $\\phi$ are $\\sigma_\\omega$ (1<$p_{\\rm T}$<5 GeV/$c$,2.5<y<4) = 5.28 $\\pm$\n0.54 (stat) $\\pm$ 0.50 (syst) mb and $\\sigma_\\phi$(1<$p_{\\rm T}$<5\nGeV/$c$,2.5<y<4)=0.940 $\\pm$ 0.084 (stat) $\\pm$ 0.078 (syst) mb. The\ndifferential cross sections $d^2\\sigma/dy dp_{\\rm T}$ are extracted as a\nfunction of $p_{\\rm T}$ for $\\omega$ and $\\phi$. The ratio between the $\\rho$\nand $\\omega$ cross section is obtained. Results for the $\\phi$ are compared\nwith other measurements at the same energy and with predictions by models.\n", "  The effect of event background fluctuations on charged particle jet\nreconstruction in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV has been\nmeasured with the ALICE experiment. The main sources of non-statistical\nfluctuations are characterized based purely on experimental data with an\nunbiased method, as well as by using single high $p_{\\rm T}$ particles and\nsimulated jets embedded into real Pb-Pb events and reconstructed with the\nanti-$k_{\\rm T}$ jet finder. The influence of a low transverse momentum cut-off\non particles used in the jet reconstruction is quantified by varying the\nminimum track $p_{\\rm T}$ between 0.15 GeV/$c$ and 2 GeV/$c$. For embedded jets\nreconstructed from charged particles with $p_{\\rm T} > 0.15$ GeV/$c$, the\nuncertainty in the reconstructed jet transverse momentum due to the heavy-ion\nbackground is measured to be 11.3 GeV/$c$ (standard deviation) for the 10% most\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions, slightly larger than the value of 11.0 GeV/$c$\nmeasured using the unbiased method. For a higher particle transverse momentum\nthreshold of 2 GeV/$c$, which will generate a stronger bias towards hard\nfragmentation in the jet finding process, the standard deviation of the\nfluctuations in the reconstructed jet transverse momentum is reduced to 4.8-5.0\nGeV/$c$ for the 10% most central events. A non-Gaussian tail of the momentum\nuncertainty is observed and its impact on the reconstructed jet spectrum is\nevaluated for varying particle momentum thresholds, by folding the measured\nfluctuations with steeply falling spectra.\n", "  A type of fractional derivative, referred to as \\alpha-derivative, is\nstudied. The \\alpha-derivative of fractional type obeys Leibnitz rule. Based on\nthe definition of \\alpha-derivative the operations of analysis and differential\ngeometry are studied It was recently proved, that this variant of introduction\nof the derivative leads to a new scaling of the common Leibniz derivative, but\nnot to a alternative type of derivation. In other words, all derivatives, that\nsatisfy the Leibniz rule, are algebraically equivalent.\n", "  A measurement of the multi-strange $\\Xi^-$ and $\\Omega^-$ baryons and their\nantiparticles by the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nis presented for inelastic proton-proton collisions at centre of mass energy of\n7 TeV. The transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) distributions were studied at\nmid-rapidity (|y| < 0.5) in the range of 0.6 < $p_{\\rm T}$ < 8.5 GeV/$c$ for\n$\\Xi^-$ and $\\Xi^+$ baryons, and in the range of 0.8 < $p_{\\rm T}$ < 5 GeV/$c$\nfor $\\Omega^-$ and $\\Omega^+$. Baryons and antibaryons were measured as\nseparate particles and we find that the baryon to antibaryon ratio of both\nparticle species is consistent with unity over the entire range of the\nmeasurement. The statistical precision of the current LHC data has allowed us\nto measure a difference between the mean $p_{\\rm T}$ of $\\Xi^-$ ($\\Xi^+$) and\n$\\Omega^-$ ($\\Omega^+$). Particle yields, mean $p_{\\rm T}$, and the spectra in\nthe intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$ range are not well described by the PYTHIA Perugia\n2011 tune Monte Carlo event generator, which has been tuned to reproduce the\nearly LHC data. The discrepancy is largest for $\\Omega^-$ ($\\Omega^+$). This\nPYTHIA tune approaches the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra of $\\Xi^-$ and $\\Xi^+$ baryons\nbelow $p_{\\rm T}$ < 0.85 GeV/$c$ and describes the $\\Xi^-$ and $\\Xi^+$ spectra\nabove $p_{\\rm T}$ > 6.0 GeV/$c$. We also illustrate the difference between the\nexperimental data and model by comparing the corresponding ratios of\n($\\Omega^{-}+\\Omega^+)/(\\Xi^-+\\Xi^+)$ as a function of transverse mass.\n", "  In the present article, we introduce and also deploy a new, simple, very fast\nand efficient method, the Fast Norm Vector Indicator (FNVI) in order to\ndistinguish rapidly and with certainty between ordered and chaotic motion in\nHamiltonian systems. This distinction is based on the different behavior of the\nFNVI for the two cases: the indicator after a very short transient period of\nfluctuation displays a nearly constant value for regular orbits, while it\ncontinues to fluctuate significantly for chaotic orbits. In order to quantify\nthe results obtained by the FNVI method, we establish the dFNVI, which is the\nquantified numerical version of the FNVI. A thorough study of the method's\nability to achieve an early and clear detection of an orbit's behavior is\npresented both in two and three degrees of freedom (2D and 3D) Hamiltonians.\nExploiting the advantages of the dFNVI method, we demonstrate how one can\nrapidly identify even tiny regions of order or chaos in the phase space of\nHamiltonian systems. The new method can also be applied in order to follow the\ntime evolution of sticky orbits. A detailed comparison between the new FNVI\nmethod and some other well-known dynamical methods of chaos detection reveals\nthe great efficiency and the leading role of this new dynamical indicator.\n", "  We study nonlinear bound states, or solitary waves, in the Dirac-Maxwell\nsystem proving the existence of solutions in which the Dirac wave function is\nof the form $\\phi(x,\\omega)e^{-i\\omega t}$, $\\omega\\in(-m,\\omega_*)$, with some\n$\\omega_*>-m$, such that $\\phi_\\omega\\in H^1(\\mathbb{R}^3,\\mathbb{C}^4)$,\n$\\Vert\\phi_\\omega\\Vert^2_{L^2}=O(m-|\\omega|)$, and\n$\\Vert\\phi_\\omega\\Vert_{L^\\infty}=O(m-|\\omega|)$. The method of proof is an\nimplicit function theorem argument based on an identification of the\nnonrelativistic limit as the ground state of the Choquard equation.\n", "  In this article, we present a galactic gravitational model of three degrees\nof freedom (3D), in order to study and reveal the character of the orbits of\nthe stars, in a binary stellar system composed of a primary quiet or active\ngalaxy and a small satellite companion galaxy. Our main dynamical analysis will\nbe focused on the behavior of the primary galaxy. We investigate in detail the\nregular or chaotic nature of motion, in two different cases: (i) the\ntime-independent model in both 2D and 3D dynamical systems and (ii) the\ntime-evolving 3D model. Our numerical calculations indicate that the percentage\nof the chaotic orbits increases when the primary galaxy has a dense and massive\nnucleus. The presence of the dense galactic core also increases the stellar\nvelocities near the center of the galaxy. Moreover, for small values of the\ndistance R between the two bodies, low-energy stars display chaotic motion,\nnear the central region of the galaxy, while for larger values of the distance\nR, the motion in active galaxies is entirely regular for low-energy stars. Our\nsimulations suggest that in galaxies with a satellite companion, the chaotic\nnature of motion is not only a result of the galactic interaction between the\nprimary galaxy and its companion, but also a result caused by the presence of\nthe dense nucleus in the core of the primary galaxy. Theoretical arguments are\npresented in order to support and interpret the numerically derived outcomes.\nFurthermore, we follow the 3D evolution of the primary galaxy, when mass is\ntransported adiabatically from the disk to the nucleus. Our numerical results\nare in satisfactory agreement with observational data obtained from the\nM51-type binary stellar systems. A comparison between the present research and\nsimilar and earlier work is also made.\n", "  We investigate the axial w quasi-normal modes of neutron stars for 18\nrealistic equations of state in order to study the influence of hyperons and\nquarks on the modes. The study has been developed with a new method based on\nExterior Complex Scaling with variable angle, which allow us to generate pure\noutgoing quasi-normal modes. A complete study of the junction conditions has\nbeen done. We have obtained that w-modes can be used to distinguish between\nneutron stars with exotic matter and without exotic matter for compact enough\nstars.\n", "  Recent weak and strong lensing data of the galaxy cluster A1689 are modelled\nby dark fermions that are quantum degenerate within some core. The gas density,\ndeduced from X-ray observations up to 1 Mpc and obeying a cored power law, is\ntaken as input, while the galaxy mass density is modelled. An additional dark\nmatter tail may arise from cold or warm dark matter, axions or non-degenerate\nneutrinos. The fit yields that the fermions are degenerate within a 430 kpc\nradius. The fermion mass is a few eV and the best case involves 3 active plus 3\nsterile neutrinos of equal mass, for which we deduce $1.51 \\pm 0.04$ eV. The eV\nmass range will be tested in the KATRIN experiment.\n", "  Extremal rotating black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory feature two\nbranches. On the branch emerging from the Myers-Perry solutions their angular\nmomentum is proportional to their horizon area, while on the branch emerging\nfrom the Tangherlini solutions their angular momentum is proportional to their\nhorizon angular momentum. The transition between these branches occurs at a\ncritical value of the charge, which depends on the value of the angular\nmomentum. However, when a dilaton is included, the angular momentum is always\nproportional to the horizon area.\n", "  We investigate the regular or chaotic nature of orbits of stars moving in the\nmeridional plane (R,z) of an axially symmetric galactic model with a dense,\nmassive spherical nucleus and a dark matter halo component. In particular, we\nstudy the influence of the fractional portion of the dark matter, by computing\nin each case the percentage of chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of\norbits of the main regular resonant families. In an attempt to distinguish\nbetween regular and chaotic motion, we use the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI)\nmethod to extensive samples of orbits obtained by integrating numerically the\nequations of motion as well as the variational equations. Furthermore, a\ntechnique which is based mainly on the field of spectral dynamics that utilizes\nthe Fourier transform of the time series of each coordinate is used for\nidentifying the various families of regular orbits and also to recognize the\nsecondary resonances that bifurcate from them. Two cases are studied in our\nwork: (i) the case where we have a disk galaxy model (ii) the case where our\nmodel represents an elliptical galaxy. Comparison with early related work is\nalso made.\n", "  An axially symmetric galactic gravitational model composed of a dense,\nmassive and spherical nucleus with an additional dark matter halo component was\nused, to distinguish between the regular and chaotic character of orbits of\nstars that move in the meridional plane (R,z). We investigated two different\ncases: (i) a flat-disk galaxy (ii) an elliptical galaxy. It is of particular\ninterest to reveal how the portion of the dark matter inside the main body of\nthe galaxy influences the ordered or chaotic nature of motion. Varying the\nratio of dark matter to stellar mass, we monitored the evolution not only of\nthe percentage of chaotic orbits, but also of the percentages of orbits that\ncompose the main regular resonant families, by classifying regular orbits into\ndifferent families. Moreover we tried, to reveal how the starting position of\nthe parent periodic orbits of each regular family changes with respect to the\nfractional portion of dark matter. We compared our results with previous\nsimilar work.\n", "  We investigate the regular or chaotic nature of orbits of stars moving in the\nmeridional plane $(R,z)$ of an axially symmetric galactic model with a flat\ndisk and a central, non spherical and massive nucleus. In particular, we study\nthe influence of the flattening parameter of the central nucleus on the nature\nof orbits, by computing in each case the percentage of chaotic orbits, as well\nas the percentages of orbits of the main regular families. In an attempt to\nmaximize the accuracy of our results upon distinguishing between regular and\nchaotic motion, we use both the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) and the Smaller\nALingment Index (SALI) methods to extensive samples of orbits obtained by\nintegrating numerically the equations of motion as well as the variational\nequations. Moreover, a technique which is based mainly on the field of spectral\ndynamics that utilizes the Fourier transform of the time series of each\ncoordinate is used for identifying the various families of regular orbits and\nalso to recognize the secondary resonances that bifurcate from them. Varying\nthe value of the flattening parameter, we study three different cases: (i) the\ncase where we have a prolate nucleus (ii) the case where the central nucleus is\nspherical and (iii) the case where an oblate massive nucleus is present.\nFurthermore, we present some additional findings regarding the reliability of\nshort time (fast) chaos indicators, as well as a new method to define the\nthreshold between chaos and regularity for both FLI and SALI, by using them\nsimultaneously. Comparison with early related work is also made.\n", "  EFTCAMB/EFTCosmoMC are publicly available patches to the CAMB/CosmoMC codes\nimplementing the effective field theory approach to single scalar field dark\nenergy and modified gravity models. With the present numerical notes we provide\na guide to the technical details of the code. Moreover we reproduce, as they\nappear in the code, the complete set of the modified equations and the\nexpressions for all the other relevant quantities used to construct these\npatches. We submit these notes to the arXiv to grant full and permanent access\nto this material which provides very useful guidance to the numerical\nimplementation of the EFT framework. We will update this set of notes when\nrelevant modifications to the EFTCAMB/EFTCosmoMC codes will be released. The\npresent version is based on the version of EFTCAMB/EFTCosmoMC Sep17.\n", "  In textbooks, ideal quantum measurements are described in terms of the tested\nsystem only by the collapse postulate and Born's rule. This level of\ndescription offers a rather flexible position for the interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. Here we analyse an ideal measurement as a process of interaction\nbetween the tested system S and an apparatus A, so as to derive the properties\npostulated in textbooks. We thus consider within standard quantum mechanics the\nmeasurement of a quantum spin component $\\hat s_z$ by an apparatus A, being a\nmagnet coupled to a bath. We first consider the evolution of the density\noperator of S+A describing a large set of runs of the measurement process. The\napproach describes the disappearance of the off-diagonal terms (\"truncation\")\nof the density matrix as a physical effect due to A, while the registration of\nthe outcome has classical features due to the large size of the pointer\nvariable, the magnetisation. A quantum ambiguity implies that the density\nmatrix at the final time can be decomposed on many bases, not only the one of\nthe measurement. This quantum oddity prevents to connect individual outcomes to\nmeasurements, a difficulty known as the \"measurement problem\". It is shown that\nit is circumvented by the apparatus as well, since the evolution in a small\ntime interval erases all decompositions, except the one on the measurement\nbasis. Once one can derive the outcome of individual events from quantum\ntheory, the so-called \"collapse of the wave function\" or the \"reduction of the\nstate\" appears as the result of a selection of runs among the original large\nset. Hence nothing more than standard quantum mechanics is needed to explain\nfeatures of measurements. The employed statistical formulation is advocated for\nthe teaching of quantum theory.\n", "  We determine the character of orbits of stars moving in the meridional plane\n$(R,z)$ of an axially symmetric time-independent disk galaxy model with a\nspherical central nucleus. In particular, we try to reveal the influence of the\nvalue of the angular momentum on the different families of orbits of stars, by\nmonitoring how the percentage of chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of\norbits of the main regular resonant families evolve when angular momentum\nvaries. The smaller alignment index (SALI) was computed by numerically\nintegrating the equations of motion as well as the variational equations to\nextensive samples of orbits in order to distinguish safely between ordered and\nchaotic motion. In addition, a method based on the concept of spectral dynamics\nthat utilizes the Fourier transform of the time series of each coordinate is\nused to identify the various families of regular orbits and also to recognize\nthe secondary resonances that bifurcate from them. Our investigation takes\nplace both in the physical $(R,z)$ and the phase $(R,\\dot{R})$ space for a\nbetter understanding of the orbital properties of the system. Our numerical\ncomputations reveal that low angular momentum stars are most likely to move in\nchaotic orbits, while on the other hand, the vast majority of high angular\nmomentum stars perform regular orbits.\n", "  Graphite is a model system for the study of three-dimensional electrons and\nholes in the magnetic quantum limit, in which the charges are confined to the\nlowest Landau levels. We report magneto-transport measurements in pulsed\nmagnetic fields up to 60 T, which resolve the collapse of two density wave\nstates in two, electron and hole, Landau levels at 52.3 and 54.2 T\nrespectively. We report evidence for a commensurate density wave at 47.1 T in\nthe electron Landau level. The theoretical modelling of these results predicts\nthat the ultra-quantum limit is entered above 73.5 T. This state is an\ninsulator, and we discuss its correspondence to the \"metallic\" state reported\nearlier. We propose that this (interaction-induced) insulating phase supports\nsurface states that carry no charge or spin within the planes, but does however\nsupport charge transport out of plane.\n", "  The aim of this work is to explore the escape process of three-dimensional\norbits in a star cluster rotating around its parent galaxy in a circular orbit.\nThe gravitational field of the cluster is represented by a smooth, spherically\nsymmetric Plummer potential, while the tidal approximation was used to model\nthe steady tidal field of the galaxy. We conduct a thorough numerical analysis\ndistinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits as well as between trapped\nand escaping orbits, considering only unbounded motion for several energy\nlevels. It is of particular interest to locate the escape basins towards the\ntwo exit channels and relate them with the corresponding escape times of the\norbits. For this purpose, we split our investigation into three cases depending\non the initial value of the $z$ coordinate which was used for launching the\nstars. The most noticeable finding is that the majority of stars initiated very\nclose to the primary $(x,y)$ plane move in chaotic orbits and they remain\ntrapped for vast time intervals, while orbits with relatively high values of\n$z_0$ on the other hand, form well-defined basins of escape. It was also\nobserved, that for energy levels close to the critical escape energy the escape\nrates of orbits are large, while for much higher values of energy most of the\norbits have low escape periods or they escape immediately to infinity. We hope\nour outcomes to be useful for a further understanding of the dissolution\nprocess and the escape mechanism in open star clusters.\n", "  The H\\'{e}non-Heiles potential is undoubtedly one of the most simple,\nclassical and characteristic Hamiltonian systems. The aim of this work is to\nreveal the influence of the value of the total orbital energy, which is the\nonly parameter of the system, on the different families of orbits, by\nmonitoring how the percentage of chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of\norbits composing the main regular families evolve when energy varies. In\nparticular, we conduct a thorough numerical investigation distinguishing\nbetween ordered and chaotic orbits, considering only bounded motion for several\nenergy levels. The smaller alignment index (SALI) was computed by numerically\nintegrating the equations of motion as well as the variational equations to\nextensive samples of orbits in order to distinguish safely between ordered and\nchaotic motion. In addition, a method based on the concept of spectral dynamics\nthat utilizes the Fourier transform of the time series of each coordinate is\nused to identify the various families of regular orbits and also to recognize\nthe secondary resonances that bifurcate from them. Our exploration takes place\nboth in the physical $(x,y)$ and the phase $(y,\\dot{y})$ space for a better\nunderstanding of the orbital properties of the system. It was found, that for\nlow energy levels the motion is entirely regular being the box orbits the most\npopulated family, while as the value of the energy increases chaos and several\nresonant families appear. We also observed, that the vast majority of the\nresonant orbits belong in fact in bifurcated families of the main 1:1 resonant\nfamily. We have also compared our results with previous similar outcomes\nobtained using different chaos indicators.\n", "  The aim of this work is to review and also explore even further the escape\nproperties of orbits in a dynamical system of a two-dimensional perturbed\nharmonic oscillator, which is a characteristic example of open Hamiltonian\nsystems. In particular, we conduct a thorough numerical investigation\ndistinguishing between trapped (ordered and chaotic) and escaping orbits,\nconsidering only unbounded motion for several energy levels. It is of\nparticular interest, to locate the basins of escape towards the different\nescape channels and connect them with the corresponding escape periods of the\norbits. We split our examination into three different cases depending on the\nfunction of the perturbation term which determines the number of escape\nchannels on the physical space. In every case, we computed extensive samples of\norbits in both the physical and the phase space by integrating numerically the\nequations of motion as well as the variational equations. In an attempt to\ndetermine the regular or chaotic nature of trapped motion, we applied the SALI\nmethod as a chaos detector. It was found, that in all studied cases regions of\ntrapped orbits coexist with several basins of escape. It was also observed,\nthat for energy levels very close to the escape value the escape times of\norbits are large, while for values of energy much higher than the escape energy\nthe vast majority of orbits escape very quickly or even immediately to\ninfinity. The larger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial\nconditions in the boundaries of the escape basins and also in the vicinity of\nthe fractal structure. Most of the current outcomes have been compared with\nprevious related work. We hope that our results will be useful for a further\nunderstanding of the escape mechanism of orbits in open Hamiltonian systems\nwith two degrees of freedom.\n", "  The escape dynamics in a simple analytical gravitational model which\ndescribes the motion of stars in a Seyfert galaxy is investigated in detail. We\nconduct a thorough numerical analysis distinguishing between regular and\nchaotic orbits as well as between trapped and escaping orbits, considering only\nunbounded motion for several energy levels. In order to distinguish safely and\nwith certainty between ordered and chaotic motion, we apply the Smaller\nALingment Index (SALI) method. It is of particular interest to locate the\nescape basins through the openings around the collinear Lagrangian points $L_1$\nand $L_2$ and relate them with the corresponding spatial distribution of the\nescape times of the orbits. Our exploration takes place both in the physical\n$(x,y)$ and in the phase $(x,\\dot{x})$ space in order to elucidate the escape\nprocess as well as the overall orbital properties of the galactic system. Our\nnumerical analysis reveals the strong dependence of the properties of the\nconsidered escape basins with the total orbital energy, with a remarkable\npresence of fractal basin boundaries along all the escape regimes. It was also\nobserved, that for energy levels close to the critical escape energy the escape\nrates of orbits are large, while for much higher values of energy most of the\norbits have low escape periods or they escape immediately to infinity. We also\npresent evidence obtained through numerical simulations that our model can\ndescribe the formation and the evolution of the observed spiral structure in\nSeyfert galaxies. We hope our outcomes to be useful for a further understanding\nof the escape mechanism in galaxies with active nuclei.\n", "  The case of the planar circular restricted three-body problem where one of\nthe two primaries is an oblate spheroid is investigated. We conduct a thorough\nnumerical analysis on the phase space mixing by classifying initial conditions\nof orbits and distinguishing between three types of motion: (i) bounded, (ii)\nescape and (iii) collisional. The presented outcomes reveal the high complexity\nof this dynamical system. Furthermore, our numerical analysis shows a strong\ndependence of the properties of the considered escape basins with the total\norbital energy, with a remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries along\nall the escape regimes. Interpreting the collisional motion as leaking in the\nphase space we related our results to both chaotic scattering and the theory of\nleaking Hamiltonian systems. We also determined the escape and collisional\nbasins and computed the corresponding escape/crash times. The highly fractal\nbasin boundaries observed are related with high sensitivity to initial\nconditions thus implying an uncertainty between escape solutions which evolve\nto different regions of the phase space. We hope our contribution to be useful\nfor a further understanding of the escape and crash mechanism of orbits in this\nversion of the restricted three-body problem.\n", "  The regular or chaotic character of orbits of stars moving in the meridional\nplane (R,z) of an axially symmetric elliptical galaxy with a dense, massive\nspherical nucleus and a dark matter halo component is under investigation. In\nparticular, we explore how the flattening of an elliptical galaxy influences\nthe overall orbital structure of the system, by computing in each case the\npercentage of chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of orbits composing\nthe main regular families. In an attempt to discriminate safely and with\ncertainty between regular and chaotic motion, we use the Smaller ALingment\nIndex (SALI) method to extensive samples of orbits obtained by integrating\nnumerically the basic equations of motion as well as the variational equations.\nIn addition, a technique which is based mainly on the field of spectral\ndynamics that utilizes the Fourier transform of the time series of each\ncoordinate is used for classifying the regular orbits into different families\nand also to recognize the secondary resonances that usually bifurcate from\nthem. Three cases are considered in our work: (i) the case where the elliptical\ngalaxy is prolate (ii) the case where a spherically symmetric elliptical galaxy\nis present and (iii) the case where the elliptical galaxy has an oblate shape.\nComparison between the current results and early related work is also made.\n", "  The aim of this work is to compare the orbital dynamics in three different\nmodels describing the properties of a star cluster rotating around its parent\ngalaxy in a circular orbit. In particular, we use the isochrone and the\nHernquist potentials to model the spherically symmetric star cluster and we\ncompare our results with the corresponding ones of a previous work in which the\nPlummer model was applied for the same purpose. Our analysis takes place both\nin the configuration $(x,y)$ and in the phase $(x,\\dot{x})$ space in order to\nelucidate the escape process as well as the overall orbital properties of the\ntidally limited star cluster. We restrict our investigation into two dimensions\nand we conduct a thorough numerical analysis distinguishing between ordered and\nchaotic orbits as well as between trapped and escaping orbits, considering only\nunbounded motion for several energy levels above the critical escape energy. It\nis of particular interest to determine the escape basins towards the two exit\nchannels (near the Lagrangian points $L_1$ and $L_2$) and relate them with the\ncorresponding escape times of the orbits.\n", "  We use the planar circular restricted three-body problem in order to\nnumerically investigate the orbital dynamics of orbits of a spacecraft, or a\ncomet, or an asteroid in the Saturn-Titan system in a scattering region around\nthe Titan. The orbits can escape through the necks around the Lagrangian points\n$L_1$ and $L_2$ or collide with the surface of the Titan. We explore all the\nfour possible Hill's regions depending on the value of the Jacobi constant. We\nconduct a thorough numerical analysis on the phase space mixing by classifying\ninitial conditions of orbits and distinguishing between three types of motion:\n(i) bounded, (ii) escaping and (iii) collisional. In particular, we locate the\ndifferent basins and we relate them with the corresponding spatial\ndistributions of the escape and crash times. Our results reveal the high\ncomplexity of this planetary system. Furthermore, the numerical analysis shows\na strong dependence of the properties of the considered basins with the total\norbital energy, with a remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries along\nall the regimes. We hope our contribution to be useful in both space mission\ndesign and study of planetary systems.\n", "  We numerically investigate the case of the planar circular restricted\nthree-body problem where the more massive primary is an oblate spheroid. A\nthorough numerical analysis takes place in the configuration $(x,y)$ and the\n$(x,E)$ space in which we classify initial conditions of orbits into three\ncategories: (i) bounded, (ii) escaping and (iii) collisional. Our results\nreveal that the oblateness coefficient has a huge impact on the character of\norbits. Interpreting the collisional motion as leaking in the phase space we\nrelated our results to both chaotic scattering and the theory of leaking\nHamiltonian systems. We successfully located the escape as well as the\ncollisional basins and we managed to correlate them with the corresponding\nescape and collision times. We hope our contribution to be useful for a further\nunderstanding of the escape and collision properties of motion in this\ninteresting version of the restricted three-body problem.\n", "  Despite its age, quantum theory still suffers from serious conceptual\ndifficulties. To create clarity, mathematical physicists have been attempting\nto formulate quantum theory geometrically and to find a rigorous method of\nquantization, but this has not resolved the problem. In this article we argue\nthat a quantum theory recoursing to quantization algorithms is necessarily\nincomplete. To provide an alternative approach, we argue that the Schroedinger\nequation is a consequence of three partial differential equations governing the\ntime evolution of a given probability density. These equations, discovered by\nE. Madelung, naturally ground the Schroedinger theory in Newtonian mechanics\nand Kolmogorovian probability theory. A variety of far-reaching consequences\nfor the projection postulate, the correspondence principle, the measurement\nproblem, the uncertainty principle, and the modelling of particle creation and\nannihilation are immediate. We also give a speculative interpretation of the\nequations following Bohm, Vigier and Tsekov, by claiming that quantum\nmechanical behavior is possibly caused by gravitational background noise.\n", "  Systems such as fluid flows in channels and pipes or the complex\nGinzburg-Landau system, defined over periodic domains, exhibit both continuous\nsymmetries, translational and rotational, as well as discrete symmetries under\nspatial reflections or complex conjugation. The simplest, and very common\nsymmetry of this type is the equivariance of the defining equations under the\northogonal group O(2). We formulate a novel symmetry reduction scheme for such\nsystems by combining the method of slices with invariant polynomial methods,\nand show how it works by applying it to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system in one\nspatial dimension. As an example, we track a relative periodic orbit through a\nsequence of bifurcations to the onset of chaos. Within the symmetry-reduced\nstate space we are able to compute and visualize the unstable manifolds of\nrelative periodic orbits, their torus bifurcations, a transition to chaos via\ntorus breakdown, and heteroclinic connections between various relative periodic\norbits. It would be very hard to carry through such analysis in the full state\nspace, without a symmetry reduction such as the one we present here.\n", "  A quantum time crystal (QTC) is a novel quantum mechanical ground state that\nwas recently proposed by Wilczek. Although many QTC models have been proposed,\nit is not clear yet if such states are possible. We propose the idea that an\nincommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) forms a quantum space crystal (QSC),\nwhich is an extension of a QTC in the spatial domain. Consequently, a rotating\nring-shaped ICDW naturally forms a quantum space-time crystal (QSTC), which\ncombines the two concepts of QTC and QSC. The breaking of space-time\ntranslation symmetry is understood using time-dependent density matrices.\nFurthermore, we show that this model can be observed in real systems such as\nTaS$_3$ ring crystals at finite temperature. Our results suggest that QTC/QSTC\ncan exist.\n", "  We address the Riemann and Cauchy problems for systems of $n$ conservation\nlaws in $m$ unknowns which are subject to $m-n$ constraints ($m\\geq n$). Such\nconstrained systems generalize systems of conservation laws in standard form to\ninclude various examples of conservation laws in Physics and Engineering beyond\ngas dynamics, e.g., multi-phase flow in porous media. We prove local\nwell-posedness of the Riemann problem and global existence of the Cauchy\nproblem for initial data with sufficiently small total variation, in one\nspatial dimension. The key to our existence theory is to generalize the\n$m\\times n$ systems of constrained conservation laws to $n\\times n$ systems of\nconservation laws with states taking values in an $n$-dimensional manifold and\nto extend Lax's theory for local existence as well as Glimm's random choice\nmethod to our geometric framework. Our resulting existence theory allows for\nthe accumulation function to be non-invertible across hypersurfaces.\n", "  The case of the planar circular restricted three-body problem is used as a\ntest field in order to determine the character of the orbits of a small body\nwhich moves under the gravitational influence of the two heavy primary bodies.\nWe conduct a thorough numerical analysis on the phase space mixing by\nclassifying initial conditions of orbits and distinguishing between three types\nof motion: (i) bounded, (ii) escape and (iii) collisional. The presented\noutcomes reveal the high complexity of this dynamical system. Furthermore, our\nnumerical analysis shows a remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries\nalong all the escape regimes. Interpreting the collisional motion as leaking in\nthe phase space we related our results to both chaotic scattering and the\ntheory of leaking Hamiltonian systems. We also determined the escape and\ncollisional basins and computed the corresponding escape/collisional times. We\nhope our contribution to be useful for a further understanding of the escape\nand collisional mechanism of orbits in the restricted three-body problem.\n", "  We reveal the escape mechanism of orbits in a Hamiltonian system with four\nexit channels composed of two-dimensional perturbed harmonic oscillators. We\ndistinguish between trapped chaotic, non-escaping regular and escaping orbits\nby conducting a thorough and systematic numerical investigation in both the\nconfiguration and the phase space. We locate the different basins of escape and\nwe relate them withe the corresponding escape times of orbits. The SALI method\nis used for determining the ordered or chaotic nature of the orbits. It was\nobserved that trapped and non-escaping orbits coexist with several escape\nbasins. When the energy is very close to the escape energy the escape rate of\norbits is huge, while as the value of the energy increases the orbits escape\nmore quickly to infinity. Furthermore, initial conditions of orbits located\nnear the boundaries of the basins of escape and also in the vicinity of the\nfractal domains were found to posses the largest escape rates. The degree of\nthe fractality of the phase space was calculated as a function of the value of\nthe energy. Our results were compared with earlier related work.\n", "  We explore the escape dynamics in open Hamiltonian systems with multiple\nchannels of escape continuing the work initiated in Part I. A thorough\nnumerical investigation is conducted distinguishing between trapped (ordered\nand chaotic) and escaping orbits. The determination of the location of the\nbasins of escape towards the different escape channels and their correlations\nwith the corresponding escape periods of the orbits is undoubtedly an issue of\nparamount importance. We consider four different cases depending on the\nperturbation function which controls the number of escape channels on the\nconfiguration space. In every case, we computed extensive samples of orbits in\nboth the configuration and the phase space by numerically integrating the\nequations of motion as well as the variational equations. It was found that in\nall examined cases regions of non-escaping motion coexist with several basins\nof escape. The larger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial\nconditions in the vicinity of the fractal structure, while the lowest escape\nrates belong to orbits with initial conditions inside the basins of escape. In\naddition, we related the model potential with applications in the field of\nreactive multichannel scattering. We hope that our numerical analysis will be\nuseful for a further understanding of the escape mechanism of orbits in open\nHamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom.\n", "  We analyse numerically the effects of small population size in the initial\ntransient regime of a simple example population dynamics. These effects play an\nimportant role for the numerical determination of large deviation functions of\nadditive observables for stochastic processes. A method commonly used in order\nto determine such functions is the so-called cloning algorithm which in its\nnon-constant population version essentially reduces to the determination of the\ngrowth rate of a population, averaged over many realizations of the dynamics.\nHowever, the averaging of populations is highly dependent not only on the\nnumber of realizations of the population dynamics, and on the initial\npopulation size but also on the cut-off time (or population) considered to stop\ntheir numerical evolution. This may result in an over-influence of discreteness\neffects at initial times, caused by small population size. We overcome these\neffects by introducing a (realization-dependent) time delay in the evolution of\npopulations, additional to the discarding of the initial transient regime of\nthe population growth where these discreteness effects are strong. We show that\nthe improvement in the estimation of the large deviation function comes\nprecisely from these two main contributions.\n", "  The case of the planar circular photogravitational restricted three-body\nproblem where the more massive primary is an emitter of radiation is\nnumerically investigated. A thorough numerical analysis takes place in the\nconfiguration $(x,y)$ and the $(x,C)$ space in which we classify initial\nconditions of orbits into three main categories: (i) bounded, (ii) escaping and\n(iii) collisional. Our results reveal that the radiation pressure factor has a\nhuge impact on the character of orbits. Interpreting the collisional motion as\nleaking in the phase space we related our results to both chaotic scattering\nand the theory of leaking Hamiltonian systems. We successfully located the\nescape as well as the collisional basins and we managed to correlate them with\nthe corresponding escape and collision times. We hope our contribution to be\nuseful for a further understanding of the escape and collision properties of\nmotion in this interesting version of the restricted three-body problem.\n", "  We numerically investigate the orbital dynamics of a spacecraft, or a comet,\nor an asteroid in the Pluto-Charon system in a scattering region around Charon\nusing the planar circular restricted three-body problem. The test particle can\nmove in bounded orbits around Charon or escape through the necks around the\nLagrangian points $L_1$ and $L_2$ or even collide with the surface of Charon.\nWe explore four of the five possible Hill's regions configurations depending on\nthe value of the Jacobi constant which is of course related with the total\norbital energy. We conduct a thorough numerical analysis on the phase space\nmixing by classifying initial conditions of orbits and distinguishing between\nthree types of motion: (i) bounded, (ii) escaping and (iii) collisional. In\nparticular, we locate the different basins and we relate them with the\ncorresponding spatial distributions of the escape and collision times. Our\nresults reveal the high complexity of this planetary system. Furthermore, the\nnumerical analysis shows a strong dependence of the properties of the\nconsidered basins with the total orbital energy, with a remarkable presence of\nfractal basin boundaries along all the regimes. Our results are compared with\nearlier ones regarding the Saturn-Titan planetary system.\n", "  As the generation of squeezed states of light has become a standard technique\nin laboratories, attention is increasingly directed towards adapting the\noptical parameters of squeezed beams to the specific requirements of individual\napplications. It is known that imaging, metrology, and quantum information may\nbenefit from using squeezed light with a tailored transverse spatial mode.\nHowever, experiments have so far been limited to generating only a few squeezed\nspatial modes within a given setup. Here, we present the generation of\nsingle-mode squeezing in Laguerre-Gauss and Bessel-Gauss modes, as well as an\narbitrary intensity pattern, all from a single setup using a spatial light\nmodulator (SLM). The degree of squeezing obtained is limited mainly by the\ninitial squeezing and diffractive losses introduced by the SLM, while no excess\nnoise from the SLM is detectable at the measured sideband. The experiment\nillustrates the single-mode concept in quantum optics and demonstrates the\nviability of current SLMs as flexible tools for the spatial reshaping of\nsqueezed light.\n", "  In this work, we show that the inverse-$\\lambda$ shape in the fundamental\ndiagram of traffic flow can be produced dynamically by a simple nonlinear\nmesoscopic model with stochastic noises. The proposed model is based on the\ngas-kinetic theory of the traffic system. In our approach, the nonlinearity\nleads to the coexistence of different traffic states. The scattering of the\ndata is thus attributed to the noise terms introduced in the stochastic\ndifferential equations and the transition among the various traffic states.\nMost importantly, the observed inverse-$\\lambda$ shape and the associated\nsudden jump of physical quantities arise due to the effect of stochastic noises\non the stability of the system. The model parameters are calibrated, and a\nqualitative agreement is obtained between the data and the numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  Colloidal photonic crystals display peculiar optical properties which make\nthem particularly suitable for application in different fields. However, the\nlow packing fraction of the targeted structures usually poses a real challenge\nin the fabrication stage. Here, we propose a novel route to colloidal photonic\ncrystals via a binary mixture of hard tetramers and hard spheres. By combining\ntheory and computer simulations, we calculate the phase diagram as well as the\nstacking diagram of the mixture, and show that a colloidal analogue of the\nMgCu2 Laves phase -- which can serve as a precursor of a photonic bandgap\nstructure -- is a thermodynamically stable phase in a large region of the phase\ndiagram. Our findings show a relatively large coexistence region between the\nfluid and the Laves phase, which is potentially accessible by experiments.\nFurthermore, we determine the sedimentation behaviour of the suggested mixture,\nby identifying several stacking sequences. Our work uncovers a new\nself-assembly path towards a photonic structure with a band gap in the visible\nregion.\n", "  We study the enhanced moduli space $\\textsf{T}$ of the Calabi-Yau $n$-folds\narising from Dwork family and describe a unique vector field $\\textsf{R}$ in\n$\\textsf{T}$ with certain properties with respect to the underlying Gauss-Manin\nconnection. For $n=1,2$ we compute explicit expressions of $\\textsf{R}$ and\ngive a solution of $\\textsf{R}$ in terms of quasi-modular forms.\n", "  The orbital dynamics of a spacecraft, or a comet, or an asteroid in the\nEarth-Moon system in a scattering region around the Moon using the three\ndimensional version of the circular restricted three-body problem is\nnumerically investigated. The test particle can move in bounded orbits around\nthe Moon or escape through the openings around the Lagrange points $L_1$ and\n$L_2$ or even collide with the surface of the Moon. We explore in detail the\nfirst four of the five possible Hill's regions configurations depending on the\nvalue of the Jacobi constant which is of course related with the total orbital\nenergy. We conduct a thorough numerical analysis on the phase space mixing by\nclassifying initial conditions of orbits in several two-dimensional types of\nplanes and distinguishing between four types of motion: (i) ordered bounded,\n(ii) trapped chaotic, (iii) escaping and (iv) collisional. In particular, we\nlocate the different basins and we relate them with the corresponding spatial\ndistributions of the escape and collision times. Our outcomes reveal the high\ncomplexity of this planetary system. Furthermore, the numerical analysis\nsuggests a strong dependence of the properties of the considered basins with\nboth the total orbital energy and the initial value of the $z$ coordinate, with\na remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries along all the regimes. Our\nresults are compared with earlier ones regarding the planar version of the\nEarth-Moon system.\n", "  We investigate in detail the escape dynamics in an analytical gravitational\nmodel which describes the motion of stars in a quasar galaxy with a disk and a\nmassive nucleus. We conduct a thorough numerical analysis distinguishing\nbetween regular and chaotic orbits as well as between trapped and escaping\norbits, considering only unbounded motion for several energy levels. In order\nto distinguish safely and with certainty between ordered and chaotic motion we\napply the Smaller ALingment Index (SALI) method. It is of particular interest\nto locate the escape basins through the openings around the collinear\nLagrangian points $L_1$ and $L_2$ and relate them with the corresponding\nspatial distribution of the escape times of the orbits.

Our numerical analysis reveals the strong dependence of\nthe properties of the considered escape basins with the total orbital energy,\nwith a remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries along all the escape\nregimes. We hope our outcomes to be useful for a further understanding of the\nescape mechanism in active galaxy models.\n", "  The escape dynamics in an analytical gravitational model which describes the\nmotion of stars in a binary system of interacting dwarf spheroidal galaxies is\ninvestigated in detail.

Our numerical analysis reveals the strong dependence of\nthe properties of the considered escape basins with the total orbital energy,\nwith a remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries along all the escape\nregimes. It was also observed, that for energy levels close to the critical\nescape energy the escape rates of orbits are large, while for much higher\nvalues of energy most of the orbits have low escape periods or they escape\nimmediately to infinity. We hope our outcomes to be useful for a further\nunderstanding of the escape mechanism in binary galaxy models.\n", "  We investigate the universality class of the finite-temperature phase\ntransition of the two-dimensional Ising model with the algebraically decaying\nferromagnetic long-range interaction, $J_{ij} = |\\vec{r}_i\n-\\vec{r}_j|^{-(d+\\sigma)}$, where $d$ (=2) is the dimension of the system and\n$\\sigma$ the decay exponent, by means of the order-$N$ cluster-algorithm Monte\nCarlo method. In particular, we focus on the upper and lower critical decay\nexponents, the boundaries between the mean-field-universality, intermediate,\nand short-range-universality regimes. At the critical decay exponents, it is\nfound that the critical amplitude of the standard Binder ratio of magnetization\nexhibits the extremely slow convergence as a function of the system size. We\npropose more effective physical quantities, the combined Binder ratio and the\nself-combined Binder ratio, both of which cancel the leading finite-size\ncorrections of the conventional Binder ratio. Utilizing these techniques, we\nclearly demonstrate that in two dimensions the lower and upper critical decay\nexponents are $\\sigma = 1$ and 7/4, respectively, contrary to the recent Monte\nCarlo and the renormalization-group studies [M. Picco, arXiv:1207.1018; T.\nBlanchard, et al., Europhys. Lett. 101, 56003 (2013)].\n", "  We construct a new invariant-the trunkenness-for volume-perserving vector\nfields on S^3 up to volume-preserving diffeomorphism. We prove that the\ntrunkenness is independent from the helicity and that it is the limit of a knot\ninvariant (called the trunk) computed on long pieces of orbits.\n", "  In this article, we construct explicit analytical exact solutions to the six\nand higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. In all solutions, a subspace of\nthe metric is the Eguchi-Hanson space where the metric functions are completely\ndetermined in terms of known analytical functions. Moreover, we find the\nsolutions can be extended to non-stationary exact solutions to Einstein-Maxwell\ntheory with cosmological constant. We show that the solutions are\nasymptotically expanding patches of de-Sitter spacetime.\n", "  Across many scientific domains, there is a common need to automatically\nextract a simplified view or coarse-graining of how a complex system's\ncomponents interact. This general task is called community detection in\nnetworks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data.\nIt is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by\ntheir ability to find so-called \"ground truth\" communities. This works well in\nsynthetic networks with planted communities because such networks' links are\nformed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no\nplanted communities in real world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to\ntreat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground\ntruth. Here, we show that metadata are not the same as ground truth, and that\ntreating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We\nprove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a\ngeneral No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there\ncan be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks.\nHowever, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still\nhave value so a careful exploration of their relationship with network\nstructure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by\nintroducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship\nbetween metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We\ndemonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and\nfor multiple types of metadata and community structure.\n", "  We generalize the recently introduced Density-Matrix Renormalization Group\n(DMRG-X) [Khemani et al, PRL 2016] algorithm to obtain Floquet eigenstates of\none-dimensional, periodically driven many-body localized systems. This\ngeneralization is made possible by the fact that the time-evolution operator\nfor a period can be efficiently represented using a matrix-product operator. We\nfirst benchmark the method by comparing to exact diagonalization for small\nsystems. We then obtain Floquet eigenstates for larger systems and show\nunambiguously that the characteristic area-law scaling remains robust.\n", "  We consider the planar circular equilateral restricted four body-problem\nwhere a test particle of infinitesimal mass is moving under the gravitational\nattraction of three primary bodies which move on circular orbits around their\ncommon center of gravity, such that their configuration is always an\nequilateral triangle. The case where all three primaries have equal masses is\nnumerically investigated. A thorough numerical analysis takes place in the\nconfiguration $(x,y)$ as well as in the $(x,C)$ space in which we classify\ninitial conditions of orbits into four main categories: (i) bounded regular\norbits, (ii) trapped chaotic orbits, (iii) escaping orbits and (iv) collision\norbits. Interpreting the collision motion as leaking in the phase space we\nrelated our results to both chaotic scattering and the theory of leaking\nHamiltonian systems. We successfully located the escape and the collision\nbasins and we managed to correlate them with the corresponding escape and\ncollision times of orbits. We hope our contribution to be useful for a further\nunderstanding of the escape and collision properties of motion in this\ninteresting dynamical system.\n", "  The escape dynamics in a two-dimensional multiwell potential is explored. A\nthorough numerical investigation is conducted in several types of\ntwo-dimensional planes and also in a three-dimensional subspace of the entire\nfour-dimensional phase space in order to distinguish between non-escaping\n(ordered and chaotic) and escaping orbits. The determination of the location of\nthe basins of escape towards the different escape channels and their\ncorrelations with the corresponding escape time of the orbits is undoubtedly an\nissue of paramount importance. It was found that in all examined cases regions\nof non-escaping motion coexist with several basins of escape. Furthermore, we\nmonitor how the percentages of all types of orbits evolve when the total\norbital energy varies. The larger escape periods have been measured for orbits\nwith initial conditions in the fractal basin boundaries, while the lowest\nescape rates belong to orbits with initial conditions inside the basins of\nescape. The Newton-Raphson basins of attraction of the equilibrium points of\nthe system have also been determined. We hope that our numerical analysis will\nbe useful for a further understanding of the escape mechanism of orbits in open\nHamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom.\n", "  Dicke's original thought experiment with two spins coupled to a photon mode\nhas recently been experimentally realized. We propose extending this experiment\nto N spins and show that it naturally gives rise to highly entangled states. In\nparticular, it gives rise to dark states which have resonating valence bond\n(RVB) character. We first consider a system of N two level spins in a cavity\nwith only one spin in the excited state. This initial state is a linear\ncombination of a dark state and a bright state. We point out the dark state is\na coherent superposition of singlets with resonating valence bond character. We\nshow that the coupling to the photon mode takes the spin system into a mixed\nstate with an entangled density matrix. We next consider an initial state with\nhalf of the spins in the excited state. We show that there is a non-zero\nprobability for this to collapse into a dark state with RVB character. In the\nlossy cavity limit, if no photon is detected within several decay time periods,\nwe may deduce that the spin system has collapsed onto the dark RVB state. We\nshow that the probability for this scales as 2/N, making it possible to\ngenerate RVB states of 20 spins or more.\n", "  Under certain conditions, it takes a shorter time to cool a hot system than\nto cool the same system initiated at a lower temperature. This phenomenon - the\n\"Mpemba Effect\" - is well known in water, and has recently been observed in\nother systems as well. However, there is no single generic mechanism that\nexplains this counter-intuitive behavior. Using the theoretical framework of\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics, we present a widely applicable mechanism for\nthis effect, derive a sufficient condition for its appearance in Markovian\ndynamics, and predict an inverse Mpemba effect in heating: under proper\nconditions, a cold system can heat up faster than the same system initiated at\na higher temperature. Our results suggest that it should be possible to observe\nthe Mpemba effect and its inverse in a variety of systems, where they have\nnever been demonstrated before.\n", "  We prove a quantitative unique continuation principle for infinite\ndimensional spectral subspaces of Schr\\\"odinger operators. Let $\\Lambda_L =\n(-L/2,L/2)^d$ and $H_L = -\\Delta_L + V_L$ be a Schr\\\"odinger operator on $L^2\n(\\Lambda_L)$ with a bounded potential $V_L : \\Lambda_L \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ and\nDirichlet, Neumann, or periodic boundary conditions. Our main result is of the\ntype\n  \\[\n  \\int_{\\Lambda_L} \\lvert \\phi \\rvert^2 \\leq C_{\\mathrm{sfuc}} \\int_{W_\\delta\n(L)} \\lvert \\phi \\rvert^2,\n  \\] where $\\phi$ is an infinite complex linear combination of eigenfunctions\nof $H_L$ with exponentially decaying coefficients, $W_\\delta (L)$ is some union\nof equidistributed $\\delta$-balls in $\\Lambda_L$ and $C_{\\mathrm{sfuc}} > 0$ an\n$L$-independent constant. The exponential decay condition on $\\phi$ can\nalternatively be formulated as an exponential decay condition of the map\n$\\lambda \\mapsto \\lVert \\chi_{[\\lambda , \\infty)} (H_L) \\phi \\rVert^2$. The\nnovelty is that at the same time we allow the function $\\phi$ to be from an\ninfinite dimensional spectral subspace and keep an explicit control over the\nconstant $C_{\\mathrm{sfuc}}$ in terms of the parameters. Moreover, we show that\na similar result cannot hold under a polynomial decay condition.\n", "  We consider harmonic Toeplitz operators $T_V = PV:{\\mathcal H}(\\Omega) \\to\n{\\mathcal H}(\\Omega)$ where $P: L^2(\\Omega) \\to {\\mathcal H}(\\Omega)$ is the\northogonal projection onto ${\\mathcal H}(\\Omega) = \\left\\{u \\in\nL^2(\\Omega)\\,|\\,\\Delta u = 0 \\; \\mbox{in}\\;\\Omega\\right\\}$, $\\Omega \\subset\n{\\mathbb R}^d$, $d \\geq 2$, is a bounded domain with $\\partial \\Omega \\in\nC^\\infty$, and $V: \\Omega \\to {\\mathbb C}$ is a suitable multiplier. First, we\ncomplement the known criteria which guarantee that $T_V$ is in the $p$th\nSchatten-von Neumann class $S_p$, by sufficient conditions which imply $T_V \\in\nS_{p, {\\rm w}}$, the weak counterpart of $S_p$. Next, we assume that $\\Omega$\nis the unit ball in ${\\mathbb R}^d$, and $V = \\overline{V}$ is radially\nsymmetric, and investigate the eigenvalue asymptotics of $T_V$ if $V$ has a\npower-like decay at $\\partial \\Omega$ or $V$ is compactly supported in\n$\\Omega$. Further, we consider general $\\Omega$ and $V \\geq 0$ which is regular\nin $\\Omega$, and admits a power-like decay of rate $\\gamma > 0$ at $\\partial\n\\Omega$, and we show that in this case $T_V$ is unitarily equivalent to a\npseudo-differential operator of order $-\\gamma$, self-adjoint in $L^2(\\partial\n\\Omega)$. Using this unitary equivalence, we obtain the main asymptotic term of\nthe eigenvalue counting function for the operator $T_V$. Finally, we introduce\nthe Krein Laplacian $K \\geq 0$, self-adjoint in $L^2(\\Omega)$; it is known that\n${\\rm Ker}\\,K = {\\mathcal H}(\\Omega)$, and the zero eigenvalue of $K$ is\nisolated. We perturb $K$ by $V \\in C(\\overline{\\Omega};{\\mathbb R})$, and show\nthat $\\sigma_{\\rm ess}(K+V) = V(\\partial \\Omega)$. Assuming that $V \\geq 0$ and\n$V{|\\partial \\Omega} = 0$, we study the asymptotic distribution of the\neigenvalues of $K \\pm V$ near the origin, and find that the effective\nHamiltonian which governs this distribution is the Toeplitz operator $T_V$.\n", "  The cross section for the production of single top quarks in the t channel is\nmeasured in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the\nLHC. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 inverse\nfemtobarns. The event selection requires one muon and two jets where one of the\njets is identified as originating from a bottom quark. Several kinematic\nvariables are then combined into a multivariate discriminator to distinguish\nsignal from background events. A fit to the distribution of the discriminating\nvariable yields a total cross section of 238 +/- 13 (stat) +/- 29 (syst) pb and\na ratio of top quark and top antiquark production of R[t-ch.] = 1.81 +/- 0.18\n(stat) +/- 0.15 (syst). From the total cross section the absolute value of the\nCKM matrix element V[tb] is calculated to be 1.05 +/- 0.07 (exp) +/- 0.02\n(theo). All results are in agreement with the standard model predictions.\n", "  We introduce the notion of the modular class of a Lie algebroid equipped with\na Nambu structure. In particular, we recover the modular class of a\nNambu-Poisson manifold $M$ with its Nambu tensor $\\Lambda$ as the modular class\nof the tangent Lie algebroid $TM$ with Nambu structure $\\Lambda.$ We show that\nmany known properties of the modular class of a Nambu-Poisson manifold that of\na Lie algebropid extend to the setting of a Lie algebroid with Nambu structure.\nFinally, we prove that for a large class of Nambu-Poisson manifolds considered\nas tangent Lie algebroids with Nambu structures, the associated modular classes\nare closely related to Evens-Lu-Weinstein modular classes of Lie algebroids.\n", "  Quantum mechanical systems lose coherence through interactions with external\nenvironments---a process known as decoherence. Although decoherence is\ndetrimental for most of the tasks in quantum information processing, a\nsubstantial degree of decoherence is crucial for boosting the efficiency of\nquantum processes, for example, in quantum biology. The key to the success in\nsimulating those open quantum systems is therefore the ability of controlling\ndecoherence, instead of eliminating it. Here we focus on the problem of\nsimulating quantum open systems with Nitrogen-Vacancy centers, which has become\nan increasingly important platform for quantum information processing tasks.\nEssentially, we developed a new set of steering pulse sequences for controlling\nvarious coherence times of Nitrogen-Vacancy centers; our method is based on a\nhybrid approach that exploits ingredients in both digital and analog quantum\nsimulations to dynamically couple or decouple the system with the physical\nenvironment. Our numerical simulations, based on experimentally-feasible\nparameters, indicate that decoherence of Nitrogen-Vacancy centers can be\ncontrolled externally to a very large extend.\n", "  We explore the possibility of achieving a significant nonlinear phase shift\namong photons propagating in nanoscale waveguides exploiting interactions among\nphotons that are mediated by vibrational modes and induced through Stimulated\nBrillouin Scattering (SBS). We introduce a configuration that allows slowing\ndown the photons by several orders of magnitude via SBS involving sound waves\nand two pump fields. We extract the conditions for maintaining vanishing\namplitude gain or loss for slowly propagating photons while keeping the\ninfluence of thermal phonons to the minimum. The nonlinear phase among two\ncounter-propagating photons can be used to realize a deterministic phase gate.\n", "  We investigate in this paper the structures of neutron stars under the strong\nmagnetic field in the framework of $f(T)$ gravity where $T$ denotes the scalar\ntorsion. The TOV equations in this theory of gravity have been considered and\nnumerical resolution of these equations has been performed within perturbative\napproach taking into account the equation of state of neutron dense matter in\nmagnetic field. We simplify the problem by considering the very strong magnetic\nfield which affects considerably the dense matter; and for quadratic and cubic\ncorrections to Teleparallel term, one finds that the mass of neutron stars can\nincrease for different values of the perturbation parameter. The deviation from\nTeleparallel for different values of magnetic field is found out and this\nfeature is very appreciable in the case of cubic correction. Our results are\nrelated to the hadronic particles description with very small hyperon\ncontributions and the mass-radius evolution is consistency with the\nobservational data.\n", "  Random planar graphs appear in a variety of context and it is important for\nmany different applications to be able to characterize their structure. Local\nquantities fail to give interesting information and it seems that path-related\nmeasures are able to convey relevant information about the organization of\nthese structures. In particular, nodes with a large betweenness centrality (BC)\ndisplay non-trivial patterns, such as central loops. We first discuss empirical\nresults for different random planar graphs and we then propose a toy model\nwhich allows us to discuss the condition for the emergence of non-trivial\npatterns such as central loops. This toy model is made of a star network with\n$N_b$ branches of size $n$ and links of weight $1$, superimposed to a loop at\ndistance $\\ell$ from the center and with links of weight $w$. We estimate for\nthis model the BC at the center and on the loop and we show that the loop can\nbe more central than the origin if $w<w_c$ where the threshold of this\ntransition scales as $w_c\\sim n/N_b$. In this regime, there is an optimal\nposition of the loop that scales as $\\ell_{opt}\\sim N_b w/4$. This simple model\nsheds some light on the organization of these random structures and allows us\nto discuss the effect of randomness on the centrality of loops. In particular,\nit suggests that the number and the spatial extension of radial branches are\nthe crucial ingredients that control the existence of central loops.\n", "  We find a relationship between the dynamics of the Gaussian wave packet and\nthe dynamics of the corresponding Gaussian Wigner function from the\nHamiltonian/symplectic point of view. The main result states that the momentum\nmap corresponding to the natural action of the symplectic group on the Siegel\nupper half space yields the covariance matrix of the corresponding Gaussian\nWigner function. This fact, combined with Kostant's coadjoint orbit covering\ntheorem, establishes a symplectic/Poisson-geometric connection between the two\ndynamics. The Hamiltonian formulation naturally gives rise to corrections to\nthe potential terms in the dynamics of both the wave packet and the Wigner\nfunction, thereby resulting in slightly different sets of equations from the\nconventional classical ones. We numerically investigate the effect of the\ncorrection term and demonstrate that it improves the accuracy of the dynamics\nas an approximation to the dynamics of expectation values of observables.\n", "  Massively parallel simulations of transport equation systems call for a\nparadigm change in algorithm development to achieve efficient scalability.\nTraditional approaches require time synchronization of processing elements\n(PEs) which severely restricts scalability. Relaxing synchronization\nrequirement introduces error and slows down convergence. In this paper, we\npropose and develop a novel `proxy-equation' concept for a general transport\nequation that (i) tolerates asynchrony with manageable added error, (ii)\npreserves convergence order and (iii) scales efficiently on massively parallel\nmachines. The central idea is to modify \\textit{a priori} the transport\nequation at the PE boundaries to offset asynchrony errors. Proof-of-concept\ncomputations are performed using a one-dimensional advection-diffusion\nequation. The results demonstrate the promise and advantages of the present\nstrategy.\n", "  Ilya Schmelzer wrote recently: {\\it Nieuwenhuizen argued that there exists\nsome \"contextuality loophole\" in Bell's theorem. This claim in unjustified}. It\nis made clear that this arose from attaching a meaning to the title and the\ncontent of the paper different from the one intended by Nieuwenhuizen.\n\"Contextual loophole\" means only that if the supplementary parameters\ndescribing measuring instruments are correctly introduced, Bell and Bell-type\ninequalities may not be proven. It is also stressed that a hidden variable\nmodel suffers from a \"contextuality loophole\" if it tries to describe different\nsets of incompatible experiments using a unique probability space and a unique\njoint probability distribution.\n", "  We present, within Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory calculations, a\nquantitative method to identify and assess the partitioning of a large quantum\nmechanical system into fragments. We then show how within this framework simple\ngeneralizations of other well-known population analyses can be used to extract,\nfrom first principles, reliable electrostatic multipoles for the identified\nfragments. Our approach reduces arbitrariness in the fragmentation procedure,\nand enables the possibility to assess, quantitatively, whether the\ncorresponding fragment multipoles can be interpreted as observable quantities\nassociated to a system's moiety. By applying our formalism within the code\nBigDFT, we show that the use of a minimal set of in-situ optimized basis\nfunctions allows at the same time a proper fragment definition and an accurate\ndescription of the electronic structure.\n", "  Frustrated quantum magnets pose well-defined questions concerning quantum\nfluctuation effects and the nature of the many-body wavefunction, which\nchallenge theory, numerics, experiment and materials synthesis. The S = 1/2\ntriangular-lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) presents a case where classical order\nis strongly suppressed by quantum fluctuations, leading to extensive\nrenormalization of physical properties at all energy scales. However, purely\ntwo-dimensional (2D) models are difficult to realise in the 3D world and their\nphysics is controlled by the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which describes the\ndominant effects of additional thermal fluctuations. Here we report the\nmagnetic properties Ba8CoNb6O24, whose Co2+ions have an effective spin 1/2 and\nconstruct a regular TLAF with very large interlayer spacing. We find no\nmagnetic ordering down to 0.028 K, strong low-energy spin fluctuations in\nqualitative agreement with theoretical analysis and a diverging correlation\nlength, all indicating a Mermin-Wagner trend towards zero-temperature ordering\nin this ideal 2D system.\n", "  The Raman scattering spectra (RS) of two series of monolayer graphene samples\nirradiated with various doses of C$^{+}$ and Xe$^{+}$ ions were measured after\nannealing in high vacuum, and in forming gas (95\\%Ar+5\\%H$_{2}$). It was found\nthat these methods of annealing have dramatically different influence on the RS\nlines. Annealing in vacuum below 500$^{\\circ}$C leads to significant decrease\nof both D-line, associated with defects, and 2D-line, associated with the\nintact lattice structure, which can be explained by annealing-induced enhanced\ndoping. Further annealing in vacuum up to 1000$^{\\circ}$C leads to significant\nincrease of 2D-line together with continuous decrease of D-line, which gives\nevidence of partial removal of defects and recovery of the damaged lattice.\nAnnealing in forming gas is less effective in this sense. The blue shift of all\nlines is observed after annealing. It is shown that below 500$^{\\circ}$C, the\nunintentional doping is the main mechanism of shift, while at higher annealing\ntemperatures, the lattice strain dominates due to mismatch of the thermal\nexpansion coefficient of graphene and the SiO$_{2}$ substrate. Inhomogeneous\ndistribution of stress and doping across the samples leads to the correlated\nvariation of the amplitude and the peak position of RS lines.\n", "  We introduce a toolbox for the quantum simulation of superluminal motion with\nsuperconducting circuits. We show that it is possible to simulate the motion of\na superconducting qubit at constant velocities that exceed the speed of light\nin the electromagnetic medium and the subsequent emission of Ginzburg\nradiation. We consider as well possible setups for simulating the superluminal\nmotion of a mirror, finding a link with the superradiant phase transition of\nthe Dicke model.\n", "  A doubly-peaked quasar microlensing event in the lensed Twin Quasar Q0957+561\nA,B (Colley and Schild 2003) is analysed within several lensing models. In the\nmost realistic model a lens resolves in image B the ellipse shaped, bright\ninner rim of the quasar's accretion disk, intersecting it twice. This lens\nweighs 0.5 Earth mass and is located inside the Galaxy, at 3 kpc distance.\nDuring the passing, it partially occults the source, which allows to describe\nit as a primordial gas cloud of 1.4 Solar radius and 17 K temperature, in\naccordance with the theory of Gravitational Hydrodynamics. Lensing by such\nobjects against the Magellanic Clouds and Galactic centre will also lead to\noccultation dips.\n", "  The control of recently observed spintronic effects in\ntopological-insulator/ferromagnetic-metal (TI/FM) heterostructures is thwarted\nby the lack of understanding of band structure and spin texture around their\ninterfaces. Here we combine density functional theory with Green's function\ntechniques to obtain the spectral function at any plane passing through atoms\nof Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Co or Cu layers comprising the interface. In contrast to\nwidely assumed but thinly tested Dirac cone gapped by the proximity exchange\nfield, we find that the Rashba ferromagnetic model describes the spectral\nfunction on the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ in contact with Co near the Fermi level\n$E_F^0$, where circular and snowflake-like constant energy contours coexist\naround which spin locks to momentum. The remnant of the Dirac cone is\nhybridized with evanescent wave functions injected by metallic layers and\npushed, due to charge transfer from Co or Cu layers, few tenths of eV below\n$E_F^0$ for both Bi$_2$Se$_3$/Co and Bi$_2$Se$_3$/Cu interfaces while hosting\ndistorted helical spin texture wounding around a single circle. These features\nexplain recent observation [K. Kondou {\\em et al.}, Nat. Phys. {\\bf 12}, 1027\n(2016)] of sensitivity of spin-to-charge conversion signal at TI/Cu interface\nto tuning of $E_F^0$. Interestingly, three monolayers of Co adjacent to\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ host spectral functions very different from the bulk metal, as\nwell as in-plane spin textures signifying the spin-orbit proximity effect. We\npredict that out-of-plane tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance in vertical\nheterostructure Cu/Bi$_2$Se$_3$/Co, where current flowing perpendicular to its\ninterfaces is modulated by rotating magnetization from parallel to orthogonal\nto current flow, can serve as a sensitive probe of spin texture residing at\n$E_F^0$.\n", "  We extend the list of theories featuring a rigorous interacting ultraviolet\nfixed point by constructing the first theory featuring a Higgs-like scalar with\ngauge, Yukawa and quartic interactions. We show that the theory enters a\nperturbative asymptotically safe regime at energies above a physical scale\n$\\Lambda$. We determine the salient properties of the theory and use it as a\nconcrete example to test whether scalars masses unavoidably receive quantum\ncorrection of order $\\Lambda$. Having at our dispose a calculable model\nallowing us to precisely relate the IR and UV of the theory we demonstrate that\nthe scalars can be lighter than $\\Lambda$. Although we do not have an answer to\nwhether the Standard Model hypercharge coupling growth towards a Landau pole at\naround $\\Lambda \\sim 10^{40}$ GeV can be tamed by non-perturbative asymptotic\nsafety, our results indicate that such a possibility is worth exploring. In\nfact, if successful, it might also offer an explanation for the unbearable\nlightness of the Higgs.\n", "  Observations show that luminous blue variables (LBVs) are far more dispersed\nthan massive O-type stars, and Smith & Tombleson suggested that these large\nseparations are inconsistent with a single-star evolution model of LBVs.\nInstead, they suggested that the large distances are most consistent with\nbinary evolution scenarios. To test these suggestions, we modelled young\nstellar clusters and their passive dissolution, and we find that, indeed, the\nstandard single-star evolution model is mostly inconsistent with the observed\nLBV environments. If LBVs are single stars, then the lifetimes inferred from\ntheir luminosity and mass are far too short to be consistent with their extreme\nisolation. This implies that there is either an inconsistency in the\nluminosity- to-mass mapping or the mass-to-age mapping. In this paper, we\nexplore binary solutions that modify the mass-to-age mapping and are consistent\nwith the isolation of LBVs. For the binary scenarios, our crude models suggest\nthat LBVs are rejuvenated stars. They are either the result of mergers or they\nare mass gainers and received a kick when the primary star exploded. In the\nmerger scenario, if the primary is about 19 solar masses, then the binary has\nenough time to wander far afield, merge and form a rejuvenated star. In the\nmass-gainer and kick scenario, we find that LBV isolation is consistent with a\nwide range of kick velocities, anywhere from 0 to ~ 105 km/s. In either\nscenario, binarity seems to play a major role in the isolation of LBVs.\n", "  Ultracold atoms in optical lattices offer a unique platform for investigating\ndisorder-driven phenomena. While static disordered site potentials have been\nexplored in a number of optical lattice experiments, a more general control\nover site-energy and off-diagonal tunneling disorder has been lacking. The use\nof atomic quantum states as \"synthetic dimensions\" has introduced the\nspectroscopic, site-resolved control necessary to engineer new, more tailored\nrealizations of disorder. Here, by controlling laser-driven dynamics of atomic\npopulation in a momentum-space lattice, we extend the range of\nsynthetic-dimension-based quantum simulation and present the first explorations\nof dynamical disorder and tunneling disorder in an atomic system. By applying\nstatic tunneling phase disorder to a one-dimensional lattice, we observe\nballistic quantum spreading as in the case of uniform tunneling. When the\napplied disorder fluctuates on timescales comparable to intersite tunneling, we\ninstead observe diffusive atomic transport, signaling a crossover from quantum\nto classical expansion dynamics. We compare these observations to the case of\nstatic site-energy disorder, where we directly observe quantum localization in\nthe momentum-space lattice.\n", "  We study single commodity network flows with suitable robustness and\nefficiency specs. An original use of a maximum entropy problem for\ndistributions on the paths of the graph turns this problem into a steering\nproblem for Markov chains with prescribed initial and final marginals. From a\ncomputational standpoint, viewing scheduling this way is especially attractive\nin light of the existence of an iterative algorithm to compute the solution.\nThe present paper builds on [13] by introducing an index of efficiency of a\ntransportation plan and points, accordingly, to efficient-robust transport\npolicies. In developing the theory, we establish two new invariance properties\nof the solution (called bridge) - an iterated bridge invariance property and\nthe invariance of the most probable paths. These properties, which were\ntangentially mentioned in our previous work, are fully developed here. We also\nshow that the distribution on paths of the optimal transport policy, which\ndepends on a \"temperature\" parameter, tends to the solution of the \"most\neconomical\" but possibly less robust optimal mass transport problem as the\ntemperature goes to zero. The relevance of all of these properties for\ntransport over networks is illustrated in an example.\n", "  The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment will search for dark matter particle\ninteractions with a detector containing a total of 10 tonnes of liquid xenon\nwithin a double-vessel cryostat. The large mass and proximity of the cryostat\nto the active detector volume demand the use of material with extremely low\nintrinsic radioactivity. We report on the radioassay campaign conducted to\nidentify suitable metals, the determination of factors limiting radiopure\nproduction, and the selection of titanium for construction of the LZ cryostat\nand other detector components. This titanium has been measured with activities\nof $^{238}$U$_{e}$~$<$1.6~mBq/kg, $^{238}$U$_{l}$~$<$0.09~mBq/kg,\n$^{232}$Th$_{e}$~$=0.28\\pm 0.03$~mBq/kg, $^{232}$Th$_{l}$~$=0.25\\pm\n0.02$~mBq/kg, $^{40}$K~$<$0.54~mBq/kg, and $^{60}$Co~$<$0.02~mBq/kg (68\\% CL).\nSuch low intrinsic activities, which are some of the lowest ever reported for\ntitanium, enable its use for future dark matter and other rare event searches.\nMonte Carlo simulations have been performed to assess the expected background\ncontribution from the LZ cryostat with this radioactivity. In 1,000 days of\nWIMP search exposure of a 5.6-tonne fiducial mass, the cryostat will contribute\nonly a mean background of $0.160\\pm0.001$(stat)$\\pm0.030$(sys) counts.\n", "  The decay $b\\to s\\nu\\bar\\nu$ has been a neglected sibling of $b\\to\ns\\ell^+\\ell^-$ because neutrinos pass undetected and hence the process offers\nless number of observables. We show how the decay $b\\to s~+$~invisible(s) can\nshed light, even with a limited number of observables, on possible new physics\nbeyond the Standard Model and also show, quantitatively, the reach of future\n$B$ factories like SuperBelle to uncover such new physics. Depending on the\noperator structure of new physics, different channels may act as the best\npossible probe. We show, using the Optimal Observable technique, how almost the\nentire parameter space allowed till now can successfully be probed at a high\nluminosity $B$ factory.\n", "  In this paper we construct the complete evolution of the universe driven by\nthe mass dimension one dark spinor called Elko, starting with inflation,\npassing by the matter dominated era and finishing with the recent accelerated\nexpansion. The dynamic of the fermionic Elko field with a symmetry breaking\ntype potential can reproduce all phases of the universe in a natural and\nelegant way. The dynamical equations in general case and slow roll conditions\nin the limit $H\\ll m_{pl}$ are also presented for the Elko system. Numerical\nanalysis for the number of e-foldings during inflation, energy density after\ninflation and for present time and also the actual size of the universe are in\ngood agreement with the standard model of cosmology. An interpretation of the\ninflationary phase as a result of Pauli exclusion principle is also possible if\nthe Elko field is treated as an average value of its quantum analogue.\n", "  An appealing feature of inflationary cosmology is the presence of a\nphase-space attractor, \"slow roll\", which washes out the dependence on initial\nfield velocities. We investigate the robustness of this property under\nbackreaction from quantum fluctuations using the stochastic inflation formalism\nin the phase-space approach. A Hamiltonian formulation of stochastic inflation\nis presented, where it is shown that the coarse-graining procedure - where\nwavelengths smaller than the Hubble radius are integrated out - preserves the\ncanonical structure of free fields. This means that different sets of canonical\nvariables give rise to the same probability distribution which clarifies the\nliterature with respect to this issue. The role played by the\nquantum-to-classical transition is also analysed and is shown to constrain the\ncoarse-graining scale. In the case of free fields, we find that quantum\ndiffusion is aligned in phase space with the slow-roll direction. This implies\nthat the classical slow-roll attractor is immune to stochastic effects and thus\ngeneralises to a stochastic attractor regardless of initial conditions, with a\nrelaxation time at least as short as in the classical system. For non-test\nfields or for test fields with non-linear self interactions however, quantum\ndiffusion and the classical slow-roll flow are misaligned. We derive a\ncondition on the coarse-graining scale so that observational corrections from\nthis misalignment are negligible at leading order in slow roll.\n", "  A systematic study of hadronic masses shows regular oscillations that can be\nfitted by a simple cosine function. This property can be observed when the\ndifference between adjacent masses of each family is plotted versus the mean\nmass. This symmetry of oscillation is also observed for the nuclear level\nmasses of given spin.\n", "  We show that time translation symmetry of a ring system with a macroscopic\nquantum ground state is broken by decoherence. In particular, we consider a\nring-shaped incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW ring) threaded by a\nfluctuating magnetic flux: the Caldeira-Leggett model is used to model the\nfluctuating flux as a bath of harmonic oscillators. We show that the charge\ndensity expectation value of a quantized ICDW ring coupled to its environment\noscillates periodically. The Hamiltonians considered in this model are time\nindependent unlike \"Floquet time crystals\" considered recently. Our model forms\na metastable quantum time crystal with a finite length in space and in time.\n", "  Boundaries in gauge field theories are known to be the locus of a wealth of\ninteresting phenomena, as illustrated for example by the holographic principle\nor by the AdS/CFT and bulk-boundary correspondences. In particular, it has been\nacknowledged for quite some time that boundaries can break gauge invariance,\nand thereby turn gauge degrees of freedom into physical ones. There is however\nno known systematic way of identifying these degrees of freedom and possible\nassociated boundary observables. Following recent work by Donnelly and Freidel,\nwe show that this can be achieved by extending the covariant Hamiltonian\nformalism so as to make it gauge-invariant under arbitrary large gauge\ntransformations. This can be done at the expense of extending the phase space\nby introducing new boundary fields, which in turn determine new boundary\nsymmetries and observables. We present the general framework behind this\nconstruction, and find the conditions under which it can be applied to an\narbitrary Lagrangian. By studying the examples of Abelian Chern-Simons theory\nand first order three-dimensional gravity, we then show that the new boundary\nobservables satisfy the known corresponding Kac-Moody affine algebras. This\nshows that this new extended phase space formulation does indeed properly\ndescribe the dynamical boundary degrees of freedom, and gives credit to the\nresults which have been previously derived in the case of diffeomorphism\nsymmetry. We expect that this systematic understanding of the boundary\nsymmetries will play a major role for the quantization of gravity in finite\nregions.\n", "  In shear flows at transitional Reynolds numbers, localized patches of\nturbulence, known as puffs, coexist with the laminar flow. Recently, Avila et\nal., Phys. Rev. Let. 110, 224502 (2013) discovered two spatially localized\nrelative periodic solutions for pipe flow, which appeared in a saddle-node\nbifurcation at low speeds. Combining slicing methods for continuous symmetry\nreduction with Poincar\\'e sections for the first time in a shear flow setting,\nwe compute and visualize the unstable manifold of the lower-branch solution and\nshow that it contains a heteroclinic connection to the upper branch solution.\nSurprisingly this connection even persists far above the bifurcation point and\nappears to mediate puff generation, providing a dynamical understanding of this\nphenomenon.\n", "  We study the Yang--Mills measure on the sphere with unitary structure group.\nIn the limit where the structure group has high dimension, we show that the\ntraces of loop holonomies converge in probability to a deterministic limit,\nwhich is known as the master field on the sphere. The values of the master\nfield on simple loops are expressed in terms of the solution of a variational\nproblem. We show that, given its values on simple loops, the master field is\ncharacterized on all loops of finite length by a system of differential\nequations, known as the Makeenko--Migdal equations. We obtain a number of\nfurther properties of the master field. On specializing to families of simple\nloops, our results identify the high-dimensional limit, in non-commutative\ndistribution, of the Brownian loop in the group of unitary matrices.\n", "  Weyl semimetals are materials where electrons behave effectively as a kind of\nmassless relativistic particles known asWeyl fermions. These particles occur in\ntwo flavours, or chiralities, and are subject to quantum anomalies, the\nbreaking of a conservation law by quantum fluctuations. For instance, the\nnumber of Weyl fermions of each chirality is not independently conserved in\nparallel electric and magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral anomaly.\nIn addition, an underlying curved spacetime provides a distinct contribution to\na chiral imbalance, an effect known as the mixed axial-gravitational anomaly,\nwhich remains experimentally elusive. However, the presence of a mixed\ngauge-gravitational anomaly has recently been tied to thermoelectrical\ntransport in a magnetic field, even in flat spacetime, opening the door to\nexperimentally probe such type of anomalies in Weyl semimetals. Using a\ntemperature gradient, we experimentally observe a positive longitudinal\nmagnetothermoelectric conductance (PMTC) in the Weyl semimetal NbP for\ncollinear temperature gradients and magnetic fields (DT || B) that vanishes in\nthe ultra quantum limit. This observation is consistent with the presence of a\nmixed axial-gravitational anomaly. Our work provides clear experimental\nevidence for the existence of a mixed axial-gravitational anomaly of Weyl\nfermions, an outstanding theoretical concept that has so far eluded\nexperimental detection.\n", "  Many proposed experiments involving topological insulators (TIs) require\nspatial control over time-reversal symmetry and chemical potential. We\ndemonstrate reconfigurable micron-scale optical control of both magnetization\n(which breaks time-reversal symmetry) and chemical potential in ferromagnetic\nthin films of Cr-(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ grown on SrTiO$_3$. By optically modulating\nthe coercivity of the films, we write and erase arbitrary patterns in their\nremanent magnetization, which we then image with Kerr microscopy. Additionally,\nby optically manipulating a space charge layer in the underlying SrTiO$_3$\nsubstrates, we control the local chemical potential of the films. This optical\ngating effect allows us to write and erase p-n junctions in the films, which we\nstudy with photocurrent microscopy. Both effects are persistent and may be\npatterned and imaged independently on a few-micron scale. Dynamic optical\ncontrol over both magnetization and chemical potential of a TI may be useful in\nefforts to understand and control the edge states predicted at magnetic domain\nwalls in quantum anomalous Hall insulators.\n", "  The Copenhagen problem where the primaries of equal masses are magnetic\ndipoles is used in order to determine the Newton-Raphson basins of attraction\nassociated with the equilibrium points. The parametric variation of the\nposition as well as of the stability of the Lagrange points are monitored when\nthe value of the ratio $\\lambda$ of the magnetic moments varies in predefined\nintervals. The regions on the configuration $(x,y)$ plane occupied by the\nbasins of convergence are revealed using the multivariate version of the\nNewton-Raphson iterative scheme. The correlations between the basins of\nattraction of the libration points and the corresponding number of iterations\nneeded for obtaining the desired accuracy are also illustrated. We perform a\nthorough and systematic numerical investigation by demonstrating how the\ndynamical quantity $\\lambda$ influences the shape, the geometry and also the\ndegree of fractality of the attracting domains. Our numerical results strongly\nindicate that the ratio $\\lambda$ is indeed a very influential parameter in the\nelectromagnetic binary system.\n", "  We employ a 3+1D anomalous hydrodynamics with initial condition generated by\nHIJING to simulate the chiral vortical effect and the chiral magnetic effect in\nheavy-ion collisions. This allows us to calculate the charge-dependent\ntwo-particle correlations with respect to the reaction plane at different\ncollision energies and centralities. We then compare the computed results with\nthe experimental data and give discussions on the possible background effects.\n", "  Recently, the leading soft gluon theorem with single soft emission was shown\nto be the Ward identity of a two dimensional $\\cal G$-Kac-Moody symmetry. In\nthis note, we show that the leading soft gluon theorem can be interpreted as\nthe Ward identity for the asymptotic symmetries of non-Abelian gauge theory. We\nfurther argue that the sub-leading soft gluon theorem can follow from the same\nsymmetry.\n", "  We consider the \"kinematics\" of spacelike congruences and apply them to a\nfamily of self-gravitating magnetic forcelines. Our aim is to investigate the\nconvergence and the possible focusing of these lines, as well as their rotation\nand shear deformation. In so going, we introduce a covariant 1+2 splitting of\nthe 3-dimensional space, parallel and orthogonal to the direction of the field\nlines. The convergence, or the divergence, of the latter is monitored by the\nassociated Raychaudhuri equation, which is obtained by propagating the spatial\ndivergence of a unitary spacelike vector along its own direction. Applied to a\nmagnetic vector, the resulting expression shows that, although the convergence\nof the magnetic forcelines is affected by the gravitational pull of all the\nother sources, it is unaffected by the field's own gravity, irrespective of how\nstrong the latter is. This rather counterintuitive result is entirely due to\nthe magnetic tension, namely to the negative pressure the field exerts parallel\nto its lines of force. In particular, the magnetic tension always cancels out\nthe field's energy-density input to the Raychaudhuri equation, leaving the\nlatter free of any direct magnetic-energy contribution. Similarly, the rotation\nand the shear deformation of the aforementioned forcelines are also unaffected\nby the magnetic input to the total gravitational energy. In a sense, the\nmagnetic lines do not seem to \"feel\" their own gravity no matter how strong the\nlatter may be.\n", "  Quantum integrable models display a rich variety of non-thermal excited\nstates with unusual properties. The most common way to probe them is by\nperforming a quantum quench, i.e., by letting a many-body initial state\nunitarily evolve with an integrable Hamiltonian. At late times, these systems\nare locally described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble with as many effective\ntemperatures as their local conserved quantities. The experimental measurement\nof this macroscopic number of temperatures remains elusive. Here we show that\nthey can be obtained by probing the dynamical structure factor of the system\nafter the quench and by employing a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem\nthat we provide. Our procedure allows us to completely reconstruct the\nstationary state of a quantum integrable system from state-of-the-art\nexperimental observations.\n", "  The paper considers a process of escape of classical particle from a\none-dimensional potential well by virtue of an external harmonic forcing. We\naddress a particular model of the infinite-range potential well that allows\nindependent adjustment of the well depth and of the frequency of small\noscillations. The problem can be conveniently reformulated in terms of\naction-angle variables. Further averaging provides a nontrivial conservation\nlaw for the slow flow. Thus, one can consider the problem in terms of averaged\ndynamics on primary 1:1 resonance manifold. This simplification allows\nefficient analytic exploration of the escape process, and yields a theoretical\nprediction for minimal forcing amplitude required for the escape, as a function\nof the excitation frequency. This function exhibits a single minimum for\ncertain intermediate frequency value. Numeric simulations are in complete\nqualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with the theoretical\npredictions.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate as an open quantum system in the framework of the quantum Brownian\nmotion model. We derive a generalized Langevin equation for the position of the\nimpurity. The Langevin equation is an integrodifferential equation that\ncontains a memory kernel and is driven by a colored noise. These result from\nconsidering the environment as given by the degrees of freedom of the quantum\ngas, and thus depend on its parameters, e.g. interaction strength between the\nbosons, temperature, etc. We study the role of the memory on the dynamics of\nthe impurity. When the impurity is untrapped, we find that it exhibits a\nsuper-diffusive behavior at long times. We find that back-flow in energy\nbetween the environment and the impurity occurs during evolution. When the\nparticle is trapped, we calculate the variance of the position and momentum to\ndetermine how they compare with the Heisenberg limit. One important result of\nthis paper is that we find position squeezing for the trapped impurity at long\ntimes. We determine the regime of validity of our model and the parameters in\nwhich these effects can be observed in realistic experiments.\n", "  A search for new phenomena in final states characterized by high jet\nmultiplicity, an isolated lepton (electron or muon) and either zero or at least\nthree $b$-tagged jets is presented. The search uses 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The dominant sources\nof background are estimated using parameterized extrapolations, based on\nobservables at medium jet multiplicity, to predict the $b$-tagged jet\nmultiplicity distribution at the higher jet multiplicities used in the search.\nNo significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is observed and 95%\nconfidence-level limits are extracted constraining four simplified models of\n$R$-parity-violating supersymmetry that feature either gluino or top-squark\npair production. The exclusion limits reach as high as 2.1 TeV in gluino mass\nand 1.2 TeV in top-squark mass in the models considered. In addition, an upper\nlimit is set on the cross-section for Standard Model $t\\bar{t}t\\bar{t}$\nproduction of 60 fb (6.5 $\\times$ the Standard Model prediction) at 95%\nconfidence level. Finally, model-independent limits are set on the contribution\nfrom new phenomena to the signal-region yields.\n", "  We obtain exact expressions for a general class of correlation functions in\nthe 1D quantum mechanical model described by the Schwarzian action, that arises\nas the low energy limit of the SYK model. The answer takes the form of an\nintegral of a momentum space amplitude obtained via a simple set of\ndiagrammatic rules. The derivation relies on the precise equivalence between\nthe 1D Schwarzian theory and a suitable large $c$ limit of 2D Virasoro CFT. The\nmapping from the 1D to the 2D theory is similar to the construction of\nkinematic space. We also compute the out-of-time ordered four point function.\nThe momentum space amplitude in this case contains an extra factor in the form\nof a crossing kernel, or R-matrix, given by a 6j-symbol of SU(1,1). We argue\nthat the R-matrix describes the gravitational scattering amplitude near the\nhorizon of an AdS${}_2$ black hole. Finally, we discuss the generalization of\nsome of our results to ${\\cal N}=1$ and ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric Schwarzian\nQM.\n", "  The dynamic equations for the fluxes through the SQUIDs that form a\ntwo-dimensional metamamaterial on a Lieb lattice are derived, and then\nlinearized around zero flux to obtain the linear frequency spectrum according\nto the standard procedure. That spectrum, due to the Lieb lattice geometry,\npossesses a frequency band structure exhibiting two characteristic features;\ntwo dispersive bands, which form a Dirac cone at the corners of the first\nBrillouin zone, and a flat band crossing the Dirac points. It is demonstrated\nnumerically that localized states can be excited in the system when it is\ninitialized with single-site excitations; depending on the amplitude of those\ninitial states, the localization is either due to the flat-band or to nonlinear\neffects. Flat-band localized states are formed in the nearly linear regime,\nwhile localized excitations of the discrete breather type are formed in the\nnonlinear regime. These two regimes are separated by an intermediate turbulent\nregime for which no localization is observed. Notably, initial single-site\nexcitations of only edge SQUIDs of a unit cell may end-up in flat-band\nlocalized states; no such states are formed for initial single-site excitations\nof a corner SQUID of a unit cell. The degree of localization of the resulting\nstates is in any case quantified using well-established measures such as the\nenergetic participation ratio and the second moment.\n", "  In nodal-line semimetals, Coulomb interactions and short-range correlated\ndisorder are both marginal perturbations to the clean non-interacting\nHamiltonian. We analyze their interplay using a weak-coupling renormalization\ngroup approach. In the clean case, the Coulomb interaction has been found to be\nmarginally irrelevant, leading to Fermi liquid behavior. We extend the analysis\nto incorporate the effects of disorder. The nodal line structure gives rise to\nkinematical constraints similar to that for a two-dimensional Fermi surface,\nwhich plays a crucial role in the one-loop renor- malization of the disorder\ncouplings. For a two-fold degenerate nodal loop (Weyl loop), we show that\ndisorder flows to strong coupling along a unique fixed trajectory in the space\nof symmetry inequiv- alent disorder couplings. Along this fixed trajectory, all\nsymmetry inequivalent disorder strengths become equal. For a four-fold\ndegenerate nodal loop (Dirac loop), disorder also flows to strong coupling,\nhowever the strengths of symmetry inequivalent disorder couplings remain\ndifferent. We show that feedback from disorder reverses the sign of the beta\nfunction for the Coulomb interaction, causing the Coulomb interaction to flow\nto strong coupling as well. However, the Coulomb interac- tion flows to strong\ncoupling asymptotically more slowly than disorder. Extrapolating our results to\nstrong coupling, we conjecture that at low energies nodal line semimetals\nshould be described by a noninteracting nonlinear sigma model. We discuss the\nrelation of our results with possible many-body localization at zero\ntemperatures in such materials.\n", "  In this paper, we focus on the numerical simulation of phase separation about\nmacromolecule microsphere composite (MMC) hydrogel. The model equation is based\non Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation with reticular free energy.\nWe have put forward two $L^2$ stable schemes to simulate simplified TDGL\nequation. In numerical experiments, we observe that simulating the whole\nprocess of phase separation requires a considerably long time. We also notice\nthat the total free energy changes significantly in initial time and varies\nslightly in the following time. Based on these properties, we introduce an\nadaptive strategy based on one of stable scheme mentioned. It is found that the\nintroduction of the time adaptivity cannot only resolve the dynamical changes\nof the solution accurately but also can significantly save CPU time for the\nlong time simulation.\n", "  Theoretical studies on linear shear instabilities often use simple velocity\nand density profiles (e.g. constant, piecewise) for obtaining good qualitative\nand quantitative predictions of the initial disturbances. Furthermore, such\nsimple profiles provide a minimal model for obtaining a mechanistic\nunderstanding of otherwise elusive shear instabilities. However, except a few\nspecific cases, the efficacy of simple profiles has remained limited to the\nlinear stability paradigm. In this work we have proposed a general framework\nthat can simulate the fully nonlinear evolution of a variety of stratified\nshear instabilities as well as wave-wave and wave-topography interaction\nproblems having simple profiles. To this effect, we have modified the classical\nvortex method by extending the Birkhoff-Rott equation to multiple interfaces,\nand furthermore, have incorporated background shear across a density interface.\nThe latter is more subtle, and originates from the understanding that\nBernoulli's equation is not just limited to irrotational flows, but can be\nmodified to make it applicable for piecewise velocity profiles. We have solved\ndiverse problems that can be essentially reduced to the multiple interacting\ninterfaces paradigm, e.g. spilling and plunging breakers, stratified shear\ninstabilities like Holmboe and Taylor-Caulfield, jet flows, and even\nwave-topography interaction problem like Bragg resonance. Free-slip boundary\nbeing a vortex sheet, its effect can also be effectively captured using vortex\nmethod. We found that the minimal models capture key nonlinear features, e.g.\nwave breaking features like cusp formation and roll-ups, which are observed in\nexperiments and/or extensive simulations with smooth, realistic profiles.\n", "  The planar linear restricted four-body problem is used in order to determine\nthe Newton-Raphson basins of convergence associated with the equilibrium\npoints. The parametric variation of the position as well as of the stability of\nthe libration points is monitored when the values of the mass parameter $b$ as\nwell as of the angular velocity $\\omega$ vary in predefined intervals. The\nregions on the configuration $(x,y)$ plane occupied by the basins of attraction\nare revealed using the multivariate version of the Newton-Raphson iterative\nscheme. The correlations between the attracting domains of the equilibrium\npoints and the corresponding number of iterations needed for obtaining the\ndesired accuracy are also illustrated. We perform a thorough and systematic\nnumerical investigation by demonstrating how the parameters $b$ and $\\omega$\ninfluence the shape, the geometry and of course the fractality of the\nconverging regions. Our numerical outcomes strongly indicate that these two\nparameters are indeed two of the most influential factors in this dynamical\nsystem.\n", "  The escape mechanism of the four hill potential is explored. A thorough\nnumerical investigation takes place in several types of two-dimensional planes\nand also in a three-dimensional subspace of the entire four-dimensional phase\nspace in order to distinguish between bounded (ordered and chaotic) and\nescaping orbits. The determination of the location of the basins of escape\ntoward the different escape channels and their correlations with the\ncorresponding escape time of the orbits is undoubtedly an issue of paramount\nimportance. It was found that in all examined cases all initial conditions\ncorrespond to escaping orbits, while there is no numerical indication of stable\nbounded motion, apart from some isolated unstable periodic orbits. Furthermore,\nwe monitor how the fractality evolves when the total orbital energy varies. The\nlarger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial conditions in\nthe fractal basin boundaries, while the lowest escape rates belong to orbits\nwith initial conditions inside the basins of escape. We hope that our numerical\nanalysis will be useful for a further understanding of the escape dynamics of\norbits in open Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom.\n", "  We present a quantitative characterization of an electrically tunable\nJosephson junction defined in an InAs nanowire proximitized by an\nepitax-ially-grown superconducting Al shell. The gate-dependence of the number\nof conduction channels and of the set of transmission coefficients are\nextracted from the highly nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. Although\nthe transmissions evolve non-monotonically, the number of independent channels\ncan be tuned, and configurations with a single quasi-ballistic channel\nachieved.\n", "  This book provides a rather self-contained survey of the construction of\nHadamard states for scalar field theories in a large class of notable\nspacetimes, possessing a (conformal) light-like boundary. The first two\nsections focus on explaining a few introductory aspects of this topic and on\nproviding the relevant geometric background material. The notions of\nasymptotically flat spacetimes and of expanding universes with a cosmological\nhorizon are analysed in detail, devoting special attention to the\ncharacterization of asymptotic symmetries. In the central part of the book, the\nquantization of a real scalar field theory on such class of backgrounds is\ndiscussed within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory. Subsequently\nit is explained how it is possible to encode the information of the observables\nof the theory in a second, ancillary counterpart, which is built directly on\nthe conformal (null) boundary. This procedure, dubbed bulk-to-boundary\ncorrespondence, has the net advantage of allowing the identification of a\ndistinguished state for the theory on the boundary, which admits a counterpart\nin the bulk spacetime which is automatically of Hadamard form. In the last part\nof the book, some applications of these states are discussed, in particular the\nconstruction of the algebra of Wick polynomials. This book is aimed mainly, but\nnot exclusively, at a readership with interest in the mathematical formulation\nof quantum field theory on curved backgrounds.\n", "  We discuss the minimum glitch size of Crab observed by Espinoza et al.\n(2014). Modelling the crustquake as a trigger mechanism we estimate the size of\nthe broken plate. The plate size obtained, D $\\sim 100 m$ is comparable to\nplate size estimates for PSR J1119--6127. The plate size naturally leads to an\nestimate of the number of unpinned vortices involved in the glitch, $N \\sim\n10^{13} $. This number is of the same order in all Crab and Vela pulsar\nglitches. The mimimum glitch relates the constancy of all these numbers among\ndifferent pulsars to the basic plate size involved in crust breaking. This in\nturn depends on the critical strain angle $\\theta_{cr}$ of the Coulomb lattice\nin the neutron star crust. The minimum glitch size implies $\\theta_{cr} \\sim\n10^{-1}$ in agreement with theoretical and computational estimates.\n", "  In the current work we propose a theory for an additional mass diffusion\neffect in the conventional gas dynamics equations. We find that this effect\nappears as a homogenization time limit correction, when the deterministic\ninteraction process of the real gas molecules is replaced with a simplified\nrandom interaction process for consistency with the Boltzmann equation. For the\nsimplified random interaction processes represented by either a hard sphere\nrandom scattering model, or by a model which employs the Lennard-Jones\npotential for random molecular deflections, we compute the estimates of the\ncorrective diffusion coefficient in the Euler, Navier-Stokes and Grad equations\nfor some monatomic and polyatomic gases.\n", "  We consider the effect of scalarization on static and slowly rotating neutron\nstars for a wide variety of realistic equations of state, including pure\nnuclear matter, nuclear matter with hyperons, hybrid nuclear and quark matter,\nand pure quark matter. We analyze the onset of scalarization, presenting a\nuniversal relation for the critical coupling parameter versus compactness. We\nfind that the onset and the magnitude of the scalarization are strongly\ncorrelated with the value of the gravitational potential (the metric component\n$g_{tt}$) at the center of the star. We also consider the\nmoment-of-inertia--compactness relations and confirm universality for the\nnuclear matter, hyperon and hybrid equations of state.\n", "  We study interfaces with periodic boundary conditions in the low temperature\nphase of the improved Blume-Capel model on the simple cubic lattice. The\ninterface free energy is defined by the difference of the free energy of a\nsystem with anti-periodic boundary conditions in one of the directions and that\nof a system with periodic boundary conditions in all directions. It is obtained\nby integration of differences of the corresponding internal energies over the\ninverse temperature. These differences can be computed efficiently by using a\nvariance reduced estimator that is based on the exchange cluster algorithm. The\ninterface tension is obtained from the interface free energy by using\npredictions based on effective interface models. By using our numerical results\nfor the interface tension $\\sigma$ and the correlation length $\\xi$ obtained in\nprevious work, we determine the universal amplitude ratios $R_{2nd,+} =\n\\sigma_0 f_{2nd,+}^2= 0.3863(6)$, $R_{2nd,-} = \\sigma_0 f_{2nd,-}^2= 0.1028(1)\n$ and $R_{exp,-}=\\sigma_0 f_{exp,-}^2= 0.1077(3)$. Our results are consistent\nwith those obtained previously for the three-dimensional Ising model,\nconfirming the universality hypothesis.\n", "  The Future Circular Collider (FCC), currently in the design phase, will\naddress many outstanding questions in particle physics. The technology to\nsucceed in this 100 km circumference collider goes beyond present limits.\nUltra-high vacuum conditions in the beam pipe is one essential requirement to\nprovide a smooth operation. Different physics phenomena as photon-, ion- and\nelectron- induced desorption and thermal outgassing of the chamber walls\nchallenge this requirement. This paper presents an analytical model and a\ncomputer code PyVASCO that supports the design of a stable vacuum system by\nproviding an overview of all the gas dynamics happening inside the beam pipes.\nA mass balance equation system describes the density distribution of the four\ndominating gas species $\\text{H}_2, \\text{CH}_4$, $\\text{CO}$ and\n$\\text{CO}_2$. An appropriate solving algorithm is discussed in detail and a\nvalidation of the model including a comparison of the output to the readings of\nLHC gauges is presented. This enables the evaluation of different designs for\nthe FCC.\n", "  In this paper we are studying the scattering of massless Dirac fermions by\nSchwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes. This is done by applying\nthe partial wave analysis to the scattering modes obtained after solving the\nmassless Dirac equation in the asymptotic regions of the two black hole\ngeometries. We succeed to obtain analytic phase shifts with the help of which\nthe scattering cross section is computed. The glory and spiral scattering\nphenomena are showed to be present like in the case of massive fermion\nscattering by black holes.\n", "  We study the spectrum of permutation orbifolds of 2d CFTs. We find examples\nwhere the light spectrum grows faster than Hagedorn, which is different from\nknown cases such as symmetric orbifolds. We also describe how to compute their\npartition functions using a generalization of Hecke operators.\n", "  The spin Hall effect (SHE) is found to be strong in heavy transition metals\n(HM), such as Ta and W, in their amorphous and/or high resistivity form. In\nthis work, we show that by employing a Cu-Ta binary alloy as buffer layer in an\namorphous Cu$_{100-x}$Ta$_{x}$-based magnetic heterostructure with\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), the SHE-induced damping-like\nspin-orbit torque (DL-SOT) efficiency $|\\xi_{DL}|$ can be linearly tuned by\nadjusting the buffer layer resistivity. Current-induced SOT switching can also\nbe achieved in these Cu$_{100-x}$Ta$_{x}$-based magnetic heterostructures, and\nwe find the switching behavior better explained by a SOT-assisted domain wall\npropagation picture. Through systematic studies on Cu$_{100-x}$Ta$_{x}$-based\nsamples with various compositions, we determine the lower bound of spin Hall\nconductivity\n$|\\sigma_{SH}|\\approx2.02\\times10^{4}[\\hbar/2e]\\Omega^{-1}\\cdot\\operatorname{m}^{-1}$\nin the Ta-rich regime. Based on the idea of resistivity tuning, we further\ndemonstrate that $|\\xi_{DL}|$ can be enhanced from 0.087 for pure Ta to 0.152\nby employing a resistive TaN buffer layer.\n", "  The fabrication of luminescent defects in single-crystal diamond upon Sn\nimplantation and annealing is reported. The relevant spectral features of the\noptical centers (emission peaks at 593.5 nm, 620.3 nm, 630.7 nm and 646.7 nm)\nare attributed to Sn-related defects through the correlation of their\nphotoluminescence (PL) intensity with the implantation fluence. Single\nSn-related defects were identified and characterized through the acquisition of\ntheir second-order auto-correlation emission functions, by means of\nHanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometry. The investigation of their single-photon\nemission regime as a function of excitation laser power revealed that\nSn-related defects are based on three-level systems with a 6 ns radiative decay\nlifetime. In a fraction of the studied centers, the observation of a blinking\nPL emission is indicative of the existence of a dark state. Furthermore,\nabsorption dependence from the polarization of the excitation radiation with\nabout 45 percent contrast was measured. This work shed light on the existence\nof a new optical center associated with a group-IV impurity in diamond, with\nsimilar photo-physical properties to the already well-known Si-V and Ge-V\nemitters, thus providing results of interest from both the fundamental and\napplicative points of view.\n", "  We study theoretically confinement related effects in the optical response of\nthin plasmonic films of controlled variable thickness. While being constant for\nrelatively thick films, the plasma frequency is shown to acquire spatial\ndispersion typical of two-dimensional materials such as graphene, gradually\nshifting to the red with the film thickness reduction. The dissipative loss,\nwhile decreasing at any fixed frequency, gradually goes up at the plasma\nfrequency as it shifts to the red with the film thickness reduced. These\nfeatures offer a controllable way to tune spatial dispersion and related\noptical properties of plasmonic films and metasurfaces on demand, by precisely\ncontrolling their thickness, material composition, and by choosing deposition\nsubstrates and coating layers appropriately.\n", "  Recently, the concept on `forgeable quantum messages' in arbitrated quantum\nsignature schemes was introduced by T. Kim et al. [Phys. Scr., 90, 025101\n(2015)], and it has been shown that there always exists such a forgeable\nquantum message for every known arbitrated quantum signature scheme with four\nquantum encryption operators and the specific two rotation operators. We first\nextend the result to the case of any two unitary rotation operators, and then\nconsider the forgeable quantum messages in the schemes with four quantum\nencryption operators and three or more rotation operators. We here present a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for existence of a forgeable quantum\nmessage, and moreover, by employing the condition, show that there exists an\narbitrated quantum signature scheme which contains no forgeable quantum\nmessage-signature pairs.\n", "  We use a simple dynamical model in order to investigate the regular or\nchaotic character of orbits in a barred galaxy with a central, spherically\nsymmetric, dense nucleus and a flat disk. In particular, we explore how the\ntotal orbital energy influences the overall orbital structure of the system, by\ncomputing in each case the percentage of regular, sticky and chaotic orbits. In\nan attempt to distinguish safely and with certainty between ordered and chaotic\nmotion, we apply the Smaller ALingment Index (SALI) as a chaos detector to\nextensive samples of orbits obtained by integrating numerically the basic\nequations of motion as well as the variational equations. We integrate large\nsets of initial conditions of orbits in several types of two dimensional planes\nfor better understanding of the orbital properties. Our numerical calculations\nsuggest, that the value of the energy has a huge impact on the percentages of\nthe orbits, thus indicating that a rotating barred galaxy is indeed a very\ninteresting stellar quantity.\n", "  The case of the planar circular restricted three-body problem where one of\nthe two primaries has a stronger gravitational field with respect to the\nclassical Newtonian field is investigated. We consider the case where two\nprimaries have the same mass, so as the the only difference between them to be\nthe strength of the gravitational field which is controlled by the power $p$ of\nthe potential. A thorough numerical analysis takes place in several types of\ntwo dimensional planes in which we classify initial conditions of orbits into\nthree main categories: (i) bounded, (ii) escaping and (iii) collision. Our\nresults reveal that the power of the gravitational potential has a huge impact\non the nature of orbits. Interpreting the collision motion as leaking in the\nphase space we related our results to both chaotic scattering and the theory of\nleaking Hamiltonian systems. We successfully located the escape as well as the\ncollision basins and we managed to correlate them with the corresponding escape\nand collision time of the orbits. We hope our contribution to be useful for a\nfurther understanding of the escape and collision properties of motion in this\ninteresting version of the restricted three-body problem.\n", "  NGC6217 is a nearby spiral galaxy with a starburst region near its center.\nEvidence for a low luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in its core has\nalso been found in optical spectra. Intriguingly, X-ray observations by ROSAT\nrevealed three knots aligned with the galaxy center, resembling a jet\nstructure. This paper presents a study of XMM-Newton observations made to\nassess the hypothesis of a jet emitted from the center of NGC6217. The XMM data\nconfirm the knots found with ROSAT and our spectral analysis shows that they\nhave similar spectral properties with a hard photon index Gamma~1.7. The core\nof NGC6217 is well fitted by a model with an AGN and a starburst component,\nwhere the AGN contributes at most 46% of the total flux. The candidate jet has\nan apparent length ~15 kpc and a luminosity of ~5 X 10^38 erg/s. It stands out\nby being hosted by a spiral galaxy, since jets are more widely associated with\nellipticals. To explain the jet launching mechanism we consider the hypothesis\nof an advection dominated accretion flow with a low accretion rate. The\ncandidate jet emitted from NGC6217 is intriguing since it represents a\nchallenge to the current knowledge of the connection between AGN, jets and host\ngalaxies.\n", "  The effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the electronic properties of\nmonolayer (ML) PtSe$_2$ is dictated by the presence of the crystal inversion\nsymmetry to exhibit spin polarized band without characteristic of spin\nsplitting. Through fully-relativistic density-functional theory calculations,\nwe show that large spin-orbit splitting can be induced by introducing point\ndefects. We calculate stability of native point defects such as a Se vacancy\n(V$_{\\texttt{Se}}$), a Se interstitial (Se$_{i}$), a Pt vacancy\n(V$_{\\texttt{Pt}}$), and a Pt interstitial (Pt$_{i}$), and find that both the\nV$_{\\texttt{Se}}$ and Se$_{i}$ have the lowest formation energy. We also find\nthat in contrast to the Se$_{i}$ case exhibiting spin degeneracy in the defect\nstates, the large spin-orbit splitting up to 152 meV is observed in the defect\nstates of the V$_{\\texttt{Se}}$. Our analyses of orbital contributions to the\ndefect states show that the large spin splitting is originated from the strong\nhybridization between Pt-$d_{x{^2}+y{^2}}+d_{xy}$ and Se-$p_{x}+p_{y}$\norbitals. Our study clarifies that the defects play an important role in the\nspin splitting properties of the PtSe$_2$ ML, which is important for designing\nfuture spintronic devices.\n", "  This paper is devoted to investigate nonlinearly charged dilatonic black\nholes in the context of gravity's rainbow with two cases: I) by considering the\nusual entropy, II) in the presence of first order logarithmic correction of\nentropy. First, exact solutions of dilatonic Born-Infeld gravity with an energy\ndependent Liouville-type potential with black hole interpretation are obtained.\nThen, thermodynamic properties of the mentioned cases are studied, separately.\nIt will be shown that although mass, entropy and heat capacity are modified due\nto the presence of first order correction, the temperature remains independent\nof it. Furthermore, it will be shown that divergencies of the heat capacity,\nhence phase transition points are also independent of first order correction\nwhereas the stability conditions are highly sensitive to variation of the\ncorrection parameter. Except for the effects of first order correction, we will\nalso draw a limit on values of the dilatonic parameter and show that it is\npossible to recognize AdS and dS thermodynamical behaviors for two specific\nbranches of the dilatonic parameter. In addition, the effects of nonlinear\nelectromagnetic field and energy functions on thermodynamical behavior of the\nsolutions will be highlighted and dependency of critical behavior, on these\ngeneralizations will be investigated.\n", "  We discuss the effect of Beyond the Standard Model charged current\ninteractions on the detection of the Cosmic Neutrino Background by neutrino\ncapture on tritium in a PTOLEMY-like detector. We show that the total capture\nrate can be substantially modified for Dirac neutrinos if scalar or tensor\nright-chiral currents, with strength consistent with current experimental\nbounds, are at play. We find that the total capture rate for Dirac neutrinos,\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm D}^{\\rm BSM}$, can be between 0.3 to 2.2 of what is expected for\nDirac neutrinos in the Standard Model, $\\Gamma_{\\rm D}^{\\rm SM}$, so that it\ncan be made as large as the rate expected for Majorana neutrinos with only\nStandard Model interactions. A non-negligible primordial abundance of\nright-handed neutrinos can only worsen the situation, increasing $\\Gamma_{\\rm\nD}^{\\rm BSM}$ by 30 to 90\\%. On the other hand, if a much lower total rate is\nmeasured than what is expected for $\\Gamma_{\\rm D}^{\\rm SM}$, it may be a sign\nof new physics.\n", "  The mechanisms for strong electron-phonon coupling predicted for\nhydrogen-rich alloys with high superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) are\nexamined within the Migdal-Eliashberg theory. Analysis of the functional\nderivative of $T_c$ with respect to the electron-phonon spectral function shows\nthat at low pressures, when the alloys often adopt layered structures, bending\nvibrations have the most dominant effect. At very high pressures, the H-H\ninteractions in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) extended\nstructures are weakened, resulting in mixed bent (libration) and stretch\nvibrations, and the electron-phonon coupling process is distributed over a\nbroad frequency range leading to very high $T_c$.\n", "  The aim of this work is to revise but also explore even further the escape\ndynamics in the H\\'{e}non-Heiles system. In particular, we conduct a thorough\nand systematic numerical investigation distinguishing between trapped (ordered\nand chaotic) and escaping orbits, considering only unbounded motion for several\nenergy levels. It is of particular interest, to locate the basins of escape\ntowards the different escape channels and relate them with the corresponding\nescape periods of the orbits. In order to elucidate the escape process we\nconduct a thorough investigation in several types of two-dimensional planes and\nalso in a three-dimensional subspace of the entire four-dimensional phase\nspace. We classify extensive samples of orbits by integrating numerically the\nequations of motion as well as the variational equations. In an attempt to\ndetermine the regular or chaotic nature of trapped motion, we apply the SALI\nmethod, as an accurate chaos detector. It was found, that in all studied cases\nregions of non-escaping orbits coexist with several basins of escape. Most of\nthe current outcomes have been compared with previous related work.\n", "  We analyze the possible types of ordering in a boson--fermion model. The\nHamiltonian is inherently related to the Bose--Hubbard model for vector\ntwo-species bosons in optical lattices. We show that such model can be reduced\nto the Kugel--Khomskii type spin--pseudospin model, but in contrast to the\nusual version of the latter model, we are dealing here with the case of spin\n$S=1$ and pseudospin $1/2$. We show that the interplay of spin and pseudospin\ndegrees of freedom leads to a rather nontrivial magnetic phase diagram\nincluding the spin-nematic configurations. Tuning the spin-channel interaction\nparameter $U_s$ gives rise to quantum phase transitions. We find that the\nground state of the system always has the pseudospin domain structure. On the\nother hand, the sign change of $U_s$ switches the spin arrangement of the\nground state within domains from ferro- to aniferromagnetic one. Finally, we\nrevisit the spin (pseudospin)-1/2 Kugel--Khomskii model and see the inverse\npicture of phase transitions.\n", "  We investigate the helicity dependent generalized parton distributions (GPDs)\nin momentum as well as transverse position (impact) spaces for up and down\nquarks in a proton when the momentum transfer in both the transverse and\nlongitudinal directions are nonzero. The GPDs are evaluated using the\nlight-front wavefunctions of a quark-diquark model for nucleon where the\nwavefunctions are constructed by the soft-wall AdS/QCD correspondence. We also\nexpress the GPDs in the boost-invariant longitudinal position space.\n", "  Most giant spiral galaxies have pseudo or disk-like bulges that are\nconsidered to be the result of purely secular processes. This may challenge the\nhierarchical scenario predicting about one major merger per massive galaxy\n($>$$3\\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$) since the last $\\sim$ 9 billion years. Here we\nverify whether or not the association between pseudo-bulges and secular\nprocesses is irrevocable. Using GADGET2 N-body/SPH simulations, we have\nconducted a systematic study of remnants of major mergers which progenitors\nhave been selected (1) to follow the gas richness-look back time relationship,\nand (2) with a representative distribution of orbits and spins in a\ncosmological frame. Analyzing the surface-mass density profile of both nearby\ngalaxies and merger remnants with two components, we find that most of them\nshow pseudo-bulges or bar dominated centers. Even if some orbits lead to\nclassical bulges just after the fusion, the contamination by the additional gas\nthat gradually accumulates to the center and forming stars later on, leads to\nremnants apparently dominated by pseudo-bulges. We also found that simple SPH\nsimulations should be sufficient to form realistic spiral galaxies as remnants\nof ancient gas-rich mergers without need for specifically tuned feedback\nconditions. We then conclude that pseudo-bulges and bars in spiral galaxies are\nnatural consequences of major mergers when they are realized in a cosmological\ncontext, i.e., with gas-rich progenitors as expected when selected in the\ndistant Universe.\n", "  We introduce the Markovian matrix product density operator, which is a\nspecial subclass of the matrix product density operator. We show that the von\nNeumann entropy of such ansatz can be computed efficiently on a classical\ncomputer. This is possible because one can efficiently certify that the global\nstate forms an approximate quantum Markov chain by verifying a set of\ninequalities. Each of these inequalities can be verified in time that scales\npolynomially with the bond dimension and the local Hilbert space dimension. The\ntotal number of inequalities scale linearly with the system size.\n  We use this fact to study the complexity of computing the minimum free energy\nof local Hamiltonians at finite temperature. To this end, we introduce the free\nenergy problem as a generalization of the local Hamiltonian problem, and study\nits complexity for a class of Hamiltonians that describe quantum spin chains.\nThe corresponding free energy problem at finite temperature is in NP if the\nGibbs state of such Hamiltonian forms an approximate quantum Markov chain with\nan error that decays exponentially with the width of the conditioning\nsubsystem.\n", "  String diagrams turn algebraic equations into topological moves that have\nrecurring shapes, involving the sliding of one diagram past another. We\nindividuate, at the root of this fact, the dual nature of polygraphs as\npresentations of higher algebraic theories, and as combinatorial descriptions\nof \"directed spaces\". Operations of polygraphs modelled on operations of\ntopological spaces are used as the foundation of a compositional universal\nalgebra, where sliding moves arise from tensor products of polygraphs. We\nreconstruct several higher algebraic theories in this framework.\n  In this regard, the standard formalism of polygraphs has some technical\nproblems. We propose a notion of regular polygraph, barring cell boundaries\nthat are not homeomorphic to a disk of the appropriate dimension. We define a\ncategory of non-degenerate shapes, and show how to calculate their tensor\nproducts. Then, we introduce a notion of weak unit to recover weakly degenerate\nboundaries in low dimensions, and prove that the existence of weak units is\nequivalent to a representability property.\n  We then turn to applications of diagrammatic algebra to quantum theory. We\nre-evaluate the category of Hilbert spaces from the perspective of categorical\nuniversal algebra, which leads to a bicategorical refinement. Then, we focus on\nthe axiomatics of fragments of quantum theory, and present the ZW calculus, the\nfirst complete diagrammatic axiomatisation of the theory of qubits.\n  The ZW calculus has several advantages over ZX calculi, including a\ncomputationally meaningful normal form, and a fragment whose diagrams can be\nread as setups of fermionic oscillators. Moreover, its generators reflect an\noperational classification of entangled states of 3 qubits. We conclude with\ngeneralisations of the ZW calculus to higher-dimensional systems, including the\ndefinition of a universal set of generators in each dimension.\n", "  Hollow core fibers are considered as promising candidates to deliver intense\ntemporally overlapping picosecond pulses in applications such as stimulated\nRaman scattering (SRS) microscopy and endoscopy because of their inherent low\nnonlinearity compared to solid-core silica fibers. Here we demonstrate that,\ncontrary to prior assumptions, parasitic signals are generated in Kagom\\'e\nlattice hollow core fibers. We identify the origin of the parasitic signals as\nan interplay between the Kerr nonlinearity of air and frequency-dependent fiber\nlosses. Importantly, we identify the special cases of experimental parameters\nthat are free from parasitic signals, making hollow core fibers ideal\ncandidates for noise-free SRS microscopy and endoscopy.\n", "  The field of precision calculations for Standard Model processes at the LHC\nhas experienced enormous progress in recent years. This talk highlights some\nexamples from the physics of parton distribution functions, jets, electroweak\ngauge bosons and Higgs bosons.\n", "  Computationally efficient modeling of the thermal conductivity of materials\nis crucial to thorough experimental planning and theoretical understanding of\nthermal properties. We present a modeling approach in this work that utilizes\nfrequency-dependent effective medium to calculate lattice thermal conductivity\nof nanostructured solids. The method accurately predicts a significant\nreduction in the thermal conductivity of nanostructured Si80Ge20 systems, along\nwith previous reported thermal conductivities in nanowires and\nnanoparticles-in-matrix materials. We use our model to gain insight into the\nrole of long wavelength phonons on the thermal conductivity of nanograined\nsilicon-germanium alloys. Through thermal conductivity accumulation\ncalculations with our modified effective medium model, we show that phonons\nwith wavelengths much greater than the average grain size will not be impacted\nby grain boundary scattering, counter to the traditionally assumed notion that\ngrain boundaries in solids will act as diffusive interfaces that will limit\nlong wavelength phonon transport. This is further supported through a\nmodulation frequency dependent thermal conductivity as measured with\ntime-domain thermoreflectance.\n", "  In this paper, the top quark pair production events are analyzed as a source\nof neutral Higgs bosons of two Higgs doublet model type I at LHC. The\nproduction mechanism is $pp \\to H/A \\to t\\bar{t}$ assuming a fully hadronic\nfinal state through $t \\to Wb \\to jjb$. In order to distinguish the signal from\nthe main background which is the standard model $t\\bar{t}$, we benefit from the\nfact that the top quarks in signal events acquire a large Lorentz boost due to\nthe heavy neutral Higgs boson. This feature leads to three collinear jets (a\nfat jet) which is a discriminating tool for identification of the top quarks\nfrom the Higgs boson resonances. Events with two identified top jets are\nselected and the invariant mass of the top pair is calculated for both signal\nand background. It is shown that the low $\\tan\\beta$ region has still some\nparts which can be covered by this analysis and has not been excluded yet by\nflavor physics data.\n", "  We presents result of CDD photometry for SU UMa dwarf nova NY Her during 6\nnights in June 2017 when object was in quiescence. Light curves clearly show\nstrong amplitude variations in a range of 0m.7-1m.1. Time series analysis\nrevealed a period 0.07141(5) d, that we identified as the period of possible\nnegative superhumps of NY Her.\n", "  We study the mathematical foundations of physics. We reconstruct textbook\nquantum theory from a single symmetric monoidal functor $GNS : \\mathbf{Phys}\n\\longrightarrow \\ast\\mathbf{Mod}$, based on the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal\nconstruction and the notion of representability.\n  We derive the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, including\nthe Born rule, the Schr\\\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures, the relation between\nsymmetries and group representations, and a theory of quantum Markov processes,\nincluding wave function collapse. Inclusion of the classical limit and\ndeformation quantization is briefly sketched.\n  Gauge symmetry and extended locality cannot currently be accommodated, due to\nconceptual difficulties discussed in an appendix.\n", "  The gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or interstellar medium and\ninside their virial radii is known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In\nrecent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our\nunderstanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational\naccess to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations\nof this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium\ncharacterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a\nsource for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and\nrecycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review\nour evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state,\nand coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across\nthe electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy\nevolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions\nfor future research.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae have proven vital to our understanding of cosmology, both\nas standard candles and for their role in galactic chemical evolution; however,\ntheir origin remains uncertain. The canonical accretion model implies a hot and\nluminous progenitor which would ionize the surrounding gas out to a radius of\n$\\sim$10--100 parsecs for $\\sim$100,000 years after the explosion. Here we\nreport stringent upper limits on the temperature and luminosity of the\nprogenitor of Tycho's supernova (SN 1572), determined using the remnant itself\nas a probe of its environment. Hot, luminous progenitors that would have\nproduced a greater hydrogen ionization fraction than that measured at the\nradius of the present remnant ($\\sim$3 parsecs) can thus be excluded. This\nconclusively rules out steadily nuclear-burning white dwarfs (supersoft X-ray\nsources), as well as disk emission from a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf\naccreting $\\gtrsim 10^{-8}M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (recurrent novae). The lack of a\nsurrounding Str\\\"omgren sphere is consistent with the merger of a double white\ndwarf binary, although other more exotic scenarios may be possible.\n", "  In dimension $d\\geq 3$, a variational principle for the size of the pure\npoint spectrum of (discrete) Schr\\\"odinger operators $H(\\mathfrak{e},V)$ on the\nhypercubic lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, with dispersion relation $\\mathfrak{e}$\nand potential $V$, is established. The dispersion relation $\\mathfrak{e}$ is\nassumed to be a Morse function and the potential $V(x)$ to decay faster than\n$|x|^{-2(d+3)}$, but not necessarily to be of definite sign. Our estimate on\nthe size of the pure-point spectrum yields the absence of embedded and\nthreshold eigenvalues of $H(\\mathfrak{e},V)$ for a class ot potentials of this\nkind. The proof of the variational principle is based on a limiting absorption\nprinciple combined with a positive commutator (Mourre) estimate, and a Virial\ntheorem. A further observation of crucial importance for our argument is that,\nfor any selfadjoint operator $B$ and positive number $\\lambda >0$, the number\nof negative eigenvalues of $\\lambda B$ is independent of $\\lambda$.\n", "  Giant photovoltaic effect due to bulk photovoltaic effect observed in\nmultiferroic BiFeO3 thin films has triggered a renewed interest on\nphotoferroelectric materials for photovoltaic applications. Tremendous advance\nhas been done to improve power conversion efficiency (up to up to 8.1%) in\nphotoferroelectrics via absorption increase using narrow bandgap\nferroelectrics. Other strategies, as it is the more efficient use of\nferroelectric internal electric field, are ongoing. Moreover, as a by-product,\nseveral progress have been also achieved on photostriction that is the\nphoto-induced deformation phenomenon. Here, we review ongoing and promising\nroutes to improve ferroelectrics photoresponse.\n", "  Asteroseismology is a unique tool to explore the internal structure of stars\nthrough both observational and theoretical research. The internal structure of\npulsating hydrogen shell white dwarfs (ZZ Ceti stars) detected by\nasteroseismology is regarded as the representative of all DA white dwarfs.\nObservations for KUV~08368+4026, which locates in the middle of the ZZ Ceti\ninstability strip, have been carried out in 1999 and from 2009 to 2012 with\neither single-site runs or multisite campaigns. Time-series photometric data of\nabout 300 hours were collected in total. Through data reduction and analysis,\n30 frequencies were extracted, including four triplets, two doublets, one\nsingle mode and further signals. The independent modes are identified as either\nl=1 or l=2 modes. Hence, a rotation period of $5.52\\pm 0.22$ days was deduced\nfrom the period spacing in the multiplets. Theoretical static models were built\nand a best fit model for KUV~08368+4026 was obtained with $0.692\\pm0.002$ solar\nmass, $(2.92\\pm0.02)\\times 10^{-3}$ solar luminosity and the hydrogen mass\nfraction of $10^{-4}$ stellar mass.\n", "  We have carried out phenomenological implication of R-parity violating\n($\\NEG% {R}_{p}$) Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) via analyses of pure\nleptonic($% M\\rightarrow \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$) and semileptonic decays of\npseudo-scalar mesons(% $M\\rightarrow X\\nu \\bar{\\nu}$). These analyses involve\nprediction of branching fraction of pure leptonic decays by using experimental\nlimits/bounds derived from the study of semileptonic decays on $\\NEG{R}_{p}$\nparameters. We have found, in general that $\\NEG{R}_{p}$ contribution dominates\nover the SM contribution i.e., by a factor of $10^{2}$ for the semleptonic\ndecays of $K^{0}$, $10$ for the pure leptonic decays of $K_{L,S}$ , while\n$10^{2}~$\\& $10^{4}$ in case of $B_{s}$ and $B_{d}$ respectively. This\ndemonstrates the role of $\\NEG{R}_{p}$ as a viable model for the study of NP\ncontribution in rare decays.\n", "  Investment in brighter sources and larger detectors has resulted in an\nexplosive rise in the data collected at synchrotron facilities. Currently,\nhuman experts extract scientific information from these data, but they cannot\nkeep pace with the rate of data collection. Here, we present three on-the-fly\napproaches - attribute extraction, nearest-neighbor distance, and cluster\nanalysis - to quickly segment x-ray diffraction (XRD) data into groups with\nsimilar XRD profiles. An expert can then analyze representative spectra from\neach group in detail with much reduced time, but without loss of scientific\ninsights. On-the-fly segmentation would, therefore, result in accelerated\nscientific productivity.\n", "  Nucleosynthesis in the oceans of accreting neutron stars can produce novel\nmixtures of nuclides, whose composition is dependent on the exact astrophysical\nconditions. Many simulations have now been done to determine the\nnucleosynthesis products in the ocean, but the phase separation at the base of\nthe ocean, which determines the composition of the crust, has not been as well\nstudied. In this work, we simulate the phase separation of a composition, which\nwas predicted to produce a crust enriched in light nuclei, in contrast with\npast work which predicts that crust is enriched in heavy nuclei. We perform\nmolecular dynamics simulations of the phase separation of this mixture using\nthe methods of Horowitz $\\textit{et. al.}$ (2007). We find good agreement with\nthe predictions of Mckinven $\\textit{et al.}$ (2016) for the phase separation\nof this mixture. Moreover, this supports their method as a computationally\nefficient alternative to molecular dynamics for calculating phase separation\nfor a wider regime of astrophysical conditions.\n", "  Investment in brighter sources and larger and faster detectors has\naccelerated the speed of data acquisition at national user facilities. The\naccelerated data acquisition offers many opportunities for discovery of new\nmaterials, but it also presents a daunting challenge. The rate of data\nacquisition far exceeds the current speed of data quality assessment, resulting\nin less than optimal data and data coverage, which in extreme cases forces\nrecollection of data. Herein, we show how this challenge can be addressed\nthrough development of an approach that makes routine data assessment automatic\nand instantaneous. Through extracting and visualizing customized attributes in\nreal time, data quality and coverage, as well as other scientifically relevant\ninformation contained in large datasets is highlighted. Deployment of such an\napproach not only improves the quality of data but also helps optimize usage of\nexpensive characterization resources by prioritizing measurements of highest\nscientific impact. We anticipate our approach to become a starting point for a\nsophisticated decision-tree that optimizes data quality and maximizes\nscientific content in real time through automation. With these efforts to\nintegrate more automation in data collection and analysis, we can truly take\nadvantage of the accelerating speed of data acquisition.\n", "  We consider attacks on two-way quantum key distribution protocols in which an\nundetectable eavesdropper copies all messages in the message mode. We show that\nunder the attacks there is no disturbance in the message mode and that the\nmutual information between the sender and the receiver is always constant and\nequal to one. It follows that recent proofs of security for two-way protocols\ncannot be considered complete since they do not cover the considered attacks.\n", "  An effect of membrane surface charge on mechanical properties of the\nphospholipid bilayer membrane and pores formation is considered. It is shown\nthat the outer and inner surfaces of the phospholipid membrane is always\nsubject to tension, regardless of magnitude and sign of the charges on its\nsurface. This is due to the fact that the Debye length of the extracellular and\nintracellular electrolyte is always much smaller than the thickness of the\nmembrane, and accordingly the electric field on the outer surface of the\nmembrane is always much larger than the field inside the membrane. This result\ncontradicts the generally accepted notion that a charged phospholipid membrane\nis similar to a charged capacitor in a dielectric medium and it is always\nsubject to compression. Phospholipid bilayer membrane will be subject to\ncompression only in a very weak electrolyte (~1mM/L), when Debye length is\nlarger than the membrane thickness. It is also shown that the membrane surface\ncharges lead to pore compression when the pore radius is larger than the Debye\nradius and to the stretching in the opposite case. Difference in the\ncoefficients of surface and edge tension of phospholipid cell membranes can be\nexplained by taking into account the cell membrane surface charge. Simple\nexperiments are proposed to test the influence of the cell membrane surface\ncharge on its mechanical properties.\n", "  We propose a Clifford algebra approach to chiral symmetry breaking and\nfermion mass hierarchies in the context of composite Higgs bosons. Standard\nmodel fermions are represented by algebraic spinors of six-dimensional binary\nClifford algebra, while ternary Clifford algebra-related flavor projection\noperators control allowable flavor-mixing interactions. There are three\ncomposite electroweak Higgs bosons resulted from top quark, tau neutrino, and\ntau lepton condensations. Each of the three condensations gives rise to masses\nof four different fermions. The fermion mass hierarchies within these three\ngroups are determined by four-fermion condensations, which break two global\nchiral symmetries. The four-fermion condensations induce axion-like\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons and can be dark matter candidates. In addition to\nthe 125 GeV Higgs boson observed at the Large Hadron Collider, we anticipate\ndetection of tau neutrino composite Higgs boson via the charm quark decay\nchannel.\n", "  Tuning the lattice degree of freedom in nanoscale functional crystals is\ncritical to exploit the emerging functionalities such as piezoelectricity,\nshape-memory effect, or piezomagnetism, which are attributed to the intrinsic\nlattice-polar or lattice-spin coupling. Here it is reported that a mechanical\nprobe can be a dynamic tool to switch the ferroic orders at the nanoscale\nmultiferroic phase boundaries in BiFeO 3 with a phase mixture, where the\nmaterial can be reversibly transformed between the \"soft\" tetragonal-like and\nthe \"hard\" rhombohedrallike structures. The microscopic origin of the\nnonvolatile mechanical switching of the multiferroic phase boundaries, coupled\nwith a reversible 180{\\deg} rotation of the in-plane ferroelectric\npolarization, is the nanoscale pressure-induced elastic deformation and\nreconstruction of the spontaneous strain gradient across the multiferroic phase\nboundaries. The reversible control of the room-temperature multiple ferroic\norders using a pure mechanical stimulus may bring us a new pathway to achieve\nthe potential energy conversion and sensing applications.\n", "  We study the light scattering properties of moderately large dust aggregates\n($0.8\\mu m \\lesssim R \\lesssim 2.0\\mu m$) with a wide variation of porosity\n($\\mathcal{P}$) from 0.57 to 0.98. The computations are performed using the\nSuperposition T-matrix code with BAM2 cluster ($\\mathcal{P} \\sim 0.57-0.64$),\nBAM1 cluster ($\\mathcal{P} \\sim 0.74$), BA or BPCA cluster ($\\mathcal{P} \\sim\n0.85-0.87$) and BCCA cluster ($\\mathcal{P} \\sim 0.98$). The effect of aggregate\nsize parameter ($X$) on the light scattering properties of aggregates (BA and\nBAM2) having different porosities is explored in this study. We find that the\npositive polarization maximum ($P_{max}$), the amplitude of the negative\npolarization ($P_{min}$) and phase function at the exact backscattering\ndirection ($S_{11}$(180$^\\circ$)) are correlated with the porosity of\naggregates. Compact aggregates show deeper negative polarization as compared to\nporous aggregates when the characteristic radius ($R$) of the aggregates are\nconsidered to be the same. Further lower porosity aggregates show higher\n$S_{11}$(180$^\\circ$) and vice versa. When $\\mathcal{P}$ is increased in a\nrange from 0.64 to 0.98, both ${S}_{11}(180^\\circ$) and $P_{min}$ decrease\nlinearly, whereas P$_{max}$ increases linearly. We also find that the porosity\nof the aggregates plays a crucial role in determining the polarimetric color\nfor high absorbing organic refractories. The compact clusters (BAM1 and BAM2)\nshow the negative polarimetric color whereas BA clusters show almost positive\npolarimetric color at all values of scattering angle. We have also made some\ncomparisons of our simulated results with PROGRA$^2$ experimental results.\n", "  In a seminal work, S.A.R. Horsley and collaborators [S.A.R. Horsley {\\em et\nal.}, Nature Photon. {\\bf 9}, 436 (2015)] have shown that, in the framework of\nnon-Hermitian extensions of the Schr\\\"odinger and Helmholtz equations, a\nlocalized complex scattering potential with spatial distributions of the real\nand imaginary parts related to one another by the spatial Kramers-Kronig\nrelations are reflectionless and even invisible under certain conditions. Here\nwe consider the scattering properties of Kramers-Kronig potentials for the\ndiscrete version of the Schr\\\"odinger equation, which generally describes wave\ntransport on a lattice. Contrary to the continuous Schr\\\"odinger equation, on a\nlattice a stationary Kramers-Kronig potential is reflective. However, it is\nshown that a slow drift can make the potential invisible under certain\nconditions.\n", "  Metropolis algorithm has been extensively employed for simulating a canonical\nensemble and estimating macroscopic properties of a closed system at any\ndesired temperature. A mechanical property, like energy can be calculated by\naveraging over a large number of micro states of the stationary Markov chain\ngenerated by the Metropolis algorithm. However thermal properties like entropy,\nand free energies are not easily accessible. A method called umbrella sampling\nwas proposed some forty years ago for this purpose. Ever since, umbrella\nsampling has undergone several metamorphoses and we have now multi canonical\nMonte Carlo, entropic sampling, flat histogram methods, Wang-Landau algorithm\netc. In these talks I shall tell you of Metropolis algorithm for estimating\nmechanical properties and of Wang-Landau algorithm for estimating both\nmechanical and thermal properties of an equilibrium system. I shall make these\nlectures as pedagogical and self-contained as possible.\n", "  Japanese Venus Climate Orbiter/AKATSUKI was proposed in 2001 with strong\nsupport by international Venus science community and approved as an ISAS (The\nInstitute of Space and Astronautical Science) mission soon after the proposal.\nThe mission life we expected was more than two Earth years in Venus orbit.\nAKATSUKI was successfully launched at 06:58:22JST on May 21, 2010, by H-IIA\nF17. After the separation from H-IIA, the telemetry from AKATSUKI was normally\ndetected by DSN Goldstone station (10:00JST) and the solar cell paddles'\ndeployment was confirmed. After a successful cruise, the malfunction happened\non the propulsion system during the Venus orbit insertion (VOI) on Dec 7, 2010.\nThe engine shut down before the planned reduction in speed to achieve. The\nspacecraft did not enter the Venus orbit, but entered an orbit around the Sun\nwith a period of 203 days. Most of the fuel still had remained, but the orbital\nmaneuvering engine was found to be broken and unusable. However, we have found\nan alternate way of achieving orbit by using only the reaction control system\n(RSC). We had adopted the alternate way for orbital maneuver and three minor\nmaneuvers in Nov 2011 were successfully done so that AKATSUKI would meet Venus\nin 2015. We are considering several scenarios for VOI using only RCS.\n", "  The density of the Bose-Einstein condensate for non-interacting pions in a\ncubic box, at given temperature and (average) total pion density, is\ncalculaated for three sets of boundary conditions. The densities are much\nlarger than predicted from thermodynamics and depend significantly on the\nchoice of the boundary conditions, even for volumes as large as $6.4\\cdot\n10$fm$^3$.\n", "  Fluorine adatoms on graphene induce local changes in electronic and magnetic\nproperties, and subtle correlation effects. We investigate the GGA and GGA+U\napproaches as possible solutions to describe the magnetic moment and electronic\nband structure of graphene sheets with fluorine adatoms, and compare to\nexperiments. We show that, due to a lack of strong electronic correlations, GGA\nfails to reproduce the measured magnetic moment in this structure. In\nparticular, the GGA incorrectly predicts a nonmagnetic ground state with a zero\nband gap. On the other hand, GGA+U is a computationally efficient tool which\nprovides physically reasonable properties. Using Hubbard U and exchange J\nparameters of 5 eV and 0.1 eV provides a magnetic moment and optical gap in\nagreement with experiments. Our results imply that the magnetic moment observed\nin the experiment is injected by fluorine in carbon pz orbitals throughout the\ngraphene sheet. The spin- orbit coupling (SOC) has almost no influence (ca. 2%)\non the magnetism. No Rashba effect is detected and the magnetic moment induced\nby fluorine strongly dominates the electronic properties. Our findings explain\nthe anisotropic magnetic behavior observed experimentally.\n", "  The Gaia benchmark stars (GBS) are very bright stars of different late\nspectral types, luminosities and metallicities. They are well-known in the\nGalactic archaeology community because they are widely used to calibrate and\nvalidate the automatic pipelines delivering parameters of on-going and future\nspectroscopic surveys. The sample provides us with consistent fundamental\nparameters as well as a library of high resolution and high signal-to-noise\nspectra. This allows the community to study details of high resolution\nspectroscopy and to compare results between different survey pipelines, putting\nthe GBS at the heart of this community. Here we discuss some results arising\nfrom using the GBS as main data source for spectral analyses.\n", "  In this work, we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic properties\nof cobalt nanospheres grown on cantilever tips by Focused Electron Beam Induced\nDeposition (FEBID). The cantilevers are extremely soft and the cobalt\nnanospheres are optimized for Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM)\nexperiments, which implies that the cobalt nanospheres must be as small as\npossible while bearing high saturation magnetization. It is found that the\ncobalt content and the corresponding saturation magnetization of the\nnanospheres decrease for nanosphere diameters below 300 nm. Electron holography\nmeasurements show the formation of a magnetic vortex state in remanence, which\nnicely agrees with magnetic hysteresis loops performed by local magnetometry\nshowing negligible remanent magnetization. As investigated by local\nmagnetometry, optimal behavior for high-resolution MRFM has been found for\ncobalt nanospheres with diameter of $\\approx$ 200 nm, which present atomic\ncobalt content of $\\approx$ 83 at% and saturation magnetization of 106 A/m,\naround 70% of the bulk value. These results represent the first comprehensive\ninvestigation of the magnetic properties of cobalt nanospheres grown by FEBID\nfor application in MRFM.\n", "  We present a new algorithm having a time complexity of O(N log N) and\ndesigned to retrieve the phase at which an input signal and a set of not\nnecessarily orthogonal templates match best in a weighted chi-squared sense.\nThe proposed implementation is based on an orthogonalization algorithm and thus\nalso benefits from high numerical stability. We apply this method successfully\nto the redshift determination of quasars from the twelfth Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) quasar catalogue and derive the proper spectral reduction and\nredshift selection methods. Derivations of the redshift uncertainty and the\nassociated confidence are also provided. The results of this application are\ncomparable to the performance of the SDSS pipeline, while not having a\nquadratic time dependence.\n", "  We describe methods designed to determine the astrophysical parameters of\nquasars based on spectra coming from the red and blue spectrophotometers of the\nGaia satellite. These methods principally rely on two already published\nalgorithms that are the weighted principal component analysis and the weighted\nphase correlation. The presented approach benefits from a fast implementation;\nan intuitive interpretation as well as strong diagnostic tools on the potential\nerrors that may arise during predictions. The production of a semi-empirical\nlibrary of spectra as they will be observed by Gaia is also covered and\nsubsequently used for validation purpose. We detail the pre-processing that is\nnecessary in order for these spectra to be fully exploitable by our algorithms\nalong with the procedures that are used in order to predict the redshifts of\nthe quasars; their continuum slopes; the total equivalent width of their\nemission lines and whether these are broad absorption line (BAL) quasars or\nnot. Performances of these procedures were assessed in comparison with the\nExtremely Randomized Trees learning method and were proven to provide better\nresults on the redshift predictions and on the ratio of correctly classified\nobservations though the probability of detection of BAL quasars remains\nrestricted by the low resolution of these spectra as well as by their limited\nsignal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the triggering of some warning flags allows us\nto obtain an extremely pure subset of redshift predictions where approximately\n99% of the observations come along with absolute errors that are below 0.1.\n", "  The local magnetic field induced by $\\mu^{+}$ trapped at an interstitial site\nin a chiral superconductor with $p$-wave symmetry, such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, is\ndiscussed by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation on the two-dimensional\nsquare lattice. In the model Hamiltonian, the effect of the trapped $\\mu^{+}$\nextracting the electrons at surrounding Ru sites is phenomenologically taken\ninto account as a non-magnetic impurity potential which locally destroys the\nchiral superconducting order with $p$-wave symmetry giving rise to local\ncirculating current around $\\mu^{+}$ site. It is shown that the size of the\ninduced local magnetic field in the case with periodic boundary condition is\nfar smaller compared to the case with open boundary condition without\n$\\mu^{+}$, in which the surface current induced by destruction of\nsuperconducting order at the surface boundary gives contribution corresponding\nto the intrinsic angular momentum of the order of $\\hbar N_{\\rm s}/2$, with\n$N_{\\rm s}$ being the number of superconducting electrons. This result\nqualitatively explains why the magnetic field $\\simeq0.5$G measured by $\\mu$SR\nin Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is far smaller than the expected intrinsic magnetic field\n$\\simeq 50$G which is nearly the same as the lower critical field $H_{{\\rm\nc}1}\\simeq 50$G.\n", "  The Venusian surface has been studied by measuring radar reflections and\nthermal radio emission over a wide spectral region of several centimeters to\nmeter wavelengths from the Earth-based as well as orbiter platforms. The\nradiometric observations, in the decimeter (dcm) wavelength regime showed a\ndecreasing trend in the observed brightness temperature (Tb) with increasing\nwavelength. The thermal emission models available at present have not been able\nto explain the radiometric observations at longer wavelength (dcm) to a\nsatisfactory level. This paper reports the first interferometric imaging\nobservations of Venus below 620 MHz. They were carried out at 606, 332.9 and\n239.9 MHz using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The Tb values\nderived at the respective frequencies are 526 K, 409 K and < 426 K, with errors\nof ~7% which are generally consistent with the reported Tb values at 608 MHz\nand 430 MHz by previous investigators, but are much lower than those derived\nfrom high-frequency observations at 1.38-22.46 GHz using the VLA.\n", "  In this work, we present straightforward and concrete computations of the\nunitary irreducible representations of the Euclidean motion group $M(2)$\nemploying the methods of deformation quantization. Deformation quantization is\na quantization method of classical mechanics and is an autonomous approach to\nquantum mechanics, arising from the Wigner quasiprobability distributions and\nWeyl correspondence. We advertise the utility and power of deformation theory\nin Lie group representations. In implementing this idea, many aspects of the\nmethod of orbits is also learned, thus further adding to the mathematical\ntoolkit of the beginning graduate student of physics. Furthermore, the\nessential unity of many topics in mathematics and physics (such as Lie groups\nand Lie algebras, quantization, functional analysis and symplectic geometry) is\nwitnessed, an aspect seldom encountered in textbooks, in an elementary way.\n", "  Magnetic systems exhibiting exchange bias effect are being considered as\nmaterials for applications in data storage devices, sensors and biomedicine. As\nthe size of new mag- netic devices is being continuously reduced, the influence\nof thermally induced instabilities in magnetic order has to be taken into\naccount during their fabrication process. In this study we show the influence\nof superparamagnetism on magnetic properties of exchange-biased [CoO/Co/Pd]10\nmultilayer. We find that the process of progressive thermal blocking of the\nsuperparamagnetic clusters causes an unusually fast rise of the exchange\nanisotropy field and coercivity, and promotes the easy axis switching to\nout-of-plane direction.\n", "  The study of novae is continued and a self-consistent updated physical model\nfor classical/recurrent novae derived from multi-wavelength observations is\npresented. In particular, observations of novae support the origin of the\noptical continuous emission in the outburst ejecta, mass-based segregation and\nclump formation in the ejecta, origin of the Orion, diffuse enhanced lines and\ndust in the clumps, prompt Fe II line formation in swept-up material,\nenergising of electrons to relativistic velocities by the explosion and the\nexistence of a large cool envelope around the accreting white dwarf in\nquiescence. The rapid transfer of thermonuclear energy should be adiabatic\nwhich energises and ejects all the particles in the overlying layers. Our study\nresults in the following conclusions which are relevant for novae and other\nastrophysical systems: (1) Electrons are instantaneously energised to\nrelativistic velocities in the explosion alongside the heavier atoms and ions.\nNo post-ejection shock acceleration needs to be invoked. (2) Rotation of an\nincompressible spherical accreting object leads to a latitude-dependent\npotential such that the accretion rate is maximum at the poles and minimum at\nthe equator. This will form a prolate-shaped envelope. Energetic expulsion of\nthis envelope will result in a bipolar ejecta/outflow. Such outflows cannot be\nejected from non-rotating spherical objects. (3) The latitude-dependent\naccretion rates in a rotating accreting object will also lead to accumulation\nof the infalling matter outside the object in the non-polar regions thus\nforming an accretion disk. The angular momentum of the incoming matter plays no\nrole in the formation of an accretion disk. Accretion disks cannot form around\na non-rotating object.\n", "  From a geometrical viewpoint, according to the theory of relativity, space\nand time constitute a four-dimensional continuum with pseudo-Euclidean\nstructure. This has recently begun to be a practically important statement in\naccelerator physics. An X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) is in fact the best,\nexciting example of an engineering system where improvements in accelerator\ntechnology makes it possible to develop ultrarelativistic macroscopic objects\nwith an internal fine structure, and the theory of relativity plays an\nessential role in their description. An ultrarelativistic electron bunch\nmodulated at nanometer-scale in XFELs has indeed a macroscopic finite-size of\norder of 10 $\\mu$m. Its internal, collective structure is characterized in\nterms of a wave number vector. Here we will show that a four-dimensional\ngeometrical approach, unusual in accelerator physics, is needed to solve\nproblems involving the emission of radiation from an ultrarelativistic\nmodulated electron beam accelerating along a curved trajectory. We will see\nthat relativistic kinematics enters XFEL physics in a most fundamental way\nthrough the so-called Wigner rotation of the modulation wave number vector,\nwhich is closely associated to the relativity of simultaneity. If not taken\ninto account, relativistic kinematics effects would lead to a strong\nqualitative disagreement between theory and experiments. In this paper, several\nexamples of relativistic kinematics effects, which are important for current\nand future XFEL operation, are studied. The theory of relativity is applied by\nproviding details of the clock synchronization procedure within the laboratory\nframe. This approach, exploited here but unusual in literature, is rather\n\"practical\", and should be acceptable to accelerator physicists.\n", "  When streets are designed according to the shared space principle, road user\nare encouraged to interact spontaneously with each other for negotiating the\nspace. These interaction mechanisms do not follow clearly defined traffic rules\nbut rather psychological and social principles related to aspects of safety,\ncomfort and time pressure. However, these principles are hard to capture and to\nquantify, thus making it difficult to simulate the behavior of road users. This\nwork investigates traffic conflict situations between pedestrians and motorized\nvehicles, with the main objective to formulate a discrete choice model for the\nidentification of the proper conflict solving strategy. A shared space street\nin Hamburg, Germany, with high pedestrian volumes is used as a case study for\nmodel formulation and calibration. Conflict situations are detected by an\nautomatic procedure of trajectory prediction and comparison. Standard evasive\nactions are identified, both for pedestrians and vehicles, by observing\nbehavioral patterns. A set of potential parameters, which may affect the choice\nof the evasive action, is formulated and tested for significance. These include\ngeometrical aspects, like distance and speed of the conflicting users, as well\nas conflict-specific ones, like time to collision. A multinomial logit model is\nfinally calibrated and validated on real situations. The developed approach is\nrealistic and ready for implementation in motion models for shared space or any\nother less organized traffic environment.\n", "  The Two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) is one of the most studied extensions of\nthe Standard Model. Like the other popular \"New Physics\" models, it gets more\nand more constrained by recent experimental progress, especially by the LHC\ndata. For the 2HDM types I and II with a softly broken $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry,\nI present updated results of global analyses obtained with the open-source\nHEPfit code, emphasizing the impact of the pre-EPS-HEP 2017 LHC data.\nFurthermore, I discuss the status of implementation into HEPfit of 2HDM's\nbeyond the conventional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric types.\n", "  The Madala hypothesis postulates a new heavy scalar, H, which explains\nseveral independent anomalous features seen in ATLAS and CMS data\nsimultaneously. It has already been discussed and constrained in the literature\nby Run 1 results, and its underlying theory has been explored under the\ninterpretation of a two Higgs doublet model coupled with a scalar singlet, $S$.\nWhen applying the hypothesis to Run 2 results, it can be shown that the\nconstraints from the data are compatible with those obtained using Run 1\nresults.\n", "  Plasmonic nano structures such as wire waveguides or antennas are key\nbuilding blocks for novel highly integrated photonics. A quantitative\nunderstanding of the optical material properties of individual structures on\nthe nanoscale is thus indispensable for predicting and designing the\nfunctionality of complex composite elements. In this letter we study\npropagating surface plasmon polaritons in single silver nanowires isolated from\nits environment by levitation in a linear Paul trap. Symmetry-breaking effects,\ne.g., from supporting substrates are completely eliminated in this way.\nIlluminated with white light from a supercontinuum source, Fabry-P\\`erot-like\nresonances are observed in the scattering spectra obtained from the ends of the\nnanowires. The plasmonic nature of the signal is verified by local excitation\nand photon collection corresponding to a clean transmission measurement through\na Fabry-P\\`erot resonator. A numerical simulation is used to compute the\ncomplex effective refractive indices of the nanowires as input parameter for a\nsimple Fabry-P\\`erot model, which nicely reproduces the measured spectra\ndespite the highly dispersive nature of the system. Our studies pave the way\nfor quantitative characterization of nearly any trappable plasmonic nano\nobject, even of fragile ones such as droplets of liquids or molten metal and of\nnearly any nanoresonator based on a finite waveguide with implications for\nmodeling of complex hybrid structures featuring strong coupling or lasing.\nMoreover, the configuration has the potential to be complemented by gas sensors\nto study the impact of hot electrons on catalytic reactions nearby plasmonic\nparticles.\n", "  A novel breakdown (BD) mechanism of shallow impurity under the electric field\nat low temperatures is suggested for n-GaAs samples with the donor\nconcentrations $N_D=10^{14} \\div 10^{16}cm^{-3}$ and the compensation degree\n$K=\\frac{N_A}{N_D}=0.3 \\div 0.8$ with acceptors of concentration N_A in the\nexternal magnetic fields up to H=6.5~T. Diagnosis of the BD mechanism was\nperformed by SI Zeeman and cyclotron resonance photoelectric spectroscopy\nmethods in the wide interval of the electric field including the BD region too.\nThe obtained results reveal that the BD electric field $\\mathcal{E}_{BD}$ does\nnot correlate with $K$ and the carriers mobility $\\mu$ of the samples, which\ncontradict to the well-known impact ionization mechanism (IIM). A serious\ndiscrepancy with IIM is that, $\\mathcal{E}_{BD}$ does not almost depend on the\nmagnetic field up to H=6.5~T when $\\mathcal{E}\\| H$, though the SI ionization\nenergy increases two times. The cyclotron resonance (CR) measurements show that\nthe line width does not depend on the electric field for\n$\\mathcal{E}<\\mathcal{E}_{BD}$ indicating the lack of free carriers (FC)\nheating in contradiction with IIM. A considerable decrease of the free\ncarriers' capture cross section (CCS) by ionized SI centers with a subsequent\nincrease in the FC concentration n is observed by means of PES investigation of\nthe $1s \\to 2p_{+1}$ and CR lines in the electric fields $\\mathcal{E} \\leq\n\\mathcal{E}_{BD}$ and at different magnetic fields, applied along $H\\|\n\\mathcal{E}$ or perpendicular $H\\perp \\mathcal{E}$ to the electric field.\nVarious effects determined in the PES measurements at $\\mathcal{E} =\n\\mathcal{E}_{BD}$, such as a drastic narrowing the $1s \\to 2p_{+1}$ and CR\nlines, a shift of the CR line to higher magnetic fields and disappearing of the\nlines to higher excited SI states, were clarified to be a result of screening\nof SI Coulomb potential by free carriers.\n", "  The S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star $\\pi^{1}$ Gruis has a known\ncompanion at a separation of $\\approx$400 AU. The envelope structure, including\nan equatorial torus and a fast bipolar outflow, is rarely seen in the AGB phase\nand is particularly unexpected in such a wide binary system. Therefore a\nsecond, closer companion has been suggested, but the evidence is not\nconclusive. The new ALMA $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J$=3-2 data, together with\npreviously published $^{12}$CO $J$=2-1 data from the Submillimeter Array (SMA),\nand the $^{12}$CO $J$=5-4 and $J$=9-8 lines observed with Herschel/Heterodyne\nInstrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI), is modeled with the 3D non-LTE\nradiative transfer code SHAPEMOL. The data analysis clearly confirms the\ntorus-bipolar structure. The 3D model of the CSE that satisfactorily reproduces\nthe data consists of three kinematic components: a radially expanding torus\nwith velocity slowly increasing from 8 to 13 km s$^{-1}$ along the equator\nplane; a radially expanding component at the center with a constant velocity of\n14 km s$^{-1}$; and a fast, bipolar outflow with velocity proportionally\nincreasing from 14 km s$^{-1}$ at the base up to 100 km s$^{-1}$ at the tip,\nfollowing a linear radial dependence. The results are used to estimate an\naverage mass-loss rate during the creation of the torus of 7.7$\\times$10$^{-7}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The total mass and linear momentum of the fast outflow\nare estimated at 7.3$\\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and 9.6$\\times$10$^{37}$ g cm\ns$^{-1}$, respectively. The momentum of the outflow is in excess (by a factor\nof about 20) of what could be generated by radiation pressure alone, in\nagreement with recent findings for more evolved sources. The best-fit model\nalso suggests a $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO abundance ratio of 50. Possible shaping\nscenarios for the gas envelope are discussed\n", "  We report the first axion dark matter search with toroidal geometry.\nExclusion limits of the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}$ over the\naxion mass range from 24.7 to 29.1 $\\mu$eV at the 95\\% confidence level are set\nthrough this pioneering search. Prospects for axion dark matter searches with\nlarger scale toroidal geometry are also given.\n", "  The effect of damping in the wave turbulence regime for thin vibrating plates\nis studied. An experimental method, allowing measurements of dissipation in the\nsystem at all scales, is first introduced. Practical experimental devices for\nincreasing the dissipation are used. The main observable consequence of\nincreasing the damping is a significant modification in the slope of the power\nspectral density, so that the observed power laws are not in a pure inertial\nregime. However, the system still displays a turbulent behavior with a cut-off\nfrequency that is determined by the injected power which does not depend on\ndamping. By using the measured damping power-law in numerical simulations,\nsimilar conclusions are drawn out.\n", "  In this work we present some new results obtained in a study of the phase\ndiagram of charged compact boson stars in a theory involving a complex scalar\nfield with a conical potential coupled to a U(1) gauge field and gravity. We\nhere obtain new bifurcation points in this model. We present a detailed\ndiscussion of the various regions of the phase diagram with respect to the\nbifurcation points. The theory is seen to contain rich physics in a particular\ndomain of the phase diagram.\n", "  In dynamical systems, local interactions between dynamical units generate\ncorrelations which are stored and transmitted throughout the system, generating\nthe macroscopic behavior. However a framework to quantify and study this at the\nmicroscopic scale is missing. Here we propose an 'information processing'\nframework based on Shannon mutual information quantities between the initial\nand future states. We apply it to the 256 elementary cellular automata (ECA),\nwhich are the simplest possible dynamical systems exhibiting behaviors ranging\nfrom simple to complex. Our main finding for ECA is that only a few features\nare needed for full predictability and that the 'information integration'\n(synergy) feature is always most predictive. Finally we apply the formalism to\nforeign exchange (FX) and interest-rate swap (IRS) time series data and find\nthat the 2008 financial crisis marks a sudden and sustained regime shift (FX\nand EUR IRS) resembling tipping point behavior. The USD IRS market exhibits\ninstead a slow and steady progression which appears consistent with the\nhypothesis that this market is (part of) the driving force behind the crisis.\nOur work suggests that the proposed framework is a promising way of predicting\nemergent complex systemic behaviors in terms of the local information\nprocessing of units.\n", "  In this work we study the boson stars and boson shells in a theory involving\nmassive complex scalar fields coupled to the U(1) gauge field and gravity in a\nconical potential in the presence of a cosmological constant ${\\Lambda}$ which\nwe treat as a free parameter taking positive and negative values and thereby\nallowing us to study the theory in the de Sitter and Anti de Sitter spaces\nrespectively. Boson stars are found to come in two types, having either\nball-like or shell-like charge density. We have studied the properties of these\nsolutions and have also determined their domains of existence for some specific\nvalues of the parameters of the theory. Similar solutions have also been\nobtained by Kleihaus, Kunz, Laemmerzahl and List in a theory involving massless\ncomplex scalar fields coupled to the U(1) gauge field and gravity in a conical\npotential in the absence of a cosmological constant ${\\Lambda}$.\n", "  We study the electronic structure of monolayer MoS$_2$ quantum dots subject\nto a perpendicular magnetic field. The coupling between conduction and valence\nband gives rise to mid-gap topological states which localize near the dot edge.\nThese edge states are analogous to those of 1D quantum rings. We show they\npresent a large, Zeeman-like, linear splitting with the magnetic field,\nanticross with the delocalized Fock-Darwin-like states of the dot, give rise to\nAharonov-Bohm-like oscillations of the conduction (valence) band low-lying\nstates in the K (K') valley, and modify the strong field Landau levels limit\nform of the energy spectrum.\n", "  The aim of presented first principles study of La$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$NiO$_{3}$\nis to investigate electronic structure of orthorhombic phase Pbnm. The\ncalculations show that metallicity and magnetism of the system are strongly\nrelated with hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p. To improve the quality of\nthe electronic structure description of the system, especially the treatment of\ncorrelation for the Ni 3d, we employ GGA, LDA, and GGA+U, LDA+U. The LSDA\nresults give good agreement with experiment. Thus, the screening effects\noriginating from the hybridized 3d and O 2p electrons are sufficiently strong\nthat they reduce the electronic correlations in the\nLa$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$NiO$_{3}$, making it a weakly correlated metal.\n", "  On the basis of two requirements: the avoidance of the curvature singularity\nand the Maxwell theory as the weak field limit of the nonlinear\nelectrodynamics, we find two restricted conditions on the metric function of\n$(2+1)$-dimensional regular black hole in general relativity coupled with\nnonlinear electrodynamics sources. By the use of the two conditions, we obtain\na general approach to construct $(2+1)$-dimensional regular black holes. In\nthis manner, we construct four $(2+1)$-dimensional regular black holes as\nexamples. We also study the thermodynamic properties of the regular black holes\nand verify the first law of black hole thermodynamics.\n", "  Understanding the effect of glassy dynamics on the stability of\nbio-macromolecules and investigating the underlying relaxation processes\ngoverning degradation processes of these macromolecules are of immense\nimportance in the context of bio-preservation. In this work we have studied the\nstability of a model polymer chain in a supercooled glass-forming liquid at\ndifferent amount of supercooling in order to understand how dynamics of\nsupercooled liquids influence the collapse behavior of the polymer. Our\nsystematic computer simulation studies find that apart from long time\nrelaxation processes ($\\alpha$ relaxation), short time dynamics of the\nsupercooled liquid, known as $\\beta$ relaxation plays an important role in\ncontrolling the stability of the model polymer. This is in agreement with some\nrecent experimental findings. These observations are in stark contrast with the\ncommon belief that only long time relaxation processes are the sole player. We\nfind convincing evidence that suggest that one might need to review the the\nvitrification hypothesis which postulates that $\\alpha$ relaxations control the\ndynamics of biomolecules and thus $\\alpha$-relaxation time should be considered\nfor choosing appropriate bio-preservatives. We hope that our results will lead\nto understand the primary factors in protein stabilization in the context of\nbio-preservation.\n", "  Atmospheric tides can have a strong impact on the rotational dynamics of\nplanets. They are of most importance for terrestrial planets located in the\nhabitable zone of their host star, where their competition with solid tides is\nlikely to drive the body towards non-synchronized rotation states of\nequilibrium, as observed in the case of Venus. Contrary to other planetary\nlayers, the atmosphere is sensitive to both gravitational and thermal forcings,\nthrough a complex dynamical coupling involving the effects of Coriolis\nacceleration and characteristics of the atmospheric structure. These key\nphysics are usually not taken into account in modelings used to compute the\nevolution of planetary systems, where tides are described with parametrised\nprescriptions. In this work, we present a new ab initio modeling of atmospheric\ntides adapting the theory of the Earth's atmospheric tides (Chapman & Lindzen\n1970) to other terrestrial planets. We derive analytic expressions of the tidal\ntorque, as a function of the tidal frequency and parameters characterizing the\ninternal structure (e.g. the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency, the radiative\nfrequency, the pressure heigh scale). We show that stratification plays a key\nrole, the tidal torque being strong in the case of convective atmospheres (i.e.\nwith a neutral stratification) and weak in case of atmosphere convectively\nstable. In a second step, the model is used to determine the non-synchronized\nrotation states of equilibrium of Venus-like planets as functions of the\nphysical parameters of the system. These results are detailed in\nAuclair-Desrotour et al. (2017a) and Auclair-Desrotour et al. (2017b).\n", "  We define equivariant open Gromov-Witten invariants for\n$\\mathbb{R}\\mathbb{P}^{2m} \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{2m}$ as sums\nof integrals of equivariant forms over resolution spaces, which are blowups of\nproducts of moduli spaces of stable disc-maps modeled on trees. These\ninvariants encode the quantum deformation of the equivariant cohomology of\n$\\mathbb{R}\\mathbb{P}^{2m}$ by holomorphic discs in $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^{2m}$\nand, for $m=1$, specialize to give Welschinger's signed count of real rational\nplanar curves in the non-equivariant limit.\n", "  Grain boundaries in graphene are inherent in wafer-scale samples prepared by\nchemical vapor deposition. They can strongly influence the mechanical\nproperties and electronic and heat transport in graphene. In this work, we\nemploy extensive molecular dynamics simulations to study thermal transport in\nlarge suspended polycrystalline graphene samples. Samples of different\ncontrolled grain sizes are prepared by a recently developed efficient\nmultiscale approach based on the phase field crystal model. In contrast to\nprevious works, our results show that the scaling of the thermal conductivity\nwith the grain size implies bimodal behaviour with two effective Kapitza\nlengths. The scaling is dominated by the out-of-plane (flexural) phonons with a\nKapitza length that is an order of magnitude larger than that of the in-plane\nphonons. We also show that in order to get quantitative agreement with the most\nrecent experiments, quantum corrections need to be applied to both the Kapitza\nconductance of grain boundaries and the thermal conductivity of pristine\ngraphene and the corresponding Kapitza lengths must be renormalized\naccordingly.\n", "  Humanity's efforts to transmute lead into gold have impelled civilizations.\nOur efforts to transmute human experience into objective laws have enjoyed\nsimilar success. Through thinkers such as Oliver Wendell Holmes, William James,\nFelix S. Cohen, Carol E. Cleland, Russell K. Standish and Christopher A. Fuchs\nwe can see that a source of the difficulty in understanding phenomena via\nobjective laws is that the law can best be understood as a quantum system, not\na classical one. Law resembles a quantum system because maximal legal\ninformation is not complete and cannot be completed.\n", "  Using one high dispersion high quality spectrum of Vega (HR7001, A0V)\nobtained with the echelle spectrograph SOPHIE at Observatoire de Haute\nProvence, we have measured the centroids of 149 flat-bottomed lines. The model\natmosphere and spectrum synthesis modeling of the spectrum of Vega allows us to\nprovide identifications for all these lines. Most of these lines are due to C\nI, O I, Mg I, Al I, Ca I, Sc II,Ti II, Cr I, Cr II, Mn I, Fe I, Fe II, Sr II,\nBa II, the large majority being due to neutral species, in particular Fe I.\n", "  We explain our strong disagreement with the statement about \"several\nscientific errors\" in our paper [arXiv:1407.6619] and highlight the validity of\nour approach, which had been already confirmed in the well-known experiments by\nMillikan.\n", "  We show, theoretically, that the phase of the interlayer exchange coupling\n(IEC) undergoes a topological change of approximately $2\\pi$ as the chemical\npotential of the ferromagnetic (FM) lead moves across a hybridization gap (HG).\nThe effect is largely independent of the detailed parameters of the system, in\nparticular the width of the gap. The implication is that for a narrow gap, a\nsmall perturbation in the chemical potential of the lead can give a sign\nreversal of the exchange coupling. This offers the possibility of controlling\nmagnetization switching in spintronic devices such as MRAM, with little power\nconsumption. Furthermore we believe that this effect has already been\nindirectly observed, in existing measurements of the IEC as a function of\ntemperature and of doping of the leads.\n", "  The wings in different insect species are morphologically distinct with\nregards to their size, outer contour (margin) shape, venation, and\npigmentation. The basis of the diversity of wing margin shapes remains unknown,\ndespite the fact that gene networks governing the Drosophila wing development\nhave been well characterised. Among the different types of wing margin shapes,\nsmoothly curved contour is the most frequently found and implies the existence\nof a highly organised, multicellular mechanical structure. Here, we developed a\nmechanical model for diversified insect wing margin shapes, in which\nnon-uniform bending stiffness of the wing margin is considered. We showed that\na variety of spatial distribution of the bending stiffness could reproduce\ndiverse wing margin shapes. Moreover, the inference of the distribution of the\nbending stiffness from experimental images indicates a common spatial profile\namong insects tested. We further studied the effect of the intrinsic tension of\nthe wing blade on the margin shape and on the inferred bending stiffness.\nFinally, we implemented the bending stiffness of the wing margin in the cell\nvertex model of the wing blade, and confirmed that the hybrid model retains the\nessential feature of the margin model. We propose that in addition to\nmorphogenetic processes in the wing blade, the spatial profile of the bending\nstiffness in the wing margin can play a pivotal role in shaping insect wings.\n", "  We study heat transport across individual grain boundaries in suspended\nmonolayer graphene using extensive classical molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. We construct bicrystalline graphene samples containing grain\nboundaries with symmetric tilt angles using the two-dimensional phase field\ncrystal method and then relax the samples with MD. The corresponding Kapitza\nresistances are then computed using nonequilibrium MD simulations. We find that\nthe Kapitza resistance depends strongly on the tilt angle and shows a clear\ncorrelation with the average density of defects in a given grain boundary, but\nis not strongly correlated with the grain boundary line tension. We also show\nthat quantum effects are significant in quantitative determination of the\nKapitza resistance by applying the mode-by-mode quantum correction to the\nclassical MD data. The corrected data are in good agreement with quantum\nmechanical Landauer-B\\\"utticker calculations.\n", "  Motivated by experiments on the generation of streaming plasmas in high\nenergy density facilities, industrial setups, and fundamental dusty plasma\nresearch the plasma polarization around a test charge in streaming plasmas is\nconsidered. The induced charge density distribution of plasma constituents is\ndiscussed for the subsonic, sonic, and supersonic regime. Also, it is shown\nthat the plasma polarization in the vicinity of the test charge shows different\nscaling in subsonic and supersonic regimes.\n", "  A comprehensive review of the measurements of $\\tau$ lepton mass and $R$\nvalues in the energy region between $2-5$ GeV, achieved at the BES experiment,\nis presented. In addition to the evaluation of their impact on the test of\nStandard Model, we also highlighted the present status and the most recent\ndevelopments. In particular, we made an extensive discussion on the prospects\nfor future improvements at the BESIII experiment.\n", "  In this paper, regularity properties, Strichartz type estimates to solutions\nof multipo{\\i}nt Cauchy problem for linear and nonlinear abstract wave\nequations in vector-valued function spaces are obtained. The equation includes\na linear operator A defined in a Hilbert space H, in which by choosing H and A\nwe can obtain numerous classis of nonlocal initial value problems for wave\nequations which occur in a wide variety of physical systems.\n", "  Measuring the brightness of the night sky has become an increasingly\nimportant topic in recent years, as artificial lights and their scattering by\nthe Earths atmosphere continue spreading around the globe. Several instruments\nand techniques have been developed for this task. We give an overview of these,\nand discuss their strengths and limitations. The different quantities that can\nand should be derived when measuring the night sky brightness are discussed, as\nwell as the procedures that have been and still need to be defined in this\ncontext. We conclude that in many situations, calibrated consumer digital\ncameras with fisheye lenses provide the best relation between ease-of-use and\nwealth of obtainable information on the night sky. While they do not obtain\nfull spectral information, they are able to sample the complete sky in a period\nof minutes, with colour information in three bands. This is important, as given\nthe current global changes in lamp spectra, changes in sky radiance observed\nonly with single band devices may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding long\nterm changes in sky brightness. The acquisition of all-sky information is\ndesirable, as zenith-only information does not provide an adequate\ncharacterization of a site. Nevertheless, zenith-only single-band one-channel\ndevices such as the Sky Quality Meter continue to be a viable option for\nlong-term studies of night sky brightness and for studies conducted from a\nmoving platform. Accurate interpretation of such data requires some\nunderstanding of the colour composition of the sky light. We recommend\nsupplementing long-term time series derived with such devices with periodic\nall-sky sampling by a calibrated camera system and calibrated luxmeters or\nluminance meters.\n", "  NASA regards data handling and archiving as an integral part of space\nmissions, and has a strong track record of serving astrophysics data to the\npublic, beginning with the the IRAS satellite in 1983. Archives enable a major\nscience return on the significant investment required to develop a space\nmission. In fact, the presence and accessibility of an archive can more than\ndouble the number of papers resulting from the data. In order for the community\nto be able to use the data, they have to be able to find the data (ease of\naccess) and interpret the data (ease of use). Funding of archival research\n(e.g., the ADAP program) is also important not only for making scientific\nprogress, but also for encouraging authors to deliver data products back to the\narchives to be used in future studies. NASA has also enabled a robust system\nthat can be maintained over the long term, through technical innovation and\ncareful attention to resource allocation. This article provides a brief\noverview of some of NASA's major astrophysics archive systems, including IRSA,\nMAST, HEASARC, KOA, NED, the Exoplanet Archive, and ADS.\n", "  We document the data transfer workflow, data transfer performance, and other\naspects of staging approximately 56 terabytes of climate model output data from\nthe distributed Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archive to the\nNational Energy Research Supercomputing Center (NERSC) at the Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory required for tracking and characterizing extratropical\nstorms, a phenomena of importance in the mid-latitudes. We present this\nanalysis to illustrate the current challenges in assembling multi-model data\nsets at major computing facilities for large-scale studies of CMIP5 data.\nBecause of the larger archive size of the upcoming CMIP6 phase of model\nintercomparison, we expect such data transfers to become of increasing\nimportance, and perhaps of routine necessity. We find that data transfer rates\nusing the ESGF are often slower than what is typically available to US\nresidences and that there is significant room for improvement in the data\ntransfer capabilities of the ESGF portal and data centers both in terms of\nworkflow mechanics and in data transfer performance. We believe performance\nimprovements of at least an order of magnitude are within technical reach using\ncurrent best practices, as illustrated by the performance we achieved in\ntransferring the complete raw data set between two high performance computing\nfacilities. To achieve these performance improvements, we recommend: that\ncurrent best practices (such as the Science DMZ model) be applied to the data\nservers and networks at ESGF data centers; that sufficient financial and human\nresources be devoted at the ESGF data centers for systems and network\nengineering tasks to support high performance data movement; and that\nperformance metrics for data transfer between ESGF data centers and major\ncomputing facilities used for climate data analysis be established, regularly\ntested, and published.\n", "  Networks out of equilibrium display dynamics characterized by multiple\nequilibria and sudden transitions. These transitions arise when each node\nleaves its natural stable state and joins to an organized global activation\nbehavior. In this paper, we study local patterns near regime shifts in Network\nSynchronization and Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) by a Koopman spectrum\ndata-driven approach. To illustrate these ideas, we use synchronized behavior\nfrom an Integral-and-Fire oscillators (IFO) system and SOC in the Bak-Sneppen\nmodel.\n", "  Statistical estimation theory determines the optimal way of estimating\nparameters of a fluctuating noisy signal. However, if the estimation is\nperformed on unreliable hardware, a sub-optimal estimation procedure can\noutperform the previously optimal procedure. Here, we compare classes of\ncircadian clocks by viewing them as phase estimators for the periodic day-night\nlight signal. We find that continuous attractor-based free running clocks, such\nas those found in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus and humans, are\nnearly optimal phase estimators since their flat attractor directions\nefficiently project out light intensity fluctuations due to weather patterns\n(`external noise'). However, such flat directions also make these continuous\nlimit cycle attractors highly vulnerable to diffusive 'internal noise'. Given\nsuch unreliable biochemical hardware, we find that point attractor-based damped\nclocks, such as those found in a smaller cyanobacterium with low protein copy\nnumber, Prochlorococcus marinus, outperform continuous attractor-based clocks.\nBy interpolating between the two types of clocks found in these organisms, we\ndemonstrate a family of biochemical phase estimation strategies that are best\nsuited to different relative strengths of external and internal noise.\n", "  A lattice Maxwell system is developed with gauge-symmetry, symplectic\nstructure and discrete space-time symmetry. Noether's theorem for Lie group\nsymmetries is generalized to discrete symmetries for the lattice Maxwell\nsystem. As a result, the lattice Maxwell system is shown to admit a discrete\nlocal energy-momentum conservation law corresponding to the discrete space-time\nsymmetry. These conservative properties make the discrete system an effective\nalgorithm for numerically solving the governing differential equations on\ncontinuous space-time. Moreover, the lattice model, respecting all conservation\nlaws and geometric structures, is as good as and probably more preferable than\nthe continuous Maxwell model. Under the simulation hypothesis by Bostrom and in\nconsistent with the discussion on lattice QCD by Beane et al., the two\ninterpretations of physics laws on space-time lattice could be essentially the\nsame.\n", "  In this presentation, we describe the computation of higher-order QED effects\nrelevant in hadronic collisions. In particular, we discuss the calculation of\nmixed QCD-QED one-loop contributions to the Altarelli-Parisi splittings\nfunctions, as well as the pure two-loop QED corrections. We explain how to\nextend the DGLAP equations to deal with new parton distributions, emphasizing\nthe consequences of the novel corrections in the determination (and evolution)\nof the photon distributions.\n", "  There has been much theoretical speculation about the existence of a deeply\nbounded tetra-bottom state. Such a state would not be expected to be more than\na GeV below $\\Upsilon\\Upsilon$ threshold. If such a state exists below the\n$\\eta_b\\eta_b$ threshold it would be narrow, as Zweig allowed strong decays are\nkinematically forbidden. Given the observation of $\\Upsilon$ pair production at\nCMS, such a state with a large branching fraction into $\\Upsilon \\Upsilon^*$ is\nlikely discoverable at the LHC. The discovery mode is similar to the SM Higgs\ndecaying into four leptons through the $Z Z^*$ channel. The testable features\nof both production and the four lepton decays of such a tetra-bottom ground\nstate are presented. The assumptions required for each feature are identified,\nallowing the application of our results more generally to a resonance decaying\ninto four charged leptons (through the $\\Upsilon\\Upsilon^*$ channel) in the\nsame mass region.\n", "  We report on the behaviour of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) developed for\nmuon detection in ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) experiments. The RPCs\nwere developed for the MARTA project and were tested on field conditions. These\nRPCs cover an area of $1.5 \\times 1.2\\,{m^2}$ and are instrumented with 64\npickup electrodes providing a segmentation better than $20\\,$cm. By shielding\nthe detector units with enough slant mass to absorb the electromagnetic\ncomponent in the air showers, a clean measurement of the muon content is\nallowed, a concept to be implemented in a next generation of UHECR experiments.\nThe operation of a ground array detector poses challenging demands, as the RPC\nmust operate remotely under extreme environmental conditions, with limited\nbudgets for power and minimal maintenance. The RPC, DAQ, High Voltage and\nmonitoring systems are enclosed in an aluminium-sealed case, providing a\ncompact and robust unit suited for outdoor environments, which can be easily\ndeployed and connected. The RPCs developed at LIP-Coimbra are able to operate\nusing a very low gas flux, which allows running them for few years with a small\ngas reservoir. Several prototypes have already been built and tested both in\nthe laboratory and outdoors. We report on the most recent tests done in the\nfield that show that the developed RPCs have operated in a stable way for more\nthan 2 years in field conditions.\n", "  We consider a problem we call StateIsomorphism: given two quantum states of n\nqubits, can one be obtained from the other by rearranging the qubit subsystems?\nOur main goal is to study the complexity of this problem, which is a natural\nquantum generalisation of the problem StringIsomorphism. We show that\nStateIsomorphism is at least as hard as GraphIsomorphism, and show that these\nproblems have a similar structure by presenting evidence to suggest that\nStateIsomorphism is an intermediate problem for QCMA. In particular, we show\nthat the complement of the problem, StateNonIsomorphism, has a two message\nquantum interactive proof system, and that this proof system can be made\nstatistical zero-knowledge. We consider also StabilizerStateIsomorphism (SSI)\nand MixedStateIsomorphism (MSI), showing that the complement of SSI has a\nquantum interactive proof system that uses classical communication only, and\nthat MSI is QSZK-hard.\n", "  Estimation of social influence in networks can be substantially biased in\nobservational studies due to homophily and network correlation in exposure to\nexogenous events. Randomized experiments, in which the researcher intervenes in\nthe social system and uses randomization to determine how to do so, provide a\nmethodology for credibly estimating of causal effects of social behaviors. In\naddition to addressing questions central to the social sciences, these\nestimates can form the basis for effective marketing and public policy.\n  In this review, we discuss the design space of experiments to measure social\ninfluence through combinations of interventions and randomizations. We define\nan experiment as combination of (1) a target population of individuals\nconnected by an observed interaction network, (2) a set of treatments whereby\nthe researcher will intervene in the social system, (3) a randomization\nstrategy which maps individuals or edges to treatments, and (4) a measurement\nof an outcome of interest after treatment has been assigned. We review\nexperiments that demonstrate potential experimental designs and we evaluate\ntheir advantages and tradeoffs for answering different types of causal\nquestions about social influence. We show how randomization also provides a\nbasis for statistical inference when analyzing these experiments.\n", "  Saturn's moon Enceladus has vents emerging from a sub-surface ocean, offering\nunique probes into the liquid environment. These vents drain into the larger\nneutral torus in orbit around Saturn. We present a methanol (CH3OH) detection\nobserved with IRAM 30-m from 2008 along the line-of-sight through Saturn's\nE-ring. Additionally, we also present supporting observations from the Herschel\npublic archive of water (ortho-H2O; 1669.9 GHz) from 2012 at a similar\nelongation and line-of-sight. The CH3OH 5(1,1)-4(1,1) transition was detected\nat 5.9 sigma confidence. The line has 0.43 km/s width and is offset by +8.1\nkm/s in the moon's reference frame. Radiative transfer models allow for gas\ncloud dimensions from 1750 km up to the telescope beam diameter ~73000 km.\nTaking into account the CH3OH lifetime against solar photodissociation and the\nredshifted line velocity, there are two possible explanations for the CH3OH\nemission: methanol is primarily a secondary product of chemical interactions\nwithin the neutral torus that (1) spreads outward throughout the E-ring or (2)\noriginates from a compact, confined gas cloud lagging Enceladus by several\nkm/s. We find either scenario to be consistent with significant redshifted H2O\nemission (4 sigma) measured from the Herschel public archive. The measured\nCH3OH:H2O abundance (> 0.5 per cent) significantly exceeds the observed\nabundance in the direct vicinity of the vents (~0.01 per cent), suggesting\nCH3OH is likely chemically processed within the gas cloud with methane (CH4) as\nits parent species.\n", "  Measuring radon-due neutron flux at various altitude (100, 1000, 1700, 4300 m\nabove sea level) we found an evidence of significant increase of radon\nconcentration with altitude. It was also conirmed by direct radon measurements\nat high altitude. This allowed us to assume cosmic rays could take part in\nprocess of soil activation: they transform long-lived nuclei of uranium and\nthorium to nuclei with shorter life-time through specific nuclear reactions. If\nthe resulting nuclei belong to the U-238 radioactive chain they can lead to\nproducion of Ra-226 and then to Rn-222, thus significantly increasing its\nproduction at high altitudes where cosmic ray flux is high.\n"]}
