We\nrestrict ourselves to the $\\Delta>0$ and $D>0$ case for simplicity. Our main\npurpose is to obtain the definite conclusion whether there exists or not the\nintermediate-$D$ (ID) phase, which was proposed by Oshikawa in 1992 and has\nbeen believed to be absent since the DMRG studies in the latter half of 1990's.\nIn the phase diagram with $\\Delta>0$ and $D>0$ there appear the XY state, the\nHaldane state, the ID state, the large-$D$ (LD) state and the N\\'eel state. In\nthe analysis of the numerical data it is important to distinguish three gapped\nstates; the Haldane state, the ID state and the LD state. We give a physical\nand intuitive explanation for our level spectroscopy method how to distinguish\nthese three phases.\n", "  We study the physics of the superconducting variant of Weyl semimetals, which\nmay be realized in multilayer structures comprising topological insulators and\nsuperconductors. We show how superconductivity can split each Weyl node into\ntwo. The resulting Bogoliubov Weyl nodes can be pairwise independently\ncontrolled, allowing to access a set of phases characterized by different\nnumbers of bulk Bogoliubov Weyl nodes and chiral Majorana surface modes. We\nanalyze the physics of vortices in such systems, which trap zero energy\nMajorana modes only under certain conditions. We finally comment on possible\nexperimental probes, thereby also exploiting the similarities between Weyl\nsuperconductors and 2-dimensional p + ip superconductors.\n", "  This paper introduces a library of algorithms for representing cloud\nmicrophysics in numerical models. The library is written in C++, hence the name\nlibcloudph++. In the current release, the library covers three warm-rain\nschemes: the single- and double-moment bulk schemes, and the particle-based\nscheme with Monte-Carlo coalescence. The three schemes are intended for\nmodelling frameworks of different dimensionality and complexity ranging from\nparcel models to multi-dimensional cloud-resolving (e.g. large-eddy)\nsimulations. A two-dimensional prescribed-flow framework is used in example\nsimulations presented in the paper with the aim of highlighting the library\nfeatures. The libcloudph++ and all its mandatory dependencies are free and\nopen-source software. The Boost.units library is used for zero-overhead\ndimensional analysis of the code at compile time. The particle-based scheme is\nimplemented using the Thrust library that allows to leverage the power of\ngraphics processing units (GPU), retaining the possibility to compile the\nunchanged code for execution on single or multiple standard processors (CPUs).\nThe paper includes complete description of the programming interface (API) of\nthe library and a performance analysis including comparison of GPU and CPU\nsetups.\n", "  We consider the distribution of the values at real points of random functions\nwhich belong to the Herglotz-Pick (HP) class of analytic mappings of the upper\nhalf plane into itself. It is shown that under mild stationarity assumptions\nthe individual values of HP functions with singular spectra have a Cauchy type\ndistribution. The statement applies to the diagonal matrix elements of random\noperators, and holds regardless of the presence or not of level repulsion, i.e.\napplies to both random matrix and Poisson-type spectra.\n", "  We use the method of group contractions to relate wavelets analysis and Gabor\nanalysis. Wavelets analysis is associated with unitary irreducible\nrepresentations of the affine group while Gabor analysis is associated with\nunitary irreducible representations of the Heisenberg group. We obtain unitary\nirreducible representations of the Heisenberg group as contractions of\nrepresentations of the extended affine group. Furthermore, we use these\ncontractions to relate the two analyses, namely we contract coherent states,\nresolutions of the identity, and tight frames. In order to obtain the standard\nGabor frame we construct a family of time localized wavelets frames that\ncontract to that Gabor frame. Starting from a standard wavelets frame we\nconstruct a family of frequency localized wavelets frames that contract to a\nnonstandard Gabor frame. In particular we deform Gabor frames to wavelets\nframes.\n", "  We study theoretically the noise-assisted quantum exciton (electron) transfer\n(ET) in bio-complexes consisting of a single-level electron donor and an\nacceptor which has a complicated internal structure, and is modeled by many\nelectron energy levels. Interactions are included between the donor and the\nacceptor energy levels and with the protein-solvent noisy environment.\nDifferent regions of parameters are considered, which characterize (i) the\nnumber of the acceptor levels, (ii) the acceptor \\band-width\", and (iii) the\namplitude of noise and its correlation time. Under some conditions, we derive\nanalytical expressions for the ET rate and efficiency. We obtain equal\noccupation of all levels at large times, independently of the structure of the\nacceptor band and the noise parameters, but under the condition of\nnon-degeneracy of the acceptor energy levels. We discuss the multi-scale\ndynamics of the acceptor population, and the accompanying effect of quantum\ncoherent oscillations. We also demonstrate that for large number of levels in\nthe acceptor band, the efficiency of ET can be close to 100%, for both downhill\nand uphill transitions and for sharp and at redox potentials.\n", "  Random operators may acquire extended states formed from a multitude of\nmutually resonating local quasi-modes. This mechanics is explored here in the\ncontext of the random Schr\\\"odinger operator on the complete graph. The\noperators exhibits local quasi modes mixed through a single channel. While most\nof its spectrum consists of localized eigenfunctions, under appropriate\nconditions it includes also bands of states which are delocalized in the\n$\\ell^1$-though not in $\\ell^2$-sense, where the eigenvalues have the\nstatistics of \\v{S}eba spectra. The analysis proceeds through some general\nobservations on the scaling limits of random functions in the Herglotz-Pick\nclass. The results are in agreement with a heuristic condition for the\nemergence of resonant delocalization, which is stated in terms of the tunneling\namplitude among quasi-modes.\n", "  We introduce the $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ group action on a partition\nfunction of a Cohomological field theory via the certain Givental's action.\nRestricted to the small phase space we describe the action via the explicit\nformulae on a CohFT genus $g$ potential. We prove that applied to the total\nancestor potential of a simple elliptic singularity the action introduced\ncoincides with the transformation of Milanov--Ruan changing the primitive form\n(cf. arXiv:1106.2321).\n", "  We performed high-resolution numerical simulations of hydrodynamic turbulence\nwith and without mean velocity ($U_0=0,10$), and demonstrate the sweeping\neffect. For $U_0=0$, the velocity correlation function, $C({\\bf k},\\tau)$\ndecays with time due to eddy viscosity, but it also shows fluctuations due to\nthe sweeping effect. For $U_0=10$, $C({\\bf k},\\tau)$ exhibits damped\noscillations with the frequency of $U_0 k$ and decay time scale corresponding\nto the $U_0=0$ case. A closer examination of $\\Im[C({\\bf k},\\tau)]$ also\ndemonstrates sweeping effect for $U_0=10$. We also demonstrate that the\nfrequency spectra of the velocity fields measured by real-space probes are\nrespectively $f^{-2}$ and $f^{-5/3}$ for $U_0=0$ and 10; these spectra are\nrelated to the Lagrangian and Eulerian space-time correlations.\n", "  We describe a simple and consistent quantum mathematical model that simulates\nthe possible role of quantum interference and sink effects in the\nnonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). Our\nmodel consists of a network of five interconnected sites (excitonic states)\nresponsible for the NPQ mechanism: (i) Two excited states of chlorophyll\nmolecules, $ChlA^*$ and $ChlB^*$, forming an LHC dimer, which is initially\npopulated; (ii) A \"damaging\" site which is responsible for production of\nsinglet oxygen and other destructive outcomes; (iii) The $(ChlA-Zea)^*$\nheterodimer excited state (Zea indicates zeaxanthin); and (iv) The charge\ntransfer state of this heterodimer, $(ChlA^{-}-Zea^{+})^*$. In our model, both\ndamaging and charge transfer states are described by discrete electron energy\nlevels attached to their sinks, that mimic the continuum part of electron\nenergy spectrum, as at these sites the electron participates in\nquasi-irreversible chemical reactions. All five excitonic sites interact with\nthe protein environment that is modeled using a stochastic approach. As an\nexample, we apply our model to demonstrate possible contributions of quantum\ninterference and sink effects in the NPQ mechanism in the CP29 minor LHC. Our\nnumerical results on the quantum dynamics of the reduced density matrix,\ndemonstrate a possible way to significantly suppress, under some conditions,\nthe damaging channel using quantum interference effects and sinks. The results\ndemonstrate the possible role of interference and sink effects for modeling,\nengineering, and optimizing the performance of the NPQ processes in both\nnatural and artificial light-harvesting complexes.\n", "  Discussed here are criteria for the existence of continuous components in the\nspectra of operators with random potential. First, the essential condition for\nthe Simon-Wolff criterion is shown to be measurable at infinity. By\nimplication, for the iid case and more generally potentials with the K-property\nthe criterion is boosted by a zero-one law. The boosted criterion, combined\nwith tunneling estimates, is then applied for sufficiency conditions for the\npresence of continuous spectrum for random Schr\\\"odinger operators. The general\nproof strategy which this yields is modeled on the resonant delocalization\narguments by which continuous spectrum in the presence of disorder was\npreviously established for random operators on tree graphs. In another\napplication of the Simon-Wolff rank-one analysis we prove the almost sure\nsimplicity of the pure point spectrum for operators with random potentials of\nconditionally continuous distribution.\n", "  We consider the $Z_2$ topology of the Dirac lines, i.e., lines of band\ncontacts, on an example of graphite. Four lines --- three with topological\ncharge $N_1=1$ each and one with $N_1=-1$ --- merge together near the H-point\nand annihilate due to summation law $1+1+1-1=0$. The merging point is similar\nto the real-space nexus, an analog of the Dirac monopole at which the $Z_2$\nstrings terminate.\n", "  We carry out a systematic study of entanglement entropy in nonrelativistic\nconformal field theories via holographic techniques. After a discussion of\nrecent results concerning Galilean conformal field theories, we deduce a novel\nexpression for the entanglement entropy of (1+1)-dimensional Lifshitz field\ntheories --- this is done both at zero and finite temperature. Based on these\nresults, we pose a conjecture for the anomaly coefficient of a Lifshitz field\ntheory dual to new massive gravity. It is found that the Lifshitz entanglement\nentropy at finite temperature displays a striking similarity with that\ncorresponding to a flat space cosmology in three dimensions. We claim that this\nstructure is an inherent feature of the entanglement entropy for\nnonrelativistic conformal field theories. We finish by exploring the behavior\nof the mutual information for such theories.\n", "  Chiral anomaly observed in the chiral superfluid $^3$He-A is the result of\nthe combined effect of the real space and momentum space topologies. This\neffect incorporates several topological charges in the extended $({\\bf k},{\\bf\nr})$-space, which is beyond the conventional chiral anomaly in the relativistic\nsystems.\n", "  We study the growth of norms of ergodic integrals for the translation action\non spaces coming from expansive, self-affine Delone sets. The linear map giving\nthe self-affinity induces a renormalization map on the pattern space and we\nshow that the rate of growth of ergodic integrals is controlled by the induced\naction of the renormalizing map on the cohomology of the pattern space up to\nboundary errors. We explore the consequences for the diffraction of such Delone\nsets, and explore in detail what the picture is for substitution tilings as\nwell as for cut and project sets which are self-affine. We also explicitly\ncompute some examples.\n", "  We formulate an effective theory of structure formation (ETHOS) that enables\ncosmological structure formation to be computed in almost any microphysical\nmodel of dark matter physics. This framework maps the detailed microphysical\ntheories of particle dark matter interactions into the physical effective\nparameters that shape the linear matter power spectrum and the self-interaction\ntransfer cross section of non-relativistic dark matter. These are the input to\nstructure formation simulations, which follow the evolution of the cosmological\nand galactic dark matter distributions. Models with similar effective\nparameters in ETHOS but with different dark particle physics would nevertheless\nresult in similar dark matter distributions. We present a general method to map\nan ultraviolet complete or effective field theory of low energy dark matter\nphysics into parameters that affect the linear matter power spectrum and carry\nout this mapping for several representative particle models. We further propose\na simple but useful choice for characterizing the dark matter self-interaction\ntransfer cross section that parametrizes self-scattering in structure formation\nsimulations. Taken together, these effective parameters in ETHOS allow the\nclassification of dark matter theories according to their structure formation\nproperties rather than their intrinsic particle properties, paving the way for\nfuture simulations to span the space of viable dark matter physics relevant for\nstructure formation.\n", "  2D Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) is used as a toy model for 4D quantum\ngravity and is the theory of world-sheet in string theory. Recently there has\nbeen growing interest in studying LQG in the realm of probability theory:\nDavid, Kupiainen, Rhodes, Vargas (2014) and Duplantier, Miller, Sheffield\n(2014) both provide a probabilistic perspective of the LQG on the 2D sphere. In\nparticular, in each of them one may find a definition of the so-called unit\narea quantum sphere. We examine these two perspectives and prove their\nequivalence by showing that the respective unit area quantum spheres are the\nsame. This is done by considering a unified limiting procedure for defining\nboth objects.\n", "  In our empirical works, we find that there exists the equivalency of the\ncumulative degree distribution and edge-cumulative distribution. Furthermore,\nwe employ three network models of the recursive graphs, Sierpinksi networks and\nApollonian networks to verify our conjecture: \\emph{Both the cumulative degree\ndistribution and the edge-cumulative distribution are equivalent to each other\nin deterministic network models}\n", "  In these lecture notes, partly based on a course taught at the Karpacz Winter\nSchool in March 2014, we explore the close connections between non-adiabatic\nresponse of a system with respect to macroscopic parameters and the geometry of\nquantum and classical states. We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge\npotentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in\nquantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in\nclassical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these\npotentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge\npotentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry\ncurvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In\nclassical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an\naverage over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we\nshow that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge\npotentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical\nobservables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically\ndemonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of\nLorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this\nformalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in\nvarious systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic\nparameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond\nmacroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with a\nnumber of simple examples and highlight a few more complicated ones drawn from\nrecent literature.\n", "  Quantum information theory determines the maximum rates at which information\ncan be transmitted through physical systems described by quantum mechanics.\nHere we consider the communication protocol known as quantum reading. Quantum\nreading is a protocol for retrieving the information stored in a digital memory\nby using a quantum probe, e.g., shining quantum states of light to read an\noptical memory. In a variety of situations using a quantum probe enhances the\nperformances of the reading protocol in terms of fidelity, data density and\nenergy dissipation. Here we review and characterize the quantum reading\ncapacity of a memory model, defined as the maximum rate of reliable reading. We\nshow that, like other quantities in quantum information theory, the quantum\nreading capacity is super-additive. Moreover, we determine conditions under\nwhich the use of an entangled ancilla improves the performance of quantum\nreading.\n", "  In this paper I give an overview of mathematical structures appearing in\nperturbative algebraic quantum field theory (pAQFT) in the case of the massless\nscalar field on Minkowski spacetime. I also show how these relate to\nKontsevich-Zagier periods. Next, I review the pAQFT version of the\nrenormalization group flow and reformulate it in terms of Feynman graphs. This\nallows me to relate Kontsevich-Zagier periods to numbers appearing in computing\nthe pAQFT $\\beta$-function.\n", "  The recent direct detection of gravitational waves reported by Advanced LIGO\nhas inspired the current article. In this context, a particular\nLorentz-violating framework for classical, massive particles is the focus. The\nlatter is characterized by a preferred direction in spacetime comprised of\nCPT-odd components with mass dimension 1. Curvature effects in spacetime, which\nare caused by a propagating gravitational wave, are assumed to deform the\notherwise constant background field. In accordance with spontaneous Lorentz\nviolation, a particular choice for the vector field is taken, which was\nproposed elsewhere. The geodesic equations for a particle that is subject to\nthis type of Lorentz violation are obtained. Subsequently, their numerical\nsolutions are computed and discussed. The particular model considered leads to\nchanges in the particle trajectory whose impact on interferometric\ngravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO will be studied.\n", "  This comment regards a central aspect of the referred-to paper, the issue of\nconvergence of the large coordination-number expansion. Perturbation expansions\nof expressions containing a large number of parameters are generally invalid\ndue to the non-analyticity of the expanded expressions. I refer to recent work\nwhere these issues are analyzed and discussed in detail in relation to a\nbenchmark example of a cluster model. As discussed therein, methods which are\nuncontrollable and for which their convergence is not foreseeable are not only\nuseless but can mislead, particularly if models derived from them are used to\ninterpret experiments.\n", "  The proton-rich nucleus $^{23}$Al has a ground state just 123 keV below the\nproton drip-line, and as a result comparatively little is known experimentally\nabout its properties, as with many such nuclei. Theoretical investigations have\ntended to model exclusively the ground and first one to three excited states\nknown. In this paper, we theoretically model most of the known spectrum, and\npredict what states may as yet be unobserved. We use the multichannel algebraic\nscattering (MCAS) method to describe states as resonances of a valence proton\ncoupled to a $^{22}$Mg rotor core. Six states with low-excitation energies and\ndefined $J^\\pi$ are matched, and we make the first prediction of the properties\nof four others and propound the possible existence of several more.\n", "  We consider the 1d Schr\\\"odinger operators with random decaying potentials\nwhere the spectrum is pure point(sub-critical case). We show that the point\nprocess composed of the rescaled eivenvalues, together with those zero points\nof the corresponding eigenfunctions, converges to the Poisson process.\n", "  Mapping a many-body state on a loop in parameter space is a simple way to\ncharacterize a quantum state. The connections of such a geometrical\nrepresentation to the concepts of Chern number and Majorana zero mode are\ninvestigated based on a generalized quantum spin system with short and\nlong-range interactions. We show that the topological invariants, the Chern\nnumbers of corresponding Bloch band is equivalent to the winding number in the\nauxiliary plane, which can be utilized to characterize the phase diagram. We\nintroduce the concept of Majorana charge, the magnitude of which is defined by\nthe distribution of Majorana fermion probability in zero-mode states, and the\nsign is defined by the type of Majorana fermion. By direct calculations of the\nMajorana modes we analytically and numerically verify that the Majorana charge\nis equal to Chern numbers and winding numbers.\n", "  We study quasiequilibrium solutions of triaxially deformed rotating compact\nstars -- a generalization of Jacobi ellipsoids under relativistic gravity and\ncompressible equations of state (EOS). For relatively stiff (piecewise)\npolytropic EOSs, we find supramassive triaxial solutions whose masses exceed\nthe maximum mass of the spherical solution, but are always lower than those of\naxisymmetric equilibriums. The difference in the maximum masses of triaxial and\naxisymmetric solutions depends sensitively on the EOS. If the difference turns\nout to be only about 10%, it will be strong evidence that the EOS of high\ndensity matter becomes substantially softer in the core of neutron stars. This\nfinding opens a novel way to probe phase transitions of high density nuclear\nmatter using detections of gravitational waves from new born neutron stars or\nmagnetars under fallback accretion.\n", "  One percent of redshift z~0.1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) show velocity\nsplitting of a few hundred km/s in the narrow emission lines in spatially\nintegrated spectra. Such line profiles have been found to arise from the bulk\nmotion of ionized gas clouds associated with galactic-scale outflows, merging\npairs of galaxies each harboring a supermassive black hole (SMBH), and/or\ngalactic-scale disk rotation. It remains unclear, however, how the frequency of\nnarrow-line velocity splitting may depend on AGN luminosity. Here we study the\ncorrelation between the fraction of Type 2 AGNs with double-peaked narrow\nemission lines and AGN luminosity as indicated by [O III]5007 emission-line\nluminosity L_[O III]. We combine the sample of Liu et al. (2010) at z~0.1 with\na new sample of 178 Type 2 AGNs with double-peaked [O III] emission lines at\nz~0.5. We select the new sample from a parent sample of 2089 Type 2 AGNs from\nthe SDSS-III/Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We find a statistically\nsignificant (~4.2\\sigma) correlation between L_[O III] and the fraction of\nobjects that exhibit double-peaked narrow emission lines among all Type 2 AGNs,\ncorrected for selection bias and incompleteness due to [O III] line width,\nequivalent width, splitting velocity, and/or equivalent width ratio between the\ntwo velocity components. Our result suggests that galactic-scale outflows\nand/or merging pairs of SMBHs are more prevalent in more powerful AGNs,\nalthough spatially resolved follow up observations are needed to resolve the\norigin(s) for the narrow-line velocity splitting for individual AGNs.\n", "  We present interferometric, full-polarization observations of the four\nground-state transitions of OH, toward five confirmed and one candidate\nOH-emitting planetary nebulae (OHPNe). OHPNe are believed to be very young PNe,\nand information on their magnetic fields (provided by their polarization) could\nbe key to understand the early evolution of PNe. We detect significant circular\nand linear polarization in four and two objects, respectively. Possible Zeeman\npairs are seen in JaSt 23 and IRAS 17393-2727, resulting in estimates of\nmagnetic field strengths between 0.8 and 24 mG. We also report the new\ndetection of OH emission at 1720 MHz toward Vy 2-2, making it the third known\nPN with this type of emission. We suggest that younger PNe have spectra\ndominated by narrow maser features and higher degrees of polarization.\nShock-excited emission at 1720 MHz seems to be more common in PNe than in early\nevolutionary phases, and could be related to equatorial ejections during the\nearly PN phase.\n", "  We investigate the classical Brownian motion of a particle in a\ntwo-dimensional noncommutative (NC) space. Using the standard NC algebra\nembodied by the sympletic Weyl-Moyal formalism we find that noncommutativity\ninduces a non-vanishing correlation between both coordinates at different\ntimes. The effect stands out as a signature of spatial noncommutativity and\nthus could offer a way to experimentally detect the phenomena. We further\ndiscuss some limiting scenarios and the trade-off between the scale imposed by\nthe NC structure and the parameters of the Brownian motion itself.\n", "  In this paper we consider the exclusive production of proton-antiproton pairs\nin the interaction between two quasireal photons in $e^+e^-$ collision. The\ndifferential and total cross section of the process $\\gamma \\gamma \\to p\\bar\n{p}$ at a beam energy of photons from 2.1 GeV to 4.5 GeV in the center-of-mass\nand for different values of $|cos\\theta^{\\ast}|$ is calculated. At energy\n$<\\sqrt {s_{e^+e^-}}>$=197 \\,\\,GeV the total cross section process o0f the $e^+\n+e^- \\to e^+ +e^- +p +\\bar {p}$ is calculated by the two-photon mechanism. The\nresults are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  We study coupled quantum systems as the working media of thermodynamic\nmachines. Under a suitable phase-space transformation, the coupled systems can\nbe expressed as a composition of independent subsystems. We find that for the\ncoupled systems, the figures of merit, that is the efficiency for engine and\nthe coefficient of performance for refrigerator, are bounded (both from above\nand from below) by the corresponding figures of merit of the independent\nsubsystems. We also show that the optimum work extractable from a coupled\nsystem is upper bounded by the optimum work obtained from the uncoupled system,\nthereby showing that the quantum correlations do not help in optimal work\nextraction. Further, we study two explicit examples, coupled spin-$1/2$ systems\nand coupled quantum oscillators with analogous interactions. Interestingly, for\nparticular kind of interactions, the efficiency of the coupled oscillators\noutperforms that of the coupled spin-$1/2$ systems when they work as heat\nengines. However, for the same interaction, the coefficient of performance\nbehaves in a reverse manner, while the systems work as the refrigerator. Thus\nthe same coupling can cause opposite effects in the figures of merit of heat\nengine and refrigerator.\n", "  Kerr nonlinearity based frequency combs and solitons have been generated from\non-chip optical microresonators with high quality factors and global or local\nanomalous dispersion. However, fabrication of such resonators usually requires\nmaterials and/or processes that are not standard in semiconductor manufacturing\nfacilities. Moreover, in certain frequency regimes such as visible and\nultra-violet, the large normal material dispersion makes it extremely difficult\nto achieve anomalous dispersion. Here we present a concentric racetrack-shaped\nresonator that achieves anomalous dispersion in a 300 nm thick silicon nitride\nfilm, suitable for semiconductor manufacturing but previously thought to result\nonly in waveguides with high normal dispersion, a high intrinsic Q of 1.5\nmillion, and a novel mode-selective coupling scheme that allows coherent combs\nto be generated. We also provide evidence suggestive of soliton-like pulse\nformation in the generated comb. Our method can achieve anomalous dispersion\nover moderately broad bandwidth for resonators at almost any wavelength while\nstill maintaining material and process compatibility with high-volume\nsemiconductor manufacturing.\n", "  We construct the first family of horizonless supergravity solutions that have\nthe same mass, charges and angular momenta as general supersymmetric rotating\nD1-D5-P black holes in five dimensions. This family includes solutions with\narbitrarily small angular momenta, deep within the regime of quantum numbers\nand couplings for which a large classical black hole exists. These geometries\nare well-approximated by the black-hole solution, and in particular exhibit the\nsame near-horizon throat. Deep in this throat, the black-hole singularity is\nresolved into a smooth cap. We also identify the holographically-dual states in\nthe N=(4,4) D1-D5 orbifold CFT. Our solutions are among the states counted by\nthe CFT elliptic genus, and provide examples of smooth microstate geometries\nwithin the ensemble of supersymmetric black-hole microstates.\n", "  The recent discovery of semiconducting two-dimensional materials has led to\nthe prediction of a revolution in the field of optoelectronics, driven by the\nintroduction of a series of new components that are just a few atoms thick. Key\nremaining challenges for producing practical devices from these materials lie\nin improving the coupling of light into and out of single atomic layers, and in\nmaking these layers robust to the influence of their surrounding environment.\nWe present a solution to tackle both of these problems simultaneously, by\ndeterministically placing a micro-lens directly onto the surface of these\nmaterials. These lenses are dynamically tuned to increase the coupling of\nlight, whilst controlling chromatic aberration, before being set in place with\nUV light. We show that this approach enhances photoluminescence of tungsten\ndiselenide (WSe2) monolayers by up to 300%, and nearly doubles the imaging\nresolution of the system. Furthermore, this solution fully encapsulates the\nmonolayer, preventing it from physical damage and degradation in air. The\noptical solution we have developed could become a key enabling technology for\nthe mass production of ultra-thin optical devices, such as quantum light\nemitting diodes.\n", "  We consider a tight binding model for localised crystalline defects with\nelectrons in the canonical ensemble (finite electronic temperature) and nuclei\npositions relaxed according to the Born--Oppenheimer approximation. We prove\nthat the limit model as the computational domain size grows to infinity is\nformulated in the grand-canonical ensemble for the electrons. The Fermi-level\nfor the limit model is fixed at a homogeneous crystal level, independent of the\ndefect or electron number in the sequence of finite-domain approximations. We\nquantify the rates of convergence for the nuclei configuration and for the\nFermi-level.\n", "  Polarized scattering in planetary atmospheres is computed in the context of\nexoplanets. The problem of polarized radiative transfer is solved for a general\ncase of absorption and scattering, while Rayleigh and Mie polarized scattering\nare considered as most relevant examples. We show that (1) relative\ncontributions of single and multiple scattering depend on the stellar\nirradiation and opacities in the planetary atmosphere; (2) cloud (particle)\nphysical parameters can be deduced from the wavelength-dependent measurements\nof the continuum polarization and from a differential analysis of molecular\nband absorption; (3) polarized scattering in molecular bands increases the\nreliability of their detections in exoplanets; (4) photosynthetic life can be\ndetected on other planets in visible polarized spectra with high sensitivity.\nThese examples demonstrate the power of spectropolarimetry for exoplanetary\nresearch and for searching for life in the universe.\n", "  Wavefront shaping is a powerful technique that can be used to focus light\nthrough scattering media, which can be important for imaging through scattering\nsamples such as tissue. The method is based on the assumption that the field at\nthe output of the medium is a linear superposition of the modes traveling\nthrough different paths in the medium. However, when the scattering medium also\nexhibits nonlinearity, as may occur in multiphoton microscopy, this assumption\nis violated and the applicability of wavefront shaping becomes unclear. Here we\nshow, using a simple model system with a scattering layer followed by a\nnonlinear layer, that with adaptive optimization of the wavefront light can\nstill be controlled and focused through a scattering medium in the presence of\nnonlinearity. Notably, we find that moderate positive nonlinearity can serve to\nsignificantly increase the focused fraction of power, whereas negative\nnonlinearity reduces it.\n", "  The Hodge tau-function is a generating function for the linear Hodge\nintegrals. It is also a tau-function of the KP hierarchy. In this paper, we\nfirst present the Virasoro constraints for the Hodge tau-function in the\nexplicit form of the Virasoro equations. The expression of our Virasoro\nconstraints is simply a linear combination of the Virasoro operators, where the\ncoefficients are restored from a power series for the Lambert W function. Then,\nusing this result, we deduce a simple version of the Virasoro constraints for\nthe linear Hodge partition function, where the coefficients are restored from\nthe Gamma function. Finally, we establish the equivalence relation between the\nVirasoro constraints and polynomial recursion formula for the linear Hodge\nintegrals.\n", "  In this work, we use Molecular Dynamics and Lattice-Boltzmann simulations to\nstudy the properties of charged Janus particles in an electric field. We show\nthat for relatively small net charge and thick electrostatic diffuse layer\nmobilities of Janus particles and uniformly charged colloids of the same net\ncharge are identical. However, for higher charges and thinner diffuse layers\nJanus particles always show lower electrophoretic mobility. We also demonstrate\nthat Janus particles align with the electric field and the angular deviation\nfrom the field's direction are related to their dipole moment. We show that the\nlatter is affected by the thickness of the electrostatic diffuse layer and\nstrongly correlates with the electrophoretic mobility.\n", "  We study the higher-spin gauge theory in six-dimensional anti-de Sitter space\n$AdS_6$ that is based on the exceptional Lie superalgebra $F(4)$. The relevant\nhigher-spin algebra was constructed in arXiv:1409.2185 [hep-th]. We determine\nthe spectrum of the theory and show that it contains the physical fields of the\nRomans $F(4)$ gauged supergravity. The full spectrum consists of an infinite\ntower of unitary supermultiplets of $F(4)$ which extend the Romans multiplet to\nhigher spins plus a single short supermultiplet.\n  Motivated by applications to this novel supersymmetric higher-spin theory as\nwell as to other theories, we extend the known one-loop tests of $AdS/CFT$\nduality in various directions. The spectral zeta-function is derived for the\nmost general case of fermionic and mixed-symmetry fields, which allows one to\ntest the Type-A and B theories and supersymmetric extensions thereof in any\ndimension. We also study higher-spin doubletons and partially-massless fields.\nWhile most of the tests are successfully passed, the Type-B theory in all even\ndimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes presents an interesting puzzle: the free\nenergy as computed from the bulk is not equal to that of the free fermion on\nthe CFT side, though there is some systematics to the discrepancy.\n", "  Study of the Weyl and Dirac topological materials (topological semimetals,\ninsulators, superfluids and superconductors) opens the route for the\ninvestigation of the topological quantum vacua of relativistic fields. The\nsymmetric phase of the Standard Model (SM), where both electroweak and chiral\nsymmetry are not broken, represents the topological semimetal. The vacua of the\nSM (and its extensions) in the phases with broken Electroweak symmetry\nrepresent the topological insulators of different types. We discuss in details\nthe topological invariants in both symmetric and broken phases and establish\ntheir relation to the stability of vacuum.\n", "  We take into consideration the evolution of particle size in a monodisperse\naerosol population during activation and deactivation of cloud condensation\nnuclei (CCN). The phase portrait of the system derived through a\nweakly-nonlinear analysis reveals a saddle-node bifurcation and a cusp\ncatastrophe. An analytical estimate of the activation timescale is derived\nthrough estimation of the time spent in the saddle-node bifurcation bottleneck.\nNumerical integration of the system portrays two types of\nactivation/deactivation hystereses: one associated with the kinetic limitations\non droplet growth when the system is far from equilibrium, and one occurring\nclose to equilibrium and associated with the cusp catastrophe. The hysteretic\nbehaviour close to equilibrium imposes stringent time-resolution constraints on\nnumerical integration, particularly during deactivation.\n", "  Machine learning offers an unprecedented perspective for the problem of\nclassifying phases in condensed matter physics. We employ neural-network\nmachine learning techniques to distinguish finite-temperature phases of the\nstrongly correlated fermions on cubic lattices. We show that a three\ndimensional convolutional network trained on auxiliary field configurations\nproduced by quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model can correctly\npredict the magnetic phase diagram of the model at the average density of one\n(half filling). We then use the network, trained at half filling, to explore\nthe trend in the transition temperature as the system is doped away from half\nfilling. This transfer learning approach predicts that the instability to the\nmagnetic phase extends to at least 5% doping in this region. Our results pave\nthe way for other machine learning applications in correlated quantum many-body\nsystems.\n", "  The Pfaffian structure of the boundary monomer correlation functions in the\ndimer-covering planar graph models is rederived through a combinatorial /\ntopological argument. These functions are then extended into a larger family of\norder-disorder correlation functions which are shown to exhibit Pfaffian\nstructure throughout the bulk. Key tools involve combinatorial switching\nsymmetries which are identified through the loop-gas representation of the\ndouble dimer model, and topological implications of planarity.\n", "  We study entanglement entropy in gravity theory with quantum effects. A\nsimplest model is a two dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action . We use an\n$n$-sheet manifold to obtain an area term of entanglement entropy by summing\nover all background fields. A strongly coupled conformal field theory is\nexpected to describe perturbative quantum gravity theory. Thus, we also use two\ndimensional conformal field theory to discuss a factorization of a Hilbert\nspace. We find that a coefficient of a universal term of the entanglement\nentropy is independent of a choice of an entangling surface in two dimensional\nconformal field theory for one interval and also argue the result possibly be\nextended to multiple intervals. Finally, we discuss that translational\ninvariance possibly be a necessary condition in a quantum gravity theory by\nruing out a volume law of entanglement entropy.\n", "  A coupled spin-electron diamond chain with localized Ising spins placed on\nits nodal sites and mobile electrons delocalized over interstitial sites is\nexplored in a magnetic field taking into account the difference between Land\\'e\ng-factors of the localized spins and mobile electrons. The ground-state phase\ndiagram is constituted by two classical ferrimagnetic phases, the quantum\nunsaturated paramagnetic phase and the saturated paramagnetic phase. Both\nclassical ferrimagnetic phases as well as the unsaturated paramagnetic phase\nare reflected in a low-temperature magnetization curve as intermediate\nmagnetization plateaus. The unsaturated paramagnetic phase is quantum in its\ncharacter as evidenced by the fermionic concurrence calculated for a pair of\nthe mobile electrons hopping in between the interstitial sites. It is shown\nthat the magnetic field can under certain conditions induce a quantum\nentanglement above the disentangled ground state.\n", "  We show that the problem of ghosts in critical gravity and its higher\ndimensional extensions can be resolved by giving dynamics to the symmetric rank\ntwo auxiliary field existing in the action of these theories. These New\nBi-Gravities, at linear level around the AdS vacuum, are free of Boulware-Deser\nghost, kinetic ghost and tachyonic instability within the particular range of\nparameters. Moreover, we show that the energy and entropy of AdS-Schwarzschild\nblack hole solutions of these new models are positive in the same range of\nparameters. This may be the sign that these new models are also free of ghost\ninstabilities at the non-linear level.\n", "  In this paper we research all possible finite-dimensional representations and\ncorresponding values of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter contained in EPRL\nsimplicity constraints by using Naimark's fundamental theorem of the Lorentz\ngroup representation theory. It turns out that for each non-zero pure imaginary\nwith rational modulus value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\\gamma = i\n\\frac{p}{q}, p, q \\in Z, p, q \\ne 0$, there is a solution of the simplicity\nconstraints, such that the corresponding Lorentz representation is finite\ndimensional. The converse is also true - for each finite-dimensional Lorentz\nrepresentation solution of the simplicity constraints $(n, \\rho)$, the\nassociated Barbero-Immirzi parameter is non-zero pure imaginary with rational\nmodulus, $\\gamma = i \\frac{p}{q}, p, q \\in Z, p, q \\ne 0$. We solve the\nsimplicity constraints with respect to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and then\nuse Naimark's fundamental theorem of the Lorentz group representations to find\nall finite-dimensional representations contained in the solutions.\n", "  In present paper a spherically symmetric stellar configuration has been\nanalyzed by assuming the matter distribution of the stellar configuration is\nanisotropic in nature and compared with the realistic objects, namely, the low\nmass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and X-ray pulsars. The analytic solution has been\nobtained by utilizing the dark energy equation of state for the interior\nsolution corresponding to the Schwarzschild exterior vacuum solution at the\njunction interface. Several physical properties like energy conditions,\nstability, mass-radius ratio, and surface redshift are described through\nmathematical calculations as well as graphical plots. It is found that obtained\nmass-radius ration of the compact stars candidates like 4U 1820-30, PSR J\n1614-2230, Vela X-1 and Cen X-3 are very much consistent with the observed data\nby Gangopadhyay et al. (Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 431, 3216 (2013)). So our\nproposed model would be useful in the investigation of the possible clustering\nof dark energy.\n", "  In this paper we investigate whether the periodic structures on metal\nsurfaces exposed to single ultrashort laser pulses can appear due to an\ninstability induced by two-temperature heating dynamics. The results of\ntwo-temperature model (TTM) 2D simulations are presented on the irradiation of\ngold by a single 800 nm femtosecond laser pulse whose intensity is modulated in\norder to reproduce a small initial temperature perturbation, which can arise\nfrom incoming and scattered surface wave interference. The growing (unstable)\nmodes of the temperature distribution along the surface may be responsible for\nthe LIPSS (Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures) formation. After the end\nof the laser pulse and before the complete coupling between lattice and\nelectrons occurs, the evolution of the amplitude of the subsequent modulation\nin the lattice temperature reveals different tendencies depending on the\nspatial period of the initial modulation. This instability-like behaviour is\nshown to arise due to the perturbation of the electronic temperature which\nrelaxes slower for bigger spatial periods and thus imparts more significant\nmodulations to the lattice temperature. Small spatial periods of the order of\n100 nm and smaller experience stabilization and fast decay from the more\nefficient lateral heat diffusion which facilitates the relaxation of the\nelectronic temperature amplitude due to in-depth diffusion. An analytical\ninstability analysis of a simplified version of the TTM set of equations\nsupports the lattice temperature modulation behaviour obtained in the\nsimulations and reveals that in-depth diffusion length is a determining\nparameter in the dispersion relation of unstable modes. Finally it is discussed\nhow the change in optical properties can intensify the modulation-related\neffects.\n", "  Mathematical physicists have studied degenerations of Lie groups and their\nrepresentations, which they call contractions. In this paper we study these\ncontractions, and also other families, within the framework of algebraic\nfamilies of Harish-Chandra modules. We construct a family that incorporates\nboth a real reductive group and its compact form, separate parts of which have\nbeen studied individually as contractions. We give a complete classification of\ngenerically irreducible families of Harish-Chandra modules in the case of the\nfamily associated to SL(2, R).\n", "  Topological superconductors can host Majorana quasiparticles which supersede\nthe fermion/boson dichotomy and offer a pathway to fault tolerant quantum\ncomputation. In one-dimensional systems zero-energy Majorana states are bound\nto the ends of the topologically superconducting regions. An experimental\nsignature of a Majorana bound state is a conductance peak at zero source-drain\nvoltage bias in a tunneling experiment. Here, we identify the bulk topological\nphase in a semiconductor nanowire coupled to a conventional superconductor. We\nmap out its phase diagram through the dependence of zero-bias peak on the\nchemical potential and magnetic field. Our findings are consistent with\ncalculations for a finite-length topological nanowire. Knowledge of the phase\ndiagram makes it possible to predictably tune nanowire segments in and out of\nthe topological phase, thus controlling the positions and couplings of multiple\nMajorana bound states. This ability is a prerequisite for Majorana braiding, an\nexperiment in which Majorana quantum states are exchanged in order to both\ndemonstrate their non-abelian character and realize topological quantum bits.\n", "  We study differential cross sections for the production of three and four\njets in multi-Regge kinematics, the main interest lying on azimuthal angle\ndependences. The theoretical setup is the jet production from a single BFKL\nladder with a convolution of two/three BFKL Green functions, where two\nforward/backward jets are always tagged in the final state. Furthermore, we\nrequire the tagging of one/two further jets in more central regions of the\ndetectors with a relative separation in rapidity. We found, as result, that the\ndependence on transverse momenta and rapidities of the central jets can be\nconsidered as a distinct signal of the onset of BFKL dynamics.\n", "  Gravitational non-linear evolution induces a shift in the position of the\nbaryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) peak together with a damping and broadening\nof its shape that bias and degrades the accuracy with which the position of the\npeak can be determined. BAO reconstruction is a technique developed to undo\npart of the effect of non-linearities. We present and analyse a reconstruction\nmethod that consists of displacing pixels instead of galaxies and whose\nimplementation is easier than the standard reconstruction method. We show that\nthis method is equivalent to the standard reconstruction technique in the limit\nwhere the number of pixels becomes very large. This method is particularly\nuseful in surveys where individual galaxies are not resolved, as in 21cm\nintensity mapping observations. We validate this method by reconstructing mock\npixelated maps, that we build from the distribution of matter and halos in\nreal- and redshift-space, from a large set of numerical simulations. We find\nthat this method is able to decrease the uncertainty in the BAO peak position\nby 30-50% over the typical angular resolution scales of 21 cm intensity mapping\nexperiments.\n", "  We introduce an abstract concept of quantum field theory on categories\nfibered in groupoids over the category of spacetimes. This provides us with a\ngeneral and flexible framework to study quantum field theories defined on\nspacetimes with extra geometric structures such as bundles, connections and\nspin structures. Using right Kan extensions, we can assign to any such theory\nan ordinary quantum field theory defined on the category of spacetimes and we\nshall clarify under which conditions it satisfies the axioms of locally\ncovariant quantum field theory. The same constructions can be performed in a\nhomotopy theoretic framework by using homotopy right Kan extensions, which\nallows us to obtain first toy-models of homotopical quantum field theories\nresembling some aspects of gauge theories.\n", "  A microscopic time-reversal invariant cranking model (MCRM) for nuclear\ncollective rotation about a single axis and its coupling to intrinsic motion is\nderived. The MCRM is derived by transforming the stationary nuclear Schrodinger\nequation using a collective rotation-intrinsic product wavefunction, imposing\nno constraints on the wavefunction and the nucleon coordinates, and using no\nrelative co-ordinates. The derivatives of the collective-rotation angle are\ndefined in terms of a combination of rigid and irrotational collective flows of\nthe nucleons. The collective wavefunction is chosen to be an eigenstate of the\nangular momentum, yielding a MCRM Schrodinger equation for the intrinsic\nwavefunction that contains a cranking Coriolis energy term that is linear in\nthe angular momentum and shear operators, a collective centrifugal energy term,\nand a rotation-fluctuation energy term. In absence of the irrotational-flow\ncomponent and fluctuation energy term, the MCRM equation reduces to that of the\nconventional cranking model (CCRM), but with a dynamic rigid-flow angular\nvelocity and rigid-flow centrifugal-energy term. The expectation of the angular\nmomentum operator, which is the sum of the collective rotation angular momentum\nand the expectation of the angular momentum in the intrinsic state, would\nreduce to that in the CCRM if the collective rotation angular momentum were\nsmall. However, it is shown that, even for the simple case of the anisotropic\nharmonic oscillator mean-field potential in , the collective rotation angular\nmomentum is not small in the current version of the MCRM, and that this problem\nneeds further study. It is also shown that the MCRM Schrodinger equation is\nreducible to the equations of the particle-plus-rotor, phenomenological and\nmicroscopic collective rotation-vibration, and two-fluid semi-classical\ncollective models.\n", "  Quantum mechanics is a successful theory that describes the behavior of\nphotons, electrons, and other atomic- and molecular-scale objects. However, it\nis far from being well understood. In this paper, a new theory - knot physics\nfor entangled vortex-membranes is developed to explore the underline physics of\nquantum mechanics. From point view of information, three dimensional quantum\nDirac model is developed to effectively describe the fluctuations of local\ndeformation of vortex-membranes: The elementary excitations are knots with\ninformation unit; The physics quality to describe local deformation is knot\ndensity that is defined by the density of zeros between two projected\nvortex-membranes; The Biot-Savart equation for Kelvin waves becomes Schrodinger\nequation for probability waves of knots; the classical functions for\nperturbative Kelvin waves become wave functions for knots; The probability of\nquantum mechanics comes from dynamic projection for inner observers owing to\n\"fast clock\" effect; The angular frequency for leapfrogging motion plays the\nrole of the mass of knots; etc. This work would help people to understand the\nmystery of quantum mechanics.\n", "  Formation time of heavy quarkonia in a homogeneous magnetic field is analyzed\nby using a phenomenological ansatz of the vector current correlator. Because\nthe existence of a magnetic field mixes vector quarkonia ($J/\\psi$,\n$\\psi^\\prime$) and their pseudoscalar partners ($\\eta_c$, $\\eta_c^\\prime$), the\nproperties of the quarkonia can be modified through such a spin mixing. This\nmeans that the formation time of quarkonia is also changed by the magnetic\nfield. We show the formation time of vector quarkonia is delayed by an\nidealized constant magnetic field, where the formation time of the excited\nstate becomes longer than that of the ground state. As a more realistic\nsituation in heavy-ion collisions, effects by a time-dependent magnetic field\nare also discussed, where delayed formation of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi^\\prime$ and\nvery early formation of $\\eta_c$ and $\\eta_c^\\prime$ are found.\n", "  We explore the use of galaxy bispectra with multitracer technique as a\npossible probe of primordial non-Gaussianities. We forecast future constraints\non non-linearity parameters, $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm eq}$ and $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm orth}$,\nwhich respectively characterize the equilateral- and orthogonal-types\nprimordial bispectra, and show that the multitracer analysis would be effective\nwith reducing the cosmic-variance noise if the number density of galaxies is\nhigh enough. We find that the measurement of galaxy bispectrum by future galaxy\nsurveys can reach the constraints on the non-local type primordial\nnon-Gaussianities to the level severer than current one which has been obtained\nby cosmic microwave background observations.\n", "  Motivated by the remarkable discovery of superconductivity in elemental\nBismuth, we study its normal state in detail using a combination of\ntight-binding (TB) and-structural supplemented by dynamical mean-field theory\n(DMFT). We show that a two-fluid model composed of preformed and dynamically\nfluctuating excitons coupled to a tiny number of carriers provides a unified\nrationalization of a range of ill-understood normal state spectral and\ntransport data. Based on these, we propose that resonant scattering involving a\nvery low density of renormalized carriers and the excitonic liquid drives\nlogarithmic enhancement of vertex corrections, boosting superconductivity in\n$Bi$. A confirmatory test for our proposal would be the experimental\nverification of an excitonic semiconductor with electronic nematicity as a\n`competing order' on inducing a semi-metal-to semiconductor transition in $Bi$\nby an external perturbation like pressure.\n", "  In many macroscopic dynamic wetting problems, it is assumed that the\nmacroscopic interface is quasistatic, and the dissipation appears only in the\nregion close to the contact line. When approaching the moving contact line, a\nmicroscopic mechanism is required to regularize the singularity of viscous\ndissipation. On the other hand, if the characteristic size of a fluidic system\nis reduced to a range comparable to the microscopic regularization length\nscale, the assumption that viscous effects are localized near the contact line\nis no longer justified. In the present work, such microscopic length is the\nslip length. We investigate the dewetting of a droplet using the boundary\nelement method. Specifically, we solve for the axisymmetric Stokes flow with i)\nthe Navier-slip boundary condition at the solid/liquid boundary, and ii) a\ntime-independent microscopic contact angle at the contact line. The profile\nevolution is computed for different slip lengths and equilibrium contact\nangles. When decreasing the slip length, the typical nonsphericity first\nincreases, reaches a maximum at a characteristic slip length $\\tilde{b}_m$, and\nthen decreases. Regarding different equilibrium contact angles, two universal\nrescalings are proposed to describe the behavior for slip lengths larger or\nsmaller than $\\tilde{b}_m$. Around $\\tilde{b}_m$, the early time evolution of\nthe profiles at the rim can be described by similarity solutions. The results\nare explained in terms of the structure of the flow field governed by different\ndissipation channels: viscous elongational flows for large slip lengths,\nfriction at the substrate for intermediate slip lengths, and viscous shear\nflows for small slip lengths. Following the transitions between these dominant\ndissipation mechanisms, our study indicates a crossover to the quasistatic\nregime when the slip length is small compared to the droplet size.\n", "  We present QSFit, a new software package to automatically perform the\nanalysis of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) optical spectra. The software provides\nluminosity estimates for the AGN continuum, the Balmer continuum, both optical\nand UV iron blended complex, host galaxy and emission lines, as well as width,\nvelocity offset and equivalent width of 20 emission lines. Improving on a\nnumber of previous studies on AGN spectral analysis, QSFit fits all the\ncomponents simultaneously, using an AGN continuum model which extends over the\nentire available spectrum, and is thus a probe of the actual AGN continuum\nwhose estimates are scarcely influenced by localized features (e.g. emission\nlines) in the spectrum. We used QSFit to analyze 71,251 optical spectra of Type\n1 AGN at z < 2 (obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS) and to produce\na publicly available catalog of AGN spectral properties. Such catalog allowed\nus (for the first time) to estimate the AGN continuum slope and the Balmer\ncontinuum luminosity on a very large sample, and to show that there is no\nevident correlation between these quantities the redshift. All data in the\ncatalog, the plots with best fitting model and residuals, and the IDL code we\nused to perform the analysis, are available on a dedicated website. The whole\nfitting process is customizable for specific needs, and can be extended to\nanalyze spectra from other data sources. The ultimate purpose of QSFit is to\nallow astronomers to run standardized recipes to analyze the AGN data, in a\nsimple, replicable and shareable way.\n", "  In the real world application of railguns, the launch efficiency is one of\nthe most important parameters. This efficiency directly relates to the capacity\nof the electrical energy storage that is needed for the launch. In this study,\nthe rail/armature contact behavior for two different armature technologies was\ncompared. To this end, experiments using aluminum c-shaped armature and copper\nbrush armature type projectiles were performed under same initial conditions.\nThe c-shaped armature type showed a superior behavior with respect to\nelectrical contact to the rails and in acceleration. A 300 g projectile with a\nc-shaped armature reached a velocity of 3100 m/s and an overall launch\nefficiency including the power supply of 41%. This is to be compared to 2500\nm/s and 23% for the launching of a projectile using a brush armature.\n", "  Railguns are capable to far exceed the muzzle energies of current naval deck\nguns. Therefore one of the most promising scenario for the future application\nof railguns in naval warfare is the long range artillery. Hypervelocity\nprojectiles being propelled to velocities above 2 km/s reach targets at\ndistances of 200 km or more. At the French-German Research Institute the\nPEGASUS launcher is used for investigations with respect to this scenario. The\n6 m long barrel has a square caliber of 40 mm. The power supply unit is able to\ndeliver 10 MJ to the gun. Within this investigation, a complete launch package\nis being developed and experiments are performed that aim at showing that this\npackage can be accelerated to velocities ranging from 2000 m/s to 2500 m/s. A\nlaunch package consists out of an armature, a sabot and the projectile. The\narmature ensures the electrical contact during launch and pushes the sabot with\nits payload through the barrel. The sabot guides and protects the payload\nduring the acceleration. At the same time the accelerating forces generated at\nthe armature needs to be transferred to the projectile. After the launch\npackage has left the barrel, the sabot should open and release its payload, the\nprojectile into free-flight. Here the current status of the launch package\ndevelopment and results from experiments with the PEGASUS railgun are\npresented.\n", "  We study the effective interactions of external electromagnetic fields\ninduced by fluctuations of virtual particles in the vacuum of quantum\nelectrodynamics. Our main focus is on these interactions at two-loop order. We\ndiscuss in detail the emergence of the renowned Heisenberg-Euler effective\naction from the underlying microscopic theory of quantum electrodynamics,\nemphasizing its distinction from a standard one-particle irreducible effective\naction. In our explicit calculations we limit ourselves to constant and slowly\nvarying external fields, allowing us to adopt a locally constant field\napproximation. One of our main findings is that at two-loop order there is a\nfinite one-particle reducible contribution to the Heisenberg-Euler effective\naction in constant fields, which was previously assumed to vanish. In addition\nto their conceptual significance, our results are relevant for high-precision\nprobes of quantum vacuum nonlinearity in strong electromagnetic fields.\n", "  In this work the influence of the chiral anomaly effect on the evolution of\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence was studied. We argue that in the early\nuniverse, before the electroweak symmetry breaking, and for temperatures high\nenough such that the electron mass can be ignored, the description of a charged\nplasma in general needs to take into account the interplay between turbulence\nand the anomaly effects. It was demonstrated that this generalization can have\nimportant consequences on the evolution of turbulence, leading to the creation\nof maximally-helical fields from initially non-helical ones. Therefore, chiral\neffects can strongly support turbulent inverse cascade, and lead to a slower\ndecrease of the magnetic field with time, and also to a faster growth of the\ncorrelation length, when compared to the evolution predicted by the standard\nmagnetohydrodynamical description. Using the weak anomaly approximation, and\ntreating the anomaly contributions to magnetic energy and helicity as a small\nperturbation, we derive the specific solutions for the inverse cascade regime\nthat demonstrate how chiral effects support the inverse cascade.\n", "  We report on a heterogeneous active region design for terahertz quantum\ncascade laser based frequency combs. Dynamic range, spectral bandwidth as well\nas output power have been significantly improved with respect to previous\ndesigns. When operating individually the lasers act as a frequency comb up to a\nspectral bandwidth of 1.1 THz, while in a dispersed regime a bandwidth up to\n1.94 THz at a center frequency of 3 THz can be reached. A self-detected\ndual-comb setup has been used to verify the frequency comb nature of the\nlasers.\n", "  A promising strategy for better understanding space and time at the Planck\nscale, is outlined and further pursued. It is explained in detail, how black\nhole unitarity demands the existence of transformations that can remove\nfirewalls. This must then be combined with a continuity condition on the\nhorizon, with antipodal identification as an inevitable consequence. The\nantipodal identification comes with a CPT inversion. We claim to have arrived\nat 'new physics', but rather than string theory, our 'new physics' concerns new\nconstraints on the topology and the boundary conditions of general coordinate\ntransformations. The resulting theory is conceptually quite non trivial, and\nmore analysis is needed. A strong entanglement between Hawking particles at\nopposite sides of the black hole is suspected, but questions remain. A few\nmisconceptions concerning black holes, originating from older investigations,\nare discussed.\n", "  We examine environmental decoherence of cosmological perturbations in order\nto study the quantum-to-classical transition and the impact of noise on\nentanglement during inflation. Given an explicit interaction between the system\nand environment, we derive a quantum master equation for the reduced density\nmatrix of perturbations, drawing parallels with quantum Brownian motion, where\nwe see the emergence of fluctuation and dissipation terms. Although the master\nequation is not in Lindblad form, we see how typical solutions exhibit\npositivity on super-horizon scales, leading to a physically meaningful density\nmatrix. This allows us to write down a Langevin equation with stochastic noise\nfor the classical trajectories which emerge from the quantum system on\nsuper-horizon scales. In particular, we find that environmental decoherence\nincreases in strength as modes exit the horizon, with the growth driven\nessentially by white noise coming from local contribution to environmental\ncorrelations. Finally, we use our master equation to quantify the strength of\nquantum correlations as captured by discord. We show that environmental\ninteractions have a tendency to decrease the size of the discord and that these\neffects are determined by the relative strength of the expansion rate and\ninteraction rate of the environment. We interpret this in terms of the\ncompeting effects of particle creation versus environmental fluctuations, which\ntend to increase and decrease the discord respectively.\n", "  One of the most interesting predictions resulting from quantum physics, is\nthe violation of classical symmetries, collectively referred to as anomalies. A\nremarkable class of anomalies occurs when the continuous scale symmetry of a\nscale free quantum system is broken into a discrete scale symmetry for a\ncritical value of a control parameter. This is an example of a (zero\ntemperature) quantum phase transition. Such an anomaly takes place for the\nquantum inverse square potential known to describe 'Efimov physics'. Broken\ncontinuous scale symmetry into discrete scale symmetry also appears for a\ncharged and massless Dirac fermion in an attractive $1/r$ Coulomb potential.\nThe purpose of this article is to demonstrate the universality of this quantum\nphase transition and to present convincing experimental evidence of its\nexistence for a charged and massless fermion in an attractive Coulomb potential\nas realised in graphene.\n", "  The self-propulsion mechanism of active colloidal particles often generates\nnot only translational but also rotational motion. For particles with an\nanisotropic mass density under gravity, the motion is usually influenced by a\ndownwards oriented force and an aligning torque. Here we study the trajectories\nof self-propelled bottom-heavy Janus particles in three spatial dimensions both\nin experiments and by theory. For a sufficiently large mass anisotropy, the\nparticles typically move along helical trajectories whose axis is oriented\neither parallel or antiparallel to the direction of gravity (i.e., they show\ngravitaxis). In contrast, if the mass anisotropy is small and rotational\ndiffusion is dominant, gravitational alignment of the trajectories is not\npossible. Furthermore, the trajectories depend on the angular self-propulsion\nvelocity of the particles. If this component of the active motion is strong and\nrotates the direction of translational self-propulsion of the particles, their\ntrajectories have many loops, whereas elongated swimming paths occur if the\nangular self-propulsion is weak. We show that the observed gravitational\nalignment mechanism and the dependence of the trajectory shape on the angular\nself-propulsion can be used to separate active colloidal particles with respect\nto their mass anisotropy and angular self-propulsion, respectively.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the study of the Reissner-Nordstr{\\o}m-de Sitter\nblack holes and their maximal analytic extensions. In particular, we study some\nof their properties that lays the groundwork for separate papers where we\nobtain decay results and construct conformal scattering theories for test\nfields on such spacetimes. Here, we find the necessary and sufficient\nconditions on the parameters of the Reissner-Nordstr{\\o}m-de Sitter metric\n-namely, the mass, the charge, and the cosmological constant- to have three\nhorizons. Under this conditions, we prove that there is only one photon sphere\nand we locate it. We then give a detailed construction of the maximal analytic\nextension of the Reissner-Nordstr{\\o}m-de Sitter manifold in the case of three\nhorizons.\n", "  We report the experimental demonstration of a class of ultrasonic\nmetasurfaces made of patterned silicon thin wafers partially covered by Si3N4\nfilm that exhibit over 24 dB of sound transmission loss around 0.7 MHz, which\nis caused by the cancelation of sound waves emitted by the resonant Si3N4\nmembrane and the ones through the silicon backbone in each unit cell. These\nmetasurfaces are expected to have high reflection with little total loss even\nat ultrasonic frequency. They could be good candidates as the building blocks\nfor low-loss cavities, phase zone plates, and other underwater acoustic\nmetamaterials. As the working principle is scalable, it provides guidance for\nthe designs of audible underwater sound barriers as well.\n", "  Strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can result in ground states with non-trivial\ntopological properties. The situation is even richer in magnetic systems where\nthe magnetic ordering can potentially have strong influence over the electronic\nband structure. The class of AMnBi$_2$ (A = Sr, Ca) compounds are important in\nthis context as they are known to host massive Dirac fermions with strongly\nanisotropic dispersion that is believed to be due to the interplay between\nstrong SOC and magnetic degrees of freedom. We report the optical conductivity\nof YbMnBi$_2$, a newly discovered member of this family and a proposed Weyl\nsemi-metal (WSM) candidate with broken time reversal symmetry. Together with\ndensity functional theory (DFT) band structure calculations, we show how the\ncomplete conductivity can be interpreted as the sum of a intra-band Drude\nresponse and inter-band transitions. We argue that the canting of the magnetic\nmoments that has been proposed to be essential for the realization of the WSM\nin an otherwise antiferromagnetically ordered system is not necessary to\nexplain the optical conductivity. We believe our data is explained\nqualitatively by the uncanted magnetic structure with a small offset of the\nchemical potential from strict stochiometry. There is no definite evidence of\nbulk Weyl nodes, instead we see signatures of a gapped Dirac dispersion, common\nin other members of AMnBi$_2$ family or compounds with similar 2D network of Bi\natoms.\n", "  In this paper, we analyzed inflation from k-essence in the framework of\nHorndeski gravity. In the specific, we considered models of canonical scalar\nfield and k-essence with quadratic kinetic term. Viable inflationary models can\nbe reconstructed by starting from the cosmological data. Several possibilities\nare explored in order to correctly reproduce the spectral index and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial cosmological perturbations.\n", "  The Sagdeev-Zaslavski (SZ) equation for wave turbulence is analytically\nderived, both in terms of generating function and of multi-point pdf, for\nweakly interacting waves with initial random phases. When also initial\namplitudes are random, the one-point pdf equation is derived. Such analytical\ncalculations remarkably agree with results obtained in totally different\nfashions. Numerical investigations of the two-dimensional nonlinear\nSchroedinger equation (NLSE) and of a vibrating plate prove that: (i) generic\nHamiltonian 4-wave systems rapidly attain a random distribution of phases\nindependently of the slower dynamics of the amplitudes, vindicating the\nhypothesis of initially random phases; (ii) relaxation of the Fourier\namplitudes to the predicted stationary distribution (exponential) happens on a\nfaster timescale than relaxation of the spectrum (Rayleigh-Jeans distribution);\n(iii) the pdf equation correctly describes dynamics under different forcings:\nthe NLSE has an exponential pdf corresponding to a quasi-gaussian solution,\nlike the vibrating plates, that also show some intermittency at very strong\nforcings.\n", "  The physical mechanisms of the laser-induced periodic surface structures\n(LIPSS) formation are studied in this paper for single-pulse irradiation\nregimes. The change in the LIPSS period with wavelength of incident laser\nradiation is investigated experimentally, using a picosecond laser system,\nwhich provides 7-ps pulses in near-IR, visible, and UV spectral ranges. The\nexperimental results are compared with predictions made under the assumption\nthat the surface-scattered waves are involved in the LIPSS formation.\nConsiderable disagreement suggests that hydrodynamic mechanisms can be\nresponsible for the observed pattern periodicity.\n", "  Voltage-driven 180$^\\circ$ magnetization switching without electric current\nprovides the possibility for revolutionizing the spintronics. We demonstrated\nthe voltage-driven charge-mediated 180$^\\circ$ magnetization switching at room\ntemperature by combining first-principles calculations and\ntemperature-dependent magnetization dynamics simulation. The electric field\n($E$) induced interface charge is found to allow a giant modulation of the\nmagnetic anisotropy ($K$) of the nanomagnet. Particularly $K$ is revealed to\nvary linearly with respect to $E$ and the epitaxial strain. Magnetization\ndynamics simulations using the so-obtained $K$ show that both in-plane and\nperpendicular 180$^\\circ$ switching can be achieved by $E$ pulses. The\ntemperature effect renders the 180$^\\circ$ switching as probability events.\nStatistical analysis indicates a fast (around 4 ns) and low-error-probability\n180$^\\circ$ switching achievable at room temperature by controlling the\nmagnitude of $E$ and the pulse width. The study inspires the rational design of\nminiaturized nanoscale spintronic devices where thermal fluctuation has a great\nimpact.\n", "  The electron transport layer (ETL) plays a fundamental role in perovskite\nsolar cells. Recently, graphene-based ETLs have been proved to be good\ncandidate for scalable fabrication processes and to achieve higher carrier\ninjection with respect to most commonly used ETLs. In this work we\nexperimentally study the effects of different graphene-based ETLs in sensitized\nMAPI solar cells. By means of time-integrated and picosecond time-resolved\nphotoluminescence techniques, the carrier recombination dynamics in MAPI films\nembedded in different ETLs is investigated. Using graphene doped mesoporous\nTiO2 (G+mTiO2) with the addition of a lithium-neutralized graphene oxide\n(GO-Li) interlayer as ETL, we find that the carrier collection efficiency is\nincreased by about a factor two with respect to standard mTiO2. Taking\nadvantage of the absorption coefficient dispersion, we probe the MAPI layer\nmorphology, along the thickness, finding that the MAPI embedded in the ETL\ncomposed by G+mTiO2 plus GO-Li brings to a very good crystalline quality of the\nMAPI layer with a trap density about one order of magnitude lower than that\nfound with the other ETLs. In addition, this ETL freezes MAPI at the tetragonal\nphase, regardless of the temperature. Graphene-based ETLs can open the way to\nsignificant improvement of perovskite solar cells.\n", "  We present a new electromagnetic mode that forms at the interface between two\nplanar surfaces laid side by side in free space, effectively guiding energy\nalong an infinitesimal, one-dimensional line. It is shown that this mode occurs\nwhen the boundaries have complementary surface impedances, and it is possible\nto control the mode confinement by altering their values correspondingly. The\nmode exhibits singular field enhancement, broad bandwidth, direction-dependent\npolarization, and robustness to certain defects. As a proof-of-concept,\nexperimental results in the microwave regime are provided using patterned\nconducting sheets. Our proposed effective-medium-based approach is general,\nhowever, thus allowing for potential implementation up to optical frequencies.\nOur system is promising for applications including integrated photonics,\nsensing, switching, chiral quantum coupling, and reconfigurable waveguides.\n", "  Despite well over a century of effort, the proper expression for the\nclassical entropy in statistical mechanics remains a subject of debate. The\nBoltzmann entropy (calculated from a surface in phase space) has been\ncriticized as not being an adiabatic invariant. It has been suggested that the\nGibbs entropy (volume in phase space) is correct, which would forbid the\nconcept of negative temperatures. An apparently innocuous assumption turns out\nto be responsible for much of the controversy, namely, that the energy $E$ and\nthe number of particles $N$ are given exactly. The true distributions are known\nto be extremely narrow (of order $1/\\sqrt{N}$), so that it is surprising that\nthis is a problem. The canonical and grand canonical ensembles provide\nalternative expressions for the entropy that satisfy all requirements. The\nconsequences are that negative temperatures are thermodynamically valid, the\nvalidity of the Gibbs entropy is limited to increasing densities of states, and\nthe completely correct expression for the entropy is given by the grand\ncanonical formulation. The Boltzmann entropy is shown to provide an excellent\napproximation in almost all cases.\n", "  For a bipartite quantum system consisting of subsystems A and B it was shown\nby Zhang et al. (Physics Letters A 376 (2012) 3588-3592) that the amount of\nclassical correlations, which is used to define the quantum discord, is known\nto be bounded from above by the minimum of the von Neumann entropies of the\nsubsystems A and B. We provide an alternative proof that is shorter and more\ntransparent as it works without defining correlation matrices.\n", "  The key requirement to routing in any telecommunication network, and\nespecially in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, is scalability. Routing must\nroute packets between any source and destination in the network without\nincurring unmanageable routing overhead that grows quickly with increasing\nnetwork size and dynamics. Here we present an addressing scheme and a coupled\nnetwork topology design scheme that guarantee essentially optimal routing\nscalability. The FIB sizes are as small as they can be, equal to the number of\nadjacencies a node has, while the routing control overhead is minimized as\nnearly zero routing control messages are exchanged even upon catastrophic\nfailures in the network. The key new ingredient is the addressing scheme, which\nis purely local, based only on geographic coordinates of nodes and a centrality\nmeasure, and does not require any sophisticated non-local computations or\nglobal network topology knowledge for network embedding. The price paid for\nthese benefits is that network topology cannot be arbitrary but should follow a\nspecific design, resulting in Internet-like topologies. The proposed schemes\ncan be most easily deployed in overlay networks, and also in other network\ndeployments, where geolocation information is available, and where network\ntopology can grow following the design specifications.\n", "  This comprehensive study of comet C/1995 O1 focuses first on investigating\nits orbital motion over a period of 17.6 yr (1993-2010). The comet is suggested\nto have approached Jupiter to 0.005 AU on -2251 November 7, in general\nconformity with Marsden's (1999) proposal of a Jovian encounter nearly 4300 yr\nago. The variations of sizable nongravitational effects with heliocentric\ndistance correlate with the evolution of outgassing, asymmetric relative to\nperihelion. The future orbital period will shorten to ~1000 yr because of\norbital-cascade resonance effects. We find that the sublimation curves of\nparent molecules are fitted with the type of a law used for the\nnongravitational acceleration, determine their orbit-integrated mass loss, and\nconclude that the share of water ice was at most 57%, and possibly less than\n50%, of the total outgassed mass. Even though organic parent molecules (many\nstill unidentified) had very low abundances relative to water individually,\ntheir high molar mass and sheer number made them, summarily, important\npotential mass contributors to the total production of gas. The mass loss of\ndust per orbit exceeded that of water ice by a factor of ~12, a dust loading\nhigh enough to imply a major role for heavy organic molecules of low volatility\nin accelerating the minuscule dust particles in the expanding halos to terminal\nvelocities as high as 0.7 km s^{-1}. In Part II, the comet's nucleus will be\nmodeled as a compact cluster of massive fragments to conform to the integrated\nnongravitational effect.\n", "  The hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite materials have emerged as\nremarkable materials for photovoltaic applications. Their strengths include\ngood electric transport properties in spite of the disorder inherent in them.\nMotivated by this observation, we analyze the effects of disorder on the energy\neigenstates of a tight-binding model of these materials. In particular, we\nanalyze the spatial extension of the energy eigenstates, which is quantified by\nthe inverse participation ratio. This parameter exhibits a tendency, and\npossibly a phase transition, to localization as the on-site energy disorder\nstrength is increased. However, we argue that the disorder in the lead halide\nperovskites corresponds to a point in the regime of highly delocalized states.\nOur results also suggest that the electronic states of mixed-halide materials\ntend to be more localized than those of pure materials, which suggests a weaker\ntendency to form extended bonding states in the mixed-halide materials and is\ntherefore not favourable for halide mixing.\n", "  We examine from an algebraic point of view some families of unitary group\nrepresentations that arise in mathematical physics and are associated to\ncontraction families of Lie groups. The contraction families of groups relate\ndifferent real forms of a reductive group and are continuously parametrized,\nbut the unitary representations are defined over a parameter subspace that\nincludes both discrete and continuous parts. Both finite- and\ninfinite-dimensional representations can occur, even within the same family. We\nshall study the simplest nontrivial examples, and use the concepts of algebraic\nfamilies of Harish-Chandra pairs and Harish-Chandra modules, introduced in a\nprevious paper, together with the Jantzen filtration, to construct these\nfamilies of unitary representations algebraically.\n", "  Comprehensive non-invasive spectroscopic techniques and electrical\nmeasurements of the carbon arc revealed two distinguishable plasma synthesis\nregions in the radial direction normal to the arc axis. These regions, which\nare defined as the arc core and the arc periphery, are shown to have very\ndifferent compositions of carbon species with different densities and\ntemperatures. The colder arc periphery is dominated by carbon diatomic\nmolecules (C2), which are in the minority in the composition of the hot arc\ncore. These differences are due to a highly non-uniform distribution of the arc\ncurrent, which is mainly conducted through the arc core populated with carbon\natoms and ions. Therefore, the ablation of the graphite anode is governed by\nthe arc core, while the formation of carbon molecules occurs in the colder arc\nperiphery. This result is consistent with previous predictions that the plasma\nenvironment in the arc periphery is suitable for synthesis of carbon nanotubes.\n", "  Loop quantum gravity is believed to eliminate singularities such as the big\nbang and big crunch singularity. This belief is based on studies of so-called\nloop quantum cosmology which concerns symmetry-reduced models of quantum\ngravity. In this paper, the problem of singularities is analysed in the context\nof the Bohmian formulation of loop quantum cosmology. In this formulation there\nis an actual metric in addition to the wave function, which evolves\nstochastically (rather than deterministically as the case of the particle\nevolution in non-relativistic Bohmian mechanics). Thus a singularity occurs\nwhenever this actual metric is singular. It is shown that in the loop quantum\ncosmology for a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\nspace-time with arbitrary constant spatial curvature and cosmological constant,\ncoupled to a massless homogeneous scalar field, a big bang or big crunch\nsingularity is never obtained. This should be contrasted with the fact that in\nthe Bohmian formulation of the Wheeler-DeWitt theory singularities may exist.\n", "  In the first part of this paper we review a mathematical model for the onset\nand progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that was developed in subsequent\nsteps over several years. The model is meant to describe the evolution of AD in\nvivo. In [Y. Achdou et al., 2013] we treated the problem at a microscopic\nscale, where the typical length scale is a multiple of the size of the soma of\na single neuron. Subsequently, in [M. Bertsch at al., 2016] we concentrated on\nthe macroscopic scale, where brain neurons are regarded as a continuous medium,\nstructured by their degree of malfunctioning.\n  In the second part of the paper we consider the relation between the\nmicroscopic and the macroscopic models. In particular we show under which\nassumptions the kinetic transport equation, which in the macroscopic model\ngoverns the evolution of the probability measure for the degree of\nmalfunctioning of neurons, can be derived from a particle-based setting.\n  In the microscopic model we consider basically mechanism i), modelling it by\na system of Smoluchowski equations for the amyloid concentration (describing\nthe agglomeration phenomenon), with the addition of a diffusion term as well as\nof a source term on the neuronal membrane. At the macroscopic level instead we\nmodel processes i) and ii) by a system of Smoluchowski equations for the\namyloid concentration, coupled to a kinetic-type transport equation for the\ndistribution function of the degree of malfunctioning of the neurons. The\nsecond equation contains an integral term describing the random onset of the\ndisease as a jump process localized in particularly sensitive areas of the\nbrain.\n  Even though we deliberately neglected many aspects of the complexity of the\nbrain and the disease, numerical simulations are in both cases (microscopic and\nmacroscopic) in good qualitative agreement with clinical data.\n", "  Recent numerical simulations showed that the mean flow is generated in\ninhomogeneous turbulence of an incompressible fluid accompanied with helicity\nand system rotation. In order to investigate the mechanism of this phenomenon,\nwe carry out a numerical simulation of inhomogeneous turbulence in a rotating\nsystem. In the simulation, an external force is applied to inject inhomogeneous\nturbulent helicity and the rotation axis is taken to be perpendicular to the\ninhomogeneous direction. No mean velocity is set in the initial condition of\nthe simulation. The simulation results show that only in the case with both the\nhelical forcing and the system rotation, the mean flow directed to the rotation\naxis is generated and sustained. We investigate the physical origin of this\nflow-generation phenomenon by considering the budget of the Reynolds-stress\ntransport equation. It is found that the pressure diffusion term has a large\ncontribution in the Reynolds stress equation and supports the generated mean\nflow. It is shown that a model expression for the pressure diffusion can be\nexpressed by the turbulent helicity gradient coupled with the angular velocity\nof the system rotation. This implies that inhomogeneous helicity can play a\nsignificant role for the generation of the large-scale velocity distribution in\nincompressible turbulent flows.\n", "  A future proton-proton collider with center of mass energy around 100 TeV\nwill have a remarkable capacity to discover massive new particles and continue\nexploring weak scale naturalness. In this work we will study its sensitivity to\ntwo stop simplified models as further examples of its potential power: pair\nproduction of stops that decay to tops or bottoms and higgsinos; and stops that\nare either pair produced or produced together with a gluino and then cascade\ndown through gluinos to the lightest superpartner (LSP). In both simplified\nmodels, super-boosted tops or bottoms with transverse momentum of order TeV\nwill be produced abundantly and call for new strategies to identify them. We\nwill apply a set of simple jet observables, including track-based jet mass,\nN-subjettiness and mass drop, to tag the boosted hadronic or leptonic decaying\nobjects and suppress the Standard Model as well as possible SUSY backgrounds.\nAssuming 10% systematic uncertainties, the future 100 TeV collider can discover\n(exclude) stops with masses up to 6 (7) TeV with 3 inverse attobarns of\nintegrated luminosity if the stops decay to higgsinos. If the stops decay\nthrough gluinos to LSPs, due to additional SUSY backgrounds from gluino pair\nproduction, a higher luminosity of about 30 inverse attobarns is needed to\ndiscover stops up to 6 TeV. We will also discuss how to use jet observables to\ndistinguish simplified models with different types of LSPs. The boosted top or\nbottom tagging strategies developed in this paper could also be used in other\nsearches at a 100 TeV collider. For example, the strategy could help discover\ngluino pair production with gluino mass close to 11 TeV with 3 inverse\nattobarns of integrated luminosity.\n", "  Non-perturbative D-brane instanton effects in 4d N = 1 string\ncompactifications can be geometrized in terms of a backreacted generalized\ngeometry. We extend earlier results to setups in which the D-brane instanton is\ncharged under the 4d gauge symmetries, and show that the backreacted topology\nyields the correct charged field theory operators in the 4d effective action.\nIn type IIA models with D6-branes, the backreaction of D2-brane instantons\nforces the recombination of D6-branes, such that the 4d charged field theory\noperators arise from basic worldsheet instantons in the backreacted geometry.\nWe provide large classes of examples of D2-brane instanton effects on\nintersecting D6-brane systems in local models mirror to D3-branes at\nsingularities. The backreacted geometry and the field theory operators are\neasily encoded in terms of simple operation in the graphs arising from the\nunderlying dimer diagrams. This description agrees, in the appropriate cases,\nwith the complex deformations triggered by certain fractional branes at the\nbottom of duality cascades.\n", "  We study a spin-orbital model for 4$d^{1}$ or 5$d^{1}$ Mott insulators in\nordered double perovskites with strong spin-orbit coupling. This model is\nconveniently written in terms of pseudospin and pseudo-orbital operators\nrepresenting multipoles of the effective $j=3/2$ angular momentum. Similarities\nbetween this model and the effective theories of Kitaev materials motivate the\nproposal of a chiral spin-orbital liquid with Majorana fermion excitations. The\nthermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of this quantum spin liquid are\ncharacterized using parton mean-field theory. The heat capacity, spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate, and dynamic structure factor for inelastic neutron scattering\nare calculated and compared with the experimental data for the spin liquid\ncandidate Ba$_{2}$YMoO$_{6}$. Moreover, based on a symmetry analysis, we\ndiscuss the operators involved in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS)\namplitudes for double perovskite compounds. In general, the RIXS cross sections\nallow one to selectively probe pseudospin and pseudo-orbital degrees of\nfreedom. For the chiral spin-orbital liquid in particular, these cross sections\nprovide information about the spectrum for different flavors of Majorana\nfermions.\n", "  Cosmic rays are an important factor of space weather determining radiation\nconditions near the Earth and it seems to be essential to clarify radiation\nconditions near extrasolar planets too. Last year a terrestrial planet\ncandidate was discovered in an orbit around Proxima Centauri. Here we present\nour estimates on parameters of stellar wind of the Parker model, possible\nfluxes and fluencies of galactic and stellar cosmic rays based on the available\ndata of the Proxima Centauri activity and its magnetic field. We found that\ngalactic cosmic rays will be practically absent near Proxima~b up to energies\nof 1~TeV due to the modulation by the stellar wind. Stellar cosmic rays may be\naccelerated in Proxima Centauri events, which are able to permanently maintain\ndensity of stellar cosmic rays in the astrosphere comparable to low energy\ncosmic ray density in the heliosphere. Maximal proton intensities in extreme\nProxima events should be by 3--4 orders more than in solar events.\n", "  Considering the Einstein field equations in Lyra manifold, and applying the\nunified first law of thermodynamics as well as the Clausius relation to the\napparent horizon of FRW universe, we find the entropy of apparent horizon in\nLyra manifold. In addition, the validity of second law of thermodynamics and\nits generalized form are also studied. Finally, we use the first law of\nthermodynamics in order to find the horizon entropy of static spherically\nsymmetric spacetimes. Some results of considering (anti)de-Sitter and\nSchwarzschild metrics have also been addressed.\n", "  Using an extension of Pirogov-Sinai theory we prove phase transitions,\ncorresponding to sublattice orderings, for a general class of hard core lattice\nparticle systems with a finite number of close packed configurations. These\ninclude many cases for which such transitions have been proven. The proof also\nshows that, for these systems, the Gaunt-Fisher expansion of the pressure in\npowers of the inverse fugacity (aside from an explicit logarithmic term) has a\nnonzero radius of convergence.\n", "  In the three-body system with one resonantly interacting pair, we study the\nbehavior of the $S$-matrix pole near the threshold in the fourth quadrant of\nthe unphysical complex energy plane. Our study is essentially based on the\nunitarity and analyticity of the $S$-matrix and employs the\nAlt-Grassberger-Sandhas (AGS) equations specifically for the three-body\nscattering problem and the dispersion relation for the inverse $T$-matrix. We\nfind that the trajectory of the complex energy, $E$, of the $S$-matrix pole\nnear the threshold is uniquely given by $c_0 + E \\log{\\left( - E \\right)}\n\\approx 0$ or $c_0 + E_R \\log E_R \\approx 0$, $E_I \\approx \\pi E_R/\\log E_R$ in\nthe fourth quadrant of the unphysical complex energy plane, in contrast to the\nnon-unique trajectories with no resonantly interacting pair, $c_0 + c_1 E + E^2\n\\log{\\left( - E \\right)} \\approx 0$ or $E_R \\approx -c_0/c_1$, $E_I \\approx\n-\\pi E_R^2/c_1$ where $E_R$ and $E_I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $E$,\nrespectively, and $c_0$ and $c_1$ are real constants. This is a new universal\nbehavior of the $S$-matrix near the threshold. Also, we briefly discuss\nimplications to exotic hadron candidates.\n", "  We report on an investigation of simultaneous generation of several\nnarrow-bandwidth laser-like coherent emissions from nitrogen molecular ions ( )\nproduced in intense mid-infrared laser fields. With systematic examinations on\nthe dependences of coherent emissions on gas pressure as well as several laser\nparameters including laser intensity, polarization and wavelength of the pump\nlaser pulses, we reveal that the multiple coherent emission lines generated in\noriginate from a series of nonlinear processes beginning with four-wave mixing,\nfollowed with stimulated Raman scattering. Our analyses further show that the\nobserved nonlinear processes are greatly enhanced at the resonant wavelengths,\ngiving rise to high conversion efficiencies from the infrared pump laser pulses\nto the coherent emission lines near the transition wavelengths between the\ndifferent vibrational energy levels of ground X and that of the excited B\nstates.\n", "  We propose a higher-order Skyrme model with derivative terms of eighth, tenth\nand twelfth order. Our construction yields simple and easy-to-interpret\nhigher-order Lagrangians. We first show that a Skyrmion with higher-order terms\nproposed by Marleau has an instability in the form of a baby-Skyrmion string,\nwhile the static energies of our construction are positive definite, implying\nstability against time-independent perturbations. However, we also find that\nthe Hamiltonians of our construction possess two kinds of dynamical\ninstabilities, which may indicate the instability with respect to\ntime-dependent perturbations. Different from the well-known Ostrogradsky\ninstability, the instabilities that we find are intrinsically of nonlinear\nnature and also due to the fact that even powers of the inverse metric gives a\nghost-like higher-order kinetic-like term. The vacuum state is, however,\nstable. Finally, we show that at sufficiently low energies, our Hamiltonians in\nthe simplest cases, are stable against time-dependent perturbations.\n", "  We use integrability at weak coupling to compute fishnet diagrams for\nfour-point correlation functions in planar $\\phi^4$ theory. The results are\nalways multi-linear combinations of ladder integrals, which are in turn built\nout of classical polylogarithms. The Steinmann relations provide a powerful\nconstraint on such linear combinations, leading to a natural conjecture for any\nfishnet diagram as the determinant of a matrix of ladder integrals.\n", "  The mirror dual objects corresponding to affine Lagrangian (multi) sections\nof a trivial special Lagrangian torus fibration T^{2n}--->T^n are holomorphic\nvector bundles on a mirror dual complex torus of dimension n via the\nhomological mirror symmetry. In this paper, we construct a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between those holomorphic vector bundles and a certain kind of\nprojectively flat bundles explicitly, by using the result of the classification\nof factors of automorphy of projectively flat bundles on complex tori.\nFurthermore, we give a geometric interpretation of the exact triangles\nconsisting of projectively flat bundles on complex tori by focusing on the\ndimension of intersections of the corresponding affine Lagrangian submanifolds.\n", "  Modern reconstruction methods for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exploit\nthe spatially varying sensitivity profiles of receive-coil arrays as additional\nsource of information. This allows to reduce the number of time-consuming\nFourier-encoding steps by undersampling. The receive sensitivities are a priori\nunknown and influenced by geometry and electric properties of the (moving)\nsubject. For optimal results, they need to be estimated jointly with the image\nfrom the same undersampled measurement data. Formulated as an inverse problem,\nthis leads to a bilinear reconstruction problem related to multi-channel blind\ndeconvolution. In this work, we will discuss some recently developed approaches\nfor the solution of this problem.\n", "  The Cartesian material space approach to Maxwell's equations reveals the\nanalytical solution of the continuous radial density for the extended\nelementary charge. Radial charges and their Coulomb fields carry equal passive\nand active imaginary energies. The Einstein mass-energy formula can be updated\nfor electricity in complex numbers. The Principle of Equivalence works\nuniversally for active/passive masses and for active/passive electric charges.\nMaxwell's equations for complex continuous charges become 4-vector identities\nfor locally paired flows of energies that correspond to the Chinese yin-yang\napproach to the nature. Cartesian relativistic physics has its own nondual\nanalog of the Einstein Equation, which leads to geodesic equations for the\nmotion of Ricci material densities and to vortex states of the elementary\nmass-extension. Non-empty space physics modifies the Navier-Stokes equation by\nkinematic \"living forces\". This inertial feedback enables a conceptual choice\nbetween Newtonian and Cartesian universes (with localized or extended\nelementary masses, respectively) because of new predictions of pressure and\ntemperature gradients across laboratory flows of liquids and gases.\n", "  Artificial skyglow is constantly growing on a global scale, with potential\necological consequences ranging up to affecting biodiversity. To understand\nthese consequences, worldwide mapping of skyglow for all weather conditions is\nurgently required. In particular, the amplification of skyglow by clouds needs\nto be studied, as clouds can extend the reach of skyglow into remote areas not\naffected by light pollution on clear nights. Here we use commercial digital\nsingle lens reflex cameras with fisheye lenses for all-sky photometry. We track\nthe reach of skyglow from a peri-urban into a remote area on a clear and a\npartly cloudy night by performing transects from the Spanish town of Balaguer\ntowards Montsec Astronomical Park. From one single all-sky image, we extract\nzenith luminance, horizontal and scalar illuminance. While zenith luminance\nreaches near-natural levels at 5km distance from the town on the clear night,\nsimilar levels are only reached at 27km on the partly cloudy night. Our results\nshow the dramatic increase of the reach of skyglow even for moderate cloud\ncoverage at this site. The powerful and easy-to-use method promises to be\nwidely applicable for studies of ecological light pollution on a global scale\nalso by non-specialists in photometry.\n", "  The inequality $m^3\\geq \\frac{27\\pi}{4}\n|\\mathcal{J}_{2}||\\mathcal{J}_{1}-\\mathcal{J}_{2}|$ relating total mass and\nangular momenta, is established for (possibly dynamical) spacetimes admitting\nblack holes of ring ($S^1\\times S^2$) topology. This inequality is shown to be\nsharp in the sense that it is saturated precisely for the extreme\nPomeransky-Sen'kov black ring solutions. The physical significance of this\ninequality and its relation to new evidence of black ring instability, as well\nas the standard picture of gravitational collapse, are discussed.\n", "  Neural networks can efficiently encode the probability distribution of errors\nin an error correcting code. Moreover, these distributions can be conditioned\non the syndromes of the corresponding errors. This paves a path forward for a\ndecoder that employs a neural network to calculate the conditional\ndistribution, then sample from the distribution - the sample will be the\npredicted error for the given syndrome. We present an implementation of such an\nalgorithm that can be applied to any stabilizer code. Testing it on the toric\ncode, it has higher threshold than a number of known decoders thanks to\nnaturally finding the most probable error and accounting for correlations\nbetween errors.\n", "  A hard proximity-induced superconducting gap has recently been observed in\nsemiconductor nanowire systems at low magnetic fields. However, in the\ntopological regime at high magnetic fields, a soft gap emerges and represents a\nfundamental obstacle to topologically protected quantum information processing\nwith Majorana bound states. Here we show that in a setup of double Rashba\nnanowires that are coupled to an s-wave superconductor and subjected to an\nexternal magnetic field along the wires, the topological threshold can be\nsignificantly reduced by the destructive interference of direct and\ncrossed-Andreev pairing in this setup, precisely down to the magnetic field\nregime in which current experimental technology allows for a hard\nsuperconducting gap. We also show that the resulting Majorana bound states\nexhibit sufficiently short localization lengths, which makes them ideal\ncandidates for future braiding experiments.\n", "  We present a Monte Carlo study of the magnetic properties of an Ising\nmultilayer ferrimagnet. The system consists of two kinds of non-equivalent\nplanes, one of which is site-diluted. All intralayer couplings are\nferromagnetic. The different kinds of planes are stacked alternately and the\ninterlayer couplings are antiferromagnetic. We perform the simulations using\nthe Wolff algorithm and employ multiple histogram reweighting and finite-size\nscaling methods to analyze the data with special emphasis on the study of\ncompensation phenomena. Compensation and critical temperatures of the system\nare obtained as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters and we present a\ndetailed discussion about the contribution of each parameter to the presence or\nabsence of the compensation effect. A comparison is presented between our\nresults and those reported in the literature for the same model using the pair\napproximation. We also compare our results with those obtained through both the\npair approximation and Monte Carlo simulations for the bilayer system.\n", "  We examine the behavior of entanglement entropy of a subsystem $A$ in a fully\nbackreacted holographic model of a $1+1$ dimensional $p$ wave superconductor\nacross the phase transition. For a given temperature, the system goes to a\nsuperconducting phase beyond a critical value of the charge density. The\nentanglement entropy, considered as a function of the charge density at a given\ntemperature, has a cusp at the critical point. In addition, we find that there\nare three different behaviors in the condensed phase, depending on the\nsubsystem size. For a subsystem size $l$ smaller than a critical size $l_{c1}$,\nentanglement entropy continues to increase as a function of the charge density\nas we cross the phase transition. When $l$ lies between $l_{c1}$ and another\ncritical size $l_{c2}$ the entanglement entropy displays a non-monotonic\nbehavior, while for $l > l_{c2}$ it decreases monotonically. At large charge\ndensities entanglement entropy appears to saturate. The non-monotonic behavior\nleads to a novel phase diagram for this system.\n", "  We investigated the electronic states of the quasi-one-dimensional organic\nconductors $\\delta'_{P}$-(BPDT-TTF)$_2$ICl$_2$ and\n$\\delta'_{C}$-(BPDT-TTF)$_2$ICl$_2$, both of which are insulating at room\ntemperature owing to strong electron correlations. Through measurements of\nelectrical resistivity, optical conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility, as\nwell as band-structure calculations, we have revealed that the two materials\npossess completely different ground states, even though they have the same\nchemical composition and stacking configuration of the donor molecules. We have\nfound that the $\\delta_P'$-type salt with an effective half-filled band behaves\nas a dimer-Mott (DM) insulator and exhibits a nonmagnetic transition at 25 K,\nwhereas the $\\delta'_C$-type salt with a 3/4-filled band shows a charge\nordering (CO) transition just above room temperature and becomes nonmagnetic\nbelow 20 K. The optical spectra of the $\\delta_P'$-type salt are composed of\ntwo characteristic bands due to intra- and interdimer charge transfers,\nsupporting the DM insulating behavior arising from the strong on-site Coulomb\ninteraction. By contrast, in the $\\delta'_C$-type salt, a single band\ncharacterizing the formation of CO arising from the off-site Coulomb\ninteractions is observed. Upon lowering the temperature, the shape of the\noptical spectra in the $\\delta_C'$-type salt becomes asymmetric and shifts to\nmuch lower frequencies, suggesting the emergence of domain-wall excitations\nwith fractional charges expected in a one-dimensional CO chain. The temperature\ndependence of the magnetic susceptibility of the $\\delta_P'$-type salt is well\ndescribed by a 2D spin-1/2 Heisenberg AFM model on an anisotropic square\nlattice in the dimerized picture, while in the $\\delta_C'$-type salt, it can be\nexplained by a 2D spin-1/2 Heisenberg AFM model on an anisotropic honeycomb\nlattice formed in the CO state.\n", "  Study of an N qubit mixed symmetric separable states is a long standing\nchallenging problem as there exist no unique separability criterion. In this\nregard, we take up the N-qubit mixed symmetric separable states for a detailed\nstudy as these states are of experimental importance and offer elegant\nmathematical analysis since the dimension of the Hilbert space reduces from 2^N\nto N + 1. Since there exists a one to one correspondence between spin-j system\nand an N-qubit symmetric state, we employ Fano statistical tensor parameters\nfor the parametrization of spin density matrix. Further, we use geometric\nmultiaxial representation(MAR) of density matrix to characterize the mixed\nsymmetric separable states. Since separability problem is NP hard, we choose to\nstudy it in the continuum limit where mixed symmetric separable states are\ncharacterized by the P-distribution function \\lambda(\\theta; \\phi). We show\nthat the N-qubit mixed symmetric separable state can be visualized as a\nuniaxial system if the distribution function is independent of \\theta and \\phi.\nWe further choose distribution function to be the most general positive\nfunction on a sphere and observe that the statistical tensor parameters\ncharacterizing the N-qubit symmetric system are the expansion coefficients of\nthe distribution function. As an example for the discrete case, we investigate\nthe MAR of a uniformly weighted two qubit mixed symmetric separable state. We\nalso observe that there exists a correspondence between separability and\nclassicality of states.\n", "  We investigated the magnetic behavior of metal hydrides FeH$_{x}$, CoH$_{x}$\nand NiH$_{x}$ for several concentrations of hydrogen ($x$) by using Density\nFunctional Theory calculations. Several structural phases of the metallic host:\nbcc ($\\alpha$), fcc ($\\gamma$), hcp ($\\varepsilon$), dhcp ($\\varepsilon'$),\ntetragonal structure for FeH$_{x}$ and $\\varepsilon$-$\\gamma$ phases for\nCoH$_{x}$, were studied. We found that for CoH$_{x}$ and NiH$_{x}$ the magnetic\nmoment ($m$) decreases regardless the concentration $x$. However, for FeH$_{x}$\nsystems, $m$ increases or decreases depending on the variation in $x$. In order\nto find a general trend for these changes of $m$ in magnetic metal hydrides, we\ncompare our results with the Slater-Pauling curve for ferromagnetic metallic\nbinary alloys. It is found that the $m$ of metal hydrides made of Fe, Co and Ni\nfits the shape of the Slater-Pauling curve as a function of $x$. Our results\nindicate that there are two main effects that determine the $m$ value due to\nhydrogenation: an increase of volume causes $m$ to increase, and the addition\nof an extra electron to the metal always causes it to decrease. We discuss\nthese behaviors in detail.\n", "  We consider a generalization of the quantum Rabi model where the two-level\nsystem and the single-mode cavity oscillator are coupled by an additional\nStark-like term. By adapting a method recently introduced by Braak [Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 107}, 100401 (2011)], we solve the model exactly. The low-lying\nspectrum in the experimentally relevant ultrastrong and deep strong regimes of\nthe Rabi coupling is found to exhibit two striking features absent from the\noriginal quantum Rabi model: avoided level crossings for states of the same\nparity and an anomalously rapid onset of two-fold near-degenerate levels as the\nRabi coupling increases.\n", "  Based on their formation mechanisms, Dirac points in three-dimensional\nsystems can be classified as accidental or essential. The former can be further\ndistinguished into type-I and type-II, depending on whether the Dirac cone\nspectrum is completely tipped over along certain direction. Here, we predict\nthe coexistence of all three kinds of Dirac points in the low-energy band\nstructure of CaAgBi-family materials with a stuffed Wurtzite structure. Two\npairs of accidental Dirac points reside on the rotational axis, with one pair\nbeing type-I and the other pair type-II; while another essential Dirac point is\npinned at the high symmetry point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Due to broken\ninversion symmetry, the band degeneracy around accidental Dirac points is\ncompletely lifted except along the rotational axis, which may enable the\nsplitting of chiral carriers at a ballistic p-n junction with a double negative\nrefraction effect. We clarify their symmetry protections, and find both the\nDirac-cone and Fermi arc topological surface states.\n", "  The particle exchange model of hadron interactions can be used to describe\nthree-body scattering under the isobar assumption. In this study we start from\nthe 3->3 scattering amplitude for spinless particles, which contains an\nisobar-spectator scattering amplitude. Using a Bethe-Salpeter Ansatz for the\nlatter, we derive a relativistic three-dimensional scattering equation that\nmanifestly fulfills three-body unitarity and two-body unitarity for the\nsub-amplitudes. This property holds for energies above breakup and also in the\npresence of resonances in the sub-amplitudes.\n", "  We use the invariant-based inverse engineering subject to the quasiadiabatic\ncondition to produce robust and high fidelity coherent superposition of quantum\nstates. The inverse engineering provides shortcuts to the desired quantum-state\nevolution while the quasiadiabaticity provides robustness with respect to\nerrors. We derive simple pulses with low areas which are robust with respect to\npulse area and detuning.\n", "  Commercial photon-counting modules based on actively quenched solid-state\navalanche photodiode sensors are used in a wide variety of applications.\nManufacturers characterize their detectors by specifying a small set of\nparameters, such as detection efficiency, dead time, dark counts rate,\nafterpulsing probability and single-photon arrival-time resolution (jitter).\nHowever, they usually do not specify the range of conditions over which these\nparameters are constant or present a sufficient description of the\ncharacterization process. In this work, we perform a few novel tests on two\ncommercial detectors and identify an additional set of imperfections that must\nbe specified to sufficiently characterize their behavior. These include\nrate-dependence of the dead time and jitter, detection delay shift, and\n\"twilighting.\" We find that these additional non-ideal behaviors can lead to\nunexpected effects or strong deterioration of the performance of a system using\nthese devices. We explain their origin by an in-depth analysis of the active\nquenching process. To mitigate the effects of these imperfections, a\ncustom-built detection system is designed using a novel active quenching\ncircuit. Its performance is compared against two commercial detectors in a fast\nquantum key distribution system with hyper-entangled photons and a random\nnumber generator.\n", "  We study the Landau equation for a mixture of two species in the whole space,\nwith initial condition of one species near a vacuum and the other near a\nMaxwellian equilibrium state. For the linearized level, without any smoothness\nassumption on the initial data, it is shown that the solution becomes smooth\ninstantaneously in both the space and momentum variables. Moreover, the large\ntime behavior of the solution is also obtained.\n", "  Using relativistic quantum mechanics, we study the spectrum of a non-BPS\ntwo-particle bound state in the massive phase of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super\nYang-Mills, in the limit when one of the particles is infinitely heavier than\nthe other. We find that the spectrum shows the exact $n^2$ degeneracy for each\nprincipal quantum number $n$, just as in the strict non-relativistic limit.\nThis is in line with the findings of Caron-Huot and Henn, who studied the same\nsystem in the large $N$ limit with the technique of integrability and the dual\nconformal symmetry.\n", "  Suspensions of hard core spherical particles of diameter $D$ with inter-core\nconnectivity range $\\delta$ can be described in terms of random geometric\ngraphs, where nodes represent the sphere centers and edges are assigned to any\ntwo particles separated by a distance smaller than $\\delta$. By exploiting the\nproperty that closed loops of connected spheres becomes increasingly rare as\nthe connectivity range diminishes, we study continuum percolation of hard\nspheres by treating the network of connected particles as having a treelike\nstructure for small $\\delta/D$. We derive an analytic expression of the\npercolation threshold which becomes increasingly accurate as $\\delta/D$\ndiminishes, and whose validity can be extended to a broader range of\nconnectivity distances by a simple rescaling.\n", "  First the fluctuation energy is derived from the adiabatic random\nfluctuations due to the second-order perturbation theory, and the evolutionary\nrelation for it is expressed in the form of rho_f = rho_f (rho), where rho and\nrho_f are the densities of ordinary dust and the fluctuation energy,\nrespectively. The pressureless matter as a constituent of the universe at the\nlater stage is assumed to consist of ordinary dust and the fluctuation energy.\nNext, cosmological models including the fluctuation energy as a kind of dark\nmatter are derived using the above relation, and it is found that the Hubble\nparameter and the other model parameters in the derived models can be\nconsistent with the recent observational values. Moreover, the perturbations of\nrho and rho_f are studied.\n", "  The ability to uniquely identify an object or device is important for\nauthentication. Imperfections, locked into structures during fabrication, can\nbe used to provide a fingerprint that is challenging to reproduce. In this\npaper, we propose a simple optical technique to read unique information from\nnanometer-scale defects in 2D materials. Flaws created during crystal growth or\nfabrication lead to spatial variations in the bandgap of 2D materials that can\nbe characterized through photoluminescence measurements. We show a simple setup\ninvolving an angle-adjustable transmission filter, simple optics and a CCD\ncamera can capture spatially-dependent photoluminescence to produce complex\nmaps of unique information from 2D monolayers. Atomic force microscopy is used\nto verify the origin of the optical signature measured, demonstrating that it\nresults from nanometer-scale imperfections. This solution to optical\nidentification with 2D materials could be employed as a robust security measure\nto prevent counterfeiting.\n", "  The quantum nature of a microscopic system can only be revealed when it is\nsufficiently decoupled from surroundings. Interactions with the environment\ninduce relaxation and decoherence that turn the quantum state into a classical\nmixture. Here, we study the timescales of these processes for a qubit encoded\nin the collective state of a set of magnetic atoms deposited on a metallic\nsurface. For that, we provide a generalization of the commonly used definitions\nof $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ characterizing relaxation and decoherence rates. We\ncalculate these quantities for several atomic structures, including a\ncollective spin, a setup implementing a decoherence-free subspace, and two\nexamples of spin chains. Our work contributes to the comprehensive\nunderstanding of the relaxation and decoherence processes and shows the\nadvantages of the implementation of a decoherence free subspace in these\nsetups.\n", "  Breaking of G-parity or new weak (second class) currents can be responsible\nfor $\\tau^- \\to \\eta^{(\\prime)} \\pi^- \\nu_{\\tau}$ decays. Forthcoming\nmeasurements of $\\tau$ lepton properties at the Belle II experiment will be\nable to measure this decay channel for the first time. Isolating new physics\ncontributions from the measured rates will require a careful evaluation of\nG-parity breaking contributions. Here we evaluate the one-loop contribution to\n$\\tau^- \\to \\eta^{(\\prime)} \\pi^- \\nu_{\\tau}$ decays induced by the emission of\ntwo virtual photons and its later conversion into an $\\eta^{(\\prime)}$ meson.\nAs expected, this contribution is very small and may be relevant only for new\nphysics searches contributing at the $10^{-4}$ level to the decay rate of\n$\\tau^- \\to \\eta^{(\\prime)} \\pi^- \\nu_{\\tau}$ .\n", "  The cluster slave-spin method is introduced to systematically investigate the\nsolutions of the Hubbard model including the symmetry-broken phases. In this\nmethod, the electron operator is factorized into a fermioninc spinon describing\nthe physical spin and a slave-spin describing the charge fluctuations.\nFollowing the $U(1)$ formalism derived by Yu and Si [Phys. Rev. B 86, 085104\n(2012)], it is shown that the self-consistent equations to explore various\nsymmetry-broken density wave states can be constructed in general with a\ncluster of multiple slave-spin sites. We employ this method to study the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) state in the single band Hubbard model with the two and\nfour-site clusters of slave spins. While the Hubbard gap, the charge gap due to\nthe doubly-occupied states, scales with the Hubbard interaction $U$ as\nexpected, the AFM gap $\\Delta$, the gap in the spinon dispersion in the AFM\nstate, exhibits a crossover from the weak to strong-coupling behaviors as $U$\nincreases. Our cluster slave-spin method reproduces not only the traditional\nmean-field behavior of $\\Delta \\sim U$ in the weak-coupling limit, but also the\nbehavior of $\\Delta \\sim t^2/U$ predicted by the superexchange mechanism in the\nstrong coupling limit. In addition, the holon-doublon correlator as functions\nof $U$ and doping $x$ is also computed, which exhibits a strong tendency toward\nthe holon-doublon binding in the strong coupling regime. We further show that\nthe quasiparticle weight obtained by the cluster slave-spin method is in a good\nagreement with the generalized Gutzwiller approximation in both AFM and\nparamagnetic states, and the results can be improved beyond the generalized\nGutzwiller approximation as the cluster is enlarged from a single site to 4\nsites. Our results demonstrate that the cluster slave-spin method can be a\npowerful tool to systematically investigate the strongly correlated system.\n", "  We study the creation and distribution of entanglement in disordered\n$XY$-type spin-$1/2$ chains for the paradigmatic case of a single flipped spin\nprepared on a fully polarized background. The local magnetic field is set to\nfollow a disordered long-range-correlated sequence with power-law spectrum.\nDepending on the degree of correlations of the disorder, a set of extended\nmodes emerge in the middle of the band yielding an interplay between\nlocalization and delocalization. As a consequence, a rich variety of\nentanglement distribution patterns arises, which we evaluate here through the\nconcurrence between two spins. We show that, even in the presence of disorder,\nthe entanglement wave can be pushed to spread out reaching distant sites and\nalso enhance pairwise entanglement between the initial site and the rest of the\nchain. We also study the propagation of an initial maximally-entangled state\nthrough the chain and show that correlated disorder improves the transmission\nquite significantly when compared with the uncorrelated counterpart. Our work\ncontributes in designing solid-state devices for quantum information processing\nin the realistic setting of correlated static disorder.\n", "  This study proposes a simple and efficient one-out-of-two quantum oblivious\ntransfer (QOT) protocol based on nonorthogonal states. The nonorthogonal\nproperty grants quantum bit immunity to some operations in order to achieve the\nirreversible goal of discarding a message, resulting in a one-out-of-two\nselection effect. In addition, it can also prevent entangled cheating from an\nillegal agent. The resulting QOT protocol is therefore built directly on\nquantum resources, rather than on a two-level structure which must first create\ntwo classical keys using the quantum resources (all-or-nothing QOT), and then\nbuild the one-out-of-two protocol from there. Furthermore, the proposed\nprotocol allows Alice to test Bob's loyalty by comparing the measurement\nresults. Moreover, the relationship with the no-go theorem is discussed in\ndetail; this relationship is often overlooked in other studies. The no-go\ntheorem discussion and security analysis demonstrate that the proposed protocol\ndoes not belong to the no-go theorem constraint, and is secure against both\nexternal and internal attacks. In addition, the efficacy analysis shows that\nthe proposed protocol is more efficient than other two-level structure\nprotocols.\n", "  We study the mutual alignment of radio sources within two surveys, FIRST and\nTGSS. This is done by producing two position angle catalogues containing the\npreferential directions of respectively $30\\,059$ and $11\\,674$ extended\nsources distributed over more than $7\\,000$ and $17\\,000$ square degrees. The\nidentification of the sources in the FIRST sample was performed in advance by\nvolunteers of the Radio Galaxy Zoo project, while for the TGSS sample it is the\nresult of an automated process presented here. After taking into account\nsystematic effects, marginal evidence of a local alignment on scales smaller\nthan $2.5\\deg$ is found in the FIRST sample. The probability of this happening\nby chance is found to be less than $2$ per cent. Further study suggests that on\nscales up to $1.5\\deg$ the alignment is maximal. For one third of the sources,\nthe Radio Galaxy Zoo volunteers identified an optical counterpart. Assuming a\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\\Omega_m = 0.31, \\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.69$, we\nconvert the maximum angular scale on which alignment is seen into a physical\nscale in the range $[19, 38]$ Mpc $h_{70}^{-1}$. This result supports recent\nevidence reported by Taylor and Jagannathan of radio jet alignment in the $1.4$\ndeg$^2$ ELAIS N1 field observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The\nTGSS sample is found to be too sparsely populated to manifest a similar signal.\n", "  Accurate tracking of probes is one of the key points of space exploration.\nRange and Doppler techniques are the most commonly used. In this paper we\nanalyze the impact of the transponder delay, $i.e.$ the processing time between\nreception and re-emission of a two-way tracking link at the satellite, on\ntracking observables and on spacecraft orbits. We show that this term, only\npartially accounted for in the standard formulation of computed space\nobservables, can actually be relevant for future missions with high nominal\ntracking accuracies or for the re-processing of old missions. We present\nseveral applications of our formulation to Earth flybys, the NASA GRAIL and the\nESA BepiColombo missions.\n", "  In this second paper, we develop the full mathematical structure of the\nalgebra of the pseudo-observables, in order to solve the quantum measurement\nproblem. Quantum state vectors are recovered but as auxiliary\npseudo-observables storing the information acquired in a set of observations.\nThe whole process of measurement is deeply reanalyzed in the conclusive\nsection, evidencing original aspects. The relation of the theory with some\npopular interpretations of Quantum Mechanics is also discussed, showing that\nboth Relational Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Bayesianism may be regarded as\ncompatible interpretations of the theory. A final discussion on reality, tries\nto bring a new insight on it.\n", "  We provide an assessment of the energy dependence of key measurements within\nthe scope of the machine parameters for a U.S. based Electron-Ion Collider\n(EIC) outlined in the EIC White Paper. We first examine the importance of the\nphysics underlying these measurements in the context of the outstanding\nquestions in nuclear science. We then demonstrate, through detailed simulations\nof the measurements, that the likelihood of transformational scientific\ninsights is greatly enhanced by making the energy range and reach of the EIC as\nlarge as practically feasible.\n", "  The rigid-irrotational flow transformation in the previous microscopic\ncranking model (MCRM) for nuclear collective rotation about a single axis and\nits coupling to intrinsic motion is generalized. This generalization allow us\nto consider the limit of vanishingly small collective angular velocity and\nhence collective angular momentum while the collective moment of inertia\nremains finite. In this limit, the collective flow become large and oppose one\nanother collaborating the vanishing of the collective angular momentum. In this\nlimit, the MCRM equation for the angular-momentum constraint on the intrinsic\nwavefunction becomes identical to that of the conventional cranking model\n(CCRM). In this limit, the MCRM Schrodinger equation also becomes identical to\nthat of the CCRM with an added irrotational-flow kinetic energy component. In\nthis limit, the time-reversal invariance of the MCRM Schrodinger equation is\ndestroyed. The two MCRM equations (with no free parameters) are solved for the\nground-state rotational band in the nucleus for a simple deformed harmonic\noscillator potential. The predicted excitation energy and quadrupole moment are\nclose to those observed empirically, with the differences seemingly\nattributable to the absence, in the model, of pairing correlations at low\nangular momenta and Coriolis-force induced quasi-particle rotation alignment at\nhigher angular momenta. The ground-state terminal (cut-off) angular momentum is\npredicted to be 10 instead of 8 observed empirically and predicted by the CCRM.\nIt is assumed that pairing correlations would reduce the cut-off angular\nmomentum.\n", "  We show that the counting of observables and correlators for a 3-index tensor\nmodel are organized by the structure of a family of permutation centralizer\nalgebras. These algebras are shown to be semi-simple and their Wedderburn-Artin\ndecompositions into matrix blocks are given in terms of Clebsch-Gordan\ncoefficients of symmetric groups. The matrix basis for the algebras also gives\nan orthogonal basis for the tensor observables which diagonalizes the Gaussian\ntwo-point functions. The centres of the algebras are associated with\ncorrelators which are expressible in terms of Kronecker coefficients\n(Clebsch-Gordan multiplicities of symmetric groups). The color-exchange\nsymmetry present in the Gaussian model, as well as a large class of interacting\nmodels, is used to refine the description of the permutation centralizer\nalgebras. This discussion is extended to a general number of colors $d$: it is\nused to prove the integrality of an infinite family of number sequences related\nto color-symmetrizations of colored graphs, and expressible in terms of\nsymmetric group representation theory data. Generalizing a connection between\nmatrix models and Belyi maps, correlators in Gaussian tensor models are\ninterpreted in terms of covers of singular 2-complexes. There is an intriguing\ndifference, between matrix and higher rank tensor models, in the computational\ncomplexity of superficially comparable correlators of observables parametrized\nby Young diagrams.\n", "  We present the results of an expanded, long-term radial velocity search (25\nyrs) for evidence of binarity in a sample of seven bright proto-planetary\nnebulae (PPNe). The goal is to investigate the widely-held view that the\nbipolar or point-symmetric shapes of planetary nebulae (PNe) and PPNe are due\nto binary interactions. Observations from three observatories were combined\nfrom 2007-2015 to search for variations on the order of a few years and then\ncombined with earlier observations from 1991-1995 to search for variations on\nthe order of decades. All seven show velocity variations due to periodic\npulsation in the range of 35-135 days. However, in only one PPN, IRAS\n22272+5435, did we find even marginal evidence found for multi-year variations\nthat might be due to a binary companion. This object shows\nmarginally-significant evidence of a two-year period of low semi-amplitude\nwhich could be due to a low-mass companion, and it also displays some evidence\nof a much longer period of >30 years. The absence of evidence in the other six\nobjects for long-period radial velocity variations due to a binary companion\nsets significant constraints on the properties of any undetected binary\ncompanions: they must be of low mass, <0.2 M(sun), or long period, >30 years.\nThus the present observations do not provide direct support for the binary\nhypothesis to explain the shapes of PNe and PPNe and severely constrains the\nproperties of any such undetected companions.\n", "  We identify rotations of the polarization angle in a sample of blazars\nobserved for three seasons with the RoboPol instrument. A simplistic stochastic\nvariability model is tested against this sample of rotation events. The model\nis capable of producing samples of rotations with parameters similar to the\nobserved ones, but fails to reproduce the polarization fraction at the same\ntime. Even though we can neither accept nor conclusively reject the model, we\npoint out various aspects of the observations that are fully consistent with a\nrandom walk process.\n", "  Two-time correlation functions of a system of Bose particles are studied. We\nfind relation of zeros of the correlation functions with the Lee-Yang zeros of\npartition function of the system. Obtained relation gives the possibility to\nobserve the Lee-Yang zeros experimentally. A particular case of Bose particles\non two levels is examined and zeros of two-time correlation functions and\nLee-Yang zeros of partition function of the system are analyzed.\n", "  We developed a new variational method for tensor-optimized antisymmetrized\nmolecular dynamics (TOAMD) for nuclei. In TOAMD, the correlation functions for\nthe tensor force and the short-range repulsion are introduced and used in the\npower series form of the wave function, which is different from the Jastrow\nmethod. Here, nucleon pairs are correlated in multi-steps with different forms,\nwhile they are correlated only once including all pairs in the Jastrow\ncorrelation method. Each correlation function in every term is independently\noptimized in the variation of total energy in TOAMD. For $s$-shell nuclei using\nthe nucleon-nucleon interaction, the energies in TOAMD are better than those in\nthe variational Monte Carlo method with the Jastrow correlation function. This\nmeans that the power series expansion using the correlation functions in TOAMD\ndescribes the nuclei better than the Jastrow correlation method.\n", "  Near 20.48K and in the temperature range 60--70K, anomalous behavior of\nthermodynamic, spectral, plastic, elastic and other properties of solid methane\nis observed. The anomalies in the vicinity of 20.48K are due to the phase\n$\\alpha-\\beta$ transition. Anomalies in a relatively wide range of 60--70K are\nshown to be related to the essentially quantum nature of the collective\nrotation of methane molecules. The provided analysis of the high-temperature\nanomalies encompasses a more extensive set of phenomena in comparison with the\nlow-temperature ones.\n  Key words: solid methane, anomalies of physical properties, phase transition,\nrotational temperature, quantum-classical transition.\n", "  The prime objective is to settle a contradiction between a high\nnongravitational acceleration affecting the orbital motion of comet C/1995 O1\nand its enormous nucleus by modeling it as a compact cluster of boulder-sized\nfragments held together by its own gravity. The nongravitational effect is\ninterpreted as a perturbation of the cluster's principal, most massive\nfragment. This and other constraints suggest that the principal fragment was\nprobably 8-9 km across and the entire cluster ~150 times less massive than a\nsingle-body nucleus of an equal cross-sectional area derived from the Herschel\nfar-infrared photometry of the inactive comet detected near 30 AU from the Sun.\nThe cross-sectional area required the smallest fragments to be a few tens of\nmeters across under a steady-state distribution. The cluster was at most ~200\nkm in diameter, subject to frequent collisions and significant perturbations by\nthe Sun near perihelion, and apparently a product of tidal fragmentation of the\noriginal nucleus, more than 20 km across, at the time of close encounter with\nJupiter 4 millennia ago, if the comet's tensile strength was then as low as\nseveral Pa. Published for the first time are the results of a search for\ncompanion nuclei in three post-perihelion images taken with the HST's STIS\ninstrument in 1997-1998. At least 29 such objects <1200 km (projected) from the\nprimary were detected, with their signals from 2.3% to 25% of the primary's and\nthe signal-to-noise ratios between 5:1 and 29:1, apparently also cluster-like\nin nature.\n", "  Diamond is a promising platform for the development of technological\napplications in quantum optics and photonics. The quest for color centers with\noptimal photo-physical properties has led in recent years to the search for\nnovel impurity-related defects in this material. Here, we report on a\nsystematic investigation of the photo-physical properties of two He-related\n(HR) emission lines at 535 nm and 560 nm created in three different diamond\nsubstrates upon implantation with 1.3 MeV He+ ions and subsequent annealing.\nThe spectral features of the HR centers were studied in an \"optical grade\"\ndiamond substrate as a function of several physical parameters, namely the\nmeasurement temperature, the excitation wavelength and the intensity of\nexternal electric fields. The emission lifetimes of the 535 nm and 560 nm lines\nwere also measured by means of time-gated photoluminescence measurements,\nyielding characteristic decay times of (29 +- 5) ns and (106 +- 10) ns,\nrespectively. The Stark shifting of the HR centers under the application of an\nexternal electrical field was observed in a CVD diamond film equipped with\nburied graphitic electrodes, suggesting a lack of inversion symmetry in the\ndefects' structure. Furthermore, the photoluminescence mapping under 405 nm\nexcitation of a \"detector grade\" diamond sample implanted at a 1x1010 cm-2 He+\nion fluence enabled to identify the spectral features of both the HR emission\nlines from the same localized optical spots. The reported results provide a\nfirst insight towards the understanding of the structure of He-related defects\nin diamond and their possible utilization in practical applications\n", "  By using a holographic method we study a relation between the thermal\ndiffusivity ($D_T$) and two quantum chaotic properties, Lyapunov time\n($\\tau_L$) and butterfly velocity ($v_B$) in strongly correlated systems. It\nhas been shown that $D_T/(v_B^2 \\tau_L)$ is universal in some holographic\nmodels as well as condensed matter systems including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev\n(SYK) models. We investigate to what extent this relation is universal in the\nQ-lattice models with infrared (IR) scaling geometry, focusing on the effect of\nspatial anisotropy. Indeed it was shown that $\\mathcal{E}_i :=\nD_{T,i}/(v_{B,i}^2 \\tau_L)$ ($i=x,y$) is determined only by some scaling\nexponents of the IR metric in the low temperature limit regardless of the\nmatter fields and ultraviolet data. Inspired by this observation, in this work,\nwe find the concrete expressions for $\\mathcal{E}_i$ in terms of the critical\ndynamical exponents $z_i$ in each direction. By analyzing the IR scaling\ngeometry we identify the allowed scaling parameter regimes, which enable us to\ncompute the allowed range of $\\mathcal{E}_i$. We find the lower bound of\n$\\mathcal{E}_i$ is always $1/2$, which is not affected by anisotropy, contrary\nto the $\\eta/s$ case. However, there may be an upper bound determined by\nanisotropy.\n", "  Using first principles calculations, we studied a new class of graphdiyne\nnanoribbons (GDYNR) with open hexagonal rings on the edges.To avoid the effects\nfrom dangling bond, hydrogen or oxygen atoms were absorbed on the edges. There\nare two kinds of GDYNR depending on the edge structures, armchair and zigzag.\nThe electronic structures show that all of them are semiconductors. The band\ngap can be tuned by the width of GDYNR. As the width of nanoribbons increases,\nthe energy gap decreases firstly and then increases, and reaches a minimum gap\nfor both kinds. To understand the intriguing phenomenon, we constructed a\ntight-binding model for GDYNR and found that the existence of the minimum of\nthe energy gap is due to the competition between the interaction within the two\nedges and the coupling in between. Furthermore, topological unprotected edge\nstates are found in the band structure of a semi-infinite system by calculating\nsurface Green's function. If GDYNR could be synthesized in experiments, it\nwould be useful for the nanodevices in the future.\n", "  We present the first dedicated observations of Interplanetary Scintillation\n(IPS) with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). We have developed a synthesis\nimaging technique, tailored to the properties of modern \"large-N\" low-frequency\nradio telescopes. This allows us to image the variability on IPS timescales\nacross 900 square degrees simultaneously. We show that for our observations, a\nsampling rate of just 2Hz is sufficient to resolve the IPS signature of most\nsources. We develop tests to ensure that IPS variability is separated from\nionospheric or instrumental variability. We validate our results by comparison\nwith existing catalogues of IPS sources, and near-contemporaneous observations\nby other IPS facilities. Using just five minutes of data, we produce catalogues\nat both 79MHz and 158MHz, each containing over 350 scintillating sources. At\nthe field centre we detect approximately one scintillating source per square\ndegree, with a minimum scintillating flux density at 158MHz of 110mJy,\ncorresponding to a compact flux density of approximately 400mJy. Each of these\nsources is a known radio source, however only a minority were previously known\nto contain sub-arcsecond components. We discuss our findings and the prospects\nthey hold for future astrophysical and heliospheric studies.\n", "  Maxwell's equations incorporating thermoelectric and thermomagnetic effects\nare studied. Energy transport involving electric field only flows along the\nvelocity direction and a direction perpendicular to it. Magnetic energy\ntransport associated with magnetic field only is found to flow along the\nvelocity direction and a direction normal to it. The temperature is transmitted\nlike an electromagnetic wave traveling at the speed of light. Thermoelectric\nand thermomagnetic polarizations are induced in the medium that are directly\nproportional to the temperature. An electronic transport due to temperature\nvariations only and without electric or magnetic field is found to be\naccessible. Electric and magnetic fields due to temperature gradient are shown\nto arise provided the photon is massive.\n", "  VSe2 is a transition metal dichaclogenide which has a charge-density wave\ntransition that has been well studied. We report on a low-temperature upturn in\nthe resistivity and, at temperatures below this resistivity minimum, an unusual\nmagnetoresistance which is negative at low fields and positive at higher\nfields, in single crystals of VSe2. The negative magnetoresistance has a\nparabolic dependence on the magnetic field and shows little angular dependence.\nThe magnetoresistance at temperatures above the resistivity minimum is always\npositive. We interpret these results as signatures of the Kondo effect in VSe2.\nAn upturn in the susceptibility indicates the presence of interlayer V ions\nwhich can provide the localized magnetic moments required for scattering the\nconduction electrons in the Kondo effect. The low-temperature behaviour of the\nheat capacity, including a high value of gamma, along with a deviation from a\nCurie-Weiss law observed in the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, are\nconsistent with the presence of magnetic interactions between the paramagnetic\ninterlayer V ions and a Kondo screening of these V moments.\n", "  We study the pointwise (in the space and time variables) behavior of the\nlinearized Landau equation for hard and moderately soft potentials. The\nsolution has very clear description in the $(x,t)-$variables, including large\ntime behavior and asymptotic behavior. More precisely, we obtain the pointwise\nfluid structure inside finite Mach number region, and exponential or\nsub-exponential decay, depending on interactions between particles, in the\nspace variable outside finite Mach number region. The spectrum analysis,\nregularization effect and refined weighted energy estimate play important roles\nin this paper.\n", "  The workshop on Parton Distributions and Lattice Calculations in the LHC era\n(PDFLattice2017) was hosted at Balliol College, Oxford (UK), from 22$^{\\rm nd}$\nto 24$^{\\rm th}$ March 2017. The workshop brought together the lattice-QCD and\nthe global-fit physicists who devote their efforts to determine the parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. The goals were to make the two\ncommunities more familiar between each other, review developments from both\nsides, and set precision targets for lattice calculations so that they can\ncontribute, together with the forthcoming experimental input, to the next\ngeneration of PDF determinations. This contribution summarises the relevant\noutcome of the workshop, in anticipation of a thorough white paper.\n", "  This article explains how to apply the computer algebra package GAP\n(www.gap-system.org) in the computation of the problems in quantum physics, in\nwhich the application of Lie algebra is necessary. The article contains several\nexemplary computations which readers would follow in the desktop PC: such as,\nthe brief review of elementary ideas of Lie algebra, the angular momentum in\nquantum mechanics, the quark eight-fold way model, and the usage of Weyl\ncharacter formula (in order to construct weight modules, and to count correctly\nthe degeneracy).\n  This short article is a complement to the article \"Computer Algebra and\nMaterial Design\" [arXiv:1612.02275] by one of the authors (A.K.). The latter\narticle is also available in the arXiv.\n", "  Analysis and quantification of brain structural changes, using Magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI), are increasingly used to define novel biomarkers of\nbrain pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Network-based models of\nthe brain have shown that both local and global topological properties can\nreveal patterns of disease propagation. On the other hand, intra-subject\ndescriptions cannot exploit the whole information context, accessible through\ninter-subject comparisons. To address this, we developed a novel approach,\nwhich models brain structural connectivity atrophy with a multiplex network and\nsummarizes it within a classification score. On an independent dataset\nmultiplex networks were able to correctly segregate, from normal controls (NC),\nAD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment that will convert to AD\n(cMCI) with an accuracy of, respectively, $0.86 \\pm 0.01$ and $0.84 \\pm 0.01$.\nThe model also shows that illness effects are maximally detected by parceling\nthe brain in equal volumes of $3000$ $mm^3$ (\"patches\"), without any $a$\n$priori$ segmentation based on anatomical features. A direct comparison to\nstandard voxel-based morphometry on the same dataset showed that the multiplex\nnetwork approach had higher sensitivity. This method is general and can have\ntwofold potential applications: providing a reliable tool for clinical trials\nand a disease signature of neurodegenerative pathologies.\n", "  I propose the 1D Subgrid Method for calculating fluid exchange between\nfractures and matrix with a non-conforming mesh. The method is demonstrated on\nlinear and radial flow problems. The method has negligible computational cost\nand is accurate at all levels of mesh refinement.\n", "  These proceedings report on lepton and photon performance results obtained\nusing data recorded in 2015 and 2016 at the LHC by the two experiments ATLAS\nand CMS. For each particle (electrons, photons and muons), the reconstruction\nand identification efficiencies are presented for the two experiments together\nwith the isolation studies. Results concerning the electron and photon energy\ncalibration as well as the muon momentum scale and resolution are also\nreported. Despite more challenging pile-up conditions with respect to Run 1,\nthe two experiments achieved impressive performance in early Run 2.\n", "  In this article, we are interested in a spin model including the quantized\nelectromagnetic field (photons). With this model of quantum electrodynamics\n(QED) related to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) we give explicit quantum\nradiative corrections of the time evolution for the spin observables, for the\nelectric and magnetic fields observables and for the photon number observable.\nAs a by-product, this underlines that Bloch equations are the semiclassical\nlimit of the model in QED considered here. In addition, transition\nprobabilities for the same model are investigated.\n", "  We present a connection between the physics of cosmological time evolution\nand the mathematics of positive geometries, roughly analogous to similar\nconnections seen in the context of scattering amplitudes. We consider the\nwavefunction of the universe in a class of toy models of conformally coupled\nscalars (with non-conformal interactions) in FRW cosmologies. The contribution\nof each Feynman diagram to the wavefunction of the universe is associated with\na certain universal rational integrand, which we identify as the canonical form\nof a \"cosmological polytope\", which have an independent, intrinsic definition,\nmaking no reference to physics. The singularity structure of the wavefunction\nfor this model of scalars is common to all theories, and is geometrized by the\ncosmological polytope. Natural triangulations of the polytope reproduce the\npath-integral and \"old-fashioned perturbation theory\" representations of the\nwavefunction, and we also find new representations of the wavefunction with no\nextant physical interpretation. We show in suitable examples how symmetries of\nthe cosmological polytope descend to symmetries of the wavefunction, (such as\nconformal invariance). In cases such as $\\phi^3$ theory in $dS_4$, the final\nwavefunction obtained from integration of the rational functions gives rise to\npolylogarithms associated with every graph. We give an explicit expression for\nthe symbol of these polylogs, which record the geometry of sequential\nprojections of the cosmological polytope.\n", "  We construct an action for the composite Dirac fermion consistent with\nsymmetries of electrons projected to the lowest Landau level. First we\nconstruct a generalization of the $g=2$ electron that gives a smooth massless\nlimit on any curved background. Using the symmetries of the microscopic\nelectron theory in this massless limit we find a number of constraints on any\nlow-energy effective theory. We find that any low-energy description must\ncouple to a geometry which exhibits nontrivial curvature even on flat\nspace-times. Any composite fermion must have an electric dipole moment\nproportional and orthogonal to the composite fermion's wavevector. We construct\nthe effective action for the composite Dirac fermion and calculate the physical\nstress tensor and current operators for this theory.\n", "  We discuss the period geometry and the topological string amplitudes on\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds in toric ambient spaces. In\nparticular, we describe a general procedure to fix integral periods. Using some\nelementary facts from homological mirror symmetry we then obtain Bridgelands\ninvolution and its monodromy action on the integral basis for non-singular\nelliptically fibered fourfolds. The full monodromy group contains a subgroup\nthat acts as PSL(2,Z) on the K\\\"ahler modulus of the fiber and we analyze the\nconsequences of this modularity for the genus zero and genus one amplitudes as\nwell as the associated geometric invariants. We find holomorphic anomaly\nequations for the amplitudes, reflecting precisely the failure of exact\nPSL(2,Z) invariance that relates them to quasi-modular forms. Finally we use\nthe integral basis of periods to study the horizontal flux superpotential and\nthe leading order K\\\"ahler potential for the moduli fields in F-theory\ncompactifications globally on the complex structure moduli space. For a\nparticular example we verify attractor behaviour at the generic conifold given\nan aligned choice of flux which we expect to be universal. Furthermore we\nanalyze the superpotential at the orbifold points but find no stable vacua.\n", "  We discuss a quantum-statistical feature of non-relativistic identical\nfermions whose interaction is predominantly attractive at low energies.\nSpecifically, we consider exotic, multi-neutron nuclei. From the enhancement of\nan arbitrarily small P-wave interaction between two nucleons, we infer the\nexistence of a particle-stable nucleus composed entirely of neutrons. While we\ncannot specify the number of neutrons in the system, we predict that none of\nits substructures is bound. The independence of this deduction from the\nshort-distance structure of the nuclear interaction and its consistency with\ndeuteron, triton, and helium-4 properties is established.\n", "  BL Lacertae is the prototype of the blazar subclass known as BL Lac type\nobjects. BL Lacertae object itself is a low-frequency-peaked BL Lac(LBL). Very\nhigh energy (VHE) gamma ray emission from this source was discovered in 2005 by\nMAGIC observatory while the source was at a flaring state. Since then, VHE\ngamma rays from this source has been detected several times. However, all of\nthose times the source was in a high activity state. Former studies suggest\nseveral non-thermal zones emitting in gamma-rays, then gamma-ray flare should\nbe composed of a convolution. Observing the BL Lacertae object at quiescent\nstates and active states is the key to disentangle these two components.\nVERITAS is monitoring the BL Lacertae object since 2011. The archival data set\nincludes observations during flaring and quiescent states. This presentation\nreports on the preliminary results of the VERITAS observation between January\n2013 - December 2015, and simultaneous multiwavelength observations.\n", "  The strong force is responsible for a rich set of phenomena that can be\nprobed using a variety of techniques over a wide energy and angular range at\nthe Large Hadron Collider. This talk reports on the latest results from the\nATLAS Collaboration that measure the high energy, wide angle, collinear, and\nsoft regimes of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). There is also an important\nconnection between QCD at high energies and electroweak phenomena including\nmassive gauge bosons as well as photons.\n", "  Recent and influential critiques of standardized testing have noted the\nexistence of non-trivial numbers of successful scientists who received low\nscores on the GRE. Here we use computer simulations to show that the prevalence\nof such examples is consistent with the reasonable hypothesis that academic\nperformance depends on multiple variables. We examine the effects of admissions\ncriteria on the observed predictive power of different variables, and show that\nobserved correlations between student performance and student characteristics\ndepend as much on the method of selecting students as on causal relationships\ndetectable in the wider applicant pool. This is an example of the well-known\nstatistical phenomenon of range restriction, and we offer relevant caveats and\nrecommendations for further studies of admissions tests. We also show that the\nmagnitude of range restriction effects depend on how student characteristics\nare weighted in admissions decisions.\n", "  We have calculated the shear viscosity of pion medium, where propagating pion\nhas some finite thermal width due to interaction with the low mass resonances,\n$\\sigma$ and $\\rho$. With the help of standard thermal field theoretical\ntechnique, the thermal width of the pion has been calculated from the pion\nself-energy diagram for $\\pi\\sigma$ and $\\pi\\rho$ loops, where an effective\nLagrangian density has been used for interaction part. We have found a very\nsmall value of shear viscosity by entropy density ratio ($\\eta/s$), which is\nvery close to the KSS bound.\n", "  Molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) provides a simple but powerful way to synthesize\nlarge-area high-quality thin films and heterostructures of a wide variety of\nmaterials including accomplished group III-V and II-VI semiconductors as well\nas newly-developing oxides and chalcogenides, leading to major discoveries in\ncondensed-matter physics. For two-dimensional (2D) materials, however, main\nfabrication routes have been mechanical exfoliation and chemical-vapor\ndeposition by making good use of weak van der Waals bonding nature between\nneighboring layers, and MBE growth of 2D materials, in particular on insulating\nsubstrates for transport measurements, has been limited despite its fundamental\nimportance for future advanced research. Here we report layer-by-layer\nepitaxial growth of scalable transition-metal dichalocogenide (TMDC) thin films\non insulating substrates by MBE, and demonstrate ambipolar transistor\noperation. The proposed growth protocol is broadly applicable to other TMDC,\nproviding a key milestone toward fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures\nwith various 2D materials for novel properties and functionalities.\n", "  Thin film solid state lithium-based batteries (TSSBs) are increasingly\nattractive for their intrinsic safety due to the use of a nonflammable solid\nelectrolyte, cycling stability, and ability to be easily patterned in small\nform factors. However, existing methods for fabricating TSSBs are limited to\nplanar geometries, which severely limits areal energy density when the\nelectrodes are kept sufficiently thin to achieve high areal power. In order to\ncircumvent this limitation, we report the first successful fabrication of fully\nconformal, 3D full cell TSSBs formed in micromachined silicon substrates with\naspect ratios up to ~10 using atomic layer deposition (ALD) at low processing\ntemperatures (at or below 250C) to deposit all active battery components. The\ncells utilize a prelithiated LiV$_2$O$_5$ cathode, a very thin (40 - 100 nm)\nLiPON-like lithium polyphosphazene (Li$_2$PO$_2$N) solid electrolyte, and a\nSnN$_x$ conversion anode, along with Ru and TiN current collectors. Planar\nall-ALD solid state cells deliver 37 {\\mu}Ah/cm$^2${\\mu}m normalized to the\ncathode thickness with only 0.02% per-cycle capacity loss for hundreds of\ncycles. Fabrication of full cells in 3D substrates increases the areal\ndischarge capacity by up to a factor of 9.3x while simultaneously improving the\nrate performance, which corresponds well to trends identified by finite element\nsimulations of the cathode film. This work shows that the exceptional\nconformality of ALD, combined with conventional semiconductor fabrication\nmethods, provides an avenue for the successful realization of long-sought 3D\nTSSBs which provide power performance scaling in regimes inaccessible to planar\nform factor devices.\n", "  The Lorentz force law of classical electrodynamics states that the force F\nexerted by the magnetic induction B on a particle of charge q moving with\nvelocity V is given by F=qVxB. Since this force is orthogonal to the direction\nof motion, the magnetic field is said to be incapable of performing mechanical\nwork. Yet there is no denying that a permanent magnet can readily perform\nmechanical work by pushing/pulling on another permanent magnet -- or by\nattracting pieces of magnetizable material such as scrap iron or iron filings.\nWe explain this apparent contradiction by examining the magnetic Lorentz force\nacting on an Amperian current loop, which is the model for a magnetic dipole.\nWe then extend the discussion by analyzing the Einstein-Laub model of magnetic\ndipoles in the presence of external magnetic fields.\n", "  The observational evidence for the recent acceleration of the universe\ndemonstrates that canonical theories of cosmology and particle physics are\nincomplete---if not incorrect---and that new physics is out there, waiting to\nbe discovered. A key task for the next generation of laboratory and\nastrophysical facilities is to search for, identify and ultimately characterize\nthis new physics. Here we highlight recent developments in tests of the\nstability of nature's fundamental couplings, which provide a direct handle on\nnew physics: a detection of variations will be revolutionary, but even improved\nnull results provide competitive constraints on a range of cosmological and\nparticle physics paradigms. A joint analysis of all currently available data\nshows a preference for variations of $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ at about the two-sigma\nlevel, but inconsistencies between different sub-sets (likely due to hidden\nsystematics) suggest that these statistical preferences need to be taken with\ncaution. On the other hand, these measurements strongly constrain Weak\nEquivalence Principle violations. Plans and forecasts for forthcoming studies\nwith facilities such as ALMA, ESPRESSO and the ELT, which should clarify these\nissues, are also discussed, and synergies with other probes are briefly\nhighlighted. The goal is to show how a new generation of precision consistency\ntests of the standard paradigm will soon become possible.\n", "  We consider an expression for the supercurrent in the superconformal\nformulation of N=1 supergravity. A chiral compensator provides the\nsupersymmetric formulation of the Callan-Coleman-Jackiw (CCJ) improved stress\nenergy tensor, when the conformal gauge is used. Superconformal and\nnon-superconformal matter give different conservation laws of the supercurrent,\nwhen coupled to the curvature supermultiplets which underlie the local\nsuperspace geometry. This approach can be applied to any set of auxiliary\nfields and it is useful to classify rigid curved superspace geometries.\nExamples with four supersymmetries are briefly described.\n", "  The Neo-Deterministic Seismic Hazard Assessment (NDSHA) method reliably and\nrealistically simulates the suite of earthquake ground motions that may impact\ncivil populations as well as their heritage buildings. The modeling technique\nis developed from comprehensive physical knowledge of the seismic source\nprocess, the propagation of earthquake waves and their combined interactions\nwith site effects. NDSHA effectively accounts for the tensor nature of\nearthquake ground motions formally described as the tensor product of the\nearthquake source functions and the Green Functions of the pathway. NDSHA uses\nall available information about the space distribution of large magnitude\nearthquake, including Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) and geological and\ngeophysical data. It does not rely on scalar empirical ground motion\nattenuation models, as these are often both weakly constrained by available\nobservations and unable to account for the tensor nature of earthquake ground\nmotion. Standard NDSHA provides robust and safely conservative hazard estimates\nfor engineering design and mitigation decision strategies without requiring\n(often faulty) assumptions about the probabilistic risk analysis model of\nearthquake occurrence. If specific applications may benefit from temporal\ninformation the definition of the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) relation is performed\naccording to the multi-scale seismicity model and occurrence rate is associated\nto each modeled source. Observations from recent destructive earthquakes in\nItaly and Nepal have confirmed the validity of NDSHA approach and application,\nand suggest that more widespread application of NDSHA will enhance earthquake\nsafety and resilience of civil populations in all earthquake-prone regions,\nespecially in tectonically active areas where the historic earthquake record is\ntoo short.\n", "  Individuals often develop reluctance to change their social relations, called\n\"secondary homebody\", even though their interactions with their environment\nevolve with time. Some memory effect is loosely present deforcing changes. In\nother words, in presence of memory, relations do not change easily. In order to\ninvestigate some history or memory effect on social networks, we introduce a\ntemporal kernel function into the Heider conventional balance theory, allowing\nfor the \"quality\" of past relations to contribute to the evolution of the\nsystem. This memory effect is shown to lead to the emergence of aged networks,\nthereby perfectly describing and the more so measuring the aging process of\nlinks (\"social relations\"). It is shown that such a memory does not change the\ndynamical attractors of the system, but does prolong the time necessary to\nreach the \"balanced states\". The general trend goes toward obtaining either\nglobal (\"paradise\" or \"bipolar\") or local (\"jammed\") balanced states, but is\nprofoundly affected by aged relations. The resistance of elder links against\nchanges decelerates the evolution of the system and traps it into so named\nglassy states. In contrast to balance\n", "  An incremental wave superimposed on a pre-deformed hyper-elastic material\nperceives an elastic media with the instantaneous modulus of the current\nmaterial. This offers a new route with a broadband feature to control elastic\nwaves by purposely creating finite deformation field. This study proves that\nthe governing equation of a semi-linear material under a symmetric\npre-deformation condition maintains the form invariance for longitudinal wave,\nso the longitudinal wave control can be made by transformation method without\nthe constraint condition on principle stretches, but this is not the case for\nshear waves. Therefore pre-deforming a semi-linear material provides a\npotential method for treating longitudinal and shear waves differently.\nExamples with elastic wave control and band structure shift through\npre-deforming a semi-linear material are provided to illustrate this finding.\nFinally, a one-dimensional spring lattice is proposed to mimic a semi-linear\nmaterial, and the dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in a sandwich\nstructure with such spring lattice is shown to be invariant during elongation,\nconfirming the result found based on a homogeneous semi-linear material. These\nresults may stimulate researches on designing new hyper-elastic microstructures\nas well as designing new devices based on pre-deformed hyper-elastic materials.\n", "  In many social complex systems, in which agents are linked by non-linear\ninteractions, the history of events strongly influences the whole network\ndynamics. However, a class of \"commonly accepted beliefs\" seems rarely studied.\nIn this paper, we examine how the growth process of a (social) network is\ninfluenced by past circumstances. In order to tackle this cause, we simply\nmodify the well known preferential attachment mechanism by imposing a time\ndependent kernel function in the network evolution equation. This approach\nleads to a fractional order Barabasi-Albert (BA) differential equation,\ngeneralizing the BA model. Our results show that, with passing time, an aging\nprocess is observed for the network dynamics. The aging process leads to a\ndecay for the node degree values, thereby creating an opposing process to the\npreferential attachment mechanism. On one hand, based on the preferential\nattachment mechanism, nodes with a high degree are more likely to absorb links;\nbut, on the other hand, a node's age has a reduced chance for new connections.\nThis competitive scenario allows an increased chance for younger members to\nbecome a hub. Simulations of such a network growth with aging constraint\nconfirm the results found from solving the fractional BA equation. We also\nreport, as an exemplary application, an investigation of the collaboration\nnetwork between Hollywood movie actors. It is undubiously shown that a decay in\nthe dynamics of their collaboration rate is found, - even including a sex\ndifference. Such findings suggest a widely universal application of the so\ngeneralized BA model.\n", "  Energetic electromagnetic emissions by astrophysical jets like those that are\nlaunched during the collapse of a massive star and trigger gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) are partially attributed to relativistic internal shocks. The shocks are\nmediated in the collisionless plasma of such jets by the filamentation\ninstability of counterstreaming particle beams. The filamentation instability\ngrows fastest only if the beams move at a relativistic relative speed. We model\nhere with a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation the collision of two cold pair\nclouds at the speed c/2 (c: speed of light). We demonstrate that the two-stream\ninstability outgrows the filamentation instability for this speed and is thus\nresponsible for the shock formation. The incomplete thermalization of the\nupstream plasma by its quasi-electrostatic waves allows other instabilities to\ngrow. A shock transition layer forms, in which a filamentation instability\nmodulates the plasma far upstream of the shock. The inflowing upstream plasma\nis progressively heated by a two-stream instability closer to the shock and\ncompressed to the expected downstream density by the Weibel instability. The\nstrong magnetic field due to the latter is confined to a layer 10 electron skin\ndepths wide.\n", "  The effect of heat treatment on the structural and micro-structural\nproperties of the Co2-Y (Ba2Co2Fe12O22) was investigated by means of X-ray\ndiffraction and the Rietveld refinement. The samples were synthesized using\nhigh-energy ball milling technique. Phase identification and Rietveld\nrefinement of the samples confirmed the presence of a single Y-type phase that\nis consistent with reported patterns. Analysis of the lattice constants\nobtained using the Rietveld refinement confirmed the presence of inner\ndistortion, which was responsible for increasing the lattice constants.\nHowever, after the heat treatment, the lattice constants were in good agreement\nwith the reported pattern. The structural analysis using quadratic elongation\nrevealed distortions in the crystal structure. The structural analysis revealed\nsome differences in the cation-anion distances in some sites, while in other\nsites, these distances remained the same. The use of the Rietveld refinement to\nobtain micro-structural information about the size and the strain was reported.\nHeat treatment induced diffusion between crystal domains leading to an increase\nin crystallite size.\n", "  Expression for the probability of the spontaneous emission of high-order\nharmonics when the emitter phases are synchronized and are obtained in the\nregion where the multiphoton approximation is applicable to the description of\nthe ionization of an atom (where the adiabaticity parameter satisfies gamma >\n1). The dependence of this probability on the main parameters of the pump wave\nand the atomic medium is established. Criteria for observing emission are\nformulated with the consideration of phase locking.\n", "  We present a superconducting noise bolometer for terahertz radiation, which\nis suitable for large-format arrays. It is based on an antenna-coupled\nsuperconducting micro-bridge embedded in a high-quality factor superconducting\nresonator for a microwave bias and readout with frequency-division multiplexing\nin the GHz range. The micro-bridge is kept below its critical temperature and\nbiased with a microwave current of slightly lower amplitude than the critical\ncurrent of the micro-bridge. The response of the detector is the rate of\nsuperconducting fluctuations, which depends exponentially on the concentration\nof quasiparticles in the micro-bridge. Excess quasiparticles are generated by\nan incident THz signal. Since the quasiparticle lifetime increases\nexponentially at lower operation temperature, the noise equivalent power\nrapidly decreases. This approach allows for large arrays of noise bolometers\noperating above 1 K with sensitivity, limited by 300-K background noise.\nMoreover, the response of the bolometer always dominates the noise of the\nreadout due to relatively large amplitude of the bias current. We performed a\nfeasibility study on a proof-of-concept device with a ${1.0\\times 0.5 \\rm \\mu\nm^{2}}$ micro-bridge from a 9-nm thin Nb film on a sapphire substrate. Having a\ncritical temperature of 5.8 K, it operates at 4.2 K and is biased at the\nfrequency 5.6 GHz. For the quasioptical input at 0.65 THz, we measured the\nnoise equivalent power ${\\approx 3\\times 10^{-12}\\rm W/\\sqrt Hz}$ , which is\nclose to expectations for this particular device in the noise-response regime.\n", "  Comprehensive line lists for phosphorus monoxide ($^{31}$P$^{16}$O) and\nphosphorus monosulphide ($^{31}$P$^{32}$S) in their $X$ $^2\\Pi$ electronic\nground state are presented. The line lists are based on new ab initio potential\nenergy (PEC), spin-orbit (SOC) and dipole moment (DMC) curves computed using\nthe MRCI+Q-r method with aug-cc-pwCV5Z and aug-cc-pV5Z basis sets. The nuclear\nmotion equations (i.e. the rovibronic Schr\\\"odinger equations for each\nmolecule) are solved using the program Duo. The PECs and SOCs are refined in\nleast-squares fits to available experimental data. Partition functions, $Q(T)$,\nare computed up to $T=$ 5000 K, the range of validity of the line lists. These\nline lists are the most comprehensive available for either molecule. The\ncharacteristically sharp peak of the $Q$-branches from the spin-orbit split\ncomponents give useful diagnostics for both PO and PS in spectra at infrared\nwavelengths. These line lists should prove useful for analysing observations\nand setting up models of environments such as brown dwarfs, low-mass stars,\nO-rich circumstellar regions and potentially for exoplanetary retrievals. Since\nPS is yet to be detected in space, the role of the two lowest excited\nelectronic states ($a$ $^4\\Pi$ and $B$ $^2\\Pi$) are also considered. An\napproximate line list for the PS $X - B$ electronic transition, which predicts\na number of sharp vibrational bands in the near ultraviolet, is also presented.\nhe line lists are available from the CDS (cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr) and ExoMol\n(www.exomol.com) databases.\n", "  Construction and diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix is the\nrate-limiting step in most low-energy electron -- molecule collision\ncalculations. Tennyson (J Phys B, 29 (1996) 1817) implemented a novel algorithm\nfor Hamiltonian construction which took advantage of the structure of the\nwavefunction in such calculations. This algorithm is re-engineered to make use\nof modern computer architectures and the use of appropriate diagonalizers is\nconsidered. Test calculations demonstrate that significant speed-ups can be\ngained using multiple CPUs. This opens the way to calculations which consider\nhigher collision energies, larger molecules and / or more target states. The\nmethodology, which is implemented as part of the UK molecular R-matrix codes\n(UKRMol and UKRMol+) can also be used for studies of bound molecular Rydberg\nstates, photoionisation and positron-molecule collisions.\n", "  In 2016, the Large Hadron Collider provided proton-proton collisions at 13\nTeV center-of-mass energy and achieved very high luminosity and reliability.\nThe performance of the CMS Experiment in this running period and a selection of\nrecent physics results are presented. These include precision measurements and\nsearches for new particles. The status and prospects for data-taking in 2017\nand a brief summary of the highlights of the High Luminosity (HL-LHC) upgrade\nof the CMS detector are also presented.\n", "  The transformation from evanescent waves to propagation waves is the key\nmechanism for the realization of some super-resolution imaging methods. By\nusing the recursive Green function and scattering-matrix theory, we\ninvestigated in details on the transport of evanescent waves through a random\nmedium and analyzed quantitatively the coupling of evanescent channels to\npropagation channels. By numerical calculations, we found that the transmission\nfor the incident evanescent channel is determined by both the eigenvalues of\nthe scattering matrix and the coupling strength to the corresponding\npropagation channels in random medium, and the disorder strength of the random\nmedium influences both of them.\n", "  We report on the measurement of the decay $B\\to K^{\\star}\\gamma$,\nlepton-flavor dependent angular analysis of the decay $B\\to K^{\\star}\\ell\\ell$,\nand search for the decays $B\\to h\\nu\\nu$. All these analyses are performed on\nthe 711 $fb^{-1}$ data sample recorded by the Belle detector at the\n$\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance.\n", "  We report the single crystal growth and characterization of the highest Tc\niron-based superconductor SmFeAsO1-xHx. Some sub-millimeter-sized crystals were\ngrown using the mixture flux of Na3As + 3NaH + As at 3.0 GPa and 1473 K. The\nchemical composition analyses confirmed 10% substitution of hydrogen for the\noxygen site (x = 0.10), however, the structural analyses suggested that the\nobtained crystal forms a multi-domain structure. By using the FIB technique we\nfabricated the single domain SmFeAsO0.9H0.10 crystal with the Tc of 42 K, and\nrevealed the metallic conduction in in-plane (rhoab), while semiconducting in\nthe out-of-plane (rhoc). From the in-plane Hall coefficient measurements, we\nconfirmed that the dominant carrier of SmFeAsO0.9H0.10 crystal is an electron,\nand the hydride ion occupied at the site of the oxygen ion effectively supplies\na carrier electron per iron following the equation: O2- = H- + e-.\n", "  We develop new angular momentum evolution models for stars with masses of\n$0.5$ to $1.6~\\rm M_\\odot$ and from the pre-main-sequence (\\rm PMS) through the\nend of their main-sequence (\\rm MS) lifetime. The parametric models include\nmagnetic braking based on numerical simulations of magnetised stellar winds,\nmass loss rate prescription, core-envelope decoupling as well as disk locking\nphenomena.\n  We have also accounted for recent developments in modelling dramatically\nweakened magnetic braking in stars more evolved than the Sun. We fit the free\nparameters in our model by comparing model predictions to rotational\ndistributions of a number of stellar clusters as well as individual field\nstars. Our model reasonably successfully reproduces the rotational behaviour of\nstars during the \\rm PMS phase to the zero-age main-sequence (\\rm ZAMS) spin\nup, sudden \\rm ZAMS spin down, and convergence of the rotation rates\nafterwards. We find that including core-envelope decoupling improves our models\nespecially for low-mass stars at younger ages. In addition, by accounting for\nthe almost complete suppression of magnetic braking at slow spin periods, we\nprovide better fits to observations of stellar rotations compared to previous\nmodels.\n", "  Black phosphorus (BP) has emerged as a promising material candidate for next\ngeneration electronic and optoelectronic devices due to its high mobility,\ntunable band gap and highly anisotropic properties. In this work, polarization\nresolved ultrafast mid-infrared transient reflection spectroscopy measurements\nare performed to study the dynamical anisotropic optical properties of BP under\nmagnetic fields up to 9 T. The relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carrier is\nfound to be insensitive to the applied magnetic field due to the broadening of\nthe Landau levels and large effective mass of carriers. While the anisotropic\noptical response of BP decreases with increasing magnetic field, its\nenhancement due to the excitation of hot carriers is similar to that without\nmagnetic field. These experimental results can be well interpreted by the\nmagneto-optical conductivity of the Landau levels of BP thin film, based on an\neffective k*p Hamiltonian and linear response theory. These findings suggest\nattractive possibilities of multi-dimensional controls of anisotropic response\n(AR) of BP with light, electric and magnetic field, which further introduces BP\nto the fantastic magnetic field sensitive applications.\n", "  Superconducting bulk (RE)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ materials (RE-rare earth\nelements) have been successfully used to generate magnetic flux densities in\nexcess of 17 T. This work investigates an alternative approach by trapping flux\nin stacks of second generation high temperature superconducting tape from\nseveral manufacturers using field cooling and pulsed field magnetisation\ntechniques. Flux densities of up to 13.4 T were trapped by field cooling at ~5\nK between two 12 mm square stacks, an improvement of 70% over previous value\nachieved in an HTS tape stack. The trapped flux approaches the record values in\n(RE)BCO bulks and reflects the rapid developments still being made in the HTS\ntape performance.\n", "  In this article, I discuss the relationship of mathematics to the physical\nworld, and to other spheres of human knowledge. In particular, I argue that\nMathematics is created by human beings, and the number $\\pi$ can not be said to\nhave existed $100,000$ years ago, using the conventional meaning of the word\n`exist'.\n", "  The Debye-H\\\" uckel formula for ionic activity coefficients is extended for\nconcentrated solutions by solving a simple model of many-body Coulomb\ncorrelations and adding the Born solvation energy. Given the bulk permittivity,\nour formula is able to fit activity data for diverse electrolytes with only one\nparameter to adjust the correlation length, which interpolates between the\nBjerrum length and the mean ion spacing. The results show that ionic activity\nin most electrolytes is dominated by three types of electrostatic forces: (i)\nmean-field charge screening, (ii) solvation, and (iii) Coulomb correlations,\nboth \"over-screening\" (charge oscillations) and \"under-screening\" (extending\nbeyond the Debye screening length).\n", "  In this study, the dynamic of guided ionization wave (IW) generated by an\natmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) device in plasma gun configuration is\nexperimentally investigated. The present work focuses on the properties of the\nintense electric field (EF) driving the IW. Taking advantages of APPJs to\nproduce guided and reproducible IWs, the induced EF vector is characterized\nspatially and temporally along the direction of propagation. With this\napproach, EF vector mapping of guided IWs have been measured and documented for\nthe first time. In the first part, the propagation within a glass tube of the\nfirst IW is investigated. Under the present conditions, a second guided IW is\nobserved and propagates, leading to the formation of a guided streamer. The EF\ndue to transient charge deposited on the wall surface is observed, particularly\nat the end of the tube. In the second part, one reports on the EF vector\nmapping under a dielectric substrate in contact with guided IWs. EF strength up\nto 55 kV cm$^{-1}$ has been measured and corroborates prior results from\npredictive numerical simulations. Intriguing configurations of the EF lines\nwill be of significant interest to validate theoretical models in order to\nrefine the non-equilibrium plasma chemistry kinetics. Furthermore, this\npreliminary work provides important insights into various applications\ninvolving IW driven discharges such as liquid activation, environmental\ntreatments, plasma medicine, active flow control and plasma agriculture.\n", "  In this short essay, we discuss some basic features of cognitive activity at\nseveral different space-time scales: from neural networks in the brain to\ncivilizations. One motivation for such comparative study is its heuristic\nvalue. Attempts to better understand the functioning of \"wetware\" involved in\ncognitive activities of central nervous system by comparing it with a computing\ndevice have a long tradition. We suggest that comparison with Internet might be\nmore adequate. We briefly touch upon such subjects as encoding, compression,\nand Saussurean trichotomy langue/langage/parole in various environments.\n", "  The creation of carbon and oxygen in our universe is one of the forefront\nquestions in nuclear astrophysics. The determination of the abundance of these\nelements is key to both our understanding of the formation of life on earth and\nto the life cycles of stars. While nearly all models of different\nnucleosynthesis environments are affected by the production of carbon and\noxygen, a key ingredient, the precise determination of the reaction rate of\n12C(a,g)16O, has long remained elusive. This is owed to the reaction's\ninaccessibility, both experimentally and theoretically. Nuclear theory has\nstruggled to calculate this reaction rate because the cross section is produced\nthrough different underlying nuclear mechanisms. Isospin selection rules\nsuppress the E1 component of the ground state cross section, creating a unique\nsituation where the E1 and E2 contributions are of nearly equal amplitudes.\nExperimentally there have also been great challenges. Measurements have been\npushed to the limits of state of the art techniques, often developed for just\nthese measurements. The data have been plagued by uncharacterized\nuncertainties, often the result of the novel measurement techniques, that have\nmade the different results challenging to reconcile. However, the situation has\nmarkedly improved in recent years, and the desired level of uncertainty, about\n10%, may be in sight. In this review the current understanding of this critical\nreaction is summarized. The emphasis is placed primarily on the experimental\nwork and interpretation of the reaction data, but discussions of the theory and\nastrophysics are also pursued. The main goal is to summarize and clarify the\ncurrent understanding of the reaction and then point the way forward to an\nimproved determination of the reaction rate.\n", "  The quantum theory of indirect measurements in physical systems is studied.\nThe example of an indirect measurement of an observable represented by a\nself-adjoint operator $\\mathcal{N}$ with finite spectrum is analysed in detail.\nThe Hamiltonian generating the time evolution of the system in the absence of\ndirect measurements is assumed to be given by the sum of a term commuting with\n$\\mathcal{N}$ and a small perturbation not commuting with $\\mathcal{N}$. The\nsystem is subject to repeated direct (projective) measurements using a single\ninstrument whose action on the state of the system commutes with $\\mathcal{N}$.\nIf the Hamiltonian commutes with the observable $\\mathcal{N}$ (i.e., if the\nperturbation vanishes) the state of the system approaches an eigenstate of\n$\\mathcal{N}$, as the number of direct measurements tends to $\\infty$. If the\nperturbation term in the Hamiltonian does \\textit{not} commute with\n$\\mathcal{N}$ the system exhibits \"jumps\" between different eigenstates of\n$\\mathcal{N}$. We determine the rate of these jumps to leading order in the\nstrength of the perturbation and show that if time is re-scaled appropriately a\nmaximum likelihood estimate of $\\mathcal{N}$ approaches a Markovian jump\nprocess on the spectrum of $\\mathcal{N}$, as the strength of the perturbation\ntends to $0$.\n", "  Photonics offers a route to fast and distributed quantum computing in ambient\nconditions, provided that photon sources and logic gates can be operated\ndeterministically. Quantum memories, capable of storing and re-emitting photons\non demand, enable quasi-deterministic operations by synchronising stochastic\nevents. We recently interfaced a Raman-type quantum memory with a\ntravelling-wave heralded photon source. Here we discuss the trade-space for the\nspectral characteristics of such sources, and we present measurements of our\nsource, which represents a practical compromise enabling passive stability,\nhigh brightness in a single-pass configuration, high purity and good matching\nto our Cs vapour memory.\n", "  State space and entropy rate of a discrete non-equilibrium system are shortly\nconsidered including internal variables and the contact temperature. The\nconcept of internal variables in the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics\nof a closed discrete system is discussed. The difference between internal\nvariables and degrees of freedom are repeated, and different types of their\nevolution equations are mentioned in connection with G\\'{e}rard A. Maugin's\nnumerous papers on applications of internal variables. The non-equilibrium\ncontact temperature is recognized as an internal variable and its evolution\nequation is presented.\n", "  Large parameter studies of fluid dynamic instabilities can crucially be\nsimplified, if the user does not need to specify the simulation time. For this\npurpose, a steady state detection is implemented in the CFD library OpenFOAM.\nIt terminates simulations automatically if characteristic measurements do not\nchange over time, i.e. when saturation is reached. For that purpose, recent\ndata is compared to previous one using two selectable methods. Both calculate a\nvalue used as steady state indicator. The first method performing a two sample\nStudent's t-test examines the difference between the means. Similarly, the\nsecond method utilises a two sample f-test checking for changes between the\nvariances. Both methods are briefly described, compared and their specific area\nof application is discussed. Their usefulness is demonstrated with a simple\nexemplary test case.\n", "  Solar eruptions generally refer to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares.\nBoth are important sources of space weather. Solar flares cause sudden change\nin the ionization level in the ionosphere. CMEs cause solar energetic particle\n(SEP) events and geomagnetic storms. A flare with unusually high intensity\nand/or a CME with extremely high energy can be thought of examples of extreme\nevents on the Sun. These events can also lead to extreme SEP events and/or\ngeomagnetic storms. Ultimately, the energy that powers CMEs and flares are\nstored in magnetic regions on the Sun, known as active regions. Active regions\nwith extraordinary size and magnetic field have the potential to produce\nextreme events. Based on current data sets, we estimate the sizes of\none-in-hundred and one-in-thousand year events as an indicator of the\nextremeness of the events. We consider both the extremeness in the source of\neruptions and in the consequences. We then compare the estimated 100-year and\n1000-year sizes with the sizes of historical extreme events measured or\ninferred.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new quasar: SDSS J022155.26-064916.6. This\nobject was discovered while reducing spectra of a sample of stars being\nconsidered as spectrophotometric standards for the Dark Energy Survey. The flux\nand wavelength calibrated spectrum is presented with four spectral lines\nidentified. From these lines, the redshift is determined to be z is\napproximately equal to 0.806. In addition, the rest-frame u-, g-, and r-band\nluminosity, determined using a k-correction obtained with synthetic photometry\nof a proxy QSO, are reported as 7.496 $\\times 10^{13}$ solar luminosities,\n2.049 $\\times 10^{13}$ solar luminosities, and $1.896 \\times 10^{13}$ solar\nluminosities, respectively.\n", "  Given that observational and numerical climate data are being produced at\never more prodigious rates, increasingly sophisticated and automated analysis\ntechniques have become essential. Deep learning is quickly becoming a standard\napproach for such analyses and, while great progress is being made, major\nchallenges remain. Unlike commercial applications in which deep learning has\nled to surprising successes, scientific data is highly complex and typically\nunlabeled. Moreover, interpretability and detecting new mechanisms are key to\nscientific discovery. To enhance discovery we present a complementary\nphysics-based, data-driven approach that exploits the causal nature of\nspatiotemporal data sets generated by local dynamics (e.g. hydrodynamic flows).\nWe illustrate how novel patterns and coherent structures can be discovered in\ncellular automata and outline the path from them to climate data.\n", "  We explore the temporal evolution of the energy radiated by CO2 and NO from\nthe Earth's thermosphere on a global scale. This investigation is based on both\nobservational and empirically derived data. Firstly, we analyze the daily power\nobservations of CO2 and NO obtained by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using\nBroadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the NASA\nThermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite\nthroughout the period 2002 - 2016. Secondly, we perform the same analysis to\nthe empirical daily power emitted by CO2 and NO that were derived recently from\nthe infrared energy budget of the thermosphere during 1947-2016. The tool\nemployed for the analysis of the observational and the empirical datasets is\nthe detrended fluctuation analysis, in order to investigate whether the power\nemitted by CO2 and by NO in the thermosphere exhibits power-law behaviour. The\nresults obtained from both the observational and empirical data do not support\nthe establishment of the power-law behaviour. This result indicates that the\nempirically derived data exhibit the same intrinsic properties with the\nobservational ones, thus enhancing their reliability.\n", "  Appropriate candidates of the metallic sheet used for the electrodes of\ndiamond semiconductor are investigated using computational approaches based on\ndensity functional theory (DFT). For twenty kinds of metallic elements $x$, we\nmodeled a diamond-metal interface and evaluated its work of separation,\n$W_\\mathrm{sep}(x)$, as a possible measure of anti-peeling strength. The\nappropriateness of the Ohmic contact was inferred from DOS (density of states)\nanalysis of diamond-metal interface by looking at whether an in-gap\n(isolated/localized) peak disappears as well as a sufficient amount of DOS\nvalue exists around the Fermi level. Our DFT simulation confirmed that a\ntypical electrode, Au, is not adhesive enough for power devices\n[$W_\\mathrm{sep}(\\mathrm{Au}) = 0.80$ J/m$^2$], though showing the Ohmic\ncontact. In contrast, some transition metals were found to possess Ohmic\nfeatures with much stronger adhesion than Au [e.g.,\n$W_\\mathrm{sep}(\\mathrm{Cr}/\\mathrm{Ti}) = 6.02/4.03$ J/m$^2$].\n", "  A new measurement is presented of the $^6$Li(n,$\\alpha$)t cross section from\n245 keV to 10 MeV using a $^{252}$Cf fission chamber with $^6$LiI(Eu) and\nCs$_2$LiYCl$_6$:Ce (CLYC) scintillators which act as both target and detector.\nNeutron energies are determined from the time of flight (TOF) method using the\nsignals from spontaneous fission and reaction product recoil. Simulations of\nneutron downscatter in the crystals and fission chamber bring\n$^6$Li(n,$\\alpha$)t cross section values measured with the $^6$LiI(Eu) into\nagreement with previous experiments and evaluations, except for two resonances\nat 4.2 and 6.5 MeV introduced by ENDF/B-VII.1. Suspected neutron transport\nmodeling issues cause the cross section values obtained with CLYC to be\ndiscrepant above 2 MeV.\n", "  In this paper, we will show methods to interpret some rigid origami with\nhigher degree vertices as the limit case of structures with degree-4\nsupplementary angle vertices. The interpretation is based on separating each\ncrease into two parallel creases, or \\emph{double lines}, connected by\nadditional structures at the vertex. We show that double-lined versions of\ndegree-4 flat-foldable vertices possess a rigid folding motion, as do symmetric\ndegree-$2n$ vertices. The latter gives us a symbolic analysis of the original\nvertex, showing that the tangent of the quarter fold angles are proportional to\neach other. The double line method is also a potentially useful in giving\nthickness to rigid origami mechanisms. By making single crease into two\ncreases, the fold angles can be distributed to avoid $180^\\circ$ folds, when\npanels can easily collide with each other. This can be understood as an\nextension of the crease offset method of thick rigid origami with an additional\nguarantee of rigid-foldability.\n", "  We study quantum coherence in a spin chain with both symmetric exchange and\nantisymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya couplings. Quantum coherence is quantified\nusing the recently introduced quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, which has the\nproperty that it is easily calculable and has several desirable mathematical\nproperties. We calculate exactly the coherence for arbitrary number of spins at\nzero temperature in various limiting cases. The $\\sigma^{z} \\sigma^{z}$\ninteraction tunes the amount of coherence in the system, and the antisymmetric\ncoupling changes the nature of the coherence. We also investigate the effect of\nnon-zero temperature by looking at a two-spin system and and similar behavior,\nwith temperature dampening the coherence. The characteristic behavior of\ncoherence resembles that of entanglement and is opposite to that of discord.\nThe distribution of the coherence on the spins is investigated and found that\nit arises entirely due to the correlations between the spins.\n", "  Two relevant points related to the application of the BFKL formalism to\nphenomenology are discussed. First, we have presented a set of observables\ncharacterizing multi-jet configurations event by event (average transverse\nmomentum, average azimuthal angle, average ratio of jet rapidities) which can\nbe used to find distinct signals of BFKL dynamics at the LHC. A numerical\nanalysis has been shown using the Monte Carlo event generator BFKLex, modified\nto include higher-order collinear corrections in addition to the\ntransverse-momentum implementation of the NLO kernel. We require to have two\ntagged forward/backward jets in the final state. Second, the structure of the\nBFKL equation changes if infrared boundary conditions are imposed when\nconsidering the running of the coupling. The cut in the complex angular\nmomentum plane becomes an infinite series of Regge poles. Integrating along a\ncontour off the real axis we find a strong dependence of the intercepts and\ncollinear regions on the choice of the boundary conditions. The mean transverse\nscales dominant in the gluon ladder increase. This could have interesting\nphenomenological consequences.\n", "  Since the atomic clock was invented, its performance has been improved for\none digit every decade until 90s of last century when the traditional atomic\nclock almost reached its limit. With laser cooled atoms, the performance can be\nfurther improved, and nowadays the cold atom based clocks are widely used as\nprimary frequency standards. Such a kind of cold atom clocks has great\napplications in space. This paper presents the design and tests of a cold atom\nclock (CAC) operating in space. In microgravity, the atoms are cooled, trapped,\nlaunched and finally detected after being interrogated by microwave field with\nRamsey method. The results of laser cooling of atoms in microgravity in orbit\nare presented and compared with that on ground for the first time. That the\nfull width at half maximum (FWHM) of obtained central Ramsey fringes varies\nlinearly with launching velocity of cold atoms shows the effects of\nmicrogravity. With appropriate parameters, a closed-loop locking of the CAC is\nrealized in orbit and the estimated short term frequency stability of\n$3.0\\times 10 ^{-13}/\\sqrt{\\tau }$ has been reached.\n", "  The inherent network of nanopores and voids in silicon dioxide (SiO2) is\ngenerally undesirable for aspects of film quality, electrical insulation and\ndielectric performance. However, if we view these pores as natural\nnano-patterns embedded in a dielectric matrix then that opens up new vistas for\nexploration. The nano-pattern platform can be used to tailor electrical,\noptical, magnetic and mechanical properties of the carrier film. In this\narticle we report the tunable electrical properties of thermal SiO2 thin-film\nachieved through utilization of the metal-nanopore network where the pores are\nfilled with metallic Titanium (Ti). Without any intentional chemical doping, we\nhave shown that the electrical resistivity of the oxide film can be controlled\nthrough physical filling up of the intrinsic oxide nanopores with Ti. The\nelectrical resistance of the composite film remains constant even after\ncomplete removal of the metal from the film surface except the pores. Careful\nmorphological, electrical and structural analyses are carried out to establish\nthat the presence of Ti in the nanopores play a crucial role in the observed\nconductive nature of the nanoporous film.\n", "  In this paper, we established the global existence of supersonic entropy\nsolutions with a strong contact discontinuity over Lipschitz wall governed by\nthe two-dimensional steady exothermically reacting Euler equations, when the\ntotal variation of both initial data and the slope of Lipschitz wall is\nsufficiently small. Local and global estimates are developed and a modified\nGlimm-type functional is carefully designed. Next the validation of the\nquasi-one-dimensional approximation in the domain bounded by the wall and the\nstrong contact discontinuity is rigorous justified by proving that the\ndifference between the average of weak solution and the solution of\nquasi-one-dimensional system can be bounded by the square of the total\nvariation of both initial data and the slope of Lipschitz wall. The methods and\ntechniques developed here is also helpful for other related problems.\n", "  In this report, some cosmological correlation functions are used to evaluate\nthe differential performance between C2075 and P100 GPU cards. In the past, the\ncorrelation functions used in this work have been widely studied and exploited\non some previous GPU architectures. The analysis of the performance indicates\nthat a speedup in the range from 13 to 15 is achieved without any additional\noptimization process for the P100 card.\n", "  This paper investigates the relationship between specific baryon angular\nmomentum $j_\\mathrm{b}$ and baryon mass $M_\\mathrm{b}$ for a sample of nearby\nlate-type galaxies with resolved HI kinematics. This work roughly doubles the\nnumber of galaxies with $M_\\mathrm{b} \\lesssim 10^{10}$ $M_{\\odot}$ used to\nstudy the $j_\\mathrm{b} - M_\\mathrm{b}$ relation. Most of the galaxies in the\nsample have their baryon mass dominated by their gas content, thereby offering\n$j_\\mathrm{b}$ and Mb measures that are relatively unaffected by uncertainties\narising from the stellar mass-to-light ratio. Measured HI surface density\nradial profiles together with optical and rotation curve data from the\nliterature are used to derive a best-fit relation given by\n$j_\\mathrm{b}=qM_\\mathrm{b}^{\\alpha}$, with $\\alpha=0.62\\pm 0.02$ and\n$\\log_{10}q=-3.35\\pm 0.25$. This result is consistent with the\n$j_\\mathrm{b}\\propto M_\\mathrm{b}^{2/3}$ relation that is theoretically\nexpected and also measured by Obreschkow & Glazebrook (2014) for their full\nsample of THINGS spiral galaxies, yet differs to their steeper relation found\nfor subsets with fixed bulge fraction. The 30 arcsec spatial resolution of the\nHI imaging used in this study is significantly lower than that of the THINGS\nimaging used by Obreschkow & Glazebrook (2014), yet the results presented in\nthis work are clearly shown to contain no significant systematic errors due to\nthe low-resolution imaging.\n", "  The generalized tight-binding model, being based on the spin-dependent\nsublattices, is developed to explore the magnetic quantization of monolayer\nbismuthene. The sp$^{3}$ orbital hybridizations, site energies, nearest and\nnext-nearest hopping integrals, spin-orbital interactions and magnetic field\n(${B_{z}}$ ${\\hat{z}}$) are taken into account simultaneously. There exist\nthree groups of low-lying Landau levels (LLs), in which they are mainly from\nthe (6p$_{x}$,6p$_{y}$,6p$_{z}$) orbitals, and only the first group belongs to\nthe unoccupied conduction states. Furthermore, each group is further split into\nthe spin-up- and spin-down-dominated subgroups. The six subgroups present the\nrich and unique $B_{z}$-dependent LL energy spectra, covering the specific or\narc-shaped $% B_{z}$-dependences, the normal/irregular spin-split energies, and\nthe non-crossing/crossing/anti-crossing behaviors. Specially, the second group\nof valence LLs near the Fermi level can create the frequent inter-subgroup LL\nanti-crossings since the main and side modes are comparable. The main features\nof energy spectra can create the special structures in density of states.\n", "  The realization of green and economically friendly energy storage systems\nneeds materials with outstanding properties. Future batteries based on Na as an\nabundant element take advantage of non-flammable ceramic electrolytes with very\nhigh conductivities. $\\rm Na{_{3}}Zr{_{2}}(SiO{_{4}}){_{2}}PO{_{4}}$-type\nsuperionic conductors are expected to pave the way for inherently safe and\nsustainable all-solid-state batteries. So far, only little information has been\nextracted from spectroscopic measurements to clarify the origins of fast ionic\nhopping on the atomic length scale. Here we combined broad-band conductivity\nspectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation to study Na ion\ndynamics from the {\\mu}m to the angstrom length scale. Spin-lattice relaxation\nNMR revealed a very fast Na ion exchange process in $\\rm\nNa{_{3.4}}Sc{_{0.4}}Zr{_{1.6}}(SiO{_{4}}){_{2}}PO{_{4}}$ that is characterized\nby an unprecedentedly high self-diffusion coefficient of $\\rm 9 \\times\n10{^{-12}} m{^{2}}s{^{-1}}$ at $\\rm -10{\\deg}C$. Thus, well below ambient\ntemperature the Na ions have access to elementary diffusion processes with a\nmean residence time $\\rm {\\tau}_{NMR}$ of only $\\rm 2\\; ns$. The underlying\nasymmetric diffusion-induced NMR rate peak and the corresponding conductivity\nisotherms measured in the MHz range reveal correlated ionic motion. Obviously,\nlocal but extremely rapid $\\rm Na{^{+}}$ jumps, involving especially the\ntransition sites in Sc-NZSP, trigger long-range ion transport and push ionic\nconductivity up to $\\rm 2\\; mS\\; cm{^{-1}}$ at room temperature.\n", "  The MeerKAT telescope will be one of the most sensitive radio arrays in the\npre-SKA era. Here we discuss a low-frequency SZ-selected cluster survey with\nMeerKAT, the MeerKAT Extended Relics, Giant Halos, and Extragalactic Radio\nSources (MERGHERS) survey. The primary goal of this survey is to detect faint\nsignatures of diffuse cluster emission, specifically radio halos and relics.\nSZ-selected cluster samples offer a homogeneous, mass-limited set of targets\nout to higher redshift than X-ray samples. MeerKAT is sensitive enough to\ndetect diffuse radio emission at the faint levels expected in low-mass and\nhigh-redshift clusters, thereby enabling radio halo and relic formation\ntheories to be tested with a larger statistical sample over a significantly\nexpanded phase space. Complementary multiwavelength follow-up observations will\nprovide a more complete picture of any clusters found to host diffuse emission,\nthereby enhancing the scientific return of the MERGHERS survey.\n", "  We present a first attempt at a global fit of unpolarized quark transverse\nmomentum dependent distribution and fragmentation functions from available data\non semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan and $Z$ boson production\nprocesses. This analysis is performed in the low transverse momentum region, at\nleading order in perturbative QCD and with the inclusion of energy scale\nevolution effects at the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.\n", "  We investigate the phase structures of theories which differ from QCD only in\nthe gauge group and can be simulated on the lattice at non-vanishing chemical\npotential $\\mu$. These theories can thus serve as testing ground for functional\nmethods at non-vanishing density. We determine the chiral and\nconfinement/deconfinement transitions at $\\mu=0$ for the three gauge groups\n$SU(3)$, $SU(2)$ and $G_2$ for two quark flavors and extend the study of the\nchiral transition to non-zero $\\mu$. We locate the critical point where the\nchiral crossover becomes a real phase transition. Within the employed\ntruncation, we find that all three theories behave qualitatively very\nsimilarly.\n", "  We propose and design photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) in hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) for diverse photonic and quantum applications. Two dimensional\n(2D) hBN flakes contain quantum emitters which are ultra-bright and photostable\nat room temperature. To achieve optimal coupling of these emitters to optical\nresonators, fabrication of cavities from monolithic hBN is therefore required,\nto maximize the overlap between cavity optical modes and the emitters. Here, we\ndesign 2D and 1D PCCs using anisotropic indices of hBN. The influence of\nunderlying substrates and material absorption are investigated, and spontaneous\nemission rate enhancements are calculated. Our results are promising for future\nquantum photonic experiments with hBN.\n", "  We present a method to assess the plausibility of alternative mechanisms to\nexplain the damping of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) transverse waves in solar\ncoronal loops. The considered mechanisms are resonant absorption of kink waves\nin the Alfv\\'en continuum, phase-mixing of Alfv\\'en waves, and wave leakage.\nOur methods make use of Bayesian inference and model comparison techniques. We\nfirst infer the values for the physical parameters that control the wave\ndamping, under the assumption of a particular mechanism, for typically observed\ndamping time-scales. Then, the computation of marginal likelihoods and Bayes\nfactors enable us to quantify the relative plausibility between the alternative\nmechanisms. We find that, in general, the evidence is not large enough to\nsupport a single particular damping mechanism as the most plausible one.\nResonant absorption and wave leakage offer the most probable explanations in\nstrong damping regimes, while phase mixing is the best candidate for\nweak/moderate damping. When applied to a selection of 89 observed transverse\nloop oscillations, with their corresponding measurements of damping times\nscales and taking into account data uncertainties, we find that only in a few\ncases positive evidence for a given damping mechanism is available.\n", "  A Fourier transform from momentum space to twistor space is introduced in\ntwistor string theory, for the first time, for the case where the twistor space\nis a three-dimensional real projective space, corresponding to ultra-hyperbolic\nspacetime. In this case, the Fourier transform is the same as in the standard\nanalysis. However, when the twistor space is a three-dimensional complex\nprojective space, corresponding to the complexified Minkowski space, some\naspects of the Fourier transform have yet to be clarified. For example, no\nconcrete method is known for calculating the complex integral, and nor is it\nknown which functions it should be applied to or what results are obtained. In\nthis paper, we define a Fourier transform for momentum-space functions in terms\nof a certain complex integral, assuming that the functions can be expanded as\npower series. We also define the inverse Fourier transform for twistor-space\nfunctions in terms of a certain complex integral. Then, we show that the\nmomentum-space functions to which the Fourier transform can be applied and the\ntwistor-space functions that are obtained can be represented in terms of\ncohomology groups. Furthermore, we show that the twistor operator\nrepresentations popular in the twistor theory literature are valid for the\nFourier transform and its inverse transform. We also show that the functions\nover which the application of the operators is closed can be represented in\nterms of cohomology groups.\n", "  The state of the art for integral evaluation is that analytical solutions to\nintegrals are far more useful than numerical solutions. We evaluate certain\nintegrals analytically that are necessary in some approaches in quantum\nchemistry. In the title, where R stands for nucleus-electron and r for\nelectron-electron distances, the $(n,m)=(0,0)$ case is trivial, the\n$(n,m)=(1,0)$ and (0,1) cases are well known, fundamental milestone in\nintegration and widely used in computation chemistry, as well as based on\nLaplace transformation with integrand exp(-$a^2t^2$). The rest of the cases are\nnew and need the other Laplace transformation with integrand exp(-$a^2t$) also,\nas well as the necessity of a two dimensional version of Boys function comes up\nin case. These analytic expressions (up to Gaussian function integrand) are\nuseful for manipulation with higher moments of inter-electronic distances, for\nexample in correlation calculations.\n", "  Self-propulsion (SP) is a main feature of active particles (AP), such as\nbacteria or biological micromotors, distinguishing them from passive colloids.\nA renowned consequence of SP is accumulation at static interfaces, even in the\nabsence of hydrodynamic interactions. Here we address the role of SP in the\ninteraction between AP and a moving semipermeable membrane. In particular, we\nimplement a model of noninteracting AP in a channel crossed by a partially\npenetrable wall, moving at a constant velocity $c$. With respect to both the\ncases of passive colloids with $c>0$ and AP with $c=0$, the AP with finite $c$\nshow enhancement of accumulation in front of the obstacle and experience a\nlargely increased drag force. This effect is understood in terms of an\neffective potential localised at the interface between particles and membrane,\nof height proportional to $c\\tau/\\xi$, where $\\tau$ is the AP's re-orientation\ntime and $\\xi$ the width characterising the surface's smoothness ($\\xi\\to 0$\nfor hard core obstacles). An approximate analytical scheme is able to reproduce\nthe observed density profiles and the measured drag force, in very good\nagreement with numerical simulations. The effects discussed here can be\nexploited for automatic selection and filtering of AP with desired parameters.\n", "  The Brexit referendum on the United Kingdom membership of the European Union\ntook place on 23 June 2016. On the basis of a 52-48 split, statements such as:\nthe majority of the UK chose to leave the EU, or the British people have voted\nto leave the European Union, or the will of the British people is to leave the\nEU, have pervaded political discourse and newspaper articles. In a recent\npaper, the authors present scientific arguments to contend that all those\nstatements are without basis. They point out the fundamental issues with the\nBrexit referendum, which lie in how the data was summarized, ignoring\nfundamental statistical principles, and in the lack of terms of reference\nfixing a threshold for the result and for the minimum turnout. If carefully\nplanned, the actual division of the United Kingdom would have been properly\ncaptured and the result---either way, for Leave or Remain---would have been\nreadily accepted. In the present paper, the authors summarize the discussion\nand add some context in non-technical terms.\n", "  This paper develops further the semi-classical theory of an harmonic\noscillator acted on by a Gaussian white noise force discussed in\n(arXiv:1508.02379). Here I add to that theory the effects of Brownian damping\n(friction). Albeit semi-classical, the theory can be used to model quantum\nexpectations and probabilities. I consider several examples.\n", "  In this work we consider an agent based model in order to study the wealth\ndistribution problem where the interchange is determined with a symmetric zero\nsum game. Simultaneously, the agents update their way of play trying to learn\nthe optimal one. Here, the agents use mixed strategies. We study this model\nusing both simulations and theoretical tools. We derive the equations for the\nlearning mechanism, and we show that the mean strategy of the population\nsatisfies an equation close to the classical replicator equation.\n  Concerning the wealth distribution, there are two interesting situations\ndepending on the equilibrium of the game. If the equilibrium is a pure\nstrategy, the wealth distribution is fixed after some transient time, and those\nplayers which are close to optimal strategy are richer. When the game has an\nequilibrium in mixed strategies, the stationary wealth distribution is close to\na Gamma distribution with variance depending on the coefficients of the game\nmatrix. We compute theoretically their second moment in this case.\n", "  I present a preliminary determination of the Fragmentation Functions (FFs) of\nunidentified charged hadrons at next-to-leading order in quantum\nchromodynamics. The analysis is based on hadron production cross section data\nin single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation. It extends a recent\ndetermination of the FFs of identified charged pions, charged kaons and\nprotons/antiprotons performed by the NNPDF Collaboration. I illustrate the\nquality of the FFs determined in this analysis and show how they describe the\ncharged hadron spectra measured in proton-(anti)proton collisions.\n", "  The origin of flow-like effects in small systems, such as those produced in\nultra-relativistic proton-proton and proton-lead collisions, is still widely\ndebated. In this paper the goal is to look at possible consequences if indeed a\nmini-Quark-Gluon Plasma is formed in these collisions. It is argued that this\ncould indicate a duality between the QGP phase and the color fields in hadrons.\nA qualitative dense field picture is presented for this duality and discussed.\n", "  Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) are a fruitful tool for remote\ndiagnosis of the plasma in the heliosphere and its vicinity. So far,\ninstruments detecting ENAs from the heliosphere were configured for\nobservations of hydrogen atoms. Here, we estimate emissions of ENAs of the\nheavy chemical elements helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and neon. A large portion of\nthe heliospheric ENAs is created in the inner heliosheath from neutralized\ninterstellar pick-up ions (PUIs). We modeled this process and calculated\nfull-sky intensities of ENAs for energies 0.2-130 keV/nuc. We found that the\nlargest fluxes among considered species are expected for helium, smaller for\noxygen and nitrogen, and smallest for neon. The obtained intensities are\n50-10^6 times smaller than the hydrogen ENA intensities observed by IBEX. The\ndetection of heavy ENAs will be possible if a future ENA detector is equipped\nwith the capability to measure the masses of observed atoms. Because of\ndifferent reaction cross-sections among the different species, observations of\nheavy ENAs can allow for a better understanding of global structure of the\nheliosphere as well as the transport and energization of PUIs in the\nheliosphere.\n", "  Non-linear gravitational collapse introduces non-Gaussian statistics into the\nmatter fields of the late Universe. As the large-scale structure is the target\nof current and future observational campaigns, one would ideally like to have\nthe full probability density function of these non-Gaussian fields. The only\nviable way we see to achieve this analytically, at least approximately and in\nthe near future, is via the Edgeworth expansion. We hence rederive this\nexpansion for Fourier modes of non-Gaussian fields and then continue by putting\nit into a wider statistical context than previously done. We show that in its\noriginal form, the Edgeworth expansion only works if the non-Gaussian signal is\naveraged away. This is counterproductive, since we target the\nparameter-dependent non-Gaussianities as a signal of interest. We hence alter\nthe analysis at the decisive step and now provide a roadmap towards a\ncontrolled and unadulterated analysis of non-Gaussianities in structure\nformation (with the Edgeworth expansion). Our central result is that, although\nthe Edgeworth expansion has pathological properties, these can be predicted and\navoided in a careful manner. We also show that, despite the non-Gaussianity\ncoupling all modes, the Edgeworth series may be applied to any desired subset\nof modes, since this is equivalent (to the level of the approximation) to\nmarginalising over the exlcuded modes. In this first paper of a series, we\nrestrict ourselves to the sampling properties of the Edgeworth expansion,\ni.e.~how faithfully it reproduces the distribution of non-Gaussian data. A\nfollow-up paper will detail its Bayesian use, when parameters are to be\ninferred.\n", "  An intermediate inflationary universe model within the context of\nnon-minimally coupled to the scalar curvature is analyzed. We will conduct our\nanalysis under the slow roll approximation of the inflationary dynamics and the\ncosmological perturbations considering a coupling of the form\n$F(\\varphi)=\\kappa+\\xi_n\\varphi^n$. Considering the trajectories in the $r-n_s$\nplane from Planck data, we find the constraints on the parameter-space in our\nmodel.\n", "  Rotation-vibration energy levels are determined for the electronic ground\nstate of the acetylene molecule, $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$, using the Measured Active\nRotational-Vibrational Energy Levels (MARVEL) technique. 37,813 measured\ntransitions from 61 publications are considered. The distinct components of the\nspectroscopic network linking ortho and para states are considered separately.\nThe 20,717 ortho and 17,096 para transitions measured experimentally are used\nto determine 6013 ortho and 5200 para energy levels. The MARVEL results are\ncompared with alternative compilations based on the use of effective\nHamiltonians.\n", "  In recent experiments, small, thick-walled vesicles with a narrow size\ndistribution were formed from copolymers where the degree of polymerisation of\nthe hydrophobic block, N_B, was significantly greater than that of the\nhydrophilic block, N_A. Using a mean-field theory, we reproduce several aspects\nof the behaviour of these vesicles. Firstly, we find a minimum in the free\nenergy of the system of vesicles as a function of their radius, corresponding\nto a preferred size for the vesicles, when N_B is several times larger than\nN_A. Furthermore, the vesicle radius diverges as N_B is increased towards a\ncritical value, consistent with the instability of the vesicles with respect to\nfurther aggregation seen in the experimental work. Finally, we find that this\ninstability can also be triggered in our model by changing the interaction\nstrength of the copolymers with the solvent.\n"]}
