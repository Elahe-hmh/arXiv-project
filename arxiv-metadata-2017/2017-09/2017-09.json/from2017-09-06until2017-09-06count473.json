vast number of equidistantly spaced\nnarrow band laser modes that can be simultaneously tuned and frequency\ncalibrated with 15 digits accuracy. Our Vernier spectrometer utilizes all of\ntheses modes in a massively parallel manner to rapidly record both absorption\nand dispersion spectra with a sensitivity that is provided by a high finesse\nbroad band optical resonator and a resolution that is only limited by the\nfrequency comb line width while keeping the required setup simple.\n", "  This review paper is devoted to the theory of orbits. We start with the\ndiscussion of the Newtonian problem of motion then we consider the relativistic\nproblem of motion, in particular the PN approximation and the further\ngravitomagnetic corrections. Finally by a classification of orbits in\naccordance with the conditions of motion, we calculate the gravitational waves\nluminosity for different types of stellar encounters and orbits.\n", "  Studying the behaviour of a quantum field in a classical, curved, spacetime\nis an extraordinary task which nobody is able to take on at present time.\nIndependently by the fact that such problem is not likely to be solved soon,\nstill we possess the instruments to perform exact predictions in special,\nhighly symmetric, conditions. Aim of the present contribution is to show how it\nis possible to extract quantitative information about a variety of physical\nphenomena in very general situations by virtue of the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi\nmethod. In particular, we shall prove the agreement of such semi-classical\nmethod with exact results of quantum field theoretic calculations.\n", "  Systems with very long-range interactions (that decay at large distances like\n$U(r)\\sim r^{-l}$ with $l\\le d$ where $d$ is the space dimensionality) are\ndifficult to study by conventional statistical mechanics perturbation methods.\nExamples of these systems are gravitational and charged (non-electroneutral).\nIn this work we propose two alternative methodologies to avoid these\ndifficulties and capture some of the properties of the original potential. The\nfirst one consists in expressing the original potential in terms of a finite\nsum of hard-core Yukawa potentials. In the second one, the potential is\nrewritten as a damped potential, using a damping function with a parameter that\ncontrols the range of the interaction. These new potentials, which mimic the\noriginal one, can now be treated by conventional statistical mechanics methods.\n", "  A method for synthesizing dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences is presented,\nwhich can tailor these sequences to a given set of qubits, environments,\ninstruments, and available resources using partial information of the system.\nThe key concept behind the generation of the DD sequences involves not only\nextricating the strong dependence on the coupling strengths according to the\n\"optimal control,\" but also exploiting the \"refocus\" technique used\nconventionally to obtain DD sequences. The concept is a generalized one that\nintegrates optimal control and designing of DD sequences.\n", "  Ultrarelativistic charged particles are predicted to emit hard\nelectromagnetic radiation of undulator type while being channeled in a crystal\nwith periodically bent crystallographic planes. The recently proposed\ncrystalline undulator with the bending amplitude smaller than the distance\nbetween the bent planes and the bending period shorter than the period of\nchanneling oscillations is far superior to what was proposed previously. In the\nsame time, it is more challenging from the technical point of view because its\nbending period has to be in the sub-micron range. It is shown that a mixed\ncrystal of silicon-germanium with properly varying germanium fraction can have\nthe necessary bending parameters. Moreover, it is predicted to be stable\nagainst misfit dislocations.\n", "  We perform femtosecond frequency comb vernier spectroscopy in the near\ninfrared with a femtosecond Er doped fiber laser, a scanning high-finesse\ncavity and an InGaAs camera. By utilizing the properties of a frequency comb\nand a scanning high-finesse cavity such spectroscopy provides broad spectral\nbandwidth, high spectral resolution, and high detection sensitivity on a short\ntime scale. We achieved an absorption sensitivity of ~8E-8 cm-1Hz-1/2\ncorresponding to a detection limit of ~70 ppbv for acetylene, with a resolution\nof ~1.1 GHz in single images taken in 0.5 seconds and covering a frequency\nrange of ~5 THz. These measurements have broad applications for sensing other\ngreenhouse gases in this fingerprint near IR region with a simple apparatus.\n", "  With a jocund air, we present an observation on the first 24 coefficients of\nthe modular invariant and of the modular discriminant. The observation is\npurely for the sake of entertainment and could be of some diversion to a\nmathematical audience.\n", "  We analyze the near-collinear limit of the null polygonal hexagon super\nWilson loop in the planar N = 4 superYang-Mills theory. We focus on its\nGrassmann components which are dual to next-to-maximal helicity-violating\n(NMHV) scattering amplitudes. The kinematics in question is studied within a\nframework of the operator product expansion that encodes propagation of\nexcitations on the background of the color flux tube stretched between the\nsides of Wilson loop contour. While their dispersion relation is known to all\norders in 't Hooft coupling from previous studies, we find their form factor\ncouplings to the Wilson loop. This is done making use of a particular\ntessellation of the loop where pentagon transitions play a fundamental role.\nBeing interested in NMHV amplitudes, the corresponding building blocks carry a\nnontrivial charge under the SU(4) R-symmetry group. Restricting the current\nconsideration to twist-two accuracy, we analyze two-particle contributions with\na fermion as one of the constituents in the pair. We demonstrate that these\nnonsinglet pentagons obey bootstrap equations that possess consistent solutions\nfor any value of the coupling constant. To confirm the correctness of these\npredictions, we calculate their contribution to the super Wilson loop\ndemonstrating agreement with recent results to four-loop order in 't Hooft\ncoupling.\n", "  Quantum technologies are developing powerful tools to generate and manipulate\ncoherent superpositions of different energy levels. Envisaging a new generation\nof energy-efficient quantum devices, here we explore how coherence can be\nmanipulated without exchanging energy with the surrounding environment. We\nstart from the task of converting a coherent superposition of energy\neigenstates into another. We identify the optimal energy-preserving operations,\nboth in the deterministic and in the probabilistic scenario. We then design a\nrecursive protocol, wherein a branching sequence of energy-preserving filters\nincreases the probability of success while reaching maximum fidelity at each\niteration. Building on the recursive protocol, we construct efficient\napproximations of the optimal fidelity-probability trade-off, by taking\ncoherent superpositions of the different branches generated by probabilistic\nfiltering. The benefits of this construction are illustrated in applications to\nquantum metrology, quantum cloning, coherent state amplification, and\nancilla-driven computation. Finally, we extend our results to transitions where\nthe input state is generally mixed and we apply our findings to the task of\npurifying quantum coherence.\n", "  Lattice QCD calculations with different staggered valence and sea quarks can\nbe used to improve determinations of quark masses, Gasser-Leutwyler couplings,\nand other parameters relevant to phenomenology. We calculate the masses and\ndecay constants of flavored pions and kaons through next-to-leading order in\nstaggered-valence, staggered-sea mixed-action chiral perturbation theory. We\npresent the results in the valence-valence and valence-sea sectors, for all\ntastes. As in unmixed theories, the taste-pseudoscalar, valence-valence mesons\nare exact Goldstone bosons in the chiral limit, at non-zero lattice spacing.\nThe results reduce correctly when the valence and sea quark actions are\nidentical, connect smoothly to the continuum limit, and provide a way to\ncontrol light quark and gluon discretization errors in lattice calculations\nperformed with different staggered actions for the valence and sea quarks.\n", "  The nonlinear dynamics of resistive flow with a chemical reaction is studied.\nProceeding from the Lagrangian description, the influence of a chemical\nreaction on the development of fluid singularities is considered.\n", "  We have shown in previous work that the equivalence of the Heisenberg and\nSchr\\\"odinger pictures of quantum mechanics requires the use of the Born and\nJordan quantization rules. In the present work, we give further evidence that\nthe Born--Jordan rule is the correct quantization scheme for quantum mechanics.\nFor this purpose, we use correct short-time approximations to the action\nfunctional, which lead to the desired quantization of the classical\nHamiltonian. We thus prove that a previous argument of Kerner and Sutcliffe,\nrefuted by Cohen, is correct.\n", "  The Lagrangian fluid description is employed to solve the initial value\nproblem for one-dimensional, compressible fluid flows represented by the\nEuler-Poisson system. Exact nonlinear and time-dependent solutions are\nobtained, which exhibit a variety of transient phenomena such as a density\ncollapse in finite space-time or the appearance and, for the first time, a\nsuccessive dissolution of wavelet structures during the same event. The latter\nare superimposed on the gross density pattern in the course of the\nuni-directional expansion of an initially localized density hump. Whereas\nself-gravitating fluids will always experience collapse, neutral fluids and\nfluids with repulsive forces, such as a non-neutral, pure electron fluid, can\nexhibit an evolution of the second type, being determined by the initial\nconditions. For an electron fluid, being embedded in a neutralizing ion\nbackground, these nonlinearities are, however, strongly diminished due to the\nomnipresent plasma oscillations, which weaken and alternatively change the sign\nof the collective force.\n", "  We exploit a new numerical technique for evaluating the tree order\ncontributions to the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra for scalar\npotential models of inflation. Among other things we use the formalism to\ndevelop a good analytic approximation which goes beyond generalized slow roll\nexpansions in that (1) it is not contaminated by the physically irrelevant\nphase, (2) its 0th order term is exact for constant first slow roll parameter,\nand (3) the correction is multiplicative rather than additive. These features\nallow our formalism to capture at first order, effects which are higher order\nin other expansions. Although this accuracy is not necessary to compare current\ndata with any specific model, our method has a number of applications owing to\nthe simpler representation it provides for the connection between the power\nspectra and the expansion history of a general model.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will have a unique chance of discovery\nfor a large range of masses in Weakly Interacting Massive Particles models of\ndark matter. The principal target for dark matter searches with CTA is the\ncentre of the Galactic Halo. The best strategy is to perform CTA observations\nwithin a few degrees of the Galactic Centre, with the Galactic Centre itself\nand the most intense diffuse emission regions removed from the analysis.\nAssuming a cuspy dark matter density profile for the Milky Way, 500 hours of\nobservations in this region provide sensitivities to and below the thermal\ncross-section of dark matter annihilations, for masses between a few hundred\nGeV and a few tens of TeV; therefore CTA will have a significant chance of\ndiscovery in some models. Since the dark matter density in the Milky Way is far\nfrom certain in the inner kpc region, other targets are also proposed for\nobservation, like ultra-faint dwarf galaxies such as Segue 1 with 100 hours per\nyear proposed. Beyond these two observational targets, further alternatives,\nsuch as Galactic dark clumps, will be considered closer to the actual date of\nCTA operations. Sensitivity predictions for dark matter searches are given on\nthe various targets taking into account the latest instrument response\nfunctions expected for CTA together with a discussion on the systematic\nuncertainties from the backgrounds.\n", "  Exciton-polaritons in a microcavity are composite two-dimensional bosonic\nquasiparticles, arising from the strong coupling between confined light modes\nin a resonant planar optical cavity and excitonic transitions, typically using\nexcitons in semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) placed at the antinodes of the\nsame cavity. Quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC),\nquantized vortices, and macroscopic quantum states have been reported at\ntemperatures from tens of Kelvin up to room temperatures, and polaritonic\ndevices such as spin switches \\cite{Amo2010} and optical transistors have also\nbeen reported. Many of these effects of exciton-polaritons depend crucially on\nthe polariton-polariton interaction strength. Despite the importance of this\nparameter, it has been difficult to make an accurate experimental measurement,\nmostly because of the difficulty of determining the absolute densities of\npolaritons and bare excitons. Here we report the direct measurement of the\npolariton-polariton interaction strength in a very high-Q microcavity\nstructure. By allowing polaritons to propagate over 40 $\\mu$m to the center of\na laser-generated annular trap, we are able to separate the polariton-polariton\ninteractions from polariton-exciton interactions. The interaction strength is\ndeduced from the energy renormalization of the polariton dispersion as the\npolariton density is increased, using the polariton condensation as a benchmark\nfor the density. We find that the interaction strength is about two orders of\nmagnitude larger than previous theoretical estimates, putting polaritons\nsquarely into the strongly-interacting regime. When there is a condensate, we\nsee a sharp transition to a different dependence of the renormalization on the\ndensity, which is evidence of many-body effects.\n", "  In this paper, we have found a family of intermetallic compounds YMn12-xFex\n(x = 6.6-8.8) showing a bulk form of tunable giant exchange bias effect which\narises from global interactions among ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) sublattices but not the interfacial exchange coupling or inhomogeneous\nmagnetic clusters. A giant exchange bias with a loop shift up to 6.1 kOe has\nbeen observed in YMn4.4Fe7.6 compound with the strongest competing magnetic\ninteractions. In a narrow temperature range, the exchange bias field shows a\nsudden switching off whereas the coercivity shows a sudden switching on with\nincreasing temperature. This unique feature indicates that the inter-sublattice\nexchange coupling is highly homogenous, which can be perfectly interperated by\nour theoretical calculations.\n", "  We study the quantum criticality of the Lifshitz $\\varphi^4$-theory below the\nupper critical dimension. Two fixed points, one Gaussian and the other\nnon-Gaussian, are identified with zero and finite interaction strengths,\nrespectively. At zero temperature the particle density exhibits different\npower-law dependences on the chemical potential in the weak and strong\ninteraction regions. At finite temperatures, critical behaviors in the quantum\ndisordered region are mainly controlled by the chemical potential. In contrast,\nin the quantum critical region critical scalings are determined by temperature.\nThe scaling ansatz remains valid in the strong interaction limit for the\nchemical potential, correlation length, and particle density, while it breaks\ndown in the weak interaction one. As approaching the upper critical dimension,\nphysical quantities develop logarithmic dependence on dimensionality in the\nstrong interaction region. These results are applied to spin-orbit coupled\nbosonic systems, leading to predictions testable by future experiments.\n", "  The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), one of\nthe programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), has now completed\nits systematic, homogeneous spectroscopic survey sampling all major populations\nof the Milky Way. After a three year observing campaign on the Sloan 2.5-m\nTelescope, APOGEE has collected a half million high resolution (R~22,500), high\nS/N (>100), infrared (1.51-1.70 microns) spectra for 146,000 stars, with time\nseries information via repeat visits to most of these stars. This paper\ndescribes the motivations for the survey and its overall design---hardware,\nfield placement, target selection, operations---and gives an overview of these\naspects as well as the data reduction, analysis and products. An index is also\ngiven to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical\nsurvey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey\nperformance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products\nby way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time series\nanalysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from\nstellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity and abundance\npatterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the\ninterstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare\nstellar species. As part of SDSS-III Data Release 12, all of the APOGEE data\nproducts are now publicly available.\n", "  As proposed by Bambi and Modesto, rotating non-singular black holes can be\nconstructed via the Newman-Janis algorithm. Here we show that if one starts\nwith a modified Hayward black hole with a time delay in the centre, the\nalgorithm succeeds in producing a rotating metric, but curvature divergences\nreappear. To preserve finiteness, the time delay must be introduced directly at\nthe level of the non-singular rotating metric. This is possible thanks to the\ndeformation of the inner stationarity limit surface caused by the\nregularisation, and in more than one way. We outline three different\npossibilities, distinguished by the angular velocity of the event horizon.\nAlong the way, we provide additional results on the Bambi-Modesto rotating\nHayward metric, such as the structure of the regularisation occurring at the\ncentre, the behaviour of the quantum gravity scale alike an electric charge in\ndecreasing the angular momentum of the extremal black hole configuration, or\ndetails on the deformation of the ergosphere.\n", "  We study the coupling of a Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP)\nequation to a separate, advection-only transport process. We find that the\nfront dynamics can be described by an FKPP-like equation only at sufficiently\nfast diffusion or large coupling strength. For such parameter regimes, we find\na mapping to an effective FKPP equation. We also find that FKPP equation is\nfragile with respect to the coupling to an advection-only mechanism, discover\nconditions when the front width diverges, and when front speed is insensitive\nto the coupling. At zero diffusion in this mean-field description, the downwind\nfront speed goes to a finite value as the coupling goes to zero.\n", "  We establish a precise correspondence between the ABC Conjecture and N=4\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory.\n  This is achieved by combining three ingredients: (i) Elkies' method of\nmapping ABC-triples to elliptic curves in his demonstration that ABC implies\nMordell/Faltings; (ii) an explicit pair of elliptic curve and associated Belyi\nmap given by Khadjavi-Scharaschkin; and (iii) the fact that the bipartite\nbrane-tiling/dimer model for a gauge theory with toric moduli space is a\nparticular dessin d'enfant in the sense of Grothendieck.\n  We explore this correspondence for the highest quality ABC-triples as well as\nlarge samples of random triples. The Conjecture itself is mapped to a statement\nabout the fundamental domain of the toroidal compactification of the string\nrealization of N=4 SYM.\n", "  We develop a method to parameterize elastic-scattering phase-shifts for\ncharged nuclei, based on Pad\\'e expansions of a simplified effective-range\nfunction. The method is potential independent and the input is reduced to\nexperimental phase shifts and bound-state energies. It allows a simple\ncalculation of resonance properties and of asymptotic normalization constants\n(ANCs) of subthreshold bound states. We analyze the $1^-$ and $2^+$ phase\nshifts of the $^{12}$C$+\\alpha$ system and extract the ANCs of the\ncorresponding bound states. For the $1^-$ state, a factor-3 improvement with\nrespect to the best value available today is obtained, with a factor-10\nimprovement in reach. For the $2^+$ state, no improvement is obtained due to\nrelatively larger error bars on the experimental phase shifts.\n", "  Quantum computer has an amazing potential of fast information processing.\nHowever, realisation of a digital quantum computer is still a challenging\nproblem requiring highly accurate controls and key application strategies. Here\nwe propose a novel platform, quantum reservoir computing, to solve these issues\nsuccessfully by exploiting natural quantum dynamics, which is ubiquitous in\nlaboratories nowadays, for machine learning. In this framework, nonlinear\ndynamics including classical chaos can be universally emulated in quantum\nsystems. A number of numerical experiments show that quantum systems consisting\nof at most seven qubits possess computational capabilities comparable to\nconventional recurrent neural networks of 500 nodes. This discovery opens up a\nnew paradigm for information processing with artificial intelligence powered by\nquantum physics.\n", "  We develop a simple model to study classical fields on the background of a\nfluctuating spacetime volume. It is applied to formulate the stochastic\nEinstein equations with a perfect-fluid source. We investigate the particular\ncase of a stochastic Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, and show\nthat the resulting field equations can lead to solutions which avoid the\ninitial big bang singularity. By interpreting the fluctuations as the result of\nthe presence of a quantum spacetime, we conclude that classical singularities\ncan be avoided even within a stochastic model that include quantum effects in a\nvery simple manner.\n", "  A major breakthrough in our understanding of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) prompt\nemission physics occurred in the last few years, with the realization that a\nthermal component accompanies the over-all non-thermal prompt spectra. This\nthermal part is important by itself, as it provides direct probe of the physics\nin the innermost outflow regions. It further has an indirect importance, as a\nsource of seed photons for inverse-Compton scattering, thereby it contributes\nto the non-thermal part as well. In this short review, we highlight some key\nrecent developments. Observationally, although so far it was clearly identified\nonly in a minority of bursts, there are indirect evidence that thermal\ncomponent exists in a very large fraction of GRBs, possibly close to 100%.\nTheoretically, the existence of thermal component have a large number of\nimplications as a probe of underlying GRB physics. Some surprising implications\ninclude its use as a probe of the jet dynamics, geometry and magnetization.\n", "  We propose a test of single-scalar inflation based on using the well-measured\nscalar power spectrum to reconstruct the tensor power spectrum, up to a single\nintegration constant. Our test is a sort of integrated version of the\nsingle-scalar consistency relation. This sort of test can be used effectively,\neven when the tensor power spectrum is measured too poorly to resolve the\ntensor spectral index. We give an example using simulated data based on a\nhypothetical detection with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 0.01$. Our test can\nalso be employed for correlating scalar and tensor features in the far future\nwhen the data is good.\n", "  By studying the zero-temperature and nonzero-temperature phase diagrams of\nthe ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Hubbard model under an external magnetic field,\nwe find that the competition between ferromagnetism and the quadratic Zeeman\nenergy yields two superfluid phases, which feature discontinuous first-order\nphase transitions between them for a strongly spinor Bose gas such as ${}^7$Li,\ncontrary to the corresponding continuum system.\n", "  We simulate neutralino dark matter ($\\chi$DM) haloes from their initial\ncollapse, at $\\sim$ earth mass, up to a few percent solar. Our results confirm\nthat the density profiles of the first haloes are described by a $\\sim\nr^{-1.5}$ power-law. As haloes grow in mass, their density profiles evolve\nsignificantly. In the central regions, they become shallower and reach on\naverage $\\sim r^{-1}$, the asymptotic form of an NFW profile. Using\nnon-cosmological controlled simulations, we observe that temporal variations in\nthe gravitational potential caused by major mergers lead to a shallowing of the\ninner profile. This transformation is more significant for shallower initial\nprofiles and for a higher number of merging systems. Depending on the merger\ndetails, the resulting profiles can be shallower or steeper than NFW in their\ninner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much weaker effect when the\nprofile is given by a broken power-law with an inner slope of $-1$ (such as NFW\nor Hernquist profiles). This offers an explanation for the emergence of\nNFW-like profiles: after their initial collapse, $r^{-1.5}$ $\\chi$DM haloes\nsuffer copious major mergers, which progressively shallows the profile. Once an\nNFW-like profile is established, subsequent merging do not change the profile\nanymore. This suggests that halo profiles are not universal but rather a\ncombination of (1) the physics of the formation of the microhaloes and (2)\ntheir early merger history -- both set by the properties of the dark matter\nparticle -- as well as (3) the resilience of NFW-like profiles to\nperturbations.\n", "  Within the framework of a flat cosmological model a propagation of an\ninstantaneous burst of isotropic radiation is considered from the moment of its\nbeginning at some initial redshift z0 to the moment of its registration now (at\nz=0). We take into account Thomson scattering by free electrons and scattering\nin La and Lb lines of primordial hydrogen and in lines 1s2 - 1s2p, 1s3p\n(1S-1P*) of HeI. It is shown that relative amplitude of spectrum distortions\ncaused by scattering in these lines may be from 1000 to 10000 times greater\nthan maximum possible amplitude due to scattering in subordinate lines\nconsidered in our previous paper (Dubrovich, Grachev, 2015). In a linear\napproximation on the optical thickness in the lines the profiles of distortions\nin resonance lines turn out to be purely in absorption and do not depend on\nboth direction and distance to the burst center in contradistinction to the\nprofiles in subordinate lines. The profiles contain jumps on frequencies\ncorresponding to appearance of a source (burst) at a given redshift z=z0. For\nz0=5000 the jumps in hydrogen La and Lb lines are on frequencies 493 and 584\nGHz respectively and jumps in two HeI lines are on 855 and 930 GHz for z0=6000.\nRelative magnitude of jumps amounts to 1e-4 - 3e-3.\n", "  The Fano lineshape arises from the interference of two excitation pathways to\nreach a continuum. Its generality has resulted in a tremendous success in\nexplaining the lineshapes of many one-dimensional spectroscopies - absorption,\nemission, scattering, conductance, photofragmentation - applied to very varied\nsystems - atoms, molecules, semiconductors and metals. Unravelling a\nspectroscopy into a second dimension reveals the relationship between states in\naddition to decongesting the spectra. Femtosecond-resolved two-dimensional\nelectronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a four-wave mixing technique that measures\nthe time-evolution of the populations, and coherences of excited states. It has\nbeen applied extensively to the dynamics of photosynthetic units, and more\nrecently to materials with extended band-structures. In this letter, we solve\nthe full time-dependent third-order response, measured in 2DES, of a Fano model\nand give the new system parameters that become accessible.\n", "  We evaluate the quasinormal modes of massless scalar field around\nReissner-Nordstr$\\ddot{\\text{o}}$m black hole surrounded by a static and\nspherically symmetric quintessence by using the continued fraction method. The\nappropriate Frobenius series for three special cases of the quintessence\nparameter $ \\epsilon = -1/3, -2/3$ and $-1$ are derived successfully. We show\nthat the variation of quasinormal frequencies with charge of the black hole and\nthe quintessential parameters. The numerical results show that quintessence\nfield decreases oscillation frequencies of all angular momentum $l$ modes and\nincreases the damping time of $l>0$ modes.\n", "  In this letter, we quantify the challenge of explaining the baryon asymmetry\nusing initial conditions in a universe that undergoes inflation. Contrary to\nlore, we find that such an explanation is possible if net $B-L$ number is\nstored in a light bosonic field with hyper-Planckian initial displacement and a\ndelicately chosen field velocity prior to inflation. However, such a\nconstruction may require extremely tuned coupling constants to ensure that this\nasymmetry is viably communicated to the Standard Model after reheating; the\nlarge field displacement required to overcome inflationary dilution must not\ninduce masses for Standard Model particles or generate dangerous washout\nprocesses. While these features are inelegant, this counterexample nonetheless\nshows that there is no theorem against such an explanation. We also comment on\npotential observables in the double $\\beta$-decay spectrum and on model\nvariations that may allow for more natural realizations.\n", "  We derive new black hole solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-Axion-Dilaton theory\nwith a hyperscaling violation exponent. We then examine the corresponding\nanomalous transport exhibited by cuprate strange metals in the normal phase of\nhigh-temperature superconductors via gauge/gravity duality. Linear temperature\ndependence resistivity and quadratic temperature dependence inverse Hall angle\ncan be achieved. In the high temperature regime, the heat conductivity and Hall\nLorenz ratio are proportional to the temperature. The Nernst signal first\nincreases as temperature goes up but it then decreases with increasing\ntemperature in the high temperature regime.\n", "  An orthogonal product basis (OPB) of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space\n$H=H_1\\otimes H_2\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes H_n$ is an orthonormal basis of $H$\nconsisting of product vectors $x_1\\otimes x_2\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes x_n$. We show\nthat the problem of classifying the OPBs of an $n$-qubit system can be reduced\nto a purely combinatorial problem. We solve this combinatorial problem in the\ncase of four qubits and obtain 33 multiparameter families of OPBs. Each OPB of\nfour qubits is equivalent, under local unitary operations and qubit\npermutations, to an OPB belonging to at least one of these families.\n", "  Excursion set theory (EST) is an analytical framework to study the\nlarge-scale structure of the Universe. EST introduces a procedure to calculate\nthe number density of structures by relating the cosmological linear\nperturbation theory to the nonlinear structures in late time. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel approach to reformulate the EST in matrix formalism. We\npropose that the matrix representation of EST will facilitate the calculations\nin this framework. The method is to discretize the two-dimensional plane of\nvariance and density contrast of EST, where the trajectories for each point in\nthe Universe lived there. The probability of having a density contrast in a\nchosen variance is represented by a probability ket. Naturally, the concept of\nthe transition matrix pops up to define the trajectories. We also define the\nprobability transition rate which is used to obtain the first up-crossing of\ntrajectories and the number count of the structures. In this work we show that\nthe discretization let us study the non-Markov processes by forcing them to\nlook like a Wiener process. Also we discuss that the zero drift processes with\nGaussian and also non-Gaussian initial conditions can be studied by this\nformalism. The continuous limit of the formalism is discussed, and the known\nFokker-Planck dispersion equation is recovered. Finally we show that the\nprobability of the most massive progenitors can be extracted in this framework.\n", "  Within the Standard Model with non-linearly realised electroweak symmetry,\nthe LHC Higgs boson may reside in a singlet representation of the gauge group.\nSeveral new interactions are then allowed, including anomalous Higgs\nself-couplings, which may drive the electroweak phase transition to be strongly\nfirst-order. In this paper we investigate the cosmological electroweak phase\ntransition in a simplified model with an anomalous Higgs cubic self- coupling.\nWe look at the feasibility of detecting gravitational waves produced during\nsuch a transition in the early universe by future space-based experiments. We\nfind that for the range of relatively large cubic couplings, $111~{\\rm GeV}~\n\\lesssim |\\kappa| \\lesssim 118~{\\rm GeV}$, $\\sim $mHz frequency gravitational\nwaves can be observed by eLISA, while BBO will potentially be able to detect\nwaves in a wider frequency range, $0.1-10~$mHz.\n", "  We present a theoretical model aimed at explaining the IRX-$\\beta$ relation\nfor high redshift (z >5) galaxies. Recent observations (Capak+2015;\nBouwens+2016) have shown that early Lyman Break Galaxies, although\ncharacterized by a large UV attenuation (e.g. flat UV beta slopes), show a\nstriking FIR deficit, i.e. they are \"infrared-dark\". This marked deviation from\nthe local IRX-beta relation can be explained by the larger molecular gas\ncontent of these systems. While dust in the diffuse ISM attains relatively high\ntemperatures (Td = 45 K for typical size a=0.1 um; smaller grains can reach Td\n= 60 K), a sizable fraction of the dust mass is embedded in dense gas, and\ntherefore remains cold. If confirmed, the FIR deficit might represent a novel,\npowerful indicator of the molecular content of high-z galaxies which can be\nused to pre-select candidates for follow-up deep CO observations. Thus, high-z\nCO line searches with ALMA might be much more promising than currently thought.\n", "  Despite the large number of studies on synchronization, the hypothesis that\ninteractions bear a cost for involved individuals has been considered seldom.\nThe introduction of costly interactions leads, instead, to the formulation of a\ndichotomous scenario in which an individual may decide to cooperate and pay the\ncost in order to get synchronized with the rest of the population.\nAlternatively, the same individual can decide to free ride, without incurring\nin any cost, waiting that others get synchronized to her state. The emergence\nof synchronization may thus be seen as the byproduct of an evolutionary game in\nwhich individuals decide their behavior according to the benefit/cost ratio\nthey accrue in the past. We study the onset of cooperation/synchronization in\nnetworked populations of Kuramoto oscillators and report how topology is\nessential in order for cooperation to thrive. We display also how different\nclasses of topology foster differently synchronization both at a microscopic\nand macroscopic level.\n", "  Quantum control is valuable for various quantum technologies such as\nhigh-fidelity gates for universal quantum computing, adaptive quantum-enhanced\nmetrology, and ultra-cold atom manipulation. Although supervised machine\nlearning and reinforcement learning are widely used for optimizing control\nparameters in classical systems, quantum control for parameter optimization is\nmainly pursued via gradient-based greedy algorithms. Although the quantum\nfitness landscape is often compatible with greedy algorithms, sometimes greedy\nalgorithms yield poor results, especially for large-dimensional quantum\nsystems. We employ differential evolution algorithms to circumvent the\nstagnation problem of non-convex optimization. We improve quantum control\nfidelity for noisy system by averaging over the objective function. To reduce\ncomputational cost, we introduce heuristics for early termination of runs and\nfor adaptive selection of search subspaces. Our implementation is massively\nparallel and vectorized to reduce run time even further. We demonstrate our\nmethods with two examples, namely quantum phase estimation and quantum gate\ndesign, for which we achieve superior fidelity and scalability than obtained\nusing greedy algorithms.\n", "  There is a growing effort in creating chiral transport of sound waves.\nHowever, most approaches so far are confined to the macroscopic scale. Here, we\npropose a new approach suitable to the nanoscale which is based on\npseudomagnetic fields. These fields are the analogon for sound of the\npseudomagnetic field for electrons in strained graphene. In our proposal, they\nare created by simple geometrical modifications of an existing and\nexperimentally proven phononic crystal design, the snowflake crystal. This\nplatform is robust, scalable, and well-suited for a variety of excitation and\nreadout mechanisms, among them optomechanical approaches.\n", "  Symmetry protected Dirac semimetals can be transformed into Weyl semimetals\nby breaking the protecting symmetry, leading to many exotic quantum phenomena\nsuch as chiral anomaly and anomalous Hall effect. Here we show that, due to the\nlarge Zeeman g factor and small band width along b-axis in Dirac semimetal\nZrTe5, a magnetic field of about 8 T along b-axis direction may annihilate the\nWeyl points and open up a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac mass gap, when the Zeeman\nsplitting exceeds the band width along b-axis. This is manifested by a sharp\ndrop of magnetoresistance (MR) above 8 T, which is probably due to additional\ncarriers induced by the orbital splitting of the zeroth Landau level associated\nwith the 2D Dirac point, which is descendant of the original Weyl points.\nFurther evidence of the additional carriers is provided by the Hall effect and\ndifferent anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in low and high field regions.\nOur experiment reveals a probable topological quantum phase transition of field\ninduced Weyl points annihilation in Dirac semimetal ZrTe5 and gives an\nalternative explanation for the drop of MR at high field.\n", "  We give a recipe for computing correlation functions of the displacement\noperator localized on a spherical or planar higher dimensional twist defect\nusing AdS/CFT. Such twist operators are typically used to construct the $n$'th\nRenyi entropies of spatial entanglement in CFTs and are holographically dual to\nblack holes with hyperbolic horizons. The displacement operator then tells us\nhow the Renyi entropies change under small shape deformations of the entangling\nsurface. We explicitly construct the bulk to boundary propagator for the\ndisplacement operator insertion as a linearized metric fluctuation of the\nhyperbolic black hole and use this to extract the coefficient of the\ndisplacement operator two point function $C_D$ in any dimension. The $n\n\\rightarrow 1$ limit of the twist displacement operator gives the same bulk\nresponse as the insertion of a null energy operator in vacuum, which is\nconsistent with recent results on the shape dependence of entanglement entropy\nand modular energy.\n", "  Topological phase transitions, which have fascinated generations of\nphysicists, are always demarcated by gap closures. In this work, we propose\nvery simple 2D photonic crystal lattices with gap closure points, i.e. band\ndegeneracies protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry. Our photonic structures are\nrelatively easy to fabricate, consisting of two inequivalent dielectric\ncylinders per unit cell. Along high symmetry directions, they exhibit line\ndegeneracies protected by glide reflection symmetry, which we explicitly\ndemonstrate for $pg,pmg,pgg$ and $p4g$ nonsymmorphic groups. In the presence of\ntime reversal symmetry, they also exhibit point degeneracies (Dirac points)\nprotected by a $Z_2$ topological number associated with crystalline symmetry.\nStrikingly, the robust protection of $pg$-symmetry allows a Lifshitz transition\nto a type II Dirac cone across a wide range of experimentally accessible\nparameters, thus providing a convenient route for realizing anomalous\nrefraction. Further potential applications include a stoplight device based on\nelectrically induced strain that dynamically switches the lattice symmetry from\n$pgg$ to the higher $p4g$ symmetry. This controls the coalescence of Dirac\npoints and hence the group velocity within the crystal.\n", "  Starting from interaction rules based on two levels of stochasticity we study\nthe influence of the microscopic dynamics on the macroscopic properties of\nvehicular flow. In particular, we study the qualitative structure of the\nresulting flux-density and speed-density diagrams for different choices of the\ndesired speeds. We are able to recover multivalued diagrams as a result of the\nexistence of a one-parameter family of stationary distributions, whose\nexpression is analytically found by means of a Fokker-Planck approximation of\nthe initial Boltzmann-type model.\n", "  We study radial perturbations of a wormhole in $R^2$ gravity to determine\nregions of stability. We also investigate massive and massless particle orbits\nand tidal forces in this space-time for a radially infalling observer.\n", "  We prove that the uniform infinite half-plane quadrangulation (UIHPQ), with\neither general or simple boundary, equipped with its graph distance, its\nnatural area measure, and the curve which traces its boundary, converges in the\nscaling limit to the Brownian half-plane. The topology of convergence is given\nby the so-called Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov-uniform (GHPU) metric on\ncurve-decorated metric measure spaces, which is a generalization of the\nGromov-Hausdorff metric whereby two such spaces $(X_1, d_1 , \\mu_1,\\eta_1)$ and\n$(X_2, d_2 , \\mu_2,\\eta_2)$ are close if they can be isometrically embedded\ninto a common metric space in such a way that the spaces $X_1$ and $X_2$ are\nclose in the Hausdorff distance, the measures $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are close in\nthe Prokhorov distance, and the curves $\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_2$ are close in the\nuniform distance.\n", "  This paper reports a start-to-end study of suppression of stored beam\noscillation at PLS-II. We report that the fast counter-kicker implemented in\nPLS-II suppressed vertical oscillation of the stored beam. During top-up\ninjection in the magnetic spectroscopy beamline of PLS-II, the stored beam\noscillation was suppressed by a factor of nine, and flux was improved by a\nfactor of three.\n", "  The conundrum parameter-operator of time in quantum mechanics (QM), as well\nas the time-energy uncertainty relation and the tunneling delay time, have\nrecently been addressed in attosecond optical ioniza- tion experiments. The\nparameter status of time in the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) is\nsupported by the well-known Pauli's ob- jection as well as by its\ninterpretation as an emerging property of entangle- ment with a classical\nenvironment. On the other hand, the introduction of a self-adjoint dynamical\ntime operator in Dirac's formulation of elec- tron's relativistic quantum\nmechanics (RQM), yields an additional system observable that represents an\ninternal time. In the present paper the re- lation of this internal time with\nthe parametric (laboratory) time and its relevance to the tunneling\nmeasurements in these experiments is examined within the standard framework of\nRQM.\n", "  In light of the Higgs boson discovery, we explore mono-Higgs signature in\nassociation with dark matter pair production at the LHC in a renormalizable\nmodel with a fermionic dark matter candidate. For two channels with\n$\\gamma\\gamma+\\text{MET}$ and $b \\bar b+\\text{MET}$ in the final state we\nsimulate the SM backgrounds and signal events at $\\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV. We then\nestimate the LHC sensitivities for various benchmark points for two integrated\nluminosities ${\\cal L} = 300~\\text{fb}^{-1}$ and ${\\cal L} = 3~\n\\text{ab}^{-1}$. We constrain the Yukawa coupling of the dark matter-SM\ninteraction, taking into account bounds from mono-Higgs signature, observed\ndark matter relic density, Higgs physics, perturbativity requirement and\nelectroweak measurements. Concerning the mono-Higgs search, it turns out that\nthe channel with the largest branching ratio, $b \\bar b$ channel, provides\nbetter sensitivity. There are found regions in the parameter space of the model\ncompatible with all the bounds mentioned above which can be reached in future\nLHC studies.\n", "  We report on the nonequilibrium dynamics of the electronic structure of the\nlayered semiconductor Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ investigated by time- and angle-resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy. We show that below the critical excitation density\nof $F_{C} = 0.2$ mJ cm$^{-2}$, the band gap $narrows$ transiently, while it is\n$enhanced$ above $F_{C}$. Hartree-Fock calculations reveal that this effect can\nbe explained by the presence of the low-temperature excitonic insulator phase\nof Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, whose order parameter is connected to the gap size. This\nwork demonstrates the ability to manipulate the band gap of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ with\nlight on the femtosecond time scale.\n", "  We study the Fock quantization of a free Dirac field in 2+1-dimensional\nbackgrounds which are conformally ultrastatic, with a time-dependent conformal\nfactor. As it is typical for field theories, there is an infinite ambiguity in\nthe Fock representation of the canonical anticommutation relations. Different\nchoices may lead to unitarily inequivalent theories that describe different\nphysics. To remove this ambiguity one usually requires that the vacuum be\ninvariant under the unitary transformations that implement the symmetries of\nthe equations of motion. However, in non-stationary backgrounds, where time\ntranslation is not a symmetry transformation, the requirement of vacuum\ninvariance is in general not enough to fix completely the Fock representation.\nWe show that this problem is overcome in the considered scenario by demanding,\nin addition, a unitarily implementable quantum dynamics. The combined\nimposition of these conditions selects a unique family of equivalent Fock\nrepresentations. Moreover, one also obtains an essentially unique splitting of\nthe time variation of the Dirac field into an explicit dependence on the\nbackground scale factor and a quantum evolution of the corresponding creation\nand annihilation operators.\n", "  A new class of exact electrostatic solutions of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations\nbased on the Jeans's theorem is proposed for studying the evolution and\nproperties of two-dimensional anisotropic plasmas that are far from\nthermodynamic equilibrium. In particular, the free expansion of a slab of\nelectron-ion plasma into vacuum is investigated.\n", "  We present calculations for the $c$-coefficients of the isobaric mass\nmultiplet equation for nuclei from $A=42$ to $A=54$ based on input from three\nrealistic nucleon-nucleon interactions. We demonstrate that there is a clear\ndependence on the short-ranged charge-symmetry breaking (CSB) part of the\nstrong interaction and that there is significant disagreement in the CSB part\nbetween the commonly used CD-Bonn, N$^3$LO, and Argonne V18 nucleon-nucleon\ninteractions. In addition, we show that all three interactions give a CSB\ncontribution to the $c$-coefficient that is too large when compared to\nexperiment.\n", "  We conduct a linear stability calculation of an ideal Keplerian flow on which\na sinusoidal zonal flow is imposed. The analysis uses the shearing sheet model\nand is carried out both in isothermal and adiabatic conditions, with and\nwithout self-gravity (SG). In the non-SG regime a structure in the potential\nvorticity (PV) leads to a non-axisymmetric Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability;\nin the short-wavelength limit its growth rate agrees with the incompressible\ncalculation by Lithwick (2007), which only considers perturbations elongated in\nthe streamwise direction. The instability's strength is analysed as a function\nof the structure's properties, and zonal flows are found to be stable if their\nwavelength is $\\gtrsim 8H$, where $H$ is the disc's scale height, regardless of\nthe value of the adiabatic index $\\gamma$. The non-axisymmetric KH instability\ncan operate in Rayleigh-stable conditions, and it therefore represents the\nlimiting factor to the structure's properties. Introducing SG triggers a second\nnon-axisymmetric instability, which is found to be located around a PV maximum,\nwhile the KH instability is linked to a PV minimum, as expected. In the\nadiabatic regime, the same gravitational instability is detected even when the\nstructure is present only in the entropy (not in the PV) and the instability\nspreads to weaker SG conditions as the entropy structure's amplitude is\nincreased. This eventually yields a non-axisymmetric instability in the non-SG\nregime, albeit of weak strength, localised around an entropy maximum.\n", "  Since the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider, a future\nelectron-position collider has been proposed for precisely studying its\nproperties. We investigate the production of the Higgs boson at such an\n$e^+e^-$ collider associated with a $Z$ boson, and calculate for the first time\nthe mixed QCD-electroweak corrections to the total cross sections. We provide\nan approximate analytic formula for the cross section and show that it\nreproduces the exact numeric results rather well for collider energies up to\n350 GeV. We also provide numeric results for $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, where the\napproximate formula is no longer valid. We find that the\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha\\alpha_s)$ corrections amount to a 1.3% increase of the\ncross section for a center-of-mass energy around 240 GeV. This is significantly\nlarger than the expected experimental accuracy and has to be included for\nextracting the properties of the Higgs boson from the measurements of the cross\nsections in the future.\n", "  We perform the first systematic study on how dynamical stellar tides and\ngeneral relativistic (GR) effects affect the dynamics and outcomes of\nbinary-single interactions. For this, we have constructed an N-body code that\nincludes tides in the affine approximation, where stars are modeled as\nself-similar ellipsoidal polytropes, and GR corrections using the commonly-used\npost-Newtonian formalism. Using this numerical formalism, we are able resolve\nthe leading effect from tides and GR across several orders of magnitude in both\nstellar radius and initial target binary separation. We find that the main\neffect from tides is the formation of two-body tidal captures that form during\nthe chaotic and resonant evolution of the triple system. The two stars\nundergoing the capture spiral in and merge. The inclusion of tides can thus\nlead to an increase on the stellar coalescence rate. We also develop an\nanalytical framework for calculating the cross section of tidal inspirals\nbetween any pair of objects with similar mass. From our analytical and\nnumerical estimates we find that the rate of tidal inspirals relative to\ncollisions increases as the initial semi-major axis of the target binary\nincreases and the radius of the interacting tidal objects decreases. The\nlargest effect is therefore found for triple systems hosting white dwarfs and\nneutron stars. In this case, we find the rate of highly eccentric white dwarf -\nneutron star mergers to likely be dominated by tidal inspirals. While tidal\ninspirals occur rarely, we note that they can give rise to a plethora of\nthermonuclear transients such as Ca-rich transients.\n", "  We present the results of our $UBV$ and $JHKLM$-photometry for the\nsemiregular pulsating variable V1027~Cyg, a supergiant with an infrared excess,\nover the period from 1991 to 2015. Our search for a periodicity in the $UBV$\nbrightness variations has led to several periods from $P=212^{d}$ to\n$P=320^{d}$ in different time intervals. We have found the period $P=237^{d}$\nbased on our infrared photometry. The variability amplitude, the light-curve\nshape, and the magnitude of V1027~Cyg at maximum light change noticeably from\ncycle to cycle. An ambiguous correlation of the $B-V$ and $U-B$ colors with the\nbrightness has been revealed. The spectral energy distribution for V1027~Cyg\nfrom our photometry in the range 0.36 ($U$)-5.0 ($M$) $\\mu$m corresponds to\nspectral types from G8I to K3I at different phases of the pulsation cycle.\nLow-resolution spectra of V1027 Cyg in the range $\\lambda$4400--9200 \\AA\\ were\ntaken during 16 nights over the period 1995--2015. At the 1995 and 2011\nphotometric minima the star's spectrum exhibited molecular TiO bands whose\nintensity corresponded to spectral types M0--M1, while the photometric data\npoint to a considerably earlier spectral type. We hypothesize that the TiO\nbands are formed in the upper layers of the extended stellar atmosphere. We\nhave measured the equivalent widths of the strongest absorption lines, in\nparticular, the infrared Ca~II triplet in the spectrum of V1027~Cyg. The\ncalcium triplet (Ca T) with $W_{\\lambda}(\\mathrm{Ca~T})=20.3\\pm1.8$ \\AA\\ as a\nluminosity indicator for supergiants places V1027 Cyg in the region of the\nbrightest G--K supergiants. V1027 Cyg has been identified with the infrared\nsource IRAS~20004+2955 and is currently believed to be a candidate for post-AGB\nstars. The evolutionary status of the star and its difference from other\npost-AGB objects are discussed.\n", "  We present a study on the impact of scalar leptoquarks on the semileptonic\ndecays of $ \\Lambda_b$, $\\Sigma_b $ and $\\Xi_b $. To this end, we calculate the\ndifferential branching ratio and lepton forward-backward asymmetry defining the\nprocesses $ \\Lambda_b \\rightarrow \\Lambda \\ell^+ \\ell^-$, $\\Sigma_b \\rightarrow\n\\Sigma \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ and $\\Xi_b \\rightarrow \\Xi \\ell^+ \\ell^-$, with $\\ell$\nbeing $\\mu$ or $\\tau$, using the form factors calculated via light cone QCD in\nfull theory. In calculations, the errors of form factors are taken into\naccount. We compare the results obtained in leptoquark model with those of the\nstandard model as well as the existing lattice QCD predictions and experimental\ndata.\n", "  A recent surge in the discovery of new ultrafaint dwarf satellites of the\nMilky Way has inspired the idea of searching for faint satellites, $10^3\\,\n\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}} < M_* < 10^6\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, around less massive\nfield galaxies in the Local Group. Such satellites would be subject to weaker\nenvironmental influences than Milky Way satellites, and could lead to new\ninsights on low mass galaxy formation. In this paper, we predict the number of\nluminous satellites expected around field dwarf galaxies by applying several\nabundance matching models and a reionization model to the dark-matter only\n\\textit{Caterpillar} simulation suite. For three of the four abundance matching\nmodels used, we find a $>99\\%$ chance that at least one satellite with stellar\nmass $M_*> 10^5\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ exists around the combined five Local\nGroup field dwarf galaxies with the largest stellar mass. When considering\nsatellites with $M_*> 10^4\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, we predict a combined $5-25$\nsatellites for the five largest field dwarfs, and $10-50$ for the whole Local\nGroup field dwarf population. Because of the relatively small number of\npredicted dwarfs, and their extended spatial distribution, a large fraction\neach Local Group dwarf's virial volume will need to be surveyed to guarantee\ndiscoveries. We compute the predicted number of satellites in a given field of\nview of specific Local Group galaxies, as a function of minimum satellite\nluminosity, and explicitly obtain such values for the Solitary Local dwarfs\nsurvey. Uncertainties in abundance matching and reionization models are large,\nimplying that comprehensive searches could lead to refinements of both models.\n", "  Macroscopic theories of nucleation such as classical nucleation theory\nenvision that clusters of the bulk stable phase form inside the bulk metastable\nphase. Molecular dynamics simulations are often used to elucidate nucleation\nmechanisms, by capturing the microscopic configurations of all the atoms. In\nthis letter, we introduce a thermodynamic model that links macroscopic theories\nand atomic-scale simulations and thus provide a simple and elegant framework\nfor testing the limits of classical nucleation theory.\n", "  We study the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism for generating baryon\nasymmetry in the context of running vacuum models. Regardless if these models\ncan produce a viable cosmological evolution, we demonstrate that they produce a\nnon-zero baryon-to-entropy ratio even if the universe is filled with conformal\nmatter. This is a sound difference between the running vacuum gravitational\nbaryogenesis and the Einstein-Hilbert one, since in the latter case, the\npredicted baryon-to-entropy ratio is zero. We consider two well known and most\nused running vacuum models and show that the resulting baryon-to-entropy ratio\nis compatible with the observational data. Moreover, we also show that the\nmechanism of gravitational baryogenesis may constrain the running vacuum\nmodels.\n", "  In order to draw scientific conclusions from observations of cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) polarization, it is necessary to separate the contributions of\nthe E and B components of the data. For data with incomplete sky coverage,\nthere are ambiguous modes, which can be sourced by either E or B signals.\nTechniques exist for producing \"pure\" E and B maps, which are guaranteed to be\nfree of cross-contamination, although the standard method, which involves\nconstructing an eigenbasis, has a high computational cost. We show that such\npure maps can be thought of as resulting from the application of a Wiener\nfilter to the data. This perspective leads to far more efficient methods of\nproducing pure maps. Moreover, by expressing the idea of purification in the\ngeneral framework of Wiener filtering (i.e., maximization of a posterior\nprobability), it leads to a variety of generalizations of the notion of pure E\nand B maps, e.g., accounting for noise or other contaminants in the data as\nwell as correlations with temperature anisotropy.\n", "  We discuss quantum field theories with global $SU(N)$ and $O(N)$ symmetries\nfor which the temporal direction is compactified on a circle of size $L$ with\nperiodicity of fields up to a global symmetry transformation, i.e. twisted\nboundary conditions. Such boundary conditions correspond to an insertion of the\nglobal symmetry operator in the partition function. We argue that for a special\nchoice of twists most of the excited states get projected out, leaving only\neither mesonic states or states whose energy scales with $N$. When\n$N\\rightarrow \\infty$ all excitations become suppressed at any compact radius\nand the twisted partition function gets a contribution from the ground-state\nonly, rendering observables independent of the radius of compactification, i.e.\nvolume independent. We explicitly prove that this is indeed the case for the\n$CP(N-1)$ and $O(N)$ non-linear sigma models in any number of dimensions. We\nfurther focus on the two-dimensional $CP(N-1)$ case which is asymptotically\nfree, and demonstrate, unlike its thermal counterpart, the twisted theory has\ncommuting $N\\rightarrow\\infty,L\\rightarrow\\infty$ limits and does not undergo a\nsecond-order phase transition at \"zero-temperature\" discussed by Affleck long\nago. At finite $L$ the theory is described by an effective, zero-temperature\nquantum mechanics with smoothly varying parameters depending on $L$,\neliminating the possibility of a phase transition at any $L$, which was\nconjectured by \\\"Unsal and Dunne. As $L$ is decreased at fixed and finite $N$\nthe relevant objects dictating the $\\theta$ dependence are quantum\nkink-instantons, avatars of the small $L$ regime fractional instantons. These\nconsiderations, for the first time establishes the idea of adiabatic continuity\nadvocated by \\\"Unsal et. al.\n", "  Inspired by the idea of mimicking the measurement on a quantum system through\na decoherence process to target specific eigenstates based on Born's law, i.e.\nthe hiearchy of probabilities instead of the hierarchy of eigenvalues, we\ntransform a Lindblad equation for the reduced density operator into a nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation to obtain a computationally feasible simulation of the\ndecoherent dynamics in the open quantum system. This gives the opportunity to\ntarget the eigenstates which have the largest $L^2$ overlap with an initial\nsuperposition state and hence more flexibility in the selection criteria. One\ncan use this feature for instance to approximate eigenstates with certain\nlocalization or symmetry properties. As an application of the theory we discuss\n\\textit{eigenstate towing}, which relies on the perturbation theory to follow\nthe progression of an arbitrary subset of eigenstates along a sum of\nperturbation operators with the intention to explore for example the effect of\ninteractions on these eigenstates. The easily parallelizable numerical method\nshows an exponential convergence and its computational costs scale linear for\nsparse matrix representations of the involved Hermitian operators.\n", "  Hashkat (http://hashkat.org) is a free, open source, agent based simulation\nsoftware package designed to simulate large-scale online social networks (e.g.\nTwitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc). It allows for dynamic agent generation, edge\ncreation, and information propagation. The purpose of hashkat is to study the\ngrowth of online social networks and how information flows within them. Like\nreal life online social networks, hashkat incorporates user relationships,\ninformation diffusion, and trending topics. Hashkat was implemented in C++, and\nwas designed with extensibility in mind. The software includes Shell and Python\nscripts for easy installation and usability. In this report, we describe all of\nthe algorithms and features integrated into hashkat before moving on to example\nuse cases. In general, hashkat can be used to understand the underlying\ntopology of social networks, validate sampling methods of such networks,\ndevelop business strategy for advertising on online social networks, and test\nnew features of an online social network before going into production.\n", "  The iron spin crossover in ferropericlase introduces anomalies in its\nthermodynamics and thermoelastic properties. Here we investigate how these\nanomalies can affect the lower mantle geotherm. The effect is examined in\nmantle aggregates consisting of mixtures of bridgmanite, ferropericlase, and\nCaSiO$_3$ perovskite, with different Mg/Si ratios varying from harzburgitic to\nperovskitic (Mg/Si$\\sim$1.5 to 0.8). We find that the anomalies introduced by\nthe spin crossover increase the isentropic gradient and thus the geotherm\nproportionally to the amount of ferropericlase. The geotherms can be as much as\n$\\sim$ 200K hotter than the conventional adiabatic geotherm at deep lower\nmantle conditions. Aggregate elastic moduli and seismic velocities are also\nsensitive to the spin crossover and the geotherm, which impacts analyses of\nlower mantle velocities and composition.\n", "  In a two-week period between February and March of 2015, a series of\ninterplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and (solar energetic particles)\nSEPs made contact with Mars. The interactions were observed by several\nspacecraft, including Mars Express (MEX), Mars Atmosphere and Volatile\nEvolution Mission (MAVEN), and Mars Odyssey (MO). The ICME disturbances were\ncharacterized by an increase in ion speed, plasma temperature, magnetic field\nmagnitude, and energetic electron flux. Furthermore, increased solar wind\ndensity and speeds, unusually high local electron densities and high flow\nvelocities were detected on the nightside at high altitudes during the March\n8th event. These effects are thought to be due to the transport of ionospheric\nplasma away from Mars. The peak electron density at periapsis shows a\nsubstantial increase, reaching number densities about 2.7 x 104 cm-3 during the\nsecond ICME in the deep nightside, which corresponds to an increase in the\nMOHigh-Energy Neutron Detector flux, suggesting an increase in the ionization\nof the neutral atmosphere due to the high intensity of charged particles. SEPs\nshow a substantial enhancement before the shock of fourth ICME causing impact\nionization and absorption of the surface echo intensity which drops to the\nnoise levels. Moreover, the peak ionospheric density exhibits a discrete\nenhancement over a period of about 30 hrs around the same location, which maybe\ndue to impact ionization. Ion escape rates at this time are calculated to be in\nthe order of 1025 - 1026 s-1, consistent with MAVEN results, but somewhat\nhigher.\n", "  Internal shocks between propagating plasma shells, originally ejected at\ndifferent times with different velocities are believed to play a major role in\ndissipating the kinetic energy, thereby explaining the observed lightcurve and\nspectra in a large range of transient objects. Even if initially the colliding\nplasmas are cold, following the first collision the plasma shells are\nsubstantially heated, implying that in a scenario of multiple collisions, most\ncollisions take place between plasmas of non-zero temperatures. Here, we\ncalculate the dynamical properties of plasmas resulting from collision between\narbitrarily hot plasma shells, moving at arbitrary speeds. We provide simple\nanalytical expressions valid for both the ultra-relativistic and Newtonian\nvelocities, for both hot and cold plasmas. We derive the minimum criteria\nrequired for the formation of the two-shock wave system, and show that in the\nrelativistic limit, the minimum Lorentz factor is proportional to the square\nroot of the ratio of the initial plasmas enthalpies. We provide basic scaling\nlaws of synchrotron emission from both the forward and reverse shock waves, and\nshow how these can be used to deduce the properties of the colliding shells.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of these results in the study of several\nastronomical transients, such as x-ray binaries, radio load quasars and\ngamma-ray bursts.\n", "  We present a lattice calculation of the decay constants and masses of\n$D_{(s)}^*$ and $B_{(s)}^*$ mesons using the gauge configurations produced by\nthe European Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ dynamical\nquarks and at three values of the lattice spacing $a \\sim 0.06 - 0.09$ fm. Pion\nmasses are simulated in the range $m_{\\pi} \\sim 210 - 450$ MeV, while the\nstrange and charm quark masses are close to their physical values. We computed\nthe ratios of vector to pseudoscalar decay constants or masses for various\nvalues of the heavy-quark mass $m_h$ in the range $0.7 m_c^{phys} \\lesssim m_h\n\\lesssim 3 m_c^{phys}$. In order to reach the physical b-quark mass, we\nexploited the HQET prediction that, in the static limit of infinite heavy-quark\nmass, all the considered ratios are equal to one. We obtain: $ f_{D^*}/f_{D} =\n1.078(36),$ $m_{D^*}/m_{D} = 1.0769(79)$, $f_{D^*_{s}}/f_{D_{s}} = 1.087(20)$,\n$m_{D^*_{s}}m_{D_{s}} = 1.0751(56)$, $f_{B^*}/f_{B} = 0.958(22)$,\n$m_{B^*}/m_{B} = 1.0078(15)$, $f_{B^*_{s}}/f_{B_{s}} = 0.974(10)$ and\n$m_{B^*_{s}}/m_{B_{s}} = 1.0083(10)$. Combining them with the corresponding\nexperimental masses from the PDG and the pseudoscalar decay constants\ncalculated by ETMC, we get: $f_{D^*} = 223.5(8.4)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, $m_{D^*} =\n2013(14)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, $f_{D^*_{s}} = 268.8(6.6)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, $ m_{D^*_{s}}\n= 2116(11)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, $f_{B^*} = 185.9(7.2)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, $m_{B^*} =\n5320.5(7.6)~\\mathrm{MeV}$, $f_{B^*_{s}} = 223.1(5.4)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and\n$m_{B^*_{s}}= 5411.36(5.3)~\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n", "  In general, we can propose the hybrid supersymmetry breakings and hybrid\nmediations in the Supersymmetric Standard Models (SSMs). In this paper, we\nstudy the hybrid mediation for supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. In particular, we\nstudy how to keep the good properties of gravity mediation, gauge mediation,\nand anomaly mediation, while solve their problems simultaneously. As an\nexample, we consider the anomaly-gravity mediation, where all the\nsupersymmetric particles (sparticles) obtain the SUSY breaking soft terms from\nthe traditional gravity mediation while gauge mediation gives dominant\ncontributions to the soft terms in the colored sector due to the splitted\nmessengers. Thus, we can realize the electroweak supersymmetry naturally where\nthe sleptons, sneutrinos, and electroweakinos are light within one TeV while\nthe squarks and gluino are heavy around a few TeVs. And then we can explain 125\nGeV Higgs mass, satisfy the LHC SUSY search bounds, and explain the anomalous\nmagnetic momement of muon, etc. Moreover, the gluino and squarks are well\nbeyond the current LHC Run II searches.\n", "  This paper presents the non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) for modeling\nthe rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and other infrequently observed\nastronomical events. The NHPP, well-known in statistics, can model changes in\nthe rate as a function of both astronomical features and the details of an\nobserving campaign. This is particularly helpful for rare events like FRBs\nbecause the NHPP can combine information across surveys, making the most of all\navailable information. The goal of the paper is two-fold. First, it is intended\nto be a tutorial on the use of the NHPP. Second, we build an NHPP model that\nincorporates beam patterns and a power law flux distribution for the rate of\nFRBs. Using information from 12 surveys including 15 detections, we find an\nall-sky FRB rate of 586.88 events per sky per day above a flux of 1 Jy (95\\%\nCI: 271.86, 923.72) and a flux power-law index of 0.91 (95\\% CI: 0.57, 1.25).\nOur rate is lower than other published rates, but consistent with the rate\ngiven in Champion et al. 2016.\n", "  There are currently more than 5500 sinkholes along the Dead Sea in Israel.\nThese were formed due to the dissolution of subsurface salt layers as a result\nof the replacement of hypersaline groundwater by fresh brackish groundwater.\nThis process has been associated with a sharp decline in the Dead Sea water\nlevel, currently more than one meter per year, resulting in a lower water table\nthat has allowed the intrusion of fresher brackish water. We studied the\ndistribution of the sinkhole sizes and found that it is scale-free with a\npower-law exponent close to 2. We constructed a stochastic cellular automata\nmodel to understand the observed scale-free behavior and the growth of the\nsinkhole area in time. The model consists of a lower salt layer and an upper\nsoil layer in which cavities that develop in the lower layer lead to collapses\nin the upper layer. The model reproduces the observed power-law distribution\nwithout involving the threshold behavior commonly associated with criticality.\n", "  In the last decade, there has been remarkable progress on the practical\nintegration of on-chip quantum photonic devices yet quantum state generators\nremain an outstanding challenge. Simultaneously, the quantum-dot\nphotonic-crystal-resonator platform has demonstrated a versatility for creating\nnonclassical light with tunable quantum statistics, thanks to a newly\ndiscovered self-homodyning interferometric effect that preferentially selects\nthe quantum light over the classical light when using an optimally tuned Fano\nresonance. In this work, we propose a general structure for the cavity quantum\nelectrodynamical generation of quantum states from a waveguide-integrated\nversion of the quantum-dot photonic-crystal-resonator platform, which is\nspecifically tailored for preferential quantum state transmission. We support\nour results with rigorous Finite-Difference Time-Domain and quantum optical\nsimulations, and show how our proposed device can serve as a robust generator\nof highly pure single- and even multi-photon states.\n", "  Barkhausen effect in ferromagnetic materials provides an excellent area for\ninvestigating scaling phenomena found in disordered systems exhibiting\ncrackling noise. The critical dynamics is characterized by random pulses or\navalanches with scale-invariant properties, power-law distributions, and\nuniversal features. However, the traditional Barkhausen avalanches statistics\nmay not be sufficient to fully characterize the complex temporal correlation of\nthe magnetic domain walls dynamics. Here we go beyond power laws and focus on\nthe multifractal scenario to quantify the temporal scaling characteristics of\nBarkhausen avalanches in polycrystalline and amorphous ferromagnetic films with\nthicknesses from $50$ nm to $1000$ nm. We show that the multifractal properties\nare dependent on the film thickness, and insensitive to the structural\ncharacter of the materials. Further, we observe for the first time the collapse\nof the multifractality in the domain walls dynamics as the thickness is\nreduced, and the multifractal behavior gives place to a monofractal one over\nthe entire range of time scales. The reorganization in the temporal scaling\ncharacteristics of Barkhausen avalanches is understood as an universal\nrestructuring associated to the dimensional transition, from three to\ntwo-dimensional magnetization dynamics.\n", "  There have been continuous efforts in searching for unconventional\nsuperconductivity over the past five decades. Compared to the well-established\nd-wave superconductivity in cuprates, the existence of superconductivity with\nother high-angular-momentum pairing symmetries is less conclusive. Bi/Ni\nepitaxial bilayer is a potential unconventional superconductor with broken time\nreversal symmetry (TRS), for that it demonstrates superconductivity and\nferromagnetism simultaneously at low temperatures. We employ a specially\ndesigned superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) to detect, on the\nBi/Ni bilayer, the orbital magnetic moment which is expected if the TRS is\nbroken. An anomalous hysteretic magnetic response has been observed in the\nsuperconducting state, providing the evidence for the existence of chiral\nsuperconducting domains in the material.\n", "  We study the effects of considering nontrivial unphysical lepton sector\nphases on the group theoretical properties of the flavor and generalized CP\nsymmetry elements in the case where there are three light, distinct Majorana\nneutrino species. We highlight the similarities and differences between the\ncharged lepton and neutrino sectors and further elucidate the group properties\nof the flavor and generalized CP symmetry elements. We show how the inclusion\nof these leptonic phases affects the bottom-up constructions of these symmetry\nelements and discuss the implications for top-down model building based on\ndiscrete symmetry groups.\n", "  In unified models, different types of active galaxy nuclei correspond to a\nsingle class of objects, where their observed differences are solely due to the\ndifferent orientations of the obscuring material around the central inner\nregions. Recent studies also show that this obscuring material can even extend\nat galactic scales due to debris and/or mergers. In standard unified models the\ndifferent AGN types are expected to show similar galaxy environments. We aim to\ninvestigate properties and environment of obscured and unobscured AGNs selected\nfrom the MUSYC survey, in order to test the unified model and evolutionary\nscenarios. The sample of AGNs was selected from images obtained with the IRAC\nCamera, based on their MIR colors. We selected two samples of AGNs with\nredshifts in the range $1\\le z \\le 2$ and $M_v\\leq -$21: obscured and\nunobscured AGNs by means of a simple optical-MIR color cut criterion. We find\nthat obscured AGNs are intrinsically optically faint in the R band, suggesting\nthat luminous IR-selected AGNs have a significant dust extinction. From a\ncross-correlation with several X-ray surveys, we find that the majority of the\nAGNs have X-ray luminosities similar to those found in Seyfert-like galaxies.\nNeighbouring galaxies located close to ($\\sim$200 kpc) obscured AGNs tend to\nhave redder colors, compared to the local environment of unobscured AGNs.\nResults obtained from a KS test show that the two color distributions are\ndifferent at $\\sim$95% confidence level. We find that obscured AGNs are located\nin denser local galaxy environments compared to the unobscured AGN sample. Our\nresults suggest that AGN obscuration can occur at galactic scales, possibly due\nto galaxy interactions or mergers, and that the simple unified model based\nsolely on the local torus orientation may not be sufficient to explain all the\nobservations.\n", "  Inference of physical parameters from reference data is a well studied\nproblem with many intricacies (inconsistent sets of data due to experimental\nsystematic errors, approximate physical models...). The complexity is further\nincreased when the inferred parameters are used to make predictions (virtual\nmeasurements) because parameters uncertainty has to be estimated in addition to\nparameters best value. The literature is rich in statistical models for the\ncalibration/prediction problem, each having benefits and limitations.\n  We review and evaluate standard and state-of-the-art statistical models in a\ncommon bayesian framework, and test them on synthetic and real datasets of\ntemperature-dependent viscosity for the calibration of Lennard-Jones parameters\nof a Chapman-Enskog model.\n", "  A continuum model of epithelial tissue mechanics was formulated using\ncellular-level mechanical ingredients and cell morphogenetic processes,\nincluding cellular shape changes and cellular rearrangements. This model can\ninclude finite deformation, and incorporates stress and deformation tensors,\nwhich can be compared with experimental data. Using this model, we elucidated\ndynamical behavior underlying passive relaxation, active\ncontraction-elongation, and tissue shear flow. This study provides an\nintegrated scheme for the understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in\norchestrating the morphogenetic processes in individual cells, in order to\nachieve epithelial tissue morphogenesis.\n", "  Fast and energetic winds are invoked by galaxy formation models as essential\nprocesses in the evolution of galaxies. These outflows can be powered either by\nstar-formation and/or AGN activity, but the relative dominance of the two\nmechanisms is still under debate. We use spectroscopic stacking analysis to\nstudy the properties of the low-ionization phase of the outflow in a sample of\n1330 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and 79 X-ray detected (42<log(L_X)<45 erg/s)\nType 2 AGN at 1.7<z<4.6 selected from a compilation of deep optical\nspectroscopic surveys, mostly zCOSMOS-Deep and VUDS. We measure mean velocity\noffsets of -150 km/s in the SFGs while in the AGN sample the velocity is much\nhigher (-950 km/s), suggesting that the AGN is boosting the outflow up to\nvelocities that could not be reached only with the star- formation\ncontribution. The sample of X-ray AGN has on average a lower SFR than non-AGN\nSFGs of similar mass: this, combined with the enhanced outflow velocity in AGN\nhosts, is consistent with AGN feedback in action. We further divide our sample\nof AGN into two X-ray luminosity bins: we measure the same velocity offsets in\nboth stacked spectra, at odds with results reported for the highly ionized\nphase in local AGN, suggesting that the two phases of the outflow may be mixed\nonly up to relatively low velocities, while the highest velocities can be\nreached only by the highly ionized phase.\n", "  In this paper, we build and explore supervised learning models of\nferromagnetic system behavior, using Monte-Carlo sampling of the spin\nconfiguration space generated by the 2D Ising model. Given the enormous size of\nthe space of all possible Ising model realizations, the question arises as to\nhow to choose a reasonable number of samples that will form physically\nmeaningful and non-intersecting training and testing datasets. Here, we propose\na sampling technique called ID-MH that uses the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\ncreating Markov process across energy levels within the predefined\nconfiguration subspace. We show that application of this method retains phase\ntransitions in both training and testing datasets and serves the purpose of\nvalidation of a machine learning algorithm. For larger lattice dimensions,\nID-MH is not feasible as it requires knowledge of the complete configuration\nspace. As such, we develop a new \"block-ID\" sampling strategy: it decomposes\nthe given structure into square blocks with lattice dimension no greater than 5\nand uses ID-MH sampling of candidate blocks. Further comparison of the\nperformance of commonly used machine learning methods such as random forests,\ndecision trees, k nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks shows that\nthe PCA-based Decision Tree regressor is the most accurate predictor of\nmagnetizations of the Ising model. For energies, however, the accuracy of\nprediction is not satisfactory, highlighting the need to consider more\nalgorithmically complex methods (e.g., deep learning).\n", "  We study fully compressible convection in the context of plane-parallel,\npolytropically stratified atmospheres. We perform a suite of 2D and 3D\nsimulations in which we vary the initial superadiabaticity ($\\epsilon$) and the\nRayleigh number (Ra) while fixing the initial density stratification, aspect\nratio, and Prandtl number. The evolved heat transport, quantified by the\nNusselt number (Nu), follows scaling relationships similar to those found in\nthe well-studied, incompressible Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard problem. This scaling\nholds up in both 2D and 3D and is not appreciably affected by the magnitude of\n$\\epsilon$.\n", "  We study the thermodynamic phase diagram of three-dimensional\n$sl(N;\\mathbb{R})$ higher spin black holes. By analyzing the semi-classical\npartition function we uncover a rich structure that includes Hawking-Page\ntransitions to the AdS$_3$ vacuum, first order phase transitions among black\nhole states, and a second order critical point. Our analysis is explicit for\n$N=4$ but we extrapolate some of our conclusions to arbitrary $N$. In\nparticular, we argue that even $N$ is stable in the ensemble under\nconsideration but odd $N$ is not.\n", "  We prove that the $q$-state Potts model and the random-cluster model with\ncluster weight $q>4$ undergo a discontinuous phase transition on the square\nlattice. More precisely, we show\n  - Existence of multiple infinite-volume measures for the critical Potts and\nrandom-cluster models,\n  - Ordering for the measures with monochromatic (resp. wired) boundary\nconditions for the critical Potts model (resp. random-cluster model), and\n  - Exponential decay of correlations for the measure with free boundary\nconditions for both the critical Potts and random-cluster models.\n  The proof is based on a rigorous computation of the Perron-Frobenius\neigenvalues of the diagonal blocks of the transfer matrix of the six-vertex\nmodel, whose ratios are then related to the correlation length of the\nrandom-cluster model.\n  As a byproduct, we rigorously compute the correlation lengths of the critical\nrandom-cluster and Potts models, and show that they behave as\n$\\exp(\\pi^2/\\sqrt{q-4})$ as $q$ tends to 4.\n", "  We constrain the possible presence of a central black hole (BH) in the center\nof the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This requires spectroscopic measurements\nover an area of order a square degree, due to the poorly known position of the\nkinematic center. Such measurements are now possible with the impressive field\nof view of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the ESO Very Large\nTelescope. We used the Calcium Triplet (~850nm) spectral lines in many\nshort-exposure MUSE pointings to create a two-dimensional integrated-light\nline-of-sight velocity map from the ~$10^8$ individual spectra, taking care to\nidentify and remove Galactic foreground populations. The data reveal a clear\nvelocity gradient at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 1 arcmin$^{2}$. We\nfit kinematic models to arrive at a $3\\sigma$ upper-mass-limit of $10^{7.1}$\nM$_{Sun}$ for any central BH - consistent with the known scaling relations for\nsupermassive black holes and their host systems. This adds to the growing body\nof knowledge on the presence of BHs in low-mass and dwarf galaxies, and their\nscaling relations with host-galaxy properties, which can shed light on theories\nof BH growth and host system interaction.\n", "  We propose a gravitation theory in 4 dimensional space-time obtained by\ncompacting to 4 dimensions the five dimensional topological Chern-Simons theory\nwith the gauge group SO(1,5) or SO(2,4) -- the de Sitter or anti-de Sitter\ngroup of 5-dimensional space-time. In the resulting theory, torsion, which is\nsolution of the field equations as in any gravitation theory in the first order\nformalism, is not necessarily zero. However, a cosmological solution with zero\ntorsion exists, which reproduces the Lambda-CDM cosmological solution of\nGeneral Relativity. A realistic solution with spherical symmetry is also\nobtained.\n", "  For superconducting qubits, microwave pulses drive rotations around the Bloch\nsphere. The phase of these drives can be used to generate zero-duration\narbitrary \"virtual\" Z-gates which, combined with two $X_{\\pi/2}$ gates, can\ngenerate any SU(2) gate. Here we show how to best utilize these virtual Z-gates\nto both improve algorithms and correct pulse errors. We perform randomized\nbenchmarking using a Clifford set of Hadamard and Z-gates and show that the\nerror per Clifford is reduced versus a set consisting of standard\nfinite-duration X and Y gates. Z-gates can correct unitary rotation errors for\nweakly anharmonic qubits as an alternative to pulse shaping techniques such as\nDRAG. We investigate leakage and show that a combination of DRAG pulse shaping\nto minimize leakage and Z-gates to correct rotation errors (DRAGZ) realizes a\n13.3~ns $X_{\\pi/2}$ gate characterized by low error ($1.95[3]\\times 10^{-4}$)\nand low leakage ($3.1[6]\\times 10^{-6}$). Ultimately leakage is limited by the\nfinite temperature of the qubit, but this limit is two orders-of-magnitude\nsmaller than pulse errors due to decoherence.\n", "  We study the contribution of binary black hole (BH-BH) mergers from the\nfirst, metal-free stars in the Universe (Pop III) to gravitational wave\ndetection rates. Our study combines initial conditions for the formation of Pop\nIII stars based on N-body simulations of binary formation (including rates,\nbinary fraction, initial mass function, orbital separation and eccentricity\ndistributions) with an updated model of stellar evolution specific for Pop III\nstars. We find that the merger rate of these Pop III BH-BH systems is\nrelatively small (< 0.1 Gpc^-3 yr^-1) at low redshifts (z<2), where it can be\ncompared with the LIGO empirical estimate of 9-240 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 (Abbott et al.\n2016). The predicted rates are even smaller for Pop III double neutron star and\nblack hole neutron star mergers. Our rates are compatible with those of Hartwig\net al. (2016), but significantly smaller than those found in previous work\n(Bond & Carr 1984; Belczynski et al. 2004; Kinugawa et al. 2014, 2016). We\nexplain the reasons for this discrepancy by means of detailed model comparisons\nand point out that (i) identification of Pop III BH-BH mergers may not be\npossible by advanced LIGO, and (ii) the level of stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground from Pop III mergers may be lower than recently estimated (Kowalska\net al. 2012; Inayoshi et al. 2016; Dvorkin et al. 2016). We further estimate\ngravitational wave detection rates for third-generation interferometric\ndetectors. Our calculations are relevant for low to moderately rotating Pop III\nstars. We can now exclude significant (> 1 per cent) contribution of these\nstars to low-redshift BH-BH mergers. However, it remains to be tested whether\n(and at what level) rapidly spinning Pop III stars (homogeneous evolution) can\ncontribute to BH-BH mergers in the local Universe.\n", "  We consider a universe with an arbitrary number of extra dimensions, $N$. We\npresent a new method for constructing the cosmological equations of motion and\nfind analytic solutions with an explicit dependence on $N$. When we take the\n$N\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit we find novel, emergent behaviour which\ndistinguishes it from normal Kaluza-Klein universes.\n", "  Motivated by the recent progress on the spin-orbit-coupled triangular lattice\nspin liquid candidate YbMgGaO4, we carry out a systematic projective symmetry\ngroup analysis and mean-field study of candidate U(1) spin liquid ground\nstates. Due to the spin-orbital entanglement of the Yb moments, the space group\nsymmetry operation transforms both the position and the orientation of the\nlocal moments, and hence brings different features for the projective\nrealization of the lattice symmetries from the cases with spin-only moments.\nAmong the eight U(1) spin liquids that we find with the fermionic parton\nconstruction, only one spin liquid state, that was proposed and analyzed in Yao\nShen, et al, Nature 540, 559-562 (2016) and labeled as U1A00 in the present\nwork, stands out and gives a large spinon Fermi surface and provides a\nconsistent explanation for the spectroscopic results in YbMgGaO4. Further\nconnection of this spinon Fermi surface U(1) spin liquid with YbMgGaO4 and the\nfuture directions are discussed. Finally, our results may apply to other\nspin-orbit-coupled triangular lattice spin liquid candidates, and more broadly,\nour general approach can be well extended to spin-orbit-coupled spin liquid\ncandidate materials.\n", "  Two years ago, the AMS collaboration released the most precise measurement of\nthe cosmic ray positron flux. It confirms that pure secondary predictions fall\nbelow the data above 10 GeV, suggesting the presence of a primary component,\ne.g. annihilations of WIMPs dark matter. Most analyses have focused on the\nhigh-energy part of the spectrum, disregarding the GeV energy region where\ncosmic ray transport is harder to model and solar modulation comes into play.\nGiven the high quality of AMS measurements, it is timely to re-examine the\npositron anomaly over the entire energy range, taking into account transport\nprocesses so far neglected, e.g. convection or diffusive re-acceleration. We\ndevise a new semi-analytical method to take into account transport processes so\nfar neglected, but important below a few GeV. It is based on the pinching of\ninverse Compton and synchrotron energy losses inside the Galactic disc. It\nallows to carry out extensive scans over the cosmic ray propagation parameters,\nwhich we strongly constrain by requiring that the secondary component does not\novershoot the AMS measurements. Only models with large diffusion coefficients\nsurvive this test. The positron flux is a powerful and independent probe of\ncosmic ray propagation, complementary to the boron-to-carbon ratio. We then\nscan over WIMP mass to fit the annihilation cross section and branching ratios,\nexploring both direct annihilations into standard model particles or through\nlight mediators. In the former case, the best fit yields a $p$-value of 0.4%\nfor a mass of 264 GeV, a value that does not allow to reproduce the highest\nenergy data points. Worse quality fits are found in the latter case. The\ninterpretation of the positron excess in terms of single DM species\nannihilations is strongly disfavored. This conclusion is based solely on the\npositron data, and no other observation needs to be invoked.\n", "  The evaluation of vacuum expectation values (VEVs) in massive integrable\nquantum field theory (QFT) is a nontrivial renormalization-group \"connection\nproblem\" -- relating large and short distance asymptotics -- and is in general\nunsolved. This is particularly relevant in the context of entanglement entropy,\nwhere VEVs of branch-point twist fields give universal saturation predictions.\nWe propose a new method to compute VEVs of twist fields associated to\ncontinuous symmetries in QFT. The method is based on a differential equation in\nthe continuous symmetry parameter, and gives VEVs as infinite form-factor\nseries which truncate at two-particle level in free QFT. We verify the method\nby studying U(1) twist fields in free models, which are simply related to the\nbranch-point twist fields. We provide the first exact formulae for the VEVs of\nsuch fields in the massive uncompactified free boson model, checking against an\nindependent calculation based on angular quantization. We show that logarithmic\nterms, overlooked in the original work of Callan and Wilczek [Phys. Lett. B333\n(1994)], appear both in the massless and in the massive situations. This\nimplies that, in agreement with numerical form-factor observations by Bianchini\nand Castro-Alvaredo [Nucl. Phys. B913 (2016)], the standard power-law\nshort-distance behavior is corrected by a logarithmic factor. We discuss how\nthis gives universal formulae for the saturation of entanglement entropy of a\nsingle interval in near-critical harmonic chains, including log log\ncorrections.\n", "  Two-proton decay of the $^{17}$Ne low-lying states populated in the\n$^1$H($^{18}$Ne,$d$)$^{17}$Ne transfer reaction was studied. The two-proton\nwidth $\\Gamma_{2p}$ of the $^{17}$Ne first excited $3/2^-$ state at $E^*=1.288$\nMeV is of importance for the two-proton radioactivity theory and\nnuclear-astrophysics applications. A dedicated search for the two-proton\nemission of this state was performed leading to the new upper limit obtained\nfor the width ratio $\\Gamma_{2p}/\\Gamma_{\\gamma} < 1.6(3) \\times 10^{-4}$. A\nnovel, \"combined mass\" method is suggested and tested capable to improve the\nresolution of the experiment which is a prime significance for the study of\nnuclear states with extremely small particle-to-gamma width ratios\n$\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{part}}/\\Gamma_{\\gamma}$. The condition $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{part}}\n\\ll \\Gamma_{\\gamma}$ is quite common for the states of astrophysical interest\nwhich makes the proposed approach promising in this field.\n", "  The minimal supersymmetric setup offers a comprehensive framework to\ninterpret the Fermi LAT Galactic center excess. Taking into account\nexperimental, theoretical, and astrophysical uncertainties we can identify\nvalid parameter regions linked to different annihilation channels. They extend\nto dark matter masses above 250 GeV. There exists a very mild tension between\nthe observed relic density and the annihilation rate in the center of our\ngalaxy for specific channels. The strongest additional constraints come from\nthe new generation of direct detection experiments, ruling out much of the\nlight and intermediate dark matter mass regime and giving preference to heavier\ndark matter annihilating into a pair of top quarks.\n", "  We use dedicated microfluidic devices to expose soft hydrogel particles to a\nrapid change in the externally applied osmotic pressure and observe a\nnon-monotonic response: After an initial rapid compression the particle slowly\nreswells to approximately its original size. Using a simple phenomenological\nand a more elaborate poroelastic model, we extract important material\nproperties from a single microfluidic experiment, including the compressive\nmodulus, the gel permeability and the diffusivity of the osmolyte inside the\ngel. We expect our approach to be relevant to applications such as controlled\nrelease, chromatography, and responsive materials.\n", "  We compute models for the equation of state (EoS) of the matter in the cores\nof hybrid stars. Hadronic matter is treated in the non-linear relativistic\nmean-field approximation, and quark matter is modeled by three-flavor local and\nnon-local Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models with repulsive vector interactions.\nThe transition from hadronic to quark matter is constructed by considering\neither a soft phase transition (Gibbs construction) or a sharp phase transition\n(Maxwell construction). We find that high-mass neutron stars with masses up to\n$2.1-2.4 M_\\odot$ may contain a mixed phase with hadrons and quarks in their\ncores, if global charge conservation is imposed via the Gibbs conditions.\nHowever, if the Maxwell conditions is considered, the appearance of a pure\nquark matter core either destabilizes the star immediately (commonly for\nnon-local NJL models) or leads to a very short hybrid star branch in the\nmass-radius relation (generally for local NJL models).\n", "  We study a single-photon super-radiance under the conditions of cyclotron\nresonance in a perfect single-crystal p-type semiconductor film with cubic\nstructure. We show that the rate of super-radiant emission scales with tjhe\nfilm area. which allows one to specify the size of the film at which the\nprobability of a single-photon super-radiance becomes much greater than the\nprobabilities of other scattering channels. The power of super-radiant emission\ndepends only on three fundamental constants: the electron charge q_{e}, the\nspeed of light c, the electron mass m_{e}, and on the electric- to magnetic\nfield ratio.\n", "  We analyze many body localization (MBL) in an interacting one-dimensional\nsystem with a deterministic aperiodic potential. Below the threshold value of\nthe potential $h < h_c$, the non-interacting system has single particle\nmobility edges at $\\pm E_c$ while for $ h > h_c$ all the single particle states\nare localized. We demonstrate that even in the presence of single particle\nmobility edges, the interacting system can have MBL. Our numerical calculation\nof participation ratio in the Fock space and Shannon entropy shows that both\nfor $h < h_c$ (quarter filled) and $h>h_c$ ($h\\sim h_c$ and half filled), many\nbody states in the middle of the spectrum are delocalized while the low energy\nstates with $E < E_1$ and the high energy states with $E> E_2$ are localized.\nVariance of entanglement entropy (EE) also shows divergence at $E_{1,2}$\nindicating a transition from MBL to delocalized regime. We also studied\neigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH) and found that the low energy many\nbody states, which show area law scaling for EE do not obey ETH. The crossings\nfrom volume to area law scaling for EE and from thermal to non-thermal\nbehaviour occurs deep inside the localised regime. For $h \\gg h_c$, all the\nmany body states remain localized for weak to intermediate strength of\ninteraction and the system shows infinite temperature MBL phase.\n", "  We study the appearance and properties of cluster crystals (solids in which\nthe unit cell is occupied by a cluster of particles) in a two-dimensional\nsystem of self-propelled active Brownian particles with repulsive interactions.\nSelf-propulsion deforms the clusters by depleting particle density inside, and\nfor large speeds it melts the crystal. Continuous field descriptions at several\nlevels of approximation allow to identify the relevant physical mechanisms.\n", "  Nematic order has manifested itself in a variety of materials in the cuprate\nfamily. We propose an effective field theory of a layered system with\nincommensurate, intertwined spin- and charge-density wave (SDW and CDW) orders,\neach of which consists of two components related by $C_4$ rotations. Using a\nvariational method (which is exact in a large $N$ limit), we study the\ndevelopment of nematicity from partially melting those density waves by either\nincreasing temperature or adding quenched disorder. As temperature decreases we\nfirst find a transition to a nematic phase, but depending on the range of\nparameters (e.g. doping concentration) the strongest fluctuations associated\nwith this phase reflect either proximate SDW or CDW order. We also discuss the\nchanges in parameters that can account for the differences in the SDW-CDW\ninterplay between the (214) family and the other hole-doped cuprates.\n", "  We present new ALMA observations of the [OIII]88$\\mu$m line and high angular\nresolution observations of the [CII]158$\\mu$m line in a normal star forming\ngalaxy at z$=$7.1. Previous [CII] observations of this galaxy had detected\n[CII] emission consistent with the Ly$\\alpha$ redshift but spatially slightly\noffset relative to the optical (UV-rest frame) emission. The new [CII]\nobservations reveal that the [CII] emission is partly clumpy and partly diffuse\non scales larger than about 1kpc. [OIII] emission is also detected at high\nsignificance, offset relative to the optical counterpart in the same direction\nas the [CII] clumps, but mostly not overlapping with the bulk of the [CII]\nemission. The offset between different emission components (optical/UV and\ndifferent far-IR tracers) is similar to what observed in much more powerful\nstarbursts at high redshift. We show that the [OIII] emitting clump cannot be\nexplained in terms of diffuse gas excited by the UV radiation emitted by the\noptical galaxy, but it requires excitation by in-situ (slightly dust obscured)\nstar formation, at a rate of about 7 M$_{\\odot}$/yr. Within 20 kpc from the\noptical galaxy the ALMA data reveal two additional [OIII] emitting systems,\nwhich must be star forming companions. We discuss that the complex properties\nrevealed by ALMA in the z$\\sim$7.1 galaxy are consistent with expectations by\nrecent models and cosmological simulations, in which differential dust\nextinction, differential excitation and different metal enrichment levels,\nassociated with different subsystems assembling a galaxy, are responsible for\nthe different appearance of the system when observed with different tracers.\n", "  A general orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode selection principle is put\nforward involving the rotationally symmetric superposition of chiral states.\nThis principle is not only capable of explaining the operation of spiral zone\nplate holograms and suggesting that naturally occurring rotationally symmetric\npatterns could be inadvertent sources of vortex beams, but more importantly, it\nenables the systematic and flexible generation of structured OAM waves in\ngeneral. This is demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically in the\ncontext of electron vortex beams using rotationally symmetric binary amplitude\nchiral sieve masks.\n", "  Planetary cores consist of liquid metals (low Prandtl number $Pr$) that\nconvect as the core cools. Here we study nonlinear convection in a rotating\n(low Ekman number $Ek$) planetary core using a fully 3D direct numerical\nsimulation. Near the critical thermal forcing (Rayleigh number $Ra$),\nconvection onsets as thermal Rossby waves, but as the $Ra$ increases, this\nstate is superceded by one dominated by advection. At moderate rotation, these\nstates (here called the weak branch and strong branch, respectively) are\nsmoothly connected. As the planetary core rotates faster, the smooth transition\nis replaced by hysteresis cycles and subcriticality until the weak branch\ndisappears entirely and the strong branch onsets in a turbulent state at $Ek <\n10^{-6}$. Here the strong branch persists even as the thermal forcing drops\nwell below the linear onset of convection ($Ra=0.7Ra_{crit}$ in this study). We\nhighlight the importance of the Reynolds stress, which is required for\nconvection to subsist below the linear onset. In addition, the P\\'eclet number\nis consistently above 10 in the strong branch. We further note the presence of\na strong zonal flow that is nonetheless unimportant to the convective state.\nOur study suggests that, in the asymptotic regime of rapid rotation relevant\nfor planetary interiors, thermal convection of liquid metals in a sphere onsets\nthrough a subcritical bifurcation.\n", "  In systems having an anisotropic electronic structure, such as the layered\nmaterials graphite, graphene and cuprates, impulsive light excitation can\ncoherently stimulate specific bosonic modes, with exotic consequences for the\nemergent electronic properties. Here we show that the population of E$_{2g}$\nphonons in the multiband superconductor MgB$_2$ can be selectively enhanced by\nfemtosecond laser pulses, leading to a transient control of the number of\ncarriers in the {\\sigma}-electronic subsystem. The nonequilibrium evolution of\nthe material optical constants is followed in the spectral region sensitive to\nboth the a- and c-axis plasma frequencies and modeled theoretically, revealing\nthe details of the $\\sigma$-$\\pi$ interband scattering mechanism in MgB$_2$.\n", "  We present a new non-parametric Jeans code, GravSphere, that recovers the\ndensity $\\rho(r)$ and velocity anisotropy $\\beta(r)$ of spherical stellar\nsystems, assuming only that they are in a steady-state. Using a large suite of\nmock data, we confirm that with only line-of-sight velocity data, GravSphere\nprovides a good estimate of the density at the projected stellar half mass\nradius, $\\rho(R_{1/2})$, but is not able to measure $\\rho(r)$ or $\\beta(r)$,\neven with 10,000 tracer stars. We then test three popular methods for breaking\nthis $\\rho-\\beta$ degeneracy: using multiple populations with different\n$R_{1/2}$; using higher order `Virial Shape Parameters' (VSPs); and including\nproper motion data.\n  We find that two populations provide an excellent recovery of $\\rho(r)$\nin-between their respective $R_{1/2}$. However, even with a total of $\\sim\n7,000$ tracers, we are not able to well-constrain $\\beta(r)$ for either\npopulation. By contrast, using 1000 tracers with higher order VSPs we are able\nto measure $\\rho(r)$ over the range $0.5 < r/R_{1/2} < 2$ and broadly constrain\n$\\beta(r)$. Including proper motion data for all stars gives an even better\nperformance, with $\\rho$ and $\\beta$ well-measured over the range $0.25 <\nr/R_{1/2} < 4$.\n  Finally, we test GravSphere on a triaxial mock galaxy that has axis ratios\ntypical of a merger remnant, $[1:0.8:0.6]$. In this case, GravSphere can become\nslightly biased. However, we find that when this occurs the data are poorly\nfit, allowing us to detect when such departures from spherical symmetry become\nproblematic.\n", "  We study scattering of a composite quasiparticle, which possesses a degree of\nfreedom corresponding to relative separation between two bound excitations, by\na delta-like impurity potential on a one-dimensional discrete lattice. Firstly,\nwe show that, due to specific properties of their dispersion, lattice\nexcitations bind to impurities with both negative and positive potentials. We\ndemonstrate that the finite size of the composite excitation leads to formation\nof multiple excitation-impurity bound states. The number and the degree of\nlocalization of these bound states depend on the signs and relative magnitudes\nof the impurity potential and the binding strength of two quasiparticles. We\nalso report the existence of excitation-impurity bound states whose energies\nare located in the continuum band. Secondly, we study a change in the\nentanglement between the centre of mass and relative coordinate degrees of\nfreedom of a biexciton wave packet during single impurity scattering and\ndecoherence caused by it. For a composite quasiparticle on a lattice, the\nentanglement between its relative and centre of mass coordinate degrees of\nfreedom arises naturally due to inseparability of the two-particle Hamiltonian.\nOne of the main focuses of our study is to investigate how this inseparability\naffects the creation of the biexciton-impurity bound states and the\nentanglement dynamics.\n", "  The correspondence between Poisson homogeneous spaces over a Poisson-Lie\ngroup $G$ and Lagrangian Lie subalgebras of the classical double $D({\\mathfrak\ng})$ is revisited and explored in detail for the case in which ${\\mathfrak\ng}=D(\\mathfrak a)$ is a classical double itself. We apply these results to give\nan explicit description of some coisotropic 2d Poisson homogeneous spaces over\nthe group $\\mathrm{SL}(2,R)\\cong\\mathrm{SO}(2,1)$, namely 2d anti de Sitter\nspace, 2d hyperbolic space and the lightcone in 3d Minkowski space. We show how\neach of these spaces is obtained as a quotient with respect to a\nPoisson-subgroup for one of the three inequivalent Lie bialgebra structures on\n${sl}(2,R)$ and as a coisotropic one for the others. We then construct families\nof coisotropic Poisson homogeneous structures for 3d anti de Sitter space\n$\\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and show that the ones that are quotients by a Poisson\nsubgroup are determined by a three-parameter family of classical $r$-matrices\nfor ${so}(2,2)$, while the non Poisson-subgroup cases are much more numerous.\nIn particular, we present the two Poisson homogeneous structures on\n$\\mathrm{AdS}_3$ that arise from two Drinfel'd double structures on\n$\\mathrm{SO}(2,2)$. The first one realises $\\mathrm{AdS}_3$ as a quotient of\n$\\mathrm{SO}(2,2)$ by the Poisson-subgroup $\\mathrm{SL}(2,R)$, while the second\none, the non-commutative spacetime of the twisted $\\kappa$-AdS deformation,\nrealises $\\mathrm{AdS}_3$ as a coisotropic Poisson homogeneous space.\n", "  Dark matter interacting with the Standard Model fermions through new scalars\nor pseudoscalars with flavour-diagonal couplings proportional to fermion mass\nare well motivated theoretically, and provide a useful phenomenological model\nwith which to interpret experimental results. Two modes of dark matter\nproduction from these models have been considered in the existing literature:\npairs of dark matter produced through top quark loops with an associated\nmonojet in the event, and pair production of dark matter with pairs of heavy\nflavoured quarks (tops or bottoms). In this paper, we demonstrate that a third,\npreviously overlooked channel yields a non-negligible contribution to LHC dark\nmatter searches in these models. In spite of a generally lower production cross\nsection at LHC when compared to the associated top-pair channel, non-flavour\nviolating single top quark processes are kinematically favored and can\nsignificantly increase the sensitivity to these models. Including dark matter\nproduction in association with a single top quark through scalar or\npseudoscalar mediators, the exclusion limit set by the LHC searches for dark\nmatter can be improved by $30$--$90\\%$, depending on the mass assumed for the\nmediator particle.\n", "  We use 2D numerical simulations to study dense suspensions of non-Brownian\nhard particles using the Critical Load Model (CLM) under constant confining\npressures. This simple model shows discontinuous shear thickening (DST) as the\ntangential forces get activated upon increased shear stresses. By\nparameterizing a simple binary system of frictional and non-frictional\nparticles of different proportions we show that the jamming packing fraction,\nat which the viscosity diverges, is controlled by the fraction of frictional\ncontacts. The viscosity of dense suspensions can thereby be expressed as a\nfunction of the fraction of frictional contacts as well as the packing fraction\nof solid particles. In addition, we show that there exists a simple\nrelationship between the fraction of frictional contacts and the two control\nparameters (under confining pressure): the viscous number J and the ratio\nbetween the repulsive barrier force and confining pressure. Under confining\npressures the viscosity curves are found to depend on the shear protocol, with\nthe possibility of yielding negative dynamic compressibility.\n", "  We present a halo-model-based approach to calculate the cross-correlation\nbetween $\\rm{21\\,cm}$ HI intensity fluctuations and $\\rm{Ly}\\alpha$ emitters\n(LAE) during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Ionizing radiation around dark\nmatter halos are modeled as bubbles with the size and growth determined based\non the reionization photon production, among other physical parameters. The\ncross-correlation shows a clear negative-to-positive transition, associated\nwith transition from ionized to neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium\nduring EoR. The cross-correlation is subject to several foreground\ncontaminants, including foreground radio point sources important for\n$\\rm{21\\,cm}$ experiments and low-$z$ interloper emission lines, such as\n$\\rm{H}\\alpha$, OIII, and OII, for $\\rm{Ly}\\alpha$ experiments. Our\ncalculations show that by masking out high fluxes in the $\\rm{Ly}\\alpha$\nmeasurement, the correlated foreground contamination on the\n$\\rm{21\\,cm}$-$\\rm{Ly}\\alpha$ cross-correlation can be dramatically reduced. We\nforecast the detectability of $\\rm{21\\,cm}$-$\\rm{Ly}\\alpha$ cross-correlation\nat different redshifts and adopt a Fisher matrix approach to estimate\nuncertainties on the key EoR parameters that have not been well constrained by\nother observations of reionization. This halo-model-based approach enables us\nto explore the EoR parameter space rapidly for different $\\rm{21\\,cm}$ and\n$\\rm{Ly}\\alpha$ experiments.\n", "  A flat Friedman-Roberson-Walker universe dominated by a cosmological constant\n($\\Lambda$) and cold dark matter (CDM) has been the working model preferred by\ncosmologists since the discovery of cosmic acceleration. However, tensions of\nvarious degrees of significance are known to be present among existing datasets\nwithin the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. In particular, the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest\nmeasurement of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS) prefers a smaller value of the matter density\nfraction $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$ compared to the value preferred by cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). Also, the recently measured value of the Hubble constant,\n$H_0=73.24\\pm1.74 \\ {\\rm km}\\ {\\rm s}^{-1} \\ {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, is $3.4\\sigma$\nhigher than $66.93\\pm0.62 \\ {\\rm km}\\ {\\rm s}^{-1} \\ {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ inferred\nfrom the Planck CMB data. In this work, we investigate if these tensions can be\ninterpreted as evidence for a non-constant dynamical dark energy (DE). Using\nthe Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantify the tension between datasets,\nwe find that the tensions are relieved by an evolving DE, with the dynamical DE\nmodel preferred at a $3.5\\sigma$ significance level based on the improvement in\nthe fit alone. While, at present, the Bayesian evidence for the dynamical DE is\ninsufficient to favour it over $\\Lambda$CDM, we show that, if the current best\nfit DE happened to be the true model, it would be decisively detected by the\nupcoming DESI survey.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the $R$-matrix approach to treat the subthreshold\nresonances for the single-level and one channel, and for the single-level and\ntwo channel cases. In particular, the expression relating the ANC with the\nobservable reduced width, when the subthreshold bound state is the only channel\nor coupled with an open channel, which is a resonance, is formulated. Since the\nANC plays a very important role in nuclear astrophysics, these relations\nsignificantly enhance the power of the derived equations. We present the\nrelationship between the resonance width and the ANC for the general case and\nconsider two limiting cases: wide and narrow resonances. Different equations\nfor the astrophysical S-factors in the $R$-matrix approach are presented. After\nthat we discuss the Trojan Horse Method (THM) formalism. The developed\nequations are obtained using the surface-integral formalism and the generalized\n$R$-matrix approach for the three-body resonant reactions. It is shown how the\nTrojan Horse (TH) double differential cross section can be expressed in terms\nof the on-the-energy-shell astrophysical S-factor for the binary sub-reaction.\nFinally, we demonstrate how the THM can be used to calculate the astrophysical\nS-factor for the neutron generator $^{13}{\\rm C}(\\alpha,\\,n)^{16}{\\rm O}$ in\nlow-mass AGB stars. At astrophysically relevant energies this astrophysical\nS-factor is controlled by the threshold level $1/2^{+}, E_{x}= 6356$ keV. Here,\nwe reanalyzed recent TH data taking into account more accurately the three-body\neffects and using both assumptions that the threshold level is a subthreshold\nbound state or it is a resonance state.\n", "  We develop a simple one-zone model of the steady-state Crab nebula spectrum\nencompassing both the radio/soft $X$-ray and the GeV/multi-TeV observations. By\nsolving the transport equation for GeV-TeV electrons injected at the wind\ntermination shock as a log-parabola momentum distribution and evolved via\nenergy losses, we determine analytically the resulting differential energy\nspectrum of photons. We find an impressive agreement with the observed spectrum\nof synchrotron emission, and the synchrotron self-Compton component reproduces\nthe previously unexplained broad $200$-GeV peak that matches the Fermi/LAT data\nbeyond $1$ GeV with the MAGIC data. We determine the parameters of the single\nlog-parabola electron injection distribution, in contrast with multiple broken\npower-law electron spectra proposed in the literature. The resulting photon\ndifferential spectrum provides a natural interpretation of the deviation from\npower-law customarily fit with empirical multiple broken power-laws. Our model\ncan be applied to the radio-to-multi-TeV spectrum of a variety of astrophysical\noutflows, including pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants, as well as to\ninterplanetary shocks.\n", "  Magnetic field of accreting neutron stars determines their overall behaviour\nincluding the maximum possible luminosity. Some models require an above-average\nmagnetic field strength (> 10^13 G) in order to explain super-Eddington mass\naccretion rate in the recently discovered class of pulsating ultraluminous\nX-ray sources (ULX). The peak luminosity of SMC X-3 during its major outburst\nin 2016-2017 reached ~2.5x10^39 erg/s comparable to that in ULXs thus making\nthis source the nearest ULX-pulsar. SMC X-3 belongs to the class of transient\nX-ray pulsars with Be optical companions, and exhibited a giant outburst in\nJuly 2016 - February 2017. The source has been observed during the entire\noutburst with the Swift/XRT and Fermi/GBM telescopes, as well as the NuSTAR\nobservatory. Collected data allowed us to estimate the magnetic field strength\nof the neutron star in SMC X-3 using several independent methods. Spin\nevolution of the source during and between the outbursts and the luminosity of\nthe transition to so-called propeller regime in the range of (0.3 - 7)x10^35\nerg/s imply relatively weak dipole field of (1 - 5)x10^12 G. On the other hand,\nthere is also evidence for much stronger field in the immediate vicinity of the\nneutron star surface. In particular, transition from super- to sub-critical\naccretion regime associated with cease of the accretion column, absence of\ncyclotron absorption features in the broadband X-ray spectrum of the source\nobtained with NuSTAR and very high peak luminosity favor an order of magnitude\nstronger field. This discrepancy makes SMC X-3 a good candidate to posses\nsignificant non-dipolar components of the field, and an intermediate source\nbetween classical X-ray pulsars and accreting magnetars which may constitute an\nappreciable fraction of ULX population.\n", "  White dwarf stars are the final stage of most stars, born single or in\nmultiple systems. We discuss the identification, magnetic fields, and mass\ndistribution for white dwarfs detected from spectra obtained by the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey up to Data Release 13 in 2016, which lead to the increase in\nthe number of spectroscopically identified white dwarf stars from 5000 to\n39000. This number includes only white dwarf stars with log g >= 6.5 stars,\ni.e., excluding the Extremely Low Mass white dwarfs, which are necessarily the\nbyproduct of stellar interaction.\n", "  We present a phenomenological theory of filamentary resistive random access\nmemory (RRAM) describing the commonly observed features of their\ncurrent-voltage characteristics. Our approach follows the approach of\nthermodynamic theory developed earlier for chalcogenide memory and threshold\nswitches and largely independent of their microscopic details. It explains,\nwithout adjustable parameters, such features as the domains of filament\nformation and switching, voltage independent current in SET and current\nindependent voltage in RESET regimes, the relation between the set and reset\nvoltages, filament resistance independent of its length, etc. Furthermore, it\nexpresses the observed features through the material and circuitry parameters\nthus paving a way to device improvements.\n", "  A national voting population, when segmented into groups like, for example,\ndifferent states, can yield a counter-intuitive scenario where the winner may\nnot necessarily get the most number of total votes. A recent example is the\n2016 presidential election in the US. We model the situation by using\ninteracting opinion dynamics models and look at the effect of coarse graining\nnear the critical points where the spatial fluctuations are high. We establish\nthat the sole effect of coarse graining, which mimics the `winner takes all'\nelectoral college system in the US, can give rise to finite probabilities of\nsuch events of minority candidate winning even in the large size limit near the\ncritical point. The overall probabilities of victory of the minority candidate\ncan be predicted from the models which indicates that one may expect more\ninstances of minority candidate winning in the future.\n", "  Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) around the world are using the incredible\nconsistency of millisecond pulsars to measure low frequency gravitational waves\nfrom (super)Massive Black Hole (MBH) binaries. We use comprehensive MBH merger\nmodels based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to predict the spectrum\nof the stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (GWB). We use real\nTime-of-Arrival (TOA) specifications from the European, NANOGrav, Parkes, and\nInternational PTA (IPTA) to calculate realistic times to detection of the GWB\nacross a wide range of model parameters. In addition to exploring the parameter\nspace of environmental hardening processes (in particular: stellar scattering\nefficiencies), we have expanded our models to include eccentric binary\nevolution which can have a strong effect on the GWB spectrum. Our models show\nthat strong stellar scattering and high characteristic eccentricities enhance\nthe GWB strain amplitude near the PTA sensitive \"sweet-spot\" (near the\nfrequency $f = 1 \\, \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), slightly improving detection prospects\nin these cases. While the GWB $amplitude$ is degenerate between cosmological\nand environmental parameters, the location of a spectral turnover at low\nfrequencies ($f \\lesssim 0.1 \\, \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) is strongly indicative of\nenvironmental coupling. At high frequencies ($f\\gtrsim 1 \\, \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$),\nthe GWB spectral index can be used to infer the number density of sources and\npossibly their eccentricity distribution. Even with merger models that use\npessimistic environmental and eccentricity parameters, if the current rate of\nPTA expansion continues, we find that the International PTA is highly likely to\nmake a detection within about 10 years.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of a class of models in which a generalized\ncluster interaction can be quenched by Ising exchange interaction and external\nmagnetic field. We characterize the various phases through winding numbers.\nThey may be ordinary phases with local order parameter or exotic ones, known as\nsymmetry protected topologically ordered phases. Quantum phase transitions with\ndynamical critical exponents z = 1 or z = 2 are found. Quantum phase\ntransitions are analyzed through finite-size scaling of the geometric phase\naccumulated when the spins of the lattice perform an adiabatic precession. In\nparticular, we quantify the scaling behavior of the geometric phase in relation\nwith the topology and low energy properties of the band structure of the\nsystem.\n", "  The threshold mass for prompt collapse in binary neutron star mergers was\nempirically found to depend on the stellar properties of the maximum-mass\nnon-rotating neutron star model. Here we present a semi-analytic derivation of\nthis empirical relation which suggests that it is rather insensitive to thermal\neffects, to deviations from axisymmetry and to the exact rotation law in merger\nremnants. We utilize axisymmetric, cold equilibrium models with differential\nrotation and determine the threshold mass for collapse from the comparison\nbetween an empirical relation that describes the angular momentum in the\nremnant for a given total binary mass and the sequence of rotating equilibrium\nmodels at the threshold to collapse (the latter assumed to be near the turning\npoint of fixed-angular-momentum sequences). In spite of the various simplifying\nassumptions, the empirical relation for prompt collapse is reproduced with good\naccuracy, which demonstrates its robustness. We discuss implications of our\nmethodology and results for understanding other empirical relations satisfied\nby neutron-star merger remnants that have been discovered by numerical\nsimulations and that play a key role in constraining the high-density equation\nof state through gravitational-wave observations.\n", "  We show how to deal with the generalized q-Schr\\\"odinger and q-Klein-Gordon\nfields in a variety of scenarios. These q-fields are meaningful at very high\nenergies (TeVs) for for $q=1.15$, high ones (GeVs) for $q=1.001$, and low\nenergies (MeVs)for $q=1.000001$ [Nucl. Phys. A {\\bf 948} (2016) 19, Nucl. Phys.\nA {\\bf 955} (2016) 16]. We develop here the quantum field theory (QFT) for the\nq-Schr\\\"odinger and q-Klein-Gordon fields, showing that both reduce to the\ncustomary Schr\\\"odinger and Klein-Gordon QFTs for q close to unity. Further, we\nanalyze the q-Klein-Gordon field for $2q-1=n$ (n integer $\\ge 2$) and\nanalytically compute the self-energy and the propagator up to second order.\n", "  The combined effects of defect-defect interaction and of uniaxial or biaxial\nstrains of up to 10\\% on the development of magnetic states on the\ndefect-core-localized quasi-one-dimensional electronic states generated by the\nso-called 558 linear extended defect in graphene monolayers are investigated by\nmeans of {\\it ab initio} calculations. Results are analyzed on the basis of the\nheuristics of the Stoner criterion. We find that conditions for the emergence\nof magnetic states on the 558 defect can be tuned by uniaxial tensile parallel\nstrains (along the defect direction) at both limits of isolated and interacting\n558 defects. Parallel strains are shown to lead to two cooperative effects that\nfavor the emergence of itinerant magnetism: enhancement of the DOS of the\nresonant defect states in the region of the Fermi level and tuning of the Fermi\nlevel to the maximum of the related DOS peak. A perpendicular strain is\nlikewise shown to enhance the DOS of the defect states, but it also effects a\ndetunig of the Fermi level that shifts away from the maximum of the DOS of the\ndefect states, which inhibts the emergence of magnetic states. As a result,\nunder biaxial strains the stabilization of a magnetic state depends on the\nrelative magnitudes of the two components of strain.\n", "  We propose a protocol for realizing the stripe phase in two spin models on a\ntwo-dimensional square lattice, which can be implemented with strongly magnetic\natoms (Cr, Dy, Er, etc.) in optical lattices by encoding spin states into\nZeeman sublevels of the ground state manifold. The protocol is tested with\ncluster-mean-field time-dependent variational ans\\\"atze, validated by\ncomparison with exact results for small systems, which enable us to simulate\nthe dynamics of systems with up to 64 sites during the state-preparation\nprotocol. This allows, in particular, to estimate the time required for\npreparation of the stripe phase with high fidelity under real experimental\nconditions.\n", "  A new algorithm for the asymptotic nuclear coefficients calculation, which we\ncall the $\\Delta$-method, is proved and developed. This method was proposed in\nRef. [O. L. Ram\\'irez Su\\'arez and J.-M. Sparenberg, arXiv: 1602.04082\n[nucl-th] (2016)] but no proof was given. We apply it to the bound state\nsituated near the channel threshold when the Sommerfeld parameter is quite\nlarge within the experimental energy region. As a result, the value of the\nconventional effective-range function $K_l(k^2)$ is actually defined by the\nCoulomb term. One of the resulting effects is the wrong description of energy\nbehavior of the elastic scattering phase shift $\\delta_l$ reproduced from the\nfitted total effective-range function $K_l(k^2)$. This leads to an improper\nvalue of the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) value. No such problem\narises if we fit only the nuclear term. The difference between the total\neffective-range function and the Coulomb part at real energies is the same as\nthe nuclear term. Then we can proceed using just this $\\Delta$-method to\ncalculate the pole position values and the ANC. We apply it to the vertices\n$^4\\rm{He}+ {^{12}\\rm{C}}\\longleftrightarrow {^{16}\\rm{O}}$ and $^3\\rm{He}+\n{^4\\rm{He}}\\longleftrightarrow {^7\\rm{Be}}$. The calculated ANCs can be used to\nfind the radiative capture reaction cross sections of the transfers to the\n$^{16}\\rm{O}$ bound final states as well as to the\n$^7\\rm{Be}\\longleftrightarrow {^7\\rm{Be}}$. The calculated ANCs can be used to\nfind the radiative capture reaction cross sections of the transfers to the\n$^{16}\\rm{O}$ bound final states as well as to the $^7\\rm{Be}$.\n", "  We provide an experimental framework where periodically driven PT-symmetric\nsystems can be investigated. The set-up, consisting of two UHF oscillators\ncoupled by a time-dependent capacitance, demonstrates a cascade of PT-symmetric\nbroken domains bounded by exceptional point degeneracies. These domains are\nanalyzed and understood using an equivalent Floquet frequency lattice with\nlocal PT-symmetry. Management of these PT-phase transition domains is achieved\nthrough the amplitude and frequency of the drive.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the impact of rotation on the particle composition\nof rotating neutron stars (pulsars). Particular emphasis is put on the\nformation of quark matter during stellar spin-down, driven by continuous\ngravitational compression. Our study is based on modern models for the nuclear\nequation of state whose parameters are tightly constrained by nuclear data,\nneutron star masses, and the latest estimates of neutron star radii.\n", "  In this work, we study the effects of different magnetic field configurations\nin neutron stars described by a many-body forces formalism (MBF model). The MBF\nmodel is a relativistic mean field formalism that takes into account many-body\nforces by means of a meson field dependence of the nuclear interaction coupling\nconstants. We choose the best parametrization of the model that reproduces\nnuclear matter properties at saturation and also describes massive neutron\nstars. We assume matter to be in beta-equilibrium, charge neutral and at zero\ntemperature. Magnetic fields are taken into account both in the equation of\nstate and in the structure of the stars by the self-consistent solution of the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations. We assume a poloidal magnetic field distribution\nand calculate its effects on neutron stars, showing its influence on the\ngravitational mass and deformation of the stars.\n", "  The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in two-dimensional\nsuperconductors is usually expected to be protected against disorder. However,\nits typical signatures in real system, like e.g. the superfluid-density jump,\nare often at odd with this expectation. Here we show that the disorder-induced\ngranularity of the superconducting state modifies the nucleation mechanism for\nvortex-antivortex pairs. This leads to a considerable smearing of the universal\nsuperfluid-density jump as compared to the paradigmatic clean case, in\nagreement with experimental observations.\n", "  We study the QCD phase diagram using a non-local SU(3) NJL model with vector\ninteractions among quarks. We analyze several thermodynamic quantities such as\nentropy and specific heat, and study the influence of vector interactions on\nthe thermodynamic properties of quark matter. Upon imposing electric charge\nneutrality and baryon number conservation on the field equations, we compute\nmodels for the equation of state of the inner cores of proto-neutron stars\nproviding a non-local treatment of quark matter for astrophysics.\n", "  In May of 2011, NASA selected the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource\nIdentification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) asteroid sample\nreturn mission as the third mission in the New Frontiers program. The other two\nNew Frontiers missions are New Horizons, which explored Pluto during a flyby in\nJuly 2015 and is on its way for a flyby of Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 on Jan.\n1, 2019, and Juno, an orbiting mission that is studying the origin, evolution,\nand internal structure of Jupiter. The spacecraft departed for near-Earth\nasteroid (101955) Bennu aboard an United Launch Alliance Atlas V 411 evolved\nexpendable launch vehicle at 7:05 p.m. EDT on September 8, 2016, on a\nseven-year journey to return samples from Bennu. The spacecraft is on an\noutbound-cruise trajectory that will result in a rendezvous with Bennu in\nAugust 2018. The science instruments on the spacecraft will survey Bennu to\nmeasure its physical, geological, and chemical properties, and the team will\nuse these data to select a site on the surface to collect at least 60 g of\nasteroid regolith. The team will also analyze the remote-sensing data to\nperform a detailed study of the sample site for context, assess Bennus resource\npotential, refine estimates of its impact probability with Earth, and provide\nground-truth data for the extensive astronomical data set collected on this\nasteroid. The spacecraft will leave Bennu in 2021 and return the sample to the\nUtah Test and Training Range (UTTR) on September 24, 2023.\n", "  We consider the noncommutative deformation of the finite temperature\nholographic QCD (Sakai--Sugimoto) model in external electric and magnetic field\nand evaluate the effect of the noncommutaivity on the properties of the\nconductor-insulator phase transition associated with a baryon number current.\nAlthough the noncommutative deformation of the gauge theory does not change the\nphase structure with respect to the baryon number current, the transition\ntemperature $T_{c}$, the transition electric field $e_{c}$ and magnetic field\n$b_{c}$ in the conductor-insurator phase transition depend on the\nnoncommutativity parameter $\\theta$. Namely, the noncommutativity of space\ncoordinates has an influence on the shape of the phase diagram for the\nconductor-insurator phase transition. On the other hand, the allowed range of\nthe noncommutativity parameter can be restricted by the reality condition of\nthe constants of motion.\n", "  Topological error-correcting codes, such as surface codes and color codes,\nare promising because quantum operations are realized by two-dimensionally (2D)\narrayed quantum bits (qubits). However, physical wiring of electrodes to qubits\nis complicated, and 3D integration for the wiring requires further development\nof fabrication technologies. Here, we propose a method to reduce the congestion\nof wiring to qubits by just adding a SWAP gate after each controlled-NOT (CNOT)\ngate. SWAP gates exchange roles of qubits. Then, the roles of qubits are shared\nbetween different qubits. We found that our method transforms the qubit layout\nand reduces the number of qubits that cannot be accessed two-dimensionally. We\nshow that fully 2D layouts including both qubits and control electrodes can be\nachieved for surface and color codes of minimum sizes. This method will be\nbeneficial to simplifications of fabrication process of quantum circuits in\naddition to improvements of reliability of qubit system.\n", "  Isostatic equilibrium is commonly defined as the state achieved when there\nare no lateral gradients in hydrostatic pressure, and thus no lateral flow, at\ndepth within the lower viscosity mantle that underlies a planetary body's outer\ncrust. In a constant-gravity Cartesian framework, this definition is equivalent\nto the requirement that columns of equal width contain equal masses. Here we\nshow, however, that this equivalence breaks down when the spherical geometry of\nthe problem is taken into account. Imposing the \"equal masses\" requirement in a\nspherical geometry, as is commonly done in the literature, leads to significant\nlateral pressure gradients along internal equipotential surfaces, and thus\ncorresponds to a state of disequilibrium. Compared with the \"equal pressures\"\nmodel we present here, the \"equal masses\" model always overestimates the\ncompensation depth--by ~27% in the case of the lunar highlands and by nearly a\nfactor of two in the case of Enceladus.\n", "  We report optical CCD photometry of the recently identified symbiotic star EF\nAql. Our observations in Johnson V and B bands clearly show the presence of\nstochastic light variations with an amplitude of about 0.2 mag on a time scale\nof minutes. The observations point toward a white dwarf (WD) as the hot\ncomponent in the system. It is the 11-th object among more than 200 symbiotic\nstars known with detected optical flickering. Estimates of the mass accretion\nrate onto the WD and the mass loss rate in the wind of the Mira secondary star\nlead to the conclusion that less than 1 per cent of the wind is captured by the\nWD. Eight further candidates for the detection of flickering in similar systems\nare suggested.\n", "  It is possible to ameliorate the Higgs vacuum stability problem by switching\nover to two Higgs doublet models (2HDM), ensuring a stable electroweak vacuum\nup to the Planck scale, even though the top quark mass may be on the high side.\nHowever, the simultaneous requirements of perturbative unitarity, and also\ncompatibility with collider and flavour data, constrain the parameter space\nseverely. We investigate the collider signals answering to the regions allowed\nby such constraints. In particular, the near degeneracy of the neutral heavy\nscalar and the pseudoscalar is a feature that is probed. The LHC allows\ndistinguishability of these two states, together with signal significance of at\nleast 3$\\sigma$, in its high-luminosity run. While $e^+ e^-$ colliders may have\nrather low event rates, muon colliders, cashing on the principle of radiative\nreturn, can probe 2HDM scenarios with (pseudo)scalar masses up to a TeV or so,\nthough with the price of losing distinction between the CP-even and odd states.\n", "  We compare the methods of amplitude reconstruction, for a complete experiment\nand a truncated partial-wave analysis, applied to the electroproduction of\npseudoscalar mesons. We give examples which show, in detail, how the amplitude\nreconstruction (observables measured at a single energy and angle) is related\nto a truncated partial-wave analysis (observables measured at a single energy\nand a number of angles). A connection is made to existing data.\n", "  We re-examine the observational evidence for large-scale (4 Mpc) galactic\nconformity in the local Universe, as presented in Kauffmann et al. (2013). We\nshow that a number of methodological features of their analysis act to produce\na misleadingly high amplitude of the conformity signal. These include a\nweighting in favour of central galaxies in very high-density regions, the\nlikely misclassification of satellite galaxies as centrals in the same\nhigh-density regions, and the use of medians to characterize bimodal\ndistributions. We show that the large-scale conformity signal in Kauffmann et\nal. clearly originates from a very small number of central galaxies in the\nvicinity of just a few very massive clusters, whose effect is strongly\namplified by the methodological issues that we have identified. Some of these\n'centrals' are likely misclassified satellites, but some may be genuine\ncentrals showing a real conformity effect. Regardless, this analysis suggests\nthat conformity on 4 Mpc scales is best viewed as a relatively short-range\neffect (at the virial radius) associated with these very large neighbouring\nhaloes, rather than a very long-range effect (at tens of virial radii)\nassociated with the relatively low-mass haloes that host the nominal central\ngalaxies in the analysis. A mock catalogue constructed from a recent\nsemi-analytic model shows very similar conformity effects to the data when\nanalysed in the same way, suggesting that there is no need to introduce new\nphysical processes to explain galactic conformity on 4 Mpc scales.\n", "  A large class of modified theories of gravity used as models for dark energy\npredict a propagation speed for gravitational waves which can differ from the\nspeed of light. This difference of propagations speeds for photons and\ngravitons has an impact in the emission of gravitational waves by binary\nsystems. Thus, we revisit the usual quadrupolar emission of binary system for\nan arbitrary propagation speed of gravitational waves and obtain the\ncorresponding period decay formula. We then use timing data from the\nHulse-Taylor binary pulsar and obtain that the speed of gravitational waves can\nonly differ from the speed of light at the percentage level. This bound places\ntight constraints on dark energy models featuring an anomalous propagations\nspeed for the gravitational waves.\n", "  We present a detailed spectral analysis of the brightest Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN) identified in the 7Ms Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) survey over\na time span of 16 years. Using a model of an intrinsically absorbed power-law\nplus reflection, with possible soft excess and narrow Fe K$\\alpha$ line, we\nperform a systematic X-ray spectral analysis, both on the total 7Ms exposure\nand in four different periods with lengths of 2-21 months. With this approach,\nwe not only present the power-law slopes, column densities $N_H$, observed\nfluxes, and absorption-corrected 2-10~keV luminosities $L_X$ for our sample of\nAGNs, but also identify significant spectral variabilities among them on time\nscales of years. We find that the $N_H$ variabilities can be ascribed to two\ndifferent types of mechanisms, either flux-driven or flux-independent. We also\nfind that the correlation between the narrow Fe line EW and $N_H$ can be well\nexplained by the continuum suppression with increasing $N_H$. Accounting for\nthe sample incompleteness and bias, we measure the intrinsic distribution of\n$N_H$ for the CDF-S AGN population and present re-selected subsamples which are\ncomplete with respect to $N_H$. The $N_H$-complete subsamples enable us to\ndecouple the dependences of $N_H$ on $L_X$ and on redshift. Combining our data\nwith that from C-COSMOS, we confirm the anti-correlation between the average\n$N_H$ and $L_X$ of AGN, and find a significant increase of the AGN obscured\nfraction with redshift at any luminosity. The obscured fraction can be\ndescribed as $f_{obscured}\\thickapprox 0.42\\ (1+z)^{0.60}$.\n", "  We study in detail sub-GeV dark matter scattering off electrons in xenon,\nincluding the expected electron recoil spectra and annual modulation spectra.\nWe derive improved constraints using low-energy XENON10 and XENON100\nionization-only data. For XENON10, in addition to including electron-recoil\ndata corresponding to about $1-3$ electrons, we include for the first time\nevents with $\\gtrsim 4$ electrons. Assuming the scattering is momentum\nindependent, this strengthens a previous cross-section bound by almost an order\nof magnitude for dark matter masses above 50 MeV. The available XENON100 data\ncorresponds to events with $\\gtrsim 4$ electrons, and leads to a constraint\nthat is comparable to the XENON10 bound above 50 MeV. We demonstrate that a\nsearch for an annual modulation signal in upcoming xenon experiments (XENON1T,\nXENONnT, LZ) could substantially improve the above bounds even in the presence\nof large backgrounds. We also emphasize that in simple benchmark models of\nsub-GeV dark matter, the dark matter-electron scattering rate can be as high as\none event every ten (two) seconds in the XENON1T (XENONnT or LZ) experiments,\nwithout being in conflict with any other known experimental bounds. While there\nare several sources of backgrounds that can produce single- or few-electron\nevents, a large event rate can be consistent with a dark matter signal and\nshould not be simply written off as purely a detector curiosity. This fact\nmotivates a detailed analysis of the ionization-only (\"S2-only\") data, taking\ninto account the expected annual modulation spectrum of the signal rate, as\nwell as the DM-induced electron-recoil spectra, which are another powerful\ndiscriminant between signal and background.\n", "  Torsion gravity is a natural extension to Einstein gravity in the presence of\nthe fermion matter sources. In this paper we adopt Wald's covariant method of\nNoether charge to construct the quasi-local energy of the\nEinstein-Cartan-fermion system, and find that its explicit expression is\nformally independent of the coupling constant between torsion and axial\ncurrent. This seemingly topological nature is unexpected and is reminiscent of\nsimilar nature of quantum Hall effect and topological insulator. However, the\ncoupling dependence does enter when evaluating it on-shell, and thus the\ntopological nature is pseudo. Based on the expression of the quasi-local\nenergy, we evaluate it for a particular solution on the entanglement wedge and\nfind the agreement with the holographic relative entropy obtained before. This\nshows that the equivalence of these two quantities in the\nEinstein-Cartan-fermion system. Moreover, the quasi-local energy in this case\nis not always positive definite so that it provides an example of swampland in\ntorsion gravity. Based on the covariant Noether charge, we also derive the\nnonzero fermion effect on Komar angular momentum. The implication of our\nresults to the tests of torsion gravity in the future gravitational wave\nastronomy is also discussed.\n", "  Electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant are in principle\nself-excluding, which makes the terms insulator and dielectric usually\nsynonymous. This is certainly true when the electrical carriers are electrons,\nbut not necessarily in a material where ions are extremely mobile, electronic\nconduction is negligible and the charge transfer at the interface is\nimmaterial. Here we demonstrate in a perovskite-derived structure containing\nfive-coordinated Ti atoms, a colossal dielectric constant (up to $\\mbox{10}^9$)\ntogether with very high ionic conduction $\\mbox{10}^{-3}\\mbox{S.cm}^{-1}$ at\nroom temperature. Coupled investigations of I-V and dielectric constant\nbehavior allow to demonstrate that, due to ion migration and accumulation, this\nmaterial behaves like a giant dipole, exhibiting colossal electrical\npolarization (of the order of $\\mbox{0.1\\,C.cm}^{-2}$). Therefore, it may be\nconsidered as a \"ferro-ionet\" and is extremely promising in terms of\napplications.\n", "  Context. Upcoming weak lensing surveys such as Euclid will provide an\nunprecedented opportunity to quantify the geometry and topology of the cosmic\nweb, in particular in the vicinity of lensing clusters. Aims. Understanding the\nconnectivity of the cosmic web with unbiased mass tracers, such as weak\nlensing, is of prime importance to probe the underlying cosmology, seek\ndynamical signatures of dark matter, and quantify environmental effects on\ngalaxy formation. Methods. Mock catalogues of galaxy clusters are extracted\nfrom the N-body PLUS simulation. For each cluster, the aperture multipolar\nmoments of the convergence are calculated in two annuli (inside and outside the\nvirial radius). By stacking their modulus, a statistical estimator is built to\ncharacterise the angular mass distribution around clusters. The moments are\ncompared to predictions from perturbation theory and spherical collapse.\nResults. The main weakly chromatic excess of multipolar power on large scales\nis understood as arising from the contraction of the primordial cosmic web\ndriven by the growing potential well of the cluster. Besides this boost, the\nquadrupole prevails in the cluster (ellipsoidal) core, while at the outskirts,\nharmonic distortions are spread on small angular modes, and trace the\nnon-linear sharpening of the filamentary structures. Predictions for the signal\namplitude as a function of the cluster-centric distance, mass, and redshift are\npresented. The prospects of measuring this signal are estimated for current and\nfuture lensing data sets. Conclusions. The Euclid mission should provide all\nthe necessary information for studying the cosmic evolution of the connectivity\nof the cosmic web around lensing clusters using multipolar moments and probing\nunique signatures of, for example, baryons and warm dark matter.\n", "  We use a direct numerical integration of the Vlasov equation in spherical\nsymmetry with a background gravitational potential to determine the evolution\nof a collection of particles in different models of a galactic halo. Such a\ncollection is assumed to represent a dark matter inhomogeneity which reaches a\nstationary state determined by the virialization of the system. We describe\nsome features of the stationary states and, by using several halo models,\nobtain distinctive signatures for the evolution of the inhomogeneities in each\nof the models.\n", "  We demonstrate that perturbative expansions for quantum many-body systems can\nbe rephrased in terms of tensor networks, thereby providing a natural framework\nfor interpolating perturbative expansions across a quantum phase transition.\nThis approach leads to classes of tensor-network states parametrized by few\nparameters with a clear physical meaning, while still providing excellent\nvariational energies. We also demonstrate how to construct perturbative\nexpansions of the entanglement Hamiltonian, whose eigenvalues form the\nentanglement spectrum, and how the tensor-network approach gives rise to order\nparameters for topological phase transitions.\n", "  We apply imaginary-time evolution, ${\\rm e}^{-\\tau H}$, to study relaxation\ndynamics of gapless quantum antiferromagnets described by the spin-rotation\ninvariant Heisenberg Hamiltonian ($H$). Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations,\nwe propagate an initial state with maximal order parameter $m^z_s$ (the\nstaggered magnetization) in the $z$ spin direction and monitor the expectation\nvalue $\\langle m^z_s\\rangle $ as a function of the time $\\tau$. Different\nsystem sizes of lengths $L$ exhibit an initial size-independent relaxation of\n$\\langle m^z_s\\rangle$ toward its value the spontaneously symmetry-broken\nstate, followed by a size-dependent final decay to zero. We develop a generic\nfinite-size scaling theory which shows that the relaxation time diverges\nasymptotically as $L^z$ where $z$ is the dynamic exponent of the low energy\nexcitations. We use the scaling theory to develop a way of extracting the\ndynamic exponent from the numerical finite-size data. We apply the method to\nspin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnets on two different lattice geometries; the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) square lattice as well as a site-diluted square lattice at\nthe percolation threshold. In the 2D case we obtain $z=2.001(5)$, which is\nconsistent with the known value $z=2$, while for the site-dilutes lattice we\nfind $z=3.90(1)$. This is an improvement on previous estimates of $z\\approx\n3.7$. The scaling results also show a fundamental difference between the two\ncases: In the 2D system the data can be collapsed onto a common scaling\nfunction even when $\\langle m^z_s\\rangle$ is relatively large, reflecting the\nAnderson tower of quantum rotor states with a common dynamic exponent $z=2$.\nFor the diluted lattice, the scaling works only for small $\\langle\nm^z_s\\rangle$, indicating a mixture of different relaxation time scaling\nbetween the low energy states.\n", "  We study capacitance of the 2D topological insulator (TI) edge states. The\ntotal capacitance is combined as a serial circuite of 3 capacitors presenting\ngeometrical $C_G$, quantum $C_Q$ and correlation $C_{corr}$ contributions to\nthe electron energy. If the Coulomb interaction is weak, they obey an\ninequality $C_G<C_Q<C_{corr}$. Quantities $C_G$ and $C_Q$ are found in the case\nof a round TI dot. The quantum capacitance at the finite temperature is\ndetermined taking into account the edge states quantization with and without\nthe magnetic field. We have concluded that, in the accepted approximations,\n$C_{corr}=0$.\n", "  Topological semimetals have attracted extensive research interests for\nrealizing condensed matter physics counterparts of three-dimensional Dirac and\nWeyl fermions, which were originally introduced in high energy physics.\nRecently it has been proposed that type-II Dirac semimetal can host a new type\nof Dirac fermions which break Lorentz invariance and therefore does not have\ncounterpart in high energy physics. Here we report the electronic structure of\nhigh quality PtSe$_2$ crystals to provide direct evidence for the existence of\nthree-dimensional type-II Dirac fermions. A comparison of the crystal,\nvibrational and electronic structure to a sister compound PtTe$_2$ is also\ndiscussed. Our work provides an important platform for exploring the novel\nquantum phenomena in the PtSe$_2$ class of type-II Dirac semimetals.\n", "  A continuum approach to the kaon and pion bound-state problems is used to\nreveal their electromagnetic structure. For both systems, when used with parton\ndistribution amplitudes appropriate to the scale of the experiment, Standard\nModel hard-scattering formulae are accurate to within 25% at momentum transfers\n$Q^2 \\approx 8\\,$GeV$^2$. There are measurable differences between the\ndistribution of strange and normal matter within the kaons, e.g. the ratio of\ntheir separate contributions reaches a peak value of $1.5$ at $Q^2 \\approx\n6\\,$GeV$^2$. Its subsequent $Q^2$-evolution is accurately described by the hard\nscattering formulae. Projections for kaon and pion form factors at timelike\nmomenta beyond the resonance region are also presented. These results and\nprojections should prove useful in planning next-generation experiments.\n", "  Light-matter interactions inside turbid medium can be controlled by tailoring\nthe spatial distribution of energy density throughout the system. Wavefront\nshaping allows selective coupling of incident light to different transmission\neigenchannels, producing dramatically different spatial intensity profiles. In\ncontrast to the density of transmission eigenvalues that is dictated by the\nuniversal bimodal distribution, the spatial structures of the eigenchannels are\nnot universal and depend on the confinement geometry of the system. Here, we\ndevelop and verify a model for the transmission eigenchannel with the\ncorresponding eigenvalue close to unity. By projecting the original problem of\ntwo-dimensional diffusion in a homogeneous scattering medium onto a\none-dimensional inhomogeneous diffusion, we obtain an analytical expression\nrelating the intensity profile to the shape of the confining waveguide.\nInverting this relationship enables the inverse design of the waveguide shape\nto achieve the desired energy distribution for the perfectly transmitting\neigenchannel. Our approach also allows to predict the intensity profile of such\nchannel in a disordered slab with open boundaries, pointing to the possibility\nof controllable delivery of light to different depths with local illumination.\n", "  The modulation instability (MI) is a universal mechanism that is responsible\nfor the disintegration of weakly nonlinear narrow-banded wave fields and the\nemergence of localized extreme events in dispersive media. The instability\ndynamics is naturally triggered, when unstable energy side-bands located around\nthe main energy peak are excited and then follow an exponential growth law. As\na consequence of four wave mixing effect, these primary side-bands generate an\ninfinite number of additional side-bands, forming a triangular side-band\ncascade. After saturation, it is expected that the system experiences a return\nto initial conditions followed by a spectral recurrence dynamics. Much complex\nnonlinear wave field motion is expected, when the secondary or successive\nside-band pair that are created are also located in the finite instability gain\nrange around the main carrier frequency peak. This latter process is referred\nto as higher-order MI. We report a numerical and experimental study that\nconfirm observation of higher-order MI dynamics in water waves. Furthermore, we\nshow that the presence of weak dissipation may counter-intuitively enhance wave\nfocusing in the second recurrent cycle of wave amplification. The\ninterdisciplinary weakly nonlinear approach in addressing the evolution of\nunstable nonlinear waves dynamics may find significant resonance in other\nnonlinear dispersive media in physics, such as optics, solids, superfluids and\nplasma.\n", "  The giant radio relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301 is likely evidence of a Mpc sized\nshock in a massive merging galaxy cluster. However, the exact shock properties\nare still not clearly determined. In particular, the Mach number derived from\nthe integrated radio spectrum exceeds the Mach number derived from the X-ray\ntemperature jump by a factor of two. We present here a numerical study, aiming\nfor a model that is consistent with the majority of observations of this galaxy\ncluster. We first show that in the northern shock upstream X-ray temperature\nand radio data are consistent with each other. We then derive progenitor masses\nfor the system using standard density profiles, X-ray properties and the\nassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. We find a class of models that is\nroughly consistent with weak lensing data, radio data and some of the X-ray\ndata. Assuming a cool-core versus non-cool-core merger, we find a fiducial\nmodel with a total mass of $1.6 \\times 10^{15}\\,M_\\odot$, a mass ratio of 1.76\nand a Mach number that is consistent with estimates from the radio spectrum. We\nare not able to match X-ray derived Mach numbers, because even low mass models\nover-predict the X-ray derived shock speeds. We argue that deep X-ray\nobservations of CIZA J2242.8+5301 will be able to test our model and\npotentially reconcile X-ray and radio derived Mach numbers in relics.\n", "  Inspired by recent results on the non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body\nquantum systems, we study the classical hard rod problem in one dimension with\ninitial domain wall condition. Hard rods are an integrable system, in the sense\nthat for each velocity the density of particles is locally conserved. It was\nproven by Boldrighini, Dobrushin and Sukhov (1983) that on the hydrodynamic\nspace-time scale, the fluid of hard rods satisfies Euler-type equations which\ncomprise all conservation laws. We provide the general solution to these\nequations on the line, with an initial condition where the left and right\nhalves are, asymptotically, in different states. The solution is interpreted as\nbeing composed of a continuum of contact discontinuities, one for each\nvelocity. This is a classical counterpart of the transport problem solved\nrecently in quantum integrable systems. We provide two independent derivations,\none paralleling that in the quantum case, the other using explicitly the\nmicroscopic dynamics. Finally, we discuss the Navier-Stokes (viscous)\ncorrections, and study its effect on the broadening of the contact\ndiscontinuity and on entropy production.\n", "  We study constraints and implications of the recent LHCb measurement of\n${\\cal B}(B_s \\to \\mu^+\\mu^-)$ for tree-level Higgs-mediated flavor-changing\nneutral current (FCNC) interactions. Combined with experimental data on $B_s$\nmass difference $\\Delta m_s$, the $h \\to \\mu \\tau$, and the $h \\to\n\\tau^+\\tau^-$ decay branching ratios from the LHC, we find that the Higgs FCNC\ncouplings are severely constrained. The allowed regions for $B_s \\to \\mu \\tau$,\n$\\tau\\tau$ and $h \\to sb$ decays are obtained. Current data allow large CP\nviolation in the $h \\to \\tau^+ \\tau^-$ decay. Consequences of the Cheng-Sher\nansatz for the Higgs Yukawa couplings are discussed in some detail.\n", "  The p-n junctions dynamics in graphene channel induced by stripe domains\nnucleation, motion and reversal in a ferroelectric substrate is explored using\nself-consistent approach based on Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire phenomenology\ncombined with classical electrostatics. We revealed the extrinsic size effect\nin the dependence of the graphene channel conductivity on its length. For the\ncase of perfect electric contact between the ferroelectric and graphene,\nrelatively low gate voltages are required to induce the pronounced hysteresis\nof ferroelectric polarization and graphene charge in response to the periodic\ngate voltage. Pronounced nonlinear hysteresis of graphene conductance with a\nwide memory window corresponds to high amplitudes of gate voltage. We predict\nthat the considered nano-structure \"top gate/dielectric layer/graphene\nchannel/ferroelectric substrate\" can be a promising candidate for the\nfabrication of new generation of modulators and rectifiers based on the\ngraphene p-n junctions.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that if the transformation of a\nneutron to a mirror neutron exists with an oscillation time of the order of ten\nseconds, it can be detected in a rather simple disappearance and/or\nregeneration type experiment with an intense beam of cold neutrons. In the\npresence of a conjectural mirror magnetic field of unknown magnitude and\ndirection, the resonance transformation conditions can be found by scanning the\nmagnitude of the ordinary magnetic field in the range e.g. $\\pm 100 \\mu$T.\nMagnetic field is assumed to be uniform along the path of neutron beam. If the\ntransformation effect exists within this range, the direction and possible time\nvariation of the mirror magnetic field can be determined with additional\ndedicated measurements.\n", "  On the basis of the L\\\"uscher's finite volume formula, a simple test\n(consistency check or sanity check) is introduced and applied to inspect the\nrecent claims of the existence of the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) bound state(s) for\nheavy quark masses in lattice QCD. We show that the consistency between the\nscattering phase shifts at $k^2 > 0$ and/or $k^2 < 0$ obtained from the lattice\ndata and the behavior of phase shifts from the effective range expansion (ERE)\naround $k^2=0$ exposes the validity of the original lattice data, otherwise\nsuch information is hidden in the energy shift $\\Delta E$ of the two nucleons\non the lattice. We carry out this sanity check for all the lattice results in\nthe literature claiming the existence of the $NN$ bound state(s) for heavy\nquark masses, and find that (i) some of the $NN$ data show clear inconsistency\nbetween the behavior of ERE at $k^2 > 0$ and that at $k^2 < 0$, (ii) some of\nthe $NN$ data exhibit singular behavior of the low energy parameter (such as\nthe divergent effective range) at $k^2<0$, (iii) some of the $NN$ data have the\nunphysical residue for the bound state pole in S-matrix, and (iv) the rest of\nthe $NN$ data are inconsistent among themselves. Furthermore, we raise a\ncaution of using the ERE in the case of the multiple bound states. Our finding,\ntogether with the fake plateau problem previously pointed out by the present\nauthors, brings a serious doubt on the existence of the $NN$ bound states for\npion masses heavier than 300 MeV in the previous studies.\n", "  The capability to isolate one to few unit-cell thin layers from the bulk\nmatrix of layered compounds opens fascinating prospects to engineer novel\nelectronic phases. However, a comprehensive study of the thickness dependence\nand of potential extrinsic effects are paramount to harness the electronic\nproperties of such atomic foils. One striking example is the charge density\nwave (CDW) transition temperature in layered dichalcogenides whose thickness\ndependence remains unclear in the ultrathin limit. Here we present a detailed\nstudy of the thickness and temperature dependences of the CDW in VSe$_2$ by\nscanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). We show that mapping the real-space CDW\nperiodicity over a broad thickness range unique to STM provides essential\ninsight. We introduce a robust derivation of the local order parameter and\ntransition temperature based on the real space charge modulation amplitude.\nBoth quantities exhibit a striking non-monotonic thickness dependence that we\nexplain in terms of a 3D to 2D dimensional crossover in the FS topology. This\nfinding highlights thickness as a true tuning parameter of the electronic\nground state and reconciles seemingly contradicting thickness dependencies\ndetermined in independent transport studies.\n", "  Dwarf galaxies are known to have remarkably low star formation efficiency due\nto strong feedback. Adopting the dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way as a\nlaboratory, we explore a flexible semi-analytic galaxy formation model to\nunderstand how the feedback processes shape the satellite galaxies of the Milky\nWay. Using Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, we exhaustively search a large parameter\nspace of the model and rigorously show that the general wisdom of strong\noutflows as the primary feedback mechanism cannot simultaneously explain the\nstellar mass function and the mass--metallicity relation of the Milky Way\nsatellites. An extended model that assumes that a fraction of baryons is\nprevented from collapsing into low-mass halos in the first place can be\naccurately constrained to simultaneously reproduce those observations. The\ninference suggests that two different physical mechanisms are needed to explain\nthe two different data sets. In particular, moderate outflows with weak halo\nmass dependence are needed to explain the mass--metallicity relation, and\nprevention of baryons falling into shallow gravitational potentials of low-mass\nhalos (e.g. \"pre-heating\") is needed to explain the low stellar mass fraction\nfor a given subhalo mass.\n", "  We study exciton-polariton nonlinear optical fluids in a high momentum regime\nfor the first time. Defects in the fluid develop into dark solitons whose\nhealing length decreases with increasing density. We deduce interaction\nconstants for continuous wave polaritons an order of magnitude larger than with\npicosecond pulses. Time dependent measurements show a 100ps time for the\nbuildup of the interaction strength suggesting a self-generated excitonic\nreservoir as the source of the extra nonlinearity. The experimental results\nagree well with a model of coupled photons, excitons and the reservoir.\n", "  We search for sterile neutrinos in the holographic dark energy cosmology by\nusing the latest observational data. To perform the analysis, we employ the\ncurrent cosmological observations, including the cosmic microwave background\ntemperature power spectrum data from the Planck mission, the baryon acoustic\noscillation measurements, the type Ia supernova data, the redshift space\ndistortion measurements, the shear data of weak lensing observation, the Planck\nlensing measurement, and the latest direct measurement of $H_0$ as well. We\nshow that, compared to the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the holographic dark energy\ncosmology with sterile neutrinos can relieve the tension between the Planck\nobservation and the direct measurement of $H_0$ much better. Once we include\nthe $H_0$ measurement in the global fit, we find that the hint of the existence\nof sterile neutrinos in the holographic dark energy cosmology can be given.\nUnder the constraint of the all-data combination, we obtain $N_{\\rm eff}=\n3.76\\pm0.26$ and $m_{\\nu,\\rm sterile}^{\\rm eff}< 0.215\\,\\rm eV$, indicating\nthat the detection of $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}>0$ in the holographic dark energy\ncosmology is at the $2.75\\sigma$ level and the massless or very light sterile\nneutrino is favored by the current observations.\n", "  We study the spectral properties of the anisotropic part of Hamiltonian\nentering the quantum dynamics of the Mixmaster universe. We derive the explicit\nasymptotic expressions for the energy spectrum in the limit of large and small\nvolumes of the universe. Then we study the threshold condition between both\nregimes. Finally we prove that the spectrum is purely discrete for any volume\nof the universe. Our results validate and improve the known approximations to\nthe anisotropy potential. They should be useful for any approach to the\nquantization of the Mixmaster universe.\n", "  We investigate how various inflationary and bouncing cosmologies can be\nrealized by imperfect fluids with a generalized equation of state, in the\ncontext of both classical and loop quantum cosmology. With regards to the\ninflationary cosmologies, we study the intermediate inflation scenario, the\n$R^2$ inflation scenario and two constant-roll inflation scenarios and with\nregards to the bouncing cosmologies we study the matter bounce scenario, the\nsingular bounce and the super bounce scenario. Within the context of the\nclassical cosmology, we calculate the spectral index of the power spectrum of\nprimordial curvature perturbations, the scalar-to-tensor ratio and the running\nof the spectral index and we compare the resulting picture with the Planck\ndata. As we demonstrate, partial compatibility with the observational data is\nachieved in the imperfect fluid description, however none of the above\nscenarios is in full agreement with data. This result shows that although it is\npossible to realize various cosmological scenarios using different theoretical\nframeworks, it is not guaranteed that all the theoretical descriptions are\nviable.\n", "  We present a method to calculate, without making assumptions about the local\ndark matter velocity distribution, the maximal and minimal number of signal\nevents in a direct detection experiment given a set of constraints from other\ndirect detection experiments and/or neutrino telescopes. The method also allows\nto determine the velocity distribution that optimizes the signal rates. We\nillustrate our method with three concrete applications: i) to derive a\nhalo-independent upper limit on the cross section from a set of null results,\nii) to confront in a halo-independent way a detection claim to a set of null\nresults and iii) to assess, in a halo-independent manner, the prospects for\ndetection in a future experiment given a set of current null results.\n", "  Long-range ion induced water-water correlations were recently observed in\nfemtosecond elastic second harmonic scattering experiments of electrolyte\nsolutions. To further the qualitative understanding of these correlations, we\nderive an analytical expression that quantifies ion induced dipole-dipole\ncorrelations in a non-interacting gas of dipoles. This model is a logical\nextension of Debye-H\\\"uckel theory that can be used to qualitatively understand\nhow the combined electric field of the ions induces correlations in the\norientational distributions of the water molecules in an aqueous solution. The\nmodel agrees with results from molecular dynamics simulations and provides an\nimportant starting point for further theoretical work.\n", "  I will briefly discuss three cosmological models built upon three distinct\nquantum gravity proposals. I will first highlight the cosmological role of a\nvector field in the framework of a string/brane cosmological model. I will then\npresent the resolution of the big bang singularity and the occurrence of an\nearly era of accelerated expansion of a geometric origin, in the framework of\ngroup field theory condensate cosmology. I will then summarise results from an\nextended gravitational model based on non-commutative spectral geometry, a\nmodel that offers a purely geometric explanation for the standard model of\nparticle physics.\n", "  The efficiency of solar energy harvesting systems is largely determined by\ntheir ability to transfer excitations from the antenna to the energy trapping\ncenter before recombination. Dark state protection, achieved by coherent\ncoupling between subunits in the antenna structure, can significantly reduce\nradiative recombination and enhance the efficiency of energy trapping. Because\nthe dark states cannot be populated by optical transitions from the ground\nstate, they are usually accessed through phononic relaxation from the bright\nstates. In this study, we explore a novel way of connecting the dark states and\nthe bright states via optical transitions. In a ring-like chromophore system\ninspired by natural photosynthetic antennae, the single-excitation bright state\ncan be optically connected to the lowest energy single-excitation dark state\nthrough certain double-excitation states. We call such double-excitation states\nthe ferry states and show that they are the result of accidental degeneracy\nbetween two categories of double-excitation states. We then mathematically\nprove that the ferry states are only available when N, the number of subunits\non the ring, satisfies N=4l+2 (l being an integer). Numerical calculations\nconfirm that the ferry states enhance the energy transfer power of our model,\nshowing a significant energy transfer power spike at N=6 compared with smaller\nN values, even without phononic relaxation. The proposed mathematical theory\nfor the ferry states is not restricted to this one particular system or\nnumerical model. In fact, it is potentially applicable to any coherent optical\nsystem that adopts a ring-shaped chromophore arrangement. Beyond the ideal\ncase, the ferry state mechanism also demonstrates robustness under weak\nphononic dissipation, weak site energy disorder, and large coupling strength\ndisorder.\n", "  Correlation femtoscopy allows one to measure the space-time characteristics\nof particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions due to the effects\nof quantum statistics (QS) and final state interactions (FSI). The main\nfeatures of the femtoscopy measurements at top RHIC and LHC energies are\nconsidered as a manifestation of strong collective flow and are well\ninterpreted within hydrodynamic models employing equation of state (EoS) with a\ncrossover type transition between Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and hadron gas\nphases. The femtoscopy at lower energies was intensively studied at AGS and SPS\naccelerators and is being studied now in the Beam Energy Scan program (BES) at\nthe BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the context of exploration of the\nQCD phase diagram. In this article we present femtoscopic observables\ncalculated for Au-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7 - 62.4$ GeV in a\nviscous hydro + cascade model vHLLE+UrQMD and their dependence on the EoS of\nthermalized matter.\n", "  In this note we continue analysing the non-equilibrium dynamics in the\n$(T^2)^n/\\mathbb{Z}_n$ orbifold conformal field theory. We compute the\nout-of-time-ordered four-point correlators with twist operators. For rational\n$\\eta \\ (=p/q)$ which is the square of the compactification radius, we find\nthat the correlators approach non-trivial constants at late time. For $n=2$\nthey are expressed in terms of the modular matrices and for higher $n$\norbifolds are functions of $pq$ and $n$. For irrational $\\eta$, we find a new\npolynomial decay of the correlators that is a signature of an intermediate\nregime between rational and chaotic models.\n", "  We investigate the origin of observed local star formation relations using\nradiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent star formation\nand ionising radiation. We compare these clouds to the density distributions of\nlocal star-forming clouds and find that the most diffuse simulated clouds match\nthe observed clouds relatively well. We then compute both\nobservationally-motivated and theoretically-motivated star formation\nefficiencies (SFEs) for these simulated clouds. By including ionising\nradiation, we can reproduce the observed SFEs in the clouds most similar to\nnearby Milky Way clouds. For denser clouds, the SFE can approach unity. These\nobserved SFEs are typically 3 to 10 times larger than the \"total\" SFEs, i.e.\nthe fraction of the initial cloud mass converted to stars. Converting observed\nto total SFEs is non-trivial. We suggest some techniques for doing so, though\nestimate up to a factor of ten error in the conversion.\n", "  In living cells, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by specific enzymes and\nconnect to one another by sharing substrates and products, forming complex\nnetworks. In our previous studies, we established a framework determining the\nresponses to enzyme perturbations only from network topology, and then proved a\ntheorem, called the law of localization, explaining response patterns in terms\nof network topology. In this paper, we generalize these results to reaction\nnetworks with conserved concentrations, which allows us to study any reaction\nsystems. We also propose novel network characteristics quantifying robustness.\nWe compare E. coli metabolic network with randomly rewired networks, and find\nthat the robustness of the E. coli network is significantly higher than that of\nthe random networks.\n", "  The Fermi edge singularity (FES) is a prominent manifestation of the Coulomb\ninteraction. It can be observed in a controllable way by studying the transport\nthrough a quantum dot (QD), which is electrostatically coupled to the leads. In\nthis paper we study how FES affects higher order tunneling processes\n(cotunneling). To address this problem we use the bosonic description of the\nelectrons in the leads, which naturally accounts for the Coulomb interaction.\nWe report the multiscale dependence of the current through the QD on the energy\nof the QD level and on the bias between the leads obtained for the limit of\nlarge and small bias. The new universal powers are determined by the scattering\nphases due to the interaction of electrons in the leads with the charge on the\nQD.\n", "  In this article we define and quantize a truncated form of the nonassociative\nand noncommutative Snyder phi^4 field theory using the functional method in\nmomentum space. More precisely, the action is approximated by expanding up to\nthe linear order in the Snyder deformation parameter beta, producing an\neffective model on commutative spacetime for the computation of the two-, four-\nand six-point functions. The two- and four-point functions at one loop have the\nsame structure as at the tree level, with UV divergences faster than in the\ncommutative theory. The same behavior appears in the six-point function, with a\nlogarithmic UV divergence and renders the theory unrenormalizable at beta^1\norder except for the special choice of free parameters s_1=-s_2. We expect\neffects from nonassociativity on the correlation functions at beta^1 order, but\nthese are cancelled due to the average over permutations.\n", "  We have performed first-principles investigations on the native defects in\nthe full Heusler alloys Co$_2$Ti$Z$ ($Z$ one of the group IV elements Si, Ge,\nSn), determining their formation energies and how they influence the transport\nproperties. We find that Co vacancies (Vc) in all compounds and the\nTi$_\\text{Sn}$ anti-site exhibit negative formation energies. The smallest\npositive values occur for Co in excess on anti-sites (Co$_Z$ or Co$_\\text{Ti}$)\nand for Ti$_Z$. The most abundant native defects were modeled as dilute alloys,\ntreated with the coherent potential approximation in combination with the\nmultiple-scattering theory Green function approach. The self-consistent\npotentials determined this way were used to calculate the residual resistivity\nvia the Kubo-Greenwood formula and, based on its energy dependence, the Seebeck\ncoefficient of the systems. The latter is shown to depend significantly on the\ntype of defect, leading to variations that are related to subtle, spin-orbit\ncoupling induced, changes in the electronic structure above the half-metallic\ngap. Two of the systems, Vc$_\\text{Co}$ and Co$_Z$, are found to exhibit a\nnegative Seebeck coefficient. This observation, together with their low\nformation energy, offers an explanation for the experimentally observed\nnegative Seebeck coefficient of the Co$_2$Ti$Z$ compounds as being due to\nunintentionally created native defects.\n", "  Here we report the fabrication and characterization of fully superconducting\nquantum interference proximity transistors (SQUIPTs) based on the\nimplementation of vanadium (V) in the superconducting loop. At low temperature,\nthe devices show high flux-to-voltage (up to 0.52$\\ \\textrm{mV}/\\Phi_0$) and\nflux-to-current (above 12$\\ \\textrm{nA}/\\Phi_0$) transfer functions, with the\nbest estimated flux sensitivity $\\sim$2.6$\\ \\mu\\Phi_0/\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$\nreached under fixed voltage bias, where $\\Phi_0$ is the flux quantum. The\ninterferometers operate up to $T_\\textrm{bath}\\simeq$ 2 $ \\textrm{K}$, with an\nimprovement of 70$\\%$ of the maximal operating temperature with respect to\nearly SQUIPTs design. The main features of the V-based SQUIPT are described\nwithin a simplified theoretical model. Our results open the way to the\nrealization of SQUIPTs that take advantage of the use of higher-gap\nsuperconductors for ultra-sensitive nanoscale applications that operate at\ntemperatures well above 1 K.\n", "  In a core-collapse supernova, a huge amount of energy is released in the\nKelvin-Helmholtz phase subsequent to the explosion, when the proto-neutron star\ncools and deleptonizes as it loses neutrinos. Most of this energy is emitted\nthrough neutrinos, but a fraction of it can be released through gravitational\nwaves. We model the evolution of a proto-neutron star in the Kelvin-Helmholtz\nphase using a general relativistic numerical code, and a recently proposed\nfinite temperature, many-body equation of state; from this we consistently\ncompute the diffusion coefficients driving the evolution. To include the\nmany-body equation of state, we develop a new fitting formula for the high\ndensity baryon free energy at finite temperature and intermediate proton\nfraction. We estimate the emitted neutrino signal, assessing its detectability\nby present terrestrial detectors, and we determine the frequencies and damping\ntimes of the quasi-normal modes which would characterize the gravitational wave\nsignal emitted in this stage.\n", "  We present the results of a combined fit of the reactor antineutrino rates\nand the Daya Bay measurement of $\\sigma_{f,235}$ and $\\sigma_{f,239}$. The\ncombined fit leads to a better determination of the two cross sections per\nfission: $\\sigma_{f,235} = 6.29 \\pm 0.08$ and $\\sigma_{f,239} = 4.24 \\pm 0.21 $\nin units of $10^{-43} \\, \\text{cm}^2 / \\text{fission}$, with respective\nuncertainties of about $1.2\\%$ and $4.9\\%$. Since the respective deviations\nfrom the theoretical cross sections per fission are $2.5\\sigma$ and\n$0.7\\sigma$, we conclude that, if the reactor antineutrino anomaly is not due\nto active-sterile neutrino oscillations, it is likely that it can be solved\nwith a revaluation of the $^{235}\\text{U}$ reactor antineutrino flux. However,\nthe $^{238}\\text{U}$, $^{239}\\text{Pu}$, and $^{241}\\text{Pu}$ fluxes, which\nhave larger uncertainties, could also be significantly different from the\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  We provide a complete classification of all abelian gauge invariant $p$-form\ntheories with equations of motion depending only on the second derivative of\nthe field---the $p$-form analogues of the Galileon scalar field theory. We\nconstruct explicitly the nontrivial actions that exist for spacetime dimension\n$D\\leq11$, but our methods are general enough and can be extended to arbitrary\n$D$. We uncover in particular a new $4$-form Galileon cubic theory in $D\\geq8$\ndimensions. As a by-product we give a simple proof of the fact that the\nequations of motion depend on the $p$-form gauge fields only through their\nfield strengths, and show this explicitly for the recently discovered $3$-form\nGalileon quartic theory.\n", "  We present the results of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with zoom-in\ninitial conditions, and investigate the formation of the first galaxies and\ntheir evolution towards observable galaxies at $z \\sim 6$. We focus on three\ndifferent galaxies which end up in halos with masses $M_{h} = 2.4\n\\times10^{10}~h^{-1}\\; M_{\\odot}$ (Halo-10), $1.6 \\times10^{11}~h^{-1}\\;\nM_{\\odot}$ (Halo-11) and $0.7 \\times10^{12}~h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ (Halo-12) at z=6.\nOur simulations also probe impacts of different sub-grid assumptions, i.e., SF\nefficiency and cosmic reionization, on SF histories in the first galaxies. We\nfind that star formation occurs intermittently due to supernova (SN) feedback\nat z > 10, and then it proceeds more smoothly as the halo mass grows at lower\nredshifts. Galactic disks are destroyed due to SN feedback, while galaxies in\nsimulations with no-feedback or lower SF efficiency models can sustain galactic\ndisk for long periods > 10 Myr. The expulsion of gas at the galactic center\nalso affects the inner dark matter density profile. However, SN feedback does\nnot seem to keep the shallow profile of dark matter for a long period. Our\nsimulated galaxies in Halo-11 and Halo-12 reproduce the star formation rates\n(SFR) and stellar masses of observed Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at z = 7-8\nfairly well given observational uncertainties. In addition, we investigate the\neffect of UV background radiation on star formation as an external feedback\nsource, and find that earlier reionization extends the quenching time of star\nformation due to photo-ionization heating, but does not affect the stellar mass\nat z=6.\n", "  We study CPT and Lorentz violation in the electroweak gauge sector of the\nStandard Model in the context of the Standard-Model Extension. In particular,\nwe consider the Lorentz-violating and CPT-odd Chern-Simons like parameter for\nthe W boson, which is thus far unbounded by experiment. We demonstrate that any\nnon-zero value of this parameter implies that, for sufficiently large energies,\none of the polarization modes of the W boson propagates with spacelike\nfour-momentum. In this scenario, emission of W bosons by ultra-high-energy\ncosmic rays is possible. We calculate the induced fermion energy-loss rate and\nwe deduce the first limit on the pertinent Lorentz- and CPT-violating parameter\nthat couples to the W boson. Consistency between the quantum description in\nvarious reference frames is preserved by using a recently formulated covariant\nquantization procedure for massive photons and applying it to the W bosons.\n", "  Type II-plateau supernovae (SNe IIP) are the most numerous subclass of\ncore-collapse SNe originating from massive stars. In the framework of the\nneutrino-driven explosion mechanism, we study the SN outburst properties for a\nred supergiant progenitor model and compare the corresponding light curves with\nobservations of the ordinary Type IIP SN 1999em. Three-dimensional (3D)\nsimulations of (parametrically triggered) neutrino-driven explosions are\nperformed with the (explicit, finite-volume, Eulerian, multifluid\nhydrodynamics) code PROMETHEUS, using a presupernova model of a 15 Msun star as\ninitial data. At approaching homologous expansion, the hydrodynamical and\ncomposition variables of the 3D models are mapped to a spherically symmetric\nconfiguration, and the simulations are continued with the (implicit, Lagrangian\nradiation-hydrodynamics) code CRAB to follow the blast-wave evolution during\nthe SN outburst. Our 3D neutrino-driven explosion model with an explosion\nenergy of about 0.5x10^51 erg produces Ni-56 in rough agreement with the amount\ndeduced from fitting the radioactively powered light-curve tail of SN 1999em.\nThe considered presupernova model, 3D explosion simulations, and light-curve\ncalculations can explain the basic observational features of SN 1999em, except\nfor those connected to the presupernova structure of the outer stellar layers.\nOur 3D simulations show that the distribution of Ni-rich matter in velocity\nspace is asymmetric with a strong dipole component that is consistent with the\nobservations of SN 1999em. The monotonic luminosity decline from the plateau to\nthe radioactive tail in ordinary SNe IIP is a manifestation of the intense\nturbulent mixing at the He/H composition interface.\n", "  We consider the response of the density of a fermion ensemble to an applied\nweak static magnetic field. It is known that for non-interacting Fermi gas,\nthis response is fully characterized by the Fermi volume and the Berry\ncurvature on the Fermi surface. Here we show the same result holds for\ninteracting fermions, including Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid, to all\norders in perturbation theory. Our result relies only on the assumption of a\nwell-defined Fermi surface and the general analytic properties of quantum field\ntheory, and is completely model independent.\n", "  We calculate the single transverse spin asymmetries(SSA) for forward\ninclusive particle production in pp and pA collisions using a hybrid approach.\nIt is shown that the Sivers type contribution to the SSA drops out due to color\nentanglement effect, whereas the fragmentation contribution to the spin\nasymmetry is not affected by color entanglement effect. This finding offers a\nnatural solution for the sign mismatch problem.\n", "  Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) thermostats have been used very\neffectively as a tool to manipulate and optimize the sampling of thermodynamic\nensembles and the associated static properties. Here we show that a similar,\nexquisite level of control can be achieved for the dynamical properties\ncomputed from thermostatted trajectories. By developing quantitative measures\nof the disturbance induced by the GLE to the Hamiltonian dynamics of a harmonic\noscillator, we show that these analytical results accurately predict the\nbehavior of strongly anharmonic systems. We also show that it is possible to\ncorrect, to a significant extent, the effects of the GLE term onto the\ncorresponding microcanonical dynamics, which puts on more solid grounds the use\nof non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics to approximate quantum nuclear effects and\ncould help improve the prediction of dynamical quantities from techniques that\nuse a Langevin term to stabilize dynamics. Finally we address the use of\nthermostats in the context of approximate path-integral-based models of quantum\nnuclear dynamics. We demonstrate that a custom-tailored GLE can alleviate some\nof the artifacts associated with these techniques, improving the quality of\nresults for the modelling of vibrational dynamics of molecules, liquids and\nsolids.\n", "  Current constraints on models of galaxy evolution rely on morphometric\ncatalogs extracted from multi-band photometric surveys. However, these catalogs\nare altered by selection effects that are difficult to model, that correlate in\nnon trivial ways, and that can lead to contradictory predictions if not taken\ninto account carefully. To address this issue, we have developed a new approach\ncombining parametric Bayesian indirect likelihood (pBIL) techniques and\nempirical modeling with realistic image simulations that reproduce a large\nfraction of these selection effects. This allows us to perform a direct\ncomparison between observed and simulated images and to infer robust\nconstraints on model parameters. We use a semi-empirical forward model to\ngenerate a distribution of mock galaxies from a set of physical parameters.\nThese galaxies are passed through an image simulator reproducing the\ninstrumental characteristics of any survey and are then extracted in the same\nway as the observed data. The discrepancy between the simulated and observed\ndata is quantified, and minimized with a custom sampling process based on\nadaptive Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. Using synthetic data matching most\nof the properties of a CFHTLS Deep field, we demonstrate the robustness and\ninternal consistency of our approach by inferring the parameters governing the\nsize and luminosity functions and their evolutions for different realistic\npopulations of galaxies. We also compare the results of our approach with those\nobtained from the classical spectral energy distribution fitting and\nphotometric redshift approach.Our pipeline infers efficiently the luminosity\nand size distribution and evolution parameters with a very limited number of\nobservables (3 photometric bands). When compared to SED fitting based on the\nsame set of observables, our method yields results that are more accurate and\nfree from systematic biases.\n", "  During the Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project (STORM)\nobservations of NGC 5548, the continuum and emission-line variability became\nde-correlated during the second half of the 6-month long observing campaign.\nHere we present Swift and Chandra X-ray spectra of NGC 5548 obtained as a part\nof the campaign. The Swift spectra show that excess flux (relative to a\npower-law continuum) in the soft X-ray band appears before the start of the\nanomalous emission-line behavior, peaks during the period of the anomaly, and\nthen declines. This is a model-independent result suggesting that the soft\nexcess is related to the anomaly. We divide the Swift data into on- and\noff-anomaly spectra to characterize the soft excess via spectral fitting. The\ncause of the spectral differences is likely due to a change in the intrinsic\nspectrum rather than being due to variable obscuration or partial covering. The\nChandra spectra have lower signal-to-noise ratios, but are consistent with\nSwift data. Our preferred model of the soft excess is emission from an\noptically thick, warm Comptonizing corona, the effective optical depth of which\nincreases during the anomaly. This model simultaneously explains all the three\nobservations: the UV emission line flux decrease, the soft-excess increase, and\nthe emission line anomaly.\n", "  Hydrodynamic, non-magnetic instabilities can provide turbulent stress in the\nregions of protoplanetary discs, where the MRI can not develop. The induced\nmotions influence the grain growth, from which formation of planetesimals\nbegins. Thermal relaxation of the gas constrains origins of the identified\nhydrodynamic sources of turbulence in discs.\n  We estimate the radiative relaxation timescale of temperature perturbations\nand study the dependence of this timescale on the perturbation wavelength, the\nlocation within the disc, the disc mass, and the dust-to-gas mass ratio. We\nthen apply thermal relaxation criteria to localise modes of the convective\noverstability, the vertical shear instability, and the zombie vortex\ninstability.\n  Our calculations employed the latest tabulated dust and gas mean opacities\nand we account for the collisional coupling to the emitting species.\n  The relaxation criterion defines the bulk of a typical T Tauri disc as\nunstable to the development of linear hydrodynamic instabilities. The midplane\nis unstable to the convective overstability from at most $2\\mbox{ au}$ and up\nto $40\\mbox{ au}$, as well as beyond $140\\mbox{ au}$. The vertical shear\ninstability can develop between $15\\mbox{ au}$ and $180\\mbox{ au}$. The\nsuccessive generation of (zombie) vortices from a seeded noise can work within\nthe inner $0{.}8\\mbox{ au}$.\n  Dynamic disc modelling with the evolution of dust and gas opacities is\nrequired to clearly localise the hydrodynamic turbulence, and especially its\nnon-linear phase.\n", "  Usually when applying the mimetic model to the early universe, higher\nderivative terms are needed to promote the mimetic field to be dynamical.\nHowever such models suffer from the ghost and/or the gradient instabilities and\nsimple extensions cannot cure this pathology. We point out in this paper that\nit is possible to overcome this difficulty by considering the direct couplings\nof the higher derivatives of the mimetic field to the curvature of the\nspacetime.\n", "  Variables for constraint free null canonical vacuum general relativity are\npresented which have simple Poisson brackets that facilitate quantization. Free\ninitial data for vacuum general relativity on a pair of intersecting null\nhypersurfaces has been known since the 1960s. These consist of the \"main\" data\nwhich are set on the bulk of the two null hypersurfaces, and additional\n\"surface\" data set only on their intersection 2-surface. More recently the\ncomplete set of Poisson brackets of such data has been obtained. However the\ncomplexity of these brackets is an obstacle to their quantization. Part of this\ndifficulty may be overcome using methods from the treatment of cylindrically\nsymmetric gravity. Specializing from general to cylindrically symmetric\nsolutions changes the Poisson algebra of the null initial data surprisingly\nlittle, but cylindrically symmetric vacuum general relativity is an integrable\nsystem, making powerful tools available. Here a transformation is constructed\nat the cylindrically symmetric level which maps the main initial data to new\ndata forming a Poisson algebra for which an exact deformation quantization is\nknown. (Although an auxiliary condition on the data has been quantized only in\nthe asymptotically flat case, and a suitable representation of the algebra of\nquantum data by operators on a Hilbert space has not yet been found.) The\ndefinition of the new main data generalizes naturally to arbitrary,\nsymmetryless gravitational fields, with the Poisson brackets retaining their\nsimplicity. The corresponding generalization of the quantization is however\nambiguous and requires further analysis.\n", "  We study the possibility of a hadron-quark phase transition in the interior\nof neutron stars, taking into account different schematic evolutionary stages\nat finite temperature. Furthermore, we analyze the astrophysical properties of\nhot and cold hybrid stars, considering the constraint on maximum mass given by\nthe pulsars J1614-2230 and J1614-2230. We obtain cold hybrid stars with maximum\nmasses $\\geq 2$ M$_{\\odot}$. Our study also suggest that during the\nproto-hybrid star evolution a late phase transition between hadronic matter and\nquark matter could occur, in contrast with previous studies of proto-neutron\nstars.\n", "  A search for supersymmetry is presented based on multijet events with large\nmissing transverse momentum produced in proton-proton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. The data, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns, were collected with the CMS\ndetector at the CERN LHC in 2016. The analysis utilizes four-dimensional\nexclusive search regions defined in terms of the number of jets, the number of\ntagged bottom quark jets, the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, and the\nmagnitude of the vector sum of jet transverse momenta. No evidence for a\nsignificant excess of events is observed relative to the expectation from the\nstandard model. Limits on the cross sections for the pair production of gluinos\nand squarks are derived in the context of simplified models. Assuming the\nlightest supersymmetric particle to be a weakly interacting neutralino, 95%\nconfidence level lower limits on the gluino mass as large as 1800 to 1960 GeV\nare derived, and on the squark mass as large as 960 to 1390 GeV, depending on\nthe production and decay scenario.\n", "  The directed-loop quantum Monte Carlo method is generalized to the case of\nretarded interactions. Using the path integral, fermion-boson or spin-boson\nmodels are mapped to actions with retarded interactions by analytically\nintegrating out the bosons. This yields an exact algorithm that combines the\nhighly-efficient loop updates available in the stochastic series expansion\nrepresentation with the advantages of avoiding a direct sampling of the bosons.\nThe application to electron-phonon models reveals that the method overcomes the\npreviously detrimental issues of long autocorrelation times and exponentially\ndecreasing acceptance rates. For example, the resulting dramatic speedup allows\nus to investigate the Peierls quantum phase transition on chains of up to\n$1282$ sites.\n", "  We argue that quantum fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter may\nstrongly affect the electron density of states (DOS) in ultrathin\nsuperconducting wires. We demonstrate that the effect of such fluctuations is\nequivalent to that of a quantum dissipative environment formed by sound-like\nplasma modes propagating along the wire. We derive a non-perturbative\nexpression for the local electron DOS in superconducting nanowires which fully\naccounts for quantum phase fluctuations. At any non-zero temperature these\nfluctuations smear out the square-root singularity in DOS near the\nsuperconducting gap and generate quasiparticle states at subgap energies.\nFurthermore, at sufficiently large values of the wire impedance this\nsingularity is suppressed down to $T=0$ in which case DOS tends to zero at\nsubgap energies and exhibits the power-law behavior above the gap. Our\npredictions can be directly tested in tunneling experiments with\nsuperconducting nanowires.\n", "  Characterization of the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets relies on\naccurate measurements of the extent of the optically thick area of the planet\nat multiple wavelengths with a precision $\\lesssim$100 parts per million (ppm).\nNext-generation instruments onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are\nexpected to achieve $\\sim$10 ppm precision for several tens of targets. A\nsimilar precision can be obtained in modelling only if other astrophysical\neffects, including the stellar limb-darkening, are accounted for properly. In\nthis paper, we explore the limits on precision due to the mathematical formulas\ncurrently adopted to approximate the stellar limb-darkening, and to the use of\nlimb-darkening coefficients obtained either from stellar-atmosphere models or\nempirically. We propose a new limb-darkening law with two coefficients,\n`power-2', which outperforms other two-coefficient laws adopted in the\nliterature in most cases, and particularly for cool stars. Empirical\nlimb-darkening based on two-coefficient formulas can be significantly biased,\neven if the light-curve residuals are nearly photon-noise limited. We\ndemonstrate an optimal strategy to fitting for the four-coefficients\nlimb-darkening in the visible, using prior information on the exoplanet orbital\nparameters to break some of the degeneracies that otherwise would prevent the\nconvergence of the fit. Infrared observations taken with the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) will provide accurate measurements of the exoplanet orbital\nparameters with unprecedented precision, which can be used as priors to improve\nthe stellar limb-darkening characterization, and therefore the inferred\nexoplanet parameters, from observations in the visible, such as those taken\nwith Kepler/K2, JWST, other past and future instruments.\n", "  By using the relations between the slow-roll parameters and the power\nspectrum for the single field slow-roll inflation, we derive the scalar\nspectral tilt $n_s$ and the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ for the constant\nslow-roll inflation and obtain the constraint on the slow-roll parameter $\\eta$\nfrom the Planck 2015 results. The inflationary potential for the constant\nslow-roll inflation is then reconstructed in the framework of both general\nrelativity and scalar-tensor theory of gravity, and compared with the recently\nreconstructed E model potential. In the strong coupling limit, we show that the\n$\\eta$ attractor is reached.\n", "  Recently, some very strong correlations between the distribution of dark\nmatter and baryons (the dark matter-baryon relations) in galaxies with very\ndifferent morphologies, masses, sizes, and gas fractions have been obtained.\nSome models have been suggested to explain why the dark matter contribution is\nfully specified by that of the baryons. In this article, we derive two analytic\nexpressions to explain the observed dark matter-baryon relations based on the\ncold dark matter (CDM) model. The resultant expressions give excellent\nagreement with the observational data. The parameters involved in the analytic\nexpressions are closely related to the amount of the baryon content. This model\ncan provide a theoretical understanding of the strong correlations observed. We\nsuggest that the observed relation represents the end product of galaxy\nformation.\n", "  We investigate the anisotropic hybrid plasmon-SO phonon dispersion relations\nin monolayer and double-layer phosphorene systems located on the polar\nsubstrates, such as SiO2, h-BN and Al2O3. We calculate these hybrid modes with\nusing the dynamical dielectric function in the RPA by considering the\nelectron-electron interaction and long-range electric field generated by the\nsubstrate SO phonons via Frohlich interaction. In the long-wavelength limit, we\nobtain some analytical expressions for the hybrid plasmon-SO phonon dispersion\nrelations which represent the behavior of these modes akin to the modes\nobtaining from the loss function. Our results indicate a strong anisotropy in\nplasmon-SO phonon modes, whereas they are stronger along the light-mass\ndirection in our heterostructures. Furthermore, we find that the type of\nsubstrate has a significant effect on the dispersion relations of the coupled\nmodes. Also, by tuning the misalignment and separation between layers in\ndouble-layer phosphorene on polar substrates, we can engineer the hybrid modes.\n", "  We derive new representations of the Einstein-Hilbert action in which\ngraviton perturbation theory is immensely simplified. To accomplish this, we\nrecast the Einstein-Hilbert action as a theory of purely cubic interactions\namong gravitons and a single auxiliary field. The corresponding equations of\nmotion are the Einstein field equations rewritten as two coupled first-order\ndifferential equations. Since all Feynman diagrams are cubic, we are able to\nderive new off-shell recursion relations for tree-level graviton scattering\namplitudes. With a judicious choice of gauge fixing, we then construct an\nespecially compact form for the Einstein-Hilbert action in which all graviton\ninteractions are simply proportional to the graviton kinetic term. Our results\napply to graviton perturbations about an arbitrary curved background spacetime.\n", "  Non-adiabatic decay rates for a radio-frequency dressed magnetic trap are\ncalculated using Fermi's Golden Rule: that is, we examine the probability for a\nsingle atom to make transitions out of the dressed trap and into a continuum in\nthe adiabatic limit, where perturbation theory can be applied. This approach\ncan be compared to the semi-classical Landau-Zener theory of a resonant dressed\natom trap, and it is found that, when carefully implemented, the Landau-Zener\ntheory overestimates the rate of non-adiabatic spin flip transitions in the\nadiabatic limit. This indicates that care is needed when determining\nrequirements on trap Rabi frequency and magnetic field gradient in practical\natom traps.\n", "  We analyze, from a quantum information theory perspective, the possibility of\nrealizing a SU(4) entangled Kondo regime in semiconductor double quantum dot\ndevices. We focus our analysis on the ground state properties and consider the\ngeneral experimental situation where the coupling parameters of the two quantum\ndots differ. We model each quantum dot with an Anderson type Hamiltonian\nincluding an interdot Coulomb repulsion and tunnel couplings for each quantum\ndot to independent fermionic baths. We find that the spin and pseudospin\nentanglements can be made equal, and the SU(4) symmetry recovered, if the gate\nvoltages are chosen in such a way that the average charge occupancies of the\ntwo quantum dots are equal, and the double occupancy on the double quantum dot\nis suppressed. We present density matrix renormalization group numerical\nresults for the spin and pseudospin entanglement entropies, and analytical\nresults for a simplified model that captures the main physics of the problem.\n", "  Computational studies of supercooled liquids often focus on various analyses\nof their \"underlying inherent states\" --- the glassy configurations at zero\ntemperature obtained by an infinitely-fast (instantaneous) quench from\nequilibrium supercooled states. Similar protocols are also regularly employed\nin investigations of the unjamming transition at which the rigidity of\ndecompressed soft-sphere packings is lost. Here we investigate the statistics\nand localization properties of low-frequency vibrational modes of glassy\nconfigurations obtained by such instantaneous quenches. We show that the\ndensity of vibrational modes grows as $\\omega^\\beta$ with $\\beta$ depending on\nthe parent temperature $T_{0}$ from which the glassy configurations were\ninstantaneously quenched. For quenches from high temperature liquid states we\nfind $\\beta\\!\\approx\\!3$, whereas $\\beta$ appears to approach the\npreviously-observed value $\\beta\\!=\\!4$ as $T_0$ approaches the glass\ntransition temperature. We discuss the consistency of our findings with the\ntheoretical framework of the Soft Potential Model, and contrast them with\nsimilar measurements performed on configurations obtained by continuous\nquenches at finite cooling rates. Our results suggest that any physical quench\nat rates sufficiently slower than the inverse vibrational timescale ---\nincluding all physically-realistic quenching rates of molecular or atomistic\nglasses --- would result in a glass whose density of vibrational modes is\nuniversally characterized by $\\beta\\!=\\!4$.\n", "  The existence of static, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar field\nsolutions in the context of Born-Infeld gravity is explored. Upon a combination\nof analytical approximations and numerical methods, the equations for a free\nscalar field (without a potential term) are solved, verifying that the\nsolutions recover the predictions of General Relativity far from the center but\nfinding important new effects in the central regions. We find two classes of\nobjects depending on the ratio between the Schwarzschild radius and a length\nscale associated to the Born-Infeld theory: massive solutions have a wormhole\nstructure, with their throat at $r\\approx 2M$, while for the lighter\nconfigurations the topology is Euclidean. The total energy density of these\nsolutions exhibits a solitonic profile with a maximum peaked away from the\ncenter, and located at the throat whenever a wormhole exists. The geodesic\nstructure and curvature invariants are analyzed for the various configurations\nconsidered.\n", "  We show that quasi-PDFs may be treated as hybrids of PDFs and primordial\nrest-frame momentum distributions of partons. This results in a complicated\nconvolution nature of quasi-PDFs that necessitates using large $p_3 \\sim 3$ GeV\nmomenta to get reasonably close to the PDF limit. As an alternative approach,\nwe propose to use pseudo-PDFs $P(x, z_3^2)$ that generalize the light-front\nPDFs onto spacelike intervals and are related to Ioffe-time distributions $M\n(\\nu, z_3^2)$, the functions of the Ioffe time $\\nu = p_3 z_3$ and the distance\nparameter $z_3^2$ with respect to which it displays perturbative evolution for\nsmall $z_3$. In this form, one may divide out the $z_3^2$ dependence coming\nfrom the primordial rest-frame distribution and from the problematic factor due\nto lattice renormalization of the gauge link. The $\\nu$-dependence remains\nintact and determines the shape of PDFs.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement entropy in 1+1-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge\ntheories with various matter fields using the lattice regularization. Here we\nuse extended Hilbert space definition for entanglement entropy, which contains\nthree contributions; (1) classical Shannon entropy associated with\nsuperselection sector distribution, where sectors are labelled by irreducible\nrepresentations of boundary penetrating fluxes, (2) logarithm of the dimensions\nof their representations, which is associated with \"color entanglement\", and\n(3) EPR Bell pairs, which give \"genuine\" entanglement. We explicitly show that\nentanglement entropies (1) and (2) above indeed appear for various multiple\n\"meson\" states in gauge theories with matter fields. Furthermore, we employ\ntransfer matrix formalism for gauge theory with fundamental matter field and\nanalyze its ground state using hopping parameter expansion (HPE), where the\nhopping parameter $K$ is roughly the inverse square of the mass for the matter.\nWe evaluate the entanglement entropy for the ground state and show that all\n(1), (2), (3) above appear in the HPE, though the Bell pair part (3) appears in\nhigher order than (1) and (2) do. With these results, we discuss how the ground\nstate entanglement entropy in the continuum limit can be understood from the\nlattice ground state obtained in the HPE.\n", "  Fermi arc surface states, a hallmark of topological Dirac semimetals, can\nhost carriers that exhibit unusual dynamics distinct from that of their parent\nbulk. Here we find that Fermi arc carriers in intrinsic Dirac semimetals\npossess a strong and anisotropic light matter interaction. This is\ncharacterized by a large Fermi arc optical conductivity when light is polarized\ntransverse to the Fermi arc; when light is polarized along the Fermi arc, Fermi\narc optical conductivity is significantly muted. The large surface spectral\nweight is locked to the wide separation between Dirac nodes and persists as a\nlarge Drude weight of Fermi arc carriers when the system is doped. As a result,\nlarge and anisotropic Fermi arc conductivity provides a novel means of\noptically interrogating the topological surfaces states of Dirac semimetals.\n", "  We quantify the accuracy of different non-self-consistent and self-consistent\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) treatments in Kohn-Sham and hybrid density-functional\ntheory by providing a band structure benchmark set for the valence and\nlow-lying conduction energy bands of 103 inorganic compounds, covering chemical\nelements up to Po. Reference energy band structures for the PBE density\nfunctional are obtained using the full-potential (linearized) augmented plane\nwave code Wien2k, employing its self-consistent treatment of SOC including\nDirac-like p$^{1/2}$ orbitals in the basis set. We use this benchmark set to\nbenchmark a computationally simpler, non-self-consistent all-electron treatment\nof SOC based on scalar-relativistic orbitals and numeric atom-centered orbital\nbasis functions. For elements up to Z$\\approx$50, both treatments agree\nvirtually exactly. For the heaviest elements considered (Tl, Pb, Bi, Po), the\nband structure changes due to SOC are captured with a relative deviation of 11%\nor less. For different density functionals (PBE vs. the hybrid HSE06), we show\nthat the effect of spin-orbit coupling is usually similar but can be dissimilar\nif the qualitative features of the predicted underlying scalar-relativistic\nband structures do not agree. All band structures considered in this work are\navailable online via the NOMAD Repository to aid in future benchmark studies\nand methods development.\n", "  It is well known that asteroids and comets fall into the Sun. Metal pollution\nof white dwarfs and transient spectroscopic signatures of young stars like\n$\\beta$-Pic provide growing evidence that extra solar planetesimals can attain\nextreme orbital eccentricities and fall onto their parent stars. We aim to\ndevelop a general, practically implementable, semi-analytical theory of secular\neccentricity excitation of small bodies in mean motion resonances with an\neccentric planet valid for arbitrary values of the eccentricities and including\nthe short-range force due to General Relativity. Our semi-analytic model for\nthe restricted planar three-body problem does not make use of any series\nexpansion and therefore is valid for any values of eccentricities and\nsemi-major axes ratios. The model is based on the application of the adiabatic\nprinciple, which is valid when the precession period of the longitude of\npericenter of the planetesimal is much longer than the libration period in the\nmean motion resonance. This holds down to vanishingly small eccentricities in\nresonances of order larger than 1. We provide a Mathematica notebook with the\nimplementation of the model allowing direct use to the interested reader. We\nconfirm that the 4:1 mean motion resonance with a moderately eccentric planet\nis the most powerful one to lift the eccentricity of planetesimals from nearly\ncircular orbits to star-grazing ones. However, if the planet is too eccentric,\nwe find that this resonances becomes unable to pump the planetesimal's\neccentricity to very high value. The inclusion of the General Relativity effect\nimposes a condition on the mass of the planet to drive the planetsimals into\nstar-grazing orbits. For a planetesimal at $\\sim$1 AU around a solar-mass star\n(or white dwarf), we find a threshold planetary mass of about 17 Earth masses.\nWe finally derive an analytical formula for this critical mass.\n", "  We study the influence of a high baryonic streaming velocity on the formation\nof direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) with the help of cosmological\nsimulations carried out using the moving mesh code {\\sc arepo}. We show that a\nstreaming velocity that is as large as three times the root-mean-squared value\nis effective at suppressing the formation of H$_{2}$-cooled minihaloes, while\nstill allowing larger atomic cooling haloes (ACHs) to form. We find that enough\nH$_{2}$ forms in the centre of these ACHs to effectively cool the gas,\ndemonstrating that a high streaming velocity by itself cannot produce the\nconditions required for DCBH formation. However, we argue that high streaming\nvelocity regions do provide an ideal environment for the formation of DCBHs in\nclose pairs of ACHs (the \"synchronised halo\" model). Due to the absence of star\nformation in minihaloes, the gas remains chemically pristine until the ACHs\nform. If two such haloes form with only a small separation in time and space,\nthen the one forming stars earlier can provide enough ultraviolet radiation to\nsuppress H$_{2}$ cooling in the other, allowing it to collapse to form a DCBH.\nBaryonic streaming may therefore play a crucial role in the formation of the\nseeds of the highest redshift quasars.\n", "  Model-independent constraints on hadronic form factors, in particular those\ndescribing exclusive semileptonic decays, can be derived from the knowledge of\nfield correlators calculated in perturbative QCD, using analyticity and\nunitarity. The location of poles corresponding to below-threshold resonances,\ni.e., stable states that cannot decay into a pair of hadrons from the crossed\nchannel of the form factor, must be known a priori, and their effect, accounted\nfor through the use of Blaschke factors, is to reduce the strength of the\nconstraints in the semileptonic region. By contrast, above-threshold resonances\nappear as poles on unphysical Riemann sheets, and their presence does not\naffect the original model-independent constraints. We discuss the possibility\nthat the above-threshold poles can provide indirect information on the form\nfactors on the first Riemann sheet, either through information from their\nresidues or by constraining the discontinuity function. The bounds on form\nfactors can be improved by imposing, in an exact way, the additional\ninformation in the extremal problem. The semileptonic $K\\to \\pi\\ell \\nu$ and\n$D\\to \\pi\\ell\\nu$ decays are considered as illustrations.\n", "  The large-scale matter distribution in the late-time Universe exhibits\ngravity-induced non-Gaussianity, and the bispectrum, three-point cumulant is\nexpected to contain significant cosmological information. In particular, the\nmeasurement of the bispectrum helps to tighten the constraints on dark energy\nand modified gravity through the redshift-space distortions (RSD). In this\npaper, extending the work by Taruya, Nishimichi & Saito (2010, Phys.Rev.D 82,\n063522), we present a perturbation theory (PT) based model of redshift-space\nmatter bispectrum that can keep the non-perturbative damping effect under\ncontrol. Characterizing this non-perturbative damping by a univariate function\nwith single free parameter, the PT model of the redshift-space bispectrum is\ntested against a large set of cosmological $N$-body simulations, finding that\nthe predicted monopole and quadrupole moments are in a good agreement with\nsimulations at the scales of baryon acoustic oscillations (well beyond the\nrange of agreement of standard PT). The validity of the univariate ansatz of\nthe damping effect is also examined, and with the PT calculation at\nnext-to-leading order, the fitted values of the free parameter is shown to\nconsistently match those obtained from the PT model of power spectrum by\nTaruya, Nishimichi & Saito (2010).\n", "  We report on WIMP search results in the XENON100 detector using a\nnon-relativistic effective field theory approach. The data from science run II\n(34 kg $\\times$ 224.6 live days) was re-analyzed, with an increased recoil\nenergy interval compared to previous analyses, ranging from $(6.6 -\n240)~\\mathrm{keV_\\mathrm{nr}}$. The data is found to be compatible with the\nbackground-only hypothesis. We present 90% confidence level exclusion limits on\nthe coupling constants of WIMP-nucleon effective operators using a binned\nprofile likelihood method. We also consider the case of inelastic WIMP\nscattering, where incident WIMPs may up-scatter to a higher mass state, and set\nexclusion limits on this model as well.\n", "  We study the ground-state properties of a double layer graphene system with\nthe Coulomb interlayer electron-electron interaction modeled within the random\nphase approximation. We first obtain an expression of the quantum capacitance\nof a two layer system. In addition, we calculate the many-body\nexchange-correlation energy and quantum capacitance of the hybrid double layer\ngraphene system at zero-temperature. We show an enhancement of the majority\ndensity layer thermodynamic density-of-states owing to an increasing interlayer\ninteraction between two layers near the Dirac point. The quantum capacitance\nnear the neutrality point behaves like square root of the total density,\n$\\alpha \\sqrt{n}$, where the coefficient $\\alpha$ decreases by increasing the\ncharge density imbalance between two layers. Furthermore, we show that the\nquantum capacitance changes linearly by the gate voltage. Our results can be\nverified by current experiments.\n", "  Context. Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) are essential tools to understand\nthe earliest epoch of the Milky Way, since they are among the oldest objects in\nthe Universe and can be used to trace its formation and evolution. Current\nstudies using high resolution spectroscopy for many stars in each of a large\nsample of GCs allow us to develop a detailed observational picture about their\nformation and their relation with the Galaxy. However, it is necessary to\ncomplete this picture by including GCs that belong to all major Galactic\ncomponents, including the Bulge. Aims. Our aim is to perform a detailed\nchemical analyses of the bulge GC NGC 6440 in order to determine if this object\nhas Multiple Populations (MPs) and investigate its relation with the Bulge of\nthe Milky Way and with the other Galactic GCs, especially those associated with\nthe Bulge, which are largely poorly studied. Methods. We determined the stellar\nparameters and the chemical abundances of light elements (Na, Al), iron-peak\nelements (Fe, Sc, Mn, Co, Ni), $\\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) and heavy\nelements (Ba, Eu) in seven red giant members of NGC 6440 using high resolution\nspectroscopy from FLAMES@UVES. Results. We found a mean iron content of\n[Fe/H]=-0.50$\\pm$0.03 dex in agreement with other studies. We found no internal\niron spread. On the other hand, Na and Al show a significant intrinsic spread,\nbut the cluster has no significant O-Na anticorrelation nor exhibits a Mg-Al\nanticorrelation. The $\\alpha$-elements show good agreement with the Bulge field\nstar trend, although they are at the high alpha end and are also higher than\nthose of other GCs of comparable metallicity. The heavy elements are dominated\nby the r-process, indicating a strong contribution by SNeII. The chemical\nanalysis suggests an origin similar to that of the Bulge field stars.\n", "  We introduce a model of $2\\pi$-flux loop semimetals which holds nodal loops\ndescribed by a winding number $\\nu=2$. By adding some extra terms, this model\ncan be transformed into a recently discovered Hopf-link semimetal, and the\nsymmetries distinguishing these two phases are studied. We also propose a\nsimpler physical implementation of $2\\pi$-flux loops and of the Hopf-link\nsemimetals which only involves nearest-neighbor hoppings, although in the\npresence of spin-orbit interaction. Finally, we investigate the Floquet\nproperties of the $2\\pi$-flux loop, and find that such a loop may be driven\ninto two separated $\\pi$-flux loops or four Weyl points by light with circular\npolarization in certain directions.\n", "  In the quantum Hall effect (QHE) regime, heat is carried by electrons in the\nedge states of Landau levels. Here, we study cooling of hot electrons\npropagating along the edge of graphene at the filling factor $\\nu=\\pm2$,\nmediated by acoustic phonons. We determine the temperature profile extended\nfrom a hot spot, where the Hall current is injected into graphene from a\nmetallic contact, taking into account specifics of boundary conditions for\nlattice displacements in graphene in a van der Waals heterostructure with an\ninsulating substrate. Our calculations, performed using generic boundary\nconditions for Dirac electrons, show that emission of phonons can explain a\nshort cooling length observed in graphene-based QHE devices by Nahm, Hwang and\nLee [PRL 110, 226801 (2013)].\n", "  The wear-driven structural evolution of nanocrystalline Cu was simulated with\nmolecular dynamics under constant normal loads, followed by a quantitative\nanalysis. While the microstructure far away from the sliding contact remains\nunchanged, grain growth accompanied by partial dislocations and twin formation\nwas observed near the contact surface, with more rapid coarsening promoted by\nhigher applied normal loads. The structural evolution continues with increasing\nnumber of sliding cycles and eventually saturates to a stable distinct layer of\ncoarsened grains, separated from the finer matrix by a steep gradient in grain\nsize. The coarsening process is balanced by the rate of material removal when\nthe normal load is high enough. The observed structural evolution leads to an\nincrease in hardness and decrease in friction coefficient, which also saturate\nafter a number of sliding cycles. This work provides important mechanistic\nunderstanding of nanocrystalline wear, while also introducing a methodology for\natomistic simulations of cyclic wear damage under constant applied normal\nloads.\n", "  Reduced motor control is one of the most frequent features associated with\naging and disease. Nonlinear and fractal analyses have proved to be useful in\ninvestigating human physiological alterations with age and disease. Similar\nfindings have not been established for any of the model organisms typically\nstudied by biologists, though. If the physiology of a simpler model organism\ndisplays the same characteristics, this fact would open a new research window\non the control mechanisms that organisms use to regulate physiological\nprocesses during aging and stress. Here, we use a recently introduced animal\ntracking technology to simultaneously follow tens of Caenorhabdits elegans for\nseveral hours and use tools from fractal physiology to quantitatively evaluate\nthe effects of aging and temperature stress on nematode motility. Similarly to\nhuman physiological signals, scaling analysis reveals long-range correlations\nin numerous motility variables, fractal properties in behavioral shifts, and\nfluctuation dynamics over a wide range of timescales. These properties change\nas a result of a superposition of age and stress-related adaptive mechanisms\nthat regulate motility.\n", "  The magnetorotational instability (MRI), also known as the Balbus -- Hawley\ninstability, is thought to have an important role on the initiation of\nturbulence and angular momentum transport in accretion discs. In this work, we\ninvestigate the effect of the magnetic field gradient in the azimuthal\ndirection on MRI. We solve the magnetohydrodynamic equations by including the\nazimuthal component of the field gradient. We find the dispersion relation and\ncalculate the growth rates of the instability numerically. The inclusion of the\nazimuthal magnetic field gradient produces a new unstable region on wavenumber\nspace. It also modifies the growth rate and the wavelength range of the\nunstable mode: the higher the magnitude of the field gradient, the greater the\ngrowth rate and the wider the unstable wavenumber range. Such a gradient in the\nmagnetic field may be important in T Tauri discs where the stellar magnetic\nfield has an axis which is misaligned with respect to the rotation axis of the\ndisc.\n", "  The transition disk around the T Tauri star T Cha possesses a large gap,\nmaking it a prime target for high-resolution imaging in the context of planet\nformation. We aim to find signs of disk evolutionary processes by studying the\ndisk geometry and the dust grain properties at its surface, and to search for\ncompanion candidates. We analyze a set of VLT/SPHERE data at near-infrared and\noptical wavelengths. We performed polarimetric imaging of T Cha with IRDIS (1.6\n$\\mu$m) and ZIMPOL (0.5-0.9 $\\mu$m), and obtained intensity images from IRDIS\ndual-band imaging with simultaneous spectro-imaging with IFS (0.9-1.3 $\\mu$m).\nThe disk around T Cha is detected in all observing modes and its outer disk is\nresolved in scattered light with unprecedented angular resolution and\nsignal-to-noise. The images reveal a highly inclined disk with a noticeable\neast-west brightness asymmetry. The significant amount of non-azimuthal\npolarization signal in the $U_{\\phi}$ images, with a $U_{\\phi}$/$Q_{\\phi}$\npeak-to-peak value of 14%, is in accordance with theoretical studies on\nmultiple scattering. Our optimal axisymmetric radiative transfer model\nconsiders two coplanar inner and outer disks, separated by a gap of 0.28\"\n(~30au) in size. We derive a disk inclination of ~69 deg and PA of ~114 deg. In\norder to self-consistently reproduce the intensity and polarimetric images, the\ndust grains, responsible for the scattered light, need to be dominated by sizes\nof around ten microns. A point source is detected at an angular distance of\n3.5\" from the central star. It is, however, found not to be co-moving. We\nconfirm that the dominant source of emission is forward scattered light from\nthe near edge of the outer disk. Our point source analysis rules out the\npresence of a companion heavier than ~8.5 $M_{\\mathrm{jup}}$ between 0.1\" and\n0.3\". The detection limit decreases to ~2 $M_{\\mathrm{jup}}$ for 0.3\" to 4.0\".\n", "  We propose an efficient and accurate measure for ranking spreaders and\nidentifying the influential ones in spreading processes in networks. While the\nedges determine the connections among the nodes, their specific role in\nspreading should be considered explicitly. An edge connecting nodes i and j may\ndiffer in its importance for spreading from i to j and from j to i. The key\nissue is whether node j, after infected by i through the edge, would reach out\nto other nodes that i itself could not reach directly. It becomes necessary to\ninvoke two unequal weights wij and wji characterizing the importance of an edge\naccording to the neighborhoods of nodes i and j. The total asymmetric\ndirectional weights originating from a node leads to a novel measure si which\nquantifies the impact of the node in spreading processes. A s-shell\ndecomposition scheme further assigns a s-shell index or weighted coreness to\nthe nodes. The effectiveness and accuracy of rankings based on si and the\nweighted coreness are demonstrated by applying them to nine real-world\nnetworks. Results show that they generally outperform rankings based on the\nnodes' degree and k-shell index, while maintaining a low computational\ncomplexity. Our work represents a crucial step towards understanding and\ncontrolling the spread of diseases, rumors, information, trends, and\ninnovations in networks.\n", "  The interplay of Ising spin-orbit coupling and non-trivial band topology in\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) produces anomalous transport and\noptical properties that are very different from a regular 2D electron gas. The\nspin-momentum locking of optically excited carriers near a valley point can\ngive rise to an anomalous spin-valley Hall current under the application of an\nin-plane electric field. TMDs also exhibit strong electron-nuclear hyperfine\ninteractions, but their effect on spin-valley-locked currents remains unknown.\nHere, we show that hyperfine interactions can create a feedback mechanism in\nwhich spin-valley currents generate significant dynamical nuclear polarization\nwhich in turn Zeeman shifts excitonic transitions out of resonance with an\noptical driving field, saturating the production of spin-valley polarization.\nWe propose an experimental signature of dynamic nuclear polarization which can\nbe detected via measurements of the anomalous Hall current. Our results help to\nelucidate the interplay of valley polarization and nuclear spin dynamics in\nTMDs.\n", "  It is known that a quasinormal mode (QNM) of a remnant black hole dominates a\nringdown gravitational wave (GW) in a binary black hole (BBH) merger. To study\nproperties of the QNMs, it is important to determine the time when the QNMs\nappear in a GW signal as well as to calculate its frequency and amplitude. In\nthis paper, we propose a new method of estimating the starting time of the QNM\nand calculating the QNM frequency and amplitude of BBH GWs. We apply it to\nsimulated merger waveforms by numerical relativity and the observed data of\nGW150914. The results show that the obtained QNM frequencies and time\nevolutions of amplitudes are consistent with the theoretical values within 1%\naccuracy for pure waveforms free from detector noise. In addition, it is\nrevealed that there is a correlation between the starting time of the QNM and\nthe spin of the remnant black hole. In the analysis of GW150914, we show that\nthe parameters of the remnant black hole estimated through our method are\nconsistent with those given by LIGO and a reasonable starting time of the QNM\nis determined.\n", "  We show that on the average, homogeneous and isotropic scalar field and on\nthe average homogeneous and isotropic ensembles of classical and quantum\ngravitational waves generate the de Sitter expansion of the empty (with no\nmatter) space-time. At the start and by the end of its cosmological evolution\nthe Universe is empty. The contemporary Universe is about 70% empty, so the\neffect of cosmological acceleration should be very noticeable. One can assume\nthat it manifests itself as dark energy. At the start of the cosmological\nevolution, before the first matter was born, the Universe is also empty. The\ncosmological acceleration of such an empty space-time can manifests itself as\ninflation. To get the de Sitter accelerated expansion of the empty space-time\nunder influence of scalar fields and classical and quantum gravitational waves,\none needs to make a mandatory Wick rotation, i.e. one needs to make a\ntransition to the Euclidean space of imaginary time. One can assume that the\nvery existence of inflation and dark energy could be considered as a possible\nobservable evidence of the fact that time by its nature could be a complex\nvalue which manifests itself precisely at the start and by the end of the\nevolution of the Universe, i.e. in those periods when the Universe is empty (or\nnearly empty).\n", "  We present a study of transverse single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) in\n$p^\\uparrow p\\to J/\\psi\\,X$ and $p^\\uparrow p\\to D X$ within the framework of\nthe generalized parton model (GPM), which includes both spin and transverse\nmomentum effects, and show how they can provide useful information on the still\nalmost unknown gluon Sivers function. Moreover, by adopting a modified version\nof this model, named color gauge invariant (CGI) GPM, we analyze the impact of\nthe initial- and final-state interactions on our predictions. As a consequence,\nwe find that these two processes are sensitive to different gluon Sivers\nfunctions, which can be expressed as linear combinations of two distinct,\nuniversal gluon distributions. We therefore define proper observables which\ncould allow for a separate extraction of these two independent Sivers\nfunctions. At the same time, we show how it would be possible to discriminate\nbetween the GPM and the CGI-GPM approaches by comparing the corresponding\nestimates of SSAs with present and future experimental results at RHIC.\n", "  We present an analysis of [OI]63, [OIII]88, [NII]122 and [CII]158\nfar-infrared (FIR) fine-structure line observations obtained with\nHerschel/PACS, for ~240 local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great\nObservatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). We find pronounced declines\n-deficits- of line-to-FIR-continuum emission for [NII]122, [OI]63 and [CII]158\nas a function of FIR color and infrared luminosity surface density,\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm IR}$. The median electron density of the ionized gas in LIRGs,\nbased on the [NII]122/[NII]205 ratio, is $n_{\\rm e}$ = 41 cm$^{-3}$. We find\nthat the dispersion in the [CII]158 deficit of LIRGs is attributed to a varying\nfractional contribution of photo-dissociation-regions (PDRs) to the observed\n[CII]158 emission, f([CII]PDR) = [CII]PDR/[CII], which increases from ~60% to\n~95% in the warmest LIRGs. The [OI]63/[CII]158PDR ratio is tightly correlated\nwith the PDR gas kinetic temperature in sources where [OI]63 is not\noptically-thick or self-absorbed. For each galaxy, we derive the average PDR\nhydrogen density, $n_{\\rm H}$, and intensity of the interstellar radiation\nfield, in units of G$_0$, and find G$_0$/$n_{\\rm H}$ ratios ~0.1-50 cm$^3$,\nwith ULIRGs populating the upper end of the distribution. There is a relation\nbetween G$_0$/$n_{\\rm H}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm IR}$, showing a critical break at\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm IR}^{\\star}$ ~ 5 x 10$^{10}$ Lsun/kpc$^2$. Below $\\Sigma_{\\rm\nIR}^{\\star}$, G$_0$/$n_{\\rm H}$ remains constant, ~0.32 cm$^3$, and variations\nin $\\Sigma_{\\rm IR}$ are driven by the number density of star-forming regions\nwithin a galaxy, with no change in their PDR properties. Above $\\Sigma_{\\rm\nIR}^{\\star}$, G$_0$/$n_{\\rm H}$ increases rapidly with $\\Sigma_{\\rm IR}$,\nsignaling a departure from the typical PDR conditions found in normal\nstar-forming galaxies towards more intense/harder radiation fields and compact\ngeometries typical of starbursting sources.\n", "  Context. Stellar spectral variability on timescales of a day and longer,\narising from magnetic surface features such as dark spots and bright faculae,\nis an important noise source when characterising extra-solar planets. Current\n1D models of faculae do not capture the geometric properties and fail to\nreproduce observed solar facular contrasts. Magnetoconvection simulations\nprovide facular contrasts accounting for geometry. Aims. We calculate facular\ncontrast spectra from magnetoconvection models of the solar photosphere with a\nview to improve (a) future parameter determinations for planets with early G\ntype host stars and (b) reconstructions of solar spectral variability. Methods.\nRegions of a solar twin (G2, log g=4.44) atmosphere with a range of initial\naverage vertical magnetic fields (100 to 500~G) were simulated using a 3D\nradiation-magnetohydrodynamics code, MURaM, and synthetic intensity spectra\nwere calculated from the ultraviolet (149.5~nm) to the far infrared (160000~nm)\nwith the ATLAS9 radiative transfer code. Nine viewing angles were investigated\nto account for facular positions across most of the stellar disc. Results.\nContrasts of the radiation from simulation boxes with different levels of\nmagnetic flux relative to an atmosphere with no magnetic field are a\ncomplicated function of position, wavelength and magnetic field strength that\nis not reproduced by 1D facular models. Generally, contrasts increase towards\nthe limb, but at UV wavelengths a saturation and decrease are observed close to\nthe limb. Contrasts also increase strongly from the visible to the UV; there is\na rich spectral dependence, with marked peaks in molecular bands and strong\nspectral lines. At disc centre, a complex relationship with magnetic field was\nfound and areas of strong magnetic field can appear either dark or bright,\ndepending on wavelength...\n", "  We study the spin evolution of close-in planets in compact multi-planetary\nsystems. The rotation period of these planets is often assumed to be\nsynchronous with the orbital period due to tidal dissipation. Here we show that\nplanet-planet perturbations can drive the spin of these planets into\nnon-synchronous or even chaotic states. In particular, we show that the transit\ntiming variation (TTV) is a very good probe to study the spin dynamics, since\nboth are dominated by the perturbations of the mean longitude of the planet. We\napply our model to KOI-227b and Kepler-88b, which are both observed undergoing\nstrong TTVs. We also perform numerical simulations of the spin evolution of\nthese two planets. We show that for KOI-227b non-synchronous rotation is\npossible, while for Kepler-88b the rotation can be chaotic.\n", "  With the introduction of a spectral representation, the Schwinger-Dyson\nequation (SDE) for the fermion propagator is formulated in Minkowski space in\nQED. After imposing the on-shell renormalization conditions, analytic solutions\nfor the fermion propagator spectral functions are obtained in four dimensions\nwith a renormalizable version of the Gauge Technique anzatz for the\nfermion-photon vertex in the quenched approximation in the Landau gauge.\nDespite the limitations of this model, having an explicit solution provides a\nguiding example of the fermion propagator with the correct analytic structure.\nThe Pad\\'{e} approximation for the spectral functions is also investigated.\n", "  We demonstrate optomechanical interference in a multimode system, in which an\noptical mode couples to two mechanical modes. A phase-dependent\nexcitation-coupling approach is developed, which enables the observation of\nconstructive and destructive optomechanical interferences. The destructive\ninterference prevents the coupling of the mechanical system to the optical\nmode, suppressing optically-induced mechanical damping. These studies establish\noptomechanical interference as an essential tool for controlling the\ninteractions between light and mechanical oscillators.\n", "  The young, rapidly rotating Bp star HR5624 (HD133880) shows an unusually\nstrong non-sinusoidal variability of its longitudinal magnetic field. This\nbehaviour was previously interpreted as the signature of an exceptionally\nstrong, quadrupole-dominated surface magnetic field geometry. We studied the\nmagnetic field structure and chemical abundance distributions of HR5624 with\nthe aim to verify the unusual quadrupolar nature of its magnetic field and to\ninvestigate correlations between the field topology and chemical spots. We\nanalysed high resolution, time series Stokes parameter spectra of HR5624 with\nthe help of a magnetic Doppler imaging inversion code based on detailed\npolarised radiative transfer modelling of the line profiles. Our magnetic\nDoppler inversions reveal that the field structure of HR5624 is considerably\nsimpler and the field strength is much lower than proposed by previous studies.\nWe find a maximum local field strength of 12 kG and a mean field strength of 4\nkG. Our model implies that overall large-scale field topology of HR5624 is\nbetter described as a distorted, asymmetric dipole. The chemical abundance maps\nof Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Nd obtained in our study are characterised by\nlarge-scale, high-contrast abundance patterns. These structures correlate\nweakly with the magnetic field geometry and show no distinct element\nconcentrations in the horizontal field regions predicted by theoretical atomic\ndiffusion calculations. We conclude that the surface magnetic field topology of\nHR5624 is not as unusual as previously proposed. Considering these results\ntogether with other recent magnetic mapping analyses of early-type stars\nsuggests that predominantly quadrupolar magnetic field topologies, invoked to\nbe present in a significant number of stars, probably do not exist in real\nstars.\n", "  The ability to perform first-principles calculations of electronic and\nvibrational properties of two-dimensional heterostructures in a field-effect\nsetup is crucial for the understanding and design of next-generation devices.\nWe present here an implementation of density functional perturbation theories\ntailored for the case of two-dimensional heterostructures in field-effect\nconfiguration. Key ingredients are the inclusion of a truncated Coulomb\ninteraction in the direction perpendicular to the slab and the possibility of\nsimulating charging of the slab via field-effects. With this implementation we\ncan access total energies, force and stress tensors, the vibrational properties\nand the electron-phonon interaction. We demonstrate the relevance of the method\nby studying flexural acoustic phonons and their coupling to electrons in\ngraphene doped by field-effect. In particular, we show that while the\nelectron-phonon coupling to those phonons can be significant in neutral\ngraphene, it is strongly screened and negligible in doped graphene, in\ndisagreement with other recent first-principles reports. Consequently, the\ngate-induced coupling with flexural acoustic modes would not be detectable in\ntransport measurements on doped graphene.\n", "  Sunspot atmospheres are highly inhomogeneous hosting both quasi-stable and\ntransient features, such as `umbral micro-jets' and dark fibril-like events. We\nseek to understand the morphological properties and formation mechanisms of\nsmall-scale umbral brightenings (SSUBs; analogous to umbral micro-jets) and to\nunderstand whether links between these events and short dynamic fibrils, umbral\nflashes, and umbral dots can be established. An SST filtergram time-series\nsampling the Ca II H line and a CRISP full-Stokes 15-point Ca II 8542 A line\nscan dataset were used. The average lifetime and lengths of 54 SSUBs identified\nin the sunspot umbra are found to be 44.2 seconds (sigma=20 seconds) and 0.56\"\n(sigma=0.14\"). The spatial positioning and morphological evolution of these\nevents was investigated finding no evidence of parabolic or ballistic profiles\nnor a preference for co-spatial formation with umbral flashes. The presence of\nStokes V profile reversals provided evidence that these events could form\nthrough the development of shocks in the chromosphere. The application of the\nweak-field approximation indicated that changes in the line-of-sight magnetic\nfield were not responsible for the modifications to the line profile and\nsuggested that thermodynamic effects are the actual cause of the increased\nemission. Finally, a sub-set of SSUBs were observed to form at the foot-points\nof short dynamic fibrils. Overall, we found no correlation between the spatial\nlocations where these events were observed and the occurrence of umbral dots\nand umbral flashes. SSUBs, however, have lifetimes and spectral signatures\ncomparable to umbral flashes and are located at the footpoints of short dynamic\nfibrils, during or at the end of the red-shifted stage. It is possible,\ntherefore, that these features form due to the shocking of fibrilar material in\nthe lower atmosphere upon its return under gravity.\n", "  Motivated by the claimed possibility of a large contribution of the first\nradial excitation of the $D^{(\\ast )}$ to the $B$ semileptonic decay into\ncharmed mesons, also invoked to solve the \"$1/2$ vs. $3/2$ semileptonic\npuzzle\", we discuss the transitions to heavy-light radial excitations by a\nheavy $b \\to c$ quark current. We first consider a HQET sum rule, which\nprovides a bound on the slopes of Isgur-Wise functions which we then calculate\nin the Bakamjian-Thomas framework which both guaranties covariance in the heavy\nquark limit and satisfies a set of HQET sum rules. We observe a remarkable\nproperty that for a large variety of wave functions the transition to the first\nradial excitation is very small while the transition matrix element to the\nsecond radial excitation is large and dominant in saturating the HQET sum rule.\nThis is opposite to what is found in non-relativistic models, where the\ntransition to the first radial excitation dominates the sum rule. The relative\nmagnitude of the transition to the second excitation appears to be weakly\ndependent on the dynamical scale (radius of the bound states), and the same\nholds true for the slope of the elastic transition. These features could be\ntested in the heavy mass limit of lattice QCD. This pattern is shown to be\nrelated to the general structure of the Bakamjian-Thomas model, it is\nindependent of the spin structure of the approach and derives mainly from the\nLorentz transformation of the spatial wave function, a feature often\ndisregarded in quark models.\n", "  A new family of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous solutions of Brans-Dicke\ngravity is generated using the Fonarev solution of general relativity as a seed\nand a map from the Einstein to the Jordan conformal frame. The Brans-Dicke\nscalar field self-interacts with a power-law or inverse power-law potential in\nthe Jordan frame. This 4-parameter family of geometries, which is dynamical and\nasymptotically Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, contains as special cases\ntwo previously known classes of solutions and solves also the field equations\nof $f(R)=R^n$ gravity\n", "  In the local Universe, the growth of massive galaxy clusters mainly operates\nthrough the continuous accretion of group-scale systems. The infalling group in\nAbell 2142 is the poster child of such an accreting group, and as such, it is\nan ideal target to study the astrophysical processes induced by structure\nformation. We present the results of a deep (200 ks) observation of this\nstructure with Chandra, which highlights the complexity of this system in\nexquisite detail. In the core of the group, the spatial resolution of Chandra\nreveals the presence of a leading edge and a complex AGN-induced activity. The\nmorphology of the stripped gas tail appears straight in the innermost 250 kpc,\nsuggesting that magnetic draping efficiently shields the gas from its\nsurroundings. However, beyond $\\sim300$ kpc from the core, the tail flares and\nthe morphology becomes strongly irregular, which could be explained by a\nbreaking of the drape, e.g. because of turbulent motions. The power spectrum of\nsurface-brightness fluctuations is relatively flat ($P_{2D}\\propto k^{-2.3}$),\nwhich indicates that thermal conduction is strongly inhibited even beyond the\nregion where magnetic draping is effective. The amplitude of density\nfluctuations in the tail is consistent with a mild level of turbulence with a\nMach number $M_{3D}\\sim0.1-0.25$. Overall, our results show that the processes\nleading to the thermalization and mixing of the infalling gas are slow and\nrelatively inefficient.\n", "  We propose that resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is an effective\nprobe of the fractionalized excitations in three-dimensional (3D) Kitaev spin\nliquids. While the non-spin-conserving RIXS responses are dominated by the\ngauge-flux excitations and reproduce the inelastic-neutron-scattering response,\nthe spin-conserving (SC) RIXS response picks up the Majorana-fermion\nexcitations and detects whether they are gapless at Weyl points, nodal lines,\nor Fermi surfaces. As a signature of symmetry fractionalization, the SC RIXS\nresponse is suppressed around the $\\Gamma$ point. On a technical level, we\ncalculate the exact SC RIXS responses of the Kitaev models on the\nhyperhoneycomb, stripyhoneycomb, hyperhexagon, and hyperoctagon lattices,\narguing that our main results also apply to generic 3D Kitaev spin liquids\nbeyond these exactly solvable models.\n", "  Recently, several ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources were shown to host a\nneutron star (NS) accretor. We perform a suite of evolutionary calculations\nwhich show that, in fact, NSs are the dominant type of ULX accretor. Although\nblack holes (BH) dominate early epochs after the star-formation burst, NSs\noutweigh them after a few 100 Myr and may appear as late as a few Gyr after the\nend of the star formation episode. If star formation is a prolonged and\ncontinuous event (i.e., not a relatively short burst), NS accretors dominate\nULX population at any time in solar metallicity environment, whereas BH\naccretors dominate when the metallicity is sub-solar. Our results show a very\nclear (and testable) relation between the companion/donor evolutionary stage\nand the age of the system. A typical NS ULX consists of a $\\sim1.3\\,M_\\odot$ NS\nand $\\sim1.0\\,M_\\odot$ Red Giant. A typical BH ULX consist of a\n$\\sim8\\,M_\\odot$ BH and $\\sim6\\,M_\\odot$ main-sequence star. Additionally, we\nfind that the very luminous ULXs ($L_X\\gtrsim10^{41}$ erg/s) are predominantly\nBH systems ($\\sim9\\,M_\\odot$) with Hertzsprung gap donors ($\\sim2\\,M_\\odot$).\nNevertheless, some NS ULX systems may also reach extremely high X-ray\nluminosities ($\\gtrsim10^{41}$ erg/s).\n", "  ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks confirm earlier indications that\nthere is a clear difference between the dust and gas radial extents. The origin\nof this difference is still debated, with both radial drift of the dust and\noptical depth effects suggested in the literature. In this work, the feedback\nof realistic dust particle distributions onto the gas chemistry and molecular\nemissivity is investigated, with a particular focus on CO isotopologues. The\nradial dust grain size distribution is determined using dust evolution models\nthat include growth, fragmentation and radial drift. A new version of the code\nDALI is used to take into account how dust surface area and density influence\nthe disk thermal structure, molecular abundances and excitation. The difference\nof dust and gas radial sizes is largely due to differences in the optical depth\nof CO lines and millimeter continuum, without the need to invoke radial drift.\nThe effect of radial drift is primarily visible in the sharp outer edge of the\ncontinuum intensity profile. The gas outer radius probed by $^{12}$CO emission\ncan easily differ by a factor of $\\sim 2$ between the models for a turbulent\n$\\alpha$ ranging between typical values. Grain growth and settling concur in\nthermally decoupling the gas and dust components, due to the low collision rate\nwith large grains. As a result, the gas can be much colder than the dust at\nintermediate heights, reducing the CO excitation and emission, especially for\nlow turbulence values. Also, due to disk mid-plane shadowing, a second CO\nthermal desorption (rather than photodesorption) front can occur in the warmer\nouter mid-plane disk. The models are compared to ALMA observations of HD 163296\nas a test case. In order to reproduce the observed CO snowline of the system, a\nbinding energy for CO typical of ice mixtures needs to be used rather than the\nlower pure CO value.\n", "  We study a \"classical\" bouncing scenario in beyond Horndeski theory. We give\nan example of spatially flat bouncing solution that is non-singular and stable\nthroughout the whole evolution. The model is arranged in such a way that the\nscalar field driving the cosmological evolution initially behaves like\nfull-fledged beyond Horndeski, whereas at late times it becomes a massless\nscalar field minimally coupled to gravity.\n", "  $\\phi$-meson--nucleus bound state energies and absorption widths are\ncalculated for seven selected nuclei by solving the Klein-Gordon equation with\ncomplex optical potentials. Essential input for the calculations, namely the\nmedium-modified $K$ and $\\overline{K}$ meson masses, as well as the density\ndistributions in nuclei, are obtained from the quark-meson coupling model. The\nattractive potential for the $\\phi$-meson in the nuclear medium originates from\nthe in-medium enhanced $K\\overline{K}$ loop in the $\\phi$-meson self-energy.\nThe results suggest that the $\\phi$-meson should form bound states with all the\nnuclei considered. However, the identification of the signal for these\npredicted bound states will need careful investigation because of their sizable\nabsorption widths.\n", "  Motivated by the precise measurement of the $1S$ level shift of kaonic\nhydrogen, we perform accurate three-body calculations for the spectrum of\nkaonic deuterium using a realistic antikaon-nucleon ($KN$) interaction. In\norder to describe both short- and long-range behavior of the kaonic atomic\nstates, we solve the three-body Schr\\\"odinger equation with a superposition of\na large number of correlated Gaussian basis functions covering distances up to\nseveral hundreds of fm. Transition energies between $1S$, $2P$ and $2S$ states\nare determined with high precision. The complex energy shift of the $1S$ level\nof kaonic deuterium is found to be $670-i508$ eV. The sensitivity of this level\nshift with respect to the isospin $I=1$ component of the $KN$ interaction is\nexamined. It is pointed out that an experimental determination of the kaonic\ndeuterium level shift within an uncertainty of 25\\% will provide a constraint\nfor the $I=1$ component of the $KN$ interaction significantly stronger than\nthat from kaonic hydrogen.\n", "  Context. Mass transfer due to Roche lobe overflow leads to the formation of\nan accretion disk around a weakly magnetized white dwarf (WD) in cataclysmic\nvariables. At the inner edge of the disk, the gas comes upon the surface of the\nWD and has to get rid of its excess kinetic energy in order to settle down on\nthe more slowly rotating outer stellar layers. This region is known as the\nboundary layer (BL). Aims. In this work we investigate the vertical structure\nof the BL, which is still poorly understood. We shall provide details of the\nbasic structure of the two-dimensional (2D) BL and how it depends on parameters\nsuch as stellar mass and rotation rate, as well as the mass-accretion rate. We\nfurther investigate the destination of the disk material and compare our\nresults with previous one-dimensional (1D) simulations. Methods. We solve the\n2D equations of radiation hydrodynamics in a spherical geometry using a\nparallel grid-based code that employs a Riemann solver. The radiation energy is\nconsidered in the two-temperature approach with a radiative flux given by the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation. Results. The BL around a non-rotating WD\nis characterized by a steep drop in angular velocity over a width of only 1% of\nthe stellar radius, a heavy depletion of mass, and a high temperature (500 000\nK) as a consequence of the strong shear. Variations in Om_star, M_star, and\nM_dot influence the extent of the changes of the variables in the BL but not\nthe general structure. Depending on Om_star, the disk material travels up to\nthe poles or is halted at a certain latitude. The extent of mixing with the\nstellar material also depends on Om_star. We find that the 1D approximation\nmatches the 2D data well, apart from an underestimated temperature.\n", "  The long-sought quantum spin liquid is a quantum-entangled magnetic state\nleading to the fractionalization of spin degrees of freedom. Quasiparticles\nemergent from the fractionalization affect not only the ground state properties\nbut also thermodynamic behavior in a peculiar manner. We here investigate how\nthe spin dynamics evolves from the high-temperature paramagnet to the quantum\nspin liquid ground state, for the Kitaev spin model describing the\nfractionalization into itinerant matter fermions and localized $Z_2$ gauge\nfluxes. Beyond the previous study [J. Yoshitake, J. Nasu, and Y. Motome, Phys.\nRev. Lett. $\\textbf{117}$, 157203 (2016)], in which the mean-field nature of\nthe cluster dynamical mean-field theory prevented us from studying\nlow-temperature properties, we develop a numerical technique by applying the\ncontinuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) method to statistical samples\ngenerated by the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method in a Majorana fermion\nrepresentation. This QMC+CTQMC method is fully unbiased and enables us to\ninvestigate the low-temperature spin dynamics dominated by thermally excited\ngauge fluxes, including the unconventional phase transition caused by gauge\nflux loops in three dimensions, which was unreachable by the previous methods.\nWe apply this technique to the Kitaev model in both two and three dimensions.\nOur results clearly distinguish two cases: while the dynamics changes smoothly\nthrough the crossover in the two-dimensional honeycomb case, it exhibits\nsingular behaviors at the phase transition in the three-dimensional\nhyperhoneycomb case. We show that the low-temperature spin dynamics is a\nsensitive probe for thermally fluctuating gauge fluxes that behave very\ndifferently between two and three dimensions.\n", "  Fickian diffusion is often used to model moisture transport through barrier\ncoatings, where the goal is to protect an underlying substrate from the onset\nof corrosion caused by buildup of water or other aggressive species. Such\ncoatings are often exposed to cyclic moisture, either in laboratory testing or\nin service due to natural environmental fluctuations. In this paper, we use\nlattice Boltzmann numerical techniques to investigate the effects of reservoir\ncycling on moisture propagation and concentration at the substrate where\ncorrosion onset occurs. We examine both the simple case of constant\ndiffusivity, representing idealized Fickian diffusion, and diffusivity that\ndepends on concentration via either a step or linear function, representing\npolymer network swelling. The use of a coating subject to swelling is shown to\nlead to highly variable equilibrium behavior. We show that the nature of the\nfunctional diffusivity has large effects on water concentration at the\nsubstrate, and has implications for material design and analysis to avoid\ncorrosion.\n", "  We propose theoretically an experimentally realizable method to demonstrate\nthe Lyapunov instability and to extract the value of the largest Lyapunov\nexponent for a chaotic many-particle interacting system. The proposal focuses\nspecifically on a lattice of coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in the classical\nregime describable by the discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We suggest to use\nimperfect time-reversal of system's dynamics known as Loschmidt echo, which can\nbe realized experimentally by reversing the sign of the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem. The routine involves tracking and then subtracting the noise of\nvirtually any observable quantity before and after the time-reversal. We\nsupport the theoretical analysis by direct numerical simulations demonstrating\nthat the largest Lyapunov exponent can indeed be extracted from the Loschmidt\necho routine. We also discuss possible values of experimental parameters\nrequired for implementing this proposal.\n", "  Motivated by systems that can be seen as composed of two frustrated\nsublattices combined into a less frustrated total lattice, we study the\ndouble-exchange model with nearest-neighbor (NN) and next--nearest-neighbor\n(NNN) couplings on the honeycomb lattice. When adding NN hopping and its\nresulting double exchange to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Heisenberg coupling,\nthe resulting phase diagram is quite different from that of purely\nHeisenberg-like magnetic models and strongly depends on electron filling. For\nhalf filling, patterns of AFM dimers dominate, where the effective electronic\nbands remain graphene-like with Dirac cones in all phases, from the FM to the\n$120^\\circ$ limit. When the density of states at the Fermi level is sizable, we\nfind non-coplanar incommensurate states as well as a small-vortex phase.\nFinally, a non-coplanar commensurate pattern realizes a Chern insulator at\nquarter filling. In the case of both NN and NNN hopping, the noncoplanar spin\npattern inducing Chern insulators in triangular lattices is found to be quite\nstable under coupling into a honeycomb system. The resulting total phases are\ntopologically nontrivial and either a Chern insulator with $C=2$ or a magnetic\ntopological crystalline insulator protected by a combination or\nmirror-reflection and time-reversal symmetries arise.\n", "  The amplitude of large-scale matter fluctuations inferred from the observed\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) cluster mass function and from weak gravitational\nlensing studies, when taken at face value, is in tension with measurements of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO). In\nthis work, we revisit whether this possible discrepancy can be attributed to\nnew interactions in the dark matter sector. Focusing on a cosmological model\nwhere dark matter interacts with a dark radiation species until the epoch of\nmatter-radiation equality, we find that measurements of the Lyman-alpha flux\npower spectrum from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey provides no support to the\nhypothesis that new dark matter interactions can resolve the possible tension\nbetween CMB and large-scale structure (LSS). Indeed, while the addition of dark\nmatter-dark radiation interactions leads to an improvement of\n$2\\Delta\\ln\\mathcal{L}=12$ with respect to the standard $\\Lambda$ cold dark\nmatter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model when only CMB, BAO, and LSS data are considered,\nthe inclusion of Lyman-alpha data reduces the improvement of the fit to\n$2\\Delta\\ln\\mathcal{L}=6$ relative to $\\Lambda$CDM. We thus conclude that the\nstatistical evidence for new dark matter interactions (largely driven by the\nPlanck SZ dataset) is marginal at best, and likely caused by systematics in the\ndata. We also perform a Fisher forecast analysis for the reach of a future\ndataset composed of a CMB-S4 experiment combined with the Large Synoptic Survey\nTelescope galaxy survey. We find that the constraint on the effective number of\nfluid-like dark radiation species, $\\Delta N_{\\rm fluid}$, will be improved by\nan order of magnitude compared to current bounds.\n", "  We have identified several tens of extremely metal-poor star candidates from\nSDSS and LAMOST, which we follow-up with the 4.2m WHT telescope to confirm\ntheir metallicity.We follow a robust two-step methodology. We first analyze the\nSDSS and LAMOST spectra. A first set of stellar parameters is derived from\nthese spectra with the FERRE code, taking advantage of the continuum shape to\ndetermine the atmospheric parameters, in particular, the effective temperature.\nSecond, we select interesting targets for follow-up observations, some of them\nwith very low-quality SDSS or LAMOST data. We then obtain and analyze\nhigher-quality medium-resolution spectra obtained with ISIS on the WHT\ntelescope to arrive at a second, more reliable, set of atmospheric parameters.\nThis allows us to derive, with accuracy, the metallicity, and confirm the\nextremely metal-poor nature in most cases. In this second step we also employ\nFERRE, but we take a running mean to normalize both the observed and the\nsynthetic spectra, and therefore the final parameters do not rely on having an\naccurate flux calibration or continuum placement. In order to verify our\nresults we have analyzed with the same tools, and following the same procedure,\nsix well-known metal-poor stars, five of them at [Fe/H]<-4, showing that our\nmethodology is able to get accurate metallicity determinations down to\n[Fe/H]<-5.0. The results for these six reference stars give us confidence on\nthe metallicity scale for the rest of the sample. In addition, we present 12\nnew extremely metal-poor candidates: two stars at [Fe/H]=-4, six more in the\nrange -4<[Fe/H]<-3.5, and four more at -3.5<[Fe/H]<-3.0.\n", "  The BRITE mission is a pioneering space project aimed at the long-term\nphotometric monitoring of the brightest stars in the sky by means of a\nconstellation of nano-satellites. Its main advantage is high photometric\naccuracy and time coverage inaccessible from the ground. The main aim of this\npaper is the presentation of procedures used to obtain high-precision\nphotometry from a series of images acquired by the BRITE satellites in two\nmodes of observing, stare and chopping. We developed two pipelines\ncorresponding to the two modes of observing. The assessment of the performance\nof both pipelines is presented. It is based on two comparisons, which use data\nfrom six runs of the UniBRITE satellite: (i) comparison of photometry obtained\nby both pipelines on the same data, which were partly affected by charge\ntransfer inefficiency (CTI), (ii) comparison of real scatter with theoretical\nexpectations. It is shown that for CTI-affected observations, the chopping\npipeline provides much better photometry than the other pipeline. For other\nobservations, the results are comparable only for data obtained shortly after\nswitching to chopping mode. Starting from about 2.5 years in orbit, the\nchopping mode of observing provides significantly better photometry for\nUniBRITE data than the stare mode. This paper shows that high-precision space\nphotometry with low-cost nano-satellites is achievable. The proposed meth- ods,\nused to obtain photometry from images affected by high impulsive noise, can be\napplied to data from other space missions or even to data acquired from\nground-based observations.\n", "  Higher derivative extensions of Einstein gravity are important within the\nstring theory approach to gravity and as alternative and effective theories of\ngravity. H. L\\\"u, A. Perkins, C. Pope, K. Stelle [Phys.Rev.Lett. 114 (2015),\n171601] found a numerical solution describing a spherically symmetric\nnon-Schwarzschild asymptotically flat black hole in the Einstein gravity with\nadded higher derivative terms. Using the general and quickly convergent\nparametrization in terms of the continued fractions, we represent this\nnumerical solution in the analytical form, which is accurate not only near the\nevent horizon or far from black hole, but in the whole space. Thereby, the\nobtained analytical form of the metric allows one to study easily all the\nfurther properties of the black hole, such as thermodynamics, Hawking\nradiation, particle motion, accretion, perturbations, stability, quasinormal\nspectrum, etc. Thus, the found analytical approximate representation can serve\nin the same way as an exact solution.\n", "  We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of star-forming objects\nlocated in the vicinities of 1 360 bubble structures throughout the Galactic\nPlane and their local environments. The compilation of ~70 000 star-forming\nsources, found in the proximity of the ionized (Hii) regions and detected in\nboth Hi-GAL and GLIMPSE surveys, provided a broad overview of the different\nevolutionary stages of star-formation in bubbles, from prestellar objects to\nmore evolved young stellar objects (YSOs). Surface density maps of star-forming\nobjects clearly reveal an evolutionary trend where more evolved star-forming\nobjects are found spatially located near the center, while younger star-forming\nobjects are found at the edge of the bubbles. We derived dynamic ages for a\nsubsample of 182 Hii regions for which kinematic distances and radio continuum\nflux measurements were available. We detect ~80% more star-forming sources per\nunit area in the direction of bubbles than in the surrounding fields. We\nestimate ~10% clump formation efficiency (CFE) of Hi-GAL clumps in bubbles,\ntwice the CFE in fields not affected by feedback. We find higher CFE of\nprotostellar clumps in younger bubbles, whose density of the bubble shells is\nhigher. We argue that the formation rate from prestellar to protostellar phase\nis probably higher during the early stages of the bubble expansion. Evaluation\nof the fragmentation time inside the shell of bubbles advocates the\npreexistence of clumps in the medium before the bubble, as supported by\nnumerical simulations. Approximately 23% of the Hi-GAL clumps are found located\nin the direction of a bubble, with 15% for prestellar clumps and 41% for\nprotostellar clumps. We argue that the high fraction of protostellar clumps may\nbe due to the acceleration of the star-formation process cause by the feedback\nof the (Hii) bubbles.\n", "  The seismic data provided by the satellites CoRoT and Kepler enabled us to\nprobe the internal rotation of thousands of evolved low-mass stars.\nSubsequently, several studies showed that current stellar evolution codes are\nunable to reproduce the low core rotation rates observed in these stars. These\nresults indicate that an additional angular momentum transport process is\nnecessary to counteract the spin up due to the core contraction during the\npost-main sequence evolution. For several candidates, the transport induced by\ninternal gravity waves (IGW) could play a non-negligible role. In this work, we\ninvestigate the effect of IGW generated by penetrative convection on the\ninternal rotation of low-mass stars from the subgiant branch to the beginning\nof the red giant branch. We show that IGW can efficiently counteract the\ncontraction-driven spin up of the core of subgiant stars if the amplitude of\nthe radial-differential rotation (between the center of the star and the top of\nthe radiative zone) is higher than a threshold value. This threshold depends on\nthe evolutionary stage and is comparable to the differential rotation rates\ninferred for a sample of subgiant stars observed by the satellite Kepler. Such\nan agreement can therefore be interpreted as the consequence of a regulation\nmechanism driven by IGW. This result is obtained under the assumption of a\nsmooth rotation profile and holds true even if a wide range of values is\nconsidered for the parameters of the generation model. In contrast, on the red\ngiant branch, we find that IGW remain insufficient, on their own, to explain\nthe observations. We conclude that plume-induced IGW are able to efficiently\nextract angular momentum from the core of subgiant stars and accordingly have\nto be taken into account. On the red giant branch, another transport mechanism\nmust likely be invoked.\n", "  Three formaldehyde lines were observed (H$_2$CO 3$_{03}$--2$_{02}$, H$_2$CO\n3$_{22}$--2$_{21}$, and H$_2$CO 3$_{21}$--2$_{20}$) in the protoplanetary disk\naround the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 with ALMA at 0.5 arcsecond (60 AU) spatial\nresolution. H$_2$CO 3$_{03}$--2$_{02}$ was readily detected via imaging, while\nthe weaker H$_2$CO 3$_{22}$--2$_{21}$ and H$_2$CO 3$_{21}$--2$_{20}$ lines\nrequired matched filter analysis to detect. H$_2$CO is present throughout most\nof the gaseous disk, extending out to 550 AU. An apparent 50 AU inner radius of\nthe H$_2$CO emission is likely caused by an optically thick dust continuum. The\nH$_2$CO radial intensity profile shows a peak at 100 AU and a secondary bump at\naround 300 AU, suggesting increased production in the outer disk. Different\nparameterizations of the H$_2$CO abundance were compared to the observed\nvisibilities with $\\chi^2$ minimization, using either a characteristic\ntemperature, a characteristic radius or a radial power law index to describe\nthe H$_2$CO chemistry. Similar models were applied to ALMA Science Verification\ndata of C$^{18}$O. In all modeling scenarios, fits to the H$_2$CO data show an\nincreased abundance in the outer disk. The overall best-fit H$_2$CO model shows\na factor of two enhancement beyond a radius of 270$\\pm$20 AU, with an inner\nabundance of $2\\!-\\!5 \\times 10^{-12}$. The H$_2$CO emitting region has a lower\nlimit on the kinetic temperature of $T > 20$ K. The C$^{18}$O modeling suggests\nan order of magnitude depletion in the outer disk and an abundance of $4\\!-\\!12\n\\times 10^{-8}$ in the inner disk. The increase in H$_2$CO outer disk emission\ncould be a result of hydrogenation of CO ices on dust grains that are then\nsublimated via thermal desorption or UV photodesorption, or more efficient\ngas-phase production beyond about 300 AU if CO is photodisocciated in this\nregion.\n", "  We demonstrate optical spin polarization of the neutrally-charged\nsilicon-vacancy defect in diamond ($\\mathrm{SiV^{0}}$), an $S=1$ defect which\nemits with a zero-phonon line at 946 nm. The spin polarization is found to be\nmost efficient under resonant excitation, but non-zero at below-resonant\nenergies. We measure an ensemble spin coherence time $T_2>100~\\mathrm{\\mu s}$\nat low-temperature, and a spin relaxation limit of $T_1>25~\\mathrm{s}$. Optical\nspin state initialization around 946 nm allows independent initialization of\n$\\mathrm{SiV^{0}}$ and $\\mathrm{NV^{-}}$ within the same optically-addressed\nvolume, and $\\mathrm{SiV^{0}}$ emits within the telecoms downconversion band to\n1550 nm: when combined with its high Debye-Waller factor, our initial results\nsuggest that $\\mathrm{SiV^{0}}$ is a promising candidate for a long-range\nquantum communication technology.\n", "  Extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars are old objects formed in the first Gyr of\nthe Universe. They are rare and, to select them, the most successful strategy\nhas been to build on large and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. The\ncombination of narrow- and broad band photometry provides a powerful and\ncheaper alternative to select metal-poor stars. The on-going Pristine Survey is\nadopting this strategy, conducting photometry with the CFHT MegaCam wide field\nimager and a narrow-band filter centred at 395.2 nm on the CaII-H and -K lines.\nIn this paper we present the results of the spectroscopic follow-up conducted\non a sample of 26 stars at the bright end of the magnitude range of the Survey\n(g<=15), using FEROS at the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope. From our chemical\ninvestigation on the sample, we conclude that this magnitude range is too\nbright to use the SDSS gri bands, which are typically saturated. Instead the\nPristine photometry can be usefully combined with the APASS gri photometry to\nprovide reliable metallicity estimates.\n", "  Einstein's vierbein formulation of general relativity based on the notion of\ndistant parallelism (teleparallelism) naturally introduces a covariant surface\nterm in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We investigate the action\nprinciple in teleparallelism with the existence of spacetime boundaries and\nfind that the covariant surface term exactly eliminates all the unwanted\nsurface terms reside in the metric formulation of general relativity, as the\nrole of a Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) term. The identity of such a covariant GHY\nterm is further confirmed by the recovery of the correct black hole entropy\nfrom the free energy due to the spacetime boundary. These results indicate that\nthe vierbein formulation of gravity generally exhibits a well-posed action\nprinciple and readily admits the path integral approach to quantization.\n", "  Here we present the first large scale investigation of electronic properties\nand correlated magnetism in Ce-based compounds accompanied by a systematic\nstudy of the electronic structure and 4f-hybridization function of a large body\nof Ce compounds. We systematically study the electronic structure and\n4f-hybridization function of a large body of Ce compounds with the goal of\nelucidating the nature of the 4f states and their interrelation with the\nmeasured Kondo energy in these compounds. The hybridization function has been\nanalyzed for more than 350 data sets of cubic Ce compounds using electronic\nstructure theory that relies on a full-potential approach. We demonstrate that\nthe strength of the hybridization function, evaluated in this way, allows us to\ndraw precise conclusions about the degree of localization of the 4f states in\nthese compounds. The theoretical results are entirely consistent with all\nexperimental information, relevant to the degree of 4f localization for all\ninvestigated materials. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the electronic\nstructure and the hybridization function allows us to make precise statements\nabout Kondo correlations in these systems. The calculated hybridization\nfunctions, together with the corresponding density of states, reproduce the\nexpected exponential behavior of the observed Kondo temperatures and prove a\nconsistent trend in real materials. This trend allows us to predict which\nsystems may be correctly identified as Kondo systems. A strong anti-correlation\nbetween the size of the hybridization function and the volume of the systems\nhas been observed. Our approach demonstrates the predictive power of materials\ninformatics when a large number of materials is used to establish significant\ntrends which can be used to design new materials with desired properties.\n", "  The results of a search for vector-like top quarks using events with exactly\none lepton, at least four jets, and large missing transverse momentum are\nreported. The search is optimised for pair production of vector-like top quarks\nin the $Z(\\rightarrow \\! \\! \\nu \\nu) \\, t + X$ decay channel. LHC pp collision\ndata at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS\ndetector in 2015 and 2016 are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 36.1 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. No significant excess over the Standard Model\nexpectation is seen and upper limits on the production cross-section of a\nvector-like $T$ quark pair as a function of the $T$ quark mass are derived. The\nobserved (expected) 95% CL lower limits on the $T$ mass are 870 GeV (890 GeV)\nfor the weak-isospin singlet model, 1.05 TeV (1.06 TeV) for the weak-isospin\ndoublet model and 1.16 TeV (1.17 TeV) for the pure $Zt$ decay mode. Limits are\nalso set on the mass as a function of the decay branching ratios, excluding\nlarge parts of the parameter space for masses below 1 TeV.\n", "  There has recently been interest in multi-Solar mass Primordial Black Holes\n(PBHs) as a dark matter (DM) candidate. There are various microlensing,\ndynamical and accretion constraints on the abundance of PBHs in this mass\nrange. Taken at face value these constraints exclude multi-Solar mass PBHs\nmaking up all of the DM for both delta-function and extended mass functions.\nHowever the stellar microlensing event rate depends on the density and velocity\ndistribution of the compact objects along the line of sight to the Magellanic\nClouds. We study the dependence of the constraints on the local dark matter\ndensity and circular speed and also consider models where the velocity\ndistribution varies with radius. We find that the largest mass constrained by\nstellar microlensing can vary by an order of magnitude. In particular the\nconstraints are significantly weakened if the velocity dispersion of the\ncompact objects is reduced. The change is not sufficiently large to remove the\ntension between the stellar microlensing and dynamical constraints. However\nthis demonstrates that it is crucial to take into account astrophysical\nuncertainties when calculating and comparing constraints. We also confirm the\nrecent finding that the tension between the constraints is in fact increased\nfor realistic, finite width mass functions.\n", "  We present a new map of interstellar reddening, covering the 39\\% of the sky\nwith low {\\rm HI} column densities ($N_{\\rm HI} < 4\\times10^{20}\\,\\rm cm^{-2}$\nor $E(B-V)\\approx 45\\rm\\, mmag$) at $16\\overset{'}{.}1$ resolution, based on\nall-sky observations of Galactic HI emission by the HI4PI Survey. In this low\ncolumn density regime, we derive a characteristic value of $N_{\\rm HI}/E(B-V) =\n8.8\\times10^{21}\\, \\rm\\, cm^{2}\\, mag^{-1}$ for gas with $|v_{\\rm LSR}| <\n90\\,\\rm km\\, s^{-1}$ and find no significant reddening associated with gas at\nhigher velocities. We compare our HI-based reddening map with the Schlegel,\nFinkbeiner, and Davis (1998, SFD) reddening map and find them consistent to\nwithin a scatter of $\\simeq 5\\,\\rm mmag$. Further, the differences between our\nmap and the SFD map are in excellent agreement with the low resolution\n($4\\overset{\\circ}{.}5$) corrections to the SFD map derived by Peek and Graves\n(2010) based on observed reddening toward passive galaxies. We therefore argue\nthat our HI-based map provides the most accurate interstellar reddening\nestimates in the low column density regime to date. Our reddening map is made\npublicly available (http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/AFJNWJ).\n", "  Uniaxial pressure applied in the b crystallographic direction perpendicular\nto spontaneous magnetization in heavy fermion ferromagnet URhGe strongly\nstimulates superconductivity in this compound. The phenomenological approach\nallows point out two mechanisms of superconducting temperature raising. They\noriginates from stimulation by the uniaxial stress both intraband and interband\namplitudes of triplet Cooper pairing. The phenomenon of reentrant\nsuperconductivity under magnetic field along b-axis is also strongly sensitive\nto the uniaxial stress in the same direction. The uniaxial stress accelerates\nsuppression the Curie temperature by the transversal magnetic field. The\nemergence of the first order transition to the paramagnetic state occurs at\nmuch lower field than in the absence of uniaxial stress.\n", "  This paper applies He's new amplitude-frequency relationship recently\nestablished by Ji-Huan He (Int J Appl Comput Math 3 1557-1560, 2017) to study\nperiodic solutions of strongly nonlinear systems with odd nonlinearities. Some\nexamples are given to illustrate the effectiveness, ease and convenience of the\nmethod. In general, the results are valid for small as well as large\noscillation amplitude. The method can be easily extended to other nonlinear\nsystems with odd nonlinearities and can therefore be found widely applicable in\nengineering and other science. The method used in this paper can be applied\ndirectly to highly nonlinear problems without any discretization, linearization\nor additional requirements.\n", "  Using a minimum model consisting of a magnetic quantum dot and an electron\nlead, we investigate spin pumping by its precessing magnetization. Focusing on\nthe \"adiabaticity\", which is quantified using a comparison between the\nfrequency of precession and the relaxation rate of the relevant system, we\ninvestigate the role of nonadiabaticity in spin pumping by obtaining the\ndependence of the spin current generated on the frequency of precession using\nfull counting statistics. This evaluation shows that the steady-state\npopulation of the quantum dot remains unchanged by the precession owing to the\nrotational symmetry about the axis of precession. This implies that in the\nadiabatic limit the spin current is absent and that spin pumping is entirely a\nnonadiabatic effect. We also find that the nonadiabatic spin current depends\nlinearly on the frequency in the low-frequency regime and exhibits an\noscillation in the high-frequency regime. The oscillation points to an\nenhancement of spin pumping by tuning the frequency of precession.\n", "  We present timing analysis of the accretion powered pulsar SXP 1062, based on\nthe observations of \\textit{Swift}, \\textit{XMM-Newton} and \\textit{Chandra}\nsatellites covering a time span of about 2 years. We obtain a phase coherent\ntiming solution which shows that SXP 1062 has been steadily spinning down with\na rate $-\\,4.29(7) \\times 10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$ leading to a surface magnetic\nfield estimate of about $1.5 \\times 10^{14}$ G. We also resolve the binary\norbital motion of the system from X-ray data which confirms an orbital period\nof 656(2) days. On MJD 56834.5, a sudden change in pulse frequency occurs with\n$\\Delta\\nu = 1.28(5) \\times 10^{-6} $ Hz, which indicates a glitch event. The\nfractional size of the glitch is $\\Delta \\nu / \\nu \\! \\sim \\! 1.37(6) \\times\n10^{-3}$ and SXP 1062 continues to spin-down with a steady rate after the\nglitch. A short X-ray outburst 25 days prior to the glitch does not alter the\nspin-down of the source; therefore the glitch should be associated with the\ninternal structure of the neutron star. While glitch events are common for\nisolated pulsars, the glitch of SXP 1062 is the first confirmation of the\nobservability of this type of events among accretion powered pulsars.\nFurthermore, the value of the fractional change of pulse frequency ensures that\nwe discover the largest glitch reported up to now.\n", "  Using the 1.56m telescope at the Shanghai Observatory (ShAO), China, we\nmonitored two sources, BL Lac object S5 0716+714 and Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar\n(FSRQ) 3C 273. For S5 0716+714, we report 4969 sets of CCD (Charge-coupled\nDevice) photometrical optical observations (1369 for V band, 1861 for R band\nand 1739 for I band) in the monitoring time from Dec.4, 2000 to Apr.5, 2014.\nFor 3C 273, we report 460 observations (138 for V band, 146 for R band and 176\nfor I band) in the monitoring time from Mar. 28, 2006 to Apr. 9, 2014. The\nobservations provide us with a large amount of data to analyze the short-term\nand long-term optical variabilities. Based on the variable timescales, we can\nestimate the central black hole mass and the Doppler factor. An abundance of\nmulti-band observations can help us to analyze the relations between the\nbrightness and spectrum. We use Gaussian fitting to analyze the intra-day light\ncurves and obtain the intra-day variability (IDV) timescales. We use the\ndiscrete correlation function (DCF) method and Jurkevich method to analyze the\nquasi-periodic variability. Based on the VRI observations, we use the linear\nfitting to analyze the relations between brightness and spectrum. The two\nsources both show IDV properties for S5 0716+714. The timescales are in the\nrange from 17.3 minutes to 4.82 hours; for 3C273, the timescale is 35.6\nminutes. Based on the periodic analysis methods, we find the periods P(V) =\n24.24 days, P(R)=24.12 days, P(I)=24.82 days for S5 0716+714, and P = 12.99,\n21.76 yr for 3C273. The two sources displayed the \"bluer-when-brighter\"\nspectral evolution properties. S5 0716+714 and 3C 273 are frequently studied\nobjects. The violent optical variability and IDV may come from the jet.\nGaussian fitting can be used to analyze IDVs. The relations between brightness\n(flux density) and spectrum are strongly influenced by the frequency.\n", "  Exploration of the resonances $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z(4430)$ are performed by\nassuming that they are ground-state and first radial excitation of the same\ntetraquark with $J^{P}=1^{+}$. The mass and current coupling of the $\nZ_c(3900)$ and $Z(4430)$ states are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule\nmethod by taking into account vacuum condensates up to eight dimensions. We\ninvestigate the vertices $Z_cM_hM_l$ and $ZM_hM_l$, with $M_h$ and $M_l $ being\nthe heavy and light mesons, and evaluate the strong couplings $ g_{Z_cM_hM_l}$\nand $g_{ZM_hM_l}$ using QCD sum rule on the light cone. The extracted couplings\nallow us to find the partial width of the decays $ Z_c(3900) \\to J/\\psi \\pi;\n\\,\\psi^{\\prime} \\pi;\\, \\eta_c \\rho$ and $Z(4430) \\to \\psi^{\\prime} \\pi;\\,\nJ/\\psi \\pi;\\, \\eta_c^{\\prime}\\rho;\\, \\eta_c\\rho$, which may help in\ncomprehensive investigation of these resonances. We compare width of the decays\nof $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z(4430)$ resonances with available experimental data as\nwell as existing theoretical predictions.\n", "  The first direct detections of gravitational waves from merging binary black\nholes open a unique window into the binary black hole formation environment.\nOne promising environmental signature is the angular distribution of the black\nhole spins; systems formed through dynamical interactions among already-compact\nobjects are expected to have isotropic spin orientations whereas binaries\nformed from pairs of stars born together are more likely to have spins\npreferentially aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. We consider\nexisting gravitational wave measurements of the binary effective spin, the\nbest-measured combination of spin parameters, in the four likely binary black\nhole detections GW150914, LVT151012, GW151226, and GW170104. If binary black\nhole spin magnitudes extend to high values we show that the data exhibit a\n$2.4\\sigma$ ($0.015$ odds ratio) preference for an isotropic angular\ndistribution over an aligned one. By considering the effect of 10 additional\ndetections, we show that such an augmented data set would enable in most cases\na preference stronger than $5\\sigma$ ($2.9 \\times 10^{-7}$ odds ratio). The\nexisting preference for either an isotropic spin distribution or low spin\nmagnitudes for the observed systems will be confirmed (or overturned)\nconfidently in the near future.\n", "  Whether BDs form as stars through gravitational collapse (\"star-like\") or BDs\nand some very low-mass stars constitute a separate population which form\nalongside stars comparable to the population of planets, e.g. through\ncircumstellar disk (\"peripheral\") fragmentation, is one of the key questions of\nthe star-formation problem. For young stars in Taurus-Auriga the binary\nfraction is large with little dependence on primary mass above ~0.2Msun, while\nfor BDs it is <10%. We investigate a case in which BDs in Taurus formed\ndominantly through peripheral fragmentation. The decline of the binary\nfrequency in the transition region between star-like and peripheral formation\nis modelled. A dynamical population synthesis model is employed in which\nstellar binary formation is universal. Peripheral objects form separately in\ncircumstellar disks with a distinctive initial mass function (IMF), own orbital\nparameter distributions for binaries and a low binary fraction. A small amount\nof dynamical processing of the stellar component is accounted for as\nappropriate for the low-density Taurus-Auriga embedded clusters. The binary\nfraction declines strongly between the mass-limits for star-like and peripheral\nformation. The location of characteristic features and the steepness depend on\nthese mass-limits. Such a trend might be unique to low density regions hosting\ndynamically unprocessed binary populations. The existence of a strong decline\nin the binary fraction -- primary mass diagram will become verifiable in future\nsurveys on BD and VLMS binarity in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region. It is\na test of the (non-)continuity of star formation along the mass-scale, the\nseparateness of the stellar and BD populations and the dominant formation\nchannel for BDs and BD binaries in regions of low stellar density hosting\ndynamically unprocessed populations.\n", "  Within the renormalization group framework we study the stability of\nsuperfluid density wave states, known as Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov\n(FFLO) phases, with respect to thermal order-parameter fluctuations in two and\nthree-dimensional ($d\\in \\{2,3\\}$) systems. We analyze the\nrenormalization-group flow of the relevant ordering wave-vector $\\vec{Q_0}$.\nThe calculation indicates an instability of the FFLO-type states towards either\na uniform superfluid or the normal state in $d\\in\\{2,3\\}$ and $T>0$. In $d=2$\nthis is signaled by $\\vec{Q_0}$ being renormalized towards zero, corresponding\nto the flow being attracted either to the usual Kosterlitz-Thouless fixed-point\nor to the normal phase. We supplement a solution of the RG flow equations by a\nsimple scaling argument, supporting the generality of the result. The tendency\nto reduce the magnitude of $\\vec{Q_0}$ by thermal fluctuations persists in\n$d=3$, where the very presence of long-range order is immune to thermal\nfluctuations, but the effect of attracting $\\vec{Q_0}$ towards zero by the flow\nremains observed at $T>0$.\n", "  A first-order-like resistivity hysteresis is induced by a subtle structural\ntransition under hydrostatic pressure in the topological nodal-line\nsuperconductor PbTaSe$_2$. This structure transition is quickly suppressed to\nzero at pressure $\\sim$0.25 GPa. As a result, superconductivity shows a marked\nsuppression, accompanied with fundamental changes in the magnetoresistance and\nHall resistivity, suggesting a Lifshitz transition around $\\sim$0.25 GPa. The\nfirst principles calculations show that the spin-orbit interactions partially\ngap out the Dirac nodal line around $K$ point in the Brillouin zone upon\napplying a small pressure, whilst the Dirac states around $H$ point are\ncompletely destroyed. The calculations further reveal a second structural phase\ntransition under a pressure as high as $\\sim$30 GPa, through which a transition\nfrom a topologically nontrivial phase to a trivial phase is uncovered, with a\nsuperconducting dome emerging under this high-pressure phase.\n", "  HD 3167 is a bright (V = 8.9), nearby K0 star observed by the NASA K2 mission\n(EPIC 220383386), hosting two small, short-period transiting planets. Here we\npresent the results of a multi-site, multi-instrument radial velocity campaign\nto characterize the HD 3167 system. The masses of the transiting planets are\n5.02+/-0.38 MEarth for HD 3167 b, a hot super-Earth with a likely rocky\ncomposition (rho_b = 5.60+2.15-1.43 g/cm^3), and 9.80+1.30-1.24 MEarth for HD\n3167 c, a warm sub-Neptune with a likely substantial volatile complement (rho_c\n= 1.97+0.94-0.59 g/cm^3). We explore the possibility of atmospheric composition\nanalysis and determine that planet c is amenable to transmission spectroscopy\nmeasurements, and planet b is a potential thermal emission target. We detect a\nthird, non-transiting planet, HD 3167 d, with a period of 8.509+/-0.045 d\n(between planets b and c) and a minimum mass of 6.90+/-0.71 MEarth. We are able\nto constrain the mutual inclination of planet d with planets b and c: we rule\nout mutual inclinations below 1.3 degrees as we do not observe transits of\nplanet d. From 1.3-40 degrees, there are viewing geometries invoking special\nnodal configurations which result in planet d not transiting some fraction of\nthe time. From 40-60 degrees, Kozai-Lidov oscillations increase the system's\ninstability, but it can remain stable for up to 100Myr. Above 60 degrees, the\nsystem is unstable. HD 3167 promises to be a fruitful system for further study\nand a preview of the many exciting systems expected from the upcoming NASA TESS\nmission.\n", "  We study the observation of a thin dust shell, radially freely falling to a\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole, by an observer who is also freely and radially\nfalling into this black hole. Considered and resolved are several common\nparadoxes and fallacies peculiar for such problems. The results of this\nanalytical study are written as a numerical code that allows for calculating\nall related effects of this model. The numerical result have been presented in\na few synthesized videos, making a colorful, quantitative and detailed\ndescription of the occurring astrophysical phenomena, both above and below the\nhorizon.\n", "  Stellar dynamos are affected by boundary conditions imposed by stellar\ncoronae. Under some approximations it is possible to find analytical solutions.\nInterior dynamo models often consider a current-free coronae without taking\ninto account the constraints imposed by the presence of currents in the corona.\nWe aim to analytically evaluate the effect of coronal currents and of an outer\nboundary condition on the efficiency of an $\\alpha^2$ dynamo. We intend to\nestimate the change in geometry and dinamo excitation numbers with respect to\nthe current-free case. We analytically solve the turbulent dynamo induction\nequation for a homogeneous, non-mirror symmetric turbulence, in a spherical\ndomain surrounded by a linear force-free corona with magnetic field B\nsatisfying curl B = \\beta B. The main result is that the dynamo number is a\ndecreasing function of \\beta. Moreover, if the current is parallel to the field\n(\\beta > 0) the dynamo number is smaller than in the force-free case. On the\ncontrary (\\beta < 0) the dynamo number is greater than the in force-free case.\nWe conclude that the presence of currents in the corona needs to be taken into\naccount because it affects the condition for excitation of a dynamo.\n", "  HD3167 is a bright (V=8.9 mag) K0V star observed by the NASA's K2 space\nmission during its Campaign 8. It has been recently found to host two small\ntransiting planets, namely, HD3167b, an ultra short period (0.96 d)\nsuper-Earth, and HD3167c, a mini-Neptune on a relatively long-period orbit\n(29.85 d). Here we present an intensive radial velocity follow-up of HD3167\nperformed with the FIES@NOT, HARPS@ESO-3.6m, and HARPS-N@TNG spectrographs. We\nrevise the system parameters and determine radii, masses, and densities of the\ntwo transiting planets by combining the K2 photometry with our spectroscopic\ndata. With a mass of 5.69+/-0.44 MEarth, radius of 1.574+/-0.054 REarth, and\nmean density of 8.00(+1.0)(-0.98) g/cm^3, HD3167b joins the small group of\nultra-short period planets known to have a rocky terrestrial composition.\nHD3167c has a mass of 8.33 (+1.79)(-1.85) MEarth and a radius of\n2.740(+0.106)(-0.100) REarth, yielding a mean density of 2.21(+0.56)(-0.53)\ng/cm^3, indicative of a planet with a composition comprising a solid core\nsurrounded by a thick atmospheric envelope. The rather large pressure scale\nheight (about 350 km) and the brightness of the host star make HD3167c an ideal\ntarget for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy across a\nbroad range of wavelengths. We found evidence of additional signals in the\nradial velocity measurements but the currently available data set does not\nallow us to draw any firm conclusion on the origin of the observed variation.\n", "  Random sequential adsorption (RSA) is a standard method of modeling\nadsorption of large molecules at the liquid-solid interface. Several studies\nhave recently conjectured that in the RSA of rectangular needles, or $k$-mers,\non a square lattice the percolation is impossible if the needles are\nsufficiently long ($k$ of order of several thousand). We refute these claims\nand present a strict proof that in any jammed configuration of nonoverlapping,\nfixed-length, horizontal or vertical needles on a square lattice, all clusters\nare percolating clusters.\n", "  We study the role of hydrodynamic interactions in the collective behaviour of\ncollections of microscopic active particles suspended in a fluid. We introduce\na novel calculational framework that allows us to separate the different\ncontributions to their collective dynamics from hydrodynamic interactions on\ndifferent length scales. Hence we are able to systematically show that\nlubrication forces when the particles are very close to each other play as\nimportant a role as long-range hydrodynamic interactions in determining their\nmany-body behaviour. We find that motility-induced phase separation is\nsuppressed by near-field interactions, leading to open gel-like clusters rather\nthan dense clusters. Interestingly, we find a globally polar ordered phase\nappears for neutral swimmers with no force dipole that is enhanced by near\nfield lubrication forces in which the collision process rather than long-range\ninteraction dominates the alignment mechanism.\n", "  We study the contributions of colorless vectorlike fermions to the triple\ngauge couplings $W^+ W^- \\gamma$ and $W^+ W^- Z^0$. We consider models in which\ntheir coupling to the Standard Model Higgs boson is allowed or forbidden by\nquantum numbers. We assess the sensitivity of the future accelerators FCC-ee,\nILC and CLIC to the parameters of these models, assuming they will be able to\nconstrain the anomalous triple gauge couplings with a precision $\\delta\n\\kappa_V \\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, $V=\\gamma,Z^0$. We show that the\ncombination of measurements at different center-of-mass energies helps to\nimprove the sensitivity to the contribution of vectorlike fermions, in\nparticular when they couple to the Higgs. In fact, the measurements at the\nFCC-ee and, especially, the ILC and the CLIC, may turn the triple gauge\ncouplings into a new set of precision parameters able to constrain the models\nbetter than the oblique parameters or the $H \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ decay, even\nassuming the considerable improvement of the latter measurements achievable at\nthe new machines.\n", "  We explore the shock acceleration model for giant radio relics, in which\nrelativistic electrons are accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA)\nby merger-driven shocks in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. In addition to\nDSA, turbulent acceleration by compressive MHD mode downstream of the shock is\nincluded as well as energy losses of postshock electrons by Coulomb scattering,\nsynchrotron emission, and inverse Compton scattering off the cosmic background\nradiation. Considering that only a small fraction of merging clusters host\nradio relics, we favor the reacceleration scenario in which radio relics are\ngenerated preferentially when shocks encounter the regions containing\nlow-energy ($\\gamma_{\\rm e} \\lesssim 300$) cosmic ray electrons (CRe). We\nperform time-dependent DSA simulations of spherically expanding shocks with\nphysical parameters relevant for the Sausage radio relic, and calculate the\nradio synchrotron emission from the accelerated CRe. We find that significant\nlevel of postshock turbulent acceleration is required in order to reproduce\nbroad profiles of the observed radio flux densities of the Sausage relic.\nMoreover, the spectral curvature in the observed integrated radio spectrum can\nbe explained, if the putative shock should have swept up and exited out of the\npreshock region of fossil CRe about 10~Myr ago.\n", "  The two-photon transition $5S-5P-5D$ in rubidium vapor is investigated by\ndetecting the fluorescence from the $6P_{3/2}$ state when the atomic system is\nexcited by the combined action of a cw diode laser and a train of ultrashort\npulses. The cw-laser plays a role as a velocity-selective filter and allows for\na spectroscopy over a large spectral range including the $5D_{3/2}$ and\n$5D_{5/2}$ states. For a counterpropagating beam configuration, the response of\neach atomic velocity group is well characterized within the Doppler profile,\nand the excited hyperfine levels are clearly resolved. The contribution of the\noptical pumping to the direct two-photon process is also revealed. The results\nare well described in a frequency domain picture by considering the interaction\nof each velocity group with the cw laser and the modes of the frequency comb.\n", "  We propose a scenario where a companion that is about to exit a common\nenvelope evolution (CEE) with a giant star accretes mass from the remaining\nenvelope outside its deep orbit and launches jets that facilitate the removal\nof the remaining envelope. The jets that the accretion disk launches collide\nwith the envelope and form hot bubbles that energize the envelope. Due to\ngravitational interaction with the envelope, that might reside in a\ncircumbinary disk, the companion migrates further in, but the inner boundary of\nthe circumbinary disk continues to feed the accretion disk. While near the\nequatorial plane mass leaves the system at a very low velocity, along the polar\ndirections velocities are very high. When the primary is an asymptotic giant\nbranch star, this type of flow forms a bipolar nebula with very narrow waists.\nWe compare this envelope removal process with four others last-phase common\nenvelope removal processes. We also note that the accreted gas from the\nenvelope outside the orbit in the last-phase of the CEE might carry with it\nangular momentum that is antialigned to the orbital angular momentum. We\ndiscuss the implications to the possibly antialigned spins of the merging black\nhole event GW170104.\n", "  Deciphering the assembly history of the Milky Way is a formidable task, which\nbecomes possible only if one can produce high-resolution\nchrono-chemo-kinematical maps of the Galaxy. Data from large-scale astrometric\nand spectroscopic surveys will soon provide us with a well-defined view of the\ncurrent chemo-kinematical structure of the Milky Way, but will only enable a\nblurred view on the temporal sequence that led to the present-day Galaxy. As\ndemonstrated by the (ongoing) exploitation of data from the pioneering\nphotometric missions CoRoT, Kepler, and K2, asteroseismology provides the way\nforward: solar-like oscillating giants are excellent evolutionary clocks thanks\nto the availability of seismic constraints on their mass and to the tight\nage-initial-mass relation they adhere to. In this paper we identify five key\noutstanding questions relating to the formation and evolution of the Milky Way\nthat will need precise and accurate ages for large samples of stars to be\naddressed, and we identify the requirements in terms of number of targets and\nthe precision on the stellar properties that are needed to tackle such\nquestions. By quantifying the asteroseismic yields expected from PLATO for\nred-giant stars, we demonstrate that these requirements are within the\ncapabilities of the current instrument design, provided that observations are\nsufficiently long to identify the evolutionary state and allow robust and\nprecise determination of acoustic-mode frequencies. This will allow us to\nharvest data of sufficient quality to reach a 10% precision in age. This is a\nfundamental pre-requisite to then reach the more ambitious goal of a similar\nlevel of accuracy, which will only be possible if we have to hand a careful\nappraisal of systematic uncertainties on age deriving from our limited\nunderstanding of stellar physics, a goal which conveniently falls within the\nmain aims of PLATO's core science.\n", "  We consider the holographic complexity conjectures for de-Sitter invariant\nstates in a quantum field theory on de Sitter space, dual to asymptotically\nanti-de Sitter geometries with de Sitter boundaries. The bulk holographic duals\ninclude solutions with or without a horizon. If we compute the complexity from\nthe spatial volume, we find results consistent with general expectations, but\nthe conjectured bound on the growth rate is not saturated. If we compute\ncomplexity from the action of the Wheeler-de Witt patch, we find qualitative\ndifferences from the volume calculation, with states of smaller energy having\nlarger complexity than those of larger energy, even though the latter have bulk\nhorizons.\n", "  We theoretically study the lattice relaxation in the twisted bilayer graphene\n(TBG) and its effect on the electronic band structure. We develop an effective\ncontinuum theory to describe the lattice relaxation in general TBGs and obtain\nthe optimized structure to minimize the total energy. At small rotation angles\n$< 2^{\\circ}$, in particular, we find that the relaxed lattice drastically\nreduces the area of AA-stacking region, and form a triangular domain structure\nwith alternating AB and BA stacking regions. We then investigate the effect of\nthe domain formation on the electronic band structure. The most notable change\nfrom the non-relaxed model is that an energy gap up to 20meV opens at the\nsuperlattice subband edges on the electron and hole sides. We also find that\nthe lattice relaxation significantly enhances the Fermi velocity, which was\nstrongly suppressed in the non-relaxed model.\n", "  Lattice models with complex actions are important for the understanding of\nmatter at finite densities, but not accessible by the standard Monte Carlo\ntechniques due to the sign problem. Here we derive a new approach for avoiding\nthe complex action/sign problem, by extending the method of convergent series\nwith a non-Gaussian initial approximation. The main features of the new series\nare demonstrated on the example of the two dimensional oscillating integral.\n", "  Recently, it has been claimed that inflationary models with an inflection\npoint in the scalar potential can produce a large resonance in the power\nspectrum of curvature perturbation. In this paper however we show that the\nprevious analyses are incorrect. The reason is twofold: firstly, the inflaton\nis over-shot from a stage of standard inflation and so deviates from the\nslow-roll attractor before reaching the inflection. Secondly, on the (or close\nto) the inflection point, the ultra-slow-roll trajectory supersede the\nslow-roll one and thus, the slow-roll approximations used in the literature\ncannot be used. We then reconsider the model and provide a recipe for how to\nproduce nevertheless a large peak in the matter power spectrum via fine-tuning\nof parameters.\n", "  Optimal simultaneous control of position and momentum can be achieved by\nmaximizing the probabilities of finding their experimentally observed values\nwithin two well-defined intervals. The assumption that particles move along\nstraight lines in free space can then be tested by deriving a lower limit for\nthe probability of finding the particle in a corresponding spatial interval at\nany intermediate time t. Here, it is shown that this lower limit can be\nviolated by quantum superpositions of states confined within the respective\nposition and momentum intervals. These violations of the particle propagation\ninequality show that quantum mechanics changes the laws of motion at a\nfundamental level, providing a new perspective on causality relations and time\nevolution in quantum mechanics.\n", "  We consider two distant spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles (or qubits) and a number\nof interacting objects, all with the same value $S\\gg1$ of their respective\nspin, distributed on a one-dimensional lattice (or large-$S$ spin chain). The\nquantum states of the chain are constructed by linearly combining tensor\nproducts of single-spin coherent states, whose evolution is determined\naccordingly, i.e., via classical-like equations of motions. We show that the\nquantum superposition of the above product states resulting from a local\ninteraction between the first qubit and one spin of the chain evolves so that\nthe second qubit, after having itself interacted with another spin of the\nchain, can be entangled with the first qubit. Obtaining such outcome does not\nimply imposing constraints on the length of the chain or the distance between\nthe qubits, which demonstrates the possibility of generating quantum\ncorrelations at a distance by means of a macroscopic system, as far as local\ninteractions with just a few of its components are feasible.\n", "  Although SU(2) isospin symmetry is generally assumed in the basic theory of\nthe strong interaction, a number of significant violations have been observed\nin scattering and bound states of nucleons. Many of these violations can be\nattributed to the electromagnetic interaction but the question of how much of\nthe violation is due to it remains open. A schematic model based on clustering\nof quarks in the interior of the confinement region of the two-nucleon system\nis introduced and evaluated. In this model the Coulomb interaction is the\nsource of all isospin breaking. It draws on a picture of the quark density\nbased on the diquark-quark model of hadron structure which has been\ninvestigated by a number of groups. The model produces three isospin breaking\npotentials connecting This illustrative model suggests that the breaking seen\nin the low-energy NN interaction may be understood in terms of the Coulomb\nforce between members of diquark clusters. It allows the prediction of the\ncharge symmetry breaking interaction and the $nn$ scattering length from the\nwell measured $np$ singlet scattering length. Values of the $nn$ scattering\nlength around $-18$ fm are favored. Since the model is based on the quark\npicture, it can be easily extended, in the SU(3) limit, to calculate isospin\nbreaking in the strange sector in the corresponding channels. A natural\nconsequence of isospin breaking from diquark clustering is that the breaking in\nthe strange sector, as measured by the separation energy difference between\n$_{\\Lambda}^4$H and $_{\\Lambda}^4$He, is several times larger than that seen in\nthe comparison of three-nucleon mirror nuclei as observed experimentally.\n", "  A detailed level collisional-radiative model of the E1 transition spectrum of\nCa-like W$^{54+}$ ion has been constructed. All the necessary atomic data has\nbeen calculated by relativistic configuration interaction (RCI) method with the\nimplementation of Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). The results are in reasonable\nagreement with the available experimental and previous theoretical data. The\nsynthetic spectrum has explained the EBIT spectrum in 29.5-32.5 \\AA ,, while\nseveral new strong transitions has been proposed to be observed in 18.5-19.6\n\\AA , for the future EBIT experiment with electron density $n_e$ = $10^{12}$\ncm$^{-3}$ and electron beam energy $E_e$ = 18.2 keV.\n", "  We investigate dynamics of probe particles moving in the near-horizon limit\nof (2N+1)-dimensional extremal Myers-Perry black hole (in the cases of N=3,4,5)\nwith arbitrary rotation parameters. Very recently it has been shown\narXiv:1703.00713v1 [hep-th] that in the most general case with nonequal\nnonvanishing rotational parameters the system admits separation of variables in\nN-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinates. We wrote down the explicit expressions\nof Liouville integrals of motion, given in arXiv:1703.00713v1 [hep-th] in\nellipsoidal coordinates, in initial \"Cartesian\" coordinates in seven, nine and\neleven dimensions, and found that these expressions hold in any dimension.\nThen, taking the limit where all of the rotational parameters are equal, we\nreveal that each of these N-1 integrals of motion results in the Hamiltonian of\nthe spherical mechanics of a (2N+1)-dimensional MP black hole with equal\nnonvanishing rotational parameters.\n", "  We introduce a framework for non-linear time evolution in quantum mechanics\nas a natural non-linear generalization of the Schrodinger equation. Within our\nframework, we derive simple toy models of dynamical geometry on finite graphs.\nAlong similar lines we also propose a model of non-linear quantum field theory\non spaces with state-dependent geometry.\n", "  The choice of statistics for a quantum particle is almost always a discrete\none: either bosonic or fermionic. Anyons are the exceptional case for which the\nstatistics can take a range of intermediate values. Holography provides an\nopportunity to address the question of how the behavior of interacting anyons\ndepends on the choice of statistics. In this paper, we analyze the spectrum of\na strongly coupled, gapless fluid of anyons described holographically by the\nD3-D7' model with alternative boundary conditions. We investigate how these\nalternative boundary conditions impact the instability of the gapless\nhomogeneous phase toward the formation of spatial order. In addition, we also\nshow that for a particular, limiting choice of the alternative boundary\nconditions, this holographic system can be interpreted as describing strongly\ncoupled (2+1)-dimensional QED. In this case, the instability leads to a\nspontaneous, spatially modulated magnetic field.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that bipartite Hubbard systems with inhomogeneous\nhopping amplitudes can exhibit higher pair-binding energies than the uniform\nmodel. Here we examine whether this result holds for systems with a more\ngeneric band structure. To this end, we use exact diagonalization and the\ndensity matrix renormalization group method to study the 4x4 Hubbard cluster\nand the two-leg Hubbard ladder with checkerboard-modulated nearest-neighbor\nhopping, t, and next-nearest-neighbor (diagonal) hopping, t_d. We find that the\nstrongest pairing continues to occur at an intermediate level of inhomogeneity.\nWhile the maximal pair-binding energy is enhanced by a positive t_d/t, it is\nsuppressed and appears at weaker repulsion strengths and smaller hole\nconcentrations when t_d/t is negative. We point out a possible connection\nbetween the pairing maximum and the magnetic properties of the system.\n", "  Background: The study of deep-inelastic reactions of nuclei provide a vehicle\nto investigate nuclear transport phenomena for a full range of equilibration\ndynamics. These inquires provide us the ingredients to model such phenomena and\nhelp answer important questions about the nuclear Equation of State (EOS) and\nits evolution as a function of neutron-to-proton $(N/Z)$ ratio. Purpose: The\nmotivation is to examine the real-time dynamics of nuclear transport phenomena\nand its dependence on $(N/Z)$ asymmetry from a microscopic point of view to\navoid any pre-conceived assumptions about the involved processes. Method:\nTime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method in full 3D is employed to calculate\ndeep-inelastic reactions of $^{78}$Kr+$^{208}$Pb and $^{92}$Kr+$^{208}$Pb\nsystems at 8.5~MeV$/A$. The impact parameter and energy-loss dependence of\nrelevant observables are calculated. In addition, density constrained TDHF\nmethod is used to compute excitation energies of the primary fragments. The\nstatistical deexcitation code GEMINI is utilized to examine the final reaction\nproducts. Results: The kinetic energy loss and sticking times as a function of\nimpact parameter are calculated. Final properties of the fragments (charge,\nmass, scattering angle, kinetic energy) are computed. Conclusions: We find a\nsmooth dependence of the energy loss, $E_\\mathrm{loss}$, on the impact\nparameter for both systems. On the other hand the transfer properties for low\n$E_\\mathrm{loss}$ values are very different for the two systems but become\nsimilar in the higher $E_\\mathrm{loss}$ regime. The mean life time of the\ncharge equilibration process, obtained from the final $(N-Z)/A$ value of the\nfragments, is shown to be $\\sim 0.5$~zs. This value is slightly larger (but of\nthe same order) than the value obtained from reactions at Fermi energies.\n", "  Recent determinations of the radial distributions of mono-metallicity\npopulations (MMPs, i.e., stars in narrow bins in [Fe/H] within wider\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] ranges) by the SDSS-III/APOGEE DR12 survey cast doubts on the\nclassical thin - thick disk dichotomy. The analysis of these observations lead\nto the non-$[\\alpha$/Fe] enhanced populations splitting into MMPs with\ndifferent surface densities according to their [Fe/H]. By contrast,\n$[\\alpha$/Fe] enhanced (i.e., old) populations show an homogeneous behaviour.\nWe analyze these results in the wider context of disk formation within\nnon-isolated halos embedded in the Cosmic Web, resulting in a two-phase mass\nassembly. By performing hydrodynamical simulations in the context of the $\\rm\n\\Lambda CDM$ model, we have found that the two phases of halo mass assembly (an\nearly, fast phase, followed by a slow one, with low mass assembly rates) are\nvery relevant to determine the radial structure of MMP distributions, while\nradial mixing has only a secondary role, depending on the coeval dynamical\nand/or destabilizing events. Indeed, while the frequent dynamical violent\nevents occuring at high redshift remove metallicity gradients, and imply\nefficient stellar mixing, the relatively quiescent dynamics after the\ntransition keeps [Fe/H] gaseous gradients and prevents newly formed stars to\nsuffer from strong radial mixing. By linking the two-component disk concept\nwith the two-phase halo mass assembly scenario, our results set halo\nvirialization (the event marking the transition from the fast to the slow\nphases) as the separating event marking periods characterized by different\nphysical conditions under which thick and thin disk stars were born.\n", "  The purpose of this work is the characterization of the radial distribution\nof dust, stars, gas, and star-formation rate (SFR) in a sub-sample of 18\nface-on spiral galaxies extracted from the DustPedia sample. This study is\nperformed by exploiting the multi-wavelength, from UV to sub-mm bands,\nDustPedia database, in addition to molecular (12CO) and atomic (HI) gas maps\nand metallicity abundance information available in the literature. We fitted\nthe surface brightness profiles of the tracers of dust and stars, the mass\nsurface density profiles of dust, stars, molecular gas, and total gas, and the\nSFR surface density profiles with an exponential curve and derived their\nscale-lengths. We also developed a method to solve for the CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor (alpha_CO) per galaxy by using dust and gas mass profiles. Although each\ngalaxy has its own peculiar behaviour, we identified a common trend of the\nexponential scale-lengths vs. wavelength. On average, the scale-lengths\nnormalized to the B-band 25 mag/arcsec^2 radius decrease from UV to 70 micron,\nfrom 0.4 to 0.2, and then increase back up to 0.3 at 500 microns. The main\nresult is that, on average, the dust mass surface density scale-length is about\n1.8 times the stellar one derived from IRAC data and the 3.6 micron surface\nbrightness, and close to that in the UV. We found a mild dependence of the\nscale-lengths on the Hubble stage T: the scale-lengths of the Herschel bands\nand the 3.6 micron scale-length tend to increase from earlier to later types,\nthe scale-length at 70 micron tends to be smaller than that at longer sub-mm\nwavelength with ratios between longer sub-mm wavelengths and 70 micron that\ndecrease with increasing T. The scale-length ratio of SFR and stars shows a\nweak increasing trend towards later types.\n", "  The two component model describes neutron star dynamics incorporating the\nresponse of the superfluid interior. Conventional solutions and applications\ninvolve constant external torques, as appropriate for radio pulsars on\ndynamical timescales. We present the general solution of two component dynamics\nunder arbitrary time dependent external torques, with internal torques that are\nlinear in the rotation rates, or with the extremely non-linear internal torques\ndue to vortex creep. The two-component model incorporating the response of\nlinear or nonlinear internal torques can now be applied not only to radio\npulsars but also to magnetars and to neutron stars in binary systems, with\nstrong observed variability and noise in the spin-down or spin-up rates. Our\nresults allow the extraction of the time dependent external torques from the\nobserved spin-down (or spin-up) time series, $\\dot{\\Omega}(t)$. Applications\nare discussed.\n", "  We outline a general formalism of hydrodynamics for quantum systems with\nmultiple particle species which undergo completely elastic scattering. In the\nthermodynamic limit, the complete kinematic data of the problem consists of the\nparticle content, the dispersion relations, and a universal dressing\ntransformation which accounts for interparticle interactions. We consider\nquantum integrable models and we focus on the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard\nmodel. By linearizing hydrodynamic equations, we provide exact closed-form\nexpressions for Drude weights, generalized static charge susceptibilities and\ncharge-current correlators valid on hydrodynamic scale, represented as integral\nkernels operating diagonally in the space of mode numbers of thermodynamic\nexcitations. We find that, on hydrodynamic scales, Drude weights manifestly\ndisplay Onsager reciprocal relations even for generic (i.e. non-canonical)\nequilibrium states, and establish a generalized detailed balance condition for\na general quantum integrable model. We present the first exact analytic\nexpressions for the general Drude weights in the Hubbard model, and explain how\nto reconcile different approaches for computing Drude weights from the previous\nliterature.\n", "  Nearly aligned graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (G/BN) can be accurately\nmodeled by a Dirac Hamiltonian perturbed by smoothly varying moir\\'e pattern\npseudospin fields. Here, we present the moir\\'e-band model of G/BN for\narbitrary small twist angles under a framework that combines symmetry\nconsiderations with input from ab-initio calculations. Our analysis of the band\ngaps at the primary and secondary Dirac points highlights the role of inversion\nsymmetry breaking contributions of the moir\\'e patterns, leading to primary\nDirac point gaps when the moir\\'e strains give rise to a finite average mass,\nand to secondary gaps when the moir\\'e pseudospin components are mixed\nappropriately. The pseudomagnetic strain fields which can reach values of up to\n$\\sim$40 Tesla near symmetry points in the moir\\'e cell stem almost entirely\nfrom virtual hopping and dominate over the contributions arising from bond\nlength distortions due to the moir\\'e strains.\n", "  Emission of fullerenes in their infrared vibrational bands has been detected\nin space near hot stars. The proposed attribution of the diffuse interstellar\nbands at 9577 and 9632 \\AA\\ to electronic transitions of the\nbuckminsterfullerene cation (i.e. C$_{60}^+$ ) was recently supported by new\nlaboratory data, confirming the presence of this species in the diffuse\ninterstellar medium (ISM). In this letter, we present the detection, also in\nthe diffuse ISM, of the 17.4 and 18.9 $\\mu$m emission bands commonly attributed\nto vibrational bands of neutral C$_{60}$. According to classical models that\ncompute the charge state of large molecules in space, C$_{60}$ is expected to\nbe mostly neutral in the diffuse ISM. This is in agreement with the abundances\nof diffuse C$_{60}$ we derive here from observations.\n", "  We obtain high resolution spectra of nine red giant branch stars in NGC 6681\nand perform the first detailed abundance analysis of stars in this cluster. We\nconfirm cluster membership for these stars based on consistent radial\nvelocities of 214.5$\\pm$3.7 km/s and find a mean [Fe/H] = -1.63$\\pm$0.07 dex\nand [{\\alpha}/Fe] = 0.42$\\pm$0.11 dex. Additionally, we confirm the existence\nof a Na-O anti-correlation in NGC 6681 and identify two populations of stars\nwith unique abundance trends. With the use of HST photometry from Sarajedini et\nal. (2007) and Piotto et al. (2015) we are able to identify these two\npopulations as discrete sequences in the cluster CMD. Although we cannot\nconfirm the nature of the polluter stars responsible for the abundance\ndifferences in these populations, these results do help put constraints on\npossible polluter candidates.\n", "  The chromosphere is a highly complex and dynamic layer of the Sun, that\nserves as a conduit for mass and energy supply between two, very distinct\nregions of the solar atmosphere, namely, the photosphere and corona. Inferring\nmagnetic fields in the chromosphere, has thus become an important topic, that\ncan be addressed with large-aperture solar telescopes to carry out highly\nsensitive polarimetric measurements. In this article, we present a design of a\npolarimeter for investigating the chromospheric magnetic field. The instrument\nconsists of a number of lenses, two ferro-electric liquid crystals, a Wollaston\nprism, and a CCD camera. The optical design is similar to that of a commercial\nzoom lens which allows a variable f-number while maintaining focus and\naberrations well within the Airy disc. The optical design of the Adaptable\nChRomOspheric POLarimeter (ACROPOL) makes use of off-the-shelf components and\nis described for the 70 cm Vacuum Tower Telescope and the 1.5 m GREGOR\ntelescope at Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. Our design shows that the\noptical train can be separated into two units where the first unit, consisting\nof a single lens, has to be changed while going from the VTT to the GREGOR\nconfiguration. We also discuss the tolerances within which, diffraction limited\nperformance can be achieved with our design.\n", "  We construct an analytical approximation for the numerical black hole metric\nof P. Kanti, et. al. [PRD54, 5049 (1996)] in the four-dimensional\nEinstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) theory. The continued fraction expansion\nin terms of a compactified radial coordinate, used here, converges slowly when\nthe dilaton coupling approaches its extremal values, but for a black hole far\nfrom the extremal state, the analytical formula has a maximal relative error of\na fraction of one percent already within the third order of the continued\nfraction expansion. The suggested analytical representation of the numerical\nblack hole metric is relatively compact and good approximation in the whole\nspace outside the black hole event horizon. Therefore, it can serve in the same\nway as an exact solution when analyzing particles' motion, perturbations,\nquasinormal modes, Hawking radiation, accreting disks and many other problems\nin the vicinity of a black hole. In addition, we construct the approximate\nanalytical expression for the dilaton field.\n", "  Most of the literature on general relativity over the last century assumes\nthat the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is zero. However, by now independent\nobservations have led to a consensus that the dynamics of the universe is best\ndescribed by Einstein's equations with a small but positive $\\Lambda$.\nInterestingly, this requires a drastic revision of conceptual frameworks\ncommonly used in general relativity, \\emph{no matter how small $\\Lambda$ is.}\nWe first explain why, and then summarize the current status of generalizations\nof these frameworks to include a positive $\\Lambda$, focusing on gravitational\nwaves.\n", "  The repulsive Fermi Hubbard model on the square lattice has a rich phase\ndiagram near half-filling (corresponding to the particle density per lattice\nsite $n=1$): for $n=1$ the ground state is an antiferromagnetic insulator, at\n$0.6 < n \\lesssim 0.8$, it is a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superfluid (at least for\nmoderately strong interactions $U \\lesssim 4t$ in terms of the hopping $t$),\nand the region $1-n \\ll 1$ is most likely subject to phase separation. Much of\nthis physics is preempted at finite temperatures and to an extent driven by\nstrong magnetic fluctuations, their quantitative characteristics and how they\nchange with the doping level being much less understood. Experiments on\nultra-cold atoms have recently gained access to this interesting fluctuation\nregime, which is now under extensive investigation. In this work we employ a\nself-consistent skeleton diagrammatic approach to quantify the characteristic\ntemperature scale $T_{M}(n)$ for the onset of magnetic fluctuations with a\nlarge correlation length and identify their nature. Our results suggest that\nthe strongest fluctuations---and hence highest $T_{M}$ and easiest experimental\naccess to this regime---are observed at $U/t \\approx 4-6$.\n", "  Using a soft-wall AdS/QCD approach we derive the Schr\\\"odinger-type equation\nof motion for the tetraquark wave function, which is dual to the dimension-4\nAdS bulk profile. The latter coincides with the number of constituents in the\nleading Fock state of the tetraquark. The obtained equation of motion is solved\nanalytically, providing predictions for both the tetraquark wave function and\nits mass. A low mass limit for possible tetraquark states is given by $M \\ge 2\n\\kappa = 1$ GeV, where $\\kappa = 0.5$ GeV is the typical value of the scale\nparameter in soft-wall AdS/QCD. We confirm results of the COMPASS Collaboration\nrecently reported on the discovery of the $a_1(1414)$ state, interpreted as a\ntetraquark state composed of light quarks and having $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$. Our\nprediction for the mass of this state, $M_{a_1} = \\sqrt{2}$ GeV $\\simeq 1.414$\nGeV, is in good agreement with the COMPASS result $M_{a_1} =\n1.414^{+0.015}_{-0.013}$ GeV. Next we included finite quark mass effects, which\nare essential for the tetraquark states involving heavy quarks.\n", "  The SN1987A in the Giant Magellanic Cloud was an amazing and extraordinary\nevent because it was detected in real time for different neutrinos experiments\n($\\nu$s) around the world. Approximate $\\sim25$ events were observed in three\ndifferent experiments: Kamiokande II (KII) $\\sim 12$,\nIrvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) $\\sim 8$ e Baksan $\\sim 5$, plus a contrived\nburst at Mont Blanc (Liquid Scintillator Detector - LSD) later dismissed\nbecause of energetic requirements (Aglietta et al. 1988). The neutrinos have an\nimportant play role into the neutron star newborn: at the moment when the\nsupernova explodes the compact object remnant is freezing by neutrinos\n($\\sim99\\%$ energy is lost in the few seconds of the explosion). The work is\nmotivated by neutrinos' event in relation arrival times where there is a\ntemporal gap between set of events ($\\sim6\\mbox{s}$). The first part of dataset\ncame from the ordinary mechanism of freezing and the second part suggests\ndifferent mechanism of neutrinos production. We tested two models of cooling\nfor neutrinos from SN1987A: 1st an exponential cooling is an ordinary model of\ncooling and 2nd a two-step temperature model that it considers two bursts\nseparated with temporal gap. Our analysis was done with Bayesian tools ({\\it\nBayesian Information Criterion} - BIC) The result showed strong evidence in\nfavor of a two-step model against one single exponential cooling\n($\\ln\\mbox{B}_{ij} > 5.0$), and suggests the existence of two neutrino bursts\nat the moment the neutron star was born.\n", "  The inclusive cross sections for di-hadrons of charged pions and kaons\n($e^+e^- \\rightarrow hhX$) in electron-positron annihilation are reported. They\nare obtained as a function of the total fractional energy and invariant mass\nfor any di-hadron combination in the same hemisphere as defined by the thrust\nevent-shape variable and its axis. Since same-hemisphere di-hadrons can be\nassumed to originate predominantly from the same initial parton, di-hadron\nfragmentation functions are probed. These di-hadron fragmentation functions are\nneeded as an unpolarized baseline in order to quantitatively understand related\nspin-dependent measurements in other processes and to apply them to the\nextraction of quark transversity distribution functions in the nucleon. The\ndi-hadron cross sections are obtained from a $655\\,{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ data sample\ncollected at or near the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at\nthe KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider.\n", "  We obtain the non-linear generalization of the Sachs-Wolfe + integrated\nSachs-Wolfe (ISW) formula describing the CMB temperature anisotropies. Our\nformula is valid at all orders in perturbation theory, is also valid in all\ngauges and includes scalar, vector and tensor modes. A direct consequence of\nour results is that the maps of the logarithmic temperature anisotropies are\nmuch cleaner than the usual CMB maps, because they automatically remove many\nsecondary anisotropies. This can for instance, facilitate the search for\nprimordial non-Gaussianity in future works. It also disentangles the non-linear\nISW from other effects. Finally, we provide a method which can iteratively be\nused to obtain the lensing solution at the desired order.\n", "  Maybe not. String theory approaches to both beyond the Standard Model and\nInflationary model building generically predict the existence of scalars\n(moduli) that are light compared to the scale of quantum gravity. These moduli\nbecome displaced from their low energy minima in the early universe and lead to\na prolonged matter-dominated epoch prior to BBN. In this paper, we examine\nwhether non-perturbative effects such as parametric resonance or tachyonic\ninstabilities can shorten, or even eliminate, the moduli condensate and\nmatter-dominated epoch. Such effects depend crucially on the strength of the\ncouplings, and we find that unless the moduli become strongly coupled the\nmatter-dominated epoch is unavoidable. In particular, we find that in string\nand M-theory compactifications where the lightest moduli are near the TeV-scale\nthat a matter-dominated epoch will persist until the time of Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis.\n", "  The diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission should exhibit a low level of\ndiffuse circular polarization (CP) due to the circular motions of the emitting\nrelativistic electrons. This probes the Galactic magnetic field in a similar\nway as the product of total Galactic synchrotron intensity times Faraday depth.\nWe use this to construct an all sky prediction of the so far unexplored\nGalactic CP from existing measurements. This map can be used to search for this\nCP signal in low frequency radio data even prior to imaging. If detected as\npredicted, it would confirm the expectation that relativistic electrons, and\nnot positrons, are responsible for the Galactic radio emission. Furthermore,\nthe strength of real to predicted circular polarization would provide\nstatistical information on magnetic structures along the line-of-sights.\n", "  We compare the structure of molecular gas at $40$ pc resolution to the\nability of gas to form stars across the disk of the spiral galaxy M51. We break\nthe PAWS survey into $370$ pc and $1.1$ kpc resolution elements, and within\neach we estimate the molecular gas depletion time ($\\tau_{\\rm Dep}^{\\rm mol}$),\nthe star formation efficiency per free fall time ($\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$), and the\nmass-weighted cloud-scale (40 pc) properties of the molecular gas: surface\ndensity, $\\Sigma$, line width, $\\sigma$, and\n$b\\equiv\\Sigma/\\sigma^2\\propto\\alpha_{\\rm vir}^{-1}$, a parameter that traces\nthe boundedness of the gas. We show that the cloud-scale surface density\nappears to be a reasonable proxy for mean volume density. Applying this, we\nfind a typical star formation efficiency per free-fall time, $\\epsilon_{ff}\n\\left( \\left< \\Sigma_{40pc} \\right> \\right) \\sim 0.3{-}0.36\\%$, lower than\nadopted in many models and found for local clouds. More, the efficiency per\nfree fall time anti-correlates with both $\\Sigma$ and $\\sigma$, in some tension\nwith turbulent star formation models. The best predictor of the rate of star\nformation per unit gas mass in our analysis is $b \\equiv \\Sigma / \\sigma^2$,\ntracing the strength of self gravity, with $\\tau_{\\rm Dep}^{\\rm mol} \\propto\nb^{-0.9}$. The sense of the correlation is that gas with stronger self-gravity\n(higher $b$) forms stars at a higher rate (low $\\tau_{\\rm Dep}^{\\rm mol}$). The\ndifferent regions of the galaxy mostly overlap in $\\tau_{\\rm Dep}^{\\rm mol}$ as\na function of $b$, so that low $b$ explains the surprisingly high $\\tau_{\\rm\nDep}^{\\rm mol}$ found towards the inner spiral arms found by by Meidt et al.\n(2013).\n", "  We report on a combined study of the de Haas-van Alphen effect and angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy on single crystals of the metallic\ndelafossite PdRhO$_2$ rounded off by \\textit{ab initio} band structure\ncalculations. A high sensitivity torque magnetometry setup with SQUID readout\nand synchrotron-based photoemission with a light spot size of\n$~50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ enabled high resolution data to be obtained from samples\nas small as $150\\times100\\times20\\,(\\mu\\mathrm{m})^3$. The Fermi surface shape\nis nearly cylindrical with a rounded hexagonal cross section enclosing a\nLuttinger volume of 1.00(1) electrons per formula unit.\n", "  We revisit SN1987A constraints on light, hidden sector gauge bosons (\"dark\nphotons\") that are coupled to the standard model through kinetic mixing with\nthe photon. These constraints are realized because excessive bremsstrahlung\nradiation of the dark photon can lead to rapid cooling of the SN1987A\nprogenitor core, in contradiction to the observed neutrinos from that event.\nThe models we consider are of interest as phenomenological models of strongly\nself-interacting dark matter. We clarify several possible ambiguities in the\nliterature and identify errors in prior analyses. We find constraints on the\ndark photon mixing parameter that are in rough agreement with the early\nestimates of Dent et al., but only because significant errors in their analyses\nfortuitously canceled. Our constraints are in good agreement with subsequent\nanalyses by Rrapaj & Reddy and Hardy & Lasenby. We estimate the dark photon\nbremsstrahlung rate using one-pion exchange (OPE), while Rrapaj & Reddy use a\nsoft radiation approximation (SRA) to exploit measured nuclear scattering cross\nsections. We find that the differences between mixing parameter constraints\nobtained through the OPE approximation or the SRA approximation are roughly a\nfactor of $\\sim 2-3$. Hardy & Laseby include plasma effects in their\ncalculations finding significantly weaker constraints on dark photon mixing for\ndark photon masses below $\\sim 10\\, \\mathrm{MeV}$. We do not consider plasma\neffects. Lastly, we point out that the properties of the SN1987A progenitor\ncore remain somewhat uncertain and that this uncertainty alone causes\nuncertainty of at least a factor of $\\sim 2-3$ in the excluded values of the\ndark photon mixing parameter. Further refinement of these estimates is\nunwarranted until either the interior of the SN1987A progenitor is more well\nunderstood or additional, large, and heretofore neglected effects, are\nidentified.\n", "  We present a generalized velocity gauge form of the relativistic laser-matter\ninteraction. In comparison with the (equivalent) regular minimal coupling\ndescription, this new form of the light-matter interaction results in superior\nconvergence properties for the numerical solution of the time-dependent Dirac\nequation. This applies both to the numerical treatment and, more importantly,\nto the multipole expansion of the laser field. The advantages of the\nalternative gauge is demonstrated in hydrogen by studies of the dynamics\nfollowing the impact of superintense laser pulses of extreme ultraviolet\nwavelengths and sub-femtosecond duration.\n", "  Based on the relation between a plane phased array and plane waves we show\nthat a spherical current layer or a current sphere proportional to a multipole\nelectric field and situated in a uniform medium generates the same multipole\nfield in all space. We calculate TE and TM multipoles inside and outside the\nspherical layer. The $l=1$ TM multipoles are localized at the origin with a\nfocal spot with full width at half maximum of $0.4\\lambda$ in the lateral axes\nand $0.58\\lambda$ in the vertical axis. The multipole fields near the origin\nare prescriptions for the current distributions required to generate those\nmultipole fields. A spherical layer can couple to a multipole source since the\noscillation of the electrons in the layer due to the multipole field generates\nthe multipole field in all space, which in turn can drive the multipole\ncurrents. Exciting a multipole in a polarizable sphere or spherical layer can\ncouple it to another polarizable sphere or spherical layer.\n", "  We present a novel global QCD analysis of charged $D^{*}$-meson fragmentation\nfunctions at next-to-leading order accuracy. This is achieved by making use of\nthe available data for single-inclusive $D^{*}$-meson production in\nelectron-positron annihilation, hadron-hadron collisions, and, for the first\ntime, in-jet fragmentation in proton-proton scattering. It is shown how to\ninclude all relevant processes efficiently and without approximations within\nthe Mellin moment technique, specifically for the in-jet fragmentation cross\nsection. The presented technical framework is generic and can be\nstraightforwardly applied to future analyses of fragmentation functions for\nother hadron species, as soon as more in-jet fragmentation data become\navailable. We choose to work within the Zero Mass Variable Flavor Number Scheme\nwhich is applicable for sufficiently high energies and transverse momenta. The\nobtained optimum set of parton-to-$D^{*}$ fragmentation functions is\naccompanied by Hessian uncertainty sets which allow one to propagate\nhadronization uncertainties to other processes of interest.\n", "  We investigate the symmetry property and the stability of the heptaquark\ncontaining two identical heavy antiquarks using color-spin interaction. We\nconstruct the wave function of the heptaquark from the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple in the SU(3) breaking case. The stability of the heptaquark against\nthe strong decay into one baryon and two mesons is discussed in a simple\nchromomagnetic model. We find that $q^2 s^3 \\bar{s}^2$ with $I=0,S=\\frac{5}{2}$\nis the most stable heptaquark configuration that could be probed by\nreconstructing the $\\Lambda+\\phi+\\phi$ invariant mass.\n", "  Although copper and bismuth do not form any compounds at ambient conditions,\ntwo intermetallics, CuBi and Cu$_{11}$Bi$_7$, were recently synthesized at high\npressures. Here we report on the discovery of additional copper-bismuth phases\nat elevated pressures with high-densities from ab initio calculations. In\nparticular, a Cu$_2$Bi compound is found to be thermodynamically stable at\npressures above 59 GPa, crystallizing in the cubic Laves structure. In strong\ncontrast to Cu$_{11}$Bi$_7$ and CuBi, cubic Cu$_2$Bi does not exhibit any voids\nor channels. Since the bismuth lone pairs in cubic Cu$_2$Bi are\nstereochemically inactive, the constituent elements can be closely packed and a\nhigh density of 10.52 g/cm$^{3}$ at 0 GPa is achieved. The moderate\nelectron-phonon coupling of $\\lambda=0.68$ leads to a superconducting\ntemperature of 2 K, which exceeds the values observed both in\nCu$_{11}$Bi$_7$and CuBi, as well as in elemental Cu and Bi .\n", "  We study the dependence of galaxy clustering on atomic gas mass using a\nsample of $\\sim$16,000 galaxies with redshift in the range of $0.0025<z<0.05$\nand HI mass of $M_{\\rm HI}>10^8M_{\\odot}$, drawn from the 70% complete sample\nof the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. We construct subsamples of galaxies\nwith $M_{\\rm HI}$ above different thresholds, and make volume-limited\nclustering measurements in terms of three statistics: the projected two-point\ncorrelation function, the projected cross-correlation function with respect to\na reference sample selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the\nredshift-space monopole moment. In contrast to previous studies, which found\nno/weak HI-mass dependence, we find both the clustering amplitude on scales\nabove a few Mpc and the bias factors to increase significantly with increasing\nHI mass for subsamples with HI mass thresholds above $10^9M_{\\odot}$. For HI\nmass thresholds below $10^9M_{\\odot}$, while the measurements have large\nuncertainties caused by the limited survey volume and sample size, the inferred\ngalaxy bias factors are systematically lower than the minimum halo bias factor\nfrom mass-selected halo samples. The simple halo model, in which galaxy content\nis only determined by halo mass, has difficulties in interpreting the\nclustering measurements of the HI-selected samples. We extend the simple model\nby including the halo formation time as an additional parameter. A model that\nputs HI-rich galaxies into halos that formed late can reproduce the clustering\nmeasurements reasonably well. We present the implications of our best-fitting\nmodel on the correlation of HI mass with halo mass and formation time, as well\nas the halo occupation distributions and HI mass functions for central and\nsatellite galaxies. These results are compared with the predictions from\nsemi-analytic galaxy formation models and hydrodynamic galaxy formation\nsimulations.\n", "  We present a novel cosmological solution in the framework of extended\nquasidilaton theory which underwent scrutiny recently. We only consider terms\nthat do not generate the Boulware-Deser degree of freedom, hence the\n\"ghost-free\" quasidilaton theory, and show three new branches of cosmological\nevolution therein. One of the solutions passes the perturbative stability\ntests. This new solution exhibits a late time self-acceleration and all\ngraviton polarizations acquire masses that converge to a constant in the\nasymptotic future. Moreover, all modes propagate at the speed of light. We\npropose that this solution can be used as a benchmark model for future\nphenomenological studies.\n", "  Through analysis of variable temperature neutron powder diffraction data, we\npresent solutions for the magnetic structures of SrMn$_7$O$_{12}$,\nCdMn$_7$O$_{12}$, and PbMn$_7$O$_{12}$ in all long-range ordered phases. The\nthree compounds were found to have magnetic structures analogous to that\nreported for CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$. They all feature a higher temperature lock-in\nphase with \\emph{commensurate} magneto-orbital coupling, and a delocked,\nmulti-\\textbf{k} magnetic ground state where \\emph{incommensurate}\nmagneto-orbital coupling gives rise to a constant-moment magnetic helix with\nmodulated spin helicity. CdMn$_7$O$_{12}$ represents a special case in which\nthe orbital modulation is commensurate with the crystal lattice and involves\nstacking of fully and partially polarized orbital states. Our results provide a\nrobust confirmation of the phenomenological model for magneto-orbital coupling\npreviously presented for CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$. Furthermore, we show that the model\nis universal to the $A^{2+}$ quadruple perovskite manganites synthesised to\ndate, and that it is tunable by selection of the $A$-site ionic radius.\n", "  Motivated by a recent experiment [L. F. Livi, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 117,\n220401(2016)], we study the ground-state properties of interacting fermions in\na one-dimensional optical lattice clock with spin-orbit coupling. As the\nelectronic and the hyperfine-spin states in the clock-state manifolds can be\ntreated as effective sites along distinct synthetic dimensions, the system can\nbe considered as multiple two-leg ladders with uniform magnetic flux\npenetrating the plaquettes of each ladder. As the inter-orbital spin-exchange\ninteractions in the clock-state manifolds couple individual ladders together,\nwe show that exotic interaction-induced vortex states emerge in the\ncoupled-ladder system, which compete with existing phases of decoupled ladders\nand lead to a rich phase diagram. Adopting the density matrix renormalization\ngroup approach, we map out the phase diagram, and investigate in detail the\ncurrents and the density-density correlations of the various phases. Our\nresults reveal the impact of interactions on spin-orbit coupled systems, and\nare particularly relevant to the on-going exploration of spin-orbit coupled\noptical lattice clocks.\n", "  We investigate the butterfly effect and charge diffusion near the quantum\nphase transition in holographic approach. We argue that their criticality is\ncontrolled by the holographic scaling geometry with deformations induced by a\nrelevant operator at finite temperature. Specifically, in the quantum critical\nregion controlled by a single fixed point, the butterfly velocity decreases\nwhen deviating from the critical point. While, in the non-critical region, the\nbehavior of the butterfly velocity depends on the specific phase at low\ntemperature. Moreover, in the holographic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition, the universal behavior of the butterfly velocity is absent.\nFinally, the tendency of our holographic results matches with the numerical\nresults of Bose-Hubbard model. A comparison between our result and that in the\n$O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model is also given.\n", "  Models with a light, additional gauge boson are attractive extensions of the\nstandard model. Often these models are only considered as effective low energy\ntheory without any assumption about an UV completion. This leaves not only the\nhierarchy problem of the SM unsolved, but introduces a copy of it because of\nthe new fundamental scalars responsible for breaking the new gauge group. A\npossible solution is to embed these models into a supersymmetric framework.\nHowever, this gives rise to an additional source of fine-tuning compared to the\nMSSM and poses the question how natural such a setup is. One might expect that\nthe additional fine-tuning is huge, namely, $O(M^2_{\\rm SUSY}/m^2_{Z'})$. In\nthis paper we point out that this is not necessarily the case. We show that it\nis possible to find a focus point behaviour also in the new sector in\nco-existence to the MSSM focus point. We call this 'Double Focus Point\nSupersymmetry'. Moreover, we stress the need for a proper inclusion of\nradiative corrections in the fine-tuning calculation: a tree-level estimate\nwould lead to predictions for the tuning which can be wrong by many orders of\nmagnitude. As showcase, we use the $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended MSSM and discuss\npossible consequence of the observed $^8\\textrm{Be}$ anomaly. However, similar\nfeatures are expected for other models with an extended gauge group which\ninvolve potentially large Yukawa-like interactions of the new scalars.\n", "  In the present paper we prove a uniqueness theorem for the regular static,\ntraversable wormhole solutions to the Einstein-phantom scalar field theory with\ntwo asymptotically flat regions (ends). We show that when a certain condition\non the asymptotic values of the scalar field is imposed such solutions are\nuniquely specified by their mass $M$ and the scalar charge $D$.The main\narguments in the proof are based on the positive energy theorem.\n", "  We study current-induced torques in WTe2/permalloy bilayers as a function of\nWTe2 thickness. We measure the torques using both second-harmonic Hall and\nspin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements for samples with WTe2\nthicknesses that span from 16 nm down to a single monolayer. We confirm the\nexistence of an out-of-plane antidamping torque, and show directly that the\nsign of this torque component is reversed across a monolayer step in the WTe2.\nThe magnitude of the out-of-plane antidamping torque depends only weakly on\nWTe2 thickness, such that even a single-monolayer WTe2 device provides a strong\ntorque that is comparable to much thicker samples. In contrast, the\nout-of-plane field-like torque has a significant dependence on the WTe2\nthickness. We demonstrate that this field-like component originates\npredominantly from the Oersted field, thereby correcting a previous inference\ndrawn by our group based on a more limited set of samples.\n", "  The Laplace transform approach with convolution theorem is used to find the\nscattering phase shifts of a Mie-type potential. The normalized scattering wave\nfunctions are also studied. The bound state spectrum and the corresponding\nnormalized wave functions are obtained with the help of the analytical\nproperties of the scattering amplitude.\n", "  Flux estimates for ionizing radiation escaping from star-forming galaxies\nwith characteristic UV luminosities ($L^{*}_{1500(1+z)}$) derived from GALEX\nand the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey, are presented as a function of redshift and\nassumed escape fraction. These estimates offer guidance to the design of\ninstrumentation and observing strategies, be they spectroscopic or photometric,\nattempting to detect LyC escaping star-forming galaxies for redshifts $ z < 3$.\nExamples are given that relate the absolution escape fraction ($f^{e}_{LyC}$)\nof ionizing photons, integrated over the entire extreme UV (EUV) bandpass, to\nthe relative escape fraction ($f^{e}_{900}$) observed just shortward of the\nionization edge at 911.8 \\AA\\ as a function of HI, HeI, and HeII column\ndensities. We find that for $\\log{N_{HI}(cm^{-2})} \\gtrsim 17.0$ $f^{e}_{LyC}$\nis significantly greater than $f^{e}_{900}$. Detection of LyC \"drop-ins\" in the\nrest-frame EUV will provide enhanced fidelity to determinations of the\nintegrated fraction of ionizing photons $f^{e}_{LyC}$ that escape star-forming\ngalaxies and contribute to the meta-galactic ionizing background.\n", "  We study $\\rho$ meson unpolarized generalized parton distributions based on a\nlight-front constituent quark model where the quark-antiquark-meson vertex is\nconstructed under the symmetric loop momentum convention. The form factors and\nsome other low-energy observables of the $\\rho$ meson are calculated. Moreover,\nthe contributions to the form factors and generalized parton distributions from\nthe valence and nonvalence regimes are discussed and analyzed in detail. In the\nforward limit, the usual structure functions are estimated as well. In\naddition, by evolving the moments of the obtained structure functions to the\nscale of the lattice calculation, we give the factorization scale of our quark\nmodel. It is found that the present phenomenological model is reasonable to\ndescribe the general properties of $\\rho$ meson.\n", "  We propose a tight-binding (TB) model, that includes spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC), to describe the electronic properties of methyl-substituted germanane\n(GeCH$_3$). This model gives an electronic spectrum in agreement with first\nprinciple results close to the Fermi level. Using the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ formalism,\nwe show that a topological phase transition from a normal insulator (NI) to a\nquantum spin Hall (QSH) phase occurs at 11.6\\% biaxial tensile strain. The\nsensitivity of the electronic properties of this system on strain, in\nparticular its transition to the topological insulating phase, makes it very\nattractive for applications in strain sensors and other microelectronic\napplications.\n", "  The present work reported a conclusive evidence for anti-magnetic rotational\n(AMR) band in an odd-odd nucleus 142Eu. Parity of the states of a quadrupole\nsequence in 142Eu was firmly identified from polarization measurements using\nthe Indian National Gamma Array and lifetimes of some of the states in the same\nstructure were measured using the Doppler shift attenuation method. The\ndecreasing trends of the deduced quadrupole transition strength B(E2) with\nspin, along with increasing J(2) / B(E2) values conclusively established the\norigin of these states as arising from Antimagnetic rotation. The results were\nwell reproduced by numerical calculations within the framework of a\nsemi-classical geometric model.\n", "  Background: The Anderson-Bogoliubov (AB) phonon, called also the superfluid\nphonon, has attracted attentions since it may influence the thermal\nconductivity and other properties of inner crust of neutron stars. However,\nthere are limited number of microscopic studies of the AB phonon where the\npresence of clusters is explicitly taken into account.\\\\ Purpose: We intend to\nclarify how the presence of clusters affects the AB phonon in order to obtain\nmicroscopic information relevant to the coupling between the AB phonon and the\nlattice phonon. \\\\ Methods: The Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov model and the\nquasiparticle random-phase approximation formulated in a spherical Wigner-Seitz\ncell are adopted to describe neutron superfluidity and associated collective\nexcitations. We perform systematic numerical calculations for dipole excitation\nby varying the neutron chemical potential and the number of protons in a cell.\n\\\\ Results:The model predicts systematic emergence of the dipole AB phonon\nmode, which however exhibits strong suppression of phonon amplitude inside the\ncluster. We find also that the phonon amplitude around the cluster surface\nvaries as the neutron density. At higher neutron densities the AB phonon mode\nexhibits behaviour similar to the pygmy dipole resonance in neutron-rich\nnuclei.\\\\ Conclusions: The dipole AB phonon mode does not penetrate into the\nclusters. This suggests that the coupling between the AB phonon and the lattice\nphonon may be weak.\n", "  We study optical light curve(LC) relations of type Ia supernovae(SNe~Ia) for\ntheir use in cosmology using high-quality photometry published by the\nCarnegie-Supernovae-Project (CSP-I). We revisit the classical\nluminosity-decline-rate ($\\Delta m_{15}$) relation and the Lira-relation, as\nwell as investigate the time evolution of the ($B-V$) color and $B(B-V)$, which\nserves as the basis of the color-stretch relation and\nColor-MAGnitude-Intercept-Calibrations(CMAGIC). Our analysis is based on\nexplosion and radiation transport simulations for spherically-symmetric\ndelayed-detonation models(DDT) producing normal-bright and subluminous SNe~Ia.\nEmpirical LC-relations can be understood as having the same physical\nunderpinnings: i.e. the opacities, ionization balances in the photosphere, and\nradioactive energy deposition changing with time from below to above the\nphotosphere. Some 3-4 weeks past maximum, the photosphere recedes to\n${}^{56}$Ni-rich layers of similar density structure, leading to a similar\ncolor evolution. An important secondary parameter is the central density\n$\\rho_c$ of the WD because at higher densities more electron capture elements\nare produced at the expense of ${}^{56}$Ni production. This results in a\n$\\Delta m_{15}$ spread of 0.1 mag for normal-bright and 0.7 mag in sub-luminous\nSNe~Ia and $\\approx0.2$ mag in the Lira-relation. We show why color-magnitude\ndiagrams emphasize the transition between physical regimes, and allow to\nconstruct templates depend mostly on $\\Delta m_{15}$ with little dispersion in\nboth the CSP-I sample and our DDT-models. This allows to separate intrinsic\nSN~Ia variations from the interstellar reddening characterized by $E(B-V)$ and\n$R_{B}$. Mixing of different explosion scenarios causes a wide spread in\nempirical relations which may suggest one dominant scenario.\n", "  We study the relativistic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto a\nSchwarzschild black hole (BH), which is surrounded by rigid and small, randomly\ndistributed, bodies. These bodies are idealized representations of substructure\nlike stars passing close to the BH, bubbles created by stellar winds or cold\nclumps.We explore cases where the filling factor of these bodies is small. The\nflow is assumed to be adiabatic and move supersonically towards the black hole.\nThe interaction with these rigid obstacles transforms ram pressure of the flow\ninto thermal pressure through bow shocks, slowing down the flow and making the\naccreting gas turbulent. As a consequence, although the flow reaches a\nstatistically-steady state, the accretion rate presents some variability. For a\nflow Mach number at infinity of 4, a few of these objects (5 - 10) are enough\nto increase the accretion rate about 50% over the accretion rate without\nbodies, even though the gas is adiabatic and the filling factor of the\nobstacles is small.\n", "  The results of 8-year R-band photopolarimetric data of blazar Mrk 421\ncollected from February 2008 to May 2016 are presented, along with extensive\nmultiwavelength observations covering from radio to TeV $\\gamma$-rays around\nthe flares observed in May 2008, March 2010, and April 2013. The most important\nresults are found in 2013 when the source displayed in the R-band a very high\nbrightness state of $11.29\\pm 0.03$ mag ($93.60\\pm 1.53$ mJy) on April 10th and\na polarization degree of ($11.00\\pm0.44$) on May 13th. The analysis of the\noptical data shows that the polarization variability is due to the\nsuperposition of two polarized components that might be produced in two\ndistinct emitting regions. An intranight photopolarimetric variability study\ncarried out over 7 nights after the 2013 April maximum found flux and\npolarization variations on the nights of April 14, 15, 16 and 19. In addition,\nthe flux shows a minimum variability timescale of $\\Delta\\,t=$2.34$\\pm$0.12\nhours, and that the polarization degree presented variations of $\\sim$ (1 - 2)\nin a timescale of $\\Delta\\,t\\sim$ minutes. Also, a detailed analysis of the\nintranight data shows a coherence length of the large-scale magnetic field of\n$l_B\\simeq$ 0.3 pc which is the same order of magnitude to the distance\ntraveled by the relativistic shocks. This result suggests that there is a\nconnection between the intranight polarimetric variations and spatial changes\nof the magnetic field. Analysis of the complete R-band data along with the\nhistorical optical light curve found for this object shows that Mrk 421 varies\nwith a period of 16.26 $\\pm$ 1.78 years.\n", "  X-ray spectral timing analysis is presented of XMM-Newton observations of the\nnarrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy I Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1) taken in 2015 January. After\nexploring the effect of background flaring on timing analyses, X-ray time lags\nbetween the reflection-dominated 0.3-1.0keV energy and continuum-dominated\n1.0-4.0keV band are measured, indicative of reverberation off the inner\naccretion disc. The reverberation lag time is seen to vary as a step function\nin frequency; across lower frequency components of the variability, 3e-4 to\n1.2e-3Hz a lag of 160s is measured, but the lag shortens to (59 +/- 4)s above\n1.2e-3Hz. The lag-energy spectrum reveals differing profiles between these\nranges with a change in the dip showing the earliest arriving photons. The low\nfrequency signal indicates reverberation of X-rays emitted from a corona\nextended at low height over the disc while at high frequencies, variability is\ngenerated in a collimated core of the corona through which luminosity\nfluctuations propagate upwards. Principal component analysis of the variability\nsupports this interpretation, showing uncorrelated variation in the spectral\nslope of two power law continuum components. The distinct evolution of the two\ncomponents of the corona is seen as a flare passes inwards from the extended to\nthe collimated portion. An increase in variability in the extended corona was\nfound preceding the initial increase in X-ray flux. Variability from the\nextended corona was seen to die away as the flare passed into the collimated\ncore leading to a second sharper increase in the X-ray count rate.\n", "  Nonequilibrium dynamics of a nonintegrable system without the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis is studied. It is shown that, in the thermodynamic\nlimit, this model thermalizes after an arbitrary quantum quench at finite\ntemperature, although it does not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis. In contrast, when the system size is finite and the temperature is\nlow enough, the system may not thermalize. In this case, the steady state is\nwell described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble constructed by using highly\nnonlocal conserved quantities. We also show that this model exhibits\nprethermalization, in which the prethermalized state is characterized by\nnonthermal energy eigenstates.\n", "  Without access to the full quantum state, modeling dissipation in an open\nsystem requires approximations. The physical soundness of such approximations\nrelies on using realistic microscopic models of dissipation that satisfy\ncompletely positive dynamical maps. Here we present an approach based on the\nuse of the Bohmian conditional wave function that, by construction, ensures a\ncompletely positive dynamical map for either Markovian or non-Markovian\nscenarios, while allowing the implementation of realistic dissipation sources.\nOur approach is applied to compute the current-voltage characteristic of a\nresonant tunneling device with a parabolic-band structure, including\nelectron-lattice interactions. A stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved\nfor the conditional wave function of each simulated electron. We also extend\nour approach to (graphene-like) materials with a linear band-structure using\nBohmian conditional spinors for a stochastic Dirac equation.\n", "  The exceptional ability of carbon to form sp2 and sp3 bonding states leads to\na great structural and chemical diversity of carbon-bearing phases at\nnon-ambient conditions. Here we use laser-heated diamond anvil cells combined\nwith synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles\ncalculations to explore phase transitions in CaCO3 at P > 40 GPa. We find that\npost-aragonite CaCO3 transforms to the previously predicted P21/c-CaCO3 with\nsp3-hybridized carbon at 105 GPa (~30 GPa higher than the theoretically\npredicted crossover pressure). The lowest enthalpy transition path to\nP21/c-CaCO3 includes reoccurring sp2- and sp3-CaCO3 intermediate phases and\ntransition states, as reveled by our variable-cell nudged elastic band\nsimulation. Raman spectra of P21/c-CaCO3 show an intense band at 1025 cm-1,\nwhich we assign to the symmetric C-O stretching vibration based on empirical\nand first principles calculations. This Raman band has a frequency that is ~20\n% lower than the symmetric C-O stretching in sp2-CaCO3, due to the C-O bond\nlength increase across the sp2-sp3 transition, and can be used as a fingerprint\nof tetrahedrally-coordinated carbon in other carbonates.\n", "  Aims. The data set of the long-term XMM-Newton monitoring program of HD 81809\nis analyzed to study its X-ray cycle, to investigate if the latter is related\nto the chromospheric one, to infer the structure of the corona of HD 81809, and\nto explore if the coronal activity of HD 81809 can be ascribed to phenomena\nsimilar to the solar ones and, therefore, considered an extension of the solar\ncase. Methods. We analyze the observations of HD 81809 performed with\nXMM-Newton with a regular cadence of 6 months from 2001 to 2016 and\nrepresenting one of the longest available observational baseline ($\\sim 15$~yr)\nfor a solar-like star with a well-studied chromospheric cycle (with a period of\n$\\sim 8$~yr). We investigate the modulation of coronal luminosity and\ntemperature and its relation with the chromospheric cycle. We interpret the\ndata in terms of a mixture of solar-like coronal regions, adopting a\nmethodology originally proposed to study the Sun as an X-ray star. Results. The\nobservations show a well-defined regular cyclic modulation of the X-ray\nluminosity that reflects the activity level of HD 81809. The data covers\napproximately two cycles of coronal activity; the modulation has an amplitude\nof a factor of $\\sim 5$ (excluding evident flares, as in the June 2002\nobservation) and a period of $7.3\\pm 1.5$~yr, consistent with that of the\nchromospheric cycle. We demonstrate that the corona of HD 81809 can be\ninterpreted as an extension of the solar case and it can be modeled with a\nmixture of solar-like coronal regions along the whole cycle. The activity level\nis mainly determined by a varying coverage of very bright active regions,\nsimilar to cores of active regions observed in the Sun. Evidence of unresolved\nsignificant flaring activity is present especially in proximity of cycle\nmaxima.\n", "  We identify sources with extremely hard X-ray spectra (i.e., with photon\nindices of Gamma<0.6 in the 13 sq. deg. NuSTAR serendipitous survey, to search\nfor the most highly obscured AGNs detected at >10 keV. Eight extreme NuSTAR\nsources are identified, and we use the NuSTAR data in combination with lower\nenergy X-ray observations (from Chandra, Swift XRT, and XMM-Newton) to\ncharacterize the broad-band (0.5-24 keV) X-ray spectra. We find that all of the\nextreme sources are highly obscured AGNs, including three robust Compton-thick\n(CT; N_H > 1.5e24 cm^-2) AGNs at low redshift (z<0.1), and a likely-CT AGN at\nhigher redshift (z=0.16). Most of the extreme sources would not have been\nidentified as highly obscured based on the low energy (<10 keV) X-ray coverage\nalone. The multiwavelength properties (e.g., optical spectra and X-ray/MIR\nluminosity ratios) provide further support for the eight sources being\nsignificantly obscured. Correcting for absorption, the intrinsic rest-frame\n10-40 keV luminosities of the extreme sources cover a broad range, from ~ 5 x\n10^42 to 10^45 erg s^-1. The estimated number counts of CT AGNs in the NuSTAR\nserendipitous survey are in broad agreement with model expectations based on\nprevious X-ray surveys, except for the lowest redshifts (z<0.07) where we\nmeasure a high CT fraction of f_CT^obs = 30 (+16 -12) %. For the small sample\nof CT AGNs, we find a high fraction of galaxy major mergers (50 +/- 33%)\ncompared to control samples of \"normal\" AGNs.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of interstellar dust in the Universe by means of\nchemical evolution models of galaxies of different morphological types,\nreproducing the main observed features of present day galaxies. We adopt the\nmost updated prescriptions for dust production from supernovae and asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars as well as for dust accretion and destruction\nprocesses. Then, we study the cosmic dust rate in the framework of three\ndifferent cosmological scenarios for galaxy formation: i) a pure luminosity\nscenario (PLE), ii) a number density evolution scenario (DE), as suggested by\nthe classical hierarchical clustering scenario and iii) an alternative\nscenario, in which both spirals and ellipticals are allowed to evolve in number\non an observationally motivated basis. Our results give predictions about the\nevolution of the dust content in different galaxies as well as the cosmic dust\nrate as a function of redshift. Concerning the cosmic dust rate, the best\nscenario is the alternative one, which predicts a peak at 2 < z < 3 and\nreproduces the cosmic star formation rate. We compute the evolution of the\ncomoving dust density parameter {\\Omega} dust and find agreement with data for\nz < 0.5 in the framework of DE and alternative scenarios. Finally, the\nevolution of the average cosmic metallicity is presented and it shows a quite\nfast increase in each scenario, reaching the solar value at the present time,\nalthough most of the heavy elements are incorporated into solid grains, and\ntherefore not observable in the gas phase.\n", "  In this work we propose the modelling of static wormholes within the $f(R,T)$\nextended theory of gravity perspective. We present some models of wormholes,\nwhich are constructed from different hypothesis for their matter content, i.e.,\ndifferent relations for their pressure components (radial and lateral) and\ndifferent equations of state. The solutions obtained for the shape function of\nthe wormholes obey the necessary metric conditions. They show a behaviour\nsimilar to those found in previous references about wormholes, which also\nhappens to our solutions for the energy density of such objects. We also apply\nthe energy conditions for the wormholes physical content.\n", "  We present molecular gas mass estimates for a sample of 13 local galaxies\nwhose kinematic and star forming properties closely resemble those observed in\n$z\\approx 1.5$ main-sequence galaxies. Plateau de Bure observations of the\nCO[1-0] emission line and Herschel Space Observatory observations of the dust\nemission both suggest molecular gas mass fractions of ~20%. Moreover, dust\nemission modeling finds $T_{dust}<$30K, suggesting a cold dust distribution\ncompared to their high infrared luminosity. The gas mass estimates argue that\n$z\\sim$0.1 DYNAMO galaxies not only share similar kinematic properties with\nhigh-z disks, but they are also similarly rich in molecular material. Pairing\nthe gas mass fractions with existing kinematics reveals a linear relationship\nbetween $f_{gas}$ and $\\sigma$/$v_{c}$, consistent with predictions from\nstability theory of a self-gravitating disk. It thus follows that high gas\nvelocity dispersions are a natural consequence of large gas fractions. We also\nfind that the systems with lowest depletion times ($\\sim$0.5 Gyr) have the\nhighest ratios of $\\sigma$/$v_{c}$ and more pronounced clumps, even at the same\nhigh molecular gas fraction.\n", "  The recent discovery of potentially habitable exoplanets around Proxima\nCentauri and TRAPPIST-1 has attracted much attention due to their potential for\nhosting life. We delineate a simple model that accurately describes the\nevolution of biological diversity on Earth. Combining this model with\nconstraints on atmospheric erosion and the maximal evolutionary timescale\narising from the star's lifetime, we arrive at two striking conclusions: (i)\nEarth-analogs orbiting low-mass M-dwarfs are unlikely to be inhabited, and (ii)\nK-dwarfs and some G-type stars are potentially capable of hosting more complex\nbiospheres than the Earth. Hence, future searches for biosignatures may have\nhigher chances of success when targeting planets around K-type stars.\n", "  We present multi-wavelength radio observations obtained with the VLA of the\nprotoplanetary disk surrounding the young brown dwarf 2MASS J04442713+2512164\n(2M0444) in the Taurus star forming region. 2M0444 is the brightest known brown\ndwarf disk at millimeter wavelengths, making this an ideal target to probe\nradio emission from a young brown dwarf. Thermal emission from dust in the disk\nis detected at 6.8 and 9.1 mm, whereas the 1.36 cm measured flux is dominated\nby ionized gas emission. We combine these data with previous observations at\nshorter sub-mm and mm wavelengths to test the predictions of dust evolution\nmodels in gas-rich disks after adapting their parameters to the case of 2M0444.\nThese models show that the radial drift mechanism affecting solids in a gaseous\nenvironment has to be either completely made inefficient, or significantly\nslowed down by very strong gas pressure bumps in order to explain the presence\nof mm/cm-sized grains in the outer regions of the 2M0444 disk. We also discuss\nthe possible mechanisms for the origin of the ionized gas emission detected at\n1.36 cm. The inferred radio luminosity for this emission is in line with the\nrelation between radio and bolometric luminosity valid for for more massive and\nluminous young stellar objects, and extrapolated down to the very low\nluminosity of the 2M0444 brown dwarf.\n", "  We theoretically show that terahertz pulses with controlled amplitude and\nfrequency can be used to switch between stable transport modes in layered\nsuperconductors, modelled as stacks of Josephson junctions. We find pulse\nshapes that deterministically switch the transport mode between\nsuperconducting, resistive and solitonic states. We develop a simple model that\nexplains the switching mechanism as a destablization of the centre of mass\nexcitation of the Josephson phase, made possible by the highly non-linear\nnature of the light-matter coupling.\n", "  We study the properties of the dissipative accretion flow around rotating\nblack holes in presence of mass loss. We obtain the complete set of global\ninflow-outflow solutions in the steady state by solving the underlying\nconservation equations self-consistently. We observe that global inflow-outflow\nsolutions are not the isolated solution, instead such solutions are possible\nfor wide range of inflow parameters. Accordingly, we identify the boundary of\nthe parameter space for outflows, spanned by the angular momentum\n($\\lambda_{\\rm in}$) and the energy (${\\cal E}_{\\rm in}$) at the inner sonic\npoint ($x_{\\rm in}$), as function of the dissipation parameters and find that\nparameter space gradually shrinks with the increase of dissipation rates.\nFurther, we examine the properties of the outflow rate $R_{\\dot m}$ (defined as\nthe ratio of outflow to inflow mass flux) and ascertain that dissipative\nprocesses play the decisive role in determining the outflow rates. We calculate\nthe limits on the maximum outflow rate ($R_{\\dot{m}}^{\\rm max}$) in terms of\nviscosity parameter ($\\alpha$) as well as black hole spin ($a_k$) and obtain\nthe limiting range as $3\\% \\le R_{\\dot{m}}^{\\rm max} \\le 19\\%$. Moreover, we\ncalculate the viable range of $\\alpha$ that admits the coupled inflow-outflow\nsolutions and find that $\\alpha \\lesssim 0.25$ for $R_{\\dot m} \\ne 0$. Finally,\nwe discuss the observational implication of our formalism to infer the spin of\nthe black holes. Towards this, considering the highest observed QPO frequency\nof black hole source GRO J1655-40 ($\\sim 450$ Hz), we constrain the spin value\nof the source as $a_k \\ge 0.57$.\n", "  It is widely accepted that black holes (BHs) with masses greater than a\nmillion solar masses (Msun) lurk at the centres of massive galaxies. The\norigins of such `supermassive' black holes (SMBHs) remain unknown (Djorgovski\net al. 1999), while those of stellar-mass BHs are well-understood. One possible\nscenario is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which are formed by the\nrunaway coalescence of stars in young compact star clusters (Portagies Zwart et\nal. 1999), merge at the centre of a galaxy to form an SMBH (Ebisuzaki et al.\n2001). Although many candidates for IMBHs have been proposed to date, none of\nthem are accepted as definitive. Recently we discovered a peculiar molecular\ncloud, CO-0.40-0.22, with an extremely broad velocity width near the centre of\nour Milky Way galaxy. Based on the careful analysis of gas kinematics, we\nconcluded that a compact object with a mass of ~1E5 Msun is lurking in this\ncloud (Oka et al. 2016). Here we report the detection of a point-like continuum\nsource as well as a compact gas clump near the center of CO-0.40-0.22. This\npoint-like continuum source (CO-0.40-0.22*) has a wide-band spectrum consistent\nwith 1/500 of the Galactic SMBH (Sgr A*) in luminosity. Numerical simulations\naround a point-like massive object reproduce the kinematics of dense molecular\ngas well, which suggests that CO-0.40-0.22* is the most promising candidate for\nan intermediate-mass black hole.\n", "  We study the impact of the neutron star binaries' (NSBs) natal kick\ndistribution on the Galactic r-process enrichment. We model the growth of a\nMilky Way type halo based on N-body simulation results and its star formation\nhistory based on multi epoch abundance matching techniques. We consider the\nNSBs that merge well beyond the galaxy's effective radius ($>2\\times\nR_\\mathrm{eff}$) do not contribute to Galactic r-process enrichment. Assuming a\npower-law delay-time distribution (DTD) function ($\\propto t^{-1}$) with\n$t_\\mathrm{min}=30$ Myr for binaries' coalescence timescales, and an\nexponential profile for their natal kick distribution with an average value of\n180 km s$^{-1}$, we show that up to $\\sim$ 40% of all formed NSBs do not\ncontribute to r-process enrichment by $z=0$, either because they merge far from\nthe galaxy at a given redshift (up to $\\sim$ 25%) or have not yet merged by\ntoday ($\\sim$15%). Our result is largely insensitive to the details of the DTD\nfunction. Assuming a constant coalescence timescale of 100 Myr well\napproximates the adopted DTD with 30% of the NSBs not contributing to r-process\nenrichment. Our results, although rather dependent on the adopted natal kick\ndistribution, represent a first step towards estimating the impact of natal\nkicks and DTD functions on r-process enrichment of galaxies that would need to\nbe incorporated in the hydrodynamical simulations.\n", "  We present a new method to quantify the value of the escape fraction of\nionizing photons, and the existence of ultra-faint galaxies clustered around\nbrighter objects during the epoch of cosmic reionization, using the diffuse\nLy$\\alpha$, continuum and H$\\alpha$ emission observed around galaxies at\n$z\\sim6$. We model the surface brightness profiles of the diffuse halos\nconsidering the fluorescent emission powered by ionizing photons escaping from\nthe central galaxies, and the nebular emission from satellite star-forming\nsources, by extending the formalisms developed in Mas-Ribas & Dijkstra (2016)\nand Mas-Ribas et al. (2017). The comparison between our predicted profiles and\nLy$\\alpha$ observations at $z=5.7$ and $z=6.6$ favors a low ionizing escape\nfraction, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm ion}\\sim5\\%$, for galaxies in the range $-19\\gtrsim\nM_{\\rm UV} \\gtrsim -21.5$. However, uncertainties and possible systematics in\nthe observations do not allow for firm conclusions. We predict H$\\alpha$ and\nrest-frame visible continuum observations with JWST, and show that JWST will be\nable to detect extended (a few tens of kpc) fluorescent H$\\alpha$ emission\npowered by ionizing photons escaping from a bright, $L\\gtrsim 5L^*$, galaxy.\nSuch observations can differentiate fluorescent emission from nebular emission\nby satellite sources. We discuss how observations and stacking of several\nobjects may provide unique constraints on the escape fraction for faint\ngalaxies and/or the abundance of ultra-faint radiation sources.\n", "  We present a detailed spectral analysis of Type Iax SN 2011ay. Our spectra\ncover epochs between -3 and +19 days with respect to the maximum light in\nB-band. This time range allows us to employ a so-called abundance tomography\ntechnique. The synthetic spectral fitting was made with the 1D Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer code TARDIS. In this paper, we describe our method to fit\nmultiple epochs with a self-consistent, stratified atmospheric model. We\ncompare our results to previously published SYN++ models and the predictions of\ndifferent explosion scenarios. Using a fixed density profile (exponential fit\nof W7), we find that a uniform abundance model cannot reproduce the spectral\nfeatures before maximum light because of the emergence of excessively strong Fe\nlines. In our best-fit TARDIS model, we find an abundance profile that\nseparated into two different regimes: a well-mixed region under 10,000 km\ns$^{-1}$ and a stratified region with decreasing IGE abundances above 10,000 km\ns$^{-1}$. Based on a detailed comparative analysis, our conclusion is that the\navailable pure deflagration models cannot fully explain either the observed\nproperties of SN 2011ay or the results of our TARDIS modeling. Further\nexaminations are necessary to find an adequate explanation for the origin of\nthis object.\n", "  We present and make publicly available the second data release (DR2) of the\nKeck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorption toward Quasars (KODIAQ) survey.\nKODIAQ DR2 consists of a fully-reduced sample of 300 quasars at 0.07 < z_em <\n5.29 observed with HIRES at high resolution (36,000 <= R <= 103,000). DR2\ncontains 831 spectra available in continuum normalized form, representing a sum\ntotal exposure time of ~4.9 megaseconds on source. These co-added spectra arise\nfrom a total of 1577 individual exposures of quasars taken from the Keck\nObservatory Archive (KOA) in raw form and uniformly processed. DR2 extends DR1\nby adding 130 new quasars to the sample, including additional observations of\nQSOs in DR1. All new data in DR2 were obtained with the single-chip Tektronix\nTK2048 CCD configuration of HIRES in operation between 1995 and 2004. DR2 is\npublicly available to the community, housed as a higher level science product\nat the KOA and in the igmspec database (v03).\n", "  The Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), operating in Paranal since 2016,\nis a wide-field survey to detect Neptunes and super-Earths transiting bright\nstars, which are suitable for precise radial velocity follow-up and\ncharacterisation. Thereby, its sub-mmag photometric precision and ability to\nidentify false positives are crucial. Particularly, variable background objects\nblended in the photometric aperture frequently mimic Neptune-sized transits and\nare costly in follow-up time. These objects can best be identified with the\ncentroiding technique: if the photometric flux is lost off-centre during an\neclipse, the flux centroid shifts towards the centre of the target star.\nAlthough this method has successfully been employed by the Kepler mission, it\nhas previously not been implemented from the ground. We present a\nfully-automated centroid vetting algorithm developed for NGTS, enabled by our\nhigh-precision auto-guiding. Our method allows detecting centroid shifts with\nan average precision of 0.75 milli-pixel, and down to 0.25 milli-pixel for\nspecific targets, for a pixel size of 4.97 arcsec. The algorithm is now part of\nthe NGTS candidate vetting pipeline and automatically employed for all detected\nsignals. Further, we develop a joint Bayesian fitting model for all photometric\nand centroid data, allowing to disentangle which object (target or background)\nis causing the signal, and what its astrophysical parameters are. We\ndemonstrate our method on two NGTS objects of interest. These achievements make\nNGTS the first ground-based wide-field transit survey ever to successfully\napply the centroiding technique for automated candidate vetting, enabling the\nproduction of a robust candidate list before follow-up.\n", "  A new Statistical-likelihood Exo-Planetary Habitability Index (SEPHI) is\npresented. It has been developed to cover the current and future features\nrequired for a classification scheme disentangling whether any discovered\nexoplanet is potentially habitable compared with life on Earth. The SEPHI uses\nlikelihood functions to estimate the habitability potential. It is defined as\nthe geometric mean of four sub-indexes related with four comparison criteria:\nIs the planet telluric?; Does it have an atmosphere dense enough and a gravity\ncompatible with life?; Does it have liquid water on its surface?; Does it have\na magnetic field shielding its surface from harmful radiation and stellar\nwinds?. Only with seven physical characteristics, can the SEPHI be estimated:\nPlanetary mass, radius, and orbital period; stellar mass, radius, and effective\ntemperature; planetary system age. We have applied the SEPHI to all the planets\nin the Exoplanet Encyclopaedia using a Monte Carlo Method. Kepler-1229 b,\nKepler-186 f, and Kepler-442 b have the largest SEPHI values assuming certain\nphysical descriptions. Kepler-1229 b is the most unexpected planet in this\nprivileged position since no previous study pointed to this planet as a\npotentially interesting and habitable one. In addition, most of the tidally\nlocked Earth-like planets present a weak magnetic field, incompatible with\nhabitability potential. We must stress that our results are linked to the\nphysics used in this study. Any change in the physics used only implies an\nupdating of the likelihood functions. We have developed a web application\nallowing the on-line estimation of the SEPHI: http://sephi.azurewebsites.net/\n", "  The population of close-in super-Earths, with gas mass fractions of up to 10%\nrepresents a challenge for planet formation theory: how did they avoid runaway\ngas accretion and collapsing to hot Jupiters despite their core masses being in\nthe critical range of $M_\\mathrm{c} \\simeq 10 M_\\mathrm{\\oplus}$? Previous\nthree-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of\nlow-mass planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc,\ncontrary to what is assumed in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is\nreferred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this Paper we investigate the\nrecycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic 3D\nradiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the\nevolution of the entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D\natmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses\nentropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high entropy gas from the\ndisc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction,\npotentially arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction.\nRecycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous\nstudies. However, we also identify an \"inner core\" -- in size $\\approx$ 25% of\nthe Bondi radius -- where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much\nlower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are\nneeded to assess whether this region can become hydrodynamically-isolated on\nlong time-scales.\n", "  We present new Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of CO(2-1) outflows\ntoward young, embedded protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud as part of the\nMass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA (MASSES)\nsurvey. For 57 Perseus protostars, we characterize the orientation of the\noutflow angles and compare them with the orientation of the local filaments as\nderived from $Herschel$ observations. We find that the relative angles between\noutflows and filaments are inconsistent with purely parallel or purely\nperpendicular distributions. Instead, the observed distribution of\noutflow-filament angles are more consistent with either randomly aligned angles\nor a mix of projected parallel and perpendicular angles. A mix of parallel and\nperpendicular angles requires perpendicular alignment to be more common by a\nfactor of $\\sim$3. Our results show that the observed distributions probably\nhold regardless of the protostar's multiplicity, age, or the host core's\nopacity. These observations indicate that the angular momentum axis of a\nprotostar may be independent of the large-scale structure. We discuss the\nsignificance of independent protostellar rotation axes in the general picture\nof filament-based star formation.\n", "  We observed the $J=5-4$ rotational lines of the normal species and three\n$^{13}$C isotopologues of HC$_{3}$N at the 45 GHz band toward two low-mass\nstarless cores, L1521B and L134N (L183), using the Nobeyama 45 m radio\ntelescope in order to study the main formation pathways of HC$_{3}$N in each\ncore. The abundance ratios of the three $^{13}$C isotopologues in L1521B are\nderived to be [H$^{13}$CCCN]:[HC$^{13}$CCN]:[HCC$^{13}$CN] = 0.98 (+- 0.14) :\n1.00 : 1.52 (+- 0.16) (1 sigma). The fractionation pattern is consistent with\nthat at the cyanopolyyne peak in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1. This fractionation\npattern suggests that the main formation pathway of HC$_{3}$N is the\nneutral-neutral reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and CN. On the other hand,\ntheir abundance ratios in L134N are found to be\n[H$^{13}$CCCN]:[HC$^{13}$CCN]:[HCC$^{13}$CN]= 1.5 (+- 0.2) : 1.0 : 2.1 (+- 0.4)\n(1 sigma), which are different from those in L1521B. From this fractionation\npattern, we propose that the reaction between HNC and CCH is a possible main\nformation pathway of HC$_{3}$N in L134N. We find out that the main formation\npathways of the same molecule are not common even in the similar physical\nconditions. We discuss the possible factors to make a difference in\nfractionation pattern between L134N and L1521B/TMC-1.\n", "  We study the chemical abundances of a wide sample of 142 Galactic planetary\nnebulae (PNe) with good quality observations, for which the abundances have\nbeen derived more or less homogeneously, thus allowing a reasonable comparison\nwith stellar models. The goal is the determination of mass, chemical\ncomposition and formation epoch of their progenitors, through comparison of the\ndata with results from AGB evolution. The dust properties of PNe, when\navailable, were also used to further support our interpretation.\n  We find that the majority ($\\sim60\\%$) of the Galactic PNe studied has nearly\nsolar chemical composition, while $\\sim40\\%$ of the sources investigated have\nsub-solar metallicities. About half of the PNe have carbon star progenitors, in\nthe $1.5~M_{\\odot} < M < 3~M_{\\odot}$ mass range, which have formed between 300\nMyr and 2 Gyr ago. The remaining PNe are almost equally distributed among PNe\nenriched in nitrogen, which we interpret as the progeny of $M > 3.5~M_{\\odot}$\nstars, younger than 250 Myr, and a group of oxygen-rich PNe, descending from\nold ($> 2$ Gyr) low-mass ($M < 1.5~M_{\\odot}$) stars that never became C-stars.\n  This analysis confirms the existence of an upper limit to the amount of\ncarbon which can be accumulated at the surface of carbon stars, probably due to\nthe acceleration of mass loss in the late AGB phases. The chemical composition\nof the present sample suggests that in massive AGB stars of solar (or slightly\nsub-solar) metallicity, the effects of third dredge up combine with hot bottom\nburning, resulting in nitrogen-rich - but not severely carbon depleted -\ngaseous material to be ejected.\n", "  The Magellanic Bridge (MB) is a gaseous stream that links the Large (LMC) and\nSmall (SMC) Magellanic Clouds. Current simulations suggest that the MB forms\nfrom a recent interaction between the Clouds. In this scenario, the MB should\nalso have an associated stellar bridge formed by stars tidally stripped from\nthe SMC by the LMC. There are several observational evidences for these\nstripped stars, from the presence of intermediate age populations in the MB and\ncarbon stars, to the recent observation of an over-density of RR Lyrae stars\noffset from the MB. However, spectroscopic confirmation of stripped stars in\nthe MB remains lacking. In this paper, we use medium resolution spectra to\nderive the radial velocities and metallicities of stars in two fields along the\nMB. We show from both their chemistry and kinematics that the bulk of these\nstars must have been tidally stripped from the SMC. This is the first\nspectroscopic evidence for a dwarf galaxy being tidally stripped by a larger\ndwarf.\n", "  In this work we investigate the thermal structure of an off-limb active\nregion in various non-flaring areas, as it provides key information on the way\nthese structures are heated. In particular, we concentrate in the very hot\ncomponent (>3 MK) as it is a crucial element to discriminate between different\nheating mechanisms. We present an analysis using Fe and Ca emission lines from\nboth SOHO/SUMER and HINODE/EIS. A dataset covering all ionization stages from\nFe X to Fe XIX has been used for the thermal analysis (both DEM and EM). Ca XIV\nis used for the SUMER-EIS radiometric cross-calibration.\n  We show how the very hot plasma is present and persistent almost everywhere\nin the core of the limb AR. The off-limb AR is clearly structured in Fe XVIII.\nAlmost everywhere, the EM analysis reveals plasma at 10 MK (visible in Fe XIX\nemission) which is down to 0.1% of EM of the main 3 MK plasma. We estimate the\npower law index of the hot tail of the EM to be between -8.5 and -4.4. However,\nwe leave an open question on the possible existence of a small minor peak at\naround 10 MK. The absence in some part of the AR of Fe XIX and Fe XXIII lines\n(which fall into our spectral range) enables us to determine an upper limit on\nthe EM at such temperatures. Our results include a new Ca XIV 943.59 \\AA~\natomic model.\n", "  We present an activity and kinematic analysis of high proper motion white\ndwarf-M dwarf binaries (WD+dMs) found in the SUPERBLINK survey, 178 of which\nare new identifications. To identify WD+dMs, we developed a UV-optical-IR color\ncriterion and conducted a spectroscopic survey to confirm each candidate\nbinary. For the newly identified systems, we fit the two components using model\nwhite dwarf spectra and M dwarf template spectra to determine physical\nparameters. We use H$\\alpha$ chromospheric emission to examine the magnetic\nactivity of the M dwarf in each system, and investigate how its activity is\naffected by the presence of a white dwarf companion. We find that the fraction\nof WD+dM binaries with active M dwarfs is significantly higher than their\nsingle M dwarf counterparts at early and mid spectral types. We corroborate\nprevious studies that find high activity fractions at both close and\nintermediate separations. At more distant separations the binary fraction\nappears to approach the activity fraction for single M dwarfs. Using derived\nradial velocities and the proper motions, we calculate 3D space velocities for\nthe WD+dMs in SUPERBLINK. For the entire SUPERBLINK WD+dMs, we find a large\nvertical velocity dispersion, indicating a dynamically hotter population\ncompared to high proper motion samples of single M dwarfs. We compare the\nkinematics for systems with active M dwarfs and those with inactive M dwarfs,\nand find signatures of asymmetric drift in the inactive sample, indicating that\nthey are drawn from an older population.\n", "  Based on a multi-scale calculations, combining ab-initio methods with spin\ndynamics simulations, we perform a detailed study of the magnetic behavior of\nNi2MnAl/Fe bilayers. Our simulations show that such a bilayer exhibits a small\nexchange bias effect when the Ni2MnAl Heusler alloy is in a disordered B2\nphase. Additionally, we present an effective way to control the magnetic\nstructure of the Ni2MnAl antiferromagnet, in the pseudo-ordered B2-I as well as\nthe disordered B2 phases, via a spin-flop coupling to the Fe layer.\n", "  In the classical theory of thin disc accretion discs, the constraints of mass\nand angular momentum conservation lead to a diffusion-like equation for the\nturbulent evolution of the surface density. Here, we revisit this problem,\nextending the Newtonian analysis to the regime of Kerr geometry relevant to\nblack holes. A diffusion-like equation once again emerges, but now with a\nsingularity at the radius at which the effective angular momentum gradient\npasses through zero. The equation may be analysed using a combination of WKB,\nlocal techniques, and matched asymptotic expansions. It is shown that imposing\nthe boundary condition of a vanishing stress tensor (more precisely the\nradial-azimuthal component thereof) allows smooth stable modes to exist\nexternal to the angular momentum singularity, the innermost stable circular\norbit, while smoothly vanishing inside this location. The extension of the disc\ndiffusion equation to the domain of general relativity introduces a new tool\nfor numerical and phenomenolgical studies of accretion discs, and may prove to\nbe a useful technique for understanding black hole X-ray transients.\n", "  The migration of planets on nearly circular, non-inclined orbits in\nprotoplanetary discs is entirely described by the disc's torque. This torque is\na complex function of the disc parameters, and essentially amounts to the sum\nof two components: the Lindblad torque and the corotation torque. Known torque\nformulae do not reproduce accurately the torque actually experienced in\nnumerical simulations by low- and intermediate- mass planets in radiative\ndiscs. One of the main reasons for this inaccuracy is that these formulae have\nbeen worked out in two-dimensional analyses. Here we revisit the torque formula\nand update many of its dimensionless coefficients by means of tailored, three-\ndimensional numerical simulations. In particular, we derive the dependence of\nthe Lindblad torque on the temperature gradient, the dependence of the\ncorotation torque on the radial entropy gradient (and work out a suitable\nexpression of this gradient in a three-dimensional disc). We also work out the\ndependence of the corotation torque on the radial temperature gradient,\noverlooked so far. Corotation torques are known to scale very steeply with the\nwidth of the horseshoe region. We extend the expression of this width to the\ndomain of intermediate mass planets, so that our updated torque formula remains\nvalid for planets up to typically several tens of Earth masses, provided these\nrelatively massive planets do not significantly deplete their coorbital region.\nOur torque expression can be applied to low- and intermediate-mass planets in\noptically thick protoplanetary discs, as well as protomoons embedded in\ncircumplanetary discs.\n", "  The localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 121102,\nsuggests that it is associated with a persistent radio-luminous compact source\nin the FRB host galaxy. Using the FIRST radio catalog, I present a search for\nluminous persistent sources in nearby galaxies, with radio luminosities >10% of\nthe FRB 121102 persistent source luminosity. The galaxy sample contains about\n30% of the total galaxy g-band luminosity within <108 Mpc, in a footprint of\n10,600 deg^2. After rejecting sources likely due to active galactic nuclei\nactivity or background sources, I remain with 11 candidates that are presumably\nassociated with galactic disks or star formation regions. At least some of\nthese candidates are likely to be due to chance alignment. In addition, I find\n85 sources within 1\" of galactic nuclei. Assuming the radio persistent sources\nare not related to galactic nuclei and that they follow the galaxy g-band\nlight, the 11 sources imply a 95% confidence upper limit on the space density\nof luminous persistent sources of <5x10^-5 Mpc^-3, and that at any given time\nonly a small fraction of galaxies host a radio luminous persistent source\n(<10^-3 L_*^-1). Assuming persistent sources life time of 100 yr, this implies\na birth rate of <5x10^-7 yr^-1 Mpc^-3. Given the FRB volumetric rate, and\nassuming that all FRBs repeat and are associated with persistent radio sources,\nthis sets a lower limit on the rate of FRB events per persistent source of >0.8\nyr^-1. I argue that these 11 candidates are good targets for FRB searches and I\nestimate the FRB event rate from these candidates.\n", "  Non-Gaussianity generated in inflation can be contributed by two parts. The\nfirst part, denoted by $f_{NL}^{\\delta N}$, is the contribution from four-point\ncorrelation of inflaton field which can be calculated using $\\delta N$\nformalism, and the second part, denoted by $f_{NL}^{int}$, is the contribution\nfrom the three-point correlation function of the inflaton field. We consider\nthe two contributions to the non-Gaussianity in noncanonical warm inflation\nthroughout (noncanonical warm inflation is a new inflationary model which is\nproposed in \\cite{Zhang2014}). We find the two contributions are complementary\nto each other. The four-point correlation contribution to the non-Gaussianity\nis overwhelmed by the three-point one in strong noncanonical limit, while the\nconclusion is opposite in the canonical case. We also discuss the influence of\nthe field redefinition, thermal dissipative effect and noncanonical effect to\nthe non-Gaussianity in noncanonical warm inflation.\n", "  We report the results of a pilot program to use the Magellan/M2FS\nspectrograph to survey the galactic populations and internal kinematics of\ngalaxy clusters. For this initial study, we present spectroscopic measurements\nfor $223$ quiescent galaxies observed along the line of sight to the galaxy\ncluster Abell 267 ($z\\sim0.23$). We develop a Bayesian method for modeling the\nintegrated light from each galaxy as a simple stellar population, with free\nparameters that specify redshift ($v_\\mathrm{los}/c$) and characteristic age,\nmetallicity ($\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$), alpha-abundance ($[\\alpha/\\mathrm{Fe}]$), and\ninternal velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_\\mathrm{int}$) for individual galaxies.\nParameter estimates derived from our 1.5-hour observation of A267 have median\nrandom errors of $\\sigma_{v_\\mathrm{los}}=20\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}}$,\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Age}}=1.2\\ \\mathrm{Gyr}$, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}}=0.11\\\n\\mathrm{dex}$, $\\sigma_{[\\alpha/\\mathrm{Fe}]}=0.07\\ \\mathrm{dex}$, and\n$\\sigma_{\\sigma_\\mathrm{int}}=20\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}}$. In a companion paper,\nwe use these results to model the structure and internal kinematics of A267.\n", "  We present a sample of 1148 ab-type RR Lyrae (RRLab) variables identified\nfrom Catalina Surveys Data Release 1, combined with SDSS DR8 and LAMOST DR4\nspectral data. We firstly use a large sample of 860 Galactic halo RRLab stars\nand derive the circular velocity distributions for the stellar halo. With the\nprecise distances and carefully determined radial velocities (the\ncenter-of-mass radial velocities) by considering the pulsation of the RRLab\nstars in our sample, we can obtain a reliable and comparable stellar halo\ncircular velocity curve. We take two different prescriptions for the velocity\nanisotropy parameter {\\beta} in the Jeans equation to study the circular\nvelocity curve and mass profile. We test two different solar peculiar motions\nin our calculation. Our best result with the adopted solar peculiar motion 1 of\n(U, V, W) = (11.1, 12, 7.2) km/s is that the enclosed mass of the Milky Way\nwithin 50 kpc is (3.75 +/- 1.33) *10^11Msun based on \\beta = 0 and the circular\nvelocity 180 +/- 31.92 (km/s) at 50 kpc. This result is consistent with\ndynamical model results, and it is also comparable to the previous similar\nworks.\n", "  We present the result of our spectroscopic follow-up observation for faint\nquasar candidates at z~5 in a part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy\nSurvey wide field. We select nine photometric candidates and identify three z~5\nfaint quasars, one z~4 faint quasar, and a late-type star. Since two faint\nquasar spectra show Civ emission line without suffering from a heavy\natmospheric absorption, we estimate the black hole mass (M$_{BH}$) and\nEddington ratio (L/L$_{Edd}$) of them. The inferred log M$_{BH}$ are\n9.04+/-0.14 and 8.53+/-0.20, respectively. In addition, the inferred log\n(L/L$_{Edd}$) are -1.00+/-0.15 and -0.42+/-0.22, respectively. If we adopt that\nL/L$_{Edd}$= constant or $\\propto$ (1+z)^2, the seed black hole masses\n(M$_{seed}$) of our z~5 faint quasars are expected to be >10^5 M$_\\odot$ in\nmost cases. We also compare the observational results with a mass accretion\nmodel where angular momentum is lost due to supernova explosions (Kawakatu &\nWada 2008). Accordingly, M$_{BH}$ of the z~5 faint quasars in our sample can be\nexplained even if M$_{seed}$ is ~10^3M$_\\odot$. Since z~6 luminous qusars and\nour z~5 faint quasars are not on the same evolutionary track, z~6 luminous\nquasars and our z~5 quasars are not the same populations but different\npopulations, due to the difference of a period of the mass supply from host\ngalaxies. Furthermore, we confirm that one can explain M$_{BH}$ of z~6 luminous\nquasars and our z~5 faint quasars even if their seed black holes of them are\nformed at z~7.\n", "  The standard disk is often inadequate to model disk-dominated cataclysmic\nvariables (CVs) and generates a spectrum that is bluer than the observed UV\nspectra [Puebla et al 2007]. X-ray observations of these systems reveal an\noptically thin boundary layer (BL) expected to appear as an inner hole in the\ndisk. Consequently, we truncate the inner disk. However, instead of removing\nthe inner disk, we impose the no-shear boundary condition at the truncation\nradius, thereby lowering the disk temperature and generating a spectrum that\nbetter fits the UV data. With our modified disk, we analyze the archival UV\nspectra of three novalikes that cannot be fitted with standard disks. For the\nVY Scl systems MV Lyr and BZ Cam, we fit a hot inflated white dwarf WD with a\ncold modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim $ a few $10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr). For V592 Cas,\nthe slightly modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr)\ncompletely dominates the UV. These results are consistent with Swift X-ray\nobservations of these systems [Balman et al 2014], revealing BLs merged with\nADAF-like flows and/or hot coronae, where the advection of energy is likely\nlaunching an outflow and heating the WD, thereby explaining the high WD\ntemperature in VY Scl systems. This is further supported by the fact that the\nX-ray hardness ratio increases with the shallowness of the UV slope in a small\nCV sample we examine. Furthermore, for 105 disk-dominated systems, the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra UV slope decreases in the same\norder as the ratio of the X-ray flux to optical/UV flux: from SU UMa's, to U\nGem's, Z Cam's, UX UMa's, and VY Scl's.\n", "  Photospheric velocities and stellar activity features such as spots and\nfaculae produce measurable radial velocity signals that currently obscure the\ndetection of sub-meter-per-second planetary signals. However, photospheric\nvelocities are imprinted differently in a high-resolution spectrum than\nKeplerian Doppler shifts. Photospheric activity produces subtle differences in\nthe shapes of absorption lines due to differences in how temperature or\npressure affects the atomic transitions. In contrast, Keplerian Doppler shifts\naffect every spectral line in the same way. With high enough S/N and high\nenough resolution, statistical techniques can exploit differences in spectra to\ndisentangle the photospheric velocities and detect lower-amplitude exoplanet\nsignals. We use simulated disk-integrated time-series spectra and principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) to show that photospheric signals introduce spectral\nline variability that is distinct from Doppler shifts. We quantify the impact\nof instrumental resolution and S/N for this work.\n", "  We present the results from 1.5 and 5 GHz phase-referenced VLBA and 1.5 GHz\nKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy\nKISSR1219, which exhibits double peaked emission lines in its optical spectrum.\nThe VLA and VLBA data reveal a one-sided core-jet structure at roughly the same\nposition angles, providing evidence of an AGN outflow. The absence of dual\nparsec-scale radio cores puts the binary black hole picture in doubt for the\ncase of KISSR1219. The high brightness temperatures of the parsec-scale core\nand jet components ($>10^6$ K) are consistent with this interpretation. Doppler\nboosting with jet speeds of $\\gtrsim0.55c$ to $\\gtrsim0.25c$, going from\nparsec- to kpc-scales, at a jet inclination $\\gtrsim50^\\circ$ can explain the\njet one-sidedness in this Seyfert 2 galaxy. A blue-shifted broad emission line\ncomponent in [O {\\sc iii}] is also indicative of an outflow in the emission\nline gas at a velocity of $\\sim350$ km s$^{-1}$, while the [O {\\sc i}] doublet\nlines suggest the presence of shock-heated gas. A detailed line ratio study\nusing the MAPPINGS III code further suggests that a shock+precursor model can\nexplain the line ionization data well. Overall, our data suggest that the radio\noutflow in KISSR1219 is pushing the emission line clouds, both ahead of the jet\nand in a lateral direction, giving rise to the double peak emission line\nspectra.\n", "  High-energy gamma rays of interstellar origin are produced by the interaction\nof cosmic-ray (CR) particles with the diffuse gas and radiation fields in the\nGalaxy. The main features of this emission are well understood and are\nreproduced by existing CR propagation models employing 2D Galactocentric\ncylindrically symmetrical geometry. However, the high-quality data from\ninstruments like the Fermi Large Area Telescope reveal significant deviations\nfrom the model predictions on few to tens of degree scales indicating the need\nto include the details of the Galactic spiral structure and thus require 3D\nspatial modelling. In this paper the high-energy interstellar emissions from\nthe Galaxy are calculated using the new release of the GALPROP code employing\n3D spatial models for the CR source and interstellar radiation field (ISRF)\ndensities. Three models for the spatial distribution of CR sources are used\nthat are differentiated by their relative proportion of input luminosity\nattributed to the smooth disc or spiral arms. Two ISRF models are developed\nbased on stellar and dust spatial density distributions taken from the\nliterature that reproduce local near- to far-infrared observations. The\ninterstellar emission models that include arms and bulges for the CR source and\nISRF densities provide plausible physical interpretations for features found in\nthe residual maps from high-energy gamma-ray data analysis. The 3D models for\nCR and ISRF densities provide a more realistic basis that can be used for the\ninterpretation of the non-thermal interstellar emissions from the Galaxy.\n", "  Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) parallax data are used to determine\nabsolute magnitudes $M_V$ for 318 W~UMa-type (EW) contact binary stars. A very\nsteep (slope $\\simeq -9$), single-parameter ($\\log{P}$), linear calibration can\nbe used to predict $M_V$ to about 0.1 -- 0.3 mag over the whole range of\naccessible orbital period, $0.22\\!<\\!P\\!<\\!0.88$ days. A similar calibration\nfor the most common systems with $0.275\\!<\\!P\\!<\\!0.575$ days predicts $M_V$\nvalues to about 0.06 -- 0.16 mag. For orbital period values both shorter and\nlonger than the central range, the period dependence is respectively steeper\nand shallower, i.e.\\ the binaries are fainter in $M_V$ than predicted by the\nwhole-range, linear law. The steepness of the relation for short-period systems\nimplies important consequences for the detectability of the faintest binaries\ndefining the short-period cut-off of the period distribution. Although the\nscatter around the linear $\\log{P}$-fit is fairly large (0.2 -- 0.4 mag), the\ncurrent data do not support the inclusion of a $B\\!-\\!V$ color term in the\ncalibration.\n", "  We present a spectral analysis of the UV-bright star Y453 in M4. Model fits\nto the star's optical spectrum yield T_eff ~ 56,000 K. Fits to the star's FUV\nspectrum, obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board the\nHubble Space Telescope, reveal it to be considerably hotter, with T_eff ~\n72,000 K. We adopt T_eff = 72,000 +/- 2000 K and log g = 5.7 +/- 0.2 as our\nbest-fit parameters. Scaling the model spectrum to match the star's optical and\nnear-infrared magnitudes, we derive a mass M_* = 0.53 +/- 0.24 M_sun and\nluminosity log L/L_sun = 2.84 +/- 0.05, consistent with the values expected of\nan evolved star in a globular cluster. Comparing the star with post-horizontal\nbranch evolutionary tracks, we conclude that it most likely evolved from the\nblue horizontal branch, departing the AGB before third dredge-up. It should\nthus exhibit the abundance pattern (O-poor and Na-rich) characteristic of the\nsecond-generation (SG) stars in M4. We derive the star's photospheric\nabundances of He, C, N, O, Si, S, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni. CNO abundances are\nroughly 0.25 dex greater than those of the cluster's SG stars, while the Si and\nS abundances agree match the cluster values. Abundances of the iron-peak\nelements (except for iron itself) are enhanced by 1 to 3 dex. Rather than\nrevealing the star's origin and evolution, this pattern reflects the combined\neffects of diffusive and mechanical processes in the stellar atmosphere.\n", "  Of the 30 or so Galactic magnetars, about 8 are in supernova remnants (SNRs).\nOne of the most extreme magnetars, 1E 1841-045, is at the center of the SNR Kes\n73 (G27.4+0.0), whose age is uncertain. We measure its expansion using three\nChandra observations over 15 yr, obtaining a mean rate of 0.023% +/- 0.002% per\nyr. For a distance of 8.5 kpc, we obtain a shell velocity of 1100 km/s and\ninfer a blast-wave speed of 1400 km/s. For Sedov expansion into a uniform\nmedium, this gives an age of 1800 yr. Derived emission measures imply an\nambient density of about 2 cm$^{-3}$ and an upper limit on the swept-up mass of\nabout 70 solar masses, with lower limits of tens of solar masses, confirming\nthat Kes 73 is in an advanced evolutionary stage. Our spectral analysis shows\nno evidence for enhanced abundances as would be expected from a massive\nprogenitor. Our derived total energy is $1.9 \\times 10^{51}$ erg, giving a very\nconservative lower limit to the magnetar's initial period of about 3 ms, unless\nits energy was lost by non-electromagnetic means. We see no evidence of a\nwind-blown bubble as would be produced by a massive progenitor, or any evidence\nthat the progenitor of Kes 73/1E 1841-045 was anything but a normal red\nsupergiant producing a Type IIP supernova, though a short-lived\nstripped-envelope progenitor cannot be absolutely excluded. Kes 73's magnetar\nthus joins SGR 1900+14 as magnetars resulting from relatively low-mass\nprogenitors.\n", "  We present a high-precision timing analysis of PSR J1933$-$6211, a\nmillisecond pulsar (MSP) with a 3.5-ms spin period and a white dwarf (WD)\ncompanion, using data from the Parkes radio telescope. Since we have accurately\nmeasured the polarization properties of this pulsar we have applied the matrix\ntemplate matching approach in which the times of arrival are measured using\nfull polarimetric information. We achieved a weighted root-mean-square timing\nresiduals (rms) of the timing residuals of 1.23 $\\rm \\mu s$, 15.5$\\%$\nimprovement compared to the total intensity timing analysis. After studying the\nscintillation properties of this pulsar we put constraints on the inclination\nangle of the system. Based on these measurements and on $\\chi^2$ mapping we put\na 2-$\\sigma$ upper limit on the companion mass (0.44 M$_\\odot$). Since this\nmass limit cannot reveal the nature of the companion we further investigate the\npossibility of the companion to be a He WD. Applying the orbital period-mass\nrelation for such WDs, we conclude that the mass of a He WD companion would be\nabout 0.26$\\pm$0.01 M$_\\odot$ which, combined with the measured mass function\nand orbital inclination limits, would lead to a light pulsar mass $\\leqslant$\n1.0 M$_\\odot$. This result seems unlikely based on current neutron star\nformation models and we therefore conclude that PSR J1933$-$6211 most likely\nhas a CO WD companion, which allows for a solution with a more massive pulsar.\n", "  The relative orientation between filamentary structures in molecular clouds\nand the ambient magnetic field provides insight into filament formation and\nstability. To calculate the relative orientation, a measurement of filament\norientation is first required. We propose a new method to calculate the\norientation of the one pixel wide filament skeleton that is output by filament\nidentification algorithms such as \\textsc{filfinder}. We derive the local\nfilament orientation from the direction of the intensity gradient in the\nskeleton image using the Sobel filter and a few simple post-processing steps.\nWe call this the `Sobel-gradient method'. The resulting filament orientation\nmap can be compared quantitatively on a local scale with the magnetic field\norientation map to then find the relative orientation of the filament with\nrespect to the magnetic field at each point along the filament. It can also be\nused in constructing radial profiles for filament width fitting. The proposed\nmethod facilitates automation in analysis of filament skeletons, which is\nimperative in this era of `big data'.\n", "  The goal of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is to provide spatially\nresolved images of Sgr A*, the source associated with the Galactic Center black\nhole. Because Sgr A* varies on timescales short compared to an EHT observing\ncampaign, it is interesting to ask whether variability contains information\nabout the structure and dynamics of the accretion flow. In this paper, we\nintroduce \"time-domain filtering\", a technique to filter time fluctuating\nimages with specific temporal frequency ranges, and demonstrate the power and\nusage of the technique by applying it to mock millimeter wavelength images of\nSgr A*. The mock image data is generated from General Relativistic\nMagnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation and general relativistic ray-tracing\nmethod. We show that the variability on each line of sight is tightly\ncorrelated with a typical radius of emission. This is because disk emissivity\nfluctuates on a timescale of order the local orbital period. Time-domain\nfiltered images therefore reflect the model dependent emission radius\ndistribution, which is not accessible in time-averaged images. We show that, in\nprinciple, filtered data have the power to distinguish between models with\ndifferent black hole spins, different disk viewing angles, and different disk\norientations in the sky.\n", "  X-ray observations show that galaxy clusters have a very large range of\nmorphologies. The most disturbed systems which are good to study how clusters\nform and grow and to test physical models, may potentially complicate\ncosmological studies because the cluster mass determination becomes more\nchallenging. Thus, we need to understand the cluster properties of our samples\nto reduce possible biases. This is complicated by the fact that different\nexperiments may detect different cluster populations. For example, SZ selected\ncluster samples have been found to include a greater fraction of disturbed\nsystems than X-ray selected samples. In this paper we determined eight\nmorphological parameters for the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zeldovich (ESZ) objects\nobserved with XMM-Newton. We found that two parameters, concentration and\ncentroid-shift, are the best to distinguish between relaxed and disturbed\nsystems. For each parameter we provide the values that allow one to select the\nmost relaxed or most disturbed objects from a sample. We found that there is no\nmass dependence on the cluster dynamical state. By comparing our results with\nwhat was obtained with REXCESS clusters, we also confirm that indeed the ESZ\nclusters tend to be more disturbed, as found by previous studies.\n", "  We report on the detection of three strong HI absorbers originating in the\noutskirts (i.e., impact parameter, $\\rho_{\\rm cl} \\approx (1.6-4.7) r_{500}$)\nof three massive ($M_{500}\\sim3\\times10^{14} M_{\\odot}$) clusters of galaxies\nat redshift $z_{\\rm cl} \\approx 0.46$, in the $Hubble Space Telescope$ Cosmic\nOrigins Spectrograph ($HST$/COS) spectra of 3 background UV-bright quasars.\nThese clusters were discovered by the 2500 deg$^2$ South Pole Telescope\nSunyaev$-$Zel'dovich (SZ) effect survey. All three COS spectra show partial\nLyman limit absorber with $N(HI) > 10^{16.5} \\ \\rm cm^{-2}$ near the\nphotometric redshifts ($|\\Delta z/(1+z)| \\approx 0.03$) of the clusters. The\ncompound probability of random occurrence of all three absorbers is $<0.02$%,\nindicating that the absorbers are most likely related to the targeted clusters.\nWe find that the outskirts of these SZ-selected clusters are remarkably rich in\ncool gas compared to existing observations of other clusters in the literature.\nThe effective Doppler parameters of the Lyman series lines, obtained using\nsingle cloud curve-of-growth (COG) analysis, suggest a non-thermal/turbulent\nvelocity of a few $\\times10 \\ \\rm km s^{-1}$ in the absorbing gas. We emphasize\nthe need for uniform galaxy surveys around these fields and for more UV\nobservations of QSO-cluster pairs in general in order to improve the statistics\nand gain further insights into the unexplored territory of the largest\ncollapsed cosmic structures.\n", "  We have compiled a sample of 26 metal-poor galaxies with 12 + log(O/H) < 8.1\nwith both infrared continuum and 1.4 GHz radio continuum data. By comparing to\ngalaxies at higher metallicity, we have investigated the dependence on the\nmetallicity of the IR-radio relationship at 24 um, 70 um, 100 um and 160 um\nbands as well as the integrated FIR luminosity. It is found that metal-poor\ngalaxies have on average lower qIR than metal-rich ones with larger offsets at\nlonger IR wavelengths, from -0.06 dex in q24um to -0.6 dex in q160um. The qIR\nof all galaxies as a whole at 160 um show positive trends with the metallicity\nand IR-to-FUV ratio, and negative trends with the IR color, while those at\nlower IR wavelengths show weaker correlations. We proposed a mechanism that\ninvokes combined effects of low obscured-SFR/total-SFR fraction and warm dust\ntemperature at low metallicity to interpret the above behavior of qIR, with the\nformer reducing the IR radiation and the latter further reducing the IR\nemission at longer IR wavelength. Other mechanisms that are related to the\nradio emission including the enhanced magnetic field strength and increased\nthermal radio contribution are unable to reconcile the IR-wavelength-dependent\ndifferences of qIR between metal-poor and metal- rich galaxies. In contrast to\nqIR, the mean total-SFR/radio ratio of metal-poor galaxies is the same as the\nmetal-rich one, indicating the 1.4 GHz radio emission is still an effective\ntracer of SFRs at low metallicity.\n", "  CaOFeS is a semiconducting oxysulfide with polar layered triangular\nstructure. Here a comprehensive theoretical study has been performed to reveal\nits physical properties, including magnetism, electronic structure, phase\ntransition, magnetodielectric effect, as well as optical absorption. Our\ncalculations confirm the Ising-like G-type antiferromagnetic ground state\ndriven by the next-nearest neighbor exchanges, which breaks the trigonal\nsymmetry and is responsible for the magnetodielectric effect driven by exchange\nstriction. In addition, a large coefficient of visible light absorption is\npredicted, which leads to promising photovoltaic effect with the maximum\nlight-to-electricity energy conversion efficiency up to 24.2%.\n", "  A basic principle in crystal structure determination is that there should be\nproper distances between adjacent atoms. Therefore, detection of atom bumping\nis of fundamental significance in structure determination, especially in the\ndirect space method where crystallographic models are just randomly generated.\nPresented in this article is an algorithm that detects atom bonding in a unit\ncell based on the sweep and prune algorithm of axis-aligned bounding boxes\n(AABBs) and running in $O(n \\log n)$ time bound, where $n$ is the total number\nof atoms in the unit cell. This algorithm only needs the positions of\nindividual atoms in the unit cell and does not require any prior knowledge of\nexisting bonds, and is thus suitable for modelling of inorganic crystals where\nthe bonding relations are often unknown a priori. With this algorithm,\ncomputation routines requiring bonding information, eg. anti-bumping and\ncomputation of coordination numbers and valences, can be performed efficiently.\nAs an example application, an evaluation function for atom bumping is proposed,\nwhich can be used for real-time elimination of crystallographic models with\nunreasonably short bonds during the procedure of global optimisation in the\ndirect space method.\n", "  Recently, an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observation\nof the water snow line in the protoplanetary disk around the FU Orionis star\nV883 Ori was reported. The radial variation of the spectral index at\nmm-wavelengths around the snow line was interpreted as being due to a pileup of\nparticles interior to the snow line. However, radial transport of solids in the\nouter disk operates on timescales much longer than the typical timescale of an\nFU Ori outburst ($10^{1}$--$10^{2}$ yr). Consequently, a steady-state pileup is\nunlikely. We argue that it is only necessary to consider water evaporation and\nre-coagulation of silicates to explain the recent ALMA observation of V883 Ori\nbecause these processes are short enough to have had their impact since the\noutburst. Our model requires the inner disk to have already been optically\nthick before the outburst, and our results suggest that the carbon content of\npebbles is low.\n", "  For a wide class of Hermitian random matrices, the limit distribution of the\neigenvalues close to the largest one is governed by the Airy point process. In\nsuch ensembles, the limit distribution of the k-th largest eigenvalue is given\nin terms of the Airy kernel Fredholm determinant or in terms of Tracy-Widom\nformulas involving solutions of the Painlev\\'e II equation. Limit distributions\nfor quantities involving two or more near-extreme eigenvalues, such as the gap\nbetween the k-th and the \\ell-th largest eigenvalue or the sum of the k largest\neigenvalues, can be expressed in terms of Fredholm determinants of an Airy\nkernel with several discontinuities. We establish simple Tracy-Widom type\nexpressions for these Fredholm determinants, which involve solutions to systems\nof coupled Painlev\\'e II equations, and we investigate the asymptotic behavior\nof these solutions.\n", "  The xFitter project (former HERAFitter project) is an open-source package\nthat provides a framework for the determination of the parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) of the proton for many different kinds of analyses in Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD). xFitter version 2.0.0 has recently been released, and\noffers an expanded set of tools and options. It incorporates experimental data\nfrom a wide range of experiments including fixed-target, Tevatron, HERA, and\nLHC. xFitter can analyze this data up to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO)\nin perturbation theory with a variety of theoretical calculations including\nnumerous methodological options for carrying out PDF fits and plotting tools\nwhich help visualise the results. In this contribution, a determination of the\nphoton PDF from fits to recent ATLAS measurements of high-mass Drell-Yan\ndilepton production at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV using this framework is presented.\nThe work presented here is based on the paper published here: Eur.Phys.J. C77\n(2017) no.6, 400\n", "  We present the final results from a targeted search for brown dwarfs with\nunusual near-infrared colors. From a positional cross-match of SDSS, 2MASS and\nWISE, we have identified 144 candidate peculiar L and T dwarfs. Spectroscopy\nconfirms that 20 of the objects are peculiar or are candidate binaries. Nine of\nthe 420 objects in our sample are young ($\\lesssim$200 Myr; 2.1%) and another 8\n(1.9%) are unusually red with no signatures of youth. With a spectroscopic\n$J-K_s$ color of 2.58 $\\pm$ 0.11 mag, one of the new objects, the L6 dwarf\n2MASS J03530419+0418193, is among the reddest field dwarfs currently known and\nis one of the reddest objects with no signatures of youth known to date. We\nhave also discovered another potentially very low gravity object, the L1 dwarf\n2MASS J00133470+1109403, and independently identified the young L7 dwarf 2MASS\nJ00440332+0228112, first reported by Schneider and collaborators. Our results\nconfirm that signatures of low gravity are no longer discernible in low to\nmoderate resolution spectra of objects older than $\\sim$200 Myr. The 1.9% of\nunusually red L dwarfs that do not show other signatures of youth could be\nslightly older, up to $\\sim$400 Myr. In this case a red $J-K_s$ color may be\nmore diagnostic of moderate youth than individual spectral features. However,\nits is also possible that these objects are relatively metal-rich, and so have\nan enhanced atmospheric dust content.\n", "  The thermal evolution of Neutron Stars is affected by the elementary\nexcitations that characterize the stellar matter. In particular, the low-energy\nexcitations, with a spectrum linear in momentum, can play a major role in the\nemission and propagation of neutrinos. In this paper, we focus on the\nelementary modes in the region of proton superfluidity, where the neutron\ncomponent is expected to have a very small or zero pairing gap.\n  We study the overall spectral functions of protons, neutrons and electrons on\nthe basis of the Coulomb and nuclear interactions. This study is performed in\nthe framework of the Random Phase Approximation, generalized in order to\ndescribe the response of a superfluid system. The formalism we use ensures that\nthe Generalized Ward's Identities are satisfied. Despite their relative small\nfraction, the protons turn out to modify the neutron spectral function as a\nconsequence of the nuclear neutron-proton interaction. This effect is\nparticularly evident at the lower density, just below the crust for a density\nclose to the saturation value, while at increasing density the neutrons and the\nprotons are mainly decoupled. The proton spectral function is characterized by\na pseudo-Goldstone mode below $ 2\\Delta $, twice the pairing gap, and a\npair-breaking mode above $ 2\\Delta $. The latter merges in the sound mode of\nthe normal phase at higher momenta. The neutron spectral function develops a\ncollective sound mode only at the higher density. The electrons have a strong\nscreening effect on the proton-proton interaction at the lower momenta, and\ndecouple from the protons at higher momenta.\n", "  Massive runaway stars produce bow shocks through the interaction of their\nwinds with the interstellar medium, with the prospect for particle acceleration\nby the shocks. These objects are consequently candidates for non-thermal\nemission. Our aim is to investigate the X-ray emission from these sources. We\nobserved with XMM-Newton a sample of 5 bow shock runaways, which constitutes a\nsignificant improvement of the sample of bow shock runaways studied in X-rays\nso far. A careful analysis of the data did not reveal any X-ray emission\nrelated to the bow shocks. However, X-ray emission from the stars is detected,\nin agreement with the expected thermal emission from stellar winds. On the\nbasis of background measurements we derive conservative upper limits between\n0.3 and 10 keV on the bow shocks emission. Using a simple radiation model,\nthese limits together with radio upper limits allow us to constrain some of the\nmain physical quantities involved in the non-thermal emission processes, such\nas the magnetic field strength and the amount of incident infrared photons. The\nreasons likely responsible for the non-detection of non-thermal radiation are\ndiscussed. Finally, using energy budget arguments, we investigate the\ndetectability of inverse Compton X-rays in a more extended sample of catalogued\nrunaway star bow shocks. From our analysis we conclude that a clear\nidentification of non-thermal X-rays from massive runaway bow shocks requires\none order of magnitude (or higher) sensitivity improvement with respect to\npresent observatories.\n", "  We investigate the relaxation mechanism of a supercooled tetrahedral liquid\nat its limit of stability using isothermal isobaric ($NPT$) Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations. In similarity with systems which are far from equilibrium but near\nthe onset of jamming [O'Hern et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 93}, 165702 (2004)],\nwe find that the relaxation is characterized by two time-scales: the decay of\nlong-wavelength (slow) fluctuations of potential energy is controlled by the\nthe slope $[\\partial (G/N)/\\partial \\phi]$ of the Gibbs free energy ($G$) at a\nunique value of per particle potential energy $\\phi = \\phi_{mid}$. The\nshort-wavelength (fast) fluctuations are controlled by the bath temperature\n$T$. The relaxation of the supercooled liquid is initiated with a dynamical\ncrossover after which the potential energy fluctuations are biased towards\nvalues progressively lesser than $\\phi_{mid}$. The dynamical crossover leads to\nthe change of time-scale, i.e., the decay of long-wavelength potential energy\nfluctuations (intermediate relaxation). Because of the condition [$\\partial^2\n(G/N)/\\partial \\phi^2 = 0$] at $\\phi = \\phi_{mid}$, the slope $[\\partial\n(G/N)/\\partial \\phi]$ has a unique value and governs the intermediate stage of\nrelaxation, which ends just after the crossover. In the subsequent stage, there\nis a relatively rapid crystallization due to lack of long-wavelength\nfluctuations and the instability at $\\phi_{mid}$, i.e., the condition that $G$\ndecreases as configurations with potential energies lower than $\\phi_{mid}$ are\naccessed. The dynamical crossover point and the associated change in the\ntime-scale of fluctuations is found to be consistent with the previous studies.\n", "  The physical conditions that determine whether or not solar active regions\n(ARs) produce strong flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are not yet well\nunderstood. Here we investigate the association between electric-current\nneutralization, magnetic shear along polarity inversion lines (PILs), and\neruptive activity in four ARs; two emerging and two well-developed ones. We\nfind that the CME-producing ARs are characterized by a strongly non-neutralized\ntotal current, while the total current in the ARs that did not produce CMEs is\nalmost perfectly neutralized. The difference in the PIL-shear between these two\ngroups is much less pronounced, which suggests that the degree of\ncurrent-neutralization may serve as a better proxy for assessing the ability of\nARs to produce CMEs.\n", "  The spatial distribution of oxygen in the interstellar medium of galaxies is\nthe key to understanding how efficiently metals that are synthesized in massive\nstars can be redistributed across a galaxy. We present here a case study in the\nnearby spiral galaxy NGC1365 using 3D optical data obtained in the TYPHOON\nProgram. We find systematic azimuthal variations of the HII region oxygen\nabundance imprinted on a negative radial gradient. The 0.2 dex azimuthal\nvariations occur over a wide radial range of 0.3 to 0.7 R25 and peak at the two\nspiral arms in NGC1365. We show that the azimuthal variations can be explained\nby two physical processes: gas undergoes localized, sub-kpc scale\nself-enrichment when orbiting in the inter-arm region, and experiences\nefficient, kpc scale mixing-induced dilution when spiral density waves pass\nthrough. We construct a simple chemical evolution model to quantitatively test\nthis picture and find that our toy model can reproduce the observations. This\nresult suggests that the observed abundance variations in NGC1365 are a\nsnapshot of the dynamical local enrichment of oxygen modulated by\nspiral-driven, periodic mixing and dilution.\n", "  The creation and design of a plasma thruster are considered using a rotating\ncylindrical plasma flow in crossed magnetic fields. The thruster scheme uses\nthis plasma guided by a permanent, radial and a time-dependent axial magnetic\nfield. Namely, the acceleration effect is formed by the azimuthal electric\nfield which comes about as a variation of an external, axial magnetic flux.\nBesides, it is possible to go beyond the approach of quasi-neutrality. These\nprocesses can lead to the generation of a local azimuthal time-dependent\nelectric field which may also accelerate the rotation of the electron and ion\nfluids in different directions. Furthermore, estimations of this device and the\nplasma flow demonstrate additional thrust effects as well as can consume\ninterplanetary medium as a fuel for driving plasma thrust.\n", "  The nonlinear dynamics of collisionless non-neutral plasma without external\nstabilizing factors is considered. Time-dependent one-particle distribution\nfunctions of a Maxwellian type are obtained. The influence of initial\nconditions on the entropy production is discussed.\n", "  We derive infrared and radio flux densities of all ~1000 known Galactic HII\nregions in the Galactic longitude range 17.5 < l < 65 degree. Our sample comes\nfrom the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalog of Galactic \\hii\nregions \\citep{anderson2014}. We compute flux densities at six wavelengths in\nthe infrared (GLIMPSE 8 microns, WISE 12 microns and 22 microns, MIPSGAL 24\nmicrons, and Hi-GAL 70 microns and 160 microns) and two in the radio (MAGPIS 20\ncm and VGPS 21 cm). All HII region infrared flux densities are strongly\ncorrelated with their ~20 cm flux densities. All HII regions used here,\nregardless of physical size or Galactocentric radius, have similar infrared to\nradio flux density ratios and similar infrared colors, although the smallest\nregions ($r<1\\,$pc), have slightly elevated IR to radio ratios. The colors\n$\\log_{10}(F_{24 micron}/F_{12 micron}) \\ge 0$ and $\\log_{10}(F_{70\nmicron}/F_{12 micron}) \\ge 1.2$, and $\\log_{10}(F_{24 micron}/F_{12 micron})\n\\ge 0$ and $\\log_{10}(F_{160 micron}/F_{70 micron}) \\le 0.67$ reliably select\nHII regions, independent of size. The infrared colors of ~22$\\%$ of HII\nregions, spanning a large range of physical sizes, satisfy the IRAS color\ncriteria of \\citet{wood1989} for HII regions, after adjusting the criteria to\nthe wavelengths used here. Since these color criteria are commonly thought to\nselect only ultra-compact HII regions, this result indicates that the true\nultra-compact HII region population is uncertain. Comparing with a sample of IR\ncolor indices from star-forming galaxies, HII regions show higher\n$\\log_{10}(F_{70 micron}/F_{12 micron})$ ratios. We find a weak trend of\ndecreasing infrared to ~20 cm flux density ratios with increasing $R_{gal}$, in\nagreement with previous extragalactic results, possibly indicating a decreased\ndust abundance in the outer Galaxy.\n", "  We constructed for the first time a stellar density profile of 47 Tucanae (47\nTuc) out of $\\sim$ 5.5 times its tidal radius ($r_t$) using high-quality deep\n$BV$ photometry. After carefully considering the influence of photometric\nerrors, and Milky Way and Small Magellanic Cloud composite stellar population\ncontamination, we found that the cluster stellar density profile reaches a\nnearly constant value from $\\sim$ 1.7$r_t$ outwards, which does not depend on\nthe direction from the cluster's center considered. These results visibly\ncontrast with recent distinct theoretical predictions on the existence of tidal\ntails or on a density profile that falls as $r^{-4}$ at large distances, and\nwith observational outcomes of a clumpy structure as well. Our results suggest\nthat the envelope of 47 Tuc is a halo- like nearly constant low density\nstructure.\n", "  We report on angle-dependent measurements of the sheet resistances and Hall\ncoefficients of electron liquids in SmTiO3/SrTiO3/SmTiO3 quantum well\nstructures, which were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on (001) DyScO3. We\ncompare their transport properties with those of similar structures grown on\nLSAT [(La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O3]. On DyScO3, planar defects normal to the\nquantum wells lead to a strong in-plane anisotropy in the transport properties.\nThis allows for quantifying the role of defects in transport. In particular, we\ninvestigate differences in the longitudinal and Hall scattering rates, which is\na non-Fermi liquid phenomenon known as lifetime separation. The residuals in\nboth the longitudinal resistance and Hall angle were found to depend on the\nrelative orientations of the transport direction to the planar defects. The\nHall angle exhibited a robust T2 temperature dependence along all directions,\nwhereas no simple power law could describe the temperature dependence of the\nlongitudinal resistances. Remarkably, the degree of the carrier lifetime\nseparation, as manifested in the distinctly different temperature dependences\nand diverging residuals near a critical quantum well thickness, was completely\ninsensitive to disorder. The results allow for a clear distinction between\ndisorder-induced contributions to the transport and intrinsic, non-Fermi liquid\nphenomena, which includes the lifetime separation.\n", "  This lesson unit has been developed within the framework the EU Space\nAwareness project. It provides an insight into the history and navigational\nmethods of the Bronze Age Mediterranean peoples. The students explore the link\nbetween exciting history and astronomical knowledge. Besides an overview of\nancient seafaring in the Mediterranean, the students explore in two hands-on\nactivities early navigational skills using the stars and constellations and\ntheir apparent nightly movement across the sky. In the course of the\nactivities, they become familiar with the stellar constellations and how they\nare distributed across the northern and southern sky.\n", "  We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of CO\nlines and dust continuum emission of the source RCSGA 032727--132609, a young\n$z=1.7$ low-metallicity starburst galaxy. The CO(3-2) and CO(6-5) lines, and\ncontinuum at rest-frame $450\\,\\mu m$ are detected and show a resolved structure\nin the image plane. We use the corresponding lensing model to obtain a source\nplane reconstruction of the detected emissions revealing intrinsic flux density\nof $S_{450\\,\\mu m}=23.5_{-8.1}^{+26.8}$ $\\mu$Jy and intrinsic CO luminosities\n$L'_{\\rm CO(3-2)}=2.90_{-0.23}^{+0.21}\\times10^{8}$ ${\\rm\nK\\,km\\,s^{-1}\\,pc^{2}}$ and $L'_{\\rm CO(6-5)}=8.0_{-1.3}^{+1.4}\\times10^{7}$\n${\\rm K\\,km\\,s^{-1}\\,pc^{2}}$. We used the resolved properties in the source\nplane to obtain molecular gas and star-formation rate surface densities of\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm H2}=16.2_{-3.5}^{+5.8}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}$ and\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}=0.54_{-0.27}^{+0.89}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm\nkpc}^{-2}$ respectively. The intrinsic properties of RCSGA 032727--132609 show\nan enhanced star-formation activity compared to local spiral galaxies with\nsimilar molecular gas densities, supporting the ongoing merger-starburst phase\nscenario. RCSGA 032727--132609 also appears to be a low--density starburst\ngalaxy similar to local blue compact dwarf galaxies, which have been suggested\nas local analogs to high-redshift low-metallicity starburst systems. Finally,\nthe CO excitation level in the galaxy is consistent with having the peak at\n${\\rm J}\\sim5$, with a higher excitation concentrated in the star-forming\nclumps.\n", "  In this letter we present a unified derivation of the pressure equation of\nstates, thermodynamics and scaling functions for the one-dimensional (1D)\nstrongly attractive Fermi gases with $SU(w)$ symmetry. These physical\nquantities provide a rigorous understanding on a universality class of quantum\ncriticality characterised by the critical exponents $z=2$ and correlation\nlength exponent $\\nu=1/2$. Such a universality class of quantum criticality can\noccur when the Fermi sea of one branch of charge bound states starts to fill or\nbecome gapped at zero temperature. The quantum critical cone can be determined\nthrough the double peaks in specific heat which serve to mark two crossover\ntemperatures fanning out from the critical point. Our method opens to further\nstudy on quantum phases and phase transitions in strongly interacting fermions\nwith large $SU(w)$ and non-$SU(w)$ symmetries in one dimension.\n", "  We consider a generic class of the so-called inflationary $-\\alpha$ attractor\nmodels and compute the cosmological observables in the Einstein and Jordan\nframes, of the corresponding $F(R)-$gravity theory. We find that the two sets\ncoincide (to within errors from the use of the slow-roll approximation) for\nmoderate and large values of the number of e-foldings $N$, which is the novel\nresult of this paper, generalizing previous results on the subject (see e.g.\nRef. (\\citen{oik1})). We briefly comment on the possible generalizations of\nthese results.\n", "  A distinct population of planetary systems that contain dynamically isolated,\nEarth-size planets with orbital periods $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\sim 1\\,$day was\nrecently identified in an analysis of data from the Kepler planet candidate\ncatalog. We argue that these objects could represent the remnant rocky cores of\ngiant planets that arrived at the stellar vicinity on high-eccentricity orbits\nand were rapidly stripped of their gaseous envelopes after crossing their\nrespective Roche limits (RLs) $a_\\mathrm{R,p}$. In this picture, objects with\n$P_\\mathrm{orb}\\gtrsim1\\,$day are mostly \"early\" cores that originated in\nplanets with an initial periastron distance $a_\\mathrm{per,0}\\le\na_\\mathrm{R,p}$; they had high initial eccentricities but their orbits\nunderwent fast tidal circularization after the cores were exposed. Objects with\n$P_\\mathrm{orb}\\lesssim 1\\,$day are, by contrast, mostly \"late\" cores that\noriginated in planets with $a_\\mathrm{per,0}>a_\\mathrm{R,p}$; these planets\nunderwent orbital circularization to a radius $>a_\\mathrm{per,0}$ but\neventually reached $a_\\mathrm{R,p}$ through tidal orbital decay. This picture\nnaturally accounts for the spatial distribution of hot Earths and for the\nsimilarity of their inferred occurrence rate to that of hot Jupiters, and it\nfits well with the interpretation of the so-called sub-Jovian desert in the\norbital-period--planetary-mass plane in terms of high-eccentricity planet\nmigration to the vicinity of the RL.\n", "  Recently the so-called mimetic gravity approach has been used to obtain\ncorrections to Friedmann equation of General Relativity similar to the ones\npresent in loop quantum cosmology. In this paper, we propose an alternative way\nto derive this modified Friedmann equation via the so-called non-polynomial\ngravity approach, which consists in adding geometric non-polynomial higher\nderivative terms to Hilbert-Einstein action, which are nonetheless polynomials\nand lead to second order differential equation in\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Our explicit action turns out\nto be a realization of the Helling proposal of effective action with infinite\nnumber of terms. The model is investigated also in presence of non vanishing\ncosmological constant and a new exact bounce solution is found and studied.\n", "  One serious challenge for planet formation is the rapid inward drift of\npebble-sized dust particles in protoplanetary disks. Dust trapping at local\nmaxima in the disk gas pressure has received much theoretical attention but\nstill lacks observational support. The cold dust emission in the AB Aur disk\nforms an asymmetric ring at a radius of about 120 au, which is suggestive of\ndust trapping in a gas vortex. We present high spatial resolution (0\".58x0\".78\n~ 80x110 au) NOEMA observations of the 1.12 mm and 2.22 mm dust continuum\nemission from the AB Aur disk. Significant azimuthal variations of the flux\nratio at both wavelengths indicate a size segregation of the large dust\nparticles along the ring. Our continuum images also show that the intensity\nvariations along the ring are smaller at 2.22 mm than at 1.12 mm, contrary to\nwhat dust trapping models with a gas vortex have predicted. Our two-fluid\n(gas+dust) hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that this feature is well\nexplained if the gas vortex has started to decay due to turbulent diffusion,\nand dust particles are thus losing the azimuthal trapping on different\ntimescales depending on their size. The comparison between our observations and\nsimulations allows us to constrain the size distribution and the total mass of\nsolid particles in the ring, which we find to be of the order of 30 Earth\nmasses, enough to form future rocky planets.\n", "  Starburst galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation are among the most\nextreme starforming engines in the universe, producing stars over ~100 Myr. The\nstar formation rates of these galaxies, which exceed 100 $M_\\odot$ per year,\nrequire large reservoirs of cold molecular gas to be delivered to their cores,\ndespite strong feedback from stars or active galactic nuclei. Starburst\ngalaxies are therefore ideal targets to unravel the critical interplay between\nthis feedback and the growth of a galaxy. The methylidyne cation, CH$^+$, is a\nmost useful molecule for such studies because it cannot form in cold gas\nwithout supra-thermal energy input, so its presence highlights dissipation of\nmechanical energy or strong UV irradiation. Here, we report the detection of\nCH$^+$(J=1-0) emission and absorption lines in the spectra of six lensed\nstarburst galaxies at redshifts z~2.5. This line has such a high critical\ndensity for excitation that it is emitted only in very dense ($>10^5$\ncm$^{-3}$) gas, and is absorbed in low-density gas. We find that the CH$^+$\nemission lines, which are broader than 1000 km s$^{-1}$, originate in dense\nshock waves powered by hot galactic winds. The CH$^+$ absorption lines reveal\nhighly turbulent reservoirs of cool ($T\\sim 100$K), low-density gas, extending\nfar outside (>10 kpc) the starburst cores (radii <1 kpc). We show that the\ngalactic winds sustain turbulence in the 10 kpc-scale environments of the\nstarburst cores, processing these environments into multi-phase,\ngravitationally bound reservoirs. However, the mass outflow rates are found to\nbe insufficient to balance the star formation rates. Another mass input is\ntherefore required for these reservoirs, which could be provided by on-going\nmergers or cold stream accretion. Our results suggest that galactic feedback,\ncoupled jointly to turbulence and gravity, extends the starburst phase instead\nof quenching it.\n", "  We explore the morphology of galaxies living in the proximity of cosmic\nvoids, using a sample of voids identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data\nRelease 7. At all stellar masses, void galaxies exhibit morphologies of a later\ntype than galaxies in a control sample, which represent galaxies in an average\ndensity environment. We interpret this trend as a pure environmental effect,\nindependent of the mass bias, due to a slower galaxy build-up in the rarefied\nregions of voids. We confirm previous findings about a clear segregation in\ngalaxy morphology, with galaxies of a later type being found at smaller\nvoid-centric distances with respect to the early-type galaxies. We also show,\nfor the first time, that the radius of the void has an impact on the\nevolutionary history of the galaxies that live within it or in its\nsurroundings. In fact, an enhanced fraction of late-type galaxies is found in\nthe proximity of voids larger than the median void radius. Likewise, an excess\nof early-type galaxies is observed within or around voids of a smaller size. A\nsignificant difference in galaxy properties in voids of different sizes is\nobserved up to 2 Rvoid, which we define as the region of influence of voids.\nThe significance of this difference is greater than 3sigma for all the\nvolume-complete samples considered here. The fraction of star-forming galaxies\nshows the same behavior as the late-type galaxies, but no significant\ndifference in stellar mass is observed in the proximity of voids of different\nsizes.\n", "  We present multi-wavelength analysis for four bipolar bubbles\n(G045.386-0.726, G049.998-0.125, G050.489+0.993, and G051.610-0.357) to probe\nthe structure and dynamics of their surrounding gas. The 12CO J=1-0, 13CO J=1-0\nand C18O J=1-0 observations are made with the Purple Mountain Observation (PMO)\n13.7 m radio telescope. For the four bipolar bubbles, the bright 8.0 um\nemission shows the bipolar structure. Each bipolar bubble is associated with an\nHII region. From CO observations we find that G045.386-0.726 is composed of two\nbubbles with different distances, not a bipolar bubble. Each of G049.998-0.125\nand G051.610-0.357 is associated with a filament. The filaments in CO emission\ndivide G049.998-0.125 and G051.610-0.357 into two lobes. We suggest that the\nexciting stars of both G049.998-0.125 and G051.610-0.357 form in a sheet-like\nstructure clouds. Furthermore, G050.489+0.993 is associated with a clump, which\nshows a triangle-like shape with a steep integrated intensity gradient towards\nthe two lobes of G050.489+0.993. We suggest that the two lobes of\nG050.489+0.993 have simultaneously expanded into the clump.\n", "  We investigate the existence conditions and propagation properties of\nelectron-acoustic solitary waves in a plasma consisting of an electron beam\nfluid, a cold electron fluid, and a hot suprathermal electron component modeled\nby a $\\kappa$-distribution function. The Sagdeev pseudopotential method was\nused to investigate the occurrence of stationary-profile solitary waves. We\nhave determined how the soliton characteristics depend on the electron beam\nparameters. It is found that the existence domain for solitons becomes narrower\nwith an increase in the suprathermality of hot electrons, increasing the beam\nspeed, and decreasing the beam-to-cold electron population ratio.\n", "  The C I 135.58 line is located in the wavelength range of NASA's Interface\nRegion Imagin Spectrograph (IRIS) small explorer mission. We here study the\nformation and diagnostic potential of this line by means of non\nlocal-thermodynamic-equilibrium modeling, employing both 1D and 3D\nradiation-magnetohydrodynamic models. The C I/C II ionization balance is\nstrongly influenced by photoionization by Ly-alpha emission. The emission in\nthe C I 135.58 line is dominated by a recombination cascade and the line\nforming region is optically thick. The Doppler shift of the line correlates\nstrongly with the vertical velocity in its line forming region, which is\ntypically located at 1.5 Mm height. With IRIS the C I 135.58 line is usually\nobserved together with the O I 135.56 line, and from the Doppler shift of both\nlines, we obtain the velocity difference between the line forming regions of\nthe two lines. From the ratio of the C I/O I line core intensity, we can\ndetermine the distance between the C I and the O I forming layers. Combined\nwith the velocity difference, the velocity gradient at mid-chromospheric\nheights can be derived. The C I/O I total intensity line ratio is correlated\nwith the inverse of the electron density in the mid-chromosphere. We conclude\nthat the C I 135.58 line is an excellent probe of the middle chromosphere by\nitself, and together with the O I 135.56 line the two lines provide even more\ninformation, which complements other powerful chromospheric diagnostics of IRIS\nsuch as the Mg II h and k lines and the C II lines around 133.5 nm.\n", "  The ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 hosts seven Earth-size transiting\nplanets, some of which could harbour liquid water on their surfaces. UV\nobservations are essential to measure their high-energy irradiation, and to\nsearch for photodissociated water escaping from their putative atmospheres. Our\nnew observations of TRAPPIST-1 Ly-$\\alpha$ line during the transit of\nTRAPPIST-1c show an evolution of the star emission over three months,\npreventing us from assessing the presence of an extended hydrogen exosphere.\nBased on the current knowledge of the stellar irradiation, we investigated the\nlikely history of water loss in the system. Planets b to d might still be in a\nrunaway phase, and planets within the orbit of TRAPPIST-1g could have lost more\nthan 20 Earth oceans after 8 Gyr of hydrodynamic escape. However, TRAPPIST-1e\nto h might have lost less than 3 Earth oceans if hydrodynamic escape stopped\nonce they entered the habitable zone. We caution that these estimates remain\nlimited by the large uncertainty on the planet masses. They likely represent\nupper limits on the actual water loss because our assumptions maximize the\nXUV-driven escape, while photodissociation in the upper atmospheres should be\nthe limiting process. Late-stage outgassing could also have contributed\nsignificant amounts of water for the outer, more massive planets after they\nentered the habitable zone. While our results suggest that the outer planets\nare the best candidates to search for water with the JWST, they also highlight\nthe need for theoretical studies and complementary observations in all\nwavelength domains to determine the nature of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and their\npotential habitability.\n", "  We have derived the global mass functions of a sample of 35 Galactic globular\nclusters by comparing deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry with suitable\nmultimass dynamical models. For a subset of 29 clusters with available radial\nvelocity information we were also able to determine dynamical parameters,\nmass-to-light ratios and the mass fraction of dark remnants. The derived global\nmass functions are well described by single power-laws in the mass range $0.2 <\nm/M_\\odot < 0.8$ with mass function slopes $\\alpha>-1$. Less evolved clusters\nshow deviations from a single-power law, indicating that the original shape of\ntheir mass distribution was not a power-law. We find a tight anticorrelation\nbetween the present-day mass function slopes and the half-mass relaxation\ntimes, which can be understood if clusters started from the same universal IMF\nand internal dynamical evolution is the main driver in shaping the present-day\nmass functions. Alternatively, IMF differences correlated with the present-day\nhalf-mass relaxation time are needed to explain the observed correlation. The\nlarge range of mass function slopes seen for our clusters implies that most\nglobular clusters are dynamically highly evolved, a fact that seems difficult\nto reconcile with standard estimates for the dynamical evolution of clusters.\nThe mass function slopes also correlate with the dark remnant fractions\nindicating a preferential retention of massive remnants in clusters subject to\nhigh mass-loss rates.\n", "  An electric method for measuring magnetic anisotropy in antiferromagnetic\ninsulators (AFIs) is proposed. When a metallic film with strong spin-orbit\ninteractions, e.g., platinum (Pt), is deposited on an AFI, its resistance\nshould be affected by the direction of the AFI N eel vector due to the spin\nHall magnetoresistance (SMR). Accordingly, the direction of the AFI N eel\nvector, which is affected by both the external magnetic field and the magnetic\nanisotropy, is reflected in resistance of Pt. The magnetic field angle\ndependence of the resistance of Pt on AFI is calculated by consider- ing the\nSMR, which indicates that the antiferromagnetic anisotropy can be obtained\nexperimentally by monitoring the Pt resistance in strong magnetic fields.\nCalculations are performed for realistic systems such as Pt/Cr2O3, Pt/NiO, and\nPt/CoO.\n", "  Extreme variations of Earth's magnetic field occurred in the Levant region\naround 1000 BC, when the field intensity rapidly rose and fell by a factor of\n2. No coherent link currently exists between this intensity spike and the\nglobal field produced by the core geodynamo. Here we show that the Levantine\nspike must span > 60 degrees longitude at Earth's surface if it originates from\nthe core-mantle boundary (CMB). Several low intensity data are incompatible\nwith this geometric bound, though age uncertainties suggest these data could\nhave sampled the field before the spike emerged. Models that best satisfy\nenergetic and geometric constraints produce CMB spikes 8-22 degrees wide,\npeaking at O(100) mT. We suggest that the Levantine spike reflects an intense\nCMB flux patch that grew in place before migrating northwest, contributing to\ngrowth of the dipole field. Estimates of Ohmic heating suggest that diffusive\nprocesses likely govern the ultimate decay of geomagnetic spikes.\n", "  The most recent results on searches in lepton plus jet final states motivated\nby different models beyond the standard model are presented, using pp collision\ndata collected by the ATLAS and CMS detectors during Run I and Run II at the\nCERN LHC. Leptoquarks and heavy Majorana neutrinos that arise in the left-right\nmodel are looked for in the final states with two leptons and two jets (ll +\njj; l = e; mu; tau ). Heavy Majorana neutrinos are further investigated by\nrelying on a composite-fermion scenario, considering two leptons and one\nlarge-radius jet (ll + J; l = e, mu), and in the context of a model with Type-1\nseesaw mechanism, requiring two same-sign leptons plus dijet (ll' + jj; l,l' =\ne, mu). Finally, models of microscopic black holes with two to six extra\ndimensions are tested by analysing the channels with at least one lepton and\ntwo additional jets (l + jj; l = e, mu). In all the searches, the observed data\nare in good agreement with the standard model prediction and 95% confidence\nlevel upper limits are set on the parameters of difierent models.\n", "  Times magazine selected Albert Einstein, the German born Jewish Scientist as\nthe person of the 20th century. Undoubtedly, 20th century was the age of\nscience and Einstein's contributions in unraveling mysteries of nature was\nunparalleled. However, few are aware that Einstein was also a great inventor.\nHe and his collaborators had patented a wide variety of inventions in several\ncountries. After a brief description of Einstein's life, his collaborators, his\ninventions and patents will be discussed.\n", "  Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) encoding multidimensional information\nof hadron partonic structure appear as the building blocks in a factorized\ndescription of hard exclusive reactions. The nucleon GPDs have been accessed by\ndeeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production with\nlepton beam. A complementary probe with hadron beam is shown to be the\nexclusive pion-induced Drell-Yan process, $\\pi^- p \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^- n$, as\ndemonstrated by recent theoretical advances on describing this process in terms\nof QCD factorization as the partonic subprocess convoluted with the nucleon\nGPDs and the pion distribution amplitudes, and by the feasibility study for its\nmeasurement via a spectrometer at the High Momentum Beamline being constructed\nat J-PARC in Japan. We also discuss the possible soft partonic mechanisms\nbeyond the QCD factorization framework, and present an estimate of the soft\nmechanisms at J-PARC kinematics, making use of dispersion relations and\nquark-hadron duality. Realization of the measurement of the exclusive\npion-induced Drell-Yan process at J-PARC will provide a new test of QCD\ndescriptions of a novel class of hard exclusive reactions, and also offer the\npossibility of experimentally accessing nucleon GPDs at large timelike\nvirtuality.\n", "  The theoretical community has found interest in the ability of a two-level\natom to generate a strong many-body interaction with light under pulsed\nexcitation. Single-photon generation is the most well-known effect, where a\nshort Gaussian laser pulse is converted into a Lorentzian single-photon\nwavepacket. However, recent proposals have surprisingly suggested that\nscattering with intense laser fields off a two-level atom may generate\noscillations in two-photon emission that are out of phase with its Rabi\noscillations, as the power of the pulse increases. Here, we provide an\nintuitive explanation for these oscillations using a quantum trajectory\napproach and show how they may preferentially result in emission of two-photon\npulses. Experimentally, we observe signatures of these oscillations by\nmeasuring the bunching of photon pulses scattered off a two-level quantum\nsystem. Our theory and measurements provide crucial insight into the\nre-excitation process that plagues on-demand single-photon sources while\nsuggesting the production of novel multi-photon states.\n", "  We report that the pion radius, decay constant, EM and transition form\nfactors can simultaneously and accurately be predicted in light-front\nholographic QCD with a universal AdS/QCD mass scale, provided dynamical spin\neffects are taken into account.\n", "  We present spectroscopic and photometric analysis of KIC\\,9451096, where the\nlatter is based on very high precision long cadence photometry obtained by\n$Kepler$ space craft. Combined spectroscopic and photometric modeling show that\nthe system is a detached eclipsing binary in a circular orbit and composed of\nF5V + K2V components. Subtracting the best--fit light curve model from whole\nlong cadence data reveals additional low (mmag) amplitude light variation in\ntime and occasional flares, suggesting low, but still remarkable level of\nmagnetic spot activity on the K2V component. Analyzing rotational modulation of\nlight curve residuals enables us to estimate differential rotation coefficient\nof the K2V component as $k = 0.069 \\pm 0.008$, which is 3 times weaker compared\nwith the solar value of $k = 0.19$, assuming a solar type differential\nrotation. We find stellar flare activity frequency for K2V component as\n0.000368411 $h^{-1}$ indicating low magnetic activity level.\n", "  The Brillouin theorem has been generalized for the extended non-relativistic\nelectronic Hamiltonian (Hkin+ Hne+ aHee) in relation to coupling strength\nparameter (a), as well as for the configuration interactions (CI) formalism in\nthis respect. For a computation support, we have made a particular modification\nof the SCF part in the Gaussian package: essentially a single line was changed\nin an SCF algorithm, wherein the operator rij-1 was overwritten as 1/rij to\na/rij, and a was used as input. The case a=0 generates an orto-normalized set\nof Slater determinants which can be used as a basis set for CI calculations for\nthe interesting physical case a=1, removing the known restriction by Brillouin\ntheorem with this trick. The latter opens a door from the theoretically\ninteresting subject of this work toward practice.\n", "  The review is a brief description of the state of problems in percolation\ntheory and their numerous applications, which are analyzed on base of\ninteresting papers published in the last 15-20 years. At the submitted papers\nare studied both the cluster system of the physical body and its impact on the\nobject in general, and adequate mathematical tools for description of critical\nphenomena too. Of special interest are the data, first, the point of phase\ntransition of certain of percolation system is not really a point, but it is a\ncritical interval, and second, in vicinity of percolation threshold observed\nmany different infinite clusters instead of one infinite cluster that appears\nin traditional consideration.\n", "  We present a self-consistency analysis of fission product yield evaluations.\nAnomalous yields are determined using a series of simple conservation checks\nand comparing charge distributions with common parameterizations. The total\nprompt neutron multiplicity as a function of product mass $\\bar{\\nu}_T(A)$ is\nderived directly from the independent fission product yields using average\ncharge conservation. This method is checked against Monte Carlo simulations of\nthe de-excitation of the fission fragments in a Hauser-Feshbach statistical\ndecay framework. The derived $\\bar{\\nu}_T(A)$ is compared with experimental\ndata, when available, and used to compare the prompt neutron multiplicity\n$\\bar{\\nu}$ for the various evaluations. Differences in $\\bar{\\nu}$ for each\nevaluation are investigated and possible sources are identified. We also\nidentify fission reactions that are inconsistent with prompt neutron data and\npropose possible solutions to remedy the observed inconsistencies.\n", "  The QCD light-front Hamitonian equation derived from quantization at fixed LF\ntime provides a causal, frame-independent, method for computing hadron\nspectroscopy and dynamical observables. de Alfaro, Fubini, and Furlan (dAFF)\nhave made an important observation that a mass scale can appear in the\nequations of motion without affecting the conformal invariance of the action if\none adds a term to the Hamiltonian proportional to the dilatation operator or\nthe special conformal operator. If one applies the dAFF procedure to the QCD\nlight-front Hamiltonian, it leads to a color confining potential $\\kappa^4\n\\zeta^2$ for mesons, where $\\zeta^2$ is the LF radial variable conjugate to the\n$q \\bar q$ invariant mass squared. The same result, including spin terms, is\nobtained using light-front holography if one modifies the AdS$_5$ action by the\ndilaton $e^{\\kappa^2 z^2}$ in the fifth dimension $z$. When one generalizes\nthis procedure using superconformal algebra, the resulting light-front\neigensolutions provide a unified Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and\ntetraquarks, including remarkable supersymmetric relations between the masses\nof mesons and baryons and a universal Regge slope. The pion $q \\bar q$\neigenstate has zero mass at $m_q=0.$ The superconformal relations also can be\nextended to heavy-light quark mesons and baryons. AdS/QCD also predicts the\nanalytic form of the nonperturbative running coupling in agreement with the\neffective charge measured from measurements of the Bjorken sum rule. The mass\nscale underlying hadron masses can be connected to the mass parameter in the\nQCD running coupling. The result is an effective coupling $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$\ndefined at all momenta. One also obtains empirically viable predictions for\nspacelike and timelike hadronic form factors, structure functions, distribution\namplitudes, and transverse momentum distributions.\n", "  Misplacement of electrostatic elements can pose false EDM signal in a storage\nring EDM experiment because of coupling between vertical electric field and\nmagnetic dipole moment. A vertically misplaced quadrupole introduces electric\nfield proportional to its misplacement, changing periodically in the particle's\nrest frame during the storage. This leads to accumulation of vertical spin\ncomponent at every revolution. We investigated this effect by simulating a\nproton in an all-electric ring with several quadrupole scenarios. It turns out\nthat the misplacement of quadrupoles is a critical item to keep under control,\nfor which we propose several methods. These include tuning the frequency of the\nRF cavity, making use of additional correction quadrupoles and using\nquadrupoles with weaker focusing strength.\n", "  The weak measurements based amplification of ultra-small phase was proposed\nin our previous work. Due to the technical imperfections, the ability of\namplification is usually limited in practice. Here we introduce the concept of\ncascaded weak measurements amplification so that the ability of weak\nmeasurements amplification can be further improved. A formula of determining\nthe cascaded number of weak measurements amplification is derived. The method\npresented here could be found useful in high precision measurement e.g.,\ngravitational waves detection.\n", "  An enhancement of the spin-orbit effects arising on an interface between a\nferromagnet (FM) and a heavy metal (HM) is possible through the strong breaking\nof the structural inversion symmetry in the layered films. Here we show that\nthe introduction of an ultrathin W interlayer between Co and Ru in Ru/Co/Ru\nfilms enables to preserve perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and\nsimultaneously induce a large interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n(iDMI). We find that the Ru/Co/W/Ru films have PMA up to 0.35 nm of the nominal\nthickness of W (tW). The study of the spin-wave propagation in the\nDamon-Eshbach geometry by Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy reveals\nthe drastic increase of the iDMI value with the rising tW. The maximum iDMI of\n-3.1 erg/cm2 is observed for tW=0.24 nm, which is 10 times larger than the\nlatter for the quasi-symmetrical Ru/Co/Ru films. The ability to simultaneous\ncontrol the strength of PMA and iDMI in symmetrical HM/FM/HM trilayer systems\nthrough the interface engineered inversion asymmetry at the nanoscale excites\nnew fundamental and practical interest to the chiral ferromagnets, which are a\npotential host for magnetic skyrmions.\n", "  This is a note accompanying \"CS 410/510: INTRO TO QUANTUM COMPUTING\" I taught\nat Portland State University in Spring 2017. It is a review and summary of some\nearly results related to Grover's quantum search algorithm in a consistent way.\nI had to go back and forth among several books, notes and original papers to\nsort out various details when preparing the lectures, which was a pain. This is\nthe motivation behind this note. I would like to thank Peter H{\\o}yer for\nvaluable feedback on this note.\n", "  Laser brightness is a measure of the ability to de- liver intense light to a\ntarget, and encapsulates both the energy content and the beam quality. High\nbrightness lasers requires that both parameters be maximised, yet standard\nlaser cavities do not allow this. For example, in solid-state lasers multimode\nbeams have a high energy content but low beam quality, while Gaussian modes\nhave a small mode volume and hence low energy extraction, but in a good quality\nmode. Here we over- come this fundamental limitation and demonstrate an optimal\napproach to realising high brightness lasers. We employ intra- cavity beam\nshaping to produce a Gaussian mode that carries all the energy of the multimode\nbeam, thus energy extraction and beam quality are simultaneously maximised.\nThis work will have a significant influence on the design of future high\nbrightness laser cavities.\n", "  Using standard 1D-LTE model atmosphere analysis, we provide an in-depth\ninvestigation of iron abundance as derived from neutral and singly ionization\niron lines (Fe {\\scriptsize{I, II}}) in nearby star clusters. Specifically, we\nreplicate the discrepancy regarding $\\Delta$[Fe/H], wherein the difference of\nFe {\\scriptsize{II}} - Fe {\\scriptsize{I}} increases for stars of the same\ncluster with decreasing $T_\\mathrm{eff}$, reaching an astonishing 1.0 dex at\n$T_\\mathrm{eff}$ $\\thicksim$ 4000 K. Previous studies have investigated this\nanomaly in the Pleiades and Hyades clusters with no concrete solution. In this\nanalysis, we probe two samples: 63 wide binary field stars where the primary\nstar is of sun-like temperatures and the secondary is a K-dwarf, ranging from\n4231 K $\\leq$ $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ $\\leq$ 6453 K, and 33 Hyades stars of\ntemperatures 4268 K $\\leq$ $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ $\\leq$ 6072 K. Previous studies\nhave found discrepancies on the order of 1.0 dex. However, we find that these\nstudies have neglected line-blending effects of certain Fe {\\scriptsize{II}}\nlines, namely $\\lambda$ = \\{4508.29 \\AA, 4993.34 \\AA, 5197.58 \\AA, 5325.55 \\AA,\n5425.26 \\AA, 6456.38 \\AA\\}. When these lines are removed from the line-list, we\nfind $\\Delta$[Fe/H] decreases to $\\thicksim$ 0.6 dex in the field binaries and\n$\\thicksim$ 0.3 dex in the Hyades. The reason for this remaining trend is\ninvestigated by probing NLTE effects, as well as age and activity\nconsiderations using Ca {\\scriptsize{II}} H+K emission and Li absorption, but\nthese results appear to be small to negligible.\n", "  Atomic clocks use atomic transitions as frequency references. The\nsusceptibility of the atomic transition to external fields limits clock\nstability and introduces systematic frequency shifts. Here, we propose to\nrealize an atomic clock that utilizes an entangled superposition of states of\nmultiple atomic species, where the reference frequency is a sum of the\nindividual transition frequencies. The superposition is selected such that the\nsusceptibilities of the respective transitions, in individual species,\ndestructively interfere leading to improved stability and reduced systematic\nshifts. We present and analyze two examples of such combinations. The first\nuses the optical quadrupole transitions in a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ - $^{174}$Yb$^+$\ntwo-ion crystal. The second is a superposition of optical quadrupole\ntransitions in one $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion and three $^{202}$Hg$^+$ ions. These\ncombinations have reduced susceptibility to external magnetic fields and\nblackbody radiation.\n", "  We study electroweak baryogenesis driven by the top quark in two Higgs\ndoublet model that allows flavor-changing neutral Higgs couplings. Taking Higgs\nsector couplings and the additional top Yukawa coupling $\\rho_{tt}$ to be\n$\\mathcal{O}$(1), one naturally has first order electroweak phase transition\nand sufficient $CP$ violation to fuel the cosmic baryon asymmetry. Even if\n$\\rho_{tt}$ vanishes, the favor-changing coupling $\\rho_{tc}$ can still achieve\nbaryogenesis. Phenomenological consequences such as $t\\to ch$, $\\tau \\to\n\\mu\\gamma$, electron electric dipole moment, $h\\to\\gamma\\gamma$, and $hhh$\ncoupling are discussed. The extra scalars $H^0$, $A^0$ and $H^\\pm$ are sub-TeV\nin mass, and can be searched for at the LHC.\n", "  The IVOA VOEvent Recommendation defines a means of describing transient\ncelestial events but, purposely, remains silent on the topic of how those\ndescriptions should be transmitted. This document formalizes a TCP-based\nprotocol for VOEvent transportation that has been in use by members of the\nVOEvent community for several years and discusses the topology of the event\ndistribution network. It is intended to act as a reference for the production\nof compliant protocol implementations.\n", "  The discussion regarding the numerical integration of the polarized radiative\ntransfer equation is still open and the comparison between the different\nnumerical schemes proposed by different authors in the past is not fully clear.\nAiming at facilitating the comprehension of the advantages and drawbacks of the\ndifferent formal solvers, this work presents a reference paradigm for their\ncharacterization based on the concepts of order of accuracy, stability, and\ncomputational cost. Special attention is paid to understand the numerical\nmethods belonging to the Diagonal Element Lambda Operator family, in an attempt\nto highlight their specificities.\n", "  When integrating the radiative transfer equation for polarized light, the\nnecessity of high-order numerical methods is well known. In fact,\nwell-performing high-order formal solvers enable higher accuracy and the use of\ncoarser spatial grids. Aiming to provide a clear comparison between formal\nsolvers, this work presents different high-order numerical schemes and applies\nthe systematic analysis proposed by Janett et al. (2017), emphasizing their\nadvantages and drawbacks in terms of order of accuracy, stability, and\ncomputational cost.\n", "  The paper reviews briefly elements from our work on the solution of various\nfield induced, time independent or time dependent many electron problems, which\nhas been developed and carried out within state and property specific\nframeworks. The discussion focuses on only a few items, and is presented as a\ncommentary with explanations. The formal details and the numerical results can\nbe found in the cited publications.\n", "  Interfacing a ferromagnet with a polarized ferroelectric gate generates a\nnon-uniform, interfacial spin density coupled to the ferroelectric polarization\nallowing so for an electric field control of effective transversal field to\nmagnetization. Here we study the dynamic magnetization switching behavior of\nsuch a multilayer system based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar equation,\ndemonstrating that interfacial magnetoelectric coupling is utilizable as a\nhighly localized and efficient tool for manipulating magnetism.\n", "  We present the science case and observations plan of the MeerKAT Fornax\nSurvey, an HI and radio continuum survey of the Fornax galaxy cluster to be\ncarried out with the SKA precursor MeerKAT. Fornax is the second most massive\ncluster within 20 Mpc and the largest nearby cluster in the southern\nhemisphere. Its low X-ray luminosity makes it representative of the environment\nwhere most galaxies live and where substantial galaxy evolution takes place.\nFornax's ongoing growth makes it an excellent laboratory for studying the\nassembly of clusters, the physics of gas accretion and stripping in galaxies\nfalling in the cluster, and the connection between these processes and the\nneutral medium in the cosmic web.\n  We will observe a region of 12 deg$^2$ reaching a projected distance of 1.5\nMpc from the cluster centre. This will cover a wide range of environment\ndensity out to the outskirts of the cluster, where gas-rich in-falling groups\nare found. We will: study the HI morphology of resolved galaxies down to a\ncolumn density of a few times 1e+19 cm$^{-2}$ at a resolution of 1 kpc; measure\nthe slope of the HI mass function down to M(HI) 5e+5 M(sun); and attempt to\ndetect HI in the cosmic web reaching a column density of 1e+18 cm$^{-2}$ at a\nresolution of 10 kpc.\n", "  Many physics signals presently studied at the high energy collision\nexperiments lead to final states with jets originating from heavy flavor\nquarks. This report reviews the algorithms for heavy flavor jets identification\ndeveloped by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in view of the Run2 data taking\nperiod at the Large Hadron Collider. The improvements of the algorithms used in\n2015 and 2016 data analyses with respect to previous data taking periods are\ndiscussed, as well as the ongoing developments in view of the next years of\ndata taking. The measurements of the performance of the algorithms on data as\nwell as the dedicated techniques for the identification of heavy flavor jets in\nevents with boosted topologies are also presented. Finally, the effectiveness\nof heavy flavor jet identification in the complex environment expected during\nthe high luminosity LHC phase is discussed.\n", "  New technologies are necessary for the unprecedented expansion of\nconnectivity and communications in the modern technological society. The\nspecific needs of wireless communication systems in 5G and beyond, as well as\ndevices for the future deployment of Internet of Things has caused that the\nInternational Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, which is the strategic\nplanning document of the semiconductor industry, considered since 2011,\ngraphene and related materials (GRMs) as promising candidates for the future of\nelectronics. Graphene, a one-atom-thick of carbon, is a promising material for\nhigh-frequency applications due to its intrinsic superior carrier mobility and\nvery high saturation velocity. These exceptional carrier transport properties\nsuggest that GRM-based field-effect transistors could potentially outperform\nother technologies.\n  This thesis presents a body of work on the modelling, performance prediction\nand simulation of GRM-based field-effect transistors and circuits. The main\ngoal of this work is to provide models and tools to ease the following issues:\n(i) gaining technological control of single layer and bilayer graphene devices\nand, more generally, devices based on 2D materials, (ii) assessment of\nradio-frequency (RF) performance and microwave stability, (iii) benchmarking\nagainst other existing technologies, (iv) providing guidance for device and\ncircuit design, (v) simulation of circuits formed by GRM-based transistors.\n", "  We systematically investigate the normal and superconducting properties of\nnon-centrosymmetric Re$_{6}$Zr using magnetization, heat capacity, and\nelectrical resistivity measurements. Resistivity measurements indicate\nRe$_{6}$Zr has poor metallic behavior and is dominated by disorder. Re$_6$Zr\nundergoes a superconducting transition at $T_{\\mathrm{c}} =\n\\left(6.75\\pm0.05\\right)$ K. Magnetization measurements give a lower critical\nfield, $\\mu_{0}H_{\\mathrm{c1}} = \\left(10.3 \\pm 0.1\\right)$ mT. The\nWerthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model is used to approximate the upper critical\nfield $\\mu_{0}H_{\\mathrm{c2}} = \\left(11.2 \\pm 0.2\\right)$ T which is close to\nthe Pauli limiting field of 12.35 T and which could indicate singlet-triplet\nmixing. However, low-temperature specific-heat data suggest that Re$_{6}$Zr is\nan isotropic, fully gapped s-wave superconductor with enhanced electron-phonon\ncoupling. Unusual flux pinning resulting in a peak effect is observed in the\nmagnetization data, indicating an unconventional vortex state.\n", "  A poor understanding of the impact of convective turbulence in the outer\nlayers of the Sun and Sun-like stars challenges the advance towards an improved\nunderstanding of their internal structure and dynamics. Assessing and\ncalibrating these effects is therefore of great importance. Here we study the\nspatial coherence of granulation noise and oscillation modes in the Sun, with\nthe aim of exploiting any incoherence to beat-down observed granulation noise,\nhence improving the detection of low-frequency p-modes. Using data from the\nBiSON 2B instrument, we assess the coherence between different atmospheric\nheights and between different surface regions. We find that granulation noise\nfrom the different atmospheric heights probed is largely incoherent; frequency\nregions dominated by oscillations are almost fully coherent. We find a\nrandomised phase difference for the granulation noise, and a near zero\ndifference for the evanescent oscillations. A reduction of the incoherent\ngranulation noise is shown by application of the cross-spectrum.\n", "  Over the last decade, Aperture Arrays (AA) have successfully replaced\nparabolic dishes as the technology of choice at low radio frequencies - good\nexamples are the MWA, LWA and LOFAR. Aperture Array based telescopes present\nseveral advantages, including sensitivity to the sky over a very wide\nfield-of-view. As digital and data processing systems continue to advance, an\nall-sky capability is set to emerge, even at GHz frequencies. We argue that\nassuming SETI events are both rare and transitory in nature, an instrument with\na large field-of-view, operating around the so-called water-hole (1-2 GHz),\nmight offer several advantages over contemporary searches. Sir Arthur C. Clarke\nwas the first to recognise the potential importance of an all-sky radio SETI\ncapability, as presented in his book, Imperial Earth. As part of the global SKA\n(Square Kilometre Array) project, a Mid-Frequency Aperture Array (MFAA)\nprototype known as MANTIS (Mid- Frequency Aperture Array Transient and\nIntensity-Mapping System) is now being considered as a precursor for SKA-2.\nMANTIS can be seen as a first step towards an all-sky radio SETI capability at\nGHz frequencies. This development has the potential to transform the field of\nSETI research, in addition to several other scientific programmes.\n", "  In the field of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies\nhave made huge progress during the last years and also reached the field of\neducation. The virtuality continuum, ranging from pure virtuality on one side\nto the real world on the other has been successfully covered by the use of\nimmersive technologies like head-mounted displays, which allow to embed virtual\nobjects into the real surroundings, leading to a Mixed Reality (MR) experience.\nIn such an environment digital and real objects do not only co-exist, but\nmoreover are also able to interact with each other in real-time. These concepts\ncan be used to merge human perception of reality with digitally visualized\nsensor data and thereby making the invisible visible. As a first example, in\nthis paper we introduce alongside the basic idea of this column an\nMR-experiment in thermodynamics for a laboratory course for freshman students\nin physics or other science and engineering subjects which uses physical data\nfrom mobile devices for analyzing and displaying physical phenomena to\nstudents.\n", "  We present the results of our spectroscopic study of the dwarf nova SS Cygni,\nusing Roche tomography to map the stellar surface and derive the system\nparameters. Given that this technique takes into account the inhomogeneous\nbrightness distribution on the surface of the secondary star, our derived\nparameters are (in principle) the most robust yet found for this system.\nFurthermore, our surface maps reveal that the secondary star is highly spotted,\nwith strongly asymmetric irradiation on the inner hemisphere. Moreover, by\nconstructing Doppler tomograms of several Balmer emission lines, we find strong\nasymmetric emission from the irradiated secondary star, and an asymmetric\naccretion disc that exhibits spiral structures.\n", "  The identification of hadronic tau lepton decays is an important requirement\nfor the LHC physics program, both in terms of standard model measurements and\nthe search for beyond-the-standard-model physics. The ATLAS and CMS algorithms\nfor identification and energy calibration of hadronic tau lepton decays are\nconceptually different. They are described together with measurements of\nrelevant performance figures.\n", "  We present a multiscale hybrid particle-field scheme for the simulation of\nrelaxation and diffusion behavior of soft condensed matter systems. It combines\nparticle-based Brownian dynamics and field-based local dynamics in an adaptive\nsense such that particles can switch their level of resolution on the fly. The\nswitching of resolution is controlled by a tuning function which can be chosen\nat will according to the geometry of the system. As an application, the hybrid\nscheme is used to study the kinetics of interfacial broadening of a polymer\nblend, and is validated by comparing the results to the predictions from pure\nBrownian dynamics and pure local dynamics calculations.\n", "  The bacterium Helicobacter pylori causes ulcers in the stomach of humans by\ninvading mucus layers protecting epithelial cells. It does so by chemically\nchanging the rheological properties of the mucus from a high-viscosity gel to a\nlow-viscosity solution in which it may self-propel. We develop a two-fluid\nmodel for this process of swimming under self-generated confinement. We solve\nexactly for the flow and the locomotion speed of a spherical swimmer located in\na spherically symmetric system of two Newtonian fluids whose boundary moves\nwith the swimmer. We also treat separately the special case of an immobile\nouter fluid. In all cases, we characterise the flow fields, their spatial\ndecay, and the impact of both the viscosity ratio and the degree of confinement\non the locomotion speed of the model swimmer. The spatial decay of the flow\nretains the same power-law decay as for locomotion in a single fluid but with a\ndecreased magnitude. Independently of the assumption chosen to characterise the\nimpact of confinement on the actuation applied by the swimmer, its locomotion\nspeed always decreases with an increase in the degree of confinement. Our\nmodelling results suggest that a low-viscosity region of at least six times the\neffective swimmer size is required to lead to swimming with speeds similar to\nlocomotion in an infinite fluid, corresponding to a region of size above\n$\\approx 25~\\mu$m for Helicobacter pylori.\n", "  Herein we survey the main results concerning quantum automata and machines\nwith classical control. These machines were originally proposed by Sernadas et\nal in [37], during the FCT QuantLog project. First, we focus on the\nexpressivity of quantum automata with both quantum and classical states. We\nrevise the result obtained in [32] where it was proved that such automata are\nable to recognise, with exponentially less states than deterministic finite\nautomata, a family of regular languages that cannot be recognised by other\ntypes of quantum automata. Finally, we revise the concept of quantum Turing\nmachine with classical control introduced in [25]. The novelty of these\nmachines consists in the fact that their termination problem is completely\ndeterministic, in opposition to other notions in the literature. Concretely, we\nrevisit the result that such machines fulfil the s-m-n property, while keeping\nthe expressivity of a quantum model for computation.\n", "  In relation to two meetings on stellar binary systems in July 2017, I\nsummarize my view that in the majority of strongly interacting stellar binary\nsystems jets play decisive roles. In the meeting The Physics of Evolved Stars\nII: The role of Binarity (Nice, July 10-13, 2017) many talks and posters were\nconcentrated on the shaping of circumstellar matter, with some significant new\nresults, like the observations of wide jets launched from binary systems. In\nthe meeting The Impact of Binaries on Stellar Evolution (ESO Garching, July\n3-7, 2017), both in the opening and the summary talks the speakers mentioned\nthat \"Textbooks need most likely to be rewritten\". I made my point that some\nnew chapters were already written, although researchers do not read them but\nrather keep referring to the `old textbooks'. For example, too many speakers\nand authors keep referring only to the single degenerate and double degenerate\nscenarios for the progenitors of SNe Ia. Researchers must refer also to the\n`new textbook chapter' on the core degenerate (CD) scenario. Other examples\ninvolve the role of jets. Jets lead to a new evolutionary phase, that of the\ngrazing envelope evolution (GEE), that should be considered alongside the older\nones, e.g., the common envelope evolution, Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), and wind\nmass loss and accretion. I discuss how the GEE can solve some puzzling binary\nsystems. We should also consider the role of jets as an extra energy source to\nremove the common envelope and in powering intermediate luminosity optical\ntransients (ILOTs). One strong advantage of jets is that in many cases they\noperate through a negative feedback mechanism, hence preventing the need for a\nfine tuning. The operation of the jet feedback mechanism (JFM) connects also\nbinary evolution to explosion of massive stars as core collapse supernovae.\n", "  A generalization of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to arbitrary dynamical\nsystems, including non-Hamiltonian ones, is considered. The generalized\nHamilton-Jacobi theory is constructed as a theory of ensemble of identical\nsystems moving in the configuration space and described by the continual\nequation of motion and the continuity equation. For Hamiltonian systems, the\nusual Hamilton-Jacobi equations naturally follow from this theory. The proposed\nformulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory, as the theory of ensemble, allows\ninterpreting in a natural way the transition from quantum mechanics in the\nSchrodinger's form to classical mechanics.\n", "  The location of the terrestrial magnetopause (MP) and it's subsolar stand-off\ndistance depends not only on the solar wind dynamic pressure and the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF), both of which play a crucial role in\ndetermining it's shape, but also on the nature of the processes involved in the\ninteraction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. The stand-off\ndistance of the earth's MP and bow shock (BS) also define the extent of\nterrestrial magnetic fields into near-earth space on the sunward side and have\nimportant consequences for space weather. However, asymmetries due to the\ndirection of the IMF are hard to account for, making it nearly impossible to\nfavour any specific model over the other in estimating the extent of the MP or\nBS. Thus, both numerical and empirical models have been used and compared to\nestimate the BS and MP stand-off distances as well as the MP shape, in the\nperiod Jan. 1975-Dec. 2016, covering solar cycles 21-24. The computed MP and BS\nstand-off distances have been found to be increasing steadily over the past two\ndecades, since ~1995, spanning solar cycles 23 and 24. The increasing trend is\nconsistent with earlier reported studies of a long term and steady decline in\nsolar polar magnetic fields and solar wind micro-turbulence levels. The present\nstudy, thus, highlights the response of the terrestrial magnetosphere to the\nlong term global changes in both solar and solar wind activity, through a\ndetailed study of the extent and shape of the terrestrial MP and BS over the\npast four solar cycles, a period spanning the last four decades.\n", "  In this paper, we base on the formalism of Symbolic Gauge Theory in the case\nof General relativity; we calculate the Feynman diagrams for the interaction\nbetween harmonic gravitational connections in the topological field theory.\nThese calculations provide insights to interactions between gravity and dark\nenergy. They could, therefore, have important repercussions for current\ncosmological problems.\n", "  Landau damping of head-tail modes in bunches due to spreads in the tune shift\ncan be a deciding factor for beam stability. We demonstrate that the coherent\ntune shifts due to reactive impedances can enhance the space-charge induced\ndamping and change the stability thresholds (here, a reactive impedance implies\nthe imaginary part of the impedance of both signs). For example, high damping\nrates at strong space-charge, or damping of the $k=0$ mode, can be possible. It\nis shown and explained, how the negative reactive impedances (causing negative\ncoherent tune shifts similarly to the effect of space-charge) can enhance the\nLandau damping, while the positive coherent tune shifts have an opposite\neffect. It is shown that the damping rate is a function of the coherent mode\nposition in the incoherent spectrum, in accordance with the concept of the\ninteraction of a collective mode with resonant particles. We present an\nanalytical model, which allows for quantitative predictions of damping\nthresholds for different head-tail modes, for arbitrary space-charge and\ncoherent tune-shift conditions, as it is verified using particle tracking\nsimulations.\n", "  Centimeter-sized single crystals of Sr$_{1.5}$La$_{0.5}$RhO$_{4}$ were grown\nby the floating zone method at oxygen pressures of 20~bar. The quality of our\nsingle crystals was confirmed by X-ray Laue, powder and single crystal X-ray\ndiffraction, neutron and X-ray absorbtion spectroscopy measurements. At\n$\\sim$50% electron doping we observe RhO$_3$ octahedral rotations of\n$\\sim$8.2$^{\\circ}$ within the octahedral basal plane which are incompatible\nwith space group I4/mmm. Our single crystal was further characterized by\nsusceptibility, electrical transport and, finally, specific heat measurements\nshowing a temperature dependent Debye temperature.\n", "  Regular monitoring of key water quality parameters is important for assessing\nits the hydrological status in conjunction with air-pollution interaction. In\nthis study, a new cost - effective technique based on the geo-ecological\ninformation-modeling system (GIMS) is implemented employing the combined use of\nsimulation experiments and in field observations to investigate the problem of\noptimizing water quality monitoring. The GIMS, is accompanied by 39 elements\nselected in 8 management systems and 31 functional elements, which are\ndescribed in detail. It is shown that the combined use of model and field\nobservations allows reliable recording of water quality and optimization of the\nmonitoring regime. Finally, simulation experiments in a lagoon are presented,\ndemonstrating the fidelity of the proposed modelling system to optimize water\nquality control through regular in field measurements and simulations.\n", "  Using LOFAR, we have performed a very-low-frequency (115-155 MHz) radio\nsurvey for millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The survey targeted 52 unidentified\nFermi $\\gamma$-ray sources. Employing a combination of coherent and incoherent\ndedispersion, we have mitigated the dispersive effects of the interstellar\nmedium while maintaining sensitivity to fast-spinning pulsars. Toward 3FGL\nJ1553.1+5437 we have found PSR J1552+5437, the first MSP to be discovered\n(through its pulsations) at a radio frequency $<$ 200 MHz. PSR J1552+5437 is an\nisolated MSP with a 2.43 ms spin period and a dispersion measure of 22.9 pc\ncm$^{-3}$. The pulsar has a very steep radio spectral index ($\\alpha < -$2.8\n$\\pm$ 0.4). We obtain a phase-connected timing solution combining the 0.74\nyears of radio observations with $\\gamma$-ray photon arrival times covering 7.5\nyears of Fermi observations. We find that the radio and $\\gamma$-ray pulse\nprofiles of PSR J1552+5437 appear to be nearly aligned. The very steep spectrum\nof PSR J1552+5437, along with other recent discoveries, hints at a population\nof radio MSPs that have been missed in surveys using higher observing\nfrequencies. Detecting such steep spectrum sources is important for mapping the\npopulation of MSPs down to the shortest spin periods, understanding their\nemission in comparison to slow pulsars, and quantifying the prospects for\nfuture surveys with low-frequency radio telescopes like SKA-Low and its\nprecursors.\n", "  We report the discovery of PSR J0952$-$0607, a 707-Hz binary millisecond\npulsar which is now the fastest-spinning neutron star known in the Galactic\nfield (i.e., outside of a globular cluster). PSR J0952$-$0607 was found using\nLOFAR at a central observing frequency of 135 MHz, well below the 300 MHz to 3\nGHz frequencies typically used in pulsar searches. The discovery is part of an\nongoing LOFAR survey targeting unassociated Fermi Large Area Telescope\n$\\gamma$-ray sources. PSR J0952$-$0607 is in a 6.42-hr orbit around a very\nlow-mass companion ($M_\\mathrm{c}\\gtrsim0.02$ M$_\\odot$) and we identify a\nstrongly variable optical source, modulated at the orbital period of the\npulsar, as the binary companion. The light curve of the companion varies by 1.6\nmag from $r^\\prime=22.2$ at maximum to $r^\\prime>23.8$, indicating that it is\nirradiated by the pulsar wind. Swift observations place a 3-$\\sigma$ upper\nlimit on the $0.3-10$ keV X-ray luminosity of $L_X < 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ (using the 0.97 kpc distance inferred from the dispersion measure).\nThough no eclipses of the radio pulsar are observed, the properties of the\nsystem classify it as a black widow binary. The radio pulsed spectrum of PSR\nJ0952$-$0607, as determined through flux density measurements at 150 and 350\nMHz, is extremely steep with $\\alpha\\sim-3$ (where $S \\propto \\nu^{\\alpha}$).\nWe discuss the growing evidence that the fastest-spinning radio pulsars have\nexceptionally steep radio spectra, as well as the prospects for finding more\nsources like PSR J0952$-$0607.\n", "  We consider the motion of a nonrelativistic electron in the field of two\nstrong monochromatic light waves propagating counter to each other. The matrix\nelements of emission and absorption are found. An expression is obtained for\nthe gain of a weak test wave by using such matrix elements.\n", "  With the aim to describe the longitudinal development of Cherenkov dominated\nshowers we investigate the energy deposit and the number of charged particles\nin air showers induced by energetic cosmic rays. Based on the Monte Carlo\nsimulations, discrepancies between different estimates of calorimetric energies\nare documented. We focus on the energy deposit profiles of air showers\ndeducible from the fluorescence and Cherenkov light generated along CONEX and\nCORSIKA cascades.\n", "  Behavior analogous to that of spontaneous emission in photonic band gap\nmaterials has been predicted for an atom-optical system consisting of an atom\nconfined in a well of a state-dependent optical lattice that is coupled to free\nspace through an internal-state transition [de Vega et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n101, 260404 (2008)]. Using the Weisskopf-Wigner approach and considering a\none-dimensional geometry, we analyze the properties of this system in detail,\nincluding the evolution of the lattice-trapped population, the momentum\ndistribution of emitted matter waves, and the detailed structure of an\nevanescent matter-wave state below the continuum boundary. We compare and\ncontrast our findings for the transition from Markovian to non-Markovian\nbehaviors to those previously obtained for three dimensions.\n", "  Self-assembly processes allow us to design and create complex nanostructures\nusing molecules as building blocks and surfaces as scaffolds. This autonomous\ndriven construction is possible due to a complex thermodynamic balance of\nmolecule-surface interactions. As such, nanoscale guidance and control over\nthis process is hard to achieve. Here we use the highly localized\nlight-to-chemical-energy conversion of plasmonic materials to spatially cleave\nAu-S bonds on pre-determined locations within a single nanoparticle, enabling\nunprecedented control over this archetypal system for molecular self-assembly.\nOur method offers nanoscale precision and high-throughput light-induced\ntailoring of the surface chemistry of individual and packed nano-sized metallic\nstructures by simply varying wavelength and polarization of the incident light.\nAssisted by single-molecule super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we image,\nquantify and shed light onto the plasmon-induced desorption mechanism. We show\nthat plasmon-induced photo-desorption enables sub-diffraction multiplexing,\nselective positioning of nanomaterials and even sorting and purification of\ncolloidal nanoparticles.\n", "  Nanomechanical resonators offer important benefits for the sensing of\nphysical stimuli such as the mass of an added molecule. To map out the local\nshape properties of the physical stimuli, such as the distribution of the mass\ndensity of a molecule, sensory information should be collected through multiple\nmodes of a mechanical sensor. By utilizing the specific mode shapes, the\nspatial distribution of a physical stimulus can be reverse calculated. However,\nthe mode shapes of a sensor may deviate from their ideal forms once analytes\nstart to accumulate on the sensor. As a result, algorithms based on the ideal\nform of the mode shapes no longer work accurately. Here, we developed a\ntheoretical framework to calculate the change in the mode shapes of a\nnanomechanical beam after analyte adsorption. We verified the theoretical model\nby performing finite element simulations and comparing the change in the mode\nshapes obtained from each approach. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to\nrelate the maximum deviation in the mode shapes to the surface roughness of the\nsensor after analyte accumulation. By predicting the change in the mode shapes\nand using the corrected forms, the accuracy of the nanomechanical sensing can\nbe improved significantly.\n", "  We compare two order parameters for the deconfinement transition, induced by\nthermal and density effects, commonly used in the literature, namely the\nthermal and density evolution of the continuum threshold $s_{0}$, within the\nframe of the QCD sum rules, and the trace of the Polyakov loop $\\Phi$ in the\nframework of a nonlocal $SU(2)$ chiral quark model. We include in our\ndiscussion the evolution of the chiral quark condensate, the parameter that\ncharacterizes the chiral symmetry restoration. We found that essentially both\norder parameters, $s_{0}$ and $\\Phi$, provide the same information for the\ndeconfinement transition, both for the zero and finite chemical potential\ncases. At zero density, the critical temperatures in both cases coincide\nexactly and, in the case of finite baryonic chemical potential $\\mu$, we find\nevidence for the appearance of a quarkyonic phase.\n", "  Most counterparts of the identified low-latitude gamma-ray sources are\nIsolated Neutron Stars (INSs). They are characterized by an extremely high\nvalue of the X/optical flux ratio, therefore a systematic X-ray/optical\ncoverage of the fields of unidentified low-latitude gamma-ray sources is the\nbest way to unveil possible INS counterparts. Since the low-latitude sources\nare heavily affected by the interstellar absorption in both the X-ray and\noptical bands, we decided to apply the above strategy to two middle-latitude\nEGRET sources, which could belong to a local galactic population: 3EG\nJ0616-3310 and 3EG J1249-8330. Here we report on the global X-ray\ncharacterisation of about 300 objects, on their candidate optical counterparts\nand on the preliminary results of their identification.\n", "  Within the effective interfacial Hamiltonian approach we evaluate the excess\nline free energy associated with cylinder-shaped droplets sessile on a\nstripe-like chemical inhomogeneity of a planar substrate. In the case of\nshort-range intermolecular forces the droplet morphology and the corresponding\nexpression for the line tension - which includes the inhomogeneity finite width\neffects - are derived and discussed as functions of temperature and increasing\nwidth. The width-dependent contributions to the line tension change their\nstructure at the stripe wetting temperature T_W1: for T<T_W1 they decay\nexponentially while for T>T_W1 the decay is algebraic. In addition, a geometric\nconstruction of the corresponding contact angle is carried out and its\nimplications are discussed.\n", "  The CRESST experiment seeks hypothetical WIMP particles that could account\nfor the bulk of dark matter in the Universe. The detectors are cryogenic\ncalorimeters in which WIMPs would scatter elastically on nuclei, releasing\nphonons. The first phase of the experiment has successfully deployed several\n262 g sapphire devices in the Gran Sasso underground laboratories. A main\nsource of background has been identified as microscopic mechanical fracturing\nof the crystals, and has been eliminated, improving the background rate by up\nto three orders of magnitude at low energies, leaving a rate close to one count\nper day per kg and per keV above 10 keV recoil energy. This background now\nappears to be dominated by radioactivity, and future CRESST scintillating\ncalorimeters which simultaneously measure light and phonons will allow\nrejection of a great part of it.\n", "  The data on atmospheric neutrinos can be explained assuming the existence of\noscillations between muon neutrinos and light sterile neutrinos with mixing\nclose to maximal, and Delta_m^2 approximately equal to 3 E-3 (eV^2). This\ninterpretation of the data is in potential conflict with the successes of big\nbang nucleosynthesis (BBN), since oscillations can result in a too large\ncontribution of the sterile state to the energy density of the universe at the\nepoch of nucleosynthesis. The possibility to evade these cosmological\nconstraints has been recently the object of some controversy. In this work we\nrediscuss this problem and find that the inclusion of a small mixing of the\nsterile state with tau neutrino can result in the generation of a large lepton\nasymmetry that strongly suppress the muon-sterile neutrino oscillations\neliminating the possible conflict with BBN bounds. In this scheme the mass of\nthe tau neutrino must be larger than few eV's and is compatible with\ncosmological bounds. Our calculation is performed using a Pauli-Boltzmann\nmethod. In this approach it is also possible to develop analytic calculations\nthat allow physical insight in the processes considered and give support to the\nnumerical results.\n", "  A measurement of direct photon production in Pb+Pb collisions at 158 AGeV has\nbeen carried out in the CERN WA98 experiment. The invariant yield of direct\nphotons in central collisions is extracted as a function of transverse momentum\nin the interval 0.5 < pT < 4 GeV/c. A significant direct photon signal,\ncompared to statistical and systematical errors, is seen at pT > 1.5 GeV/c. The\nresults constitute the first observation of direct photons in ultrarelativistic\nheavy-ion collisions which could be significant for diagnosis of quark gluon\nplasma formation.\n"]}
