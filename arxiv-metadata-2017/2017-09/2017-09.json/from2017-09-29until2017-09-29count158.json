In this method the FRW dynamical\nsystem with dark energy is reconstructed instead of the equation of state\nparameter. We give several examples which illustrate the usefulness of our\nmethod in fitting the redshift transition from the decelerating to accelerating\nphase as the value of the Hubble function at the transition.\n", "  Recent astronomical observations have indicated that the Universe is in the\nphase of accelerated expansion. While there are many cosmological models which\ntry to explain this phenomenon, we focus on the interacting $\\Lambda$CDM model\nwhere the interaction between the dark energy and dark matter sectors takes\nplace. This model is compared to its simpler alternative---the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel. To choose between these models the likelihood ratio test was applied as\nwell as the model comparison methods (employing Occam's principle): the Akaike\ninformation criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the\nBayesian evidence. Using the current astronomical data: SNIa (Union2.1),\n$h(z)$, BAO, Alcock--Paczynski test and CMB we evaluated both models. The\nanalyses based on the AIC indicated that there is less support for the\ninteracting $\\Lambda$CDM model when compared to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, while\nthose based on the BIC indicated that there is the strong evidence against it\nin favor the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Given the weak or almost none support for the\ninteracting $\\Lambda$CDM model and bearing in mind Occam's razor we are\ninclined to reject this model.\n", "  We consider the Burgers-type system studied by Foursov, w_t &=& w_{xx} + 8 w\nw_x + (2-4\\alpha)z z_x, z_t &=& (1-2\\alpha)z_{xx} - 4\\alpha z w_x +\n(4-8\\alpha)w z_x - (4+8\\alpha)w^2 z + (-2+4\\alpha)z^3, (*) for which no\nrecursion operator or master symmetry was known so far, and prove that the\nsystem (*) admits infinitely many local generalized symmetries that are\nconstructed using a nonlocal {\\em two-term} recursion relation rather than from\na recursion operator.\n", "  In the present paper we extend the multiparameter coupling constant\nmetamorphosis, also known as the generalized St\\\"ackel transform, from\nHamiltonian dynamical systems to general finite-dimensional dynamical systems\nand ODEs. This transform interchanges the values of integrals of motion with\nthe parameters these integrals depend on but leaves the phase space coordinates\nintact. Sufficient conditions under which the transformation in question\npreserves integrability and a simple formula relating the solutions of the\noriginal system to those of the transformed one are given.\n", "  The production of mesons containing strange quarks (K$^0_s$, $\\phi$) and both\nsingly and doubly strange baryons ($\\Lambda$, Anti-$\\Lambda$, and\n$\\Xi$+Anti-$\\Xi$) are measured at central rapidity in pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The results are\nobtained from the analysis of about 250 k minimum bias events recorded in 2009.\nMeasurements of yields (dN/dy) and transverse momentum spectra at central\nrapidities for inelastic pp collisions are presented. For mesons, we report\nyields (<dN/dy>) of 0.184 $\\pm$ 0.002 stat. $\\pm$ 0.006 syst. for K$^0_s$ and\n0.021 $\\pm$ 0.004 stat. $\\pm$ 0.003 syst. for $\\phi$. For baryons, we find\n<dN/dy> = 0.048 $\\pm$ 0.001 stat. $\\pm$ 0.004 syst. for $\\Lambda$, 0.047 $\\pm$\n0.002 stat. $\\pm$ 0.005 syst. for Anti-$\\Lambda$ and 0.0101 $\\pm$ 0.0020 stat.\n$\\pm$ 0.0009 syst. for $\\Xi$+Anti-$\\Xi$. The results are also compared with\npredictions for identified particle spectra from QCD-inspired models and\nprovide a baseline for comparisons with both future pp measurements at higher\nenergies and heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  We report on the high statistics two-pion correlation functions from pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=0.9$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV, measured by the ALICE\nexperiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The correlation functions as well as\nthe extracted source radii scale with event multiplicity and pair momentum.\nWhen analyzed in the same multiplicity and pair transverse momentum range, the\ncorrelation is similar at the two collision energies. A three-dimensional\nfemtoscopic analysis shows an increase of the emission zone with increasing\nevent multiplicity as well as decreasing homogeneity lengths with increasing\ntransverse momentum. The latter trend gets more pronounced as multiplicity\nincreases. This suggests the development of space-momentum correlations, at\nleast for collisions producing a high multiplicity of particles. We consider\nthese trends in the context of previous femtoscopic studies in high-energy\nhadron and heavy-ion collisions, and discuss possible underlying physics\nmechanisms. Detailed analysis of the correlation reveals an exponential shape\nin the outward and longitudinal directions, while the sideward remains a\nGaussian. This is interpreted as a result of a significant contribution of\nstrongly decaying resonances to the emission region shape. Significant\nnon-femtoscopic correlations are observed, and are argued to be the consequence\nof \"mini-jet\"-like structures extending to low $p_{\\rm T}$. They are well\nreproduced by the Monte-Carlo generators and seen also in $\\pi^+\\pi^-$\ncorrelations.\n", "  The production of $\\pi^+$, $\\pi^-$, $K^+$, $K^-$, p, and pbar at mid-rapidity\nhas been measured in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 900$ GeV with the\nALICE detector. Particle identification is performed using the specific energy\nloss in the inner tracking silicon detector and the time projection chamber. In\naddition, time-of-flight information is used to identify hadrons at higher\nmomenta. Finally, the distinctive kink topology of the weak decay of charged\nkaons is used for an alternative measurement of the kaon transverse momentum\n($p_{\\rm T}$) spectra. Since these various particle identification tools give\nthe best separation capabilities over different momentum ranges, the results\nare combined to extract spectra from $p_{\\rm T}$ = 100 MeV/$c$ to 2.5 GeV/$c$.\nThe measured spectra are further compared with QCD-inspired models which yield\na poor description. The total yields and the mean $p_{\\rm T}$ are compared with\nprevious measurements, and the trends as a function of collision energy are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The ALICE experiment at the LHC has studied inclusive J/$\\psi$ production at\ncentral and forward rapidities in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. In this\nLetter, we report on the first results obtained detecting the J/$\\psi$ through\nits dilepton decay into $e^+e^-$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ pairs in the rapidity range\n|y|<0.9 and 2.5<y<4, respectively, and with acceptance down to zero $p_{\\rm\nT}$. In the dielectron channel the analysis was carried out on a data sample\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity $L_{\\rm int}$ = 5.6 nb$^{-1}$ and the\nnumber of signal events is $N_{J/\\psi}=352 \\pm 32$ (stat.) $\\pm$ 28 (syst.);\nthe corresponding figures in the dimuon channel are $L_{\\rm int}$ = 15.6\nnb$^{-1}$ and $N_{J/\\psi} = 1924 \\pm 77$ (stat.) $\\pm$ 144(syst.). The measured\nproduction cross sections are $\\sigma_{J/\\psi}$ (|y|<0.9) = 12.4 $\\pm$ 1.1\n(stat.) $\\pm$ 1.8 (syst.) + 1.8 -2.7 (syst.pol.) $\\mu$b and $\\sigma_{J/\\psi}$\n(2.5<y<4) = 6.31 $\\pm$ 0.25 (stat.) $\\pm$ 0.76 (syst.) +0.95 -1.96 (syst.pol.)\n$\\mu$b. The differential cross sections, in transverse momentum and rapidity,\nof the J/$\\psi$ were also measured.\n", "  We report on the first measurement of the triangular $v_3$, quadrangular\n$v_4$, and pentagonal $v_5$ charged particle flow in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76\nTeV measured with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We show\nthat the triangular flow can be described in terms of the initial spatial\nanisotropy and its fluctuations, which provides strong constraints on its\norigin. In the most central events, where the elliptic flow $v_2$ and $v_3$\nhave similar magnitude, a double peaked structure in the two-particle azimuthal\ncorrelations is observed, which is often interpreted as a Mach cone response to\nfast partons. We show that this structure can be naturally explained from the\nmeasured anisotropic flow Fourier coefficients.\n", "  The production of muons from heavy flavour decays is measured at forward\nrapidity in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV collected with the\nALICE experiment at the LHC. The analysis is carried out on a data sample\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity $L_{\\rm int} = 16.5$ nb$^{-1}$. The\ntransverse momentum and rapidity differential production cross sections of\nmuons from heavy flavour decays are measured in the rapidity range 2.5 < y < 4,\nover the transverse momentum range 2 < $p_{\\rm T}$ < 12 GeV/$c$. The results\nare compared to predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations.\n", "  The differential production cross section of electrons from semileptonic\nheavy-flavour hadron decays has been measured at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 0.5$) in\nproton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV with ALICE at the LHC. Electrons\nwere measured in the transverse momentum range 0.5 $<p_{\\rm T}<$ 8 GeV/$c$.\nPredictions from a fixed order perturbative QCD calculation with\nnext-to-leading-log resummation agree with the data within the theoretical and\nexperimental uncertainties.\n", "  We report the crystallographic texture of ZnO thin films comprising nanorods\ngrown by a microwave irradiation assisted method. Different substrates were\nused, namely Si, Ge, metal coated Si, PMMA coated Si and ITO coated glass, to\nexamine the respective development of crystallographic texture. The films were\ncharacterized by Xray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, while the\ntexture analysis was done by Xray pole figure analysis using the Schultz\nreflection method. The ZnO film deposited on Si and Ge showed a mixed texture.\nOn all the other substrates, c axis oriented ZnO films were obtained.\n", "  In this write-up we present the general theory of the signal formation in\nvarious detectors. We follow a pedagogical analysis and presentation such that\nthe results could be easily understood and applied by the interested reader to\nthe different detector configurations. We include few applications to gaseous\ndetectors, namely, Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) and micro-pattern gaseous\ndetectors of the Micromegas type.\n", "  We present a simple novel construction of recursion operators for integrable\nmultidimensional dispersionless systems that admit a Lax pair whose operators\nare linear in the spectral parameter and do not involve the derivatives with\nrespect to the latter. New examples of recursion operators obtained using our\ntechnique include {\\em inter alia} those for the general heavenly equation,\nwhich describes a class of anti-self-dual solutions of the vacuum Einstein\nequations, and a six-dimensional equation resulting from a system of Ferapontov\nand Khusnutdinova.\n", "  Within the quantum mechanical treatment of the decay problem one finds that\nat late times $t$ the survival probability of an unstable state cannot have the\nform of an exponentially decreasing function of time $t$ but it has an inverse\npower-like form. This is a general property of unstable states following from\nbasic principles of quantum theory. The consequence of this property is that in\nthe case of false vacuum states the cosmological constant becomes dependent on\ntime: $\\Lambda - \\Lambda_{\\text{bare}}\\equiv \\Lambda(t) -\\Lambda_{\\text{bare}}\n\\sim 1/t^{2}$. We construct the cosmological model with decaying vacuum energy\ndensity and matter for solving the cosmological constant problem and the\ncoincidence problem. We show the equivalence of the proposed decaying false\nvacuum cosmology with the $\\Lambda(t)$ cosmologies (the $\\Lambda(t)$CDM\nmodels). The cosmological implications of the model of decaying vacuum energy\n(dark energy) are discussed. We constrain the parameters of the model with\ndecaying vacuum using astronomical data. For this aim we use the observation of\ndistant supernovae of type Ia, measurements of $H(z)$, BAO, CMB and others. The\nmodel analyzed is in good agreement with observation data and explain a small\nvalue of the cosmological constant today.\n", "  We review some rigorous results on the equilibrium and non-equilibrium\nproperties of superfluids and superconductors.\n", "  We study dynamics of $\\Lambda(t)$ cosmological models which are a natural\ngeneralization of the standard cosmological model (the $\\Lambda$CDM model). We\nconsider a class of models: the ones with a prescribed form of\n$\\Lambda(t)=\\Lambda_{\\text{bare}}+\\frac{\\alpha^2}{t^2}$. This type of a\n$\\Lambda(t)$ parametrization is motivated by different cosmological approaches.\nWe interpret the model with running Lambda ($\\Lambda(t)$) as a special model of\nan interacting cosmology with the interaction term $-d\\Lambda(t)/dt$ in which\nenergy transfer is between dark matter and dark energy sectors. For the\n$\\Lambda(t)$ cosmology with a prescribed form of $\\Lambda(t)$ we have found the\nexact solution in the form of Bessel functions. Our model shows that fractional\ndensity of dark energy $\\Omega_e$ is constant and close to zero during the\nearly evolution of the universe.\n  We have also constrained the model parameters for this class of models using\nthe astronomical data such as SNIa data, BAO, CMB, measurements of $H(z)$ and\nthe Alcock-Paczy{\\'n}ski test. In this context we formulate a simple criterion\nof variability of $\\Lambda$ with respect to $t$ in terms of variability of the\njerk or sign of estimator $(1-\\Omega_{\\text{m},0}-\\Omega_{\\Lambda,0})$. The\ncase study of our model enable us to find an upper limit $\\alpha^2 < 0.012$\n($2\\sigma$ C.L.) describing the variation from the cosmological constant while\nthe LCDM model seems to be consistent with various data.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of the generalized $\\Lambda$CDM model, which the\n$\\Lambda$ term is running with the cosmological time. The $\\Lambda(t)$ term\nemerges from the covariant theory of the scalar field $\\phi$ with the\nself-interacting potential $V(\\phi)$. On the example of the model\n$\\Lambda(t)=\\Lambda_{\\text{bare}}+\\frac{\\alpha^2}{t^2}$ we show the existence\nof a mechanism of the modification of the scaling law for energy density of\ndark matter: $\\rho_{\\text{dm}}\\propto a^{-3+\\lambda(t)}$. We discuss the\nevolution of $\\Lambda(t)$ term and pointed out that during the cosmic evolution\nthere is a long phase in which this term is approximately constant. This effect\njustifies Alcaniz and Lima's approach to $\\Lambda(H)$ cosmologies. We also\npresent the statistical analysis of both the $\\Lambda(t)$CDM model with dark\nenergy and decaying dark matter and the $\\Lambda$CDM standard cosmological\nmodel. We divide the observational data into two groups: low $z$ data (SNIa,\nBAO, $H(z)$ and AP test) and high $z$ data (Planck, WP and lensing). While for\nthe former we find the best fit value of the parameter $\\lambda$ is positive\n($\\lambda=0.0338$, energy transfer is from the dark energy to dark matter\nsector), for the latter we find that $\\lambda$ is $-0.0199$ which is an\nevidence that the energy transfer is from decaying dark matter. This\ndisagreement correlates with estimated values of $H_0$ ($67.77$ km/(s Mpc) and\n$65.62$ km/(s Mpc) respectively). The decaying dark matter causes to lowering a\nmass of dark matter particles which are lighter than CDM particles and remain\nrelativistic. The rate of the process of decaying matter is estimated. We show\nthat in the models of decaying dark matter, the cosmological constant problem\ndisappears naturally. The model with decaying dark matter possesses one\nparameter more but in light of the AIC it is better than the $\\Lambda$CDM\nstandard cosmological model.\n", "  We establish a generic method to analyze the time evolution of open quantum\nmany-body systems. Our approach is based on a variational integration of the\nquantum master equation describing the dynamics and naturally connects to a\nvariational principle for its nonequilibrium steady state. We successfully\napply our variational method to study dissipative Rydberg gases, finding\nexcellent quantitative agreement with small-scale simulations of the full\nquantum master equation. We observe that correlations related to non-Markovian\nbehavior play a significant role during the relaxation dynamics towards the\nsteady state. We further quantify this non-Markovianity and find it to be\nclosely connected to an information-theoretical measure of quantum and\nclassical correlations.\n", "  We give a complete description of generalized symmetries and local\nconservation laws for the fifth-order Karczewska--Rozmej--Rutkowski--Infeld\nequation describing shallow water waves in a channel with variable depth. In\nparticular, we show that this equation has no genuinely generalized symmetries\nand thus is not symmetry integrable.\n", "  We construct an infinite hierarchy of nonlocal conservation laws for the\n$ABC$ equation $A u_t\\,u_{xy}+B u_x\\,u_{ty}+C u_y\\,u_{tx} = 0$, where $A,B,C$\nare constants and $A+B+C\\neq 0$, using a nonisospectral Lax pair. As a\nbyproduct, we present new coverings for the ABC equation. The method of proof\nof nontriviality of the conservation laws under study is quite general and can\nbe applied to many other integrable multidimensional systems.\n", "  We investigate further (cf. arXiv:1512.01199, JCAP01 (2016) 040) Starobinsky\ncosmological model $R+\\gamma R^2$ in the Palatini formalism with Chaplygin gas\nand baryonic matter as a source. For this aim we use dynamical system theory.\nThe dynamics is reduced to the 2D sewn dynamical system of a Newtonian type (a\npiecewise-smooth dynamical system). We classify all evolutional paths in the\nmodel as well as trajectories in the phase space. We demonstrate the presence\nof a degenerate freeze singularity (glued freeze type singularities) for the\npositive $\\gamma$. In this case it is a generic feature of early evolution of\nthe universe. We point out that a degenerate type III of singularity can be\nconsidered as an endogenous model of inflation between the matter dominating\nepoch and the dark energy phase. We also investigate cosmological models with\nnegative $\\gamma$. It is demonstrated that $\\gamma$ equal zero is a bifurcation\nparameter and dynamics qualitatively changes in comparison to positive\n$\\gamma$. Instead of the big bang the sudden bounce singularity of a finite\nscale factor appears and there is a generic class of bouncing solutions sewn\nalong the line $a=a_{\\text{sing}}$. And we argue that the presence of sudden\nsingularities in an evolutional scenario of the Universe falsifies the negative\n$\\gamma$ in the Palatini cosmology. Only very small values of $\\Omega_{\\gamma}$\nparameter are admissible if we requires that agreements physics with the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. From the statistical analysis of astronomical observations,\nwe deduce that the case of negative values of $\\Omega_\\gamma$ can be rejected\neven if it may fit better to the data.\n", "  We discussed the dynamics of cosmological models in which the cosmological\nconstant term is a time dependent function through the scale factor $a(t)$,\nHubble function $H(t)$, Ricci scalar $R(t)$ and scalar field $\\phi(t)$. We\nconsidered five classes of models; two non-covariant parametrization of\n$\\Lambda$: 1) $\\Lambda(H)$CDM cosmologies where $H(t)$ is the Hubble parameter,\n2) $\\Lambda(a)$CDM cosmologies where $a(t)$ is the scale factor, and three\ncovariant parametrization of $\\Lambda$: 3) $\\Lambda(R)$CDM cosmologies, where\n$R(t)$ is the Ricci scalar, 4) $\\Lambda(\\phi)$-cosmologies with diffusion, 5)\n$\\Lambda(X)$-cosmologies, where\n$X=\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\nabla_{\\alpha}\\nabla_{\\beta}\\phi$ is a kinetic\npart of density of the scalar field. We also considered the case of an emergent\n$\\Lambda(a)$ relation obtained from the behavior of trajectories in a\nneighborhood of an invariant submanifold. In study of dynamics we use dynamical\nsystem methods for investigating how a evolutional scenario can depend on the\nchoice of special initial conditions. We showed that methods of dynamical\nsystems offer the possibility of investigation all admissible solutions of a\nrunning $\\Lambda$ cosmology for all initial conditions, their stability,\nasymptotic states as well as a nature of the evolution in the early universe\n(singularity or bounce) and a long term behavior at the large times. We also\nformulated an idea of the emergent cosmological term derived directly from an\napproximation of exact dynamics. We show that some non-covariant\nparametrizations of Lambda term like $\\Lambda(a)$, $\\Lambda(H)$ give rise to\npathological and nonphysical behaviour of trajectories in the phase space. This\nbehaviour disappears if the term $\\Lambda(a)$ is emergent from the covariant\nparametrization.\n", "  Consider the Abelian sandpile measure on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \\ge 2$, obtained\nas the $L \\to \\infty$ limit of the stationary distribution of the sandpile on\n$[-L,L]^d \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^d$. When adding a grain of sand at the origin, some\nregion, called the avalanche cluster, topples during stabilization. We prove\nbounds on the behaviour of various avalanche characteristics: the probability\nthat a given vertex topples, the radius of the toppled region, and the number\nof vertices toppled. Our results yield rigorous inequalities for the relevant\ncritical exponents. In $d = 2,$ we show that for any $1 \\le k < \\infty$, the\nlast $k$ waves of the avalanche have an infinite volume limit, satisfying a\npower law upper bound on the tail of the radius distribution.\n", "  We outline a procedure for using matrix mechanics to compute energy\neigenvalues and eigenstates for two and three interacting particles in a\nconfining trap, in one dimension. Such calculations can bridge a gap in the\nundergraduate physics curriculum between single-particle and many-particle\nquantum systems, and can also provide a pathway from standard quantum mechanics\ncourse material to understanding current research on cold-atom systems. In\nparticular we illustrate the notion of \"fermionization\" and how it occurs not\nonly for the ground state in the presence of strong repulsive interactions, but\nalso for excited states, in both the strongly attractive and strongly repulsive\nregimes.\n", "  The repulsive Hubbard Hamiltonian is one of the foundational models\ndescribing strongly correlated electrons and is believed to capture essential\naspects of high temperature superconductivity. Ultracold fermions in optical\nlattices allow for the simulation of the Hubbard Hamiltonian with a unique\ncontrol over kinetic energy, interactions and doping. A great challenge is to\nreach the required low entropy and to observe antiferromagnetic spin\ncorrelations beyond nearest neighbors, for which quantum gas microscopes are\nideal. Here we report on the direct, single-site resolved detection of\nantiferromagnetic correlations extending up to three sites in spin-$1/2$\nHubbard chains, which requires an entropy well below $s^*=\\ln(2)$. Finally, the\nsimultaneous detection of spin and density opens the route towards the study of\nthe interplay between magnetic ordering and doping in various dimensions.\n", "  We analyze theoretically the many-body dynamics of a dissipative Ising model\nin a transverse field using a variational approach. We find that the steady\nstate phase diagram is substantially modified compared to its equilibrium\ncounterpart, including the appearance of a multicritical point belonging to a\ndifferent universality class. Building on our variational analysis, we\nestablish a field-theoretical treatment corresponding to a dissipative variant\nof a Ginzburg-Landau theory, which allows us to compute the upper critical\ndimension of the system. Finally, we present a possible experimental\nrealization of the dissipative Ising model using ultracold Rydberg gases.\n", "  Quantum teleportation, the process by which Alice can transfer an unknown\nquantum state to Bob by using pre-shared entanglement and classical\ncommunication, is one of the cornerstones of quantum information. The standard\nbenchmark for certifying quantum teleportation consists in surpassing the\nmaximum average fidelity between the teleported and the target states that can\nbe achieved classically. According to this figure of merit, not all entangled\nstates are useful for teleportation. Here we propose a new benchmark that uses\nthe full information available in a teleportation experiment and prove that all\nentangled states can implement a quantum channel which can not be reproduced\nclassically. We introduce the idea of non-classical teleportation witness to\ncertify if a teleportation experiment is genuinely quantum and discuss how to\nquantify this phenomenon. Our work provides new techniques for studying\nteleportation that can be immediately applied to certify the quality of quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "  Collaborations and citations within scientific research grow simultaneously\nand interact dynamically. Modelling the coevolution between them helps to study\nmany phenomena that can be approached only through combining citation and\ncoauthorship data. A geometric graph for the coevolution is proposed, the\nmechanism of which synthetically expresses the interactive impacts of authors\nand papers in a geometrical way. The model is validated against a data set of\npapers published on PNAS during 2007-2015. The validation shows the ability to\nreproduce a range of features observed with citation and coauthorship data\ncombined and separately. Particularly, in the empirical distribution of\ncitations per author there exist two limits, in which the distribution appears\nas a generalized Poisson and a power-law respectively. Our model successfully\nreproduces the shape of the distribution, and provides an explanation for how\nthe shape emerges via the decisions of authors. The model also captures the\nempirically positive correlations between the numbers of authors' papers,\ncitations and collaborators.\n", "  In the presence of a strong magnetic field a stellar equilibrium\nconfiguration, aided by the Lorentz force, can support a larger mass than a\nnon-magnetic one. This has been considered a possible explanation of the\nsuper-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs giving rise to over-luminous Type-Ia\nsupernovae. We present here linear and non-linear perturbation studies of such\nstrongly magetised configurations and show that axisymmetric configurations\nwith poloidal or toroidal fields are unstable. The numerical evolution of the\nperturbations shows instability after about an Alfv\\'en crossing time. This\ntime scale is very short for the magnetically supported super-Chandrasekhar\nmass white dwarfs. Uniform rotation about the symmetry axis can reduce the\ngrowth rate but can not stabilize the super-massive configurations. It is\nconcluded that long-lived super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs supported by\nmagnetic field are unlikely to occur in Nature.\n", "  We classify singularities in FRW cosmologies, which dynamics can be reduced\nto the dynamical system of the Newtonian type. This classification is performed\nin terms of geometry of a potential function if it has poles. At the sewn\nsingularity, which is of a finite scale factor type, the singularity in the\npast meets the singularity in the future. We show, that such singularities\nappear in the Starobinsky model in $f(\\hat{R})=\\hat{R}+\\gamma \\hat{R}^2$ in the\nPalatini formalism, when dynamics is determined by the corresponding piece-wise\nsmooth dynamical system. As an effect we obtain a degenerated singularity.\nAnalytical calculations are given for the cosmological model with matter and\nthe cosmological constant. The dynamics of model is also studied using\ndynamical system methods. From the phase portraits we find generic evolutionary\nscenarios of the evolution of the Universe. For this model, the best fit value\nof $\\Omega_\\gamma=3\\gamma H_0^2$ is equal $9.70\\times 10^{-11}$. We consider\nmodel in both Jordan and Einstein frames. We show that after transition to the\nEinstein frame we obtain both form of the potential of the scalar field and the\ndecaying Lambda term.\n", "  We introduce a new centrality index for bipartite network of papers and\nauthors that we call $K$-index. The $K$-index grows with the citation\nperformance of the papers that cite a given researcher and can seen as a\nmeasure of scientific social recognition. Indeed, the $K$-index measures the\nnumber of hubs, defined in a self-consistent way in the bipartite network, that\ncites a given author. We show that the $K$-index can be computed by simple\ninspection of the Web of Science platform and presents several advantages over\nother centrality indexes, in particular Hirsch $h$-index. The $K$-index is\nrobust to self-citations, is not limited by the total number of papers\npublished by a researcher as occurs for the $h$-index and can distinguish in a\nconsistent way researchers that have the same $h$-index but very different\nscientific social recognition. The $K$-index easily detects a known case of a\nresearcher with inflated number of papers, citations and $h$-index due to\nscientific misconduct. Finally, we show that, in a sample of twenty-eight\nphysics Nobel laureates and twenty-eight highly cited non-Nobel-laureate\nphysicists, the $K$-index correlates better to the achievement of the prize\nthan the number of papers, citations, citations per paper, citing articles or\nthe $h$-index. Clustering researchers in a $K$ versus $h$ plot reveals\ninteresting outliers that suggest that these two indexes can present\ncomplementary independent information.\n", "  Standard accretion disk theory (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) predicts that the\ntotal pressure in disks at typical (sub-)Eddington accretion rates becomes\nradiation pressure dominated. However, radiation pressure dominated disks are\nthermally unstable. Since these disks are observed in approximate steady state\nover the instability time-scale, our accretion models in the radiation pressure\ndominated regime (i.e. inner disk) need to be modified. Here, we present a\nmodification to the SS model, where radiation pressure is in equipartition with\ngas pressure in the inner region. We call these flows Accretion in Radiative\nEquipartition (AiRE) Disks. We introduce the basic features of AiRE disks and\nshow how they modify disk properties such as the Toomre parameter and central\ntemperature. We then show that the accretion rate of AiRE disks is limited from\nabove and below, by Toomre and nodal sonic point instabilities, respectively.\nThe former leads to a strict upper limit on the mass of supermassive black\nholes as a function of cosmic time (and spin), while the latter could explain\nthe transition between hard and soft states of X-ray binaries.\n", "  The qutrit comes next in complexity after qubit as a resource for quantum\ninformation processing. The qubit density matrix can be easily visualized using\nBloch sphere representation of its states. In contrast, this simplicity is in\ngeneral unavailable for the 8-dimensional state space of a qutrit. In this work\na new way to visualize them in a 3-dimensional Cartesian space is presented and\ncompared with earlier similar efforts.\n", "  Light propagation in a nonlinear optical medium is nonreciprocal for\nspatially asymmetric linear permittivity. We here examine physical mechanism\nand properties of such nonreciprocity (NR). For this, we calculate transmission\nof light through two models of a nonlinear optical isolator consisting of (a) a\ntwo-level atom and (b) a driven $\\Lambda$-type three-level atom coupled\nasymmetrically to light inside open waveguides. We find a higher NR in the\nmodel (b) than in the model (a) due to a stronger optical nonlinearity in the\nformer. We determine the critical intensity of incident light for maximum NR\nand a dependence of the corresponding NR on asymmetry in the coupling.\nSurprisingly, we find that it is mainly coherent elastic scattering compared to\nincoherent scattering of incident light which causes maximum NR near the\ncritical intensity. We also show a higher NR of an incident light in the\npresence of an additional weak light at the opposite port.\n", "  We exhibit a Boolean function for which the quantum communication complexity\nis exponentially larger than the classical information complexity. An\nexponential separation in the other direction was already known from the work\nof Kerenidis et. al. [SICOMP 44, pp. 1550-1572], hence our work implies that\nthese two complexity measures are incomparable. As classical information\ncomplexity is an upper bound on quantum information complexity, which in turn\nis equal to amortized quantum communication complexity, our work implies that a\ntight direct sum result for distributional quantum communication complexity\ncannot hold. The function we use to present such a separation is the Symmetric\nk-ary Pointer Jumping function introduced by Rao and Sinha [ECCC TR15-057],\nwhose classical communication complexity is exponentially larger than its\nclassical information complexity. In this paper, we show that the quantum\ncommunication complexity of this function is polynomially equivalent to its\nclassical communication complexity. The high-level idea behind our proof is\narguably the simplest so far for such an exponential separation between\ninformation and communication, driven by a sequence of round-elimination\narguments, allowing us to simplify further the approach of Rao and Sinha.\n  As another application of the techniques that we develop, we give a simple\nproof for an optimal trade-off between Alice's and Bob's communication while\ncomputing the related Greater-Than function on n bits: say Bob communicates at\nmost b bits, then Alice must send n/exp(O(b)) bits to Bob. This holds even when\nallowing pre-shared entanglement. We also present a classical protocol\nachieving this bound.\n", "  This thesis introduces a framework that is able to describe general many-body\ncoarse-grained interactions. We make use of this to describe the free energy\nsurface as a cluster expansion in terms of monomer, dimer, and trimer terms.\nThe contributions to the free energy due to these terms are inferred from MD\nresults of the underlying all-atom model using Gaussian Approximation\nPotentials, a type of machine-learning potential based on Gaussian process\nregression. This provides CG interactions that are much more accurate than is\npossible with site-based pair potentials. While slower than these, it can still\nbe faster than all-atom simulations for solvent-free CG models of systems with\na large amount of solvent, as is common in biomolecular simulations.\n", "  The first proof of the quantum adiabatic theorem was given as early as 1928.\nToday, this theorem is increasingly applied in a many-body context, e.g. in\nquantum annealing and in studies of topological properties of matter. In this\nsetup, the rate of variation $\\varepsilon$ of local terms is indeed small\ncompared to the gap, but the rate of variation of the total, extensive\nHamiltonian, is not. Therefore, applications to many-body systems are not\ncovered by the proofs and arguments in the literature. In this letter, we prove\na version of the adiabatic theorem for gapped ground states of quantum spin\nsystems, under assumptions that remain valid in the thermodynamic limit. As an\napplication, we give a mathematical proof of Kubo linear response formula for a\nbroad class of gapped interacting systems.\n", "  Quantum steering has recently been formalized in the framework of a resource\ntheory of steering, and several quantifiers have already been introduced. Here,\nwe propose an information-theoretic quantifier for steering called intrinsic\nsteerability, which uses conditional mutual information to measure the\ndeviation of a given assemblage from one having a local hidden-state model. We\nthus relate conditional mutual information to quantum steering and introduce\nmonotones that satisfy certain desirable properties. The idea behind the\nquantifier is to suppress the correlations that can be explained by an\ninaccessible quantum system and then quantify the remaining intrinsic\ncorrelations. A variant of the intrinsic steerability finds operational meaning\nas the classical communication cost of sending the measurement choice and\noutcome to an eavesdropper who possesses a purifying system of the underlying\nbipartite quantum state that is being measured.\n", "  In this paper it is argued how the dynamics of the classical Newtonian N-body\nsystem can be described in terms of the Schr$\\ddot{o}$dinger-Poisson equations\nin the large $N$ limit. This result is based on the stochastic quantization\nintroduced by Nelson, and on the Calogero conjecture. According to the Calogero\nconjecture, the emerging effective Planck constant is computed in terms of the\nparameters of the N-body system as $\\hbar \\sim M^{5/3} G^{1/2}\n(N/<\\rho>)^{1/6}$, where is $G$ the gravitational constant, $N$ and $M$ are the\nnumber and the mass of the bodies, and $<\\rho>$ is their average density. The\nrelevance of this result in the context of large scale structure formation is\ndiscussed. In particular, this finding gives a further argument in support of\nthe validity of the Schr$\\ddot{o}$dinger method as numerical double of the\nN-body simulations of dark matter dynamics at large cosmological scales.\n", "  We construct a two-dimensional lattice model of fermions coupled to Ising\nferromagnetic critical fluctuations. Using extensive sign-problem-free quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations, we show that the model realizes a continuous itinerant\nquantum phase transition. In comparison with other similar itinerant quantum\ncritical points (QCPs), our QCP shows much weaker superconductivity tendency\nwith no superconducting state down to the lowest temperature investigated,\nhence making the system a good platform for the exploration of quantum critical\nfluctuations. Remarkably, clear signatures of non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the\nfermion propagators are observed at the QCP. The critical fluctuations at the\nQCP partially resemble Hertz-Millis-Moriya behavior. However, careful scaling\nanalysis reveals that the QCP belongs to a different universality class,\ndeviating from both (2+1)d Ising and Hertz-Millis-Moriya predictions.\n", "  We present a trajectory dynamically tracing compensation method to smooth the\nspatial fluctuation of the static magnetic field (C-field) that provides a\nquantization axis in the fountain clock. The C-field coil current is\npoint-to-point adjusted in accordance to the atoms experienced magnetic field\nalong the flight trajectory. A homogeneous field with a 0.2 nT uncertainty is\nrealized compared to 5 nT under the static magnetic field with constant current\nduring the Ramsey interrogation. The corresponding uncertainty associated with\nthe second-order Zeeman shift that we calculate is improved by one order of\nmagnitude. The technique provides an alternative method to improve the magnetic\nfield uniformity particularly for large-scale equipment that is difficult to\nmachine with magnetic shielding. Our method is simple, robust, and essentially\nimportant in frequency evaluations concerning the dominant uncertainty\ncontribution due to the quadratic Zeeman shift.\n", "  We present a scalable scheme for executing the error-correction cycle of a\nmonolithic surface-code fabric composed of fast-flux-tuneable transmon qubits\nwith nearest-neighbor coupling. An eight-qubit unit cell forms the basis for\nrepeating both the quantum hardware and coherent control, enabling spatial\nmultiplexing. This control uses three fixed frequencies for all single-qubit\ngates and a unique frequency detuning pattern for each qubit in the cell. By\npipelining the interaction and readout steps of ancilla-based $X$- and $Z$-type\nstabilizer measurements, we can engineer detuning patterns that avoid all\nsecond-order transmon-transmon interactions except those exploited in\ncontrolled-phase gates, regardless of fabric size. Our scheme is applicable to\ndefect-based and planar logical qubits, including lattice surgery.\n", "  The formalism to augment the classical models of equation of state for real\ngases with the quantum statistical effects is presented. It allows an arbitrary\nexcluded volume procedure to model repulsive interactions, and an arbitrary\ndensity-dependent mean field to model attractive interactions. Variations on\nthe excluded volume mechanism include van der Waals (VDW) and Carnahan-Starling\nmodels, while the mean fields are based on VDW, Redlich-Kwong-Soave,\nPeng-Robinson, and Clausius equations of state. The VDW parameters of the\nnucleon-nucleon interaction are fitted in each model to the properties of the\nground state of nuclear matter, and the following range of values is obtained:\n$a = 330 - 430$ MeV fm$^3$ and $b = 2.5 - 4.4$ fm$^3$. In the context of the\nexcluded-volume approach, the fits to the nuclear ground state disfavor the\nvalues of the effective hard-core radius of a nucleon significantly smaller\nthan $0.5$ fm, at least for the nuclear matter region of the phase diagram.\nModifications to the standard VDW repulsion and attraction terms allow to\nimprove significantly the value of the nuclear incompressibility factor $K_0$,\nbringing it closer to empirical estimates. The generalization to include the\nbaryon-baryon interactions into the hadron resonance gas model is performed.\nThe behavior of the baryon-related lattice QCD observables at zero chemical\npotential is shown to be strongly correlated to the nuclear matter properties:\nan improved description of the nuclear incompressibility also yields an\nimproved description of the lattice data at $\\mu = 0$.\n", "  We derive and implement a general method to characterize the nonclassicality\nin compound discrete- and continuous-variable systems. For this purpose, we\nintroduce the operational notion of conditional hybrid nonclassicality which\nrelates to the ability to produce a nonclassical continuous-variable state by\nprojecting onto a general superposition of discrete-variable subsystem. We\ndiscuss the importance of this form of quantumness in connection with\ninterfaces for quantum communication. To verify the conditional hybrid\nnonclassicality, a matrix version of a nonclassicality quasiprobability is\nderived and its sampling approach is formulated. We experimentally generate an\nentangled, hybrid Schr\\\"odinger cat state, using a coherent photon-addition\nprocess acting on two temporal modes, and we directly sample its\nnonclassicality quasiprobability matrix. The introduced conditional quantum\neffects are certified with high statistical significance.\n", "  The work is dedicated to the challenge: control and manipulation of the\nquantum state of a remote physical object. The goal is approached via the\nentanglement channel between the object and a local physical system - actuator\n- subjected to a quantum non-demolishing impact. Physical systems under\nexploration are light beams.\n", "  As the density of matter increases, atomic nuclei disintegrate into nucleons\nand, eventually, the nucleons themselves disintegrate into quarks. The phase\ntransitions (PT's) between these phases can vary from steep first order to\nsmooth crossovers, depending on certain conditions. First-order PT's with more\nthan one globally conserved charge, so-called non-congruent PT's, have\ncharacteristic differences compared to congruent PT's. In this conference\nproceeding we discuss the non-congruence of the quark deconfinement PT at high\ndensities and/or temperatures relevant for heavy-ion collisions, neutron stars,\nproto-neutron stars, supernova explosions, and compact-star mergers.\n", "  We investigate thermal activation of thin-shells around anti-de Sitter black\nholes. Under the thin-shell approximation, we extensively study the parameter\nregion that allows a bubble nucleation bounded by a thin-shell out of a thermal\nbath. We show that in general if one fixes the temperature outside the shell,\none needs to consider the presence of a conical deficit inside the shell in the\nEuclidean manifold, due to the lack of solutions with a smooth manifold. We\nshow that for a given set of theoretical parameters, i.e., vacuum and shell\nenergy density, there is a finite range of black hole masses that allow this\ntransition. Most interestingly, one of them describes the complete evaporation\nof the initial black hole.\n", "  This brief note explicates some mathematical details of Phys. Rev. Lett. 118,\n130201 (2017), by showing how a version of the operator of that paper can be\nrigorously constructed on a well-defined linear space of functions.\n", "  The electronic structure of BaFe$_2X_3$ ($X$ = S and Se) and CsFe$_2$Se$_3$\nin which two-leg ladders are formed by the Fe sites are studied by means of\nx-ray absorption and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectroscopy. The\nx-ray absorption spectra at the Fe L edges for BaFe$_2X_3$ exhibit two\ncomponents, indicating that itinerant and localized Fe 3$d$ sites coexist.\nSubstantial x-ray linear dichroism (XLD) is observed in polarization dependent\nspectra, indicating the existence of orbital order or fluctuation in the\nFe-ladder even above the N\\'{e}el temperature $T_N$. Direct exchange\ninteraction along the legs of the Fe-ladder stabilizes the orbital and\nantiferromagnetic orders in BaFe$_2$S$_3$, while the ferromagnetic molecular\norbitals are realized between the rungs in CsFe$_2$Se$_3$.\n", "  The splitting function is a universal property of quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD) which describes how energy is shared between partons. Despite its\nubiquitous appearance in many QCD calculations, the splitting function cannot\nbe measured directly since it always appears multiplied by a collinear\nsingularity factor. Recently, however, a new jet substructure observable was\nintroduced which asymptotes to the splitting function for sufficiently high jet\nenergies. This provides a way to expose the splitting function through jet\nsubstructure measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. In this letter, we use\npublic data released by the CMS experiment to study the 2-prong substructure of\njets and test the 1 -> 2 splitting function of QCD. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first ever physics analysis based on the CMS Open Data.\n", "  The linear momentum and angular momentum of virtual photons of quantum vacuum\nfluctuations can induce the Casimir force and the Casimir torque, respectively.\nWhile the Casimir force has been measured extensively, the Casimir torque has\nnot been observed experimentally though it was predicted over forty years ago.\nHere we propose to detect the Casimir torque with an optically levitated\nnanorod near a birefringent plate in vacuum. The axis of the nanorod tends to\nalign with the polarization direction of the linearly polarized optical\ntweezer. When its axis is not parallel or perpendicular to the optical axis of\nthe birefringent crystal, it will experience a Casimir torque that shifts its\norientation slightly. We calculate the Casimir torque and Casimir force acting\non a levitated nanorod near a birefringent crystal. We also investigate the\neffects of thermal noise and photon recoils on the torque and force detection.\nWe prove that a levitated nanorod in vacuum will be capable of detecting the\nCasimir torque under realistic conditions.\n", "  Analog black/white hole pairs, consisting of a region of supersonic flow,\nhave been achieved in a recent experiment by J. Steinhauer using an elongated\nBose-Einstein condensate. A growing standing density wave, and a checkerboard\nfeature in the density-density correlation function, were observed in the\nsupersonic region. We model the density-density correlation function, taking\ninto account both quantum fluctuations and the shot-to-shot variation of atom\nnumber normally present in ultracold-atom experiments. We find that quantum\nfluctuations alone produce some, but not all, of the features of the\ncorrelation function, whereas atom-number fluctuation alone can produce all the\nobserved features, and agreement is best when both are included. In both cases,\nthe density-density correlation is not intrinsic to the fluctuations, but\nrather is induced by modulation of the standing wave caused by the\nfluctuations.\n", "  Here we report the measurements of two-dimensional (2-D) spectra of the\nstreamwise velocity ($u$) in a high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer. A\nnovel experiment employing multiple hot-wire probes was carried out at friction\nReynolds numbers ranging from 2400 to 26000. Taylor's frozen turbulence\nhypothesis is used to convert temporal-spanwise information into a 2-D spatial\nspectrum which shows the contribution of streamwise ($\\lambda_x$) and spanwise\n($\\lambda_y$) length scales to the streamwise variance at a given wall height\n($z$). At low Reynolds numbers, the shape of the 2-D spectra at a constant\nenergy level shows $\\lambda_y/z \\sim (\\lambda_x/z)^{1/2}$ behaviour at larger\nscales, which is in agreement with the existing literature at a matched\nReynolds number obtained from direct numerical simulations. However, at high\nReynolds numbers, it is observed that the square-root relationship tends\ntowards a linear relationship ($\\lambda_y \\sim \\lambda_x$) as required for\nself-similarity and predicted by the attached eddy hypothesis.\n", "  We report high-pressure $^{77}$Se NMR studies on FeSe single crystals that\nreveal a prominent inhomogeneous NMR linewidth broadening upon cooling, with\nthe magnetic field applied along the tetragonal [110] direction. The data\nindicate the existence of short-range-ordered, inhomogeneous electronic\nnematicity, which has surprisingly long time scales over milliseconds. The\nshort-range order survives temperatures up to $8$ times the structural\ntransition temperature, and remains robust against pressure, in contrast to the\nstrong pressure-dependence of the orbital ordering, structural transition, and\nthe ground state magnetism. Such an extended region of static nematicity in the\n($P$,$T$) space of FeSe indicates an enormously large fluctuating regime, and\nprovide fresh insights and constraints to the understanding of electronic\nnematicity in iron-based superconductors.\n", "  KIC 8462852 stood out among more than 100,000 stars in the Kepler catalogue\nbecause of the strange features of its light curve: a wide, asymmetric dimming\ntaking up to 15 per cent of the light at D793 and a period of multiple, narrow\ndimmings happening approximately 700 days later. Several models have been\nproposed to account for this abnormal behaviour, most of which require either\nunlikely causes or a finely-tuned timing. We aim at offering a relatively\nnatural solution, invoking only phenomena that have been previously observed,\nalthough perhaps in larger or more massive versions. We model the system using\na large, ringed body whose transit produces the first dimming and a swarm of\nTrojan objects sharing its orbit that causes the second period of multiple\ndimmings. The resulting orbital period is $T\\approx12$ years, with a semi-major\naxis $a\\approx6$ au. Our model allows us to make two straightforward\npredictions: we expect the passage of a new swarm of Trojans in front of the\nstar starting during the early months of 2021, and a new transit of the main\nobject during the first half of 2023.\n", "  We present a systematical study via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and\nlow-energy electron diffraction (LEED) on the effect of the exposure of Lithium\n(Li) on graphene on silicon carbide (SiC). We have investigated Li deposition\nboth on epitaxial monolayer graphene and on buffer layer surfaces on the\nSi-face of SiC. At room temperature, Li immediately intercalates at the\ninterface between the SiC substrate and the buffer layer and transforms the\nbuffer layer into a quasi-free-standing graphene. This conclusion is\nsubstantiated by LEED and STM evidence. We show that intercalation occurs\nthrough the SiC step sites or graphene defects. We obtain a good quantitative\nagreement between the number of Li atoms deposited and the number of available\nSi bonds at the surface of the SiC crystal. Through STM analysis, we are able\nto determine the interlayer distance induced by Li-intercalation at the\ninterface between the SiC substrate and the buffer layer.\n", "  Solitary waves propagation of baryonic density perturbations, ruled by the\nKorteweg--de Vries equation in a mean-field quark-gluon plasma model, are\ninvestigated from the point of view of the theory of information. A recently\nproposed continuous logarithmic measure of information, called configurational\nentropy, is used to derive the soliton width, defining the pulse, for which the\ninformational content of the soliton spatial profile is more compressed, in the\nShannon's sense.\n", "  Heavy neutrinos, a key prediction of many standard model extensions, remain\nsome of the most searched-for objects at collider experiments. In this context,\nwe revisit the premise that the gluon fusion production mechanism, $gg \\to\nZ^*/h^* \\to N\\nu_\\ell$, is phenomenologically irrelevant at the CERN LHC and\nreport the impact of soft gluon corrections to the production cross section. We\nresum threshold logarithms up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic\naccuracy (N$^3$LL), thus capturing the dominant contributions to the inclusive\ncross section up to next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO). For $m_N > 150$\nGeV and collider energies $\\sqrt{s} = 7 - 100$ TeV, corrections to the Born\nrates span $+160$ to $+260\\%$. At $\\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV, the resummed channel is\nroughly equal in size to the widely-believed-to-be-dominant charged current\nDrell-Yan process and overtakes it outright at $\\sqrt{s} \\gtrsim 20-25$ TeV.\nResults are independent of the precise nature/mixing of $N$ and hold\ngenerically for other low-scale seesaws. Findings are also expected to hold for\nother exotic leptons and broken axial-vector currents, particularly as the\n$Z^*$ contribution identically reduces to that of a pseudoscalar.\n", "  We present Fermi's golden rule calculations of the optical carrier injection\nand the coherent control of current injection in graphene nanoribbons with\nzigzag geometry, using an envelope function approach. This system possesses\nstrongly localized states (flat bands) with a large joint density of states at\nlow photon energies; for ribbons with widths above a few tens of nanometers,\nthis system also posses large number of (non-flat) states with maxima and\nminima close to the Fermi level. Consequently, even with small dopings the\noccupation of these localized states can be significantly altered. In this\nwork, we calculate the relevant quantities for coherent control at different\nchemical potentials, showing the sensitivity of this system to the occupation\nof the edge states. We consider coherent control scenarios arising from the\ninterference of one-photon absorption at $2\\hbar\\omega$ with two-photon\nabsorption at $\\hbar\\omega$, and those arising from the interference of\none-photon absorption at $\\hbar\\omega$ with stimulated electronic Raman\nscattering (virtual absorption at $2\\hbar\\omega$ followed by emission at\n$\\hbar\\omega$). Although at large photon energies these processes follow an\nenergy-dependence similar to that of 2D graphene, the zigzag nanoribbons\nexhibit a richer structure at low photon energies, arising from divergences of\nthe joint density of states and from resonant absorption processes, which can\nbe strongly modified by doping. As a figure of merit for the injected carrier\ncurrents, we calculate the resulting swarm velocities. Finally, we provide\nestimates for the limits of validity of our model.\n", "  In this paper we present a novel construction of non-homogeneous hydrodynamic\nequations from what we call quasi-St\\\"ackel systems, that is non-commutatively\nintegrable systems constructed from appropriate maximally superintegrable\nSt\\\"ackel systems. We describe the relations between Poisson algebras generated\nby quasi-St\\\"ackel Hamiltonians and the corresponding Lie algebras of vector\nfields of non-homogeneous hydrodynamic systems. We also apply St\\\"ackel\ntransform to obtain new non-homogeneous equations of considered type.\n", "  A prototypical quasi-2D metallic compound, 1T-TaS_2 has been extensively\nstudied due to an intricate interplay between a Mott-insulating ground state\nand a charge density-wave (CDW) order. In the low-temperature phase, 12 out of\n13 Ta_{4+} 5\\textit{d}-electrons form molecular orbitals in hexagonal\nstar-of-David patterns, leaving one 5\\textit{d}-electron with \\textit{S} = 1/2\nspin free. This orphan quantum spin with a large spin-orbit interaction is\nexpected to form a highly correlated phase of its own. And it is most likely\nthat they will form some kind of a short-range order out of a strongly\nspin-orbit coupled Hilbert space. In order to investigate the low-temperature\nmagnetic properties, we performed a series of measurements including neutron\nscattering and muon experiments. The obtained data clearly indicate the\npresence of the short-ranged phase and put the upper bound on ~ 0.4\n\\textit{\\mu}_B for the size of the magnetic moment, consistent with the\norphan-spin scenario.\n", "  We develop a theory of electron tunneling accompanied by carrier-carrier\nscattering in graphene - insulator - graphene heterostructures. Due to the\ndynamic screening of Coulomb interaction, the scattering-aided tunneling is\nresonantly enhanced if the transferred energy and momentum correspond to those\nof surface plasmons. We reveal the possible experimental manifestations of such\nplasmon-assisted tunneling in current-voltage curves and plasmon emission\nspectra of graphene-based tunnel junctions. We find that inelastic current and\nplasmon emission rates have sharp peaks at voltages providing equal energies,\nmomenta and group velocities of plasmons and interlayer single-particle\nexcitations. The strength of this resonance, which we call plasmaronic\nresonance, is limited by interlayer twist and plasmon lifetime. The onset of\nplasmon-assisted tunneling can be also marked by a cusp in the junction\n$I(V)$-curve at low temperatures, and the threshold voltage for such tunneling\nweakly depends on carrier density and persists in the presence of interlayer\ntwist.\n", "  We report an experimental study of the scaling of zero-bias conductance peaks\ncompatible with Majorana zero modes as a function of magnetic field, tunnel\ncoupling, and temperature in one-dimensional structures fabricated from an\nepitaxial semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure. Results are consistent\nwith theory, including a peak conductance that is proportional to tunnel\ncoupling, saturates at $2e^2/h$, decreases as expected with field-dependent\ngap, and collapses onto a simple scaling function in the dimensionless ratio of\ntemperature and tunnel coupling.\n", "  We focus on a recently experimentally realized scenario of\nnormal-metal-insulator-superconductor tunnel junctions coupled to a\nsuperconducting resonator. We develop a first-principles theory to describe the\neffect of photon-assisted electron tunneling on the quantum state of the\nresonator. Our results are in very good quantitative agreement with the\nprevious experiments on refrigeration and heating of the resonator using the\nphoton-assisted tunneling, thus providing a stringent verification of the\ndeveloped theory. Importantly, our results provide simple analytical estimates\nof the voltage-tunable coupling strength and temperature of the thermal\nreservoir formed by the photon-assisted tunneling. Consequently, they are used\nto introduce optimization principles for initialization of quantum devices\nusing such a quantum-circuit refrigerator. Thanks to the first-principles\nnature of our approach, extension of the theory to the full spectrum of quantum\nelectric devices seems plausible.\n", "  Using data samples collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider\nat six center-of-mass energies between 4.008 and 4.600 GeV, we observe the\nprocesses $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\phi\\phi\\omega$ and $e^+e^-\\rightarrow\n\\phi\\phi\\phi$. The Born cross sections are measured and the ratio of the cross\nsections $\\sigma(e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\phi\\phi\\omega)/\\sigma(e^+e^-\\rightarrow\n\\phi\\phi\\phi)$ is estimated to be $1.75\\pm0.22\\pm0.19$ averaged over six energy\npoints, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is\nsystematic. The results represent first measurements of these interactions.\n", "  We investigate simplified models of new physics that can accommodate the\nmeasured value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the relic\ndensity of dark matter. We define a set of renormalizable, SU(2)$\\times$U(1)\ninvariant extensions of the Standard Model, each comprising an inert $Z_2$-odd\nscalar field and one or more vector-like pairs of colorless fermions that\ncommunicate to the muons through Yukawa-type interactions. The new sectors are\nclassified according to their transformation properties under the Standard\nModel gauge group and all models are systematically confronted with a variety\nof experimental constraints: LEP mass bounds, direct LHC searches, electroweak\nprecision observables, and direct searches for dark matter. We show that\nscenarios featuring only one type of new fermions become very predictive once\nthe relic density and collider constraints are taken into account, as in this\ncase $g-2$ is not enhanced by chirality flip. Conversely, for models where an\nadditional source of chiral-symmetry violation is generated via fermion mixing,\nthe constraints are much looser and new precision experiments with highly\nsuppressed systematic uncertainties may be required to test the parameter\nspace.\n", "  We discuss, based on first principles calculations, the possibility to tune\nthe magnetism of oxygen vacancies at the (001) surface of strontium titanate\n$(\\mathrm{SrTiO_3}\\!)$. The magnetic moment of single and clustered vacancies\nstemming from Ti-O broken bonds can be both quenched and stabilized\ncontrollably by chemical potential adjustment associated with doping the system\nwith electrons or holes. We discuss to what extent this route to magnetization\nstate control is robust against other external influences like chemical doping,\nmechanical action and electric field. Such control of vacancy state and\nmagnetization can conceivably be achieved experimentally by using local probe\ntips.\n", "  We consider FRW cosmology in $f(R)= R+ \\gamma R^2+\\delta R^3$ modified\nframework. The Palatini approach reduces its dynamics to the simple\ngeneralization of Friedmann equation. Thus we study the dynamics in\ntwo-dimensional phase space with some details. After reformulation of the model\nin the Einstein frame, it reduces to the FRW cosmological model with a\nhomogeneous scalar field and vanishing kinetic energy term. This potential\ndetermines the running cosmological constant term as a function of the Ricci\nscalar. As a result we obtain the emergent dark energy parametrization from the\ncovariant theory. We study also singularities of the model and demonstrate that\nin the Einstein frame some undesirable singularities disappear.\n", "  We perform projective quantum Monte Carlo simulations of zigzag graphene\nnanoribbons within a realistic model with long-range Coulomb interactions.\nIncreasing the relative strength of nonlocal interactions with respect to the\non-site repulsion does not generate a phase transition but has a number of\nnontrivial effects. At the single-particle level we observe a marked\nenhancement of the Fermi velocity at the Dirac points. At the two-particle\nlevel, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations compete. As a consequence,\nthe edge magnetic moment is reduced but the edge dispersion relation increases\nin the sense that the single-particle gap at momentum $q=\\pi/|{\\pmb a}_1|$\ngrows. We attribute this to nonlocal charge fluctuations which assist the spin\nfluctuations to generate the aforementioned gap. In contrast, the net result of\nthe interaction-induced renormalization of different energy scales is a\nconstant spin-wave velocity of the edge modes. However, since the particle-hole\ncontinuum is shifted to higher energies---due to the renormalization of the\nFermi velocity---Landau damping is reduced. As a result, a roughly linear\nspin-wave-like mode at the edge spreads out through a larger part of the\nBrillouin zone.\n", "  The assumption of a single astrophysical power-law flux to explain the\nIceCube 6-year HESE extraterrestrial events yields a large spectral index that\nis in tension with gamma-ray observations and the 6-year up-going muon\nneutrinos data. Adopting a spectral index belonging to the range\n$\\left[2.0,2.2\\right]$, which is compatible with the one deduced by the\nanalysis performed on the 6-year up-going muon neutrinos data and with $p$-$p$\nastrophysical sources, the latest IceCube data show an up to $2.6\\,\\sigma$\nexcess in the number of events in the energy range 40--200 TeV. We interpret\nsuch an excess as a decaying Dark Matter signal and we perform a\nlikelihood-ratio statistical test to compare the two-component scenario with\nrespect to the single-component one.\n", "  Measurements of the heavy-flavour hadron production are a powerful tool to\nstudy the nature of strong interaction and to understand the properties of\nnuclear matter that is created in ultra-relativistic hadron-hadron collisions.\nThe excellent tracking and vertexing capabilities of the ALICE experiment,\ntogether with its particle identification systems, allow for an efficient\nidentification and reconstruction of decays of hadrons that contain heavy\nquarks. A selection of recent measurements on open heavy-flavour production\nfrom pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and p--Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, collected with the ALICE detector during the LHC\nRun-1 phase, are discussed in this paper.\n", "  We determine the $L^p$-spectrum of the Schr\\\"odinger operator with the\ninverted harmonic oscillator potential $V(x)=-x^2$ for $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$.\n", "  We discuss the structure of rapidity divergences that are presented in the\nsoft factors of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization theorems. To\nprovide the discussion on the most general level we consider soft factors for\nmulti-parton scattering. We show that the rapidity divergences are result of\nthe gluon exchanges with the distant transverse plane, and are structurally\nequivalent to the ultraviolet divergences. It allows to formulate and to prove\nthe renormalization theorem for rapidity divergences. The proof is made with\nthe help the conformal transformation which maps rapidity divergences to\nultraviolet divergences. The theorem is the systematic form of the\nfactorization of rapidity divergences, which is required for the definition of\nTMD parton distributions. In particular, the definition of multi parton\ndistributions is presented. The equivalence of ultraviolet and rapidity\ndivergences leads to the exact relation between soft and rapidity anomalous\ndimensions. Using this relation we derive the rapidity anomalous dimension at\nthe three-loop order.\n", "  Two-dimensional (spin-$2$) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) type valence\nbond solids on the square lattice are known to be symmetry protected\ntopological (SPT) gapped spin liquids [Shintaro Takayoshi, Pierre Pujol, and\nAkihiro Tanaka Phys. Rev. B ${\\bf 94}$, 235159 (2016)]. Using the projected\nentangled pair state (PEPS) framework, we extend the construction of the AKLT\nstate to the case of $SU(3)$, relevant for cold atom systems. The entanglement\nspectrum is shown to be described by an alternating $SU(3)$ chain of \"quarks\"\nand \"antiquarks\", subject to exponentially decaying (with distance) Heisenberg\ninteractions, in close similarity with its $SU(2)$ analog. We discuss the SPT\nfeature of the state.\n", "  We study the spread of R\\'enyi entropy between two halves of a\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) chain of Majorana fermions, prepared in a thermofield\ndouble (TFD) state. The SYK chain model is a model of chaotic many-body\nsystems, which describes a one-dimensional lattice of Majorana fermions, with\nspatially local random quartic interaction. We find that for integer R\\'enyi\nindex $n>1$, the R\\'enyi entanglement entropy saturates at a parametrically\nsmaller value than expected. This implies that the TFD state of the SYK chain\ndoes not rapidly thermalize, despite being maximally chaotic: instead, it\nrapidly approaches a prethermal state. We compare our results to the signatures\nof thermalization observed in other quenches in the SYK model, and to intuition\nfrom nearly-$\\mathrm{AdS}_2$ gravity.\n", "  We discuss some of the tests of Lorentz symmetry made possible by\nastrophysical observations of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, gamma-rays, and\nneutrinos. These are among the most sensitive tests of Lorentz symmetry\nviolation because they are the highest energy phenomena known to man.\n", "  A new method to describe hyperbolic patterns in two dimensional flows is\nproposed. The method is based on the Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs), which\nhave the properties to be covariant with the dynamics, and thus being mapped by\nthe tangent linear operator into another CLVs basis, they are norm independent,\ninvariant under time reversal and can be not orthonormal. CLVs can thus give a\nmore detailed information on the expansion and contraction directions of the\nflow than the Lyapunov Vector bases, that are instead always orthogonal. We\nsuggest a definition of Hyperbolic Covariant Coherent Structures (HCCSs), that\ncan be defined on the scalar field representing the angle between the CLVs.\nHCCSs can be defined for every time instant and could be useful to understand\nthe long term behaviour of particle tracers.\n  We consider three examples: a simple autonomous Hamiltonian system, as well\nas the non-autonomous \"double gyre\" and Bickley jet, to see how well the angle\nis able to describe particular patterns and barriers. We compare the results\nfrom the HCCSs with other coherent patterns defined on finite time by the\nFinite Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLEs), to see how the behaviour of these\nstructures change asymptotically.\n", "  Recent experiments demonstrate that molecular motors from the Myosin II\nfamily serve as cross-links inducing active tension in the cytoskeletal\nnetwork. Here we revise the Brownian ratchet model, previously studied in the\ncontext of active transport along polymer tracks, in setups resembling a motor\nin a polymer network, also taking into account the effect of electrostatic\nchanges in the motor heads. We explore important mechanical quantities and show\nthat such a model is also capable of mechanosensing. Finally, we introduce a\nnovel efficiency based on excess heat production by the chemical cycle which is\ndirectly related to the active tension the motor exerts. The chemical\nefficiencies differ considerably for motors with a different number of heads,\nwhile their mechanical properties remain qualitatively similar. For motors with\na small number of heads, the chemical efficiency is maximal when they are\nfrustrated, a trait that is not found in larger motors.\n", "  We study the $\\Lambda^+_c \\to \\pi^0 \\phi p$ decay by considering a triangle\nsingularity mechanism. In this mechanism, the $\\Lambda^+_c$ decays into the\n$K^* \\Sigma^*(1385)$, the $\\Sigma^*(1385)$ decays into the $\\pi^0 \\Sigma$ (or\n$\\Lambda$), and then the $K^* \\Sigma$ (or $\\Lambda$) interact to produce the\n$\\phi p$ in the final state. This mechanism produces a peak structure around\n$2020$ MeV. In addition, the possibility that there is a hidden-strange\npentaquark-like state is also considered by taking into account the final state\ninteractions of $K^* \\Lambda$, $K^* \\Sigma$, and $\\phi p$. We conclude that it\nis difficult to search for the hidden-strange analogue of the $P_c$ states in\nthis decay. However, we do expect nontrivial behavior in the $\\phi p$ invariant\nmass distribution. The predictions can be tested by experiments such as BESIII,\nLHCb and Belle-II.\n", "  Our investigation of high energy $\\rm{pp}$ and $\\bar{\\rm{p}}\\rm{p}$ elastic\nscattering over the last two decades has led us to consider that the proton has\nthree regions: i) an outer region consisting of a quark-antiquark\n($\\rm{q}\\bar{\\rm{q}}$) condensate ground state (also described as\nquark-antiquark outer cloud), ii) an inner shell of baryonic charge of size\n~0.44 fm, and iii) a core of size ~0.2 fm, where the three valence quarks of a\nproton with baryonic charges are confined. The proton structure that has\nemerged leads to four main elastic scattering processes in $\\rm{pp}$\nscattering. The first process, which gives rise to diffraction scattering, is\ndue to a glancing collision of the outer cloud of one proton with that of\nanother proton. In a $\\bar{\\rm{p}}\\rm{p}$ glancing collision the corresponding\nprocess occurs. The second process involves multiple \\omega-exchanges. The\nthird process in $\\rm{pp}$ scattering is quark-quark scattering via gluon-gluon\ninteraction. The fourth process - which appears for the first time in our\ninvestigation of $\\rm{pp}$ scattering - is a glancing collision at the boundary\nof a proton cloud with that of the other proton cloud. To describe\nquantitatively the four processes, their parameters have been determined. For\nthis purpose, we investigated $\\rm{pp}$ 7 TeV d\\sigma/dt measured by the TOTEM\nCollaboration and $\\bar{\\rm{p}}\\rm{p}$ 1.96 TeV d\\sigma/dt measured by the D0\nCollaboration.\n  Our calculated $\\rm{pp}$ elastic d\\sigma/dt at 13 TeV has no oscillations in\nthe large |t| region, in good agreement with the preliminary TOTEM\nmeasurements.\n", "  Magnetism in Weyl semimetals is desired to investigate the interaction\nbetween the magnetic moments and Weyl fermions, e.g. to explore anomalous\nquantum Hall phenomena. Here we demonstrate that proton irradiation is an\neffective tool to induce ferromagnetism in the Weyl semimetal TaAs. The\nintrinsic magnetism is observed with a transition temperature above room\ntemperature. The magnetic moments from d states are found to be localized\naround Ta atoms. Further, the first-principles calculations indicate that the d\nstates localized on the nearest-neighbor Ta atoms of As vacancy sites are\nresponsible for the observed magnetic moments and the long-ranged magnetic\norder. The results show the feasibility of inducing ferromagnetism in Weyl\nsemimetals so that they may facilitate the applications of this material in\nspintronics.\n", "  Presented here are observations that demonstrate how the deformation of\nmillimetric cavitation bubbles by a uniform pressure gradient quenches single\ncollapse luminescence. Our innovative measurement system captures a broad\nluminescence spectrum (wavelength range 300-900 nm) from the individual\ncollapses of laser-induced bubbles in water. By varying the bubble size,\ndriving pressure and the perceived gravity level aboard parabolic flights, we\nprobed the limit from aspherical to highly spherical bubble collapses.\nLuminescence was detected for bubbles of maximum radii within the previously\nuncovered range $R_{0}$ =1.5-6 mm for laser-induced bubbles. The relative\nluminescence energy was found to rapidly decrease as a function of bubble\nasymmetry quantified by the anisotropy parameter $\\zeta$, which is the\ndimensionless equivalent of the Kelvin impulse. As established previously,\n$\\zeta$ also dictates the characteristic parameters of bubble-driven microjets.\nThe threshold of $\\zeta$ beyond which no luminescence is observed in our\nexperiment closely coincides with the threshold where the microjets visibly\npierce the bubble and drive a vapor-jet during the rebound. The individual\nfitted blackbody temperatures range between $T_{\\rm lum}$=7000 and 11500 K but\ndo not show any clear trend as a function of $\\zeta$. Time-resolved\nmeasurements using a high-speed photodetector disclose multiple luminescence\nevents at each bubble collapse. The averaged full width at half maximum of the\npulse is found to scale with $R_{0}$ and to range between 10-20 ns.\n", "  We compare performances of well-known numerical time-stepping methods that\nare widely used to compute solutions of the doubly-infinite\nFermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) lattice equations. The methods are benchmarked\naccording to (1) their accuracy in capturing the soliton peaks and (2) in\ncapturing highly-oscillatory parts of the solutions of the Toda lattice\nresulting from a variety of initial data. The numerical inverse scattering\ntransform method is used to compute a reference solution with high accuracy. We\nfind that benchmarking a numerical method on pure-soliton initial data can lead\none to overestimate the accuracy of the method.\n", "  Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides are promising materials for\nvalleytronic operations. They exhibit two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin\nzone, and the valley populations can be directly controlled and determined\nusing circularly polarized optical excitation and emission. The\nphotoluminescence polarization reflects the ratio of the two valley\npopulations. A wide range of values for the degree of circularly polarized\nemission, Pcirc, has been reported for monolayer WS2, although the reasons for\nthe disparity are unclear. Here we optically populate one valley, and measure\nPcirc to explore the valley population dynamics at room temperature in a large\nnumber of monolayer WS2 samples synthesized via chemical vapor deposition.\nUnder resonant excitation, Pcirc ranges from 2% to 32%, and we observe a\npronounced inverse relationship between photoluminescence (PL) intensity and\nPcirc. High quality samples exhibiting strong PL and long exciton relaxation\ntime exhibit a low degree of valley polarization, and vice versa. This behavior\nis also demonstrated in monolayer WSe2 samples and transferred WS2, indicating\nthat this correlation may be more generally observed and account for the wide\nvariations reported for Pcirc. Time resolved PL provides insight into the role\nof radiative and non-radiative contributions to the observed polarization.\nShort non-radiative lifetimes result in a higher measured polarization by\nlimiting opportunity for depolarizing scattering events.\n", "  We address the relation between two apparently distinct problems: The quest\nfor a deeper understanding of the nature of consciousness and the search for\ntime and space as emergent structures in the quantum mechanical world. We also\nadvance a toy-model proposal of emergence of time from a timeless unus mundus\nquantum-like space by using Aharonov's two state formalism of quantum\nmechanics. We further speculate on these issues within a quantum cognitive\nperspective with particular interest in two recent papers on this emerging\nfield of science. One (Aerts et al) entails (as we argue) a panpsychist\ntop-down approach to the problem of consciousness. The second paper (Blutner et\nal) proposes a quantum cognitive model for Jung's psychological type structure.\nWe discuss these concepts and their relation with our main thesis, that time is\na measure of individuality. One of our central motivations is to provide\narguments that allows the mainstream physicist to take seriously a panpsychist\nworldview, a position that has been openly forwarded by many modern\nphilosophers.\n", "  Microlensing is a unique tool, capable of detecting the 'cold' planets\nbetween 1-10 AU from their host stars, and even unbound 'free-floating'\nplanets. This regime has been poorly sampled to date owing to the limitations\nof alternative planet-finding methods, but a watershed in discoveries is\nanticipated in the near future thanks to the planned microlensing surveys of\nWFIRST-AFTA and Euclid s Extended Mission. Of the many challenges inherent in\nthese missions, the modeling of microlensing events will be of primary\nimportance, yet is often time consuming, complex and perceived as a daunting\nbarrier to participation in the field. The large scale of future survey data\nproducts will require thorough but efficient modeling software, but unlike\nother areas of exoplanet research, microlensing currently lacks a\npublicly-available, well-documented package to conduct this type of analysis.\nWe present first version 1.0 of pyLIMA: Python Lightcurve Identification and\nMicrolensing Analysis. This software is written in Python and uses existing\npackages as much as possible, to make it widely accessible. In this paper, we\ndescribe the overall architecture of the software and the core modules for\nmodeling single-lens events. To verify the performance of this software, we use\nit to model both real datasets from events published in the literature and\ngenerated test data, produced using pyLIMA s simulation module. Results\ndemonstrate that pyLIMA is an efficient tool for microlensing modeling. We will\nexpand pyLIMA to consider more complex phenomena in the following papers.\n", "  A primary goal of direct imaging techniques is to spectrally characterize the\natmospheres of planets around other stars at extremely high contrast levels. To\nachieve this goal, coronagraphic instruments have favored integral field\nspectrographs (IFS) as the science cameras to disperse the entire search area\nat once and obtain spectra at each location, since the planet position is not\nknown a priori. These spectrographs are useful against confusion from speckles\nand background objects, and can also help in the speckle subtraction and\nwavefront control stages of the coronagraphic observation. We present a\nsoftware package, the Coronagraph and Rapid Imaging Spectrograph in Python\n(crispy) to simulate the IFS of the WFIRST Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). The\nsoftware propagates input science cubes using spatially and spectrally resolved\ncoronagraphic focal plane cubes, transforms them into IFS detector maps and\nultimately reconstructs the spatio-spectral input scene as a 3D datacube.\nSimulated IFS cubes can be used to test data extraction techniques, refine\nsensitivity analyses and carry out design trade studies of the flight CGI-IFS\ninstrument. crispy is a publicly available Python package and can be adapted to\nother IFS designs.\n", "  High-resolution mid-infrared observations carried out by the Spitzer Space\nTelescope allowed one to resolve the fine structure of many astrospheres. In\nparticular, they showed that the astrosphere around the B0.7 Ia star kappa Cas\n(HD 2905) has a clear-cut arc structure with numerous cirrus-like filaments\nbeyond it. Previously, we suggested a physical mechanism for the formation of\nsuch filamentary structures. Namely, we showed theoretically that they might\nrepresent the non-monotonic spatial distribution of the interstellar dust in\nastrospheres (viewed as filaments) caused by interaction of the dust grains\nwith the interstellar magnetic field disturbed in the astrosphere due to\ncolliding of the stellar and interstellar winds. In this paper, we invoke this\nmechanism to explain the structure of the astrosphere around kappa Cas. We\nperformed 3D magnetohydrodynamic modelling of the astrosphere for realistic\nparameters of the stellar wind and space velocity. The dust dynamics and the\ndensity distribution in the astrosphere were calculated in the framework of a\nkinetic model. It is found that the model results with the classical MRN size\ndistribution of dust in the interstellar medium do not match the observations,\nand that the observed filamentary structure of the astrosphere can be\nreproduced only if the dust is composed mainly of big (micron-sized) grains.\nComparison of the model results with observations allowed us to estimate\nparameters (number density and magnetic field strength) of the surrounding\ninterstellar medium.\n", "  We study ancient Khmer ephemerides described in 1910 by the French engineer\nFaraut, in order to determine whether they rely on observations carried out in\nCambodia. These ephemerides were found to be of Indian origin and have been\nadapted for another longitude, most likely in Burma. A method for estimating\nthe date and place where the ephemerides were developed or adapted is described\nand applied.\n", "  We provide measurements of the absolute reflectivity of Jupiter and Saturn\nalong their central meridians in filters covering a wide range of visible and\nnear-infrared wavelengths (from 0.38 to 1.7 $\\mu$m) that are not often\npresented in the literature. We also give measurements of the geometric albedo\nof both planets and discuss the limb-darkening behavior and temporal\nvariability of their reflectivity values for a period of four years\n(2012-2016). This work is based on observations with the PlanetCam-UPV/EHU\ninstrument at the 1.23 m and 2.2 m telescopes in Calar Alto Observatory\n(Spain). The instrument simultaneously observes in two channels: visible (VIS;\n0.38-1.0 $\\mu$m) and short-wave infrared (SWIR; 1.0--1.7 $\\mu$m). We obtained\nhigh-resolution observations via the lucky-imaging method. We show that our\ncalibration is consistent with previous independent determinations of\nreflectivity values of these planets and, for future reference, provide new\ndata extended in the wavelength range and in the time. Our results have an\nuncertainty in absolute calibration of 10--20\\%. We show that under the\nhypothesis of constant geometric albedo, we are able to detect absolute\nreflectivity changes related to planetary temporal evolution of about 5-10\\%.\n", "  We analyze general N = 2 supersymmetric AdS4 solutions of type IIB\nsupergravity. Utilizing a set of pure spinor equations directly adapted to N =\n2, the necessary and sufficient conditions for supersymmetry are reduced to a\nconcise system of partial differential equations for two functions which\ndetermine the solutions. We show that using this system analytic solutions can\nbe generated, thus potentially expanding the rather limited set of known AdS4\nsolutions in type IIB supergravity.\n", "  Structural, magnetic and electrical-transport properties of {\\alpha}-LiFeO2,\ncrystallizing in the rock salt structure with random distribution of Li and Fe\nions, have been studied by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, 57Fe M\\\"ossbauer\nspectroscopy and electrical resistance measurements at pressures up to 100 GPa\nusing diamond anvil cells. It was found that the crystal structure is stable at\nleast to 82 GPa, though a significant change in compressibility has been\nobserved above 50 GPa. The changes in the structural properties are found to be\non a par with a sluggish Fe3+ high- to low-spin (HS-LS) transition (S=5/2 to\nS=1/2) starting at 50 GPa and not completed even at ~100 GPa. The HS-LS\ntransition is accompanied by an appreciable resistance decrease remaining a\nsemiconductor up to 115 GPa and is not expected to be metallic even at about\n200 GPa. The observed feature of the pressure-induced HS-LS transition is not\nan ordinary behavior of ferric oxides at high pressures. The effect of Fe3+\nnearest and next nearest neighbors on the features of the spin crossover is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Chloride-bearing deposits on Mars record high-elevation lakes during the\nwaning stages of Mars' wet era (mid-Noachian to late Hesperian). The water\nsource pathways, seasonality, salinity, depth, lifetime, and paleoclimatic\ndrivers of these widespread lakes are all unknown. Here we combine\nreaction-transport modeling, orbital spectroscopy, and new volume estimates\nfrom high-resolution digital terrain models, in order to constrain the\nhydrologic boundary conditions for forming the chlorides. Considering a T = 0\ndegrees C system, we find: (1) individual lakes were >100 m deep and lasted\ndecades or longer; (2) if volcanic degassing was the source of chlorine, then\nthe water-to-rock ratio or the total water volume were probably low, consistent\nwith brief excursions above the melting point and/or arid climate; (3) if the\nchlorine source was igneous chlorapatite, then Cl-leaching events would require\na (cumulative) time of >10 yr at the melting point; (4) Cl masses, divided by\ncatchment area, give column densities 0.1 - 50 kg Cl/m^2, and these column\ndensities bracket the expected chlorapatite-Cl content for a seasonally-warm\nactive layer. Deep groundwater was not required. Taken together, our results\nare consistent with Mars having a usually cold, horizontally segregated\nhydrosphere by the time chlorides formed.\n", "  The problem of choice of boundary conditions are discussed for the case of\nnumerical integration of the shallow water equations on a substantially\nirregular relief. In modeling of unsteady surface water flows has a dynamic\nboundary partitioning liquid and dry bottom. The situation is complicated by\nthe emergence of sub- and supercritical flow regimes for the problems of\nseasonal floodplain flooding, flash floods, tsunami landfalls. Analysis of the\nuse of various methods of setting conditions for the physical quantities of\nliquid when the settlement of the boundary shows the advantages of using the\nwaterfall type conditions in the presence of strong inhomogeneities landforms.\nWhen there is a waterfall on the border of the computational domain and\nheterogeneity of the relief in the vicinity of the boundary portion may occur,\nwhich is formed by the region of critical flow with the formation of a\nhydraulic jump, which greatly weakens the effect of the waterfall on the flow\npattern upstream.\n", "  In order to extend our previous studies of the unexplained phenomenon of\ncyclic amplitude variations in pulsating red giants, we have used the AAVSO\ntime-series analysis package VSTAR to analyze long-term AAVSO visual\nobservations of 50 such stars, mostly Mira stars. The relative amount of the\nvariation, typically a factor of 1.5, and the time scale of the variation,\ntypically 20-35 pulsation periods, are not significantly different in\nlonger-period, shorter-period, and carbon stars in our sample, and they also\noccur in stars whose period is changing secularly, perhaps due to a thermal\npulse. The time scale of the variations is similar to that in smaller-amplitude\nSR variables, but the relative amount of the variation appears to be larger in\nsmaller-amplitude stars, and is therefore more conspicuous. The cause of the\namplitude variations remains unknown.\n", "  One of the interesting topics in quantum contextuality is the construction\nfor various non-contextual inequalities. By introducing a new structure called\nhyper-graph, we present a general method, which seems to be analytic and\nextensible, to derive the non-contextual inequalities for the qutrit systems.\nBased on this, several typical families of non-contextual inequalities are\ndiscussed. And our approach may also help us to simplify some state-independent\nproofs for quantum contextuality in one of our recent works.\n", "  Ohm's law is one of the most central transport rules stating that the total\nresistance of sequential single resistances is additive. Here we test\nadditivity of resistances in classical systems of interacting colloids driven\nover two energetic barriers in a microchannel, using real-space microscopy\nexperiments, particle-resolved simulations, and dynamical density functional\ntheory. If the barrier separation is comparable to the particle correlation\nlength, the resistance is highly non-additive, such that the added resistance\nof the second barrier can be significantly higher or lower than that of the\nfirst. Surprisingly, for a barrier separation comparable to the particle\ninteraction range, the second barrier can add a {\\it negative} resistance, such\nthat two identical barriers are easier to cross than a single one. We explain\nour results in terms of the structuring of particles trapped between the\nbarriers.\n", "  In addition to hardware wall-time restrictions commonly seen in\nhigh-performance computing systems, it is likely that future systems will also\nbe constrained by energy budgets. In the present work, finite difference\nalgorithms of varying computational and memory intensity are evaluated with\nrespect to both energy efficiency and runtime on an Intel Ivy Bridge CPU node,\nan Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing processor, and an NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU. The\nconventional way of storing the discretised derivatives to global arrays for\nsolution advancement is found to be inefficient in terms of energy consumption\nand runtime. In contrast, a class of algorithms in which the discretised\nderivatives are evaluated on-the-fly or stored as thread-/process-local\nvariables (yielding high compute intensity) is optimal both with respect to\nenergy consumption and runtime. On all three hardware architectures considered,\na speed-up of ~2 and an energy saving of ~2 are observed for the high compute\nintensive algorithms compared to the memory intensive algorithm. The energy\nconsumption is found to be proportional to runtime, irrespective of the power\nconsumed and the GPU has an energy saving of ~5 compared to the same algorithm\non a CPU node.\n", "  We use Fuchsian Reduction to study the behavior near the singularity of a\nclass of solutions of Einstein's vacuum equations. These solutions admit two\ncommuting spacelike Killing fields like the Gowdy spacetimes, but their twist\ndoes not vanish. The spacetimes are also polarized in the sense that one of the\n`gravitational degrees of freedom' is turned off. Examining an analytic family\nof solutions with the maximum number of arbitrary functions, we find that they\nare all asymptotically velocity-term dominated as one approaches the\nsingularity.\n", "  We report development and microwave characterization of rf SQUID\n(Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) qubits, consisting of an\naluminium-based Josephson junction embedded in a superconducting loop patterned\nfrom a thin film of TiN with high kinetic inductance. Here we demonstrate that\nthe systems can offer small physical size, high anharmonicity, and small\nscatter of device parameters. The hybrid devices can be utilized as tools to\nshed further light onto the origin of film dissipation and decoherence in\nphase-slip nanowire qubits, patterned entirely from disordered superconducting\nfilms.\n", "  We report on growth of Te-doped self-catalyzed InAs nanowires by molecular\nbeam epitaxy on silicon (111) substrates. Changes in the wire morphology, i.e.\na decrease in length and an increase in diameter have been observed with rising\ndoping level. Crystal structure analysis based on transmission electron\nmicroscopy as well as X-ray diffraction reveals an enhancement of the zinc\nblende/(wurtzite+zinc blende) segment ratio if Te is provided during the growth\nprocess. Furthermore, electrical two-point measurements show that increased\nTe-doping causes a gain in conductivity. Two comparable growth series,\ndiffering only in As-partial pressure by about $1 \\times 10^{-5}$ while keeping\nall other parameters constant, were analyzed for different Te-doping levels.\nTheir comparison suggests that the crystal structure is stronger affected and\nthe conductivity gain is more distinct for wires grown at a comparably higher\nAs-partial pressure.\n", "  The difference in proton radii measured with $\\mu p$ atoms and with $ep$\natoms and scattering remains an unexplained puzzle. The PSI MUSE proposal is to\nmeasure $\\mu p$ and $e p$ scattering in the same experiment at the same time.\nThe experiment will determine cross sections, two-photon effects, form factors,\nand radii independently for the two reactions, and will allow $\\mu p$ and $ep$\nresults to be compared with reduced systematic uncertainties. These data should\nprovide the best test of lepton universality in a scattering experiment to\ndate, about an order of magnitude improvement over previous tests. Measuring\nscattering with both particle polarities will allow a test of two-photon\nexchange at the sub-percent level, about a factor of four improvement on\nuncertainties and over an order of magnitude more data points than previous low\nmomentum transfer determinations, and similar to the current generation of\nhigher momentum transfer electron experiments. The experiment has the potential\nto demonstrate whether the $\\mu p$ and $ep$ interactions are consistent or\ndifferent, and whether any difference results from novel physics or two-photon\nexchange. The uncertainties are such that if the discrepancy is real it should\nbe confirmed with $\\approx$5$\\sigma$ significance, similar to that already\nestablished between the regular and muonic hydrogen Lamb shift.\n", "  We use strong complementarity to introduce dynamics and symmetries within the\nframework of CQM, which we also extend to infinite-dimensional separable\nHilbert spaces: these were long-missing features, which open the way to a\nwealth of new applications. The coherent treatment presented in this work also\nprovides a variety of novel insights into the dynamics and symmetries of\nquantum systems: examples include the extremely simple characterisation of\nsymmetry-observable duality, the connection of strong complementarity with the\nWeyl Canonical Commutation Relations, the generalisations of Feynman's clock\nconstruction, the existence of time observables and the emergence of quantum\nclocks.\n  Furthermore, we show that strong complementarity is a key resource for\nquantum algorithms and protocols. We provide the first fully diagrammatic,\ntheory-independent proof of correctness for the quantum algorithm solving the\nHidden Subgroup Problem, and show that strong complementarity is the feature\nproviding the quantum advantage. In quantum foundations, we use strong\ncomplementarity to derive the exact conditions relating non-locality to the\nstructure of phase groups, within the context of Mermin-type non-locality\narguments. Our non-locality results find further application to quantum\ncryptography, where we use them to define a quantum-classical secret sharing\nscheme with provable device-independent security guarantees.\n  All in all, we argue that strong complementarity is a truly powerful and\nversatile building block for quantum theory and its applications, and one that\nshould draw a lot more attention in the future.\n", "  We investigate edge properties of a gapful rectangular graphene quantum dot\nin a staggered potential. In such a system gap states with discrete and closely\nspaced energy levels exist that are spatially located on the left or right\nzigzag edge. We find that, although the bulk states outside the energy gap are\nnearly unaffected, spin degeneracy of each gap state is lifted by the staggered\npotential. We have computed the occupation numbers of spin-up and -down gap\nstates at various values of the strength of the staggered potential. The\nelectronic and magnetic properties of the zigzag edges depend sensitively on\nthese numbers. We discuss the possibility of applying this system as a single\nelectron spintronic device.\n", "  Tensor networks give simple representations of complex quantum states. They\nhave proven useful in the study of condensed matter systems and conformal\nfields, and recently have provided toy models of AdS/CFT. Underlying the tensor\nnetwork - AdS/CFT connection is the association of a graph geometry with the\ntensor network. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence tensor network\nmodels have so far been limited to describing static spacetimes. In this thesis\nwe look to extend tensor network models of AdS/CFT by describing the geometry\nof a dynamic spacetime using a tensor network. We provide a review of tensor\nnetworks in the context of AdS/CFT to motivate this extension, before proposing\nmodifications of holographic tensor network models that capture features of\nAdS/CFT with dynamic spacetimes.\n  This thesis includes the results of arXiv submission 1611.06220, along with a\nreview of the relevant literature.\n", "  In this work, we apply the Cole's non-standard form of the FDTD to solve the\ntime dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. We deduce the equations for the\nnon-standard FDTD considering an electronic wave function in the presence of\npotentials which can be higher or lower in comparison with the energy of the\nelectron. The non-standard term is found to be almost the same, except for a\nsine functions which is transformed to a hyperbolic sine function,as the\nargument is imaginary when the potential has higher energy than the electron.\nPerfectly Matched Layers using this methodology are also presented.\n", "  Gaining a detailed understanding of water transport behavior through\nultra-thin polymer membranes is increasingly becoming necessary due to the\nrecent interest in exploring applications such as water desalination using\nnanoporous membranes. Current techniques only measure bulk water transport\nrates and do not offer direct visualization of water transport which can\nprovide insights into the microscopic mechanisms affecting bulk behavior such\nas the role of defects. We describe the use of a technique, referred here as\nBright-Field Nanoscopy (BFN) to directly image the transport of water across\nthin polymer films using a regular bright-field microscope. The technique\nexploits the strong thickness dependent color response of an optical stack\nconsisting of a thin (~25 nm) germanium film deposited over a gold substrate.\nUsing this technique, we were able to observe the strong influence of the\nterminal layer and ambient conditions on the bulk water transport rates in thin\n(~ 20 nm) layer-by-layer deposited multilayer films of weak polyelectrolytes\n(PEMs).\n", "  We report a high-pressure study of tetragonal scheelite-type CaMoO4 up to 29\nGPa. In order to characterize its high-pressure behavior, we have combined\nRaman and optical-absorption measurements with density-functional theory\ncalculations. We have found evidence of a pressure-induced phase transition\nnear 15 GPa. Experiments and calculations agree in assigning the high-pressure\nphase to a monoclinic fergusonite-type structure. The reported results are\nconsistent with previous powder x-ray-diffraction experiments, but are in\ncontradiction with the conclusions obtained from earlier Raman measurements,\nwhich support the existence of more than one phase transition in the pressure\nrange covered by our studies. The observed scheelite-fergusonite transition\ninduces significant changes in the electronic band gap and phonon spectrum of\nCaMoO4. We have determined the pressure evolution of the band gap for the low-\nand high-pressure phases as well as the frequencies and pressure dependences of\nthe Raman-active and infrared-active modes. In addition, based upon\ncalculations of the phonon dispersion of the scheelite phase, carried out at a\npressure higher than the transition pressure, we propose a possible mechanism\nfor the reported phase transition. Furthermore, from the calculations we\ndetermined the pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters and atomic\npositions of the different phases and their room-temperature equations of\nstate. These results are compared with previous experiments showing a very good\nagreement. Finally, information on bond compressibility is reported and\ncorrelated with the macroscopic compressibility of CaMoO4. The reported results\nare of interest for the many technological applications of this oxide.\n", "  The spin states at the surface of epitaxial thin films of hematite, both\nundoped and doped with 1% Ti, Sn or Zn, respectively, were probed with x-ray\nmagnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) spectroscopy. Morin transitions were observed\nfor the undoped (T_M~200 K) and Sn-doped (T_M~300 K) cases, while Zn and\nTi-doped samples were always in the high and low temperature phases,\nrespectively. In contrast to what has been reported for bulk hematite doped\nwith the tetravalent ions Sn4+ and Ti4+, for which T_M dramatically decreases,\nthese dopants substantially increase T_M in thin films, far exceeding the bulk\nvalues. The normalized Fe LII-edge dichroism for T<T_M does not strongly depend\non doping or temperature, except for an apparent increase of the peak\namplitudes for T<100 K. We observed magnetic field-induced inversions of the\ndichroism peaks. By applying a magnetic field of 6.5 T on the Ti-doped sample,\na transition into the T>T_M state was achieved. The temperature dependence of\nthe critical field for the Sn-doped sample was characterized in detail. It was\ndemonstrated the sample-to-sample variations of the Fe LIII-edge spectra were,\nfor the most part, determined solely by the spin orientation state.\nCalculations of the polarization-depedent spectra based on a spin-multiplet\nmodel were in reasonable agreement with the experiment and showed a mixed\nexcitation character of the peak structures.\n", "  In order to optimize the performance of the CRV, reflection studies and aging\nstudies were conducted.\n", "  We demonstrate shadow evaporation-based fabrication of high-quality\nultrasmall normal metal -- insulator -- superconductor tunnel junctions where\nthe thickness of the superconducting electrode is not limited by the\nrequirement of small junction size. The junctions are formed between a film of\nmanganese-doped aluminium acting as the normal conducting electrode, covered by\na thicker, superconducting layer of pure Al. We characterize the junctions by\nsub-gap current--voltage measurements and charge pumping measurements in a\ngate-driven hybrid single-electron transistor, operated as a turnstile for\nsingle electrons. The technique allows to advance towards turnstiles with close\nto ideally thermalized superconducting reservoirs, prerequisite for reaching\nmetrological current quantization accuracy in a hybrid turnstile. We further\npresent an alternative way to realize small junctions with thick Al leads based\non multi-angle deposition. The work enables the future investigation of\nturnstiles based on superconductors other than Al, and benefits various other\nAl tunnel junction devices for which quasiparticle thermalization is essential.\n", "  Mars' surface bears the imprint of valley networks formed billions of years\nago and their relicts can still be observed today. However, whether these\nnetworks were formed by groundwater sapping, ice melt, or fluvial runoff has\nbeen continuously debated. These different scenarios have profoundly different\nimplications for Mars' climatic history, and thus for its habitability in the\ndistant past. Recent studies on Earth revealed that channel networks in arid\nlandscapes with more surface runoff branch at narrower angles, while in humid\nenvironments with more groundwater flow, branching angles are much wider. We\nfind that valley networks on Mars generally tend to branch at narrow angles\nsimilar to those found in arid landscapes on Earth. This result supports the\ninference that Mars once had an active hydrologic cycle and that Mars' valley\nnetworks were formed primarily by overland flow erosion with groundwater\nseepage playing only a minor role.\n", "  Fidelity mechanics is formalized as a framework to investigate quantum\ncritical phenomena in quantum many-body systems. This is achieved by\nintroducing fidelity temperature to properly quantify quantum fluctuations,\nwhich, together with fidelity entropy and fidelity internal energy, constitute\nthree basic state functions in fidelity mechanics, thus enabling us to\nformulate analogues of the four thermodynamic laws and Landauer's principle at\nzero temperature. Fidelity flows are defined and may be interpreted as an\nalternative form of renormalization group flows. Thus, both stable and unstable\nfixed points are characterized in terms of fidelity temperature and fidelity\nentropy: divergent fidelity temperature for unstable fixed points and zero\nfidelity temperature and (locally) maximal fidelity entropy for stable fixed\npoints. In addition, an inherently fundamental role of duality is clarified,\nresulting in a canonical form of the Hamiltonian in fidelity mechanics.\nDualities, together with symmetry groups and factorizing fields, impose the\nconstraints on a fidelity mechanical system, thus shaping fidelity flows from\nan unstable fixed point to a stable fixed point.\n  A detailed analysis of fidelity mechanical state functions is presented for\nthe quantum XY model, the transverse field quantum Ising chain in a\nlongitudinal field, the spin-$1/2$ XYZ model and the XXZ model in a magnetic\nfield.\n", "  The measurements of the top quark mass given are obtained from ATLAS data\ntaken at proton--proton centre-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and $8$ TeV. An\nextraction of the top quark pole mass ($m_{\\mathrm{top}}^{\\mathrm{pole}}$) at\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) is presented. This result is obtained from\nnormalised differential cross-sections in the $t\\bar{t}\\to\\mbox{dilepton}$\nchannel leading to: $m_{\\mathrm{top}}^{\\mathrm{pole}} = 173.2 \\pm 0.9\n(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 0.8 (\\mathrm{syst.}) \\pm 1.2 (\\mathrm{theo.})$ GeV. In\naddition, measurements of $m_{\\mathrm{top}}$ are discussed that are based on\nthe template method performed in three $t\\bar{t}$ decay channels. For all\nresults the uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects. Finally, the 2016\nATLAS combined value of $m_{\\mathrm{top}}$ is: $m_{\\mathrm{top}}=172.84 \\pm\n0.34 (\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 0.61 (\\mathrm{syst.})$ GeV,with a total uncertainty\nof 0.70 GeV, i.e. a precision of 0.4$\\%$.\n", "  The possibility of hybridizing collective electronic motion with mid-infrared\n(mid-IR) light to form surface polaritons has made van der Waals layered\nmaterials a versatile platform for extreme light confinement and tailored\nnanophotonics. Graphene and its heterostructures have attracted particular\nattention because the absence of an energy gap allows for plasmon polaritons to\nbe continuously tuned. Here, we introduce black phosphorus (BP) as a promising\nnew material in surface polaritonics that features key advantages for ultrafast\nswitching. Unlike graphene, BP is a van der Waals bonded semiconductor, which\nenables high-contrast interband excitation of electron-hole pairs by ultrashort\nnear-infrared (near-IR) pulses. We design a SiO$_2$/BP/SiO$_2$ heterostructure\nin which the surface phonon modes of the SiO$_2$ layers hybridize with surface\nplasmon modes in BP that can be activated by photo-induced interband\nexcitation. Within the Reststrahlen band of SiO$_2$, the hybrid interface\npolariton assumes surface-phonon-like properties, with a well-defined frequency\nand momentum and excellent coherence. During the lifetime of the photogenerated\nelectron-hole plasma, coherent polariton waves can be launched by a broadband\nmid-IR pulse coupled to the tip of a scattering-type scanning near-field\noptical microscopy (s-SNOM) setup. The scattered radiation allows us to trace\nthe new hybrid mode in time, energy, and space. We find that the surface mode\ncan be activated within ~50 fs and disappears within 5 ps, as the electron-hole\npairs in BP recombine. The excellent switching contrast and switching speed,\nthe coherence properties, and the constant wavelength of this transient mode\nmake it a promising candidate for ultrafast nanophotonic devices.\n", "  We consider here a Fokker--Planck equation with variable coefficient of\ndiffusion which appears in the modeling of the wealth distribution in a\nmulti-agent society. At difference with previous studies, to describe a society\nin which agents can have debts, we allow the wealth variable to be negative. It\nis shown that, even starting with debts, if the initial mean wealth is assumed\npositive, the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation is such that debts are\nabsorbed in time, and a unique equilibrium density located in the positive part\nof the real axis will be reached.\n", "  We describe the calculation of the one-loop corrections to $H \\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$ and $g g \\to H$ within the four-dimensional unsubtraction/loop-tree\nduality (FDU/LTD) approach. The fact that these corrections are both IR and UV\nfinite is not enough to perform the computation without a proper regularization\nof the intermediate steps. We show how the FDU/LTD method unambiguously leads\nto the proper result with a pure four-dimensional representation of the loop\namplitude. Moreover, this method allows us to obtain very compact expressions\nwhich share the same functional structure independently of the particles\ncirculating the loop. Besides this, asymptotic expansions for the low and high\nmass regime naturally arise as a consequence of the smoothness of the\nintegrands obtained to describe the amplitudes.\n", "  We study magnetic field evolution in AR12371 relating its successive eruptive\nnature. During the disk transit of seven days, the AR launched four sequential\nfast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with long duration M-class\nflares. Morphological study delineates a pre-eruptive coronal sigmoid structure\nabove the polarity inversion line (PIL) similar to Moore et al study. Velocity\nfield derived from tracked magnetograms indicates persistent shear and\nconverging motions of polarity regions about the PIL. While these shear motions\ncontinue, the crossed arms of two sigmoid elbows are being brought to\ninteraction by converging motions at the middle of PIL, initiating\ntether-cutting reconnection of field lines and the onset of CME explosion. The\nsuccessive CMEs are explained by a cyclic process of magnetic energy storage\nand release terming \"sigmoid-to-arcade-to-sigmoid\" transformation driven by\nphotospheric flux motions. Further, the continued shear motions inject helicity\nflux of dominant negative sign, which contributes to core field twist and its\nenergy by building a twisted flux rope (FR). After a limiting value, the excess\ncoronal helicity is expelled by bodily ejection of the FR initiated by some\ninstability as realized by intermittent CMEs. This AR is in contrast to the\nconfined AR12192 with predominant negative signed larger helicity flux but very\nweaker (-0.02turns) normalised coronal helicity content. While predominant\nsigned helicity flux is a requirement for CME eruption, our study suggests the\nmagnetic flux normalized helicity flux as a necessary condition accommodating\nthe role of background flux and appeals a further study of large sample of ARs.\n", "  The reduction of graphene oxide is one of the most facile methods to\nfabricate a large amount of graphene and the reduction rate of graphene oxide\nis related with the quality of synthesized graphene for its possible\napplication. The reduction rate is usually determined by using various\nspectroscopy measurements such as Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform\ninfrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Here we propose\nthat the magnetic data can be used as a means of determining the quality of\ngraphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) by the investigation of\nclose relation between magnetic moment and chemical bonding state. Our\nexperimental findings and previous theoretical studies suggest that hydroxyl\nfunctional groups in GO mainly contribute to Langevin paramagnetism, carboxyl\nfunctional groups in RGO1 act as the source for Pauli paramagnetism, and sp2\nbonding state in RGO2 plays a major role on the diamagnetism. Especially in\nterms of mass production, the magnetic data is useful for decomposing the\nchemical bonding electronic states in graphene-like samples and judging their\nquality.\n", "  I clarify, restate and show more clearly some key points I raised in a number\nof papers that discussed the non-linear gauge-fixing condition and quark\nconfinement. I also correct some errors, which do not detract from the key\nfindings, found in the original papers. However, there are two major\ncorrections I will make in this paper, the first is on the proof of the\nParisi-Sourlas mechanism and the second is on the effective action for the\n'gluons', which leads to a direct proof of gluons being confined inside\nhadrons. The correction also leads to how the mass gap will be calculated,\nwhich was explicitly done in 2D.\n  The starting point is that contrary to the prevailing ideas in the\nliterature, the Coulomb gauge is an incomplete gauge-fixing condition in the\nsense that there are field configurations that cannot be gauge transformed to\nthe Coulomb gauge. In other words the orbit of these configurations will not\nintersect the Coulomb gauge surface. I proposed the non-linear gauge condition\nprecisely because it includes the Coulomb gauge in the high energy (short\ndistance) regime and the quadratic regime (the large distance regime where the\nrunning coupling becomes large), where the gauge fields cannot be gauge\ntransformed to the Coulomb surface. We proposed a new decomposition of the\ngauge potential in the non-linear regime, which involves an isoscalar (the\ndivergence of the gauge field) and a new vector field, which exhibits a mass\ngap and confinement. When we add the quarks, we find that they are localized to\na given distance scale and has an effective four-Fermi action with a linear\npotential. Thus, we have shown a mass gap for gluons and confinement for both\ndynamical quarks and gluons.\n", "  A phenomenological model describing the time-frequency dependence of the\npower spectrum of thin plates vibrating in a wave turbulence regime, is\nintroduced. The model equation contains as basic solutions the Rayleigh-Jeans\nequipartition of energy, as well as the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum of wave\nturbulence. In the Wave Turbulence Theory framework, the model is used to\ninvestigate the self-similar, non-stationary solutions of forced and free\nturbulent vibrations. Frequency-dependent damping laws can easily be accounted\nfor. Their effects on the characteristics of the stationary spectra of\nturbulence are then investigated. Thanks to this analysis, self-similar\nuniversal solutions are given, relating the power spectrum to both the injected\npower and the damping law.\n", "  The direct-write technology for liquid-crystal patterns allows for\nmanufacturing of extreme geometric phase patterned coronagraphs that are\ninherently broadband, e.g. the vector Apodizing Phase Plate (vAPP). We present\non-sky data of a double-grating vAPP operating from 2-5 $\\mu m$ with a\n360-degree dark hole and a decreased leakage term of $\\sim 10^{-4}$. We report\na new liquid-crystal design used in a grating-vAPP for SCExAO that operates\nfrom 1-2.5$\\mu m$. Furthermore, we present wavelength-selective vAPPs that work\nat specific wavelength ranges and transmit light unapodized at other\nwavelengths. Lastly, we present geometric phase patterns for advanced\nimplementations of WFS (e.g. Zernike-type) that are enabled only by this\nliquid-crystal technology.\n", "  We have derived the ionization ratios of twelve elements in the atmosphere of\nthe star 68 Tauri (HD 27962) using an ATLAS9 model atmosphere with 72 layers\ncomputed for the effective temperature and surface gravity of the star. We then\ncomputed a grid of synthetic spectra generated by SYNSPEC49 based on an ATLAS9\nmodel atmosphere in order to model one high resolution spectrum secured by one\nof us (RM) with the echelle spectrograph SOPHIE at Observatoire de Haute\nProvence. We could determine the abundances of several elements in their\ndominant ionization stage, including those defining the Am phenomenon. We thus\nprovide new abundance determinations for 68 Tauri using updated accurate atomic\ndata retrieved from the NIST database which extend previous abundance works.\n", "  This work analyses the transcriptional effects of some biochemical mechanisms\nproposed in previous literature which attempts to explain the differential\nspatial expression of Hedgehog target genes involved in Drosophila development.\nSpecifically, the expression of decapentaplegic and patched, genes whose\ntranscription is believed to be controlled by the activator and repressor forms\nof the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci). This study is based on a\nthermodynamic approach which provides binding equilibrium weighted average rate\nexpressions for genes controlled by transcription factors competing and\n(possibly) cooperating for common binding sites, in the same way that Ci's\nactivator and repressor forms might do. These expressions are refined to\nproduce simpler equivalent formulae allowing their mathematical analysis.\nThanks to this, we can evaluate the correlation between several molecular\nprocesses and biological features observed at tissular level. In particular, we\nwill focus on how high/low/differential affinity and null/total/partial\ncooperation modify the activation/repression regions of the target genes or\nprovoke signal modulation.\n", "  Two-particle angular correlations are studied in $pp$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=\\,13\\,$TeV, collected with the LHCb detector at the LHC. The LHCb\ndetector provides measurement in the very forward region, $2 < \\eta < 5$. This\nregion is complementary to other experiments and allows to explore low\nBjorken-$x$ region. The correlations are studied as a function of difference in\npseudorapidity $\\left(\\Delta\\eta\\right)$ and azimuthal angle\n$\\left(\\Delta\\phi\\right)$ in several $p_T$ and activity classes. Proton-proton\ncollisions are studied using two datasets corresponding to minimum-bias sample\nand a sample obtained via a dedicated trigger to study the highest-activity\nevents.\n", "  The thesis is devoted to a rigorous construction of the Wightman and Green\nfunctions in models of the perturbative quantum field theory in the\nfour-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the framework of the causal\nperturbation theory developed by Epstein and Glaser. In the first part of the\nthesis we give an overview of the Epstein-Glaser approach to the perturbative\nquantum field theory. In the second part we construct the Wightman and Green\nfunctions in a large class of models, generalizing the result due to Blanchard\nand Seneor. To this end, we show the existence of the so-called weak adiabatic\nlimit. The proof of the existence of this limit is valid under the assumption\nthat the time-ordered products satisfy certain normalization condition. We show\nthat this normalization condition may be imposed in all models with interaction\nvertices of the canonical dimension equal to four as well as in all models with\ninteraction vertices of the canonical dimension equal to three provided each of\nthem contains at least one massive field. Moreover, we prove that the\nabove-mentioned normalization condition is compatible with all the standard\nnormalization conditions which are usually imposed on the time-ordered\nproducts. We consider in detail the case of the quantum electrodynamics with a\nmassive or massless, spinor or scalar charged field and certain model of\ninteracting scalar fields with the interaction vertex of dimension three which\nwe call the scalar model. Our result is also applicable to non-abelian\nYang-Mills theories. Using the method developed in the proof of the existence\nof the weak adiabatic limit, we also show the existence of the central\nsplitting solution in the quantum electrodynamics with a massive spinor field.\n", "  We consider a system of two interacting identical Van der Pol Oscillators in\na simple harmonic potential well. The position coupling term between the\noscillators is such that there is a finite delay, i.e; each system takes a\nfinite time to react to the other one. We investigate the amplitude death in\nthe presence of such interaction and we find out the amplitude death regions in\nthe corresponding parameter space.\n", "  We compare the optical properties of the host galaxies of radio-quiet (RQ)\nand radio-loud (RL) Type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to infer whether the\njet production efficiency depends on the host properties or is determined just\nby intrinsic properties of the accretion flows. We carefully select galaxies\nfrom SDSS, FIRST, and NVSS catalogs. We confirm previous findings that the\nfraction of RL AGNs depends on the black-hole (BH) masses, and on the Eddington\nratio. The comparison of the nature of the hosts of RL and RQ AGNs, therefore,\nrequires pair-matching techniques. Matching in BH mass and Eddington ratio\nallows us to study the differences between galaxies hosting RL and RQ AGNs that\nhave the same basic accretion parameters. We show that these two samples differ\npredominantly in the host-galaxy concentration index, morphological type (in\nthe RL sample the frequency of elliptical galaxies becoming larger with\nincreasing radio loudness), and nebular extinction (galaxies with highest radio\nloudness showing only low nebular extinction). Contrary to some previous\nstudies, we find no significant difference between our radio-loud and\nradio-quiet samples regarding merger/interaction features.\n", "  In recent years data have been accumulated at various experiments about\nstates in the heavy quarkonium mass range that seem to be inconsistent with the\nmost simple variants of the quark model. In this contribution it is\ndemonstrated that most of those data are consistent with a dominant molecular\nnature of those states. It is also discussed which kind of observables are\nsensitive to the molecular component and which are not.\n", "  We endorse the context that the cosmological constant problem is a quantum\ncosmology issue. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the $q$-deformed\nWheeler-DeWitt equation of a spatially closed homogeneous and isotropic\nUniverse in the presence of a conformally coupled scalar field. Specifically,\nthe quantum deformed Universe is a quantized minisuperspace model constructed\nfrom quantum Heisenberg-Weyl $\\mathcal U_q(h_4)$ and $\\mathcal U_q(su(1, 1))$\ngroups. These intrinsic mathematical features allow to establish that ($i$) the\nscale factor, the scalar field and corresponding momenta are quantized and\n($ii$) the phase space has a non-equidistance lattice structure. On the other\nhand, such quantum group structure provides us a new framework to discuss the\ncosmological constant problem. Subsequently, we show that a ultraviolet cutoff\ncan be obtained at $10^{-3} eV$, i.e., at a scale much larger than the expected\nPlanck scale. In addition, an infrared cutoff, at the size of the observed\nUniverse, emerges from within such quantum deformation of Universe. In other\nwords, the spectrum of the scale factor is upper bounded. Moreover, we show\nthat the emerged cosmological horizon is a quantum sphere $S^2_q$ or,\nalternatively, a fuzzy sphere $S^2_F$ which explicitly exhibits features of the\nholographic principle. The corresponding number of fundamental cells equals the\ndimension of the Hilbert space and hence, the cosmological constant can be\npresented as a consequence of the quantum deformation of the FLRW\nminisuperspace.\n", "  We report an unusual, non-monotonous dependence of the exchange bias on the\nthickness of the ferromagnetic layer in a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayer\nsystem. We show that in epitaxial CoO/Fe(110) bilayers, the evolution of the Fe\nmagnetic anisotropy, which drives the thickness-induced in-plane\nspin-reorientation process, controls the interfacial CoO spin directions in the\n0-90 degrees range and, consequently, drastically modifies the magnitude of the\nhysteresis loop shift and its dependence on the thickness of the Fe layer. Our\nresults present a new recipe for tailoring the exchange bias and\nantiferromagnetic spin structure by utilizing the spin-reorientation process\nthat occurs in a ferromagnetic layer adjacent to an antiferromagnetic layer.\n", "  Power distribution grids are exploited by Power Line Communication (PLC)\ntechnology to convey high frequency data signals. The natural conformation of\nsuch power line networks causes a relevant part of the high frequency signals\ntraveling through them to be radiated instead of being conducted. This causes\nnot only electromagnetic interference (EMI) with devices positioned next to\npower line cables, but also a consistent deterioration of the signal integrity.\nSince existing PLC channel models do not take into account losses due to\nradiation phenomena, this paper responds to the need of developing accurate\nnetwork simulators. A thorough analysis is herein presented about the conducted\nand radiated effects on the signal integrity, digging into differential mode to\ncommon mode signal conversion due to network imbalances. The outcome of this\nwork allows each network element to be described by a mixed-mode transmission\nmatrix. Furthermore, the classical per-unit-length equivalent circuit of\ntransmission lines is extended to incorporate radiation resistances. The\nresults of this paper lay the foundations for future developments of\ncomprehensive power line network models that incorporate conducted and radiated\nphenomena.\n", "  In this work we have analyzed the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) from the\nTsallis thermostatistics formalism (TTF) point of view. The problem discussed\nhere is a two level system MCE. We have calculated, both analytically and\nnumerically, the entropy of this system as a function of the Tsallis' parameter\n(the well known q-parameter) which value depends on the extensivity (q<1) or\nnon-extensivity (q>1) of the system. Since we consider this MCE not depending\non the initial conditions, which classify our system as a non-extensive one, we\nused several greater than one q-parameters to understand the effect of the\nnonextensive formalism in the entropy as well as the magnetocaloric potential,\n$\\Delta S$. We have plotted several curves that shows precisely the behavior of\nthis effect when dealt with non-extensive statistics.\n", "  We explore the effects of nonstandard neutrino interactions in the lower\ncomponents of the solar neutrino spectrum which are predominant by the vacuum\noscillations. The recent measurements of Borexino experiment between 2011 and\n2015 provide a clean test to study the nonstandard neutrino interactions at the\nsource (sun) and the at solar detector. In this work, first the possible\nstandard model parameters are estimated from the combined data of the low\nenergy regime and then the nonstandard effects at the source, at the detector,\nand from the interplay between source and detector parameters are bounded. The\nsame effects are also investigated for the proposed experiments like LENA and\nJinpin Neutrino Experiment with their projected sensitivities.\n", "  Multistate dynamical processes on networks, where nodes can occupy one of a\nmultitude of discrete states, are gaining widespread use because of their\nability to recreate realistic, complex behaviour that cannot be adequately\ncaptured by simpler binary-state models. In epidemiology, multistate models are\nemployed to predict the evolution of real epidemics, while multistate models\nare used in the social sciences to study diverse opinions and complex phenomena\nsuch as segregation. In this paper, we introduce generalized approximation\nframeworks for the study and analysis of multistate dynamical processes on\nnetworks. These frameworks are degree-based, allowing for the analysis of the\neffect of network connectivity structures on dynamical processes. We illustrate\nthe utility of our approach with the analysis of two specific dynamical\nprocesses from the epidemiological and physical sciences. The approximation\nframeworks that we develop, along with open-source numerical solvers, provide a\nunifying framework and a valuable suite of tools for the interdisciplinary\nstudy of multistate dynamical processes on networks.\n", "  In the last two decades recurrence plots (RPs) were introduced in many\ndifferent scientific disciplines. It turned out how powerful this method is.\nAfter introducing approaches of quantification of RPs and by the study of\nrelationships between RPs and fundamental properties of dynamical systems, this\nmethod attracted even more attention. After 20 years of RPs it is time to\nsummarise this development in a historical context.\n", "  Structures observed in debris disks may be caused by gravitational\ninteraction with planetary or stellar companions. These perturbed disks are\noften thought to indicate the presence of planets and offer insights into the\nproperties of both the disk and the perturbing planets. Gaps in debris disks\nmay indicate a planet physically present within the gap, but such gaps can also\noccur away from the planet's orbit at mean-motion resonances (MMRs), and this\nis the focus of our interest here. We extend our study of planet-disk\ninteraction through MMRs, presented in an earlier paper, to systems in which\nthe perturbing planet has moderate orbital eccentricity, a common occurrence in\nexoplanetary systems. In particular, a new result is that the 3:1 MMR becomes\ndistinct at higher eccentricity, while its effects are absent for circular\nplanetary orbits. We also only consider gravitational interaction with a\nplanetary body of at least 1 Jupiter mass. Our earlier work shows that even a 1\nEarth mass planet can theoretically open an MMR gap; however, given the narrow\ngap that can be opened by a low-mass planet, its observability would be\nquestionable. We find that the widths, locations, and shapes of two prominent\nstructures, the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs, could be used to determine the mass,\nsemimajor axis, and eccentricity of the planetary perturber and present an\nalgorithm for doing so. These MMR structures can be used to narrow the position\nand even determine the planetary properties (such as mass) of any inferred but\nas-yet-unseen planets within a debris disk. We also briefly discuss the\nimplications of eccentric disks on brightness asymmetries and their dependence\non the wavelengths with which these disks are observed.\n", "  We review recent work on a kinetic model for very low temperature dilute Bose\ngases. The brief derivation, expressions for hydrodynamics modes, and the\ncomparison with a experiment on a BEC of $^{87}{\\rm Rb}$ atoms are presented.\n", "  LHCb has recently reported more than $2\\sigma$ deviation from the Standard\nModel prediction in the observable $R_{J/\\psi}$. We study this anomaly in the\nframework of a vector leptoquark along with other lepton flavor universality\nviolating measurements which include $R_{K^{(*)}}$, and $R_{D^{(*)}}$. We show\nthat a chiral vector leptoquark can explain all the aforementioned anomalies\nconsistently while also respecting other experimental constraints.\n", "  First-order phase transitions are characterized by a discontinuous first\nderivative of the Gibbs free energy, so that volumes and entropies are\ndiscontinuous. Such transitions are common in the crystalline state, but\nextremely rare in liquid substances and experimentally evidenced in only one\npure element, phosphorus. Here we report combined in-situ Raman scattering,\nX-ray diffraction and density measurements that support the existence of a\nfirst-order liquid-liquid transition in sulfur at high pressures and\ntemperatures. The transformation involves a sharp density jump between two\nstructurally and dynamically distinct liquids. The first-order phase transition\nproceeds through an initial stage of temperature induced polymerization and a\nfinal stage where the low-density liquid abruptly converts to a denser\npolymeric state. This unique feature is explained by competing effects of\npressure and temperature.\n", "  We report on the role of the coupling of the modes of Mie resonances in\nall-dielectric metamaterials to ensure negative effective index at terahertz\nfrequencies. We study this role according to the lattice period and according\nto the frequency overlapping of the modes of resonance. We show that negative\neffective refractive index requires sufficiently strong mode coupling and that\nfor even more strong mode coupling, the first two modes of Mie resonances are\ndegenerated; the effective refractive index is then undeterminded. We also show\nthat adjusting the mode coupling leads to near-zero effective index, or even\nnull effective index. Further, we compare the mode coupling effect with\nhybridization in metamaterials.\n", "  We prove the existence of lattice fermion zero mode associated with self-dual\nlattice gravity solution.\n", "  Since a long time electron scattering has been envisaged as a powerful and\npreferential tool to investigate nuclear properties. In particular, the (e,e'p)\nknockout reaction has provided a wealth of information on the single particle\n(s.p.) aspects of nuclear structure, on the validity and the limit of the\nindependent particle shell model. The work done for electron scattering is\nextremely useful also for the analysis and the interpretation of neutrino\noscillation experiments, where nuclei are used as neutrino detectors and it is\ncrucial that nuclear effects in neutrino-nucleus interactions are well under\ncontrol. In this contribution it is discussed if and how the work done for\n(e,e'p) can be exploited for the analysis of neutrino-nucleus scattering data.\n", "  It is expected that when the number of light flavors of gauge theories is\nincreased near or beyond some critical value, new and interesting behavior\noccurs. We discuss the qualitative properties of the RG flows for a local\n$SU(3)$ theory with $N_f$ light fundamental flavors for $N_f$ near 12. We\ndiscuss the realization of the chiral symmetry and remind that the Wigner mode\nseems an unlikely alternative. We propose to use a linear sigma model to\ndescribe the light $\\sigma$ masses found in recent lattice calculations for\n$N_f$=8 and 12. Progress made after the conference are reported in\narXiv:1709.09264, where it is claimed that the breaking of the axial $U(1)_A$\nis a key ingredient to get a small $\\sigma$ mass. For SU(3) lattice gauge\ntheory with 12 flavors of unimproved staggered fermions, the scaling of the\nimaginary part of the zeros of the partition function in the complex coupling\nplane is consistent with a first order phase transition for small values of the\nmass. Zech Gelzer and Diego Floor are investigating the scaling near the\nendpoint of the line of first order phase transition in the mass-coupling plane\nwhere a light and weakly interacting scalar is expected. We briefly discuss\nrecent calculations of the second-order R\\'enyi entanglement entropy and\nestimations of the central charge using the Tensor Renormalization Group method\nfor the two-dimensional O(2) model and the possibility to extend these\ncalculations to higher dimensions.\n", "  Solid state materials hosting pseudospin-1 quasiparticles have attracted a\ngreat deal of recent attention. In these materials, the energy band contains of\na pair of Dirac cones and a flat band through the connecting point of the\ncones. As the \"caging\" of carriers with a zero group velocity, the flat band\nitself has zero conductivity. However, in a non-equilibrium situation where a\nconstant electric field is suddenly switched on, the flat band can enhance the\nresulting current in both the linear and nonlinear response regimes through\ndistinct physical mechanisms. Using the ($2+1$) dimensional pseudospin-$1$\nDirac-Weyl system as a concrete setting, we demonstrate that, in the weak field\nregime, the interband current is about twice larger than that for\npseudospin-1/2 system due to the interplay between the flat band and the\nnegative band, with the scaling behavior determined by the Kubo formula. In the\nstrong field regime, the intraband current is $\\sqrt{2}$ times larger than that\nin the pseudospin-1/2 system, due to the additional contribution from particles\nresiding in the flat band. In this case, the current and field follows the\nscaling law associated with Landau-Zener tunneling. These results provide a\nbetter understanding of the role of the flat band in non-equilibrium transport\nand are experimentally testable using electronic or photonic systems.\n", "  Progress on the Intensity Frontier of high energy physics critically depends\non record high intensity charged particles accelerators. Beams in such machines\nbecome operationally limited by coherent beam instabilities, particularly\nenhanced in the regime of strong space charge (SC). Usual methods to control\nthe instabilities, such as octupole magnets, beam feedback dampers and\nemployment of chromatic effects, become less effective and insufficient. In [1]\nit was proposed to employ electron lenses for introduction of sufficient spread\nin particle oscillation frequencies needed for beam stabilization and in [2] it\nwas shown that electron lenses are uniquely effective for Landau damping of\ntransverse beam instabilities in high energy particle accelerators and their\nemployment does not compromise incoherent (single particle) stability, dynamic\naperture and the beam lifetime. Here we consider an important issue of\neffectiveness of the Landau damping with electron lenses in space-charge\ndominated beams and demonstrate that the desired stability can be assured with\nproper choice of the electron beam parameters and current distributions.\n", "  Employing the master equation for a three-level laser driven by coherent\nlight and coupled to a squeezed vacuum reservoir, we obtain stochastic\ndifferential equations associated with the normal ordering. Using the solutions\nof the stochastic differential equations, we calculate the quadrature variance,\nthe squeezing spectrum, the mean photon number, and the variance of the photon\nnumber. It turns out that the degree of squeezing increases with the linear\ngain coefficient or the squeeze parameter. It is also found that the driving\ncoherent light decreases the mean photon number.\n", "  The TREX-DM experiment is conceived to look for low mass WIMPs by means of a\ngas time projection chamber equipped with novel micromegas readout planes at\nthe Canfranc Underground Laboratory. The detector can hold 20 l of pressurized\ngas up to 10 bar, which corresponds to 0.30 kg of Ar, or alternatively, 0.16 kg\nof Ne. The micromegas will be read with a self-triggered acquisition, allowing\nfor effective thresholds below 0.4 keV (electron equivalent). The preliminary\nbackground model, following a complete material screening program, points to\nlevels of the order of 1-10 counts keV-1 kg-1 d-1 in the region of interest,\nmaking TREX-DM competitive. The status of the commissioning, description of the\nbackground model and the corresponding WIMP sensitivity will be presented here.\n", "  HD 27962, also known as 68 Tauri, is a Chemically Peculiar Am star member of\nthe Hyades Open Cluster in the local arm of the Galaxy. We have modeled the\nhigh resolution SOPHIE (R=75000) spectrum of 68 Tauri using updated model\natmosphere and spectrum synthesis to derive chemical abundances in its\natmosphere. In particular, we have studied the effect of the inclusion of\nHyperfine Structure of various Baryum isotopes on the determination of the\nBaryum abundance in 68 Tauri. We have also derived new abundances using updated\naccurate atomic parameters retrieved from the NIST database.\n", "  Resonating valence bond (RVB) theory of high Tc superconductivity, an\nelectron correlation based mechanism, began as an insightful response by\nAnderson, to Bednorz and Muller's discovery of high Tc superconductivity in\ncuprates in late 1986. Shortly a theoretical framework for quantum spin liquids\nand superconductivity was developed. This theory adresses a formidable strong\ncoupling quantum manybody problem, in modern times. It is built on certain key\nexperimental facts: i) survival of a dynamical Mott localization in a metallic\nstate, ii) proliferation of bond singlets and iii) absence of fermi liquid\nquasi particles. After summarising RVB theory I will provide an aerial view of,\nmostly, new superconductors where I believe that, to a large degree RVB\nmechanism is at work and indicate prospects for even higher Tc's.\n", "  We examine collider physics via the spectral power H_l, which utilizes much\nmore detector information than sequential jet reconstruction. We use H_l to\ndefine a novel jet definition and use it to reconstruct both e+e- > qqg and e+e\n> tt final states. We find that a significant amount of pileup can be trivially\nsubtracted from H_l jets, provided that the \"shape\" of pileup can be determined\nahead of time. Finally, we find that future progress with H_l jets will require\nthe addition of degrees of freedom accounting for jet \"shape\" (e.g. radial\nenergy distribution). This should allow the measurement of jet shapes using\nmuch more information than traditional techniques.\n", "  It is described dynamics of a large class of accelerating cosmological models\nin terms of dynamical systems of the Newtonian type. The evolution of the\nmodels is reduced to the motion of a particle in a potential well parameterized\nby the scale factor. This potential function can be reconstructed from distant\nsupernovae type Ia data and many cosmological models represented in terms of\nthe potential becomes in a good agreement with current observational data. It\nis proposed to use the information criteria to overcome this degeneracy within\na class of A) dark energy models and B) simple models basing on modification of\nthe FRW equation. Two class of models can be recommended by the Akaike (AIC)\nand Schwarz (BIC) information criteria: the phantom and $\\Lambda$CDM models.\n", "  The vanishing of the cosmological constant and absence of a massless dilaton\nmight be explained by a duality between a supersymmetric string vacuum in three\ndimensions and a non-supersymmetric string vacuum in four dimensions.\n", "  We consider the Calogero-Degasperis-Ibragimov-Shabat (CDIS) equation and find\nthe complete set of its nonlocal symmetries depending on the local variables\nand on the integral of the only local conserved density of the equation in\nquestion. The Lie algebra of these symmetries turns out to be a central\nextension of that of local generalized symmetries.\n", "  We generalize earlier results of Fokas and Liu and find all locally analytic\n(1+1)-dimensional evolution equations of order $n$ that admit an $N$-shock type\nsolution with $N\\leq n+1$.\n  To this end we develop a refinement of the technique from our earlier work\n(A. Sergyeyev, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen, 35 (2002), 7653--7660), where we\ncompletely characterized all (1+1)-dimensional evolution systems\n$\\bi{u}_t=\\bi{F}(x,t,\\bi{u},\\p\\bi{u}/\\p x,...,\\p^n\\bi{u}/\\p x^n)$ that are\nconditionally invariant under a given generalized (Lie--B\\\"acklund) vector\nfield $\\bi{Q}(x,t,\\bi{u},\\p\\bi{u}/\\p x,...,\\p^k\\bi{u}/\\p x^k)\\p/\\p\\bi{u}$ under\nthe assumption that the system of ODEs $\\bi{Q}=0$ is totally nondegenerate.\nEvery such conditionally invariant evolution system admits a reduction to a\nsystem of ODEs in $t$, thus being a nonlinear counterpart to quasi-exactly\nsolvable models in quantum mechanics.\n  Keywords: Exact solutions, nonlinear evolution equations, conditional\nintegrability, generalized symmetries, reduction, generalized conditional\nsymmetries\n  MSC 2000: 35A30, 35G25, 81U15, 35N10, 37K35, 58J70, 58J72, 34A34\n", "  In this brief note we present a zero-curvature representation for one of the\nnew integrable system found by Mikhailov, Novikov and Wang in nlin.SI/0601046.\n", "  We present the explicit formulae, describing the structure of symmetries and\nformal symmetries of any scalar (1+1)-dimensional evolution equation.
