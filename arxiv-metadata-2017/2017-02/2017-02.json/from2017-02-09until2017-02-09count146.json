Laser-driven process simulation of\nmatter dynamics at ultra-high energy density is proposed for the studies of\nastrophysical compact objects and the early universe.\n", "  In this work a simple method to enforce the positivity-preserving property\nfor general high-order conservative schemes is proposed. The method keeps the\noriginal scheme unchanged and detects critical numerical fluxes which may lead\nto negative density and pressure, and then imposes a cut-off flux limiter to\nsatisfy a sufficient condition for preserving positivity. Though an extra\ntime-step size condition is required to maintain the formal order of accuracy,\nit is less restrictive than those in previous works. A number of numerical\nexamples suggest that this method, when applied on an essentially\nnon-oscillatory base scheme, can be used to prevent positivity failure when the\nflow involves vacuum or near vacuum and very strong discontinuities.\n", "  We analytically investigate the role of entanglement in time-optimal state\nevolution as an appli- cation of the quantum brachistochrone, a general method\nfor obtaining the optimal time-dependent Hamiltonian for reaching a target\nquantum state. As a model, we treat two qubits indirectly cou- pled through an\nintermediate qubit that is directly controllable, which represents a typical\nsituation in quantum information processing. We find the time-optimal unitary\nevolution law and quantify residual entanglement by the two-tangle between the\nindirectly coupled qubits, for all possible sets of initial pure quantum states\nof a tripartite system. The integrals of the motion of the brachistochrone are\ndetermined by fixing the minimal time at which the residual entanglement is\nmaximized. Entan- glement plays a role for W and GHZ initial quantum states,\nand for the bi-separable initial state in which the indirectly coupled qubits\nhave a nonzero value of the 2-tangle.\n", "  On account of the Abel-Galois no-go theorem for the algebraic solution to\nquintic and higher order polynomials, the eigenvalue problem and the associated\ncharacteristic equation for a general noise dynamics in dimension $d$ via the\nChoi-Jamiolkowski approach cannot be solved in general via radicals. We provide\na way around this impasse by decomposing the Choi matrix into simpler, not\nnecessarily positive, Hermitian operators that are diagonalizable via radicals,\nwhich yield a set of `positive' and `negative' Kraus operators. The price to\npay is that the sufficient number of Kraus operators is $d^4$ instead of $d^2$,\nsufficient in the Kraus representation. We consider various applications of the\nformalism: the Kraus repesentation of the 2-qubit amplitude damping channel,\nthe noise resulting from a 2-qubit system interacting dissipatively with a\nvacuum bath; defining the maximally dephasing and purely dephasing components\nof the channel in the new representation, and studying their entanglement\nbreaking and broadcast properties.\n", "  Observatories, Institutes and Centers that support major astronomical\nfacilities have, for decades, played a key role in maximizing the scientific\nreturn from their facilities and telescopes. It is crucial to realize that an\n\"observatory\" is more than simply a telescope or ensemble of telescopes that\nprovide observing opportunities for astronomers. Observatories are at the heart\nof an institutional capability to do things beyond what is possible for\nastronomers themselves to do as individuals. Observatories organize and\nmobilize a range of multidisciplinary skills for achieving a coherent and\nsustainable capability that is central to modern observational astrophysics.\nYet many of the activities and roles carried out by the \"observatory\"\norganization in fulfillment of their mission are not fully recognized by\npolicymakers or senior managers, and often not fully understood even within the\nastronomy community. As we assess the future opportunities for new facilities\nin a challenging budget environment it is important to be cognizant of what\nobservatories do and the roles they play.\n", "  With increasing temperature, ${\\rm Sr}_2{\\rm ScSbO}_6$ undergoes three\nstructural phase transitions at approximately ${\\rm 400K}$, ${\\rm 560K}$ and\n${\\rm 650K}$, leading to the following sequence of phases: $P2_1/n \\rightarrow\nI2/m \\rightarrow I4/m \\rightarrow Fm\\bar{3}m$, making it an ideal candidate to\nstudy the effects of octahedral tilting keeping other parameters fixed. To\nascertain the isolated effects of octahedral distortions, the electronic and\noptical properties of the monoclinic $P2_1/n$ (at room temperature), monoclinic\n$I2/m$ (at ${\\rm 430K}$), tetragonal $I4/m$ (at ${\\rm 613K}$) and the cubic\n$Fm\\bar{3}m$ (at ${\\rm 660K}$) phases have been studied in terms of the\nelectronic structure, dielectric constant, optical conductivity and electron\nenergy loss spectroscopy using density functional theory. ${\\rm Ca}_2{\\rm\nScSbO}_6$, on the other hand, shows only a $P2_1/n$ phase at room temperature\nand its properties have been been compared with the corresponding ${\\rm Sr}$\ncompound. UV-Vis spectroscopic studies of the optical properties of the\nroom-temperature phase of these $d^0$ double perovskite have been performed and\npresence of large direct bandgap for both the compounds have been reported. The\nelectronic bandgaps for the room temperature phases is found to be in good\nagreement with the corresponding experimental values obtained using the\nKubelka-Munk function. Interestingly, in contrast to other Sc-based $d^0$\ndouble perovskites, with increasing octahedral distortions, the effective\n$t_{\\rm 2g}$ bandwidth remains unaffected while the states forming the band\nchange due to changes in unit cell orientation, leading to small effects on the\nelectronic and optical properties.\n", "  Vocabulary learning by children can be characterized by many biases. When\nencountering a new word, children as well as adults, are biased towards\nassuming that it means something totally different from the words that they\nalready know. To the best of our knowledge, the 1st mathematical proof of the\noptimality of this bias is presented here. First, it is shown that this bias is\na particular case of the maximization of mutual information between words and\nmeanings. Second, the optimality is proven within a more general information\ntheoretic framework where mutual information maximization competes with other\ninformation theoretic principles. The bias is a prediction from modern\ninformation theory. The relationship between information theoretic principles\nand the principles of contrast and mutual exclusivity is also shown.\n", "  The radiation reaction radically influences the electron motion in an\nelectromagnetic standing wave formed by two super-intense counter-propagating\nlaser pulses. Depending on the laser intensity and wavelength, either classical\nor quantum mode of radiation reaction prevail, or both are strong. When\nradiation reaction dominates, electron motion evolves to limit cycles and\nstrange attractors. This creates a new framework for high energy physics\nexperiments on an interaction of energetic charged particle beams and colliding\nsuper-intense laser pulses.\n", "  For d at least two and integer n, let c_n = c_n(d) denote the number of\nlength n self-avoiding walks beginning at the origin in the integer lattice\nZ^d, and, for even n, let p_n = p_n(d) denote the number of length n\nself-avoiding polygons in Z^d up to translation. Then the probability under the\nuniform law W_n on self-avoiding walks Gamma of any given odd length n\nbeginning at the origin that Gamma closes -- i.e., that Gamma's endpoint is a\nneighbour of the origin -- is given by W_n ( Gamma closes ) = 2(n+1)\np_{n+1}/c_n. The polygon and walk cardinalities share a common exponential\ngrowth: lim_n c_n^{1/n} = lim_{n even} p_n^{1/n} = mu (where the common value\nmu is called the connective constant). Madras [26] has shown that p_n is at\nmost C n^{-1/2} mu^n in dimension d=2, while the closing probability was\nrecently shown in [12] to satisfy W_n ( Gamma closes ) is at most n^{-1/4 +\no(1)} in any dimension d at least two.\n  Here we establish that (1) W_n ( Gamma closes ) is at most n^{-1/2 + o(1)}\nfor any d at least two; (2) W_n ( Gamma closes ) is at most n^{-4/7 + o(1)} for\na subsequence of odd n, if d = 2; and (3) p_n is at most n^{-3/2 + o(1)} mu^n\nfor a set of even n of full density when d=2.\n  We also argue that the closing probability is bounded above by n^{-(1 - 1/d)\n+ o(1)} on a full density set when d is at least three for a certain variant of\nself-avoiding walk.\n", "  The total duration of drawdowns is shown to provide a moment-free, unbiased,\nefficient and robust estimator of Sharpe ratios both for Gaussian and\nheavy-tailed price returns. We then use this quantity to infer an analytic\nexpression of the bias of moment-based Sharpe ratio estimators as a function of\nthe return distribution tail exponent. The heterogeneity of tail exponents at\nany given time among assets implies that our new method yields significantly\ndifferent asset rankings than those of moment-based methods, especially in\nperiods large volatility. This is fully confirmed by using 20 years of\nhistorical data on 3449 liquid US equities.\n", "  Classically simulating the dynamics of anyonic excitations in two-dimensional\nquantum systems is likely intractable in general because such dynamics are\nsufficient to implement universal quantum computation. However, processes of\ninterest for the study of quantum error correction in anyon systems are\ntypically drawn from a restricted class that displays significant structure\nover a wide range of system parameters. We exploit this structure to\nclassically simulate, and thereby demonstrate the success of, an\nerror-correction protocol for a quantum memory based on the universal Fibonacci\nanyon model. We numerically simulate a phenomenological model of the system and\nnoise processes on lattice sizes of up to 128x128 sites, and find a lower bound\non the error-correction threshold of approximately 0.125 errors per edge, which\nis comparable to those previously known for abelian and (non-universal)\nnonabelian anyon models.\n", "  Whispering gallery modes in GaAs disk resonators reach half a million of\noptical quality factor. These high Qs remain still well below the ultimate\ndesign limit set by bending losses. Here we investigate the origin of residual\noptical dissipation in these devices. A Transmission Electron Microscope\nanalysis is combined with an improved Volume Current Method to precisely\nquantify optical scattering losses by roughness and waviness of the structures,\nand gauge their importance relative to intrinsic material and radiation losses.\nThe analysis also provides a qualitative description of the surface\nreconstruction layer, whose optical absorption is then revealed by comparing\nspectroscopy experiments in air and in different liquids. Other linear and\nnonlinear optical loss channels in the disks are evaluated likewise. Routes are\ngiven to further improve the performances of these miniature GaAs cavities.\n", "  We find exact states of graphene quasiparticles under a time-dependent\ndeformation (sound wave), whose propagation velocity is smaller than the Fermi\nvelocity. To solve the corresponding effective Dirac equation, we adapt the\nVolkov-like solutions for relativistic fermions in a medium under a plane\nelectromagnetic wave. The corresponding electron-deformation quasiparticle\nspectrum is determined by the solutions of a Mathieu equation resulting in band\ntongues warped in the surface of the Dirac cones. This leads to a collimation\neffect of electron conduction due to strain waves.\n", "  In the optical pumping systems based on the pump-probe arrangement, the spin\npolarization of the atoms is generally monitored utilizing the probe laser\nbeam, in which way an extra perturbation must be introduced and thus affects\nthe normal operation of the sensors. By investigating the absorption rate of\nthe circularly polarized pump laser, here we demonstrate the feasibility of\nextracting the electron-spin polarization from the transmitted pump laser\nintensity. We experimentally validate the method in a spin-exchange relaxation\nfree (SERF) magnetometer and the results are in excellent agreement with the\ntheory. The scheme operates in a silent mode and features a real-time\nobservation. We also study the corresponding magnetic field response of the\nSERF magnetometer and a term arising from the diffusion effects has been added\nto the original model to explain the discrepancy of the response.\n", "  We establish some general dynamical properties of lattice many-body systems\nthat are subject to a high-frequency periodic driving. We prove that such\nsystems have a quasi-conserved extensive quantity $H_*$, which plays the role\nof an effective static Hamiltonian. The dynamics of the system (e.g., evolution\nof any local observable) is well-approximated by the evolution with the\nHamiltonian $H_*$ up to time $\\tau_*$, which is exponentially long in the\ndriving frequency. We further show that the energy absorption rate is\nexponentially small in the driving frequency. In cases where $H_*$ is ergodic,\nthe driven system prethermalizes to a thermal state described by $H_*$ at\nintermediate times $t\\lesssim \\tau_*$, eventually heating up to an\ninfinite-temperature state at times $t\\sim \\tau_*$. Our results indicate that\nrapidly driven many-body systems generically exhibit prethermalization and very\nslow heating. We briefly discuss implications for experiments which realize\ntopological states by periodic driving.\n", "  A protocol based on quantum error correction based characterization of\nquantum dynamics (QECCD) is developed for quantum process tomography on a\ntwo-qubit system interacting dissipatively with a vacuum bath. The method uses\na 5-qubit quantum error correcting code that corrects arbitrary errors on the\nfirst two qubits, and also saturates the quantum Hamming bound. The dissipative\ninteraction with a vacuum bath allows for both correlated and independent noise\non the two-qubit system. We study the dependence of the degree of the\ncorrelation of the noise on evolution time and inter-qubit separation.\n", "  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle forms a fundamental element of quantum\nmechanics. Uncertainty relations in terms of entropies were initially proposed\nto deal with conceptual shortcomings in the original formulation of the\nuncertainty principle and, hence, play an important role in quantum\nfoundations. More recently, entropic uncertainty relations have emerged as the\ncentral ingredient in the security analysis of almost all quantum cryptographic\nprotocols, such as quantum key distribution and two-party quantum cryptography.\nThis review surveys entropic uncertainty relations that capture Heisenberg's\nidea that the results of incompatible measurements are impossible to predict,\ncovering both finite- and infinite-dimensional measurements. These ideas are\nthen extended to incorporate quantum correlations between the observed object\nand its environment, allowing for a variety of recent, more general\nformulations of the uncertainty principle. Finally, various applications are\ndiscussed, ranging from entanglement witnessing to wave-particle duality to\nquantum cryptography.\n", "  We report observation of the $\\rm 5S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 5D_{5/2}$ two-photon\ntransition in Rb vapor at 778 nm, using an external cavity diode laser system\nand a heated vapor cell. The spectra in the two isotopes show well-resolved\nhyperfine transitions. The peaks are Doppler free, and have a Lorentzian\nlineshape with a typical linewidth of 2.2 MHz. This linewidth is larger than\nthe natural linewidth of 300 kHz, but is still 5--10 times smaller than the\nlinewidth for single-photon transitions in the D$_2$ line. Since the absolute\nfrequency of this transition is measured with 8 kHz precision, it can form a\nbetter secondary reference in the optical regime compared to the D$_2$ line.\n", "  Symmetry breaking and the emergence of order is one of the most fascinating\nphenomena in condensed matter physics. It leads to a plethora of intriguing\nground states found in antiferromagnets, Mott insulators, superconductors, and\ndensity-wave systems. Exploiting states of matter far from equilibrium can\nprovide even more striking routes to symmetry-lowered, ordered states. Here, we\ndemonstrate for the case of elemental chromium that moderate ultrafast\nphoto-excitation can transiently enhance the charge-density-wave (CDW)\namplitude by up to 30% above its equilibrium value, while strong excitations\nlead to an oscillating, large-amplitude CDW state that persists above the\nequilibrium transition temperature. Both effects result from dynamic\nelectron-phonon interactions, providing an efficient mechanism to selectively\ntransform a broad excitation of the electronic order into a well defined,\nlong-lived coherent lattice vibration. This mechanism may be exploited to\ntransiently enhance order parameters in other systems with coupled degrees of\nfreedom.\n", "  The excitation dynamics of a laser-driven Rydberg gas exhibits a cooperative\neffect due to the interatomic Rydberg-Rydberg interaction, but the large\nmany-body system with inhomogeneous Rydberg coupling is hard to exactly solved\nor numerically study by density matrix equations. In this paper, we find that\nthe laser-driven Rydberg gas with most of the atoms being in the ground state\ncan be described by a simplified interaction model resembling the optical Kerr\neffect if the distance-dependent Rydberg-Rydberg interaction is replaced by an\ninfinite-range coupling. We can then quantitatively study the effect of the\nquantum fluctuations on the Rydberg excitation with the interatomic correlation\ninvolved and analytically calculate the statistical characteristics of the\nexcitation dynamics in the steady state, revealing the quantum signature of the\ndriven-dissipative Rydberg gas. The results obtained here will be of great\ninterest for other spin-1/2 systems with spin-spin coupling.\n", "  We introduce a family of quantum walks on cycles parametrized by their\nliveliness, defined by the ability to execute a long-range move. We investigate\nthe behaviour of the probability distribution and time-averaged probability\ndistribution. We show that the liveliness parameter, controlling the magnitude\nof the additional long-range move, has a direct impact on the periodicity of\nthe limiting distribution. We also show that the introduced model provides a\nmethod for network exploration which is robust against trapping.\n", "  Time resolved electron density measurements in pulsed RF discharges are shown\nusing a hairpin resonance probe using low cost electronics, on par with normal\nLangmuir probe boxcar mode operation. Time resolution of less than one\nmicrosecond has been demonstrated. A signal generator produces the applied\nmicrowave frequency; the reflected waveform is passed through a directional\ncoupler and filtered to remove the RF component. The signal is heterodyned with\na frequency mixer and read by an oscilloscope. At certain points during the\npulse, the plasma density is such that the applied frequency is the same as the\nresonance frequency of the probe/plasma system, creating a dip in the reflected\nsignal. The applied microwave frequency is shifted in small increments in a\nfrequency boxcar routine to determine the density as a function of time. The\nsystem uses a grounded probe to produce low cost, high fidelity, and highly\nreproducible electron density measurements that can work in harsh chemical\nenvironments. Measurements are made in an inductively coupled system, driven by\na single frequency pulsing generator driven at 13.56 MHz and are compared to\nresults from literature.\n", "  A canonical quantization scheme applied to a classical supersymmetric system\nwith quadratic in momentum supercharges gives rise to a quantum anomaly problem\ndescribed by a specific term to be quadratic in Planck constant. We reveal a\nclose relationship between the anomaly and the Schwarzian derivative, and\nspecify a quantization prescription which generates the anomaly-free\nsupersymmetric quantum system with second order supercharges. We also discuss\nthe phenomenon of a coupling-constant metarmorphosis that associates quantum\nsystems with first-order supersymmetry to the systems with the second-order\nsupercharges.\n", "  In nodal-line semimetals, the gaps close along loops in ${\\bf k}$ space,\nwhich are not at high-symmetry points. Typical mechanisms for the emergence of\nnodal lines involve mirror symmetry and the $\\pi$ Berry phase. Here, we show\nvia ab initio calculations that fcc calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr) and ytterbium\n(Yb) have topological nodal lines with the $\\pi$ Berry phase near the Fermi\nlevel, when spin-orbit interaction is neglected. In particular, Ca becomes a\nnodal-line semimetal at high pressure. Owing to nodal lines, the Zak phase\nbecomes either $\\pi$ or 0 depending on the wavavector ${\\bf k}$, and the $\\pi$\nZak phase leads to surface polarization charge. Carriers eventually screen it,\nleaving behind large surface dipoles. In materials with nodal lines, both the\nlarge surface polarization charge and the emergent drumhead surface states\nenhance Rashba splitting when heavy adatoms are present, as we have shown to\noccur in Bi/Sr(111) and in Bi/Ag(111).\n", "  The effect of the geomagnetic Lorentz force on the muon component of\nextensive air shower (EAS) has been studied in a Monte Carlo generated\nsimulated data sample. This geomagnetic field affects the paths of muons in an\nEAS, causing a local contrast or polar asymmetry in the abundance of positive\nand negative muons about the shower axis. The asymmetry can be approximately\nexpressed as a function of transverse separation between the positive and\nnegative muons barycentric positions in the EAS through opposite quadrants\nacross the shower core in the shower front plane. In the present study, it is\nfound that the transverse muon barycenter separation and its maximum value\nobtained from the polar variation of the parameter are higher for Iron\nprimaries than protons for highly inclined showers. Hence, in principle, these\nparameters can be exploited to the measurement of primary cosmic-ray chemical\ncomposition. Possibility of practical realization of the proposed method in a\nreal experiment is briefly discussed.\n", "  Universal multiport interferometers, which can be programmed to implement any\nlinear transformation between multiple channels, are emerging as a powerful\ntool for both classical and quantum photonics. These interferometers are\ntypically composed of a regular mesh of beam splitters and phase shifters,\nallowing for straightforward fabrication using integrated photonic\narchitectures and ready scalability. The current, standard design for universal\nmultiport interferometers is based on work by Reck et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 73,\n58, 1994). We demonstrate a new design for universal multiport interferometers\nbased on an alternative arrangement of beam splitters and phase shifters, which\noutperforms that by Reck et al. Our design occupies half the physical footprint\nof the Reck design and is significantly more robust to optical losses.\n", "  The dependence of particle production on the size of the colliding nuclei is\nanalysed in terms of the thermal model using the canonical ensemble. The\nconcept of strangeness correlation in clusters of sub-volume $V_c$ is used to\naccount for the suppression of strangeness. A systematic analysis is presented\nof the predictions of the thermal model for particle production in collisions\nof small nuclei. The pattern of the maxima of strange-particles-to-pion ratios\nas a function of beam energy is quite special, as they do not occur at the same\nbeam energy and are sensitive to system size. In particular, the\n$\\Lambda/\\pi^+$ ratio shows a clear maximum even for small systems while the\nmaximum in the K$^+/\\pi^+$ ratio is less pronounced\n", "  Prior work has established that all problems in NP admit classical\nzero-knowledge proof systems, and under reasonable hardness assumptions for\nquantum computations, these proof systems can be made secure against quantum\nattacks. We prove a result representing a further quantum generalization of\nthis fact, which is that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a\nquantum zero-knowledge proof system. More specifically, assuming the existence\nof an unconditionally binding and quantum computationally concealing commitment\nscheme, we prove that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum\ninteractive proof system that is zero-knowledge with respect to efficient\nquantum computations.\n  Our QMA proof system is sound against arbitrary quantum provers, but only\nrequires an honest prover to perform polynomial-time quantum computations,\nprovided that it holds a quantum witness for a given instance of the QMA\nproblem under consideration. The proof system relies on a new variant of the\nQMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem in which the local terms are described\nby Clifford operations and standard basis measurements. We believe that the\nQMA-completeness of this problem may have other uses in quantum complexity.\n", "  Integrated optics provides the platform for the experimental implementation\nof highly complex and compact circuits for quantum information applications. In\nthis context integrated waveguide sources represent a powerful resource for the\ngeneration of quantum states of light due to their high brightness and\nstability. However, the confinement of the light in a single spatial mode\nlimits the realization of multi-channel sources. Due to this challenge one of\nthe most adopted sources in quantum information processes, i.e. a source which\ngenerates spectrally indistinguishable polarization entangled photons in two\ndifferent spatial modes, has not yet been realized in a fully integrated\nplatform. Here we overcome this limitation by suitably engineering two\nperiodically poled waveguides and an integrated polarization splitter in\nlithium niobate. This source produces polarization entangled states with\nfidelity of F = 0.973(3) and a test of Bell's inequality results in a violation\nlarger than 14 standard deviations. It can work both in pulsed and continuous\nwave regime. This device represents a new step toward the implementation of\nfully integrated circuits for quantum information applications.\n", "  The identification of orientation relationships (ORs) plays a crucial r\\^ole\nin the understanding of solid phase transformations. In steels, the most common\nmodels of ORs are the ones by Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW) and Kurdjumov-Sachs\n(KS). The defining feature of these and other OR models is the matching of\ndirections and planes in the parent face-centred cubic $\\gamma$-phase to ones\nin the product body-centred cubic/tetragonal $\\alpha/\\alpha'$-phase.\n  In this paper a novel method that identifies transformation strains with ORs\nis introduced and used to develop a new strain-based approach to phase\ntransformation models in steels. Using this approach, it is shown that the\ntransformation strains that leave a close packed plane in the $\\gamma$-phase\nand a close packed direction within that plane unrotated are precisely those\ngiving rise to the NW and KS ORs when a cubic product phase is considered.\nFurther, it is outlined how, by choosing different pairs of unrotated planes\nand directions, other common ORs such as the ones by Pitsch (PT) and\nGreninger-Troiano (GT) can be derived.\n  One of the advantages of our approach is that it leads to a natural\ngeneralisation of the NW, KS and other ORs for different ratios of\ntetragonality $r$ of the product bct $\\alpha'$-phase. These generalised ORs\npredict a sharpening of the transformation textures with increasing\ntetragonality and are thus in qualitative agreement with experiments on steels\nwith varying alloy concentration.\n", "  We show that placing a quantum system in contact with an environment can\nenhance non-Fermi-liquid correlations, rather than destroy quantum effects as\nis typical. The system consists of two quantum dots in series with two leads;\nthe highly resistive leads couple charge flow through the dots to the\nelectromagnetic environment, the source of quantum noise. While the charge\ntransport inhibits a quantum phase transition, the quantum noise reduces charge\ntransport and restores the transition. We find a non-Fermi-liquid intermediate\nfixed point for all strengths of the noise. For strong noise, it is similar to\nthe intermediate fixed point of the two-impurity Kondo model.\n", "  Dirac spinors are important objects in the current literature, the algebraic\nstructure presented in the text-books is a general method to write it, however,\nnot unique. The purpose of the present work is to show an alternative approach\nto construct Dirac spinors, considering the interchange between the Lorentz\nrepresentation space (1/2,0) and (0,1/2) made by the \"Magic of Pauli matrices\"\nand not by parity, as commonly it was thought. As it is well known, parity\noperator is related with the Dirac dynamics. The major focus is to establish\nthe relation between Dirac dynamics with parity operator, the reverse path\nshown in L. D. Speran\\c{c}a (2014).\n", "  We analyze how a multilevel many-electron system in a photon cavity\napproaches the steady state when coupled to external leads. When a plunger gate\nis used to lower cavity photon dressed one- and two-electron states below the\nbias window defined by the external leads, we can identify one regime with\nnonradiative transitions dominating the electron transport, and another regime\nwith radiative transitions. Both transitions trap the electrons in the states\nbelow the bias bringing the system into a steady state. The order of the two\nregimes and their relative strength depends on the location of the bias window\nin the energy spectrum of the system and the initial conditions.\n", "  Lightning in planetary atmospheres is now a well-established concept. Here we\ndiscuss the available detection techniques for, and observations of, planetary\nlightning by spacecraft, planetary landers and, increasingly, sophisticated\nterrestrial radio telescopes. Future space missions carrying lightning-related\ninstrumentation are also summarised, specifically the European ExoMars mission\nand Japanese Akatsuki mission to Venus, which could both yield lightning\nobservations in 2016.\n", "  Single-mode optical nanofibres are a central component of a broad range of\napplications and emerging technologies. Their fabrication has been extensively\nstudied over the past decade, but imaging of the final sub-micrometre products\nhas been restricted to destructive or low-precision techniques. Here we\ndemonstrate an optical scattering-based scanning method that uses a probe\nnanofibre to locally scatter the evanescent field of a sample nanofibre. The\nmethod does not damage the sample nanofibre and is easily implemented only\nusing the same equipment as in a standard fibre puller setup. We demonstrate\nsub-nanometre radial resolution at video rates (0.7 nm in 10 ms) on single mode\nnanofibres, allowing for a complete high-precision profile to be obtained\nwithin minutes of fabrication. The method thus enables non-destructive, fast\nand precise characterisation of optical nanofibers, with applications ranging\nfrom optical sensors and cold atom traps to non-linear optics.\n", "  We investigate the ground-state properties of a disorderd Ising model with\nuniform transverse field on the Bethe lattice, focusing on the quantum phase\ntransition from a paramagnetic to a glassy phase that is induced by reducing\nthe intensity of the transverse field. We use a combination of quantum Monte\nCarlo algorithms and exact diagonalization to compute R\\'enyi entropies,\nquantum Fisher information, correlation functions and order parameter. We\nlocate the transition by means of the peak of the R\\'enyi entropy and we find\nagreement with the transition point estimated from the emergence of finite\nvalues of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and from the peak of the\ncorrelation length. We interpret the results by means of a mean-field theory in\nwhich quantum fluctuations are treated as massive particles hopping on the\ninteraction graph. We see that the particles are delocalized at the transition,\na fact that points towards the existence of possibly another transition deep in\nthe glassy phase where these particles localize, therefore leading to a\nmany-body localized phase.\n", "  A remarkable prediction of the Standard Model is that, in the absence of\ncorrections lifting the energy density, the Higgs potential becomes negative at\nlarge field values. If the Higgs field samples this part of the potential\nduring inflation, the negative energy density may locally destabilize the\nspacetime. We use numerical simulations of the Einstein equations to study the\nevolution of inflation-induced Higgs fluctuations as they grow towards the true\n(negative-energy) minimum. These simulations show that forming a single patch\nof true vacuum in our past light cone during inflation is incompatible with the\nexistence of our Universe; the boundary of the true vacuum region grows outward\nin a causally disconnected manner from the crunching interior, which forms a\nblack hole. We also find that these black hole horizons may be arbitrarily\nelongated---even forming black strings---in violation of the hoop conjecture.\nBy extending the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation to the\nexponentially suppressed tails of the field distribution at large field values,\nwe derive a rigorous correlation between a future measurement of the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio and the scale at which the Higgs potential must receive\nstabilizing corrections in order for the Universe to have survived inflation\nuntil today.\n", "  Quantum oscillations are conventionally understood to arise from the Fermi\nlevel; hence, they are considered to be a proof of the existence of an\nunderlying Fermi surface. In this article, we show that in certain situations\nquantum oscillations can also arise from inside the Fermi sea. We establish\nthis analytically, supporting it with numerical calculations. Possible\nscenarios where such unusual behavior can occur are pointed out. In particular,\nin strongly particle-hole asymmetric insulators, models of which have been\nrecently used in the context of the topological Kondo insulator SmB$_6$, we\nshow that the oscillations arise from inside the filled band, and are not\nrelated to the gap.\n", "  We fit the rotation curves of isolated dwarf galaxies to directly measure the\nstellar mass-halo mass relation ($M_*-M_{200}$) over the mass range $5 \\times\n10^5 < M_{*}/{\\rm M}_\\odot < 10^{8}$. By accounting for cusp-core\ntransformations due to stellar feedback, we find a monotonic relation with\nlittle scatter. Such monotonicity implies that abundance matching should yield\na similar $M_*-M_{200}$ if the cosmological model is correct. Using the 'field\ngalaxy' stellar mass function from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the\nhalo mass function from the $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter Bolshoi simulation, we\nfind remarkable agreement between the two. This holds down to $M_{200} \\sim 5\n\\times 10^9$M$_\\odot$, and to $M_{200} \\sim 5 \\times 10^8$M$_\\odot$ if we\nassume a power law extrapolation of the SDSS stellar mass function below $M_*\n\\sim 10^7$M$_\\odot$.\n  However, if instead of SDSS we use the stellar mass function of nearby galaxy\ngroups, then the agreement is poor. This occurs because the group stellar mass\nfunction is shallower than that of the field below $M_* \\sim 10^9$M$_\\odot$,\nrecovering the familiar 'missing satellites' and 'too big to fail' problems.\nOur result demonstrates that both problems are confined to group environments\nand must, therefore, owe to 'galaxy formation physics' rather than exotic\ncosmology.\n  Finally, we repeat our analysis for a $\\Lambda$ Warm Dark Matter cosmology,\nfinding that it fails at 68% confidence for a thermal relic mass of $m_{\\rm\nWDM} < 1.25$keV, and $m_{\\rm WDM} < 2$keV if we use the power law extrapolation\nof SDSS. We conclude by making a number of predictions for future surveys based\non these results.\n", "  We consider a 2+1 dimensional model of charged fermions coupled to a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field, and study the confinement transition in this\nregime. To elucidate the phase diagram of this model, we introduce a method to\nhandle the Gauss law constraint within sign problem free determinantal quantum\nMonte Carlo, at any charge density. For generic charge densities,\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fluctuations mediate pairing and the ground state is a\ngapped superfluid. Superfluidity also appears in the confined phase. This is\nreminiscent of the BCS-BEC crossover, except that a true zero temperature\ntransition occurs here, with the maximum $T_c$ achieved near the transition. At\nhalf-filling also one obtains a large Fermi surface which is gapped at zero\ntemperature. However, on increasing fermion hopping a $\\pi$-flux phase is\nspontaneously generated, with emergent Dirac fermions that are stable against\npairing. In contrast to a Fermi liquid of electrons, the change in Fermi\nsurface volumes of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fermions occurs without the breaking of\ntranslation symmetry. Unexpectedly, the numerics indicate a single continuous\ntransition between the deconfined Dirac phase and the confined superfluid, in\ncontrast to the naive expectation of a split transition, where a gap to\nfermions precedes confinement.\n", "  The combination of electronic correlations and Fermi surfaces with multiple\nnesting vectors can lead to the appearance of complex multi-Q magnetic ground\nstates, hosting unusual states such as chiral density-waves and quantum Hall\ninsulators. Distinguishing single-Q and multi-Q magnetic phases is however a\nnotoriously difficult experimental problem. Here we propose theoretically that\nthe local density of states near a magnetic impurity, whose orientation may be\ncontrolled by an external magnetic field, can be used to map out the detailed\nmagnetic configuration of an itinerant system and distinguish unambiguously\nbetween single-Q and multi-Q phases. We demonstrate this concept by computing\nand contrasting the LDOS near a magnetic impurity embedded in three different\nmagnetic ground states relevant to iron-based superconductors -- one single-Q\nand two double-Q phases. Our results open a promising avenue to investigate\ncomplex magnetic configurations in itinerant systems via standard scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy, without requiring spin-resolved capability.\n", "  We explore the Mellin representation of correlation functions in conformal\nfield theories in the weak coupling regime. We provide a complete proof for a\nset of Feynman rules to write the Mellin amplitude for a general tree level\nFeynman diagram involving only scalar operators. We find a factorised form\ninvolving beta functions associated to the propagators, similar to tree level\nFeynman rules in momentum space for ordinary QFTs. We also briefly consider the\ncase where a generic scalar perturbation of the free CFT breaks conformal\ninvariance. Mellin space still has some utility and one can consider\nnon-conformal Mellin representations. In this context, we find that the beta\nfunction corresponding to conformal propagator uplifts to a hypergeometric\nfunction.\n", "  Measurement-device-independent entanglement witness (MDI-EW) will always give\nan affirmative certification for witnessing entanglement with untrusted\nmeasurement apparatuses. Using the MDI-EW method, we propose a\nmeasurement-device-independent quantum secret sharing (MDI-QSS) protocol that\nCharlie can securely distribute a key between the two agents Alice and Bob. A\ntight bound for collective attacks can provide good bounds on the long-distance\nMDI-QSS with source flaws. Then we show through numerical simulations that\nusing single-photon source a secure QSS over 136 km can be achieved.\n", "  We put forward a concept to create highly collimated, non-dispersive electron\nbeams in pseudo-relativistic Dirac materials such as graphene or topological\ninsulator surfaces. Combining negative refraction and Klein collimation at a\nparabolic pn junction, the proposed lens generates beams, as narrow as the\nfocal length, that stay focused over scales of several microns and can be\nsteered by a magnetic field without losing collimation. We demonstrate the lens\ncapabilities by applying it to two paradigmatic settings of graphene electron\noptics: We propose a setup for observing high-resolution angle-dependent Klein\ntunneling, and, exploiting the intimate quantum-to-classical correspondence of\nthese focused electron waves, we consider high-fidelity transverse magnetic\nfocusing accompanied by simulations for current mapping through scanning gate\nmicroscopy. Our proposal opens up new perspectives for next-generation graphene\nelectron optics experiments.\n", "  We study high frequency response functions, notably the optical conductivity,\nin the vicinity of quantum critical points (QCPs) by allowing for both detuning\nfrom the critical coupling and finite temperature. We consider general\ndimensions and dynamical exponents. This leads to a unified understanding of\nsum rules. In systems with emergent Lorentz invariance, powerful methods from\nconformal field theory allow us to fix the high frequency response in terms of\nuniversal coefficients. We test our predictions analytically in the large-N\nO(N) model and using the gauge-gravity duality, and numerically via Quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations on a lattice model hosting the interacting\nsuperfluid-insulator QCP. In superfluid phases, interacting Goldstone bosons\nqualitatively change the high frequency optical conductivity, and the\ncorresponding sum rule.\n", "  We observe anisotropic Hanle lineshape with unequal in-plane and out-of-plane\nnon-local signals for spin precession measurements carried out on lateral\nmetallic spin valves with transparent interfaces. The conventional\ninterpretation for this anisotropy corresponds to unequal spin relaxation times\nfor in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientations as for the case of 2D materials\nlike graphene, but it is unexpected in a polycrystalline metallic channel.\nSystematic measurements as a function of temperature and channel length,\ncombined with both analytical and numerical thermoelectric transport models,\ndemonstrate that the anisotropy in the Hanle lineshape is magneto-thermal in\norigin, caused by the anisotropic modulation of the Peltier and Seebeck\ncoefficients of the ferromagnetic electrodes. Our results call for the\nconsideration of such magnetothermoelectric effects in the study of anisotropic\nspin relaxation.\n", "  We investigated the depth dependence of current-induced magnetic fields in a\nbilayer of a normal metal (Au) and a ferrimagnetic insulator (Yttrium Iron\nGarnet - YIG) by using low energy muon spectroscopy (LE-muSR). This allows us\nto explore how these fields vary from the Au surface down to the buried Au|YIG\ninterface, which is relevant to study physics like the spin-Hall effect. We\nobserved a maximum shift of 0.4 G in the internal field of muons at the surface\nof Au film which is in close agreement to the value expected for Oersted\nfields. As muons are implanted closer to the Au|YIG interface the shift is\nstrongly suppressed, which we attribute to the dipolar fields present at the\nAu|YIG interface. Combining our measurements with modelling, we show that\ndipolar fields caused by the finite roughness of the Au|YIG interface\nconsistently explains our observations. Our results, therefore, gauge the\nlimits on the spatial resolution and the sensitivity of LE-muSR to the\nroughness of the buried magnetic interfaces, a prerequisite for future studies\naddressing current induced fields caused by the spin-Hall effect.\n", "  We extend the so-called \"single ring theorem\"[1], also known as the\nHaagerup-Larsen theorem[2], by showing that in the limit when the size of the\nmatrix goes to infinity a particular correlator between left and right\neigenvectors of the relevant non-hermitian matrix $X$, being the spectral\ndensity weighted by the squared eigenvalue condition number, is given by a\nsimple formula involving only the radial spectral cumulative distribution\nfunction of $X$. We show that this object allows to calculate the conditional\nexpectation of the squared eigenvalue condition number. We give examples and we\nprovide cross-check of the analytic prediction by the large scale numerics.\n", "  Background : The emergence of hyperon degrees of freedom in neutron star\nmatter has been associated to first order phase transitions in some\nphenomenological models, but conclusions on the possible physical existence of\nan instability in the strangeness sector are strongly model dependent. Purpose\n: The purpose of the present study is to assess whether strangeness\ninstabilities are related to specific values of the largely unconstrained\nhyperon interactions, and to study the effect of the strange meson couplings on\nphenomenological properties of neutron stars and supernova matter, once these\nlatter are fixed to fulfill the constraints imposed by hypernuclear data.\nMethod : We consider a phenomenological RMF model sufficiently simple to allow\na complete exploration of the parameter space. Results : We show that no\ninstability at supersaturation density exists for the RMF model, as long as the\nparameter space is constrained by basic physical requirements. This is at\nvariance with a non-relativistic functional, with a functional behavior fitted\nthrough ab-initio calculations. Once the study is extended to include the full\noctet, we show that the parameter space allows reasonable radii for canonical\nneutron stars as well as massive stars above two-solar mass, together with an\nimportant strangeness content of the order of 30\\%, slightly decreasing with\nincreasing entropy, even in the absence of a strangeness driven phase\ntransition. Conclusions : We conclude that the hyperon content of neutron stars\nand supernova matter cannot be established with present constraints, and is\nessentially governed by the unconstrained coupling to the strange isoscalar\nmeson.\n", "  Graphene is a nonlinear material which can be used as a saturable absorber,\nfrequency mixer and frequency multiplier. We investigate the third harmonic\ngeneration from graphene lying on different substrates, consisting of a\ndielectric (dispersionless or polar), metalized or non-metalized on the back\nside. We show that the third harmonic intensity emitted from graphene lying on\na substrate, can be increased by orders of magnitude as compared to the\nisolated graphene, due the LO-phonon resonances in a polar dielectric or due to\nthe interference effects in the substrates metalized on the back side. In some\nfrequency intervals, the presence of the polar dielectric substrate compensates\nthe strongly decreasing with $\\omega$ frequency dependence of the third-order\nconductivity of graphene making the response almost frequency independent.\n", "  We developed a method for computing matrix elements of single-particle\noperators in the correlated random phase approximation ground state. Working\nwith the explicit random phase approximation ground state wavefunction, we\nderived practically useful and simple expression for a molecular property in\nterms of random phase approximation amplitudes. The theory is illustrated by\nthe calculation of molecular dipole moments for a set of representative\nmolecules.\n", "  We report an efficient energy-time entangled photon-pair source based on\nfour-wave mixing in a CMOS-compatible silicon photonics ring resonator. Thanks\nto suitable optimization, the source shows a large spectral brightness of\n400\\,pairs of entangled photons /s/MHz for $\\rm 500\\,\\mu W$ pump power.\nAdditionally, the resonator has been engineered so as to generate a frequency\ncomb structure compatible with standard telecom dense wavelength division\nmultiplexers. We demonstrate high-purity energy-time entanglement, i.e., free\nof photonic noise, with near perfect raw visibilities ($>$~98\\%) between\nvarious channel pairs in the telecom C-band. Such a compact source stands as a\npath towards more complex quantum photonic circuits dedicated to quantum\ncommunication systems.\n", "  The vertical structure of stationary thin accretion discs is calculated from\nthe energy balance equation with heat generation due to microscopic ion\nviscosity {\\eta} and electron heat conductivity {\\kappa}, both depending on\ntemperature. In the optically thin discs it is found that for the heat\nconductivity increasing with temperature, the vertical temperature gradient\nexceeds the adiabatic value at some height, suggesting convective instability\nin the upper disc layer. There is a critical Prandtl number, Pr = 4/9, above\nwhich a Keplerian disc become fully convective. The vertical density\ndistribution of optically thin laminar accretion discs as found from the\nhydrostatic equilibrium equation cannot be generally described by a polytrope\nbut in the case of constant viscosity and heat conductivity. In the optically\nthick discs with radiation heat transfer, the vertical disc structure is found\nto be convectively stable for both absorption dominated and scattering\ndominated opacities, unless a very steep dependence of the viscosity\ncoefficient on temperature is assumed. A polytropic-like structure in this case\nis found for Thomson scattering dominated opacity.\n", "  We study the second order response functions of a colloidal particle being\nsubjected to an anharmonic potential. Contrary to typical response measurements\nwhich require an external perturbation, here we experimentally confirm a\nrecently developed approach where the system's susceptibilities up to second\norder are obtained from the particle's equilibrium trajectory [PCCP\n$\\mathrm{{\\bf 17}}$, 6653 (2015)]. The measured susceptibilities are in\nquantitative agreement with those obtained from the response to an external\nperturbation.\n", "  We study Born-Infeld gravity coupled to a static, nonrotating electric field\nin $2+1$ dimensions and find exact analytical solutions. Two families of such\nsolutions represent geodesically complete, and hence nonsingular, spacetimes.\nAnother family represents a point-like charge with a singularity at the center.\nDespite the absence of rotation, these solutions resemble the charged, rotating\nBTZ solution of General Relativity but with a richer structure in terms of\nhorizons. The nonsingular character of the first two families turn out to be\nattached to the emergence of a wormhole structure on their innermost region.\nThis seems to be a generic prediction of extensions of General Relativity\nformulated in metric-affine (or Palatini) spaces, where metric and connection\nare regarded as independent degrees of freedom.\n", "  Excitations in superfluid helium represent attractive mechanical degrees of\nfreedom for cavity optomechanics schemes. Here we numerically and analytically\ninvestigate the properties of optomechanical resonators formed by thin films of\nsuperfluid $^4$He covering micrometer-scale whispering gallery mode cavities.\nWe predict that through proper optimization of the interaction between film and\noptical field, large optomechanical coupling rates $g_0>2\\pi \\times 100$ kHz\nand single photon cooperativities $C_0>10$ are achievable. Our analytical model\nreveals the unconventional behaviour of these thin films, such as thicker and\nheavier films exhibiting smaller effective mass and larger zero point motion.\nThe optomechanical system outlined here provides access to unusual regimes such\nas $g_0>\\Omega_M$ and opens the prospect of laser cooling a liquid into its\nquantum ground state.\n", "  This work supports the existence of extended nonergodic states in the\nintermediate region between the chaotic (thermal) and the many-body localized\nphases. These states are identified through an extensive analysis of static and\ndynamical properties of a finite one-dimensional system with onsite random\ndisorder. The long-time dynamics is particularly sensitive to changes in the\nspectrum and in the structures of the eigenstates. The study of the evolution\nof the survival probability, Shannon information entropy, and von Neumann\nentanglement entropy enables the distinction between the chaotic and the\nintermediate region.\n", "  A microelectromechanical oscillator with a gap of 1.25 $\\mu$m was immersed in\nsuperfluid $^3$He-B and cooled below 250 $\\mu$K at various pressures.\nMechanical resonances of its shear motion were measured at various levels of\ndriving force. The oscillator enters into a nonlinear regime above a certain\nthreshold velocity. The damping increases rapidly in the nonlinear region and\neventually prevents the velocity of the oscillator from increasing beyond the\ncritical velocity which is much lower than the Landau critical velocity. We\npropose that this peculiar nonlinear behavior stems from the escape of\nquasiparticles from the surface bound states into the bulk fluid.\n", "  The problem of having an accurate description of the spacetime around neutron\nstars is of great astrophysical interest. For astrophysical applications, one\nneeds to have a metric that captures all the properties of the spacetime around\na neutron star. Furthermore, an accurate appropriately parameterised metric,\ni.e., a metric that is given in terms of parameters that are directly related\nto the physical structure of the neutron star, could be used to solve the\ninverse problem, which is to infer the properties of the structure of a neutron\nstar from astrophysical observations. In this work we present such an\napproximate stationary and axisymmetric metric for the exterior of neutron\nstars, which is constructed using the Ernst formalism and is parameterised by\nthe relativistic multipole moments of the central object. This metric is given\nin terms of an expansion on the Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates with the multipole\nmoments as free parameters and is shown to be extremely accurate in capturing\nthe physical properties of a neutron star spacetime as they are calculated\nnumerically in general relativity. Because the metric is given in terms of an\nexpansion, the expressions are much simpler and easier to implement, in\ncontrast to previous approaches. For the parameterisation of the metric in\ngeneral relativity, the recently discovered universal 3-hair relations are used\nto produce a 3-parameter metric. Finally, a straightforward extension of this\nmetric is given for scalar-tensor theories with a massless scalar field, which\nalso admit a formulation in terms of an Ernst potential.\n", "  Bethe ansatz solutions of the two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian for any\n(integer and half-integer) $J$ are derived based on the Jordan-Schwinger\n(differential) boson realization of the $SU(2)$ algebra after desired Euler\nrotations, where $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number of the\nsystem. It is shown that solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations can be\nobtained as zeros of the extended Heine-Stieltjes polynomials. Two sets of\nsolutions, with solution number being $J+1$ and $J$ respectively when $J$ is an\ninteger and $J+1/2$ each when $J$ is a half-integer, are obtained. Properties\nof the zeros of the related extended Heine-Stieltjes polynomials for\nhalf-integer $J$ cases are discussed. It is clearly shown that double\ndegenerate level energies for half-integer $J$ are symmetric with respect to\nthe $E=0$ axis. It is also shown that the excitation energies of the `yrast'\nand other `yrare' bands can all be asymptotically given by quadratic functions\nof $J$, especially when $J$ is large.\n", "  We study the large deviations of additive quantities, such as energy or\ncurrent, in stochastic processes with intermittent reset. Via a mapping from a\ndiscrete-time reset process to the Poland-Scheraga model for DNA denaturation,\nwe derive conditions for observing first-order or continuous dynamical phase\ntransitions in the fluctuations of such quantities and confirm these conditions\non simple random walk examples. These results apply to reset Markov processes,\nbut also show more generally that subleading terms in generating functions can\nlead to non-analyticities in large deviation functions of 'compound processes'\nor 'random evolutions' switching stochastically between two or more\nsubprocesses.\n", "  Understanding the effect of pinning on the vortex dynamics in superconductors\nis a key factor towards controlling critical current values. Large-scale\nsimulations of vortex dynamics can provide a rational approach to achieve this\ngoal. Here, we use the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations to study thin\nsuperconducting films with artificially created pinning centers arranged\nperiodically in hexagonal lattices. We calculate the critical current density\nfor various geometries of the pinning centers --- varying their size, strength,\nand density. Furthermore, we shed light upon the influence of pattern\ndistortion on the magnetic-field-dependent critical current. We compare our\nresult directly with available experimental measurements on patterned\nmolybdenum-germanium films, obtaining good agreement. Our results give\nimportant systematic insights into the mechanisms of pinning in these\nartificial pinning landscapes and open a path for tailoring superconducting\nfilms with desired critical current behavior.\n", "  The performance of open-system quantum annealing is adversely affected by\nthermal excitations out of the ground state. While the presence of energy gaps\nbetween the ground and excited states suppresses such excitations, error\ncorrection techniques are required to ensure full scalability of quantum\nannealing. Quantum annealing correction (QAC) is a method that aims to improve\nthe performance of quantum annealers when control over only the problem (final)\nHamiltonian is possible, along with decoding. Building on our earlier work [S.\nMatsuura et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 220501 (2016)], we study QAC using\nanalytical tools of statistical physics by considering the effects of\ntemperature and a transverse field on the penalty qubits in the ferromagnetic\n$p$-body infinite-range transverse-field Ising model. We analyze the effect of\nQAC on second ($p=2$) and first ($p\\geq 3$) order phase transitions, and\nconstruct the phase diagram as a function of temperature and penalty strength.\nOur analysis reveals that for sufficiently low temperatures and in the absence\nof a transverse field on the penalty qubit, QAC breaks up a single, large free\nenergy barrier into multiple smaller ones. We find theoretical evidence for an\noptimal penalty strength in the case of a transverse field on the penalty\nqubit, a feature observed in QAC experiments. Our results provide further\ncompelling evidence that QAC provides an advantage over unencoded quantum\nannealing.\n", "  We present a theoretical study to investigate sub- and super-luminal light\npropagation in a rubidium atomic system consisting of a Rydberg state by using\ndensity matrix formalism. The analysis is performed in a 4-level vee+ladder\nsystem interacting with a weak probe, and strong control and switching fields.\nThe dispersion and absorption profiles are shown for stationary atoms as well\nas for moving atoms by carrying out Doppler averaging at room temperature. We\nalso present the group index variation with control Rabi frequency and observe\nthat a transparent medium can be switched from sub- to super-luminal\npropagation in the presence of switching field. Finally, the transient response\nof the medium is discussed, which shows that the considered 4-level scheme has\npotential applications in absorptive optical switching.\n", "  In this paper we propose an experiment designed to observe a\ngeneral-relativistic effect on single photon interference. The experiment\nconsists of a folded Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with the arms distributed\nbetween a single Earth orbiter and a ground station. By compensating for other\ndegrees of freedom and the motion of the orbiter, this setup aims to detect the\ninfluence of general relativistic time dilation on a spatially superposed\nsingle photon. The proposal details a payload to measure the required effect,\nalong with an extensive feasibility analysis given current technological\ncapabilities.\n", "  Multiple functional ionic and electronic orders are observed in high\ntemperature superconducting cuprates. The charge density wave order is one of\nthem and it is spatially localized in spatial regions of the material. It is\nalso known that the oxygen interstitials introduced by chemical intercalation\nself-organize in different oxygen rich regions corresponding with hole rich\nregions in the Cu$O_2$ layers left empty by the charge density wave order\ndomains. However, what happens in between these two order is not known, and\nneither there is a method to control this spatial separation. Here we\ndemonstrate by using scanning nano X-ray diffraction, that dislocations or\ngrain boundaries in the material can act as boundary between charge density\nwave and oxygen rich phases in a optimally doped La$_2$CuO$_4$$_+$$_y$ high\ntemperature superconductor. Dislocations can be used therefore to control the\nanti-correlation of the charge density wave order with the oxygen interstitials\nin specific portion of the material.\n", "  We consider some general implications of bright gamma-ray counterparts to\nfast radio bursts (FRBs). We show that even if these manifest in only a\nfraction of FRBs, gamma-ray detections with current satellites (including\nSwift) can provide stringent constraints on cosmological FRB models. If the\nenergy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a\nmagnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the\nintergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the\nrequired gamma-ray energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or\nextended emission of short gamma-ray bursts. While this can be reconciled with\nthe rotation energy of compact objects, as expected in many merger scenarios,\nthe prompt outflow that yields the gamma-rays is too dense for radio waves to\nescape. Highly relativistic winds launched in a precursor phase, and forming a\nwind bubble, may avoid the scattering and absorption limits and could yield FRB\nemission. Largely independent of source models, we show that detectable radio\nafterglow emission from gamma-ray bright FRBs can reasonably be anticipated.\nGravitational wave searches can also be expected to provide useful tests.\n", "  Strong constraints on the coupling of new light particles to the Standard\nModel (SM) arise from their production in the hot cores of stars, and the\neffects of this on stellar cooling. For new light particles which have an\neffective in-medium mixing with the photon, plasma effects can result in\nparametrically different production rates to those obtained from a naive\ncalculation. Taking these previously-neglected contributions into account, we\nmake updated estimates for the stellar cooling bounds on light scalars and\nvectors with a variety of SM couplings. In particular, we improve the bounds on\nlight (m <~ keV) scalars coupling to electrons or nucleons by up to 3 orders of\nmagnitude in the coupling squared, significantly revise the supernova cooling\nbounds on dark photon couplings, and qualitatively change the mass dependence\nof stellar bounds on new vectors. Scalars with mass <~ 2 keV that couple\nthrough the Higgs portal are constrained to mixing angle <~ 3*10^-10, which\ngives the dominant bound for scalar masses above ~ 0.2 eV.\n", "  A pair of atoms interacts with non-resonant light via its anisotropic\npolarizability. This effect can be used to tune the scattering properties of\nthe atoms. Although the light-atom interaction varies with interatomic\nseparation as $1/R^{3}$, the effective s-wave potential decreases more rapidly,\nas $1/R^{4}$ such that the field-dressed scattering length can be determined\nwithout any formal difficulty. The scattering dynamics are essentially governed\nby the long-range part of the interatomic interaction and can thus be\naccurately described by an asymptotic model [Crubellier et al., New J. Phys.\n17, 045020 (2015)]. Here we use the asymptotic model to determine the\nfield-dressed scattering length from the s-wave radial component of a\nparticular threshold wave function. Applying our theory to the scattering of\ntwo strontium isotopes, we calculate the variation of the scattering length\nwith the intensity of the non-resonant light. Moreover, we predict the\nintensities at which the scattering length becomes infinite for any pair of\natoms.\n", "  Microresonator frequency combs can be an enabling technology for optical\nfrequency synthesis and timekeeping in low size, weight, and power\narchitectures. Such systems require comb operation in low-noise, phase-coherent\nstates such as solitons, with broad spectral bandwidths (e.g., octave-spanning)\nfor self-referencing to detect the carrier-envelope offset frequency. However,\nstably accessing such states is complicated by thermo-optic dispersion. For\nexample, in the Si3N4 platform, precisely dispersion-engineered structures can\nsupport broadband operation, but microsecond thermal time constants have\nnecessitated fast pump power or frequency control to stabilize the solitons. In\ncontrast, here we consider how broadband soliton states can be accessed with\nsimple pump laser frequency tuning, at a rate much slower than the thermal\ndynamics. We demonstrate octave-spanning soliton frequency combs in Si3N4\nmicroresonators, including the generation of a multi-soliton state with a pump\npower near 40 mW and a single-soliton state with a pump power near 120 mW. We\nalso develop a simplified two-step analysis to explain how these states are\naccessed in a thermally stable way without fast control of the pump laser, and\noutline the required thermal properties for such operation. Our model agrees\nwith experimental results as well as numerical simulations based on a\nLugiato-Lefever equation that incorporates thermo-optic dispersion. Moreover,\nit also explains an experimental observation that a member of an adjacent mode\nfamily on the red-detuned side of the pump mode can mitigate the thermal\nrequirements for accessing soliton states.\n", "  Models of epidemic spreading on complex networks have attracted great\nattention among researchers in physics, mathematics, and epidemiology due to\ntheir success in predicting and controlling scenarios of epidemic spreading in\nreal-world scenarios. To understand the interplay between epidemic spreading\nand the topology of a contact network, several outstanding theoretical\napproaches have been developed. An accurate theoretical approach describing the\nspreading dynamics must take both the network topology and dynamical\ncorrelations into consideration at the expense of increasing the complexity of\nthe equations. In this short survey we unify the most widely used theoretical\napproaches for epidemic spreading on complex networks in terms of increasing\ncomplexity, including the mean-field, the heterogeneous mean-field, the quench\nmean-field, dynamical message-passing, link percolation, and pairwise\napproximation. We build connections among these approaches to provide new\ninsights into developing an accurate theoretical approach to spreading dynamics\non complex networks.\n", "  The equations of particle motion in the FELWI are derived using Hamiltonian\nformalism. In small signal regime the uncoupled one dimensional phase equation\nis derived in the form of pendulum equation. For the practical estimations the\nsame equation along with the equation of particle energy change are solved\nusing perturbation theory and the expressions for gain in FEL regime and\nparticle angle dependence of energy at the exit of first undulator are\nobtained. Results for gain, particle phase and energy change depending on\ndevice and beam parameters are presented.\n", "  We report the identification of seven transient X-ray sources in the nearby\nMagellanic-type galaxy NGC 4449 using the archival multi-epoch X-ray\nobservations conducted with {\\it Chandra}, {\\it XMM-Newton} and {\\it Swift}\ntelescopes over year 2001--2013. Among them, two sources are classified as\nsupersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) because of their soft X-ray color and rest of\nthe sources are X-ray binaries (XRBs). Transient SSSs spectra can be fitted\nwith a blackbody of effective temperature $\\sim 80-105$ eV and luminosities\nwere $\\simeq 10^{37} - 10^{38} {\\rm~erg\\ s}^{-1}$ in 0.3--8 keV. These\nproperties are consistent with the widely accepted model for SSSs, an accreting\nwhite dwarf with the steady nuclear burning on its surface, while the SSS\nemission has also been observed in many post-nova systems. Detailed analysis of\none sufficiently bright SSS revealed the strong short-term variability,\npossibly showing a 2.3 hour periodic modulation, and long-term variability,\ndetectable over 23 years with different X-ray telescopes before year 2003. The\nX-ray properties of four other transients are consistent with neutron star or\nblack hole binaries in their hard state, while the remaining source is most\nlikely an XRB with a quasi-soft X-ray spectrum. Analysis of archival {\\it\nHubble Space Telescope} image data was also conducted, and multiple massive\nstars were found as possible counterparts. We conclude that the X-ray transient\nproperties in NGC 4449 are similar to those in other Magellanic-type galaxies.\n", "  We study for the first time the three-body charmless baryonic decays $\\bar\nB^0_s\\to \\bar p \\Lambda M^+ (p \\bar \\Lambda M^-)$, with $M=\\pi, K$. We find\nthat the branching ratios of $\\bar B^0_s\\to (\\bar p \\Lambda K^+$ and $p\\bar\n\\Lambda K^-)$ and $\\bar B^0_s\\to p\\bar \\Lambda \\pi^-$ are $(5.1\\pm 1.1)\\times\n10^{-6}$ and $(2.8\\pm 1.5)\\times 10^{-7}$, respectively, which agree with\nrecent experimental results reported by the LHCb collaboration. In addition, we\nderive the relations \\mbox{${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_s\\to \\bar p \\Lambda K^+)\\simeq\n(f_K/f_\\pi)^2(\\tau_{B^0_s}/\\tau_{B^0}) {\\cal B}(\\bar B^0\\to \\bar p \\Lambda\n\\pi^+)$} and ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_s\\to p\\bar \\Lambda \\pi^-)/{\\cal B}(\\bar\nB^0_s\\to p\\bar \\Lambda K^-)\\simeq {\\cal B}(B^-\\to p\\bar p \\pi^-)/{\\cal\nB}(B^-\\to p\\bar p K^-)$ to be confronted to future experimental measurements.\nThe fact that all four processes $B^0_s, \\bar B^0_s \\to p\\bar \\Lambda K^-, \\bar\np \\Lambda K^+$ can occur opens the possibility of decay-time-dependent CP\nviolation measurements in baryonic $B$ decays, something that had not been\nrealised before.\n", "  Incorporating functional molecules into sensor devices is an emerging field\nin molecular electronics that aims at exploiting the sensitivity of different\nmolecules to their environment and turning it into an electrical signal. Among\nthe emergent sensors, microelectromechanical systems are promising for their\nextreme sensitivity to mechanical events. However, in order to bring new\nfunctions to these devices, the functionalization of their surface with\nmultifunctional molecules is required. Herein, we present original hybrid\ndevices made of an integrated polymer microelectromechanical resonator\nfunctionalized with switchable magnetic molecules. The change of their\nmechanical properties and geometry induced by the switching of their magnetic\nstate at a molecular level alters the device dynamical behavior, resulting in a\nchange of the resonance frequency. We demonstrate that the device can be\noperated to sense light or thermal excitation. Moreover, thanks to the\ncollective interaction of the switchable molecules, the device behaves as a\nnonvolatile memory. Our results open up broad prospects of new flexible photo\nand thermoactive hybrid devices for molecule based data storage and sensors.\n", "  In this case study, we investigated the effectiveness of peer interaction on\nresponses to in-class clicker questions in an upper-level quantum mechanics\ncourse. We analyzed student performance on clicker questions answered\nindividually and then again after interaction with peers. We also analyzed\nstudent performance by topic. In general, the performance on the clicker\nquestions improved after interaction with peers following individual clicker\nresponses. We also find evidence of co-construction of knowledge in that\nstudents who did not answer the clicker questions individually were able to\nanswer them correctly after discussion with peers. Finally, we discuss the\ntrends in the percentage of students present in class who responded to the\nclicker questions in the allotted time as the semester progressed.\n", "  We have discovered a novel candidate for a spin liquid state in a ruthenium\noxide composed of dimers of $S = $ 3/2 spins of Ru$^{5+}$,Ba$_3$ZnRu$_2$O$_9$.\nThis compound lacks a long range order down to 37 mK, which is a temperature\n5000-times lower than the magnetic interaction scale of around 200 K. Partial\nsubstitution for Zn can continuously vary the magnetic ground state from an\nantiferromagnetic order to a spin-gapped state through the liquid state. This\nindicates that the spin-liquid state emerges from a delicate balance of inter-\nand intra-dimer interactions, and the spin state of the dimer plays a vital\nrole. This unique feature should realize a new type of quantum magnetism.\n", "  We perform hybrid Monte Carlo simulation of (2+1+1)-flavors lattice QCD with\nthe optimal domain-wall fermion (which has the effective 4D Dirac operator\nexactly equal to the Zolotarev optimal rational approximation of the overlap\nDirac operator). The gauge ensemble is generated on the $32^3 \\times 64 $\nlattice with the extent $ N_s = 16 $ in the fifth dimension, and with the\nplaquette gauge action at $ \\beta = 6/g^2 = 6.20 $. The lattice spacing ($ a\n\\simeq 0.063 $ fm) is determined by the Wilson flow, using the value $\n\\sqrt{t_0} = 0.1416(8) $ fm obtained by the MILC Collaboration for the\n$(2+1+1)$-flavors QCD. The masses of $s$ and $c$ quarks are fixed by the masses\nof the vector mesons $ \\phi(1020) $ and $ J/\\psi(3097) $ respectively; while\nthe mass of the $u/d$ quarks is heavier than their physical values, with the\nunitary pion mass $ M_\\pi \\simeq 280$ MeV (and $ M_\\pi L \\simeq 3 $). We\ncompute the point-to-point quark propagators, and measure the time-correlation\nfunctions of meson and baryon interpolators. Our results of the mass spectra of\nthe lowest-lying hadrons containing $ s $ and $ c $ quarks are in good\nagreement with the high energy experimental values, together with the\npredictions of the charmed baryons which have not been observed in experiments.\n", "  The Eisenhart geometric formalism, which transforms an Euclidean natural\nHamiltonian $H=T+V$ into a geodesic Hamiltonian ${\\cal T}$ with one additional\ndegree of freedom, is applied to the four families of quadratically\nsuperintegrable systems with multiple separability in the Euclidean plane.\nFirstly, the separability and superintegrability of such four geodesic\nHamiltonians ${\\cal T}_r$ ($r=a,b,c,d$) in a three-dimensional curved space are\nstudied and then these four systems are modified with the addition of a\npotential ${\\cal U}_r$ leading to ${\\cal H}_r={\\cal T}_r +{\\cal U}_r$.\nSecondly, we study the superintegrability of the four Hamiltonians\n$\\widetilde{{\\cal H}}_r= {\\cal H}_r/ \\mu_r$, where $\\mu_r$ is a certain\nposition-dependent mass, that enjoys the same separability as the original\nsystem ${\\cal H}_r$. All the Hamiltonians here studied describe superintegrable\nsystems on non-Euclidean three-dimensional manifolds with a broken spherically\nsymmetry.\n", "  We demonstrate that our model [Phys.Rev. E91, 032312 (2015)] serves as a\nuseful tool to trace the evolution of equilibrium configurations of\none-component charged particles confined in a disk. Our approach reduces\nsignificantly the computational effort in minimizing the energy of equilibrium\nconfigurations and demonstrates a remarkable agreement with the values provided\nby molecular dynamics calculations. We show that the Comment misrepresents our\npaper, and fails to provide plausible arguments against the formation hexagonal\nstructure for n>200 in molecular dynamics calculations.\n", "  We report the first measurement of 1/f type noise associated with electronic\nspin transport, using single layer graphene as a prototypical material with a\nlarge and tunable Hooge parameter. We identify the presence of two\ncontributions to the measured spin-dependent noise: contact polarization noise\nfrom the ferromagnetic electrodes, which can be filtered out using the\ncross-correlation method, and the noise originated from the spin relaxation\nprocesses. The noise magnitude for spin and charge transport differs by three\norders of magnitude, implying different scattering mechanisms for the 1/f\nfluctuations in the charge and spin transport processes. A modulation of the\nspin-dependent noise magnitude by changing the spin relaxation length and time\nindicates that the spin-flip processes dominate the spin-dependent noise.\n", "  We study the phase behavior of a system of charged colloidal particles that\nare electrostatically bound to an almost flat interface between two fluids. We\nshow that, despite the fact that our experimental system consists of only\n$10^{3}$ - $10^{4}$ particles, the phase behavior is consistent with the theory\nof melting due to Kosterlitz, Thouless, Halperin, Nelson and Young (KTHNY).\nUsing spatial and temporal correlations of the bond-orientational order\nparameter, we classify our samples into solid, isotropic fluid, and hexatic\nphases. We demonstrate that the topological defect structure we observe in each\nphase corresponds to the predictions of KTHNY theory. By measuring the dynamic\nLindemann parameter, $\\gamma_{L}(\\tau)$, and the non-Gaussian parameter,\n$\\alpha_{2}(\\tau)$, of the displacements of the particles relative to their\nneighbors, we show that each of the phases displays distinctive dynamical\nbehavior.\n", "  We explore the effect of interplay of interfacial noise and curvature driven\ndynamics in a binary spin system. An appropriate model is the generalised two\ndimensional voter model proposed earlier (J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. {\\bf 26}, 2317\n(1993)), where the flipping probability of a spin depends on the state of its\nneighbours and is given in terms of two parameters $x$ and $y$. $x = 0.5, y =1$\ncorresponds to the conventional voter model which is purely interfacial noise\ndriven while $x = 1 $ and $y = 1$ corresponds to the Ising model, where\ncoarsening is fully curvature driven. The coarsening phenomena for $0.5< x < 1$\nkeeping $y=1$ is studied in detail. The dynamical behaviour of the relevant\nquantities show characteristic differences from both $x=0.5$ and $1$. The most\nremarkable result is the existence of two time scales for $x\\ge x_c$ where $x_c\n\\approx 0.7$. On the other hand, we have studied the exit probability which\nshows Ising like behaviour with an universal exponent for any value of $x >\n0.5$; the effect of $x$ appears in altering the value of the parameter\noccurring in the scaling function only.\n", "  Interactions in nature can be described by their coupling strength, direction\nof coupling and coupling function. The coupling strength and directionality are\nrelatively well understood and studied, at least for two interacting systems,\nhowever there can be a complexity in the interactions uniquely dependent on the\ncoupling functions. Such a special case is studied here { synchronization\ntransition occurs only due to the time-variability of the coupling functions,\nwhile the net coupling strength is constant throughout the observation time. To\nmotivate the investigation, an example is used to present an analysis of\ncross-frequency coupling functions between delta and alpha brainwaves extracted\nfrom the electroencephalography (EEG) recording of a healthy human subject in a\nfreerunning resting state. The results indicate that time-varying coupling\nfunctions are a reality for biological interactions. A model of phase\noscillators is used to demonstrate and detect the synchronization transition\ncaused by the varying coupling functions, during an invariant coupling\nstrength. The ability to detect this phenomenon is discussed with the method of\ndynamical Bayesian inference, which was able to infer the time-varying coupling\nfunctions. The form of the coupling function acts as an additional dimension\nfor the interactions and it should be taken into account when detecting\nbiological or other interactions from data.\n", "  Understanding exoplanet formation and finding potentially habitable\nexoplanets is vital to an enhanced understanding of the universe. The use of\nnulling interferometry to strongly attenuate the central starlight provides the\nopportunity to see objects closer to the star than ever before. Given that\nexoplanets are usually warm, the 4 microns Mid-Infrared region is advantageous\nfor such observations. The key performance parameters for a nulling\ninterferometer are the extinction ratio it can attain and how well that is\nmaintained across the operational bandwidth. Both parameters depend on the\ndesign and fabrication accuracy of the subcomponents and their wavelength\ndependence. Via detailed simulation it is shown in this paper that a planar\nchalcogenide photonic chip, consisting of three highly fabrication tolerant\nmultimode interference couplers, can exceed an extinction ratio of 60 dB in\ndouble nulling operation and up to 40 dB for a single nulling operation across\na wavelength window of 3.9 to 4.2 microns. This provides a beam combiner with\nsufficient performance, in theory, to image exoplanets.\n", "  We report on an investigation into the low energy dynamics of walking gauge\ntheory. Taking $SU(3)$ Yang Mills with eight flavors of fundamental fermions as\nan example, we discuss the light flavor singlet scalar appearing in the\nspectrum and its implications for low energy physics. We compute the maximal\nisospin $\\pi\\pi$ scattering length at the lightest quark masses yet\ninvestigated for the eight flavor theory. The validity of chiral perturbation\ntheory is assessed, and we discuss motivations for a more extensive effective\nfield theory analysis to be carried out in future work.\n", "  In the presence of boundaries the integrated conformal anomaly is modified by\nthe boundary terms so that the anomaly is non-vanishing in any (even or odd)\ndimension. The boundary terms are due to extrinsic curvature whose exact\nstructure in $d=3$ and $d=4$ has recently been identified. In this note we\npresent a holographic calculation of those terms in two different prescriptions\nfor the holographic description of the boundary CFT. We stress the role of\nsupersymmetry when discussing the holographic description of ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM\non a $4$-manifold with boundaries.\n", "  In the solar limb, linear polarisation is due to anisotropy of the radiation\nfield induced by limb darkening. It is maximal when it is seen parallel to the\nlimb and it vanishes when it is integrated over the spherically-symmetric solar\ndisk. Therefore for distant stars, that present spherical symmetry, linear\npolarisation signatures are very difficult to observe. However strong linear\npolarisation features have been reported in the prototypical red supergiant\nstar alpha Ori (Betelgeuse). With an analytical model we propose to explain\nthem.\n", "  Spin-dependent electric dipole operators are investigated group-theoretically\nfor the emergence of an electric dipole induced by a single spin or by two\nspins, where the spin dependences are completely classified up to the quadratic\norder. For a single spin, a product of spin operators behaves as an even-parity\nelectric quadrupole operator, which differs from an odd-parity electric dipole.\nThe lack of the inversion symmetry allows the even- and odd-parity mixing,\nwhich leads to the electric dipole described by the electric quadruple\noperators. Point-group tables are given for classification of the possible\nspin-dependent electric dipoles and for the qualitative analysis of\nmultiferroic properties, such as an emergent electric dipole moment coexisting\nwith a magnetic moment, electromagnon excitation, and directional dichroism.\nThe results can be applied to a magnetic ion in crystals or embedded in\nmolecules at a site without the inversion symmetry. In the presence of an\ninversion symmetry, the electric dipole does not appear for a single spin. This\nis not the case for the electric dipole induced by two spins with antisymmetric\nspin dependence, which is known as vector spin chirality, in the presence of\nthe inversion center between the two spins. In the absence of the inversion\ncenter, symmetric spin-dependent electric dipoles are also relevant. The\ndetailed analysis of various symmetries of two-spin states is applied to spin\ndimer systems and the related multiferroic properties.\n", "  We present a stochastic turbulence generator based on a vorticity formulation\nwhere the generated turbulent field implicitly fulfills the kinematic\nconstraints of an incompressible flow. The generator allows direct access to\nthe turbulent velocity and vorticity field. Enforcing additional constraints\nsuch as a divergence-free vorticity field and a specified differentiability of\nthe flow field can also implemented directly within this formulation. The\nresulting turbulent field contain improved kinematic properties and may be\nimported into numerical simulations without an excessive loss of energy.\n", "  Objective probability in quantum mechanics is often thought to involve a\nstochastic process whereby an actual future is selected from a range of\npossibilities. Everett's seminal idea is that all possible definite futures on\nthe pointer basis exist as components of a macroscopic linear superposition. I\ndemonstrate that these two conceptions of what is involved in quantum processes\nare linked by two alternative interpretation of the mind-body relation. This\nleads to a fission, rather than divergence, interpretation of Everettian theory\nand to a novel explanation of why a principle of indifference does not apply to\nself-location uncertainty for a post-measurement, pre-observation subject, just\nas Sebens and Carroll claim. Their Epistemic Separability Principle is shown to\narise out of this explanation and the derivation of the Born rule for\nEverettian theory is thereby put on a firmer footing.\n", "  We present ALMA Cycle~2 observations at $0.5^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution of TW\nHya of CS $J=5-4$ emission. The radial profile of the integrated line emission\ndisplays oscillatory features outwards of $1.5^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($\\approx 90$\nau). A dip-like feature at $1.6^{\\prime\\prime}$ is coincident in location,\ndepth and width with features observed in dust scattered light at near-infrared\nwavelengths. Using a thermochemical model indicative of TW Hya, gas-grain\nchemical modelling and non-LTE radiative transfer, we demonstrate that such a\nfeature can be reproduced with a surface density depression, consistent with\nthe modelling performed for scattered light observations of TW Hya. We further\ndemonstrate that a gap in the dust distribution and dust opacity only cannot\nreproduce the observed CS feature. The outer enhancement at\n$3.1^{\\prime\\prime}$ is identified as a region of intensified desorption due to\nenhanced penetration of the interstellar FUV radiation at the exponential edge\nof the disk surface density, which intensifies the photochemical processing of\ngas and ices.\n", "  The era of the next generation of giant telescopes requires not only the\nadvent of new technologies but also the development of novel methods, in order\nto exploit fully the extraordinary potential they are built for. Global Multi\nConjugate Adaptive Optics (GMCAO) pursues this approach, with the goal of\nachieving good performance over a field of view of a few arcmin and an increase\nin sky coverage. In this article, we show the gain offered by this technique to\nan astrophysical application, such as the photometric survey strategy applied\nto the Chandra Deep Field South as a case study. We simulated a close-to-real\nobservation of a 500 x 500 arcsec^2 extragalactic deep field with a 40-m class\ntelescope that implements GMCAO. We analysed mock K-band images of 6000\nhigh-redshift (up to z = 2.75) galaxies therein as if they were real to recover\nthe initial input parameters. We attained 94.5 per cent completeness for source\ndetection with SEXTRACTOR. We also measured the morphological parameters of all\nthe sources with the two-dimensional fitting tools GALFIT. The agreement we\nfound between recovered and intrinsic parameters demonstrates GMCAO as a\nreliable approach to assist extremely large telescope (ELT) observations of\nextragalactic interest.\n", "  A minimum in stellar velocity dispersion is often observed in the central\nregions of disc galaxies. To investigate the origin of this feature, known as a\n{\\sigma}-drop, we analyse the stellar kinematics of a high-resolution N-body +\nsmooth particle hydrodynamical simulation, which models the secular evolution\nof an unbarred disc galaxy. We compared the intrinsic mass-weighted kinematics\nto the recovered luminosity-weighted ones. The latter were obtained by\nanalysing synthetic spectra produced by a new code, SYNTRA, that generates\nsynthetic spectra by assigning a stellar population synthesis model to each\nstar particle based on its age and metallicity. The kinematics were derived\nfrom the synthetic spectra as in real spectra to mimic the kinematic analysis\nof real galaxies. We found that the recovered luminosity-weighted kinematics in\nthe centre of the simulated galaxy are biased to higher rotation velocities and\nlower velocity dispersions due to the presence of young stars in a thin and\nkinematically cool disc, and are ultimately responsible for the {\\sigma}-drop.\n", "  We discuss the Gaia Data Release 1 (September 2016) and preliminary work on\nmaximising the benefit for cool white dwarf (WD) science in advance of the full\nparallax catalogue which will appear around one year later in DR2. The Tycho\ncatalogue is used in conjunction with the all-sky ground based\nastrometric/photometric SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey in order to identify candidate\nfaint common proper motion objects to the Tycho stars. Gaia DR1 is supplemented\nby the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution catalogue containing some 2 million\nparallaxes with Hipparcos-like precision for Tycho stars. While hotter,\nbrighter WDs are present in Tycho, cooler examples are much rarer (if present\nat all) and CPM offers one method to infer precision distances for a\nstatistically useful sample of these very faint WDs.\n", "  White dwarfs are among the most common objects in the stellar halo; however,\ndue to their low luminosity and low number density compared to the stars in the\ndiscs of the Milky Way, they are scarce in the observable volume. Hence, they\nare still poorly understood one hundred years after their discovery as\nrelatively few have been observed. They are crucial to the understanding of\nseveral fundamental properties of the Galaxy {\\mdash} the geometry, kinematics\nand star formation history, as well as to the study of the end-stage of stellar\nevolution for low- and intermediate-mass stars. White dwarfs were traditionally\nidentified by their ultraviolet (UV) excess, however, if they have cooled for a\nlong time, they become so faint in that part of the spectrum that they cannot\nbe seen by the most sensitive modern detectors. Proper motion was then used as\na means to identify white dwarf candidates, due to their relatively large space\nmotions compared to other objects with the same colour. The use of proper\nmotion as a selection criterion has proven effective and has yielded large\nsamples of candidates with the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey and Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. In this work I will further increase the sample size with the\nPanchromatic Synoptic Telescope And Rapid Response System 1\n(Pan{\\ndash}STARRS1).\n  (cont.)\n", "  The magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars of the upper main sequence\nexhibit periodic light, magnetic, radio, and spectroscopic variations that can\nbe adequately explained by a model of a rigidly rotating magnetized star with\npersistent surface structures. The majority of mCP stars rotate at strictly\nconstant periods. However, there are a few mCP stars whose rotation periods\nvary on timescales of decades while the shape of their phase curves remains\nunchanged. In the case of CU Vir and V901 Ori, we have detected cyclic period\nvariations. We demonstrate that the period oscillations of CU Vir may be a\nconsequence of the interaction of the internal magnetic field and differential\nrotation.\n", "  High-mass stars form within star clusters from dense, molecular regions, but\nis the process of cluster formation slow and hydrostatic or quick and dynamic?\nWe link the physical properties of high-mass star-forming regions with their\nevolutionary stage in a systematic way, using Herschel and Spitzer data. In\norder to produce a robust estimate of the relative lifetimes of these regions,\nwe compare the fraction of dense, molecular regions above a column density\nassociated with high-mass star formation, N(H2) > 0.4-2.5 x 10^22 cm^-2, in the\n'starless (no signature of stars > 10 Msun forming) and star-forming phases in\na 2x2 degree region of the Galactic Plane centered at l=30deg. Of regions\ncapable of forming high-mass stars on ~1 pc scales, the starless (or embedded\nbeyond detection) phase occupies about 60-70% of the dense, molecular region\nlifetime and the star-forming phase occupies about 30-40%. These relative\nlifetimes are robust over a wide range of thresholds. We outline a method by\nwhich relative lifetimes can be anchored to absolute lifetimes from large-scale\nsurveys of methanol masers and UCHII regions. A simplistic application of this\nmethod estimates the absolute lifetimes of the starless phase to be 0.2-1.7 Myr\n(about 0.6-4.1 fiducial cloud free-fall times) and the star-forming phase to be\n0.1-0.7 Myr (about 0.4-2.4 free-fall times), but these are highly uncertain.\nThis work uniquely investigates the star-forming nature of high-column density\ngas pixel-by-pixel and our results demonstrate that the majority of high-column\ndensity gas is in a starless or embedded phase.\n", "  In the first part of this lecture, some very basic ideas in supersymmetry and\nsupergravity are presented at a level accessible to readers with modest\nbackground in quantum field theory and general relativity. The second part is\nan outline of a recent paper of the author and his collaborators on the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence applied to the ABJM gauge theory with $\\cal{N} =8$\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  We show that multipartite generation functions can be written in terms of the\nBell polynomials (known as Fa\\`a di Bruno's formula) and the Ruelle spectral\nfunctions, whose spectrum is encoded in the Patterson-Selberg function of the\nhyperbolic three-geometry. We derive an infinite-product formula for the\nChern-Simons partition functions and analyze appropriate q-series which leads\nto the construction of knot invariants. With the help of the Ruelle spectral\nfunctions symmetric and modular properties in infinite-product structure can be\ndescribed.\n", "  Magnetic activity on stars manifests itself in the form of dark spots on the\nstellar surface, that cause modulation of a few percent in the light curve of\nthe star as it rotates. When a planet eclipses its host star, it might cross in\nfront of one of these spots creating a \"bump\" in the transit light curve. By\nmodelling these spot signatures, it is possible to determine the physical\nproperties of the spots such as size, temperature, and location. In turn, the\nmonitoring of the spots longitude provides estimates of the stellar rotation\nand differential rotation. This technique was applied to the star Kepler-17, a\nsolar--type star orbited by a hot Jupiter. The model yields the following spot\ncharacteristics: average radius of $49 \\pm 10$ Mm, temperatures of $5100 \\pm\n300$ K, and surface area coverage of $6 \\pm 4$ \\%. The rotation period at the\ntransit latitude, $-5^\\circ$, occulted by the planet was found to be $11.92 \\pm\n0.05$ d, slightly smaller than the out--of--transit average period of $12.4 \\pm\n0.1$ d. Adopting a solar like differential rotation, we estimated the\ndifferential rotation of Kepler-17 to be $\\Delta\\Omega = 0.041 \\pm 0.005$ rd/d,\nwhich is close to the solar value of 0.050 rd/d, and a relative differential\nrotation of $\\Delta\\Omega/\\Omega=8.0 \\pm 0.9$ \\%. Since Kepler-17 is much more\nactive than our Sun, it appears that for this star larger rotation rate is more\neffective in the generation of magnetic fields than shear.\n", "  Dark and elliptical, coronal cavities yield important clues to the magnetic\nstructures that cradle prominences, and to the forces that ultimately lead to\ntheir eruption. We review observational analyses of cavity morphology, thermal\nproperties (density and temperature), line-of-sight and plane-of-sky flows,\nsubstructure including hot cores and central voids, linear polarization\nsignatures, and observational precursors and predictors of eruption. We discuss\na magnetohydrodynamic interpretation of these observations which argues that\nthe cavity is a magnetic flux rope, and pose a set of open questions for\nfurther study.\n", "  A huge number of technological and biological systems involves the lubricated\ncontact between rough surfaces of soft solids in relative accelerated motion.\nExamples include dynamical rubber seals and the human joints. In this study we\nconsider an elastic cylinder with random surface roughness in accelerated\nsliding motion on a rigid, perfectly flat (no roughness) substrate in a fluid.\nWe calculate the surface deformations, interface separation and the\ncontributions to the friction force and the normal force from the area of real\ncontact and from the fluid. The driving velocity profile as a function of time\nis assumed to be either a sine-function, or a linear multi-ramp function. We\nshow how the squeeze-in and squeeze-out processes, occurring in accelerated\nsliding, quantitatively affect the Stribeck curve with respect to the steady\nsliding. Finally, the theory results are compared to experimental data.\n", "  The present study shows that the performance of CNN is not significantly\ndifferent from the best classical methods and human doctors for classifying\nmediastinal lymph node metastasis of NSCLC from PET/CT images. Because CNN does\nnot need tumor segmentation or feature calculation, it is more convenient and\nmore objective than the classical methods. However, CNN does not make use of\nthe import diagnostic features, which have been proved more discriminative than\nthe texture features for classifying small-sized lymph nodes. Therefore,\nincorporating the diagnostic features into CNN is a promising direction for\nfuture research.\n", "  We perform a brief review on Dirac's procedure applied to the well known\nEinstein's linearized gravity in $N > 2$ dimensions. Considering it as a gauge\ntheory and therefore the manifestation of second class constraints in analogy\nwith the electromagnetic case, focussing our interest in the Coulomb's gauge.\nWe also check the consistency with the Maskawa-Nakajima reduction procedure and\nend with some remarks on both procedures.\n", "  The paper analyzes a general case of an equation of state, which is an\nanalytical function at the critical point of the liquid-vapor first order phase\ntransition of pure substance. It is shown that the equality to zero of the\nfirst- and second-order partial derivatives of pressure with respect to volume\n(density) at the critical point is the consequence of the thermodynamic\nconditions of phase equilibrium. We obtained the relations of critical\nexponents and amplitudes with parameters of the analytical equation of state.\nIt is shown that the substance with the analytical equation of state can have\ncritical exponents of lattice gas which is equivalent to the two dimensional\nIsing model. It is shown that the analytical equation of state can take into\naccount the density fluctuations.\n", "  It is shown that there is no proof of negativity of specific heat of the\nsystem placed in thermostat. It is proved that for the system of particles\nplaced in the thermostat and interacting with each other via uniform potential\nenergy the total energy is linear function of the temperature so the isobaric\nheat capacity is constant along the line of the zero pressure if the latter\nexists and the isobaric heat capacity is negative for value of the degree of\nuniformity of the potential energy negative and more than -2 and it is\nnon-negative if otherwise.\n", "  By means of the updated PARSEC database of evolutionary tracks of massive\nstars, we compute the integrated stellar light, the ionizing photon budget and\nthe supernova rates of young simple stellar populations (SSPs), for different\nmetallicities and IMF upper mass limits. Using CLOUDY we compute and include in\nthe SSP spectra the neb- ular emission contribution. We also revisit the\nthermal and non-thermal radio emission contribution from young stars. Using\nGRASIL we can thus predict the panchromatic spectrum and the main recombination\nlines of any type of star-forming galaxy, including the effects of dust\nabsorption and re-emission. We check the new models against the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of selected well-observed nearby galaxies. From the\nbest-fit models we obtain a consistent set of star formation rate (SFR)\ncalibrations at wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to radio. We also\nprovide analytical calibrations that take into account the dependence on\nmetallcity and IMF upper mass limit of the SSPs. We show that the latter limit\ncan be well constrained by combining information from the observed far\ninfrared, 24 {\\mu}m, 33 GHz and H{\\alpha} luminosities. Another interesting\nproperty derived from the fits is that, while in a normal galaxy the\nattenuation in the lines is significantly higher than that in the nearby\ncontinuum, in individual star bursting regions they are similar, supporting the\nnotion that this effect is due to an age selective extinction. Since in these\nconditions the Balmer decrement method may not be accurate, we provide\nrelations to estimate the attenuation from the observed 24 {\\mu}m or 33 GHz\nfluxes. These relations can be useful for the analysis of young high redshift\ngalaxies.\n", "  The absolute value squared of the probability amplitude corresponding to the\noverlap of an initial state with a continuum wave solution to the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation of the problem, has the physical interpretation provided by the Born\nrule. Here, it is shown that for an open quantum system, the above probability\nmay be written in an exact analytical fashion as an expansion in terms of the\nnon-Hermitian resonance (quasinormal) states and complex poles to the problem\nwhich provides an underlying non-Hermitian character of the Born rule.\n", "  By using an exact analytical approach to the time evolution of decay we\ninvestigate the tunneling decay of ultracold single atoms, to discuss the\nconditions for deviations of the exponential decay law. We find that $R$, given\nby the ratio of the energy of the decaying fragment $\\mathcal{E}_r$ to its\ncorresponding width $\\Gamma_r$, is the relevant quantity in this study. When\n$R$ is less than $0.3$ the decay of the atom goes to a good approximation for\nthe first few lifetimes as $\\exp(-\\Gamma_rt/2\\hbar)t^{-3/2}$. We also find that\nfor values of $R \\sim 1$, the nonexponential behavior occurs in a\npost-exponential regime that goes as $t^{-3}$ after around a dozen of\nlifetimes. The above conditions depend on suitable designed potential\nparameters and suggest that for values $R \\lesssim 1$, the experimental\nverification of nonexponential decay might be possible.\n", "  Low-latency detections of gravitational waves (GWs) are crucial to enable\nprompt follow-up observations to astrophysical transients by conventional\ntelescopes. We have developed a low-latency pipeline using a technique called\nSummed Parallel Infinite Impulse Response (SPIIR) filtering, realized by a\nGraphic Processing Unit (GPU). In this paper, we exploit the new\n\\textit{Maxwell} memory access architecture in NVIDIA GPUs, namely the\nread-only data cache, warp-shuffle, and cross-warp atomic techniques. We report\na 3-fold speed-up over our previous implementation of this filtering technique.\nTo tackle SPIIR with relatively few filters, we develop a new GPU thread\nconfiguration with a nearly 10-fold speedup. In addition, we implement a\nmulti-rate scheme of SPIIR filtering using Maxwell GPUs. We achieve more than\n100-fold speed-up over a single core CPU for the multi-rate filtering scheme.\nThis results in an overall of 21-fold CPU usage reduction for the entire SPIIR\npipeline.\n", "  We present the results of transport measurements in a hybrid system\nconsisting of an arch-shaped quantum point contact (QPC) and a reflector;\ntogether, they form an electronic cavity in between them. On tuning the\narch-QPC and the reflector, asymmetric resonance peak in resistance is observed\nat the one-dimension to two-dimension transition. Moreover, a dip in resistance\nnear the pinch-off of the QPC is found to be strongly dependent on the\nreflector voltage. These two structures fit very well with the Fano line shape.\nThe Fano resonance was found to get weakened on applying a transverse magnetic\nfield, and it smeared out at 100 mT. In addition, the Fano like shape exhibited\na strong temperature dependence and gradually smeared out when the temperature\nwas increased from 1.5 to 20 K. The results might be useful in realising device\nfor quantum information processing.\n", "  We explore the heavy-quark mass region above the charm mass using M\\\"obius\ndomain-wall fermions on fine lattices at $a = 0.080$, $0.055$, and $0.044$ fm.\nWe examine masses and decay constants using a series of heavy quark masses up\nto 3 times the charm quark. We analyze the cutoff effects for heavy quarks\nabove the charm and account for the leading order discretization effects using\nideas from HQET. We extrapolate to the bottom quark mass and report preliminary\nresults for $f_{B}$ and $f_{B_s}$\n", "  The possibility of the appearance of $\\Delta$ isobars in neutron star matter\nand the so called {\\it $\\Delta$ puzzle} is studied in a modified quark meson\ncoupling model where the confining interaction for quarks inside a baryon is\nrepresented by a phenomenological average potential in an equally mixed\nscalar-vector harmonic form. The hadron-hadron interaction in nuclear matter is\nthen realized by introducing additional quark couplings to $\\sigma$, $\\omega$,\nand $\\rho$ mesons through mean-field approximations. The couplings of the\n$\\Delta$ to the meson fields are fixed from available constraints while the\nhyperon couplings are fixed from the optical potential values. It is observed\nthat within the constraints of the mass of the precisely measured massive\npulsars, PSR J0348+0432 and PSR J1614-2230, neutron stars with a composition of\nboth $\\Delta$ isobars and hyperons is possible. It is also observed that with\nan increase in the vector coupling strength of the $\\Delta$ isobars there is a\ndecrease in the radius of the neutron stars.\n", "  Solar energetic particles acceleration by a shock wave accompanying a coronal\nmass ejection (CME) is studied. The description of the accelerated particle\nspectrum evolution is based on the numerical calculation of the diffusive\ntransport equation with a set of realistic parameters. The relation between the\nCME and the shock speeds, which depend on the initial CME radius, is\ndetermined. Depending on the initial CME radius, its speed, and the magnetic\nenergy of the scattering Alfven waves, the accelerated particle spectrum is\nestablished during 10-60 minutes from the beginning of CME motion. The maximum\nenergies of particles reach 0.1-10 GeV. The CME radii of 3-5 $R_\\odot$ and the\nshock radii of 5-10 $R_\\odot$ agree with observations. The calculated particle\nspectra agree with the observed ones in events registered by ground-based\ndetectors if the turbulence spectrum in the solar corona significantly differs\nfrom the Kolmogorov one.\n", "  The transport of a walker in rocking feedback-controlled ratchets are\ninvestigated. The walker consists of two coupled \"feet\" that allow the\ninterchange of the order of the particles while the walker moves. In the\nunderdamped case, the deterministic dynamics of the walker in a tilted\nasymmetric ratchet with an external periodic force is considered. It is found\nthat the delayed feedback ratchets with a switching-on-and-off dependence of\nthe states of the system can lead to the absolute negative mobility (ANM). In\nsuch a novel phenomenon the particles move against the bias. Moreover, the\nwalker can acquire a series of resonant steps for different values of the\ncurrent. Remarkably, it is interesting to find that the resonant current of the\nwalker are induced by the phase locked motion that corresponds to the\nsynchronization of the motion with the change in the frequency of the external\ndriving. These resonant steps can be well predicted in terms of time-space\nsymmetry analysis, which is in good agreement with dynamics simulations. The\ntransport performances can be optimized and furthermore controlled by suitably\nadjusting the parameters of the delayed-feedback ratchets.\n", "  We propose and analyze theoretically an approach for realizing a tunable\noptical phased-array antenna utilizing the properties of VO2 for electronic\nbeam steering applications in the near-IR spectral range. The device is based\non a 1D array of slot nano-antennas engraved in a thin Au film grown over VO2\nlayer. The tuning is obtained by inducing a temperature gradient over the\ndevice, which changes the refractive index of the VO2, and hence modifies the\nphase response of the elements comprising the array, by producing a thermal\ngradient within the underlying PCM layer. Using a 10-element array, we show\nthat an incident beam can be steered up to with respect to the normal, by\napplying a gradient of less than 10{\\deg}C.\n", "  Many observational records critically rely on our ability to merge different\n(and not necessarily overlapping) observations into a single composite. We\nprovide a novel and fully-traceable approach for doing so, which relies on a\nmulti-scale maximum likelihood estimator. This approach overcomes the problem\nof data gaps in a natural way and uses data-driven estimates of the\nuncertainties. We apply it to the total solar irradiance (TSI) composite, which\nis currently being revised and is critical to our understanding of solar\nradiative forcing. While the final composite is pending decisions on what\ncorrections to apply to the original observations, we find that the new\ncomposite is in closest agreement with the PMOD composite and the NRLTSI2\nmodel. In addition, we evaluate long-term uncertainties in the TSI, which\nreveal a 1/f scaling\n", "  We introduce an ultrasensitive detection technique for refractive index (RI)\nsensing based on an array of nanometer scale slot-antennas milled in a thin\ngold layer using a single lithographic step. Our experimental figures of merit\n(FOMs) of 140-210 in the telecom wavelength range approach the fundamental\nlimit for standard propagating SPR sensors (~250).The underlying mechanism\nenabling this is the combination of a narrowband resonance of the slot-antennas\nwith degeneracy breaking of Wood anomaly under slightly non-perpendicular\nillumination. In addition, we explore the sensitivity of the device to the\ndepth of the analyte layer. This concept can be easily tuned to any desired\nwavelength and RI range by modifying the slot dimensions and the array spacing,\nthus rendering it highly useful for numerous sensing applications.\n", "  The antisymmetry of a fermionic quantum state has a marked effect on its\nentanglement properties. Recently, Carlen, Lieb and Reuvers (CLR) studied this\neffect, in particular concerning the entropy of the two-body reduced density\nmatrix of a fermionic state. They conjecture that this entropy is minimized by\nSlater determinants. We use tools from quantum information theory to make\nprogress on their conjecture, proving it when the dimension of the underlying\nHilbert space is not too large. We also derive general properties of the\nentropy of the $k$-body reduced density matrix as a function of $k$: It is\nconcave for all $k$ and non-decreasing for all $k\\leq N/2$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of fermionic particles. We can apply these general facts to improve the\nbound of CLR in all dimensions.\n", "  The ordering of a multilayer consisting of DSPC bilayers on a silica sol\nsubstrate is studied within the model-independent approach to the\nreconstruction of profiles of the electron density from X-ray reflectometry\ndata. It is found that the electroporation of bilayers in the field of anion\nsilica nanoparticles significantly accelerates the process of their saturation\nwith Na+ and H2O, which explains both a relatively small time of formation of\nthe structure of the multilayer of 10^5 - 7x10^5 s and ~13 % excess of the\nelectron density in it.\n", "  We study a strongly interacting dense hard-sphere system confined between two\nparallel plates by event-driven molecular dynamics simulations to address the\nfundamental question of the nature of the 3D to 2D crossover. As the fluid\nbecomes more and more confined the dynamics of the transverse and lateral\ndegrees of freedom decouple, which is accompanied by a diverging time scale\nseparating 2D from 3D behavior. Relying on the time-correlation function of the\ntransversal kinetic energy the scaling behavior and its density-dependence is\nexplored. Surprisingly, our simulations reveal that its time-dependence becomes\npurely exponential such that memory effects can be ignored. We rationalize our\nfindings quantitatively in terms of an analytic theory which becomes exact in\nthe limit of strong confinement.\n", "  In this paper, we collect a sample of 81 ellipsoidal red giant binaries in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and we study their orbital natures\nindividually and statistically. The sample contains 59 systems with circular\norbits and 22 systems with eccentric orbits. We derive orbital solutions using\nthe 2010 version of the Wilson-Devinney code. The sample is selection-bias\ncorrected, and the orbital parameter distributions are compared to model\npredictions for the LMC and to observations in the solar vicinity. The masses\nof the red giant primaries are found to range from about 0.6 to 9 Msun with a\npeak at around 1.5 Msun, in agreement with studies of the star formation\nhistory of the LMC, which find a burst of star formation beginning around 4 Gyr\nago. The observed distribution of mass ratios q=m2/m1 is more consistent with\nthe flat q distribution derived for the solar vicinity by Raghavan et al. than\nit is with the solar vicinity q distribution derived by Duquennoy & Mayor.\nThere is no evidence for an excess number of systems with equal mass\ncomponents. We find that about 20% of the ellipsoidal binaries have eccentric\norbits, twice the fraction estimated by Soszynski et al. Our eccentricity\nevolution test shows that the existence of eccentric ellipsoidal red giant\nbinaries on the upper parts of the red giant branch (RGB) can only be explained\nif tidal circularization rates are ~1/100 the rates given by the usual theory\nof tidal dissipation in convective stars.\n", "  We perform hydrodynamic simulations of mass transfer in binaries that contain\na white dwarf and a neutron star (WD-NS binaries), and measure the specific\nangular momentum of material lost from the binary in disc winds. By\nincorporating our results within a long-term evolution model we measure the\nlong-term stability of mass transfer in these binaries. We find that only\nbinaries containing helium white dwarfs with masses less than a critical mass\nof $M_{\\rm WD,crit}=0.2\\,M_\\odot$ undergo stable mass transfer and evolve into\nultra-compact $X$-ray binaries. Systems with higher-mass white dwarfs\nexperience unstable mass transfer, which leads to tidal disruption of the white\ndwarf. Our low critical mass compared to the standard jet-only model of mass\nloss arises from the efficient removal of angular momentum in the mechanical\ndisc winds which develop at highly super-Eddington mass-transfer rates. We find\nthat the eccentricities expected for WD-NS binaries when they come into contact\ndo not affect the loss of angular momentum, and can only affect the long-term\nevolution if they change on shorter timescales than the mass-transfer rate. Our\nresults are broadly consistent with the observed numbers of both ultra-compact\n$X$-ray binaries and radio pulsars with white dwarf companions. The observed\ncalcium-rich gap transients are consistent with the merger rate of unstable\nsystems with higher-mass white dwarfs.\n", "  We study the flocking and pattern formations of active particles with a\nVicsek-like model that includes a configuration dependent noise term. In\nparticular, we couple the strength of the noise with both the local density and\norientation of neighboring particles. Our results show that such a\nconfiguration dependent noise can lead to the appearance of large-scale ordered\nand disordered patterns, without the need for any complex alignment\ninteractions. In particular, we obtain an ordered band or line state and a\ndisordered active cluster, similar to that seen in the case of motility induced\nphase separation.\n", "  Critical analysis of the state of the art is a necessary task when\nidentifying new research lines worthwhile to pursue. To such an end, all the\navailable work related to the field of interest must be taken into account. The\nkey point is how to organize, analyze, and make sense of the huge amount of\nscientific literature available today on any topic. To tackle this problem, we\npresent here a bibliometric approach to Systematic Mapping Studies (SMS). Thus,\na modify SMS protocol is used relying on the scientific references metadata to\nextract, process and interpret the wealth of information contained in nowadays\nresearch literature. As a test case, the procedure is applied to determine the\ncurrent state and perspectives of community detection in complex networks. Our\nresults show that community detection is a still active, far from exhausted, in\ndevelopment, field. In addition, we find that, by far, the most exploited\nmethods are those related to determining hierarchical community structures. On\nthe other hand, the results show that fuzzy clustering techniques, despite\ntheir interest, are underdeveloped as well as the adaptation of existing\nalgorithms to parallel or, more specifically, distributed, computational\nsystems.\n", "  Creep in single crystal Nickel-based superalloys has been a topic of interest\nsince decades, and nowadays simulations are more and more able to complement\nexperiments. In these alloys, the $\\gamma/\\gamma'$ phase microstructure\nco-evolves with the system of dislocations under load, and understanding the\nmutual interactions is essential for understanding the resulting creep\nproperties. Predictive modeling thus requires multiphysics frameworks capable\nof modeling and simulating both the phase and defect microstructures. To do so,\nwe formulate a coupled model of phase-field evolution and continuum dislocation\ndynamics which adequately accounts for both statistically stored and\ngeometrically necessary dislocations. The simulated $\\gamma/\\gamma'$ phase\nmicrostructure with four $\\gamma'$ variants and co-evolving dislocation\nmicrostructure is found to be in good agreement with experimental observations.\nThe creep strain curve is obtained as a natural by-product of the\nmicrostructure evolution equations without the need for additional parameter\nfitting. We perform simulations of $\\gamma/\\gamma'$ evolution for different\ndislocation densities and establish the driving forces for microstructure\nevolution by analyzing in detail the changes in different contributions to the\nelastic and chemical energy density. Together with comparisons between\nsimulated and experimental creep curves this investigation reveals the\nmechanisms controlling the process of directional coarsening (rafting) and\ndemonstrates that the kinetics of rafting significantly depends on\ncharacteristics of the dislocation microstructure. In addition to rafting under\nconstant load, we investigate the effect of changes in loading conditions and\nexplore the possibility of improving creep properties by pre-rafting along a\ndifferent loading path.\n", "  Astronomers measure cosmic distances to objects beyond our own galaxy using\nstandard candles: objects of known intrinsic brightness, whose apparent\nbrightnesses in the sky are then taken as an indication of their distances from\nthe observer. In this activity, we use street lights and a digital camera to\nexplore the method of standard candles as well as some of its limitations and\npossible sources of error.\n", "  Material line defects are one-dimensional structures but the search and proof\nof electron behaviour consistent with the reduced dimension of such defects has\nbeen so far unsuccessful. Here we show using angle resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy that twin-grain boundaries in the layered semiconductor MoSe2\nexhibit parabolic metallic bands. The one-dimensional nature is evident from a\ncharge density wave transition, whose periodicity is given by kF/{\\pi},\nconsistent with scanning tunneling microscopy and angle resolved photoemission\nmeasurements. Most importantly, we provide evidence for spin- and\ncharge-separation, the hallmark of one-dimensional quantum liquids. Our studies\nshow that the spectral line splits into distinctive spinon and holon\nexcitations whose dispersions exactly follow the energy-momentum dependence\ncalculated by a Hubbard model with suitable finite-range interactions. Our\nresults also imply that quantum wires and junctions can be isolated in line\ndefects of other transition metal dichalcogenides, which may enable quantum\ntransport measurements and devices.\n", "  We present a preliminary comparison of the post-nova population with that of\ngeneral cataclysmic variables (CVs). We particularly focus on the mass-transfer\nrate and its potential relation to the nova eruption. We find that the known\npost-nova sample exclusively consists of high mass-transfer CVs, but that this\nis more likely to be due to the shorter recurrent time for those systems,\nrather than the mass-transfer rate being affected by the eruption.\nNevertheless, we find evidence for such an effect for specific post-novae, and\nthat it is potentially related to the binary separation and to presence or\nabsence of an accretion disc.\n", "  We have investigated energy levels mirror nuclei of the 17O and 17F in\nrelativistic and non-relativistic shell model. The nuclei 17O and 17F can be\nmodeled as a doubly-magic 17O=n+(N=Z=8) and 17F=p+(N=Z=8), with one additional\nnucleon (valence) in the ld5/2 level. Then we have selected the quadratic\nHellmann potential for interaction between core and single nucleon. Using\nParametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method, we have calculated the energy levels and\nwave function in Dirac and Schrodinger equations for relativistic and\nnon-relativistic, respectively. Finally, we have computed the binding and\nexcited energy levels for mirror nuclei of 17O and 17F and compare with other\nworks. Our results were in agreement with experimental values and hence this\nmodel could be applied for similar nuclei.\n", "  In this paper, we combine Lovelock gravity with gravity's rainbow to\nconstruct Lovelock gravity's rainbow. Considering the Lovelock gravity's\nrainbow coupled to linear and also nonlinear electromagnetic gauge fields, we\npresent two new classes of topological black hole solutions. We compute\nconserved and thermodynamic quantities of these black holes (such as\ntemperature, entropy, electric potential, charge and mass) and show that these\nquantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. In order to study the\nthermal stability in canonical ensemble, we calculate the heat capacity and\ndeterminant of the Hessian matrix and show in what regions there are thermally\nstable phases for black holes. Also, we discuss the dependence of thermodynamic\nbehavior and thermal stability of black holes on rainbow functions. Finally, we\ninvestigate the critical behavior of black holes in the extended phase space\nand study their interesting properties.\n", "  This note shows how to apply the James-Stein estimator to the case of\nentropic uncertainty relations of more than two observables. A better result is\nfound compared to applying the ordinary estimator and we find a more optimal\nmodel compared with experimental data. The theoretical bounds for entropic\nrelations for entropic relations for more than two observables are shown to be\nimproved.\n", "  We use tools from nonlinear dynamics to the detailed analysis of cold atom\nexperiments. A powerful example is provided by the recent concept of basin\nentropy which allows to quantify the final state unpredictability that results\nfrom the complexity of the phase space geometry. We show here that this enables\none to reliably infer the presence of fractal structures in phase space from\ndirect measurements. We illustrate the method with numerical simulations in an\nexperimental configuration made of two crossing laser guides that can be used\nas a matter wave splitter.\n", "  Background: The discovery of neutrinoless double-beta ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$)\ndecay would demonstrate the nature of neutrinos, have profound implications for\nour understanding of matter-antimatter mystery, and solve the mass hierarchy\nproblem of neutrinos. The calculations for the nuclear matrix elements\n$M^{0\\nu}$ of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay are crucial for the interpretation of this\nprocess. Purpose: We study the effects of relativity and nucleon-nucleon\nshort-range correlations on the nuclear matrix elements $M^{0\\nu}$ by assuming\nthe mechanism of exchanging light or heavy neutrinos for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\ndecay. Methods: The nuclear matrix elements $M^{0\\nu}$ are calculated within\nthe framework of covariant density functional theory, where the\nbeyond-mean-field correlations are included in the nuclear wave functions by\nconfiguration mixing of both angular-momentum and particle-number projected\nquadrupole deformed mean-field states. Results: The nuclear matrix elements\n$M^{0\\nu}$ are obtained for ten $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay candidate nuclei. The\nimpact of relativity is illustrated by adopting relativistic or nonrelativistic\ndecay operators. The effects of short-range correlations are evaluated.\nConclusions: The effects of relativity and short-range correlations play an\nimportant role in the mechanism of exchanging heavy neutrinos though the\ninfluences are marginal for light neutrinos. Combining the nuclear matrix\nelements $M^{0\\nu}$ with the observed lower limits on the\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay half-lives, the predicted strongest limits on the\neffective masses are $|\\langle m_\\nu\\rangle|<0.06~\\mathrm{eV}$ for light\nneutrinos and $|\\langle m_{\\nu_h}^{-1}\\rangle|^{-1}>3.065\\times\n10^8~\\mathrm{GeV}$ for heavy neutrinos.\n", "  In this short note, based on the talk given at the 3rd Conference of the\nPolish Society on Relativity, I present the basic points of our recent paper\n\"Symmetries of quantum spacetime in three dimensions\", stressing their physical\nmeaning, and avoiding technical details.\n", "  In present paper a new model of charged gravastar under f(T) modified gravity\nis obtained. The model has been explored by taking the diagonal tetrad field of\nstatic spacetime together with electric charge. To solve the Einstein-Maxwell\nfield equations, along with f(T) gravity, we assume the existence of a\nconformal Killing vector which relates between geometry and matter through the\nEinstein Maxwell field equations by an inheritance symmetry. We study several\ncases of interest to explore physically valid features of the solutions. Some\nphysical properties of the model are discussed and we match our interior\nspacetime to the exterior R-N exterior spacetime in presence of thin shell.\n", "  The connection between multifrequency quasar observational and physical\nparameters related to accretion processes is still open to debate. In the last\n20 year, Eigenvector 1-based approaches developed since the early papers by\nBoroson and Green (1992) and Sulentic et al. (2000b) have been proven to be a\nremarkably powerful tool to investigate this issue, and have led to the\ndefinition of a quasar \"main sequence\". In this paper we perform a cladistic\nanalysis on two samples of 215 and 85 low-z quasars (z 0.7) which were studied\nin several previous works and which offer a satisfactory coverage of the\nEigenvector 1-derived main sequence. The data encompass accurate measurements\nof observational parameters which represent key aspects associated with the\nstructural diversity of quasars. Cladistics is able to group sources radiating\nat higher Eddington ratios, as well as to separate radio-quiet (RQ) and\nradio-loud (RL) quasars. The analysis suggests a black hole mass threshold for\npowerful radio emission and also properly distinguishes core-dominated and\nlobe-dominated quasars, in accordance with the basic tenet of RL unification\nschemes. Considering that black hole mass provides a sort of \"arrow of time\" of\nnuclear activity, a phylogenetic interpretation becomes possible if cladistic\ntrees are rooted on black hole mass: the ontogeny of black holes is represented\nby their monotonic increase in mass. More massive radio-quiet Population B\nsources at low-z become a more evolved counterpart of Population A i.e., wind\ndominated sources to which the \"local\" Narrow-Line Seyfert 1s belong.\n", "  Continuing the development of the ZSM-Newton/Coulomb approach to\nsemiclassical Newtonian gravity/electrodynamics [1], we formulate a\nZSM-Newton/Coulomb version of the large N approximation scheme proposed by\nOriols et al. [2]. We show that this new large N scheme makes it possible to\nself-consistently describe the center-of-mass evolution of a large number of\ngravitationally/electrostatically interacting, identical, \\emph{zbw} particles,\nwithout assuming that the particles are weakly coupled, and without entailing\nthe problematic macroscopic semiclassical gravitational/electrostatic cat\nstates characteristic of the mean-field Schr{\\\"o}dinger-Newton/Coulomb\nequations. We also show how to recover N-particle classical Newtonian\ngravity/electrodynamics for many gravitationally/electrostatically interacting\nmacroscopic particles (composed of many interacting \\emph{zbw} particles), as\nwell as classical Vlasov-Poisson mean-field theory for macroscopic particles\nweakly interacting gravitationally/electrostatically. Finally, we outline an\nexplicit model of environmental decoherence that can be incorporated into\nOriols et al.'s scheme as applied to ZSM-Newton/Coulomb.\n", "  The present tutorial provides an overview of the time-dependent configuration\ninteraction singles (\\acs{TDCIS}) scheme applied to nonlinear ionization over a\nbroad photon-energy range. The efficient propagation of the wave function and\nthe calculation of photoelectron spectra within this approach are described and\ndemonstrated in various applications. Above-threshold ionization of argon and\nxenon in the extreme ultraviolet energy range is investigated as an example. A\nparticular focus is put on the xenon $4d$ giant dipole resonance and the\ninformation that nonlinear ionization can provide about resonance substructure.\nFurthermore, above-threshold ionization is studied in the x-ray regime and the\nintensity regime, at which multiphoton ionization starts to play a role at hard\nx-ray photon energies, is identified.\n", "  In the standard (LCDM) model of cosmology the universe has emerged out of an\nearly homogeneous and isotropic phase. Structure formation is associated with\nthe growth of density irregularities and peculiar velocities. Our Local Group\nis moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with a velocity\n631+/-20 km s-1 and participates in a bulk flow that extends out to distances\nof at least 20,000 km s-1. Since the discovery of the CMB dipole, the implicit\nassumption was that excesses in the abundance of galaxies induce the Local\nGroup motion. Yet, underdense regions push as much as overdensities attract but\nthey are deficient of light and consequently difficult to chart. It was\nsuggested a decade ago that an underdensity in the northern hemisphere roughly\n15,000 km s-1 away is a significant actor in the local flow. Here we report on\nkinematic evidence for such an underdensity. We map the large scale 3D velocity\nfield using a Wiener filter reconstruction from the Cosmicflows-2 dataset of\npeculiar velocities, and identify the attractors and repellers that dominate\nthe local dynamics. We show here that the local flow is dominated by a single\nattractor -associated with the Shapley Concentration- and a single previously\nunidentified repeller. Multipole expansion of the local flow provides further\nsupport for the existence and role played by the attractor and repeller. The\nbulk flow (i.e. dipole moment) is closely (anti)aligned with the repeller at a\ndistance of 16,000+/-4,500 km s-1. The expansion eigenvector of the shear\ntensor (quadrupole moment) is closely aligned with the Shapley Attractor out to\n7,000 km s-1. The close alignment of the local bulk flow with the repeller\nprovides further support for its dominant role in shaping the local flow. This\nDipole Repeller is predicted to be associated with a void in the distribution\nof galaxies.\n", "  We have performed a detailed investigation of the new `breathing' pyrochlore\ncompound LiInCr$_4$O$_8$ through Rh substitution with measurements of magnetic\nsusceptibility, specific heat, and x-ray powder diffraction. The\nantiferromagnetic phase of LiInCr$_4$O$_8$ is found to be slowly suppressed\nwith increasing Rh, up to the critical concentration of $x$ = 0.1 where the\nantiferromagnetic phase is still observed with the peak in specific heat $T_p$\n= 12.5 K, slightly lower than $T_p$ = 14.3 K for the $x$ = 0 compound. From the\nmeasurements of magnetization we also uncover evidence that substitution\nincreases the amount of frustration. Comparisons are made with the\nLiGa$_y$In$_{1-y}$Cr$_4$O$_8$ system as well as other frustrated\npyrochlore-related materials and find comparable amounts of frustration. The\nresults of this work shows that engineered breathing pyrochlores presents an\nimportant method to further understand the complex magnetism in frustrated\nsystems.\n", "  In human societies, people's willingness to compete and strive for better\nsocial status as well as being envious of those perceived in some way superior\nlead to social structures that are intrinsically hierarchical. Here we propose\nan agent-based, network model to mimic the ranking behaviour of individuals and\nits possible repercussions in human society. The main ingredient of the model\nis the assumption that the relevant feature of social interactions is each\nindividual's keenness to maximise his or her status relative to others. The\nsocial networks produced by the model are homophilous and assortative, as\nfrequently observed in human communities and most of the network properties\nseem quite independent of its size. However, it is seen that for small number\nof agents the resulting network consists of disjoint weakly connected\ncommunities while being highly assortative and homophilic. On the other hand\nlarger networks turn out to be more cohesive with larger communities but less\nhomophilic. We find that the reason for these changes is that larger network\nsize allows agents to use new strategies for maximizing their social status\nallowing for more diverse links between them.\n", "  We report on observation of a fine structure of microwave-induced resistance\noscillations in an ultraclean two-dimensional electron gas. This fine structure\nis manifested by multiple secondary sharp extrema, residing beside the primary\nones, which emerge at high radiation power. Theoretical considerations reveal\nthat this fine structure originates from multiphoton-assisted scattering off\nshort-range impurities. Unique properties of the fine structure allow us to\naccess all experimental parameters, including microwave power, and to separate\ndifferent contributions to photoresistance. Furthermore, we show that the fine\nstructure offers a convenient means to quantitatively assess the correlation\nproperties of the disorder potential in high-quality systems, allowing\nseparation of short- and long-range disorder contributions to the electron\nmobility.\n", "  We report on nonlinear magnetotransport in a two-dimensional electron gas\nhosted in a MgZnO/ZnO heterostructure. Upon application of a direct current, we\nobserve pronounced Hall field-induced resistance oscillations (HIRO) which are\nwell known from experiments on high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells. The\nunique sensitivity of HIRO to the short-range component of the disorder\npotential allows us to unambiguously establish that the mobility of our\nMgZnO/ZnO heterostructure is limited by impurities residing within or near the\n2D channel. Demonstration that HIRO can be realized in a system with a much\nlower mobility, much higher density, and much larger effective mass than in\npreviously studied systems, highlights remarkable universality of the\nphenomenon and its great promise to be used in studies of a wide variety of\nemerging 2D materials.\n", "  The mechanics of an oriented point (point with \"spin\") based on 3D and 4D\nFrenet equations is considered. In such mechanics there is an opportunity to\ndescribe formally any physical trajectory of a particle with own rotation. We\nuse anholonomic rotational coordinates (Euler angles) as elements of internal\nspace of the mechanics which generate a rotational relativity. The groups of\ntransformations of the mechanics of an oriented point form Poincare's group\nwith semidirect product of translations and rotations, so translational and\nrotational momentums appear dependent from each other. Connection of the curve\ntorsion with Ricci rotational coefficients is shown and rotational metric is\nentered. Equivalence between equations of motion 4D oriented point and geodesic\nequations of absolute parallelism geometry is established. The space of events\nan arbitrary accelerated 4D frame of reference, which has 10 degrees of\nfreedom, is described by Cartan structure equations of absolute parallelism\ngeometry. It represent 10D coordinate space in which 4 translational\ncoordinates describe motion of the origin $O$ 4D oriented point and 6 angular\ncoordinates describe change of its orientation. The structural equations of\nabsolute parallelism geometry, represent an extended set of Einstein-Yang-Mills\nequations with the gauge translations group defined on the base $x^i$ and with\nthe gauge rotational group, defined in the fibre. The sources in these\nequations are defined through the torsion (torsion field) of geometry. The\nreceived system of the equations represents generalization vacuum Einstein's\nequations on a case when sources have geometrical nature.\n"]}
