favoring dipole orientations parallel to the interface.\nIn water, in particular, this effect combines with generic orientational\npreferences induced by spatial asymmetry of water hydrogen bonding under\nconfined geometry, which may give rise to a Janus interface. The two effects\nmanifest themselves in considerable dependence of water polarization on both\nthe field direction relative to the interface, and the polarity (sign) of the\nfield. Using molecular simulations, we demonstrate strong field-induced\norientational forces acting on apolar surfaces through water mediation. At a\nfield strength comparable to electric fields around a DNA polyion, the torques\nwe predict to act on an adjacent nanoparticle are sufficient to overcome\nthermal fluctuations. These torques can align a particle with surface as small\nas 1 nm2. The mechanism can support electrically controlled ordering of\nsuspended nanoparticles as a means of tuning their properties, and can find\napplication in electro-nanomechanical devices.\n", "  The functional properties of many technological surfaces in biotechnology,\nelectronics, and mechanical engineering depend to a large degree on the\nindividual features of their nanoscale surface texture, which in turn are a\nfunction of the surface manufacturing process. Among these features, the\nsurface irregularities and self-similarity structures at different spatial\nscales, especially in the range of 1 to 100 nm, are of high importance because\nthey greatly affect the surface interaction forces acting at a nanoscale\ndistance. An analytical method for parameterizing the surface irregularities\nand their correlations in nanosurfaces imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM)\nis proposed. In this method, flicker noise spectroscopy - a statistical physics\napproach - is used to develop six nanometrological parameters characterizing\nthe high-frequency contributions of jump- and spike-like irregularities into\nthe surface texture. These contributions reflect the stochastic processes of\nanomalous diffusion and inertial effects, respectively, in the process of\nsurface manufacturing. The AFM images of the texture of corrosion-resistant\nmagnetite coatings formed on low-carbon steel in hot nitrate solutions with\ncoating growth promoters at different temperatures are analyzed. It is shown\nthat the parameters characterizing surface spikiness are able to quantify the\neffect of process temperature on the corrosion resistance of the coatings. It\nis suggested that these parameters can be used for predicting and\ncharacterizing the corrosion-resistant properties of magnetite coatings.\n", "  We consider the initial boundary value problem for the focusing nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation in the quarter plane $x>0,t>0$ in the case of decaying\ninitial data (for $t=0$, as $x\\to +\\infty$) and the Robin boundary condition at\n$x=0$. We revisit the approach based on the simultaneous spectral analysis of\nthe Lax pair equations [Fokas, 2002; Fokas, Its, Sung, 2005] and show that the\napproach can be implemented without any a priori assumptions on the long-time\nbehavior of the boundary values.\n", "  Interactions between colloidal particles have hitherto usually been fixed by\nthe suspension composition. Recent experimental developments now enable the\ncontrol of interactions \\emph{in-situ}. Here we use Brownian dynamics\nsimulations to investigate the effect of controlling interactions on gelation,\nby \"quenching\" the system from an equilibrium fluid to a gel. We find that,\ncontrary to the normal case of an instantaneous quench, where the local\nstructure of the gel is highly disordered, controlled quenching results in a\ngel with a higher degree of local order. Under sufficiently slow quenching,\nlocal crystallisation is found, which is strongly enhanced when a monodisperse\nsystem is used. The higher the degree of local order, the smaller the mean\nsquared displacement, indicating an enhancement of gel stability.\n", "  We derive an exact formula for the complex frequency in spatio-temporal\nstability analysis that is valid for arbitrary complex wave numbers. The\nusefulness of the formula lies in the fact that it depends only on purely\ntemporal quantities, which are easily calculated. We apply the formula to two\nmodel dispersion relations: the linearized complex Ginzburg--Landau equation,\nand a model of wake instability. In the first case, a quadratic truncation of\nthe exact formula applies; in the second, the same quadratic truncation yields\nan estimate of the parameter values at which the transition to absolute\ninstability occurs; the error in the estimate decreases upon increasing the\norder of the truncation. We outline ways in which the formula can be used to\ncharacterize stability results obtained from purely numerical calculations, and\npoint to a further application in global stability analyses.\n", "  We propose a superspace formulation of N=(1,0) conformal supergravity in six\ndimensions. The corresponding superspace constraints are invariant under\nsuper-Weyl transformations generated by a real scalar parameter. The known\nvariant Weyl super-multiplet is recovered by coupling the geometry to a\nsuper-3-form tensor multiplet. Isotwistor variables are introduced and used to\ndefine projective superfields. We formulate a locally supersymmetric and\nsuper-Weyl invariant action principle in projective superspace. Some families\nof dynamical supergravity-matter systems are presented.\n", "  When subjected to large amplitude oscillatory shear stress, aqueous Laponite\nsuspensions show an abrupt solidification transition after a long delay time\ntc. We measure the dependence of tc on stress amplitude, frequency, and on the\nage-dependent initial loss modulus. At first sight our observations appear\nquantitatively consistent with a simple soft-glassy rheology (SGR)-type model,\nin which barrier crossings by mesoscopic elements are purely strain-induced.\nFor a given strain amplitude {\\gamma}0 each element can be classified as fluid\nor solid according to whether its local yield strain exceeds {\\gamma}0. Each\ncycle, the barrier heights E of yielded elements are reassigned according to a\nfixed prior distribution {\\rho}(E): this fixes the per-cycle probability\nR({\\gamma}0) of a fluid elements becoming solid. As the fraction of solid\nelements builds up, {\\gamma}0 falls (at constant stress amplitude), so\nR({\\gamma}0) increases. This positive feedback accounts for the sudden\nsolidification after a long delay. The model thus appears to directly link\nmacroscopic rheology with mesoscopic barrier height statistics: within its\nprecepts, our data point towards a power law for {\\rho}(E) rather than the\nexponential form usually assumed in SGR. However, despite this apparent\nsuccess, closer investigation shows that the assumptions of the model cannot be\nreconciled with the extremely large strain amplitudes arising in our\nexperiments. The quantitative explanation of delayed solidification in Laponite\ntherefore remains an open theoretical challenge.\n", "  The adsorption behavior of ions at liquid-vapor interfaces exhibits several\nunexpected yet generic features. In particular, energy and entropy are both\nminimum when the solute resides near the surface, for a variety of ions in a\nrange of polar solvents, contrary to predictions of classical theories.\nMotivated by this generality, and by the simple physical ingredients implicated\nby computational studies, we have examined interfacial solvation in highly\nschematic models, which resolve only coarse fluctuations in solvent density and\ncohesive energy. Here we show that even such lattice gas models recapitulate\nsurprising thermodynamic trends observed in detailed simulations and\nexperiments. Attention is focused on the case of two dimensions, for which\napproximate energy and entropy profiles can be calculated analytically.\nSimulations and theoretical analysis of the lattice gas highlight the role of\ncapillary wave-like fluctuations in mediating adsorption. They further point to\nranges of temperature and solute-solvent interaction strength where surface\npropensity is expected to be strongest.\n", "  We propose a construction of Skyrme fields from holonomy of the spin\nconnection of gravitational instantons. The procedure is implemented for\nAtiyah-Hitchin and Taub-NUT instantons.\n  The skyrmion resulting from the Taub-NUT is given explicitly on the space of\norbits of a left translation inside the whole isometry group. The domain of the\nTaub-NUT skyrmion is a trivial circle bundle over the Poincare disc. The\nposition of the skyrmion depends on the Taub-NUT mass parameter, and its\ntopological charge is equal to two.\n", "  The PHENIX experiment has measured electrons and positrons at midrapidity\nfrom the decays of hadrons containing charm and bottom quarks produced in d+Au\nand p+p collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider, in the transverse-momentum range 0.85 < pT < 8.5 GeV/c. In central\nd+Au collisions, the nuclear modification factor R_dA at 1.5 < pT < 5 GeV/c\ndisplays evidence of enhancement of these electrons, relative to those produced\nin p+p collisions, and shows that the mass-dependent Cronin enhancement\nobserved at RHIC extends to the heavy-D-meson family. A comparison with the\nneutral-pion data suggests that the difference in cold-nuclear-matter effects\non light- and heavy-flavor mesons could contribute to the observed differences\nbetween the pi0 and heavy-flavor-electron nuclear modification factor R_AA.\n", "  The use of strong-field (i.e. intensities in excess of 10^13 Wcm-2) few-cycle\nultrafast (durations of 10 femtoseconds or less) laser pulses to create,\nmanipulate and image vibrational wavepackets is investigated. Quasi-classical\nmodelling of the initial superposition through tunnel ionization, wavepacket\nmodification by nonadiabatically altering the nuclear environment via the\ntransition dipole and the Stark effect, and measuring the control outcome by\nfragmenting the molecule is detailed. The influence of the laser intensity on\nstrong-field ultrafast wavepacket control is discussed in detail: by modifying\nthe distribution of laser intensities imaged, we show that focal conditions can\nbe created that give preference to this three-pulse technique above processes\ninduced by the pulses alone. An experimental demonstration is presented, and\nthe nuclear dynamics inferred by the quasi-classical model discussed. Finally,\nwe present the results of a systematic investigation of a dual-control pulse\nscheme, indicating that single vibrational states should be observable with\nhigh fidelity, and the populated state defined by varying the arrival time of\nthe two control pulses. The relevance of such strong-field coherent control\nmethods to the manipulation of electron localization and attosecond science is\ndiscussed.\n", "  The effect of initial state fluctuations on jet energy loss in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions is studied in a 2+1 dimension ideal hydrodynamic model.\nWithin the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD description of hard\nscatterings, we find that a jet loses slightly more energy in the expanding\nquark-gluon plasma if the latter is described by the hydrodynamic evolution\nwith fluctuating initial conditions compared to the case with smooth initial\nconditions. A detailed analysis indicates that this is mainly due to the\npositive correlation between the fluctuation in the production probability of\nparton jets from initial nucleon-nucleon hard collisions and the fluctuation in\nthe medium density along the path traversed by the jet. This effect is larger\nin non-central than in central relativistic heavy ion collisions and also for\njet energy loss that has a linear than a quadratic dependence on its path\nlength in the medium.\n", "  Several sources of direct photons are known to contribute to the total photon\nyield in high energy nuclear collisions. All of these photons carry\ncharacteristic and important information on the initial nuclei or the hot and\ndense fireball created in the collision. We investigate the possibility to\nseparate photons from back-scattering of high momentum quarks off quark gluon\nplasma from other sources. Their unique kinematics can be utilized through high\nenergy jet triggers on the away-side. We discuss the basic idea and estimate\nthe feasibility of such a measurement at RHIC and LHC.\n", "  The underlying mechanisms for one photon phase control are revealed through a\nmaster equation approach. Specifically, two mechanisms are identified, one\noperating on the laser time scale and the other on the time scale of the\nsystem-bath interaction. The effect of the secular and non-secular Markovian\napproximations are carefully examined.\n", "  How much does the curvature perturbation change after it leaves the horizon,\nand when should one evaluate the power spectrum? To answer these questions we\nstudy single field inflation models numerically, and compare the evolution of\ndifferent curvature perturbations from horizon crossing to the end of\ninflation. We find that e.g. in chaotic inflation, the amplitude of the\ncomoving and the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces differ\nby up to 180 \\% at horizon crossing assuming the same amplitude at the end of\ninflation, and that it takes approximately 3 efolds for the curvature\nperturbation to be within 1 \\% of its value at the end of inflation.\n", "  The hot-electron attenuation length in Ni is measured as a function of energy\nacross two different Schottky interfaces viz. a polycrystalline Si(111)/Au and\nan epitaxial Si(111)/NiSi_2 interface using ballistic electron emission\nmicroscopy (BEEM). For similarly prepared Si(111) substrates and identical Ni\nthickness, the BEEM transmission is found to be lower for the polycrystalline\ninterface than for the epitaxial interface. However, in both cases, the\nhot-electron attenuation length in Ni is found to be the same. This is\nelucidated by the temperature-independent inelastic scattering, transmission\nprobabilities across the Schottky interface, and scattering at dissimilar\ninterfaces.\n", "  Hot electron transport of direct and scattered carriers across an epitaxial\nNiSi_2/n-Si(111) interface, for different NiSi_2 thickness, is studied using\nBallistic Electron Emission Microscopy (BEEM). We find the BEEM transmission\nfor the scattered hot electrons in NiSi_2 to be significantly lower than that\nfor the direct hot electrons, for all thicknesses. Interestingly, the\nattenuation length of the scattered hot electrons is found to be twice larger\nthan that of the direct hot electrons. The lower BEEM transmission for the\nscattered hot electrons is due to inelastic scattering of the injected hot\nholes while the larger attenuation length of the scattered hot electrons is a\nconsequence of the differences in the energy distribution of the injected and\nscattered hot electrons and the increasing attenuation length, at lower\nenergies, of the direct hot electrons in NiSi_2.\n", "  Unusual features in the bias dependence of spin transport are observed in a\nCo/Au/NiFe spin valve fabricated on a highly textured Cu(100)/Si(100) Schottky\ninterface, exploiting the local probing capabilities of a Ballistic electron\nmagnetic microscope (BEMM). This arises due to local differences in the strain\nand the presence of misfit dislocations at the Schottky interface that enhances\nspin flip scattering and broadens the energy and angular distribution of the\ntransmitted electrons. Cumulatively, these enable the transmitted hot electrons\nto probe the different conduction band minima in Si, giving rise to such bias\ndependent features in the magnetocurrent. This study reveals new insights into\nthe spin dependence of transmission in an indirect band gap semiconductor as Si\nand highlights the unique capabilities of BEMM in probing local differences in\nspin transport across such textured interfaces.\n", "  Measuring local temperature with a spatial resolution on the order of a few\nnanometers has a wide range of applications from semiconductor industry over\nmaterial to life sciences. When combined with precision temperature measurement\nit promises to give excess to small temperature changes caused e.g. by chemical\nreactions or biochemical processes. However, nanoscale temperature measurements\nand precision have excluded each other so far owing to the physical processes\nused for temperature measurement of limited stability of nanoscale probes. Here\nwe experimentally demonstrate a novel nanoscale temperature sensing technique\nbased on single atomic defects in diamonds. Sensor sizes range from millimeter\ndown to a few tens of nanometers. Utilizing the sensitivity of the optically\naccessible electron spin level structure to temperature changes we achieve a\ntemperature noise floor of 5 mK Hz$^{-1/2}$ for single defects in bulk sensors.\nUsing doped nanodiamonds as sensors yields temperature measurement with 130 mK\nHz$^{-1/2}$ noise floor and accuracies down to 1 mK at length scales of a few\nten nanometers. The high sensitivity to temperature changes together with\nexcellent spatial resolution combined with outstanding sensor stability allows\nfor nanoscale precision temperature determination enough to measure chemical\nprocesses of few or single molecules by their reaction heat even in\nheterogeneous environments like cells.\n", "  The low frequency vibrational spectra of hydrated porous silica are\nspecifically sensitive to the hydrogen bond interactions and provides a wealth\nof information on the structural and dynamical properties of the water\ncontained in the pores of the matrix. We investigate systematically this\nspectral region of Vycor porous silica (pore size about 4 nm) for a series of\nsamples at different levels of hydration, from the dry matrix to completely\nfilled pores. The spectra are obtained as the Fourier transforms of\ntime-resolved heterodyne detected optical Kerr effect (HD- OKE) measurements.\nThe comparison of these spectra with that of bulk water allows us to extract\nand analyze separately the spectral contributions of the first and second\nhydration layers, as well as that of bulk-like inner water. We conclude that\nthe extra water entering the pores above 10 % water/silica weight ratio behaves\nvery similarly to bulk water. At lower levels of hydration, corresponding to\ntwo complete superficial water layers or less, the H-bond bending and\nstretching bands, characteristic of the tetrahedral coordination of water in\nthe bulk phase, progressively disappear: clearly in these conditions the H-bond\nconnectivity is very different from that of liquid water. A similar behavior is\nobserved for the structural relaxation times, measured from the decay of the\ntime-dependent HD-OKE signal. The value for the inner water is very similar to\nthat of the bulk liquid; that of the first two water layers is definitely\nlonger by about a factor 4. These findings should be carefully taken into\naccount when employing pore confinement to extend towards lower temperatures\nthe accessible temperature range of supercooled water.\n", "  Recently, the triple-\\alpha (3\\alpha) process, by which three 4He nuclei are\nfused into a 12C nucleus in stars, was studied by different methods in solving\nthe quantum mechanical three-body problem. Their results of the thermonuclear\nreaction rate for the process differ by several orders at low stellar\ntemperatures of 10^7 - 10^8 K. In this paper, we will present calculations of\nthe 3\\alpha process by a modified Faddeev three-body formalism in which the\nlong-range effects of Coulomb interactions are accommodated. The reaction rate\nof the process is calculated via an inverse process, three-alpha (3-\\alpha)\nphotodisintegration of a 12C nucleus. Calculated reaction rate is about 10\ntimes larger than that of the Nuclear Astrophysics Compilation of Reaction\nRates (NACRE) at 10^7 K, and is remarkably smaller than the results of the\nrecent three-body calculations. We will discuss a possible reason of the\ndifference.\n", "  Water famously expands upon freezing, foreshadowed by a negative coefficient\nof expansion of the liquid at temperatures close to its freezing temperature.\nThese behaviors, and many others, reflect the energetic preference for local\ntetrahedral arrangements of water molecules and entropic effects that oppose\nit. Here, we provide theoretical analysis of mesoscopic implications of this\ncompetition, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium, including mediation by\ninterfaces. With general scaling arguments bolstered by simulation results, and\nwith reduced units that elucidate corresponding states, we derive a phase\ndiagram for bulk and confined water and water-like materials. For water itself,\nthe corresponding states cover the temperature range of 150 K to 300 K and the\npressure range of 1 bar to 2 kbar. In this regime, there are two reversible\ncondensed phases - ice and liquid. Out of equilibrium, there is irreversible\npolyamorphism, i.e., more than one glass phase, reflecting dynamical arrest of\ncoarsening ice. Temperature-time plots are derived to characterize time scales\nof the different phases and explain contrasting dynamical behaviors of\ndifferent water-like systems.\n", "  We study a mesoscopic model for the flow of amorphous solids. The model is\nbased on the key features identified at the microscopic level, namely peri- ods\nof elastic deformation interspersed with localised rearrangements of parti-\ncles that induce long-range elastic deformation. These long-range deformations\nare derived following a continuum mechanics approach, in the presence of solid\nboundaries, and are included in full in the model. Indeed, they mediate spatial\ncooperativity in the flow, whereby a localised rearrangement may lead a distant\nregion to yield. In particular, we simulate a channel flow and find\nmanifestations of spatial cooperativity that are consistent with published\nexperimental obser- vations for concentrated emulsions in microchannels. Two\ncategories of effects are distinguished. On the one hand, the coupling of\nregions subject to different shear rates, for instance,leads to finite shear\nrate fluctuations in the seemingly un- sheared \"plug\" in the centre of the\nchannel. On the other hand, there is convinc- ing experimental evidence of a\nspecific rheology near rough walls. We discuss diverse possible physical\norigins for this effect, and we suggest that it may be associated with the\nbumps of particles into surface asperities as they slide along the wall.\n", "  We use a newly-developed method to identify local structural motifs in a\npopular model glassformer, the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture. By\nmeasuring the lifetimes of a zoo of clusters, we find that 11-membered bicapped\nsquare antiprisms, denoted as 11A, have longer lifetimes on average than other\nstructures considered. Other long-lived clusters are similar in structure to\nthe 11A cluster. These clusters group into ramified networks that are\ncorrelated with slow particles and act to retard the motion of neighbouring\nparticles. The structural lengthscale associated with these networks does not\ngrow as fast as the dynamical lengthscale $\\xi_4$ as the system is cooled, in\nthe range of temperatures our molecular dynamics simulations access. Thus we\nfind a strong, but indirect, correlation between static structural ordering and\nslow dynamics.\n", "  In this paper we study the electrostatic interaction of a heterogeneously\ncharged wall with a neutral semipermeable membrane. The wall consists of\nperiodic stripes, where the charge density varies in one direction. The\nmembrane is in a contact with a bulk reservoir of an electrolyte solution and\nseparated from the wall by a thin film of salt-free liquid. One type of ions\n(small counterions) permeates into the gap and gives rise to a\ndistance-dependent membrane potential, which translates into a repulsive\nelectrostatic disjoining pressure due to an overlap of counterion clouds in the\ngap. To quantify it we use two complementary approaches. First, we propose a\nmean-field theory based on a linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation and Fourier\nanalysis. These calculations allow us to estimate the effect of a heterogeneous\ncharge pattern at the wall on the induced heterogeneous membrane potential, and\nthe value of the disjoining pressure as a function of the gap. Second, we\nperform Langevin dynamics simulations of the same system with explicit ions.\nThe results of the two approaches are in good agreement with each other at low\nsurface charge and small gap, but differ due to nonlinearity at the higher\ncharge. These results demonstrate that a heterogeneity of the wall charge can\nlead to a huge reduction in the electrostatic repulsion, which could\ndramatically facilitate a self-assembly in complex synthetic and biological\nsystems.\n", "  We calculate the quantum Cram\\'er--Rao bound for the sensitivity with which\none or several parameters, encoded in a general single-mode Gaussian state, can\nbe estimated. This includes in particular the interesting case of mixed\nGaussian states. We apply the formula to the problems of estimating phase,\npurity, loss, amplitude, and squeezing. In the case of the simultaneous\nmeasurement of several parameters, we provide the full quantum Fisher\ninformation matrix. Our results unify previously known partial results, and\nconstitute a complete solution to the problem of knowing the best possible\nsensitivity of measurements based on a single-mode Gaussian state.\n", "  We discuss the effects of a direct coupling between a rank-two antisymmetric\ntensor field and the Maxwell field. The coupling we consider leads to vacuum\nbirefringence, allowing us to place constraints on the magnitude of the tensor\nfield and the strength of its coupling to the Maxwell field via cosmological\nbirefringence measurements. For light propagating in the presence of a\ntopological defect solution, we find that light rays with different\npolarizations will follow different trajectories; the magnitude of this\ndeflection is predicted to be extremely small (on the order of 10^-10\narcseconds). We discuss the plausibility of this phenomenon as a method for\ndetection of these monopoles, along with the applicability of our methods to\nother possible couplings between the tensor field and the Maxwell field.\n", "  Neuronal dynamics are fundamentally constrained by the underlying structural\nnetwork architecture, yet much of the details of this synaptic connectivity are\nstill unknown even in neuronal cultures in vitro. Here we extend a previous\napproach based on information theory, the Generalized Transfer Entropy, to the\nreconstruction of connectivity of simulated neuronal networks of both\nexcitatory and inhibitory neurons. We show that, due to the model-free nature\nof the developed measure, both kinds of connections can be reliably inferred if\nthe average firing rate between synchronous burst events exceeds a small\nminimum frequency. Furthermore, we suggest, based on systematic simulations,\nthat even lower spontaneous inter- burst rates could be raised to meet the\nrequirements of our reconstruction algorithm by applying a weak spatially\nhomogeneous stimulation to the entire network. By combining multiple recordings\nof the same in silico network before and after pharmacologically blocking\ninhibitory synaptic transmission, we show then how it becomes possible to infer\nwith high confidence the excitatory or inhibitory nature of each individual\nneuron.\n", "  I propose to resolve the controversy over the speed of collapse of\nquantum-mechanical wavefunctions by means of an experimental test with a\nmodified symmetric Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer, with non-intersecting,\nparallel, widely separated final beams. According to the conventional collapse\nscenario, the coherent twin-peak atomic wavefunction in the beams of the\ninterferometer suffers an instantaneous collapse, at infinite speed, when the\natom is captured by one of the two detectors at the ends of the beams, but it\nremains coherent until that instant. In contrast, according to the\nHellwig-Kraus relativistic collapse scenario, the wavefunction collapses at the\nspeed of light, backward in time along the past light cone of each detector.\nThis leads to a premature collapse, or pre-collapse, which for a beam-to-beam\nseparation of 3 m extends over a time span of 10 ns before arrival at the\ndetectors. Within this time span the paired wavepackets in the two beams will\nbe incoherent. The difference between the coherent wavepackets of the\nconventional scenario and the incoherent wavepackets of the relativistic\nscenario can be tested by probing the atomic beams with a transverse laser beam\ncrossing them near the detectors. If the paired atomic wavepackets in the two\nbeams are coherent, the light scattered by the two beams will also be coherent\nand generate a standing light wave in the space between the beams, with\ndetectable interference fringes. If the paired wavepackets are incoherent, no\nsuch interference fringes will be generated, and the distribution of the\nscattered light will be that of two independent dipoles. The design parameters\nfor this test seem to lie within reach of the techniques of atom\ninterferometry.\n", "  Chirped-Pulse millimetre-Wave (CPmmW) rotational spectroscopy provides a new\nclass of information about photolysis transition state(s). Measured intensities\nin rotational spectra determine species-isomer-vibrational populations,\nprovided that rotational populations can be thermalized. The formation and\ndetection of S0 vinylidene is discussed in the limits of low and high initial\nrotational excitation. CPmmW spectra of 193 nm photolysis of Vinyl Cyanide\n(Acrylonitrile) contain J=0-1 transitions in more than 20 vibrational levels of\nHCN, HNC, but no transitions in vinylidene or highly excited local-bender\nvibrational levels of acetylene. Reasons for the non-observation of the\nvinylidene co-product of HCN are discussed.\n", "  In this work, we establish a connection between the extended Prelle-Singer\nprocedure (Chandrasekar \\textit{et al.} Proc. R. Soc. A 2005) with five other\nanalytical methods which are widely used to identify integrable systems in the\ncontemporary literature, especially for second order nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs). By synthesizing these methods we bring out the\ninterplay between Lie point symmetries, $\\lambda$-symmetries, adjoint\nsymmetries, null-forms, Darboux polynomials, integrating factors and Jacobi\nlast multiplier in identifying the integrable systems described by second order\nODEs. We also give new perspectives to the extended Prelle-Singer procedure\ndeveloped by us. We illustrate these subtle connections with modified Emden\nequation as a suitable example.\n", "  With globalization, countries are more connected than before by trading\nflows, which currently amount to at least 36 trillion dollars. Interestingly,\napproximately 30-60 percent of global exports consist of intermediate products.\nTherefore, the trade flow network of a particular product with high added\nvalues can be regarded as a value chain. The problem is weather we can\ndiscriminate between these products based on their unique flow network\nstructure. This paper applies the flow analysis method developed in ecology to\n638 trading flow networks of different products. We claim that the allometric\nscaling exponent $\\eta$ can be used to characterize the degree of\nhierarchicality of a flow network, i.e., whether the trading products flow on\nlong hierarchical chains. Then, the flow networks of products with higher added\nvalues and complexity, such as machinery&transport equipment with larger\nexponents, are highlighted. These higher values indicate that their trade flow\nnetworks are more hierarchical. As a result, without extra data such as global\ninput-output table, we can identify the product categories with higher\ncomplexity and the relative importance of a country in the global value chain\nsolely by the trading network.\n", "  We use ZENS data at low redshift to study the dependence of the quenched\nsatellite fraction and of the morphological mix of these quenched satellites,\non three different environmental parameters: group halo mass, halo-centric\ndistance and large-scale structure over-density. The fraction of quenched\nsatellites is independent of halo mass and the surrounding large-scale\noverdensity, but increases towards the centres of the haloes, as previously\nfound. The morphological mix is, however, constant with radial position,\nindicating that the well-known morphology-density relation results from the\nincreasing fraction of quenched galaxies towards the centres of haloes. The\nconstancy of the morphological outcome suggests that mass-quenching and\nsatellite quenching have the same effect on the morphologies of the galaxies.\nThe quenched satellites have larger B/T and smaller half-light radii than the\nstar-forming satellites. These are mostly due to differences in the disks. The\nbulges in quenched satellites have very similar luminosities and surface\nbrightness profiles, and any mass growth of the bulges associated with\nquenching cannot greatly change these quantities. The quenched disks are\nfainter and have smaller scale lengths than in star-forming satellites. This\ncan be explained either by a differential fading of the disks or if disks were\ngenerally smaller in the past, both of which are expected in an inside-out\ngrowth of disks. At least at low redshifts, the structure of massive quenched\nsatellites is produced by processes that operate before quenching takes place.\nA comparison with semi-analytic models argues for a reduction in the efficiency\nof group halos in quenching their disk satellites and for mechanisms to\nincrease the B/T of low mass quenched satellites. [abridged]\n", "  We construct a gauge theory on a noncommutative homogeneous K\\\"ahler\nmanifold, where we employ the deformation quantization with separation of\nvariables for K\\\"ahler manifolds formulated by Karabegov. A key point in this\nconstruction is to obtaining vector fields which act as inner derivations for\nthe deformation quantization. We show that these vector fields are the only\nKilling vector fields. We give an explicit construction of this gauge theory on\nnoncommutative ${\\mathbb C}P^N$ and noncommutative ${\\mathbb C}H^N$.\n", "  The interstellar medium is known to be chemically complex. Organic molecules\nwith up to 11 atoms have been detected in the interstellar medium, and are\nbelieved to be formed on the ices around dust grains. The ices can be released\ninto the gas-phase either through thermal desorption, when a newly formed star\nheats the medium around it and completely evaporates the ices; or through\nnon-thermal desorption mechanisms, such as photodesorption, when a single\nfar-UV photon releases only a few molecules from the ices. The first one\ndominates in hot cores, hot corinos and strongly UV-illuminated PDRs, while the\nsecond one dominates in colder regions, such as low UV-field PDRs. This is the\ncase of the Horsehead were dust temperatures are ~20-30K, and therefore offers\na clean environment to investigate what is the role of photodesorption. We have\ncarried-out an unbiased spectral line survey at 3, 2 and 1mm with the IRAM-30m\ntelescope in the Horsehead nebula, with an unprecedented combination of\nbandwidth high spectral resolution and sensitivity. Two positions were\nobserved: the warm PDR and a cold condensation shielded from the UV field\n(dense core), located just behind the PDR edge. We summarize our recently\npublished results from this survey and present the first detection of the\ncomplex organic molecules HCOOH, CH2CO, CH3CHO and CH3CCH in a PDR. These\nspecies together with CH3CN present enhanced abundances in the PDR compared to\nthe dense core. This suggests that photodesorption is an efficient mechanism to\nrelease complex molecules into the gas-phase in far-UV illuminated regions.\n", "  We show that the Higgs portal interactions involving extra dark Higgs field\ncan save generically the original Higgs inflation of the standard model (SM)\nfrom the problem of a deep non-SM vacuum in the SM Higgs potential.\nSpecifically, we show that such interactions disconnect the top quark pole mass\nfrom inflationary observables and allow multi-dimensional parameter space to\nsave the Higgs inflation, thanks to the additional parameters (the dark Higgs\nboson mass $m_{\\phi}$, the mixing angle $\\alpha$ between the SM Higgs $H$ and\ndark Higgs $\\Phi$, and the mixed quartic coupling) affecting RG-running of the\nHiggs quartic coupling. The effect of Higgs portal interactions may lead to a\nlarger tensor-to-scalar ratio, $0.08 \\lesssim r \\lesssim 0.1$, by adjusting\nrelevant parameters in wide ranges of $\\alpha$ and $m_{\\phi}$, some region of\nwhich can be probed at future colliders. Performing a numerical analysis we\nfind an allowed region of parameters, matching the latest Planck data.\n", "  A highly unconventional superconducting state with a spin-singlet\n$d_{x^2-y^2}\\pm id_{xy}$-wave, or chiral d-wave, symmetry has recently been\nproposed to emerge from electron-electron interactions in doped graphene.\nEspecially graphene doped to the van Hove singularity at 1/4 doping, where the\ndensity of states diverges, has been argued to likely be a chiral d-wave\nsuperconductor. In this review we summarize the currently mounting theoretical\nevidence for the existence of a chiral d-wave superconducting state in\ngraphene, obtained with methods ranging from mean-field studies of effective\nHamiltonians to angle-resolved renormalization group calculations. We further\ndiscuss multiple distinctive properties of the chiral d-wave superconducting\nstate in graphene, as well as its stability in the presence of disorder. We\nalso review means of enhancing the chiral d-wave state using proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity. The appearance of chiral d-wave superconductivity is\nintimately linked to the hexagonal crystal lattice and we also offer a brief\noverview of other materials which have also been proposed to be chiral d-wave\nsuperconductors.\n", "  The present investigation discusses the flow and heat transfer\ncharacteristics of a steady three dimensional Sisko fluid. The flow is induced\ndue to bidirectional stretching sheet. The influence of power-law index and\nstretching ratio on flow and heat transfer is studied thoroughly. Governing\npartial differential equations are reduced to coupled ordinary differential\nequations by suitable similarity variable. The resulting equations are then\nsolved numerically by shooting method using adaptive Runge Kutta algorithm in\ncombination with Broyden's method in the domain . The numerical results for the\nvelocity and temperature fields are graphically presented and effects of the\nrelevant parameters are discussed in detail. Moreover, the skin-friction\ncoefficient and local Nusselt number for different values of the power-law\nindex and stretching ratio are presented through tabulated data. The numerical\nresults are verified with the results obtained by HAM. Additionally, the\nresults are also validated with previously published pertinent literature as a\nspecial case of the problem.\n", "  Complex networks underlie an enormous variety of social, biological,\nphysical, and virtual systems. A profound complication for the science of\ncomplex networks is that in most cases, observing all nodes and all network\ninteractions is impossible. Previous work addressing the impacts of partial\nnetwork data is surprisingly limited, focuses primarily on missing nodes, and\nsuggests that network statistics derived from subsampled data are not suitable\nestimators for the same network statistics describing the overall network\ntopology. We generate scaling methods to predict true network statistics,\nincluding the degree distribution, from only partial knowledge of nodes, links,\nor weights. Our methods are transparent and do not assume a known generating\nprocess for the network, thus enabling prediction of network statistics for a\nwide variety of applications. We validate analytical results on four simulated\nnetwork classes and empirical data sets of various sizes. We perform\nsubsampling experiments by varying proportions of sampled data and demonstrate\nthat our scaling methods can provide very good estimates of true network\nstatistics while acknowledging limits. Lastly, we apply our techniques to a set\nof rich and evolving large-scale social networks, Twitter reply networks. Based\non 100 million tweets, we use our scaling techniques to propose a statistical\ncharacterization of the Twitter Interactome from September 2008 to November\n2008. Our treatment allows us to find support for Dunbar's hypothesis in\ndetecting an upper threshold for the number of active social contacts that\nindividuals maintain over the course of one week.\n", "  We propose a semantic representation of the standard quantum logic QL within\na classical, normal modal logic, and this via a lattice-embedding of\northomodular lattices into Boolean algebras with one modal operator. Thus our\nclassical logic is a completion of the quantum logic QL. In other words, we\nrefute Birkhoff and von Neumann's classic thesis that the logic (the formal\ncharacter) of Quantum Mechanics would be non-classical as well as Putnam's\nthesis that quantum logic (of his kind) would be the correct logic for\npropositional inference in general. The propositional logic of Quantum\nMechanics is modal but classical, and the correct logic for propositional\ninference need not have an extroverted quantum character. One normal necessity\nmodality suffices to capture the subjectivity of observation in quantum\nexperiments, and this thanks to its failure to distribute over classical\ndisjunction. The key to our result is the translation of quantum negation as\nclassical negation of observability.\n", "  We investigate the extent to which advances in the health and life sciences\n(HLS) are dependent on research in the engineering and physical sciences (EPS),\nparticularly physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering. The analysis\ncombines two different bibliometric approaches. The first approach to analyze\nthe 'EPS-HLS interface' is based on term map visualizations of HLS research\nfields. We consider 16 clinical fields and five life science fields. On the\nbasis of expert judgment, EPS research in these fields is studied by\nidentifying EPS-related terms in the term maps. In the second approach, a\nlarge-scale citation-based network analysis is applied to publications from all\nfields of science. We work with about 22,000 clusters of publications, each\nrepresenting a topic in the scientific literature. Citation relations are used\nto identify topics at the EPS-HLS interface. The two approaches complement each\nother. The advantages of working with textual data compensate for the\nlimitations of working with citation relations and the other way around. An\nimportant advantage of working with textual data is in the in-depth qualitative\ninsights it provides. Working with citation relations, on the other hand,\nyields many relevant quantitative statistics. We find that EPS research\ncontributes to HLS developments mainly in the following five ways: new\nmaterials and their properties; chemical methods for analysis and molecular\nsynthesis; imaging of parts of the body as well as of biomaterial surfaces;\nmedical engineering mainly related to imaging, radiation therapy, signal\nprocessing technology, and other medical instrumentation; mathematical and\nstatistical methods for data analysis. In our analysis, about 10% of all EPS\nand HLS publications are classified as being at the EPS-HLS interface. This\npercentage has remained more or less constant during the past decade.\n", "  In 2011, hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) was observed for the first time outside the\nsolar system (Bergman et al., A&A, 2011, 531, L8). This detection appeared a\nposteriori quite natural, as HOOH is an intermediate product in the formation\nof water on the surface of dust grains. Following up on this detection, we\npresent a search for HOOH in a diverse sample of sources in different\nenvironments, including low-mass protostars and regions with very high column\ndensities, such as Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs). We do not detect the molecule\nin any other source than Oph A, and derive 3$\\sigma$ upper limits for the\nabundance of HOOH relative to H$_2$ lower than in Oph A for most sources. This\nresult sheds a different light on our understanding of the detection of HOOH in\nOph A, and shifts the puzzle to why this source seems to be special. Therefore\nwe rediscuss the detection of HOOH in Oph A, as well as the implications of the\nlow abundance of HOOH, and its similarity with the case of O$_2$. Our chemical\nmodels show that the production of HOOH is extremely sensitive to the\ntemperature, and favored only in the range 20$-$30 K. The relatively high\nabundance of HOOH observed in Oph A suggests that the bulk of the material lies\nat a temperature in the range 20$-$30 K.\n", "  In this paper, we present a new method to generate an instantaneous\nvolumetric image using a single x-ray projection. To fully extract motion\ninformation hidden in projection images, we partitioned a projection image into\nsmall patches. We utilized a sparse learning method to automatically select\npatches that have a high correlation with principal component analysis (PCA)\ncoefficients of a lung motion model. A model that maps the patch intensity to\nthe PCA coefficients is built along with the patch selection process. Based on\nthis model, a measured projection can be used to predict the PCA coefficients,\nwhich are further used to generate a motion vector field and hence a volumetric\nimage. We have also proposed an intensity baseline correction method based on\nthe partitioned projection, where the first and the second moments of pixel\nintensities at a patch in a simulated image are matched with those in a\nmeasured image via a linear transformation. The proposed method has been valid\nin simulated data and real phantom data. The algorithm is able to identify\npatches that contain relevant motion information, e.g. diaphragm region. It is\nfound that intensity correction step is important to remove the systematic\nerror in the motion prediction. For the simulation case, the sparse learning\nmodel reduced prediction error for the first PCA coefficient to 5%, compared to\nthe 10% error when sparse learning is not used. 95th percentile error for the\npredicted motion vector is reduced from 2.40 mm to 0.92mm. In the phantom case,\nthe predicted tumor motion trajectory is successfully reconstructed with 0.82\nmm mean vector field error compared to 1.66 mm error without using the sparse\nlearning method. The algorithm robustness with respect to sparse level, patch\nsize, and existence of diaphragm, as well as computation time, has also been\nstudied.\n", "  In this paper we consider tachyonic matter in spatially at FRW universe, and\nobtain behavior of some important cosmological parameters for two special cases\nof potentials. First we assume the exponential potential and then consider\nhyperbolic cosine type potential. In both cases we obtain behavior of the\nHubble, deceleration and EoS parameters. Comparison with observational data\nsuggest the model with hyperbolic cosine type scalar-field potentials has good\nmodel to describe universe.\n", "  The ab initio $GW$ method is considered as the most accurate approach for\ncalculating the band gaps of semiconductors and insulators. Yet its application\nto transition metal oxides (TMOs) has been hindered by the failure of\ntraditional approximations developed for conventional semiconductors. In this\nwork, we examine the effects of these approximations on the values of band gaps\nfor ZnO, Cu$_2$O, and TiO$_2$. In particular, we explore the origin of the\ndifferences between the two widely used plasmon-pole models. Based on the\ncomparison of our results with the experimental data and previously published\ncalculations, we discuss which approximations are suitable for TMOs and why.\n", "  We present an analysis of the credit market of Japan. The analysis is\nperformed by investigating the bipartite network of banks and firms which is\nobtained by setting a link between a bank and a firm when a credit relationship\nis present in a given time window. In our investigation we focus on a community\ndetection algorithm which is identifying communities composed by both banks and\nfirms. We show that the clusters obtained by directly working on the bipartite\nnetwork carry information about the networked nature of the Japanese credit\nmarket. Our analysis is performed for each calendar year during the time period\nfrom 1980 to 2011. Specifically, we obtain communities of banks and networks\nfor each of the 32 investigated years, and we introduce a method to track the\ntime evolution of these communities on a statistical basis. We then\ncharacterize communities by detecting the simultaneous over-expression of\nattributes of firms and banks. Specifically, we consider as attributes the\neconomic sector and the geographical location of firms and the type of banks.\nIn our 32 year long analysis we detect a persistence of the over-expression of\nattributes of clusters of banks and firms together with a slow dynamics of\nchanges from some specific attributes to new ones. Our empirical observations\nshow that the credit market in Japan is a networked market where the type of\nbanks, geographical location of firms and banks and economic sector of the firm\nplay a role in shaping the credit relationships between banks and firms.\n", "  The problem of finding the $k$ most critical nodes, referred to as the\n$top\\text{-}k$ problem, is a very important one in several contexts such as\ninformation diffusion and preference aggregation in social networks, clustering\nof data points, etc. It has been observed in the literature that the value\nallotted to a node by most of the popular cooperative game theoretic solution\nconcepts, acts as a good measure of appropriateness of that node (or a data\npoint) to be included in the $top\\text{-}k$ set, by itself. However, in\ngeneral, nodes having the highest $k$ values are not the desirable\n$top\\text{-}k$ nodes, because the appropriateness of a node to be a part of the\n$top\\text{-}k$ set depends on other nodes in the set. As this is not explicitly\ncaptured by cooperative game theoretic solution concepts, it is necessary to\npost-process the obtained values in order to output the suitable $top\\text{-}k$\nnodes. In this paper, we propose several such post-processing methods and give\nreasoning behind each of them, and also propose a standalone algorithm that\ncombines cooperative game theoretic solution concepts with the popular greedy\nhill-climbing algorithm.\n", "  Recent studies of animal social networks have significantly increased our\nunderstanding of animal behavior, social interactions, and many important\necological and epidemiological processes. However, most of the studies are at\nlow temporal and spatial resolution due to the difficulty in recording accurate\ncontact information. Domestic animals such as cattle have social behavior and\nserve as an excellent study system because their position can be explicitly and\ncontinuously tracked, allowing their social networks to be accurately\nconstructed. We used radio-frequency tags to accurately track cattle position\nand analyze high-resolution cattle social networks. We tested the hypothesis of\ntemporal stationarity and spatial homogeneity in these high-resolution networks\nand demonstrated substantial spatial-temporal heterogeneity during different\ndaily time periods (feeding and non-feeding) and in different areas of the pen\n(grain bunk, water trough, hay bunk, and other general pen area). The social\nnetwork structure is analyzed using global network characteristics (network\ndensity, exponential random graph model structure), subgroup clustering\n(modularity), triadic property (transitivity), and dyadic interactions\n(correlation coefficient from a quadratic assignment procedure). Cattle tend to\nhave the strongest and most consistent contacts with others around the hay bunk\nduring the feeding time. These results cannot be determined from data at lower\nspatial (aggregated at entire pen level) or temporal (aggregated at daily\nlevel) resolution. These results reveal new insights for real-time animal\nsocial network structure dynamics, providing more accurate descriptions that\nallow more accurate modeling of multiple (both direct and indirect) disease\ntransmission pathways.\n", "  Intracellular fluctuations, mainly triggered by gene expression, are an\ninevitable phenomenon observed in living cells. It influences generation of\nphenotypic diversity in genetically identical cells. Such variation of cellular\ncomponents is beneficial in some contexts but detrimental in others. To\nquantify the fluctuations in a gene product, we undertake an analytical scheme\nfor studying few naturally abundant linear as well as branched chain network\nmotifs. We solve the Langevin equations associated with each motif under the\npurview of linear noise approximation and quantify Fano factor and mutual\ninformation. Both quantifiable expressions exclusively depend on the relaxation\ntime (decay rate constant) and steady state population of the network\ncomponents. We investigate the effect of relaxation time constraints on Fano\nfactor and mutual information to indentify a time scale domain where a network\ncan recognize the fluctuations associated with the input signal more reliably.\nWe also show how input population affects both quantities. We extend our\ncalculation to long chain linear motif and show that with increasing chain\nlength, the Fano factor value increases but the mutual information processing\ncapability decreases. In this type of motif, the intermediate components are\nshown to act as a noise filter that tune up input fluctuations and maintain\noptimum fluctuations in the output. For branched chain motifs, both quantities\nvary within a large scale due to their network architecture and facilitate\nsurvival of living system in diverse environmental conditions.\n", "  In the present and accompanying papers we explicitly construct the on-shell\nsupersymmetric component actions for 3-branes moving in D=6 and in D=8 within\nthe nonlinear realizations framework.\n  In the first paper we apply our schema to construct the action of\nsupersymmetric 3-brane in D=6. It turns out that all ingredients entering the\ncomponent action can be obtained almost algorithmically by using the nonlinear\nrealizations approach. Within this approach, properly adapted to the\nconstruction of on-shell component actions, we pay much attention to broken\nsupersymmetry. Doing so, we were able to write the action in terms of purely\ngeometric objects (vielbeins and covariant derivatives of the physical bosonic\ncomponents), covariant with respect to broken supersymmetry. It turns out that\nall terms of the higher orders in the fermions, are hidden inside these\ncovariant derivatives and vielbeins. Moreover, the main part of the component\naction just mimics its bosonic cousin in which the ordinary space-time\nderivatives and the bosonic world volume are replaced by their covariant\nsupersymmetric analogs. The Wess-Zumino term in the action, which does not\nexist in the bosonic case, can be also easily constructed in terms of reduced\nCartan forms. Keeping the broken supersymmetry almost explicit, one may write\nthe Ansatz for the component action, fully defined up to two constant\nparameters. The role of the unbroken supersymmetry is just to fix these\nparameters.\n", "  Au-induced atomic wires on the Ge(001) surface were recently claimed to be an\nideal 1D metal and their tunneling spectra were analyzed as the manifestation\nof a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) state. We reinvestigate this system for\natomically well-ordered areas of the surface with high resolution scanning\ntunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STS). The local density-of-states maps\ndo not provide any evidence of a metallic 1D electron channel along the wires.\nMoreover, the atomically resolved tunneling spectra near the Fermi energy are\ndominated by local density-of-states features, deviating qualitatively from the\npower-law behavior. On the other hand, the defects strongly affect the\ntunneling spectra near the Fermi level. These results do not support the\npossibility of a TLL state for this system. An 1D metallic system with\nwell-defined 1D bands and without defects are required for the STS study of a\nTLL state.\n", "  We prove that spacetime is locally inertial at points of shock wave collision\nin General Relativity. The result applies for collisions between shock waves\ncoming from different characteristic families, in spherically symmetric\nspacetimes. We give a constructive proof that there exist coordinate\ntransformations which raise the regularity of the gravitational metric tensor\nfrom $C^{0,1}$ to $C^{1,1}$ in a neighborhood of such points of shock wave\ninteraction, and a $C^{1,1}$ metric regularity suffices for locally inertial\nframes to exist. This result corrects an error in our earlier RSPA-publication,\nwhich led us to the wrong conclusion that such coordinate transformations,\nwhich smooth the metric to $C^{1,1}$, cannot exist. Our result here proves that\nregularity singularities, (a type of mild singularity introduced in our\nRSPA-publication), do not exist at points of interacting shock waves from\ndifferent families in spherically symmetric spacetimes, and this generalizes\nIsrael's famous 1966 result to the case of such shock wave interactions. The\nstrategy of proof here is an extension of the strategy outlined in our\nRSPA-paper, but differs fundamentally from the method used by Israel. The\nquestion whether regularity singularities exist in more complicated shock wave\nsolutions of the Einstein Euler equations still remains open.\n", "  Using data collected with the BESIII detector operating at the Beijing\nElectron Positron Collider at center-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}=4.23$, 4.26,\nand 4.36~GeV, we observe $\\EE\\to \\pphc$ for the first time. The Born cross\nsections are measured and found to be about half of those of $\\EE\\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-h_c$ within less than 2$\\sigma$. In the $\\pi^0h_c$ mass spectrum, a\nstructure at 4.02~GeV/$c^2$ is found. It is most likely to be the neutral\nisospin partner of the $\\zcp^{\\pm}$ observed in the process of $\\EE\\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-h_c$ is found. A fit to the $\\pi^0 h_c$ invariant mass spectrum, with\nthe width of the $\\zcpn$ fixed to that of its charged isospin partner and\npossible interferences with non-$\\zcpn$ amplitudes neglected, gives a mass of\n($4023.9\\pm 2.2 \\pm 3.8$)~MeV/$c^2$ for the $\\zcpn$, where the first error is\nstatistical and the second systematic.\n", "  Synchronous extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and single-cycle terahertz (THz) bursts\nare generated in argon plasma induced by intense two-color femtosecond laser\npulses. Correlations between the intensity of the even and odd high-harmonics\nand the THz radiation are found by studying the phase-delay between the\nexcitation pulses at 800 and 400 nm as well as the degree of polar asymmetry in\nthe incident electric field. Experiments in both the weak- and strong- polar\nasymmetric regimes show remarkable agreement with a simple analytical model\nbased on classical electron trajectories in an arbitrary synthetic electric\nfield.\n", "  We show that electric field confinement in surface plasmon polaritons\npropagating at the metal/dielectric interfaces enhances the loss due to Landau\ndamping and which effectively limits the degree of confinement itself. We prove\nthat Landau damping and associated with it surface collision damping follow\ndirectly from Lindhard formula for the dielectric constant of free electron gas\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that even if all the conventional loss mechanisms,\ncaused by phonons, electron-electron, and interface roughness scattering, were\neliminated, the maximum attainable degree of confinement and the loss\naccompanying it would not change significantly compared to the best existing\nplasmonic materials, such as silver.\n", "  Spherical deconvolution (SD) methods are widely used to estimate the\nintra-voxel white-matter fiber orientations from diffusion MRI data. However,\nwhile some of these methods assume a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for the\nunderlying noise, its real distribution is known to be non-Gaussian and to\ndepend on the methodology used to combine multichannel signals. Indeed, the two\nprevailing methods for multichannel signal combination lead to Rician and\nnoncentral Chi noise distributions. Here we develop a Robust and Unbiased\nModel-BAsed Spherical Deconvolution (RUMBA-SD) technique, intended to deal with\nrealistic MRI noise, based on a Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm adapted to\nRician and noncentral Chi likelihood models. To quantify the benefits of using\nproper noise models, RUMBA-SD was compared with dRL-SD, a well-established\nmethod based on the RL algorithm for Gaussian noise. Another aim of the study\nwas to quantify the impact of including a total variation (TV) spatial\nregularization term in the estimation framework. To do this, we developed TV\nspatially-regularized versions of both RUMBA-SD and dRL-SD algorithms. The\nevaluation was performed by comparing various quality metrics on 132\nthree-dimensional synthetic phantoms involving different inter-fiber angles and\nvolume fractions, which were contaminated with noise mimicking patterns\ngenerated by data processing in multichannel scanners. The results demonstrate\nthat the inclusion of proper likelihood models leads to an increased ability to\nresolve fiber crossings with smaller inter-fiber angles and to better detect\nnon-dominant fibers. The inclusion of TV regularization dramatically improved\nthe resolution power of both techniques. The above findings were also verified\nin brain data.\n", "  Comparison of galaxy flows with those predicted from the local galaxy\ndistribution ended as an active field after two analyses came to vastly\ndifferent conclusions 25 years ago, but that was due to faulty data.\n  All the old results are therefore suspect. With new data collected in the\nlast several years, the problem deserves another look.\n  For this we analyze the gravity field inferred from the enormous data set\nderived from the 2MASS collection of galaxies, and compare it to the velocity\nfield derived from the well calibrated SFI++ Tully-Fisher catalog. Using the\n\"Inverse Method\" to minimize Malmquist biases, within 10,000 km/s the gravity\nfield is seen to predict the velocity field to remarkable consistency. This is\na beautiful demonstration of linear perturbation theory and is fully consistent\nwith standard values of the cosmological variables.\n", "  In this series of papers, we investigate the projective framework initiated\nby Jerzy Kijowski and Andrzej Oko{\\l}\\'ow, which describes the states of a\nquantum theory as projective families of density matrices. After discussing the\nformalism at the classical level in a first paper, the present second paper is\ndevoted to the quantum theory. In particular, we inspect in detail how such\nquantum projective state spaces relate to inductive limit Hilbert spaces and to\ninfinite tensor product constructions. Regarding the quantization of classical\nprojective structures into quantum ones, we extend the results by Oko{\\l}\\'ow\n[Oko{\\l}\\'ow 2013, arXiv:1304.6330], that were set up in the context of linear\nconfiguration spaces, to configuration spaces given by simply-connected Lie\ngroups, and to holomorphic quantization of complex phase spaces.\n", "  We develop a theory of amorphous interfaces in glass-forming liquids. We show\nthat the statistical properties of these surfaces, which separate regions\ncharacterized by different amorphous arrangements of particles, coincide with\nthe ones of domain walls in the random field Ising model. A major consequence\nof our results is that super-cooled liquids are characterized by two different\nstatic lengths: the point-to-set $\\xi_{PS}$ which is a measure of the spatial\nextent of cooperative rearranging regions and the wandering length $\\xi_\\perp$\nwhich is related to the fluctuations of their shape. We find that $\\xi_\\perp$\ngrows when approaching the glass transition but slower than $\\xi_{PS}$. The\nwandering length increases as $s_c^{-1/2}$, where $s_c$ is the configurational\nentropy. Our results strengthen the relationship with the random field Ising\nmodel found in recent works. They are in agreement with previous numerical\nstudies of amorphous interfaces and provide a theoretical framework for\nexplaining numerical and experimental findings on pinned particle systems and\nstatic lengths in glass-forming liquids.\n", "  The observation and electrical manipulation of infrared surface plasmons in\ngraphene have triggered a search for similar photonic capabilities in other\natomically thin materials that enable electrical modulation of light at visible\nand near-infrared frequencies, as well as strong interaction with optical\nquantum emitters. Here, we present a simple analytical description of the\noptical response of such kinds of structures, which we exploit to investigate\ntheir application to light modulation and quantum optics. Specifically, we show\nthat plasmons in one-atom-thick noble-metal layers can be used both to produce\ncomplete tunable optical absorption and to reach the strong-coupling regime in\nthe interaction with neighboring quantum emitters. Our methods are applicable\nto any plasmon-supporting thin materials, and in particular, we provide\nparameters that allow us to readily calculate the response of silver, gold, and\ngraphene islands. Besides their interest for nanoscale electro-optics, the\npresent study emphasizes the great potential of these structures for the design\nof quantum nanophotonics devices.\n", "  A brief introduction and overview of the astrochemistry of dust, ice and gas\nand their interplay is presented, aimed at non-specialists. The importance of\nbasic chemical physics studies of critical reactions is illustrated through a\nnumber of recent examples. Such studies have also triggered new insight into\nchemistry, illustrating how astronomy and chemistry can enhance each other.\nMuch of the chemistry in star- and planet-forming regions is now thought to be\ndriven by gas-grain chemistry rather than pure gas-phase chemistry, and a\ncritical discussion of the state of such models is given. Recent developments\nin studies of diffuse clouds and PDRs, cold dense clouds, hot cores,\nprotoplanetary disks and exoplanetary atmospheres are summarized, both for\nsimple and more complex molecules, with links to papers presented in this\nvolume. In spite of many lingering uncertainties, the future of astrochemistry\nis bright: new observational facilities promise major advances in our\nunderstanding of the journey of gas, ice and dust from clouds to planets.\n", "  Observational evidence seems to indicate that the depletion of interstellar\ncarbon into dust shows rather wide variations and that carbon undergoes rather\nrapid recycling in the interstellar medium (ISM). Small hydrocarbon grains are\nprocessed in photo-dissociation regions by UV photons, by ion and electron\ncollisions in interstellar shock waves and by cosmic rays. A significant\nfraction of hydrocarbon dust must therefore be re-formed by accretion in the\ndense, molecular ISM. A new dust model (Jones et al., Astron. Astrophys., 2013,\n558, A62) shows that variations in the dust observables in the diffuse\ninterstellar medium (nH = 1000 cm^3), can be explained by systematic and\nenvironmentally-driven changes in the small hydrocarbon grain population. Here\nwe explore the consequences of gas-phase carbon accretion onto the surfaces of\ngrains in the transition regions between the diffuse ISM and molecular clouds\n(e.g., Jones, Astron. Astrophys., 2013, 555, A39). We find that significant\ncarbonaceous dust re-processing and/or mantle accretion can occur in the outer\nregions of molecular clouds and that this dust will have significantly\ndifferent optical properties from the dust in the adjacent diffuse ISM. We\nconclude that the (re-)processing and cycling of carbon into and out of dust is\nperhaps the key to advancing our understanding of dust evolution in the ISM.\n", "  In the present paper we explicitly construct the on-shell supersymmetric\ncomponent action for a 3-brane moving in D=8 within the nonlinear realizations\nframework. Similarly to the previously considered case of the super 3-brane in\nD=6, all ingredients entering the component action follow from the nonlinear\nrealizations approach. The component action of the 3-brane possesses N=4, d=4\nsupersymmetry partially broken to N=2, d=4 one. The basic Goldstone superfield\nis the generalized version of N=2,d=4 hypermultiplet. The action has a\nstructure, such that all terms of higher orders in the fermions are hidden\ninside the covariant derivatives and vielbeins. The main part of the component\naction mimics its bosonic cousin in which the ordinary space-time derivatives\nand the bosonic worldvolume are replaced by their covariant (with respect to\nbroken supersymmetry) supersymmetric analogs. The spontaneously broken\nsupersymmetry fixes the Ansatz for the component action, up to two constant\nparameters. The role of the unbroken supersymmetry is just to fix these\nparameters.\n", "  Realizing an optimal Schottky interface of graphene on Si is challenging, as\nthe electrical transport strongly depends on the graphene quality and the\nfabrication processes. Such interfaces are of increasing research interest for\nintegration in diverse electronic devices as they are thermally and chemically\nstable in all environments, unlike standard metal/semiconductor interfaces. We\nfabricate such interfaces with n-type Si at ambient conditions and find their\nelectrical characteristics to be highly rectifying, with minimal reverse\nleakage current ($<$10$^{-10}$ A) and rectification of more than $10^6$. We\nextract Schottky barrier height of 0.69 eV for the exfoliated graphene and 0.83\neV for the CVD graphene devices at room temperature. The temperature dependent\nelectrical characteristics suggest the influence of inhomogeneities at the\ngraphene/n-Si interface. A quantitative analysis of the inhomogeneity in\nSchottky barrier heights is presented using the potential fluctuation model\nproposed by Werner and G\\\"{u}ttler.\n", "  We propose a metric which can be used to compute the amount of heritable\nvariation enabled by a given dynamical system. A distribution of selection\npressures is used such that each pressure selects a particular fixed point via\ncompetitive exclusion in order to determine the corresponding distribution of\npotential fixed points in the population dynamics. This metric accurately\ndetects the number of species present in artificially prepared test systems,\nand furthermore can correctly determine the number of heritable sets in\nclustered transition matrix models in which there are no clearly defined\ngenomes. Finally, we apply our metric to the GARD model and show that it\naccurately reproduces prior measurements of the model's heritability.\n", "  A novel continuum theory of incoherent interfaces with triple junctions is\napplied to study three-dimensional coupled grain boundary (GB) motion in\npolycrystalline materials. The kinetic relations for grain dynamics, relative\nsliding and migration of the boundary, and junction evolution are developed. In\ndoing so a vectorial form of the geometric coupling factor, which relates the\ntangential motion at the GB to the migration, is also obtained. Diffusion along\nthe GBs and the junctions is allowed so as to prevent nucleation of voids and\noverlapping of material near the GBs. The coupled dynamics has been studied in\ndetail for two bicrystalline and one tricrystalline arrangements. The first\nbicrystal consists of two rectangular grains separated by a GB, while the\nsecond is composed of a spherical grain embedded inside a larger grain. The\ntricrystal has an arbitrary shaped grain embedded inside a much larger\nbicrystal made of two rectangular grains. In all these cases, analytical\nsolutions are obtained wherever possible while emphasizing the role of various\nkinetic coefficients during the coupled motion.\n", "  Compared with the semiconductors such as silicon and gallium arsenide which\nhave been used widely for decades, semimetals have not received much attention\nin the field of condensed matter physics until very recently. The realization\nof electronic topological properties has motivated interest of investigations\non Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals, which are predicted to show\nunprecedented features beyond the classical electronic theories of metals. In\nthis letter for the first time we report the electric transport properties of a\nrobust Weyl semimetal candidate proposed by recent theoretical calculations,\nTaAs. Our study shows that this bulk material manifests ultrahigh carrier\nmobility ($\\mathrm{5\\times10^5 cm^2/V\\cdot{s}}$) accompanied by an extremely\nlarge, unsaturated linear magnetoresistance ($\\mathrm{MR}$), which reaches 5400\nat 10 Kelvins in a magnetic field of 9 Teslas and 2.47$\\times$10$^4$ at 1.5\nKelvins in a magnetic field of 56 Teslas. We also observed strong Shubnikov-de\nHaas (SdH) oscillations associated with an extremely low quantum limit ($\\sim$8\nTeslas). Further studies on TaAs, especially in the ultraquantum limit regime,\nwill help to extend the realization of the topological properties of these\nexotic electrons.\n", "  We determine the current status of the fundamental composite electroweak\ndynamics paradigm after the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron\nCollider experiments. Our analysis serves as universal and minimal template for\na wide class of models with the two limits in parameter space being composite\nGoldstone Higgs models and Technicolor. This is possible because of the\nexistence of a unified description, both at the effective and fundamental\nLagrangian levels, of models of composite Higgs dynamics where the Higgs boson\nitself can emerge, depending on the way the electroweak symmetry is embedded,\neither as a pseudo-Goldstone boson or as a massive excitation of the\ncondensate. We constrain the available parameter space at the effective\nLagrangian level. We show that a wide class of models of fundamental composite\nelectroweak dynamics, including Technicolor, are compatible with experiments.\nThe results are relevant for future searches of a fundamental composite nature\nof the Higgs mechanism at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  Among the properties that are common to complex systems, the presence of\ncritical thresholds in the dynamics of the system is one of the most important.\nRecently, there has been interest in the universalities that occur in the\nbehavior of systems near critical points. These universal properties make it\npossible to estimate how far a system is from a critical threshold. Several\nearly-warning signals have been reported in time series representing systems\nnear catastrophic shifts. The proper understanding of these early-warnings may\nallow the prediction and perhaps control of these dramatic shifts in a wide\nvariety of systems. In this paper we analyze this universal behavior for a\nsystem that is a paradigm of phase transitions, the Ising model. We study the\nbehavior of the early-warning signals and the way the temporal correlations of\nthe system increase when the system is near the critical point.\n", "  The effects of interpersonal interactions on individual's agreements result\nin a social aggregation process which is reflected in the formation of\ncollective states, as for instance, groups of individuals with a similar\nopinion about a given issue. This field, which has been a longstanding concern\nof sociologists and psychologists, has been extended into an area of\nexperimental social psychology, and even has attracted the attention of\nphysicists and mathematicians. In this article, we present a novel model of\nopinion formation in which agents may either have a strict preference for a\nchoice, or be undecided. The opinion shift emerges during interpersonal\ncommunications, as a consequence of a cumulative process of conviction for one\nof the two extremes opinions through repeated interactions. There are two main\ningredients which play key roles in determining the steady state: the initial\nfraction of undecided agents and the conviction's sensitivity in each\ninteraction. As a function of these two parameters, the model presents a wide\nrange of possible solutions, as for instance, consensus of each opinion,\nbi-polarisation or convergence of undecided individuals. We found that a\nminimum fraction of undecided agents is crucial not only for reaching consensus\nof a given opinion, but also to determine a dominant opinion in a polarised\nsituation. In order to gain a deeper comprehension of the dynamics, we also\npresent the theoretical master equations of the model.\n", "  Self-sustained detonation waves in flake aluminum dust/air mixtures have been\nstudied in a tube of diameter 199 mm and length 32.4 m. A pressure sensor array\nof 32 sensors mounted around certain circumferences of the tube was used to\nmeasure the shape of the detonation front in the circumferential direction and\npressure histories of the detonation wave. A two-head spin detonation wave\nfront was observed for the aluminum dust/air mixtures, and the cellular\nstructure resulting from the spinning movement of the triple point was\nanalyzed. The variations in velocity and overpressure of the detonation wave\nwith propagation distance in a cell were studied. The interactions of waves in\ntriple-point configurations were analyzed and the flow-field parameters were\ncalculated. Three types of triple-point configuration exist in the wave front\nof the detonation wave of an aluminum dust/air mixture. Both strong and weak\ntransverse waves exist in the unstable self-sustained detonation wave.\n", "  VMAT optimization is a computationally challenging problem due to its large\ndata size, high degrees of freedom, and many hardware constraints.\nHigh-performance graphics processing units have been used to speed up the\ncomputations. However, its small memory size cannot handle cases with a large\ndose-deposition coefficient (DDC) matrix. This paper is to report an\nimplementation of our column-generation based VMAT algorithm on a multi-GPU\nplatform to solve the memory limitation problem. The column-generation approach\ngenerates apertures sequentially by solving a pricing problem (PP) and a master\nproblem (MP) iteratively. The DDC matrix is split into four sub-matrices\naccording to beam angles, stored on four GPUs in compressed sparse row format.\nComputation of beamlet price is accomplished using multi-GPU. While the\nremaining steps of PP and MP problems are implemented on a single GPU due to\ntheir modest computational loads. A H&N patient case was used to validate our\nmethod. We compare our multi-GPU implementation with three single GPU\nimplementation strategies: truncating DDC matrix (S1), repeatedly transferring\nDDC matrix between CPU and GPU (S2), and porting computations involving DDC\nmatrix to CPU (S3). Two more H&N patient cases and three prostate cases were\nalso used to demonstrate the advantages of our method. Our multi-GPU\nimplementation can finish the optimization within ~1 minute for the H&N patient\ncase. S1 leads to an inferior plan quality although its total time was 10\nseconds shorter than the multi-GPU implementation. S2 and S3 yield same plan\nquality as the multi-GPU implementation but take ~4 minutes and ~6 minutes,\nrespectively. High computational efficiency was consistently achieved for the\nother 5 cases. The results demonstrate that the multi-GPU implementation can\nhandle the large-scale VMAT optimization problem efficiently without\nsacrificing plan quality.\n", "  Monte Carlo (MC) method has been recognized the most accurate dose\ncalculation method for radiotherapy. However, its extremely long computation\ntime impedes clinical applications. Recently, a lot of efforts have been made\nto realize fast MC dose calculation on GPUs. Nonetheless, most of the GPU-based\nMC dose engines were developed in NVidia CUDA environment. This limits the code\nportability to other platforms, hindering the introduction of GPU-based MC\nsimulations to clinical practice. The objective of this paper is to develop a\nfast cross-platform MC dose engine oclMC using OpenCL environment for external\nbeam photon and electron radiotherapy in MeV energy range. Coupled\nphoton-electron MC simulation was implemented with analogue simulations for\nphoton transports and a Class II condensed history scheme for electron\ntransports. To test the accuracy and efficiency of our dose engine oclMC, we\ncompared dose calculation results of oclMC and gDPM, our previously developed\nGPU-based MC code, for a 15 MeV electron beam and a 6 MV photon beam on a\nhomogenous water phantom, one slab phantom and one half-slab phantom.\nSatisfactory agreement was observed in all the cases. The average dose\ndifferences within 10% isodose line of the maximum dose were 0.48-0.53% for the\nelectron beam cases and 0.15-0.17% for the photon beam cases. In terms of\nefficiency, our dose engine oclMC was 6-17% slower than gDPM when running both\ncodes on the same NVidia TITAN card due to both different physics particle\ntransport models and different computational environments between CUDA and\nOpenCL. The cross-platform portability was also validated by successfully\nrunning our new dose engine on a set of different compute devices including an\nNvidia GPU card, two AMD GPU cards and an Intel CPU card using one or four\ncores. Computational efficiency among these platforms was compared.\n", "  Magnetic resonance with ensembles of electron spins is nowadays performed in\nfrequency ranges up to 240 GHz and in corresponding magnetic fields of up to 10\nT. However, experiments with single electron and nuclear spins so far only\nreach into frequency ranges of several 10 GHz, where existing coplanar\nwaveguide structures for microwave (MW) delivery are compatible with single\nspin readout techniques (e.g. electrical or optical readout). Here, we explore\nthe frequency range up to 90 GHz, respectively magnetic fields of up to\n$\\approx 3\\,$T for single spin magnetic resonance in conjunction with optical\nspin readout. To this end, we develop MW resonators with optical single spin\naccess. In our case, rectangular E-band waveguides guarantee low-loss supply of\nmicrowaves to the resonators. Three dimensional cavities, as well as coplanar\nwaveguide resonators enhance MW fields by spatial and spectral confinement with\na MW efficiency of $1.36\\,\\mathrm{mT/\\sqrt{W}}$. We utilize single NV centers\nas hosts for optically accessible spins, and show, that their properties\nregarding optical spin readout known from smaller fields (<0.65 T) are retained\nup to fields of 3 T. In addition, we demonstrate coherent control of single\nnuclear spins under these conditions. Furthermore, our results extend the\napplicable magnetic field range of a single spin magnetic field sensor.\nRegarding spin based quantum registers, high fields lead to a purer product\nbasis of electron and nuclear spins, which promises improved spin lifetimes.\nFor example, during continuous single-shot readout the $^{14}$N nuclear spin\nshows second-long longitudinal relaxation times.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive method for constructing Lax pairs\nof discrete Painlev\\'e equations by using a reduced hypercube structure. In\nparticular, we consider the $A_5^{(1)}$-surface $q$-Painlev\\'e system which has\nthe affine Weyl group symmetry of type $(A_2+A_1)^{(1)}$. Two new Lax pairs are\nfound.\n", "  Detecting spreading outbreaks in social networks with sensors is of great\nsignificance in applications. Inspired by the formation mechanism of human's\nphysical sensations to external stimuli, we propose a new method to detect the\ninfluence of spreading by constructing excitable sensor networks. Exploiting\nthe amplifying effect of excitable sensor networks, our method can better\ndetect small-scale spreading processes. At the same time, it can also\ndistinguish large-scale diffusion instances due to the self-inhibition effect\nof excitable elements. Through simulations of diverse spreading dynamics on\ntypical real-world social networks (facebook, coauthor and email social\nnetworks), we find that the excitable senor networks are capable of detecting\nand ranking spreading processes in a much wider range of influence than other\ncommonly used sensor placement methods, such as random, targeted, acquaintance\nand distance strategies. In addition, we validate the efficacy of our method\nwith diffusion data from a real-world online social system, Twitter. We find\nthat our method can detect more spreading topics in practice. Our approach\nprovides a new direction in spreading detection and should be useful for\ndesigning effective detection methods.\n", "  We derive the general formulae for the the scalar and tensor spectral tilts\nto the second order for the inflationary models with non-minimally derivative\ncoupling without taking the high friction limit. The non-minimally kinetic\ncoupling to Einstein tensor brings the energy scale in the inflationary models\ndown to be sub-Planckian. In the high friction limit, the Lyth bound is\nmodified with an extra suppression factor, so that the field excursion of the\ninflaton is sub-Planckian. The inflationary models with non-minimally\nderivative coupling are more consistent with observations in the high friction\nlimit. In particular, with the help of the non-minimally derivative coupling,\nthe quartic power law potential is consistent with the observational constraint\nat 95\\% CL.\n", "  A series of recent works studying a database of chronologically sorted chess\ngames --containing 1.4 million games played by humans between 1998 and 2007--\nhave shown that the popularity distribution of chess game-lines follows a\nZipf's law, and that time series inferred from the sequences of those\ngame-lines exhibit long-range memory effects. The presence of Zipf's law\ntogether with long-range memory effects was observed in several systems,\nhowever, the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena were always studied\nseparately up to now. In this work, by making use of a variant of the\nYule-Simon preferential growth model, introduced by Cattuto et al., we provide\nan explanation for the simultaneous emergence of Zipf's law and long-range\ncorrelations memory effects in a chess database. We find that Cattuto's Model\n(CM) is able to reproduce both, Zipf's law and the long-range correlations,\nincluding size-dependent scaling of the Hurst exponent for the corresponding\ntime series. CM allows an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of these\ntwo phenomena via a preferential growth dynamics, including a memory kernel, in\nthe popularity distribution of chess game-lines. This mechanism results in an\naging process in the chess game-line choice as the database grows. Moreover, we\nfind burstiness in the activity of subsets of the most active players, although\nthe aggregated activity of the pool of players displays inter-event times\nwithout burstiness. We show that CM is not able to produce time series with\nbursty behavior providing evidence that burstiness is not required for the\nexplanation of the long-range correlation effects in the chess database.\n", "  This review summarizes the results of a series of recent papers, where a\nmicroscopic model underlying the physics of elementary particles has been\nproposed. The 'tetron model' relies on the existence of an internal isospin\nspace, in which an independent physical dynamics takes place. This idea is\ncritically re-considered in the present work. As becomes evident in the course\nof discussion, the model not only describes electroweak phenomena but also\nmodifies our understanding of other physical topics, like gravity, the big bang\ncosmology and the nature of the strong interactions.\n", "  In computational neuroscience, it is common to use the simplifying assumption\nthat diffusive currents are negligible compared to Ohmic currents. However,\nendured periods of intense neural signaling may cause local ion concentration\nchanges in the millimolar range. Theoretical studies have identified scenarios\nwhere steep concentration gradients give rise to diffusive currents that are of\ncomparable magnitude with Ohmic currents, and where the simplifying assumption\nthat diffusion can be neglected does not hold. We here propose a novel\nformalism for computing (1) the ion concentration dynamics and (2) the\nelectrical potential in the extracellular space surrounding multi-compartmental\nneuron models or networks of such (e.g., the Blue-Brain simulator). We use this\nformalism to explore the effects that diffusive currents can have on the\nextracellular (ECS) potential surrounding a small population of active cortical\nneurons. Our key findings are: (i) Sustained periods of neuronal output\n(simulations were run for 84 s) could change local ECS ion concentrations by\nseveral mM, as observed experimentally. (ii) For large, but realistic,\nconcentration gradients, diffusive currents in the ECS were of the same\nmagnitude as Ohmic currents. (iii) Neuronal current sources could induce local\nchanges in the ECS potential by a few mV, whereas diffusive currents could\ncould induce local changes in the ECS potential by a few tens of a mV.\nDiffusive currents could thus have a quite significant impact on ECS\npotentials. (v) Potential variations caused by diffusive currents were quite\nslow, but could influence the comparable to those induced by Ohmic currents up\nto frequencies as high as 7Hz.\n", "  We propose that ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) above $10^{18}$eV\nare produced in relativistic jets of powerful active galactic nuclei via an\noriginal mechanism, which we dub \"espresso\" acceleration: \"seed\" galactic CRs\nwith energies $\\lesssim 10^{17}$eV that penetrate the jet sideways receive a\n\"one-shot'\" boost of a factor of $\\sim\\Gamma^2$ in energy, where $\\Gamma$ is\nthe Lorentz factor of the relativistic flow. For typical jet parameters, a few\npercent of the CRs in the host galaxy can undergo this process, and powerful\nblazars with $\\Gamma\\gtrsim 30$ may accelerate UHECRs up to more than\n$10^{20}$eV. The chemical composition of espresso-accelerated UHECRs is\ndetermined by that at the Galactic CR knee and is expected to be\nproton-dominated at $10^{18}$eV and increasingly heavy at higher energies, in\nagreement with recent observations made at the Pierre Auger Observatory.\n", "  Understanding human mobility patterns -- how people move in their everyday\nlives -- is an interdisciplinary research field. It is a question with roots\nback to the 19th century that has been dramatically revitalized with the recent\nincrease in data availability. Models of human mobility often take the\npopulation distribution as a starting point. Another, sometimes more accurate,\ndata source is land-use maps. In this paper, we discuss how the intra-city\nmovement patterns, and consequently population distribution, can be predicted\nfrom such data sources. As a link between land use and mobility, we show that\nthe purposes of people's trips are strongly correlated with the land use of the\ntrip's origin and destination. We calibrate, validate and discuss our model\nusing survey data.\n", "  It is an open question whether solutions of the Einstein-Euler equations are\nsmooth enough to admit locally inertial coordinates at points of shock wave\ninteraction, or whether \"regularity singularities\" can exist at such points.\nThe term {\\it regularity singularity} was proposed by the authors as a point in\nspacetime where the gravitational metric tensor is Lipschitz continuous\n($C^{0,1}$), but no smoother, in any coordinate system of the $C^{1,1}$ atlas.\nAn existence theory for shock wave solutions in $C^{0,1}$ admitting arbitrary\ninteractions has been proven for the Einstein-Euler equations in spherically\nsymmetric spacetimes, but $C^{1,1}$ is the requisite smoothness required for\nspace-time to be locally flat. Thus the open problem of regularity\nsingularities is the problem as to whether locally inertial coordinate systems\nexist at shock waves within the larger $C^{1,1}$ atlas. To clarify this open\nproblem, we identify new \"Coriolis type\" effects in the geometry of $C^{0,1}$\nshock wave metrics and prove they are essential in the sense that they can\nnever be made to vanish within the atlas of {\\it smooth} coordinate\ntransformations, the atlas usually assumed in classical differential geometry.\nThus the problem of existence of regularity singularities is equivalent to the\nquestion as to whether or not these Coriolis type effects are essentially\nnon-removable and `real', or merely coordinate effects that can be removed, (in\nanalogy to classical Coriolis forces), by going to the less regular atlas of\n$C^{1,1}$ transformations. If essentially non-removable, it would argue\nstrongly for a `real' new physical effect for General Relativity, providing a\nphysical context to the open problem of regularity singularities.\n", "  Adaptive Kinetic Monte Carlo combines the simplicity of Kinetic Monte Carlo\n(KMC) with a Molecular Dynamics (MD) based saddle point search algorithm in\norder to simulate metastable systems. Key to making Adaptive KMC effective is a\nstopping criterion for the saddle point search. In this work, we examine a\nrecent criterion, due to S. Chill and G. Henkelman, that is based on the\nfraction of total reaction rate found instead of the fraction of observed\nsaddles. The criterion uses the Eyring-Kramers law to estimate the reaction\nrate at the MD search temperature. We also consider a related criterion that\nremains valid when the Eyring-Kramers law is not. We examine the mathematical\nproperties of both estimators and prove their mean square errors are well\nbehaved, vanishing as the simulation continues to run.\n", "  [Abridged] This study presents the first Bayesian investigation of the\naccuracy with which the cosmological parameters can be measured using\ninformation coming \\emph{only} from the gravitational wave observations of\nbinary neutron star systems by Einstein Telescope. We find, by direct\nsimulation of $10^3$ detections of binary neutron stars, that, within our\nsimplifying assumptions, $H_0,\\Omega_m,\\Omega_\\Lambda,w_0$ and $w_1$ can be\nmeasured at the $95\\%$ level with an accuracy of $\\sim 8\\%,65\\%,39\\%,80\\%$ and\n$90\\%$, respectively. We also find, by extrapolation, that a measurement\naccuracy comparable with current measurements by Planck is possible if the\nnumber of gravitational wave events observed is $O(10^{6-7})$. We conclude\nthat, while not competitive with electro-magnetic missions in terms of\nsignificant digits, gravitational wave alone are capable of providing a\ncomplementary determination of the dynamics of the Universe.\n", "  We derive the holographic entanglement entropy contribution from pure and\nmixed gravitational Chern-Simons(CS) terms in AdS$_{2k+1}$. This is done\nthrough two different methods : first, by a direct evaluation of CS action in a\nholographic replica geometry and second by a descent of Dong's derivation\napplied to the corresponding anomaly polynomial. In lower dimensions $(k=1,2)$,\nthe formula coincides with the Wald-Tachikawa formula for black hole entropy\nfrom gravitational CS terms. New extrinsic curvature corrections appear for\n$k\\geq 3$ : we give explicit and concise expressions for the two pure\ngravitational CS terms in AdS$_7$ and present various consistency checks,\nincluding agreements with the black hole entropy formula when evaluated at the\nbifurcation surface.\n", "  Phase diagrams play a primary role in the understanding of materials\nproperties. For iron-based superconductors (Fe-SC), the correct definition of\ntheir phase diagrams is crucial because of the close interplay between their\ncrystallo-chemical and magnetic properties, on one side, and the possible\ncoexistence of magnetism and superconductivity, on the other. The two most\ndifficult issues for understanding the Fe-SC phase diagrams are: 1) the origin\nof the structural transformation taking place during cooling and its\nrelationship with magnetism; 2) the correct description of the region where a\ncrossover between the magnetic and superconducting electronic ground states\ntakes place. Hence a proper and accurate definition of the structural, magnetic\nand electronic phase boundaries provides an extremely powerful tool for\nmaterial scientists. For this reason, an exact definition of the thermodynamic\nphase fields characterizing the different structural and physical properties\ninvolved is needed, although it is not easy to obtain in many cases. Moreover,\nphysical properties can often be strongly dependent on the occurrence of\nmicro-structural and other local-scale features (lattice micro-strain, chemical\nfluctuations, domain walls, grain boundaries, defects), which, as a rule, are\nnot described in a structural phase diagram. In this review, we critically\nsummarize the results for the most studied 11-, 122- and 1111-type compound\nsystems, providing a correlation between experimental evidence and theory.\n", "  We study how a two-dimensional square sheet of droplets evolves to the\npreferred triangular lattice. The rearrangement can be induced either by an\nimpurity seed for flat sheets or by curving the sheet. We analyze the\npropagation of transformation fronts and the spatial reordering subsequent to\nthe initial perturbation.\n", "  For general two-electron two-centre integrals over Slater-type orbitals\n(STOs), the use of the Neumann expansion for the Coulomb interaction potential\nyields infinite series in terms of few basic functions. In many important cases\nthe number of terms necessary to achieve convergence by a straightforward\nsummation is large and one is forced to calculate the basic integrals of high\norder. We present a systematic approach to calculation of the higher-order\nterms in the Neumann series by large-order expansions of the basic integrals.\nThe final expressions are shown to be transparent and straightforward to\nimplement, and all auxiliary quantities can be calculated analytically.\nMoreover, numerical stability and computational efficiency are also discussed.\nResults of the present work can be used to speed up calculations of the STOs\nintegral files, but also to study convergence of the Neumann expansion and\ndevelop appropriate convergence accelerators.\n", "  Experiments at the Juelich Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) have now found\ncompelling evidence for a new resonant state in the two-baryon system with mass\n2380 MeV and a width of 70 MeV. The structure, containing six valence quarks,\nconstitutes a so-called dibaryon, either a hexaquark or a hadronic molecule.\nThe present knowledge about the dibaryon as well as other implications and\npossible future experiments are discussed.\n", "  We describe K-mouflage models of modified gravity using the effective field\ntheory of dark energy. We show how the Lagrangian density $K$ defining the\nK-mouflage models appears in the effective field theory framework, at both the\nexact fully nonlinear level and at the quadratic order of the effective action.\nWe find that K-mouflage scenarios only generate the operator $(\\delta\ng^{00}_{(u)})^n$ at each order $n$. We also reverse engineer K-mouflage models\nby reconstructing the whole effective field theory, and the full cosmological\nbehaviour, from two functions of the Jordan-frame scale factor in a tomographic\nmanner. This parameterisation is directly related to the implementation of the\nK-mouflage screening mechanism: screening occurs when $ K'$ is large in a dense\nenvironment such as the deep matter and radiation eras. In this way, K-mouflage\ncan be easily implemented as a calculable subclass of models described by the\neffective field theory of dark energy which could be probed by future surveys.\n", "  Human history has been marked by social instability and conflict, often\ndriven by the irreconcilability of opposing sets of beliefs, ideologies, and\nreligious dogmas. The dynamics of belief systems has been studied mainly from\ntwo distinct perspectives, namely how cognitive biases lead to individual\nbelief rigidity and how social influence leads to social conformity. Here we\npropose a unifying framework that connects cognitive and social forces together\nin order to study the dynamics of societal belief evolution. Each individual is\nendowed with a network of interacting beliefs that evolves through interaction\nwith other individuals in a social network. The adoption of beliefs is affected\nby both internal coherence and social conformity. Our framework explains how\nsocial instabilities can arise in otherwise homogeneous populations, how small\nnumbers of zealots with highly coherent beliefs can overturn societal\nconsensus, and how belief rigidity protects fringe groups and cults against\ninvasion from mainstream beliefs, allowing them to persist and even thrive in\nlarger societies. Our results suggest that strong consensus may be insufficient\nto guarantee social stability, that the cognitive coherence of belief-systems\nis vital in determining their ability to spread, and that coherent\nbelief-systems may pose a serious problem for resolving social polarization,\ndue to their ability to prevent consensus even under high levels of social\nexposure. We therefore argue that the inclusion of cognitive factors into a\nsocial model is crucial in providing a more complete picture of collective\nhuman dynamics.\n", "  Based on complex network theory, we propose a computational methodology that\naddresses the spatial distribution of fuel breaks for the inhibition of the\nspread and size of wildland fires on heterogeneous landscapes. This is a\ntwo-tire approach where the dynamics of fire spread are modeled as a random\nMarkov field process on a directed network whose edge weights, are provided by\na state-of-the-art cellular automata model that integrates detailed GIS,\nlandscape and meteorological data. Within this framework, the spatial\ndistribution of fuel breaks is reduced to the problem of finding the network\nnodes among which the fire spreads faster, thus their removal favours the\ninhibition of the fire propagation. Here this is accomplished exploiting the\ninformation centrality statistics. We illustrate the proposed approach through\n(a) an artificial forest of randomly distributed density of vegetation, and (b)\na real-world case concerning the island of Rhodes in Greece whose a major part\nof its forest burned in 2008. Simulation results show that the methodology\noutperforms significantly the benchmark tactic of random distribution of fuel\nbreaks.\n", "  We present a continuous formulation of epidemic spreading on multilayer\nnetworks using a tensorial representation, extending the models of monoplex\nnetworks to this context. We derive analytical expressions for the epidemic\nthreshold of the SIS and SIR dynamics, as well as upper and lower bounds for\nthe disease prevalence in the steady state for the SIS scenario. Using the\nquasi-stationary state method we numerically show the existence of disease\nlocalization and the emergence of two or more susceptibility peaks, which are\ncharacterized analytically and numerically through the inverse participation\nratio. Furthermore, when mapping the critical dynamics to an eigenvalue\nproblem, we observe a characteristic transition in the eigenvalue spectra of\nthe supra-contact tensor as a function of the ratio of two spreading rates: if\nthe rate at which the disease spreads within a layer is comparable to the\nspreading rate across layers, the individual spectra of each layer merge with\nthe coupling between layers. Finally, we verified the barrier effect, i.e., for\nthree-layer configuration, when the layer with the largest eigenvalue is\nlocated at the center of the line, it can effectively act as a barrier to the\ndisease. The formalism introduced here provides a unifying mathematical\napproach to disease contagion in multiplex systems opening new possibilities\nfor the study of spreading processes.\n", "  In this paper we solve analytically Dirac equation for Eckart plus Hulthen\npotentials with Coulomb-like and Yukawa-like tensor interaction in the presence\nof Spin and Pseudo-spin Symmetry for any k number. The Parametric\nNikiforov-Uvarov method is used to obtain the energy Eigen-values and wave\nfunctions. We also discuss the energy Eigen-values and the Dirac spinors for\nthe Eckart plus Hulthen potentials for the spin and pseudo-spin symmetry with\nPNU method. To show the accuracy of the present model, some numerical results\nare shown in both pseudo-spin and spin symmetry limits.\n", "  Using dark matter simulations we show how halo bias is determined by local\ndensity and not by halo mass. This is not totally surprising, as according to\nthe peak-background split model, local density is the property that constraints\nbias at large scales. Massive haloes have a high clustering because they reside\nin high density regions. Small haloes can be found in a wide range of\nenvironments which determine their clustering amplitudes differently. This\ncontradicts the assumption of standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)\nmodels that the bias and occupation of haloes is determined solely by their\nmass. We show that the bias of central galaxies from semi-analytic models of\ngalaxy formation as a function of luminosity and colour is not correctly\npredicted by the standard HOD model. Using local density instead of halo mass\nthe HOD model correctly predicts galaxy bias. These results indicate the need\nto include information about local density and not only mass in order to\ncorrectly apply HOD analysis in these galaxy samples. This new model can be\nreadily applied to observations and has the advantage that the galaxy density\ncan be directly observed, in contrast with the dark matter halo mass.\n", "  Isolated objects in asymptotically flat spacetimes in general relativity are\ncharacterized by their conserved charges associated with the\nBondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group. These charges include total energy, linear\nmomentum, intrinsic angular momentum and center-of-mass location, and, in\naddition, an infinite number of supermomentum charges associated with\nsupertranslations. Recently, it has been suggested that the BMS symmetry\nalgebra should be enlarged to include an infinite number of additional\nsymmetries known as superrotations. We show that the corresponding charges are\nfinite and well defined, and can be divided into electric parity \"super\ncenter-of-mass\" charges and magnetic parity \"superspin\" charges.\n  The supermomentum charges are associated with ordinary gravitational-wave\nmemory, and the super center-of-mass charges are associated with total\n(ordinary plus null) gravitational-wave memory, in the terminology of Bieri and\nGarfinkle. Superspin charges are associated with the ordinary piece of spin\nmemory. Some of these charges can give rise to black-hole hair, as described by\nStrominger and Zhiboedov. We clarify how this hair evades the no-hair theorems.\n", "  We discuss the extended on-mass-shell scheme for manifestly Lorentz-invariant\nbaryon chiral perturbation theory. We present a calculation of pion photo- and\nelectroproduction up to and including order $q^4$. The low-energy constants\nhave been fixed by fitting experimental data in all available reaction\nchannels. Our results can be accessed via a web interface, the so-called chiral\nMAID (http://www.kph.uni-mainz.de/MAID/chiralmaid/).\n", "  We present an analytic model for how momentum deposition from stellar\nfeedback simultaneously regulates star formation and drives outflows in a\nturbulent interstellar medium (ISM). Because the ISM is turbulent, a given\npatch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\\eta \\equiv M_{\\rm\nout}/M_{\\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the\ncircular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for\nlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline\nrapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive\nwinds with large mass-loading factors. Crucially, our model predicts that\nstellar-feedback-driven outflows should be suppressed at $z \\lesssim 1$ in\n$M_{\\star} \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ galaxies. This mechanism allows massive\ngalaxies to exhibit violent outflows at high redshifts and then 'shut down'\nthose outflows at late times, thereby enabling the formation of a smooth,\nextended thin stellar disk. We provide simple fitting functions for $\\eta$ that\nshould be useful for sub-resolution and semi-analytic models. [abridged]\n", "  We show the operation of a Cu/Al_2O_3/Cu/n-Si hot-electron transistor for the\nstraightforward determination of a metal/semiconductor energy barrier height\neven at temperatures below carrier-freeze out in the semiconductor. The\nhot-electron spectroscopy measurements return a fairly temperature independent\nvalue for the Cu/n-Si barrier of 0.66 $\\pm$ 0.04 eV at temperatures below 180\nK, in substantial accordance with mainstream methods based on complex fittings\nof either current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. The\nCu/n-Si hot-electron transistors exhibit an OFF current of ~2 * 10^-13 A, an\nON/OFF ratio of ~10^5 and an equivalent subtreshold swing of ~96 mV/dec at low\ntemperatures, which are suitable values for potential high frequency devices.\n", "  The order parameter of the smectic liquid crystal phase is the same as that\nof a superfluid or superconductor, namely a complex scalar field. We show that\nthe essential difference in boundary conditions between these systems leads to\na markedly different topological structure of the defects. Screw and edge\ndefects can be distinguished topologically. This implies an invariant on an\nedge dislocation loop so that smectic defects can be topologically linked not\nunlike defects in ordered systems with non-Abelian fundamental groups.\n", "  Compact expressions for the average subentropy and coherence are obtained for\nrandom mixed states that are generated via various probability measures.\nSurprisingly, our results show that the average subentropy of random mixed\nstates approaches to the maximum value of the subentropy which is attained for\nthe maximally mixed state as we increase the dimension. In the special case of\nthe random mixed states sampled from the induced measure via partial tracing of\nrandom bipartite pure states, we establish the typicality of the relative\nentropy of coherence for random mixed states invoking the concentration of\nmeasure phenomenon. Our results also indicate that mixed quantum states are\nless useful compared to pure quantum states in higher dimension when we extract\nquantum coherence as a resource. This is because of the fact that average\ncoherence of random mixed states is bounded uniformly, however, the average\ncoherence of random pure states increases with the increasing dimension. As an\nimportant application, we establish the typicality of relative entropy of\nentanglement and distillable entanglement for a specific class of random\nbipartite mixed states. In particular, most of the random states in this\nspecific class have relative entropy of entanglement and distillable\nentanglement equal to some fixed number (to within an arbitrary small error),\nthereby hugely reducing the complexity of computation of these entanglement\nmeasures for this specific class of mixed states.\n", "  On-line social networks publish information on a high volume of real-world\nevents almost instantly, becoming a primary source for breaking news. Some of\nthese real-world events can end up having a very strong impact on on-line\nsocial networks. The effect of such events can be analyzed from several\nperspectives, one of them being the intensity and characteristics of the\ncollective activity that it produces in the social platform. We research 5,234\nreal-world news events encompassing 43 million messages discussed on the\nTwitter microblogging service for approximately 1 year. We show empirically\nthat exogenous news events naturally create collective patterns of bursty\nbehavior in combination with long periods of inactivity in the network. This\ntype of behavior agrees with other patterns previously observed in other types\nof natural collective phenomena, as well as in individual human communications.\nIn addition, we propose a methodology to classify news events according to the\ndifferent levels of intensity in activity that they produce. In particular, we\nanalyze the most highly active events and observe a consistent and strikingly\ndifferent collective reaction from users when they are exposed to such events.\nThis reaction is independent of an event's reach and scope. We further observe\nthat extremely high-activity events have characteristics that are quite\ndistinguishable at the beginning stages of their outbreak. This allows us to\npredict with high precision, the top 8% of events that will have the most\nimpact in the social network by just using the first 5% of the information of\nan event's lifetime evolution. This strongly implies that high-activity events\nare naturally prioritized collectively by the social network, engaging users\nearly on, way before they are brought to the mainstream audience.\n", "  The origin of successive phase transitions observed in the layered perovskite\n$\\alpha$-Sr$_2$CrO$_4$ is studied by the density-functional-theory-based\nelectronic structure calculation and mean-field analysis of the proposed\nlow-energy effective model. We find that, despite the fact that the CrO$_6$\noctahedron is elongated along the $c$-axis of the crystal structure, the\ncrystal-field level of nondegenerate $3d_{xy}$ orbitals of the Cr ion is lower\nin energy than that of doubly degenerate $3d_{yz}$ and $3d_{xz}$ orbitals,\ngiving rise to the orbital degrees of freedom in the system with a $3d^2$\nelectron configuration. We show that the higher (lower) temperature phase\ntransition is caused by the ordering of the orbital (spin) degrees of freedom.\n", "  Surface plasma waves (SPWs) have been extensively studied in the past two\ndecades with a promise for many applications. However, the effort has so far\nbeen met with limited success. It is widely believed that a major caveat lies\nwith the energy losses experienced by SPWs during their propagation. To\ncompensate for the losses, amplifiers have been designed, which are all\nextrinsic and need an external agent to supply the energy. Here we\ntheoretically show that there exists an intrinsic amplification channel for\nSPWs in the collision-less limit. We pin down the origin of this channel and\nanalytically calculate the amplification rate. Our finding unveils a hitherto\nunchartered yet fundamental property of SPWs and may bear far-reaching\npractical consequences.\n", "  The nature of insulating phase in 5$d$ based Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is quite debated\nas the theoretical as well as experimental investigations have put forward\nevidences in favor of both magnetically driven Slater-type and interaction\ndriven Mott-type insulator. To understand this insulating behavior, we have\ninvestigated the nature of magnetic state in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ through studying\ncritical exponents, low temperature thermal demagnetization and magnetocaloric\neffect. The estimated critical exponents do not exactly match with any\nuniversality class, however, the values obey the scaling behavior. The exponent\nvalues suggest that spin interaction in present material is close to mean-field\nmodel. The analysis of low temperature thermal demagnetization data, however,\nshows dual presence of localized- and itinerant-type of magnetic interaction.\nMoreover, field dependent change in magnetic entropy indicates magnetic\ninteraction is close to mean-field type. While this material shows an\ninsulating behavior across the magnetic transition, yet a distinct change in\nslope in resistivity is observed around $T_c$. We infer that though the\ninsulating phase in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ more close to be Slater-type but the\nsimultaneous presence of both Slater- and Mott-type is the likely scenario for\nthis material.\n", "  In this work we point out that the apparent diphoton excess initially\npresented by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations could have originated from a\nradion in the bulk Higgs scenario within a warped extra dimension. In this\nscenario the couplings of the radion to massive gauge bosons are suppressed,\nallowing it to evade existing searches. In the presence of mixing with the\nHiggs, due to the strong constraints from diboson searches, only points near\nwhat we denominate the alignment region were able to explain the diphoton\nsignal and evade other experimental constraints. In light of the new\nmeasurements presented at ICHEP 2016 by both LHC collaborations, which do not\nconfirm the initial diphoton excess, we study the current and future collider\nconstraints on a radion within the bulk-Higgs scenario. We find that searches\nin the diphoton channel provide the most powerful probe of this scenario and\nalready exclude large regions of parameter space, particularly for smaller warp\nfactors. The radion has a sizeable branching ratio into top pairs and this\nchannel may also give competitive constraints in the future. Finally, diHiggs\nsearches can provide a complementary probe in the case of non-zero radion-Higgs\nmixing but strong alignment.\n", "  SmB$_6$, a so called Kondo insulator, is recently discussed as a candidate\nmaterial for a strong topological insulator. We present detailed atomically\nresolved topographic information on the (001) surface from more than a dozen\nSmB$_6$ samples. Atomically flat, {\\it in situ} cleaved surfaces often exhibit\nB- and Sm-terminated surfaces as well as reconstructed and non-reconstructed\nareas {\\it coexisting} on different length scales. The terminations are\nunambiguously identified. In addition, electronic inhomogeneities are observed\nwhich likely result from the polar nature of the (001) surface and may indicate\nan inhomogeneous Sm valence at the surface of SmB$_6$. In addition, atomically\nresolved topographies on a (110) surface are discussed.\n", "  For group-living animals, reaching consensus to stay cohesive is crucial for\ntheir fitness, particularly when collective motion starts and stops.\nUnderstanding the decision-making at individual and collective levels upon\nsudden disturbances is central in the study of collective animal behavior, and\nconcerns the broader question of how information is distributed and evaluated\nin groups. Despite the relevance of the problem, well-controlled experimental\nstudies that quantify the collective response of groups facing disruptive\nevents are lacking. Here we study the behavior of groups of uninformed\nindividuals subject to the departure and stop of a trained conspecific within\nsmall-sized groups. We find that the groups reach an effective consensus:\neither all uninformed individuals follow the trained one (and collective motion\noccurs) or none does it. Combining experiments and a simple mathematical model\nwe show that the observed phenomena results from the interplay between simple\nmimetic rules and the characteristic duration of the stimulus, here, the time\nthe trained individual is moving away. The proposed mechanism strongly depends\non group size, as observed in the experiments, and though group splitting can\noccur, the most likely outcome is always a coherent collective group response\n(consensus). The prevalence of a consensus is expected even if the groups of\nnaives face conflicting information, e.g. if groups contain two subgroups of\ntrained individuals, one trained to stay and one trained to leave. Our results\nindicate that collective decision-making and consensus in (small) animal groups\nare likely to be self-organized phenomena that do not involve concertation or\neven communication among the group members.\n", "  As cells grow and divide under a given environment, they become crowded and\nresources are limited, as seen in bacterial biofilms and multicellular\naggregates. These cells often show strong interactions through exchanging\nchemicals, as in quorum sensing, to achieve mutualism. Here, to achieve stable\ndivision of labor, three properties are required. First, isogenous cells\ndifferentiate into several types. Second, this aggregate of distinct cell types\nshows better growth than that of isolated cells, by achieving division of\nlabor. Third, this cell aggregate is robust in the number distribution of\ndifferentiated cell types. We here address how cells acquire the ability of\ncell differentiation and division of labor simultaneously, which is also\nconnected with the robustness of a cell society. For this purpose, we developed\na dynamical-systems model of cells consisting of chemical components with\nintracellular catalytic reaction dynamics. The reactions convert external\nnutrients into internal components for cellular growth, and the divided cells\ninteract via chemical diffusion. We found that cells sharing an identical\ncatalytic network spontaneously differentiate via induction from cell-cell\ninteractions, and then achieve division of labor, enabling a higher growth rate\nthan that in the unicellular case. This symbiotic differentiation emerged for a\nclass of reaction networks with limited resources and strong cell-cell\ninteractions. Then, robustness in the cell type distribution was achieved,\nwhile instability of collective growth could emerge even among the cooperative\ncells when the internal reserves of products were dominant. The present\nmechanism is simple and general as a natural result of interacting cells with\nresource limitation, and is consistent with the observed behaviors and forms of\nseveral aggregates of unicellular organisms.\n", "  Each stage of the human life course is characterized by a distinctive pattern\nof social relations. We study how the intensity and importance of the closest\nsocial contacts vary across the life course, using a large database of mobile\ncommunication from a European country. We first determine the most likely\nsocial relationship type from these mobile phone records by relating the age\nand gender of the caller and recipient to the frequency, length, and direction\nof calls. We then show how communication patterns between parents and children,\nromantic partner, and friends vary across the six main stages of the adult\nfamily life course. Young adulthood is dominated by a gradual shift of call\nactivity from parents to close friends, and then to a romantic partner,\nculminating in the period of early family formation during which the focus is\non the romantic partner. During middle adulthood call patterns suggest a high\ndependence on the parents of the ego, who, presumably often provide\nalloparental care, while at this stage female same-gender friendship also\npeaks. During post-reproductive adulthood, individuals and especially women\nbalance close social contacts among three generations. The age of\ngrandparenthood brings the children entering adulthood and family formation\ninto the focus, and is associated with a realignment of close social contacts\nespecially among women, while the old age is dominated by dependence on their\nchildren.\n", "  A classically scale invariant (CSI) extension of the standard model (SM)\ninduces radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and predicts anomalously large\nHiggs self-interactions. Hence, $W_LW_L$ scattering processes can be a good\nprobe of the symmetry breaking mechanism. We develop a theoretical framework\nfor perturbative computation and calculate $WW$ scattering amplitudes in a CSI\nmodel. It is shown that $W_LW_L$ scattering amplitudes satisfy the equivalence\ntheorem, and that a large deviation of $W_LW_L$ differential cross sections\nfrom the SM predictions is predicted depending on the c.m. energy and\nscattering angle. The results are more accurate than those based on the\neffective-potential approach. A prescription to implement predictions of the\nCSI model to Monte Carlo event generators is also presented.\n", "  To obtain comprehensive performance, heavy elements were added into\nsuperalloys for solid solution hardening. In this article, it is found by\nscanning transmission electron microscope observation that rather than\ndistribute randomly heavy-atom columns prefer to align along <100> and <110>\ndirection and form a short-range ordering with the heavy-element stripes 1-2 nm\nin length. Due to the strong bonding strength between the refractory elements\nand Ni atoms, this short-range ordering will be beneficial to the mechanical\nperformances.\n", "  I give a brief review of the status of research on the nature of initial\nconditions required to obtain a period of cosmological inflation. It is shown\nthat there is good evidence that in the case of large field models, the\ninflationary slow-roll trajectory is a local attractor in initial condition\nspace, whereas it is not in the case of small field models.\n", "  In this paper, the detection efficiency of a large area neutron sensitive\nmicrochannel plate detector has been evaluated. A 6LiF/ZnS detector was\nemployed as the benchmark detector, the TOF spectra of these two detectors were\nsimultaneously measured and the energy spectra were then deduced to calculate\nthe detection efficiency curve of the nMCP detector. Tests show the detection\nefficiency@25.3 meV thermal neutron is 34% for this nMCP detector.\n", "  A new quantum dynamical model has been developed to describe the dissociative\nionization of deuterium molecular ions by intense laser pulses ($\\tau=10$ fs,\n$\\lambda=200$ nm and $I=3\\times10^{13}$ W/cm$^{2}$). We calculated the\nionization probability densities by solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation numerically. Throughout the simulation the nuclear vibration was\nconsidered as a dynamic variable with fixed molecular axis orientation.\nBenchmark calculations were performed for the ionization of\n$\\mathrm{HeH}^{++}$, for which accurate numerical results are available in the\nliterature, in order to check the performance of this new restricted model.\n", "  By studying three-dimensional, radiative, global simulations of\nsub-Eddington, geometrically thin black hole accretion flows we show that thin\ndisks which are dominated by magnetic pressure are stable against thermal\ninstability. Such disks are thicker than predicted by the standard model and\nshow significant amount of dissipation inside the marginally stable orbit.\nRadiation released in this region, however, does not escape to infinity but is\nadvected into the black hole. We find that the resulting accretion efficiency\n($5.5\\pm0.5\\%$ for the simulated $0.8\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$ disk) is very close to\nthe predicted by the standard model ($5.7\\%$).\n", "  Many models and real complex systems possess critical thresholds at which the\nsystems shift from one sate to another. The discovery of the early warnings of\nthe systems in the vicinity of critical point are of great importance to\nestimate how far a system is from a critical threshold. Multifractal Detrended\nFluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) and visibility graph method have been employed to\ninvestigate the fluctuation and geometrical structures of magnetization time\nseries of two-dimensional Ising model around critical point. The Hurst exponent\nhas been confirmed to be a good indicator of phase transition. Increase of the\nmultifractality of the time series have been observed from generalized Hurst\nexponents and singularity spectrum. Both Long-term correlation and broad\nprobability density function are identified to be the sources of\nmultifractality of time series near critical regime. Heterogeneous nature of\nthe networks constructed from magnetization time series have validated the\nfractal properties of magnetization time series from complex network\nperspective. Evolution of the topology quantities such as clustering\ncoefficient, average degree, average shortest path length, density,\nassortativity and heterogeneity serve as early warnings of phase transition.\nThose methods and results can provide new insights about analysis of phase\ntransition problems and can be used as early warnings for various complex\nsystems.\n", "  Surface polaritons, e.g., surface plasmon polaritons, are invaluable tools in\nnanophotonics. However, considerable plasmon loss narrows the application\nregime of plasmonic devices. Here we reveal some general conditions for\nlossless surface polaritons to emerge at the interface of a gain and a loss\nmedia. The gain medium does not only compensate the energy loss, but also\nmodifies surface wave oscillation mechanisms. A new type of surface polaritons\ninduced by the sign switch of the imaginary part of the permittivity across the\ninterface is discovered. The surface polaritons exhibit spin Hall effect due to\nspin-momentum locking and unique Berry phase. The spin Hall coefficient changes\nthe sign across the parity-time symmetric limit and becomes quantized for\nperfect metal-dielectric interface and for dielectric-dielectric interface with\nvery large permittivity contrast, carrying opposite topological numbers. Our\nstudy opens a new direction for manipulating light with surface polaritons in\nnon-Hermitian optical systems.\n", "  We develop a rigid multiblob method for numerically solving the mobility\nproblem for suspensions of passive and active rigid particles of complex shape\nin Stokes flow in unconfined, partially confined, and fully confined\ngeometries. As in a number of existing methods, we discretize rigid bodies\nusing a collection of minimally-resolved spherical blobs constrained to move as\na rigid body, to arrive at a potentially large linear system of equations for\nthe unknown Lagrange multipliers and rigid-body motions. Here we develop a\nblock-diagonal preconditioner for this linear system and show that a standard\nKrylov solver converges in a modest number of iterations that is essentially\nindependent of the number of particles. For unbounded suspensions and\nsuspensions sedimented against a single no-slip boundary, we rely on existing\nanalytical expressions for the Rotne-Prager tensor combined with a fast\nmultipole method or a direct summation on a Graphical Processing Unit to obtain\nan simple yet efficient and scalable implementation. For fully confined\ndomains, such as periodic suspensions or suspensions confined in slit and\nsquare channels, we extend a recently-developed rigid-body immersed boundary\nmethod to suspensions of freely-moving passive or active rigid particles at\nzero Reynolds number. We demonstrate that the iterative solver for the coupled\nfluid and rigid body equations converges in a bounded number of iterations\nregardless of the system size. We optimize a number of parameters in the\niterative solvers and apply our method to a variety of benchmark problems to\ncarefully assess the accuracy of the rigid multiblob approach as a function of\nthe resolution. We also model the dynamics of colloidal particles studied in\nrecent experiments, such as passive boomerangs in a slit channel, as well as a\npair of non-Brownian active nanorods sedimented against a wall.\n", "  We define a planar para algebra, which arises naturally from combining planar\nalgebras with the idea of $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ para symmetry in physics. A\nsubfactor planar para algebra is a Hilbert space representation of planar\ntangles with parafermionic defects, that are invariant under para isotopy. For\neach $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$, we construct a family of subfactor planar para algebras\nwhich play the role of Temperley-Lieb-Jones planar algebras. The first example\nin this family is the parafermion planar para algebra (PAPPA). Based on this\nexample, we introduce parafermion Pauli matrices, quaternion relations, and\nbraided relations for parafermion algebras which one can use in the study of\nquantum information. An important ingredient in planar para algebra theory is\nthe string Fourier transform (SFT), that we use on the matrix algebra generated\nby the Pauli matrices. Two different reflections play an important role in the\ntheory of planar para algebras. One is the adjoint operator; the other is the\nmodular conjugation in Tomita-Takesaki theory. We use the latter one to define\nthe double algebra and to introduce reflection positivity. We give a new and\ngeometric proof of reflection positivity, by relating the two reflections\nthrough the string Fourier transform.\n", "  The classical Ising model on the frustrated 3d swedenborgite lattice has\ndisordered spin liquid ground states for all ratios of inter- and intra-planar\ncouplings. Quantum fluctuations due to a transverse field give rise to several\nexotic quantum phenomena. In the limit of weakly coupled Kagom\\'e layers we\nfind a 3d version of disorder by disorder. For large out-of-plane couplings 1d\nmacro-spins are formed which realize a disordered macro-spin liquid on an\nemerging triangular lattice. Signatures of this dimensional reduction are also\nfound in critical exponents of the quantum phase transition out of the fully\npolarized phase into the macro-spin liquid displaying quantum criticality\ntypical for 2d quantum systems.\n", "  The low-energy muon facility at PSI provides nearly fully polarized positive\nmuons with tunable energies in the keV range to carry out muon spin rotation\n(LE-muSR) experiments with nanometer depth resolution on thin films,\nheterostructures, and near-surface regions. The low-energy muon beam is focused\nand transported to the sample by electrostatic lenses. In order to achieve a\nminimum beam spot size at the sample position and to enable the steering of the\nbeam in the horizontal and vertical direction, a special electrostatic device\nhas been implemented close to the sample position. It consists of a cylinder at\nground potential followed by four conically shaped electrodes, which can be\noperated at different electric potential. In LE-muSR experiments, an electric\nfield at the sample along the beam direction can be applied to\naccelerate/decelerate muons to different energies (0.5-30 keV). Additionally, a\nhorizontal or vertical magnetic field can be superimposed for transverse or\nlongitudinal field muSR experiments. The focusing properties of the conical\nlens in the presence of these additional electric and magnetic fields have been\ninvestigated and optimized by Geant4 simulations. Some experimental tests were\nalso performed and show that the simulation well describes the experimental\nsetup.\n", "  We identify influential early adopters in a social network, where individuals\nare resource constrained, to maximize the spread of multiple, costly behaviors.\nA solution to this problem is especially important for viral marketing. The\nproblem of maximizing influence in a social network is challenging since it is\ncomputationally intractable. We make three contributions. First, propose a new\nmodel of collective behavior that incorporates individual intent, knowledge of\nneighbors actions and resource constraints. Second, we show that the multiple\nbehavior influence maximization is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that the\nproblem is submodular, implying the existence of a greedy solution that\napproximates the optimal solution to within a constant. However, since the\ngreedy algorithm is expensive for large networks, we propose efficient\nheuristics to identify the influential individuals, including heuristics to\nassign behaviors to the different early adopters. We test our approach on\nsynthetic and real-world topologies with excellent results. We evaluate the\neffectiveness under three metrics: unique number of participants, total number\nof active behaviors and network resource utilization. Our heuristics produce\n15-51% increase in expected resource utilization over the naive approach.\n", "  Stimulated emission is the process fundamental to laser operation, thereby\nproducing coherent photon output. Despite negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV$^-$) centres being discussed as a potential laser medium since the 1980's,\nthere have been no definitive observations of stimulated emission from\nensembles of NV$^-$ to date. Reasons for this lack of demonstration include the\nshort excited state lifetime and the occurrence of photo-ionisation to the\nneutral charge state by light around the zero-phonon line. Here we show both\ntheoretical and experimental evidence for stimulated emission from NV$^-$\nstates using light in the phonon-sidebands. Our system uses a continuous wave\npump laser at 532 nm and a pulsed stimulating laser that is swept across the\nphononic sidebands of the NV$^-$. Optimal stimulated emission is demonstrated\nin the vicinity of the three-phonon line at 700 nm. Furthermore, we show the\ntransition from stimulated emission to photoionisation as the stimulating laser\nwavelength is reduced from 700nm to 620 nm. While lasing at the zero-phonon\nline is suppressed by ionisation, our results open the possibility of diamond\nlasers based on NV centres, tuneable over the phonon-sideband. This broadens\nthe applications of NV magnetometers from single centre nanoscale sensors to a\nnew generation of ultra-precise ensemble laser sensors, which exploit the\ncontrast and signal amplification of a lasing system.\n", "  We present a novel algorithm for optimizing the order in which Chinese\ncharacters are learned, one that incorporates the benefits of learning them in\norder of usage frequency and in order of their hierarchal structural\nrelationships. We show that our work outperforms previously published orders\nand algorithms. Our algorithm is applicable to any scheduling task where nodes\nhave intrinsic differences in importance and must be visited in topological\norder.\n", "  Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are basic building blocks for devices such\nas magnetic random access memories (MRAMs). The relevance for modern\ncomputation of non-volatile high-frequency memories makes ac-transport\nmeasurements of MTJs crucial for exploring this regime. Here we demonstrate a\nfrequency-mediated effect in which the tunnel magnetoimpedance reverses its\nsign in a classical Co/Al{_2}O{_3}/NiFe MTJ, whereas we only observe a gradual\ndecrease of tunnel magnetophase. Such effects are explained by the capacitive\ncoupling of a parallel resistor and capacitor in the equivalent circuit model\nof the MTJ. Furthermore, we report a positive tunnel magnetocapacitance effect,\nsuggesting the presence of a spin-capacitance at the two\nferromagnet/tunnel-barrier interfaces. Our results are important for\nunderstanding spin transport phenomena at the high frequency regime, in which\nthe spin-polarized charge accumulation at the two interfaces plays a crucial\nrole.\n", "  The generally accepted view that spin polarization is induced by the\nasymmetry of the global crystal space group has limited the search for\nspintronics [1] materials to non-centrosymmetric materials. Recently it has\nbeen suggested that spin polarization originates fundamentally from local\natomic site asymmetries [2], and therefore centrosymmetric materials may\nexhibit previously overlooked spin polarizations. Here by using spin- and\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (spin-ARPES), we report helical spin\ntexture induced by local Rashba effect (R-2) in centrosymmetric monolayer\nPtSe$_2$ film. First-principles calculations and effective analytical model\nsupport the spin-layer locking picture: in contrast to the spin splitting in\nconventional Rashba effect (R-1), the opposite spin polarizations induced by\nR-2 are degenerate in energy while spatially separated in the top and bottom Se\nlayers. These results not only enrich our understanding of spin polarization\nphysics, but also may find applications in electrically tunable spintronics.\n", "  For any finite link $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ we prove the existence of a\nhigh-energy complex-valued eigenfunction of the hydrogen atom such that its\nnodal set contains a union of connected components diffeomorphic to $L$. This\nproblem goes back to Berry, who constructed such eigenfunctions in the case\nwhere $L$ is the trefoil knot or the Hopf link and asked the question about the\ngeneral result.\n", "  We studied the superconducting (SC) state depletion process in an electron\ndoped cuprate Pr$_{1.85}$Ce$_{0.15}$CuO$_{4-\\delta}$ by pumping with\nnear-infrared (NIR) and narrow-band THz pulses. When pumping with THz pulses\ntuned just above the SC gap, we find the absorbed energy density required to\ndeplete superconductivity, $A_{dep}$, matches the thermodynamic condensation\nenergy. Contrary, by NIR pumping $A_{dep}$ is an order of magnitude higher,\ndespite the fact that the SC gap is much smaller than the energy of relevant\nbosonic excitations. The result implies that only a small subset of bosons\ncontribute to pairing.\n", "  We present the first full release of a survey of the 150 MHz radio sky,\nobserved with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope between April 2010 and March\n2012 as part of the TGSS project. Aimed at producing a reliable compact source\nsurvey, our automated data reduction pipeline efficiently processed more than\n2000 hours of observations with minimal human interaction. Through application\nof innovative techniques such as image-based flagging, direction-dependent\ncalibration of ionospheric phase errors, correcting for systematic offsets in\nantenna pointing, and improving the primary beam model, we created good quality\nimages for over 95 percent of the 5336 pointings. Our data release covers\n36,900 square degrees (or 3.6 pi steradians) of the sky between -53 deg and +90\ndeg DEC, which is 90 percent of the total sky. The majority of pointing images\nhave a background RMS noise below 5 mJy/beam with an approximate resolution of\n25\" x 25\" (or 25\" x 25\" / cos (DEC - 19 deg) for pointings south of 19 deg\nDEC). We have produced a catalog of 0.62 Million radio sources derived from an\ninitial, high reliability source extraction at the 7 sigma level. For the bulk\nof the survey, the measured overall astrometric accuracy is better than 2\" in\nRA and DEC, while the flux density accuracy is estimated at ~10 percent. Within\nthe scope of the TGSS ADR project, the source catalog as well as 5336 mosaic\nimages (5 deg x 5 deg) and an image cutout service, are made publicly available\nonline as a service to the astronomical community. Next to enabling a wide\nrange of different scientific investigations, we anticipate that these survey\nproducts provide a solid reference for various new low-frequency radio aperture\narray telescopes (LOFAR, LWA, MWA, SKA-low), and can play an important role in\ncharacterizing the EoR foreground. The TGSS ADR project aims at continuously\nimproving the quality of the survey data products.\n", "  We present a novel automatic adaptive aperture photometry algorithm for\nmeasuring the total magnitudes of merging galaxies with irregular shapes.\nFirst, we use a morphological pattern recognition routine for identifying the\nshape of an irregular source in a background-subtracted image. Then, we extend\nthe shape of the source by using the Dilation image operation to obtain an\naperture that is quasi-homomorphic to the shape of the irregular source. The\nmagnitude measured from the homomorphic aperture would thus have minimal\ncontamination from the nearby background. As a test of our algorithm, we\napplied our technique to the merging galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). Our results\nsuggest that the adaptive homomorphic aperture algorithm can be very useful for\ninvestigating extended sources with irregular shapes and sources in crowded\nregions.\n", "  The issue of the stability of Pickering emulsions is tackled at a mesoscopic\nlevel using dissipative particle dynamics simulations within the Adiabatic\nBiased Molecular Dynamics framework. We consider the early stage of the\ncoalescence process between two spherical water droplets in decane solvent. The\ndroplets are stabilized by Janus nanoparticles of different shapes (spherical\nand ellipsoidal) with different three-phase contact angles. Given a\nsufficiently dense layer of particles on the droplets, we show that the\nstabilization mechanism strongly depends on the collision speed. This is\nconsistent with a coalescence mechanism governed by the rheology of the\ninterfacial region. When the system is forced to coalesce sufficiently slowly,\nwe investigate at a mesoscopic level how the ability of the nanoparticles to\nstabilize Pickering emulsions is discriminated by nanoparticle mobility and the\nassociated caging effect. These properties are both related to the\ninterparticle interaction and the hydrodynamic resistance in the liquid film\nbetween the approaching interfaces.\n", "  We demonstrate that photonic lanterns based on tapered multicore fibres\nprovide an efficient way to couple multimode states of light to a\ntwo-dimensional array of Single-Photon Avalanche Detectors (SPADs), each of\nwhich has its own Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) for Time-Correlated\nSingle-Photon-Counting (TCSPC). Exploiting this capability, we demonstrate\nmultiplexed single-mode wavelength-to-time conversion of multimode states of\nlight using a multicore-fibre photonic lantern with 121 single-mode cores,\ncoupled in a one-to-one fashion to 121 SPADS on a 32 $\\times$ 32 pixel CMOS\nSPAD array. The application of photonic lanterns for coupling multimode light\nto SPAD arrays in this manner may find wide-ranging applications in areas such\nas Raman spectroscopy, coherent LIDAR and quantum optics.\n", "  Pairs of neurons in brain networks often share much of the input they receive\nfrom other neurons. Due to essential non-linearities of neuronal dynamics, the\nconsequences for the correlation of the output spike trains are not well\nunderstood in the strongly correlated regime. Here we consider two leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons with correlated white noise input. We analyze this\nscenario using a novel non-perturbative approach. Hence our treatment covers\nboth weakly and strongly correlated dynamics, generalizing previous results\nbased on linear response theory.\n", "  We study a system of dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice\nusing exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods.\nIn particular, we analyze low energy properties of the system at an average\nfilling of 3/2 atoms per lattice site. We identify the region of the parameter\nspace where the system has non-Abelian Fibonacci anyon excitations that\ncorrespond to fractional domain walls between different charge-density-waves.\nWhen such one-dimensional systems are combined into a two-dimensional network,\nbraiding of Fibonacci anyon excitations has potential application for fault\ntolerant, universal, topological quantum computation. Contrary to previous\ncalculations, our results also demonstrate that super-solid phases are not\npresent in the phase diagram for the discussed 3/2 average filling. Instead,\ndecreasing the value of the nearest-neighbor tunneling strength leads to a\ndirect, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, super-fluid to charge-density-wave\nquantum phase transition.\n", "  With the R$^{3}$B-LAND setup at GSI we have measured exclusive\nrelative-energy spectra of the Coulomb dissociation of $^{18}$C at a projectile\nenergy around 425~AMeV on a lead target, which are needed to determine the\nradiative neutron-capture cross sections of $^{17}$C into the ground state of\n$^{18}$C. Those data have been used to constrain theoretical calculations for\ntransitions populating excited states in $^{18}$C. This allowed to derive the\nastrophysical cross section $\\sigma^{*}_{\\mathrm{n}\\gamma}$ accounting for the\nthermal population of $^{17}$C target states in astrophysical scenarios. The\nexperimentally verified capture rate is significantly lower than those of\npreviously obtained Hauser-Feshbach estimations at temperatures\n$T_{9}\\leq{}1$~GK. Network simulations with updated neutron-capture rates and\nhydrodynamics according to the neutrino-driven wind model as well as the\nneutron-star merger scenario reveal no pronounced influence of neutron capture\nof $^{17}$C on the production of second- and third-peak elements in contrast to\nearlier sensitivity studies.\n", "  We use effective field theory (EFT) formalism to forecast the constraint on\nHorndeski class of dark energy models with future supernova and galaxy surveys.\nPreviously (Gleyzes {\\it et al.}) computed unmarginalized constraints (68\\% CL\nerror $\\sim 10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$) on EFT dark energy parameters by fixing all\nother parameters. We extend the previous work by allowing all cosmological\nparameters and nuisance parameters to vary and marginalizing over them. We find\nthat (i) the constraints on EFT dark energy parameters are typically worsen by\na factor of few after marginalization, and (ii) the constraint on the dark\nenergy equation of state $w$ is not significantly affected by the inclusion of\nEFT dark energy parameters.\n", "  The collimation of a Poynting-flux dominated jet by a wind emanating from the\nsurface of an accretion flow is computed using a semi-analytic model. The\ninjection of the disk wind is treated as a boundary condition in the equatorial\nplane, and its evolution is followed by invoking a prescribed geometry of\nstreamlines. Solutions are obtained for a wide range of disk wind parameters.\nIt is found that jet collimation generally occurs when the total wind power\nexceeds about ten percents of the jet power. For moderate wind powers we find\ngradual collimation. For strong winds we find rapid collimation followed by\nfocusing of the jet, after which it remains narrow over many Alfv\\'en crossing\ntimes before becoming conical. We estimate that in the later case the jet's\nmagnetic field may be dissipated by the current-driven kink instability over a\ndistance of a few hundreds gravitational radii. We apply the model to M87 and\nshow that the observed parabolic shape of the radio jet within the Bondi radius\ncan be reproduced provided that the wind injection zone extends to several\nhundreds gravitational radii, and that its total power is about one third of\nthe jet power. The radio spectrum can be produced by synchrotron radiation of\nrelativistically hot, thermal electrons in the sheath flow surrounding the\ninner jet.\n", "  The low energy electronic structure of LaFeAsO1-xHx (0.0 < x < 0.60), the\nsystem which exhibits two superconducting domes in its phase diagram, is\ninvestigated by utilizing the laser photoemission spectroscopy. From the\nprecise temperature-dependent measurement of the spectra near the Fermi level,\nwe find the suppression of the density of states with cooling, namely the\npseudogap formation, for all doping range. The pseudogap in the low x range\n(i.e. the first superconducting dome regime) gets suppressed with increasing x,\nmore or less similarly to the previous results in F-doped LaFeAsO system. On\nthe other hand, the pseudogap behavior in the second superconducting dome\nregime at high-x becomes stronger with increasing the H-doping level. The\nsystematic doping dependence shows that the pseudogap is enhanced toward the\nboth ends of the phase diagram where the different types of antiferromagnetic\norder exist.\n", "  Chemical evolution models are powerful tools for interpreting stellar\nabundance surveys and understanding galaxy evolution. However, their\npredictions depend heavily on the treatment of inflow, outflow, star formation\nefficiency (SFE), the stellar initial mass function, the Type Ia supernova\ndelay time distribution, stellar yields, and stellar population mixing. Using\nflexCE, a flexible one-zone chemical evolution code, we investigate the effects\nof and trade-offs between parameters. Two critical parameters are SFE and the\noutflow mass-loading parameter, which shift the knee in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] and the\nequilibrium abundances that the simulations asymptotically approach,\nrespectively. One-zone models with simple star formation histories follow\nnarrow tracks in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] unlike the observed bimodality (separate\nhigh-alpha and low-alpha sequences) in this plane. A mix of one-zone models\nwith inflow timescale and outflow mass-loading parameter variations, motivated\nby the inside-out galaxy formation scenario with radial mixing, reproduces the\ntwo sequences better than a one-zone model with two infall epochs. We present\n[X/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks for 20 elements assuming three different supernova yield\nmodels and find some significant discrepancies with solar neighborhood\nobservations, especially for elements with strongly metallicity-dependent\nyields. We apply principal component abundance analysis (PCAA) to the\nsimulations and existing data to reveal the main correlations amongst\nabundances and quantify their contributions to variation in abundance space.\nFor the stellar population mixing scenario, the abundances of alpha-elements\nand elements with metallicity-dependent yields dominate the first and second\nprincipal components, respectively, and collectively explain 99% of the\nvariance in the model. flexCE is a python package available at\nhttps://github.com/bretthandrews/flexCE.\n", "  We present spatial correlations of galaxies and IGM HI in the\nCOSMOS/UltraVISTA 1.62 deg$^2$ field. Our data consist of 13,415 photo-$z$\ngalaxies at $z\\sim2-3$ with $K_s<23.4$ and the Ly$\\alpha$ forest absorptions in\nthe background quasar spectra selected from SDSS data with no signature of\ndamped Ly$\\alpha$ system contamination. We estimate a galaxy overdensity\n$\\delta_{gal}$ in an impact parameter of 2.5 pMpc, and calculate the Ly$\\alpha$\nforest fluctuations $\\delta_{\\langle F\\rangle}$ whose negative values\ncorrespond to the strong Ly$\\alpha$ forest absorptions. We identify weak\nevidence of an anti-correlation between $\\delta_{gal}$ and $\\delta_{\\langle\nF\\rangle}$ with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of $-0.39$ suggesting\nthat the galaxy overdensities and the Ly$\\alpha$ forest absorptions positively\ncorrelate in space at the $\\sim90\\%$ confidence level. This positive\ncorrelation indicates that high-$z$ galaxies exist around an excess of HI gas\nin the Ly$\\alpha$ forest. We find four cosmic volumes, dubbed\n$A_{obs}$-$D_{obs}$, that have extremely large (small) values of $\\delta_{gal}\n\\simeq0.8$ ($-1$) and $\\delta_{\\langle F\\rangle}$ $\\simeq0.1$ ($-0.4$), three\nout of which, $B_{obs}$-$D_{obs}$, significantly depart from the correlation,\nand weaken the correlation signal. We perform cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations, and compare with our observational results. Our simulations\nreproduce the correlation, agreeing with the observational results. Moreover,\nour simulations have model counterparts of $A_{obs}$-$D_{obs}$, and suggest\nthat the observations pinpoint, by chance, a galaxy overdensity like a\nproto-cluster, gas filaments lying on the sightline, a large void, and\northogonal low-density filaments. Our simulations indicate that the significant\ndepartures of $B_{obs}$-$D_{obs}$ are produced by the filamentary large-scale\nstructures and the observation sightline effects.\n", "  This article reviews the concept of Lorentz invariant relative velocity that\nis often misunderstood or unknown in high energy physics literature. The\nproperties of the relative velocity allow to formulate the invariant flux and\ncross section without recurring to non--physical velocities or any assumption\nabout the reference frame. Applications such as the luminosity of a collider,\nthe use as kinematic variable, and the statistical theory of collisions in a\nrelativistic classical gas are reviewed. It is emphasized how the hyperbolic\nproperties of the velocity space explain the peculiarities of relativistic\nscattering.\n", "  We propose here a specific criterion to address the existence or otherwise of\nKerr naked singularities, in terms of the precession of the spin of a test\ngyroscope due to the frame dragging by the central spinning body. We show that\nthere is indeed an important characteristic difference in the behavior of gyro\nspin precession frequency in the limit of approach to these compact objects,\nand this can be used, in principle, to differentiate the naked singularity from\nblack hole. Specifically, if gyroscopes are fixed all along the polar axis upto\nthe horizon of a Kerr black hole, the precession frequency becomes arbitrarily\nhigh, blowing up as the event horizon is approached. On the other hand, in the\ncase of naked singularity, this frequency remains always finite and\nwell-behaved. Interestingly, this behavior is intimately related to and is\ngoverned by the geometry of the ergoregion in each of these cases which we\nanalyze here. One intriguing behavior that emerges is, in the Kerr naked\nsingularity case, the Lense-Thirring precession frequency ($\\Omega_{\\rm LT}$)\nof the gyroscope due to frame-dragging effect decreases as ($\\Omega_{\\rm\nLT}\\propto r$) after reaching a maximum, in the limit of $r= 0$, as opposed to\n$r^{-3}$ dependence in all other known astrophysical cases.\n", "  This paper investigates the recent stellar merger transient M31LRN 2015 in\nthe Andromeda galaxy. We analyze published optical photometry and spectroscopy\nalong with a Hubble Space Telescope detection of the color and magnitude of the\npre-outburst source. The transient outburst is consistent with dynamically\ndriven ejecta at the onset of a common envelope episode, which eventually leads\nto the complete merger of a binary system. The light curve appears to contain\ntwo components: first $\\sim10^{-2} M_\\odot$ of fast ejecta driven by shocks at\nthe onset of common envelope, and later, $\\sim0.3 M_\\odot$ of further ejecta as\nthe secondary becomes more deeply engulfed within the primary. Just prior to\nmerger, we find that the primary star is a $3-5.5 M_\\odot$ sub-giant branch\nprimary star with radius of $30-40R_\\odot$. Its position in the color-magnitude\ndiagram shows that it is growing in radius, consistent with a picture where it\nengulfs its companion. By matching the properties of the primary star to the\ntransient outburst, we show that the optical transient lasts less than ten\norbits of the original binary, which had a pre-merger period of $\\sim 10$ days.\nWe consider the possible orbital dynamics leading up to the merger, and argue\nthat if the system merged due to the Darwin tidal instability it implies a\nlower mass main sequence companion of $0.1-0.6M_\\odot$. This analysis\nrepresents a promising step toward a more detailed understanding of flows in\ncommon envelope episodes through direct observational constraints.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a universal concept throughout science. For\ninstance, the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm of translational symmetry breaking\nunderlies the classification of nearly all quantum phases of matter and\nexplains the emergence of crystals, insulators, and superconductors. Usually,\nthe consequences of translational invariance are studied in large systems to\nsuppress edge effects which cause undesired symmetry breaking. While this\napproach works for investigating global properties, studies of local\nobservables and their correlations require access and control of the individual\nconstituents. Periodic boundary conditions, on the other hand, could allow for\ntranslational symmetry in small systems where single particle control is\nachievable. Here, we crystallize up to fifteen 40Ca+ ions in a microscopic ring\nwith inherent periodic boundary conditions. We show the ring's translational\nsymmetry is preserved at millikelvin temperatures by delocalizing the Doppler\nlaser cooled ions. This establishes an upper bound for undesired symmetry\nbreaking at a level where quantum control becomes feasible. These findings pave\nthe way towards studying quantum many-body physics with translational symmetry\nat the single particle level in a variety of disciplines from simulation of\nHawking radiation to exploration of quantum phase transitions.\n", "  An autoionizing resonance in molecular N$_2$ is excited by an ultrashort XUV\npulse and probed by a subsequent weak IR pulse, which ionizes the contributing\nRydberg states. Time- and angular-resolved photoelectron spectra recorded with\na velocity map imaging spectrometer reveal two electronic contributions with\ndifferent angular distributions. One of them has an exponential decay rate of\n$20\\pm5$ fs, while the other one is shorter than 10 fs. This observation is\ninterpreted as a manifestation of interference stabilization involving the two\noverlapping discrete Rydberg states. A formalism of interference stabilization\nfor molecular ionization is developed and applied to describe the autoionizing\nresonance. The results of calculations reveal, that the effect of the\ninterference stabilization is facilitated by rotationally-induced couplings of\nelectronic states with different symmetry.\n", "  We are interested in the connection between a metastable continuous state\nspace Markov process (satisfying e.g. the Langevin or overdamped Langevin\nequation) and a jump Markov process in a discrete state space. More precisely,\nwe use the notion of quasi-stationary distribution within a metastable state\nfor the continuous state space Markov process to parametrize the exit event\nfrom the state. This approach is useful to analyze and justify methods which\nuse the jump Markov process underlying a metastable dynamics as a support to\nefficiently sample the state-to-state dynamics (accelerated dynamics\ntechniques). Moreover, it is possible by this approach to quantify the error on\nthe exit event when the parametrization of the jump Markov model is based on\nthe Eyring-Kramers formula. This therefore provides a mathematical framework to\njustify the use of transition state theory and the Eyring-Kramers formula to\nbuild kinetic Monte Carlo or Markov state models.\n", "  Non-invasive functional imaging of molecular and cellular processes of vision\nis expected to have immense impact on research and clinical diagnostics.\nAlthough suitable intrinsic optical signals (IOS) have been observed ex vivo\nand in immobilized animals in vivo, it was so far not possible to obtain\nconvincing IOS of photoreceptor activity in humans in vivo. Here, we observed\nspatially and temporally clearly resolved changes in the optical path length of\nthe photoreceptor outer segment as response to an optical stimulus in living\nhuman. To obtain these changes, we evaluated phase data of a parallelized and\ncomputationally aberration-corrected optical coherence tomography (OCT) system.\nThe non-invasive detection of optical path length changes shows the neuronal\nphotoreceptor activity of single cones in living human retina, and, more\nimportantly, it provides a new diagnostic option in ophthalmology and neurology\nand could give new insights into visual phototransduction in humans.\n", "  Several `giant' Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) nebulae with extent $\\gtrsim\n300\\,$kpc and observed Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity of $\\gtrsim 10^{44}\\,{\\rm\nerg}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}\\,{\\rm arcsec}^{-2}$ have recently been\ndetected, and it has been speculated that their presence hints at a substantial\ncold gas reservoir in small cool clumps not resolved in modern hydro-dynamical\nsimulations. We use the Illustris simulation to predict the Ly$\\alpha$ emission\nemerging from large halos ($M > 10^{11.5}M_{\\odot}$) at $z\\sim 2$ and thus test\nthis model. We consider both AGN and star driven ionization, and compare the\nsimulated surface brightness maps, profiles and Ly$\\alpha$ spectra to a model\nwhere most gas is clumped below the simulation resolution scale. We find that\nwith Illustris no additional clumping is necessary to explain the extents,\nluminosities and surface brightness profiles of the `giant Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae'\nobserved. Furthermore, the maximal extents of the objects show a wide spread\nfor a given luminosity and do not correlate significantly with any halo\nproperties. We also show how the detected size depends strongly on the employed\nsurface brightness cutoff, and predict that further such objects will be found\nin the near future.\n", "  Even the simplest of animals exhibit behavioral sequences with complex\ntemporal dynamics. Prominent amongst the proposed organizing principles for\nthese dynamics has been the idea of a hierarchy, wherein the movements an\nanimal makes can be understood as a set of nested sub-clusters. Although this\ntype of organization holds potential advantages in terms of motion control and\nneural circuitry, measurements demonstrating this for an animal's entire\nbehavioral repertoire have been limited in scope and temporal complexity. Here,\nwe use a recently developed unsupervised technique to discover and track the\noccurrence of all stereotyped behaviors performed by fruit flies moving in a\nshallow arena. Calculating the optimally predictive representation of the fly's\nfuture behaviors, we show that fly behavior exhibits multiple time scales and\nis organized into a hierarchical structure that is indicative of its underlying\nbehavioral programs and its changing internal states.\n", "  The phantom brane has several important distinctive features: (i) Its\nequation of state is phantom-like, but there is no future `big rip'\nsingularity, (ii) the effective cosmological constant on the brane is\ndynamically screened, because of which the expansion rate is {\\em smaller} than\nthat in $\\Lambda$CDM at high redshifts. In this paper, we constrain the Phantom\nbraneworld using distance measures such as Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the compressed Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) data. We find that the simplest braneworld models provide a good fit to\nthe data. For instance, BAO +SNeIa data can be accommodated by the braneworld\nfor a large region in parameter space $0 < \\Omega_l < 0.3$ at $1\\sigma$. The\nHubble parameter can be as high as $H_0 < 78$ km/s/Mpc, and the effective\nequation of state at present can show phantom-like behaviour with $w_0 < -1.2$\nat $1\\sigma$. We note a correlation between $H_0$ and $w_0$, with higher values\nof $H_0$ leading to a lower, and more phantom-like, value of $w_0$. Inclusion\nof CMB data provides tighter constraints $\\Omega_l < 0.1$. (Here $\\Omega_l$\nencodes the ratio of the five and four dimensional Planck mass.) The Hubble\nparameter in this case is more tightly constrained to $H_0 < 71$ km/s/Mpc, and\nthe effective equation of state to $w_0 < -1.1$. Interestingly, we find that\nthe universe is allowed be closed or open, with $-0.5 < \\Omega_{\\kappa} < 0.5$,\neven on including the compressed CMB data. There appears to be some tension in\nthe low and high $z$ BAO data which may either be resolved by future data, or\nact as a pointer to interesting new cosmology.\n", "  Early results concerning the shape and stability of ion acoustic waves are\ngeneralized to propagation at an angle to the magnetic field lines. Each wave\nhas a critical angle for stability. Known soliton results are recovered as\nspecial cases. A historical overview of the problem concludes the paper.\n", "  We calculate the Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate for an atom in\nfront of a nonreciprocal medium by using macroscopic quantum electrodynamics.\nThe results are a generalization of the respective quantities for matter with\nbroken time-reversal symmetry which does not fulfill the Lorentz reciprocity\nprinciple. As examples, we contrast the decay rates, the resonant and\nnonresonant frequency shifts of a perfectly conducting (reciprocal) mirror to\nthose of a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror. We find different power\nlaws for the distance dependence of all quantities in the retarded and\nnonretarded limits. As an example of a more realistic nonreciprocal medium, we\ninvestigate a topological insulator subject to a time-symmetry breaking\nperturbation.\n", "  Horizons are classical causal structures that arise in systems with sharply\ndefined energy and corresponding gravitational radius. A global gravitational\nradius operator can be introduced for a static and spherically symmetric\nquantum mechanical matter state by lifting the classical \"Hamiltonian\"\nconstraint that relates the gravitational radius to the ADM mass, thus giving\nrise to a \"horizon wave-function\". This minisuperspace-like formalism is shown\nhere to be able to consistently describe also the local gravitational radius\nrelated to the Misner-Sharp mass function of the quantum source, provided its\nenergy spectrum is determine by spatially localised modes.\n", "  Li$_2$RuO$_3$ is known to crystallize in either $C2/m$ or $P2_1/m$ structures\nat room temperature. We report the first single crystal growth of Li$_2$RuO$_3$\nand Na substituted crystals (Li$_{0.95}$Na$_{0.05}$)$_{2}$RuO$_3$ crystallizing\nin the $P2_1/m$ structure where a magneto-structural transition is observed at\nhigh temperatures. Using high temperature ($T \\leq 1000$~K) magnetic\nsusceptibility $\\chi$ measurements we study the magnetic anisotropy across the\nmagneto-structural transition. Our results show for the first time that for\nLi$_2$RuO$_3$ the magnetic and structural transitions most likely occur at\nslightly different temperatures. The structural transition which is first\norder-like occurs first ($T \\approx 570$~K) and drives the magnetic transition\n($T \\approx 540$~K). Rather surprisingly, just $5\\%$ Na substitution for Li\naffects the magneto-structural transition in an interesting way. The first\norder transition temperature stays $\\approx 540$~K, the magnetic anisotropy is\nreversed, and the Ru-Ru dimerization pattern changes from two short and four\nlong Ru-Ru bonds per honeycomb in an armchair pattern for Li$_2$RuO$_3$ to four\nshort and two long bonds per honeycomb in (Li$_{0.95}$Na$_{0.05}$)$_{2}$RuO$_3$\nwhich can be viewed as two inter-penetrating armchair patterns.\n", "  The experimental realization of many-body entangled states is one of the main\ngoals of quantum technology as these states are a key resource for quantum\ncomputation and quantum sensing. However, increasing the number of photons in\nan entangled state has been proved to be a painstakingly hard task. This is a\nresult of the non-deterministic emission of current photon sources and the\ndistinguishability between photons from different sources. Moreover, the\ngeneration rate and the complexity of the optical setups hinder scalability.\nHere we present a new scheme that is compact, requires a very modest amount of\ncomponents, and avoids the distinguishability issues by using only one\nsingle-photon source. States of any number of photons are generated with the\nsame configuration, with no need for increasing the optical setup. The basic\noperation of this scheme is experimentally demonstrated and its sensitivity to\nimperfections is considered.\n", "  The theory of finite-size scaling explains how the singular behavior of\nthermodynamic quantities in the critical point of a phase transition emerges\nwhen the size of the system becomes infinite. Usually, this theory is presented\nin a phenomenological way. Here, we exactly demonstrate the existence of a\nfinite-size scaling law for the Galton-Watson branching processes when the\nnumber of offsprings of each individual follows either a geometric distribution\nor a generalized geometric distribution. We also derive the corrections to\nscaling and the limits of validity of the finite-size scaling law away the\ncritical point. A mapping between branching processes and random walks allows\nus to establish that these results also hold for the latter case, for which the\norder parameter turns out to be the probability of hitting a distant boundary.\n", "  For the recently introduced isotropic relaxed micromorphic generalized\ncontinuum model, we show that under the assumption of positive definite energy,\nplanar harmonic waves have real velocity. We also obtain a necessary and\nsufficient condition for real wave velocity which is weaker than\npositive-definiteness of the energy. Connections to isotropic linear elasticity\nand micropolar elasticity are established. Notably, we show that strong\nellipticity does not imply real wave velocity in micropolar elasticity, while\nit does in isotropic linear elasticity.\n", "  Topological semimetals recently stimulate intense research activities.\nCombining first-principles calculations and effective model analysis, we\npredict that CaTe is topological node-line semimetal when spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) is ignored. We also obtain the nearly flat surface state which has the\ndrumhead characteristic. When SOC is included, three node lines evolve into a\npair of Dirac points along the $M-R$ line. These Dirac points are robust and\nprotected by $C_{4}$ rotation symmetry. Once this crystal symmetry is broken,\nthe Dirac points will be eliminated, and the system becomes a strong\ntopological insulator.\n", "  We show how an excess in the diphoton channel can be the effect of neither a\nresonance nor an end-point in a cascade decay, but rather of a threshold for\nvirtual production of a pair of extra quarks, each with half of peak invariant\nmass, onsetting in both the $gg$-initiated production and the\n$\\gamma\\gamma$-induced decay of an off-shell $Z$ boson. For our analysis we\nconsider as paradigmatic example the 750 GeV excess previously seen at the end\nof 2015 with the Run 2 data of the LHC but not confirmed with 2016 data.\n", "  Microscopically controlled neutral atoms in optical tweezers and lattices\nhave led to exciting advances in the study of quantum information and quantum\nmany-body systems. The light shifts of atomic levels from the trapping\npotential in these systems can result in detrimental effects such as\nfluctuating dipole force heating, inhomogeneous detunings, and inhibition of\nlaser cooling, which limits the atomic species that can be manipulated. In\nparticular, these light shifts can be large enough to prevent loading into\noptical tweezers directly from a magneto-optical trap. We present a general\nsolution to these limitations by loading, cooling, and imaging single atoms\nwith temporally alternating beams. Because this technique does not depend on\nany specific spectral properties, we expect it to enable the optical tweezer\nmethod to control nearly any atomic or molecular species that can be laser\ncooled and optically trapped. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the role\nof heating and required cooling for single atom tweezer loading.\n", "  Shear thickening, an increase of viscosity with shear rate, is a ubiquitous\nphenomena in suspended materials that has implications for broad technological\napplications. Controlling this thickening behavior remains a major challenge\nand has led to empirical strategies ranging from altering the particle surfaces\nand shape to modifying the solvent properties. However, none of these methods\nallow for tuning of flow properties during shear itself. Here, we demonstrate\nthat by strategic imposition of a high-frequency and low-amplitude shear\nperturbation orthogonal to the primary shearing flow, we can largely eradicate\nshear thickening. The orthogonal shear effectively becomes a regulator for\ncontrolling thickening in the suspension, allowing the viscosity to be reduced\nby up to two decades on demand. In a separate setup, we show that such effects\ncan be induced by simply agitating the sample transversely to the primary shear\ndirection. Overall, the ability of in situ manipulation of shear thickening\npaves a route towards creating materials whose mechanical properties can be\ncontrolled.\n", "  The explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae has not been fully\nunderstood yet but multi-dimensional fluid instabilities such as standing\naccretion shock instability (SASI) and convection are now believed to be\ncrucial for shock revival. Another multi-dimensional effect that has been\nrecently argued is the asymmetric structures in progenitors, which are induced\nby violent convections in silicon/oxygen layers that occur before the onset of\ncollapse, as revealed by recent numerical simulations of the last stage of\nmassive star evolutions. Furthermore, it has been also demonstrated numerically\nthat accretions of such non-spherical envelopes could facilitate shock revival.\nThese two multi-dimensional may hence hold a key to successful explosions. In\nthis paper, we performed a linear stability analysis of the standing accretion\nshock in core-collapse supernovae, taking into account non-spherical, unsteady\naccretion flows onto the shock to clarify the possible links between the two\neffects. We found that such pre-shock perturbations can excite the fluid\ninstabilities efficiently and hence help the shock revive in core-collapse\nsupernovae.\n", "  In this paper, we characterize major depression (MD) as a complex dynamical\nsystem in which symptoms (e.g., insomnia and fatigue) are directly connected to\none another in a network structure. We hypothesize that individuals can be\ncharacterized by their own network with unique architecture and resulting\ndynamics. With respect to architecture, we show that individuals vulnerable to\ndeveloping MD are those with strong connections between symptoms: e.g., only\none night of poor sleep suffices to make a particular person feel tired. Such\nvulnerable networks, when pushed by forces external to the system such as\nstress, are more likely to end up in a depressed state; whereas networks with\nweaker connections tend to remain in or return to a healthy state. We show this\nwith a simulation in which we model the probability of a symptom becoming\nactive as a logistic function of the activity of its neighboring symptoms.\nAdditionally, we show that this model potentially explains some well-known\nempirical phenomena such as spontaneous recovery as well as accommodates\nexisting theories about the various subtypes of MD. To our knowledge, we offer\nthe first intra-individual, symptom-based, process model with the potential to\nexplain the pathogenesis and maintenance of major depression.\n", "  We propose a simple statistical model of three-dimensionally anisotropic,\nintermittent, strong Alfv\\'enic turbulence, incorporating both critical balance\nand dynamic alignment. Our model is based on log-Poisson statistics for\nElsasser-field increments along the magnetic field. We predict the scalings of\nElsasser-field conditional two-point structure functions with point separations\nin all three directions in a coordinate system locally aligned with the\ndirection of the magnetic field and of the fluctuating fields and obtain good\nagreement with numerical simulations. We also derive a scaling of the parallel\ncoherence scale of the fluctuations, $l_\\parallel \\propto \\lambda^{1/2}$, where\n$\\lambda$ is the perpendicular scale. This is indeed observed for the bulk of\nthe fluctuations in numerical simulations.\n", "  We revisit the inflationary dynamics in detail for theories with Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity coupled to scalar functions, in light of the Planck data. Considering\nthe chaotic inflationary scenario, we constrain the parameters of two models\ninvolving inflaton-Gauss-Bonnet coupling by current Planck data. For non zero\ninflaton-Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\\beta$, an inflationary analysis provides us a\nbig cosmologically viable region in the space of $(m,\\beta)$, where $m$ is the\nmass of inflaton. However, we study further on constraining $\\beta$ arising\nfrom reheating considerations and unitarity of tree-level amplitude involving\nwe have studied the constraints on $\\beta$ arising from reheating\nconsiderations and unitarity of tree level amplitude involving $2$ graviton\n$\\rightarrow 2$ graviton ($h h\\rightarrow hh$) scattering. Our analysis,\nparticularly on reheating significantly reduces the parameter space of\n$(m,\\beta)$ for all models. he quadratic Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter turns\nout to be more strongly constrained than that of the linear coupling. For the\nlinear Gauss-Bonnet coupling function, we obtain $\\beta \\lesssim 10^3$, with\nthe condition $\\beta (m/M_P)^2 \\simeq 10^{-4}$. However, study of the Higgs\ninflation scenario in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet term turned out to be\nstrongly disfavored.\n", "  The easy access to large data sets has allowed for leveraging methodology in\nnetwork physics and complexity science to disentangle patterns and processes\ndirectly from the data, leading to key insights in the behavior of systems.\nHere we use to country specific food production data to study binary and\nweighted topological properties of the bipartite country-food production\nmatrix. This country-food production matrix can be: 1) transformed into overlap\nmatrices which embed information regarding shared production of products among\ncountries, and or shared countries for individual products, 2) identify subsets\nof countries which produce similar commodities or subsets of commodities shared\nby a given country allowing for visualization of correlations in large\nnetworks, and 3) used to rank country's fitness (the ability to produce a\ndiverse array of products weighted on the type of food commodities) and food\nspecialization (quantified on the number of countries producing that food\nproduct weighted on their fitness). Our results show that, on average,\ncountries with high fitness producing highly specialized food commodities also\nproduce low specialization goods, while nations with low fitness producing a\nsmall basket of diverse food products, typically produce low specialized food\ncommodities.\n", "  Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) both\ninhabit galactic nuclei, coexisting in a range of bulge masses, but excluding\neach other in the largest or smallest galaxies. We propose that the\ntransformation of NSCs into SMBHs occurs via runaway tidal captures, once NSCs\nexceed a certain critical central density and velocity dispersion. The\nbottleneck in this process, as with all collisional runaways, is growing the\nfirst e-fold in black hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past\nthis bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are consumed in repeated\nepisodes of mass transfer at pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a\ngrowth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but\ntidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed\nSMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed\nSMBH consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the cosmic mass\ndensity in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by\nepisodic gaseous accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have\nprobably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars. SMBH seeds that\ngrow for a time $t$ entirely through this channel will follow simple power law\nrelations with the velocity dispersion, $\\sigma$, of their host galaxy. In the\nsimplest regime it is $M_\\bullet \\sim \\sigma^{3/2}\\sqrt{M_\\star t / G} \\sim\n10^{6}M_\\odot (\\sigma / 50~{\\rm km~s}^{-1})^{3/2}(t/10^{10}~{\\rm yr})^{1/2}$,\nbut the exponents and prefactor can differ slightly depending on the details of\nloss cone refilling. Current tidal disruption event rates predicted from this\nmechanism are consistent with observations.\n", "  A numerical-relativity calculation yields in general a solution of the\nEinstein equations including also a radiative part, which is in practice\ncomputed in a region of finite extent. Since gravitational radiation is\nproperly defined only at null infinity and in an appropriate coordinate system,\nthe accurate estimation of the emitted gravitational waves represents an old\nand non-trivial problem in numerical relativity. A number of methods have been\ndeveloped over the years to \"extract\" the radiative part of the solution from a\nnumerical simulation and these include: quadrupole formulas, gauge-invariant\nmetric perturbations, Weyl scalars, and characteristic extraction. We review\nand discuss each method, in terms of both its theoretical background as well as\nits implementation. Finally, we provide a brief comparison of the various\nmethods in terms of their inherent advantages and disadvantages.\n", "  Binary systems of two compact objects circularize and spiral toward each\nother via the emission of gravitational waves. The coupling of the spins of\neach object with the orbital angular momentum causes the orbital plane to\nprecess, which leads to modulation of the gravitational wave signal. Until now,\ngenerating frequency-domain waveforms for fully precessing systems for use in\ngravitational wave data analysis meant numerically integrating the equations of\nmotion, then Fourier transforming the result, which is very computationally\nintensive for systems that complete hundreds or thousands of cycles in the\nsensitive band of a detector. Previously, analytic solutions were only\navailable for certain special cases or for simplified models. Here we describe\nthe construction of closed-form, frequency-domain waveforms for\nfully-precessing, quasi-circular binary inspirals.\n", "  Inspired by the recent proposal of soft hair on black holes in Phys. Rev.\nLett. 116, 231301 (2016), we have shown that an isolated horizon carries soft\nhairs implanted by electromagnetic fields. The solution space and the\nasymptotic symmetries of Einstein-Maxwell theory have been worked out\nexplicitly near isolated horizon. The conserved current has been computed and\nan infinite number of near horizon charges have been introduced from the\nelectromagnetic fields associated to the asymptotic $U(1)$ symmetry near the\nhorizon, which indicates the fact that isolated horizon carries a large amount\nof soft electric hairs. The soft electric hairs, i.e. asymptotic $U(1)$\ncharges, are shown to be equivalent to the electric multipole moments of\nisolated horizons. It is further argued that the isolated horizon\nsupertranslation is from the ambiguity of its foliation and an analogue of\nmemory effect on horizon can be expected.\n", "  We present exact kinematic consistency relations for cosmological structures\nthat do not vanish at equal times and can thus be measured in surveys. These\nrely on cross-correlations between the density and velocity, or momentum,\nfields. Indeed, the uniform transport of small-scale structures by long\nwavelength modes, which cannot be detected at equal times by looking at density\ncorrelations only, gives rise to a shift in the amplitude of the velocity field\nthat could be measured. These consistency relations only rely on the weak\nequivalence principle and Gaussian initial conditions. They remain valid in the\nnon-linear regime and for biased galaxy fields. They can be used to constrain\nnon-standard cosmological scenarios or the large-scale galaxy bias.\n", "  Context. The intensity profiles of iron and oxygen in Solar Energetic\nParticle (SEP) events often display differences that result in a decreasing\nFe/O ratio over time. The physical mechanisms behind this behaviour are not\nfully understood, but these observational signatures provide important tests of\nphysical modelling efforts. Aims. In this paper we study the propagation of\niron and oxygen SEP ions using a 3D model of propagation which includes the\neffect of guiding centre drift in a Parker spiral magnetic field. We derive\ntime intensity profiles for a variety of observer locations and study the\ntemporal evolution of the Fe/O ratio. Methods. We use a 3D full orbit test\nparticle model which includes scattering. The configuration of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field is a unipolar Parker spiral. Particles are\nreleased instantaneously from a compact region at 2 solar radii and allowed to\npropagate in 3D. Results. Both Fe and O experience significant transport across\nthe magnetic field due to gradient and curvature drifts. We find that Fe ions\ndrift more than O ions due to their larger mass-to-charge ratio, so that an\nobserver that is not magnetically well connected to the source region will\nobserve Fe arriving before O, for particles within the same range in energy per\nnucleon. As a result, for the majority of observer locations, the Fe/O ratio\ndisplays a decrease in time. Conclusions. We conclude that propagation effects\nassociated with drifts produce a decay over time of the Fe/O ratio,\nqualitatively reproducing that observed in SEP event profiles.\n", "  The tagging of on-line content with informative keywords is a widespread\nphenomenon from scientific article repositories through blogs to on-line news\nportals. In most of the cases, the tags on a given item are free words chosen\nby the authors independently. Therefore, relations among keywords in a\ncollection of news items is unknown. However, in most cases the topics and\nconcepts described by these keywords are forming a latent hierarchy, with the\nmore general topics and categories at the top, and more specialised ones at the\nbottom. Here we apply a recent, cooccurrence-based tag hierarchy extraction\nmethod to sets of keywords obtained from four different on-line news portals.\nThe resulting hierarchies show substantial differences not just in the topics\nrendered as important (being at the top of the hierarchy) or of less interest\n(categorised low in the hierarchy), but also in the underlying network\nstructure. This reveals discrepancies between the plausible keyword association\nframeworks in the studied news portals.\n", "  We propose and experimentally test a method to fabricate patterns of steep,\nsharp features on surfaces, by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of uniformly\nion bombarded surfaces. We show via theory, simulation, and experiment, that\nthe steepest parts of the surface evolve as one-dimensional curves which move\nin the normal direction at constant velocity. The curves are a special solution\nto the nonlinear equations that arises spontaneously whenever the initial\npatterning on the surface contains slopes larger than a critical value;\nmathematically they are traveling waves (shocks) that have the special property\nof being undercompressive. We derive the evolution equation for the curves by\nconsidering long-wavelength perturbations to the one-dimensional traveling\nwave, using the unusual boundary conditions required for an undercompressive\nshock, and we show this equation accurately describes the evolution of shapes\non surfaces, both in simulations and in experiments. Because evolving a\ncollection of one-dimensional curves is fast, this equation gives a\ncomputationally efficient and intuitive method for solving the inverse problem\nof finding the initial surface so the evolution leads to a desired target\npattern. We illustrate this method by solving for the initial surface that will\nproduce a lattice of diamonds connected by steep, sharp ridges, and\nexperimentally demonstrating the evolution of the initial surface into the\ntarget pattern.\n", "  We use idealized 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the dynamics and\nthermal structure of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Our simulations quantify\nthe role of cooling, stellar feedback driven galactic winds and cosmological\ngas accretion in setting the properties of the CGM in dark matter haloes\nranging from $10^{11}$ to $10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$. Our simulations support a\nconceptual picture in which the properties of the CGM, and the key physics\ngoverning it, change markedly near a critical halo mass of M$_{\\rm crit}\n\\approx 10^{11.5}$ M$_\\odot$. As in calculations without stellar feedback,\nabove M$_{\\rm crit}$ halo gas is supported by thermal pressure created in the\nvirial shock. The thermal properties at small radii are regulated by feedback\ntriggered when $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}\\lesssim10$ in the hot gas. Below\nM$_{\\rm crit}$, however, there is no thermally supported halo and\nself-regulation at $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}\\sim10$ does not apply. Instead, the\ngas is out of hydrostatic equilibrium and largely supported against gravity by\nbulk flows (turbulence and coherent inflow/outflow) arising from the\ninteraction between cosmological gas inflow and outflowing galactic winds. In\nthese lower mass haloes, the phase structure depends sensitively on the\noutflows' energy per unit mass and mass-loading, which may allow measurements\nof the CGM thermal state to constrain the nature of galactic winds. Our\nsimulations account for some of the properties of the multiphase halo gas\ninferred from quasar absorption line observations, including the presence of\nsignificant mass at a wide range of temperatures, and the characteristic OVI\nand CIV column densities and kinematics. However, we underpredict the neutral\nhydrogen content of the $z\\sim0$ CGM.\n", "  We provide a concise review on multi-field inflation and cosmological\nperturbations. We discuss convenient and physically meaningful bases in terms\nof which perturbations can be systematically studied. We give formal accounts\non the gauge fixing conditions and present the perturbation action in two\ngauges. We also briefly review non-linear perturbations.\n", "  We present commuting projector Hamiltonian realizations of a large class of\n(3+1)D topological models based on mathematical objects called unitary\nG-crossed braided fusion categories. This construction comes with a wealth of\nexamples from the literature of symmetry-enriched topological phases. The\nspacetime counterparts to our Hamiltonians are unitary state sum topological\nquantum fields theories (TQFTs) that appear to capture all known constructions\nin the literature, including the Crane-Yetter-Walker-Wang and 2-Group gauge\ntheory models. We also present Hamiltonian realizations of a state sum TQFT\nrecently constructed by Kashaev whose relation to existing models was\npreviously unknown. We argue that this TQFT is captured as a special case of\nthe Crane-Yetter-Walker-Wang model, with a premodular input category in some\ninstances.\n", "  In this paper we preform a systematic study of the tau flavored dark matter\nmodel by introducing two kinds of mediators (a scalar doublet and a charged\nscalar singlet). The electromagnetic properties of the dark matter, as well as\ntheir implications in dark matter direct detections, are analyzed in detail.\nThe model turns out contributing a significant radiative correction to the tau\nlepton mass, in addition to loosing the tension between the measured dark\nmatter relic density and constraints of dark matter direct detections. The loop\ncorrections can be ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$ of the total tau mass. Signal rates of the\nHiggs measurements from the LHC in the $h\\to\\tau \\tau$ and $h\\to \\gamma \\gamma$\nchannels, relative to the Standard Model expectations, can be explained in this\nmodel.\n", "  This paper estimates local tornado risk from records of past events using\nstatistical models. First, a spatial model is fit to the tornado counts\naggregated in counties with terms that control for changes in observational\npractices over time. Results provide a long-term view of risk that delineates\nthe main tornado corridors in the United States where the expected annual rate\nexceeds two tornadoes per 10,000 square km. A few counties in the Texas\nPanhandle and central Kansas have annual rates that exceed four tornadoes per\n10,000 square km. Refitting the model after removing the least damaging\ntornadoes from the data (EF0) produces a similar map but with the greatest\ntornado risk shifted south and eastward. Second, a space-time model is fit to\nthe counts aggregated in raster cells with terms that control for changes in\nclimate factors. Results provide a short-term view of risk. The short-term view\nidentifies the shift of tornado activity away from the Ohio Valley under El\nNi\\~no conditions and away from the Southeast under positive North Atlantic\noscillation conditions. The combined predictor effects on the local rates is\nquantified by fitting the model after leaving out the year to be predicted from\nthe data. The models provide state-of-the-art views of tornado risk that can be\nused by government agencies, the insurance industry, and the general public.\n", "  The work extends the linear fields' solution of compressible nonlinear\nmagnetohydrodynamics~(MHD) to the case where the magnetic field depends on\nsuperlinear powers of position vector, usually but not always, expressed in\nCartesian components. Implications of the resulting Lie-Taylor series expansion\nfor physical applicability of the Dolzhansky-Kirchhoff~(D-K) equations are\nfound to be positive. It is demonstrated how resistivity may be included in the\nD-K model. Arguments are put forward that the D-K equations may be regarded as\nillustrating properties of nonlinear MHD in the same sense that the Lorenz\nequations inform about the onset of convective turbulence. It is suggested that\nthe Lie-Taylor series approach may lead to valuable insights into other fluid\nmodels.\n", "  Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR) successfully describes gravity.\nThe most fundamental predictions of GR are black holes (BHs), but in spite of\nmany convincing BH candidates in the Universe, there is no conclusive\nexperimental proof of their existence using astronomical observations in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. Are BHs real astrophysical objects? Does GR hold in\nits most extreme limit or are alternatives needed? The prime target to address\nthese fundamental questions is in the center of our own Galaxy, which hosts the\nclosest and best-constrained supermassive BH candidate in the Universe,\nSagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Three different types of experiments hold the promise\nto test GR in a strong-field regime using observations of Sgr A* with\nnew-generation instruments. The first experiment aims to image the relativistic\nplasma emission which surrounds the event horizon and forms a \"shadow\" cast\nagainst the background, whose predicted size (~50 microarcseconds) can now be\nresolved by upcoming VLBI experiments at mm-waves such as the Event Horizon\nTelescope (EHT). The second experiment aims to monitor stars orbiting Sgr A*\nwith the upcoming near-infrared interferometer GRAVITY at the Very Large\nTelescope (VLT). The third experiment aims to time a radio pulsar in tight\norbit about Sgr A* using radio telescopes (including the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array or ALMA). The BlackHoleCam project exploits the synergy\nbetween these three different techniques and aims to measure the main BH\nparameters with sufficient precision to provide fundamental tests of GR and\nprobe the spacetime around a BH in any metric theory of gravity. Here, we\nreview our current knowledge of the physical properties of Sgr A* as well as\nthe current status of such experimental efforts towards imaging the event\nhorizon, measuring stellar orbits, and timing pulsars around Sgr A*.\n", "  A recent granular rheology based on an implicit `granular fluidity' field has\nbeen shown to quantitatively predict many nonlocal phenomena. However, the\nphysical nature of the field has not been identified. Here, the granular\nfluidity is found to be a kinematic variable given by the velocity fluctuation\nand packing fraction. This is verified with many discrete element simulations,\nwhich show the operational fluidity definition, solutions of the fluidity\nmodel, and the proposed microscopic formula all agree. Kinetic theoretical and\nEyring-like explanations shed insight into the obtained form.\n", "  Nowadays is very common to find headlines in the media where it is stated\nthat 3D printing is a technology called to change our lives in the near future.\nFor many authors, we are living in times of a third industrial revolution.\nHowerver, we are currently in a stage of development where the use of 3D\nprinting is advantageous over other manufacturing technologies only in rare\nscenarios. Fortunately, scientific research is one of them. Here we present the\ndevelopment of a set of opto-mechanical components that can be built easily\nusing a 3D printer based on Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and parts that can\nbe found on any hardware store. The components of the set presented here are\nhighly customizable, low-cost, require a short time to be fabricated and offer\na performance that compares favorably with respect to low-end commercial\nalternatives.\n", "  Would a raindrop impacting on a coarse beach behave differently from that\nimpacting on a desert of fine sand? We study this question by a series of model\nexperiments, where the packing density of the granular target, the wettability\nof individual grains, the grain size, the impacting liquid, and the impact\nspeed are varied. We find that by increasing the grain size and/or the\nwettability of individual grains the maximum droplet spreading undergoes a\ntransition from a capillary regime towards a viscous regime, and splashing is\nsuppressed. The liquid-grain mixing is discovered to be the underlying\nmechanism. An effective viscosity is defined accordingly to quantitatively\nexplain the observations.\n", "  Using deep Hubble Frontier Fields imaging and slitless spectroscopy from the\nGrism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space, we analyze 2200 cluster and 1748 field\ngalaxies at $0.2\\leq z\\leq0.7$ to determine the impact of environment on galaxy\nsize and structure at $\\log M_*/M_\\odot>7.8$, an unprecedented limit at these\nredshifts. Based on simple assumptions-$r_e=f(M_*)$-we find no significant\ndifferences in half-light radii ($r_e$) between equal-mass cluster or field\nsystems. More complex analyses-$r_e=f(M_*,U-V,n,z,\\Sigma$)-reveal local density\n$(\\Sigma$) to induce only a $7\\% \\pm 3\\%$ ($95\\%$ confidence) reduction in\n$r_e$ beyond what can be accounted for by $U-V$ color, Sersic index ($n$), and\nredshift ($z$) effects.Almost any size difference between galaxies in high- and\nlow-density regions is thus attributable to their different distributions in\nproperties other than environment. Indeed, we find a clear color-$r_e$\ncorrelation in low-mass passive cluster galaxies ($\\log M_*/M_\\odot<9.8$) such\nthat bluer systems have larger radii, with the bluest having sizes consistent\nwith equal-mass star-forming galaxies. We take this as evidence that\nlarge-$r_e$ low-mass passive cluster galaxies are recently acquired systems\nthat have been environmentally quenched without significant structural\ntransformation (e.g., by ram pressure stripping or starvation).Conversely,\n$\\sim20\\%$ of small-$r_e$ low-mass passive cluster galaxies appear to have been\nin place since $z\\sim3$. Given the consistency of the small-$r_e$ galaxies'\nstellar surface densities (and even colors) with those of systems more than ten\ntimes as massive, our findings suggest that clusters mark places where galaxy\nevolution is accelerated for an ancient base population spanning most masses,\nwith late-time additions quenched by environment-specific mechanisms are mainly\nrestricted to the lowest masses.\n", "  We examine the effect that the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor has on the\nlarge-scale expansion of space. This is done within the context of a class of\ncosmological models that contain regularly arranged discrete masses, rather\nthan a continuous perfect fluid. The natural set of geodesic curves that one\nshould use to consider the cosmological expansion of these models requires the\nexistence of a non-zero magnetic part of the Weyl tensor. We include this\nobject in the evolution equations of these models by performing a Taylor series\nexpansion about a hypersurface where it initially vanishes. At the same\ncosmological time, measured as a fraction of the age of the universe, we find\nthat the influence of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor increases as the\nnumber of masses in the universe is increased. We also find that the influence\nof the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor increases with time, relative to the\nleading-order electric part, so that its contribution to the scale of the\nuniverse can reach values of ~1%, before the Taylor series approximation starts\nto break down.\n", "  Background: Symmetries are a powerful way to characterize nuclear wave\nfunctions. A true dynamical symmetry, where the Hamiltonian is block-diagonal\nin subspaces defined by the group, is rare. More likely is a quasidynamical\nsymmetry: states with different quantum numbers (i.e. angular momentum)\nnonetheless sharing similar group-theoretical decompositions. Purpose: We use\ngroup-theoretical decomposition to investigate backbending, an abrupt change in\nthe moment of inertia along the yrast line, in $^{48,49,50}$Cr: prior\nmean-field calculations of these nuclides suggest a change from strongly\nprolate to more spherical configurations as one crosses the backbending and\nincreases in angular momentum. Methods: We decompose configuration-interaction\nshell-model wavefunctions using the SU(2) groups $L$ (total orbital angular\nmomentum) and $S$ (total spin), and the groups SU(3) and SU(4). We do not need\na special basis but only matrix elements of Casimir operators, applied with a\nmodified Lanczos algorithm. Results: We find quasidynamical symmetries, albeit\noften of a different character above and below the backbending, for each group.\nWhile the strongest evolution was in SU(3), the decompositions did not suggest\na decrease in deformation. We point out with a simple example that mean-field\nand SU(3) configurations may give very different pictures of deformation.\nConclusions: Persistent quasidynamical symmetries for several groups allow us\nto identify the members of a band and to characterize how they evolve with\nincreasing angular momentum, especially before and after backbending.\n", "  We consider K-mouflage models which are K-essence theories coupled to matter.\nWe analyse their quantum properties and in particular the quantum corrections\nto the classical Lagrangian. We setup the renormalisation programme for these\nmodels and show that K-mouflage theories involve a recursive construction\nwhereby each set of counter-terms introduces new divergent quantum\ncontributions which in turn must be subtracted by new counter-terms. This tower\nof counter-terms can be constructed by recursion and allows one to calculate\nthe finite renormalised action of the model. In particular, the classical\naction is not renormalised and the finite corrections to the renormalised\naction contain only higher derivative operators. We establish an operational\ncriterion for classicality, where the corrections to the classical action are\nnegligible, and show that this is satisfied in cosmological and astrophysical\nsituations for (healthy) K-mouflage models which pass the solar system tests.\nWe also find that these models are quantum stable around astrophysical and\ncosmological backgrounds. We then consider the possible embedding of the\nK-mouflage models in an Ultra-Violet completion. We find that the healthy\nmodels which pass the solar system tests all violate the positivity constraint\nwhich would follow from the unitarity of the putative UV completion, implying\nthat these healthy K-mouflage theories have no UV completion. We then analyse\ntheir behaviour at high energy and we find that the classicality criterion is\nsatisfied in the vicinity of a high energy collision implying that the\nclassical K-mouflage theory can be applied in this context. Moreover, the\nclassical description becomes more accurate as the energy increases, in a way\ncompatible with the classicalisation concept.\n", "  We describe an ultrafast coherent control of the transient structural\ndistortion arising from nonlinear phononics in ErFeO$_3$. Using density\nfunctional theory, we calculate the structural properties as input to an\nanharmonic phonon model that describes the response of the system to a pulsed\noptical excitation. We find that the trilinear coupling of two orthogonal\ninfrared-active phonons to a Raman-active phonon causes a transient distortion\nof the lattice. The direction of the distortion is determined by the\npolarization of the exciting light, suggesting a route to nonlinear phononic\nlattice control and switching. Since the occurrence of the coupling is\ndetermined by the symmetry of the system we propose that it is a universal\nfeature of orthorhombic and tetragonal perovskites.\n", "  Local and global scaling solutions for $O(N)$ symmetric scalar field theories\nare studied in the complexified field plane with the help of the\nrenormalisation group. Using expansions of the effective action about small,\nlarge, and purely imaginary fields, we obtain and solve exact recursion\nrelations for all couplings and determine the $3d$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point\nanalytically. For all $O(N)$ universality classes, we further establish that\nWilson-Fisher fixed point solutions display singularities in the complex field\nplane, which dictate the radius of convergence for real-field expansions of the\neffective action. At infinite $N$, we find closed expressions for the\nconvergence-limiting singularities and prove that local expansions of the\neffective action are powerful enough to uniquely determine the global\nWilson-Fisher fixed point for any value of the fields. Implications of our\nfindings for interacting fixed points in more complicated theories are\nindicated.\n", "  We study the dynamics of entanglement in the extended cluster spin-1/2 XX\nchain, equivalent to a 1D spin-1/2 XX model with three-spin interaction (TSI).\nSelecting the nearest neighbor pair spins as an open quantum system, the rest\nof the chain plays the role of environment. The two-spin Heisenberg and the TSI\ninteraction are responsible for coupling between system and environment. We\nshow the existence of a critical value in the TSI, where the dynamics of\nconcurrence changes from Markovian to the non-Markovian. In the region with the\nnon-Markovian dynamics, entanglement sudden death in the system is observed. By\nfocusing on the nearest neighbor pair spins of the environment, we have showed\nthat the dynamics of entanglement in the environment is sensitive to the\nMarkovian and non-Markovian regions.\n", "  In Keplerian accretion disks, turbulence and magnetic fields may be jointly\nexcited through a subcritical dynamo process involving the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI). High-resolution simulations exhibit a tendency towards\nstatistical self-organization of MRI dynamo turbulence into large-scale cyclic\ndynamics. Understanding the physical origin of these structures, and whether\nthey can be sustained and transport angular momentum efficiently in\nastrophysical conditions, represents a significant theoretical challenge. The\ndiscovery of simple periodic nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions has recently proven\nuseful in this respect, and has notably served to highlight the role of\nturbulent magnetic diffusion in the seeming decay of the dynamics at low\nmagnetic Prandtl number Pm (magnetic diffusivity larger than viscosity), a\ncommon regime in accretion disks. The connection between these simple\nstructures and the statistical organization reported in turbulent simulations\nremained elusive, though. Here, we report the numerical discovery in moderate\naspect ratio Keplerian shearing boxes of new periodic, incompressible,\nthree-dimensional nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions with a larger dynamical\ncomplexity reminiscent of such simulations. These \"chimera\" cycles are\ncharacterized by multiple MRI-unstable dynamical stages, but their basic\nphysical principles of self-sustainment are nevertheless identical to those of\nsimpler cycles found in azimuthally elongated boxes. In particular, we find\nthat they are not sustained at low Pm either due to subcritical turbulent\nmagnetic diffusion. These solutions offer a new perspective into the transition\nfrom laminar to turbulent instability-driven dynamos, and may prove useful to\ndevise improved statistical models of turbulent accretion disk dynamos.\n", "  We report on the production of a stable mixture of bosonic and fermionic\nsuperfluids composed of the elements $^{174}$Yb and $^6$Li which feature a\nstrong mismatch in mass and distinct electronic properties. We demonstrate\nelastic coupling between the superfluids by observing the shift in dipole\noscillation frequency of the bosonic component due to the presence of the\nfermions. The measured magnitude of the shift is consistent with a mean-field\nmodel and its direction determines the previously unknown sign of the\ninterspecies scattering length to be positive. We also observe the exchange of\nangular momentum between the superfluids from the excitation of a scissors mode\nin the bosonic component through interspecies interactions. We explain this\nobservation using an analytical model based on superfluid hydrodynamics.\n", "  The inefficiency of star formation in massive elliptical galaxies is widely\nbelieved to be caused by the interactions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nwith the surrounding gas. Achieving a sufficiently rapid reddening of\nmoderately massive galaxies without expelling too many baryons has however\nproven difficult for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, prompting\nus to explore a new model for the accretion and feedback effects of\nsupermassive black holes. For high accretion rates relative to the Eddington\nlimit, we assume that a fraction of the accreted rest mass energy heats the\nsurrounding gas thermally, similar to the `quasar mode' in previous work. For\nlow accretion rates, we invoke a new, pure kinetic feedback model which imparts\nmomentum into the surrounding gas in a stochastic manner. These two modes of\nfeedback are motivated both by theoretical conjectures for the existence of\ndifferent types of accretion flows as well as recent observational evidence for\nthe importance of kinetic AGN winds in quenching galaxies. We find that a large\nfraction of the injected kinetic energy in this mode thermalises via shocks in\nthe surrounding gas, thereby providing a distributed heating channel. In\ncosmological simulations, the resulting model produces red, non star-forming\nmassive elliptical galaxies, and achieves realistic gas fractions, black hole\ngrowth histories and thermodynamic profiles in large haloes.\n", "  Recent experiments using innovative optical detectors and techniques have\nstrongly increased the capacity of testing the violation of the Bell's\ninequalities in the Nature. Most of them have used the Eberhardt's inequality\n(EI) to close the \"detection\" loophole. Closing the \"locality\" loophole has\nbeen attempted by space-like separated detections and fast and random changes\nin the setting of the bases of observation. Also, pulsed pumping and time\nstamped data to close the \"time-coincidence\" loophole, and sophisticated\nstatistical methods to close the \"memory\" loophole, have been used. In this\npaper, the meaning of the EI is reviewed. A simple hidden-variables theory\nbased on a relaxation of the condition of \"measurement independence\", which was\ndevised long ago for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony and Holt inequality, is adapted\nto the EI case. It is used here to evaluate the significance of the results of\nthe new experiments, which are briefly described. A Table summarizes the main\nresults.\n", "  We present optical spectra of the nearby Type Ia supernova SN 2011fe at 100,\n205, 311, 349, and 578 days post-maximum light, as well as an ultraviolet\nspectrum obtained with Hubble Space Telescope at 360 days post-maximum light.\nWe compare these observations with synthetic spectra produced with the\nradiative transfer code PHOENIX. The day +100 spectrum can be well fit with\nmodels which neglect collisional and radiative data for forbidden lines.\nCuriously, including this data and recomputing the fit yields a quite similar\nspectrum, but with different combinations of lines forming some of the stronger\nfeatures. At day +205 and later epochs, forbidden lines dominate much of the\noptical spectrum formation; however, our results indicate that recombination,\nnot collisional excitation, is the most influential physical process driving\nspectrum formation at these late times. Consequently, our synthetic optical and\nUV spectra at all epochs presented here are formed almost exclusively through\nrecombination-driven fluorescence. Furthermore, our models suggest that the\nultraviolet spectrum even as late as day +360 is optically thick and consists\nof permitted lines from several iron-peak species. These results indicate that\nthe transition to the \"nebular\" phase in Type Ia supernovae is complex and\nhighly wavelength-dependent.\n", "  This Feature Article presents an overview of the current status of Ring\nPolymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD) rate theory. We first analyze the RPMD\napproach and its connection to quantum transition-state theory. We then focus\non its practical applications to prototypical chemical reactions in the gas\nphase, which demonstrate how accurate and reliable RPMD is for calculating\nthermal chemical reaction rate coefficients in multifarious cases. This review\nserves as an important checkpoint in RPMD rate theory development, which shows\nthat RPMD is shifting from being just one of recent novel ideas to a\nwell-established and validated alternative to conventional techniques for\ncalculating thermal chemical rate coefficients. We also hope it will motivate\nfurther applications of RPMD to various chemical reactions.\n", "  Shear banding and stick-slip instabilities have been long observed in sheared\ngranular materials. Yet, their microscopic underpinnings, interdependencies and\nvariability under different loading conditions have not been fully explored.\nHere, we use a non-equilibrium thermodynamics model, the Shear Transformation\nZone theory, to investigate the dynamics of strain localization and its\nconnection to stability of sliding in sheared, dry, granular materials. We\nconsider frictional and frictionless grains as well as presence and absence of\nacoustic vibrations. Our results suggest that at low and intermediate strain\nrates, persistent shear bands develop only in the absence of vibrations.\nVibrations tend to fluidize the granular network and de-localize slip at these\nrates. Stick-slip is only observed for frictional grains and it is confined to\nthe shear band. At high strain rates, stick-slip disappears and the different\nsystems exhibit similar stress-slip response. Changing the vibration intensity,\nduration or time of application alters the system response and may cause\nlong-lasting rheological changes. We analyse these observations in terms of\npossible transitions between rate strengthening and rate weakening response\nfacilitated by a competition between shear induced dilation and vibration\ninduced compaction. We discuss the implications of our results on dynamic\ntriggering, quiescence and strength evolution in gouge filled fault zones.\n", "  We study the statistical properties of helicity in direct numerical\nsimulations of fully developed homogeneous and isotropic turbulence and in a\nclass of turbulence shell models. We consider correlation functions based on\ncombinations of vorticity and velocity increments that are not invariant under\nmirror symmetry. We also study the scaling properties of high-order structure\nfunctions based on the moments of the velocity increments projected on a subset\nof modes with either positive or negative helicity (chirality). We show that\nmirror symmetry is recovered at small-scales, i.e., chiral terms are subleading\nand they are well captured by a dimensional argument plus anomalous\ncorrections. These findings are also supported by a high Reynolds numbers study\nof helical shell models with the same chiral symmetry of Navier-Stokes\nequations.\n", "  Of late there has been a surge of interest in localised phonon polariton\nresonators which allow for sub-diffraction confinement of light in the\nmid-infrared spectral region by coupling to optical phonons at the surface of\npolar dielectrics. Resonators are generally etched on deep substrates which\nsupport propagative surface phonon polariton resonances. Recent experimental\nwork has shown that understanding the coupling between localised and\npropagative surface phonon polaritons in these systems is vital to correctly\ndescribe the system resonances. In this paper we comprehensively investigate\nresonators composed of arrays of cylindrical SiC resonators on SiC substrates.\nOur bottom-up approach, starting from the resonances of single, free standing\ncylinders and isolated substrates, and exploiting both numerical and analytical\ntechniques, allows us to develop a consistent understanding of the parameter\nspace of those resonators, putting on firmer ground this blossoming technology.\n", "  We present novel constraints on cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy using\nthe recent precise measurements of proton and helium spectra from AMS-02,\ntogether with preliminary AMS-02 data on the antiproton over proton ratio. To\nexplore efficiently the large (up to eleven-dimensional) parameter space we\nemploy the nested-sampling algorithm as implemented in the \\textsc{MultiNest}\npackage, interfaced with the \\textsc{Galprop} code to compute the\nmodel-predicted spectra. We use VOYAGER proton and helium data, sampling the\nlocal inter-stellar spectra, to constrain the solar modulation potential. We\nfind that the turbulence of the Galactic magnetic field is well constrained,\ni.e., $\\delta=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}(stat)^{+0.10}_{-0.04}(sys)$, with\nuncertainties dominated by systematic effects. Systematic uncertainties are\ndetermined checking the robustness of the results to the minimum rigidity cut\nused to fit the data (from 1 GV to 5 GV), to the propagation scenario\n(convection vs no-convection), and to the uncertainties in the knowledge of the\nantiproton production cross section. Convection and reaccelaration are found to\nbe degenerate and not well-constrained singularly when using data above 5 GV.\nUsing data above 1 GV reacceleration is required, $v_{\\rm A}=25\\pm2$km/s,\nalthough this value might be significantly affected by the low energy\nsystematic uncertainty in the solar modulation. In a forthcoming companion\npaper, we investigate the constraints imposed by AMS-02 measurements on\nlithium, boron, and carbon.\n", "  We construct operators for simulating the scattering of two hadrons with spin\non the lattice. Three methods are shown to give the consistent operators for\nPN, PV, VN and NN scattering, where P, V and N denote pseudoscalar, vector and\nnucleon. Explicit expressions for operators are given for all irreducible\nrepresentations at lowest two relative momenta. Each hadron has a good helicity\nin the first method. The hadrons are in a certain partial wave L with total\nspin S in the second method. These enable the physics interpretations of the\noperators obtained from the general projection method. The correct\ntransformation properties of the operators in all three methods are proven. The\ntotal momentum of two hadrons is restricted to zero since parity is a good\nquantum number in this case.\n", "  Transient chaos is a characteristic behavior in nonlinear dynamics where\ntrajectories in a certain region of phase space behave chaotically for a while,\nbefore escaping to an external attractor. In some situations the escapes are\nhighly undesirable, so that it would be necessary to avoid such a situation. In\nthis paper we apply a control method known as partial control that allows one\nto prevent the escapes of the trajectories to the external attractors, keeping\nthe trajectories in the chaotic region forever. To illustrate how the method\nworks, we have chosen the Lorenz system for a choice of parameters where\ntransient chaos appears, as a paradigmatic example in nonlinear dynamics. We\nanalyze three quite different ways to implement the method. First, we apply\nthis method by building a 1D map using the successive maxima of one of the\nvariables. Next, we implement it by building a 2D map through a Poincar\\'{e}\nsection. Finally, we built a 3D map, which has the advantage of using a fixed\ntime interval between application of the control, which can be useful for\npractical applications.\n", "  Clusters of galaxies have the potential of providing powerful constraints on\npossible deviations from General Relativity. We use the catalogue of\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich sources detected by Planck and consider a correction to the\nhalo mass function for a f(R) class of modified gravity models, which has been\nrecently found to reproduce well results from N-body simulations, to place\nconstraints on the scalaron field amplitude at the present time, $f_{R}^0$. We\nfind that applying this correction to different calibrations of the halo mass\nfunction produces upper bounds on $f_{R}^0$ tighter by more than an order of\nmagnitude, ranging from $\\log_{10}(-f_{R}^0) < -5.81$ to $\\log_{10}(-f_{R}^0) <\n-4.40$ (95 % confidence level). This sensitivity is due to the different shape\nof the halo mass function, which is degenerate with the parameters used to\ncalibrate the scaling relations between SZ observables and cluster masses. Any\nclaim of constraints more stringent that the weaker limit above, based on\ncluster number counts, appear to be premature and must be supported by a\ncareful calibration of the halo mass function and by a robust calibration of\nthe mass scaling relations.\n", "  In recent synchrotron radiation facilities, the use of short (picosecond)\nelectron bunches is a powerful method for producing giant pulses of Terahertz\nCoherent Synchrotron Radiation (THz CSR). Here we report on the first direct\nobservation of these pulse shapes with a few picoseconds resolution, and of\ntheir dynamics over a long time. We thus confirm in a very direct way the\ntheories predicting an interplay between two physical processes. Below a\ncritical bunch charge, we observe a train of identical THz pulses (a broadband\nTerahertz comb) stemming from the shortness of the electron bunches. Above this\nthreshold, a large part of the emission is dominated by drifting structures,\nwhich appear through spontaneous self-organization. These challenging\nsingle-shot THz recordings are made possible by using a recently developed\nphotonic time stretch detector with a high sensitivity. The experiment has been\nrealized at the SOLEIL storage ring.\n", "  To quantify the mechanism of a complex network growth we focus on the network\nof citations of scientific papers and use a combination of the theoretical and\nexperimental tools to uncover microscopic details of this network growth.\nNamely, we develop a stochastic model of citation dynamics based on\ncopying/redirection/triadic closure mechanism. In a complementary and coherent\nway, the model accounts both for statistics of references of scientific papers\nand for their citation dynamics. Originating in empirical measurements, the\nmodel is cast in such a way that it can be verified quantitatively in every\naspect. Such verification is performed by measuring citation dynamics of\nPhysics papers. The measurements revealed nonlinear citation dynamics, the\nnonlinearity being intricately related to network topology. The nonlinearity\nhas far-reaching consequences including non-stationary citation distributions,\ndiverging citation trajectory of similar papers, runaways or \"immortal papers\"\nwith infinite citation lifetime etc. Thus, our most important finding is\nnonlinearity in complex network growth. In a more specific context, our results\ncan be a basis for quantitative probabilistic prediction of citation dynamics\nof individual papers and of the journal impact factor.\n", "  We investigate complex synchronization patterns such as cluster\nsynchronization and partial amplitude death in networks of coupled\nStuart-Landau oscillators with fractal connectivities. The study of fractal or\nself-similar topology is motivated by the network of neurons in the brain. This\nfractal property is well represented in hierarchical networks, for which we\npresent three different models. In addition, we introduce an analytical\neigensolution method and provide a comprehensive picture of the interplay of\nnetwork topology and the corresponding network dynamics, thus allowing us to\npredict the dynamics of arbitrarily large hierarchical networks simply by\nanalyzing small network motifs. We also show that oscillation death can be\ninduced in these networks, even if the coupling is symmetric, contrary to\nprevious understanding of oscillation death. Our results show that there is a\ndirect correlation between topology and dynamics: Hierarchical networks exhibit\nthe corresponding hierarchical dynamics. This helps bridging the gap between\nmesoscale motifs and macroscopic networks.\n", "  At the most fundamental level, the interaction between light and matter is\nmanifested by the emission and absorption of single photons by single quantum\nemitters. Controlling light--matter interaction is the basis for diverse\napplications ranging from light technology to quantum--information processing.\nMany of these applications are nowadays based on photonic nanostructures\nstrongly benefitting from their scalability and integrability. The confinement\nof light in such nanostructures imposes an inherent link between the local\npolarization and propagation direction of light. This leads to {\\em chiral\nlight--matter interaction}, i.e., the emission and absorption of photons depend\non the propagation direction and local polarization of light as well as the\npolarization of the emitter transition. The burgeoning research field of {\\em\nchiral quantum optics} offers fundamentally new functionalities and\napplications both for single emitters and ensembles thereof. For instance, a\nchiral light--matter interface enables the realization of integrated\nnon--reciprocal single--photon devices and deterministic spin--photon\ninterfaces. Moreover, engineering directional photonic reservoirs opens new\navenues for constructing complex quantum circuits and networks, which may be\napplied to simulate a new class of quantum many--body systems.\n", "  The $B\\to a_1 \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ decays occur by the electroweak penguin and box\ndiagrams which can be performed through the flavor changing neutral current\n(FCNC). We calculate the form factors of the FCNC $B \\to a_1$ transitions in\nthe light--cone sum rules approach, up to twist--4 distribution amplitudes of\nthe axial vector meson $a_1$. Forward--backward asymmetry, as well as branching\nratios of $B\\to a_1\\ell^{+}\\ell^{-}$, and $B\\to a_1 \\gamma$ decays are\nconsidered. A comparison is also made between our results and the predictions\nof other methods.\n", "  The effect of burstiness in complex networks has received considerable\nattention. In particular, its effect on temporal distance and delays in the air\ntransportation system is significant owing to their huge impact on our society.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose two indexes of temporal distance based on\npassengers' behavior and analyze the effect. As a result, we find that\nburstiness shortens the temporal distance while delays are increased. Moreover,\nwe discover that the positive effect of burstiness is lost when flight\nschedules get overcrowded.\n", "  We study the dynamical response of a diatomic periodic chain of rotors\ncoupled by springs, whose unit cell breaks spatial inversion symmetry. In the\ncontinuum description, we derive a nonlinear field theory which admits\ntopological kinks and antikinks as nonlinear excitations but where a\ntopological boundary term breaks the symmetry between the two and energetically\nfavors the kink configuration. Using a cobweb plot, we develop a fixed-point\nanalysis for the kink motion and demonstrate that kinks propagate without the\nPeierls-Nabarro potential energy barrier typically associated with lattice\nmodels. Using continuum elasticity theory, we trace the absence of the\nPeierls-Nabarro barrier for the kink motion to the topological boundary term\nwhich ensures that only the kink configuration, and not the antikink, costs\nzero potential energy. Further, we study the eigenmodes around the kink and\nantikink configurations using a tangent stiffness matrix approach appropriate\nfor pre-stressed structures to explicitly show how the usual energy degeneracy\nbetween the two no longer holds. We show how the kink-antikink asymmetry also\nmanifests in the way these nonlinear excitations interact with impurities\nintroduced in the chain as disorder in the spring stiffness. Finally, we\ndiscuss the effect of impurities in the (bond) spring length and build\nprototypes based on simple linkages that verify our predictions.\n", "  Exact eigen modes with orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the complex media of\nunmagnetized homogeneous plasma are studied. Three exact eigen modes with OAM\nare discovered, i.e., photons, phonons, and plasmons. It is found that an OAM\nphoton can be excited by two familiar Bessel modes without OAM. For the phonons\nand plasmons, their OAM are carried by the electrons and ions. The OAM modes in\nplasmas and their characteristics can be explored for various potential\napplications in plasma physics and accelerator physics.\n", "  The electrical control of single spin qubits based on semiconductor quantum\ndots is of great interest for scalable quantum computing since electric fields\nprovide an alternative mechanism for qubit control compared with magnetic\nfields and can also be easier to produce. Here we outline the mechanism for a\ndrastic enhancement in the electrically-driven spin rotation frequency for\nsilicon quantum dot qubits in the presence of a step at a hetero-interface. The\nenhancement is due to the strong coupling between the ground and excited states\nwhich occurs when the electron wave-function overcomes the potential barrier\ninduced by the interface step. We theoretically calculate single qubit gate\ntimes of 170ns for a quantum dot confined at a silicon/silicon-dioxide\ninterface. The engineering of such steps could be used to achieve fast\nelectrical rotation and entanglement of spin qubits despite the weak spin-orbit\ncoupling in silicon.\n", "  Initial data sets of multiple black hole systems are considered. The\nparabolic-hyperbolic form of the constraints and superposed Kerr-Schild black\nholes are used to determine them. It is shown that the ADM charges of the\nyielded multiple black hole configurations are pairwise equal to the ADM\ncharges of the corresponding superposed Kerr-Schild systems.\n", "  One of the limitations to the quantum computing capability of a\ncontinuous-variable system is determined by our ability to cool it to the\nground state, because pure logical states, in which we accurately encode\nquantum information, are conventionally pure physical states that are\nconstructed from the ground state. In this work, we present an alternative\nquantum computing formalism that encodes logical quantum information in mixed\nphysical states. We introduce a class of mixed-state protocols that are based\non a parity encoding, and propose an implementation of the universal logic\ngates by using realistic hybrid interactions. When comparing with the\nconventional pure-state protocols, our formalism could relax the necessity of,\nand hence the systemic requirements of cooling. Additionally, the mixed-state\nprotocols are inherently resilient to a wider class of noise processes, and\nreduce the fundamental energy consumption in initialisation. Our work broadens\nthe candidates of continuous-variable quantum computers.\n", "  We investigate the effects of AGN heating and the ultraviolet background on\nthe low-redshift Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest column density distribution (CDD) using\nthe Illustris simulation. We show that Illustris reproduces observations at $z\n=0.1$ in the column density range $10^{12.5} - 10^{13.5}$cm$^{-2}$, relevant\nfor the \"photon underproduction crisis.\" We attribute this to the inclusion of\nAGN feedback, which changes the gas distribution so as to mimic the effect of\nextra photons, as well as the use of the Faucher-Gigu\\`ere ultraviolet\nbackground, which is more ionizing at $z=0.1$ than the Haardt & Madau\nbackground previously considered. We show that the difference between\nsimulations run with smoothed particle hydrodynamics and simulations using a\nmoving mesh is small in this column density range but can be more significant\nat larger column densities. We further consider the effect of supernova\nfeedback, Voigt profile fitting and finite resolution, all of which we show to\nhave little influence on the CDD. Finally, we identify a discrepancy between\nour simulations and observations at column densities $10^{14} -\n10^{16}$cm$^{-2}$, where Illustris produces too few absorbers, which suggests\nthe AGN feedback model should be further refined. Since the \"photon\nunderproduction crisis\" primarily affects lower column density systems, we\nconclude that AGN feedback and standard ionizing background models can resolve\nthe crisis.\n", "  We investigate the excitation of phonons in photoexcited antimony and\ndemonstrate that the entire electron-lattice interactions, in particular\ncoherent and incoherent electron-phonon coupling, can be probed simultaneously.\nUsing femtosecond electron diffraction (FED) with high temporal resolution, we\nobserve the coherent excitation of the fully symmetric \\Ag\\ optical phonon mode\nvia the shift of the minimum of the atomic potential energy surface. Ab initio\nmolecular dynamics simulations on laser excited potential energy surfaces are\nperformed to quantify the change in lattice potential and the associated\nreal-space amplitude of the coherent atomic oscillations. Good agreement is\nobtained between the parameter-free calculations and the experiment. In\naddition, our experimental configuration allows observing the energy transfer\nfrom electrons to phonons via incoherent electron-lattice scattering events.\nThe electron-phonon coupling is determined as a function of electronic\ntemperature from our DFT calculations and the data by applying different models\nfor the energy-transfer.\n", "  Encouraged by the observation of the pentaquark states $P^+_c(4380)$ and\n$P^+_c(4450)$, we propose a novel color flux-tube structure, pentagonal state,\nfor pentaquark states within the framework of color flux-tube mode involving a\nfive-body confinement potential. Numerical results on the heavy pentaquark\nstates indicate that the states with three color flux-tube structures, diquark,\noctet and pentagonal structures, have the close masses, which can therefore be\ncalled QCD isomers analogous to isomers in Chemistry. The pentagonal structure\nhas lowest energy. The state $P^+_c(4380)$ can be described as the compact\npentaquark state $uudc\\bar{c}$ with the pentagonal structure and\n$J^P=\\frac{3}{2}^-$ in the color flux-tube model. The state $P^+_c(4450)$ can\nnot be accommodated into the color flux-tube model. The heavy pentaquark states\n$uudc\\bar{b}$, $uudb\\bar{c}$ and $uudb\\bar{b}$ are predicted in the color\nflux-tube model. The five-body confinement potential basing on the color\nflux-tube picture as a collective degree of freedom is a dynamical mechanism in\nthe formation of the compact heavy pentaquark states.\n", "  We use the hydrodynamic, cosmological EAGLE simulations to investigate how\nhot gas in haloes condenses to form and grow galaxies. We select haloes from\nthe simulations that are actively cooling and study the temperature,\ndistribution, and metallicity of their hot, cold, and transitioning `cooling'\ngas, placing these in context of semi-analytic models. Our selection criteria\nlead us to focus on Milky Way-like haloes. We find the hot-gas density profiles\nof the haloes form a progressively stronger core over time, the nature of which\ncan be captured by a beta profile that has a simple dependence on redshift. In\ncontrast, the hot gas that will cool over a time-step is broadly consistent\nwith a singular isothermal sphere. We find that cooling gas carries a few times\nthe specific angular momentum of the halo and is offset in spin direction from\nthe rest of the hot gas. The gas loses ~60% of its specific angular momentum\nduring the cooling process, generally remaining greater than that of the halo,\nand it precesses to become aligned with the cold gas already in the disc. We\nfind tentative evidence that angular-momentum losses are slightly larger when\ngas cools onto dispersion-supported galaxies. We show that an exponential\nsurface density profile for gas arriving on a disc remains a reasonable\napproximation, but a cusp containing ~20% of the mass is always present, and\ndisc scale radii are larger than predicted by a vanilla Fall & Efstathiou\nmodel. These scale radii are still closely correlated with the halo spin\nparameter, for which we suggest an updated prescription for galaxy formation\nmodels.\n", "  We study a mechanism where the dark matter number density today arises from\nasymmetries generated in the dark sector in the early universe, even though\ntotal dark matter number remains zero throughout the history of the universe.\nThe dark matter population today can be completely symmetric, with annihilation\nrates above those expected from thermal WIMPs. We give a simple example of this\nmechanism using a benchmark model of flavored dark matter. We discuss the\nexperimental signatures of this setup, which arise mainly from the sector that\nannihilates the symmetric component of dark matter.\n", "  The X-ray emission from active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a major component of\nextragalactic X-ray sky. In this paper, we use the X-ray luminosity function\n(XLF) and halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism to construct a halo\nmodel for the X-ray emission from AGNs. Verifying that the two inputs (XLF and\nHOD) are in agreement with each other, we compute the auto-correlation power\nspectrum in the soft X-ray band (0.5-2 keV) due to the AGNs potentially\nresolved by eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array)\nmission and explore the redshift and mass dependence of the power spectrum.\nStudying the relative contribution of the Poisson and the clustering terms to\nthe total power, we find that at multipoles $l\\lesssim 1000$ (i.e. large\nscales), the clustering term is larger than the Poisson term. We also forecast\nthe potential of X-ray auto-correlation power spectrum and X-ray-lensing\ncross-correlation power spectrum using eROSITA and eROSITA-LSST (Large Synoptic\nSurvey Telescope) surveys, respectively, to constrain the HOD parameters and\ntheir redshift evolution. In addition, we compute the power spectrum of the\nAGNs lying below the flux resolution limit of eROSITA, which is essential to\nunderstand in order to extract the X-ray signal from the hot diffuse gas\npresent in galaxies and clusters.\n", "  Context: Extended circumstellar emission has been detected within a few 100\nmilli-arcsec around > 10% of nearby main sequence stars using near-infrared\ninterferometry. Follow-up observations using other techniques, should they\nyield similar results or non-detections, can provide strong constraints on the\norigin of the emission. They can also reveal the variability of the phenomenon.\n  Aims: We aim to demonstrate the persistence of the phenomenon over time\nscales of a few years and to search for variability of our previously detected\nexcesses.\n  Methods: Using VLTI/PIONIER in H band we have carried out multi-epoch\nobservations of the stars for which a near-infrared excess was previously\ndetected with the same observing technique and instrument. The detection rates\nand distribution of the excesses from our original survey and the follow-up\nobservations are compared statistically. A search for variability of the\nexcesses in our time series is carried out based on the level of the broadband\nexcesses.\n  Results: In 12 of 16 follow-up observations, an excess is re-detected with a\nsignificance of > 2 sigma, and in 7 of 16 follow-up observations significant\nexcess (> 3 sigma) has been re-detected. We statistically demonstrate with very\nhigh confidence that the phenomenon persists for the majority of the systems.\nWe also present the first detection of potential variability in two sources.\n  Conclusions: We conclude that the phenomenon responsible for the excesses\npersists over time scales of a few years for the majority of the systems.\nHowever, we also find that variability intrinsic to a target can cause it to\nhave no significant excess at the time of a specific observation.\n", "  In this work we study the particle conductance of a strongly interacting\nFermi gas through a quantum point contact. With an atom-molecule two-channel\nmodel, we compute the contribution to particle conductance by both the\nfermionic atoms and the bosonic molecules using the Keldysh formalism. Focusing\non the regime above the Fermi superfluid transition temperature, we find that\nthe fermionic contribution to the conductance is reduced by interaction\ncompared with the quantized value for the non-interacting case; while the\nbosonic contribution to the conductance exhibits a plateau with non-universal\nvalues that is larger than the quantized conductance. This feature is\nparticularly profound at temperature close to the superfluid transition. We\nemphasize that the enhanced conductance arises because of the bosonic nature of\nclosed channel molecules and the low-dimensionality of the quantum point\ncontact.\n", "  The desorption dynamics of rubidium dimers (Rb_2) off the surface of helium\nnanodroplets induced by laser excitation is studied employing both nanosecond\nand femtosecond ion imaging spectroscopy. Similarly to alkali metal atoms, we\nfind that the Rb_2 desorption process resembles the dissociation of a diatomic\nmolecule. However, both angular and energy distributions of detected Rb_2^+\nions appear to be most crucially determined by the Rb_2 intramolecular degrees\nof freedom rather than by those of the Rb_2He_N complex. The pump-probe\ndynamics of Rb_2^+ is found to be slower than that of Rb^+ pointing at a weaker\neffective guest-host repulsion for excited molecules than for single atoms.\n", "  Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are nonperturbative objects defined by\nnonlocal light-cone correlations. They cannot be computed directly from Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD). Using a standard lattice QCD approach, it is possible to\ncompute moments of PDFs, which are matrix elements of local operators.\nRecently, an alternative approach has been proposed, based on the introduction\nof quasi-parton distribution functions (quasi-PDFs), which are matrix elements\nof equal-time spatial correlations and hence calculable on lattice. Quasi-PDFs\napproach standard PDFs in the limit of very large longitudinal proton momenta\n$P^z$. This limit is not attainable in lattice simulations, and quasi-PDFs fail\nto reproduce PDFs at high fractional longitudinal momenta. In this paper, we\npropose a method to improve the reconstruction of PDFs by combining information\nfrom quasi-PDFs and from the Mellin moments of regular PDFs. We test our method\nusing the diquark spectator model for up and down valence distributions of both\nunpolarized and helicity PDFs. In the future, the method can be used to produce\nPDFs entirely based on lattice QCD results.\n", "  We have developed a low-cost off-the-shelf component star sensor (StarSense)\nfor use in minisatellites and CubeSats to determine the attitude of a satellite\nin orbit. StarSense is an imaging camera with a limiting magnitude of 6.5,\nwhich extracts information from star patterns it records in the images. The\nstar sensor implements a centroiding algorithm to find centroids of the stars\nin the image, a Geometric Voting algorithm for star pattern identification, and\na QUEST algorithm for attitude quaternion calculation. Here, we describe the\nsoftware package to evaluate the performance of these algorithms as a star\nsensor single operating system. We simulate the ideal case where sky background\nand instrument errors are omitted, and a more realistic case where noise and\ncamera parameters are added to the simulated images. We evaluate such\nperformance parameters of the algorithms as attitude accuracy, calculation\ntime, required memory, star catalog size, sky coverage, etc., and estimate the\nerrors introduced by each algorithm. This software package is written for use\nin MATLAB. The testing is parametrized for different hardware parameters, such\nas the focal length of the imaging setup, the field of view (FOV) of the\ncamera, angle measurement accuracy, distortion effects, etc., and therefore,\ncan be applied to evaluate the performance of such algorithms in any star\nsensor. For its hardware implementation on our StarSense, we are currently\nporting the codes in form of functions written in C. This is done keeping in\nview its easy implementation on any star sensor electronics hardware.\n", "  Sagan et al. (1993) used the Galileo space probe data and first principles to\nfind evidence of life on Earth. Here we ask whether Sagan et al. (1993) could\nalso have detected whether life on Earth had three-dimensional structure, based\non the Galileo space probe data. We reanalyse the data from this probe to see\nif structured vegetation could have been detected in regions with abundant\nphotosynthetic pigments through the anisotropy of reflected shortwave\nradiation. We compare changing brightness of the Amazon forest (a region where\nSagan et al. (1993) noted a red edge in the reflectance spectrum, indicative of\nphotosynthesis) as the planet rotates to a common model of reflectance\nanisotropy and found measured increase of surface reflectance of 0.019 versus a\n0.007 predicted from only anisotropic effects. We hypothesize the difference\nwas due to minor cloud contamination. However, the Galileo dataset had only a\nsmall change in phase angle (sun-satellite position) which reduced the observed\nanisotropy signal and we demonstrate that theoretically if the probe had a\nvariable phase angle between 0-20, there would have been a much larger\npredicted change in surface reflectance of 0.06 and under such a scenario\nthree-dimensional vegetation structure on Earth could possibly have been\ndetected. These results suggest that anisotropic effects may be useful to help\ndetermine whether exoplanets have three-dimensional vegetation structure in the\nfuture but that further comparisons between empirical and theoretical results\nare first necessary.\n", "  We demonstrate the importance of correctly implementing RG-running and\nchoosing the RG-scale when calculating quantum corrections to inflaton\ndynamics. We show that such corrections are negligible for single-field\ninflation, in the sense of not altering the viable region in the $n_s-r$ plane,\nwhen imposing Planck constraints on $A_s$. Surprisingly, this also applies, in\na nontrivial way, for an inflaton coupled to additional spectator degrees of\nfreedom. The result relies on choosing the renormalisation scale\n(pseudo-)optimally, thereby avoiding unphysical large logarithmic corrections\nto the Friedmann equations and large running of the couplings. We find that the\nviable range of parameters of the potential is altered relative to the\nclassical limit, and we find an upper limit of $g\\simeq 10^{-4}$ on the value\nof the inflaton-spectator portal coupling still allowing for inflation. And an\nupper limit of $g\\simeq 10^{-5}$ for inflation to correctly reproduce the\nscalar amplitude of fluctuations $A_s$.\n", "  The fractional Josephson effect has been observed in many instances as a\nsignature of a topological superconducting state containing zero-energy\nMajorana modes. We present a nontopological scenario which can produce a\nfractional Josephson effect generically in semiconductor-based Josephson\njunctions, namely, a resonant impurity bound state weakly coupled to a highly\ntransparent channel. We show that the fractional ac Josephson effect can be\ngenerated by the Landau-Zener processes which flip the electron occupancy of\nthe impurity bound state. The Josephson effect signature for Majorana modes\nbecome distinct from this nontopological scenario only at low frequency. We\nprove that a variant of the fractional ac Josephson effect, namely, the\nlow-frequency doubled Shapiro steps, can provide a more reliable signature of\nthe topological superconducting state.\n", "  We present optical UBVRI zenith night sky brightness measurements collected\non eighteen nights during 2013--2016 and SQM measurements obtained daily over\ntwenty months during 2014--2016 at the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional on the\nSierra San Pedro Martir (OAN-SPM) in Mexico. The UBVRI data is based upon CCD\nimages obtained with the 0.84m and 2.12m telescopes, while the SQM data is\nobtained with a high-sensitivity, low-cost photometer. The typical moonless\nnight sky brightness at zenith averaged over the whole period is U = 22.68, B =\n23.10, V = 21.84, R = 21.04, I = 19.36, and SQM = 21.88 mag/square arcsec, once\ncorrected for zodiacal light. We find no seasonal variation of the night sky\nbrightness measured with the SQM. The typical night sky brightness values found\nat OAN-SPM are similar to those reported for other astronomical dark sites at a\nsimilar phase of the solar cycle. We find a trend of decreasing night sky\nbrightness with decreasing solar activity during period of the observations.\nThis trend implies that the sky has become darker by delta_U =0.7, delta_B\n=0.5, delta_V =0.3, delta_R =0.5 mag/square arcsec since early 2014 due to the\npresent solar cycle.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering measurements have been performed to investigate\nthe spin waves of the quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnetic ladder compound\nBaFe$_2$S$_3$, where a superconducting transition was observed under pressure\n[H. Takahashi {\\it et al.}, Nat. Mater. 14, 1008-1012 (2015); T. Yamauchi {\\it\net al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 246402 (2015)]. By fitting the spherically\naveraged experimental data collected on a powder sample to a Heisenberg\nHamiltonian, we find that the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic ladder exhibits\na strong nearest neighbor ferromagnetic exchange interaction ($SJ_R=-71\\pm4$\nmeV) along the rung direction, an antiferromagnetic $SJ_L=49\\pm3$ meV along the\nleg direction and a ferromagnetic $SJ_2=-15\\pm2$ meV along the diagonal\ndirection. Our data demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic spin excitations are\na common characteristic for the iron-based superconductors, while specific\nrelative values for the exchange interactions do not appear to be unique for\nthe parent states of the superconducting materials.\n", "  For a Kerr black hole (KBH) with spin $J$ and mass $M$ in a steady\nelectromagnetic field, a special Wald vacuum solution (WVS) has been found in\nthe case of no-source uniform field. For WVS, the Meissner effect (ME) occurs\nonly in the the extreme KBH where $M^2/J=1$, in this case, the magnetic field\nis totally excluded from the event horizon (EH) of KBH. However, WVS does not\nconsider the Hawking radiation (HR) but treats KBH as an absolutely black body.\nIf HR is added , researchers believe that the condition is not so restricted\nand it is possible for ME to occur in less extreme case. How less is the \"less\nextreme case\"? This paper tries to answer this question. Since the Hawking\ntemperature $T_H$ of KBH defined by HR is proportional to the surface gravity\n$\\kappa$ at the EH, this question is actually about the so-called\nexistence/non-existence of ME (ME/NME) or superconducting phase transition. In\nthis paper, we study the connection between the superconductivity of KBH-EH and\nthe existence of Weyl Fermion (WF). Using thermodynamic formulas and the KBH\nstate equation, we prove that the inherent-parameter condition for ME to occur\nis $M^2/J\\leq \\epsilon_c=1.5$ in force-free fields whether it be in the simple\naxisymmetric vacuum zero source case or in the non-zero source case which can\nbe described by the nonlinear Grad-Shafranov (G-S) equation. We suggest that\nthis is a second-order phase transition and we calculate the critical exponents\n$\\delta=1$ and $\\eta=1/2$ for the specific heat diverging at constant $J$, and\nthe critical point $(M_c, \\Omega_c)$, which equals $(1.22\\sqrt{ J}, 0.16/\\sqrt{\nJ})$ where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity of KBH. Furthermore we draw the\nphase diagrams in both $(M, J)$ and $(M,\\Omega)$ coordinates.\n", "  We present a protocol for using trapped ions to measure rotations via\nmatter-wave Sagnac interferometry. The trap allows the interferometer to\nenclose a large area in a compact apparatus through repeated round-trips in a\nSagnac geometry. We show how a uniform magnetic field can be used to close the\ninterferometer over a large dynamic range in rotation speed and measurement\nbandwidth without losing contrast. Since this technique does not require the\nions to be confined in the Lamb-Dicke regime, thermal states with many phonons\nshould be sufficient for operation.\n", "  Adopting quantum communication to modern networking requires transmitting\nquantum information through fiber-based infrastructure. We report the first\ndemonstration of superdense coding over optical fiber links, taking advantage\nof a complete Bell-state measurement enabled by time-polarization\nhyperentanglement, linear optics, and common single-photon detectors. We\ndemonstrate the highest single-qubit channel capacity to date utilizing linear\noptics, $1.665 \\pm 0.018$, and we provide a full experimental implementation of\na hybrid, quantum-classical communication protocol for image transfer.\n", "  We have developed Norland Optical Adhesive (NOA) flow focusing devices,\nmaking use of the excellent solvent compatibility and surface properties of NOA\nto generate micron scale oil-in-water emulsions with polydispersities as low as\n5%. While current work on microfluidic oil-in-water emulsification largely\nconcerns the production of droplets with sizes on the order of 10s of\nmicrometres, large enough that Brownian motion is negligible, our NOA devices\ncan produce droplets with radii ranging from 2 {\\mu}m to 12 {\\mu}m. To\ndemonstrate the utility of these emulsions as colloidal model systems we\nproduce fluorescently labelled polydimethylsiloxane droplets suitable for\nparticle resolved studies with confocal microscopy. We analyse the structure of\nthe resulting emulsion in 3D using coordinate tracking and the topological\ncluster classification and reveal a new mono-disperse thermal system.\n", "  Classical Supergiant X-ray Binaries host a neutron star orbiting a supergiant\nOB star and display persistent X-ray luminosities of 10$^{35}$ to 10$^{37}$\nerg/s. The stellar wind from the massive companion is believed to be the main\nsource of matter accreted by the compact object. With this first paper, we\nintroduce a ballistic model to characterize the structure of the wind at the\norbital scale as it accelerates, from the stellar surface to the vicinity of\nthe accretor. Thanks to the parametrization we retained and the numerical\npipeline we designed, we can investigate the supersonic flow and the subsequent\nobservables as a function of a reduced set of characteristic numbers and\nscales. We show that the shape of the permanent flow is entirely determined by\nthe mass ratio, the filling factor, the Eddington factor and the $\\alpha$-force\nmultiplier which drives the stellar wind acceleration. Provided scales such as\nthe orbital period are known, we can trace back the observables to evaluate the\nmass accretion rates, the accretion mechanism, the shearing of the inflow and\nthe stellar parameters. We confront our model to three persistent Supergiant\nX-ray Binaries (Vela X-1, IGR J18027-2016, XTE J1855-026) and discuss the\nlikelihood of wind-formed accretion discs around the accretors in each case,\nfurther investigated in a following paper.\n", "  The Barrett-Cavalcanti-Lal-Maroney (BCLM) argument stands as the most\neffective means of demonstrating the reality of the quantum state. Its\nadvantages include being derived from very few assumptions, and a robustness to\nexperimental error. Finding the best way to implement the argument\nexperimentally is an open problem, however, and involves cleverly choosing sets\nof states and measurements. I show that techniques from convex optimisation\ntheory can be leveraged to numerically search for these sets, which then form a\nrecipe for experiments that allow for the strongest statements about the\nontology of the wavefunction to be made. The optimisation approach presented is\nversatile, efficient and can take account of the finite errors present in any\nreal experiment. I find significantly improved low-cardinality sets which are\nguaranteed partially optimal for a BCLM test in low Hilbert space dimension. I\nfurther show that mixed states can be more optimal than pure states.\n", "  We calculate the metric and affine connection due to a piecewise linear\ncosmic string loop, and the effect of gravitational back reaction for the\nGarfinkle-Vachaspati loop with four straight segments. As expected, back\nreaction reduces the size of the loop, in accord with the energy going into\ngravitational waves. The \"square\" (maximally symmetric) loop evaporates without\nchanging shape, but for all other loops in this class, the kinks become less\nsharp and segments between kinks become curved. If the loop is close to the\nsquare case, it will evaporate before its kinks are significantly changed, if\nit is far from square, the opening out of the kinks is much faster than\nevaporation of the loop.\n", "  Using the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function formalism, we investigate\nthe effect of defects on the electronic structure and transport properties of\ntwo-dimensional topological insulators (TI). We demonstrate how the spatial\nflow of charge changes between the topologically protected edge and bulk states\nand show that elastically and inelastically scattering defects that preserve\nthe time reversal symmetry of the TI lead to qualitatively different effects on\nthe TI's local electronic structure and its transport properties. Moreover, we\nshow that the recently predicted ability to create highly spin-polarized\ncurrents by breaking the time-reversal symmetry of the TI via magnetic defects\n[Phys. Rev. B 93, 081401 (2016)] is robust against the inclusion of a Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction and the effects of dephasing, and remains unaffected by\nchanges over a wide range of the TI's parameters. We discuss how the sign of\nthe induced spin currents changes under symmetry operations, such as reversal\nof bias and gate voltages, or spatial reflections. Finally, we show that the\ninsight into the interplay between topology and symmetry of the magnetic\ndefects can be employed for the creation of novel quantum phenomena, such as\nhighly localized magnetic fields inside the TI.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the effects of long-range disorder and\nelectron-electron interactions on the optical properties of hexagonal armchair\ngraphene quantum dots consisting of up to 10806 atoms. The numerical\ncalculations are performed using a combination of tight-binding, mean-field\nHubbard and configuration interaction methods. Imperfections in the graphene\nquantum dots are modelled as a long-range random potential landscape, giving\nrise to electron-hole puddles. We show that, when the electron-hole puddles are\npresent, tight-binding method gives a poor description of the low-energy\nabsorption spectra compared to meanfield and configuration interaction\ncalculation results. As the size of the graphene quantum dot is increased, the\nuniversal optical conductivity limit can be observed in the absorption\nspectrum. When disorder is present, calculated absorption spectrum approaches\nthe experimental results for isolated monolayer of graphene sheet.\n", "  Topological order has become a new paradigm to distinguish ground states of\ninteracting many-body systems without conventional long-range order. Here we\ndiscuss possible extensions of this concept to density matrices describing\nstatistical ensembles. For a large class of quasi-thermal states, which can be\nrealized as thermal states of some quasi-local Hamiltonian, we generalize\nearlier definitions of density matrix topology to generic many-body systems\nwith strong correlations. We point out that the robustness of topological\norder, defined as a pattern of long-range entanglement, depends crucially on\nthe perturbations under consideration. While it is intrinsically protected\nagainst local perturbations of arbitrary strength in an infinite closed quantum\nsystem, purely local perturbations can destroy topological order in open\nsystems coupled to baths if the coupling is sufficiently strong. We discuss our\nclassification scheme using the finite-temperature quantum Hall states and\npoint out that the classical Hall effect can be understood as a finite\ntemperature topological phase.\n", "  We propose an effective left-right-right-left model with a parity breaking\nscale around a few TeV. One of the main achievements of the model is that the\nmirror fermions as well as the mirror gauge sector simultaneously could be at\nTeV scale. It is shown that the most dangerous quadratic divergence of the SM\nHiggs boson involving the top quark in the loop is naturally suppressed, and\nbegins at three loop. The model postpones the fine-tuning of the mass of the SM\nHiggs boson up to a sufficiently high scale. The model explains the smallness\nof the neutrino masses whether they are Dirac or Majorana. Furthermore, the\nstrong $CP$ phase is zero in this model.\n", "  The insertion of a small polarizable particle in an arbitrarily large optical\ncavity significantly alters the quantum-mechanical state of the electromagnetic\nfield in that the photon ground state of the empty cavity and that of the\ncavity with the particle become mutually orthogonal and, thus, cannot be\nconnected adiabatically in the infinite limit. The photon problem can be mapped\nexactly onto that of a many-body system of fermions, which is known to exhibit\nan orthogonality catastrophe when a finite-range local potential is introduced.\nWe predict that the motion of polarizable objects inside a cavity, no matter\nhow slow, as well as their addition and removal from the cavity, will generate\na macroscopic, diverging number of low-energy photons. The significance of\nthese results in regard to the quantum measurement problem and the dynamical\nCasimir effect are also discussed.\n", "  We present here detailed derivations of mathematical expressions for the\naccuracy in the arrival direction of particles estimated using a set of stacked\nresistive plate chambers (RPCs). The expressions are validated against\nexperimental results using data collected from the prototype detectors (without\nmagnet) of the upcoming India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). We also present\na theoretical estimate of angular resolution of such a setup. In principle,\nthese expressions can be used for any other detector with an architecture\nsimilar to that of RPCs.\n", "  We find that $\\sim 15-20$ per cent of A-type stars or red giants are bound\nwith a massive companion ($M_{\\rm secondary} > 1M_{\\odot}$) in an intermediate\nwide orbit ($0.5<P<5000\\mbox{ yr}$). These massive binaries are expected to\nform wide-orbit, double-degenerate systems (WODDs) within $\\lesssim10\\mbox{\nGyr}$ implying that $\\sim10$ per cent of white dwarfs (WDs) are expected to be\npart of a WODD with a lighter WD companion. These findings are based on an\nanalysis of previous adaptive optics observations of A-type stars and radial\nvelocity measurements of red giants and shed light on the claimed discrepancy\nbetween the seemingly high multiplicity function of stars and the rather low\nnumber of detected double degenerates. We expect that GAIA will find $\\sim 10$\nnew WODDs within $20\\mbox{ pc}$ from the sun. These results put a stringent\nconstraint on the collision model of type Ia supernovae in which triple stellar\nsystems that include a WODD as the inner binary are required to be abundant.\n", "  In this work, we study linearised gravitational fields on the entire\nMinkowski space-time including space-like infinity. The generalised conformal\nfield equations linearised about a Minkowski background are utilised for this\npurpose. In principle, this conformal representation of Einstein's equations\ncan be used to carry out global simulations of Minkowski space-time. We\ninvestigate thoroughly this possibility.\n", "  We report the observation of a Griffiths Phase in the geometrically\nfrustrated antiferromagnet DyBaCo${_4}$O${_{7+\\delta}}$. Its onset is\ndetermined using measurements of the thermoremanent magnetization, which is\nshown to be superior to conventional in-field measurement protocols for the\nidentification of the Griffiths Phase. Within this phase, the temporal\nrelaxation of magnetization exhibits a functional form which is expected for\nHeisenberg systems, reflecting the nature of spin interactions in this class of\nmaterials. Interestingly, the effective Co${^{2+}}$/Co${^{3+}}$ ratio tailored\nby varying the oxygen non-stoichiometry $\\delta$ is only seen to influence the\nantiferromagnetic ordering temperature ($T{_N}$), leaving the Griffiths\nTemperature ($T{_G}$) invariant.\n", "  We consider scaling of the entanglement entropy across a topological quantum\nphase transition in one dimension. The change of the topology manifests itself\nin a sub-leading term, which scales as $L^{-1/\\alpha}$ with the size of the\nsubsystem $L$, here $\\alpha$ is the R\\'{e}nyi index. This term reveals the\nuniversal scaling function $h_\\alpha(L/\\xi)$, where $\\xi$ is the correlation\nlength, which is sensitive to the topological index.\n", "  In Ti-intercalated self-doped $1T$-TiSe$_2$ crystals, the charge density wave\n(CDW) superstructure induces two nonequivalent sites for Ti dopants. Recently,\nit has been shown that increasing Ti doping dramatically influences the CDW by\nbreaking it into phase-shifted domains. Here, we report scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy experiments that reveal a dopant-site dependence of\nthe CDW gap. Supported by density functional theory, we demonstrate that the\nloss of the longrange phase coherence introduces an imbalance in the\nintercalated-Ti site distribution and restrains the CDW gap closure. This local\nresilient behavior of the $1T$-TiSe$_2$ CDW reveals a novel mechanism between\nCDW and defects in mutual influence.\n", "  Using our recently developed relativistic three-particle quantization\ncondition, we study the finite-volume energy shift of a spin-zero\nthree-particle bound state. We reproduce the result obtained using\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics by Meissner, Rios and Rusetsky, and\ngeneralize the result to a moving frame.\n", "  We report here the realization of ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and\nmagnetocapacitance effect in SrFe12O19 ceramics at room temperature. The\nceramics demonstrate a saturated polarization hysteresis loop, two I-V peaks\nand large anomaly of dielectric constant near Curie temperature. These\nevidences confirmed the ferroelectricity of SrFe12O19 ceramics after annealing\nin O2 atmosphere. The remnant polarization of the SrFe12O19 ceramic is 103\n{\\mu}C/cm2. The material also exhibits strong ferromagnetic characterization,\nthe coercive field and remnant magnetic moment are 6192Oe and 35.8emu/g,\nrespectively. Subsequent annealing SrFe12O19 ceramics in O2 not only reveals\nits innate ferroelectricity but also improves the ferromagnetic properties\nthrough transforming Fe2+ into Fe3+. By applying a magnetic field, the\ncapacitance demonstrates remarkable change along with B field, the maximum\nrelative change of dielectric constant is 1174%, which reflects a giant\nmagnetocapacitance effect in SrFe12O19. These combined functional responses in\nSrFe12O19 ceramics opens substantial possibilities for applications in novel\nelectric devices.\n", "  It is universally accepted that noise and decoherence affecting the\nperformance of superconducting quantum circuits are consistent with the\npresence of spurious two-level systems (TLS). In recent years bulk defects have\nbeen generally ruled out as the dominant source, and the search has focused on\nsurfaces and interfaces. Despite a wide range of theoretical models and\nexperimental efforts, the origin of these surface TLS still remains largely\nunknown, making further mitigation of TLS induced decoherence extremely\nchallenging. Here we use a recently developed on-chip electron spin resonance\n(ESR) technique that allows us to detect spins with a very low surface\ncoverage. We combine this technique with various surface treatments\nspecifically to reveal the nature of native surface spins on Al$_2$O$_3$ -- the\nmainstay of almost all solid state quantum devices. On a large number of\nsamples we resolve three ESR peaks with the measured total paramagnetic spin\ndensity $n=2.2\\times 10^{17}$m$^{-2}$, which matches the density inferred from\nthe flux noise in SQUIDs. We show that two of these peaks originate from\nphysisorbed atomic hydrogen which appears on the surface as a by-product of\nwater dissociation. We suggest that the third peak is due to molecular oxygen\non the Al$_2$O$_3$ surface captured at strong Lewis base defect sites,\nproducing charged O$_2^-$. These results provide important information towards\nthe origin of charge and flux noise in quantum circuits. Our findings open up a\nwhole new approach to identification and controlled reduction of paramagnetic\nsources of noise in solid state quantum devices.\n", "  The most popular model for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) involves the\ncoalescence of binary neutron stars. Because the progenitor is actually hidden\nfrom view, we must consider under which circumstances such merging systems are\ncapable of producing a successful sGRB. Soon after coalescence, winds are\nlaunched from the merger remnant. In this paper, we use realistic wind profiles\nderived from global merger simulations in order to investigate the interaction\nof sGRB jets with these winds using numerical simulations. We analyze the\nconditions for which these axisymmetric winds permit relativistic jets to\nbreakout and produce a sGRB. We find that jets with luminosities comparable to\nthose observed in sGRBs are only successful when their half-opening angles are\nbelow ~20{\\deg}. This jet collimation mechanism leads to a simple physical\ninterpretation of the luminosities and opening angles inferred for sGRBs. If\nwide, low luminosity jets are observed, they might be indicative of a different\nprogenitor avenue such as the merger of a neutron star with a black hole. We\nalso use the observed durations of sGRB to place constraints on the lifetime of\nthe wind phase, which is determined by the time it takes the jet to breakout.\nIn all cases we find that the derived limits argue against completely stable\nremnants for binary neutron star mergers that produce sGRBs.\n", "  Motivated by the goal for high accuracy modeling of gravitational radiation\nemitted by isolated systems, recently, there has been renewed interest in the\nnumerical solution of the hyperboloidal initial value problem for Einstein's\nfield equations in which the outer boundary of the numerical grid is placed at\nnull infinity. In this article, we numerically implement the tetrad-based\napproach presented in [J.M. Bardeen, O. Sarbach, and L.T. Buchman, Phys. Rev. D\n83, 104045 (2011)] for a spherically symmetric, minimally coupled,\nself-gravitating scalar field. When this field is massless, the evolution\nsystem reduces to a regular, first-order symmetric hyperbolic system of\nequations for the conformally rescaled scalar field which is coupled to a set\nof singular elliptic constraints for the metric coefficients. We show how to\nsolve this system based on a numerical finite-difference approximation,\nobtaining stable numerical evolutions for initial black hole configurations\nwhich are surrounded by a spherical shell of scalar field, part of which\ndisperses to infinity and part of which is accreted by the black hole. As a\nnon-trivial test, we study the tail decay of the scalar field along different\ncurves, including one along the marginally trapped tube, one describing the\nworld line of a timelike observer at a finite radius outside the horizon, and\none corresponding to a generator of null infinity. Our results are in perfect\nagreement with the usual power-law decay discussed in previous work. This\narticle also contains a detailed analysis for the asymptotic behavior and\nregularity of the lapse, conformal factor, extrinsic curvature and the\nMisner-Sharp mass function along constant mean curvature slices.\n", "  Interplay of Pomeranchuk instability (spontaneous symmetry breaking of the\nFermi surface) and d-wave superconductivity is studied for the repulsive\nHubbard model on the square lattice with the dynamical mean field theory\ncombined with the fluctuation exchange approximation (FLEX+DMFT). We show that\nthe four-fold symmetric Fermi surface becomes unstable against a spontaneous\ndistortion into two-fold near the van Hove filling, where the symmetry of\nsuperconductivity coexisting with the Pomeranchuk distorted Fermi surface is\nmodified from the d-wave pairing to (d+s)-wave. By systematically shifting the\nposition of van Hove filling with varied second- and third-neighbor hoppings,\nwe find that the transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm PI}$ of Pomeranchuk\ninstability is more sensitively affected by the position of van Hove filling\nthan the superconducting $T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm SC}$. This implies that the filling\nregion for strong Pomeranchuk instability and that for strong superconducting\nfluctuations can be separated, and Pomeranchuk instability can appear even if\nthe peak of $T_c^{\\rm PI}$ is lower than the peak of $T_c^{\\rm SC}$. An\ninteresting observation is that the Fermi surface distortion can enhance the\nsuperconducting $T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm SC}$ in the overdoped regime, which is\nexplained with a perturbation picture for small distortions.\n", "  We derive a set of constraints, which we will call hierarchy constraints\n(HCs), on scattering amplitudes of an arbitrary multistate Landau-Zener model\n(MLZM). The presence of additional symmetries can transform such constraints\ninto nontrivial relations between elements of the transition probability\nmatrix. This observation can be used to derive complete solutions of some MLZMs\nor, for models that cannot be solved completely, to reduce the number of\nindependent elements of the transition probability matrix.\n", "  The response of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) to changing climate forcings is\nan important driver of sea-level changes. Anthropogenic climate change may\ndrive a sizeable AIS tipping point response with subsequent increases in\ncoastal flooding risks. Many studies analyzing flood risks use simple models to\nproject the future responses of AIS and its sea-level contributions. These\nanalyses have provided important new insights, but they are often silent on the\neffects of potentially important processes such as Marine Ice Sheet Instability\n(MISI) or Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI). These approximations can be well\njustified and result in more parsimonious and transparent model structures.\nThis raises the question of how this approximation impacts hindcasts and\nprojections. Here, we calibrate a previously published and relatively simple\nAIS model, which neglects the effects of MICI and regional characteristics,\nusing a combination of observational constraints and a Bayesian inversion\nmethod. Specifically, we approximate the effects of missing MICI by comparing\nour results to those from expert assessments with more realistic models and\nquantify the bias during the last interglacial when MICI may have been\ntriggered. Our results suggest that the model can approximate the process of\nMISI and reproduce the projected median melt from some previous expert\nassessments in the year 2100. Yet, our mean hindcast is roughly 3/4 of the\nobserved data during the last interglacial period and our mean projection is\nroughly 1/6 and 1/10 of the mean from a model accounting for MICI in the year\n2100. These results suggest that missing MICI and/or regional characteristics\ncan lead to a low-bias during warming period AIS melting and hence a potential\nlow-bias in projected sea levels and flood risks.\n", "  Based on the assumption of two-quark structure for the light scalar mesons,\nwithin the framework of perturbative QCD approach, we investigate the $B_{q}\\to\nD_{(s)}^{(*)} S(q=u,d,s)$ decays induced by $b\\to u $ transition, where $S$\ndenotes a light scalar meson. Under two different scenarios, we calculate the\nbranching ratios of 96 decay modes totally, which are in the range of $10^{-5}$\nto $10^{-8}$. The comparison between our predictions and the experimental data\nwill allow us to probe the inner structure of the scalar mesons. In the\nstandard model, since all decays can only occur through tree operators, there\nare no $CP$ asymmetries. From our calculations, it has been shown that the\nannihilation type diagrams, especially the nonfactorizable annihilation\ndiagrams, play important roles in the decay amplitudes, especially for these\ncolor-suppressed and pure annihilation type decay modes. We also find that the\nbranching ratios of color-allowed type decays are sensitive to the different\nscenarios, so the measurements of them will be ideal places to differentiate\nthe different scenarios. It can be found that the ratios between $Br(B^0\\to\nD^{(*)0}\\sigma)$ and $Br(B^0\\to D^{(*)0}f_0)$, and between $Br(B^+\\to\nD^{(*)+}\\sigma)$ and $Br(B^{+}\\to D^{(*)+}f_0)$ can be used to determine the\nmixing angle of $\\sigma$ and $f_0$.\n", "  Signatures of the Coulomb corrections in the photoelectron momentum\ndistribution during laser-induced ionization of atoms or ions in tunneling and\nmultiphoton regimes are investigated analytically in the case of an\none-dimensional problem. High-order Coulomb corrected strong-field\napproximation is applied, where the exact continuum state in the S-matrix is\napproximated by the eikonal Coulomb-Volkov state including the second-order\ncorrections to the eikonal. Although, without high-order corrections our theory\ncoincides with the known analytical R-matrix (ARM) theory, we propose a\nsimplified procedure for the matrix element derivation. Rather than matching\nthe eikonal Coulomb-Volkov wave function with the bound state as in the\nARM-theory to remove the Coulomb singularity, we calculate the matrix element\nvia the saddle-point integration method as by time as well as by coordinate,\nand in this way avoiding the Coulomb singularity. The momentum shift in the\nphotoelectron momentum distribution with respect to the ARM-theory due to\nhigh-order corrections is analyzed for tunneling and multiphoton regimes. The\nrelation of the quantum corrections to the tunneling delay time is discussed\n", "  Context. High resolution stellar spectral atlases are valuable resources to\nastronomy. They are rare in the $1 - 5\\,\\mu$m region for historical reasons,\nbut once available, high resolution atlases in this part of the spectrum will\naid the study of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. Aims. The aim of the\nCRIRES-POP project is to produce a high resolution near-infrared spectral\nlibrary of stars across the H-R diagram. The aim of this paper is to present\nthe fully reduced spectrum of the K giant 10 Leo that will form the basis of\nthe first atlas within the CRIRES-POP library, to provide a full description of\nthe data reduction processes involved, and to provide an update on the\nCRIRES-POP project. Methods. All CRIRES-POP targets were observed with almost\n200 different observational settings of CRIRES on the ESO Very Large Telescope,\nresulting in a basically complete coverage of its spectral range as accessible\nfrom the ground. We reduced the spectra of 10 Leo with the CRIRES pipeline,\ncorrected the wavelength solution and removed telluric absorption with\nMolecfit, then resampled the spectra to a common wavelength scale, shifted them\nto rest wavelengths, flux normalised, and median combined them into one final\ndata product. Results. We present the fully reduced, high resolution,\nnear-infrared spectrum of 10 Leo. This is also the first complete spectrum from\nthe CRIRES instrument. The spectrum is available online. Conclusions. The first\nCRIRES-POP spectrum has exceeded our quality expectations and will form the\ncentre of a state-of-the-art stellar atlas. This first CRIRES-POP atlas will\nsoon be available, and further atlases will follow. All CRIRES-POP data\nproducts will be freely and publicly available online.\n", "  We present a lattice study of a Nambu Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model using Wilson\nfermions. Four fermion interactions are a natural part of several extensions of\nthe Standard Model, appearing as a low energy description of a more fundamental\ntheory. In models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking they are used to\nendow the Standard Model fermions with masses. In infrared conformal models\nthese interaction, when sufficiently strong, can alter the dynamics of the\nfixed point, turning the theory into a (near) conformal model with desirable\nfeatures for model building. As a first step toward the nonperturbative study\nof these models, we study the phase space of the ungauged NJL model.\n", "  We propose a mechanism for the enhancement of vacuum fluctuations by means of\na classical field. The basic idea is that if an observable quantity depends\nquadratically upon a quantum field, such as the electric field, then the\napplication of a classical field produces a cross term between the classical\nand quantum fields. This cross term may be significantly larger than the purely\nquantum part, but also undergoes fluctuations driven by the quantum field. We\nillustrate this effect in a model for lightcone fluctuations involving pulses\nin a nonlinear dielectric. Vacuum electric field fluctuations produce\nfluctuations in the speed of a probe pulse, and form an analog model for\nquantum gravity effects. If the material has a nonzero third-order\nsusceptibility, then the fractional light speed fluctuations are proportional\nto the square of the fluctuating electric field. Hence the application of a\nclassical electric field can enhance the speed fluctuations. We give an example\nwhere this enhancement can be an increase of one order of magnitude, increasing\nthe possibility of observing the effect.\n", "  We aim at developing an efficient method to search for late-type subdwarfs\n(metal-depleted dwarfs with spectral types >M5) to improve the current\nstatistics. Our objectives are: improve our knowledge of metal-poor low-mass\ndwarfs, bridge the gap between the late-M and L types, determine their surface\ndensity, and understand the impact of metallicity on the stellar and substellar\nmass function.\n  We carried out a search cross-matching the SDSS, 2MASS, and UKIDSS using\nSTILTS, Aladin, and Topcat. We considered different photometric and proper\nmotion criteria for our selection. We identified 29 and 71 late-type subdwarf\ncandidates in each cross-correlation over 8826 and 3679 square degrees,\nrespectively. We obtained low-resolution optical spectra for 71 of our\ncandidates with GTC, NOT, and VLT and retrieved spectra for 30 candidates from\nthe SDSS spectroscopic database. We classified 92 candidates based on 101\noptical spectra using two methods: spectral indices and comparison with\ntemplates of known subdwarfs.\n  We confirmed 86% and 94% of the candidates as late-type subdwarfs from the\nSDSS vs 2MASS and SDSS vs UKIDSS cross-matches, respectively. These subdwarfs\nhave spectral types ranging between M5 and L0.5 and SDSS magnitudes in the\nr=19.4-23.3 mag range. Our new late-type M discoveries include 49 subdwarfs, 25\nextreme subdwarfs, six ultrasubdwarfs, one subdwarf/extreme subdwarf, and two\ndwarfs/subdwarfs. We derived a surface density of late-type subdwarfs of\n0.040$^{+0.012}_{-0.007}$ per square degree in the SDSS DR7 vs UKIDSS LAS DR10\ncross-match. We also checked the AllWISE photometry of known and new subdwarfs\nand found that mid-infrared colours of M subdwarfs do not appear to differ from\ntheir solar-metallicity counterparts of similar spectral types. However, the\nJ-W2 and J-W1 colours are bluer for lower metallicity dwarfs. (abstract\nstrongly abridged)\n", "  Recent application of neural networks (NNs) to modeling interatomic\ninteractions has shown the learning machines' encouragingly accurate\nperformance for select elemental and multicomponent systems. In this study, we\nexplore the possibility of building a library of NN-based models by introducing\na hierarchical NN training. In such a stratified procedure NNs for\nmulticomponent systems are obtained by sequential training from the bottom up:\nfirst unaries, then binaries, and so on. Advantages of constructing NN sets\nwith shared parameters include acceleration of the training process and intact\ndescription of the constituent systems. We use an automated generation of\ndiverse structure sets for NN training on density functional theory-level\nreference energies. In the test case of Cu, Pd, Ag, Cu-Pd, Cu-Ag, Pd-Ag, and\nCu-Pd-Ag systems, NNs trained in the traditional and stratified fashions are\nfound to have essentially identical accuracy for defect energies, phonon\ndispersions, formation energies, etc. The models' robustness is further\nillustrated via unconstrained evolutionary structure searches in which the NN\nis used for the local optimization of crystal unit cells.\n", "  We show that the effective theory describing single component continuous\nmedia with a linear and constant equation of state of the form $p=w\\rho$ is\ninvariant under a 1-parameter family of continuous disformal transformations.\nIn the special case of $w=1/3$ (ultrarelativistic gas), such a family reduces\nto conformal transformations. As examples, perfect fluids, homogeneous and\nisotropic solids are discussed.\n", "  In this work we theoretically investigate the stochastic resonance (SR)\neffect in an optomechanical membrane system subject to two weak signals (one\noptical field and one mechanical force). The quadratic optomechanical coupling\nallows us to find a region with tristability where the noise activated\nstochastic switching among three stable states occurs and SR phenomena are\nobserved at the cooperation of input signals and noises. We show that the\nmechanical force and the optical field respectively serve as an additive signal\nand a multiplicative signal to the membrane position and they induce completely\ndifferent SR behaviors. Moreover, when two signals coexist the SR effect can be\nenhanced and the beating effect appears in the SR synchronization process with\nunsynchronized signals.\n", "  We study the winding number susceptibility < I^2> in a superfluid system and\nthe topological susceptibility < Q^2> in QCD. We argue that both correlation\nfunctions exhibit similar structures, including the generation of the contact\nterms. We discuss the nature of the contact term in superfluid system and argue\nthat it has exactly the same origin as in QCD, and it is related to the long\ndistance physics which cannot be associated with conventional microscopical\ndegrees of freedom such as phonons and rotons. We emphasize that the conceptual\nsimilarities between superfluid system and QCD may lead, hopefully, to a deeper\nunderstanding of the topological features of a superfluid system as well as the\nQCD vacuum.\n", "  The analysis of Proxima Centauri's radial velocities recently led\nAnglada-Escud\\'e et al. (2016) to claim the presence of a low mass planet\norbiting the Sun's nearest star once every 11.2 days. Although the a-priori\nprobability that Proxima b transits its parent star is just 1.5%, the potential\nimpact of such a discovery would be considerable. Independent of recent radial\nvelocity efforts, we observed Proxima Centauri for 12.5 days in 2014 and 31\ndays in 2015 with the MOST space telescope. We report here that we cannot make\na compelling case that Proxima b transits in our precise photometric time\nseries. Imposing an informative prior on the period and phase, we do detect a\ncandidate signal with the expected depth. However, perturbing the phase prior\nacross 100 evenly spaced intervals reveals one strong false-positive and one\nweaker instance. We estimate a false-positive rate of at least a few percent\nand a much higher false-negative rate of 20-40%, likely caused by the very high\nflare rate of Proxima Centauri. Comparing our candidate signal to HATSouth\nground-based photometry reveals that the signal is somewhat, but not\nconclusively, disfavored (1-2 sigmas) leading us to argue that the signal is\nmost likely spurious. We expect that infrared photometric follow-up could more\nconclusively test the existence of this candidate signal, owing to the\nsuppression of flare activity and the impressive infrared brightness of the\nparent star.\n", "  I calculate the rate of WIMP capture and annihilation in the Earth in the\nnon-relativistic effective theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions.\nNeglecting operator interference, I consider all Galilean invariant interaction\noperators that can arise from the exchange of a heavy particle of spin less\nthan or equal to one when WIMPs have spin 0, 1/2 or 1. I compute position and\nshape of the expected resonances in the mass - capture rate plane and show that\nIron is not the most important element in the capture process for many\ncurrently ignored interaction operators. I compare these predictions with the\nrecent results of an Earth WIMP analysis of IceCube in the 86-string\nconfiguration and set limits on all isoscalar and isovector coupling constants\nof the effective theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions. For certain\ninteraction operators and for a dark matter particle mass of about 50 GeV, I\nfind that these limits are stronger than those I have previously derived in an\nanalysis of the solar WIMP search performed at IceCube in the 79-string\nconfiguration.\n", "  The fisherman caught a quantum fish. \"Fisherman, please let me go\", begged\nthe fish, \"and I will grant you three wishes\". The fisherman agreed. The fish\ngave the fisherman a quantum computer, three quantum signing tokens and his\nclassical public key. The fish explained: \"to sign your three wishes, use the\ntokenized signature scheme on this quantum computer, then show your valid\nsignature to the king, who owes me a favor\".\n  The fisherman used one of the signing tokens to sign the document \"give me a\ncastle!\" and rushed to the palace. The king executed the classical verification\nalgorithm using the fish's public key, and since it was valid, the king\ncomplied.\n  The fisherman's wife wanted to sign ten wishes using their two remaining\nsigning tokens. The fisherman did not want to cheat, and secretly sailed to\nmeet the fish. \"Fish, my wife wants to sign ten more wishes\". But the fish was\nnot worried: \"I have learned quantum cryptography following the previous story\n(The Fisherman and His Wife by the brothers Grimm). The quantum tokens are\nconsumed during the signing. Your polynomial wife cannot even sign four wishes\nusing the three signing tokens I gave you\".\n  \"How does it work?\" wondered the fisherman. \"Have you heard of quantum money?\nThese are quantum states which can be easily verified but are hard to copy.\nThis tokenized quantum signature scheme extends Aaronson and Christiano's\nquantum money scheme, which is why the signing tokens cannot be copied\".\n  \"Does your scheme have additional fancy properties?\" the fisherman asked.\n\"Yes, the scheme has other security guarantees: revocability, testability and\neverlasting security. Furthermore, if you're at sea and your quantum phone has\nonly classical reception, you can use this scheme to transfer the value of the\nquantum money to shore\", said the fish, and swam away.\n", "  A search for supersymmetry is performed in events with a single electron or\nmuon in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data\nwere recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC and correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. Several exclusive search regions are\ndefined based on the number of jets and b-tagged jets, the scalar sum of the\njet transverse momenta, and the scalar sum of the missing transverse momentum\nand the transverse momentum of the lepton. The observed event yields in data\nare consistent with the expected backgrounds from standard model processes. The\nresults are interpreted using two simplified models of supersymmetric particle\nspectra, both of which describe gluino pair production. In the first model,\neach gluino decays via a three-body process to top quarks and a neutralino,\nwhich is associated with the observed missing transverse momentum in the event.\nGluinos with masses up to 1.6 TeV are excluded for neutralino masses below 600\nGeV. In the second model, each gluino decays via a three-body process to two\nlight quarks and a chargino, which subsequently decays to a W boson and a\nneutralino. The mass of the chargino is taken to be midway between the gluino\nand neutralino masses. In this model, gluinos with masses below 1.4 TeV are\nexcluded for neutralino masses below 700 GeV.\n", "  We present first-principles total-energy electronic-structure calculations\nthat provide the microscopic mechanism of the Ag atom diffusion between the\nhalf unit cells (HUCs) on the Si(111)-(7x7) surface with and without the tip of\nthe atomic force microscope (AFM). We find that, without the presence of the\nAFM tip, the diffusions between the two HUCs are almost symmetric with the\nenergy barrier of about 1 eV in the both directions. The diffusion is a\ntwo-step process with an intermediate metastable configuration in which the Ag\natom is at the boundary of the HUCs. With the presence of the tip, we find that\nthe reaction pathways are essentially the same, but the energy barrier in one\ndirection is substantially reduced to be 0.2 - 0.4 eV by the tip, while that of\nthe diffusion in the reverse direction remains larger than 1 eV. The Si tip\nreduces the energy barrier more than the Pt tip due to the flexibility of the\ntip apex structure. In addition to the reduction of the barrier, the tip traps\nthe diffusing adatom preventing the diffusion in the reverse direction. Also we\nfind that the shape of the tip apex structure is important for the trapping\nability of the adatom. When the tip apex structure is blunt, the adatom\ninteracts with the tip atom other than the tip apex atom. The bond formation\nbetween the AFM tip atom and the surface adatom is essential for the atom\nmanipulation using the AFM tip. Our results show that the atom manipulation is\npossible with both the metallic and semiconducting AFM tips.\n", "  We introduce a time evolution algorithm for one-dimensional quantum field\ntheories with periodic boundary conditions. This is done by applying the\nDirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle to the set of translational\ninvariant continuous matrix product states with periodic boundary conditions.\nMoreover, the ansatz is accompanied with additional boundary degrees of freedom\nto study quantum impurity problems. The algorithm allows for a cutoff in the\nspectrum of the transfer matrix and thus has an efficient computational\nscaling. In particular we study the prototypical example of an atomtronic\nsystem - an interacting Bose gas rotating in a ring shaped trap in the presence\nof a localised barrier potential.\n", "  New massive resonances are predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model\n(SM) of particle physics and constitutes one of the most promising searches for\nnew physics at the LHC. We present a feasibility study to search for new heavy\nneutral gauge bosons using vector boson fusion (VBF) processes, which become\nespecially important as the LHC probes higher collision energies. In\nparticular, we consider the possibility that the discovery of a $Z'$ boson may\nhave eluded searches at the LHC. The coupling of the $Z'$ boson to the SM\nquarks can be small, and thus the $Z'$ would not be discoverable by the\nsearches conducted thus far. In the context of a simplified phenomenological\napproach, we consider the $Z'\\to\\tau\\tau$ and $Z'\\to\\mu\\mu$ decay modes to show\nthat the requirement of a dilepton pair combined with two high $p_{T}$ forward\njets with large separation in pseudorapidity and with large dijet mass is\neffective in reducing SM backgrounds. The expected exclusion bounds (at 95\\%\nconfidence level) are $m(Z') < 1.8$ TeV and $m(Z') < 2.5$ TeV in the $\\tau\\tau\nj_{f}j_{f}$ and $\\mu\\mu j_{f}j_{f}$ channels, respectively, assuming 1000\nfb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV data from the LHC. The use of the VBF topology to search\nfor massive neutral gauge bosons provides a discovery reach with expected\nsignificances greater than 5$\\sigma$ (3$\\sigma$) for $Z'$ masses up to 1.4\n(1.6) TeV and 2.0 (2.2) TeV in the $\\tau\\tau j_{f}j_{f}$ and $\\mu\\mu\nj_{f}j_{f}$ channels.\n", "  We report on a study of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization and electron and nuclear\nspin relaxation of atomic hydrogen and deuterium in solid molecular matrices of\nH$_{2}$, D$_{2}$, and HD mixtures. The electron and nuclear spin relaxation\ntimes ($T_{1e}$ and $T_{1N}$) were measured within the temperature range\n0.15-2.5$\\,$K in a magnetic field of 4.6 T, conditions which ensure a high\npolarization of electron spins. We found that $T_{1e}$ is nearly temperature\nindependent in this temperature range, while $T_{1N}$ decreased by 2 orders of\nmagnitude. Such strong temperature dependence is typical for the nuclear Orbach\nmechanism of relaxation via the electron spins. We found that the nuclear spins\nof H atoms in solid D$_{2}$ and D$_{2}:$HD can be efficiently polarized by the\nOverhauser effect. Pumping the forbidden transitions of H atoms also leads to\nDNP, with the efficiency strongly dependent on the concentration of D atoms.\nThis behaviour indicates the Cross effect mechanism of the DNP and nuclear\nrelaxation, which turns out to be well resolved in the conditions of our\nexperiments. Efficient DNP of H atoms was also observed when pumping the middle\nD line located in center of the ESR spectrum. This phenomenon can be explained\nin terms of clusters or pairs of H atoms with strong exchange interaction.\nThese clusters have partially allowed transitions in the center of the ESR\nspectrum and DNP may be created via the resolved Cross effect.\n", "  We perform the covariant canonical quantization of the CPT- and\nLorentz-symmetry-violating photon sector of the minimal Standard-Model\nExtension, which contains a general (timelike, lightlike, or spacelike) fixed\nbackground tensor $k_{AF}^\\mu$. Well-known stability issues, arising from\ncomplex-valued energy states, are solved by introducing a small photon mass,\norders of magnitude below current experimental bounds. We explicitly construct\na covariant basis of polarization vectors, in which the photon field can be\nexpanded. We proceed to derive the Feynman propagator and show that the theory\nis microcausal. Despite the occurrence of negative energies and\nvacuum-Cherenkov radiation, we do not find any runaway stability issues,\nbecause the energy remains bounded from below. An important observation is that\nthe ordering of the roots of the dispersion relations is the same in any\nobserver frame, which allows for a frame-independent condition that selects the\ncorrect branch of the dispersion relation. This turns out to be critical for\nthe consistency of the quantization. To our knowledge, this is the first system\nfor which quantization has consistently been performed, in spite of the fact\nthat the theory contains negative energies in some observer frames.\n", "  We study the thermal transport properties of general conformal field theories\n(CFTs) on curved spacetimes in the leading order viscous hydrodynamic limit. At\nthe level of linear response, we show that the thermal transport is governed by\na system of forced linearised Navier-Stokes equations on a curved space. Our\nsetup includes CFTs in flat spacetime that have been deformed by spatially\ndependent and periodic local temperature variations or strains that have been\napplied to the CFT, and hence is relevant to CFTs arising in condensed matter\nsystems at zero charge density. We provide specific examples of deformations\nwhich lead to thermal backflow driven by a DC source: that is, the thermal\ncurrents locally flow in the opposite direction to the applied DC thermal\nsource. We also consider thermal transport for relativistic quantum field\ntheories that are not conformally invariant.\n", "  Results on two-particle $\\Delta\\eta\\Delta\\phi$ correlations in inelastic p+p\ninteractions at 20, 31, 40, 80, and 158~GeV/c are presented. The measurements\nwere performed using the large acceptance NA61/SHINE hadron spectrometer at the\nCERN Super Proton Synchrotron. The data show structures which can be attributed\nmainly to effects of resonance decays, momentum conservation, and quantum\nstatistics. The results are compared with the EPOS and UrQMD models.\n", "  The generalized $H(n)$ Hirsch index of order $n$ has been recently introduced\nand shown to interpolate between the degree and the $K$-core centrality in\nnetworks. We provide a detailed analytical characterization of the properties\nof sets of nodes having the same $H(n)$, within the annealed network\napproximation. The connection between the Hirsch indices and the degree is\nhighlighted. Numerical tests in synthetic uncorrelated networks and real-world\ncorrelated ones validate the findings. We also test the use of the Hirsch index\nfor the identification of influential spreaders in networks, finding that it is\nin general outperformed by the recently introduced Non-Backtracking centrality.\n", "  The EXTraS project to explore the X-ray Transient and variable Sky searches\nfor coherent signals in the X-ray archival data of XMM-Newton. XMM-Newton\nperformed more than 400 pointed observations in the region of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC). We inspected the results of the EXTraS period search to\nsystematically look for new X-ray pulsators in our neighbour galaxy. We\nanalysed the XMM-Newton observations of two sources from the 3XMM catalogue\nwhich show significant signals for coherent pulsations. 3XMM J051259.8-682640\nwas detected as source with hard X-ray spectrum in two XMM-Newton observations,\nrevealing a periodic modulation of the X-ray flux with 956~s. As optical\ncounterpart we identify an early-type star with Halpha emission. The OGLE\nI-band light curve exhibits a regular pattern with three brightness dips which\nmark a period of ~1350 d. The X-ray spectrum of 3XMM J051034.6-670353 is\ndominated by a super-soft blackbody-like emission component (kT ~ 70 eV) which\nis modulated by nearly 100% with a period of ~1418 s. From GROND observations\nwe suggest a star with r' = 20.9 mag as possible counterpart of the X-ray\nsource. 3XMM J051259.8-682640 is confirmed as a new Be/X-ray binary pulsar in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud. We discuss the long-term optical period as likely\norbital period which would be the longest known from a high-mass X-ray binary.\nThe spectral and temporal properties of the super-soft source 3XMM\nJ051034.6-670353 are very similar to those of RX J0806.3+1527 and RX\nJ1914.4+2456 suggesting that it belongs to the class of double-degenerate\npolars and is located in our Galaxy rather than in the LMC.\n", "  We present a lattice QCD study of $N\\pi$ scattering in the positive-parity\nnucleon channel, where the puzzling Roper resonance $N^*(1440)$ resides in\nexperiment. The study is based on the PACS-CS ensemble of gauge configurations\nwith $N_f=2+1$ Wilson-clover dynamical fermions, $m_\\pi \\simeq 156~$MeV and\n$L\\simeq 2.9~$fm. In addition to a number of $qqq$ interpolating fields, we\nimplement operators for $N\\pi$ in $p$-wave and $N\\sigma$ in $s$-wave. In the\ncenter-of-momentum frame we find three eigenstates below 1.65 GeV. They are\ndominated by $N(0)$, $N(0)\\pi(0)\\pi(0)$ (mixed with $N(0)\\sigma(0)$) and\n$N(p)\\pi(-p)$ with $p\\simeq 2\\pi/L$, where momenta are given in parentheses.\nThis is the first simulation where the expected multi-hadron states are found\nin this channel. The experimental $N\\pi$ phase-shift would -- in the\napproximation of purely elastic $N\\pi$ scattering -- imply an additional\neigenstate near the Roper mass $m_R\\simeq 1.43~$GeV for our lattice size. We do\nnot observe any such additional eigenstate, which indicates that $N\\pi$ elastic\nscattering alone does not render a low-lying Roper. Coupling with other\nchannels, most notably with $N\\pi\\pi$, seems to be important for generating the\nRoper resonance, reinforcing the notion that this state could be a dynamically\ngenerated resonance. Our results are in line with most of previous lattice\nstudies based just on $qqq$ interpolators, that did not find a Roper eigenstate\nbelow $1.65~$GeV. The study of the coupled-channel scattering including a\nthree-particle decay $N\\pi\\pi$ remains a challenge.\n", "  Ionised gas outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are ubiquitous in\nhigh luminosity AGN with outflow speeds apparently correlated with the total\nbolometric luminosity of the AGN. This empirical relation and theoretical work\nsuggest that in the range L_bol ~ 10^43-45 erg/s there must exist a threshold\nluminosity above which the AGN becomes powerful enough to launch winds that\nwill be able to escape the galaxy potential. In this paper, we present pilot\nobservations of two AGN in this transitional range that were taken with the\nGemini North Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit (IFU). Both sources\nhave also previously been observed within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV\n(SDSS) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey.\nWhile the MaNGA IFU maps probe the gas fields on galaxy-wide scales and show\nthat some regions are dominated by AGN ionization, the new Gemini IFU data zoom\ninto the centre with four times better spatial resolution. In the object with\nthe lower L_bol we find evidence of a young or stalled biconical AGN-driven\noutflow where none was obvious at the MaNGA resolution. In the object with the\nhigher L_bol we trace the large-scale biconical outflow into the nuclear region\nand connect the outflow from small to large scales. These observations suggest\nthat AGN luminosity and galaxy potential are crucial in shaping wind launching\nand propagation in low-luminosity AGN. The transition from small and young\noutflows to galaxy-wide feedback can only be understood by combining\nlarge-scale IFU data that trace the galaxy velocity field with higher\nresolution, small scale IFU maps.\n", "  We investigate the effect of magnetic field and charge noise on the\ngeneration of entanglement between two Heisenberg exchange-coupled electron\nspins in a double quantum dot. We focus on exchange-driven evolution that would\nideally take an initial unentangled tensor product state to a\nmaximally-entangled state in the absence of noise. The presence of noise\nobviously adversely affects the attainment of maximal entanglement, which we\nstudy quantitatively and exactly. To quantify the effects of noise, we\ncalculate two-qubit coherence times and entanglement fidelity, both of which\ncan be extracted from simulations or measurements of the return probability as\na function of interaction time, i.e., the time period during which the exchange\ncoupling remains effective between the two spins. We perform these calculations\nfor a broad range of noise strengths that includes the regime of recent\nexperiments. We find that the two types of noise reduce the amount of\nentanglement in qualitatively distinct ways and that, although charge noise\ngenerally leads to faster decoherence, the relative importance of the two types\nof noise in entanglement creation depends sensitively on the strength of the\nexchange coupling. Our results can be used to determine the level of noise\nsuppression needed to reach quantum error correction thresholds. We provide\nquantitative guidance for the requisite noise constraints necessary to\neventually reach the $>99\\%$ fidelity consistent with the quantum error\ncorrection threshold.\n", "  Recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the extragalactic radio\nsource Centaurus A (Cen A) display a young stellar population around the\nsouthwest tip of the inner filament 8.5 kpc from the Cen A galactic center,\nwith ages in the range of 1-3 Myr. Crockett et al. (2012) argue that the\ntransverse bow shock of the Cen A jet triggered this star formation as it\nimpacted dense molecular cores of clouds in the filament. To test this\nhypothesis, we perform three-dimensional numerical simulations of induced star\nformation by the jet bow shock in the inner filament of Cen A, using a\npositivity preserving WENO method to solve the equations of gas dynamics with\nradiative cooling. We find that star clusters form inside a bow-shocked\nmolecular cloud when the maximum initial density of the cloud is > 40 H2\nmolecules/cm^3. In a typical molecular cloud of mass 10^6 M_sun and diameter\n200 pc, approximately 20 star clusters of mass 10^4 M_sun are formed, matching\nthe HST images.\n", "  We present a design for a near-ultraviolet (NUV) imaging instrument which may\nbe flown on a range of available platforms, including high-altitude balloons,\nnanosatellites, or space missions. Although all current UV space missions adopt\na Ritchey-Chretain telescope design, this requires aspheric optics, making the\noptical system complex, expensive and challenging for manufacturing and\nalignment. An all-spherical configuration is a cost-effective and simple\nsolution. We have aimed for a small payload which may be launched by different\nplatforms and we have designed a compact, light-weight payload which will\nwithstand all launch loads. No other UV payloads have been previously reported\nwith an all-spherical optical design for imaging in the NUV domain and a weight\nbelow 2 kg. Our main science goal is focussed on bright UV sources not\naccessible by the more sensitive large space UV missions.\n  Here we discuss various aspects of design and development of the complete\ninstrument, the structural and finite-element analysis of the system performed\nto ensure that the payload withstands launch-load stresses and vibrations. We\nexpect to fly this telescope -- Lunar Ultraviolet Cosmic Imager (LUCI) -- on a\nspacecraft to the Moon as part of the Indian entry into Google X-Prize\ncompetition. Observations from the Moon provide a unique opportunity to observe\nthe sky from a stable platform far above the Earth's atmosphere. However, we\nwill explore other opportunities as well, and will fly this telescope on a\nhigh-altitude balloon later this year.\n", "  We discuss a fluid model with inclusion of the complete pressure tensor\ndynamics for the description of Weibel type instabilities in a counterstreaming\nbeams configuration. Differently from the case recently studied in Sarrat et\nal. 2016, where perturbations perpendicular to the beams were considered, here\nwe focus only on modes propagating along the beams. Such a configuration is\nresponsible for the growth of two kind of instabilities, the Two-Stream\nInstability and the Weibel instability, which in this geometry becomes\n\"time-resonant\", i.e. propagative. This fluid description agrees with the\nkinetic one and makes it possible e.g. to identify the transition between\nnon-propagative and propagative Weibel modes, already evidenced by Lazar et al.\n2009 as a \"slope-breaking\" of the growth rate, in terms of a merger of two non\npropagative Weibel modes.\n", "  We investigate whether the inclusion of baryonic physics influences the\nformation of thin, coherently rotating planes of satellites such as those seen\naround the Milky Way and Andromeda. For four Milky Way-mass simulations, each\nrun both as dark matter-only and with baryons included, we are able to identify\na planar configuration that significantly maximizes the number of plane\nsatellite members. The maximum plane member satellites are consistently\ndifferent between the dark matter-only and baryonic versions of the same run\ndue to the fact that satellites are both more likely to be destroyed and to\ninfall later in the baryonic runs. Hence, studying satellite planes in dark\nmatter-only simulations is misleading, because they will be composed of\ndifferent satellite members than those that would exist if baryons were\nincluded. Additionally, the destruction of satellites in the baryonic runs\nleads to less radially concentrated satellite distributions, a result that is\ncritical to making planes that are statistically significant compared to a\nrandom distribution. Since all planes pass through the centre of the galaxy, it\nis much harder to create a plane from a random distribution if the satellites\nhave a low radial concentration. We identify Andromeda's low radial satellite\nconcentration as a key reason why the plane in Andromeda is highly significant.\nDespite this, when co-rotation is considered, none of the satellite planes\nidentified for the simulated galaxies are as statistically significant as the\nobserved planes around the Milky Way and Andromeda, even in the baryonic runs.\n", "  In this paper we revisit the striped wind model in which the wind is\naccelerated by magnetic reconnection. In our treatment, radiation is included\nas an independent component, and two scenarios are considered. In the first\none, radiation cannot stream efficiently through the reconnection layer, while\nthe second scenario assumes that radiation is homogeneous in the striped wind.\nWe show how these two assumptions affect the dynamics. In particular, we find\nthat the asymptotic radial evolution of the Lorentz factor is not strongly\nmodified whether radiation can stream through the reconnection layer or not. On\nthe other hand, we show that the width, density and temperature of the\nreconnection layer are strongly dependent on these assumptions. We then apply\nthe model to the gamma-ray burst context and find that photons cannot diffuse\nefficiently through the reconnection layer below radius $r_{\\rm D}^{\\Delta}\n\\sim 10^{10.5}$ cm, which is about an order of magnitude below the photospheric\nradius. Above $r_{\\rm D}^{\\Delta}$, the dynamics asymptotes to the solution of\nthe scenario in which radiation can stream through the reconnection layer. As a\nresult, the density of the current sheet increases sharply, providing efficient\nphoton production by the Bremsstrahlung process which could have profound\ninfluence on the emerging spectrum. This effect might provide a solution to the\nsoft photon problem in GRBs.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering is used to study the low-energy magnetic\nexcitations in the spin-1 triangular lattice of the 6H-B phase of\nBa$_3$NiSb$_2$O$_9$. We study two powder samples: Ba$_3$NiSb$_2$O$_9$\nsynthesized under high pressure and Ba$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$NiSb$_2$O$_9$ in which\nchemical pressure stabilizes the 6H-B structure. The measured excitation\nspectra show broad gapless and nondispersive continua at characteristic wave\nvectors. Our data rules out most theoretical scenarios that have previously\nbeen proposed for this phase, and we find that it is well described by an\nexotic quantum spin liquid with three flavors of unpaired fermionic spinons,\nforming a large spinon Fermi surface.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the effects of backscattering and\nsuperconducting proximity terms between the edges of two multi-layer fractional\nquantum Hall (FQH) systems. While the different layers are strongly\ninteracting, we assume that tunneling between them is absent. Studying the\nboundaries between regions gapped by the two mechanisms in an $N$-layer system,\nwe find $N$ localized zero-mode operators realizing a generalized parafermionic\nalgebra. We further propose an experiment capable of probing imprints of the\ngeneralized parafermionic bound states. This is done by coupling different\nsuperconducting contacts to different layers, and examining the periodicity of\nthe Josephson effect as a function of the various relative superconducting\nphases. Remarkably, even if we apply a phase difference between the\nsuperconductors in one layer, we induce a Josephson current at the other layers\ndue to inter-layer interactions. Furthermore, while the Josephson effect is\ncommonly used to probe only charged degrees of freedom, the possibility of\nindependently controlling the superconducting phase differences between the\nlayers allows us to find imprints of the neutral modes of the underlying\nmulti-layer system. In particular, we propose two configurations, one of which\nis capable of isolating the signal associated with the charge modes, while the\nother probes the neutral modes.\n", "  HR8799 is orbited by at least four giant planets, making it a prime target\nfor the recently commissioned Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet\nREsearch (VLT/SPHERE). As such, it was observed on five consecutive nights\nduring the SPHERE science verification in December 2014. We aim to take full\nadvantage of the SPHERE capabilities to derive accurate astrometric\nmeasurements based on H-band images acquired with the Infra-Red Dual-band\nImaging and Spectroscopy (IRDIS) subsystem, and to explore the ultimate\nastrometric performance of SPHERE in this observing mode. We also aim to\npresent a detailed analysis of the orbital parameters for the four planets. We\nreport the astrometric positions for epoch 2014.93 with an accuracy down to 2.0\nmas, mainly limited by the astrometric calibration of IRDIS. For each planet,\nwe derive the posterior probability density functions for the six Keplerian\nelements and identify sets of highly probable orbits. For planet d, there is\nclear evidence for nonzero eccentricity ($e \\simeq 0.35$), without completely\nexcluding solutions with smaller eccentricities. The three other planets are\nconsistent with circular orbits, although their probability distributions\nspread beyond $e = 0.2$, and show a peak at $e \\simeq 0.1$ for planet e. The\nfour planets have consistent inclinations of about $30\\deg$ with respect to the\nsky plane, but the confidence intervals for the longitude of ascending node are\ndisjoint for planets b and c, and we find tentative evidence for\nnon-coplanarity between planets b and c at the $2 \\sigma$ level.\n", "  In low-mass galaxies, stellar feedback can drive gas outflows that generate\nnon-equilibrium fluctuations in the gravitational potential. Using cosmological\nzoom-in baryonic simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE)\nproject, we investigate how these fluctuations affect stellar kinematics and\nthe reliability of Jeans dynamical modeling in low-mass galaxies. We find that\nstellar velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles fluctuate significantly\nover the course of galaxies' starburst cycles. We therefore predict an\nobservable correlation between star formation rate and stellar kinematics:\ndwarf galaxies with higher recent star formation rates should have systemically\nhigher stellar velocity dispersions. This prediction provides an observational\ntest of the role of stellar feedback in regulating both stellar and dark-matter\ndensities in dwarf galaxies. We find that Jeans modeling, which treats galaxies\nas virialized systems in dynamical equilibrium, overestimates a galaxy's\ndynamical mass during periods of post-starburst gas outflow and underestimates\nit during periods of net inflow. Short-timescale potential fluctuations lead to\ntypical errors of $\\sim 20\\%$ in dynamical mass estimates, even if full\n3-dimensional stellar kinematics -- including the orbital anisotropy -- are\nknown exactly. When orbital anisotropy is $\\textit{not}$ known a priori,\ntypical mass errors arising from non-equilibrium fluctuations in the potential\nare larger than those arising from the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. However,\nJeans modeling alone $\\textit{cannot}$ reliably constrain the orbital\nanisotropy, and problematically, it often favors anisotropy models that do not\nreflect the true profile. If galaxies completely lose their gas and cease\nforming stars, fluctuations in the potential subside, and Jeans modeling\nbecomes much more reliable.\n", "  We present an instability for exciting incompressible modes (e.g. gravity or\nRossby modes) at the surface of a star accreting through a boundary layer. The\ninstability excites a stellar mode by sourcing an acoustic wave in the disk at\nthe boundary layer, which carries a flux of energy and angular momentum with\nthe opposite sign as the energy and angular momentum density of the stellar\nmode. We call this instability the acoustic CFS instability, because of the\ndirect analogy to the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability for exciting\nmodes on a rotating star by emission of energy in the form of gravitational\nwaves. However, the acoustic CFS instability differs from its gravitational\nwave counterpart in that the fluid medium in which the acoustic wave propagates\n(i.e.\\ the accretion disk) typically rotates faster than the star in which the\nincompressible mode is sourced. For this reason, the instability can operate\neven for a non-rotating star in the presence of an accretion disk. We discuss\napplications of our results to high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in\naccreting black hole and neutron star systems and dwarf nova oscillations in\ncataclysmic variables.\n", "  By taking into account the charge and spin orderings and the exchange\ninteractions between all the Landau levels, we investigate the integer quantum\nHall effect of electrons in graphene using the mean-field theory. At the\nfillings $\\nu = 4n+2$ with $n = 0, 1, \\cdots$, the system is in the\nhigh-symmetry state with the Landau levels four-fold degenerated. We show that\nwith doping the degenerated lowest empty levels can be sequentially filled one\nlevel by one level, the filled level is lower than the empty ones because of\nthe symmetry breaking. This result explains the step $\\Delta\\nu$ = 1 in the\ninteger quantized Hall conductivity of the experimental observations. We also\npresent in the supplemental material a high efficient method for dealing with\nhuge number of the Coulomb couplings between all the levels.\n", "  We study a variation of the Krauss-Nasri-Trodden (KNT) model with a colored\ntriplet scalar field and a colored singlet scalar field, in which we discuss\nthe anomaly coming from $b\\to s\\mu\\bar\\mu$, fitting to the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment and the relic density of the Majorana-type dark matter\ncandidate, as well as satisfying various constraints such as lepton-flavor\nviolations and flavor-changing neutral currents. Also, we discuss the direct\nconstraints from the collider searches and the possibilities of detecting the\nnew fields at the LHC.\n", "  The event-averaged charge state of heavy ion Solar Energetic Particles\n(SEPs), measured at 1 AU from the Sun, typically increases with the ions'\nkinetic energy. The origin of this behaviour has been ascribed to processes\ntaking place within the acceleration region. In this paper we study the\npropagation through interplanetary space of SEP Fe ions, injected near the Sun\nwith a variety of charge states that are uniformly distributed in energy, by\nmeans of a 3D test particle model. In our simulations, due to gradient and\ncurvature drifts associated with the Parker spiral magnetic field, ions of\ndifferent charge propagate with very different efficiencies to an observer that\nis not magnetically well connected to the source region. As a result we find\nthat, for many observer locations, the 1 AU event-averaged charge state <Q>, as\nobtained from our model, displays an increase with particle energy E, in\nqualitative agreement with spacecraft observations. We conclude that\ndrift-associated propagation is a possible explanation for the observed\ndistribution of <Q> versus E in SEP events, and that the distribution measured\nin interplanetary space cannot be taken to represent that at injection.\n", "  Results are reported from a search for R-parity violating supersymmetry in\nproton-proton collision events collected by the CMS experiment at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an\nintegrated luminosity of 17.6 inverse femtobarns. This search assumes a minimal\nflavor violating model in which the lightest supersymmetric particle is a\nlong-lived neutralino or gluino, leading to a signal with jets emanating from\ndisplaced vertices. In a sample of events with two displaced vertices, no\nexcess yield above the expectation from standard model processes is observed,\nand limits are placed on the pair production cross section as a function of\nmass and lifetime of the neutralino or gluino. At 95% confidence level, the\nanalysis excludes cross sections above approximately 1 fb for neutralinos or\ngluinos with mass between 400 and 1500 GeV and mean proper decay length between\n1 and 30 mm. Gluino masses are excluded below 1 and 1.3 TeV for mean proper\ndecay lengths of 300 micrometers and 1 mm, respectively, and below 1.4 TeV for\nthe range 2-30 mm. The results are also applicable to other models in which\nlong-lived particles decay into multijet final states.\n", "  We present solutions of the BCS gap equation in the channels ${}^1S_0$ and\n${}^3P_2-{}^3F_2$ in neutron matter based on nuclear interactions derived\nwithin chiral effective field theory (EFT). Our studies are based on a\nrepresentative set of nonlocal nucleon-nucleon (NN) plus three-nucleon (3N)\ninteractions up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) as well as\nlocal and semilocal chiral NN interactions up to N$^2$LO and N$^4$LO,\nrespectively. In particular, we investigate for the first time the impact of\nsubleading 3N forces at N$^3$LO on pairing gaps and also derive uncertainty\nestimates by taking into account results for pairing gaps at different orders\nin the chiral expansion. Finally, we discuss different methods for obtaining\nself-consistent solutions of the gap equation. Besides the widely-used\nquasi-linear method by Khodel et al. we demonstrate that the modified Broyden\nmethod is well applicable and exhibits a robust convergence behavior. In\ncontrast to Khodel's method it is based on a direct iteration of the gap\nequation without imposing an auxiliary potential and is straightforward to\nimplement.\n", "  In an atmosphere, a cloud condensation region is characterized by a strong\nvertical gradient in the abundance of the related condensing species. On Earth,\nthe ensuing gradient of mean molecular weight has relatively few dynamical\nconsequences because N$_2$ is heavier than water vapor, so that only the\nrelease of latent heat significantly impacts convection. On the contrary, in an\nhydrogen dominated atmosphere (e.g. giant planets), all condensing species are\nsignificantly heavier than the background gas. This can stabilize the\natmosphere against convection near a cloud deck if the enrichment in the given\nspecies exceeds a critical threshold. This raises two questions. What is\ntransporting energy in such a stabilized layer, and how affected can the\nthermal profile of giant planets be? To answer these questions, we first carry\nout a linear analysis of the convective and double-diffusive instabilities in a\ncondensable medium showing that an efficient condensation can suppress\ndouble-diffusive convection. This suggests that a stable radiative layer can\nform near a cloud condensation level, leading to an increase in the temperature\nof the deep adiabat. Then, we investigate the impact of the condensation of the\nmost abundant species---water---with a steady-state atmosphere model. Compared\nto standard models, the temperature increase can reach several hundred degrees\nat the quenching depth of key chemical tracers. Overall, this effect could have\nmany implications for our understanding of the dynamical and chemical state of\nthe atmosphere of giant planets, for their future observations (with Juno for\nexample), and for their internal evolution.\n", "  We examine some of the roots of parity violation for gravitons and uncover a\nclosely related new effect: correlations between right and left handed\ngravitons. Such correlators have spin 4 if they involve gravitons moving along\nthe same direction, and spin zero for gravitons moving with opposite\ndirections. In the first case, the most immediate implication would be a degree\nof linear polarization for the tensor vacuum fluctuations, which could be seen\nby gravity wave detectors sensitive enough to probe the primordial background,\nits degree of polarization and anisotropies. Looking at the anisotropy of the\ngravity waves linear polarization we identify the parity respecting and\nviolating components of the effect. The imprint on the CMB temperature and\npolarization would be more elusive, since it averages to zero in the two-point\nfunctions, appearing only in their cosmic variance or in fourth order\ncorrelators. In contrast, spin zero correlations would have an effect on the\ntwo point function of the CMB temperature and polarization, enhancing the $BB$\ncomponent if they were anti-correlations. Such correlations represent an\namplitude for the production of standing waves, as first envisaged by\nGrishchuk, and could also leave an interesting signature for gravity wave\ndetectors.\n", "  In this work, a generic rigorous Bayesian formalism is introduced to predict\nthe most likely path of any ion crossing a medium between two detection points.\nThe path is predicted based on a combination of the particle scattering in the\nmaterial and measurements of its initial and final position, direction and\nenergy. The path estimate's precision is compared to the Monte Carlo simulated\npath. Every ion from hydrogen to carbon is simulated in two scenarios to\nestimate the accuracy achievable: one where the range is fixed and one where\nthe initial velocity is fixed. In the scenario where the range is kept\nconstant, the maximal root-mean-square error between the estimated path and the\nMonte Carlo path drops significantly between the proton path estimate (0.50 mm)\nand the helium path estimate (0.18 mm), but less so up to the carbon path\nestimate (0.09 mm). In the scenario where the initial velocity is kept\nconstant, helium have systematically the minimal root-mean-square error\nthroughout the path. As a result, helium is found to be the optimal particle\nfor ion imaging.\n", "  We study the feasibility of probing a region of Natural Supersymmetry where\nthe stop and higgsino masses are compressed. Although this region is most\neffectively searched for in the mono-jet channel, this signature is present in\nmany other non-supersymmetric frameworks. Therefore, another channel that\ncarries orthogonal information is required to confirm the existence of the\nlight stop and higgsinos. We show that a supersymmetric version of the $t \\bar\nt H$ process, $pp \\to t \\tilde t_1 \\tilde \\chi^0_{1(2)}$, can have observably\nlarge rate when both the stop and higgsinos are significantly light, and it\nleads to a distinctive mono-top signature in the compressed mass region. We\ndemonstrate that the hadronic channel of the mono-top signature can effectively\ndiscriminate the signal from backgrounds by tagging a hadronic top-jet. We show\nthat the hadronic channel of mono-top signature offers a significant\nimprovement over the leptonic channel and the sensitivity reaches $m_{\\tilde\nt_1} \\simeq 420$ GeV at the 13 TeV LHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity.\n", "  We construct a numerical solution of the small-$x$ evolution equations\nrecently derived in \\cite{Kovchegov:2015pbl} for the (anti)quark helicity TMDs\nand PDFs as well as the $g_1$ structure function. We focus on the case of large\n$N_c$ where one finds a closed set of equations. Employing the extracted\nintercept, we are able to predict directly from theory the behavior of the\nhelicity PDFs at small $x$, which should have important phenomenological\nconsequences. We also give an estimate of how much of the proton's spin may be\nat small $x$ and what impact this has on the so-called \"spin crisis.\"\n", "  We extend our earlier results for the quark helicity evolution at small $x$\nto derive the small-$x$ asymptotics of the flavor singlet and flavor\nnon-singlet quark helicity TMDs and PDFs and of the $g_1$ structure function.\nIn the flavor singlet case we re-derive the evolution equations obtained in our\nprevious paper on the subject, performing additional cross-checks of our\nresults. In the flavor non-singlet case we construct new small-$x$ evolution\nequations by employing the large-$N_c$ limit. All evolution equations resum\ndouble-logarithmic powers of $\\alpha_s \\, \\ln^2 (1/x)$ in the\npolarization-dependent evolution along with the single-logarithmic powers of\n$\\alpha_s \\, \\ln (1/x)$ in the unpolarized evolution which includes saturation\neffects. We solve the linearized flavor non-singlet equation analytically,\nobtaining an intercept which agrees with the one calculated earlier by Bartels,\nErmolaev and Ryskin using the infra-red evolution equations. Our numerical\nsolution of the linearized large-$N_c$ evolution equations for the flavor\nsinglet case is presented in the accompanying Letter and is further discussed\nhere.\n", "  While the Lyman-$\\alpha$ ($\\mathrm{Ly}\\alpha$) emission line serves as an\nimportant tool in the study of galaxies at $z\\lesssim 6$, finding Ly$\\alpha$\nemitters (LAE) at significantly higher redshifts has been more challenging,\nprobably because of the increasing neutrality of the intergalactic medium above\n$z\\sim6$. Galaxies with extremely high rest-frame Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent widths,\nEW(Ly$\\alpha$) $\\gtrsim 150$ \\AA{}, at $z>6$ are good candidates for Ly$\\alpha$\nfollow-up observations, and can stand out in multiband imaging surveys because\nof their unusual colors. We have conducted a photometric search for such\nobjects in the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH), and\nreport here the identification of three likely gravitationally-lensed images of\na single LAE candidate at $z\\sim6.3$, behind the galaxy cluster Abell 2261($z =\n0.225$). In the process, we also measured with Keck/MOSFIRE the first\nspectroscopic redshift of a multiply-imaged galaxy behind Abell 2261, at $z =\n3.337$. This allows us to calibrate the lensing model, which in turn is used to\nstudy the properties of the candidate LAE. Population III galaxy spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) model fits to the CLASH broadband photometry of the\npossible LAE provide a slightly better fit than Population I/II models. The\nbest fitted model suggests intrinsic EW(Ly$\\alpha$) $\\approx 160$ \\AA{} after\nabsorption in the interstellar and intergalactic medium. Future spectroscopic\nobservations will examine this prediction as well as shed more light on the\nmorphology of this object, which indicates it may be a merger of two smaller\ngalaxies.\n", "  Precise measurements of the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the\ncosmic microwave background can be used to constrain the annihilation and decay\nof dark matter. In this work, we demonstrate via principal component analysis\nthat the imprint of dark matter decay on the cosmic microwave background can be\napproximately parameterized by a single number for any given dark matter model.\nWe develop a simple prescription for computing this model-dependent\ndetectability factor, and demonstrate how this approach can be used to set\nmodel-independent bounds on a large class of decaying dark matter scenarios. We\nrepeat our analysis for decay lifetimes shorter than the age of the universe,\nallowing us to set constraints on metastable species other than the dark matter\ndecaying at early times, and decays that only liberate a tiny fraction of the\ndark matter mass energy. We set precise bounds and validate our principal\ncomponent analysis using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach and Planck 2015\ndata.\n", "  We present a deformation of the action principle for a free tensor field of\nmixed symmetry (2,1) --the Curtright action, a dual formulation of\nfive-dimensional linearized gravity. It is constructed as the dual theory of\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action linearized around a de Sitter background, and its\nderivation relies on the use of the two-potential formalism as an intermediate\nstep. The resulting action principle is spatially non-local and space-time\ncovariance is not manifest, thus overcoming previous no-go results.\n", "  Quark-Gluon plasmas produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions quickly\nexpand and cool, entering a phase consisting of multiple interacting hadronic\nresonances just below the QCD deconfinement temperature, $T\\sim 155$ MeV.\nNumerical microscopic simulations have emerged as the principal method for\nmodeling the behavior of the hadronic stage of heavy-ion collisions, but the\ntransport properties that characterize these simulations are not well\nunderstood. Methods are presented here for extracting the shear viscosity, and\ntwo transport parameters that emerge in Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics. The\nanalysis is based on studying how the stress-energy tensor responds to velocity\ngradients. Results agree with expectations based on Kubo relations.\n", "  Thermal rate coefficients for the astrochemical reaction C + CH$^+$ $\\to$\nC$_2^+$ + H were computed in the temperature range 20-300 K by using novel rate\ntheory based on ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) on a recently published\nbond-order based potential energy surface and compared with previous Langevin\ncapture model (LCM) and quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations. Results\nshow that there is a significant discrepancy between the RPMD rate coefficients\nand the previous theoretical results which can lead to overestimation of the\nrate coefficients for the title reaction by several orders of magnitude at very\nlow temperatures. We argue that this can be attributed to a very challenging\nenergy profile along the reaction coordinate for the title reaction, not taken\ninto account in extenso by either the LCM or QCT approximation. In the absence\nof any rigorous quantum mechanical or experimental results, the computed RPMD\nrate coefficients represent state-of-the-art estimates to be included in\nastrochemical databases and kinetic networks.\n", "  Observations of dwarf galaxies suggest the presence of large-scale magnetic\nfields. However the size and slow rotation of these galaxies appear\ninsufficient to support a mean-field dynamo action to excite such fields. Here\nwe suggest a new mechanism to explain large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies\nthat are too small to support mean-field dynamo action. The key idea is that we\ndo not identify large-scale and mean magnetic fields. In our scenario the the\nmagnetic structures originate from a small-scale dynamo which produces\nsmall-scale magnetic field in the galactic disc and a galactic wind that\ntransports this field into the galactic halo where the large turbulent\ndiffusion increases the scale and order of the field. As a result, the magnetic\nfield becomes large-scale; however its mean value remains vanishing in a strict\nsense. We verify the idea by numerical modelling of two distinct simplified\nconfigurations, a thin disc model using the no-$z$ approximation, and an\naxisymmetric model using cylindrical $r,z$ coordinates. Each of these allows\nreduction of the problem to two spatial dimensions. Taken together, the models\nsupport the proposition that the general trends will persist in a fully 3D\nmodel. We demonstrate that a pronounced large-scale pattern can develop in the\ngalactic halo for a wide choice of the dynamo governing parameters. We believe\nthat our mechanism can be relevant to explaining the presence of the fields\nobserved in the halos of dwarf galaxies. We emphasize that detailed modelling\nof the proposed scenario needs 3D simulations, and adjustment to the specific\ndynamo governing parameters of dwarf galaxies.\n", "  The spectrum of Weakly-Interacting-Massive-Particle (WIMP) dark matter\ngenerically possesses bound states when the WIMP mass becomes sufficiently\nlarge relative to the mass of the electroweak gauge bosons. The presence of\nthese bound states enhances the annihilation rate via resonances in the\nSommerfeld enhancement, but they can also be produced directly with the\nemission of a low-energy photon. In this work we compute the rate for SU(2)\ntriplet dark matter (the wino) to bind into WIMPonium -- which is possible via\nsingle-photon emission for wino masses above 5 TeV for relative velocity v <\nO(10^{-2}) -- and study the subsequent decays of these bound states. We present\nresults with applications beyond the wino case, e.g. for dark matter inhabiting\na nonabelian dark sector; these include analytic capture and transition rates\nfor general dark sectors in the limit of vanishing force carrier mass,\nefficient numerical routines for calculating positive and negative-energy\neigenstates of a Hamiltonian containing interactions with both massive and\nmassless force carriers, and a study of the scaling of bound state formation in\nthe short-range Hulthen potential. In the specific case of the wino, we find\nthat the rate for bound state formation is suppressed relative to direct\nannihilation, and so provides only a small correction to the overall\nannihilation rate. The soft photons radiated by the capture process and by\nbound state transitions could permit measurement of the dark matter's quantum\nnumbers; for wino-like dark matter, such photons are rare, but might be\nobservable by a future ground-based gamma-ray telescope combining large\neffective area and a low energy threshold.\n", "  Dense monolayers of living cells display intriguing relaxation dynamics,\nreminiscent of soft and glassy materials close to the jamming transition, and\nmigrate collectively when space is available, as in wound healing or in cancer\ninvasion. Here we show that collective cell migration occurs in bursts that are\nsimilar to those recorded in the propagation of cracks, fluid fronts in porous\nmedia and ferromagnetic domain walls. In analogy with these systems, the\ndistribution of activity bursts displays scaling laws that are universal in\ndifferent cell types and for cells moving on different substrates. The main\nfeatures of the invasion dynamics are quantitatively captured by a model of\ninteracting active particles moving in a disordered landscape. Our results\nillustrate that collective motion of living cells is analogous to the\ncorresponding dynamics in driven, but inanimate, systems.\n", "  We investigate dynamics of Gaussian states of continuous variable systems\nunder Gaussianity preserving channels. We introduce a hierarchy of such\nevolutions encompassing Markovian, weakly and strongly non-Markovian processes,\nand provide simple criteria to distinguish between the classes, based on the\ndegree of positivity of intermediate Gaussian maps. We classify all single-mode\nphase-insensitive Gaussian channels according to their non-Markovianity degree,\nand show that weak non-Markovianity has an operational significance as it leads\nto temporary amplification of Gaussian inputs beyond the fundamental quantum\nlimit. Explicit examples and applications are discussed.\n", "  We carry out a realistic simulation of Majorana nanowires in order to\nunderstand the latest high- quality experimental data [H. Zhang et al.,\narXiv:1603.04069 (2016)] and, in the process, develop a comprehensive picture\nfor what physical mechanisms may be operational in realistic nanowires leading\nto discrepancies between minimal theory and experimental observations (e.g.,\nweakness and broadening of the zero-bias peak and breaking of particle-hole\nsymmetry). Our focus is on understanding specific intriguing features in the\ndata, and our goal is to establish matters of principle controlling the physics\nof the best possible nanowires available in current experiments. We identify\ndissipation, finite temperature, multi-sub-band effects, and the finite tunnel\nbarrier as the four most important physical mechanisms controlling the\nzero-bias conductance peak. Our theoretical results including these realistic\neffects agree well with the best available experimental data in ballistic\nnanowires.\n", "  The Georgi-Machacek model extends the Standard Model Higgs sector with the\naddition of isospin-triplet scalar fields in such a way as to preserve the\ncustodial symmetry. The presence of higher-isospin scalars contributing to\nelectroweak symmetry breaking offers the interesting possibility that the\ncouplings of the 125 GeV Higgs boson to both gluons and vector boson pairs\ncould be larger than those of the Standard Model Higgs boson. Constraining this\npossibility using measurements of Higgs production and decay at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider is notoriously problematic if a new, non-Standard Model decay\nmode of the 125 GeV Higgs boson is present. We study an implementation of this\nscenario in which the Georgi-Machacek model is extended by a real singlet\nscalar dark matter candidate, and require that the singlet scalar account for\nall the dark matter in the universe. The combination of the observed dark\nmatter relic density and direct detection constraints exclude singlet scalar\nmasses below about 57 GeV. Higgs measurements are not yet precise enough to be\nvery sensitive to $h\\rightarrow SS$ in the remaining allowed kinematic region,\nso that constraints from Higgs measurements are so far the same as in the GM\nmodel without a singlet scalar. We also find that, above the Higgs pole, a\nsubstantial region of parameter space yielding the correct dark matter relic\ndensity can escape the near-future direct detection experiments DEAP and\nXENON~1T for dark matter masses as low as 120 GeV and even have a direct\ndetection cross section below the neutrino floor for $m_S\\gtrsim 150$ GeV. This\nis in contrast to the singlet scalar dark matter extension of the Standard\nModel, for which these future experiments are expected to exclude dark matter\nmasses above the Higgs pole up to the multi-TeV range.\n", "  The near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 2015 TB145 had a very close encounter with\nEarth at 1.3 lunar distances on October 31, 2015. We obtained 3-band\nmid-infrared observations with the ESO VLT-VISIR instrument and visual\nlightcurves during the close-encounter phase. The NEA has a (most likely)\nrotation period of 2.939 +/- 0.005 hours and the visual lightcurve shows a\npeak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 0.12+/-0.02 mag. We estimate a V-R\ncolour of 0.56+/-0.05 mag from MPC database entries. Applying different phase\nrelations to the available R-/V-band observations produced H_R = 18.6 mag\n(standard H-G calculations) or H_R = 19.2 mag & H_V = 19.8 mag (via the H-G12\nprocedure), with large uncertainties of approximately 1 mag. We performed a\ndetailed thermophysical model analysis by using spherical and ellipsoidal shape\nmodels. The thermal properties are best explained by an equator-on (+/- ~30\ndeg) viewing geometry during our measurements with a thermal inertia in the\nrange 250-700 Jm-2s-0.5K-1 (retrograde rotation) or above 500 Jm-2s-0.5K-1\n(prograde rotation). We find that the NEA has a minimum size of 625 m, a\nmaximum size of just below 700 m, and a slightly elongated shape with a/b ~1.1.\nThe best match to all thermal measurements is found for: (i) Thermal inertia of\n900 Jm-2s-0.5K-1; D_eff = 644 m, p_V = 5.5% (prograde rotation); regolith grain\nsizes of ~50-100 mm; (ii) thermal inertia of 400 Jm-2s-0.5K-1; D_eff = 667 m,\np_V = 5.1% (retrograde rotation); regolith grain sizes of ~10-20 mm. A\nnear-Earth asteroid model (NEATM) confirms an object size well above 600 m,\nsignificantly larger than early estimates based on radar measurements. We give\nrecommendations for improved observing strategies for similar events in the\nfuture.\n", "  Hybrid quantum networks rely on efficient interfacing of dissimilar quantum\nnodes, since elements based on parametric down-conversion sources, quantum\ndots, color centres or atoms are fundamentally different in their frequencies\nand bandwidths. While pulse manipulation has been demonstrated in very\ndifferent systems, to date no interface exists that provides both an efficient\nbandwidth compression and a substantial frequency translation at the same time.\nHere, we demonstrate an engineered sum-frequency-conversion process in Lithium\nNiobate that achieves both goals. We convert pure photons at telecom\nwavelengths to the visible range while compressing the bandwidth by a factor of\n7.47 under preservation of non-classical photon-number statistics. We achieve\ninternal conversion efficiencies of 75.5%, significantly outperforming spectral\nfiltering for bandwidth compression. Our system thus makes the connection\nbetween previously incompatible quantum systems as a step towards usable\nquantum networks.\n", "  The dynamics of the highly excited states of a system projected into a single\nLandau level are analyzed. An analysis of level spacing ratios for finite size\nsystems shows a clear crossover from extend (GUE) to localized (Poisson)\nstatistics, indicating a many body localization transition. However, the\nlocation of this transition depends very strongly on system size, and appears\nto scale to infinite disorder in the thermodynamic limit. This result does not\ndepend on the properties of the ground state (such as whether the ground state\nexhibits topological order), as expected for a transition of highly-excited\neigenstates. We therefore conclude that many body localization does not exist\nin these systems. Our results demonstrate that a sub-thermodynamic number of\nsingle particle effectively extended states is sufficient to cause all many\nbody states to become extended.\n", "  Differential cross sections are presented for the prompt and non-prompt\nproduction of the hidden-charm states $X(3872)$ and $\\psi(2S)$, in the decay\nmode $J/\\psi \\pi^+\\pi^-$, measured using 11.4 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The ratio of\ncross-sections $X(3872)/\\psi(2S)$ is also given, separately for prompt and\nnon-prompt components, as well as the non-prompt fractions of $X(3872)$ and\n$\\psi(2S)$. Assuming independent single effective lifetimes for non-prompt\n$X(3872)$ and $\\psi(2S)$ production gives $R_B = \\frac{\\mathcal{B}(B\n\\rightarrow X(3872)\\textrm{ + any}) \\mathcal{B}(X(3872 \\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-)}{\\mathcal{B}(B \\rightarrow \\psi(2S)\\textrm{ + any})\n\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(2S) \\rightarrow J/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-)} = (3.95 \\pm 0.32\n\\mathrm{(stat)} \\pm 0.08\\mathrm{(sys)}) \\times 10^{-2}$, while separating\nshort- and long-lived contributions, assuming that the short-lived component is\ndue to $B_c$ decays, gives $R_B = (3.57 \\pm 0.33\\mathrm{(stat)} \\pm\n0.11\\mathrm{(sys)}) \\times 10^{-2}$, with the fraction of non-prompt $X(3872)$\nproduced via $B_c$ decays for $p_\\mathrm{T}(X(3872)) > 10$ GeV being $(25 \\pm\n13\\mathrm{(stat)} \\pm 2\\mathrm{(sys)} \\pm 5\\mathrm{(spin)})\\%$. The\ndistributions of the dipion invariant mass in the $X(3872)$ and $\\psi(2S)$\ndecays are also measured and compared to theoretical predictions.\n", "  We have developed, assembled, and flight-proven a stable, compact, and\nautonomous extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) system designed for atomic\nphysics experiments in space. To that end, two micro-integrated ECDLs at 766.7\nnm were frequency stabilized during a sounding rocket flight by means of\nfrequency modulation spectroscopy (FMS) of 39^K and offset locking techniques\nbased on the beat note of the two ECDLs. The frequency stabilization as well as\nadditional hard- and software to test hot redundancy mechanisms were\nimplemented as part of a state-machine, which controlled the experiment\ncompletely autonomously throughout the entire flight mission.\n", "  A system composed of a conducting planar strip with Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling (RSOC), magnetically coupled to a layer of localized magnetic moments,\nat equilibrium, is studied within a microscopic Hamiltonian with numerical\ntechniques at zero temperature in the clean limit. In particular, transport\nproperties for the cases of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM)\ncoupled layers are computed in linear response on strips of varying width. Some\nbehaviors observed for these properties are consistent with the ones observed\nfor the corresponding Rashba helical currents. The case of uncoupled Rashba\nstrips is also studied for comparison. In the case of Rashba strips coupled to\nan AFM localized order, results for the longitudinal dc conductivity, for small\nstrip widths, suggest the proximity to a metal-insulator transition. More\ninteresting, in the proximity of this transition, and in general at\nintermediate values of the RSOC, it is observed a large spin-Hall conductivity\nthat is two orders of magnitude larger than the one for the FM order for the\nsame values of the RSOC and strip widths. There are clearly two different\nregimes for small and for large RSOC, which is also present in the behavior of\nRashba helical currents. Different contributions to the optical and the\nspin-Hall conductivities, according to a new classification of inter- or\nintra-band origin proposed for planar strips in the clean limit, or coming from\nthe hopping or spin-orbit terms of the Hamiltonian, are examined. Finally, the\neffects of different orientation of the coupled magnetic moments will be also\nstudied.\n", "  We propose to utilize symmetry-protected zero modes of a photonic lattice to\nrealize a single-mode, fixed-frequency, and spatially tunable laser. These\nproperties are the consequence of the underlying non-Hermitian particle-hole\nsymmetry, with which the energy spectrum satisfies\n$\\varepsilon_m=-\\varepsilon_n^*$. Unlike in the Hermitian case, the symmetric\nphase of particle-hole symmetry is no longer restricted to $\\varepsilon=0$ but\nextends along the imaginary-$\\varepsilon$ axis, which is set by the\nsingle-cavity frequency and symmetry-protected against position and coupling\ndisorder of the photonic lattice. By selectively pumping different cavities in\nthe photonic lattice, we control the spontaneous symmetry restoration process,\nwhich provides a convenient method to tune the spatial profile of the laser\nwithout changing its frequency.\n", "  Two of the most commonly encountered friction reducing agents used in plastic\nsheet production are the amides known as erucamide and behenamide, which\ndespite being almost identical chemically, lead to markedly different values of\nthe friction coefficient. To understand the origin of this contrasting\nbehavior, in this work we model brushes made of these two types of linear chain\nmolecules using quantum mechanical numerical simulations under the Density\nFunctional Theory at the B97D/6-31G(d,p)level of theory. Four chains of\nerucamide and behenamide were linked to a 2X10 zigzag graphene sheet and\noptimized both in vacuum and in continuous solvent using the SMD implicit\nsolvation model. We find that erucamide chains tend to remain closer together\nthrough {\\pi}{\\pi} stacking interactions arising from the double bonds located\nat C13 C14, a feature behenamide lacks and thus a more spread configuration is\nobtained with the latter. It is argued that this arrangement of the erucamide\nchains is responsible for the lower friction coefficient of erucamide brushes,\ncompared with behenamide brushes, which is a macroscopic consequence of\ncooperative quantum mechanical interactions. While only quantum level\ninteractions are modeled here, we show that behenamide chains are more spread\nout in the brush than erucamide chains as a consequence of those interactions.\nThe spread out configuration allows more solvent particles to penetrate the\nbrush, leading in turn to more friction, in agreement with macroscopic\nmeasurements and mesoscale simulations of the friction coefficient reported in\nthe literature.\n", "  There is increasing evidence that the highly ionized multiphase components of\nAGN disk winds may be due to thermal instability. The ions responsible for\nforming the observed X-ray absorption lines may only exist in relatively cold\nclumps that can be identified with the so-called 'warm absorbers'. Here we\ncalculate synthetic absorption lines for such warm absorbers from first\nprinciples by combining 2D hydrodynamic solutions of a two-phase medium with a\ndense grid of photoionization models to determine the detailed ionization\nstructure of the gas. Our calculations reveal that cloud disruption, which\nleads to a highly complicated velocity field (i.e. a clumpy flow), will only\nmildly affect line shapes and strengths when the cold gas becomes highly mixed\nbut not depleted. Prior to complete disruption, clouds which are optically thin\nto the driving UV resonance lines will cause absorption at an increasingly\nblueshifted line of sight velocity as they are accelerated. This behavior will\nimprint an identifiable signature on the line profile if warm absorbers are\nenshrouded in an even broader absorption line produced by a high column of\nintercloud gas. Interestingly, we show that it is possible to develop a\nspectral diagnostic for cloud acceleration by differencing the absorption\ncomponents of a doublet line, a result which can be qualitatively understood\nusing a simple partial covering model. Our calculations also permit us to\ncomment on the spectral differences between cloud disruption and ionization\nchanges driven by flux variability. Notably, cloud disruption offers another\npossibility for explaining absorption line variability.\n", "  Context: Trumpler 23 is a moderately populated, intermediate-age open cluster\nwithin the solar circle at a Rgc ~6 kpc. It is in a crowded field very close to\nthe Galactic plane and the color-magnitude diagram shows significant field\ncontamination and possible differential reddening; it is a relatively\nunderstudied cluster for these reasons, but its location makes it a key object\nfor determining Galactic abundance distributions.\n  Aims: New data from the Gaia-ESO Survey enable the first ever radial velocity\nand spectroscopic metallicity measurements for this cluster. We aim to use\nvelocities to isolate cluster members, providing more leverage for determining\ncluster parameters.\n  Methods: Gaia-ESO Survey data for 167 potential members have yielded radial\nvelocity measurements, which were used to determine the systemic velocity of\nthe cluster and membership of individual stars. Atmospheric parameters were\nalso used as a check on membership when available. Literature photometry was\nused to re-determine cluster parameters based on radial velocity member stars\nonly; theoretical isochrones are fit in the V, V-I diagram. Cluster abundance\nmeasurements of ten radial-velocity member stars with high-resolution\nspectroscopy are presented for 24 elements. These abundances have been compared\nto local disk stars, and where possible placed within the context of literature\ngradient studies.\n  Results: We find Trumpler 23 to have an age of 0.80 +/- 0.10 Gyr, significant\ndifferential reddening with an estimated mean cluster E(V-I) of 1.02\n+0.14/-0.09, and an apparent distance modulus of 14.15 +/- 0.20. We find an\naverage cluster metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.14 +/- 0.03 dex, a solar [alpha/Fe]\nabundance, and notably subsolar [s-process/Fe] abundances.\n", "  Most studies concerning the growth and evolution of massive planets focus\neither on their accretion or their migration only. In this work we study both\nprocesses concurrently to investigate how they might mutually affect each\nother. We modeled a 2-dimensional disk with a steady accretion flow onto the\ncentral star and embed a Jupiter mass planet at 5.2 au. The disk is locally\nisothermal and viscosity is modeled using a constant $\\alpha$. The planet is\nheld on a fixed orbit for a few hundred orbits to allow the disk to adapt and\ncarve a gap. After this period, the planet is released and free to move\naccording to the gravitational interaction with the gas disk. The mass\naccretion onto the planet is modeled by removing a fraction of gas from the\ninner Hill sphere, and the removed mass and momentum can be added to the\nplanet. Our results show that a fast migrating planet is able to accrete more\ngas than a slower migrating planet. Utilizing a tracer fluid we analyzed the\norigin of the accreted gas which comes predominantly originating from the inner\ndisk for a fast migrating planet. In case of slower migration the fraction of\ngas from the outer disk increases. We also found that even for very high\naccretion rates in some cases gas crosses the planetary gap from the inner to\nthe outer disk. Our simulations show that the crossing of gas changes during\nthe migration process as the migration rate slows down. Therefore classical\ntype II migration where the planet migrates with the viscous drift rate and no\ngas crosses the gap is no general process but may only occur for special\nparameters and at a certain time during the orbital evolution of the planet.\n", "  TYC 8241 2652 1 is a young star that showed a strong mid-infrared (mid-IR,\n8-25 mu) excess in all observations before 2008 consistent with a dusty disk.\nBetween 2008 and 2010 the mid-IR luminosity of this system dropped dramatically\nby at least a factor of 30 suggesting a loss of dust mass of an order of\nmagnitude or more. We aim to constrain possible models including removal of\ndisk material by stellar activity processes, the presence of a binary\ncompanion, or other explanations suggested in the literature. We present new\nX-ray observations, optical spectroscopy, near-IR interferometry, and mid-IR\nphotometry of this system to constrain its parameters and further explore the\ncause of the dust mass loss. In X-rays TYC 8241 2652 1 has all properties\nexpected from a young star: Its luminosity is in the saturation regime and the\nabundance pattern shows enhancement of O/Fe. The photospheric Ha line is filled\nwith a weak emission feature, indicating chromospheric activity consistent with\nthe observed level of coronal emission. Interferometry does not detect a\ncompanion and sets upper limits on the companion mass of 0.2, 0.35, 0.1 and\n0.05 M_sun at projected physical separations of 0.1-4 AU,4-5 AU, 5-10 AU, and\n10-30 AU, respectively (assuming a distance of 120.9 pc). Our mid-IR\nmeasurements, the first of the system since 2012, are consistent with the\ndepleted dust level seen after 2009. The new data confirms that stellar\nactivity is unlikely to destroy the dust in the disk and shows that scenarios\nwhere either TYC 8241 2652 1 heats the disk of a binary companion or a\npotential companion heats the disk of TYC 8241 2652 1 are unlikely.\n", "  In this paper, we found within the framework of perturbative QCD, that in\ndeuteron-deuteron scattering the Bose-Einstein correlations due to two parton\nshowers production, induce azimuthal angle correlations, with three correlation\nlengths: the size of the deuteron ($R_D$), the proton radius ($R_N$), and the\nsize of the BFKL Pomeron which, is closely related to the saturation momentum\n($R_c \\sim 1/Q_s$). These correlations are independent of the values of\nrapidities of the produced gluons (long range rapidity correlations), for large\nrapidities ($\\bas |y_1 - y_2| \\geq 1$), and have no symmetry with respect to\n$\\phi \\to \\pi - \\phi$ ($ \\vec{p}_{T1} \\to - \\vec{p}_{T1}$). Therefore, they\ngive rise to $v_n$ for all values of $n$, not only even values. The\ncontributions with the correlation length $R_D$ and $R_N$ crucially depend on\nthe non-perturbative contributions, and to obtain estimates of their values,\nrequiries a lot of modeling, while the correlations with $R_c \\sim 1/Q_s$ have\na perturbative QCD origin, and can be estimated in the ColorGlass Condensate\n(CGC) approach.\n", "  Context. The Sun and solar-like stars undergo activity cycles for which the\nunderlying mechanisms are not well understood. The oscillations of the Sun are\nknown to vary with its activity cycle and these changes provide diagnostics on\nthe conditions below the photosphere. Kepler has detected oscillations in\nhundreds of solar-like stars but as of yet, no widespread detection of\nsignatures of magnetic activity cycles in the oscillation parameters of these\nstars have been reported.\n  Aims. We analyse the photometric short cadence Kepler time series of a set of\n24 solar-like stars, which were observed for at least 960 days each, with the\naim to find signatures of stellar magnetic activity in the oscillation\nparameters.\n  Methods. We analyse the temporal evolution of oscillation parameters by\nmeasuring mode frequency shifts, changes in the height of the p-mode envelope,\nas well as granulation time scales.\n  Results. For 23 of the 24 investigated stars, we find significant frequency\nshifts in time. We present evidence for magnetic activity in six of them. We\nfind that the amplitude of the frequency shifts decreases with stellar age and\nrotation period. For the most prominent example, KIC 8006161, we find that,\nsimilar to the solar case, frequency shifts are smallest for the lowest and\nlargest for the highest p-mode frequencies.\n  Conclusions. These findings show that magnetic activity can be routinely\nobserved in the oscillation parameters for solar-like stars, which opens up the\npossibility to place the solar activity cycle in the context of other stars by\nasteroseismology.\n", "  We investigate atmospheric properties of 35 stable RRab stars that possess\nthe full ranges of period, light amplitude, and metal abundance found in\nGalactic RR Lyrae stars. Our results are derived from several thousand echelle\nspectra obtained over several years with the du Pont telescope of Las Campanas\nObservatory. Radial velocities of metal lines and the Halpha line were used to\nconstruct curves of radial velocity versus pulsation phase. From these we\nestimated radial velocity amplitudes for metal lines (formed near the\nphotosphere) and Halpha Doppler cores (formed at small optical depths). We also\nmeasured Halpha emission fluxes when they appear during primary light rises.\nSpectra shifted to rest wavelengths, binned into small phase intervals, and\ncoadded were used to perform model atmospheric and abundance analyses. The\nderived metallicities and those of some previous spectroscopic surveys were\ncombined to produce a new calibration of the Layden abundance scale. We then\ndivided our RRab sample into metal-rich (disk) and metal-poor (halo) groups at\n[Fe/H]=-1.0. The atmospheres of RRab families, so defined, differ with respect\nto (a) peak strength of Halpha emission flux, (b) Halpha radial velocity\namplitude, (c) dynamical gravity, (d) stellar radius variation, (e) secondary\nacceleration during the photometric \"bump\" that precedes minimum light, and (g)\nduration of Halpha line-doubling. We also detected Halpha line-doubling during\nthe bump in the metal-poor family, but not in the metal-rich one. Though all\nRRab probably are core helium-burning horizontal branch stars, the metal-rich\ngroup appear to be a species sui generis.\n", "  Rapid satellite-to-site visibility determination is of great significance to\ncoverage analysis of satellite constellations as well as onboard mission\nplanning of autonomous spacecraft. This paper presents a novel self-adaptive\nHermite interpolation technique for rapid satellite-to-site visibility\ndetermination. Piecewise cubic curves are utilized to approximate the waveform\nof the visibility function versus time. The fourth-order derivative is used to\ncontrol the approximation error and to optimize the time step for\ninterpolation. The rise and set times are analytically obtained from the roots\nof cubic polynomials. To further increase the computational speed, an interval\nshrinking strategy is adopted via investigating the geometric relationship\nbetween the ground viewing cone and the orbit trajectory. Simulation results\nshow a 98% decrease in computation time over the brute force method. The method\nis suitable for all orbital types and analytical orbit propagators.\n", "  Observations indicate that ordinary matter, the baryons, influence the\nstructural properties of dark matter on galactic scales. One such indication is\nthe radial acceleration relation, which is a tight correlation between the\nmeasured gravitational acceleration and that expected from the baryons. We show\nhere that the dark matter density profile that has been motivated by\ndissipative dark matter models, including mirror dark matter, can reproduce\nthis radial acceleration relation.\n", "  The stellar evolution theory of massive stars remains uncalibrated with\nhigh-precision photometric observational data mainly due to a small number of\nluminous stars that are monitored from space. Automated all-sky surveys have\nrevealed numerous variable stars but most of the luminous stars are often\noverexposed. Targeted campaigns can improve the time base of photometric data\nfor those objects.\n  The aim of this investigation is to study the variability of luminous stars\nat different timescales in young open clusters and OB associations.\n  We monitored 22 open clusters and associations from 2011 to 2013 using a\n0.25-m telescope. Variable stars were detected by comparing the overall\nlight-curve scatter with measurement uncertainties. Variability was analysed by\nthe light curve feature extraction tool FATS. Periods of pulsating stars were\ndetermined using the discrete Fourier transform code SigSpec. We then\nclassified the variable stars based on their pulsation periods and available\nspectral information.\n  We obtained light curves for more than 20000 sources of which 354 were found\nto be variable. Amongst them we find 80 eclipsing binaries, 31 $\\alpha$ Cyg, 13\n$\\beta$ Cep, 62 Be, 16 slowly pulsating B, 7 Cepheid, 1 $\\gamma$ Doradus, 3\nWolf-Rayet and 63 late-type variable stars. Up to 55% of these stars are\npotential new discoveries as they are not present in the Variable Star Index\n(VSX) database. We find the cluster membership fraction for variable stars to\nbe 13% with an upper limit of 35%.\n", "  We have cross matched the Gaia Data Release 1 secondary dataset that contains\npositions of 1.14 billion objects against the most complete to date catalogue\nof VLBI positions of 11.4 thousand sources, almost exclusively active galactic\nnuclei. We found 6,064 matches, i.e. 53% radio objects. The median uncertainty\nof VLBI positions is a factor of 4 smaller than the median uncertainties of\ntheir optical counterparts. Our analysis shows that the distribution of\nnormalized arc lengths significantly deviates from Rayleigh shape with an\nexcess of objects with small normalized arc lengths and with a number of\noutliers. We found that 6% matches have radio optical offsets significant at\n99% confidence level. Therefore, we conclude there exists a population of\nobjects with genuine offsets between centroids of radio and optical emission.\n", "  Dozens of high-energy neutrinos have been detected by the IceCube neutrino\ntelescope, but no clear association with any classes of astrophysical sources\nhas been identified so far. Recently, Kadler et al. (2016) report that a PeV\ncascade-like neutrino event occurs in positional and temporal coincidence with\na giant gamma-ray flare of the blazar PKS B1424-418. Since IceCube track-like\nevents have much better angular resolution, we here search for possible\nshort-term gamma-ray flares that are associated with the IceCube track-like\nevents with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations. Among them, three\ntrack-like neutrino events occur within the field of view of Fermi-LAT at the\ntime of the detection, so search for the {\\em prompt} gamma-ray emission\nassociated with neutrinos are possible. Assuming a point source origin and a\nsingle power law spectrum for the possible gamma-ray sources associated with\nneutrinos, a likelihood analysis of 0.2-100 GeV photons observed by Fermi-LAT\non the timescales of $\\sim 12$ hours and one year are performed, and for the\nthree special neutrinos, the analysis are also performed on the timescales of\nthousand of seconds before and after the neutrino detection. No significant GeV\nexcesses over the background are found and the upper limit fluxes at 95\\%\nconfidence level are obtained for different timescales. We also search for\npossible hard X-ray transient sources associated with the IceCube track-like\nneutrino events, but the search also yields null results. We discuss the\nimplication of the non-detection of gamma-ray flares for the constraints on the\nneutrino source density.\n", "  We use stellar dynamical bulge/disk/halo simulations to study whether\nbarlenses (lens-like structures embedded in the narrow bar component) are just\nthe face-on counterparts of Boxy/Peanut/X-shapes (B/P/X) seen in edge-on bars,\nor if some additional physical parameter affects that morphology. A range of\nbulge-to-disk mass and size ratios are explored: our nominal parameters\n($B/D=0.08$, $r_{\\rm eff}/h_r=0.07$, disk comprising 2/3 of total force at\n$2.2h_r$) correspond to typical MW mass galaxies. In all models a bar with\npronounced B/P/X forms in a few Gyrs, visible in edge-on view. However, the\npure barlens morphology forms only in models with sufficiently steep inner\nrotation curves, $dV_{cir}/dr\\gtrsim5V_{max}/h_r$, achieved when including a\nsmall classical bulge with $B/D\\gtrsim0.02$ and $r_{\\rm eff}/h_r\\lesssim0.1$.\nFor shallower slopes the central structure still resembles a barlens, but shows\na clear X-signature even in low inclinations. Similar result holds for\nbulgeless simulations, where the central slope is modified by changing the halo\nconcentration. The predicted sensitivity on inner rotation curve is consistent\nwith the slopes estimated from gravitational potentials calculated from the\n3.6$\\mu$m images, for the observed barlens and X-shape galaxies in the Spitzer\nSurvey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G). For inclinations $<60^\\circ$\nthe galaxies with barlenses have on average twice steeper inner rotation curves\nthan galaxies with X-shapes: the limiting slope is $\\sim250$km/s/kpc. Among\nbarred galaxies, those with barlenses have both the strongest bars and the\nlargest relative excess of inner surface density, both in barlens region\n($\\lesssim0.5h_r$) and near the center ($\\lesssim0.1h_r$); this provides\nevidence for bar-driven secular evolution in galaxies.\n", "  Density-functional calculations of lattice dynamics and high-resolution\nsynchrotron powder diffraction uncover antiferroelectric distortion in the\nkagome francisite Cu$_3$Bi(SeO$_3$)$_2$O$_2$Cl below 115K. Its Br-containing\nanalogue is stable in the room-temperature crystal structure down to at least\n10K, although the Br compound is on the verge of a similar antiferroelectric\ninstability and reveals local displacements of Cu and Br atoms. The\nI-containing compound is stable in its room-temperature structure according to\ndensity-functional calculations. We show that the distortion involves\ncooperative displacements of Cu and Cl atoms, and originates from the\noptimization of interatomic distances for weakly bonded halogen atoms. The\ndistortion introduces a tangible deformation of the kagome spin lattice and may\nbe responsible for the reduced net magnetization of the Cl compound compared to\nthe Br one. The polar structure of Cu$_3$Bi(SeO$_3$)$_2$O$_2$Cl is only\nslightly higher in energy than the non-polar antiferroelectric structure, but\nno convincing evidence of its formation could be obtained.\n", "  It is possible to find initial states for gravitational collapse whose\nentropy approximately saturates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the final\nblack hole. The prototypical example of such a state is that envisaged by Zurek\nand Thorne, and also by Susskind: for a black hole of mass $\\sim M$ , a number\n$\\sim M^2$ of quanta with energies of order $1/M$ are accreted on a timescale\nof order $\\sim M^3$, an approximate time-reverse of Hawking evaporation. There\nis lore that all initial states which saturate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\nmust involve a formation timescale of this order, $M^3$ , and not the much\nshorter dynamical timescale $M$ . Counterexamples to this lore have been found\nby Sorkin, Wald and Zhang, and also by Hsu and Reeb, in the form of\nsemiclassical initial data sets. However the spacetimes that correspond to\nthese counterexamples possess white holes in the past, as well as black holes\nin the future, which casts doubt on their physical relevance. We modify the\ncounterexamples to eliminate the white holes, yielding formation timescales of\norder $M^2$ , and argue that the lore is unfounded.\n", "  The low energy magnetic excitation spectrum of the Heisenberg\nantiferromagnetic $S = 1/2$ chain system Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ with Ni- and\nCa-impurities is studied by neutron spectroscopy. In all cases, a\ndefect-induced spectral pseudogap is observed and shown to scale\nproportionately to the number of scattering centers in the spin chains.\n", "  We present energy-momentum mapping of surface Dirac photocurrent in the\ntopological insulator Sb$_2$Te$_3$ by means of time- and angle-resolved\ntwo-photon photoemission spectroscopy combined with polarization-variable\nmid-infrared pulse laser. It is demonstrated that the direct optical transition\nfrom the occupied to the unoccupied part of the surface Dirac-cone permits the\nlinear and circular photogalvanic effect which thereby enables us to coherently\ncontrol the surface electric-current by laser polarization. Moreover, the\nsurface current mapping directly visualizes ultrafast current dynamics in the\nDirac cone in the time domain. We unravel the ultrafast intraband relaxation\ndynamics of the inelastic scattering and momentum scattering separately. Our\nobservations pave the pathway for coherent optical control over surface Dirac\nelectrons in topological insulators.\n", "  We examine the gamma-ray quasi-periodic variability of PKS 2155-304 with the\nlatest publicly available \\emph{Fermi}-LAT Pass 8 data which covers the years\nfrom 2008 August to 2016 October. We produce the light curves in two ways,\ni.e., the exposure-weighted aperture photometry and the maximum likelihood\noptimization. The light curves are then analyzed by using Lomb-Scargle\nPeriodogram (LSP) and Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ); and the results\nreveal a significant quasi-periodicity with a period of $1.74\\pm0.13$ years and\na significance of $\\sim$ 4.9 $\\sigma$. The constraint of multifrequencies\nquasi-periodic variabilities on blazar emission model is discussed.\n", "  To study the impact of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on the galactic\nISM, we present Magellan long-slit spectroscopy of 12 luminous nearby type 2\nAGN (L_bol~10^{45.0-46.5} erg/s, z~0.1). These objects are selected from a\nparent sample of spectroscopically identified AGN to have high\n[OIII]{\\lambda}5007 and WISE mid-IR luminosities and extended emission in the\nSDSS r-band images, suggesting the presence of extended [OIII]{\\lambda}5007\nemission. We find spatially resolved [OIII] emission (2-35 kpc from the\nnucleus) in 8 out of 12 of these objects. Combined with samples of higher\nluminosity type 2 AGN, we confirm that the size of the narrow-line region\n(R_NLR) scales with the mid-IR luminosity until the relation flattens at ~10\nkpc. Nine out of 12 objects in our sample have regions with broad [OIII]\nlinewidths (w_80>600 km/s), indicating outflows. We define these regions as the\nkinematically-disturbed region (KDR). The size of the KDR (R_KDR) is typically\nsmaller than R_NLR by few kpc but also correlates strongly with the AGN mid-IR\nluminosity. Given the unknown density in the gas, we derive a wide range in the\nenergy efficiency {\\eta}=dot{E}/L_bol=0.01%-30%. We find no evidence for an AGN\nluminosity threshold below which outflows are not launched. To explain the\nsizes, velocity profiles, and high occurrence rates of the outflows in the most\nluminous AGN, we propose a scenario in which energy-conserving outflows are\ndriven by AGN episodes with ~10^8-year durations. Within each episode the AGN\nflickers on shorter timescales, with a cadence of ~10^6 year active phases\nseparated by ~10^7 years.\n", "  We derive the pseudoscalar condensate induced by anomaly and vorticity from\nthe Wigner function for massive fermions in homogeneous electromagnetic fields.\nIt has an anomaly term and a force-vorticity coupling term. As a mass effect,\nthe pseudoscalar condensate is linearly proportional to the fermion mass in\nsmall mass expansion. By a generalization to two-flavor and three-flavor cases,\nthe neutral pion and eta meson condensates are calculated from the Wigner\nfunction and have anomaly parts as well as force-vorticity parts, in which the\nanomaly part of the neutral pion condensate is consistent to the previous\nresult. We also discuss about possible observables of the condensates in heavy\nion collisions such as collective flows of neutral pions and eta mesons which\nmay be influenced by the electromagnetic field and vorticity profiles.\n", "  We present predictions for time delays between multiple images of the\ngravitationally lensed supernova, iPTF16geu, which was recently discovered from\nthe intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). As the supernova is of Type\nIa where the intrinsic luminosity is usually well-known, accurately measured\ntime delays of the multiple images could provide tight constraints on the\nHubble constant. According to our lens mass models constrained by the {\\it\nHubble Space Telescope} F814W image, we expect the maximum relative time delay\nto be less than a day, which is consistent with the maximum of 100 hours\nreported by Goobar et al. but places a stringent upper limit. Furthermore, the\nfluxes of most of the supernova images depart from expected values suggesting\nthat they are affected by microlensing. The microlensing timescales are small\nenough that they may pose significant problems to measure the time delays\nreliably. Our lensing rate calculation indicates that the occurrence of a\nlensed SN in iPTF is likely. However, the observed total magnification of\niPTF16geu is larger than expected, given its redshift. This may be a further\nindication of ongoing microlensing in this system.\n", "  We propose a novel general approach to locality of lattice composite fields,\nwhich in case of QCD involves locality in both quark and gauge degrees of\nfreedom. The method is applied to gauge operators based on the overlap Dirac\nmatrix elements, showing for the first time their local nature on realistic\npath-integral backgrounds. The framework entails a method for efficient\nevaluation of such non-ultralocal operators, whose computational cost is\nvolume-indepenent at fixed accuracy, and only grows logarithmically as this\naccuracy approaches zero. This makes computation of useful operators, such as\noverlap-based topological density, practical. The key notion underlying these\nfeatures is that of exponential insensitivity to distant fields, made rigorous\nby introducing the procedure of statistical regularization. The scales\nassociated with insensitivity property are useful characteristics of non-local\ncontinuum operators.\n", "  We generalize our virial approach to study the neutral current neutrino\nresponse of nuclear matter at low densities. In the long-wavelength limit, the\nvirial expansion makes model-independent predictions for neutrino-nucleon\nscattering rates and the density S_V and spin S_A responses. We find S_A is\nsignificantly reduced from one even at low densities. We provide a simple fit\nS_A^f(n,T,Y_p) of the axial response as a function of density n, temperature T\nand proton fraction Y_p. This fit reproduces our model independent virial\nresults at low densities and reproduces the Burrows and Sawyer random phase\napproximation (RPA) results at high densities. Our fit can be incorporated into\nsupernova simulations in a straight forward manner. Preliminary one dimensional\nsupernova simulations suggest that the reduction in the axial response may\nenhance neutrino heating rates in the gain region during the accretion phase of\na core-collapse supernovae.\n", "  The galactic bulge is a significant part of our galaxy, but it is hard to\nobserve, being both distant and covered by dust in the disk. Therefore there do\nnot exist many hi-res optical spectra of bulge stars with large wavelength\ncoverage, whose determined abundances can be compared with nearby, similarly\nanalyzed stellar samples. We aim to determine the, for chemical evolution\nmodels, so important alpha elements of a sample of bulge giants using hi-res\noptical spectra with large wavelength coverage. The abundances found will be\ncompared to similarly derived abundances from similar spectra of similar stars\nin the local thin and thick disks. In this first paper we focus on the Solar\nneighborhood reference sample. We use spectral synthesis to derive the stellar\nparameters as well as the elemental abundances of both the local as well as the\nbulge samples of giants. Special care is taken to benchmark our method of\ndetermining stellar parameters against independent measurements of effective\ntemperatures from angular diameter measurements and surface gravities from\nasteroseismology. In this first paper we present the method used to determine\nthe stellar parameters as well as the elemental abundances, evaluate them, and\npresent the results for our local disk sample of 291 giants. When comparing our\ndetermined spectroscopic temperatures to those derived from angular diameter\nmeasurements, we reproduce these with a systematic difference of +10 K and a\nstandard deviation of 53 K. The spectroscopic gravities are reproducing the\nones determined from asteroseismology with a systematic offset of +0.10 dex and\na standard deviation of 0.12 dex. When it comes to the abundance trends, our\nsample of local disk giants is closely following that of other works analyzing\nsolar neighborhood dwarfs, showing that the much brighter giant stars are as\ngood abundance probes as the often used dwarfs.\n", "  We present a pilot analysis of the influence of galaxy stellar mass and\ncluster environment on the probability of slow rotation in 22 central galaxies\nat mean redshift $z=0.07$. This includes new integral-field observations of 5\ncentral galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, observed with the\nSPIRAL integral-field spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The\ncomposite sample presented here spans a wide range of stellar masses,\n$10.9<$log(M$_{*}/$M$_{\\odot})<12.0$, and are embedded in halos ranging from\ngroups to clusters, $12.9<$log(M$_{200}/$M$_{\\odot})<15.6$. We find a mean\nprobability of slow rotation in our sample of P(SR)$=54\\pm7$percent. Our\nresults show an increasing probability of slow rotation in central galaxies\nwith increasing stellar mass. However, when we examine the dependence of slow\nrotation on host cluster halo mass we do not see a significant relationship. We\nalso explore the influence of cluster dominance on slow rotation in central\ngalaxies. Clusters with low dominance are associated with dynamically younger\nsystems. We find that cluster dominance has no significant effect on the\nprobability of slow rotation in central galaxies. These results conflict with a\nparadigm in which halo mass alone predetermines central galaxy properties.\n", "  Most major discoveries in astronomy are unplanned, and result from surveying\nthe Universe in a new way, rather than by testing a hypothesis or conducting an\ninvestigation with planned outcomes. For example, of the 10 greatest\ndiscoveries made by the Hubble Space Telescope, only one was listed in its key\nscience goals. So a telescope that merely achieves its stated science goals is\nnot achieving its potential scientific productivity. Several next-generation\nastronomical survey telescopes are currently being designed and constructed\nthat will significantly expand the volume of observational parameter space, and\nshould in principle discover unexpected new phenomena and new types of object.\nHowever, the complexity of the telescopes and the large data volumes mean that\nthese discoveries are unlikely to be found by chance. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to plan explicitly for these unexpected discoveries in the design and\nconstruction of the telescope. Two types of discovery are recognised:\nunexpected objects, and unexpected phenomena. This paper argues that\nnext-generation astronomical surveys require an explicit process for detecting\nthe unexpected, and proposes an implementation of this process. This\nimplementation addresses both types of discovery, and relies heavily on\nmachine-learning techniques, and also on theory-based simulations that\nencapsulate our current understanding of the Universe to compare with the data.\n", "  Aims. We aim to contribute to the identification of unassociated gamma-ray\nsources in the galactic plane in order to enlarge the currently known\npopulation of gamma-ray binaries and related systems, such as radio emitting\nX-ray binaries and microquasars. These objects are currently regarded as\nexcellent test beds for the understanding of high energy phenomena in stellar\nsystems. Methods. Potential targets of study are selected based on\ncross-identification of the 3rd Fermi Large Area Telescope catalogue with\nhistorical catalogues of luminous stars often found as optical counterparts in\nknown cases. Follow-up observations and analysis of multi-wavelength archival\ndata are later used to seek further proofs of association beyond the simple\npositional agreement. Results. Current results enable us to present here the\ncase of the Fermi source 3FGL J0133.3+5930 where two peculiar objects have been\ndiscovered inside its region of uncertainty. One of them is the star TYC\n3683-985-1 (LS I +59 79) whose eclipsing binary nature is reported in this\nwork. The other one is the X-ray source SWIFT J0132.9+5932, that we found to be\na likely low-power Active Galactic Nucleus at z = 0:1143 \\pm 0:0002. If this\nsecond object is of blazar type, it could easily account for the observed\ngamma-ray photon flux. However, this is not confirmed at present, thus\nrendering still open the star system TYC 3683-985-1 as an alternative\ncounterpart candidate to the Fermi source.\n", "  We propose that in a small fraction of intermediate luminosity optical\ntransients (ILOTs) powered by a strongly interacting binary system, the ejected\nmass in the equatorial plane can block the central source from our line of\nsight. We can therefore observe only radiation that is reprocessed by polar\noutflow, much as in type~II active galactic nuclei (AGN). An ejection of\n$M_{\\rm ej,e}=10^{-4} ~\\rm{M_\\odot} ~ (1 ~\\rm{M_\\odot})$ at 30 degrees from the\nequatorial plane and at a velocity of $v_{\\rm e} = 100 ~\\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ will\nblock the central source in the NIR for about 5 years (500 years). During that\nperiod of time the object might disappear in the visible band, and be detected\nonly in the IR band due to polar dust. We raise the possibility that the\nrecently observed disappearance of a red giant in the visible, designated\nN6946-BH1, is a type~II ILOT rather than a failed supernova. For this case we\nestimate that the ejected mass in the polar direction was $M_{\\rm ej,p}\\approx\n10^{-3} ~\\rm{M_\\odot}$. Our scenario predicts that this event should reinstate\nits visible emission in several decades.\n", "  We discover that chiral symmetry does not act as an infrared attractor of the\nrenormalization group flow under the impact of quantum gravity fluctuations.\nThus, observationally viable quantum gravity models must respect chiral\nsymmetry. In our truncation, asymptotically safe gravity does, as a chiral\nfixed point exists. A second non-chiral fixed point with massive fermions\nprovides a template for models with dark matter. This fixed point disappears\nfor more than 10 fermions, suggesting that an asymptotically safe ultraviolet\ncompletion for the standard model plus gravity enforces chiral symmetry.\n", "  The two photon transition of $\\bar{c}c$ quarkonia are studied within a\ncovariant approach based on the consistent truncation scheme of the quantum\nchromodynamics Dyson-Schwinger equation for the quark propagator and the\nBethe--Salpeter equation for the mesons. We find the decay widths of\n$\\eta_{c}^{} \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ and $\\chi_{c0,2}^{} \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ in good\nagreement with experimental data. The obtained transition form factor of\n$\\eta_{c}^{} \\to \\gamma\\gamma^{\\ast}$ for a wide range of space-like photon\nmomentum transfer squared is also in agreement with the experimental findings\nof the BABAR experiment. As a by-product, the decay widths of\n$\\eta_{b}^{},\\chi_{b0,2}^{} \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ and the transition form factor of\n$\\eta_{b}^{}, \\chi_{c0,b0}^{} \\to\\gamma\\gamma^{\\ast}$ are predicted, which\nawait for experimental test.\n", "  Two types of Eulerian action principles for relativistic extended\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are formulated. With the first, the action is\nextremized under the constraints of density, entropy, and Lagrangian label\nconservation, which leads to a Clebsch representation for a generalized\nmomentum and a generalized vector potential. The second action arises upon\ntransformation to physical field variables, giving rise to a covariant bracket\naction principle, i.e., a variational principle in which constrained variations\nare generated by a degenerate Poisson bracket. Upon taking appropriate limits,\nthe action principles lead to relativistic Hall MHD and well-known relativistic\nideal MHD. For the first time, the Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic Hall\nMHD with electron thermal inertia (akin to [Comisso \\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 113}, 045001 (2014)] for the electron--positron plasma) is\nintroduced. This thermal inertia effect allows for violation of the frozen-in\nmagnetic flux condition in marked contrast to nonrelativistic Hall MHD that\ndoes satisfy the frozen-in condition. We also find violation of the frozen-in\ncondition is accompanied by freezing-in of an alternative flux determined by a\ngeneralized vector potential. Finally, we derive a more general 3+1 Poisson\nbracket for nonrelativistic extended MHD, one that does not assume smallness of\nthe electron ion mass ratio.\n", "  The correlation functions related to topological phase transitions in\ninversion-symmetric lattice models described by $2\\times 2$ Dirac Hamiltonians\nare discussed. In one dimension, the correlation function measures the\ncharge-polarization correlation between Wannier states at different positions,\nwhile in two dimensions it measures the itinerant-circulation correlation\nbetween Wannier states. The correlation function is nonzero in both the\ntopologically trivial and nontrivial states, and allows to extract a\ncorrelation length that diverges at topological phase transitions. The\ncorrelation length and the curvature function that defines the topological\ninvariants are shown to have universal critical exponents, allowing the notion\nof universality classes to be introduced. Particularly in two dimensions, the\nuniversality class is determined by the orbital symmetry of the Dirac model.\nThe scaling laws that constrain the critical exponents are revealed, and are\npredicted to be satisfied even in interacting systems, as demonstrated in an\ninteracting topological Kondo Insulator.\n", "  Massive stars are important building blocks of the Universe, and their\nstellar structure and evolution models are fundamental cornerstones of various\nfields in modern astrophysics. The precision of these models is limited by our\nlack of understanding of various internal mixing processes that significantly\ninfluence the lifetime of these objects (e.g. core overshoot, chemical mixing,\nor the internal differential rotation). Our goal is to calibrate models by\nextending the sample of available seismic studies of slowly pulsating B (SPB)\nstars, providing input for theoretical modelling efforts that will deliver\nprecise constraints on the parameters describing the internal mixing processes\nin these objects. We used spectral synthesis and disentangling techniques to\nderive fundamental parameters and to determine precise orbital parameters from\nhigh-resolution spectra. We employed custom masks to construct light curves\nfrom the Kepler pixel data and used standard time-series analysis tools to\nconstruct a set of significant frequencies for each target. These sets were\nfirst filtered from combination frequencies, and then screened for period\nspacing patterns. We detect gravity mode period series of modes of the same\ndegree l with consecutive radial order n in four new and one revisited SPB\nstar. These predominantly prograde dipole series (covering ~10-40 radial\norders) are influenced by rotation and carry signatures of chemical mixing\nprocesses. Our spectroscopic analysis, in addition to placing each object\ninside the SPB instability strip and identifying KIC 4930889 as an SB2 binary,\nreveals that KIC 11971405 is a fast rotator that shows very weak Be signatures.\nTogether with the observed photometric outbursts this illustrates that this Be\nstar is a fast rotating SPB star. We hypothesise that the outbursts might be\nconnected to its very densely compressed oscillation spectrum.\n", "  Context. With the aid of stellar abundance analysis, it is possible to study\nthe galactic formation and evolution. Magnesium is an important element to\ntrace the alpha-element evolution in our Galaxy. For chemical abundance\nanalysis, such as magnesium abundance, accurate and complete atomic data are\nessential. Inaccurate atomic data lead to uncertain abundances and prevent\ndiscrimination between different evolution models. Aims. We study the spectrum\nof neutral magnesium from laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations.\nOur aim is to improve the oscillator strengths ( f -values) of Mg I lines and\nto create a complete set of accurate atomic data, particularly for the near-IR\nregion. Methods. We derived oscillator strengths by combining the experimental\nbranching fractions with radiative lifetimes reported in the literature and\ncomputed in this work. A hollow cathode discharge lamp was used to produce free\natoms in the plasma and a Fourier transform spectrometer recorded the\nintensity-calibrated high-resolution spectra. In addition, we performed\ntheoretical calculations using the multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock program\nATSP2K. Results. This project provides a set of experimental and theoretical\noscillator strengths. We derived 34 experimental oscillator strengths. Except\nfrom the Mg I optical triplet lines (3p 3^P^o_0,1,2 - 4s 3^S_1), these\noscillator strengths are measured for the first time. The theoretical\noscillator strengths are in very good agreement with the experimental data and\ncomplement the missing transitions of the experimental data up to n = 7 from\neven and odd parity terms. We present an evaluated set of oscillator strengths,\ngf, with uncertainties as small as 5%. The new values of the Mg I optical\ntriplet line (3p 3^P^o_0,1,2 - 4s 3^S_1) oscillator strength values are ~0.08\ndex larger than the previous measurements.\n", "  In this paper we study the next-to-leading order corrections to deeply\nvirtual pion and kaon production in neutrino experiments. We estimate these\ncorrections in the kinematics of the Minerva experiment at FERMILAB, and find\nthat they are sizable and increase the leading order cross-section by up to a\nfactor of two. We provide a code, which can be used for the evaluation of the\ncross-sections, taking into account these corrections and employing various GPD\nmodels.\n", "  Determining elemental abundances of bulge stars can, via chemical evolution\nmodeling, help to understand the formation and evolution of the bulge. Recently\nthere have been claims both for and against the bulge having a different\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]-trend as compared to the local thick disk possibly\nmeaning a faster, or at least different, formation time scale of the bulge as\ncompared to the local thick disk. We aim to determine the abundances of oxygen,\nmagnesium, calcium, and titanium in a sample of 46 bulge K-giants, 35 of which\nhave been analyzed for oxygen and magnesium in previous works, and compare them\nto homogeneously determined elemental abundances of a local disk sample of 291\nK-giants. We use spectral synthesis to determine both the stellar parameters as\nwell as the elemental abundances of the bulge stars analyzed here. The method\nis exactly the same as was used for analyzing the comparison sample of 291\nlocal K-giants in Paper I of this series. Compared to the previous analysis of\nthe 35 stars in our sample, we find lower [Mg/Fe] for [Fe/H]>-0.5, and\ntherefore contradict the conclusion about a declining [O/Mg] for increasing\n[Fe/H]. We instead see a constant [O/Mg] over all the observed [Fe/H] in the\nbulge. Furthermore, we find no evidence for a different behavior of the\nalpha-iron trends in the bulge as compared to the local thick disk from our two\nsamples.\n", "  We use asteroseismic data from the Kepler satellite to determine fundamental\nstellar properties of the 66 main-sequence targets observed for at least one\nfull year by the mission. We distributed tens of individual oscillation\nfrequencies extracted from the time series of each star among seven modelling\nteams who applied different methods to determine radii, masses, and ages for\nall stars in the sample. Comparisons among the different results reveal a good\nlevel of agreement in all stellar properties, which is remarkable considering\nthe variety of codes, input physics and analysis methods employed by the\ndifferent teams. Average uncertainties are of the order of $\\sim$2\\% in radius,\n$\\sim$4\\% in mass, and $\\sim$10\\% in age, making this the best-characterised\nsample of main-sequence stars available to date. Our predicted initial\nabundances and mixing-length parameters are checked against inferences from\nchemical enrichment laws $\\Delta Y / \\Delta Z$ and predictions from 3D\natmospheric simulations. We test the accuracy of the determined stellar\nproperties by comparing them to the Sun, angular diameter measurements, Gaia\nparallaxes, and binary evolution, finding excellent agreement in all cases and\nfurther confirming the robustness of asteroseismically-determined physical\nparameters of stars when individual frequencies of oscillation are available.\nBaptised as the Kepler dwarfs LEGACY sample, these stars are the solar-like\noscillators with the best asteroseismic properties available for at least\nanother decade. All data used in this analysis and the resulting stellar\nparameters are made publicly available for the community.\n", "  Context. Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are ubiquitous in the Milky Way, yet\nthey play a crucial role in breeding newly-formed stars.\n  Aims. With the aim of further understanding the dynamics, chemistry, and\nevolution of IRDCs, we carried out multi-wavelength observations on a small\nsample.\n  Methods. We performed new observations with the IRAM 30 m and CSO 10.4 m\ntelescopes, with tracers ${\\rm HCO^+}$, HCN, ${\\rm N_2H^+}$, ${\\rm C^{18}O}$,\nDCO$^+$, SiO, and DCN toward six IRDCs G031.97+00.07, G033.69-00.01,\nG034.43+00.24, G035.39-00.33, G038.95-00.47, and G053.11+00.05.\n  Results. We investigated 44 cores including 37 cores reported in previous\nwork and seven newly-identified cores. Toward the dense cores, we detected 6\nDCO$^+$, and 5 DCN lines. Using pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution\n(SED) fits of the $\\textit{Herschel}$ 70 to 500 $\\mu$m, we obtained dust\ntemperature and column density distributions of the IRDCs. We found that ${\\rm\nN_2H^+}$ emission has a strong correlation with the dust temperature and column\ndensity distributions, while ${\\rm C^{18}O}$ showed the weakest correlation. It\nis suggested that ${\\rm N_2H^+}$ is indeed a good tracer in very dense\nconditions, but ${\\rm C^{18}O}$ is an unreliable one, as it has a relatively\nlow critical density and is vulnerable to freezing-out onto the surface of cold\ndust grains. The dynamics within IRDCs are active, with infall, outflow, and\ncollapse; the spectra are abundant especially in deuterium species.\n  Conclusions. We observe many blueshifted and redshifted profiles,\nrespectively, with ${\\rm HCO^+}$ and ${\\rm C^{18}O}$ toward the same core. This\ncase can be well explained by model \"envelope expansion with core collapse\n(EECC)\".\n", "  A bouncing universe with a long period of contraction during which the\naverage density is pressureless (the same equation of state as matter) as\ncosmologically observable scales exit the Hubble horizon has been proposed as\nan explanation for producing a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic\nscalar perturbations. A well-known problem with this scenario is that, unless\nsuppressed, the energy density associated with anisotropy grows faster than\nthat of the pressureless matter, so the matter-like phase is unstable. Previous\nmodels introduce an ekpyrotic phase after the matter-like phase to prevent the\nanisotropy from generating chaotic mixmaster behavior. In this work, though, we\npoint out that, unless the anisotropy is suppressed first, the matter-like\nphase will never start and that suppressing the anisotropy requires\nextraordinary, exponential fine-tuning.\n", "  A common goal in the sciences is optimization of an objective function by\nselecting control variables such that a desired outcome is achieved. This\nscenario can be expressed in terms of a control landscape of an objective\nconsidered as a function of the control variables. At the most basic level, it\nis known that the vast majority of quantum control landscapes possess no traps,\nwhose presence would hinder reaching the objective. This paper reviews and\nextends the quantum control landscape assessment, presenting evidence that the\nsame highly favorable landscape features exist in many other domains of\nscience. The implications of this broader evidence are discussed. Specifically,\ncontrol landscape examples from quantum mechanics, chemistry, and evolutionary\nbiology are presented. Despite the obvious differences, commonalities between\nthese areas are highlighted within a unified mathematical framework. This\nmathematical framework is driven by the wide ranging experimental evidence on\nthe ease of finding optimal controls (in terms of the required algorithmic\nsearch effort beyond laboratory set up overhead). The full scope and\nimplications of this observed common control behavior pose an open question for\nassessment in further work.\n", "  Within the superfield approach, we consider the nonlocal generalization of\nthe Wess-Zumino model and calculate the one-loop low-energy contributions to\nthe effective action. Four different nonlocal models are considered, among\nwhich only the first model does not reduce to the standard Wess-Zumino model\nwhen we take the parameter of nonlocality of the model, $\\Lambda$, much greater\nthan any energy scale; in addition, this model also depends on an extra\nparameter, $\\xi$. As to the other three models, the result looks like the\nrenormalized effective potential for the usual Wess-Zumino model, where the\nnormalization scale $\\mu$ is replaced by the $\\Lambda$. Moreover, the fourth\nmodel displays a divergence which can be eliminated through the appropriate\nwave function renormalization.\n", "  Context. As of today, asteroseismology mainly allows us to probe the internal\nrotation of stars when modes are only weakly affected by rotation using\nperturbative methods. Such methods cannot be applied to rapidly rotating stars,\nwhich exhibit complex oscillation spectra. In this context, the so-called\ntraditional approximation, which neglects the terms associated with the\nlatitudinal component of the rotation vector, describes modes that are strongly\naffected by rotation. This approximation is sometimes used for interpreting\nasteroseismic data, however, its domain of validity is not established yet.\n  Aims. We aim at deriving analytical prescriptions for period spacings of\nlow-frequency gravity modes strongly affected by rotation through the full\nCoriolis acceleration, which can be used to probe stellar internal structure\nand rotation.\n  Methods. We approximated the asymptotic theory of gravito-inertial waves in\nuniformly rotating stars using ray theory described in a previous paper in the\nlow-frequency regime, where waves are trapped near the equatorial plane. We put\nthe equations of ray dynamics into a separable form and used the EBK\nquantisation method to compute modes frequencies from rays.\n  Results. Two spectral patterns that depend on stratification and rotation are\npredicted within this new approximation: one for axisymmetric modes and one for\nnon-axisymmetric modes.\n  Conclusions. The detection of the predicted patterns in observed oscillation\nspectra would give constraints on internal rotation and chemical stratification\nof rapidly rotating stars exhibiting gravity modes, such as $\\gamma$ Doradus,\nSPB, or Be stars. The obtained results have a mathematical form that is similar\nto that of the traditional approximation, but the new approximation takes the\nfull Coriolis, which allows for propagation near the centre, and centrifugal\naccelerations into account.\n", "  We explore the use of mm-wave emission line ratios to trace molecular gas\ndensity when observations integrate over a wide range of volume densities\nwithin a single telescope beam. For observations targeting external galaxies,\nthis case is unavoidable. Using a framework similar to that of Krumholz and\nThompson (2007), we model emission for a set of common extragalactic lines from\nlognormal and power law density distributions. We consider the median density\nof gas producing emission and the ability to predict density variations from\nobserved line ratios. We emphasize line ratio variations, because these do not\nrequire knowing the absolute abundance of our tracers. Patterns of line ratio\nvariations have the prospect to illuminate the high-end shape of the density\ndistribution, and to capture changes in the dense gas fraction and median\nvolume density. Our results with and without a high density power law tail\ndiffer appreciably; we highlight better knowledge of the PDF shape as an\nimportant area. We also show the implications of sub-beam density distributions\nfor isotopologue studies targeting dense gas tracers. Differential excitation\noften implies a significant correction to the naive case. We provide tabulated\nversions of many of our results, which can be used to interpret changes in\nmm-wave line ratios in terms of changes in the underlying density\ndistributions.\n", "  We study the one-dimensional attractive Fermionic Hubbard model under the\ninfluence of periodic driving with the time-dependent density matrix\nrenormalization group method. We show that the system can be driven into an\nunconventional pairing state characterized by a condensate made of Cooper-pairs\nwith a finite center-of-mass momentum similar to a Fulde-Ferrell state. We\nobtain results both in the laboratory and the rotating reference frames\ndemonstrating that the momentum of the condensate can be finely tuned by\nchanging the ratio between the amplitude and the frequency of the driving. In\nparticular, by quenching this ratio to the value corresponding to suppression\nof the tunnelling and the Coulomb interaction strength to zero, we are able to\n\"freeze\" the condensate. We finally study the effects of different initial\nconditions, and compare our numerical results to those obtained from a\ntime-independent Floquet theory in the large frequency regime. Our work offers\nthe possibility of engineering and controlling unconventional pairing states in\nfermionic condensates.\n", "  According to the famous Lyth bound, one can confirm large field inflation by\nfinding tensor modes with sufficiently large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Here\nwe will try to answer two related questions: Is it possible to rule out all\nlarge field inflationary models by not finding tensor modes with $r$ above some\ncritical value, and what can we say about the scale of inflation by measuring\n$r$? However, in order to answer these questions one should distinguish between\ntwo different definitions of the large field inflation and three different\ndefinitions of the scale of inflation. We will examine these issues using the\ntheory of cosmological $\\alpha$-attractors as a convenient testing ground.\n", "  We analyze theoretically the interplay between the torsional and the\nrotational motion of an aligned biphenyl-like molecule. To do so, we consider a\ntransition between two electronic states with different internal torsional\npotentials, induced by means of a resonant laser pulse. The change in the\ninternal torsional potential provokes the motion of the torsional wavepacket in\nthe excited electronic state, modifying the structure of the molecule, and\nhence, its inertia tensor. We find that this process has a strong impact on the\nrotational wave function, displaying different behavior depending on the\nelectronic states involved and their associated torsional potentials. We\ndescribe the dynamics of the system by considering the degree of alignment and\nthe expectations values of the angular momentum operators for the overall\nrotation of the molecule.\n", "  The advent of space-based missions like $Kepler$ has revolutionized the study\nof solar-type stars, particularly through the measurement and modeling of their\nresonant modes of oscillation. Here we analyze a sample of 66 $Kepler$\nmain-sequence stars showing solar-like oscillations as part of the $Kepler$\nseismic LEGACY project. We use $Kepler$ short-cadence data, of which each star\nhas at least 12 months, to create frequency power spectra optimized for\nasteroseismology. For each star we identify its modes of oscillation and\nextract parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and line width using a\nBayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo `peak-bagging' approach. We report the\nextracted mode parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such\nas frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations $\\Delta\\nu$ and\n$\\delta\\nu_{02}$; the behavior of line widths with frequency and line widths at\n$\\nu_{\\rm max}$ with $T_{\\rm eff}$, for which we derive parametrizations; and\nbehavior of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in\nfuture peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar\noscillation spectra. The frequencies and frequency ratios can tightly constrain\nthe fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode line widths and\namplitudes can test models of mode damping and excitation.\n", "  We study electron-positron pair production by spatially inhomogeneous\nelectric fields. Depending on the localization of the field, a critical point\n(critical surface) exists in the space of field configurations where the pair\nproduction probability vanishes. Near criticality, pair production exhibits\nuniversal properties similar to those of continuous phase transitions. We\nextend results previously obtained in the semi-classical (weak-field) critical\nregime to the deeply critical regime for arbitrary peak field strength. In this\nregime, we find an enhanced universality, featuring a unique critical exponent\n$\\beta=3$ for all sufficiently localized fields. For a large class of field\nprofiles, we also compute the non-universal amplitudes.\n", "  The Sun's internal rotation {\\Omega}(r,{\\Theta}) has previously been measured\nusing helioseismology techniques and found to be a complex function of\nco-latitude, {\\theta}, and radius, r. From helioseismology and observations of\napparently \"rooted\" solar magnetic tracers we know that the surface rotates\nmore slowly than much of the interior. The cause of this slow-down is not\nunderstood but it is important for understanding stellar rotation generally and\nany plausible theory of the solar interior. A new analysis using 5-min solar\np-mode limb oscillations as a rotation \"tracer\" finds an even larger velocity\ngradient in a thin region at the top of the photosphere. This shear occurs\nwhere the solar atmosphere radiates energy and angular momentum. We suggest\nthat the net effect of the photospheric angular momentum loss is similar to\nPoynting-Robertson \"photon braking\" on, for example, Sun-orbiting dust. The\nresultant photospheric torque is readily computed and, over the Sun's lifetime,\nis found to be comparable to the apparent angular momentum deficit in the\nnear-surface shear layer.\n", "  We study the effect of polydispersity on the structure of polymer brushes by\nanalytical theory, a numerical self-consistent field approach, and Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The polydispersity is represented by the Schulz-Zimm chain-length\ndistribution. We specifically focus on three different polydispersities\nrepresenting sharp, moderate and extremely wide chain length distributions and\nderive explicit analytical expressions for the chain end distributions in these\nbrushes. The results are in very good agreement with numerical data obtained\nwith self-consistent field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. With\nincreasing polydispersity, the brush density profile changes from convex to\nconcave, and for given average chain length $N_n$ and grafting density\n$\\sigma$, the brush height $H$ is found to scale as\n$(H/H_{\\mathrm{mono}}-1)\\propto(N_w/N_n-1)^{1/2}$ over a wide range of\npolydispersity indices $N_w/N_n$ (here $H_{\\mathrm{mono}}$ is the height of the\ncorresponding monodisperse brush. Chain end fluctuations are found to be\nstrongly suppressed already at very small polydispersity. Based on this\nobservation, we introduce the concept of the brush as a near-critical system\nwith two parameters (scaling variables), $(N_{n}\\sigma^{2/3})^{-1}$ and\n$(N_w/N_n-1)^{1/2}$, controlling the distance from the critical point. This\napproach provides a good description of the simulation data. Finally we study\nthe hydrodynamic penetration length $l_\\mathrm{p}$ for brush-coated surfaces in\nflow. We find that it generally increases with polydispersity. The scaling\nbehavior crosses over from $l_\\mathrm{p}\\sim N_\\mathrm{n}^{1/2}\\sigma^{-1/6}$\nfor monodisperse and weakly polydisperse brushes to $l_\\mathrm{p}\\sim\nN_{n}^{2/3}$ for strongly polydisperse brushes.\n", "  We develop a model of early GRB afterglows with the dominant $X$-ray\ncontribution from the reverse shock (RS) propagating in highly relativistic\n(Lorentz factor $\\gamma_w \\sim 10^6$) magnetized wind of a long-lasting central\nengine. The model reproduces, in a fairly natural way, the overall trends and\nyet allows for variations in the temporal and spectral evolution of early\noptical and $X$-ray afterglows. The high energy and the optical synchrotron\nemission from the RS particles occurs in the fast cooling regime; the resulting\nsynchrotron power $L_s$ is a large fraction of the wind luminosity, $L_s\n\\approx L_w/\\sqrt{1+\\sigma_w}$ ($L_w$ and $\\sigma_w$ are wind power and\nmagnetization). Thus, plateaus - parts of afterglow light curves that show\nslowly decreasing spectral power - are a natural consequence of the RS\nemission. Contribution from the forward shock (FS) is negligible in the\n$X$-rays, but in the optical both FS and RS contribute similarly: the FS\noptical emission is in the slow cooling regime, producing smooth components,\nwhile the RS optical emission is in the fast cooling regime, and thus can both\nproduce optical plateaus and account for fast optical variability correlated\nwith the $X$-rays, e.g., due to changes in the wind properties. We discuss how\nthe RS emission in the $X$-rays and combined FS and RS emission in the optical\ncan explain many of puzzling properties of early GRB afterglows.\n", "  We study the collapse of an isolated, initially cold, irregular (but almost\nspherical) and (slightly) inhomogeneous cloud of self-gravitating particles.\nThe cloud is driven towards a virialized quasi-equilibrium state by a fast\nrelaxation mechanism, occurring in a typical time $\\tau_c$, whose signature is\na large change in the particle energy distribution. Post-collapse particles are\ndivided into two main species: bound and free, the latter being ejected from\nthe system. Because of the initial system's anisotropy, the time varying\ngravitational field breaks spherical symmetry so that the ejected mass can\ncarry away angular momentum and the bound system can gain a non-zero angular\nmomentum. In addition, while strongly bound particles form a compact core,\nweakly bound ones may form, in a time scale of the order of $\\tau_c$, several\nsatellite sub-structures. These satellites have a finite lifetime that can be\nlonger than $\\tau_c$ and generally form a flattened distribution. Their origin\nand their abundance are related to the amplitude and nature of initial density\nfluctuations and to the initial cloud deviations from spherical symmetry, which\nare both amplified during the collapse phase. Satellites show a time dependent\nvirial ratio that can be different from the equilibrium value $b\\approx -1$:\nalthough they are bound to the main virialized object, they are not necessarily\nvirially relaxed.\n", "  The rapid accumulation of thermal infrared observations and shape models of\nasteroids has led to increased interest in thermophysical modeling. Most of\nthese infrared observations are unresolved. We consider what fraction of an\nasteroid's surface area contributes the bulk of the emitted thermal flux for\ntwo model asteroids of different shapes over a range of thermal parameters. The\nresulting observed surface in the infrared is generally more fragmented than\nthe area observed in visible wavelengths, indicating high sensitivity to shape.\nFor objects with low values of the thermal parameter, small fractions of the\nsurface contribute the majority of thermally emitted flux. Calculating observed\nareas could enable the production of spatially-resolved thermal inertia maps\nfrom non-resolved observations of asteroids.\n", "  Being a superluminous supernova (SLSN), PTF12dam can be explained by a\n$^{56}$Ni-powered model, a magnetar-powered model or an interaction model. We\npropose that PTF12dam is a pulsational pair instability supernova, where the\nouter envelope of a progenitor is ejected during the pulsations. Thus, it is\npowered by double energy source: radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni and a radiative\nshock in a dense circumstellar medium. To describe multicolor light curves and\nspectra we use radiation hydrodynamics calculations of STELLA code. We found\nthat light curves are well described in the model with 40M$_{\\odot}$ ejecta and\n20-40M$_{\\odot}$ circumstellar medium. The ejected $^{56}$Ni mass is about\n6M$_{\\odot}$ which results from explosive nucleosynthesis with large explosion\nenergy (2-3)$\\cdot$10$^{52}$ ergs. In comparison with alternative scenarios of\npair-instability supernova and magnetar-powered supernova, in interaction model\nall the observed main photometric characteristics are well reproduced:\nmulticolor light curves, color temperatures, and photospheric velocities.\n", "  We investigate the properties of spherically symmetric black hole solutions\nin the generalized Einstein-Skyrme model theory in four-dimensional\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter space-time. The dependencies of the Skyrmion\nfields on the cosmological constant and on the strength of the effective\ngravitational coupling are examined. We show that the increase of the absolute\nvalue of the cosmological constant qualitatively yields the same effect as\nincreasing of the effective gravitational coupling. We confirm that, similar to\nthe model in the asymptotically flat space-time, a necessary condition for the\nexistence of black holes with Skyrmionic hair is the inclusion of the Skyrme\nterm.\n", "  Four-dimensional manifolds with changing signature are obtained by taking the\nlarge $N$ limit of fuzzy $CP^2$ solutions to a Lorentzian matrix model. The\nregions of Lorentzian signature give toy models of closed universes which\nexhibit cosmological singularities. These singularities are resolved at finite\n$N$, as the underlying $CP^2$ solutions are expressed in terms of finite matrix\nelements.\n", "  Mrk 1216 is a nearby, early-type galaxy with a small effective radius of 2.8\nkpc and a large stellar velocity dispersion of 308 km/s for its K-band\nluminosity of 1.4x10^11 L_sun. Using integral-field spectroscopy assisted by\nadaptive optics from Gemini North, we measure spatially resolved stellar\nkinematics within ~450 pc of the galaxy nucleus. The galaxy exhibits regular\nrotation with velocities of \\pm 180 km/s and a sharply peaked velocity\ndispersion profile that reaches 425 km/s at the center. We fit axisymmetric,\norbit-based dynamical models to the combination of these high angular\nresolution kinematics, large-scale kinematics extending to roughly three\neffective radii, and Hubble Space Telescope imaging, resulting in a constraint\nof the mass of the central black hole in Mrk 1216. After exploring several\npossible sources of systematics that commonly affect stellar-dynamical black\nhole mass measurements, we find a black hole mass of (4.9\\pm1.7)x10^9 M_sun and\na H-band stellar mass-to-light ratio of 1.3\\pm0.4 M_sun/L_sun (1-sigma\nuncertainties). Mrk 1216 is consistent with the local black hole mass - stellar\nvelocity dispersion relation, but is a factor of ~5-10 larger than expectations\nfrom the black hole mass - bulge luminosity and black hole mass - bulge mass\ncorrelations when conservatively using the galaxy's total luminosity or stellar\nmass. This behavior is quite similar to the extensively studied compact galaxy\nNGC 1277. Resembling the z~2 quiescent galaxies, Mrk 1216 may be a passively\nevolved descendant, and perhaps reflects a previous era when galaxies contained\nover-massive black holes relative to their bulge luminosities/masses, and the\ngrowth of host galaxies had yet to catch up.\n", "  A spin wave majority fork-like structure with feature size of 40\\,nm, is\npresented and investigated, through micromagnetic simulations. The structure\nconsists of three merging out-of-plane magnetization spin wave buses and four\nmagneto-electric cells serving as three inputs and an output. The information\nof the logic signals is encoded in the phase of the transmitted spin waves and\nsubsequently stored as direction of magnetization of the magneto-electric cells\nupon detection. The minimum dimensions of the structure that produce an\noperational majority gate are identified. For all input combinations, the\ndetection scheme employed manages to capture the majority phase result of the\nspin wave interference and ignore all reflection effects induced by the\ngeometry of the structure.\n", "  This work presents an elegant formalism to model the evolution of the full\ntwo rigid body problem. The equations of motion, given in a Cartesian\ncoordinate system, are expressed in terms of spherical harmonics and Wigner\nD-matrices. The algorithm benefits from the numerous recurrence relations\nsatisfied by these functions allowing a fast evaluation of the mutual\npotential. Moreover, forces and torques are straightforwardly obtained by\napplication of ladder operators taken from the angular momentum theory and\ncommonly used in quantum mechanics. A numerical implementation of this\nalgorithm is made. Tests show that the present code is significantly faster\nthan those currently available in literature.\n", "  Many planets orbit within an AU of their stars, raising questions about their\norigins. Particularly puzzling are the planets found near the silicate\nsublimation front. We investigate conditions near the front in the protostellar\ndisk around a young intermediate-mass star, using the first global 3-D\nradiation non-ideal MHD simulations in this context. We treat the starlight\nheating; the silicate grains sublimation and deposition at the local,\ntime-varying temperature and density; temperature-dependent Ohmic dissipation;\nand various initial magnetic fields. The results show magnetorotational\nturbulence around the sublimation front at 0.5 AU. The disk interior to 0.8 AU\nis turbulent, with velocities exceeding 10% of the sound speed. Beyond 0.8 AU\nis the dead zone, cooler than 1000 K and with turbulence orders of magnitude\nweaker. A local pressure maximum just inside the dead zone concentrates solid\nparticles, favoring their growth. Over many orbits, a vortex develops at the\ndead zones inner edge, increasing the disks thickness locally by around 10%. We\nsynthetically observe the results using Monte Carlo transfer calculations,\nfinding the sublimation front is near-infrared bright. The models with net\nvertical magnetic fields develop extended, magnetically-supported atmospheres\nthat reprocess extra starlight, raising the near-infrared flux 20%.The vortex\nthrows a nonaxisymmetric shadow on the outer disk. At wavelengths > 2 micron,\nthe flux varies several percent on monthly timescales. The variations are more\nregular when the vortex is present. The vortex is directly visible as an arc at\nultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths, given sub-AU spatial resolution.\n", "  Only a few hot Jupiters are known to orbit around fast rotating stars. These\nexoplanets are harder to detect and characterize and may be less common than\naround slow rotators. Here, we report the discovery of the transiting hot\nJupiter XO-6b, which orbits a bright, hot, and fast rotating star: V = 10.25,\nTeff = 6720 +/- 100 K, v sin i = 48 +/- 3 km/s. We detected the planet from its\ntransits using the XO instruments and conducted a follow-up campaign. Because\nof the fast stellar rotation, radial velocities taken along the orbit do not\nyield the planet's mass with a high confidence level, but we secure a 3-sigma\nupper limit Mp < 4.4 MJup. We also obtain high resolution spectroscopic\nobservations of the transit with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 193-cm\ntelescope of the Observatoire de Haute-Provence and analyze the stellar lines\nprofile by Doppler tomography. The transit is clearly detected in the spectra.\nThe radii measured independently from the tomographic analysis and from the\nphotometric lightcurves are consistent, showing that the object detected by\nboth methods is the same and indeed transits in front of XO-6. We find that\nXO-6b lies on a prograde and misaligned orbit with a sky-projected obliquity\nlambda = -20.7 +/- 2.3 deg. The rotation period of the star is shorter than the\norbital period of the planet: Prot < 2.12 days, Porb = 3.77 days. Thus, this\nsystem stands in a largely unexplored regime of dynamical interactions between\nclose-in giant planets and their host stars.\n", "  We present new bulge stellar velocity dispersion measurements for 10 active\ngalaxies with secure $M_{BH}$ determinations from reverberation-mapping. These\nnew velocity dispersion measurements are based on spatially resolved kinematics\nfrom integral-field (IFU) spectroscopy. In all but one case, the field of view\nof the IFU extends beyond the effective radius of the galaxy, and in the case\nof Mrk 79 the field of view extends to almost one half the effective radius.\nThis combination of spatial resolution and field of view allows for secure\ndeterminations of stellar velocity dispersion within the effective radius for\nall 10 target galaxies. Spatially resolved maps of the first (V) and second\n($\\sigma_{\\star}$) moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD)\nindicate the presence of kinematic substructure in most cases. In future\nprojects we plan to explore methods of correcting for the effects of kinematic\nsubstructure in the derived bulge stellar velocity dispersion measurements.\n", "  We provide an observational view of evolutionary models in the\nHertzsprung--Russell diagram, on the main sequence. For that we computed\nevolutionary models with the code STAREVOL for 15 < M/Msun < 100. We\nsubsequently calculated atmosphere models at specific points along the\nevolutionary tracks, using the code CMFGEN. Synthetic spectra obtained in this\nway were classified as if they were observational data. We tested our spectral\nclassification by comparison to observed spectra of various stars. We also\ncompared our results with empirical data of a large number of OB stars. We\nobtain spectroscopic sequences along evolutionary tracks. In our computations,\nthe earliest O stars (O2-3.5) appear only above ~50 Msun. For later spectral\ntypes, a similar mass limit exists, but is lower. A luminosity class V does not\ncorrespond to the entire main sequence. This only holds for the 15 Msun track.\nAs mass increases, a larger portion of the main sequence is spent in luminosity\nclass III. Above 50 Msun, supergiants appear before the end of core-hydrogen\nburning. Dwarf stars do not occur on the zero-age main sequence above 80 Msun.\nConsequently, the distribution of luminosity class V in the HR diagram cannot\nbe used to constrain the size of the convective core. The distribution of\ndwarfs and giants in the HR diagram agrees well with the location of stars\nanalyzed by means of quantitative spectroscopy. For supergiants, there is a\nslight discrepancy in the sense that luminosity class I is observed slightly\nearlier than our predictions. This is mainly due to wind densities that affect\nthe luminosity class diagnostic lines. We predict an upper mass limit for dwarf\nstars (~60 Msun) that is found consistent with the rarity of O2V stars in the\nGalaxy. Stars with WNh spectral type are not predicted by our models. Stronger\nwinds are required to produce the characteristic emission lines of these\nobjects.\n", "  We quantize the moduli space of supersymmetric microstates describing\nfour-dimensional black holes with AdS$_2$$\\times$S$^2$ asymptotics. To acquire\nthe commutation relations of quantization, we find the symplectic form that is\nimposed in the Type IIB SUGRA and defined in the space of solutions\nparameterized by one complex harmonic function in ${R}^3$ with sources\ndistributed along closed curves.\n", "  We consider, in the harmonic superspace approach, the six-dimensional N=(1,0)\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge multiplet minimally coupled to a hypermultiplet\nin an arbitrary representation of the gauge group. Using the superfield\nproper-time and background-field techniques, we compute the divergent part of\nthe one-loop effective action depending on both the gauge multiplet and the\nhypermultiplet. We demonstrate that in the particular case of N=(1,1) SYM\ntheory, which corresponds to the hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation,\nall one-loop divergencies vanish, so that N=(1,1) SYM theory is one-loop finite\n{\\it off shell}.\n", "  We present an updated calculation of the uncertainties on the atmospheric\nmuon-neutrino flux arising from cosmic-ray primaries. For the first time, we\ninclude recent measurements of the cosmic-ray primaries collected since 2005.\nWe apply a statistical technique that allows the determination of correlations\nbetween the parameters of the GSHL primary-flux parametrisation and the\nincorporation of these correlations into the uncertainty on the muon-neutrino\nflux. We obtain an uncertainty related to the primary cosmic rays of around\n$(5\\text{--}15)\\%$, depending on energy, which is about a factor of two smaller\nthan the previously determined uncertainty. The hadron production uncertainty\nis added in quadrature to obtain the total uncertainty on the neutrino flux,\nwhich is reduced by $\\approx 5\\%$. To take into account an unexpected hardening\nof the spectrum of primaries above energies of $100$ $\\text{GeV}$ observed in\nrecent measurements, we propose an alternative parametrisation and discuss its\nimpact on the neutrino flux uncertainties.\n", "  The Weibel instability driven by two symmetric counter-streaming relativistic\nelectron plasmas, also referred to as current-filamentation instability, is\nstudied in a constant and uniform external magnetic field aligned with the\nplasma flows. Both the linear and non linear stages of the instability are\ninvestigated using analytical modeling and Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations.\nWhile previous studies have already described the stabilizing effect of the\nmagnetic field, we show here that the saturation stage is only weakly affected.\nThe different mechanisms responsible for the saturation are discussed in detail\nin the relativistic cold fluid framework considering a single unstable mode.\nThe application of an external field leads to a slighlt increase of the\nsaturation level for large wavelengths, while it does not affect the small\nwavelengths. Multi-mode and temperature effects are then investigated. While at\nlarge temperature the saturation level is independent of the external magnetic\nfield, at small but finite temperature the competition between different modes\nin the presence of an external magnetic field leads to a saturation level lower\nwith respect to the unmagnetized case.\n", "  We have investigated the magneto-ionic turbulence in the interstellar medium\nthrough spatial gradients of the complex radio polarization vector in the\nCanadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). The CGPS data cover 1300 square-degrees,\nover the range ${53^{\\circ}}\\leq{\\ell}\\leq{192^{\\circ}}$,\n${-3^{\\circ}}\\leq{b}\\leq{5^{\\circ}}$ with an extension to ${b}={17.5^{\\circ}}$\nin the range ${101^{\\circ}}\\leq{\\ell}\\leq{116^{\\circ}}$, and arcminute\nresolution at 1420 MHz. Previous studies found a correlation between the\nskewness and kurtosis of the polarization gradient and the Mach number of the\nturbulence, or assumed this correlation to deduce the Mach number of an\nobserved turbulent region. We present polarization gradient images of the\nentire CGPS dataset, and analyze the dependence of these images on angular\nresolution. The polarization gradients are filamentary, and the length of these\nfilaments is largest towards the Galactic anti-center, and smallest towards the\ninner Galaxy. This may imply that small-scale turbulence is stronger in the\ninner Galaxy, or that we observe more distant features at low Galactic\nlongitudes. For every resolution studied, the skewness of the polarization\ngradient is influenced by the edges of bright polarization gradient regions,\nwhich are not related to the turbulence revealed by the polarization gradients.\nWe also find that the skewness of the polarization gradient is sensitive to the\nsize of the box used to calculate the skewness, but insensitive to Galactic\nlongitude, implying that the skewness only probes the number and magnitude of\nthe inhomogeneities within the box. We conclude that the skewness and kurtosis\nof the polarization gradient are not ideal statistics for probing natural\nmagneto-ionic turbulence.\n", "  In this Letter we report high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction\nand transmission electron microscope analysis of Mn-substituted LaFeAsO\nsamples, demonstrating that a static incommensurate modulated structure\ndevelops across the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, whose modulation\nwave-vector depends on the Mn content. The incommensurate structural distortion\nis likely originating from a charge-density-wave instability, a periodic\nmodulation of the density of conduction electrons associated with a modulation\nof the atomic positions. Our results add a new component in the physics of\nFe-based superconductors, indicating that the density wave ordering is\ncharge-driven.\n", "  The aim of this study is to analyze the interaction of charged particles\n(ions and electrons) with randomly formed particle scatterers (e.g.\\ large\nscale local \"magnetic fluctuations\" or \"coherent magnetic irregularities\"),\nusing the set up proposed initially by \\cite{Fermi49}. These scatterers are\nformed by the explosive magnetic energy release and propagate with the Alfv\\'en\nspeed along the irregular magnetic fields. They are large scale local\nfluctuations ($\\delta B/B \\approx 1$), randomly distributed inside the unstable\nmagnetic topology and will here be called {\\bf Alfv\\'enic Scatterers (AS)}. We\nconstructed a 3D grid on which a small fraction of randomly chosen grid points\nare acting as AS. In particular, we study how a large number of test particles\nevolve inside a collection of AS, analyzing the evolution of their energy\ndistribution and their escape time distribution. We use a well established\nmethod to estimate the transport coefficients directly from the trajectories of\nthe particles. Using the estimated transport coefficients and solving the\nFokker-Planck (FP) equation numerically, we can recover the energy distribution\nof the particles. We have shown that the Stochastic Fermi Energization (SFE) of\nmildly relativistic and relativistic plasma can heat and accelerate the tail of\nthe ambient particle distribution as predicted by \\citet{Parker58} and\n\\citet{Ramaty79}. The temperature of the hot plasma and the tail of the\nenergetic particles depend on the mean free path ($\\lambda_{\\rm sc}$) of the\nparticles between the scatterers inside the energization volume.\n", "  We study the acceleration of electrons and positrons at an\nelectromagnetically modified, ultra-relativistic shock in the context of pulsar\nwind nebulae (PWNe). We simulate the outflow produced by an obliquely rotating\npulsar in proximity of its termination shock with a two-fluid code which uses a\nmagnetic shear wave to mimic the properties of the wind. We integrate electron\ntrajectories in the test-particle limit in the resulting background\nelectromagnetic fields to analyse the injection mechanism. We find that the\nshock-precursor structure energizes and reflects a sizeable fraction of\nparticles, which becomes available for further acceleration. We investigate the\nsubsequent first-order Fermi process sustained by small-scale magnetic\nfluctuations with a Monte Carlo code. We find that the acceleration proceeds in\ntwo distinct regimes: when the gyro-radius $r_{\\textrm{g}}$ exceeds the\nwavelength of the shear $\\lambda$, the process is remarkably similar to\nfirst-order Fermi acceleration at relativistic, parallel shocks. This regime\ncorresponds to a low density wind which allows the propagation of superluminal\nwaves. When $r_{\\textrm{g}}<\\lambda$, which corresponds to the scenario of\ndriven reconnection, the spectrum is softer.\n", "  We present the results from a wide-field spectroscopic survey of globular\nclusters (GCs) in the Virgo Cluster. We obtain spectra for 201 GCs and 55\nultracompact dwarfs (UCDs) using the Hectospec on the Multiple Mirror\nTelescope, and derive their radial velocities. We identify 46 genuine\nintracluster GCs (IGCs), not associated with any Virgo galaxies, using the 3D\nGMM test on the spatial and radial velocity distribution.They are located at\nthe projected distance 200 kpc $\\lesssim$ R $\\lesssim$ 500 kpc from the center\nof M87. The radial velocity distribution of these IGCs shows two peaks, one at\n$v_{\\rm r}$ = 1023 km s$^{-1}$ associated with the Virgo main body, and another\nat $v_{\\rm r}$ = 36 km s$^{-1}$ associated with the infalling structure. The\nvelocity dispersion of the IGCs in the Virgo main body is $\\sigma_{\\rm{GC}}\n\\sim$ 314 km s$^{-1}$, which is smoothly connected to the velocity dispersion\nprofile of M87 GCs, but much lower than that of dwarf galaxies in the same\nsurvey field, $\\sigma_{\\rm{dwarf}} \\sim$ 608 km s$^{-1}$. The UCDs are more\ncentrally concentrated on massive galaxies, M87, M86, and M84. The radial\nvelocity dispersion of the UCD system is much smaller than that of dwarf\ngalaxies. Our results confirm the large-scale distribution of Virgo IGCs\nindicated by previous photometric surveys. The color distribution of the\nconfirmed IGCs shows a bimodality similar to that of M87 GCs. This indicates\nthat most IGCs are stripped off from dwarf galaxies and some from massive\ngalaxies in the Virgo.\n", "  We present new ALMA Band 7 ($\\sim340$ GHz) observations of the dense gas\ntracers HCN, HCO$^+$, and CS in the local, single-nucleus, ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxy IRAS 13120-5453. We find centrally enhanced HCN (4-3) emission,\nrelative to HCO$^+$ (4-3), but do not find evidence for radiative pumping of\nHCN. Considering the size of the starburst (0.5 kpc) and the estimated\nsupernovae rate of $\\sim1.2$ yr$^{-1}$, the high HCN/HCO$^+$ ratio can be\nexplained by an enhanced HCN abundance as a result of mechanical heating by the\nsupernovae, though the active galactic nucleus and winds may also contribute\nadditional mechanical heating. The starburst size implies a high $\\Sigma_{IR}$\nof $4.7\\times10^{12}$ $L_{\\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$, slightly below predictions of\nradiation-pressure limited starbursts. The HCN line profile has low-level\nwings, which we tentatively interpret as evidence for outflowing dense\nmolecular gas. However, the dense molecular outflow seen in the HCN line wings\nis unlikely to escape the galaxy and is destined to return to the nucleus and\nfuel future star formation. We also present modeling of Herschel observations\nof the H$_2$O lines and find a nuclear dust temperature of $\\sim40$ K. IRAS\n13120-5453 has a lower dust temperature and $\\Sigma_{IR}$ than is inferred for\nthe systems termed \"compact obscured nuclei\" (such as Arp 220 and Mrk 231). If\nIRAS 13120-5453 has undergone a compact obscured nucleus phase, we are likely\nwitnessing it at a time when the feedback has already inflated the nuclear ISM\nand diluted star formation in the starburst/AGN core.\n", "  Single molecule time trajectories of biomolecules provide glimpses into\ncomplex folding landscapes that are difficult to visualize using conventional\nensemble measurements. Recent experiments and theoretical analyses have\nhighlighted dynamic disorder in certain classes of biomolecules, whose dynamic\npattern of conformational transitions is affected by slower transition dynamics\nof internal state hidden in a low dimensional projection. A systematic means to\nanalyze such data is, however, currently not well developed. Here we report a\nnew algorithm - Variational Bayes-double chain Markov model (VB-DCMM) - to\nanalyze single molecule time trajectories that display dynamic disorder. The\nproposed analysis employing VB-DCMM allows us to detect the presence of dynamic\ndisorder, if any, in each trajectory, identify the number of internal states,\nand estimate transition rates between the internal states as well as the rates\nof conformational transition within each internal state. Applying VB-DCMM\nalgorithm to single molecule FRET data of H-DNA in 100 mM-Na$^+$ solution,\nfollowed by data clustering, we show that at least 6 kinetic paths linking 4\ndistinct internal states are required to correctly interpret the duplex-triplex\ntransitions of H-DNA.\n", "  The chemical abundance ratios and radial velocities for two stars in the\nrecently discovered Triangulum II faint dwarf galaxy have been determined from\nhigh resolution, medium signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the Gemini-GRACES\nfacility. These stars have stellar parameters and metallicities similar to\nthose derived from their photometry and medium-resolution Ca II triplet\nspectra, and supports that Triangulum II has a metallicity spread consistent\nwith chemical evolution in a dwarf galaxy. The elemental abundances show that\nboth stars have typical calcium abundances and barium upper limits for their\nmetallicities, but low magnesium and sodium. This chemical composition\nresembles some stars in dwarf galaxies, attributed to inhomogeneous mixing in a\nlow star formation environment, and/or yields from only a few supernova events.\nOne of our targets (Star40) has an enhancement in potassium, and resembles some\nstars in the unusual outer halo star cluster, NGC 2419. Our other target\n(Star46) appears to be a binary based on a change in its radial velocity (Delta\nv(rad) = 24.5 +/- 2.1 km/s). This is consistent with variations found in binary\nstars in other dwarf galaxies. While this serves as a reminder of the high\nbinary fraction in these ultra faint dwarf galaxies, this particular object has\nhad little impact on the previous determination of the velocity dispersion in\nTriangulum II.\n", "  In this brief communication a new method is outlined for modelling\nmagnification patterns on an observer's plane using a first order approximation\nto the null geodesic path equations for a point mass lens. For each ray emitted\nfrom a source, an explicit calculation is made for the change in position on\nthe observer's plane due to each lens mass. By counting the number of points in\neach small area of the observer's plane, the magnification at that point can be\ndetermined. This allows for a very simple and transparent algorithm. A short\nMatlab code sample for creating simple magnification maps due to multiple point\nlenses is included in an appendix.\n", "  Numerical simulations in a tight-binding model have shown that an\nintersection of topologically protected one-dimensional chiral channels can\nfunction as a beam splitter for non-interacting fermions on a two-dimensional\nlattice \\cite{Qiao2011,Qiao2014}. Here we confirm this result analytically in\nthe corresponding continuum $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}$ model, by solving the\nassociated two-dimensional Dirac equation, in the presence of a `checkerboard'\npotential that provides a right-angled intersection between two zero-line\nmodes. The method by which we obtain our analytical solutions is systematic and\npotentially generalizable to similar problems involving intersections of\none-dimensional systems.\n", "  The stellar initial mass function (IMF), which is often assumed to be\nuniversal across unresolved stellar populations, has recently been suggested to\nbe \"bottom-heavy\" for massive ellipticals. In these galaxies, the prevalence of\ngravity-sensitive absorption lines (e.g. Na I and Ca II) in their near-IR\nspectra implies an excess of low-mass ($m <= 0.5$ $M_\\odot$) stars over that\nexpected from a canonical IMF observed in low-mass ellipticals. A direct\nextrapolation of such a bottom-heavy IMF to high stellar masses ($m >= 8$\n$M_\\odot$) would lead to a corresponding deficit of neutron stars and black\nholes, and therefore of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), per unit near-IR\nluminosity in these galaxies. Peacock et al. (2014) searched for evidence of\nthis trend and found that the observed number of LMXBs per unit $K$-band\nluminosity ($N/L_K$) was nearly constant. We extend this work using new and\narchival Chandra X-ray Observatory (Chandra) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nobservations of seven low-mass ellipticals where $N/L_K$ is expected to be the\nlargest and compare these data with a variety of IMF models to test which are\nconsistent with the observed $N/L_K$. We reproduce the result of Peacock et al.\n(2014), strengthening the constraint that the slope of the IMF at $m >= 8$\n$M_\\odot$ must be consistent with a Kroupa-like IMF. We construct an IMF model\nthat is a linear combination of a Milky Way-like IMF and a broken power-law\nIMF, with a steep slope ($\\alpha_1=$ $3.84$) for stars < 0.5 $M_\\odot$ (as\nsuggested by near-IR indices), and that flattens out ($\\alpha_2=$ $2.14$) for\nstars > 0.5 $M_\\odot$, and discuss its wider ramifications and limitations.\n", "  We present the Late-Type Extension to the Motion Verified Red Stars\n(LaTE-MoVeRS) catalog, containing 46,463 photometric late-type ($>$ M5) dwarfs\nwithin the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint. Proper motions were\ncomputed for objects combining astrometry from the SDSS Data Release 12 (DR12),\nthe Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) Point Source Catalog (PSC), and the\n\\emph{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} (\\emph{WISE}) AllWISE datasets.\nLaTE-MoVeRS objects were required to have significant proper motion\n($\\mu_\\mathrm{tot} \\geqslant 2\\sigma_{\\mu_\\mathrm{tot}}$). Using the\nLaTE-MoVeRS sample and \\emph{Gaia} Data Release 1, we estimate \\emph{Gaia} will\nbe $\\sim$64\\% complete for very-low-mass objects ($>$ M5) in comparison to the\ncombined SDSS+2MASS+\\emph{WISE} dataset ($i < 21.3$). We computed photometric\ndistances and estimated stellar effective temperatures for the LaTE-MoVeRS\ncatalog. The majority of the dwarfs in the sample have distances $< 150$ pc and\n$T_\\mathrm{eff} < 3000$ K. Thirteen objects were identified within LaTE-MoVeRS\nwith estimated photometric distances within 25 pc that have not been previously\nidentified as nearby objects. We also identified one new object with a large\namount of excess mid-infrared flux that has not been previously identified\n(2MASS J11151597$+$1937266). This object appears to be an L2$\\gamma$ at\n$\\sim$50 pc showing spectroscopic signs of a flaring event (e.g., strong\nHydrogen Balmer emission lines). This object does not exhibit kinematics\nsimilar to any known kinematic association. The LaTE-MoVeRS catalog is\navailable through SDSS CasJobs and VizieR.\n", "  Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) enzymes have attracted considerable\nattention due to their ability to enhance polysaccharide depolymerization,\nmaking them interesting in respect to production of biofuel from cellulose. The\nLPMOs are metalloenzymes that contain a mononuclear copper active site that can\nactive dioxygen. However, many details of this activation are unclear, and have\npreviously been investigated from a computational angle. Yet, these studies\nhave either employed only molecular mechanics (MM), which are inaccurate for\nmetal active sites, or they have described only the active site with quantum\nmechanics (QM) and neglected the effect of the protein. Here, we employ hybrid\nQM and MM (QM/MM) methods to investigate the first steps of the LPMO mechanism,\nwhich is reduction of of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and formation of a Cu(II)-superoxide\ncomplex. In the latter complex, the superoxide can bind either in an equatorial\nor an axial position. For both steps we obtain structures that are markedly\ndifferent from previous suggestions, based on vacuum calculations. Our\ncalculations show that the equatorial isomer of the superoxide complex is over\n60 kJ/mol more stable than the axial isomer, being stabilized by interactions\nwith a second-coordination-sphere Gln residue, showing a possible role for this\nresidue. Coordination of superoxide in this manner is in agreement with recent\nexperimental suggestions.\n", "  Boron carbide exhibits intrinsic substitutional disorder over a broad\ncomposition range. The structure consists of 12-atom icosahedra placed at the\nvertices of a rhombohedral lattice, together with a 3-atom chain along the\n3-fold axis. In the high carbon limit, one or two carbons can replace borons on\nthe icosahedra while the chains are primarily of type C-B-C. We fit an\ninteratomic pair interaction model to density functional theory total energies\nto investigate the substitutional carbon disorder. Monte Carlo simulations with\nsampling improved by replica exchange and augmented by 2d multiple histogram\nanalysis, predicts three phases. The low temperature, high carbon composition\nmonoclinic Cm \"tilted polar\" structure disorders through a pair of phase\ntransitions, first via an Ising-like transition to a \"bipolar\" state with space\ngroup C2/m, then via a first order 3-state Potts-like transition to the\nexperimentally observed \"nonpolar\" \\bar{R}3m symmetry.\n", "  The performance of quantum heat engines is generally based on the analysis of\na single cycle. We challenge this approach by showing that the total work\nperformed by a quantum engine need not be proportional to the number of cycles.\nFurthermore, optimizing the engine over multiple cycles leads to the\nidentification of scenarios with a quantum enhancement. We demonstrate our\nfindings with a quantum Otto engine based on a two-level system as the working\nsubstance that supplies power to an external oscillator.\n", "  We investigate the zero-temperature quantum phase transitions of the\ndisordered three-color quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain by means of large-scale\nMonte Carlo simulations. We find that the first-order phase transitions of the\nclean system are rounded by the quenched disorder. For weak inter-color\ncoupling, the resulting emergent quantum critical point between the\nparamagnetic phase and the magnetically ordered Baxter phase is of\ninfinite-randomness type and belongs to the universality class of the random\ntransverse-field Ising model, as predicted by recent strong-disorder\nrenormalization group calculations. We also find evidence for unconventional\ncritical behavior in the case of strong inter-color coupling, even though an\nunequivocal determination of the universality class is beyond our numerical\ncapabilities. We compare our results to earlier simulations, and we discuss\nimplications for the classification of phase transitions in the presence of\ndisorder.\n", "  Stimulated by the discovery of a number of close-in low-density planets, we\ngeneralise the Jeans escape parameter taking hydrodynamic and Roche lobe\neffects into account. We furthermore define $\\Lambda$ as the value of the Jeans\nescape parameter calculated at the observed planetary radius and mass for the\nplanet's equilibrium temperature and considering atomic hydrogen, independently\nof the atmospheric temperature profile. We consider 5 and 10 $M_{\\oplus}$\nplanets with an equilibrium temperature of 500 and 1000 K, orbiting early G-,\nK-, and M-type stars. Assuming a clear atmosphere and by comparing escape rates\nobtained from the energy-limited formula, which only accounts for the heating\ninduced by the absorption of the high-energy stellar radiation, and from a\nhydrodynamic atmosphere code, which also accounts for the bolometric heating,\nwe find that planets whose $\\Lambda$ is smaller than 15-35 lie in the\n\"boil-off\" regime, where the escape is driven by the atmospheric thermal energy\nand low planetary gravity. We find that the atmosphere of hot (i.e. $T_{\\rm\neq}\\gtrapprox$ 1000 K) low-mass ($M_{\\rm pl}\\lessapprox$ 5 $M_{\\oplus}$)\nplanets with $\\Lambda$ < 15-35 shrinks to smaller radii so that their $\\Lambda$\nevolves to values higher than 15-35, hence out of the boil-off regime, in less\nthan $\\approx$500 Myr. Because of their small Roche lobe radius, we find the\nsame result also for hot (i.e. $T_{\\rm eq}\\gtrapprox$ 1000 K) higher mass\n($M_{\\rm pl}\\lessapprox$ 10 $M_{\\oplus}$) planets with $\\Lambda$ < 15-35, when\nthey orbit M-dwarfs. For old, hydrogen-dominated planets in this range of\nparameters, $\\Lambda$ should therefore be $\\geq$15-35, which provides a strong\nconstraint on the planetary minimum mass and maximum radius and can be used to\npredict the presence of aerosols and/or constrain planetary masses, for\nexample.\n", "  We present high spatial resolution mid-infrared images of the nebula around\nthe late-type carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC)-OB binary system WR~112 taken by the\nrecently upgraded VLT spectrometer and imager for the mid-infrared (VISIR) with\nthe PAH1, NeII\\_2, and Q3 filters. The observations reveal a morphology\nresembling a series of arc-like filaments and broken shells. Dust temperatures\nand masses are derived for each of the identified filamentary structures, which\nexhibit temperatures ranging from $179_{-6}^{+8}$ K at the exterior W2 filament\nto $355_{-25}^{+37}$ K in the central 3\". The total dust mass summed over the\nfeatures is $2.6\\pm0.4\\times10^{-5}$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. A multi-epoch analysis\nof mid-IR photometry of WR~112 over the past $\\sim20$ yr reveals no significant\nvariability in the observed dust temperature and mass. The morphology of the\nmid-IR dust emission from WR~112 also exhibits no significant expansion from\nimaging data taken in 2001, 2007, and 2016, which disputes the current\ninterpretation of the nebula as a high expansion velocity ($\\sim1200$ km\ns$^{-1}$) \"pinwheel\"-shaped outflow driven by the central WC-OB colliding-wind\nbinary. An upper limit of $\\lesssim120$ km s$^{-1}$ is derived for the\nexpansion velocity assuming a distance of $4.15$ kpc. The upper limit on the\naverage total mass-loss rate from the central 3\" of WR~112 is estimated to be\n$\\lesssim8\\times10^{-6}$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We leave its true nature\nas an open question, but propose that the WR~112 nebula may have formed in the\noutflow during a previous red or yellow supergiant phase of the central\nWolf-Rayet star.\n", "  We aim to explore the relationship between globular cluster total number,\n$N_{\\rm GC}$, and central black hole mass, $M_\\bullet$, in spiral galaxies, and\ncompare it with that recently reported for ellipticals. We present results for\nthe Sbc galaxy NGC 4258, from Canada France Hawaii Telescope data. Thanks to\nwater masers with Keplerian rotation in a circumnuclear disk, NGC 4258 has the\nmost precisely measured extragalactic distance and supermassive black hole mass\nto date. The globular cluster (GC) candidate selection is based on the ($u^*\\\n-\\ i^\\prime$) vs. ($i^\\prime\\ -\\ K_s$) diagram, which is a superb tool to\ndistinguish GCs from foreground stars, background galaxies, and young stellar\nclusters, and hence can provide the best number counts of GCs from photometry\nalone, virtually free of contamination, even if the galaxy is not completely\nedge-on. The mean optical and optical-near infrared colors of the clusters are\nconsistent with those of the Milky Way and M 31, after extinction is taken into\naccount. We directly identify 39 GC candidates; after completeness correction,\nGC luminosity function extrapolation and correction for spatial coverage, we\ncalculate a total $N_{\\rm GC} = 144\\pm31^{+38}_{-36}$ (random and systematic\nuncertainties, respectively). We have thus increased to 6 the sample of spiral\ngalaxies with measurements of both $M_\\bullet$ and $N_{\\rm GC}$. NGC 4258 has a\nspecific frequency $S_{\\rm N} = 0.4\\pm0.1$ (random uncertainty), and is\nconsistent within 2$\\sigma$ with the $N_{\\rm GC}$ vs. $M_\\bullet$ correlation\nfollowed by elliptical galaxies. The Milky Way continues to be the only spiral\nthat deviates significantly from the relation.\n", "  GRB 160821B is a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) at redshift $z=0.16$, with a\nduration less than 1 second and without detection of any \"extended emission\" up\nto more than 100 seconds in both {\\em Swift}/BAT and {\\em Fermi}/GBM bands. An\nX-ray plateau with a sharp drop 180 seconds after the BAT trigger was observed\nwith {\\em Swift}/XRT. No supernova or kilo-nova signature was detected.\nAssuming the central engine of this SGRB is a recently born supra-massive\nmagnetar, we can explain the SGRB as jet radiation and its X-ray plateau as the\ninternal energy dissipation of the pulsar wind as it spins down. We constrain\nits surface magnetic field as $B_{\\rm p}<3.12\\times 10^{16}$ G and initial spin\nperiod as $P_0< 8.5\\times 10^{-3}$ seconds. Its equation of state is consistent\nwith the GM1 model with $M_{\\rm TOV} \\sim 2.37 M_\\odot$ and ellipticity\n$\\epsilon<0.07$. Its gravitational wave (GW) radiation may be detectable with\nthe future Einstein Telescope, but is much weaker than the current\ndetectability limit of advanced-LIGO. The GW radiation of such an event would\nbe detectable by advanced-LIGO if it occurred at a distance of 100 Mpc\n($z=0.023$).\n", "  We consider energy budgets and radiative history of 8 fading AGN, identified\nfrom mismatch between the ionizion of very extended (>10 kpc) ionized clouds\nand the luminosity of the nucleus viewed directly. All show significant fading\non ~50,000-year timescales. We explore the use of minimum ionizing luminosity Q\nderived from photoionization balance in the brightest pixels in H-alpha at each\nprojected radius. Tests using PG QSOs, and one target with detailed\nphotoionization modeling, suggest that we can derive useful histories of\nindividual AGN; the minimum ionizing luminosity is always an underestimate and\nsubject to fine structure in the ionized material. These tests suggest that the\nunderestimation from the upper envelope of Q values is roughly constant for a\ngiven object. These AGN show rapid drops and standstills; the common feature is\na rapid drop in the last 20,000 years before our view of the nucleus. E-folding\ntimescales are mostly thousands of years, with a few episodes as short as 400.\nIn the limit of largely obscured AGN, we find additional evidence for fading,\ncomparing lower limits from recombination balance and the maximum luminosities\nderived from from infrared fluxes. We compare these long-term light curves to\nsimulations of AGN accretion; the strongest variations on these timespans are\nseen in models with strong and local feedback. Gemini integral-field optical\nspectroscopy shows a very limited role for outflows in these structures. While\nrings and loops of emission are common, their kinematic structure shows some to\nbe in regular rotation. UGC 7342 exhibits local signatures of outflows <300\nkm/s, largely associated with very diffuse emission. Only in the Teacup AGN do\nwe see outflow signatures of order 1000 km/s. Clouds around these fading AGN\nconsist largely of tidal debris being externally illuminated but not displaced\nby AGN outflows. (Abridged)\n", "  We investigate the formation of close-in planets in near-coplanar eccentric\nhierarchical triple systems via the secular interaction between an inner planet\nand an outer perturber (Coplanar High-eccentricity Migration, CHEM). We\ngeneralize the previous work on the analytical condition for successful CHEM\nfor point masses interacting only through gravity by taking into account the\nfinite mass effect of the inner planet. We find that efficient CHEM requires\nthat the systems should have m_1<<m_0 and m_1<<m_2. In addition to the gravity\nfor point masses, we examine the importance of the short-range forces, and\nprovide an analytical estimate of the migration time scale. We perform a series\nof numerical simulations in CHEM for systems consisting of a sun-like central\nstar, giant gas inner planet and planetary outer perturber, including the\nshort-range forces and stellar and planetary dissipative tides. We find that\nmost of such systems end up with a tidal disruption, a small fraction of the\nsystems produce prograde hot Jupiters (HJs), but no retrograde one. In\naddition, we extend CHEM to super-Earth mass range, and show that the formation\nof close-in super-Earths in prograde orbits is also possible. Finally, we carry\nout CHEM simulation for the observed hierarchical triple and counter-orbiting\nHJ systems. We find that CHEM can explain a part of the former systems, but it\nis generally very difficult to reproduce counter-orbiting HJ systems.\n", "  The cosmic ray energy spectra of protons and helium nuclei, which are the\nmost abundant components of cosmic radiation, exhibit a remarkable hardening at\nenergies above one hundred GeV/nucleon. Recent data from AMS-02 confirms this\nfeature with a higher significance. This data challenges the current models of\ncosmic ray acceleration in Galactic sources and propagation in the Galaxy.\nHere, we explain the observed break in the spectra of proton and helium nuclei\nin light of recent advances of cosmic ray diffusion theories in turbulent\nastrophysical sources as a result of a transition between different cosmic ray\ndiffusion regimes. We reconstruct the observed cosmic ray spectra using the\nfact that transition from normal diffusion to superdiffusion changes the\nefficiency of particle acceleration and causes the change in the spectral\nindex. We find that calculated proton and helium spectra match very well with\nthe data.\n", "  A new metallic radical cation salt\n$\\kappa$-(BETS)$_2$Co$_{0.13}$Mn$_{0.87}$[N(CN)$_2$]$_3$, where BETS is\nbis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene, C$_{10}$S$_4$Se$_4$H$_8$, has been\nsynthesized. In this salt, a part of Mn$^{2+}$ ions are replaced by Co$^{2+}$\nwhich acts as a magnetic dopant with a different effective magnetic moment.\nCrystal structure, band structure, conducting and magnetic properties of the\nsalt have been studied. Below 30 K the material undergoes a metal-insulator\ntransition, which is suppressed by applying a pressure of ~0.5kbar, leading to\na superconducting ground state. While the structural and conducting properties\nare very similar to those of the parent salt\n$\\kappa$-(BETS)$_2$Mn[N(CN)$_2$]$_3$, magnetic properties associated with\nlocalized moments in the anion layer are found to be surprisingly different.\n", "  We assess the photometric variability of nine stars with spectroscopic Teff\nand log(g) values from the ELM Survey that locate them near the empirical\nextremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf instability strip. We discover three new\npulsating stars: SDSS J135512.34+195645.4, SDSS J173521.69+213440.6 and SDSS\nJ213907.42+222708.9. However, these are among the few ELM Survey objects that\ndo not show radial velocity variations to confirm the binary nature expected of\nhelium-core white dwarfs. The dominant 4.31-hr pulsation in SDSS\nJ135512.34+195645.4 far exceeds the theoretical cutoff for surface reflection\nin a white dwarf, and this target is likely a high-amplitude delta Scuti\npulsator with an overestimated surface gravity. We estimate the probability to\nbe less than 0.0008 that the lack of measured radial velocity variations in\nfour of eight other pulsating candidate ELM white dwarfs could be due to low\norbital inclination. Two other targets exhibit variability as photometric\nbinaries. Partial coverage of the 19.342-hr orbit of WD J030818.19+514011.5\nreveals deep eclipses that imply a primary radius > 0.4 solar radii--too large\nto be consistent with an ELM white dwarf. The only object for which our time\nseries photometry adds support to the ELM white dwarf classification is SDSS\nJ105435.78-212155.9, with consistent signatures of Doppler beaming and\nellipsoidal variations. We interpret that the ELM Survey contains multiple\nfalse positives from another stellar population at Teff < 9000 K, possibly\nrelated to the sdA stars recently reported from SDSS spectra.\n", "  Solar flares are powerful radiations occuring in the Sun's atmosphere. They\nare powered by magnetic reconnection, a phemonenon that can convert magnetic\nenergy into other forms of energy such as heat and kinetic energy, and it is\nbelieved to be ubiquitous in the universe. With the ever increasing spatial and\ntemporal resolutions of solar observations, as well as numerical simulations\nbenefiting from increasing computer power, we can now probe into the nature and\nthe characteristics of magnetic reconnection in 3D to better understand its\nconsequences during eruptive flares in our star's atmosphere. We review in the\nfollowing the efforts made on different fronts to approach the problem of\nmagnetic reconnection. In particular, we will see how understanding the\nmagnetic topology in 3D helps locating the most probable regions for\nreconnection to occur, how the current layer evolves in 3D and how reconnection\nleads to the formation of flux ropes, plasmoids and flaring loops.\n", "  We investigate a sample of 2293 ICRF2 extragalactic radio-loud sources with\naccurate positions determined by VLBI, mostly active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasars, which are cross-matched with optical sources in the first Gaia release\n(Gaia DR1). The distribution of offsets between the VLBI sources and their\noptical counterparts is strongly non-Gaussian, with powerful wings extending\nbeyond 1 arcsecond. Limiting our analysis to only high-confidence difference\ndetections, we find (and publish) a list of 188 objects with normalized\nvariances above 12 and offsets below 1 arcsecond. Pan-STARRS stacked and\nmonochromatic images resolve some of these sources indicating the presence of\ndouble sources, confusion sources, or pronounced extended structures. Some 89\nhigh-quality objects, however, do not show any perturbations and appear to be\nstar-like single sources, yet displaced by multiples of the expected error from\nthe radio-loud AGN. We conclude that a fraction of luminous AGN (more than 4%)\ncan be physically dislodged from the optical centers of their parent galaxies.\n", "  The torque-free motion of rigid body in gravitational field is analyzed. The\ncoin lands on a soft surface (such as the palm of the hand) that allows no\nbouncing. The model assumes the coin as a rigid body with constant angular\nmomentum vector in the body frame, and no air resistance. Unbiased\nprobabilities of heads and tails are obtained for various initial conditions\naccessible to a usual person.\n", "  Broad (~10,000 km/s), double-peaked emission-line profiles of Balmer lines\nemitted by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to originate in the outer\nparts of an accretion disk surrounding a nuclear supermassive black hole\n(SMBH), at R~1000 gravitational radii and are most frequently observed in the\nnuclear spectra of low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and radio-galaxies. In the\npresent paper we argue that broad double-peaked profiles are present also in\nthe spectra of other Type 1 AGN, such as Seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting that\nthe inner part of the broad-line region (BLR) is also the outer part of the\naccretion disk. We use the Palomar spectral survey of nearby galaxies to show\nthat the only difference between Seyfert 1 BLR line profiles and \"bona fide\"\ndouble peakers is that, in most cases, besides a disk component, we need an\nadditional Gaussian component attributed to non-disk clouds. The recognition\nthat the inner and most variable part of the BLR has a disk geometry suggests\nthat the factor 'f ' in the expression to obtain the SMBH mass (M) in Type 1\nAGN M(SMBH)=f [R(BLR) (Delta V)^2]/G is f = 1/[sin^2(i)] for the disk dominated\nsources. Our median inclination i=27 degrees implies f=4.5, very close to the\nmost recent value of f=4.3+/-1.05, obtained from independent studies. We derive\na relation between f and the FWHM of the broad profile that may help to reduce\nthe uncertainties in the SMBH mass determinations of AGN.\n", "  Recently developed circularly polarized X-ray light sources can probe\nultrafast chiral electronic and nuclear dynamics through spatially localized\nresonant core transitions. We present simulations of time-resolved circular\ndichroism (TRCD) signals given by the difference of left and right circularly\npolarized X-ray probe transmission following an excitation by a circularly\npolarized optical pump with variable time delay. Application is made to\nformamide which is achiral in the ground state and assumes two chiral\ngeometries upon optical excitation to the first valence excited state. Probes\nresonant with various K-edges (C, N and O) provide different local windows onto\nthe parity breaking geometry change thus revealing enantiomer asymmetry.\n", "  We present high-resolution (1\".0) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) observations of CO (1-0) and CO (2- 1) rotational transitions\ntoward the nearby IR-luminous merger NGC 1614 supplemented with ALMA archival\ndata of CO (3-2), and CO (6-5) transitions. The CO (6-5) emission arises from\nthe starburst ring (central 590 pc in radius), while the lower-$J$ CO lines are\ndistributed over the outer disk ($\\sim$ 3.3 kpc in radius). Radiative transfer\nand photon dominated region (PDR) modeling reveal that the starburst ring has a\nsingle warmer gas component with more intense far-ultraviolet radiation field\n($n_{\\rm{H_2}}$ $\\sim$ 10$^{4.6}$ cm$^{-3}$, $T_{\\rm{kin}}$ $\\sim$ 42 K, and\n$G_{\\rm{0}}$ $\\sim$ 10$^{2.7}$) relative to the outer disk ($n_{\\rm{H_2}}$\n$\\sim$ 10$^{5.1}$ cm$^{-3}$, $T_{\\rm{kin}}$ $\\sim$ 22 K, and $G_{\\rm{0}}$\n$\\sim$ 10$^{0.9}$). A two-phase molecular interstellar medium with a warm and\ncold ($>$ 70 K and $\\sim$ 19 K) component is also an applicable model for the\nstarburst ring. A possible source for heating the warm gas component is\nmechanical heating due to stellar feedback rather than PDR. Furthermore, we\nfind evidence for non-circular motions along the north-south optical bar in the\nlower-$J$ CO images, suggesting a cold gas inflow. We suggest that star\nformation in the starburst ring is sustained by the bar-driven cold gas inflow,\nand starburst activities radiatively and mechanically power the CO excitation.\nThe absence of a bright active galactic nucleus can be explained by a scenario\nthat cold gas accumulating on the starburst ring is exhausted as the fuel for\nstar formation, or is launched as an outflow before being able to feed to the\nnucleus.\n", "  We investigate the angular momentum evolution of four disk galaxies residing\nin Milky Way-sized halos formed in cosmological zoom-in simulations with\nvarious sub-grid physics and merging histories. We decompose these galaxies\nkinematically and photometrically, into their disk and bulge components. The\nsimulated galaxies and their components lie on the observed sequences in the\n$j_*$--$M_*$ diagram relating the specific angular momentum and mass of the\nstellar component. We find that galaxies in low-density environments follow the\nrelation $j_* \\propto M_*^{\\alpha}$ past major mergers, with $\\alpha \\sim 0.6$\nin the case of strong feedback, when bulge-to-disk ratios are relatively\nconstant, and $\\alpha \\sim 1.4$ in the other cases, when secular processes\noperate on shorter timescales. We compute the retention factors (i.e. the ratio\nof the specific angular momenta of stars and dark matter) for both disks and\nbulges and show that they vary relatively slowly after averaging over numerous\nbut brief fluctuations. For disks, the retention factors are usually close to\nunity, while for bulges, they are a few times smaller. Our simulations\ntherefore indicate that galaxies and their halos grow in a quasi-homologous\nway.\n", "  Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is one of the payloads onboard AstroSat,\nIndia's first multi-wavelength Astronomy mission. UVIT is primarily designed to\nmake high resolution images in wide field, in three wavelength channels\nsimultaneously: FUV (130 - 180 nm), NUV (200 - 300 nm) and VIS (320 - 550 nm).\nThe intensified imagers used in UVIT suffer from distortions, and a correction\nis necessary for these to achieve good astrometry. In this article we describe\nthe methodology and calculations used to estimate the distortions in ground\ncalibrations.\n", "  We report the broadband X-ray spectra of the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy\n(ULIRG) UGC 5101 in the 0.25-100 keV band observed with Swift/Burst Alert\nTelescope (BAT), NuSTAR, Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and Chandra. A Compton-thick AGN\nobscured with a hydrogen column density of $\\approx 1.3\\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$\nis detected above 10 keV. A spectral fit with a numerical torus model favors a\nlarge half opening angle of the torus, $>41$ degrees, suggesting that the\ncovering fraction of material heavily obscuring the X-ray source is moderate.\nThe intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity is determined to be $\\approx 1.4\\times\n10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is $\\approx$2.5 times larger than the previous\nestimate using only data below 10 keV with a simple spectral model. We find\nthat UGC 5101 shows the ratio between the [O IV] 26 $\\mu$m line and 2-10 keV\nluminosities similar to those of normal Seyfert galaxies, along with other\nULIRGs observed with NuSTAR, indicating that a significant portion of local\nULIRGs are not really \"X-ray faint\" with respect to the flux of forbidden lines\noriginating from the narrow line region (NLR). We propose a possible scenario\nthat (1) the AGN in UGC 5101 is surrounded not only by Compton-thick matter\nlocated close to the equatorial plane but also by Compton-thin ($N_\\mathrm{H}\n\\sim 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) matter in the torus-hole region and (2) it is\naccreting at a high Eddington rate with a steep UV to X-ray spectral energy\ndistribution. Nevertheless, we argue that AGNs in many ULIRGs do not look\nextraordinary (i.e., extremely X-ray faint), as suggested by recent works,\ncompared with normal Seyferts.\n", "  The gamma-ray blazar OJ 287 was in a high activity state during December 2015\n- February 2016. Coinciding with this high brightness state, we observed this\nsource for photometry on 40 nights in R-band and for polarimetry on 9 epochs in\nUBVRI bands. During the period of our observations, the source brightness\nvaried between $13.20 \\pm 0.04$ to $14.98 \\pm 0.04$ mag and the degree of\npolarization (P ) fluctuated between $6.0 \\pm 0.3$% and $28.3 \\pm 0.8$% in\nR-band. Focusing on intra-night optical variability (INOV), we find a duty\ncycle of about 71% using $\\chi^2$-statistics, similar to that known for\nblazars. From INOV data, the shortest variability time scale is estimated to be\n$142 \\pm 38$ min yielding a lower limit of the observed Doppler factor\n$\\delta_0 = 1.17$, the magnetic field strength $B \\le 3.8$ G and the size of\nthe emitting region Rs < $2.28 \\times 10^{14}$ cm. On inter-night timescales, a\nsignificant anti-correlation between R-band flux and P is found. The observed P\nat U-band is generally larger than that observed at longer wavelength bands\nsuggesting a wavelength dependent polarization. Using V -band photometric and\npolarimetric data from Steward Observatory obtained during our monitoring\nperiod we find a varied correlation between P and V-band brightness. While an\nanticorrelation is seen between P and V -band mag at sometimes, no correlation\nis seen at other times, thereby, suggesting the presence of more than one\nshort-lived shock components in the jet of OJ 287.\n", "  We analyze the gravitational instability (GI) of a locally isothermal\ninclined disk around one component of a binary system. Such a disk can undergo\nglobal Kozai-Lidov (KL) cycles if the initial disk tilt is above the critical\nKL angle (of about 40 degrees). During these cycles, an initially circular disk\nexchanges its inclination for eccentricity, and vice versa. Self-gravity may\nsuppress the cycles under some circumstances. However, with hydrodynamic\nsimulations including self-gravity we show that for a sufficiently high initial\ndisk tilts and for certain disk masses, disks can undergo KL oscillations and\nfragment due to GI, even when the Toomre Q value for an equivalent undisturbed\ndisk is well within the stable regime (Q > 2). We suggest that KL triggered\ndisk fragmentation provides a mechanism for the efficient formation of giant\nplanets in binary systems and may enhance fragmentation of disks in massive\nblack hole binaries.\n", "  This paper presents an in depth look at the jet and coronal properties of 41\nAGN. Utilizing the highest quality NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and NVSS 1.4 GHz data,\nwe find that the radio Eddington luminosity inversely scales with X-ray\nreflection fraction, and positively scales with the distance between the corona\nand the reflected regions in the disk. We next investigate a model that\npredicts the corona is outflowing and propagates into the large scale jet. We\nfind this model describes the data well and predicts the corona has mildly\nrelativistic velocities, 0.04<\\beta<0.40. We discuss our results in the context\nof disk-jet connections in AGN\n", "  We present the detection of non-radial oscillations in a hot,\nhelium-atmosphere white dwarf using 78.7 d of nearly uninterrupted photometry\nfrom the Kepler space telescope. With an effective temperature >30,000 K, PG\n0112+104 becomes the hottest helium-atmosphere white dwarf known to pulsate.\nThe rich oscillation spectrum of low-order g-modes includes clear patterns of\nrotational splittings from consecutive sequences of dipole and quadrupole\nmodes, which can be used to probe the rotation rate with depth in this highly\nevolved stellar remnant. We also measure a surface rotation rate of 10.17404 hr\nfrom an apparent spot modulation in the K2 data. With two independent measures\nof rotation, PG 0112+104 provides a remarkable test of asteroseismic inference.\n", "  We compare two Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples that are drawn from a\nspectroscopically confirmed SN Ia sample: a host-selected sample in which SNe\nIa are restricted to those that have a spectroscopic redshift from the host;\nand a broader, more traditional sample in which the redshift could come from\neither the SN or the host. The host-selected sample is representative of SN\nsamples that will use the redshift of the host to infer the SN redshift, long\nafter the SN has faded from view. We find that SNe Ia that are selected on the\navailability of a redshift from the host differ from SNe Ia that are from the\nbroader sample. The former tend to be redder, have narrower light curves, live\nin more massive hosts, and tend to be at lower redshifts. We find that\nconstraints on the equation of state of dark energy, $w$, and the matter\ndensity, $\\Omega_M$, remain consistent between these two types of samples. Our\nresults are important for ongoing and future supernova surveys, which unlike\nprevious supernova surveys, will have limited real-time follow-up to\nspectroscopically classify the SNe they discover. Most of the redshifts in\nthese surveys will come from the hosts.\n", "  We present optical spectrophotometric and near-infrared (NIR) photometric\nobservations of the nova V2676 Oph covering the period from 2012 March 29\nthrough 2015 May 8. The optical spectra and photometry of the nova have been\ntaken from SMARTS and Asiago; the near-infrared photometry was obtained from\nSMARTS and Mt. Abu. The spectra are dominated by strong H I lines from the\nBalmer series, Fe II, N I and [O I] lines in the initial days, typical of an Fe\nII type nova. The measured FWHM for the H-beta and H-alpha lines was 800-1200\nkm/s. There was pronounced dust formation starting 90 days after the outburst.\nThe J - K color was the largest among recent dust forming novae.\n", "  We revise the evolutionary status of the B-type supergiant HD\\,163899 based\non the new determinations of the mass-luminosity ratio, effective temperature\nand rotational velocity as well as on the interpretation of the oscillation\nspectrum of the star. The observed value of the nitrogen-to-carbon abundance\nfixes the value of the rotation rate of the star. Now, more massive models are\nstrongly preferred than those previously considered and it is very likely that\nthe star is still in the main sequence stage. The rotationally induced mixing\nmanifests as the nitrogen overabundance in the atmosphere, which agrees with\nour analysis of the HARPS spectra. Thus, HD\\,163899 belongs probably to a group\nof evolved nitrogen-rich main-sequence stars.\n", "  Quasi-simultaneous observations of the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar PKS\n2326-502 were carried out in the gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical, near-infrared,\nand radio bands. Thanks to these observations we are able to characterize the\nspectral energy distribution of the source during two flaring and one quiescent\ngamma-ray states. These data were used to constrain one-zone leptonic models of\nthe spectral energy distributions of each flare and investigate the physical\nconditions giving rise to them. While modeling one flare only required changes\nto the electron spectrum, the other flare needed changes in both the electron\nspectrum and the size of the emitting region with respect to the quiescent\nstate. These results are consistent with an emerging pattern of two broad\nclasses of flaring states seen in blazars.\n", "  We report new HST COS and STIS spectroscopy of a star-forming region (~100\nsolar masses/year) in the center of the X-ray cluster RXJ1532.9+3021 (z=0.362),\nto follow-up the CLASH team discovery of luminous UV filaments and knots in the\ncentral massive galaxy. We detect broad (~500 km/s) Lyman alpha emission lines\nwith extraordinarily high equivalent width (EQW~200 Angstroms) and somewhat\nless broadened H-alpha (~220 km/s). Emission lines of N V and O VI are not\ndetected, which constrains the rate at which gas cools through temperatures of\n10^6 K to be less than about 10 solar masses/year. The COS spectra also show a\nflat rest-frame UV continuum with weak stellar photospheric features,\nconsistent with the presence of recently-formed hot stars forming at a rate of\n~10 solar masses/year, uncorrected for dust extinction. The slope and\nabsorption lines in these UV spectra are similar to those of Lyman Break\nGalaxies at z approximately 3, albeit those with the highest Lyman-alpha\nequivalent widths and star-formation rates. This high-EQW Lyman-alpha source is\na high-metallicity galaxy rapidly forming stars in structures that look nothing\nlike disks. This mode of star formation could significantly contribute to the\nspheroidal population of galaxies. The constraint on the luminosity of any O VI\nline emission is stringent enough to rule out steady and simultaneous gas\ncooling and star formation, unlike similar systems in the Phoenix Cluster and\nAbell 1795. The fact that the current star formation rate differs from the\nlocal mass cooling rate is consistent with recent simulations of episodic AGN\nfeedback and star formation in a cluster atmosphere.\n", "  We report the development of a parallel FORTRAN code, RCCPAC, to solve the\nrelativistic coupled-cluster equations for closed-shell and one-valence atoms\nand ions. The parallelization is implemented through the use of message passing\ninterface, which is suitable for distributed memory computers. The\ncoupled-cluster equations are defined in terms of the reduced matrix elements,\nand solved iteratively using Jacobi method. The ground and excited states\ncoupled-cluster wave functions obtained from the code could be used to compute\ndifferent properties of closed-shell and one-valence atom or ion. As an example\nwe compute the ground state correlation energy, attachment energies, $E$1\nreduced matrix elements and hyperfine structure constants.\n", "  We searched in the public archive of the Chandra X-ray Observatory as of\nMarch 2016 and assembled a sample of 719 galaxies within 50 Mpc with ACIS\nobservations available. By cross-correlation with the optical or near-infrared\nnuclei of these galaxies, 314 of them are identified to have an X-ray active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). The majority of them are low-luminosity AGNs and are\nunlikely X-ray binaries based upon their spatial distribution and luminosity\nfunctions. The AGN fraction is around 60% for elliptical galaxies and\nearly-type spirals, but drops to roughly 20% for Sc and later types, consistent\nwith previous findings in the optical. However, the X-ray survey is more\npowerful in finding weak AGNs, especially from regions with active star\nformation that may mask the optical AGN signature. For example, 31% of the H II\nnuclei are found to harbor an X-ray AGN. For most objects, a single power-law\nmodel subject to interstellar absorption is adequate to fit the spectrum, and\nthe typical photon index is found to be around 1.8. For galaxies with a\nnon-detection, their stacked Chandra image shows an X-ray excess with a\nluminosity of a few times 10^37 erg/s on average around the nuclear region,\npossibly composed of faint X-ray binaries. This paper reports on the technique\nand results of the survey; in-depth analysis and discussion of the results will\nbe reported in forthcoming papers.\n", "  We present a theory of the isotope effect of the Curie temperature $T_{\\rm\nc}$ in itinerant ferromagnets. The isotope effect in ferromagnets occurs via\nthe electron-phonon vertex correction and the effective attractive interaction\nmediated by the electron-phonon interaction. The decrease of the Debye\nfrequency increases the relative strength of the Coulomb interaction, which\nresults in a positive isotope shift of $T_{\\rm c}$ when the mass $M$ of an atom\nincreases. Following this picture, we evaluate the isotope effect of $T_{\\rm\nc}$ by using the Stoner theory and a spin-fluctuation theory. When $T_{\\rm c}$\nis large enough as large as or more than 100K, the isotope effect on $T_{\\rm\nc}$ can be measurable. Recently, precise measurements on the oxygen isotope\neffect on $T_{\\rm c}$ have been performed for itinerant ferromagnet SrRuO$_3$\nwith $T_{\\rm c}\\sim 160$K. A clear isotope effect has been observed with the\npositive shift of $T_{\\rm c}\\sim 1$K by isotope substitution\n($^{16}O\\rightarrow ^{18}O$). This experimental result is consistent with our\ntheory.\n", "  We report the first analysis of data from AstroSat/LAXPC observations of\nCygnus X-1 in January 2016. LAXPC spectra reveals that the source was in the\ncanonical hard state, represented by a prominent thermal Comptonization\ncomponent having a photon index of 1.8 and high temperature kT of electron > 60\nkeV along with weak reflection and possible disk emission. The power spectrum\ncan be characterized by two broad lorentzian functions centered at 0.4 and 3\nHz. The r.m.s of the low frequency component decreases from 15% at around 4 keV\nto 10% at around 50 keV, while that of the high frequency one varies less\nrapidly from 13.5% to 11.5% in the same energy range. The time lag between the\nhard (20 to 40 keV) and soft (5 to 10 keV) bands varies in a step-like manner\nbeing nearly constant at 50 Milli-seconds from 0.3 to 0.9 Hz, decreasing to 8\nMilli-seconds from 2 to 5 Hz and finally dropping to 2 Milli-seconds for higher\nfrequencies. The time lags increase with energy for both the low and high\nfrequency components. The event mode LAXPC data allows for flux resolved\nspectral analysis on a time-scale of 1 second, which clearly shows that the\nphoton index increased from 1.72 to 1.80 as the flux increased by nearly a\nfactor of two. We discuss the results in the framework of the fluctuation\npropagation model.\n", "  We present an investigation of the globular cluster population synthesis\nmethod of McWilliam & Bernstein (2008), focusing on the impact of NLTE modeling\neffects and CMD discretization. Johnson-Cousins-Bessel U-B, B-V, V-I, and J-K\ncolors are produced for 96 synthetic integrated light spectra with two\ndifferent discretization prescriptions and three degrees of NLTE treatment.\nThese color values are used to compare NLTE and LTE derived population ages.\nRelative contributions of different spectral types to the integrated light\nspectra for different wavebands are measured. Integrated light NLTE spectra are\nshown to be more luminous in the UV and optical than LTE spectra, but show\nstronger absorption features in the IR. The main features showing discrepancies\nbetween NLTE and LTE integrated light spectra may be attributed to light\nmetals, primarily Fe I, Ca I, and Ti I, as well as TiO molecular bands. Main\nSequence stars are shown to have negligible NLTE effects at IR wavelengths\ncompared to more evolved stars. Photometric color values are shown to vary at\nthe millimagnitude level as a function of CMD discretization. Finer CMD\nsampling for the upper main sequence and turnoff, base of the red giant branch,\nand the horizontal branch minimizes this variation. Differences in ages derived\nfrom LTE and NLTE IL spectra are found to range from 0.55 to 2.54 Gyr,\ncomparable to the uncertainty in GC ages derived from color indices with\nobservational uncertainties of 0.01 magnitudes, the limiting precision of the\nHarris catalog (Harris 1996).\n", "  High spectral resolution mid-IR observations of ethylene (C2H4) towards the\nAGB star IRC+10216 were obtained using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle\nSpectrograph (TEXES) at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Eighty\nro-vibrational lines from the 10.5 um vibrational mode nu7 with J<30 were\ndetected in absorption. The observed lines are divided into two groups with\nrotational temperatures of 105 and 400 K (warm and hot lines). The warm lines\npeak at ~-14 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity, suggesting that they\nare mostly formed outwards from ~20R*. The hot lines are centered at -10 km/s\nindicating that they come from a shell between 10 and 20R*. 35% of the observed\nlines are unblended and can be fitted with a code developed to model the\nemission of a spherically symmetric circumstellar envelope. The analysis of\nseveral scenarios reveal that the C2H4 abundance relative to H2 in the range\n5-20R* is 6.9E-8 in average and it could be as high as 1.1E-7. Beyond 20R*, it\nis 8.2E-8. The total column density is 6.5(3.0)E15 cm^-2. C2H4 is found to be\nrotationally under local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) and vibrationally\nout of LTE. One of the scenarios that best reproduce the observations suggests\nthat up to 25% of the C2H4 molecules at 20R* could condense onto dust grains.\nThis possible depletion would not influence significantly the gas acceleration\nalthough it could play a role in the surface chemistry on the dust grains.\n", "  A critical component of exoplanetary studies is an exhaustive\ncharacterization of the host star, from which the planetary properties are\nfrequently derived. Of particular value are the radius, temperature, and\nluminosity, which are key stellar parameters for studies of transit and\nhabitability science. Here we present the results of new observations of\nWolf~1061, known to host three super-Earths. Our observations from the Center\nfor High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) interferometric array provide a\ndirect stellar radius measurement of $0.3207 \\pm 0.0088$~$R_{\\odot}$, from\nwhich we calculate the effective temperature and luminosity using spectral\nenergy distribution models. We obtained seven years of precise, automated\nphotometry that reveals the correct stellar rotation period of\n$89.3\\pm1.8$~days, finds no evidence of photometric transits, and confirms the\nradial velocity signals are not due to stellar activity. Finally, our stellar\nproperties are used to calculate the extent of the Habitable Zone for the\nWolf~1061 system, for which the optimistic boundaries are 0.09--0.23~AU. Our\nsimulations of the planetary orbital dynamics shows that the eccentricity of\nthe Habitable Zone planet oscillates to values as high as $\\sim$0.15 as it\nexchanges angular momentum with the other planets in the system.\n", "  We present a detailed study of an earth-directed coronal mass ejection (Full\nhalo CME) event happened on 2011 February 15 making use of white light\nobservations by three coronagraphs and radio observations by Wind/WAVES. We\napplied three different methods to reconstruct the propagation direction and\ntraveling distance of the CME and its driven shock. We measured the kinematics\nof the CME leading edge from white light images observed by STEREO A and B,\ntracked the CME-driven shock using the frequency drift observed by Wind/WAVES\ntogether with an interplanetary density model, and obtained the equivalent\nscattering centers of the CME by Polarization Ratio(PR) method. For the first\ntime, we applied PR method to different features distinguished from LASCO/C2\npolarimetric observations and calculated their projections onto white light\nimages observed by STEREO A and B. By combining the graduated cylindrical shell\n(GCS) forward modeling with the PR method, we proposed a new GCS-PR method to\nderive 3D parameters of a CME observed from a single perspective at Earth.\nComparisons between different methods show a good degree of consistence in the\nderived 3D results.\n", "  We report the ${\\it Kepler}$ photometry of KIC 11401845 displaying\nmultiperiodic pulsations, superimposed on binary effects. Light-curve synthesis\nrepresents that the binary star is a short-period detached system with a very\nlow mass ratio of $q$ = 0.070 and filling factors of $F_1$ = 45 % and $F_2$ =\n99 %. Multiple frequency analyses were applied to the light residuals after\nsubtracting the synthetic eclipsing curve from the observed data. We detected\n23 frequencies with signal to noise amplitude ratios larger than 4.0, of which\nthe orbital harmonics ($f_4$, $f_6$, $f_9$, $f_{15}$) in the low frequency\ndomain may originate from tidally excited modes. For the high frequencies of\n13.7$-$23.8 day$^{-1}$, the period ratios and pulsation constants are in the\nranges of $P_{\\rm pul}/P_{\\rm orb}$ = 0.020$-$0.034 and $Q$ = 0.018$-$0.031 d,\nrespectively. These values and the position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\ndemonstrate that the primary component is a $\\delta$ Sct pulsating star. We\nexamined the eclipse timing variation of KIC 11401845 from the\npulsation-subtracted data and found a delay of 56$\\pm$17 s in the arrival times\nof the secondary eclipses relative to the primary eclipses. A possible\nexplanation of the time shift may be some combination of a light-travel-time\ndelay of about 34 s and a very small eccentricity of $e \\cos {\\omega} <$\n0.0002. This result represents the first measurement of the R{\\o}mer delay in\nnon-compact binaries.\n", "  Solar flares are one of the most energetic events in the solar atmosphere. It\nis widely accepted that flares are powered by magnetic reconnection in the\ncorona. An eruptive flare is usually accompanied by a coronal mass ejection,\nboth of which are probably driven by the eruption of a magnetic flux rope\n(MFR). Here we report an eruptive flare on 2016 March 23 observed by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The\nextreme-ultraviolet imaging observations exhibit the clear rise and eruption of\nan MFR. In particular, the observations reveal solid evidence for magnetic\nreconnection from both the corona and chromosphere during the flare. Moreover,\nweak reconnection is observed before the start of the flare. We find that the\npreflare weak reconnection is of tether-cutting type and helps the MFR to rise\nslowly. Induced by a further rise of the MFR, strong reconnection occurs in the\nrise phases of the flare, which is temporally related to the MFR eruption. We\nalso find that the magnetic reconnection is more of 3D-type in the early phase,\nas manifested in a strong-to-weak shear transition in flare loops, and becomes\nmore 2D-like in the later phase, as shown by the apparent rising motion of an\narcade of flare loops.\n", "  A distinct set of broad emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and\n12.7 $\\mu$m, is often detected in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). These features\nare commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We model\nthese emission features in the infrared spectra of 69 PPDs around 14 T Tauri\nand 55 Herbig Ae/Be stars in terms of astronomical-PAHs. For each PPD, we\nderive the size distribution and the charge state of PAHs. We then examine the\ncorrelations of the PAH properties (i.e., sizes and ionization fractions) with\nthe stellar properties (e.g., stellar effective temperature, luminosity, and\nmass). We find that the characteristic size of PAHs shows a tendency of\ncorrelating with the stellar effective temperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$) and\ninterpret this as the preferential photodissociation of small PAHs in systems\nwith higher $T_{\\rm eff}$ of which the stellar photons are more energetic. In\naddition, the PAH size shows a moderate correlation with the red-ward\nwavelength-shift of the 7.7 $\\mu$m PAH feature that is commonly observed in\ndisks around cool stars. The ionization fraction of PAHs does not seem to\ncorrelate with any stellar parameters. This is because the charging of PAHs\ndepends on not only the stellar properties (e.g., $T_{\\rm eff}$, luminosity)\nbut also the spatial distribution of PAHs in the disks. The mere negative\ncorrelation between the PAH size and the stellar age suggests that continuous\nreplenishment of PAHs via the outgassing of cometary bodies and/or the\ncollisional grinding of planetesimals and asteroids is required to maintain the\nabundance of small PAHs against complete destruction by photodissociation.\n", "  The transport of the energy contained in suprathermal electrons in solar\nflares plays a key role in our understanding of many aspects of flare physics,\nfrom the spatial distributions of hard X-ray emission and energy deposition in\nthe ambient atmosphere to global energetics. Historically the transport of\nthese particles has been largely treated through a deterministic approach, in\nwhich first-order secular energy loss to electrons in the ambient target is\ntreated as the dominant effect, with second-order diffusive terms (in both\nenergy and angle) being generally either treated as a small correction or even\nneglected. We here critically analyze this approach, and we show that spatial\ndiffusion through pitch-angle scattering necessarily plays a very significant\nrole in the transport of electrons. We further show that a satisfactory\ntreatment of the diffusion process requires consideration of non-local effects,\nso that the electron flux depends not just on the local gradient of the\nelectron distribution function but on the value of this gradient within an\nextended region encompassing a significant fraction of a mean free path. Our\nanalysis applies generally to pitch-angle scattering by a variety of\nmechanisms, from Coulomb collisions to turbulent scattering. We further show\nthat the spatial transport of electrons along the magnetic field of a flaring\nloop can be modeled rather effectively as a Continuous Time Random Walk with\nvelocity-dependent probability distribution functions of jump sizes and\noccurrences, both of which can be expressed in terms of the scattering mean\nfree path.\n", "  We observed a nearby millisecond pulsar J2124-3358 with the Hubble Space\nTelescope in broad far-UV (FUV) and optical filters. The pulsar is detected in\nboth bands with fluxes F(1250-2000 A)= (2.5+/-0.3)x10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 and\nF(3800-6000 A)=(6.4+/-0.4)x10^-17 erg/s/cm^2, which correspond to luminosities\nof ~5.8x10^27 and 1.4x10^27 erg/s, for d=410 pc and E(B-V)=0.03. The\noptical-FUV spectrum can be described by a power-law model, f_nu~nu^alpha, with\nslope alpha=0.18-0.48 for a conservative range of color excess,\nE(B-V)=0.01-0.08. Since a spectral flux rising with frequency is unusual for\npulsar magnetospheric emission in this frequency range, it is possible that the\nspectrum is predominantly magnetospheric (power law with alpha<0) in the\noptical while it is dominated by thermal emission from the neutron star surface\nin the FUV. For a neutron star radius of 12 km, the surface temperature would\nbe between 0.5x10^5 and 2.1x10^5 K, for alpha ranging from -1 to 0,\nE(B-V)=0.01-0.08, and d=340-500 pc. In addition to the pulsar, the FUV images\nreveal extended emission spatially coincident with the known Halpha bow shock,\nmaking PSR J2124-3358 the second pulsar (after PSR J0437-4715) with a bow shock\ndetected in FUV.\n", "  A simple, model-independent method to quantify the stochastic variability of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) is the structure function (SF) analysis. If the\nSF for the timescales shorter than the decorrelation timescale $\\tau$ is a\nsingle power-law and for the longer ones becomes flat (i.e., the white noise),\nthe auto-correlation function (ACF) of the signal can have the form of the\npower exponential (PE). We show that the signal decorrelation timescale can be\nmeasured directly from the SF as the timescale matching the amplitude 0.795 of\nthe flat SF part (at long timescales), and only then the measurement is\nindependent of the ACF PE power. Typically, the timescale has been measured at\nan arbitrarily fixed SF amplitude, but as we prove, this approach provides\nbiased results because the AGN SF/PSD slopes, so the ACF shape, are not\nconstant and depend on either the AGN luminosity and/or the black hole mass. In\nparticular, we show that using such a method for the simulated SFs that include\na combination of empirically known dependencies between the AGN luminosity $L$\nand both the SF amplitude and the PE power, and having no intrinsic $\\tau-L$\ndependence, produces a fake $\\tau \\propto L^\\kappa$ relation with $0.3\\lesssim\n\\kappa \\lesssim 0.6$, that otherwise is expected from theoretical works\n($\\kappa \\equiv 0.5$). Our method provides an alternative means for analyzing\nAGN variability to the standard SF fitting. The caveats, for both methods, are\nthat the light curves must be sufficiently long (several years rest-frame) and\nthe ensemble SF assumes AGNs to have the same underlying variability process.\n", "  In ungauged supergravity theories, the no-force condition for BPS states\nimplies the existence of stable static multi-centered solutions. The first\nsolutions to Einstein-Maxwell theory with a positive cosmological constant\ndescribing an arbitrary number of charged black holes were found by Kastor and\nTraschen. Generalisations to five and higher dimensional theories were obtained\nby London. Multi-centered solutions in gauged supergravity, even with\ntime-dependence allowed, have yet to be constructed. In this letter we\nconstruct supersymmetry-preserving multi-centered solutions for the case of\nD=5, N=2 Euclidean gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector\nmultiplets. Higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell multi-centered solutions are\nalso presented.\n", "  A trapped magnetic field of greater than 3 T has been achieved in a single\ngrain GdBa2Cu3O7-{\\delta} (GdBaCuO) bulk superconductor of diameter 30 mm by\nemploying pulsed field magnetisation (PFM). The magnet system is portable and\noperates at temperatures between 50 K and 60 K. Flux jump behaviour was\nobserved consistently during magnetisation when the applied pulsed field, Ba,\nexceeded a critical value (e.g. 3.78 T at 60 K). A sharp dBa/dt is essential to\nthis phenomenon. This flux jump behaviour enables the magnetic flux to\npenetrate fully to the centre of the bulk superconductor, resulting in full\nmagnetization of the sample without requiring an applied field as large as that\npredicted by the Bean model. We show that this flux jump behaviour can occur\nover a wide range of fields and temperatures, and that it can be exploited in a\npractical quasi-permanent magnet system.\n", "  For topological sigma models, we propose that their local Lagragian density\nis allowed to depend non-linearly on the de Rham's \"velocities\" $D Z^{A}$.\nThen, by differentiating the Lagrangian density with respect to the latter de\nRham's \"velocities\", we define a \"dynamical\" anti-symplectic potential, in\nterms of which a \"dynamical\" anti-symplectic metric is defined, as well. We\ndefine the local and the functional antibracket via the dynamical\nanti-symplectic metric. Finally, we show that the generalized action of the\nsigma model satisfies the functional master equation, as required.\n", "  Chemical abundances of eight O- and B-type stars are determined from\nhigh-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE instrument on the Magellan 6.5m\nClay telescope. The sample is selected from 42 candidates of membership in the\nLeading Arm of the Magellanic System. Stellar parameters are measured by two\nindependent grids of model atmospheres and analysis procedures, confirming the\nconsistency of the stellar parameter results. Abundances of seven elements (He,\nC, N, O, Mg, Si, and S) are determined for the stars, as are their radial\nvelocities and estimates of distances and ages.\n  Among the seven B-type stars analyzed, the five that have radial velocities\ncompatible with membership to the LA have an average [Mg/H] of $-0.42\\pm0.16$,\nsignificantly lower than the average of the remaining two [Mg/H] =\n$-0.07\\pm0.06$ that are kinematical members of the Galactic disk. Among the\nfive LA members, four have individual [Mg/H] abundance compatible with that in\nthe LMC. Within errors, we can not exclude the possibility that one of these\nstars has a [Mg/H] consistent with the more metal-poor, SMC-like material. The\nremaining fifth star has a [Mg/H] close to MW values. Distances to the LA\nmembers indicate that they are at the edge of the Galactic disk, while ages are\nof the order of $\\sim 50-70$ Myr, lower than the dynamical age of the LA,\nsuggesting a single star-forming episode in the LA. V$_{\\rm LSR}$ the LA\nmembers decreases with decreasing Magellanic longitude, confirming the results\nof previous LA gas studies.\n", "  We use Herschel spectrophotometry of BHR71, an embedded Class 0 protostar, to\nprovide new constraints on its physical properties. We detect 645 (non-unique)\nspectral lines amongst all spatial pixels. At least 61 different spectral lines\noriginate from the central region. A CO rotational diagram analysis shows four\nexcitation temperature components, 43 K, 197 K, 397 K, and 1057 K. Low-J CO\nlines trace the outflow while the high-J CO lines are centered on the infrared\nsource. The low-excitation emission lines of H2O trace the large-scale outflow,\nwhile the high-excitation emission lines trace a small-scale distribution\naround the equatorial plane. We model the envelope structure using the dust\nradiative transfer code, Hyperion, incorporating rotational collapse, an outer\nstatic envelope, outflow cavity, and disk. The evolution of a rotating\ncollapsing envelope can be constrained by the far-infrared/millimeter SED along\nwith the azimuthally-averaged radial intensity profile, and the structure of\nthe outflow cavity plays a critical role at shorter wavelengths. Emission at\n20-40 um requires a cavity with a constant-density inner region and a power-law\ndensity outer region. The best fit model has an envelope mass of 19 solar mass\ninside a radius of 0.315 pc and a central luminosity of 18.8 solar luminosity.\nThe time since collapse began is 24630-44000 yr, most likely around 36000 yr.\nThe corresponding mass infall rate in the envelope (1.2x10$^{-5}$ solar mass\nper year) is comparable to the stellar mass accretion rate, while the mass loss\nrate estimated from the CO outflow is 20% of the stellar mass accretion rate.\nWe find no evidence for episodic accretion.\n", "  We investigate the effects of the core-collapse supernova ejecta on a rapidly\nrotating and massive companion star. We show that the stripped mass raises by\ntwice when compare with a massive but non-rotating companion star. In close\nbinaries with orbital periods of about 1 day, the stripped masses reach up to\n$\\sim 1 M_\\odot$. By simulating the evolutions of the rotational velocities of\nthe massive companion stars based on different stripped masses, we find that\nthe rotational velocity decreases greatly for stripped mass that is higher than\nabout $1 M_\\odot$. Of all the known high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), Cygnus\nX-3 and 1WGA J0648.024418 have the shortest orbital periods of 0.2 and 1.55\ndays, respectively. The optical counterpart of the former is a Wolf-Rayet star,\nwhereas it is a hot subdwarf for the latter. Applying our model to the two\nHMXBs, we suggest that the hydrogen-rich envelopes of their optical\ncounterparts may have been stripped by CCSN ejecta.\n", "  A number of transiting exoplanets have featureless transmission spectra that\nmight suggest the presence of clouds at high altitudes. A realistic cloud model\nis necessary to understand the atmospheric conditions under which such\nhigh-altitude clouds can form. In this study, we present a new cloud model that\ntakes into account the microphysics of both condensation and coalescence. Our\nmodel provides the vertical profiles of the size and density of cloud and rain\nparticles in an updraft for a given set of physical parameters, including the\nupdraft velocity and the number density of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). We\ntest our model by comparing with observations of trade-wind cumuli on the Earth\nand ammonia ice clouds in Jupiter. For trade-wind cumuli, the model including\nboth condensation and coalescence gives predictions that are consistent with\nobservations, while the model including only condensation overestimates the\nmass density of cloud droplets by up to an order of magnitude. For Jovian\nammonia clouds, the condensation-coalescence model simultaneously reproduces\nthe effective particle radius, cloud optical thickness, and cloud geometric\nthickness inferred from Voyager observations if the updraft velocity and CCN\nnumber density are taken to be consistent with the results of moist convection\nsimulations and Galileo probe measurements, respectively. These results suggest\nthat the coalescence of condensate particles is important not only in\nterrestrial water clouds but also in Jovian ice clouds. Our model will be\nuseful to understand how the dynamics, compositions, and nucleation processes\nin exoplanetary atmospheresaffects the vertical extent and optical thickness of\nexoplanetary clouds via cloud microphysics.\n", "  The unexpectedly hard very-high-energy (VHE; $E > 100$ GeV) $\\gamma$-ray\nspectra of a few distant blazars have been interpreted as evidence for a\nreduction of the $\\gamma\\gamma$ opacity of the Universe due to the interaction\nof VHE $\\gamma$-rays with the extragalactic background light (EBL) compared to\nthe expectation from our current knowledge of the density and cosmological\nevolution of the EBL. One of the suggested solutions to this problem consisted\nof the inhomogeneity of the EBL. In this paper, we study the effects of such\ninhomogeneities on the energy density of the EBL (which then also becomes\nanisotropic) and the resulting $\\gamma\\gamma$ opacity. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the effects of cosmic voids along the line of sight to a distant\nblazar. We find that the effect of such voids on the $\\gamma\\gamma$ opacity,\nfor any realistic void size, is only of the order of $\\lesssim 1$ % and much\nsmaller than expected from a simple linear scaling of the $\\gamma\\gamma$\nopacity with the line-of-sight galaxy under-density due to a cosmic void.\n", "  Thousands of exoplanets have been detected, but only one exoplanetary transit\nwas potentially observed in X-rays from HD189733A. What makes the detection of\nexoplanets so difficult in this band? To answer this question, we run\nMonte-Carlo radiative transfer simulations to estimate the amount of X-ray flux\nreprocessed by HD189733b. Despite its extended evaporating-atmosphere, we find\nthat the X-ray absorption radius of HD189733b at 0.7keV, the mean energy of the\nphotons detected in the 0.25--2 keV energy band by XMM-Newton, is $\\sim$1.01\ntimes the planetary radius for an atmosphere of atomic Hydrogen and Helium\n(including ions), and produces a maximum depth of $\\sim$2.1% at\n$\\sim$$\\pm46$~min from the center of the planetary transit on the geometrically\nthick and optically thin corona. We compute numerically in the 0.25--2keV\nenergy band that this maximum depth is only of $\\sim$1.6% at $\\sim$$\\pm47$~min\nfrom the transit center, and little sensitive to the metal abundance assuming\nthat adding metals in the atmosphere would not dramatically change the\ndensity-temperature profile. Regarding a direct detection of HD189733b in\nX-rays, we find that the amount of flux reprocessed by the exoplanetary\natmosphere varies with the orbital phase, spanning between 3--5 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than the flux of the primary star. Additionally, the degree\nof linear polarization emerging from HD 189733b is $<$0.003%, with maximums\ndetected near planetary greatest elongations. This implies that both the\nmodulation of the X-ray flux with the orbital phase and the scattered-induced\ncontinuum polarization cannot be observed with current X-ray facilities.\n", "  Cryptographic hash functions are fundamental primitives widely used in\npractice. For such a function $f:\\{0, 1\\}^n\\to\\{0, 1\\}^m$, it is nearly\nimpossible for an adversary to produce the hash $f(x)$ without knowing the\nsecret message $x\\in\\{0, 1\\}^n$. Unfortunately, all hash functions are\nvulnerable under the side-channel attack, which is a grave concern for\ninformation security in practice. This is because typically $m\\ll n$ and an\nadversary needs only $m$ bits of information to pass the verification test.\n  In sharp contrast, we show that when quantum states are used, the leakage\nallowed can be almost the entire secret. More precisely, we call a function\nthat maps $n$ bits to $m$ qubits a quantum cryptographic function if the\nmaximum fidelity between two distinct hashes is negligible in $n$. We show that\nfor any $k=n-\\omega(\\log n)$, all quantum cryptographic hash functions remain\ncryptographically secure when leaking $k$ bits of information. By the quantum\nfingerprinting constructions of Buhrman et al.~({\\em Phys. Rev. Lett.} 87,\n167902), for all $m=\\omega(\\log n)$, there exist such quantum cryptographic\nhash functions. We also show that one only needs $\\omega(\\log^2 n)$ qubits to\nverify a quantum cryptographic hash, rather than the whole classical\ninformation needed to generate one.\n  Our result also shows that to approximately produce a small amount of quantum\nside information on a classical secret, it may require almost the full\ninformation of the secret. This large gap represents a significant barrier for\nproving quantum security of classical-proof extractors.\n", "  We study the mid-infrared (MIR) properties of galaxies in compact groups and\ntheir environmental dependence using the \\textit{Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer (WISE)} data. We use a volume-limited sample of 670 compact groups and\ntheir 2175 member galaxies with $M_r< -19.77$ and $0.01<z<0.0741$, drawn from\n\\citet{sohn+16}, which were identified using a friends-of-friends algorithm.\nAmong the 2175 galaxies, 1541 galaxies are detected at \\textit{WISE} 12\n$\\micron$ with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3. Among the 1541 galaxies,\n433 AGN-host galaxies are identified by using both optical and MIR\nclassification scheme. Using the remaining 1108 non-AGN galaxies, we find that\nthe MIR $[3.4]-[12]$ colors of compact group early-type galaxies are on average\nbluer than those of cluster early-type galaxies. When compact groups have both\nearly- and late-type member galaxies, the MIR colors of the late-type members\nin those compact groups are bluer than the MIR colors of cluster late-type\ngalaxies. As compact groups are located in denser regions, they tend to have\nlarger early-type galaxy fractions and bluer MIR color galaxies. These trends\nare also seen for neighboring galaxies around compact groups. However, compact\ngroup member galaxies always have larger early-type galaxy fractions and bluer\nMIR colors than their neighboring galaxies. Our findings suggest that the\nproperties of compact group galaxies depend on both internal and external\nenvironments of compact groups, and that galaxy evolution is faster in compact\ngroups than in the central regions of clusters.\n", "  The development of the Zeeman-Doppler Imagine (ZDI) technique has provided\nsynoptic observations of surface magnetic fields of low-mass stars. This led\nthe Stellar Astrophysics community to adopt modeling techniques that have been\nused in solar physics using solar magnetograms. However, many of these\ntechniques have been neglected by the solar community due to their failure to\nreproduce solar observations. Nevertheless, some of these techniques are still\nused to simulate the coronae and winds of solar analogs. Here we present a\ncomparative study between two MHD models for the solar corona and solar wind.\nThe first type of model is a polytropic wind model, and the second is the\nphysics-based AWSOM model. We show that while the AWSOM model consistently\nreproduces many solar observations, the polytropic model fails to reproduce\nmany of these observations and in the cases it does, its solutions are\nunphysical. Our recommendation is that polytropic models, which are used to\nestimate mass-loss rates and other parameters of solar analogs, must be first\ncalibrated with solar observations. Alternatively, these models can be\ncalibrated with models that capture more detailed physics of the solar corona\n(such as the AWSOM model), and that can reproduce solar observations in a\nconsistent manner. Without such a calibration, the results of the polytropic\nmodels cannot be validated, but they can be wrongly used by others.\n", "  In this study we synthesize the results of four previous studies on the\nglobal energetics of solar flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs),\nwhich include magnetic, thermal, nonthermal, and CME energies in 399 solar M\nand X-class flare events observed during the first 3.5 years of the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. Our findings are: (1) The sum of the mean\nnonthermal energy of flare-accelerated particles ($E_{\\mathrm{nt}}$), the\nenergy of direct heating ($E_{\\mathrm{dir}}$), and the energy in coronal mass\nejections ($E_{\\mathrm{CME}}$), which are the primary energy dissipation\nprocesses in a flare, is found to have a ratio of\n$(E_{\\mathrm{nt}}+E_{\\mathrm{dir}}+ E_{\\mathrm{CME}})/E_{\\mathrm{mag}} = 0.87\n\\pm 0.18$, compared with the dissipated magnetic free energy\n$E_{\\mathrm{mag}}$, which confirms energy closure within the measurement\nuncertainties and corroborates the magnetic origin of flares and CMEs; (2) The\nenergy partition of the dissipated magnetic free energy is: $0.51\\pm0.17$ in\nnonthermal energy of $\\ge 6$ keV electrons, $0.17\\pm0.17$ in nonthermal $\\ge 1$\nMeV ions, $0.07\\pm0.14$ in CMEs, and $0.07\\pm0.17$ in direct heating; (3) The\nthermal energy is almost always less than the nonthermal energy, which is\nconsistent with the thick-target model; (4) The bolometric luminosity in\nwhite-light flares is comparable with the thermal energy in soft X-rays (SXR);\n(5) Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events carry a fraction $\\approx 0.03$ of\nthe CME energy, which is consistent with CME-driven shock acceleration; and (6)\nThe warm-target model predicts a lower limit of the low-energy cutoff at $e_c\n\\approx 6$ keV, based on the mean differential emission measure (DEM) peak\ntemperature of $T_e=8.6$ MK during flares. This work represents the first\nstatistical study that establishes energy closure in solar flare/CME events.\n", "  The canonical pulsar magnetosphere contains a bubble of closed magnetic field\nlines that is separated from the open lines by current sheets, and different\nbranches of such sheets intersect at a critical line on the light cylinder\n(LC). The LC is located far away from the neutron star, and the pulsar's\nintrinsic magnetic field at that location is much weaker than the commonly\nquoted numbers applicable to the star surface. The magnetic field surrounding\nsupermassive black holes that reside in galactic nuclei is of comparable or\ngreater strength. Therefore, when the pulsar travels inside such regions, a\nnon-negligible Lorentz force is experienced by the current sheets, which tends\nto pull them apart at the critical line. As breakage occurs, instabilities\nensue that burst the bubble, allowing closed field lines to snap open and\nrelease large amounts of electromagnetic energy, sufficient to power fast radio\nbursts (FRBs). This process is necessarily associated with an environment of a\nstrong magnetic field and thus might explain the large rotation measures\nrecorded for the FRBs. We sketch a portrait of the process and examine its\ncompatibility with several other salient features of the FRBs.\n", "  We have studied the magnetotransport properties of the metallic, p-type\nSb2Te2Se which is a topological insulator. Magnetoresistance shows Shubnikov de\nHaas oscillations in fields above B=15 T. The maxima/minima positions of\noscillations measured at different tilt angles with respect to the B direction\nalign with the normal component of field Bcosine, implying the existence of a\n2D Fermi surface in Sb2Te2Se. The value of the Berry phase determined from a\nLandau level fan diagram is very close to 0.5, further suggesting that the\noscillations result from topological surface states. From Lifshitz-Kosevich\nanalyses, the position of the Fermi level is found to be EF =250 meV, above the\nDirac point. This value of EF is almost 3 times as large as that in our\nprevious study on the Bi2Se2:1Te0:9 topological insulator; however, it still\ntouches the tip of the bulk valence band. This explains the metallic behavior\nand hole-like bulk charge carriers in the Sb2Te2Se compound.\n", "  In solar coronal loops, thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) is a phenomenon that\ncan occur when the heating is both highly-stratified and quasi-constant.\nUnambiguous observational identification of TNE would thus permit to strongly\nconstrain heating scenarios. Up to now, while TNE is the standard\ninterpretation of coronal rain, the long-term periodic evolution predicted by\nsimulations has never been observed yet. However, the detection of long-period\nintensity pulsations (periods of several hours) has been recently reported with\nSoHO/EIT, and this phenomenon appears to be very common in loops. Moreover, the\nthree intensity-pulsation events that we recently studied with SDO/AIA show\nstrong evidence for TNE in warm loops. In the present paper, a realistic loop\ngeometry from LFFF extrapolations is used as input to 1D hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our simulations show that for the present loop geometry, the\nheating has to be asymmetrical to produce TNE. We analyse in detail one\nparticular simulation that reproduces the average thermal behavior of one of\nthe pulsating loop bundle observed with AIA. We compare the properties of this\nsimulation with the properties deduced from the observations. The magnetic\ntopology of the LFFF extrapolations points to the presence of sites of\npreferred reconnection at one footpoint, supporting the presence of asymmetric\nheating. In addition, we can reproduce the temporal large-scale intensity\nproperties of the pulsating loops. This simulation further strengthens the\ninterpretation of the observed pulsations as signatures of TNE. This thus gives\nimportant information on the heating localization and time scale for these\nloops.\n", "  Dynamic and thermal processes regulate the structure of the multi-phase\ninterstellar medium (ISM), and ultimately establish how galaxies evolve through\nstar formation. Thus, to constrain ISM models and better understand the\ninterplay of these processes, it is of great interest to measure the thermal\npressure ($P_{\\rm th}$) of the diffuse, neutral gas. By combining [C II] 158\n$\\mu$m, HI, and CO data from 31 galaxies selected from the Herschel KINGFISH\nsample, we have measured thermal pressures in 534 predominantly atomic regions\nwith typical sizes of $\\sim$1 kiloparsec. We find a distribution of thermal\npressures in the $P_{\\rm th}/k\\sim10^3-10^5$ K cm$^{-3}$ range. For a\nsub-sample of regions with conditions similar to those of the diffuse, neutral\ngas in the Galactic plane, we find thermal pressures that follow a log-normal\ndistribution with a median value of $P_{\\rm th}/k\\approx3600$ K cm$^{-3}$.\nThese results are consistent with thermal pressure measurements using other\nobservational methods. We find that $P_{\\rm th}$ increases with radiation field\nstrength and star formation activity, as expected from the close link between\nthe heating of the gas and the star formation rate. Our thermal pressure\nmeasurements fall in the regime where a two-phase ISM with cold and warm\nneutral medium could exist in pressure equilibrium. Finally, we find that the\nmidplane thermal pressure of the diffuse gas is about $\\sim30$% of the vertical\nweight of the overlying ISM, consistent with results from hydrodynamical\nsimulations of self-regulated star formation in galactic disks.\n", "  We present the detailed characterization of two extremely red submillimeter\ngalaxies (SMGs), ASXDF1100.053.1 and 231.1, with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).\nThese SMGs were selected originally using AzTEC at 1100 micron, and are\nobserved by Herschel to be faint at 100--500 micron. Their (sub)millimeter\ncolors are as red as -- or redder -- than known z>~5 SMGs; indeed,\nASXDF1100.053.1 is redder than HFLS 3, which lies at z=6.3. They are also faint\nand red in the near-/mid-infrared: ~1 microJy at IRAC 4.5 micron and <0.2\nmicroJy in the Ks filter. These SMGs are also faint in the radio waveband,\nwhere F_6GHz=4.5 microJy for ASXDF1100.053.1 and F_1.4GHz=28 microJy for\nASXDF1100.231.1, suggestive of z=6.5^{+1.4}_{-1.1} and z=4.1^{+0.6}_{-0.7} for\nASXDF1100.053.1 and 231.1, respectively. ASXDF1100.231.1 has a flux excess in\nthe 3.6-micron filter, probably due to H$\\alpha$ emission at z=4--5. Derived\nproperties of ASXDF1100.053.1 for z=5.5--7.5 and 231.1 for z=3.5--5.5 are as\nfollows: their infrared luminosities are [6.5-7.4]x10^{12} and\n[4.2-4.5]x10^{12} L_sun; their stellar masses are [0.9-2]x10^{11} and\n[0.4-3]x10^{10} M_sun; their circularized half-light radii in the ALMA maps are\n~1 and <~0.2 kpc (~2--3 kpc for 90% of the total flux). Lastly, their surface\ninfrared luminosity densities, Sigma_IR, are ~1x10^{12} and >~1.5x10^{13} L_sun\nkpc^{-2}, similar to values seen for local (U)LIRGs. These data suggest that\nASXDF1100.053.1 and 231.1 are compact SMGs at z>~4 and can plausibly evolve\ninto z>~3 compact quiescent galaxies.\n", "  Here we present an in-depth analysis of the periodicity of the continua and\nbroad emission lines of a quasar E1821+643. We applied non-parametric composite\nmodels, the linear sum of stationary and non-stationary Gaussian processes, and\nquantified contribution of their periodic parts. We found important qualitative\ndifferences among the three periodic signals. Periods of $\\sim 2200$ and $\\sim\n4500$ days appear in both continua 5100 \\AA \\, and 4200 \\AA \\,, as well as in\nthe H$\\gamma$ emission line. Their integer ratio is nearly harmonic $\\sim\n\\frac{1}{2}$, suggesting the same physical origin. We discuss the nature of\nthese periods, proposing that the system of two objects in dynamically\ninteraction can be origin of two largest periods.\n", "  We study the integral Galactic extinction and reddening based on the galaxy\ncatalog of the South Galactic Cap U-band Sky Survey (SCUSS), where $u$ band\ngalaxy number counts and $u-r$ color distribution are used to derive the\nGalactic extinction and reddening respectively. We compare these independent\nstatistical measurements with the reddening map of \\citet{Schlegel1998}(SFD)\nand find that both the extinction and reddening from the number counts and\ncolor distribution are in good agreement with the SFD results at low extinction\nregions ($E(B-V)^{SFD}<0.12$ mag). However, for high extinction regions\n($E(B-V)^{SFD}>0.12$ mag), the SFD map overestimates the Galactic reddening\nsystematically, which can be approximated by a linear relation $\\Delta E(B-V)=\n0.43[E(B-V)^{SFD}-0.12$]. By combing the results of galaxy number counts and\ncolor distribution together, we find that the shape of the Galactic extinction\ncurve is in good agreement with the standard $R_V=3.1$ extinction law of\n\\cite{ODonnell1994}.\n", "  A comprehensive study of the physical parameters of active region fan loops\nis presented using the observations recorded with the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrometer (IRIS), the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on-board Hinode and the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager\n(HMI) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The fan loops emerging\nfrom non-flaring AR~11899 (near the disk-center) on 19th November, 2013 are\nclearly discernible in AIA 171~{\\AA} images and those obtained in \\ion{Fe}{8}\nand \\ion{Si}{7} images using EIS. Our measurements of electron densities reveal\nthat the footpoints of these loops are approximately at constant pressure with\nelectron densities of $\\log\\,N_{e}=$ 10.1 cm$^{-3}$ at $\\log\\,[T/K]=5.15$\n(\\ion{O}{4}), and $\\log\\,N_{e}=$ 8.9 cm$^{-3}$ at $\\log\\,[T/K]=6.15$\n(\\ion{Si}{10}). The electron temperature diagnosed across the fan loops by\nmeans of EM-Loci suggest that at the footpoints, there are two temperature\ncomponents at $\\log\\,[T/K]=4.95$ and 5.95, which are picked-up by IRIS lines\nand EIS lines respectively. At higher heights, the loops are nearly isothermal\nat $\\log\\,[T/K]=5.95$, that remained constant along the loop. The measurement\nof Doppler shift using IRIS lines suggests that the plasma at the footpoints of\nthese loops is predominantly redshifted by 2-3~km~s$^{-1}$ in \\ion{C}{2},\n10-15~km~s$^{-1}$ in \\ion{Si}{4} and $~$15{--}20~km~s$^{-1}$ in \\ion{O}{4},\nreflecting the increase in the speed of downflows with increasing temperature\nfrom $\\log\\,[T/K]=4.40$ to 5.15. These observations can be explained by low\nfrequency nanoflares or impulsive heating, and provide further important\nconstraints on the modeling of the dynamics of fan loops.\n", "  Since only the magnetic conditions at the photosphere can be routinely\nobserved in current observations, it is of great significance to find out the\ninfluences of photospheric magnetic conditions on solar eruptive activities.\nPrevious studies about catastrophe indicated that the magnetic system\nconsisting of a flux rope in a partially open bipolar field is subject to\ncatastrophe, but not if the bipolar field is completely closed under the same\nspecified photospheric conditions. In order to investigate the influence of the\nphotospheric magnetic conditions on the catastrophic behavior of this system,\nwe expand upon the 2.5 dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model in\nCartesian coordinates to simulate the evolution of the equilibrium states of\nthe system under different photospheric flux distributions. Our simulation\nresults reveal that a catastrophe occurs only when the photospheric flux is not\nconcentrated too much toward the polarity inversion line and the source regions\nof the bipolar field are not too weak; otherwise no catastrophe occurs. As a\nresult, under certain photospheric conditions, a catastrophe could take place\nin a completely closed configuration whereas it ceases to exist in a partially\nopen configuration. This indicates that whether the background field is\ncompletely closed or partially open is not the only necessary condition for the\nexistence of catastrophe, and that the photospheric conditions also play a\ncrucial role in the catastrophic behavior of the flux rope system.\n", "  We present an approach using a combination of coupled channel scattering\ncalculations with a machine- learning technique based on Gaussian Process\nregression to determine the sensitivity of the rate constants for non-adiabatic\ntransitions in inelastic atomic collisions to variations of the underlying\nadiabatic interaction potentials. Using this approach, we improve the previous\ncomputations of the rate constants for the fine-structure transitions in\ncollisions of O(3Pj) with atomic H. We compute the error bars of the rate\nconstants corresponding to 20 % variations of the ab initio potentials and show\nthat this method can be used to determine which of the individual adiabatic\npotentials are more or less important for the outcome of different\nfine-structure changing collisions.\n", "  It is predicted that orbital decay by gravitational-wave radiation and tidal\ninteraction will cause some close-binary stars to merge within a Hubble time.\nThe merger of a helium-core white dwarf with a main-sequence star can produce a\nred giant branch star that has a low-mass hydrogen envelope when helium is\nignited and thus become a hot subdwarf. Because detailed calculations have not\nbeen made, we compute post-merger models with a stellar evolution code. We find\nthe evolutionary paths available to merger remnants and find the pre-merger\nconditions that lead to the formation of hot subdwarfs. We find that some such\nmergers result in the formation of stars with intermediate helium-rich\nsurfaces. These stars later develop helium-poor surfaces owing to diffusion.\nCombining our results with a model population and comparing to observed stars,\nwe find that some observed intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs can be\nexplained as the remnants of the mergers of helium-core white dwarfs with\nlow-mass main-sequence stars.\n", "  We study a possible connection between different non-thermal emissions from\nthe inner few parsecs of the Galaxy. We analyze the origin of the gamma-ray\nsource 2FGL J1745.6-2858 (or 3FGL J1745.6-2859c) in the Galactic Center and the\ndiffuse hard X-ray component recently found by NuSTAR, as well as the radio\nemission and processes of hydrogen ionization from this area. We assume that a\nsource in the GC injected energetic particles with power-law spectrum into the\nsurrounding medium in the past or continues to inject until now. The energetic\nparticles may be protons, electrons or a combination of both. These particles\ndiffuse to the surrounding medium and interact with gas, magnetic field and\nbackground photons to produce non-thermal emissions. We study the spectral and\nspatial features of the hard X-ray emission and gamma-ray emission by the\nparticles from the central source. Our goal is to examine whether the hard\nX-ray and gamma-ray emissions have a common origin. Our estimations show that\nin the case of pure hadronic models the expected flux of hard X-ray emission is\ntoo low. Despite protons can produce a non-zero contribution in gamma-ray\nemission, it is unlikely that they and their secondary electrons can make a\nsignificant contribution in hard X-ray flux. In the case of pure leptonic\nmodels it is possible to reproduce both X-ray and gamma-ray emissions for both\ntransient and continuous supply models. However, in the case of continuous\nsupply model the ionization rate of molecular hydrogen may significantly exceed\nthe observed value.\n", "  We constrain the X-ray properties of the nearby $(360\\,{\\rm pc})$, old\n($5\\,{\\rm Myr}$) pulsar B1133+16 with $\\sim 100\\,{\\rm ks}$ effective exposure\ntime by {\\it XMM-Newton}. The observed pulsar flux in the 0.2-3 keV energy\nrange is $\\sim 10^{-14} \\, {\\rm erg \\, cm}^{-2} \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$, which results\nin the recording of $\\sim 600$ source counts with the EPIC pn and MOS\ndetectors. The X-ray radiation is dominated by nonthermal radiation and is well\ndescribed by both a single power-law model (PL) and a sum of blackbody and\npower-law emission (BB+PL). The BB+PL model results in a spectral photon index\n$\\Gamma=2.4^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ and a nonthermal flux in the 0.2-3 keV energy range\nof $(7\\pm 2) \\times 10^{-15}\\, {\\rm erg \\, cm}^{-2} \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$. The\nthermal emission is consistent with the blackbody emission from a small hot\nspot with a radius of $R_{\\rm pc} \\approx 14^{+7}_{-5} \\, {\\rm m}$ and a\ntemperature of $T_{\\rm s} = 2.9^{+0.6}_{-0.4} \\, {\\rm MK}$. Assuming that the\nhot spot corresponds to the polar cap of the pulsar, we can use the magnetic\nflux conservation law to estimate the magnetic field at the surface $B_{\\rm s}\n\\approx 3.9 \\times 10^{14} \\, {\\rm G}$. The observations are in good agreement\nwith the predictions of the partially screened gap model, which assumes the\nexistence of small-scale surface magnetic field structures in the polar cap\nregion.\n", "  We present the ALMA survey of CO(2-1) emission from the 1/5 solar\nmetallicity, Local Group dwarf galaxy NGC 6822. We achieve high (0.9 arcsec ~ 2\npc) spatial resolution while covering large area: four 250 pc x 250 pc regions\nthat encompass ~2/3 of NGC 6822's star formation. In these regions, we resolve\n~150 compact CO clumps that have small radii (~2-3 pc), narrow line width (~1\nkm/s), and low filling factor across the galaxy. This is consistent with other\nrecent studies of low metallicity galaxies, but here shown with a 15 times\nlarger sample. At parsec scales, CO emission correlates with 8 micron emission\nbetter than with 24 micron emission and anti-correlates with Halpha, so that\nPAH emission may be an effective tracer of molecular gas at low metallicity.\nThe properties of the CO clumps resemble those of similar-size structures in\nGalactic clouds except of slightly lower surface brightness and CO-to-H2 ratio\n~1-2 times the Galactic value. The clumps exist inside larger atomic-molecular\ncomplexes with masses typical for giant molecular cloud. Using dust to trace H2\nfor the entire complex, we find CO-to-H2 to be ~20-25 times the Galactic value,\nbut with strong dependence on spatial scale and variations between complexes\nthat may track their evolutionary state. The H2-to-HI ratio is low globally and\nonly mildly above unity within the complexes. The SFR-to-H2 ratio is ~3-5 times\nhigher in the complexes than in massive disk galaxies, but after accounting for\nthe bias from targeting star-forming regions, we conclude that the global\nmolecular gas depletion time may be as long as in massive disk galaxies.\n", "  Growing observations of brown dwarfs have provided evidence for strong\natmospheric circulation on these objects. Directly imaged planets share similar\nobservations, and can be viewed as low-gravity versions of brown dwarfs.\nVigorous condensate cycles of chemical species in their atmospheres are\ninferred by observations and theoretical studies, and latent heating associated\nwith condensation is expected to be important in shaping atmospheric\ncirculation and influencing cloud patchiness. We present a qualitative\ndescription of the mechanisms by which condensational latent heating influence\nthe circulation, and then illustrate them using an idealized general\ncirculation model that includes a condensation cycle of silicates with latent\nheating and molecular weight effect due to rainout of condensate. Simulations\nwith conditions appropriate for typical T dwarfs exhibit the development of\nlocalized storms and east-west jets. The storms are spatially inhomogeneous,\nevolving on timescale of hours to days and extending vertically from the\ncondensation level to the tropopause. The fractional area of the brown dwarf\ncovered by active storms is small. Based on a simple analytic model, we\nquantitatively explain the area fraction of moist plumes, and show its\ndependence on radiative timescale and convective available potential energy. We\npredict that, if latent heating dominates cloud formation processes, the\nfractional coverage area by clouds decreases as the spectral type goes through\nthe L/T transition from high to lower effective temperature. This is a natural\nconsequence of the variation of radiative timescale and convective available\npotential energy with spectral type.\n", "  In this paper we obtain a lower bound of exponent of average probability of\nerror for classical quantum multiple access channel, which implies that for all\nrate pairs in the capacity region is achievable by a code with exponential\nprobability of error. Thus we re-obtain the direct coding theorem.\n", "  In this paper, we present the tools used to search for galaxy clusters in the\nKilo Degree Survey (KiDS), and our first results. The cluster detection is\nbased on an implementation of the optimal filtering technique that enables us\nto identify clusters as over-densities in the distribution of galaxies using\ntheir positions on the sky, magnitudes, and photometric redshifts. The\ncontamination and completeness of the cluster catalog are derived using mock\ncatalogs based on the data themselves. The optimal signal to noise threshold\nfor the cluster detection is obtained by randomizing the galaxy positions and\nselecting the value that produces a contamination of less than 20%. Starting\nfrom a subset of clusters detected with high significance at low redshifts, we\nshift them to higher redshifts to estimate the completeness as a function of\nredshift: the average completeness is ~ 85%. An estimate of the mass of the\nclusters is derived using the richness as a proxy. We obtained 1858 candidate\nclusters with redshift 0 < z_c < 0.7 and mass 13.5 < log(M500/Msun) < 15 in an\narea of 114 sq. degrees (KiDS ESO-DR2). A comparison with publicly available\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-based cluster catalogs shows that we match more\nthan 50% of the clusters (77% in the case of the redMaPPer catalog). We also\ncross-matched our cluster catalog with the Abell clusters, and clusters found\nby XMM and in the Planck-SZ survey; however, only a small number of them lie\ninside the KiDS area currently available.\n", "  We have obtained new images of the protoplanetary disk orbiting TW Hya in\nvisible, total intensity light with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph\n(STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), using the newly commissioned BAR5\nocculter. These HST/STIS observations achieved an inner working angle\n$\\sim$0.2\\arcsec, or 11.7~AU, probing the system at angular radii coincident\nwith recent images of the disk obtained by ALMA and in polarized intensity\nnear-infrared light. By comparing our new STIS images to those taken with STIS\nin 2000 and with NICMOS in 1998, 2004, and 2005, we demonstrate that TW Hya's\nazimuthal surface brightness asymmetry moves coherently in position angle.\nBetween 50~AU and 141~AU we measure a constant angular velocity in the\nazimuthal brightness asymmetry of 22.7$^\\circ$~yr$^{-1}$ in a counter-clockwise\ndirection, equivalent to a period of 15.9~yr assuming circular motion. Both the\n(short) inferred period and lack of radial dependence of the moving shadow\npattern are inconsistent with Keplerian rotation at these disk radii. We\nhypothesize that the asymmetry arises from the fact that the disk interior to\n1~AU is inclined and precessing due to a planetary companion, thus partially\nshadowing the outer disk. Further monitoring of this and other shadows on\nprotoplanetary disks potentially opens a new avenue for indirectly observing\nthe sites of planet formation.\n", "  Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are the faintest known galaxies and due to\ntheir incredibly low surface brightness, it is difficult to find them beyond\nthe Local Group. We report a serendipitous discovery of an UFD, Fornax UFD1, in\nthe outskirts of NGC 1316, a giant galaxy in the Fornax cluster. The new galaxy\nis located at a projected radius of 55 kpc in the south-east of NGC 1316. This\nUFD is found as a small group of resolved stars in the Hubble Space Telescope\nimages of a halo field of NGC 1316, obtained as part of the Carnegie-Chicago\nHubble Program. Resolved stars in this galaxy are consistent with being mostly\nmetal-poor red giant branch (RGB) stars. Applying the tip of the RGB method to\nthe mean magnitude of the two brightest RGB stars, we estimate the distance to\nthis galaxy, 19.0 +- 1.3 Mpc. Fornax UFD1 is probably a member of the Fornax\ncluster. The color-magnitude diagram of these stars is matched by a 12 Gyr\nisochrone with low metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -2.4). Total magnitude and effective\nradius of Fornax UFD1 are Mv ~ -7.6 +- 0.2 mag and r_eff = 146 +- 9 pc, which\nare similar to those of Virgo UFD1 that was discovered recently in the\nintracluster field of Virgo by Jang & Lee (2014).Fornax UFD1 is the most\ndistant known UFD that is confirmed by resolved stars. This indicates that UFDs\nare ubiquitous and that more UFDs remain to be discovered in the Fornax\ncluster.\n", "  Imaging bundles provide a convenient way to translate a spatially coherent\nimage, yet conventional imaging bundles made from silica fibre optics typically\nremain expensive with large losses due to poor filling factors (~40%). We\npresent the characterisation of a novel polymer imaging bundle made from\npoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) that is considerably cheaper and a better\nalternative to silica imaging bundles over short distances (~1 m; from the\nmiddle to the edge of a telescope's focal plane). The large increase in filling\nfactor (92% for the polymer imaging bundle) outweighs the large increase in\noptical attenuation from using PMMA (1 dB/m) instead of silica (10^{-3} dB/m).\nWe present and discuss current and possible future multi-object applications of\nthe polymer imaging bundle in the context of astronomical instrumentation\nincluding: field acquisition, guiding, wavefront sensing, narrow-band imaging,\naperture masking, and speckle imaging. The use of PMMA limits its use in low\nlight applications (e.g. imaging of galaxies), however it is possible to\nfabricate polymer imaging bundles from a range of polymers that are better\nsuited to the desired science.\n", "  In time domain astronomy, recurrent transients present a special problem: how\nto infer total populations from limited observations. Monitoring observations\nmay give a biassed view of the underlying population due to limitations on\nobserving time, visibility and instrumental sensitivity. A similar problem\nexists in the life sciences, where animal populations (such as migratory birds)\nor disease prevalence, must be estimated from sparse and incomplete data. The\nclass of methods termed Capture-Recapture is used to reconstruct population\nestimates from time-series records of encounters with the study population.\nThis paper investigates the performance of Capture-Recapture methods in\nastronomy via a series of numerical simulations. The Blackbirds code simulates\nmonitoring of populations of transients, in this case accreting binary stars\n(neutron star or black hole accreting from a stellar companion) under a range\nof observing strategies. We first generate realistic light-curves for\npopulations of binaries with contrasting orbital period distributions. These\nmodels are then randomly sampled at observing cadences typical of existing and\nplanned monitoring surveys. The classical capture-recapture methods,\nLincoln-Peterson, Schnabel estimators, related techniques, and newer methods\nimplemented in the Rcapture package are compared. A general exponential model\nbased on the radioactive decay law is introduced, and demonstrated to recover\n(at 95% confidence) the underlying population abundance and duty cycle, in a\nfraction of the observing visits (10-50%) required to discover all the sources\nin the simulation. Capture-Recapture is a promising addition to the toolbox of\ntime domain astronomy, and methods implemented in R by the biostats community\ncan be readily called from within Python.\n", "  To investigate the relationship between thermal and non-thermal components in\nmerger galaxy clusters, we present deep JVLA and Chandra observations of the\nHST Frontier Fields cluster MACS J0717.5+3745. The Chandra image shows a\ncomplex merger event, with at least four components belonging to different\nmerging subclusters. NW of the cluster, $\\sim 0.7$ Mpc from the center, there\nis a ram-pressure-stripped core that appears to have traversed the densest\nparts of the cluster after entering the ICM from the direction of a galaxy\nfilament to the SE. We detect a density discontinuity NNE of this core which we\nspeculate is associated with a cold front. Our radio images reveal new details\nfor the complex radio relic and radio halo in this cluster. In addition, we\ndiscover several new filamentary radio sources with sizes of 100-300 kpc. A few\nof these seem to be connected to the main radio relic, while others are either\nembedded within the radio halo or projected onto it. A narrow-angled-tailed\n(NAT) radio galaxy, a cluster member, is located at the center of the radio\nrelic. The steep spectrum tails of this AGN leads into the large radio relic\nwhere the radio spectrum flattens again. This morphological connection between\nthe NAT radio galaxy and relic provides evidence for re-acceleration (revival)\nof fossil electrons. The presence of hot $\\gtrsim 20$ keV ICM gas detected by\nChandra near the relic location provides additional support for this\nre-acceleration scenario.\n", "  The standard model for GRB afterglow emission treats the accelerated electron\npopulation as a simple power law, $N(E) \\propto E^{-p}$ for $p \\gtrsim 2$.\nHowever, in standard Fermi shock acceleration a substantial fraction of the\nswept-up particles do not enter the acceleration process at all. Additionally,\nif acceleration is efficient then the nonlinear backreaction of accelerated\nparticles on the shock structure modifies the shape of the non-thermal tail of\nthe particle spectra. Both of these modifications to the standard synchrotron\nafterglow impact the luminosity, spectra, and temporal variation of the\nafterglow. To examine the effects of including thermal particles and nonlinear\nparticle acceleration on afterglow emission, we follow a hydrodynamical model\nfor an afterglow jet and simulate acceleration at numerous points during the\nevolution. When thermal particles are included, we find that the electron\npopulation is at no time well-fitted by a single power law, though the\nhighest-energy electrons are; if the acceleration is efficient, then the power\nlaw region is even smaller. Our model predicts hard-soft-hard spectral\nevolution at X-ray energies, as well as an uncoupled X-ray and optical light\ncurve. Additionally, we show that including emission from thermal particles has\ndrastic effects (factors of 100 and 30, respectively) on the observed flux at\noptical and GeV energies. This enhancement of GeV emission makes afterglow\ndetections by future $\\gamma$-ray observatories, such as CTA, very likely.\n", "  Recent observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS)\nappear to show impulsive brightenings in high temperature lines, which when\ncombined with simultaneous ground based observations in H$\\alpha$, appear\nco-spatial to Ellerman Bombs (EBs). We use the RADYN 1-dimensional radiative\ntransfer code in an attempt to try and reproduce the observed line profiles and\nsimulate the atmospheric conditions of these events. Combined with the MULTI/RH\nline synthesis codes, we compute the H$\\alpha$, Ca II 8542~\\AA, and Mg II h \\&\nk lines for these simulated events and compare them to previous observations.\nOur findings hint that the presence of superheated regions in the photosphere\n($>$10,000 K) is not a plausible explanation for the production of EB\nsignatures. While we are able to recreate EB-like line profiles in H$\\alpha$,\nCa II 8542~\\AA, and Mg II h \\& k, we cannot achieve agreement with all of these\nsimultaneously.\n", "  An analogue of the Oppenheimer-Synder collapsing model is treated\nanalytically, where the matter source is a scalar field with an exponential\npotential. An exact solution is derived followed by matching to a suitable\nexterior geometry, and an analysis of the visibility of the singularity. In\nsome situations, the collapse indeed leads to a finite time curvature\nsingularity, which is always hidden from the exterior by an apparent horizon.\n", "  Searches for stellar companions to hot Jupiters (HJs) have revealed that\nplanetary systems hosting a HJ are approximately three times more likely to\nhave a stellar companion with a semimajor axis between 50 and 2000 AU, compared\nto field stars. This correlation suggests that HJ formation is affected by the\nstellar binary companion. A potential model is high-eccentricity migration, in\nwhich the binary companion induces high-eccentricity Lidov-Kozai (LK)\noscillations in the proto-HJ orbit, triggering orbital migration driven by\ntides. A pitfall of this `binary-LK' model is that the observed stellar\nbinaries hosting HJs are typically too wide to produce HJs in sufficient\nnumbers, because of suppression by short-range forces. We propose a\nmodification to the binary-LK model in which there is a second giant planet\norbiting the proto-HJ at a semimajor axis of several tens of AU. Such\ncompanions are currently hidden to observations, but their presence could be\nmanifested by a propagation of the perturbation of the stellar binary companion\ninwards to the proto-HJ, thereby overcoming the barrier imposed by short-range\nforces. Our model does not require the planetary companion orbit to be\neccentric and/or inclined with respect to the proto-HJ, but its semimajor axis\nshould lie in a specific range given the planetary mass and binary semimajor\naxis, and the inclination with respect to the binary should be near $40^\\circ$\nor $140^\\circ$. Our prediction for planetary companions to HJs in stellar\nbinaries should be testable by future observations.\n", "  We investigate numerically Alfv\\'en waves propagating along an axisymmetric\nand non-isothermal solar flux tube embedded in the solar atmosphere. The tube\nmagnetic field is current-free and diverges with height, and the waves are\nexcited by a periodic driver along the tube magnetic field lines. The main\nresults are that the two wave variables, the velocity and magnetic field\nperturbations in the azimuthal direction, behave differently as a result of\ngradients of physical parameters along the tube. To explain these differences\nin the wave behavior, the time evolution of the wave variables and the\nresulting cutoff period for each wave variable are calculated, and used to\ndetermine regions in the solar chromosphere where strong wave reflection may\noccur.\n", "  The scattering amplitude of polarized nucleons has been found within the\nframework of the Klein Gordon with the phenomenological spin - orbit potential.\nIt has the Glauber type representation. The differential cross sections of\npolarized nucleon are considered and discussed.The Yukawa potential is applied\nfor this problem to determine the polarization of high energy scattering\nnucleons.\n", "  The velocity distribution of dark matter near the Earth is important for an\naccurate analysis of the signals in terrestrial detectors. This distribution is\ntypically extracted from numerical simulations. Here we address the possibility\nof deriving the velocity distribution function analytically. We derive a\ndifferential equation which is a function of radius and the radial component of\nthe velocity. Under various assumptions this can be solved, and we compare the\nsolution with the results from controlled numerical simulations. Our findings\ncomplement the previously derived tangential velocity distribution. We hereby\ndemonstrate that the entire distribution function, below 0.7 v_esc, can be\nderived analytically for spherical and equilibrated dark matter structures.\n", "  We present a detailed study of a molecular outflow feature in the nearby\nstarburst galaxy NGC 253 using ALMA. We find that this feature is clearly\nassociated with the edge of NGC 253's prominent ionized outflow, has a\nprojected length of ~300 pc, with a width of ~50 pc and a velocity dispersion\nof ~40 km s^-1, consistent with an ejection from the disk about 1 Myr ago. The\nkinematics of the molecular gas in this feature can be interpreted (albeit not\nuniquely) as accelerating at a rate of 1 km s^-1 pc^-1. In this scenario, the\ngas is approaching escape velocity at the last measured point. Strikingly,\nbright tracers of dense molecular gas (HCN, CN, HCO+, CS) are also detected in\nthe molecular outflow: We measure an HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) line ratio of ~1/10 in\nthe outflow, similar to that in the central starburst region of NGC 253 and\nother starburst galaxies. By contrast, the HCN/CO line ratio in the NGC 253\ndisk is significantly lower (~1/30), similar to other nearby galaxy disks. This\nstrongly suggests that the streamer gas originates from the starburst, and that\nits physical state does not change significantly over timescales of ~1 Myr\nduring its entrainment in the outflow. Simple calculations indicate that\nradiation pressure is not the main mechanism for driving the outflow. The\npresence of such dense material in molecular outflows needs to be accounted for\nin simulations of galactic outflows.\n", "  The modeling of Li-Paczy\\'{n}ski macronova/kilonova signals gives reasonable\nestimate on the neutron-rich material ejected during the neutron star mergers.\nUsually the accretion disk is more massive than the macronova ejecta, with\nwhich the efficiencies of converting the disk mass into prompt emission of\nthree merger-driven GRBs can hence be directly constrained. Supposing the\nmacronovae/kilonovae associated with GRB 050709, GRB 060614 and GRB 130603B\narose from radioactive decay of the r-process material, the upper limit on\nenergy conversion efficiencies are found to be as low as $\\sim\n10^{-6}-10^{-4}$. Moreover, for all three events, neutrino annihilation is\nlikely powerful enough to account for the brief gamma-ray flashes. Neutrino\nannihilation can also explain the \"extended\" emission lasting $\\sim 100$ s in\nGRB 050709, but does not work for the one in GRB 060614. These progresses\ndemonstrate that the macronova can serve as a novel probe of the central engine\nactivity.\n", "  Isolated HI clouds with no optical counterparts are often taken as evidence\nfor galaxy-galaxy interactions, though an alternative hypothesis is that these\nare primordial 'dark galaxies' which have not formed stars. Similarly, certain\nkinematic features in HI streams are also controversial, sometimes taken as\nevidence of dark galaxies but also perhaps explicable as the result of\nharassment. We numerically model the passage of a galaxy through the\ngravitational field of cluster. The galaxy consists of SPH particles for the\ngas and n-bodies for the stars and dark matter, while the cluster includes the\ngravitational effects of substructure using 400 subhalos (the effects of the\nintracluster medium are ignored). We find that harassment can indeed produce\nlong HI streams and these streams can include kinematic features resembling\ndark galaxy candidates such as VIRGOHI21. We also show that apparent clouds\nwith diameter < 20 kpc and velocity widths < 50 km/s are almost invariably\nproduced in these simulations, making tidal debris a highly probable\nexplanation. In contrast, we show that the frequency of isolated clouds of the\nsame size but velocity width > 100 km/s is negligible - making this a very\nunlikely explanation for the observed clouds in the Virgo cluster with these\nproperties.\n", "  The flyby anomaly is the unexpected variation of the asymptotic\npost-encounter velocity of a spacecraft with respect to the pre-encounter\nvelocity as it performs a slingshot manoeuvre. This effect has been detected\nin, at least, six flybys of the Earth but it has not appeared in other recent\nflybys. In order to find a pattern in these, apparently contradictory, data\nseveral phenomenological formulas have been proposed but all have failed to\npredict a new result in agreement with the observations. In this paper we use a\nmultivariate dimensional analysis approach to propose a fitting of the data in\nterms of the local parameters at perigee, as it would occur if this anomaly\ncomes from an unknown fifth force with latitude dependence. Under this\nassumption, we estimate the range of this force around 300 km.\n", "  Channelled fragmented downflows are ubiquitous in magnetized atmospheres, and\nhave been recently addressed from an observation after a solar eruption. We\nstudy the possible back-effect of the magnetic field on the propagation of\nconfined flows. We compare two 3D MHD simulations of dense supersonic plasma\nblobs downfalling along a coronal magnetic flux tube. In one, the blobs move\nstrictly along the field lines; in the other, the initial velocity of the blobs\nis not perfectly aligned to the magnetic field and the field is weaker. The\naligned blobs remain compact while flowing along the tube, with the generated\nshocks. The misaligned blobs are disrupted and merged by the chaotic shuffling\nof the field lines, and structured into thinner filaments; Alfven wave fronts\nare generated together with shocks ahead of the dense moving front. Downflowing\nplasma fragments can be chaotically and efficiently mixed if their motion is\nmisaligned to field lines, with broad implications, e.g., disk accretion in\nprotostars, coronal eruptions and rain.\n", "  The radio galaxy IC310 located in the Perseus Cluster is one of the brightest\nobjects in the radio and X-ray bands, and one of the closest active galactic\nnuclei observed in very-high energies. In GeV - TeV $\\gamma$-rays, IC310 was\ndetected in low and high flux states by the MAGIC telescopes from October 2009\nto February 2010. Taking into account that the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) up to a few GeV seems to exhibit a double-peak feature and that a\nsingle-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model can explain all of the\nmultiwavelength emission except for the non-simultaneous MAGIC emission, we\ninterpret, in this work, the multifrequency data set of the radio galaxy IC310\nin the context of homogeneous hadronic and leptonic models. In the leptonic\nframework, we present a multi-zone SSC model with two electron populations to\nexplain the whole SED whereas for the hadronic model, we propose that a\nsingle-zone SSC model describes the SED up to a few GeVs and neutral pion decay\nproducts resulting from p$\\gamma$ interactions could describe the TeV - GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra. These interactions occur when Fermi-accelerated protons\ninteract with the seed photons around the SSC peaks. We show that, in the\nleptonic model the minimum Lorentz factor of second electron population is\nexceedingly high $\\gamma_e\\sim10^5$ disfavoring this model, and in the hadronic\nmodel the required proton luminosity is not extremely high $\\sim 10^{44}$\nerg/s, provided that charge neutrality between the number of electrons and\nprotons is given. Correlating the TeV $\\gamma$-ray and neutrino spectra through\nphoto-hadronic interactions, we find that the contribution of the emitting\nregion of IC310 to the observed neutrino and ultra-high-energy cosmic ray\nfluxes are negligible.\n", "  Recent studies have shown that SDSS galaxies with clockwise patterns are\nphotometrically different from galaxies with anti-clockwise patterns. The\npurpose of this study is to identify possible differences between the colour of\ngalaxies with clockwise handedness and the colour of galaxies with\nanti-clockwise handedness. A dataset of 162,514 SDSS galaxies was separated\ninto clockwise and counterclockwise galaxies, and the colours of spiral\ngalaxies with clockwise handedness were compared to the colour of spiral\ngalaxies with anti-clockwise handedness. The results show that the i-r colour\nin clockwise galaxies in SDSS is significantly higher compared to\nanti-clockwise SDSS galaxies. The colour difference is strongest between the\nright ascension of 30$^o$ and 60$^o$, while the RA range of 180$^o$ to 210$^o$\nshows a much smaller difference.\n", "  We present a study of the star formation and AGN activity for galaxies in the\nAbell 901/2 multi-cluster system at z~0.167 as part of the OMEGA survey. Using\nTuneable Filter data obtained with the OSIRIS instrument at the GTC we produce\nspectra covering the Halpha and [N II] spectral lines for more than 400\ngalaxies. Using optical emission-line diagnostics, we identify a significant\nnumber of galaxies hosting AGN, which tend to have high masses and a broad\nrange of morphologies. Moreover, within the environmental densities probed by\nour study, we find no environmental dependence on the fraction of galaxies\nhosting AGN. The analysis of the integrated Halpha emission shows that the\nspecific star formation rates (SSFRs) of a majority of the cluster galaxies are\nbelow the field values for a given stellar mass. We interpret this result as\nevidence for a slow decrease in the star formation activity of star-forming\ngalaxies as they fall into higher-density regions, contrary to some previous\nstudies which suggested a rapid truncation of star formation. We find that most\nof the intermediate- and high-mass spiral galaxies go through a phase in which\ntheir star formation is suppressed but still retain significant star-formation\nactivity. During this phase, these galaxies tend to retain their spiral\nmorphology while their colours become redder. The presence of this type of\ngalaxies in high density regions indicates that the physical mechanism\nresponsible for suppressing star-formation affects mainly the gas component of\nthe galaxies, suggesting that ram-pressure stripping or starvation are\npotentially responsible.\n", "  Context. The zebra patterns observed in solar radio emission are very\nimportant for are plasma diagnostics. The most promising model of these\npatterns is based on double plasma resonance instability, which generates\nupper-hybrid waves, which can be then transformed into the zebra emission.\nAims. We aim to study in detail the double plasma resonance instability of hot\nelectrons, together with a much denser thermal background plasma. In\nparticular, we analyse how the growth rate of the instability depends on the\ntemperature of both the hot plasma and background plasma components. Methods.\nWe numerically integrated the analysed model equations, using Python and\nWolfram Mathematica. Results. We found that the growth-rate maxima of the\nupper-hybrid waves for non-zero temperatures of both the hot and background\nplasma are shifted towards lower frequencies comparing to the zero temperature\ncase. This shift increases with an increase of the harmonic number s of the\nelectron cyclotron frequency and temperatures of both hot and background plasma\ncomponents. We show how this shift changes values of the magnetic eld strength\nestimated from observed zebras. We confirmed that for a relatively low hot\nelectron temperature, the dependence of growth rate vs. both the ratio of the\nelectron plasma and electron cyclotron frequencies expresse distinct peaks, and\nby increasing this temperature these peaks become smoothed. We found that in\nsome cases, the values of wave number vector components for the upper-hybrid\nwave for the maximal growth rate strongly deviate from their analytical\nestimations. We confirmed the validity of the assumptions used when deriving\nmodel equations.\n", "  Galaxies in the local Universe are known to follow bimodal distributions in\nthe global stellar populations properties. We analyze the distribution of the\nlocal average stellar-population ages of 654,053 sub-galactic regions resolved\non ~1-kpc scales in a volume-corrected sample of 394 galaxies, drawn from the\nCALIFA-DR3 integral-field-spectroscopy survey and complemented by SDSS imaging.\nWe find a bimodal local-age distribution, with an old and a young peak\nprimarily due to regions in early-type galaxies and star-forming regions of\nspirals, respectively. Within spiral galaxies, the older ages of bulges and\ninter-arm regions relative to spiral arms support an internal age bimodality.\nAlthough regions of higher stellar-mass surface-density, mu*, are typically\nolder, mu* alone does not determine the stellar population age and a bimodal\ndistribution is found at any fixed mu*. We identify an \"old ridge\" of regions\nof age ~9 Gyr, independent of mu*, and a \"young sequence\" of regions with age\nincreasing with mu* from 1-1.5 Gyr to 4-5 Gyr. We interpret the former as\nregions containing only old stars, and the latter as regions where the relative\ncontamination of old stellar populations by young stars decreases as mu*\nincreases. The reason why this bimodal age distribution is not inconsistent\nwith the unimodal shape of the cosmic-averaged star-formation history is that\ni) the dominating contribution by young stars biases the age low with respect\nto the average epoch of star formation, and ii) the use of a single average age\nper region is unable to represent the full time-extent of the star-formation\nhistory of \"young-sequence\" regions.\n", "  Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are characterized by their low effective\ntemperatures and high X-ray luminosities. The soft X-ray emission can be\nexplained by hydrogen nuclear burning on the surface of a white dwarf (WD)\naccreting at an extremely high rate. A peculiar 67 s periodicity (P67) was\npreviously discovered in the XMM-Newton light curves of the SSS CAL 83. P67 was\ndetected in X-ray light curves spanning 9 years, but exhibits variability of\nseveral seconds on time-scales as short as a few hours, and its properties are\nremarkably similar to those of dwarf nova oscillations (DNOs). DNOs are short\ntime-scale modulations often observed in dwarf novae during outburst. DNOs are\nexplained by the well established low-inertia mag- netic accretor (LIMA) model.\nIn this paper, we show that P67 and its associated period variability can be\nsatisfactorily explained by an application of the LIMA model to the more\nextreme environment in a SSS (eLIMA), contrary to another recent study at-\ntempting to explain P67 and its associated variability in terms of non-radial\ng-mode oscillations in the extended envelope of the rapidly accreting white\ndwarf in CAL 83. In the eLIMA model, P67 originates in an equatorial belt in\nthe WD envelope at the boundary with the inner accretion disc, with the belt\nweakly coupled to the WD core by a 100 000 G magnetic field. New optical light\ncurves obtained with the Sutherland High-speed Optical Camera (SHOC) are also\npresented, exhibiting quasi-periodic modulations on time-scales of 1000 s,\ncompatible with the eLIMA framework.\n", "  It is well-known that light bridges inside a sunspot produce small-scale\nplasma ejections and transient brightenings in the chromosphere, but the nature\nand origin of such phenomena are still unclear. Utilizing the high-spatial and\nhigh temporal resolution spectral data taken with the Fast Imaging Solar\nSpectrograph and the TiO 7057 A broadband filter images installed at the 1.6\nmeter New Solar Telescope of Big Bear Solar Observatory, we report\narcsecond-scale chromospheric plasma ejections (1.7 arc) inside a light bridge.\nInterestingly, the ejections are found to be a manifestation of upwardly\npropagating shock waves as evidenced by the sawtooth patterns seen in the\ntemporal-spectral plots of the Ca II 8542 A and H-alpha intensities. We also\nfound a fine-scale photospheric pattern (1 arc) diverging with a speed of about\n2 km/s two minutes before the plasma ejections, which seems to be a\nmanifestation of magnetic flux emergence. As a response to the plasma\nejections, the corona displayed small-scale transient brightenings. Based on\nour findings, we suggest that the shock waves can be excited by the local\ndisturbance caused by magnetic reconnection between the emerging flux inside\nthe light bridge and the adjacent umbral magnetic field. The disturbance\ngenerates slow-mode waves, which soon develop into shock waves, and manifest\nthemselves as the arcsecond-scale plasma ejections. It also appears that the\ndissipation of mechanical energy in the shock waves can heat the local corona.\n", "  We construct a model for the Galactic globular cluster system based on a\nrealistic gravitational potential and a distribution function (DF) analytic in\nthe action integrals. The DF comprises disc and halo components whose\nfunctional forms resemble those recently used to describe the stellar discs and\nstellar halo. We determine the posterior distribution of our model parameters\nusing a Bayesian approach. This gives us an understanding of how well the\nglobular cluster data constrain our model. The favoured parameter values of the\ndisc and halo DFs are similar to values previously obtained from fits to the\nstellar disc and halo, although the cluster halo system shows clearer rotation\nthan does the stellar halo. Our model reproduces the generic features of the\nglobular cluster system, namely the density profile, the mean rotation\nvelocity. The fraction of disc clusters coincides with the observed fraction of\nmetal-rich clusters. However, the data indicate either incompatibility between\ncatalogued cluster distances and current estimates of distance to the Galactic\nCentre, or failure to identify clusters behind the bulge. As the data for our\nGalaxy's components increase in volume and precision over the next few years,\nit will be rewarding to revisit the present analysis.\n", "  The incidence of broad absorption lines (BALs) in quasar samples is often\ninterpreted in the context of a geometric unification model consisting of an\naccretion disc and an associated outflow. We use the the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) quasar sample to test this model by examining the equivalent\nwidths (EWs) of CIV 1550\\AA, Mg II 2800\\AA, [OIII] 5007\\AA\\ and C III] 1909\\AA.\nWe find that the emission line EW distributions in BAL and non-BAL quasars are\nremarkably similar -- a property that is inconsistent with scenarios in which a\nBAL outflow rises equatorially from a geometrically thin, optically thick\naccretion disc. We construct simple models to predict the distributions from\nvarious geometries; these models confirm the above finding and disfavour\nequatorial geometries. We show that obscuration, line anisotropy and general\nrelativistic effects on the disc continuum are unlikely to hide an EW\ninclination dependence. We carefully examine the radio and polarisation\nproperties of BAL quasars. Both suggest that they are most likely viewed (on\naverage) from intermediate inclinations, between type 1 and type 2 AGN. We also\nfind that the low-ionization BAL quasars in our sample are not confined to one\nregion of `Eigenvector I' parameter space. Overall, our work leads to one of\nthe following conclusions, or some combination thereof: (i) the continuum does\nnot emit like a geometrically thin, optically thick disc; (ii) BAL quasars are\nviewed from similar angles to non-BAL quasars, i.e. low inclinations; (iii)\ngeometric unification does not explain the fraction of BALs in quasar samples.\n", "  In order to obtain high precision CCD positions of Himalia, the sixth Jovian\nsatellite, a total of 598 CCD observations have been obtained during the years\n2015-2016. The observations were made by using the 2.4 m and 1 m telescopes\nadministered by Yunnan Observatories over 27 nights. Several factors which\nwould influence the positional precision of Himalia were analyzed, including\nthe reference star catalogue used, the geometric distortion and the phase\neffect. By taking advantage of its unprecedented positional precision, the\nrecently released catalogue Gaia DR1 was chosen to match reference stars in the\nCCD frames of both Himalia and open clusters which were observed for deriving\nthe geometric distortion. The latest version of SOFA library was used to\ncalculate the positions of reference stars. The theoretical positions of\nHimalia were retrieved from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Horizons System which\nincludes the satellite ephemeris JUP300, while the positions of Jupiter were\nbased on the planetary ephemeris DE431. Our results showed that the means of\nobserved minus computed (O-C) residuals are 0.071 and -0.001 arcsec in right\nascension and declination, respectively. Their standard deviations are\nestimated at about 0.03 arcsec in each direction.\n", "  MWC 656 is the first known Be/black hole (BH) binary system. Be/BH binaries\nare important in the context of binary system evolution and sources of\ndetectable gravitational waves because they are possible precursors of\ncoalescing neutron star/BH binaries. X-ray observations conducted in 2013\nrevealed that MWC 656 is a quiescent high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB), opening the\npossibility to explore X-ray/radio correlations and the accretion/ejection\ncoupling down to low luminosities for BH HMXBs. Here we report on a deep joint\nChandra/VLA observation of MWC 656 (and contemporaneous optical data) conducted\nin 2015 July that has allowed us to unambiguously identify the X-ray\ncounterpart of the source. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted with a power law\nwith $\\Gamma\\sim2$, providing a flux of $\\simeq4\\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-8 keV energy range and a luminosity of $L_{\\rm\nX}\\simeq3\\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at a 2.6 kpc distance. For a 5 M$_\\odot$\nBH this translates into $\\simeq5\\times10^{-9}$ $L_{\\rm Edd}$. These results\nimply that MWC 656 is about 7 times fainter in X-rays than it was two years\nbefore and reaches the faintest X-ray luminosities ever detected in\nstellar-mass BHs. The radio data provide a detection with a peak flux density\nof $3.5\\pm1.1$ $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The obtained X-ray/radio luminosities for\nthis quiescent BH HMXB are fully compatible with those of the X-ray/radio\ncorrelations derived from quiescent BH low-mass X-ray binaries. These results\nshow that the accretion/ejection coupling in stellar-mass BHs is independent of\nthe nature of the donor star.\n", "  We present the results of the spectroscopic and photometric follow-up of two\nfield galaxies that were selected as possible stellar counterparts of local\nhigh velocity clouds. Our analysis shows that the two systems are distant (D>20\nMpc) dwarf irregular galaxies unrelated to the local HI clouds. However, the\nnewly derived distance and structural parameters reveal that the two galaxies\nhave luminosities and effective radii very similar to the recently identified\nUltra Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs). At odds with classical UDGs, they are remarkably\nisolated, having no known giant galaxy within ~2.0 Mpc. Moreover, one of them\nhas a very high gas content compared to galaxies of similar stellar mass, with\na HI to stellar mass ratio M_HI/M_* ~90, typical of almost-dark dwarfs.\nExpanding on this finding, we show that extended dwarf irregulars overlap the\ndistribution of UDGs in the M_V vs. log(r_e) plane and that the sequence\nincluding dwarf spheroidals, dwarf irregulars and UDGs appears as continuously\npopulated in this plane.\n", "  We examine the dependence of the fraction of galaxies containing pseudo\nbulges on environment for a flux limited sample of $\\sim$5000 SDSS galaxies. We\nhave separated bulges into classical and pseudo bulge categories based on their\nposition on the Kormendy diagram. Pseudo bulges are thought to be formed by\ninternal processes and are a result of secular evolution in galaxies. We\nattempt to understand the dependence of secular evolution on environment and\nmorphology. Dividing our sample of disc+bulge galaxies based on group\nmembership into three categories: central and satellite galaxies in groups and\nisolated field galaxies, we find that pseudo bulge fraction is almost equal for\nsatellite and field galaxies. Fraction of pseudo bulge hosts in central\ngalaxies is almost half of the fraction of pseudo bulges in satellite and field\ngalaxies. This trend is also valid when only galaxies are considered only\nspirals or S0. Using the projected fifth nearest neighbour density as measure\nof local environment, we look for the dependence of pseudo bulge fraction on\nenvironmental density. Satellite and field galaxies show very weak or no\ndependence of pseudo bulge fraction on environment. However, fraction of pseudo\nbulges hosted by central galaxies decreases with increase in local\nenvironmental density. We do not find any dependence of pseudo bulge luminosity\non environment. Our results suggest that the processes that differentiate the\nbulge types are a function of environment while processes responsible for the\nformation of pseudo bulges seem to be independent of environment.\n", "  White dwarfs with metal lines in their spectra act as signposts for post-main\nsequence planetary systems. Searching the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data\nrelease 12, we have identified 231 cool (<9000 K) DZ white dwarfs with strong\nmetal absorption, extending the DZ cooling sequence to both higher metal\nabundances, lower temperatures, and hence longer cooler ages. Of these 231\nsystems, 104 are previously unknown white dwarfs. Compared with previous work,\nour spectral fitting uses improved model atmospheres with updated line profiles\nand line-lists, which we use to derive effective temperatures and abundances\nfor up to 8 elements. We also determine spectroscopic distances to our sample,\nidentifying two halo-members with tangential space-velocities >300 kms-1. The\nimplications of our results on remnant planetary systems are to be discussed in\na separate paper.\n", "  We report on the determination of chemical abundances of 38 solar analogues,\nincluding 11 objects previously identified as super metal-rich stars. We have\nmeasured the equivalent widths for 34 lines of 7 different chemical elements\n(Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni) in high-resolution ($\\mathcal{R} \\sim\n80\\,000$) spectroscopic images, obtained at the Observatorio Astrof\\'isico\nGuillermo Haro (Sonora, Mexico), with the Cananea High-resolution Spectrograph.\nWe derived chemical abundances using ATLAS12 model atmospheres and the Fortran\ncode MOOG. We confirmed the super metallicity status of 6 solar analogues.\nWithin our sample, BD+60 600 is the most metal-rich star ([Fe/H]=+0.35 dex),\nwhile for HD 166991 we obtained the lowest iron abundance ([Fe/H]=$-0.53$ dex).\nWe also computed the so-called [Ref] index for 25 of our solar analogues, and\nwe found, that BD+60 600 ([Ref]=+0.42) and BD+28 3198 ([Ref]=+0.34) are good\ntargets for exoplanet search.\n", "  The degradation of spatial resolution in star-forming regions observed at\nlarge distances ($d\\gtrsim1$ kpc) with Herschel,can lead to estimates of the\nphysical parameters of the detected compact sources (clumps) which do not\nnecessarily mirror the properties of the original population of cores. This\npaper aims at quantifying the bias introduced in the estimation of these\nparameters by the distance effect. To do so, we consider Herschel maps of\nnearby star-forming regions taken from the Herschel-Gould-Belt survey, and\nsimulate the effect of increased distance to understand what amount of\ninformation is lost when a distant star-forming region is observed with\nHerschel resolution. In the maps displaced to different distances we extract\ncompact sources, and we derive their physical parameters as if they were\noriginal Hi-GAL maps of the extracted source samples. In this way, we are able\nto discuss how the main physical properties change with distance. In\nparticular, we discuss the ability of clumps to form massive stars: we estimate\nthe fraction of distant sources that are classified as high-mass stars-forming\nobjects due to their position in the mass vs radius diagram, that are only\n\"false positives\". We give also a threshold for high-mass star-formation\n$M>1282 \\ \\left(\\frac{r}{[\\mathrm{pc}]}\\right)^{1.42} M_{\\odot}$. In\nconclusion, this paper provides the astronomer dealing with Herschel maps of\ndistant star-forming regions with a set of prescriptions to partially recover\nthe character of the core population in unresolved clumps.\n", "  We present a VLT/MUSE survey of lensed high-redshift galaxies behind the\nz=0.77 cluster RCS0224-0002. We study the detailed internal properties of a\nhighly magnified ({\\mu}~29) z=4.88 galaxy seen through the cluster. We detect\nwide-spread nebular CIV{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1548,1551{\\AA} emission from this\ngalaxy as well as a bright Ly{\\alpha} halo with a spatially-uniform wind and\nabsorption profile across 12 kpc in the image plane. Blueshifted high- and\nlow-ionisation interstellar absorption indicate the presence of a high-velocity\noutflow ({\\Delta}v~300 km/s) from the galaxy. Unlike similar observations of\ngalaxies at z=2-3, the Ly{\\alpha} emission from the halo emerges close to the\nsystemic velocity - an order of magnitude lower in velocity offset than\npredicted in \"shell\"-like outflow models. To explain these observations we\nfavour a model of an outflow with a strong velocity gradient, which changes the\neffective column density seen by the Ly{\\alpha} photons. We also search for\nhigh-redshift Ly{\\alpha} emitters and identify 14 candidates between z=4.8-6.6,\nincluding an over-density at z=4.88, of which only one has a detected\ncounterpart in HST/ACS+WFC3 imaging.\n", "  We study the consistency and convergence of smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH), as a function of the interpolation parameters, namely the number of\nparticles $N$, the number of neighbors $n$, and the smoothing length $h$, using\nsimulations of the collapse and fragmentation of protostellar rotating cores.\nThe calculations are made using a modified version of the GADGET-2 code that\nemploys an improved scheme for the artificial viscosity and power-law\ndependences of $n$ and $h$ on $N$, as was recently proposed by Zhu et al.,\nwhich comply with the combined limit $N\\to\\infty$, $h\\to 0$, and $n\\to\\infty$\nwith $n/N\\to 0$ for full SPH consistency, as the domain resolution is\nincreased. We apply this realization to the \"standard isothermal test case\" in\nthe variant calculated by Burkert & Bodenheimer and the Gaussian cloud model of\nBoss to investigate the response of the method to adaptive smoothing lengths in\nthe presence of large density and pressure gradients. The degree of consistency\nis measured by tracking how well the estimates of the consistency integral\nrelations reproduce their continuous counterparts. In particular, $C^{0}$ and\n$C^{1}$ particle consistency is demonstrated, meaning that the calculations are\nclose to second-order accuracy. As long as $n$ is increased with $N$, mass\nresolution also improves as the minimum resolvable mass $M_{\\rm min}\\sim\nn^{-1}$. This aspect allows proper calculation of small-scale structures in the\nflow associated with the formation and instability of protostellar disks around\nthe growing fragments, which are seen to develop a spiral structure and\nfragment into close binary/multiple systems as supported by recent\nobservations.\n", "  In this paper, we study the backward problem of determining initial condition\nfor some class of nonlinear parabolic equations in multidimensional domain\nwhere data are given under random noise. This problem is ill-posed, i.e., the\nsolution does not depend continuously on the data. To regularize the instable\nsolution, we develop some new methods to construct some new regularized\nsolution. We also investigate the convergence rate between the regularized\nsolution and the solution of our equations. In particular, we establish results\nfor several equations with constant coefficients and time dependent\ncoefficients. The equations with constant coefficients include heat equation,\nextended Fisher-Kolmogorov equation, Swift-Hohenberg equation and many others.\nThe equations with time dependent coefficients include Fisher type Logistic\nequations, Huxley equation, Fitzhugh-Nagumo equation. The methods developed in\nthis paper can also be applied to get approximate solutions to several other\nequations including 1-D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, 1-D modified\nSwift-Hohenberg equation, strongly damped wave equation and 1-D Burger's\nequation with randomly perturbed operator.\n", "  We consider an anisotropic needle-like Brownian particle with nematic\nsymmetry confined in a $2D$ domain. For this system, the coupling of\ntranslational and rotational diffusion makes the process ${\\bf x} (t)$ of the\npositions of the particle non Markovian. Using scaling arguments, a Gaussian\napproximation and numerical methods, we determine the mean first passage time\n$\\langle\\mathbf{T}\\rangle$ of the particle to a target of radius $a$ and show\nin particular that $\\langle\\mathbf{T}\\rangle \\sim a^{-1/2}$ for $a\\to 0$, in\ncontrast with the classical logarithmic divergence obtained in the case of an\nisotropic $2D$ Brownian particle.\n", "  The Chandra X-ray observatory has discovered several dozen anomalously\nX-ray-bright jets associated with powerful quasars. A popular explanation for\nthe X-ray flux from the knots in these jets is that relativistic\nsynchrotron-emitting electrons inverse-Compton scatter Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) photons to X-ray energies (the IC/CMB model). This model\npredicts a high gamma-ray flux which should be detectable by the Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (LAT) for many sources. GeV-band upper limits from Fermi/LAT for\nthe well-known anomalous X-ray jet in PKS 0637-752 were previously shown in\nMeyer et al., (2015) to violate the predictions of the IC/CMB model.\nPreviously, measurements of the jet synchrotron spectrum, important for\naccurately predicting the gamma-ray flux level, were lacking between radio and\ninfrared wavelengths. Here we present new Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the large-scale jet at\n100, 233, and 319 GHz which further constrain the synchrotron spectrum,\nsupporting the previously published empirical model. We also present updated\nlimits from the Fermi/LAT using the new `Pass 8' calibration and approximately\n30% more time on source. With these deeper limits we rule out the IC/CMB model\nat the 8.7 sigma level. Finally, we demonstrate that complete knowledge of the\nsynchrotron SED is critical in evaluating the IC/CMB model.\n", "  We use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to show that an initially\nmildly misaligned circumbinary accretion disk around an eccentric binary can\nevolve to an orientation that is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the\nbinary (polar alignment). As the disk evolves to the perpendicular state, it\nundergoes nodal libration oscillations of the tilt angle and the longitude of\nthe ascending node. Dissipation within the disk causes the oscillations to\ndamp. The process operates above a critical initial misalignment angle that\ndepends upon the eccentricity of the binary and the mass of the disk. For\nbinary eccentricity of 0.5, the process operates typically for disk masses\nsmaller than a few percent of the binary mass and initial tilt angle of more\nthan 40 degrees. This evolution has important implications for planet formation\naround eccentric binary star systems.\n", "  The study of neutrinos in astrophysics requires the combination of different\nobservational probes. The temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave\nbackground induced via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect may\nprovide interesting information since they are expected to receive significant\ncontribution from high-redshift plasma. We present a set of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations that include a treatment of the neutrino component\nconsidering four different sum of neutrino masses: $\\Sigma\nm_\\nu=(0,0.15,0.3,0.6)$ eV. Using their outputs, we modelled the kSZ effect due\nto the large-scale structure after the reionization by producing mock maps,\nthen computed the kSZ power spectrum and studied how it depends on $z_{\\rm re}$\nand $\\Sigma m_\\nu$. We also run a set of four simulations to study and correct\npossible systematics due to resolution, finite box size and astrophysics. With\nmassless neutrinos we obtain $\\mathcal{D}^{\\rm kSZ}_{3000}=4.0$ $\\mu {\\rm K}^2$\n($z_{\\rm re}$=8.8), enough to account for all of the kSZ signal of\n$\\mathcal{D}^{\\rm kSZ}_{3000}=(2.9\\pm1.3)$ $\\mu {\\rm K}^2$ measured with the\nSouth Pole Telescope. This translates into an upper limit on the kSZ effect due\nto patchy reionization of $\\mathcal{D}^{\\rm kSZ,patchy}_{3000}<1.0$ $\\mu {\\rm\nK}^2$ (95 per cent confidence level). Massive neutrinos induce a damping of kSZ\neffect power of about 8, 12 and 40 per cent for $\\Sigma m_\\nu=(0.15,0.3,0.6)$\neV, respectively. We study the dependence of the kSZ signal with $z_{\\rm re}$\nand the neutrino mass fraction, $f_\\nu$, and obtain $\\mathcal{D}^{\\rm\nkSZ}_{3000}\\propto z_{\\rm re}^{0.26}(1-f_\\nu)^{14.3}$. Interestingly, the\nscaling with $f_\\nu$ is significantly shallower with respect to the equivalent\nthermal SZ effect, and may be used to break the degeneracy with other\ncosmological parameters.\n", "  Hubble Space Telescope (HST) fine guidance sensor observations were used to\nobtain parallaxes of eight metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.4) stars. The parallaxes of\nthese stars determined by the revised Hipparcos reduction average 17% accuracy,\nin contrast to our new HST parallaxes which average 1% accuracy and have errors\non the individual parallaxes ranging from 85 to 144 microarcsecond. This\nparallax data has been combined with HST ACS photometry in the F606W and F814W\nfilters to obtain the absolute magnitudes of the stars with an accuracy of 0.02\nto 0.03 magnitudes. Six of these stars are on the main sequence (with -2.7 <\n[Fe/H] < -1.8), and suitable for testing metal-poor stellar evolution models\nand determining the distances to metal-poor globular clusters. Using the\nabundances obtained by O'Malley et al. (2017) we find that standard stellar\nmodels using the Vandenberg & Clem (2003) color transformation do a reasonable\njob of matching five of the main sequence stars, with HD 54639 ([Fe/H] = -2.5)\nbeing anomalous in its location in the color-magnitude diagram. Stellar models\nand isochrones were generated using a Monte Carlo analysis to take into account\nuncertainties in the models. Isochrones which fit the parallax stars were used\nto determine the distances and ages of nine globular clusters (with -2.4 <=\n[Fe/H] <= -1.9$). Averaging together the age of all nine clusters, leads to an\nabsolute age of the oldest, most metal-poor globular clusters of 12.7+/- 1.0\nGyr, where the quoted uncertainty takes into account the known uncertainties in\nthe stellar models and isochrones, along with the uncertainty in the distance\nand reddening of the clusters.\n", "  The ability to control the size of the electronic bandgap is an integral part\nof solid-state technology. Atomically-thin two-dimensional crystals offer a new\napproach for tuning the energies of the electronic states based on the\ninterplay between the environmental sensitivity and unusual strength of the\nCoulomb interaction in these materials. By engineering the surrounding\ndielectric environment, we are able to tune the electronic bandgap in\nmonolayers of WS2 and WSe2 by hundreds of meV. We exploit this behavior to\npresent an in-plane dielectric heterostructure with a spatially dependent\nbandgap, illustrating the feasibility of our approach for the creation of\nlateral junctions with nanoscale resolution. This successful demonstration of\nbandgap engineering based on the non-invasive modification of the Coulomb\ninteraction should enable the design of a new class of atomically thin devices\nto advance the limits of size and functionality for solid-state technologies.\n", "  In their correspondence [arXiv:1610.07633] Drummond and Brand criticize our\nwork [Nature Physics 12, 451-454 (2016) http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys3631].\nWe show that their criticism is misleading and unfounded.\n", "  Wave theories of heating the chromosphere, corona, and solar wind due to\nphotospheric fluctuations are strengthened by the existence of observed wave\ncoherency up to the transition region (TR). The coherency of solar spicules'\nintensity oscillations was explored using the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on\nthe Hinode spacecraft with a height increase above the solar limb in active\nregion (AR). We used time sequences near the southeast region from the\nHinode/SOT in Ca II H line obtained on April 3, 2015 and applied the\nde-convolution procedure to the spicule in order to illustrate how effectively\nour restoration method works on fine structures such as spicules. Moreover, the\nintensity oscillations at different heights above the solar limb were analysed\nthrough wavelet transforms. Afterwards, the phase difference was measured among\noscillations at two certain heights in search of evidence for coherent\noscillations. The results of wavelet transformations revealed dominant period\npeaks in 2, 4, 5.5, and 6.5 min at four separate heights. The dominant\nfrequencies for coherency level higher than 75 percent was found to be around\n5.5 and 8.5 mHz. Mean phase speeds of 155-360 km s-1 were measured. We found\nthat the mean phase speeds increased with height. The results suggest that the\nenergy flux carried by coherent waves into the corona and heliosphere may be\nseveral times larger than previous estimates that were based solely on constant\nvelocities. We provide compelling evidence for the existence of upwardly\npropagating coherent waves.\n", "  We place a 2.5% limit on the anthropogenic contribution to the modern\nabundance of 81Kr/Kr in the atmosphere at the 90% confidence level. Due to its\nsimple production and transport in the terrestrial environment, 81Kr (halflife\n= 230,000 yr) is an ideal tracer for old water and ice with mean residence\ntimes in the range of 10^5-10^6 years. In recent years, 81Kr-dating has been\nmade available to the earth science community thanks to the development of Atom\nTrap Trace Analysis (ATTA), a laser-based atom counting technique. Further\nupgrades and improvements to the ATTA technique now allow us to demonstrate\n81Kr/Kr measurements with relative uncertainties of 1% and place this new limit\non anthropogenic 81Kr. As a result of this limit, we have removed a potential\nsystematic constraint for 81Kr-dating.\n", "  We present high resolution simulations of an isolated dwarf spheroidal (dSph)\ngalaxy between redshifts $z\\sim10$ and $z\\sim 4$, the epoch when several Milky\nWay dSph satellites experienced extended star formation, in order to understand\nin detail the physical processes which affect a low-mass halo's ability to\nretain gas. It is well-established that supernova feedback is very effective at\nexpelling gas from a $3\\times 10^7$M$_\\odot$ halo, the mass of a typical\nredshift 10 progenitor of a redshift 0 halo with mass $\\sim10^9$M$_\\odot$. We\ninvestigate the conditions under which such a halo is able to retain sufficient\nhigh-density gas to support extended star formation. In particular, we explore\nthe effects of: an increased relative concentration of the gas compared to the\ndark matter; a higher concentration dark matter halo; significantly lower\nsupernova rates; enhanced metal cooling due to enrichment from earlier\nsupernovae. We show that disk-like gas distributions retain more gas than\nspherical ones, primarily due to the shorter gas cooling times in the disk.\nHowever, a significant reduction in the number of supernovae compared to that\nexpected for a standard initial mass function is still needed to allow the\nretention of high density gas. We conclude that the progenitors of the observed\ndSphs would only have retained the gas required to sustain star formation if\ntheir mass, concentration and gas morphology were already unusual for those of\na dSph-mass halo progenitor by a redshift of 10.\n", "  We present the Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux power spectrum measurements of the XQ-100\nsample of quasar spectra obtained in the context of the European Southern\nObservatory Large Programme \"Quasars and their absorption lines: a legacy\nsurvey of the high redshift universe with VLT/XSHOOTER\". Using $100$ quasar\nspectra with medium resolution and signal-to-noise ratio we measure the power\nspectrum over a range of redshifts $z = 3 - 4.2$ and over a range of scales $k\n= 0.003 - 0.06\\,\\mathrm{s\\,km^{-1}}$. The results agree well with the\nmeasurements of the one-dimensional power spectrum found in the literature. The\ndata analysis used in this paper is based on the Fourier transform and has been\ntested on synthetic data. Systematic and statistical uncertainties of our\nmeasurements are estimated, with a total error (statistical and systematic)\ncomparable to the one of the BOSS data in the overlapping range of scales, and\nsmaller by more than $50\\%$ for higher redshift bins ($z>3.6$) and small scales\n($k > 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s\\,km^{-1}}$). The XQ-100 data set has the unique feature\nof having signal-to-noise ratios and resolution intermediate between the two\ndata sets that are typically used to perform cosmological studies, i.e. BOSS\nand high-resolution spectra (e.g. UVES/VLT or HIRES). More importantly, the\nmeasured flux power spectra span the high redshift regime which is usually more\nconstraining for structure formation models.\n", "  PHAST is a software package written in standard Fortran, with MPI and CUDA\nextensions, able to efficiently perform parallel multicanonical Monte Carlo\nsimulations of single or multiple heteropolymeric chains, as coarse-grained\nmodels for proteins. The outcome data can be straightforwardly analyzed within\nits microcanonical Statistical Thermodynamics module, which allows for\ncomputing the entropy, caloric curve, specific heat and free energies. As a\ncase study, we investigate the aggregation of heteropolymers bioinspired on\n$A\\beta_{25-33}$ fragments and their cross-seeding with $IAPP_{20-29}$\nisoforms. Excellent parallel scaling is observed, even under numerically\ndifficult first-order like phase transitions, which are properly described by\nthe built-in fully reconfigurable force fields. Still, the package is free and\nopen source, this shall motivate users to readily adapt it to specific\npurposes.\n", "  Some modal (or decoupled) transmission-line properties such as\nper-unit-length impedance, admittance, or characteristic impedance have long\nbeen held to be, in general, non-unique. This ambiguity arises from the nature\nof the similarity transformations used to relate the terminal and modal\ndomains, for which the voltage transformation matrix has been shown to be only\nloosely related to the corresponding current transformation matrix. Modern\nmethods have attempted to relate the two, but these relations typically rely on\narbitrary normalizations, leading to strictly incorrect and/or non-unique\nresults. This work introduces relations between the two transformations,\nderived from the physical equivalence of total power and currents between the\ntwo domains, by which the transformation matrices can be unambiguously related\nto each other, and the modal properties uniquely solved. This technique allows\nfor the correct extraction of the modal transmission-line properties for any\narbitrary system of conductors. Multiple examples are studied to validate the\nproposed solution process.\n", "  We compare the predicted conditional mass function (CMF) of dark matter halos\nfrom two theoretical prescriptions against numerical N-body simulations, both\nin overdense and underdense regions and at different Eulerian scales ranging\nfrom $5$ to $30\\,h^{-1}\\,$Mpc. In particular, we consider in detail a\nlocally-implemented rescaling of the unconditional mass function (UMF) already\ndiscussed in the literature, and also a generalization of the standard\nrescaling method described in the extended Press-Schechter formalism. First, we\ntest the consistency of these two rescalings by verifying the normalization of\nthe CMF at different scales, and showing that none of the proposed cases\nprovides a normalized CMF. In order to satisfy the normalization condition, we\ninclude a modification in the rescaling procedure. After this modification, the\nresulting CMF generally provides a better description of numerical results. We\nfinally present an analytical fit to the ratio between the CMF and the UMF\n(also known as the matter-to-halo bias function) in underdense regions, which\ncould be of special interest to speed-up the computation of the halo abundance\nwhen studying void statistics. In this case, the CMF prescription based on the\nlocally-implemented rescaling provides a slightly better description of the\nnumerical results when compared to the standard rescaling.\n", "  We simulate decaying turbulence in a homogeneous pair plasma using three\ndimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) method. A uniform background\nmagnetic field permeates the plasma such that the magnetic pressure is three\ntimes larger than the thermal pressure and the turbulence is generated by\ncounter-propagating shear Alfv\\'en waves. The energy predominately cascades\ntransverse to the background magnetic field, rendering the turbulence\nanisotropic at smaller scales. We simultaneously move several ion species of\nvarying charge to mass ratios in our simulation and show that the particles of\nsmaller charge to mass ratios are heated and accelerated to non-thermal\nenergies at a faster rate, in accordance with the enhancement of heavy ions and\nnon-thermal tail in their energy spectrum observed in the impulsive solar\nflares. We further show that the heavy ions are energized mostly in the\ndirection perpendicular to the background magnetic field with a rate consistent\nwith our analytical estimate of the rate of heating due to cyclotron resonance\nwith the Alfv\\'en waves of which a large fraction is due to obliquely\npropagating waves.\n", "  We have measured the total kinetic energy release (TKE), its variance and\nassociated fission product distributions for the neutron induced fission of\n232Th and 235U for En = 2 - 90 MeV. The neutron energies were determined on an\nevent by event basis by time of flight measurements with the white spectrum\nneutron beam from LANSCE. The TKE decreases non-linearly with increasing\nneutron energy for both systems, while the TKE variances are sensitive\nindicators of nth chance fission. The associated fission product distributions\nshow the decrease in TKE with increasing beam energy that is due to the\nincreasing probability of symmetric fission, which has a lower associated TKE,\nand the decreasing TKE associated with asymmetric fission, presumably due to\nthe decreasing importance of the A = 132 shell structures.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium phase transitions in the one-dimensional duplet\ncreation model using the $n-$site approximation scheme. We find the phase\ndiagram in the space of parameters $(\\gamma,D)$, where $\\gamma$ is the particle\ndecay probability and $D$ is the diffusion probability. Through data $(1\\leq n\n\\leq 18)$ we show that in the limit $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ the model presents a\ncontinuous transition of active state for inactive state (absorbing state) for\nany value of $0\\leq D \\leq1$. In general, we obtain the critical value of\n$\\gamma$ and the \"gap\" density in the transition point for single and pair\napproximation $\\gamma_c(n=1,D)$, $\\Delta\\rho(n=1,D)$ and $\\Delta \\rho(n=2,D)$\nrespectively.\n", "  We performed highly resolved one-dimensional fully compressible Navier-Stokes\nsimulations of heat-release-induced compression waves in near-critical CO2. The\ncomputational setup, inspired by the experimental setup of Miura et al., Phys.\nRev. E, 2006, is composed of a closed inviscid (one-dimensional) duct with\nadiabatic hard ends filled with CO2 at three supercritical pressures. The\ncorresponding initial temperature values are taken along the pseudo-boiling\nline. Thermodynamic and transport properties of CO2 in near-critical conditions\nare modeled via the Peng-Robinson equation of state and Chung's Method. A heat\nsource is applied at a distance from one end, with heat release intensities\nspanning the range 10^3-10^11 W/m^2, generating isentropic compression waves\nfor values < 10^9 W/m^2. For higher heat-release rates such compressions are\ncoalescent with distinct shock-like features (e.g. non-isentropicity and\npropagation Mach numbers measurably greater than unity) and a non-uniform\npost-shock state is present due to the strong thermodynamic nonlinearities. The\nresulting compression wave intensities have been collapsed via the thermal\nexpansion coefficient, highly variable in near-critical fluids, used as one of\nthe scaling parameters for the reference energy. The proposed scaling applies\nto isentropic thermoacoustic waves as well as shock waves up to shock strength\n2. Long-term time integration reveals resonance behavior of the compression\nwaves, raising the mean pressure and temperature at every resonance cycle. When\nthe heat injection is halted, expansion waves are generated, which counteract\nthe compression waves leaving conduction as the only thermal relaxation\nprocess. In the long term evolution, the decay in amplitude of the resonating\nwaves observed in the experiments is qualitatively reproduced by using\nisothermal boundary conditions.\n", "  For the $S$ states of two-electron atoms, we introduce an exact and unique\nfactorization of the internal eigenfunction in terms of a marginal amplitude,\nwhich depends functionally on the electron-nucleus distances $r_1$ and $r_2$,\nand a conditional amplitude, which depends functionally on the interelectronic\ndistance $r_{12}$ and parametrically on $r_1$ and $r_2$. Applying the\nvariational principle, we derive pseudoeigenvalue equations for these two\namplitudes, which cast the internal Schr\\\"odinger equation in a form akin to\nthe Born-Oppenheimer separation of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in\nmolecules. The marginal equation involves an effective radial Hamiltonian,\nwhich contains a nonadiabatic potential energy surface that takes into account\nall interparticle correlations in an averaged way, and whose unique eigenvalue\nis the internal energy. At each point $(r_1,r_2)$, such surface is, in turn,\nthe unique eigenvalue in the conditional equation. Employing the ground state\nof He as prototype, we show that the nonadiabatic potential energy surface\naffords a molecularlike interpretation of the structure of the atom, and aids\nin the analysis of energetic and spatial aspects of the Coulomb correlation, in\nparticular correlation-induced symmetry breaking and quantum phase transition.\n", "  Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and chiral objects in condensed matter are\noften excited states protected by system's topology. The use of chiral\ntopological excitations to carry information has been demonstrated, where the\ninformation is robust against external perturbations. For instance, reading,\nwriting, and transfer of binary information are demonstrated with chiral\ntopological excitations in magnetic systems, skyrmions, for spintronic devices.\nHowever, the next step, the logic or algebraic operation of such topological\nbits has not been realized yet. Here, we show experimentally the switching\nbetween solitons of different chirality in a one-dimensional electronic system\nwith $Z_4$ topological symmetry. We found that a fast-moving achiral soliton\nmerges with chiral solitons to switch their handedness. This corresponds to the\nrealization of algebraic operation of $Z_4$ topological numbers. Chiral\nsolitons could be exploited for storage and operation of robust topological\nmulti-digit information.\n", "  In this article, a model of a material particle in chaotic motion (while\nmaintaining a definite size and trajectory) is presented. On the basis of this\nmodel, the following is achieved: --to express Planck's constant through the\nmain features of a stationary random process; --to justify the transition from\nthe coordinate representation of the state of the particle to its momentum\nrepresentation without invoking either the principles of de Broglie waves or\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle. --to derive a form of the Schroedinger\nequation on the basis of the principle of extremum of the mean of the action of\na particle in chaotic motion. The domain of the resulting equation is of course\ndetermined by its manner of derivation; we highlight the limits of the derived\nequation. An intermediate result, the determination of the density of the\nprobability distribution of the nth derivative of an nth-order differentiable,\nrandom, stationary process can be applied in many areas of probability theory\nand statistical physics.\n", "  Ultrafast electron pulses, combined with laser-pump and electron-probe\ntechnologies, allow for various forms of ultrafast microscopy and spectroscopy\nto elucidate otherwise challenging to observe physical and chemical\ntransitions. However, the pursuit of simultaneous ultimate spatial and temporal\nresolution has been largely subdued by the low monochromaticity of the electron\npulses and their poor phase synchronization to the optical excitation pulses.\nState-of-the-art photon-driven sources have good monochromaticity but poor\nphase synchronization. In contrast, field-driven photoemission has much higher\nlight phase synchronization, due to the intrinsic sub-cycle emission dynamics,\nbut poor monochromaticity. Such sources suffer from larger electron energy\nspreads (3 - 100 eV) attributed to the relatively low field enhancement of the\nconventional metal tips which necessitates long pump wavelengths (> 800 nm) in\norder to gain sufficient ponderomotive potential to access the field-driven\nregime. In this work, field-driven photoemission from ~1 nm radius carbon\nnanotubes excited by a femtosecond laser at a short wavelength of 410 nm has\nbeen realized. The energy spread of field-driven electrons is effectively\ncompressed to 0.25 eV outperforming all conventional ultrafast electron\nsources. Our new nanotube-based ultrafast electron source opens exciting\nprospects for attosecond imaging and emerging light-wave electronics.\n", "  In 2012, Chen Ning Yang received a 90th birthday gift in the form of a black\ncube inscribed with his 13 most important contributions, which cover four major\nareas of physics: statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, particle\nphysics and field theory. We briefly describe these 13 contributions and make\ngeneral comments about Yang's distinctive style as a trailblazing leader in\nresearch.\n", "  Recent X-ray observations of blue-shifted absorption lines revealed an\nexistence of the extremely fast disk winds with outflow velocities of\n~0.1-0.3c. Such fast outflows would have a large impact on the coevolution of\nblack holes and host galaxies since they are expected to carry a large amount\nof kinetic energy. One of the common characteristics of these fast winds is a\nstrong time variability of the absorption feature. To investigate this\nvariability, we have developed a new X-ray spectral model of the disk winds,\nwhich is generated by 3-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer simulations\non the assumption of the realistic wind geometry. By applying our wind model to\nthe multi-epoch X-ray data of an archetypal wind source PDS 456, we find the\nvariability in the absorption line is explained by a change of the wind\noutflowing angle without any large variability in the mass outflow rate of the\nwind. This result indicates that the fast disk winds are stable and that local\nhydrodynamic instabilities produce a large time variability of the absorption\nline. Moreover, we also apply our wind model to the disk-line source 1H\n0707-495. The characteristic Fe-K feature in this source is successfully\nreproduced our disk wind model for all the observations.\n", "  The measurement of the inclusive $Wt$ cross-section at 13 TeV is performed\nusing 3.2$\\,\\text{fb}{^{-1}}$ of proton--proton collision data collected by the\nATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015. Events are required to have at least one jet\nand two opposite sign leptons. The cross section is measured to be $\\sigma_{Wt}\n= 94\\pm 10\\text{(stat.)}^{+28}_{-22}\\text{(syst.)}\\pm 2\\text{(lumi})$pb,\ncorresponding to an observed significance of 4.5\\,$\\sigma$ (3.9\\,$\\sigma$\nexpected). The result is consistent with the Standard Model prediction.\n", "  Metasurfaces enable a new paradigm of controlling electromagnetic waves by\nmanipulating subwavelength artificial structures within just a fraction of\nwavelength. Despite the rapid growth, simultaneously achieving\nlow-dimensionality, high transmission efficiency, real-time continuous\nreconfigurability, and a wide variety of re-programmable functions are still\nvery challenging, forcing researchers to realize just one or few of the\naforementioned features in one design. In this study, we report a subwavelength\nreconfigurable Huygens' metasurface realized by loading it with controllable\nactive elements. Our proposed design provides a unified solution to the\naforementioned challenges of real-time local reconfigurability of efficient\nHuygens' metasurfaces. As one exemplary demonstration, we experimentally\nrealized a reconfigurable metalens at the microwave frequencies which, to our\nbest knowledge, demonstrates for the first time that multiple and complex focal\nspots can be controlled simultaneously at distinct spatial positions and\nre-programmable in any desired fashion, with fast response time and high\nefficiency. The presented active Huygens' metalens may offer unprecedented\npotentials for real-time, fast, and sophisticated electromagnetic wave\nmanipulation such as dynamic holography, focusing, beam shaping/steering,\nimaging and active emission control.\n", "  The abundant forms in which the major elements in the universe exist have\nbeen determined from numerous astronomical observations and meteoritic\nanalyses. Iron (Fe) is an exception, in that only depletion of gaseous Fe has\nbeen detected in the interstellar medium, suggesting that Fe is condensed into\na solid, possibly the astronomically invisible metal. To determine the primary\nform of Fe, we replicated the formation of Fe grains in gaseous ejecta of\nevolved stars by means of microgravity experiments. We found that the sticking\nprobability for formation of Fe grains is extremely small; only several atoms\nwill stick per hundred thousand collisions, so that homogeneous nucleation of\nmetallic Fe grains is highly ineffective, even in the Fe-rich ejecta of Type Ia\nsupernovae. This implies that most Fe is locked up as grains of Fe compounds or\nas impurities accreted onto other grains in the interstellar medium.\n", "  ${\\rm W}^\\pm {\\rm W}^\\pm {\\rm H}$ production at hadron colliders through\nvector boson scattering is a so far unconsidered process, which leads to a\nclean signature of two same-sign charged leptons and two widely separated jets.\nThis process is sensitive to the ${\\rm HHH}$ and ${\\rm WWHH}$ couplings and any\ndeviation of these couplings from their SM predictions serves as direct\nevidence of new physics beyond the SM. In this paper we perform a Monte Carlo\nstudy of this process for the $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV LHC and a $100$ TeV\npp-collider, and provide projections of the constraints on the triple-Higgs and\n${\\rm WWHH}$ quartic couplings for these environments. In particular, we\nconsider the impact of pileup on the expected sensitivity in this channel. Our\nanalysis demonstrates that although the sensitivity to the ${\\rm HHH}$ coupling\nis rather low, the ${\\rm WWHH}$ coupling can be constrained in this channel\nwithin $\\sim 100\\%$ and $\\sim 20\\%$ at 95\\% confidence level around the SM\nprediction at the HL-LHC and a 100 TeV pp-collider, respectively.\n", "  Understanding flavor dependence of the parton energy loss is one of key tasks\nof the jet quenching physics. In these proceedings we provide a summary of\nrecent works on a quantification of the flavor dependence of parton energy loss\nalong with a summary and discussion of a subset of contributions presented at\nthe Hard Probes 2016 conference which are related to the flavor aspects of\nparton energy loss.\n", "  Autonomous orbit determination via integration of epoch-differenced gravity\ngradients and starlight refraction is proposed in this paper for\nlow-Earth-orbiting satellites operating in GPS-denied environments. The\nstarlight refrac-tion can compensate for the significant along-track position\nerror using solely gravity gradients and benefit from the integration in view\nof accuracy improvement in radial and cross-track position estimates. The\nbetween-epoch dif-ferencing of gravity gradients is employed to eliminate\nslowly varying measurement biases and noises near the orbit revolution\nfrequency. The refraction angle is directly used as measurement and its\nJacobian matrix is derived from an implicit observation equation. An\ninformation fusion filter based on sequential extended Kalman filter is\ndevel-oped for the orbit determination. Truth-model simulations are used to\ntest the performance of the algorithm and the effects of differencing intervals\nand orbital heights are analyzed. A semi-simulation study using actual gravity\ngra-dient data from the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation\nExplorer (GOCE) combined with simulated starlight refraction measurements is\nfurther conducted and a three-dimensional position accuracy of better than 100\nm is achieved.\n", "  The extension of the KDA analytical model of FR II-type source evolution\noriginally assuming a continuum injection process in the jet-IGM (intergalactic\nmedium) interaction towards a case of the jet's termination is presented and\nbriefly discussed. The dynamical evolution of FR II-type sources predicted with\nthis extended model, hereafter referred to as KDA EXT, and its application to\nthe chosen radio sources. Following the classical approach based on the\nsource's continuous injection and self-similarity, I propose the effective\nformulae describing the length and luminosity evolution of the lobes during an\nabsence of the jet flow, and present the resulting diagrams for the\ncharacteristics mentioned. Using an algorithm based on the numerical\nintegration of a modified formula for jet power, the KDA EXT model is fitted to\nthree radio galaxies. Their predicted spectra are then compared to the observed\nspectra, proving that these fits are better than the best spectral fit provided\nby the original KDA model of the FR II-type sources dynamical evolution.\n", "  For future solar missions as well as ground-based telescopes, efficient ways\nto return and process data have become increasingly important. Solar Orbiter,\ne.g., which is the next ESA/NASA mission to explore the Sun and the\nheliosphere, is a deep-space mission, which implies a limited telemetry rate\nthat makes efficient onboard data compression a necessity to achieve the\nmission science goals. Missions like the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and\nfuture ground-based telescopes such as the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, on\nthe other hand, face the challenge of making petabyte-sized solar data archives\naccessible to the solar community. New image compression standards address\nthese challenges by implementing efficient and flexible compression algorithms\nthat can be tailored to user requirements. We analyse solar images from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument onboard SDO to study the effect\nof lossy JPEG2000 (from the Joint Photographic Experts Group 2000) image\ncompression at different bit rates. To assess the quality of compressed images,\nwe use the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) index as well as the widely used\npeak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as metrics and compare the two in the context\nof solar EUV images. In addition, we perform tests to validate the scientific\nuse of the lossily compressed images by analysing examples of an on-disk and\noff-limb coronal-loop oscillation time-series observed by AIA/SDO.\n", "  We introduce a solvable Lagrangian model for droplet bouncing. The model\npredicts that, for an axisymmetric drop, the contact time decreases to a\nconstant value with increasing Weber number, in qualitative agreement with\nexperiments, because the system is well approximated as a simple harmonic\noscillator. We introduce asymmetries in the velocity, initial droplet shape,\nand contact line drag acting on the droplet and show that asymmetry can often\nlead to a reduced contact time and lift-off in an elongated shape. The model\nallows us to explain the mechanisms behind non-axisymmetric bouncing in terms\nof surface tension forces. Once the drop has an elliptical footprint the\nsurface tension force acting on the longer sides is greater. Therefore the\nshorter axis retracts faster and, due to the incompressibility constraints,\npumps fluid along the more extended droplet axis. This leads to a positive\nfeedback, allowing the drop to jump in an elongated configuration, and more\nquickly.\n", "  We present results of observation of Cygnus-A radiosource scintillation in\nthe Earth's ionosphere in quiet and disturbed geomagnetic condition at Irkutsk\nincoherent scattering radar (IISR). Scintillation method applied for ionosphere\ntesting at IISR confidently defines Fresnel frequency and power cutoff - the\nspectral characteristics usually related to the velocities and spatial spectra\nof ionospheric plasma irregularities. We also use IGFR magnetic field model in\norder to show relation between shape of discrete radio source scintillation\nspectra and direction to the radio source with respect to geomagnetic field.\nObserved increasing of S4 index in magnetic zenith is conditioned by the\nscintillation spectrum widening. We also evaluate zonal velocity of observed\nionospheric irregularities as ~10 m/sec assuming irregularities to appear at\nthe height of F2 layer maximum of the ionosphere.\n", "  Quantum resources such as superposition and entanglement have been used to\nprovide unconditional key distribution, secret sharing and communication\ncomplexity reduction. In this letter we present a novel quantum information\nprotocol for dining cryptographers problem and anonymous vote casting by a\ngroup of voters. We successfully demonstrate the experimental realization of\nthe protocol using single photon transmission. Our implementation employs a\nflying particle scheme where a photon passes by the voters who perform a\nsequence of actions (unitary transformations) on the photonic state at their\nlocal stations.\n", "  Externally controlled motion of micro and nanomotors in a fluid environment\nconstitutes a promising tool in biosensing, targeted delivery and environmental\nremediation. In particular, recent experiments have demonstrated that fuel-free\npropulsion can be achieved through the application of external magnetic fields\non magnetic helically shaped structures. The magnetic interaction between\nhelices and the rotating field induces a torque that rotates and propels them\nvia the coupled rotational-translational motion. Recent works have shown that\nthere exist certain optimal geometries of helical shapes for propulsion.\nHowever, experiments show that controlled motion remains a challenge at the\nnanoscale due to Brownian motion that interferes with the deterministic motion\nand makes it difficult to achieve controlled steering. In the present work we\nemploy quantitatively accurate simulation methodology to design a setup for\nwhich magnetic nanohelices of 30 nm in radius, with and without cargo, can be\naccurately propelled and steered in the presence of thermal fluctuations. In\nparticular, we demonstrate fast transport of such nanomotors and devise\nprotocols in manipulating external fields to achieve directionally controlled\nsteering at biologically relevant temperatures.\n", "  We examine emergent properties of 2D supramolecular networks, using\nenumeration of configurations formed by interacting dominoes on square lattices\nas a simple model system. Possible ground states are identified using a convex\nhull construction in the interaction parameters for nearest-neighbour bonds. We\ndemonstrate how this construction can be used to design interaction parameters\nwhich lead to networks with specific properties, including chirality and highly\ndegenerate ground states. We then introduce kinetics as simple local\nrearrangements. By partitioning the configuration space into smaller sets which\nsatisfy different topological constraints, we can design configurations which\nare kinetically trapped. By considering heat capacity curves along directions\nthrough the convex hull, we also demonstrate design of interacting domino\nconfigurations to create tilings robust against temperature induced phase\ntransitions. We discuss extension of this design construction to more complex\nmolecular shapes.\n", "  We present chemical abundances of carbon and oxygen in the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds from optical spectra of H II regions. We analyse the\nbehaviour of the O/H, C/H and C/O abundances ratios and their spatial\ndistribution inside the galaxies. The results show that the radial gradients\ncan be considered flat for all these elements in both galaxies. In addition, we\ncompare our results with those of other more massive spiral galaxies. We find a\ncorrelation between the absolute magnitude, M_v, of the galaxies and the slopes\nof C/H and C/O gradients. The more massive galaxies show steeper C/H and C/O\ngradients than the less massive ones.\n", "  A ladder algebraic structure for $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^+)$ which closes the Lie\nalgebra $h(1)\\oplus h(1)$, where $h(1)$ is the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, is\npresented in terms of a basis of associated Laguerre polynomials. Using the\nSchwinger method the quadratic generators that span the alternative Lie\nalgebras $so(3)$, $so(2,1)$ and $so(3,2)$ are also constructed. These families\nof (pseudo) orthogonal algebras also allow to obtain unitary irreducible\nrepresentations in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ similar to those of the spherical\nharmonics.\n", "  We present a new auxiliary field representation for the four-fermi term of\nthe gauge-fixed Green-Schwarz superstring action which describes fluctuations\naround the null-cusp background in $AdS_5\\times S^5$. We sketch the main\nfeatures of the fermionic operator spectrum, identifying the region of\nparameter space where the sign ambiguity is absent. Measurements for the\nobservables in the setup here described are presented and discussed in a\nforthcoming publication.\n", "  Heat transfer in the SR flow of power, rather than the Newton current of cold\nmasses, provides proper referents for GR geodesic motion of inertial energy and\nfor metric of non-empty space. GR can compare losses of internal energy under\nspeed increases and can explain the attraction law by the body tendency toward\nequipartition of kinetic energies over internal and external degrees of\nfreedom. Thermodynamic approach numerically describes the cyclic dynamics of\nthe vertical fall to center with the final path deceleration followed by the\naccelerated rise as an oscillation around the kinetic energy equilibrium of\ngeodetically moving body and pushes other testable predictions for inertial\ncharges with heat in strong field gravitation.\n", "  The determination of the electromagnetic field generated by a charge in\nhyperbolic motion is a classical problem for which the majority view is that\nthe Li\\'enard-Wiechert solution which implies that the charge radiates) is the\ncorrect one. However we analyze in this paper a less known solution due to\nTurakulov that differs from the Li\\'enard-Wiechert one and which according to\nhim does not radiate. We prove his conclusion to be wrong. We analyze the\nimplications of both solutions concerning the validity of the Equivalence\nPrinciple. We analyze also two other issues related to hyperbolic motion, the\nso-called Bell's \"paradox\" which is as yet source of misunderstandings and the\nUnruh effect, which according to its standard derivation in the majority of the\ntexts, is a correct prediction of quantum field theory. We recall that the\nstandard derivation of the Unruh effect does not resist any tentative of any\nrigorous mathematical investigation, in particular the one based in the\nalgebraic approach to field theory which we also recall. These results make us\nto align with some researchers that also conclude that the Unruh effect does\nnot exist.\n", "  There is a need for affordable, widely deployable maternal-fetal ECG monitors\nto improve maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and delivery. Based on\nthe diffusion-based channel selection, here we present the mathematical\nformalism and clinical validation of an algorithm capable of accurate\nseparation of maternal and fetal ECG from a two channel signal acquired over\nmaternal abdomen.\n", "  A novel device that can be used as a tunable support-free phase plate for\ntransmission electron microscopy of weakly scattering specimens is described.\nThe device relies on the generation of a controlled phase shift by the magnetic\nfield of a segment of current-carrying wire that is oriented parallel or\nantiparallel to the electron beam. The validity of the concept is established\nusing both experimental electron holographic measurements and a theoretical\nmodel based on Ampere's law. Computer simulations are used to illustrate the\nresulting contrast enhancement for studies of biological cells and\nmacromolecules.\n", "  We prepare high quality actinide targets for studies of neutron induced and\ncharged particle induced fission. I report on our efforts to measure fragment\nenergy loss in the target backings and to diagnose the crud problem frequently\nfound in 248Cm and 252Cf sources and targets. I discuss the preparation of\nmulti-isotopic targets for the Fission TPC and our efforts to measure the\npointing resolution of this device. The issues of target uniformity, chemical\ncomposition and radiation stability of the targets are discussed along with\nproblems of high/low specific activity regions in a single target.\n", "  The effects of MHD boundary layer flow of non-linear thermal radiation with\nconvective heat transfer and non-uniform heat source/sink in presence of\nthermophortic velocity and chemical reaction investigated in this study.\nSuitable similarity transformation are used to solve the partial ordinary\ndifferential equation of considered governing flow. Runge-Kutta fourth fifth\norder Fehlberg method with shooting techniques are used to solved\nnon-dimensional governing equations. The variation of different parameters such\nas thermophoretic parameter, chemical reaction parameter, non- uniform heat\nsource/sink parameters are studied on velocity, temperature and concentration\nprofiles, and are described by suitable graphs and tables. The obtained results\nare in very well agreement with previous results.\n", "  We introduce a statistical method to investigate the impact of dyadic\nrelations on complex networks generated from repeated interactions. It is based\non generalised hypergeometric ensembles, a class of statistical network\nensembles developed recently. We represent different types of known relations\nbetween system elements by weighted graphs, separated in the different layers\nof a multiplex network. With our method we can regress the influence of each\nrelational layer, the independent variables, on the interaction counts, the\ndependent variables. Moreover, we can test the statistical significance of the\nrelations as explanatory variables for the observed interactions. To\ndemonstrate the power of our approach and its broad applicability, we will\npresent examples based on synthetic and empirical data.\n", "  When the noise affecting time series is colored with unknown statistics, a\ndifficulty for sinusoid detection is to control the true significance level of\nthe test outcome. This paper investigates the possibility of using training\ndata sets of the noise to improve this control. Specifically, we analyze the\nperformances of various detectors {applied to} periodograms standardized using\ntraining data sets. Emphasis is put on sparse detection in the Fourier domain\nand on the limitation posed by the necessarily finite size of the training sets\navailable in practice. We study the resulting false alarm and detection rates\nand show that standardization leads in some cases to powerful constant false\nalarm rate tests. The study is both analytical and numerical. Although\nanalytical results are derived in an asymptotic regime, numerical results show\nthat theory accurately describes the tests' behaviour for moderately large\nsample sizes. Throughout the paper, an application of the considered\nperiodogram standardization is presented for exoplanet detection in radial\nvelocity data.\n", "  We investigate the statistics of 288 low-latitude coronal holes extracted\nfrom SDO/AIA-193 filtergrams over the time range 2011/01/01 to 2013/12/31. We\nanalyse the distribution of characteristic coronal hole properties, such as the\nareas, mean AIA-193 intensities, and mean magnetic field densities, the local\ndistribution of the SDO/AIA-193 intensity and the magnetic field within the\ncoronal holes, and the distribution of magnetic flux tubes in coronal holes. We\nfind that the mean magnetic field density of all coronal holes under study is\n3.0 +- 1.6 G, and the percentage of unbalanced magnetic flux is 49 +- 16 %. The\nmean magnetic field density, the mean unsigned magnetic field density, and the\npercentage of unbalanced magnetic flux of coronal holes depend strongly\npairwise on each other, with correlation coefficients cc > 0.92. Furthermore,\nwe find that the unbalanced magnetic flux of the coronal holes is predominantly\nconcentrated in magnetic flux tubes: 38 % (81 %) of the unbalanced magnetic\nflux of coronal holes arises from only 1 % (10 %) of the coronal hole area,\nclustered in magnetic flux tubes with field strengths > 50 G (10 G). The\naverage magnetic field density and the unbalanced magnetic flux derived from\nthe magnetic flux tubes correlate with the mean magnetic field density and the\nunbalanced magnetic flux of the overall coronal hole (cc > 0.93). These\nfindings give evidence that the overall magnetic characteristics of coronal\nholes are governed by the characteristics of the magnetic flux tubes.\n", "  In this note, we describe our recent results on semiclassical measures for\nthe Schr{\\\"o}dinger evolution on Zoll manifolds. We focus on the particular\ncase of eigenmodes of the Schr{\\\"o}dinger operator on the sphere endowed with\nits canonical metric. We also recall the relation of this problem with the\nobservability question from control theory. In particular, we exhibit examples\nof open sets and potentials on the 2-sphere for which observability fails for\nthe evolution problem while it holds for the stationary one. Finally, we give\nsome new results in the case where the Radon transform of the potential\nidentically vanishes.\n", "  The recent evolution of induced seismicity in Central United States calls for\nexhaustive catalogs to improve seismic hazard assessment. Over the last\ndecades, the volume of seismic data has increased exponentially, creating a\nneed for efficient algorithms to reliably detect and locate earthquakes.\nToday's most elaborate methods scan through the plethora of continuous seismic\nrecords, searching for repeating seismic signals. In this work, we leverage the\nrecent advances in artificial intelligence and present ConvNetQuake, a highly\nscalable convolutional neural network for earthquake detection and location\nfrom a single waveform. We apply our technique to study the induced seismicity\nin Oklahoma (USA). We detect 20 times more earthquakes than previously\ncataloged by the Oklahoma Geological Survey. Our algorithm is orders of\nmagnitude faster than established methods.\n", "  The present material covers the features of large scale ring dynamics in\nperturbed flows that were not addressed in part 1 (astro-ph/1606.00759); this\nincludes an extensive coverage of all kinds of ring modes dynamics (except\ndensity waves which have been covered in part 1), the origin of ring\neccentricities and mode amplitudes, and the issue of ring/gap confinement. This\nstill leaves aside a number of important dynamical issues relating to the ring\nsmall scale structure, most notably the dynamics of self-gravitational wakes,\nof local viscous overstabilities and of ballistic transport processes.\n  As this material is designed to be self-contained, there is some 30% overlap\nwith part 1. This work constitutes a preprint of Chapter 11 of the forthcoming\nCambridge University book on rings (Planetary Ring Systems, Matt Tiscareno and\nCarl Murray, eds).\n", "  Shear responsive surfaces offer potential advances in a number of\napplications. Surface functionalisation using polymer brushes is one route to\nsuch properties, particularly in the case of entangled polymers. We report on\nneutron reflectometry measurements of polymer brushes in entangled polymer\nsolutions performed under controlled shear, as well as coarse-grained computer\nsimulations corresponding to these interfaces. Here we show a reversible and\nreproducible collapse of the brushes, increasing with the shear rate. Using two\nbrushes of greatly different chain lengths and grafting densities, we\ndemonstrate that the dynamics responsible for the structural change of the\nbrush are governed by the free chains in solution rather than the brush itself,\nwithin the range of parameters examined. The phenomenon of the brush collapse\ncould find applications in the tailoring of nanosensors, and as a way to\ndynamically control surface friction and adhesion.\n", "  The scope of this contribution is to present an overview of the theory of\nstructured deformations of continua, together with some applications.\nStructured deformations aim at being a unified theory in which elastic and\nplastic behaviours, as well as fractures and defects can be described in a\nsingle setting. Since its introduction in the scientific community of rational\nmechanicists (Del Piero-Owen, ARMA 1993), the theory has been put in the\nframework of variational calculus (Choksi-Fonseca, ARMA 1997), thus allowing\nfor solution of problems via energy minimization. Some background, three\nproblems and a discussion on future directions are presented.\n", "  Three complementary methods have been implemented in the code Denovo that\naccelerate neutral particle transport calculations with methods that use\nleadership-class computers fully and effectively: a multigroup block (MG)\nKrylov solver, a Rayleigh quotient iteration (RQI) eigenvalue solver, and a\nmultigrid in energy preconditioner. The multigroup Krylov solver converges more\nquickly than Gauss Seidel and enables energy decomposition such that Denovo can\nscale to hundreds of thousands of cores. The new multigrid in energy\npreconditioner reduces iteration count for many problem types and takes\nadvantage of the new energy decomposition such that it can scale efficiently.\nThese two tools are useful on their own, but together they enable the RQI\neigenvalue solver to work. Each individual method has been described before,\nbut this is the first time they have been demonstrated to work together\neffectively.\n  RQI should converge in fewer iterations than power iteration (PI) for large\nand challenging problems. RQI creates shifted systems that would not be\ntractable without the MG Krylov solver. It also creates ill-conditioned\nmatrices that cannot converge without the multigrid in energy preconditioner.\nUsing these methods together, RQI converged in fewer iterations and in less\ntime than all PI calculations for a full pressurized water reactor core. It\nalso scaled reasonably well out to 275,968 cores.\n", "  The highly populated, low-energy excitations of a scalar field of mass\n$m_a\\sim 10^{-22}\\,\\textrm{eV}$ can represent the full dark matter content of\nthe universe and alleviate some tensions in the standard cosmological scenario\non small-scales. This {\\it fuzzy dark matter} component is commonly assumed to\narise as the consequence of a new axion-like particle in the matter sector, yet\nfor simplicity it is usually modeled in terms of a simple free quadratic field.\nIn this paper we consider how the cosmological constraints are modified when\nthe effects of an instanton potential and temperature-dependent mass are\nincluded. Current isocurvature and tensor bounds confirms that this particle\nshould be formed before the end of a low-scale inflation period with Hubble\nparameter $H_I\\lesssim 2.5\\times 10^{12}\\,\\textrm{GeV}$, in accordance with\nprevious free-field analysis. The axion decay constant, $f_a$, which fixes\naxion couplings, appears in the instanton potential and determines the relic\nabundance, the stability of galaxy cores to axion emission, and the direct\nsearches of fuzzy dark matter. If the axion mass is $T$-independent, we find\nthat $f_a\\gtrsim 10^{16}\\,\\text{GeV}$ is required in order to reach the\nobserved relic density without fine tuning the initial conditions, while for a\n$T$-dependent case this bound can be lowered by an order of magnitude. However,\nthe anharmonicities in the instanton potential, and mainly a $T$-dependent\nmass, can delay the onset of field oscillations, leading to larger physical\nsuppression scales in the matter power spectrum for a fixed zero-temperature\naxion mass. This may favor a string or accidental axion over one emerging from\na strongly coupled gauge sector if this model is required to provide large\ngalactic halo cores while simultaneously satisfying observational constraints\nfrom cosmic structure formation.\n", "  The physical properties of an intermetallic compound CeRh2Ga2 have been\ninvestigated by magnetic susceptibility \\chi(T), isothermal magnetization M(H),\nheat capacity C_p(T), electrical resistivity \\rho(T), thermal conductivity\n\\kappa(T) and thermopower S(T) measurements. CeRh2Ga2 is found to crystallize\nwith CaBe2Ge2-type primitive tetragonal structure (space group P4/nmm). No\nevidence of long range magnetic order is seen down to 1.8 K. The \\chi(T) data\nshow paramagnetic behavior with an effective moment \\mu_eff ~ 2.5 \\mu_B/Ce\nindicating Ce^3+ valence state of Ce ions. The \\rho(T) data exhibit Kondo\nlattice behavior with a metallic ground state. The low-T C_p(T) data yield an\nenhanced Sommerfeld coefficient \\gamma = 130(2) mJ/mol K^2 characterizing\nCeRh2Ga2 as a moderate heavy fermion system. The high-T C_p(T) and \\rho(T) show\nan anomaly near 255 K, reflecting a phase transition. The \\kappa(T) suggests\nphonon dominated thermal transport with considerably higher values of Lorenz\nnumber L(T) compared to the theoretical Sommerfeld value L_0.\n", "  Empirical studies of the first generation of stars and quasars will likely\nbecome feasible within the next decade in several different wavelength bands.\nMicrowave anisotropy experiments, such as MAP or Planck, will set constraints\non the ionization history of the intergalactic medium due to these sources. In\nthe infrared, the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will be able to\ndirectly detect sub-galactic objects at redshifts z>10. In the optical, data\nfrom the Hubble Deep Field already places a constraint on the abundance of\nhigh-redshift quasars. However, the epoch of the first quasars might be first\nprobed in X-ray bands, by instruments such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory\n(CXO) and the X-ray Multi-mirror Mission (XMM). In a 500 Ksec integration, CXO\nreaches a sensitivity of 2x10-16 erg/s cm^2. Based on simple hierarchical CDM\nmodels, we find that at this flux threshold approx. 100 quasars might be\ndetectable from redshifts z>5, and approx. 1 quasar at z=10, in each 17x17\narcmin field. Measurement of the power spectrum of the unresolved soft X-ray\nbackground will further constrain models of faint, high-redshift quasars.\n", "  We fit binary lens models to the data covering the initial part of real\nmicrolensing events in an attempt to predict the time of the second caustic\ncrossing. We use approximations during the initial search through the parameter\nspace for light curves that roughly match the observed ones. Exact methods for\ncalculating the lens magnification of an extended source are used when we\nrefine our best initial models. Our calculations show that the reliable\nprediction of the second crossing can only be made very late, when the light\ncurve has risen appreciably after the minimum between the two\ncaustic-crossings. The best observational strategy is therefore to sample as\nfrequently as possible once the light curve starts to rise after the minimum.\n", "  An analytical form of the quantum magnetization oscillations (de Haas-van\nAlphen effect) is derived for two- and quasi two-dimensional metals in normal\nand superconducting mixed states. The theory is developed under condition that\nthe chemical potential is much greater than the cyclotron frequency, which is\nproved to be valid for using grand canonical ensemble in the systems of low\ndimensionality. Effects of impurity, temperature, spin-splitting and vortex\nlattice - in the case of superconductors of type II -, are taken into account.\nContrary to the three dimensional case, the oscillations in sufficiently pure\nsystems of low dimensionality and at sufficiently low temperatures are\ncharacterized by a saw-tooth wave form, which smoothened with temperature and\nconcentration of impurities growth. In the normal quasi two-dimensional\nsystems, the expression for the magnetization oscillations includes an extra\nfactor expressed through the transfer integral between the layers. The\nadditional damping effect due to the vortex lattice is found. The criterion of\nproximity to the upper critical field for the observation of de Haas-van Alphen\neffect in the superconducting mixed state is established.\n", "  A brief review of theory of ferromagnetism of dilute magnetic semiconductors\nof the form (A,Mn)B based on the double exchange model is first given. A\nsystematic investigation of the phenomena extending the current theory is\noutlined. We begin with an investigation of the regions of instability of the\nnonmagnetic towards the ferromagnetic state of a system of Mn-atoms doped in\nAB-type semiconductor. A self-consistent many-body theory of the ferromagnetic\nstate is then developed, going beyond the mean field approaches by including\nfluctuations of the Mn-spins and the itinerant hole-gas. A functional theory\nsuitable for computation of system properties such as Curie temperature as a\nfunction of hole and the Mn-concentration, spin-current, etc. is formulated.\n", "  The most puzzling aspect of the glass transition observed in laboratory is an\napparent decoupling of dynamics from structure. In this paper we recount the\nimplication of various theories of glass transition for the static correlation\nlength in an attempt to reconcile the dynamic and static lengths associate with\nthe glass problem. We argue that a more recent characterization of the static\nrelaxation length based on the bond ordering scenario, as the typical length\nover which the energy fluctuations are correlated, is more consistent with, and\nindeed in perfect agreement with the typical linear size of the dynamically\nheterogeneous domains observed in deeply supercooled liquids. The correlated\nrelaxation of bonds in terms of energy is therefore identified as the physical\norigin of the observed dynamic heterogeneity.\n", "  By considering the Langevin dynamics of the SK spin glass with a spherical\nconstraint we calculate the asymptotic distance between two real replicas that\nevolve with the same thermal noise from different initial conditions. Despite\nthe simplicity of the model its dynamics is known to be non trivial and\npresents aging phenomena. We find that the asymptotic distance between two\nreplicas is maximal for a whole family of initial conditions that are\narbitrarily close at t=0 . The asymptotic distance presents a dynamical\ntransition at a temperature equal to the static phase transition one.\n", "  We show that at short time aging is realized in a simple model of binary\nglasses. We find that below the transition point the off-equilibrium\ncorrelation functions and response functions are compatible with the relations\nthat were originally derived Cugliandolo Kurchan for generalized spin glasses.\n", "  The cooperative behaviour of interacting neurons and synapses is studied\nusing models and methods from statistical physics. The competition between\ntraining error and entropy may lead to discontinuous properties of the neural\nnetwork. This is demonstrated for a few examples: Perceptron, associative\nmemory, learning from examples, generalization, multilayer networks, structure\nrecognition, Bayesian estimate, on-line training, noise estimation and time\nseries generation.\n", "  Joint distribution function of N eigenvalues of U(N) invariant random-matrix\nensemble can be interpreted as a probability density to find N fictitious\nnon-interacting fermions to be confined in a one-dimensional space. Within this\npicture a general formalism is developed to study the eigenvalue correlations\nin non-Gaussian ensembles of large random matrices possessing non-monotonic,\nlog-singular level confinement. An effective one-particle Schroedinger equation\nfor wave-functions of fictitious fermions is derived. It is shown that\neigenvalue correlations are completely determined by the Dyson's density of\nstates and by the parameter of the logarithmic singularity. Closed analytical\nexpressions for the two-point kernel in the origin, bulk, and soft-edge scaling\nlimits are deduced in a unified way, and novel universal correlations are\npredicted near the end point of the single spectrum support.\n", "  Charging of a clean two-dimensional island is studied in the regime of small\nconcentration of electrons when they form the Wigner crystal. The number of\nelectrons in the island is assumed to be not too big (N < 100). It is shown\nthat the total energy of the island as a function of N has a quasi-periodic\ncomponent of a universal shape, that is independent of the form of\nelectron-electron interactions. These oscillations are caused by the\ncombination of the geometric effects associated with packing of the triangular\nlattice into the circular island. These effects are: the shell effect,\nassociated with starting a new crystalline row, and the so-called confinement\npolaronic effect. In the presence of close metallic gates, which eliminate the\nlong-range part of the electron-electron interactions, the oscillations of the\nenergy bring about simultaneous entering of the dot by a few electrons.\n", "  We review the time evolution of wavepackets at the metal-insulator transition\nin two- and three-dimensional disordered systems. The importance of scale\ninvariance and multifractal eigenfunction fluctuations is stressed. The\nimplications of the frequency- and wavevector-dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient are compared with the results of numerical simulations. We argue\nthat network models are particularly suited for the investigation of the\ndynamics of disordered systems.\n", "  Vortex lattices in the high temperature superconductors undergo a first order\nphase transition which has thus far been regarded as melting from a solid to a\nliquid. We point out an alternative possibility of a two step process in which\nthere is a first order transition from an ordinary vortex lattice to a soft\nvortex solid followed by another first order melting transition from the soft\nvortex solid to a vortex liquid. We focus on the first step. This premelting\ntransition is induced by vacancy and interstitial vortex lines. We obtain good\nagreement with the experimental transition temperature versus field, latent\nheat, and magnetization jumps for YBCO and BSCCO.\n", "  The performance of large neural networks can be judged not only by their\nstorage capacity but also by the time required for learning. A polynomial\nlearning algorithm with learning time $\\sim N^2$ in a network with $N$ units\nmight be practical whereas a learning time $\\sim e^N$ would allow rather small\nnetworks only. The question of absolute storage capacity $\\alpha_c$ and\ncapacity for polynomial learning rules $\\alpha_p$ is discussed for several\nfeed-forward architectures, the perceptron, the binary perceptron, the\ncommittee machine and a perceptron with fixed weights in the first layer and\nadaptive weights in the second layer. The analysis is based partially on\ndynamic mean field theory which is valid for $N\\to\\infty$. Especially for the\ncommittee machine a value $\\alpha_p$ considerably lower than the capacity\npredicted by replica theory or simulations is found. This discrepancy is\nresolved by new simulations investigating the learning time dependence and\nrevealing subtleties in the definition of the capacity.\n", "  The ideas of optimization of learning algorithms in Artificial Neural\nNetworks are reviewed emphasizing generic properties and the online\nimplementations are interpreted from a biological perspective. A simple model\nof the relevant subsidiary variables needed to improve learning in artificial\nfeedforward networks and the `time ordering' of the appearance of the\nrespective information processing systems is proposed. We discuss the\npossibility that these results might be relevant in other contexts, not being\nrestricted to the simple models from which they stem. The analysis of a few\nexamples, which range from the lowest cellular scale to the macroscopic level,\nsuggests that similar ideas could be applied to biological systems.\n", "  The problem of a single impurity in one dimensional Tomonaga-Luttinger\nliquids with a repulsive electron-electron interaction is discussed. We find\nthat the renormalization group flow diagram for the parameters characterizing\nthe impurity is rather complex. Apart from the fixed points corresponding to\ntwo weakly connected semi-infinite wires, the flow diagram contains additional\nfixed points which control the low temperature physics when the bare potential\nof the impurity is not strong.\n", "  A quantum mesoscopic billiard can be viewed as a bounded electronic system\ndue to some external confining potential. Since, in general, we do not have\naccess to the exact expression of this potential, it is usually replaced by a\nset of boundary conditions. We discuss, in addition to the standard Dirichlet\nchoice, the other possibilities of boundary conditions which might correspond\nto more complicated physical situations including the effects of many body\ninteractions or of a strong magnetic field. The latter case is examined more in\ndetails using a new kind of chiral boundary conditions for which it is shown\nthat in the Quantum Hall regime, bulk and edge characteristics can be described\nin a unified way.\n", "  Integral expressions are determined for the elastic displacement and stress\nfields due to stationary or moving dislocation loops in finite samples. These\ngeneral expressions are valid for anisotropic media as well. Specifically for\nthe stress fields, a line integral representation is found, thus showing\nrigorously the independence of the stress fields with respect to the choice of\nslip planes. In the stationary case the line integral representation involves\ncalculating a \"vector potential\" dependent on the specific geometry of the\nsample. Two examples of geometries, isotropic half space and thin plate, are\nshown where the \"vector potential\" has been explicitly determined. With this\ngeneral method one recovers some earlier specific results in these geometries.\n", "  We describe the effects of phase coherence on transport and thermodynamic\nproperties of a disordered conducting network. In analogy with\nweak-localization correction, we calculate the phase coherence contribution to\nthe magnetic response of mesoscopic metallic isolated networks. It is related\nto the return probability for a diffusive particle on the corresponding\nnetwork. By solving the diffusion equation on various types of networks,\nincluding a ring with arms, an infinite square network or a chain of connected\nrings, we deduce the magnetic response. As it is the case for transport\nproperties --weak-localization corrections or universal conductance\nfluctuations-- the magnetic response can be written in term of a single\nfunction S called spectral function which is related to the spatial average of\nthe return probability on the network. We have found that the magnetization of\nan ensemble of CONNECTED rings is of the same order of magnitude as if the\nrings were disconnected.\n", "  Recent experiments on the two dimensional electron gas in various\nsemiconductor devices have revealed an unexpected metal-insulator transition\nand have challenged the previously held assumption that there is no such\ntransition in two dimensions. While the experiments are still at the stage of\nrapid development, it is becoming evident that they cannot be understood from\nthe conventional perspective of weak interactions. In the present paper, we\npropose the following. (1) The low-density insulating state is the Wigner\nGlass, a phase with quasi-long-range translational order and competing\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions. (2) The\ntransition is the melting of this Wigner Glass, disorder being the agent\nallowing the transition to be second order. (3) Within the Wigner Glass phase,\nthere are at least two, distinct magnetic ground-states, a ferromagnetic state\nat very low electron density and a spin-liquid state with a spin pseudo-gap at\nhigher densities. (4) The metallic side of the transition is a non-Fermi\nliquid. These conclusions are encapsulated in Figure 1 which presents the\nproposed phase diagram as a function of disorder strength and density; we also\nsuggest experimental signatures of the various phases and transitions.\n", "  The correlation between local chemical environment and atomic displacements\nin disordered CuAu alloy has been studied using Monte Carlo simulations based\non the effective medium theory (EMT) of metallic cohesion. These simulations\ncorrectly reproduce the chemically-specific nearest-neighbor distances in the\nrandom alloy across the entire Cu\\$_x\\$Au\\$_{1-x}\\$ concentration range. In the\nrandom equiatomic CuAu alloy, the chemically specific pair distances depend\nstrongly on the local atomic environment (i.e. fraction of like/unlike nearest\nneighbors). In CuAu alloy with short-range order, the relationship between\nlocal environment and displacements remains qualitatively similar. However the\nincrease in short-range order causes the average Cu-Au distance to decrease\nbelow the average Cu-Cu distance, as it does in the ordered CuAuI phase. Many\nof these trends can be understood qualitatively from the different neutral\nsphere radii and compressibilities of the Cu and Au atoms.\n", "  We study the combined effect of temperature and disorder in the spacer on the\ninterlayer exchange coupling. The temperature dependence is treated on ab\ninitio level. We employ the spin-polarized surface Green function technique\nwithin the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital method and the Lloyd\nformulation of the IEC. The integrals involving the Fermi-Dirac distribution\nare calculated using an efficient method based on representation of integrands\nby a sum of complex exponentials. Application is made to\nCo/Cu_{100-x}M_x/Co(001) trilayers (M=Zn, Au, and Ni) with varying thicknesses\nof the spacer.\n", "  The stability of a quasicrystalline structure, recently obtained in a\nmolecular-dynamics simulation of rapid cooling of a binary melt, is analyzed\nfor binary hard-sphere mixtures within a density-functional approach. It is\nfound that this quasicrystal is metastable relative to crystalline and fluid\nphases for diameter ratios above 0.83. Such trend is partially reversed for\nlower diameter ratios, since the quasicrystal becomes stable with respect to\nthe crystal but does not reach a coexistence with the fluid.\n", "  We present a non-perturbative approach to the problem of quasiparticles\ncoupled to spin-fluctuations. If the fully dressed spin-fluctuation propagator\nis used in the Feynman graph expansion of the single-particle Green's function,\nthe problem of summing all spin-fluctuation exchange graphs (i.e without\nvirtual fermion loops) can be cast as a functional integral over gaussian\ndistributed random vector fields. A Monte Carlo sampling of this functional\nintegral does not suffer from the 'fermion sign problem' and offers an\nattractive alternative to perturbative calculations. We compare the results of\nour computer simulations with perturbation theory and self-consistent one-loop\ncalculations.\n", "  The dependence of the spin reorientation transition in ultra-thin\nferromagnetic films on external magnetic fields is studied. For different\norientations of the applied field with respect to the film, phase diagrams are\ncalculated within a mean field theory for the classical Heisenberg model. In\nparticular we find that the spin reorientation transition present in this model\nis not suppressed completely by an applied field, as the magnetization\ncomponent perpendicular to the field may show spontaneous order in a certain\ntemperature interval.\n", "  The mean field composite Fermion (CF) picture successfully predicts angular\nmomenta of multiplets forming the lowest energy band in fractional quantum Hall\n(FQH) systems. This success cannot be attributed to a cancellation between\nCoulomb and Chern-Simons interactions beyond the mean field, because these\ninteractions have totally different energy scales. Rather, it results from the\nbehavior of the Coulomb pseudopotential V(L) (pair energy as a function of pair\nangular momentum) in the lowest Landau level (LL). The class of short range\nrepulsive pseudopotentials is defined that lead to short range Laughlin like\ncorrelations in many body systems and to which the CF model can be applied.\nThese Laughlin correlations are described quantitatively using the formalism of\nfractional parentage. The discussion is illustrated with an analysis of the\nenergy spectra obtained in numerical diagonalization of up to eleven electrons\nin the lowest and excited LL's. The qualitative difference in the behavior of\nV(L) is shown to sometimes invalidate the mean field CF picture when applied to\nhigher LL's. For example, the nu=7/3 state is not a Laughlin nu=1/3 state in\nthe first excited LL. The analysis of the involved pseudopotentials also\nexplains the success or failure of the CF picture when applied to other systems\nof charged Fermions with Coulomb repulsion, such as the Laughlin quasiparticles\nin the FQH hierarchy or charged excitons in an electron-hole plasma.\n", "  We investigate the structure and dynamics of sodium disilicate by means of\nmolecular dynamics computer simulation. We show that the structure is described\nby a partially destroyed tetrahedral SiO_4 network and a spherical super\nstructure formed by the silicon and sodium atoms. The static structure factor\nof our simulation is in very good agreement with one from a neutron scattering\nexperiment. For 1008 particles we find strong finite size effects in the\ndynamics which are due to the missing of modes contributing to the boson peak.\n", "  In the mode coupling theory of the liquid to glass transition the long time\nstructural relaxation follows from equations solely determined by equilibrium\nstructural parameters. The present extension of these structural relaxation\nequations to arbitrarily short times on the one hand allows calculations\nunaffected by model assumptions about the microscopic dynamics and on the other\nhand supplies new starting points for analytical studies. As a first\napplication, power-law like structural relaxation at a glass-transition\nsingularity is explicitly proven for a special schematic MCT model.\n", "  In this note I present a simplified version of the recent computation (Mezard\nand Parisi 1998, 1999) of the properties of glasses in the low temperature\nphase in the framework of the replica theory, using an extension of the tools\nused in liquid theory. I will only consider here the case of the internal\nenergy at T=0, which can be studied in a simple way without introducing\nreplicas.\n", "  Hawking effect of Dirac particles in a variable-mass Kerr space-time is\ninvestigated by using method of the generalized tortoise coordinate\ntransformation. The location and the temperature of event horizon of the\nnon-stationary Kerr black hole are derived. It is shown that the temperature\nand the shape of event horizon depend not only on the time but also on the\npolar angle. However, our results demonstrate that the Fermi-Dirac spectrum\ndisplays a new spin-rotation effect which is absent from that of Bose-Einstein\ndistribution.\n", "  The canonical quantization of the most general minisuperspace actions --i.e.\nwith all six scale factor as well as the lapse function and the shift vector\npresent-- describing the vacuum type II, VI and VII geometries, is considered.\nThe reduction to the corresponding physical degrees of freedom is achieved\nthrough the usage of the linear constraints as well as the quantum version of\nthe entire set of classical integrals of motion.\n", "  We describe the spectra and decays of pi pi and pi K atoms within a\nnon-relativistic effective field theory. The evaluations of the energy shifts\nand widths are performed at next-to-leading order in isospin symmetry breaking.\nWe provide general formulae for all S-states, and discuss the states with\nangular momentum one in some detail. The prediction for the lifetime of the pi\nK atom in its ground-state yields tau = (3.7 \\pm 0.4) * 10^{-15} sec.\n", "  We give a quantum field theoretical treatment of a one dimensional electron\nsystem with a fixed chemical potential $\\mu$. The non-perturbative Lindhard\nresponse function is found for an electron system in a sinusoidal potential.\n", "  Inflationary theory is already 20 years old, and it is impossible to describe\nall of its versions and implications in a short talk. I will concentrate on\nseveral subjects which I believe to be most important. First of all, I will\ngive a brief review of the first versions of inflationary theory, from\nStarobinsky model to new inflation. Then I will describe chaotic inflation, the\ntheory of quantum fluctuations and density perturbations, the theory of eternal\ninflation, and recent observational data. In the second part of the talk I will\ndiscuss the recently proposed ekpyrotic scenario and argue that in its present\nform it does not provide a viable alternative to inflation.\n", "  One approach for formulating the classical dynamics of charged particles in\nnon-Abelian gauge theories is due to Wong. Following Wong's approach, we derive\nthe classical equations of motion of a charged particle in U(1) gauge theory on\nnoncommutative space, the so-called noncommutative QED. In the present use of\nthe procedure, it is observed that the definition of mechanical momenta should\nbe modified. The derived equations of motion manifest the previous statement\nabout the dipole behavior of charges in noncommutative space.\n", "  We describe constructing solutions of the field equations of Chern-Simons and\ntopological BF theories in terms of deformation theory of locally constant\n(flat) bundles. Maps of flat connections into one another (dressing\ntransformations) are considered. A method of calculating (nonlocal) dressing\nsymmetries in Chern-Simons and topological BF theories is formulated.\n", "  A family of mappings from the solution spaces of certain generalized\nDrinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies to the self-dual Yang-Mills system on R^{2,2} is\ndescribed. This provides an extension of the well-known relationship between\nself-dual connections and integrable hierarchies of AKNS and Drinfeld-Sokolov\ntype.\n", "  Multicomponent KdV-systems are defined in terms of a set of structure\nconstants and, as shown by Svinolupov, if these define a Jordan algebra the\ncorresponding equations may be said to be integrable, at least in the sense of\nhaving higher-order symmetries, recursion operators and hierarchies of\nconservation laws. In this paper the dispersionless limits of these Jordan KdV\nequations are studied, under the assumptions that the Jordan algebra has a\nunity element and a compatible non-degenerate inner product. Much of this\nstructure may be encoded in a so-called Jordan manifold, akin to a Frobenius\nmanifold. In particular the Hamiltonian properties of these systems are\ninvestigated.\n", "  We apply the Darboux theory of integrability to polynomial ODE's of dimension\n3. Using this theory and computer algebra, we study the existence of first\nintegrals for the 3-dimensional Lotka-Volterra systems with polynomial\ninvariant algebraic solutions linear and quadratic and determine numerous cases\nof integrability.\n", "  Quadratic systems generated using Yang-Baxter equations are integrable in a\nsense, but we display a deterioration in the possession of the Painlev\\'e\nproperty as the number of equations in each `integrable system' increases.\nCertain intermediate systems are constructed and also tested for the Painlev\\'e\nproperty. The Lie symmetries are also computed for completeness.\n", "  Recently a stochastic underpinning for space time has been considered, what\nmay be called Quantized Fractal Space Time. This leads us to a number of very\ninteresting consequences which are testable, and also provides a rationale for\nseveral otherwise inexplicable features in Particle Physics and Cosmology.\nThese matters are investigated in the present paper.\n", "  Three nonequivalent real forms of the complex twisted N=2 supersymmetric Toda\nchain hierarchy (solv-int/9907021) in real N=1 superspace are presented. It is\ndemonstrated that they possess a global twisted N=2 supersymmetry. We discuss a\nnew superfield basis in which the supersymmetry transformations are local.\nFurthermore, a representation of this hierarchy is given in terms of two\ntwisted chiral N=2 superfields. The relations to the s-Toda hierarchy by H.\nAratyn, E. Nissimov and S. Pacheva (solv-int/9801021) as well as to the\nmodified and derivative NLS hierarchies are established.\n"]}
