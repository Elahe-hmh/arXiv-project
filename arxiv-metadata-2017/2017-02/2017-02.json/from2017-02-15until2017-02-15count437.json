(relativistic iron-rich chunks) and the collapsar envelope,\nleads to features indicative of those observed in Gamma Ray Bursts. The\nquark-nova ejecta collides with the stellar envelope creating an outward moving\ncap\n  (Gamma ~ 1-10) above the polar funnel. Prompt gamma-ray burst emission from\ninternal shocks in relativistic jets (following accretion onto the quark star)\nbecome visible after the cap becomes optically thin. Model features include:\n(i) precursor activity (optical, X-ray, gamma-ray), (ii) prompt gamma-ray\nemission, and (iii) afterglow emission. We discuss SN-less long duration GRBs,\nshort hard GRBs (including association and non-association with star forming\nregions), dark GRBs, the energetic X-ray flares detected in Swift GRBs, and the\nnear-simultaneous optical and gamma-ray prompt emission observed in GRBs in the\ncontext of our model.\n", "  We plan to fit the complete gamma- and X-ray light curves of the long\nduration GRB060218, including the prompt emission, in order to clarify the\nnature of the progenitors and the astrophysical scenario of the class of GRBs\nassociated to SNe Ib/c. The initial total energy of the electron-positron\nplasma E_{e^\\pm}^{tot}=2.32\\times 10^{50} erg has a particularly low value\nsimilarly to the other GRBs associated with SNe. For the first time we observe\na baryon loading B=10^{-2} which coincides with the upper limit for the\ndynamical stability of the fireshell. The effective CircumBurst Medium (CBM)\ndensity shows a radial dependence n_{cbm} \\propto r^{-\\alpha} with\n1.0<\\alpha<1.7 and monotonically decreases from 1 to 10^{-6} particles/cm^3.\nSuch a behavior is interpreted as due to a fragmentation in the fireshell.\nAnalogies with the fragmented density and filling factor characterizing Novae\nare outlined. The fit presented is particularly significant in view of the\ncomplete data set available for GRB060218 and of the fact that it fulfills the\nAmati relation. We fit GRB060218, usually considered as an X-Ray Flash (XRF),\nas a \"canonical GRB\" within our theoretical model. The smallest possible black\nhole, formed by the gravitational collapse of a neutron star in a binary\nsystem, is consistent with the especially low energetics of the class of GRBs\nassociated with SNe Ib/c. We give the first evidence for a fragmentation in the\nfireshell. Such a fragmentation is crucial in explaining both the unusually\nlarge T_{90} and the consequently inferred abnormal low value of the CBM\neffective density.\n", "  We show that the low frequency QPO seen in the power density spectra of black\nhole binaries (and neutron stars) can be explained by Lense-Thirring\nprecession. This has been proposed many times in the past, and simple, single\nradius models can qualitatively match the observed increase in QPO frequency by\ndecreasing a characteristic radius, as predicted by the truncated disc models.\nHowever, this also predicts that the frequency is strongly dependent on spin,\nand gives a maximum frequency at the last stable orbit which is generally much\nhigher than the remarkably constant maximum frequency at ~10Hz observed in all\nblack hole binaries. The key aspect of our model which makes it match these\nobservations is that the precession is of a radially extended region of the hot\ninner flow. The outer radius is set by the truncation radius of the disc as\nabove, but the inner radius lies well outside of the last stable orbit at the\npoint where numerical simulations show that the density drops off sharply for a\nmisaligned flow. Physically motivated analytic estimates for this inner radius\nshow that it increases with a_*, decreasing the expected frequency in a way\nwhich almost completely cancels the expected increase with spin. This ties the\nmaximum predicted frequency to around 10Hz irrespective of a_*, as observed.\nThis is the first QPO model which explains both frequencies and spectrum in the\ncontext of a well established geometry for the accretion flow.\n", "  Stellar rotation is a crucial parameter driving stellar magnetism, activity\nand mixing of chemical elements. Furthermore, the evolution of stellar rotation\nis coupled to the evolution of circumstellar disks. Disk-braking mechanisms are\nbelieved to be responsible for rotational deceleration during the accretion\nphase, and rotational spin-up during the contraction phase after decoupling\nfrom the disk for fast rotators arriving at the ZAMS. We investigate the\nprojected rotational velocities vsini of a sample of young stars with respect\nto the stellar mass and disk evolutionary state to search for possible\nindications of disk-braking mechanisms. We analyse the stellar spectra of 220\nnearby (mostly <100pc) young (2-600 Myr) stars for their vsini, stellar age,\nHalpha emission, and accretion rates. The stars have been observed with FEROS\nand HARPS in La Silla, Chile. The spectra have been cross-correlated with\nappropriate theoretical templates. We build a new calibration to be able to\nderive vsini values from the cross-correlated spectra. Stellar ages are\nestimated from the LiI equivalent width at 6708 Ang. The equivalent width and\nwidth at 10% height of the Halpha emission are measured to identify accretors\nand used to estimate accretion rates. The vsini is then analysed with respect\nto the evolutionary state of the circumstellar disks to search for indications\nof disk-braking mechanisms in accretors. We find that the broad vsini\ndistribution of our targets extends to rotation velocities of up to more than\n100 km/s and peaks at a value of 7.8+-1.2 km/s, and that ~70% of our stars show\nvsini<30 km/s. Furthermore, we can find indications for disk-braking in\naccretors and rotational spin-up of stars which are decoupled from their disks.\nIn addition, we show that a number of young stars are suitable for precise\nradial-velocity measurements for planet-search surveys.\n", "  We investigate the classical eigenvalue problem that arises in hydrodynamics\nand is referred to as the sloshing problem. It describes free liquid\noscillations in a liquid container W in R^3. We study the case when W is an\naxially symmetric, convex, bounded domain satisfying the John condition. The\nCartesian coordinates (x,y,z) are chosen so that the mean free surface of the\nliquid lies in (x,z)-plane and y-axis is directed upwards (y-axis is the axis\nof symmetry). Our first result states that the fundamental eigenvalue has\nmultiplicity 2 and for each fundamental eigenfunction phi there is a change of\nx,z coordinates by a rotation around y-axis so that phi is odd in x-variable.\n  The second result of the paper gives the following monotonicity property of\nthe fundamental eigenfunction phi. If phi is odd in x-variable then it is\nstrictly monotonic in x-variable. This property has the following\nhydrodynamical meaning. If liquid oscillates freely with fundamental frequency\naccording to phi then the free surface elevation of liquid is increasing along\neach line parallel to x-axis during one period of time and decreasing during\nthe other half period. The proof of the second result is based on the method\ndeveloped by D. Jerison and N. Nadirashvili for the hot spots problem for\nNeumann Laplacian.\n", "  We investigate the spin-resolved electron dynamics in a double quantum dot\ndriven by ultrafast asymmetric electromagnetic pulses. Using a analytical model\nwe show that applying an appropriate pulse sequence allows to control\ncoherently the spin degree of freedom on the femtosecond time scale. It can be\nachieved that the spin-up state is localized in a selected quantum dot while\nthe spin-down state remains in the other dot. We show that this photo-induced\nspin-dependent separation can be maintained for a desired period of time.\n", "  Two-term Weyl-type asymptotic law for the eigenvalues of one-dimensional\nquasi-relativistic Hamiltonian (-h^2 c^2 d^2/dx^2 + m^2 c^4)^(1/2) + V_well(x)\n(the Klein-Gordon square-root operator with electrostatic potential) with the\ninfinite square well potential V_well(x) is given: the n-th eigenvalue is equal\nto (n pi/2 - pi/8) h c/a + O(1/n), where 2a is the width of the potential well.\nSimplicity of eigenvalues is proved. Some L^2 and L^infinity properties of\neigenfunctions are also studied. Eigenvalues represent energies of a `massive\nparticle in the box' quasi-relativistic model.\n", "  Computation plays a key role in predicting and analyzing natural phenomena.\nThere are two fundamental barriers to our ability to computationally understand\nthe long-term behavior of a dynamical system that describes a natural process.\nThe first one is unaccounted-for errors, which may make the system\nunpredictable beyond a very limited time horizon. This is especially true for\nchaotic systems, where a small change in the initial conditions may cause a\ndramatic shift in the trajectories. The second one is Turing-completeness. By\nthe undecidability of the Halting Problem, the long-term prospects of a system\nthat can simulate a Turing Machine cannot be determined computationally.\n  We investigate the interplay between these two forces -- unaccounted-for\nerrors and Turing-completeness. We show that the introduction of even a small\namount of noise into a dynamical system is sufficient to \"destroy\"\nTuring-completeness, and to make the system's long-term behavior\ncomputationally predictable. On a more technical level, we deal with long-term\nstatistical properties of dynamical systems, as described by invariant\nmeasures. We show that while there are simple dynamical systems for which the\ninvariant measures are non-computable, perturbing such systems makes the\ninvariant measures efficiently computable. Thus, noise that makes the short\nterm behavior of the system harder to predict, may make its long term\nstatistical behavior computationally tractable. We also obtain some insight\ninto the computational complexity of predicting systems affected by random\nnoise.\n", "  Information about the rotation rate is contained in the low frequency part of\npower spectra, where signatures of nonuniform surface rotation are expected, as\nwell as in the frequency splittings induced by the internal rotation rate. We\nwish to figure out whether the differences between the seismic rotation period\nas determined by a mean rotational splitting, and the rotation period measured\nfrom the low frequency peak in the Fourier spectrum (observed for some of\nCoRoT's targets) can provide constraints on the rotation profile. For uniform\nmoderate rotators,perturbative corrections to second and third order in terms\nof the rotation angular velocity \\Omega, may mimic differential rotation. We\napply our perturbation method to evaluate mode frequencies accurate up to\n\\Omega^3 for uniform rotation. Effects of latitudinal dependence are calculated\nin the linear approximation. In \\beta Cephei pulsators models, third order\neffects become comparable to that of a horizontal shear similar to the solar\none at rotation rates well below the breakup values. We show how a clean\nsignature of the latitudinal shear may be extracted. Our models of two CoRoT\ntarget HD 181906 and HD 181420, represent lower main sequence objects. These\nare slow rotators and nonlinear effects in splittings are accordingly small. We\nuse data on one low frequency peak and one splitting of a dipolar mode to\nconstrain the rotation profile in HD 181420 and HD 181906. The relative\ninfluence of the two effects strongly depends on the type of the oscillation\nmodes in the star and on the magnitude of the rotation rate. Given mean\nrotational splitting and the frequency of a spot signature, it is possible to\ndistinguish between the two hypothesis, and in the case of differential\nrotation in latitude, we propose a method to determine the type of rotation\nprofile and a range of values for the shear.\n", "  The recent progress in the understanding the physical nature of neutron star\nequilibrium configurations and the first observational evidence of a genuinely\nshort gamma-ray burst, GRB 090227B, allows to give an estimate of the\ngravitational waves versus the X and Gamma-ray emission in a short gamma-ray\nburst.\n", "  The collective response of matter is ubiquitous and widely exploited, e.g. in\nplasmonic, optical and electronic devices. Here we trace on an attosecond time\nscale the birth of collective excitations in a finite system and find distinct\nnew features in this regime. Combining quantum chemical computation with\nquantum kinetic methods we calculate the time-dependent light absorption and\nrefraction in fullerene that serve as indicators for the emergence of\ncollective modes. We explain the numerically calculated novel transient\nfeatures by an analytical model and point out the relevance for ultra-fast\nphotonic and electronic applications. A scheme is proposed to measure the\npredicted effects via the emergent attosecond metrology.\n", "  Subject of this paper are the statistical properties of ellipticity\nalignments between galaxies evoked by their coupled angular momenta. Starting\nfrom physical angular momentum models, we bridge the gap towards ellipticity\ncorrelations, ellipticity spectra and derived quantities such as aperture\nmoments, comparing the intrinsic signals with those generated by gravitational\nlensing, with the projected galaxy sample of EUCLID in mind. We investigate the\ndependence of intrinsic ellipticity correlations on cosmological parameters and\nshow that intrinsic ellipticity correlations give rise to non-Gaussian\nlikelihoods as a result of nonlinear functional dependencies. Comparing\nintrinsic ellipticity spectra to weak lensing spectra we quantify the magnitude\nof their contaminating effect on the estimation of cosmological parameters and\nfind that biases on dark energy parameters are very small in an\nangular-momentum based model in contrast to the linear alignment model commonly\nused. Finally, we quantify whether intrinsic ellipticities can be measured in\nthe presence of the much stronger weak lensing induced ellipticity\ncorrelations, if prior knowledge on a cosmological model is assumed.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is best known from observations of the Sun where it\ncauses solar flares. Observations estimate the reconnection rate a small, but\nnon-negligible fraction of the Alfv\\'en speed, so-called fast reconnection.\nUntil recently, the prevailing pictures of reconnection were referring to\neither resistivity or plasma microscopic effects, which was contradictory to\nthe observed rates. The alternative picture was either reconnection due to the\nstochasticity of magnetic field lines in turbulence or the tearing instability\nof the thin current sheet. In this paper I simulated long-term\nthree-dimensional nonlinear evolution of a thin, planar current sheet subject\nto fast oblique tearing instability using direct numerical simulations of\nresistive-viscous MHD. The late-time evolution resembles generic turbulence\nwith -5/3 power spectrum and scale-dependent anisotropy, so I conclude that the\ntearing-driven reconnection becomes turbulent reconnection. The turbulence is\nlocal in scale, so microscopic diffusivity should not affect large-scale\nquantities. This is confirmed by convergence of the reconnection rate towards\n$\\sim 0.015 v_A$ with increasing Lundquist number. In this spontaneous\nreconnection with mean field and without driving the dissipation rate per unit\narea also converge to $\\sim 0.006 \\rho v_A^3$, the dimensionless constants\n$0.015$ and $0.006$ are governed only by self-driven nonlinear dynamics of the\nsheared magnetic field. Remarkably, this also means that thin current sheet has\na universal fluid resistance depending only on its length to width ratio and to\n$v_A/c$.\n", "  Arterial wall shear stress (WSS) parameters are widely used for prediction of\nthe initiation and development of atherosclerosis and arterial pathologies.\nTraditional clinical evaluation of arterial condition relies on correlations of\nWSS parameters with average flow rate (Q) and heart rate (HR) measurements. We\nshow that for pulsating flow waveforms in a straight tube with flow reversals\nthat lead to significant reciprocating WSS, the measurements of HR and Q are\nnot sufficient for prediction of WSS parameters. Therefore, we suggest adding a\nthird quantity - known as the pulsatility index (PI) - which is defined as the\npeak-to-peak flow rate amplitude normalized by Q. We examine several pulsating\nflow waveforms with and without flow reversals using a simulation of a\nWomersley model in a straight rigid tube and validate the simulations through\nexperimental study using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The results indicate\nthat clinically relevant WSS parameters such as the percentage of negative WSS\n(P[%]), oscillating shear index (OSI) and the ratio of minimum to maximum shear\nstress rates (min/max), are better predicted when the PI is used in conjunction\nwith HR and Q. Therefore, we propose to use PI as an additional and essential\ndiagnostic quantity for improved predictability of the reciprocating WSS.\n", "  Below the critical temperature $T_c\\simeq 600 K$, an iso-structural\ntransition, named $\\gamma$-$\\alpha$ transition,can be induced in Cerium by\napplying pressure. This transition is first-order, and is accompanied by a\nsizable volume collapse. A conclusive theoretical explanation of this\nintriguing phenomenon has still not been achieved, and the physical pictures\nproposed so far are still under debate. In this work, we illustrate\nzero-temperature first-principle calculations which clearly demonstrate that\nthe $\\gamma$-$\\alpha$ transition is induced by the interplay between the\nelectron-electron Coulomb interaction and the spin-orbit coupling. We address\nthe still unresolved problem on the existence of a second low-$T$ critical\npoint, i.e., whether the energetic effects alone are sufficient or not to\ninduce the $\\gamma$-$\\alpha$ transition at zero temperature.\n", "  Helium is generally understood to be chemically inert and this is due to its\nextremely stable closed-shell electronic configuration, zero electron affinity\nand an unsurpassed ionization potential. It is not known to form\nthermodynamically stable compounds, except a few inclusion compounds. Here,\nusing the ab initio evolutionary algorithm USPEX and subsequent high-pressure\nsynthesis in a diamond anvil cell, we report the discovery of a\nthermodynamically stable compound of helium and sodium, Na2He, which has a\nfluorite-type structure and is stable at pressures >113 GPa. We show that the\npresence of He atoms causes strong electron localization and makes this\nmaterial insulating. This phase is an electride, with electron pairs localized\nin interstices, forming eight-centre two-electron bonds within empty Na8 cubes.\nWe also predict the existence of Na2HeO with a similar structure at pressures\nabove 15 GPa.\n", "  We present the results of several detailed numerical N-body simulations of\nthe dynamical interactions of two equal mass disc galaxies. Both galaxies are\nembedded in spherical halos of dark matter and contain central bulges. Our\nanalysis of the dynamical evolution of the binary system focuses on the\nmorphological evolution of the stellar distribution of the discs. The satellite\ngalaxy has coplanar or polar disc orientation in relation to the disc of the\nprimary galaxy and their initial orbits are prograde eccentric ($e=0.1$,\n$e=0.4$ or $e=0.7$). Both galaxies have mass and size comparable to the Milky\nWay. We show that the merger of the two disc galaxies, depending on the\nrelative orientation of the discs, can yield either a disc or lenticular\nremnant, instead of an elliptical one. These are the first simulations in the\nliterature to show the formation of S0-like galaxies from protracted binary\ngalaxy interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the time to merger\nincreases linearly with the initial apocentric distance between the galaxies,\nand decreases with the initial orbital eccentricity. We also show that the\ntidal forces of the discs excite transient $m=1$ and $m=2$ wave modes, i.e.,\nlopsidedness, spiral arms, and bars. However, after the merging of the discs,\nsuch instabilities fade completely, and the remnant is thicker and bigger than\nthe original discs. The maximum relative amplitude of these waves is at most\nabout 15 times greater compared to the control case. of these two wave modes.\nFinally, the disc settles down quickly, after the merger, in less than one\nouter disc rotation period.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the relative time delay of photoelectrons\noriginating from the different subshells (2s and 2p) of neon. This quantity was\nmeasured via attosecond streaking and studied theoretically by Schultze et al.\n[Science 328, 1658 (2010)]. A substantial discrepancy was found between the\nmeasured and the calculated values of the relative time delay. Several\ntheoretical studies has been put forward to resolve this issue, e.g. by\nincluding correlation effects. In the present paper we explore the directional\ndependence of the photoelectron emission and the consequences for the inferred\ntime delay. Our quantum mechanical calculations for an electron subject to\nlaser fields and an effective single particle potential show that the time\ndelay is indeed strongly angular dependent. Compared to strict forward emission\nwe find that accounting for emission within a cone of 45 deg aperture, leads to\na substantially increase of the relative time delay.\n", "  The Thomas-Fermi approach to galaxy structure determines selfconsistently and\nnonlinearly the gravitational potential of the fermionic WDM particles given\ntheir quantum distribution function f(E). Galaxy magnitudes as the halo radius\nr_h, mass M_h, velocity dispersion and phase space density are obtained. We\nderive the general equation of state for galaxies (relation between the\npressure and the density), and provide an analytic expression. This clearly\nexhibits two regimes: (i) Large diluted galaxies for M_h > 2.3 10^6 Msun\ncorresponding to temperatures T_0 > 0.017 K, described by the classical self\ngravitating WDM Boltzman regime and (ii) Compact dwarf galaxies for 1.6 10^6\nMsun > M_h>M_{h,min}=30000 (2keV/m)^{16/5} Msun, T_0<0.011 K described by the\nquantum fermionic WDM regime. The T_0=0 degenerate quantum limit predicts the\nmost compact and smallest galaxy (minimal radius and mass M_{h,min}). All\nmagnitudes in the diluted regime exhibit square root of M_h scaling laws and\nare universal functions of r/r_h when normalized to their values at the origin\nor at r_h. We find that universality in galaxies (for M_h > 10^6 Msun) reflects\nthe WDM perfect gas behaviour. These theoretical results contrasted to robust\nand independent sets of galaxy data remarkably reproduce the observations. For\nthe small galaxies, 10^6>M_h>M_{h,min} corresponding to effective temperatures\nT_0 < 0.017 K, the equation of state is galaxy dependent and the profiles are\nno more universal. These non-universal properties in small galaxies account to\nthe quantum physics of the WDM fermions in the compact regime. Our results are\nindependent of any WDM particle physics model, they only follow from the\ngravitational interaction of the WDM particles and their fermionic quantum\nnature.\n", "  We study the spectral properties of discrete Schr\\\"odinger operators with\npotentials given by primitive invertible substitution sequences (or by Sturmian\nsequences whose rotation angle has an eventually periodic continued fraction\nexpansion, a strictly larger class than primitive invertible substitution\nsequences). It is known that operators from this family have spectra which are\nCantor sets of zero Lebesgue measure. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of\nthis set tends to $1$ as coupling constant $\\lambda$ tends to $0$. Moreover, we\nalso show that at small coupling constant, all gaps allowed by the gap labeling\ntheorem are open and furthermore open linearly with respect to $\\lambda$.\nAdditionally, we show that, in the small coupling regime, the density of states\nmeasure for an operator in this family is exact dimensional. The dimension of\nthe density of states measure is strictly smaller than the Hausdorff dimension\nof the spectrum and tends to $1$ as $\\lambda$ tends to $0$.\n", "  We investigate the collective electron dynamics in a recently proposed\ngraphene-based terahertz emitter under the influence of the radiative damping\neffect, which is included self-consistently in a molecular dynamics approach.\nWe show that under appropriate conditions synchronization of the dynamics of\nsingle electrons takes place, leading to a rise of the oscillating component of\nthe charge current. The synchronization time depends dramatically on the\napplied dc electric field and electron scattering rate, and is roughly\ninversely proportional to the radiative damping rate that is determined by the\ncarrier concentration and the geometrical parameters of the device. The\nemission spectra in the synchronized state, determined by the oscillating\ncurrent component, are analyzed. The effective generation of higher harmonics\nfor large values of the radiative damping strength is demonstrated.\n", "  This paper aims to investigate/map the effects that perturbations applied to\nan accretion disk might produce on the registered Light Curves (LC). The case\nof accretion disks around supermassive active black holes (AGNs) is studied\nwith the goal to explain some of the statistical properties of the observed\nIntraDay Variability (IDV). The region producing optical IDV is perturbed by\nallowing it to develop a mass density of a fractional Brownian Motion-like\ntype. The light curves and spectral slopes are calculated and compared to\nobservational data for different Hurst parameters. The spectral slopes of the\nsimulated light curves vary in the range $(0.4,2.5)$. The agreement with\nobservational data shows that a magnetized disk subjected to stochastic\nperturbations can produce some of the features observed in the light curves.\n", "  Eclipsing binary stars have long served as benchmark systems to measure\nfundamental stellar properties. In the past few decades, asteroseismology - the\nstudy of stellar pulsations - has emerged as a new powerful tool to study the\nstructure and evolution of stars across the HR diagram. Pulsating stars in\neclipsing binary systems are particularly valuable since fundamental properties\n(such as radii and masses) can determined using two independent techniques.\nFurthermore, independently measured properties from binary orbits can be used\nto improve asteroseismic modeling for pulsating stars in which mode\nidentifications are not straightforward. This contribution provides a review of\nasteroseismic detections in eclipsing binary stars, with a focus on space-based\nmissions such as CoRoT and Kepler, and empirical tests of asteroseismic scaling\nrelations for stochastic (\"solar-like\") oscillations.\n", "  We provide a general theoretical framework allowing us to extend the\nclassical Lie theory for partial differential equations to the case of\nequations of fractional order. We propose a general prolongation formula for\nthe study of Lie symmetries in the case of an arbitrary finite number of\nindependent variables. We also prove the Lie theorem in the case of fractional\ndifferential equations, showing that the proper space for the analysis of these\nsymmetries is the infinite dimensional jet space.\n", "  For interacting electrons in solids, Heisenberg's equation is used to\ncalculate the distribution in energy of transitions induced by adding an\nelectron to an atomic-like spin orbital. This is the projected density of\ntransitions which includes transitions between grounds states, as well as\nbetween other states differing by one electron. The energy of a ground state is\nthen calculated as the sum of the least energies of transitions starting with\nthe ground state of no electrons and adding one electron with each transition.\nThis method is applied to the construction of ground states for a simple model\nof the hydrogen molecule, and to interaction effects on the relative cohesion\nof HCP and FCC structures of transition metals.\n", "  Using overlapping fields with space-based Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and\nground-based Subaru Telescope imaging we identify a population of blended\ngalaxies that are blended to such a large degree that they are detected as\nsingle objects in the ground-based monochromatic imaging, which we label as\n'ambiguous blends'. For deep imaging data, such as the depth targeted with the\nLarge Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the ambiguous blend population is both\nlarge ($\\sim 14$%) and has a distribution of ellipticities that is different\nfrom that of unblended objects in a way that will likely be important for the\nweak lensing measurements. Most notably, for a limiting magnitude of $i \\sim\n27$ we find that ambiguous blending results in a ~14% increase in shear noise\n(or ~12% decrease in the effective projected number density of lensed galaxies;\nneff) due to 1) larger intrinsic ellipticity dispersion, 2) a scaling with the\ngalaxy number density $N_{gal}$ that is shallower than 1/$\\sqrt{N_{gal}}$. For\nthe LSST Gold Sample ($i < 25.3$) there is a ~7% increase in shear noise (or\n~7% decrease in $n_{eff}$). More importantly than these increases in the shear\nnoise, we find that the ellipticity distribution of ambiguous blends has an RMS\n13% larger than that of non-blended galaxies. Given the need of future weak\nlensing surveys to constrain the ellipticity distribution of galaxies to better\nthan a percent in order to mitigate cosmic shear multiplicative biases, the\ndifferent ellipticity distribution of ambiguous blends could be a dominant\nsystematic if unaccounted for.\n", "  The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism has been applied to a variety of systems\nranging from low temperature Bose-Einstein condensations to grand unification\nscales in particle physics and cosmology and from classical phase transitions\nto quantum phase transitions. Here we show that finite-time scaling (FTS)\nprovides a detailed improved understanding of the mechanism. In particular, the\nfinite time scale, which is introduced by the external driving (or quenching)\nand results in FTS, is the origin of the division of the adiabatic regimes from\nthe impulse regime in the KZ mechanism. The origin of the KZ scaling for the\ndefect density, generated during the driving through a critical point, is not\nthat the correlation length ceases growing in the nonadiabatic impulse regime,\nbut rather, is that it is taken over by the effective finite length scale\ncorresponding to the finite time scale. We also show that FTS accounts well for\nand improves the scaling ansatz proposed recently by Liu, Polkovnikov, and\nSandvik [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 89}, 054307 (2014)]. Further, we show that their\nuniversal power-law scaling form applies only to some observables in cooling\nbut not to heating. Even in cooling, it is invalid either when an appropriate\nexternal field is present. However, this finite-time-finite-size scaling calls\nfor caution in application of FTS. Detailed scaling behaviors of the FTS and\nfinite-size scaling, along with their crossover, are explicitly demonstrated,\nwith the dynamic critical exponent $z$ being estimated for two- and\nthree-dimensional Ising models under the usual Metropolis dynamics. These\nvalues of $z$ are found to give rise to better data collapses than the extant\nvalues do in most cases but take on different values in heating and cooling in\nboth two- and three-dimensional spaces.\n", "  We analyze the spiral structure that results in a numerical simulation of a\ngalactic disk with stellar and gaseous components evolving in a potential that\nincludes an axisymmetric halo and bulge. We perform a second simulation without\nthe gas component to observe how it affects the spiral structure in the disk.\nTo quantify this, we use a Fourier analysis and obtain values for the pitch\nangle and the velocity of the self-excited spiral pattern of the disk. The\nresults show a tighter spiral in the simulation with gaseous component. The\nspiral structure is consistent with a superposition of waves, each with a\nconstant pattern velocity in given radial ranges.\n", "  The conditions within the ionization front of a quasar during reionization (T\n~ 30,000 K, neutral hydrogen fraction ~ 0.5) are ideal for producing\nLyman-alpha emission via collisional excitation of hydrogen atoms. Observations\nof this emission, which could subtend >10 arcmin$^2$ on the sky, would\ndefinitively demonstrate the presence of a neutral intergalactic medium at the\nobserved epoch, placing valuable constraints on the progress of reionization.\nWe find that the expected Lyman-alpha surface brightness is significantly\nweaker than previously determined and may be impossible to observe with current\nand near-future instruments. Past work calculated the Lyman-alpha emission from\na quasar ionization front in a homogeneous medium with a clumping factor\napproximation to account for inhomogeneities. We find using 1D radiative\ntransfer calculations that this approximation overestimates the emission by a\nfactor of >3. Our calculations model the propagation of ionizing photons and\ncompute the Lyman-alpha emission from quasar ionization fronts on sightlines\nfrom a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation at z = 7.1. To better understand\nthe physical properties of the emission, we also develop an analytic model that\naccurately describes the results of the full radiative transfer calculation.\n", "  Intrinsic alignments are believed to be a major source of systematics for\nfuture generation of weak gravitational lensing surveys like Euclid or LSST.\nDirect measurements of the alignment of the projected light distribution of\ngalaxies in wide field imaging data seem to agree on a contamination at a level\nof a few per cent of the shear correlation functions, although the amplitude of\nthe effect depends on the population of galaxies considered. Given this\ndependency, it is difficult to use dark matter-only simulations as the sole\nresource to predict and control intrinsic alignments. We report here estimates\non the level of intrinsic alignment in the cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulation Horizon-AGN that could be a major source of systematic errors in\nweak gravitational lensing measurements. In particular, assuming that the spin\nof galaxies is a good proxy for their ellipticity, we show how those spins are\nspatially correlated and how they couple to the tidal field in which they are\nembedded. We also present theoretical calculations that illustrate and\nqualitatively explain the observed signals.\n", "  Tidal torque theory and simulations of large scale structure predict spin\nvectors of massive galaxies should be coplanar with sheets in the cosmic web.\nRecently demonstrated, the giants (K$_{s}$ $\\leq$ -22.5 mag) in the Local\nVolume beyond the Local Sheet have spin vectors directed close to the plane of\nthe Local Supercluster, supporting the predictions of Tidal Torque Theory.\nHowever, the giants in the Local Sheet encircling the Local Group display a\ndistinctly different arrangement, suggesting that the mass asymmetry of the\nLocal Group or its progenitor torqued them from their primordial spin\ndirections. To investigate the origin of the spin alignment of giants locally,\nanalogues of the Local Sheet were identified in the SDSS DR9. Similar to the\nLocal Sheet, analogues have an interacting pair of disk galaxies isolated from\nthe remaining sheet members. Modified sheets in which there is no interacting\npair of disk galaxies were identified as a control sample.\n  Galaxies in face-on control sheets do not display axis ratios predominantly\nweighted toward low values, contrary to the expectation of tidal torque theory.\nFor face-on and edge-on sheets, the distribution of axis ratios for galaxies in\nanalogues is distinct from that in controls with a confidence of 97.6 $\\%$ $\\&$\n96.9$\\%$, respectively. This corroborates the hypothesis that an interacting\npair can affect spin directions of neighbouring galaxies.\n", "  Using the Horizon-AGN simulation we find a mass dependent spin orientation\ntrend for galaxies: the spin of low-mass, rotation-dominated, blue,\nstar-forming galaxies are preferentially aligned with their closest filament,\nwhereas high-mass, velocity dispersion- supported, red quiescent galaxies tend\nto possess a spin perpendicular to these filaments. We explore the physical\nmechanisms driving galactic spin swings and quantify how much mergers and\nsmooth accretion re-orient them relative to their host filaments and impact\ntheir shape. In particular, we analyze the effect of dispersion and morphology\nof galaxies and discuss potential tracers for prospective surveys.\n", "  The statistics of shear peaks have been shown to provide valuable\ncosmological information beyond the power spectrum, and will be an important\nconstraint of models of cosmology with the large survey areas provided by\nforthcoming astronomical surveys. Surveys include masked areas due to bright\nstars, bad pixels etc, which must be accounted for in producing constraints on\ncosmology from shear maps. We advocate a forward-modeling approach, where the\nimpact of masking (and other survey artifacts) are accounted for in the\ntheoretical prediction of cosmological parameters, rather than removed from\nsurvey data. We use masks based on the Deep Lens Survey, and explore the impact\nof up to 37% of the survey area being masked on LSST and DES-scale surveys. By\nreconstructing maps of aperture mass, the masking effect is smoothed out,\nresulting in up to 14% smaller statistical uncertainties compared to simply\nreducing the survey area by the masked area. We show that, even in the presence\nof large survey masks, the bias in cosmological parameter estimation produced\nin the forward-modeling process is ~1%, dominated by bias caused by limited\nsimulation volume. We also explore how this potential bias scales with survey\narea and find that small survey areas are more significantly impacted by the\ndifferences in cosmological structure in the data and simulated volumes, due to\ncosmic variance.\n", "  Post-starburst galaxies are in the transitional stage between blue,\nstar-forming galaxies and red, quiescent galaxies, and therefore hold important\nclues for our understanding of galaxy evolution. In this paper, we\nsystematically searched for and identified a large sample of post-starburst\ngalaxies from the spectroscopic dataset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nData Release 9. In total, we found more than 6000 objects with redshifts\nbetween $z\\sim0.05$ and $z\\sim1.3$, making this the largest sample of\npost-starburst galaxies in the literature. We calculated the luminosity\nfunction of the post-starburst galaxies using two uniformly selected\nsubsamples: the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample and the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey CMASS Sample. The luminosity functions are reasonably fit\nby half-Gaussian functions. The peak magnitudes shift as a function of redshift\nfrom $M\\sim-23.5$ at $z\\sim0.8$ to $M\\sim-20.3$ at $z\\sim0.1$. This is\nconsistent with the downsizing trend, whereby more massive galaxies form\nearlier than low-mass galaxies. We compared the mass of the post-starburst\nstellar population found in our sample to the decline of the global\nstar-formation rate and found that only a small amount ($\\sim1\\%$) of all\nstar-formation quenching in the redshift range $z=0.2-0.7$ results in\npost-starburst galaxies in the luminosity range our sample is sensitive to.\nTherefore, luminous post-starburst galaxies are not the place where most of the\ndecline in star-formation rate of the universe is happening.\n", "  Primary energy spectrum of cosmic rays exhibits a knee at about $3$ PeV where\na change in the spectral index occurs. Despite many efforts the origin of such\na feature of the spectrum is not satisfactorily solved yet. Here it is proposed\nthat the steepening of the spectrum beyond the knee may be a consequence of\nmass distribution of progenitor of cosmic ray source. The proposed speculative\nmodel can account all the major observed features about cosmic rays without\ninvoking any fine tuning to match flux or spectra at any energy point. The\nprediction of the proposed model regarding primary composition scenario beyond\nthe knee is quite different from most of the prevailing models of the knee and\nthereby can be discriminated from precise experimental measurement of the\nprimary composition.\n", "  We present the discovery of an extended ring of ultraviolet emission\nsurrounding the AGB star U Hya in archival observations performed by the Galaxy\nEvolution Explorer (GALEX). This is the third discovery of extended UV emission\nfrom a carbon AGB star and the first from an AGB star with a detached shell.\nFrom imaging and photometric analysis of the FUV and NUV images, we determined\nthat the ultraviolet ring has a radius of $\\sim 110^{\\prime\\prime}$, thus\nindicating that the emitting material is likely associated with the detached\nshell seen in the infrared. We find that scattering of the central point source\nof NUV and FUV emission by the dust shell is negligible. Moreover, we find that\nscattering of the interstellar radiation field by the dust shell can contribute\nat most $\\sim10%$ of the FUV flux. Morphological and photometric evidence\nsuggests that shocks caused by the star's motion through space and, possibly,\nshock-excited H$_2$ molecules are the most likely origins of the UV flux. In\ncontrast to previous examples of extended UV emission from AGB stars, the\nextended UV emission from U Hya does not show a bow shock-like structure, which\nis consistent with a lower space velocity and lower interstellar medium\ndensity. This suggests the detached dust shell is the source of the UV emitting\nmaterial and can be used to better understand the formation of detached shells.\n", "  Building galaxy merger trees from a state-of-the-art cosmological\nhydrodynamics simulation, Horizon-AGN, we perform a statistical study of how\nmergers and smooth accretion drive galaxy morphologic properties above $z > 1$.\nMore specifically, we investigate how stellar densities, effective radii and\nshape parameters derived from the inertia tensor depend on mergers of different\nmass ratios. We find strong evidence that smooth accretion tends to flatten\nsmall galaxies over cosmic time, leading to the formation of disks. On the\nother hand, mergers, and not only the major ones, exhibit a propensity to puff\nup and destroy stellar disks, confirming the origin of elliptical galaxies. We\nalso find that elliptical galaxies are more susceptible to grow in size through\nmergers than disc galaxies with a size-mass evolution $r \\prop M^{1.2}$ instead\nof $r \\prop M^{-0.5} - M^{0.5}$ depending on the merger mass ratio. The gas\ncontent drive the size-mass evolution due to merger with a faster size growth\nfor gas-poor galaxies $r \\prop M^2$ than for gas-rich galaxies $r \\prop M$.\n", "  In this paper we study analytical solutions for fermion localization in\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) models. We show that there exist special couplings between\nscalar fields and fermions giving us discrete massive localizable modes.\nBesides this we obtain resonances in some models by analytical methods.\n", "  In this article we present an effective Hamiltonian approach for Discrete\nTime Quantum Random Walk. A form of the Hamiltonian for one dimensional quantum\nwalk has been prescribed, utilizing the fact that Hamiltonians are the\ngenerators of time translations. Then an attempt has been made to generalize\nthe techniques to higher dimensions. We find that the Hamiltonian can be\nwritten as the sum of a Weyl Hamiltonian and a Dirac comb potential. The time\nevolution operator obtained from this prescribed Hamiltonian is in complete\nagreement with that of the standard approach. But in higher dimension we find\nthat the time evolution operator is additive, instead of being multiplicative\n\\cite{Chandrasekhar:2013SREP08229}. We showed that in case of two-step walk,\neffectively the time evolution operator can have multiplicative form. In case\nof a square lattice, quantum walk has been studied computationally for\ndifferent coins and the results for both the additive and the multiplicative\napproaches have been compared. Using the Graphene Hamiltonian the walk has been\nstudied on a Graphene lattice and we conclude the preference of additive\napproach over the multiplicative one.\n", "  We develop an extension of the Gutzwiller approximation to finite\ntemperatures based on the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle. Our method does\nnot rely on any entropy inequality, and is substantially more accurate than the\napproaches proposed in previous works. We apply our theory to the single-band\nHubbard model at different fillings, and show that our results compare\nquantitatively well with dynamical mean field theory in the metallic phase. We\ndiscuss potential applications of our technique within the framework of first\nprinciple calculations.\n", "  We present a generalization of Minkowski's classic theorem on the\nreconstruction of tetrahedra from algebraic data to homogeneously curved\nspaces. Euclidean notions such as the normal vector to a face are replaced by\nLevi-Civita holonomies around each of the tetrahedron's faces. This allows the\nreconstruction of both spherical and hyperbolic tetrahedra within a unified\nframework. A new type of hyperbolic simplex is introduced in order for all the\nsectors encoded in the algebraic data to be covered. Generalizing the phase\nspace of shapes associated to flat tetrahedra leads to group valued moment maps\nand quasi-Poisson spaces. These discrete geometries provide a natural arena for\nconsidering the quantization of gravity including a cosmological constant. A\nconcrete realization of this is provided by the relation with the spin-network\nstates of loop quantum gravity. This work therefore provides a bottom-up\njustification for the emergence of deformed gauge symmetries and quantum groups\nin 3+1 dimensional covariant loop quantum gravity in the presence of a\ncosmological constant.\n", "  The inclusion of the factor $\\ln (1/N!)$ in the thermodynamic entropy\nproposed by Gibbs is shown to be equivalent to the validity of the fluctuation\ntheorem with absolute irreversibility for gas mixing.\n", "  Making use of a set of detailed potential models for normal spiral galaxies,\nwe analyze the disk stellar orbital dynamics as the structural and dynamical\nparameters of the spiral arms (mass, pattern speed and pitch angle) are\ngradually modified. With this comprehensive study of ordered and chaotic\nbehavior, we constructed an assemblage of orbitally supported galactic models\nand plausible parameters for orbitally self-consistent spiral arms models. We\nfind that, to maintain orbital support for the spiral arms, the spiral arm\nmass, M$_{sp}$, must decrease with the increase of the pitch angle, $i$; if $i$\nis smaller than $\\sim10\\deg$, M$_{sp}$ can be as large as $\\sim7\\%$, $\\sim6\\%$,\n$\\sim5\\%$ of the disk mass, for Sa, Sb, and Sc galaxies, respectively. If $i$\nincreases up to $\\sim25\\deg$, the maximum M$_{sp}$ is $\\sim1\\%$ of the disk\nmass independently in this case of morphological type. For values larger than\nthese limits, spiral arms would likely act as transient features. Regarding the\nlimits posed by extreme chaotic behavior, we find a strong restriction on the\nmaximum plausible values of spiral arms parameters on disk galaxies beyond\nwhich, chaotic behavior becomes pervasive. We find that for $i$ smaller than\n$\\sim20\\deg$, $\\sim25\\deg$, $\\sim30\\deg$, for Sa, Sb, and Sc galaxies,\nrespectively, M$_{sp}$ can go up to $\\sim10\\%$, of the mass of the disk. If the\ncorresponding $i$ is around $\\sim40\\deg$, $\\sim45\\deg$, $\\sim50\\deg$, M$_{sp}$\nis $\\sim1\\%$, $\\sim2\\%$, $\\sim3\\%$ of the mass of the disk. Beyond these\nvalues, chaos dominates phase space, destroying the main periodic and the\nneighboring quasi-periodic orbits.\n", "  In this work, we explore the cosmological implications of different baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) data, including the BAO data extracted by using the\nspherically averaged one-dimensional galaxy clustering (GC) statistics\n(hereafter BAO1) and the BAO data obtained by using the anisotropic\ntwo-dimensional GC statistics (hereafter BAO2). To make a comparison, we also\ntake into account the case without BAO data (hereafter NO BAO). Firstly, making\nuse of these BAO data, as well as the SNLS3 type Ia supernovae sample and the\nPlanck distance priors data, we give the cosmological constraints of the\n$\\Lambda$CDM, the $w$CDM, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model. Then,\nwe discuss the impacts of different BAO data on cosmological consquences,\nincluding its effects on parameter space, equation of state (EoS), figure of\nmerit (FoM), deceleration-acceleration transition redshift, Hubble parameter\n$H(z)$, deceleration parameter $q(z)$, statefinder hierarchy $S^{(1)}_3(z)$,\n$S^{(1)}_4(z)$ and cosmic age $t(z)$. We find that: (1) NO BAO data always give\na smallest fractional matter density $\\Omega_{m0}$, a largest fractional\ncurvature density $\\Omega_{k0}$ and a largest Hubble constant $h$; in contrast,\nBAO1 data always give a largest $\\Omega_{m0}$, a smallest $\\Omega_{k0}$ and a\nsmallest $h$. (2) For the $w$CDM and the CPL model, NO BAO data always give a\nlargest EoS $w$; in contrast, BAO2 data always give a smallest $w$. (3)\nCompared with the case of BAO1, BAO2 data always give a slightly larger FoM,\nand thus can give a cosmological constraint with a slightly better accuracy.\n(4) The impacts of different BAO data on the cosmic evolution and the comic age\nare very small, and can not be distinguished by using various dark energy\ndiagnosis and the cosmic age data.\n", "  The occurrence of fractional revival in quantum spin chains is examined.\nAnalytic models where this phenomenon can be exhibited in exact solutions are\nprovided. It is explained that spin chains with fractional revival can be\nobtained by isospectral deformations of spin chains with perfect state\ntransfer.\n", "  The one-variable non-symmetric Wilson polynomials are shown to coincide with\nthe Bannai-Ito polynomials. The isomorphism between the corresponding\ndegenerate double affine Hecke algebra of type $(C_1^{\\vee}, C_1)$ and the\nBannai-Ito algebra is established. The Bannai-Ito polynomials are seen to\nsatisfy an orthogonality relation with respect to a positive-definite and\ncontinuous measure on the real line. A non-compact form of the Bannai-Ito\nalgebra is introduced and a four-parameter family of its infinite-dimensional\nand self-adjoint representations is exhibited.\n", "  We prove the optimal endpoint Strichartz estimates for Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation with charge transfer potentials and a general source term in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\\geq3$. The proof is based on using the projection on the\nscattering states defined implicitly in Rodnianski, Schlag and Soffer\n\\cite{RSS1}, and asymptotic completeness for such systems. The method works as\nwell in the matrix non-selfadjoint case.\n", "  Systems with long range interactions display some anomalies when its dynamics\nand thermodynamics are studied below certain conditions. Among these anomalies\nare the quasi- stationary states, which are exacerbated because of special\ninitial conditions that are used here. We present in this letter a new\nHamiltonian whose potential is inspired in the two-dipole interaction. An\nanalytical solution is obtained for the equilibrium in the canonical ensemble\nthat is coincident with the one obtained from computational simulations.\nHowever, results from this model presents a kind of nonequivalence of ensembles\nin long-living states before arriving to equilibrium. Thus, a complete\ncharacterization is made for the nonequilibrium through molecular dynamics. In\nwhich, novel quasi-stationary states are observed due to the long range\ninteractions.\n", "  We use cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation in a Milky Way\n(MW)-sized halo started from identical initial conditions to investigate the\nevolution of galaxy sizes, baryon fractions, morphologies and angular momenta\nin runs with different parameters of the star formation--feedback cycle. Our\nfiducial model with a high local star formation efficiency, which results in\nefficient feedback, produces a realistic late-type galaxy that matches the\nevolution of basic properties of late-type galaxies: stellar mass, disk size,\nmorphology dominated by a kinematically cold disk, stellar and gas surface\ndensity profiles, and specific angular momentum. We argue that feedback's role\nin this success is twofold: (1) removal of low-angular momentum gas and (2)\nmaintaining a low disk-to-halo mass fraction which suppresses disk\ninstabilities that lead to angular momentum redistribution and a central\nconcentration of baryons. However, our model with a low local star formation\nefficiency, but large energy input per supernova, chosen to produce a galaxy\nwith a similar star formation history as our fiducial model, leads to a highly\nirregular galaxy with no kinematically cold component, overly extended stellar\ndistribution and low angular momentum. This indicates that only when feedback\nis allowed to become vigorous via locally efficient star formation in dense\ncold gas, resulting galaxy sizes, gas/stellar surface density profiles and\nstellar disk angular momenta agree with observed $z=0$ galaxies.\n", "  We develop a variational scheme called \"Gutzwiller renormalization group\"\n(GRG), which enables us to calculate the ground state of Anderson impurity\nmodels (AIM) with arbitrary numerical precision. Our method can exploit the\nlow-entanglement property of the ground state in combination with the framework\nof the Gutzwiller wavefunction, and suggests that the ground state of the AIM\nhas a very simple structure, which can be represented very accurately in terms\nof a surprisingly small number of variational parameters. We perform benchmark\ncalculations of the single-band AIM that validate our theory and indicate that\nthe GRG might enable us to study complex systems beyond the reach of the other\nmethods presently available and pave the way to interesting generalizations,\ne.g., to nonequilibrium transport in nanostructures.\n", "  Secure random numbers are a fundamental element of many applications in\nscience, statistics, cryptography and more in general in security protocols. We\npresent a method that enables the generation of high-speed unpredictable random\nnumbers from the quadratures of an electromag- netic field without any\nassumption on the input state. The method allows to eliminate the numbers that\ncan be predict due the presence of classical and quantum side information. In\nparticular, we introduce a procedure to estimate a bound on the conditional\nmin-entropy based on the Entropic Uncertainty Principle for position and\nmomentum observables of infinite dimensional quantum sys- tems. By the above\nmethod, we experimentally demonstrated the generation of secure true random\nbits at a rate greater than 1 Gbit/s.\n", "  Optical counterparts can provide significant constraints on the physical\nnature of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). In this letter, we identify six\npoint sources in the error circle of a ULX in M82, namely M82 X-1, by\nregistering Chandra positions onto Hubble Space Telescope images. Two objects\nare considered as optical counterpart candidates of M82 X-1, which show F658N\nflux excess compared to the optical continuum that may suggest the existence of\nan accretion disk. The spectral energy distributions of the two candidates\nmatch well with the spectra for supergiants, with stellar types as F5-G0 and\nB5-G0, respectively. Deep spatially resolved spectroscopic follow-up and\ndetailed studies are needed to identify the true companion and confirm the\nproperties of this BH system.\n", "  We describe the optimal realization of entangling quantum gates for trapped\nions mediated by a dissipative bus mode. With suitably shaped control pulses\none can substantially decrease ion-phonon entanglement while maintaining the\nmediated interaction.\n", "  The kernel of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{n}$ Dirac-Dunkl operator is examined. The\nsymmetry algebra $\\mathcal{A}_{n}$ of the associated Dirac-Dunkl equation on\n$\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is determined and is seen to correspond to a higher rank\ngeneralization of the Bannai-Ito algebra. A basis for the polynomial\nnull-solutions of the Dirac-Dunkl operator is constructed. The basis elements\nare joint eigenfunctions of a maximal commutative subalgebra of\n$\\mathcal{A}_{n}$ and are given explicitly in terms of Jacobi polynomials. The\nsymmetry algebra is shown to act irreducibly on this basis via raising/lowering\noperators. A scalar realization of $\\mathcal{A}_{n}$ is proposed.\n", "  We show that quantum diffusion near the quantum critical point can provide a\nhighly very efficient mechanism of open-system quantum annealing. It is based\non the diffusion-mediated recombination of excitations. For an Ising spin chain\ncoupled to a bosonic bath, excitation diffusion in a transverse field sharply\nslows down as the system moves away from the quantum critical region. This\nleads to spatial correlations and effective freezing of the excitation density.\nWe find that obtaining an approximate solution via the diffusion-mediated\nquantum annealing can be faster than via closed-system quantum annealing or\nGlauber dynamics.\n", "  Multiparty quantum states are useful for a variety of quantum information and\ncomputation protocols. We define a multiparty entanglement measure based on\nlocal measurements on a multiparty quantum state, and an entanglement measure\naveraged on the post-measurement ensemble. Using the generalized geometric\nmeasure as the measure of multipartite entanglement for the ensemble, we\ndemonstrate, in the case of several well-known classes of multipartite pure\nstates, that the localized multipartite entanglement can exceed the\nentanglement present in the original state. We also show that measurement over\nmultiple parties may be beneficial in enhancing localizable multipartite\nentanglement. We point out that localizable generalized geometric measure\nfaithfully signals quantum critical phenomena in well-known quantum spin models\neven when considerable finite-size effect is present in the system.\n", "  Open quantum systems (OQS) cannot always be described with the Markov\napproximation, which requires a large separation of system and environment time\nscales. Here, we give an overview of some of the most important techniques\navailable to tackle the dynamics of an OQS beyond the Markov approximation.\nSome of these techniques, such as master equations, Heisenberg equations and\nstochastic methods, are based on solving the reduced OQS dynamics, while\nothers, such as path integral Monte Carlo or chain mapping approaches, are\nbased on solving the dynamics of the full system. We emphasize the physical\ninterpretation and derivation of the various approaches, explore how they are\nconnected and examine how different methods may be suitable for solving\ndifferent problems.\n", "  A group theoretical mechanism for unification of local gauge and spacetime\nsymmetries is introduced. No-go theorems prohibiting such unification are\ncircumvented by slightly relaxing the usual requirement on the gauge group:\nonly the so called Levi factor of the gauge group needs to be compact\nsemisimple, not the entire gauge group. This allows a non-conventional\nsupersymmetry-like extension of the gauge group, glueing together the gauge and\nspacetime symmetries, but not needing any new exotic gauge particles. It is\nshown that this new relaxed requirement on the gauge group is nothing but the\nminimal condition for energy positivity. The mechanism is demonstrated to be\nmathematically possible and physically plausible on a U(1) based gauge theory\nsetting. The unified group, being an extension of the group of spacetime\nsymmetries, is shown to be different than that of the conventional\nsupersymmetry group, thus overcoming the McGlinn and Coleman-Mandula no-go\ntheorems in a non-supersymmetric way.\n", "  Control of dopants in silicon remains the most important approach to\ntailoring the properties of electronic materials for integrated circuits, with\nGroup V impurities the most important n-type dopants. At the same time, silicon\nis finding new applications in coherent quantum devices, thanks to the\nmagnetically quiet environment it provides for the impurity orbitals. The\nionization energies and the shape of the dopant orbitals depend on the surfaces\nand interfaces with which they interact. The location of the dopant and local\nenvironment effects will therefore determine the functionality of both future\nquantum information processors and next-generation semiconductor devices. Here\nwe match observed dopant wavefunctions from low-temperature scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy (STM) to images simulated from first-principles density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations. By this combination of experiment and theory we\nprecisely determine the substitutional sites of neutral As dopants between 5\nand 15A below the Si(001):H surface. In the process we gain a full\nunderstanding of the interaction of the donor-electron state with the surface,\nand hence of the transition between the bulk dopant (with its delocalised\nhydrogenic orbital) and the previously studied dopants in the surface layer.\n", "  In this paper, we address the implications when a homogeneous dust model is\nconsidered for a scenario of gravitational collapse in the context of\nEddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory. In order to describe the\ndynamical evolution of the collapse, we present an effective equation, which\nconstitutes the first order corrections, in EiBI coupling parameter $\\kappa$,\nto Einstein's field equations. The geometry outside the collapsing object is\nderived by imposing the standard Darmois-Israel junction conditions at the\nboundary surface of the dust. This induces an effective matter source in the\nouter region which gives rise to a non-singular, non-Schwarzschild geometry at\nthe final state of the collapse. For this exterior geometry, we find the\nthreshold of mass for the formation of the black hole. This provides a cut-off\nover $\\kappa$ as $|\\kappa|=5.1\\times10^{-97} ~kg^{-1}\\cdot m^3$.\n", "  We show that curvature induced particle production at reheating generates\nadiabatic dark matter if there are non-minimally coupled spectator scalars\nweakly coupled to visible matter. The observed dark matter abundance implies an\nupper bound on spectator masses $m$ and non-minimal coupling values $\\xi$. For\nexample, assuming quadratic inflation, instant reheating and a single spectator\nscalar with only gravitational couplings, the observed dark matter abundance is\nobtained for $m\\sim 0.1$ GeV and $\\xi \\sim 1$. Larger mass and coupling values\nof the spectator are excluded as they would lead to overproduction of dark\nmatter.\n", "  We present next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD predictions to $W^+W^-$ production\nin association with up to three jets at hadron colliders. We include\ncontributions from couplings of the $W$ bosons to light quarks as well as\ntrilinear vector couplings. These processes are used in vector-boson coupling\nmeasurements, are background to Higgs signals and are needed to constrain many\nnew physics scenarios. For the first time NLO QCD predictions are shown for\nelectroweak di-vector boson production with three jets at a hadron collider. We\nshow total and differential cross sections for the LHC with proton\ncenter-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV. To perform the calculation we employ\non-shell and unitarity methods implemented in the BlackHat library along with\nthe SHERPA package. We have produced event files that can be accessed for\nfuture dedicated studies.\n", "  Accretion discs and black holes (BHs) have angular momenta that are generally\nmisaligned with respect to each other, which can lead to warps in the discs and\nbends in any jets produced. We consider a disc that is misaligned at large\nradii and torqued by Lense-Thirring (LT) precession and a Blandford-Znajek (BZ)\njet torque. We consider a variety of disc states that include radiatively\ninefficient thick discs, radiatively efficient thin discs, and super-Eddington\naccretion discs. The magnetic field strength of the BZ jet is chosen as either\nfrom standard equipartition arguments or from magnetically arrested disc (MAD)\nsimulations. We show that standard thin accretion discs can reach spin-disc\nalignment out to large radii long before LT would play a role, as caused by the\nslow infall time that gives even a weak BZ jet time to align the disc. We show\nthat geometrically thick radiatively inefficient discs and super-Eddington\ndiscs in the MAD state reach disc-spin alignment near the black hole when\ndensity profiles are shallow as in magnetohydrodynamical simulations, while the\nBZ jet aligns discs with steep density profiles (as in advection-dominated\naccretion flows) with the BH spin out to larger radii. Our results imply that\nthe BZ jet torque should affect the cosmological evolution of BH spin magnitude\nand direction, BH spin measurements in active galactic nuclei and X-ray\nbinaries, and the interpretations for Event Horizon Telescope observations of\ndiscs or jets in strong-field gravity regimes.\n", "  We investigated whether outward Planetesimal Driven Migration (PDM) takes\nplace or not in simulations when the self gravity of planetesimals is included.\nWe performed $N$-body simulations of planetesimal disks with large width (0.7 -\n4AU) which ranges over the ice line. The simulations consisted of two stages.\nThe first stage simulations were carried out to see the runaway growth phase\nusing the planetesimals of initially the same mass. The runaway growth took\nplace both at the inner edge of the disk and at the region just outside the ice\nline. This result was utilized for the initial setup of the second stage\nsimulations in which the runaway bodies just outside the ice line were replaced\nby the protoplanets with about the isolation mass. In the second stage\nsimulations, the outward migration of the protoplanet was followed by the\nstopping of the migration due to the increase of the random velocity of the\nplanetesimals. Due to this increase of random velocities, one of the PDM\ncriteria derived in Minton and Levison (2014) was broken. In the current\nsimulations, the effect of the gas disk is not considered. It is likely that\nthe gas disk plays an important role in planetesimal driven migration, and we\nplan to study its effect in future papers.\n", "  We start a series of studies of the excitation of an optical target by\nquantum light. In this first part, we introduce the problematic and address the\nfirst case of interest, that of exciting the quantum harmonic oscillator,\ncorresponding to, e.g., a single-mode passive cavity or a non-interacting\nbosonic field. We introduce a mapping of the Hilbert space that allows to chart\nusefully the accessible regions. We then consider the quantum excitation from\nsingle photon sources in the form of a two-level system under various regimes\nof (classical) pumping: incoherent, coherent and in the Mollow triplet regime.\nWe close this first opus with an overview of the material to be covered in the\nsubsequent papers.\n", "  After photon absorption, electrons from a dispersive band of a solid require\na finite time in the photoemission process before being photoemitted as free\nparticles, in line with recent attosecondresolved photoemission experiments.\nAccording to the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith model, the time delay is due to a phase\nshift of different transitions that occur in the process. Such a phase shift is\nalso at the origin of the angular dependent spin polarization of the\nphotoelectron beam, observable in spin degenerate systems without angular\nmomentum transfer by the incident photon. We propose a semi-quantitative model\nwhich permits to relate spin and time scales in photoemission from condensed\nmatter targets and to better understand spin- and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (SARPES) experiments on spin degenerate systems. We also present\nthe first experimental determination by SARPES of this time delay in a\ndispersive band, which is found to be greater than 26 as for electrons emitted\nfrom the sp-bulk band of the model system Cu(111).\n", "  The suppression of Y mesons in the hot quark-gluon medium (QGP) versus\nreduced feed-down is investigated in UU collisions at RHIC energies and PbPb\ncollisions at LHC energies. Our centrality- and p_T-dependent model encompasses\nscreening, collisional damping and gluodissociation in the QGP. For Y(1S) it is\nin agreement with both STAR and CMS data provided the relativistic Doppler\neffect and the reduced feed-down from the Y(nS) and chi_b(nP) states are\nproperly considered. At both energies, most of the Y(1S) suppression is found\nto be due to reduced feed-down, whereas most of the Y(2S) suppression is caused\nby the hot-medium effects. The role of the latter increases with energy. The\np_T-dependence is flat due to the relativistic Doppler effect and reduced\nfeed-down. We predict the Y(1S)-suppression in PbPb at sqrt(s_NN) = 5.02 TeV.\n", "  In this era of large-scale stellar spectroscopic surveys, measurements of\nstellar attributes (\"labels,\" i.e. parameters and abundances) must be made\nprecise and consistent across surveys. Here, we demonstrate that this can be\nachieved by a data-driven approach to spectral modeling. With The Cannon, we\ntransfer information from the APOGEE survey to determine precise Teff, log g,\n[Fe/H], and [$\\alpha$/M] from the spectra of 450,000 LAMOST giants. The Cannon\nfits a predictive model for LAMOST spectra using 9952 stars observed in common\nbetween the two surveys, taking five labels from APOGEE DR12 as ground truth:\nTeff, log g, [Fe/H], [\\alpha/M], and K-band extinction $A_k$. The model is then\nused to infer Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and [$\\alpha$/M] for 454,180 giants, 20% of\nthe LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. These are the first [$\\alpha$/M] values for the\nfull set of LAMOST giants, and the largest catalog of [$\\alpha$/M] for giant\nstars to date. Furthermore, these labels are by construction on the APOGEE\nlabel scale; for spectra with S/N > 50, cross-validation of the model yields\ntypical uncertainties of 70K in Teff, 0.1 in log g, 0.1 in [Fe/H], and 0.04 in\n[$\\alpha$/M], values comparable to the broadly stated, conservative APOGEE DR12\nuncertainties. Thus, by using \"label transfer\" to tie low-resolution (LAMOST R\n$\\sim$ 1800) spectra to the label scale of a much higher-resolution (APOGEE R\n$\\sim$ 22,500) survey, we substantially reduce the inconsistencies between\nlabels measured by the individual survey pipelines. This demonstrates that\nlabel transfer with The Cannon can successfully bring different surveys onto\nthe same physical scale.\n", "  The stability of the excitonic condensation at low temperature driven by a\ncoupling of electrons to vibrational degrees of freedom in semimetal\ntwo-dimensional electronic system is discussed. In the framework of the\nunrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, we derive a set of equations to\ndetermine both the excitonic condensate order parameter and lattice\ndisplacement self-consistently. By lowering temperature we find out a\nsemimetal-insulator transition in the system if the coupling is large enough.\nThe insulating state typifies an excitonic condensation accompanied by a finite\nlattice distortion. Increasing temperature, both excitonic condensate order\nparameter and the lattice distortion decrease and then disappear in the same\nmanner. Microscopic analysis in momentum space strongly specifies that the\nexcitonic condensate driven by the lattice distortion favours the BCS type.\n", "  Modern opto-electronic devices are based on semiconductor heterostructures\nemploying the process of electron-hole pair annihilation. In particular polar\nmaterials enable a variety of classic and even quantum light sources, whose\non-going optimisation endeavours challenge generations of researchers. However,\nthe key challenge - the inherent electric crystal polarisation of such\nmaterials - remains unsolved and deteriorates the electron-hole pair\nannihilation rate. Here, our approach introduces a sequence of reverse\ninterfaces to compensate these polarisation effects, while the polar, natural\ncrystal growth direction is maintained provoking a boost in device performance.\nFormer research approaches like growth on less-polar crystal planes or even the\nstabilization of unnatural phases never reached industrial maturity. In\ncontrast, our solution allows the adaptation of all established industrial\nprocesses, while the polarisation becomes adjustable; even across zero. Hence,\nour approach marks the onset of an entire class of ultra-fast and efficient\ndevices based on any polar material.\n", "  In this paper we give an overview of exactly solved edge-interaction models,\nwhere the spins are placed on sites of a planar lattice and interact through\nedges connecting the sites. We only consider the case of a single spin degree\nof freedom at each site of the lattice. The Yang-Baxter equation for such\nmodels takes a particular simple form called the star-triangle relation.\nInterestigly all known solutions of this relation can be obtained as particular\ncases of a single \"master solution\", which is expressed through the elliptic\ngamma function and have continuous spins taking values of the circle. We show\nthat in the low-temperature (or quasi-classical) limit these lattice models\nreproduce classical discrete integrable systems on planar graphs previously\nobtained and classified by Adler, Bobenko and Suris through the\nconsistency-around-a-cube approach. We also discuss inversion relations, the\nphysicical meaning of Baxter's rapidity-independent parameter in the\nstar-triangle relations and the invariance of the action of the classical\nsystems under the star-triangle (or cube-flip) transformation of the lattice,\nwhich is a direct consequence of Baxter's Z-invariance in the associated\nlattice models.\n", "  Evaluation of analytical solutions of non-linear partial differential\nequations (both classical and fractional) is a rising subject in Applied\nMathematics because its applications in Physical biological and social\nsciences. In this paper we have used generalized Tanh method to find the exact\nsolution of KP-Burger equation and coupled KdV equation. The fractional\nSub-equation method has been used to find the solution of fractional KP-Burger\nequation and fractional coupled KdV equations. The exact solution obtained by\nfractional sub-equation method reduces to classical solution when order of\nfractional derivative tends to one. Finally numerical simulation has done. The\nnumerical simulation justifies that the solutions of two fractional\ndifferential equations reduces to shock solution for KP-Burger equation and\nsoliton solution for coupled KdV equations when order of derivative tends to\none.\n", "  We propose a topological model of induced gravity (pregeometry) where both\nNewton's coupling constant and the cosmological constant appear as integration\nconstants in solving field equations. The matter sector of a scalar field is\nalso considered, and by solving field equations it is shown that various types\nof cosmological solutions in the FRW universe can be obtained. A detailed\nanalysis is given of the meaning of the BRST transformations, which make the\ninduced gravity be a topological field theory, by means of the canonical\nquantization analysis, and the physical reason why such BRST transformations\nare needed in the present formalism is clarified. Finally, we propose a\ndynamical mechanism for fixing the Lagrange multiplier fields by following the\nHiggs mechanism. The present study clearly indicates that the induced gravity\ncan be constructed at the classical level without recourse to quantum\nfluctuations of matter and suggests an interesting relationship between the\ninduced gravity and the topological quantum field theory.\n", "  In the present work, we study the flow of thixotropic yield stress fluids\nbetween two concentric cylinders. In order to take into account the thixotropy,\nthe constitutive relation uses a structural parameter which is driven by a\nkinetic equation. Here, the Houska's model is considered. Depending on the\nbreakdown rate of the structural parameter, localization or shear-banding are\nobserved. We show that for fragile structures, a shear-banding flow may be\nobserved although for stronger structures, only localisation of the flow is\nobserved such as in Bingham fluids. Physical explanations of the shear-banding\ndiscussed by several authors in the literature highlight that the shear-banding\nmay be associated with a discontinuity into the structure of the material and a\nnon-monotonic evolution of the stress according to the constitutive relation\nwith the strain rate. Solving numerically the flow, we show that such a\nrheological model based on the existence of a structural parameter is able to\npredict shear-banding. Moreover, the consequences of the thixotropy on the\nlinear stability of the azimuthal flow is studied in a large range of\nparameters. Although the thixotropy allows shear banding for the base flow, it\ndoes not modify fundamentaly the stability of the Couette flow compared to a\nsimple yield stress fluid. The apparent shear-thinning behaviour depends on the\nthixotropic parameters of the fluid and the results about the onset of the\nTaylor vortices in shear-thinning fluids are retrieved. Nevertheless, the\nshear-banding modifies the stratification of the viscosity in the flowing zone\nsuch that the critical conditions are mainly driven by the width of the flowing\nregion.\n", "  In this advance, we study the system of strongly interacting spinor bosons in\na square lattice subject to any of the linear combinations of the Rashba and\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The SOC leads to novel and rich quantum\nand topological phenomena in a lattice system. They include masses generated\nfrom \"order from quantum disorder \" mechanism, collinear spin-bond correlated\nmagnetic phase, quantum commensurate ( C ) and In-commensurate ( IC )\nnon-coplanar Skyrmion crystal phases, stripe co-planar ( spiral ) C and IC\nphases, quantum Lifshitz C-IC transitions, metastable states, hysteresis,\ntopological rational and irrational winding numbers, incomplete and complete\ndevil staircases, Cantor sets, multi-fractals, etc. Various perspectives and\npossible intimate connections with topological spin liquids due to geometric\nfrustrations or quantum spin glass due to quenched disorders are discussed.\nImplications on current or near future cold atom systems and on 4d or 5d\nstrongly correlated materials with SOC are discussed.\n", "  We study Jacobi matrices that are uniformly approximated by periodic\noperators. We show that if the rate of approximation is sufficiently rapid,\nthen the associated quantum dynamics are ballistic in a rather strong sense;\nnamely, the (normalized) Heisenberg evolution of the position operator\nconverges strongly to a self-adjoint operator that is injective on the space of\nabsolutely summable sequences. In particular, this means that all transport\nexponents corresponding to well-localized initial states are equal to one. Our\nresult may be applied to a class of quantum many-body problems. Specifically,\nwe establish a lower bound on the Lieb--Robinson velocity for an isotropic XY\nspin chain on the integers with limit-periodic couplings.\n", "  Recently, Chau introduced an experimentally feasible qudit-based\nquantum-key-distribution (QKD) scheme. In that scheme, one bit of information\nis phase encoded in the prepared state in a $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space in\nthe form $(|i\\rangle\\pm|j\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ with $n\\ge 2$. For each qudit\nprepared and measured in the same two-dimensional Hilbert subspace, one bit of\nraw secret key is obtained in the absence of transmission error. Here we show\nthat by modifying the basis announcement procedure, the same experimental setup\ncan generate $n$ bits of raw key for each qudit prepared and measured in the\nsame basis in the noiseless situation. The reason is that in addition to the\nphase information, each qudit also carries information on the Hilbert subspace\nused. The additional $(n-1)$ bits of raw key comes from a clever utilization of\nthis extra piece of information. We prove the unconditional security of this\nmodified protocol and compare its performance with other existing provably\nsecure qubit- and qudit-based protocols on market in the one-way classical\ncommunication setting. Interestingly, we find that for the case of $n=2$, the\nsecret key rate of this modified protocol using non-degenerate random quantum\ncode to perform one-way entanglement distillation is equal to that of the\nsix-state scheme.\n", "  The formation of a spin glass usually requires both structural disorder and\nfrustrated magnetic interactions. Consequently, the origin of spin-glass\nbehaviour in Y$_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ $-$ in which magnetic Mo$^{4+}$ ions occupy a\nfrustrated pyrochlore lattice with minimal compositional disorder $-$ has been\na longstanding question. Here, we use neutron and X-ray pair-distribution\nfunction (PDF) analysis to develop a disorder model that resolves apparent\nincompatibilities between previously-reported PDF, EXAFS and NMR studies and\nprovides a new and physical mechanism for spin-glass formation. We show that\nMo$^{4+}$ ions displace according to a local \"2-in/2-out\" rule on each Mo$_4$\ntetrahedron, driven by orbital dimerisation of Jahn-Teller active Mo$^{4+}$\nions. Long-range orbital order is prevented by the macroscopic degeneracy of\ndimer coverings permitted by the pyrochlore lattice. Cooperative O$^{2-}$\ndisplacements yield a distribution of Mo$-$O$-$Mo angles, which in turn\nintroduces disorder into magnetic interactions. Our study demonstrates\nexperimentally how frustration of atomic displacements can assume the role of\ncompositional disorder in driving a spin-glass transition.\n", "  Experimentally and mysteriously, the concentration of quasiparticles in a\ngapped superconductor at low temperatures always by far exceeds its equilibrium\nvalue. We study the dynamics of localized quasiparticles in superconductors\nwith a spatially fluctuating gap edge. The competition between phonon-induced\nquasiparticle recombination and generation by a weak non-equilibrium agent\nresults in an upper bound for the concentration that explains the mystery.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement dynamics between two distant qubits by\nanalyzing correlations in the quantum Ising model. Starting from the spin\nsystem in a paramagnetic regime enforced by the external magnetic field $B$, we\nthen switch on the ferromagnetic spin-spin coupling $J$. Using the large\ncoordination number expansion, we consider two limiting switching regimes: (1)\nadiabatic, which monitors the evolution of the ground state through the quantum\ntransition to an ordered state; and (2) instantaneous (quench) which monitors\ninstead the propagation of quantum fluctuations and simulates the generation of\nlong range correlations. In particular, we find that quantum fluctuations\npropagate with twice the group speed of excitations in the equilibrium state of\nthe system.\n", "  In the context of engineered quantum systems, there is a demand for\nsuperconducting tunable devices able to operate with high Q-factors at power\nlevels equivalent to only a few photons. In this work, we developed a 3D\nmicrowave reentrant cavity with such characteristics ready to provide a very\nfine-tuning of a high-Q resonant mode over a large dynamic range. This system\nhas an electronic tuning mechanism based on a mechanically amplified\npiezoelectric actuator, which controls the resonator dominant mode frequency by\nchanging the cavity narrow gap by very small displacements. Experiments were\nconducted at room and dilution refrigerator temperatures showing a large\ndynamic range up to 4 GHz and 1 GHz, respectively, and were compared to a FEM\nmodel simulated data. At elevated microwave power input, nonlinear thermal\neffects were observed to destroy the superconductivity of the cavity due to the\nlarge electric fields generated in the small gap of the reentrant cavity.\n", "  Using the anelastic approximation of linearized hydrodynamic equations, we\ninvestigate the development of axially symmetric small perturbations in thin\nKeplerian discs. Dispersion relation is found as a solution of general\nSturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem for different values of relevant physical\nparameters (viscosity, heat conductivity, disc semithickness). The analysis\nreveals the appearance of overstable mode for Prandtl parameter higher than\nsome critical value. These modes have a viscous-convective nature and can serve\nas a seed for turbulence in astrophysical discs even in the absence of magnetic\nfields.\n", "  We present the first global 3D simulations of thermal convection in the\noblate envelopes of rapidly-rotating solar-type stars. This has been achieved\nby exploiting the capabilities of the new Compressible High-ORder Unstructured\nSpectral difference (CHORUS) code. We consider rotation rates up to 85\\% of the\ncritical (breakup) rotation rate, which yields an equatorial radius that is up\nto 17\\% larger than the polar radius. This substantial oblateness enhances the\ndisparity between polar and equatorial modes of convection. We find that the\nconvection redistributes the heat flux emitted from the outer surface, leading\nto an enhancement of the heat flux in the polar and equatorial regions. This\nfinding implies that lower-mass stars with convective envelopes may not have\ndarker equators as predicted by classical gravity darkening arguments. The\nvigorous high-latitude convection also establishes elongated axisymmetric\ncirculation cells and zonal jets in the polar regions. Though the overall\namplitude of the surface differential rotation, $\\Delta \\Omega$, is insensitive\nto the oblateness, the oblateness does limit the fractional kinetic energy\ncontained in the differential rotation to no more than 61\\%. Furthermore, we\nargue that this level of differential rotation is not enough to have a\nsignificant impact on the oblateness of the star.\n", "  Excitonic effects due to electron-hole coupling play a fundamental role in\nrenormalising energy levels in dye sensitised and organic solar cells\ndetermining the driving force for electron extraction. We show that\nfirst-principles calculations based on many-body perturbation theory within the\nGW-BSE approach provide a quantitative picture of interfacial excited state\nenergetics in organic dye-sensitized TiO2 , delivering a general rule for\nevaluating relevant energy levels.To perform GW-BSE calculations in such large\nsystems we introduce a new scheme based on maximally localized Wannier\nfunctions. With this method the overall scaling of GW-BSE calculations is\nreduced from O(N4) to O(N3).\n", "  This article gives an overview on recent theoretical progress in controlling\nthe charge and spin dynamics in low-dimensional electronic systems by means of\nultrashort and ultrabroadband electromagnetic pulses. A particular focus is put\non sub-cycle and single-cycle pulses and their utilization for coherent\ncontrol. The discussion is mostly limited to cases where the pulse duration is\nshorter than the characteristic time scales associated with the involved\nspectral features of the excitations. We work out that the pulse action amounts\nin essence to a quantum map between the quantum states of the system at an\nappropriately chosen time moment during the pulse. The influence of a\nparticular pulse shape on the post-pulse dynamics is reduced to several\nintegral parameters entering the expression for the quantum map. The validity\nrange of this reduction scheme for different strengths of the driving fields is\nestablished and discussed for particular nanostructures. Acting with a periodic\npulse sequence, it is shown how the system can be steered to and largely\nmaintained in predefined states. The conditions for this nonequilibrium\nsustainability are worked out by means of geometric phases, which are\nidentified as the appropriate quantities to indicate quasistationarity of\nperiodically driven quantum systems. Demonstrations are presented for the\ncontrol of the charge, spin, and valley degrees of freedom in nanostructures on\npicosecond and subpicosecond time scales. The theory is illustrated with\nseveral applications to one-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires and\nsuperlattices, double quantum dots, semiconductor and graphene quantum rings.\nFurthermore, we consider the response of strongly correlated systems to short\nbroadband pulses and show that this case bears a great potential to unveil high\norder correlations while they build up upon excitations.\n", "  We propose that the mass-temperature relation of galaxy clusters is a prime\ncandidate for testing gravity theories beyond Einstein's general relativity,\nfor modified gravity models with universal coupling between matter and the\nscalar field. For non-universally coupled models we discover that the impact of\nmodified gravity can remain hidden from the mass-temperature relation. Using\ncosmological simulations, we find that in modified gravity the mass-temperature\nrelation varies significantly from the standard gravity prediction of $M\n\\propto T^{1.73}$. To be specific, for symmetron models with a coupling factor\nof $\\beta=1$ we find a lower limit to the power law as $M\\propto T^{1.6}$; and\nfor f(R) gravity we compute predictions based on the model parameters. We show\nthat the mass-temperature relation, for screened modified gravities, is\nsignificantly different from that of standard gravity for the less massive and\ncolder galaxy clusters, while being indistinguishable from Einstein's gravity\nat massive, hot galaxy clusters. We further investigate the mass-temperature\nrelation for other mass estimates than the thermal mass estimate, and discover\nthat the gas mass-temperature results show an even more significant deviations\nfrom Einstein's gravity than the thermal mass-temperature.\n", "  This paper studies the existence, uniqueness and convergence to\nnon-equilibrium steady states in Kac's model with an external coupling. We work\nin both Fourier distances and Wasserstein distances. Our methods work in the\ncase where the external coupling is not a Maxwellian equilibrium. This provides\nan example of a non-equilibrium steady state. We also study the behaviour as\nthe number of particles goes to infinity and show quantitative estimates on the\nconvergence rate of the first marginal.\n", "  Maximum likelihood quantum state tomography yields estimators that are\nconsistent, provided that the likelihood model is correct, but the maximum\nlikelihood estimators may have bias for any finite data set. The bias of an\nestimator is the difference between the expected value of the estimate and the\ntrue value of the parameter being estimated. This paper investigates bias in\nthe widely used maximum likelihood quantum state tomography. Our goal is to\nunderstand how the amount of bias depends on factors such as the purity of the\ntrue state, the number of measurements performed, and the number of different\nbases in which the system is measured. For that, we perform numerical\nexperiments that simulate optical homodyne tomography under various conditions,\nperform tomography, and estimate bias in the purity of the estimated state. We\nfind that estimates of higher purity states exhibit considerable bias, such\nthat the estimates have lower purity than the true states.\n", "  Plastic deformation of crystalline and amorphous matter often involves\nintermittent local strain burst events. To understand the physical background\nof the phenomenon a minimal stochastic mesoscopic model was introduced, where\nmicrostructural details are represented by a fluctuating local yielding\nthreshold. In the present paper, we propose a method for determining this yield\nstress distribution by lower scale discrete dislocation dynamics simulations\nand using a weakest link argument. The success of scale-linking is demonstrated\non the stress-strain curves obtained by the resulting mesoscopic and the\ndiscrete dislocation models. As shown by various scaling relations they are\nstatistically equivalent and behave identically in the thermodynamic limit. The\nproposed technique is expected to be applicable for different microstructures\nand amorphous materials, too.\n", "  In this thesis we investigate quantum aspects of the Green-Schwarz\nsuperstring in various AdS backgrounds relevant for the AdS/CFT correspondence,\nproviding several examples of perturbative computations in the corresponding\nintegrable sigma-models. We start by reviewing in details the supercoset\nconstruction of the superstring action in $AdS_5 \\times S^5$, pointing out the\nlimits of this procedure for $AdS_4$ and $AdS_3$ backgrounds. For the $AdS_4\n\\times CP^3$ case we give a thorough derivation of an alternative action, based\non the double-dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional super-membranes. We\nthen consider the expansion about the BMN vacuum and the S-matrix for the\nscattering of worldsheet excitations in the decompactification limit. To\nevaluate its elements efficiently we describe a unitarity-based method\nresulting in a very compact formula yielding the cut-constructible part of any\none-loop two-dimensional S-matrix. In the second part of this review we analyze\nthe superstring action on $AdS_4 \\times CP^3$ expanded around the null cusp\nvacuum. The free energy of this model, whose computation we reproduce up to\ntwo-loops at strong coupling, is related to the cusp anomalous dimension of the\nABJM theory and, indirectly, to a non-trivial effective coupling $h(\\lambda)$\nfeaturing all integrability-based calculations in $AdS_4/CFT_3$. Finally, we\nextensively discuss the comparison of the perturbative results and the\nintegrability predictions for the one-loop dispersion relation of GKP\nexcitations. Our results provide valuable data in support of the quantum\nconsistency of the string actions - often debated due to possible issues with\ncancellation of UV divergences and the lack of manifest power-counting\nrenormalizability - and furnish non-trivial stringent tests for the quantum\nintegrability of the analyzed models.\n", "  An effective theory of gravity in the infrared is proposed, which involves\nthe determinant of the metric relative to the determinant of a prior metric\ntaken to be that of Minkowski spacetime. This effective theory can be\ninterpreted as a generalization of unimodular gravity. In a cosmological\ncontext with ultrarelativistic or cold matter, the resulting field equations\nhave only one solution, empty Minkowski spacetime (selected by the prior metric\nof the theory). The introduction of energy exchange between vacuum and matter\ngives rise to nonstatic cosmic solutions. It is found that Minkowski spacetime\n(from the prior metric) appears as an attractor of the dynamic equations. A\nfurther result is that energy-momentum conservation of any localized material\nsystem is violated in a nonconstant gravitational background. The impact for\nexperiment appears, however, negligible if the vacuum-energy mass scale is of\norder meV.\n", "  We describe a stream-based analysis pipeline to detect gravitational waves\nfrom the merger of binary neutron stars, binary black holes, and\nneutron-star-black-hole binaries within ~ 1 minute of the arrival of the merger\nsignal at Earth. Such low-latency detection is crucial for the prompt response\nby electromagnetic facilities in order to observe any fading electromagnetic\ncounterparts that might be produced by mergers involving at least one neutron\nstar. Even for systems expected not to produce counterparts, low-latency\nanalysis of the data is useful for deciding when not to point telescopes, and\nas feedback to observatory operations. Analysts using this pipeline were the\nfirst to identify GW151226, the second gravitational-wave event ever detected.\nThe pipeline also operates in an offline mode, in which it incorporates more\nrefined information about data quality and employs acausal methods that are\ninapplicable to the online mode. The pipeline's offline mode was used in the\ndetection of the first two gravitational-wave events, GW150914 and GW151226, as\nwell as the identification of a third candidate, LVT151012.\n", "  We show that Bose-Einstein correlations of identical particles in hadron and\nnucleus high energy collisions, lead to long range rapidity correlations in the\nazimuthal angle. These correlations are inherent features of the CGC/saturation\napproach, however, their origin is more general than this approach. In\nframework of the proposed technique both even and odd $v_n$ occur naturally,\nindependent of the type of target and projectile. We are of the opinion that it\nis premature to conclude that the appearance of azimuthal correlations are due\nto the hydrodynamical behaviour of the quark-gluon plasma.\n", "  We present high-contrast observations of 68 young stellar objects (YSOs)\nexplored as part of the SEEDS survey on the Subaru telescope. Our targets are\nvery young ($<$10 Myr) stars, which often harbor protoplanetary disks where\nplanets may be forming. We achieve a typical contrast of\n$\\sim$$10^{-4}$--$10^{-5.5}$ at an angular distance of 1\\arcsec\\ from the\ncentral star, corresponding to typical mass sensitivities (assuming hot-start\nevolutionary models) of $\\sim$10 ${\\rm M_J}$ at 70 AU and $\\sim$6 ${\\rm M_J}$\nat 140 AU. We detected a new stellar companion to HIP 79462 and confirmed the\nsubstellar objects GQ Lup b and ROXs 42B b. An additional six companion\ncandidates await follow-up observations to check for common proper motion. Our\nSEEDS YSO observations probe the population of planets and brown dwarfs at the\nvery youngest ages; these may be compared to the results of surveys targeting\nsomewhat older stars. Our sample and the associated observational results will\nhelp enable detailed statistical analyses of giant planet formation.\n", "  According to Landauer's principle, erasing one bit of information incurs a\nminimum energy cost. Recently, Vaccaro and Barnett (VB) explored information\nerasure within the context of generalized Gibbs ensembles and demonstrated that\nfor energy-degenerate spin reservoirs, the cost of erasure can be solely in\nterms of a minimum amount of spin angular momentum and no energy. As opposed to\nthe Landauer case, the cost of erasure in this case is associated with the\ndiscrete variable.\n  Here we study the {\\it discrete} fluctuations in this cost and the\nprobability of violation of the VB bound. We also obtain a Jarzynski-like\nequality for the VB erasure protocol. We find that the fluctuations below the\nVB bound are exponentially suppressed at a far greater rate and more tightly\nthan for an equivalent Jarzynski expression for VB erasure. We expose a\ntrade-off between the size of the fluctuations and the cost of erasure. We find\nthat the discrete nature of the fluctuations is pronounced in the regime where\nreservoir spins are maximally polarized. We also state the first laws of\nthermodynamics corresponding to the conservation of spin angular momentum for\nthis particular erasure protocol. Our work will be important for novel heat\nengines based on information erasure schemes that do not incur an energy cost.\n", "  We experimentally study tunneling of Bose-condensed $^{87}$Rb atoms prepared\nin a quasi-bound state and observe a non-exponential decay caused by\ninteratomic interactions. A combination of a magnetic quadrupole trap and a\nthin $1.3\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ barrier created using a blue-detuned sheet of light is\nused to tailor traps with controllable depth and tunneling rate. The escape\ndynamics strongly depend on the mean-field energy, which gives rise to three\ndistinct regimes--- classical spilling over the barrier, quantum tunneling, and\ndecay dominated by background losses. We show that the tunneling rate depends\nexponentially on the chemical potential. Our results show good agreement with\nnumerical solutions of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation.\n", "  A class of long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) presenting light curves with an\nextended plateau phase in their X-ray afterglows obeys a correlation between\nthe rest frame end time of the plateau, $T_a$, and its corresponding X-ray\nluminosity, $L_{a}$, Dainotti et al. (2008). In this work we perform an\nanalysis of a total sample of 176 {\\it Swift} GRBs with known redshifts,\nexhibiting afterglow plateaus. By adding a third parameter, that is the peak\nluminosity in the prompt emission, $L_{peak}$, we discover the existence of a\nnew three parameter correlation. The scatter of data about this plane becomes\nsmaller when a class-specific GRB sample is defined. This sample of 122 GRBs is\nselected from the total sample by excluding GRBs with associated Supernovae\n(SNe), X-ray flashes and short GRBs with extended emission. {\\bf With this\nsample the three parameter correlation identifies a GRB `fundamental plane'}.\nMoreover, we further limit our analysis to GRBs with lightcurves having good\ndata coverage and almost flat plateaus, 40 GRBs forming our `gold sample'. The\nintrinsic scatter, $\\sigma_{int}=0.27 \\pm 0.04$, for the three-parameter\ncorrelation for this last subclass is more than twice smaller than the value\nfor the $L_{a}-T_a$ one, making this the tightest three parameter correlation\ninvolving the afterglow plateau phase. Finally, we also show that a slightly\nless tight correlation is present between $L_{peak}$ and a proxy for the total\nenergy emitted during the plateau phase, $L_a T_a$, confirming the existence of\nan energy scaling between prompt and afterglow phases.\n", "  In this paper, we study the thermodynamic properties of a system of\n$D$-components classical Heisenberg spins lying on the vertices of a random\nregular graph, with an unconventional first neighbor non-random interaction\n$J(\\mathbf{S}_i\\cdot \\mathbf{S}_k)^2$. We can consider this model as a\ncontinuum version of anti-ferromagnetic $D$-states Potts model. We compute the\nparamagnetic free energy, using a new approach, presented in this paper for the\nfirst time, based on the replica method. Through the linear stability analysis,\nwe obtain an instability line on the temperature-connectivity plane that\nprovides a bound to the appearance of a phase transition. We also argue about\nthe character of the instability observed.\n", "  These are lecture notes from author's mini-course during Session 1: \"Vertex\nalgebras, W-algebras, and application\" of INdAM Intensive research period\n\"Perspectives in Lie Theory\", at the Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De\nGiorgi, Pisa, Italy. December 9, 2014 -- February 28, 2015.\n", "  Given its peak luminosity and early-time spectra, ASASSN-15lh was classified\nas the most luminous supernova (SN) ever discovered (Dong et al. 2016). Here we\nreport a UV rebrightening of ASASSN-15lh observed with Swift during our\nfollow-up campaign. The rebrightening began at $t \\simeq$ 90 days (observer\nframe) after the primary peak and was followed by a $\\sim 120$-day long plateau\nin the bolometric luminosity, before starting to fade again at $t\\simeq 210$\ndays. ASASSN-15lh rebrightened in the Swift UV bands by $\\Delta m_{UVW2} \\simeq\n-1.75$ mag, $\\Delta m_{UVM2} \\simeq -1.25$ mag, and $\\Delta m_{UVW1} \\simeq\n-0.8$ mag, but did not rebrighten in the optical bands. Throughout its initial\ndecline, subsequent rebrightening, and renewed decline, the spectra did not\nshow evidence of interactions between the ejecta and circumstellar medium (CSM)\nsuch as narrow emission lines. There are hints of weak H$\\alpha$ emission at\nlate-times, but Margutti et al. (2016) have shown that it is narrow line\nemission consistent with star formation in the host nucleus. By fitting a\nblackbody we find that during the rebrightening the effective photospheric\ntemperature increased from $T_{BB} \\simeq 11000$ K to $T_{BB} \\simeq 18000$ K.\nOver the $\\sim$ 550 days since its detection, ASASSN-15lh has radiated $\\sim\n1.7 - 1.9 \\times 10^{52}$ ergs. Although its physical nature remains uncertain,\nthe evolution of ASASSN-15lh's photospheric radius, its radiated energy, and\nthe implied event rate, are all more similar to those of H-poor superluminous\nsupernovae (SLSNe-I) than to tidal disruption events (TDEs).\n", "  The doubly-magic nucleus $^{16}$O has a small neutron capture cross section\nof just a few tens of microbarn in the astrophysical energy region. Despite of\nthis, $^{16}$O plays an important role as neutron poison in the astrophysical\nslow neutron capture ($s$) process due to its high abundance. We present in\nthis paper a re-evaluation of the available experimental data for\n$^{16}$O($n,\\gamma$)$^{17}$O and derive a new recommendation for the\nMaxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACS) between $kT$= 5$-$100 keV. Our new\nrecommendations are lower up to $kT$= 60 keV compared to the previously\nrecommended values but up to 14\\% higher at $kT$= 100 keV. We explore the\nimpact of this different energy dependence on the weak $s$-process during core\nhelium- ($kT$= 26 keV) and shell carbon burning ($kT$= 90 keV) in massive stars\nwhere $^{16}$O is the most abundant isotope.\n", "  Motivated by the recent efforts to describe the gravitational interaction as\na classical channel arising from continuous quantum measurements, we study what\ntypes of dynamics can emerge from a collisional model of repeated interactions\nbetween a system and a set of ancillae. We show that contingent on the model\nparameters the resulting dynamics ranges from exact unitarity to arbitrarily\nfast decoherence (quantum Zeno effect). For a series of measurements the\neffective dynamics includes feedback-control, which for a composite system\nyields effective interactions between the subsystems. We quantify the amount of\ndecoherence accompanying such induced interactions, generalizing the lower\nbound found for the gravitational example. However, by allowing multipartite\nmeasurements, we show that interactions can be induced with arbitrarily low\ndecoherence. These results have implications for gravity-inspired decoherence\nmodels. Moreover, we show how the framework can include terms beyond the usual\nsecond-order approximation, which can spark new quantum control or simulation\nprotocols. Finally, within our simple approach we re-derive the quantum\nfiltering equations for the different regimes of effective dynamics, which can\nfacilitate new connections between different formulations of open systems.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on the vanadium oxyfluoride material DQVOF,\nwe examine possible spin liquid phases on a breathing kagome lattice of S=1/2\nspins. By performing a projective symmetry group analysis, we determine the\npossible phases for both fermionic and bosonic $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids on\nthis lattice, and establish the correspondence between the two. The nature of\nthe ground state of the Heisenberg model on the isotropic kagome lattice is a\nhotly debated topic, with both $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and U(1) spin liquids argued to\nbe plausible ground states. Using variational Monte Carlo techniques, we show\nthat a gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid emerges as the clear ground state in\nthe presence of this breathing anisotropy. Our results suggest that the\nbreathing anisotropy helps to stabilize this spin liquid ground state, which\nmay aid us in understanding the results of experiments and help to direct\nfuture numerical studies on these systems.\n", "  We explore the evolution of the statistical distribution of galaxy\nmorphological properties and colours over the redshift range $0.5<z<1$,\ncombining high-quality imaging data from the CFHT Legacy Survey with the large\nnumber of redshifts and extended photometry from the VIPERS survey. Galaxy\nstructural parameters are measured by fitting S\\'ersic profiles to $i$-band\nimages and then combined with absolute magnitudes, colours and redshifts, to\ntrace the evolution in a multi-parameter space. We analyse, using a new method,\nthe combination of colours and structural parameters of early- and late-type\ngalaxies in luminosity--redshift space. We found that both the rest-frame\ncolour distributions in the (U-B) vs. (B-V) plane and the S\\'ersic index\ndistributions are well fitted by a sum of two Gaussians, with a remarkable\nconsistency of red-spheroidal and blue-disky galaxy populations, over the\nexplored redshift ($0.5<z<1$) and luminosity ($-1.5<B-B_*<1.0$) ranges. The\ncombination of the UBV rest-frame colour and S\\'ersic index $n$ as a function\nof redshift and luminosity allows us to present the structure of early- and\nlate-type galaxies and their evolution. We found that early type galaxies\ndisplay only a slow change of their concentrations since $z\\sim1$; it is\nalready established by $z\\sim1$ and depends much more strongly on their\nluminosities. In contrast, late-type galaxies get clearly more concentrated\nwith cosmic time since $z\\sim1$, with only little evolution in colour, which\nremains dependent mainly on their luminosity. This flipped luminosity (mass)\nand redshift dependence likely reflects different evolutionary tracks of early-\nand late-type galaxies before and after $z\\sim1$. The combination of rest-frame\ncolours and S\\'ersic index $n$ as a function of redshift and luminosity leads\nto a precise statistical description of the structure of galaxies and their\nevolution.\n", "  To understand the conditions under which dense, molecular gas is able to form\nwithin a galaxy, we post-process a series of three-dimensional\ngalactic-disk-scale simulations with ray-tracing based radiative transfer and\nchemical network integration to compute the equilibrium chemical and thermal\nstate of the gas. In performing these simulations we vary a number of\nparameters, such as the ISRF strength, vertical scale height of stellar\nsources, cosmic ray flux, to gauge the sensitivity of our results to these\nvariations. Self-shielding permits significant molecular hydrogen (H2)\nabundances in dense filaments around the disk midplane, accounting for\napproximately ~10-15% of the total gas mass. Significant CO fractions only form\nin the densest, n>~10^3 cm^-3, gas where a combination of dust, H2, and\nself-shielding attenuate the FUV background. We additionally compare these\nray-tracing based solutions to photochemistry with complementary models where\nphoto-shielding is accounted for with locally computed prescriptions. With some\nexceptions, these local models for the radiative shielding length perform\nreasonably well at reproducing the distribution and amount of molecular gas as\ncompared with a detailed, global ray tracing calculation. Specifically, an\napproach based on the Jeans Length with a T=40K temperature cap performs the\nbest in regards to a number of different quantitative measures based on the H2\nand CO abundances.\n", "  A two-phase Cryogenic Avalanche Detector (CRAD) with electroluminescence (EL)\ngap, operated in argon doped with a minor (49$\\pm$7 ppm) admixture of nitrogen,\nhas been studied. The EL gap was optically read out using cryogenic PMTs\nlocated on the perimeter of the gap. We present the results of the measurements\nof the N$_2$ content, detector sensitivity to X-ray-induced signals, EL gap\nyield and electron lifetime in the liquid. The detector sensitivity, at a drift\nfield in liquid Ar of 0.6 kV/cm, was measured to be 9 and 16 photoelectrons\nrecorded at the PMTs per keV of deposited energy at 23 and 88 keV respectively.\nSuch two-phase detectors, with enhanced sensitivity to the S2\n(ionization-induced) signal, are relevant in the field of argon detectors for\ndark matter search and low energy neutrino detection.\n", "  We introduce a simple scheme to implement synthetic dimensions in ultracold\natomic gases, which only requires two basic and ubiquitous ingredients: the\nharmonic trap, which confines the atoms, combined with a periodic shaking. In\nour approach, standard harmonic oscillator eigenstates are reinterpreted as\nlattice sites along a synthetic dimension, while the coupling between these\nlattice sites is controlled by the applied time-modulation. The phase of this\nmodulation enters as a complex hopping phase, leading straightforwardly to an\nartificial magnetic field upon adding a second dimension. We show that this\nartificial gauge field has important consequences, such as the counterintuitive\nreduction of average energy under resonant driving, or the realisation of\nquantum Hall physics. Our approach offers significant advantages over previous\nimplementations of synthetic dimensions, providing an intriguing route towards\nhigher-dimensional topological physics and strongly-correlated states.\n", "  We present 90 mas (37 pc) resolution ALMA imaging of Arp 220 in the CO (1-0)\nline and continuum at $\\lambda = 2.6$ mm. The internal gas distribution and\nkinematics of both galactic nuclei are well-resolved for the first time. In the\nWest nucleus, the major gas and dust emission extends out to 0.2\\arcsec radius\n(74 pc); the central resolution element shows a strong peak in the dust\nemission but a factor 3 dip in the CO line emission. In this nucleus, the dust\nis apparently optically thick ($\\tau_{\\rm 2.6mm} \\sim1$) at $\\lambda = 2.6$ mm\nwith a dust brightness temperature $\\sim147$ K. The column of ISM at this\nnucleus is $\\rm N_{H2} \\geq 2\\times10^{26}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to\n$\\sim$900 gr cm$^{-2}$. The East nucleus is more elongated with radial extent\n0.3\\arcsec or $\\sim111$ pc. The derived kinematics of the nuclear disks provide\na good fit to the line profiles, yielding the emissivity distributions, the\nrotation curves and velocity dispersions. In the West nucleus, there is\nevidence of a central Keplerian component requiring a central mass of\n$8\\times10^8$ \\msun. The intrinsic widths of the emission lines are $\\Delta \\rm\nv (FWHM)$ = 250 (West) and 120 (East) \\kms. Given the very short dissipation\ntimescales for turbulence ($\\lesssim10^5$ yrs), we suggest that the line widths\nmay be due to semi-coherent motions within the nuclear disks. The symmetry of\nthe nuclear disk structures is impressive -- implying the merger timescale is\nsignificantly longer than the rotation period of the disks.\n", "  The recent detection of gravitational waves indicates that stellar-mass black\nhole binaries are likely to be a key population of sources for forthcoming\nobservations. With future upgrades, ground-based detectors could detect merging\nblack hole binaries out to cosmological distances. Gravitational wave bursts\nfrom high redshifts ($z \\gtrsim 1$) can be strongly magnified by gravitational\nlensing due to intervening galaxies along the line of sight. In the absence of\nelectromagnetic counterparts, the mergers' intrinsic mass scale and redshift\nare degenerate with the unknown magnification factor $\\mu$. Hence, strongly\nmagnified low-mass mergers from high redshifts appear as higher-mass mergers\nfrom lower redshifts. We assess the impact of this degeneracy on the\nmass-redshift distribution of observable events for generic models of binary\nblack hole formation from normal stellar evolution, Pop III star remnants, or a\nprimordial black hole population. We find that strong magnification ($\\mu\n\\gtrsim 3$) generally creates a heavy tail of apparently massive mergers in the\nevent distribution from a given detector. For LIGO and its future upgrades,\nthis tail may dominate the population of intrinsically massive, but unlensed\nmergers in binary black hole formation models involving normal stellar\nevolution or primordial black holes. Modeling the statistics of lensing\nmagnification can help account for this magnification bias when testing\nastrophysical scenarios of black hole binary formation and evolution.\n", "  It is shown that in the phenomenologically realistic supersymmetric $B-L$\nMSSM theory, a linear combination of the neutral, up Higgs field with the third\nfamily left-and right-handed sneutrinos can play the role of the cosmological\ninflaton. Assuming that supersymmetry is softly broken at a mass scale of order\n$10^{13}~\\mathrm{GeV}$, the potential energy associated with this field allows\nfor 60 e-foldings of inflation with the cosmological parameters being\nconsistent with all Planck2015 data. The theory does not require any\nnon-standard coupling to gravity and the physical fields are all sub-Planckian\nduring the inflationary epoch. It will be shown that there is a \"robust\" set of\ninitial conditions which, in addition to satisfying the Planck data,\nsimultaneously are consistent with all present LHC phenomenological\nrequirements.\n", "  We investigate the time averaged squared displacement (TASD) of continuous\ntime random walks with respect to the number of steps $N$, which the random\nwalker performed during the data acquisition time $T$. We prove that the TASD,\nand as well the apparent diffusion constant, grow linearly with $N$, provided\nthe steps possess a fourth moment and can not accumulate in small intervals.\nConsequently, the fluctuations of the latter are dominated by the fluctuations\nof $N$, and fluctuations of the walker's thermal history are irrelevant.\nFurthermore, we show that the relative scatter decays as $1/\\sqrt{N}$, which\nsuppresses all non-linear features in a plot of the TASD against the lag time.\nParts of our arguments also hold for continuous time random walks with\ncorrelated steps.\n", "  The standard approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation is to store\ninformation in a quantum error correction code, such as the surface code, and\nprocess information using a strategy that can be summarized as\ndistill-then-synthesize. In the distill step, one performs several rounds of\ndistillation to create high-fidelity logical qubits in a magic state. Each such\nmagic state provides one good T gate. In the synthesize step, one seeks the\noptimal decomposition of an algorithm into a sequence of many T gates\ninterleaved with Clifford gates. This gate-synthesis problem is well understood\nfor multiqubit gates that do not use any Hadamards. We present an in-depth\nanalysis of a unified framework that realises one round of distillation and\nmultiqubit gate synthesis in a single step. We call these synthillation\nprotocols, and show they lead to a large reduction in resource overheads. This\nis because synthillation can implement a general class of circuits using the\nsame number of T-states as gate synthesis, yet with the benefit of quadratic\nerror suppression. This general class includes all circuits primarily dominated\nby control-control-Z gates, such as adders and modular exponentiation routines\nused in Shor's algorithm. Therefore, synthillation removes the need for a\ncostly round of magic state distillation. We also present several additional\nresults on the multiqubit gate-synthesis problem. We provide an efficient\nalgorithm for synthesizing unitaries with the same worst-case resource scaling\nas optimal solutions. For the special case of synthesizing\ncontrolled-unitaries, our techniques are not just efficient but exactly\noptimal. We observe that the gate-synthesis cost, measured by T-count, is often\nstrictly subadditive. Numerous explicit applications of our techniques are also\npresented.\n", "  The leading paradigm for performing computation on quantum memories can be\nencapsulated as distill-then-synthesize. Initially, one performs several rounds\nof distillation to create high-fidelity magic states that provide one good T\ngate, an essential quantum logic gate. Subsequently, gate synthesis\nintersperses many T gates with Clifford gates to realise a desired circuit. We\nintroduce a unified framework that implements one round of distillation and\nmulti-qubit gate synthesis in a single step. Typically, our method uses the\nsame number of T gates as conventional synthesis, but with the added benefit of\nquadratic error suppression. Because of this, one less round of magic state\ndistillation needs to be performed, leading to significant resource savings.\n", "  For two symmetric quantum states one may be interested in maximizing the\noverlap under local operations applied to one of them. The question arises\nwhether the maximal overlap can be obtained by applying the same local\noperation to each party. We show that for two symmetric multiqubit states and\nlocal unitary transformations this is the case; the maximal overlap can be\nreached by applying the same unitary matrix everywhere. For local invertible\noperations (stochastic local operations assisted by classical communication\nequivalence), however, we present counterexamples, demonstrating that\nconsidering the same operation everywhere is not enough.\n", "  We describe a method to simulate Hamiltonian evolution on a quantum computer\nby repeatedly using a superposition of steps of a quantum walk, then applying a\ncorrection to the weightings for the numbers of steps of the quantum walk. This\ncorrection enables us to obtain complexity which is the same as the lower bound\nup to double-logarithmic factors for all parameter regimes. The scaling of the\nquery complexity is $O\\left( \\tau \\frac{\\log\\log\\tau}{\\log\\log\\log\\tau} +\n\\log(1/\\epsilon) \\right)$ where $\\tau := t\\|H\\|_{\\max}d$, for $\\epsilon$ the\nallowable error, $t$ the time, $\\|H\\|_{\\max}$ the max-norm of the Hamiltonian,\nand $d$ the sparseness. This technique should also be useful for improving the\nscaling of the Taylor series approach to simulation, which is relevant to\napplications such as quantum chemistry.\n", "  Conformal field theory (CFT) has been extremely successful in describing\nlarge-scale universal effects in one-dimensional (1D) systems at quantum\ncritical points. Unfortunately, its applicability in condensed matter physics\nhas been limited to situations in which the bulk is uniform because CFT\ndescribes low-energy excitations around some energy scale, taken to be constant\nthroughout the system. However, in many experimental contexts, such as quantum\ngases in trapping potentials and in several out-of-equilibrium situations,\nsystems are strongly inhomogeneous. We show here that the powerful CFT methods\ncan be extended to deal with such 1D situations, providing a few concrete\nexamples for non-interacting Fermi gases. The system's inhomogeneity enters the\nfield theory action through parameters that vary with position; in particular,\nthe metric itself varies, resulting in a CFT in curved space. This approach\nallows us to derive exact formulas for entanglement entropies which were not\nknown by other means.\n", "  We analyze the interplay of longitudinal and transverse fluctuations in a\n$U(1)$ symmetric two-dimensional $\\phi^4$-theory. To this end, we derive\ncoupled renormalization group equations for both types of fluctuations obtained\nfrom a linear (cartesian) decomposition of the order parameter field.\nDiscarding the longitudinal fluctuations, the expected\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase characterized by a finite stiffness\nand an algebraic decay of order parameter correlations is recovered.\nRenormalized by transverse fluctuations, the longitudinal mass scales to zero,\nso that longitudinal fluctuations become increasingly important for small\nmomenta. Within our expansion of the effective action, they generate a\nlogarithmic decrease of the stiffness, in agreement with previous functional\nrenormalization group calculations. The logarithmic terms imply a deviation\nfrom the vanishing beta-function for the stiffness in the non-linear sigma\nmodel describing the phase fluctuations at three-loop order. To gain further\ninsight, we also compute the flow of the parameters characterizing longitudinal\nand transverse fluctuations from a density-phase representation of the order\nparameter field, with a cutoff on phase fluctuations. The power-law flow of the\nlongitudinal mass and other quantities is thereby confirmed, but the stiffness\nremains finite in this approach. We conclude that the marginal flow of the\nstiffness obtained in the cartesian representation is an artifact of the\ntruncated expansion of momentum dependences.\n", "  We recently formulated a local mechanism of vacuum energy sequester. This\nmechanism automatically removes all matter loop contributions to vacuum energy\nfrom the stress energy tensor which sources the curvature. Here we adapt the\nlocal vacuum energy sequestering mechanism to also cancel all the vacuum energy\nloops involving virtual gravitons, in addition to the vacuum energy generated\nby matter fields alone.\n", "  Massive galaxies at higher redshifts ($\\emph{z}$ $>$ 2) show different\ncharacteristics from their local counterparts: They are compact and most likely\nhave a disk. In this study, we trace the evolution of local massive galaxies by\nperforming a detailed morphological analysis, namely, fitting single S\\'{e}rsic\nprofiles and performing bulge+disk decompositions. We analyze $\\sim$ 250\nmassive galaxies selected from all CANDELS fields (COSMOS, UDS, EGS,\nGOODS-South and GOODS-North). We confirm that both star-forming and quiescent\ngalaxies increase their sizes significantly from $\\emph{z}$ $\\approx$ 2.5 to\nthe present day. The global S\\'{e}rsic index of quiescent galaxies increases\nover time (from $n$ $\\approx$ 2.5 to $n$ $>$ 4), while that of star-forming\ngalaxies remains roughly constant ($n$ $\\approx$ 2.5). By decomposing galaxy\nprofiles into bulge+disk components, we find that massive galaxies at high\nredshift have prominent stellar disks, which are also evident from visual\ninspection of the images. By $z$ $\\approx$ 0.5, the majority of the disks\ndisappear and massive quiescent galaxies begin to resemble the local elliptical\ngalaxies. Star-forming galaxies have lower bulge-to-total ratios ($B/T$) than\ntheir quiescent counterparts at each redshift bin. The bulges of star-forming\nand quiescent galaxies follow different evolutionary histories, while their\ndisks evolve similarly. We conclude that major mergers, along with minor\nmergers, have played a crucial role in the significant size increase of\nhigh-\\emph{z} galaxies and the destruction of their massive and large-scale\ndisks.\n", "  Measurement of the gas velocity distribution in galaxy clusters provides\ninsight into the physics of mergers, through which large scale structures form\nin the Universe. Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be\nobtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is\nchallenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic\neffects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report\nresolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple\nmerger MACS J0717.5+3745 (z=0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at\nthe IRAM 30m telescope. Assuming that the SZ signal is the sum of a thermal\n(tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we\nextract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The\nkSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and +3.4\nsigma, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us\nand coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a\nmajor merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight\nvelocity of MACS J0717.5+3745 as four subclusters. Combining NIKA data with\nX-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra, we fit this model to constrain\nthe gas line-of-sight velocity of each component, and we also derive, for the\nfirst time, a velocity map from kSZ data (i.e. that is model-dependent). Our\nresults are consistent with previous constraints on the merger velocities, and\nthanks to the high angular resolution of our data, we are able to resolve the\nstructure of the gas velocity. Finally, we investigate possible contamination\nand systematic effects with a special care given to radio and submillimeter\ngalaxies. Among the sources that we detect with NIKA, we find one which is\nlikely to be a high redshift lensed submillimeter galaxy.\n", "  To elucidate the mechanisms behind the enhanced $T_c$ in monolayer (1ML) FeSe\non SrTiO$_3$ (STO), we grew highly strained 1ML FeSe on the rectangular (100)\nface of rutile TiO$_2$, and observed the coexistence of replica bands and\nsuperconductivity with a $T_c$ of 63 K. From the similar $T_c$ between this\nsystem and 1ML FeSe on STO (001), we conclude that strain and dielectric\nconstant are likely unimportant to the enhanced $T_c$ in these systems. A\nsystematic comparison of 1ML FeSe on TiO$_2$ with other systems in the FeSe\nfamily shows that while charge transfer alone can enhance $T_c$, it is only\nwith the addition of interfacial electron-phonon coupling that $T_c$ can be\nincreased to the level seen in 1ML FeSe on STO.\n", "  The possibility of observing many body localization of ultracold atoms in a\none dimensional optical lattice is discussed for random interactions. In the\nnon-interacting limit, such a system reduces to single-particle physics in the\nabsence of disorder, i.e. to extended states. In effect the observed\nlocalization is inherently due to interactions and is thus a genuine many-body\neffect. In the system studied, many-body localization manifests itself in a\nlack of thermalization visible in temporal propagation of a specially prepared\ninitial state, in transport properties, in the logarithmic growth of\nentanglement entropy as well as in statistical properties of energy levels.\n", "  We present CARMA CO (J=1-0) observations and Herschel PACS spectroscopy,\ncharacterizing the outflow properties toward extremely young and deeply\nembedded protostars in the Orion molecular clouds. The sample comprises a\nsubset of the Orion protostars known as the PACS Bright Red Sources (PBRS)\n(Stutz et al. 2013). We observed 14 PBRS with CARMA and 8 of these 14 with\nHerschel, acquiring full spectral scans from 55 micron to 200 micron. Outflows\nare detected in CO (J=1-0) from 8 of 14 PBRS, with two additional tentative\ndetections; outflows are also detected from the outbursting protostar HOPS 223\n(V2775 Ori) and the Class I protostar HOPS 68. The outflows have a range of\nmorphologies, some are spatially compact, <10000 AU in extent, while others\nextend beyond the primary beam. The outflow velocities and morphologies are\nconsistent with being dominated by intermediate inclination angles (80 deg > i\n> 20 deg). This confirms the interpretation of the very red 24 micron to 70\nmicron colors of the PBRS as a signpost of high envelope densities, with only\none (possibly two) cases of the red colors resulting from edge-on inclinations.\nWe detect high-J (J_up > 13) CO lines and/or H_2O lines from 5 of 8 PBRS and\nonly for those with detected CO outflows. The far-infrared CO rotation\ntemperatures of the detected PBRS are marginally colder (~230 K) than those\nobserved for most protostars (~300 K), and only one of these 5 PBRS has\ndetected [OI] 63 micron emission. The high envelope densities could be\nobscuring some [OI] emission and cause a ~20 K reduction to the CO rotation\ntemperatures.\n", "  We study $^{87}$Rb cold collisions in a static magnetic field and a\nsingle-color radio frequency (RF) field by employing the multi-channel quantum\ndefect theory in combination with the Floquet method to solve the two-body\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. Our results show that RF fields can\nmodify the two-body scattering length by a large scale through Feshbach\nresonances both in low and high static magnetic field regimes. Such RF induced\nFeshbach resonances can be applied to quenching experiments or controlling\ninteractions in spinor condensates. Here, we also show that analogous to\nphoto-association, RF fields can also associate cold atoms into molecules at a\nuseful rate.\n", "  Turbulent flows laden with inertial particles present multiple open questions\nand are a subject of great interest in current research. Due to their higher\ndensity compared to the carrier fluid, inertial particles tend to form high\nconcentration regions, i.e. clusters, and low concentration regions, i.e.\nvoids, due to the interaction with the turbulence. In this work, we present an\nexperimental investigation of the clustering phenomenon of heavy sub-Kolmogorov\nparticles in homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. Three control parameters\nhave been varied over significant ranges: $Re_{\\lambda} \\in [170 - 450]$,\n$St\\in [0.1 - 5]$ and volume fraction $\\phi_v\\in [2\\times 10^{-6} - 2\\times\n10^{-5}]$. The scaling of clustering characteristics, such as the distribution\nof Vorono\\\"i areas and the dimensions of cluster and void regions, with the\nthree parameters are discussed. In particular, for the polydispersed size\ndistributions considered here, clustering is found to be enhanced strongly\n(quasi-linearly) by $Re_{\\lambda}$ and noticeably (with a square-root\ndependency) with $\\phi_v$, while the cluster and void sizes, scaled with the\nKolmogorov lengthscale $\\eta$, are driven primarily by $Re_{\\lambda}$. Cluster\nlength $\\sqrt{\\langle A_c \\rangle}$ scales up to $\\approx 100 {\\eta}$, measured\nat the highest $Re_{\\lambda}$, while void length $\\sqrt{\\langle A_v \\rangle}$\nscaled also with $\\eta$ is typically two times larger ($\\approx 200 {\\eta}$).\nThe lack of sensitivity of the above characteristics to the Stokes number lends\nsupport to the \"sweep-stick\" particle accumulation scenario. The non-negligible\ninfluence of the volume fraction, however, is not considered by that model and\ncan be connected with collective effects.\n", "  We briefly introduce the disadvantages for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as\nstandard candles to measure the Universe, and suggest Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\ncan serve as a powerful tool for probing the properties of high redshift\nUniverse. We use GRBs as distance indicators in constructing the Hubble diagram\nat redshifts beyond the current reach of SNe Ia observations. Since the\nprogenitors of long GRBs are confirmed to be massive stars, they are deemed as\nan effective approach to study the cosmic star formation rate (SFR). A detailed\nrepresentation of how to measure high-$z$ SFR using GRBs is presented.\nMoreover, first stars can form only in structures that are suitably dense,\nwhich can be parameterized by defining the minimum dark matter halo mass\n$M_{\\rm min}$. $M_{\\rm min}$ must play a crucial role in star formation. The\nassociation of long GRBs with the collapses of massive stars also indicates\nthat the GRB data can be applied to constrain the minimum halo mass $M_{\\rm\nmin}$ and to investigate star formation in dark matter halos.\n", "  Gradient-driven diffusion in crowded, multicomponent mixtures is a topic of\nhigh interest because of its role in biological processes such as transport in\ncell membranes. In partially phase-separated solutions, gradient-driven\ndiffusion affects microstructure, which in turn affects diffusivity; a key\nquestion is how this complex coupling controls both transport and pattern\nformation. To examine these mechanisms, we study a two-dimensional\nmulti-component lattice gas model, where \"tracer\" molecules diffuse between a\nsource and a sink separated by a solution of sticky \"crowder\" molecules that\ncluster to form dynamically evolving obstacles. In the high temperature limit,\ncrowders and tracers are miscible and transport may be predicted analytically.\nAt intermediate temperatures, crowders phase separate into clusters that drift\ntoward the tracer sink. As a result, steady-state tracer diffusivity depends\nnon-monotonically on both temperature and crowder density and we observe a\nvariety of complex microstructures. In the low temperature limit, crowders\nrapidly aggregate to form obstacles that are kinetically arrested; if crowder\ndensity is near the percolation threshold, resulting tracer diffusivity shows\nscaling behavior with the same scaling exponent as the random resistor network\nmodel. Though highly idealized, this simple model reveals fundamental\nmechanisms governing coupled gradient-driven diffusion, phase separation, and\nmicrostructural evolution in crowded solutions.\n", "  Super Earths and mini Neptunes likely have a wide range of atmospheric\ncompositions, ranging from low-molecular mass atmospheres of H2 to higher\nmolecular atmospheres of water, CO2, N2, or other species. Here, we\nsystematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on\ntemperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized\nplanets, using an idealized 3D general circulation model (GCM). The bulk\ncomposition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent\nvariables: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. The effect of molecular\nweight dominates. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to\nhave a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in\nthe thermal phase curve and a smaller zonal wind speed. The width of the\nequatorial super-rotating jet also becomes narrower and the \"jet core\" region,\nwhere the zonal-mean jet speed maximizes, moves to a greater pressure level.\nThe zonal-mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating\npattern in a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere. We also present analytical\ntheories that quantitatively explain the above trends and shed light on the\nunderlying dynamical mechanisms. Those trends might be used to indirectly\ndetermine the atmospheric compositions on tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized\nplanets. The effects of the molar heat capacity are generally small. But if the\nvertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, molar heat capacity will\nplay a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in\nthe upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere.\n", "  We consider scenarios of warped extra-dimensions with all matter fields in\nthe bulk and in which both the hierarchy and the flavor puzzles of the Standard\nModel are addressed. The simplest extra dimensional extension of the Standard\nModel Higgs sector, i.e a 5D bulk Higgs doublet, can be a natural and simple\nexplanation to the 750 GeV excess of diphotons hinted at the LHC, with the\nresonance responsible for the signal being the lightest CP odd excitation\ncoming from the Higgs sector. No new matter content is invoked, the only new\ningredient being the presence of (positive) brane localized kinetic terms\nassociated to the 5D bulk Higgs, which allow to reduce the mass of the lightest\nCP odd Higgs excitation to 750 GeV. Production and decay of this resonance can\nnaturally fit the observed signal when the mass scale of the rest of\nextradimensional resonances is of order 1 TeV.\n", "  As the first paper in a series on the study of the galaxy-galaxy lensing from\nSloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), we present our image\nprocessing pipeline that corrects the systematics primarily introduced by the\nPoint Spread Function (PSF). Using this pipeline, we processed SDSS DR7 imaging\ndata in $r$ band and generated a background galaxy catalog containing the shape\ninformation of each galaxy. Based on our own shape measurements of the galaxy\nimages from SDSS DR7, we extract the galaxy-galaxy (GG) lensing signals around\nforeground spectroscopic galaxies binned in different luminosity and stellar\nmass. The overall signals are in good agreement with those obtained by\n\\citet{Mandelbaum2005, Mandelbaum2006} from the SDSS DR4. The results in this\npaper with higher signal to noise ratio is due to the larger survey area than\nSDSS DR4, confirm that more luminous/massive galaxies bear stronger GG lensing\nsignal. We also divide the foreground galaxies into red/blue and star\nforming/quenched subsamples and measured their GG lensing signals,\nrespectively. We find that, at a specific stellar mass/luminosity, the\nred/quenched galaxies have relatively stronger GG lensing signals than their\ncounterparts especially at large radii. These GG lensing signals can be used to\nprobe the galaxy-halo mass relations and their environmental dependences in the\nhalo occupation or conditional luminosity function framework.\n", "  For the first time the next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections to the\nfull off-shell production of two top quarks that decay leptonically are\npresented. This calculation includes all off-shell, non-resonant, and\ninterference effects for the 6-particle phase space. While the electroweak\ncorrections are below one per cent for the integrated cross section, they reach\nup to 15% in the high-transverse-momentum region of distributions. To support\nthe results of the complete one-loop calculation, we have in addition evaluated\nthe electroweak corrections in two different pole approximations, one requiring\ntwo on-shell top quarks and one featuring two on-shell W bosons. While the\nformer deviates by up to 10% from the full calculation for certain\ndistributions, the latter provides a very good description for most\nobservables. The increased centre-of-mass energy of the LHC makes the inclusion\nof electroweak corrections extremely relevant as they are particularly large in\nthe Sudakov regime where new physics is expected to be probed.\n", "  Disordered systems provide paradigmatic instances of ergodicity breaking and\nlocalization phenomena. Here we explore the dynamics of excitations in a system\nof Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezers. The finite temperature produces an\nintrinsic uncertainty in the atomic positions, which translates into quenched\ncorrelated disorder in the interatomic interaction strengths. In a simple\napproach, the dynamics in the many-body Hilbert space can be understood in\nterms of a one-dimensional Anderson-like model with disorder on every other\nsite, featuring both localized and delocalized states. We conduct an experiment\non an eight-atom chain and observe a clear suppression of excitation transfer.\nOur experiment accesses a regime which is described by a two-dimensional\nAnderson model on a \"trimmed\" square lattice. Our results thus provide a\nconcrete example in which the absence of excitation propagation in a many-body\nsystem is directly related to Anderson-like localization in the Hilbert space,\nwhich is believed to be the mechanism underlying many-body localization.\n", "  A fundamental challenge in physics is controlling the propagation of waves in\ndisordered media despite strong scattering from inhomogeneities. Spatial light\nmodulators enable one to synthesize (shape) the incident wavefront, optimizing\nthe multipath interference to achieve a specific behavior such as focusing\nlight to a target region. However, the extent of achievable control was not\nknown when the target region is much larger than the wavelength and contains\nmany speckles. Here we show that for targets containing more than $g$ speckles,\nwhere $g$ is the dimensionless conductance, the extent of transmission control\nis substantially enhanced by the long-range mesoscopic correlations among the\nspeckles. Using a filtered random matrix ensemble appropriate for coherent\ndiffusion in open geometries, we predict the full distributions of transmission\neigenvalues as well as universal scaling laws for statistical properties, in\nexcellent agreement with our experiment. This work provides a general framework\nfor describing wavefront-shaping experiments in disordered systems.\n", "  Flavor symmetries \\`{a} la Froggatt-Nielsen~(FN) provide a compelling way to\nexplain the hierarchies of fermionic masses and mixing angles in the Yukawa\nsector. In Supersymmetric~(SUSY) extensions of the Standard Model where the\nmediation of SUSY breaking occurs at scales larger than the breaking of flavor,\nthis symmetry must be respected not only by the Yukawas of the superpotential,\nbut by the soft-breaking masses and trilinear terms as well. In this work we\nshow that contrary to naive expectations, even starting with completely flavor\nblind soft-breaking in the full theory at high scales, the low-energy sfermion\nmass matrices and trilinear terms of the effective theory, obtained upon\nintegrating out the heavy mediator fields, are strongly non-universal. We\nexplore the phenomenology of these SUSY flavor models after the latest LHC\nsearches for new physics.\n", "  Condensed matter physics has been driven forward by significant experimental\nand theoretical progress in the study and understanding of equilibrium phase\ntransitions based on symmetry and topology. However, nonequilibrium phase\ntransitions have remained a challenge, in part due to their complexity in\ntheoretical descriptions and the additional experimental difficulties in\nsystematically controlling systems out of equilibrium. Here, we study a\none-dimensional chain of 72 microwave cavities, each coupled to a\nsuperconducting qubit, and coherently drive the system into a nonequilibrium\nsteady state. We find experimental evidence for a dissipative phase transition\nin the system in which the steady state changes dramatically as the mean photon\nnumber is increased. Near the boundary between the two observed phases, the\nsystem demonstrates bistability, with characteristic switching times as long as\n60 ms -- far longer than any of the intrinsic rates known for the system. This\nexperiment demonstrates the power of circuit QED systems for studying\nnonequilibrium condensed matter physics and paves the way for future\nexperiments exploring nonequilbrium physics with many-body quantum optics.\n", "  It has been argued that wormholes are as good a prediction of Einstein's\ntheory as black holes but the theoretical construction requires a reverse\nstrategy, specifying the desired geometric properties of the wormhole and\nleaving open the determination of the stress-energy tensor. We begin by\nconfirming an earlier result by the author showing that a complete wormhole\nsolution can be obtained by adopting the equation of state $p=\\omega\\rho$ and\nassuming that the wormhole admits a one-parameter group of conformal motions.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to use the assumption of conformal symmetry\nto show that the wormhole is stable to linearized radial perturbations whenever\n$-1.5<\\omega <-1$.\n", "  A muon jet ($\\mu$-jet) is a very special feature that consists of a cluster\nof collimated muons from the decay of a fast moving light particle of mass\nabout $\\mathcal{O}$(1 GeV). We will use this feature to search for very light\nparticles from rare decays of the Higgs boson. For such a small angular\nseparation of muons which might come from a long-lived particle, both ATLAS and\nCMS could have the displaced-vertexing-reconstruction capability. We use two\nsimple models of the Higgs-portal type to explore the possibilities of event\ntopologies with two $2\\mu$-jets, one $2\\mu$-jet $\\&$ one $4\\mu$-jet, and two\n$4\\mu$-jets in the final state at LHC-14. We also summarize existing\nconstraints on these models.\n", "  Graviton and gluon scattering are studied from minimal physical assumptions\nsuch as Poincare and gauge symmetry as well as unitarity. The assumptions lead\nto an interesting and surprisingly restrictive set of linear equations. This\nshows gluon and graviton scattering to be related in many field and string\ntheories, explaining and extending several known results. By systematic\nanalysis exceptional graviton scattering amplitudes are derived which in\ngeneral dimensions can not be related to gluon amplitudes. The simplicity of\nthe formalism guarantees wide further applicability to gauge and gravity\ntheories.\n", "  The second-generation of gravitational-wave detectors are just starting\noperation, and have already yielding their first detections. Research is now\nconcentrated on how to maximize the scientific potential of gravitational-wave\nastronomy. To support this effort, we present here design targets for a new\ngeneration of detectors, which will be capable of observing compact binary\nsources with high signal-to-noise ratio throughout the Universe.\n", "  In this work, we studied cobalt nitride (Co-N) thin films deposited using a\ndc magnetron sputtering method at a substrate temperature (\\Ts) of 523\\,K. We\nfind that independent of the reactive gas flow (\\pn) used during sputtering,\nthe phases of Co-N formed at this temperature seems to be identical having N\n\\pat~$\\sim$5. This is contrary to Co-N phases formed at lower \\Ts. For\n\\Ts$\\sim$300\\,K, an evolution of Co-N phases starting from\nCo(N)$\\rightarrow$\\tcn$\\rightarrow$Co$_3$N$\\rightarrow$CoN can be seen as \\pn\nincreases to 100\\p, whereas when the substrate temperature increases to 523\\,K,\nthe phase formed is a mixture of Co and \\tcn, independent of the {\\pn} used\nduring sputtering. We used x-ray diffraction (XRD) to probe long range\nordering, x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Co absorption edge for the\nlocal structure, Magneto-optical Kerr e ffect (MOKE) and polarized neutron\nreflectivity (PNR) to measure the magnetization of samples. Quantification of N\n\\pat~was done using secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). Measurements\nsuggest that the magnetic moment of Co-N samples deposited at 523\\,K is\nslightly higher than the bulk Co moment and does not get affected with the\n\\pn~used for reactive sputtering. Our results provide an important insight\nabout the phase formation of Co-N thin films which is discussed in this work.\n", "  Detecting the imprint of inflationary gravitational waves on the $B$-mode\npolarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is one of the main\nscience cases for current and next-generation CMB experiments. In this work we\nexplore some of the challenges that ground-based facilities will have to face\nin order to carry out this measurement in the presence of Galactic foregrounds\nand correlated atmospheric noise. We present forecasts for Stage-3 (S3) and\nplanned Stage-4 (S4) experiments based on the analysis of simulated sky maps\nusing a map-based Bayesian foreground cleaning method. Our results thus\nconsistently propagate the uncertainties on foreground parameters such as\nspatially-varying spectral indices, as well as the bias on the measured\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ caused by an incorrect modelling of the foregrounds.\nWe find that S3 and S4-like experiments should be able to put constraints on\n$r$ of the order $\\sigma(r)=(0.5-1.0)\\times10^{-2}$ and\n$\\sigma(r)=(0.5-1.0)\\times10^{-3}$ respectively, assuming instrumental\nsystematic effects are under control. We further study deviations from the\nfiducial foreground model, finding that, while the effects of a second\npolarized dust component would be minimal on both S3 and S4, a 2\\% polarized\nanomalous dust emission (AME) component would be clearly detectable by Stage-4\nexperiments.\n", "  We announce the discovery of KELT-16b, a highly irradiated, ultra-short\nperiod hot Jupiter transiting the relatively bright ($V = 11.7$) star TYC\n2688-1839-1. A global analysis of the system shows KELT-16 to be an F7V star\nwith $T_\\textrm{eff} = 6236\\pm54$ K, $\\log{g_\\star} = 4.253_{-0.036}^{+0.031}$,\n[Fe/H] = -0.002$_{-0.085}^{+0.086}$, $M_\\star = 1.211_{-0.046}^{+0.043}\nM_\\odot$, and $R_\\star = 1.360_{-0.053}^{+0.064} R_\\odot$. The planet is a\nrelatively high mass inflated gas giant with $M_\\textrm{P} =\n2.75_{-0.15}^{+0.16} M_\\textrm{J}$, $R_\\textrm{P} = 1.415_{-0.067}^{+0.084}\nR_\\textrm{J}$, density $\\rho_\\textrm{P} = 1.20\\pm0.18$ g cm$^{-3}$, surface\ngravity $\\log{g_\\textrm{P}} = 3.530_{-0.049}^{+0.042}$, and $T_\\textrm{eq} =\n2453_{-47}^{+55}$ K. The best-fitting linear ephemeris is $T_\\textrm{C} =\n2457247.24791\\pm0.00019$ BJD$_{tdb}$ and $P = 0.9689951 \\pm 0.0000024$ d.\nKELT-16b joins WASP-18b, -19b, -43b, -103b, and HATS-18b as the only giant\ntransiting planets with $P < 1$ day. Its ultra-short period and high\nirradiation make it a benchmark target for atmospheric studies by HST, Spitzer,\nand eventually JWST. For example, as a hotter, higher mass analog of WASP-43b,\nKELT-16b may feature an atmospheric temperature-pressure inversion and\nday-to-night temperature swing extreme enough for TiO to rain out at the\nterminator. KELT-16b could also join WASP-43b in extending tests of the\nobserved mass-metallicity relation of the Solar System gas giants to higher\nmasses. KELT-16b currently orbits at a mere $\\sim$ 1.7 Roche radii from its\nhost star, and could be tidally disrupted in as little as a few $\\times 10^{5}$\nyears (for a stellar tidal quality factor of $Q_*' = 10^5$). Finally, the\nlikely existence of a widely separated bound stellar companion in the KELT-16\nsystem makes it possible that Kozai-Lidov oscillations played a role in driving\nKELT-16b inward to its current precarious orbit.\n", "  We present the first measurement of the CP violating charge asymmetry in\n$B^\\pm \\to \\mu^\\pm \\nu_\\mu {D}^0$ decays using the full Run II integrated\nluminosity of 10.4 fb$^{-1}$ in proton-antiproton collisions collected with the\nD0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. We measure a difference in the\nyield of $B^-$ and $B^+$ mesons in these decays by fitting the reconstructed\ninvariant mass distributions. This results in an asymmetry of $A^{\\mu D^{0}}\n=\\left[ -0.14 \\pm 0.20 \\right]\\%$, which is consistent with standard model\npredictions.\n", "  We present the discovery, from archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data, of X-ray\neclipses in two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), located in the same region\nof the galaxy M 51: CXOM51 J132940.0$+$471237 (ULX-1, for simplicity) and\nCXOM51 J132939.5$+$471244 (ULX-2). Three eclipses were detected for ULX-1, two\nfor ULX-2. The presence of eclipses puts strong constraints on the viewing\nangle, suggesting that both ULXs are seen almost edge-on and are certainly not\nbeamed towards us. Despite the similar viewing angles and luminosities ($L_{\\rm\nX} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.3$-$8$ keV band for both\nsources), their X-ray properties are different. ULX-1 has a soft spectrum, well\nfitted by Comptonization emission from a medium with electron temperature $kT_e\n\\approx 1$ keV. ULX-2 is harder, well fitted by a slim disk with $kT_{\\rm in}\n\\approx 1.5$-$1.8$ keV and normalization consistent with a $\\sim 10 M_{\\odot}$\nblack hole. ULX-1 has a significant contribution from multi-temperature thermal\nplasma emission ($L_{\\rm X,mekal} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$);\nabout $10$% of this emission remains visible during the eclipses, proving that\nthe emitting gas comes from a region slightly more extended than the size of\nthe donor star. From the sequence and duration of the Chandra observations in\nand out of eclipse, we constrain the binary period of ULX-1 to be either\n$\\approx 6.3$ days, or $\\approx 12.5-13$ days. If the donor star fills its\nRoche lobe (a plausible assumption for ULXs), both cases require an evolved\ndonor; most likely a blue supergiant, given the young age of the stellar\npopulation in that galactic environment.\n", "  In a recent work [D. Malpetti and T. Roscilde, arXiv:1605.04223] we have\nshown that in quantum many-body systems at finite temperature, two-point\ncorrelations can be formally separated into a thermal part, and a quantum part\n-- and that generically quantum correlations decay exponentially at finite\ntemperature, with a characteristic, temperature-dependent quantum coherence\nlength. The existence of these two different forms of correlation in quantum\nmany-body systems suggests the possibility of formulating an approximation\nwhich affects quantum correlations only, without preventing the correct\ndescription of classical fluctuations at all length scales. Focusing on lattice\nboson and quantum Ising models, we make use of the path-integral formulation of\nquantum statistical mechanics to introduce such an approximation -- that we dub\n\\emph{quantum mean-field} (QMF) approach, and which can be readily generalized\nto a cluster form (cluster QMF or cQMF). The cQMF approximation reduces to\ncluster mean-field theory at $T=0$, while at any finite temperature it produces\na family of systematically improved, semi-classical approximations to the\nquantum statistical mechanics of the lattice theory at hand. Contrary to\nstandard MF approximations, the correct nature of thermal critical phenomena is\ncaptured by any cluster size. In the two exemplary cases of the two-dimensional\nquantum Ising model and of two-dimensional quantum rotors, we study\nsystematically the convergence of the cQMF approximation towards the exact\nresult, and show that the convergence is typically linear or sub-linear in the\n{ boundary-to-bulk ratio} of the clusters as $T\\to 0$, while it becomes faster\nthan linear as $T$ grows. These results pave the way towards the development of\nsemi-classical numerical approaches based on an approximate, { yet}\nsystematically improved account of quantum correlations.\n", "  In [1] the horizon fluffs proposal is put forward to identify microstates of\ngeneric non-extremal three-dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black\nholes. The proposal is that black hole microstates, which were dubbed as\nhorizon fluffs, are states labelled by the conserved charges associated with\nnon-trivial diffeomorphisms on the near horizon geometry and these states are\nnot in the coadjoint orbits of the asymptotic Virasoro algebra at the\nBrown-Henneaux central charge, associated with the BTZ black holes. It is also\nknown that AdS3 Einstein gravity has more general black hole solutions than the\nBTZ family which are generically described by two periodic, but otherwise\narbitrary, holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions. We show that these\ngeneral AdS3 black holes which are typically conformal descendants of the BTZ\nblack holes and are characterised by the associated Virasoro coadjoint orbits,\nappear as coherent states in the asymptotic symmetry algebra corresponding to\nthe black hole family. We apply the horizon fluffs proposal to these generic\nAdS3 black holes and identify the corresponding microstates. We then perform\nmicrostate counting and compute the entropy. The entropy appears to be an orbit\ninvariant quantity, providing an important check for the horizon fluffs\nproposal.\n", "  The bright, short and hard GRB 090510 was detected by all instruments aboard\nFermi and Swift satellites. The multiwavelength observations of this burst\npresented similar features with the Fermi-LAT-detected gamma-ray bursts. In the\nframework of the external shock model of early afterglow, a leptonic scenario\nthat evolves in a homogeneous medium is proposed to revisit GRB 090510 and\nexplain the multiwavelength light curve observations presented in this burst.\nThese observations are consistent with the evolution of a jet before and after\nthe jet break. The long-lasting LAT, X-ray and optical fluxes are explained in\nthe synchrotron emission from the adiabatic forward shock. Synchrotron\nself-Compton emission from the reverse shock is consistent with the bright LAT\npeak provided that progenitor environment is entrained with strong magnetic\nfields. It could provide compelling evidence of magnetic field amplification in\nthe neutron star merger.\n", "  A hybrid phase transition (HPT) that exhibits properties of continuous and\ndiscontinuous phase transitions at the same transition point has been observed\nin diverse complex systems. Previous studies of the HPTs on complex networks\nmainly focused on whether the order parameter is continuous or discontinuous.\nHowever, more careful and fundamental questions on the critical behaviors of\nthe HPT such as how the divergences of the susceptibility and of the\ncorrelation size are affected by the discontinuity of the order parameter have\nbeen addressed. Here, we consider a generalized epidemic model that is known to\nexhibit a discontinuous transition as a spinodal transition. Performing\nextensive numerical simulations and using finite-size scaling analysis, we\nexamine diverging behaviors of the susceptibility and the correlation size. We\nfind that when there is one infectious node and under a certain condition, the\norder parameter can exhibit a discontinuous jump but does not exhibit any\ncritical behavior before or after the jump. This feature differs from what we\nobserved in HPTs in the percolation pruning process. However, critical behavior\nappears in the form of a power-law behavior of the outbreak size distribution.\nThe mean outbreak size, corresponding to the susceptibility, diverge following\nthe conventional percolation behavior. Thus a mixed-order transition occurs.\nThe hyperscaling relation does not hold.\n", "  Actinide-containing complexes present formidable challenges for electronic\nstructure methods due to the large number of degenerate or quasi-degenerate\nelectronic states arising from partially occupied 5f and 6d shells.\nConventional multi-reference methods can treat active spaces that are often at\nthe upper limit of what is required for a proper treatment of species with\ncomplex electronic structures, leaving no room for verifying their suitability.\nIn this work we address the issue of properly defining the active spaces in\nsuch calculations, and introduce a protocol to determine optimal active spaces\nbased on the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm and\nconcepts of quantum information theory. We apply the protocol to elucidate the\nelectronic structure and bonding mechanism of volatile plutonium oxides\n(PuO$_3$ and PuO$_2$(OH)$_2$), species associated with nuclear safety issues\nfor which little is known about the electronic structure and energetics. We\nshow how, within a scalar relativistic framework, orbital-pair correlations can\nbe used to guide the definition of optimal active spaces which provide an\naccurate description of static/non-dynamic electron correlation, as well as to\nanalyse the chemical bonding beyond a simple orbital model. From this bonding\nanalysis we are able to show that the addition of oxo- or hydroxo-groups to the\nplutonium dioxide species considerably changes the pi-bonding mechanism with\nrespect to the bare triatomics, resulting in bent structures with considerable\nmulti-reference character.\n", "  The out-of-time-ordered (OTO) correlation is a key quantity for quantifying\nquantum chaoticity and has been recently used in the investigation of quantum\nholography. Here we use it to study and characterize many-body localization\n(MBL). We find that a long-time logarithmic variation of the OTO correlation\noccurs in the MBL phase but is absent in the Anderson localized and ergodic\nphases. We extract a localization length in the MBL phase, which depends\nlogarithmically on interaction and diverges at a critical interaction.\nFurthermore, the infinite-time `thermal' fluctuation of the OTO correlation is\nzero (finite) in the ergodic (MBL) phase and thus can be considered as an order\nparameter for the ergodic-MBL transition, through which the transition can be\nidentified and characterized. Specifically, the critical point and the related\ncritical exponents can be calculated.\n", "  Deep-Earth volatile cycles couple the mantle with near-surface reservoirs.\nVolatiles are emitted by volcanism and, in particular, from mid-ocean ridges,\nwhich are the most prolific source of basaltic volcanism. Estimates of volatile\nextraction from the asthenosphere beneath ridges typically rely on measurements\nof undegassed lavas combined with simple petrogenetic models of the mean degree\nof melting. Estimated volatile fluxes have large uncertainties; this is partly\ndue to a poor understanding of how volatiles are transported by magma in the\nasthenosphere. Here, we assess the fate of mantle volatiles through numerical\nsimulations of melting and melt transport at mid-ocean ridges. Our simulations\nare based on two-phase, magma/mantle dynamics theory coupled to idealised\nthermodynamic model of mantle melting in the presence of water and carbon\ndioxide. We combine simulation results with catalogued observations of all\nridge segments to estimate a range of likely volatile output from the global\nmid-ocean ridge system. We thus predict global MOR crust production of 66-73\nGt/yr (22-24 km3/yr) and global volatile output of 52-110 Mt/yr, corresponding\nto mantle volatile contents of 100--200~ppm. We find that volatile extraction\nis limited: up to half of deep, volatile-rich melt is not focused to the axis\nbut is rather deposited along the LAB. As these distal melts crystallise and\nfractionate, they metasomatise the base of the lithosphere, creating\nrheological heterogeneity that could contribute to the seismic signature of the\nLAB.\n", "  The position-dependent power spectrum has been recently proposed as a\ndescriptor of gravitationally induced non-Gaussianity in galaxy clustering, as\nit is sensitive to the \"soft limit\" of the bispectrum (i.e. when one of the\nwave number tends to zero). We generalise this concept to higher order and\nclarify their relationship to other known statistics such as the skew-spectrum,\nthe kurt-spectra and their real-space counterparts the cumulants correlators.\nUsing the {\\em Hierarchical Ansatz} (HA) as a toy model for the higher order\ncorrelation hierarchy, we show how in the soft limit, polyspectra at a given\norder can be identified with lower order polyspectra with the same geometrical\ndependence but with {\\em renormalised} amplitudes expressed in terms of\namplitudes of the original polyspectra. We extend the concept of\nposition-dependent bispectrum to bispectrum of the divergence of the velocity\nfield $\\Theta$ and mixed multispectra involving $\\delta$ and $\\Theta$ in the 3D\nperturbative regime. To quantify the effects of transients in numerical\nsimulations, we also present results for lowest order in Lagrangian\nperturbation theory (LPT) or the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). Finally, we\ndiscuss how to extend the position-dependent spectrum concept to encompass\ncross-spectra. And finally study the application of this concept to two\ndimensions (2D), for projected galaxy maps, convergence $\\kappa$ maps from\nweak-lensing surveys or maps of CMB secondaries e.g. the frequency cleaned $y$\n- parameter maps of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect from CMB surveys.\n", "  We show that asymptotically future deSitter (AFdS) spacetimes carry 'genuine'\ncosmic hair; information that is analogous to the mass and angular momentum of\nasymptotically flat spacetimes and that characterizes how an AFdS spacetime\napproaches its asymptotic form. We define new 'cosmological tension' charges\nassociated with future asymptotic spatial translation symmetries, which are\nanalytic continuations of the ADM mass and tensions of asymptotically planar\nAdS spacetimes, and which measure the leading anisotropic corrections to the\nisotropic, exponential deSitter expansion rate. A cosmological Smarr relation,\nholding for AFdS spacetimes having exact spatial translation symmetry, is\nderived. This formula relates cosmological tension, which is evaluated at\nfuture infinity, to properties of the cosmology at early times, together with a\n'cosmological volume' contribution that is analogous to the thermodynamic\nvolume of AdS black holes. Smarr relations for different spatial directions\nimply that the difference in expansion rates between two directions at late\ntimes is related in a simple way to their difference at early times. Hence\ninformation about the very early universe can be inferred from cosmic hair,\nwhich is potentially observable in a late time deSitter phase. Cosmological\ntension charges and related quantities are evaluated for Kasner-deSitter\nspacetimes, which serve as our primary examples.\n", "  We propose a new technique for the calibration of nuclear recoils in large\nnoble element dual-phase time projection chambers used to search for WIMP dark\nmatter in the local galactic halo. This technique provides an $\\textit{in\nsitu}$ measurement of the low-energy nuclear recoil response of the target\nmedia using the measured scattering angle between multiple neutron interactions\nwithin the detector volume. The low-energy reach and reduced systematics of\nthis calibration have particular significance for the low-mass WIMP sensitivity\nof several leading dark matter experiments. Multiple strategies for improving\nthis calibration technique are discussed, including the creation of a new type\nof quasi-monoenergetic 272 keV neutron source. We report results from a\ntime-of-flight based measurement of the neutron energy spectrum produced by an\nAdelphi Technology, Inc. DD108 neutron generator, confirming its suitability\nfor the proposed nuclear recoil calibration.\n", "  At the tail of its velocity distribution, cold dark matter (DM) can\nannihilate at finite temperature to states heavier than itself. We explore the\npossibility that DM freezeout is dictated by these \"forbidden annihilations\" at\nthe electroweak scale. Demanding that annihilation products be Standard Model\nparticles, we find that for the forbidden mechanism to primarily set the DM\nrelic abundance, DM must couple predominantly, if not solely, to top quarks.\nThis can be arranged by invoking a non-trivial flavor structure such as Minimal\nFlavor Violation. We avail two avenues to achieve the correct thermal\ncross-section, requiring a mediator exchanged in the $s$- or $t$-channel. These\nsimplified models submit easily to direct detection and collider searches, and\nnecessarily hide from indirect detection signals. Viable supersymmetric spectra\ninvolving the forbidden mechanism may be found if combined with\nco-annihilation.\n", "  In this article, we report negative thermal expansion and spin frustration in\nhexagonal GdInO$_{3}$. Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns reveal that the\nnegative thermal expansion in the temperature range of 50-100K stems from the\ntriangular lattice of Gd$^{3+}$ ions. At low temperature, the downward\ndeviation of the inverse susceptibility ($\\chi^{-1}$) vs. $T$ plot from the\nCurie-Weiss law indicates spin frustration which inhibits long-range magnetic\nordering down to 2K. Magnetostriction measurements clearly demonstrate a strong\nspin-lattice coupling. Low temperature anomalous phonon softening, as obtained\nfrom temperature dependent Raman measurements, also reveals the same. Our\nexperimental observations are supported by first principles density functional\ntheory calculations of the electronic and phonon dispersion of GdInO$_3$. The\ncalculations suggest that the GdInO$_3$ lattice is highly frustrated at low\ntemperature. Further, the calculated normal mode frequencies of the Gd related\n$\\Gamma$ point phonons are found to depend on the magnetic structure of the\nlattice, suggesting significant magneto-elastic coupling.\n", "  In relativistic inhomogeneous cosmology, structure formation couples to\naverage cosmological expansion. A conservative approach to modelling this\nassumes an Einstein--de Sitter model (EdS) at early times and extrapolates this\nforward in cosmological time as a \"background model\" against which average\nproperties of today's Universe can be measured. This requires adopting an\nearly-epoch--normalised background Hubble constant $H_1^{bg}$. Here, we show\nthat the $\\Lambda$CDM model can be used as an observational proxy to estimate\n$H_1^{bg}$ rather than choose it arbitrarily. We assume (i) an EdS model at\nearly times; (ii) a zero dark energy parameter; (iii) bi-domain scalar\naveraging---division of the spatial sections into over- and underdense regions;\nand (iv) virialisation (stable clustering) of collapsed regions. We find\n$H_1^{bg}= 37.7 \\pm 0.4$ km/s/Mpc (random error only) based on a Planck\n$\\Lambda$CDM observational proxy. Moreover, since the scalar-averaged expansion\nrate is expected to exceed the (extrapolated) background expansion rate, the\nexpected age of the Universe should be much less than $2/(3 H_1^{bg}) = 17.3$\nGyr. The maximum stellar age of Galactic Bulge microlensed low-mass stars (most\nlikely: 14.7 Gyr; 68\\% confidence: 14.0--15.0 Gyr) suggests an age about a Gyr\nolder than the (no-backreaction) $\\Lambda$CDM estimate.\n", "  The $\\gamma+\\gamma\\rightarrow J/\\psi+c+\\bar{c}$ inclusive process is an\nextremely important subprocess in $J/\\psi$ production via photon-photon\nscattering, like at LEP\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2} or various types\nfuture electron-positron colliders. In this work we perform the\nnext-to-leading(NLO) QCD corrections to this process in the framework of\nnon-relativistic QCD(NRQCD) factorization formalism, the first NLO calculation\nfor two projectiles to 3-body quarkonium inclusive production process. By\nsetting the center-of-mass energy at LEP\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2},\nthe $\\sqrt{s}=197$ GeV, we conduct analyses of the $p_t^2$ distribution and\ntotal cross section of this process at the NLO accuracy. It turns out that the\ntotal cross section is moderately enhanced by the NLO correction with a $K$\nfactor of about 1.46, and hence the discrepancy between DELPHI data and\ncolor-singlet(CS) calculation is reduced while the color-octet(CO)\ncontributions are still inevitable at this order. At the future Circular\nElectron-Positron Collider(CEPC), the NLO corrections are found to be more\nsignificant, with a $K$ factor of about 1.76.\n", "  The theory for the generation of Wannier functions within the generalized\nPipek--Mezey approach [Lehtola, S.; J\\'onsson, H. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014,\n10, 642] is presented and an implementation thereof is described. Results are\npresented for systems with periodicity in one, two and three dimensions as well\nas isolated molecules. The generalized Pipek--Mezey Wannier functions (PMWF)\nare highly localized orbitals consistent with chemical intuition where a\ndistinction is maintained between {\\sigma}- and {\\pi}-orbitals. The PMWF method\nis compared with the so-called maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF)\nthat are frequently used for the analysis of condensed matter calculations.\nWhereas PMWFs maximize the localization criterion of Pipek and Mezey, MLWFs\nmaximize that of Foster and Boys and have the disadvantage of mixing {\\sigma}-\nand {\\pi}-orbitals in many cases. The PMWF orbitals turn out to be as localized\nas the MLWF orbitals as evidenced by cross-comparison of the values of the PMWF\nand MLWF objective functions for the two types of orbitals. Our implementation\nin the atomic simulation environment (ASE) is compatible with various\nrepresentations of the wave function, including real-space grids, plane waves\nand linear combinations of atomic orbitals. The projector augmented wave\nformalism for the representation of atomic core electrons is also supported.\nResults of calculations with the GPAW software are described here, but our\nimplementation can also use output from other electronic structure software\nsuch as ABINIT, NWChem and VASP.\n", "  Using deep inelastic scattering on a large nucleus as an example, we consider\nthe transverse momentum broadening of partons in hard processes in the presence\nof medium. We find that one can factorize the vacuum radiation contribution and\nmedium related $P_T$ broadening effects into the Sudakov factor and medium\ndependent distributions, respectively. Our derivations can be generalized to\nother hard processes, such as dijet productions, which can be used as a probe\nto measure the medium $P_T$ broadening effects in heavy ion collisions when\nSudakov effects are not overwhelming.\n", "  AstroSat is a multi-wavelength satellite launched on 2015 September 28. The\nCZT Imager of AstroSat on its very first day of operation detected a long\nduration gamma-ray burst (GRB) namely GRB 151006A. Using the off-axis imaging\nand spectral response of the instrument, we demonstrate that CZT Imager can\nlocalise this GRB correct to about a few degrees and it can provide, in\nconjunction with Swift, spectral parameters similar to that obtained from\nFermi/GBM. Hence CZT Imager would be a useful addition to the currently\noperating GRB instruments (Swift and Fermi). Specifically, we argue that the\nCZT Imager will be most useful for the short hard GRBs by providing\nlocalisation for those detected by Fermi and spectral information for those\ndetected only by Swift. We also provide preliminary results on a new exciting\ncapability of this instrument: CZT Imager is able to identify Compton scattered\nevents thereby providing polarisation information for bright GRBs. GRB 151006A,\nin spite of being relatively faint, shows hints of a polarisation signal at\n100-300 keV (though at a low significance level). We point out that CZT Imager\nshould provide significant time resolved polarisation measurements for GRBs\nthat have fluence 3 times higher than that of GRB 151006A. We estimate that the\nnumber of such bright GRBs detectable by CZT Imager is 5 - 6 per year. CZT\nImager can also act as a good hard X-ray monitoring device for possible\nelectromagnetic counterparts of Gravitational Wave events.\n", "  We show that a black-hole binary with an external companion can undergo\nLidov-Kozai cycles that cause a close pericenter passage, leading to a rapid\nmerger due to gravitational-wave emission. This scenario occurs most often for\nsystems in which the companion has mass comparable to the reduced mass of the\nbinary and the companion orbit has semi-major axis within a factor of $\\sim 10$\nof the binary semi-major axis. Using a simple population-synthesis model and\n3-body simulations, we estimate the rate of mergers in triple black hole\nsystems in the field to be about six per Gpc$^3$ per year in the absence of\nnatal kicks during black hole formation. This value is within the low end of\nthe 90\\% credible interval for the total black-hole black-hole merger rate\ninferred from the current LIGO results. There are many uncertainties in these\ncalculations, the largest of which is the unknown distribution of natal kicks.\nEven modest natal kicks of $40\\mbox{km s}^{-1}$ will reduce the merger rate by\na factor of 40. A few percent of these systems will have eccentricity greater\nthan 0.999 when they first enter the frequency band detectable by aLIGO (above\n10 Hz).\n", "  Using four different suites of cosmological simulations, we generate\nsynthetic spectra for galaxies with different Lyman continuum escape fractions\n(fesc) at redshifts z=7-9, in the rest-frame wavelength range relevant for the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec instrument. By investigating the\neffects of realistic star formation histories and metallicity distributions on\nthe EW(Hb)-beta diagram (previously proposed as a tool for identifying galaxies\nwith very high fesc), we find that neither of these effects are likely to\njeopardize the identification of galaxies with extreme Lyman continuum leakage.\nBased on our models, we expect essentially all z=7-9 galaxies that exhibit\nrest-frame EW(Hb)< 30 {\\AA} to have fesc>0.5. Incorrect assumptions concerning\nthe ionizing fluxes of stellar populations or the dust properties of z>6\ngalaxies can in principle bias the selection, but substantial model\ndeficiencies of this type will at the same time reveal themselves as an offset\nbetween the observed and simulated distribution of z>6 galaxies in the\nEW(Hb)-beta diagram. Such offsets would thereby allow JWST/NIRSpec measurements\nof these observables to serve as input for further model refinement.\n", "  Vortex motion is a complex problem due to the interplay between the\nshort-range physics at the vortex core level and the long-range hydrodynamical\neffects. Here we show that the hydrodynamic equations of vortex motion in a\ncompressible superfluid can be solved exactly in a model \"slab\" geometry.\nStarting from an exact solution for an incompressible fluid, the hydrodynamic\nequations are solved with a series expansion in a small tunable parameter\nprovided by the ratio of the healing length, characterizing the vortex cores,\nto the slab width. The key dynamical properties of the vortex, the inertial and\nphysical masses, are well defined and renormalizable. They are calculated at\nleading order beyond the logarithmic accuracy that has limited previous\napproaches. Our results provide a solid framework for further detailed study of\nthe vortex mass and vortex forces in strongly-correlated and exotic\nsuperfluids. The proposed geometry can be realised in quantum-gas experiments\nwhere high-precision measurements of vortex mass parameters are feasible.\n", "  Trilayer graphene (TLG) exhibits rich novel electronic properties and\nextraordinary quantum Hall phenomena owning to enhanced electronic interactions\nand tunable chirality of its quasiparticles. Here, we report direct observation\nof chirality transition of quasiparticles at stacking solitons of TLG via\nspatial-resolved Landau level spectroscopy. The one-dimensional stacking\nsolitons with width of the order of 10 nm separate adjacent Bernal-stacked TLG\nand rhombohedral-stacked TLG. By using high field tunneling spectra of scanning\ntunneling microscopy, we measured Landau quantization in both the\nBernal-stacked TLG and the rhombohedral-stacked TLG and, importantly, we\nobserved evolution of quasiparticles between the chiral degree l = 1&2 and l =\n3 across the stacking domain wall solitons. Our experiment indicates that such\na chirality transition occurs smoothly, accompanying the transition of the\nstacking orders of TLG, around the domain wall solitons. This result\ndemonstrates the important and hitherto neglected relationship between the\ncrystallographic stacking order and the chirality of quasiparticles in graphene\nsystems.\n", "  Generating robust entanglement among solid-state spins is key for\napplications in quantum information processing and precision sensing. We show\nhere a dissipative approach to generate such entanglement among the hyperfine\ncoupled electron nuclear spins using the rapid optical decay of electronic\nexcited states. The combined dark state interference effects of the optical and\nmicrowave driving fields in the presence of spontaneous emission from the\nshort-lived excited state leads to a dissipative formation of an entangled\nsteady state. We show that the dissipative entanglement is generated for any\ninitial state conditions of the spins and is resilient to external field\nfluctuations. We analyze the scheme both for continuous and pulsed driving\nfields in the presence of realistic noise sources.\n", "  We study the excitation of a two-level system (2LS) by quantum light, thereby\nbringing our previous studies~(see part~I. of this series) to a target that is\nquantum itself. While there is no gain for the quantum state of the target as\ncompared to driving it with classical light, its dynamical features, such as\nantibunching, can be improved. We propose a chain of two-level systems, i.e.,\nsetting the emission of each 2LS as the driving source of the following one, as\nan arrangement to provide better single-photon sources. At a fundamental level,\nwe discuss the notion of strong-coupling between quantum light from a source\nand its target, and the several versions of the Mollow triplet that follow from\nvarious types of driving light. We discuss the Heitler effect of antibunched\nphotons from the scattered light off a laser.\n", "  In H-alpha most of the solar surface is covered by dense canopies of long\nopaque fibrils, but predictions for quiet-Sun observations with ALMA have\nignored this fact. Comparison with Ly-alpha suggests that the large opacity of\nH-alpha fibrils is caused by hot precursor events. Application of a recipe that\nassumes momentary Saha-Boltzmann extinction during their hot onset to\nmillimeter wavelengths suggests that ALMA will observe H-alpha-like fibril\ncanopies, not acoustic shocks underneath, and will yield data more interesting\nthan if these canopies were transparent.\n", "  We propose a method for detecting the presence of a single spin in a crystal\nby coupling it to a high-quality factor superconducting planar resonator. By\nconfining the microwave field in a constriction of nanometric dimensions, the\ncoupling constant can be as high as $5-10$\\,kHz. This coupling affects the\namplitude of the field emitted by the resonator, and the integrated homodyne\nsignal allows detection of a single spin with unit signal-to-noise ratio within\nfew milliseconds. We further show that a stochastic master equation approach\nand a Bayesian analysis of the full time dependent homodyne signal improves\nthis figure by $\\sim 30\\%$ for typical parameters.\n", "  We explore general scalar-tensor models in the presence of a kinetic mixing\nbetween matter and the scalar field, which we call Kinetic Matter Mixing. In\nthe frame where gravity is de-mixed from the scalar this is due to disformal\ncouplings of matter species to the gravitational sector, with disformal\ncoefficients that depend on the gradient of the scalar field. In the frame\nwhere matter is minimally coupled, it originates from the so-called beyond\nHorndeski quadratic Lagrangian. We extend the Effective Theory of Interacting\nDark Energy by allowing disformal coupling coefficients to depend on the\ngradient of the scalar field as well. In this very general approach, we derive\nthe conditions to avoid ghost and gradient instabilities and we define Kinetic\nMatter Mixing independently of the frame metric used to described the action.\nWe study its phenomenological consequences for a $\\Lambda$CDM background\nevolution, first analytically on small scales. Then, we compute the matter\npower spectrum and the angular spectra of the CMB anisotropies and the CMB\nlensing potential, on all scales. We employ the public version of COOP, a\nnumerical Einstein-Boltzmann solver that implements very general scalar-tensor\nmodifications of gravity. Rather uniquely, Kinetic Matter Mixing weakens\ngravity on short scales, predicting a lower $\\sigma_8$ with respect to the\n$\\Lambda$CDM case. We propose this as a possible solution to the tension\nbetween the CMB best-fit model and low-redshift observables.\n", "  We numerically solve the evolution equations of neutrino three-flavor density\nmatrices, and show that, even if neutrino oscillations mix neutrino flavors,\nlarge lepton number asymmetries are still allowed in certain limits by Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis (BBN).\n", "  We analyze the prospects for detection of light sub-GeV dark matter produced\nin experiments designed to study the properties of neutrinos, such as\nMiniBooNE, T2K, SHiP, DUNE etc. We present an improved production model, when\ndark matter couples to hadronic states via a dark photon or baryonic vector\nmediator, incorporating bremsstrahlung of the dark vector. In addition to\nelastic scattering, we also study signatures of light dark matter undergoing\ndeep inelastic or quasi-elastic NC$\\pi^0$-like scattering in the detector\nproducing neutral pions, which for certain experiments may provide the best\nsensitivity.\n  An extensive appendix provides documentation for a publicly available\nsimulation tool {\\tt BdNMC} that can be applied to determine the hidden sector\ndark matter production and scattering rate at a range of proton fixed target\nexperiments.\n", "  A peculiar source in the Galactic center known as the Dusty S-cluster Object\n(DSO/G2) moves on a highly eccentric orbit around the supermassive black hole\nwith the pericenter passage in the spring of 2014. Its nature has been\nuncertain mainly because of the lack of any information about its intrinsic\ngeometry. For the first time, we use near-infrared polarimetric imaging data to\nobtain constraints about the geometrical properties of the DSO. We find out\nthat DSO is an intrinsically polarized source, based on the significance\nanalysis of polarization parameters, with the degree of the polarization of\n$\\sim 30\\%$ and an alternating polarization angle as it approaches the position\nof Sgr A*. Since the DSO exhibits a near-infrared excess of $K_{\\rm s}-L'>3$\nand remains rather compact in emission-line maps, its main characteristics may\nbe explained with the model of a pre-main-sequence star embedded in a\nnon-spherical dusty envelope.\n", "  We present a temperature dependent study of the thermal excitation of\nmagnonic spin currents in two-sublattice magnetic materials. Using atomistic\nspin model simulations, we study the local magnetization profiles in the\nvicinity of a temperature step in antiferromagnets, as well as in ferrimagnets.\nIt is shown that the strength of the excitation of the spin currents in these\nsystems scales with the derivative of the magnetization with respect to the\ntemperature.\n", "  We present the Collection of Elemental Routines for Echelle Spectra (CERES).\nThese routines were developed for the construction of automated pipelines for\nthe reduction, extraction and analysis of spectra acquired with different\ninstruments, allowing the obtention of homogeneous and standardised results.\nThis modular code includes tools for handling the different steps of the\nprocessing: CCD image reductions, identification and tracing of the echelle\norders, optimal and rectangular extraction, computation of the wavelength\nsolution, estimation of radial velocities, and rough and fast estimation of the\natmospheric parameters. Currently, CERES has been used to develop automated\npipelines for thirteen different spectrographs, namely CORALIE, FEROS, HARPS,\nESPaDOnS, FIES, PUCHEROS, FIDEOS, CAFE, DuPont/Echelle, Magellan/Mike,\nKeck/HIRES, Magellan/PFS and APO/ARCES, but the routines can be easily used in\norder to deal with data coming from other spectrographs. We show the high\nprecision in radial velocity that CERES achieves for some of these instruments\nand we briefly summarize some results that have already been obtained using the\nCERES pipelines.\n", "  PKS 1510-089 is one of the most variable blazars. Very high energy gamma ray\nemission from this source was observed by H.E.S.S. during March-April 2009 and\nby MAGIC from February 3 to April 3, 2012 quasi-simultaneously with\nmulti-wavelength flares. The spectral energy distributions of these flares have\nbeen modeled earlier with the external Compton mechanism which depends on our\nknowledge of the densities of the seed photons in the broad line region, the\ndusty infrared torus or a hypothetical slow sheath surrounding the jet around\nthe radio core. Here we show that to explain the multi-wavelength data with\nsynchrotron emission of electrons and protons the jet power should be of the\norder of 10^48 ergs/sec.\n", "  In principle, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model is\ncharacterised by a unique renormalisation-group-invariant (RGI) running\ninteraction and a unique form for the dressed--gluon-quark vertex,\n$\\Gamma_\\mu$; but, whilst much has been learnt about the former, the latter is\nstill obscure. In order to improve this situation, we use a RGI\nrunning-interaction that reconciles both top-down and bottom-up analyses of the\ngauge sector in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to compute dressed-quark gap\nequation solutions with 1,660,000 distinct Ansaetze for $\\Gamma_\\mu$. Each one\nof the solutions is then tested for compatibility with three physical criteria\nand, remarkably, we find that merely 0.55% of the solutions survive the test.\nPlainly, therefore, even a small selection of observables places extremely\ntight bounds on the domain of realistic vertex Ansaetze. This analysis and its\nresults should prove useful in constraining insightful contemporary studies of\nQCD and hadronic phenomena.\n", "  In this paper, a theoretical approach, comprising the non-equilibrium Green's\nfunction method for electronic transport and Landau-Khalatnikov equation for\nelectric polarization dynamics, is presented to describe polarization-dependent\ntunneling electroresistance (TER) in ferroelectric tunnel junctions. Using\nappropriate contact, interface, and ferroelectric parameters, measured\ncurrent-voltage characteristic curves in both inorganic\n(Co/BaTiO$_{3}$/La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$) and organic (Au/PVDF/W)\nferroelectric tunnel junctions can be well described by the proposed approach.\nFurthermore, under this theoretical framework, the controversy of opposite TER\nsigns observed experimentally by different groups in\nCo/BaTiO$_{3}$/La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ systems is addressed by\nconsidering the interface termination effects using the effective contact\nratio, defined through the effective screening length and dielectric response\nat the metal/ferroelectric interfaces. Finally, our approach is extended to\ninvestigate the role of a CoO$_{x}$ buffer layer at the Co/BaTiO$_{3}$\ninterface in a ferroelectric tunnel memristor. It is shown that, to have a\nsignificant memristor behavior, not only the interface oxygen vacancies but\nalso the CoO$_{x}$ layer thickness may vary with the applied bias.\n", "  We report the results of a comparative study of the magnetic microstructure\nof textured and isotropic\n$\\mathrm{Nd}_2\\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\\mathrm{B}/\\alpha$-$\\mathrm{Fe}$ nanocomposites\nusing magnetometry, transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron x-ray\ndiffraction, and, in particular, magnetic small-angle neutron scattering\n(SANS). Analysis of the magnetic neutron data of the textured specimen and\ncomputation of the correlation function of the spin misalignment SANS cross\nsection suggests the existence of inhomogeneously magnetized regions on an\nintraparticle nanometer length scale, about $40-50 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ in the\nremanent state. Possible origins for this spin disorder are discussed: it may\noriginate in thin grain-boundary layers (where the materials parameters are\ndifferent than in the $\\mathrm{Nd}_2\\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\\mathrm{B}$ grains), or it\nmay reflect the presence of crystal defects (introduced via hot pressing), or\nthe dispersion in the orientation distribution of the magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy axes of the $\\mathrm{Nd}_2\\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\\mathrm{B}$ grains. X-ray\npowder diffraction data reveal a crystallographic texture in the direction\nperpendicular to the pressing direction -- a finding which might be related to\nthe presence of a texture in the magnetization distribution, as inferred from\nthe magnetic SANS data.\n", "  Radial-velocity (RV) signals induce RV variations an order of magnitude\nlarger than the signal created by the orbit of Earth-twins, thus preventing\ntheir detection. The goal of this paper is to compare the efficiency of the\ndifferent methods used to deal with stellar signals to recover extremely\nlow-mass planets despite. However, because observed RV variations at the m/s\nprecision level or below is a combination of signals induced by unresolved\norbiting planets, by the star, and by the instrument, performing such a\ncomparison using real data is extremely challenging. To circumvent this\nproblem, we generated simulated RV measurements including realistic stellar and\nplanetary signals. Different teams analyzed blindly those simulated RV\nmeasurements, using their own method to recover planetary signals despite\nstellar RV signals. By comparing the results obtained by the different teams\nwith the planetary and stellar parameters used to generate the simulated RVs,\nit is therefore possible to compare the efficiency of these different methods.\nThe most efficient methods to recover planetary signals {take into account the\ndifferent activity indicators,} use red-noise models to account for stellar RV\nsignals and a Bayesian framework to provide model comparison in a robust\nstatistical approach. Using the most efficient methodology, planets can be\nfound down to K/N= K_pl/RV_rms*sqrt{N_obs}=5 with a threshold of K/N=7.5 at the\nlevel of 80-90% recovery rate found for a number of methods. These recovery\nrates drop dramatically for K/N smaller than this threshold. In addition, for\nthe best teams, no false positives with K/N > 7.5 were detected, while a\nnon-negligible fraction of them appear for smaller K/N. A limit of K/N = 7.5\nseems therefore a safe threshold to attest the veracity of planetary signals\nfor RV measurements with similar properties to those of the different RV\nfitting challenge systems.\n", "  We report on the fabrication, transport measurements, and density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations of atomic size contacts made out of gadolinium (Gd).\nGd is known to have local moments mainly associated with $f$ electrons. These\ncoexist with itinerant $s$ and $d$ bands that account for its metallic\ncharacter. Here we explore whether and how the local moments influence\nelectronic transport properties at the atomic scale. Using both Scanning\nTunneling Microscope (STM) and lithographic Mechanically Controllable Break\nJunction (MCBJ) techniques under cryogenic conditions, we study the conductance\nof Gd when only few atoms form the junction between bulk electrodes made out of\nthe very same material. Thousands of measurements shows that Gd has an average\nlowest conductance, attributed to an atom-size contact, below $\\frac{2e^2}{h}$.\nOur DFT calculations for monostrand chains anticipate that the $f$ bands are\nfully spin polarized and insulating, and that the conduction may be dominated\nby $s$, $p$, and $d$ bands. DFT quantum transport calculations quantitatively\nreproduce the experimental results for zero bias and reveal that, while $s-p$\nbands are dominant for transport, $d$ orbitals seem to have a relevant\ncontribution in some cases.\n", "  Acoustic metamaterials have exhibited extraordinary possibilities to\nmanipulate the propagation of the sound wave. Up to now, it is still a\nchallenge to control the propagation of the sound wave in an arbitrary pathway\nof a network. Here, we design a symmetry breaking cross-shape metamaterial\ncomprised of Helmholtz resonant cells and a square column. The square column is\neccentrically arranged. The sound wave can quasi-lossless transmit through\nchannels along the eccentric direction with compressed spaces, which breaks\nthrough the general transmission phenomenon. This exotic propagation\ncharacteristic is verified by the band structure and the mode of the\nmetamaterial. Two acoustic networks, including a 2x2 network and an 8x8\nnetwork, show that the sound wave can quasi-lossless propagate along various\narbitrary pathways, such as the Great Wall shape, the stair step shape and the\nserpentine shape, by reconfiguring eccentric directions. This ability opens up\na new venue to route the sound wave and exhibits promising applications, from\nthe acoustic communication to the energy transmission.\n", "  We analyze near-infrared UKIDSS observations of a sample of 8325 objects\ntaken from a catalog of intrinsically red sources in the Galactic plane\nselected in the Spitzer-GLIMPSE survey. Given the differences in angular\nresolution (factor >2 better in UKIDSS), our aim is to investigate whether\nthere are multiple UKIDSS sources that might all contribute to the GLIMPSE\nflux, or there is only one dominant UKIDSS counterpart. We then study possible\ncorrections to estimates of the SFR based on counts of GLIMPSE young stellar\nobjects (YSOs). This represents an exploratory work towards the construction of\na hierarchical YSO catalog. After performing PSF fitting photometry in the\nUKIDSS data, we implemented a technique to automatically recognize the dominant\nUKIDSS sources by evaluating their match with the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of the associated GLIMPSE red sources. This is a generic method which\ncould be robustly applied for matching SEDs across gaps at other wavelengths.\nWe found that most (87.0% +- 1.6%) of the candidate YSOs from the GLIMPSE red\nsource catalog have only one dominant UKIDSS counterpart which matches the\nmid-infrared SED (fainter associated UKIDSS sources might still be present).\nThough at first sight this could seem surprising, given that YSOs are typically\nin clustered environments, we argue that within the mass range covered by the\nGLIMPSE YSO candidates (intermediate to high masses), clustering with objects\nwith comparable mass is unlikely at the GLIMPSE resolution. Indeed, by\nperforming simple clustering experiments based on a population synthesis model\nof Galactic YSOs, we found that although ~60% of the GLIMPSE YSO enclose at\nleast two UKIDSS sources, in general only one dominates the flux. No\nsignificant corrections are needed for estimates of the SFR of the Milky Way\nbased on the assumption that the GLIMPSE YSOs are individual objects.\n(Abridged)\n", "  Precise measurements of eclipsing binary parameters and statistical studies\nof young clusters have suggested that some magnetically active low-mass dwarfs\npossess radii inflated by $\\sim$5-15% relative to theoretical expectations. If\ntrue, this effect should be pronounced in young open clusters, due to the rapid\nrotation and strong magnetic activity of their most extreme members. We explore\nthis possibility by determining empirical radii for 83 members of the nearby\nPleiades open cluster, using spectral energy distribution fitting to establish\n$\\mathcal{F}_{bol}$ with a typical accuracy of $\\approx$3\\% together with color\nand spectro-photometric indices to determine $T_{\\rm eff}$. We find several\nPleiades members with radii inflated above radius-$T_{\\rm eff}$ models from\nstate-of-the-art calculations, and apparent dispersions in radii for the\nK-dwarfs of the cluster. Moreover, we demonstrate that this putative radius\ninflation correlates strongly with rotation rate, consistent with inflation of\nyoung stars by magnetic activity and/or starspots. We argue that this signal is\nnot a consequence of starspot-induced color anomalies, binarity, or depth\neffects in the cluster, employing Gaia DR1 distances as a check. Finally, we\nconsider the lithium abundances of these stars, demonstrating a triple\ncorrelation between rotation rate, radius inflation, and enhanced lithium\nabundance. Our result---already significant to $\\sim$99.99%\nconfidence---provides strong support for a magnetic origin of the inflated\nradii and lithium dispersion observed in young, low-mass stars.\n", "  We present the recent results of strangeness production at the mid-rapidity\nin Au + Au collisions at RHIC, from $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV. The\n$v_2$ of multi-strange baryon $\\Omega$ and $\\phi$ mesons are similar to that of\npions and protons in the intermediate $p_T$ range (2 - 5 GeV/$c$) in\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au + Au collisions, indicating that the major\npart of collective flow has been built up at partonic stage. The breaking of\nmass ordering between $\\phi$ mesons and protons in the low $p_T$ range ($<$ 1\nGeV/$c$) is consistent with a picture that $\\phi$ mesons are less sensitive to\nlater hadronic interaction. The nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm CP}$ and\nbaryon to meson ratio change dramatically when the collision energy is lower\nthan 19.6 GeV. It suggests a possible change of medium property of the system\ncompared to those from high energies.\n", "  This paper continues our study of the foreground population to the Orion\nmolecular clouds. The goal is to characterize the foreground population north\nof NGC 1981 and to investigate the star formation history in the large Orion\nstar-forming region. We focus on a region covering about 25 square degrees,\ncentered on the $\\epsilon$ Orionis supergiant (HD 37128, B0\\,Ia) and covering\nthe Orion Belt asterism.\n  We used a combination of optical (SDSS) and near-infrared (2MASS) data,\ninformed by X-ray (\\textit{XMM-Newton}) and mid-infrared (WISE) data, to\nconstruct a suite of color-color and color-magnitude diagrams for all available\nsources. We then applied a new statistical multiband technique to isolate a\npreviously unknown stellar population in this region.\n  We identify a rich and well-defined stellar population in the surveyed region\nthat has about 2\\,000 objects that are mostly M stars. We infer the age for\nthis new population to be at least 5\\, Myr and likely $\\sim10$\\,Myr and\nestimate a total of about 2\\,500 members, assuming a normal IMF. This new\npopulation, which we call the Orion Belt population, is essentially\nextinction-free, disk-free, and its spatial distribution is roughly centered\nnear $\\epsilon$ Ori, although substructure is clearly present.\n  The Orion Belt population is likely the low-mass counterpart to the Ori OB Ib\nsubgroup. Although our results do not rule out Blaauw's sequential star\nformation scenario for Orion, we argue that the recently proposed blue streams\nscenario provides a better framework on which one can explain the Orion star\nformation region as a whole. We speculate that the Orion Belt population could\nrepresent the evolved counterpart of an Orion nebula-like cluster.\n", "  A model of spin-3/2 vector-like leptons is introduced, which serve as an\nalternative probe of possible lepton compositeness. Possible signatures at the\nLarge Hadron Collider are explored, and current data are used to constrain the\nmasses of the hypothetical new leptons.\n", "  The gauging of the lepton flavour group is considered in the Standard Model\ncontext and in its extension with three right-handed neutrinos. The anomaly\ncancellation conditions lead to a Seesaw mechanism as underlying dynamics for\nall leptons; requiring in addition a phenomenologically viable setup leads to\nMajorana masses for the neutral sector: the type I Seesaw Lagrangian in the\nStandard Model case and the inverse Seesaw in the extended model. Within the\nminimal extension of the scalar sector, the Yukawa couplings are promoted to\nscalar fields in the bifundamental of the flavour group. The resulting\nlow-energy Yukawa couplings are proportional to inverse powers of the vacuum\nexpectation values of those scalars; the protection against flavour changing\nneutral currents differs from that of Minimal Flavor Violation. In all cases,\nthe $\\mu-\\tau$ flavour sector exhibits rich and promising phenomenological\nsignals.\n", "  Dielectric metasurfaces require high refractive index contrast materials for\noptimum performance. This requirement imposes a severe restraint; devices have\neither been demonstrated at wavelengths of 700nm and above using high-index\nsemiconductors such as silicon, or they use lower index dielectric materials\nsuch as TiO$_{2}$ or Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and operate in the visible wavelength\nregime. Here, we show that the high refractive index of silicon can be\nexploited at wavelengths as short as 532 nm by demonstrating a silicon\nmetasurface with a transmission efficiency of 47% at this wavelength. The\nmetasurface consists of a graded array of silicon posts arranged in a square\nlattice on a quartz substrate. We show full 2{\\pi} phase control and we\nexperimentally demonstrate polarization-independent beam deflection at 532nm\nwavelength. The crystalline silicon is placed on a quartz substrate by a\nbespoke layer transfer technique and we note that an efficiency >70% may be\nachieved for a further optimized structure in the same material. Our results\nopen a new way for realizing efficient metasurfaces based on silicon in the\nvisible wavelength regime.\n", "  Context: Quantifying the gas content inside the dust gaps of transition disks\nis important to establish their origin. Aims: We seek to constrain the surface\ndensity of warm gas in the disk of HD 139614, a Herbig Ae star with a\ntransition disk exhibiting a dust gap from 2.3 to 6 AU. Methods: We have\nobtained ESO/VLT CRIRES high-resolution spectra of CO ro-vibrational emission.\nWe derived constraints on the disk's structure by modeling the line-profiles,\nthe spectroastrometric signal, and the rotational diagrams using flat Keplerian\ndisk models. Results: We detected v=1-0 12CO, 2-1 12CO, 1-0 13CO, 1-0 C18O, and\n1-0 C17O ro-vibrational lines. 12CO v=1-0 lines have an average width of 14\nkm/s, Tgas of 450 K and an emitting region from 1 to 15 AU. 13CO and C18O lines\nare on average 70 and 100 K colder, 1 and 4 km/s narrower, and are dominated by\nemission at R>6 AU. The 12CO v=1-0 line-profile indicates that if there is a\ngap in the gas it must be narrower than 2 AU. We find that a drop in the gas\nsurface density (delta_gas) at R<5-6 AU is required to simultaneously reproduce\nthe line-profiles and rotational diagrams of the three CO isotopologs.\nDelta_gas can range from 10^-2 to 10^-4 depending on the gas-to-dust ratio of\nthe outer disk. We find that at 1<R<6 AU the gas surface density profile is\nflat or increases with radius. We derive a gas column density at 1<R<6 AU of\nNH=3x10^19 - 10^21 cm^-2. We find a 5sigma upper limit on NCO at R<1 AU of\n5x10^15 cm^-2 (NH<5x10^19 cm^-2). Conclusions: The dust gap in the disk of HD\n139614 has gas. The gas surface density in the disk at R<6 AU is significantly\nlower than the surface density expected from HD 139614's accretion rate\nassuming a viscous alpha-disk model. The gas density drop, the non-negative\ndensity gradient of the gas inside 6 AU, and the absence of a wide (>2 AU) gas\ngap suggest the presence of an embedded <2 MJ planet at around 4 AU.\n", "  We present new Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope\nobservations of eight optically selected broad-line AGN candidates in nearby\ndwarf galaxies ($z<0.055$). Including archival Chandra observations of three\nadditional sources, our sample contains all ten galaxies from Reines et al.\n(2013) with both broad H$\\alpha$ emission and narrow-line AGN ratios (6 AGNs, 4\nComposites), as well as one low-metallicity dwarf galaxy with broad H$\\alpha$\nand narrow-line ratios characteristic of star formation. All eleven galaxies\nare detected in X-rays. Nuclear X-ray luminosities range from $L_{0.5-7\n\\rm{keV}}\\approx5\\times10^{39}$ to $1\\times10^{42}$ $\\rm{erg}\\rm{s^{-1}}$. In\nall cases except for the star forming galaxy, the nuclear X-ray luminosities\nare significantly higher than would be expected from X-ray binaries, providing\nstrong confirmation that AGN and composite dwarf galaxies do indeed host\nactively accreting BHs. Using our estimated BH masses (which range from\n$\\sim7\\times10^{4}-1\\times10^{6}~M_{\\odot}$), we find inferred Eddington\nfractions ranging from $\\sim0.1-50\\%$, i.e. comparable to massive broad-line\nquasars at higher redshift. We use the HST imaging to determine the ratio of\nultraviolet to X-ray emission for these AGN, finding that they appear to be\nless X-ray luminous with respect to their UV emission than more massive quasars\n(i.e. $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$ values an average of 0.36 lower than expected based on\nthe relation between $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$ and $2500{\\rm \\AA}$ luminosity).\nFinally, we discuss our results in the context of different accretion models\nonto nuclear BHs.\n", "  Despite the success of modern nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs)\nin describing nuclear hard-process data, they still suffer from large\nuncertainties. One of the poorly constrained features is the possible asymmetry\nin nuclear modifications of valence $u$ and $d$ quarks. We study the\npossibility of using pion-nucleus Drell-Yan dilepton data as a new constraint\nin the global analysis of nPDFs. We find that the nuclear cross-section ratios\nfrom the NA3, NA10 and E615 experiments can be used without imposing\nsignificant new theoretical uncertainties and, in particular, that these\ndatasets may have some constraining power on the $u$/$d$ -asymmetry in nuclei.\n", "  Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in the 1-100 meter size range are estimated to be\n$\\sim$1,000 times more numerous than the $\\sim$15,000 currently-catalogued\nNEAs, most of which are in the 0.5-10 kilometer size range. Impacts from 10-100\nmeter size NEAs are not statistically life-threatening but may cause\nsignificant regional damage, while 1-10 meter size NEAs with low velocities\nrelative to Earth are compelling targets for space missions. We describe the\nimplementation and initial results of a real-time NEA-discovery system\nspecialized for the detection of small, high angular rate (visually-streaked)\nNEAs in Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) images. PTF is a 1.2-m aperture,\n7.3-deg$^2$ field-of-view optical survey designed primarily for the discovery\nof extragalactic transients (e.g., supernovae) in 60-second exposures reaching\n$\\sim$20.5 visual magnitude. Our real-time NEA discovery pipeline uses a\nmachine-learned classifier to filter a large number of false-positive streak\ndetections, permitting a human scanner to efficiently and remotely identify\nreal asteroid streaks during the night. Upon recognition of a streaked NEA\ndetection (typically within an hour of the discovery exposure), the scanner\ntriggers follow-up with the same telescope and posts the observations to the\nMinor Planet Center for worldwide confirmation. We describe our ten initial\nconfirmed discoveries, all small NEAs that passed 0.3-15 lunar distances from\nEarth. Lastly, we derive useful scaling laws for comparing\nstreaked-NEA-detection capabilities of different surveys as a function of their\nhardware and survey-pattern characteristics. This work most directly informs\nestimates of the streak-detection capabilities of the Zwicky Transient Facility\n(ZTF, planned to succeed PTF in 2017), which will apply PTF's current\nresolution and sensitivity over a 47-deg$^2$ field-of-view.\n", "  The G14.225-0.506 infrared dark cloud (IRDC G14.2) displays a remarkable\ncomplex of parallel dense molecular filaments projected on the plane of the\nsky. Previous dust emission and molecular-line studies have speculated whether\nmagnetic fields could have played an important role in the formation of such\nlong-shaped structures, which are hosts to numerous young stellar sources. In\nthis work we have conducted a vast polarimetric survey at optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths in order to study the morphology of magnetic field\nlines in IRDC G14.2 through the observation of background stars. The\norientation of interstellar polarization, which traces magnetic field lines, is\nperpendicular to most of the filamentary features within the cloud.\nAdditionally, the larger-scale molecular cloud as a whole exhibits an elongated\nshape also perpendicular to magnetic fields. Estimates of magnetic field\nstrengths indicate values in the range $320 - 550\\,\\mu$G, which allows\nsub-alfv\\'enic conditions, but does not prevent the gravitational collapse of\nhub-filament structures, which in general are close to the critical state.\nThese characteristics suggest that magnetic fields played the main role in\nregulating the collapse from large to small scales, leading to the formation of\nseries of parallel elongated structures. The morphology is also consistent with\nnumerical simulations that show how gravitational instabilities develop under\nstrong magnetic fields. Finally, the results corroborate the hypothesis that a\nstrong support from internal magnetic fields might explain why the cloud seems\nto be contracting on a time scale 2-3 times larger than what is expected from a\nfree-fall collapse.\n", "  A direct search of $\\gamma$-ray emission centered on multi-frequency selected\ncandidates is a valuable complementary approach to the standard search adopted\nin current $\\gamma$-ray Fermi-LAT catalogs. Our candidates are part of the\n2WHSP sample, that was assembled with the aim of providing targets for Imaging\nAtmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT), and is currently the largest set of\nhigh synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazars. We perform a likelihood analysis with\nthe Fermi Science Tools using positions from 400 2WHSP blazars as seeds of\ntentative $\\gamma$-ray sources. This enabled us to detect 150 $\\gamma$-ray\nexcess signals that have not yet been reported in previous $\\gamma$-ray\ncatalogs (1FGL, 2FGL, and 3FGL). By identifying new sources, we solve a\nfraction of the extragalactic isotropic $\\gamma$-ray background (IGRB)\ncomposition, improving the description of the $\\gamma$-ray sky. Our analysis\nconsiders the 0.3-500 GeV energy band, integrating over 7.2 yrs of Fermi-LAT\nobservation and making use of the Pass 8 data release. Within the 150 2WHSPs\nthat showed excess $\\gamma$-ray signature: 85 are high-significance detections\nwith test statistic (TS)$>$25, and 65 are lower-significance detections with TS\nbetween 10 to 25. We study the $\\gamma$-ray photon spectral index distribution,\nthe likelihood of detection according to the synchrotron peak brightness, and\nplot the measured $\\gamma$-ray LogN-LogS of HSP blazars, also discussing the\nportion of the IGRB that has been resolved by this work. We report on four\ncases where we could resolve source confusion and find counterparts for\nunassociated 3FGL sources with the help of high-energy TS maps together with\nmulti-frequency data. The 150 new $\\gamma$-ray sources are named with the\nacronym 1BIGB for the first version of the Brazil ICRANet Gamma-ray Blazar\ncatalog, in reference to the cooperation agreement supporting this work.\n", "  Acoustic wave devices provide a promising chip-scale platform for efficiently\ncoupling radio frequency (RF) and optical fields. Here, we use an integrated\npiezo-optomechanical circuit platform that exploits both the piezoelectric and\nphotoelastic coupling mechanisms to link 2.4 GHz RF waves to 194 THz (1550 nm)\noptical waves, through coupling to propagating and localized 2.4 GHz acoustic\nwaves. We demonstrate acousto-optic modulation, resonant in both the optical\nand mechanical domains, in which waveforms encoded on the RF carrier are mapped\nto the optical field. We also show opto-acoustic modulation, in which the\napplication of optical pulses gates the transmission of propagating acoustic\nwaves. The time-domain characteristics of this system under both pulsed RF and\npulsed optical excitation are considered in the context of the different\nphysical pathways involved in driving the acoustic waves, and modeled through\nthe coupled mode equations of cavity optomechanics.\n", "  Collective phenomena emerging from non-linear interactions between multiple\noscillators, such as synchronization and frequency locking, find applications\nin a wide variety of fields. Optomechanical resonators, which are intrinsically\nnon-linear, combine the scientific assets of mechanical devices with the\npossibility of long distance controlled interactions enabled by travelling\nlight. Here we demonstrate light-mediated frequency locking of three distant\nnano-optomechanical oscillators positioned in a cascaded configuration. The\noscillators, integrated on a chip along a coupling waveguide, are optically\ndriven with a single laser and oscillate at gigahertz frequency. Despite an\ninitial frequency disorder of hundreds of kilohertz, the guided light locks\nthem all with a clear transition in the optical output. The experimental\nresults are described by Langevin equations, paving the way to scalable\ncascaded optomechanical configurations.\n", "  Emergence of collective dynamical chirality (CDC) at mesoscopic scales plays\na key role in many formation processes of chiral structures in nature, which\nmay also provide possible routines for people to fabricate complex chiral\narchitectures. So far, most of reported CDCs are found in systems of active\nobjects with individual structure chirality or/and dynamical chirality, and\nwhether CDC can arise from simple and achiral units is still an attractive\nmystery. Here, we report a spontaneous formation of CDC in a system of both\ndynamically and structurally achiral particles motivated by active motion of\ncells. Active moving, confinement and hydrodynamic interaction are found to be\nthe three key factors. Detailed analysis shows that the system can support\nabundant collective dynamical behaviors, including rotating droplet, rotating\nbubble, CDC oscillation, array of collective rotation, as well as interesting\ntransitions such as chirality transition, structure transition and state\nreentrance.\n", "  We show how to compute the magnetooptical functions (absorption, reflection,\nand transmission) when Rydberg Exciton-Polaritons appear, including the effect\nof the coherence between the electron-hole pair and the electromagnetic field,\nand the polaritonic effect. Using the Real Density Matrix Approach the\nanalytical expressions for magnetooptical functions are obtained and numerical\ncalculations for Cu$_2$0 crystal are performed. The influence of the strength\nof applied external magnetic field on the resonance displacement of excitonic\nspectra is discussed. We report a good agreement with recently published\nexperimental data.\n", "  We study the photoionization properties of the C_60 versus C_240 molecule in\na spherical jellium frame of density functional method. Two different\napproximations to the exchange-correlation (xc) functional are used: (i) The\nGunnerson-Lundqvist parametrization [Phys. Rev. B 13, 4274 (1976)] with an\nexplicit correction for the electron self-interaction (SIC) and (ii) a\ngradient-dependent augmentation of (i) by using the van Leeuwen and Baerends\nmodel potential [Phys. Rev. A 49, 2421 (1994)], in lieu of SIC, to implicitly\nrestore electrons' asymptotic properties. Ground state results from the two\nschemes for both molecules show differences in the shapes of mean-field\npotentials and bound-level properties. The choice of a xc scheme also\nsignificantly alters the dipole single-photoionization cross sections obtained\nby an abinitio method that incorporates linear-response dynamical correlations.\nDifferences in the structures and ionization responses between C_60 and C_240\nuncover the effect of molecular size on the underlying physics. Analysis\nindicates that the collective plasmon resonances with the gradient-based\nxc-option produce results noticeably closer to the experimental data available\nfor C_60.\n", "  Gamma-ray bursts are the most energetic explosions in the Universe. They are\ndetectable up to very high redshifts, therefore can be used to study the\nexpansion rate of the Universe and to investigate the observational properties\nof dark energy, provided that empirical correlations between spectral and\nintensity properties are appropriately calibrated. We used the type Ia\nsupernova luminosity distances to calibrate the correlation between the peak\nphoton energy, $E_{p, i}$, and the isotropic equivalent radiated energy, $\nE_{iso}$ in GRBs. With this correlation, we tested the reliability of applying\nGRBs to measure cosmological parameters and to obtain indications on the basic\nproperties and evolution of dark energy. Using 162 GRBs with measured redshifts\nand spectra, we applied a local regression technique to calibrate the $E_{p,\ni}$-$E_{iso}$ correlation against the type Ia SN data to build a calibrated GRB\nHubble diagram. We tested the possible redshift dependence of the correlation\nand its effect on the Hubble diagram. Finally, we used the GRB Hubble diagram\nto investigate the dark energy EOS. For this, we focused on the so-called\nChevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy EOS and\nimplemented the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to efficiently sample\nthe space of cosmological parameters. Our analysis shows once more that the\n$E_{p, i}$-$E_{iso}$ correlation has no significant redshift dependence.\nTherefore the high-redshift GRBs can be used as a cosmological tool to\ndetermine the basic cosmological parameters and to test different models of\ndark energy in the redshift region ($z\\geqslant 3$), which is unexplored by the\nSNIa and baryonic acoustic oscillations data. Our updated calibrated Hubble\ndiagram of GRBs provides some marginal indication (at $1\\sigma$ level) of an\nevolving dark energy EOS.\n", "  Purpose: The purpose of the work was experimental investigations of the\nbreast dose distributions with adaptive filtration. Adaptive filtration reduces\ndetector dynamic range and improves image quality. The adaptive filter with\npredetermined shape is placed at the x-ray beam such that the x-ray intensity\nat the detector surface is flat. However, adaptive filter alters the mean dose\nto the breast, as well as volume distribution of the dose. Methods: The dose\nwas measured using a 14 cm diameter cylindrical acrylic breast phantom. An\nacrylic adaptive filter was fabricated to match the 14 cm diameter of the\nphantom. The dose was measured using ion chamber inserted into holes\ndistributed along the radius of the phantom from the center to the edge. The\nradial distribution of dose was measured and fitted by an analytical function\nand the volume distribution and mean value of dose was calculated. The\nmeasurements were performed at 40, 60, 90, and 120 kVp tube voltages and 6.6\nmGy air kerma. Results: The adaptive filter decreased mean breast dose by a\nfactor of 1.6-2.2 depending on the tube voltage. To maintain image quality, the\ntube output was increased by these factors when adaptive filter was used. The\nadaptive filter provided uniform volume distribution of dose at 40 kVp and 60\nkVp tube voltages, but the distribution was non-uniform at 90 kVp and 120 kVp\ntube voltages. Conclusion: While adaptive filtration helps with detector\ndynamic range, CT number uniformity, and CT noise uniformity, the volume\nnon-uniformity of the dose with adaptive filter depends on tube voltage. On the\nother hand, at the same average breast dose, volume non-uniformity of the dose\nwith adaptive filter was not higher that that without adaptive filter. The\nresults allowed also to determine necessary dose increase factor to compensate\nfor x-ray absorption in the adaptive filter.\n", "  The properties of the multisoliton solutions of the (2+1)-dimensional\nMaxwell-Chern-Simons-Skyrme model are investigated numerically. Coupling to the\nChern-Simons term allows for existence of the electrically charge solitons\nwhich may also carry magnetic fluxes. Two particular choices of the potential\nterm is considered: (i) the weakly bounded potential and (ii) the double vacuum\npotential. In the absence of the gauge interaction in the former case the\nindividual constituents of the multisoliton configuration are well separated,\nwhile in the latter case the rotational invariance of the configuration remains\nunbroken. It is shown that coupling of the planar multi-Skyrmions to the\nelectric and magnetic field strongly affects the pattern of interaction between\nthe constituents. We analyze the dependency of the structure of the solutions,\nthe energies, angular momenta, electric and magnetic fields of the\nconfigurations on the gauge coupling constant $g$, and the electric potential.\nIt is found that, generically, the coupling to the Chern-Simons term strongly\naffects the usual pattern of interaction between the skyrmions, in particular\nthe electric repulsion between the solitons may break the multisoliton\nconfiguration into partons. We show that as the gauge coupling becomes strong,\nboth the magnetic flux and the electric charge of the solutions become\nquantized although they are not topological numbers.\n", "  The correlated-k method is frequently used to speed up radiation calculations\nin both one-dimensional and three-dimensional atmosphere models. An inherent\ndifficulty with this method is how to treat overlapping absorption, i.e.\nabsorption by more than one gas in a given spectral region. We have evaluated\nthe applicability of three different methods in hot Jupiter and brown dwarf\natmosphere models, all of which have been previously applied within models in\nthe literature: (i) Random overlap, both with and without resorting and\nrebinning, (ii) equivalent extinction and (iii) pre-mixing of opacities, where\n(i) and (ii) combine k-coefficients for different gases to obtain\nk-coefficients for a mixture of gases, while (iii) calculates k-coefficients\nfor a given mixture from the corresponding mixed line-by-line opacities. We\nfind that the random overlap method is the most accurate and flexible of these\ntreatments, and is fast enough to be used in one-dimensional models with\nresorting and rebinning. In three-dimensional models such as GCMs it is too\nslow, however, and equivalent extinction can provide a speed-up of at least a\nfactor of three with only a minor loss of accuracy while at the same time\nretaining the flexibility gained by combining k-coefficients computed for each\ngas individually. Pre-mixed opacities are significantly less flexible, and we\nalso find that particular care must be taken when using this method in order to\nto adequately resolve steep variations in composition at important chemical\nequilibrium boundaries. We use the random overlap method with resorting and\nrebinning in our one-dimensional atmosphere model and equivalent extinction in\nour GCM, which allows us to e.g. consistently treat the feedback of\nnon-equilibrium chemistry on the total opacity and therefore the calculated P-T\nprofiles in our models.\n", "  During primary transits, the spectral signatures of an exoplanet atmosphere\ncan be measured using transmission spectroscopy. The goal of this work is to\naccurately measure the atomspheric sodium absorption light curve in HD189733b,\ncorrecting for the effects of stellar differential limb-darkening, stellar\nactivity and a \"bump\" caused by the changing radial velocity of the exoplanet.\nIn fact, due to the high cadence and quality of our data, it is the first time\nthat the last feature can be detected even by visual inspection. We use 244\nhigh-resolution optical spectra taken by the UVES instrument mounted at the\nVLT. Our observations cover a full transit of HD 189733b, with a cadence of 45\nseconds. To probe the transmission spectrum of sodium we produce excess light-\ncurves integrating the stellar flux in passbands of 1 \\AA, 1.5 \\AA, and 3 \\AA\ninside the core of each sodium D-line. We model the effects of external sources\non the excess light-curves, which correspond to an observed stellar flare\nbeginning close to mid-transit time and the wavelength dependent limb-darkening\neffects. In addition, by characterizing the effect of the changing radial\nvelocity and Doppler shifts of the planetary sodium lines inside the stellar\nsodium lines, we estimate the depth and width of the exoplanetary sodium\nfeature. We estimate the shape of the planetary sodium line by a Gaussian\nprofile, with an equivalent width of 0.0023 \\pm 0.0010 \\AA, thereby confirming\nthe presence of sodium in the atmosphere of HD189733b with excess absorption\nlevels of 0.72 \\pm 0.25%, 0.34 \\pm 0.11%, and 0.20 \\pm 0.06% for the\nintegration bands of 1 \\AA, 1.5 \\AA, and 3 \\AA, respectively. From these, we\nproduce a first order estimate of the number density of sodium in the exoplanet\natmosphere.\n", "  We present the detection of persistent soft X-ray radiation with L_x ~\n10^41-10^42 erg/s at the location of the extremely luminous, double-humped\ntransient ASASSN-15lh as revealed by Chandra and Swift. We interpret this\nfinding in the context of observations from our multiwavelength campaign, which\nrevealed the presence of weak narrow nebular emission features from the\nhost-galaxy nucleus and clear differences with respect to superluminous\nsupernova optical spectra. Significant UV flux variability on short time-scales\ndetected at the time of the re-brightening disfavors the shock interaction\nscenario as the source of energy powering the long-lived UV emission, while\ndeep radio limits exclude the presence of relativistic jets propagating into a\nlow-density environment. We propose a model where the extreme luminosity and\ndouble-peaked temporal structure of ASASSN-15lh is powered by a central source\nof ionizing radiation that produces a sudden change of the ejecta opacity at\nlater times. As a result, UV radiation can more easily escape, producing the\nsecond bump in the light-curve. We discuss different interpretations for the\nintrinsic nature of the ionizing source. We conclude that, IF the X-ray source\nis physically associated with the optical-UV transient, ASASSN-15lh most likely\nrepresents the tidal disruption of a main-sequence star by the most massive\nspinning black hole detected to date. In this case, ASASSN-15lh and similar\nevents discovered in the future would constitute the most direct probes of very\nmassive, dormant, spinning, supermassive black holes in galaxies. Future\nmonitoring of the X-rays may allow us to distinguish between the supernova and\nTDE hypothesis.\n", "  We present the results of ALMA spectroscopic follow-up of a $z=6.765$\nLyman-$\\alpha$ emitting galaxy behind the cluster RXJ1347-1145. We report the\ndetection of [CII]158$\\mu$m line fully consistent with the Lyman-$\\alpha$\nredshift and with the peak of the optical emission. Given the magnification of\n$\\mu=5.0 \\pm 0.3$ the intrinsic (corrected for lensing) luminosity of the [CII]\nline is $L_{[CII]} =1.4^{+0.2}_{-0.3} \\times 10^7L_{\\odot}$, which is ${\\sim}5$\ntimes fainter than other detections of $z\\sim 7$ galaxies. The result indicates\nthat low $L_{[CII]}$ in $z\\sim 7$ galaxies compared to the local counterparts\nmight be caused by their low metallicities and/or feedback. The small velocity\noff-set ($\\Delta v = 20_{-40}^{+140} \\rm km/s$) between the Lyman-$\\alpha$ and\n[CII] line is unusual, and may be indicative of ionizing photons escaping.\n", "  We show that the interaction between spin-polarized current and magnetization\ndynamics can be used to implement black-hole and white-hole horizons for\nmagnons - the quanta of oscillations in the magnetization direction in magnets.\nWe consider three different systems: easy-plane ferromagnetic metals, isotropic\nantiferromagnetic metals, and easy-plane magnetic insulators. Based on\navailable experimental data, we estimate that the Hawking temperature can be as\nlarge as 1 K. We comment on the implications of magnonic horizons for spin-wave\nscattering and transport experiments, and for magnon entanglement.\n", "  We augment the chiral Lagrangian by an isosinglet scalar and compute the\none-loop radiative corrections to the pion mass and decay constant, as well as\nthe scalar mass. The calculations are carried out for different patterns of\nchiral symmetry breaking of immediate relevance for phenomenology and lattice\ninvestigations. By construction our results encompass several interesting\nlimits, ranging from the dilaton to the linear sigma model.\n", "  We present a new open-source Python package for exact diagonalization and\nquantum dynamics of spin(-photon) chains, called QuSpin, supporting the use of\nvarious symmetries in 1-dimension and (imaginary) time evolution for chains up\nto 32 sites in length. The package is well-suited to study, among others,\nquantum quenches at finite and infinite times, the Eigenstate Thermalisation\nhypothesis, many-body localisation and other dynamical phase transitions,\nperiodically-driven (Floquet) systems, adiabatic and counter-diabatic ramps,\nand spin-photon interactions. Moreover, QuSpin's user-friendly interface can\neasily be used in combination with other Python packages which makes it\namenable to a high-level customisation. We explain how to use QuSpin using four\ndetailed examples: (i) Standard exact diagonalisation of XXZ chain (ii)\nadiabatic ramping of parameters in the many-body localised XXZ model, (iii)\nheating in the periodically-driven transverse-field Ising model in a parallel\nfield, and (iv) quantised light-atom interactions: recovering the\nperiodically-driven atom in the semi-classical limit of a static Hamiltonian.\n", "  We propose to use quantum coherence as ultimate proof of quantum nature in\nthe radiation that appears by means of the Dynamical Casimir Effect in\nexperiments with superconducting microwave waveguides. We show that, unlike\npreviously considered measurements of quantum correlations such as entanglement\nand discord, quantum coherence does not require a threshold value of the\nexternal pump amplitude and is highly robust to thermal noise.\n", "  We study two Brownian particles in dimension $d=1$, diffusing under an\ninteracting resetting mechanism to a fixed position. The particles are subject\nto a constant drift, which biases the Brownian particles toward each other. We\nderive the steady-state distributions and study the late time relaxation\nbehavior to the stationary state.\n", "  The on shell equivalence of first order and second order formalisms for the\nEinstein-Hilbert action does not hold for those actions quadratic in curvature.\nIt would seem that by considering the connection and the metric as independent\ndynamical variables, there are no quartic propagators for any dynamical\nvariable. This suggests that it is possible to get both renormalizability and\nunitarity along these lines. We have studied a particular instance of those\ntheories, namely Weyl gravity. Although the ground state of this system is\ndifficult to analyze, we have been able to study the physical effects of some\nexternal sources.\n", "  We here derive upper limits on the mass and luminosity of Population III\n(POPIII) dominated proto-galaxies based on the collapse of primordial gas under\nthe effect of angular momentum loss via Ly$\\alpha$ radiation drag and the gas\naccretion onto a galactic centre. Our model predicts that POPIII-dominated\ngalaxies at z ~ 7 are hosted by haloes with $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 1.5 \\times\n10^{8} - 1.1 \\times 10^{9} \\rm ~M_{\\odot}$, that they have Ly$\\alpha$\nluminosities of $L_{\\rm Ly\\alpha} \\sim 3.0 \\times 10^{42} - 2.1 \\times 10^{43}$\nerg/s, stellar mass of $M_{\\rm star} \\sim 0.8 \\times 10^{5} - 2.5 \\times 10^{6}\n\\rm ~M_{\\odot}$, and outflowing gas with velocities $V_{\\rm out} \\sim 40$ km/s\ndue to Ly$\\alpha$ radiation pressure. We show that the POPIII galaxy candidate\nCR7 violates the derived limits on stellar mass and Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity and\nthus is unlikely to be a POPIII galaxy. POPIII-dominated galaxies at z ~ 7 have\nHeII line emission that is ~1- 3 orders of magnitude lower then that of\nLy$\\alpha$, they have high Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent width of > 300 $\\AA$ and\nshould be found close to bright star forming galaxies. The HeII 1640 $\\AA$ line\nis in comfortable reach of next generation telescopes, like the JWST or TMT.\n", "  We revisit the theory of the collective neutral excitation mode in the\nfractional quantum Hall effect at Landau level filling fractions $\\nu=1/3$ and\n$\\nu=7/3$. We include the effect of finite thickness of the two-dimensional\nelectron gas and use extensive exact diagonalizations in the torus geometry. In\nthe lowest Landau level the collective gapped mode i.e. the magnetoroton always\nmerges in the continuum in the long-wavelength limit. In the second Landau\nlevel the mode is well-defined only for wavevectors smaller than a critical\nvalue and disappears in the continuum beyond this point. Its curvature near\nzero momentum is opposite to that of the LLL. It is well separated from the\ncontinuum even at zero momentum and the gap of the continuum of higher-lying\nstates is twice the collective mode gap at $k=0$. The shape of the dispersion\nrelation survives a perturbative treatment of Landau level mixing.\n", "  We present a new technique to create a bin-averaged Hubble Diagram (HD) from\nphotometrically identified SN~Ia data. The resulting HD is corrected for\nselection biases and contamination from core collapse (CC) SNe, and can be used\nto infer cosmological parameters. This method, called \"BBC\" (BEAMS with Bias\nCorrections), includes two fitting stages. The first BBC fitting stage uses a\nposterior distribution that includes multiple SN likelihoods, a Monte Carlo\nsimulation to bias-correct the fitted SALT-II parameters, and CC probabilities\ndetermined from a machine learning technique. The BBC fit determines 1) a\nbin-averaged HD (average distance vs. redshift), and 2) the nuisance parameters\nalpha and beta, which multiply the stretch and color (respectively) to\nstandardize the SN brightness. In the second stage, the bin-averaged HD is fit\nto a cosmological model where priors can be imposed. We perform high precision\ntests of the BBC method by simulating large (150,000 event) data samples\ncorresponding to the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program. Our tests include\nthree models of intrinsic scatter, each with two different CC rates. In the BBC\nfit, the SALT-II nuisance parameters alpha and beta are recovered to within 1%\nof their true values. In the cosmology fit, we determine the dark energy\nequation of state parameter w using a fixed value of Omega_matter as a prior:\naveraging over all six tests based on 6 x 150,000 = 900,000 SNe, there is a\nsmall w-bias of 0.006 +- 0.002. Finally, the BBC fitting code is publicly\navailable in the SNANA package.\n", "  We study the relation between the continuum threshold as function of the\ntemperature $s_0(T)$ within finite energy sum rules and the trace of the\nPolyakov loop $\\Phi$ in the framework of a nonlocal SU(2) chiral quark model,\nestablishing a contact between both deconfinement order parameters at finite\ntemperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. In our analysis, we also include\nthe order parameter for the chiral symmetry restoration, the chiral quark\ncondensate.\n  We found that $s_0$ and $\\Phi$ providing us the same information for the\ndeconfinement transition, both for the zero and finite chemical potential\ncases. At zero density, the critical temperatures for both quantities coincide\nexactly and, at finite $\\mu$ both order parameters provide evidence for the\nappearance of a quarkyonic phase.\n", "  We investigate the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects in $\\alpha$- and\n$\\kappa$-phase BEDT-TTF and BEDT-TSF organic salts. Contrary to the assumption\nthat SOC in organics is negligible due to light C, S, H atoms, we show the\nrelevance of such an interaction in a few representative cases. In the weakly\ncorrelated regime, SOC manifests primarily in the opening of energy gaps at\ndegenerate band touching points. This effect becomes especially important for\nDirac semimetals such as $\\alpha$-(ET)$_2$I$_3$. Furthermore, in the magnetic\ninsulating phase, SOC results in additional anisotropic exchange interactions,\nwhich provide a compelling explanation for the controversial field-induced\nbehaviour of the quantum spin-liquid candidate $\\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$.\nWe conclude by discussing the importance of SOC for the description of\nlow-energy properties in organics.\n", "  We describe a general method to model multicomponent ordered crystals using\nthe phase-field crystal (PFC) formalism. As a test case, a generic B2 compound\nis investigated. We are able to produce a line of either first-order or\nsecond-order order-disorder phase transitions, features that have not been\nincorporated in existing PFC approaches. Further, it is found that the only\nelastic constant for B2 that depends on ordering is $C_{11}$. This B2 model was\nthen used to study antiphase boundaries (APBs). The APBs were shown to\nreproduce classical mean field results. Dynamical simulations of ordering\nacross small-angle grain boundaries predict that dislocation cores pin the\nevolution of APBs.\n", "  We show the effects of a triangle singularity mechanism for the $\\gamma p \\to\nK^+\\Lambda(1405)$ reaction. The mechanism has a $N^*$ resonance around 2030\nMeV, which decays into $K^* \\Sigma$. The $K^*$ decays to $K^+ \\pi$, and the\n$\\pi \\Sigma$ merge to form the $\\Lambda(1405)$. This mechanism produces a peak\naround $\\sqrt{s} = 2110$ MeV, and has its largest contribution around\ncos$\\theta=0$. The addition of this mechanism to other conventional ones, leads\nto a good reproduction of ${\\rm d}\\sigma/{\\rm dcos}\\theta$ and the integrated\ncross section around this energy, providing a solution to a problem encountered\nin previous theoretical models.\n", "  We report the first measurements of spin injection in to graphene through a\n20 nm thick tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$) layer, along with a modified spin\nrelaxation time ({\\tau}s) in graphene in the WS$_2$ environment, via spin-valve\nand Hanle spin-precession measurements, respectively. First, during the\nspin-injection into graphene through a WS$_2$-graphene interface, we can tune\nthe interface resistance at different current bias and modify the spin\ninjection efficiency, in a correlation with the conductivity-mismatch theory.\nTemperature assisted tunneling is identified as a dominant mechanism for the\ncharge transport across the interface. Second, we measure the spin transport in\ngraphene, underneath the WS$_2$ crystal and observe a significant reduction in\nthe {\\tau}s down to 17 ps in graphene in the WS$_2$ covered region, compared to\nthat in its pristine state. The reduced {\\tau}s indicates the WS$_2$-proximity\ninduced additional dephasing of the spins in graphene.\n", "  An artificial microswimmer drifts in response to spatio-temporal modulations\nof an activating suspension medium. We consider two competing mechanisms\ncapable of influencing its tactic response: angular fluctuations, which help it\nexplore its surroundings and thus diffuse faster toward more active regions,\nand self-polarization, a mechanism inherent to self-propulsion, which tends to\norient the swimmer's velocity parallel or antiparallel to the local activation\ngradients. We investigate, both numerically and analytically, the combined\naction of such two mechanisms. By determining their relative magnitude, we\ncharacterize the selective transport of artificial microswimmers in\ninhomogeneous activating media.\n", "  We present the first SB2 orbital solution and disentanglement of the massive\nWolf-Rayet binary R145 (P = 159d) located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The\nprimary was claimed to have a stellar mass greater than 300Msun, making it a\ncandidate for the most massive star known. While the primary is a known late\ntype, H-rich Wolf-Rayet star (WN6h), the secondary could not be so far\nunambiguously detected. Using moderate resolution spectra, we are able to\nderive accurate radial velocities for both components. By performing\nsimultaneous orbital and polarimetric analyses, we derive the complete set of\norbital parameters, including the inclination. The spectra are disentangled and\nspectroscopically analyzed, and an analysis of the wind-wind collision zone is\nconducted.\n  The disentangled spectra and our models are consistent with a WN6h type for\nthe primary, and suggest that the secondary is an O3.5 If*/WN7 type star. We\nderive a high eccentricity of e = 0.78 and minimum masses of M1 sin^3 i ~ M2\nsin^3 i ~ 13 +- 2 Msun, with q = M2 / M1 = 1.01 +- 0.07. An analysis of\nemission excess stemming from a wind-wind collision yields a similar\ninclination to that obtained from polarimetry (i = 39 +- 6deg). Our analysis\nthus implies M1 = 53^{+40}_{-20} and M2 = 54^{+40}_{-20} Msun, excluding M1 >\n300Msun. A detailed comparison with evolution tracks calculated for single and\nbinary stars, as well as the high eccentricity, suggest that the components of\nthe system underwent quasi-homogeneous evolution and avoided mass-transfer.\nThis scenario would suggest current masses of ~ 80 Msun and initial masses of\nMi,1 ~ 105 and Mi,2 ~ 90Msun, consistent with the upper limits of our derived\norbital masses, and would imply an age of ~2.2 Myr.\n", "  The energy density and the pressure of SU(3) gauge theory at finite\ntemperature are studied by direct lattice measurements of the renormalized\nenergy-momentum tensor obtained by the gradient flow. Numerical analyses are\ncarried out with $\\beta=6.287$--$7.500$ corresponding to the lattice spacing\n$a= 0.013$--$0.061\\,\\mathrm{fm}$. The spatial (temporal) sizes are chosen to be\n$N_s= 64$, $96$, $128$ ($N_{\\tau}=12$, $16$, $20$, $22$, $24$) with the aspect\nratio, $5.33 \\le N_s/N_{\\tau} \\le 8$. Double extrapolation, $a\\rightarrow 0$\n(the continuum limit) followed by $t\\rightarrow 0$ (the zero flow-time limit),\nis taken using the numerical data. Above the critical temperature, the\nthermodynamic quantities are obtained with a few percent precision including\nstatistical and systematic errors. The results are in good agreement with\nprevious high-precision data obtained by using the integral method.\n", "  Fundamental quantum gravity theories are known to be notoriously difficult to\nextract viable testable predictions out of. In this paper, we aim to\nincorporate putative quantum corrections coming from loop quantum gravity in\nderiving modified dispersion relations for particles on a deformed Minkowski\nspacetime. We show how different choices of the Immirzi parameter can, in some\ncases, serendipitously lead to different outcomes for such modifications,\ndepending on the quantization scheme chosen. This allows one to differentiate\nbetween these quantization choices via testable phenomenological predictions.\n", "  We explore the rheology and flow-induced morphological changes of cholesteric\nliquid crystal patterns subject to Poiseuille flow within a slab geometry, and\nunder different anchoring conditions at the wall. Our focus is particularly on\nthe behaviour of Cholesteric Fingers of the first kind and of Blue Phase II.\nDepending on the applied pressure gradient, we observe a number of dynamic\nregimes with different rheological properties. Our results provide the first\ninsight into the flow response of cholesteric phases with fully two- or\nthree-dimensional director field patterns and normal and planar degenerate\nanchoring conditions as commonly realised in experiments. They are also of high\nrelevance for a fundamental understanding of complex liquid crystals in\nconfinement and an important step towards future microfluidic applications that\nare based on cholesteric liquid crystals.\n", "  Heat radiation and near-field radiative heat transfer can be strongly\nmanipulated by adjusting geometrical shapes, optical properties, or the\nrelative positions of the objects involved. Typically these objects are\nconsidered as embedded in vacuum. By applying the methods of fluctuational\nelectrodynamics, we derive general closed-form expressions for heat radiation\nand heat transfer in a system of $N$ arbitrary objects embedded in a passive\nnon-absorbing background medium. Taking into account the principle of\nreciprocity, we explicitly prove the symmetry and positivity of transfer in any\nsuch system. Regarding applications, we find that the heat radiation of a\nsphere as well as the heat transfer between two parallel plates is strongly\nenhanced by the presence of a background medium. Regarding near- and far-field\ntransfer through a gas like air, we show that a microscopic model (based on gas\nparticles) and a macroscopic model (using a dielectric contrast) yield\nidentical results. We also compare the radiative transfer through a medium like\nair and the energy transfer found from kinetic gas theory.\n", "  The production of $t\\overline{t}$, $W+b\\overline{b}$ and $W+c\\overline{c}$ is\nstudied in the forward region of proton-proton collisions collected at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 1.98 $\\pm$ 0.02 $\\mbox{fb}^{-1}$. The $W$ bosons are\nreconstructed in the decays $W\\rightarrow\\ell\\nu$, where $\\ell$ denotes muon or\nelectron, while the $b$ and $c$ quarks are reconstructed as jets. All measured\ncross-sections are in agreement with next-to-leading-order Standard Model\npredictions.\n", "  We calculate the severe radiative energy losses which occur at the base of\nblack hole jets using a relativistic fluid jet model, including in-situ\nacceleration of non-thermal leptons by magnetic reconnection. Our results\ndemonstrate that including a self-consistent treatment of radiative energy\nlosses is necessary to perform accurate MHD simulations of powerful jets and\nthat jet spectra calculated via post-processing are liable to vastly\noverestimate the amount of non-thermal emission. If no more than 95% of the\ninitial total jet power is radiated away by the plasma travels as it travels\nalong the length of the jet, we can place a lower bound on the magnetisation of\nthe jet plasma at the base of the jet. For typical powerful jets, we find that\nthe plasma at the jet base is required to be highly magnetised, with at least\n10,000 times more energy contained in magnetic fields than in non-thermal\nleptons. Using a simple power-law model of magnetic reconnection, motivated by\nsimulations of collisionless reconnection, we determine the allowed range of\nthe large-scale average reconnection rate along the jet, by restricting the\ntotal radiative energy losses incurred and the distance at which the jet first\ncomes into equipartition. We calculate analytic expressions for the cumulative\nradiative energy losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission along\njets, and derive analytic formulae for the constraint on the initial\nmagnetisation.\n", "  We present a reanalysis of XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer data of\nthe classical nova V2491 Cyg obtained from two different pointings, 40 d and 50\nd after outburst utilizing the SRON software SPEX version 2.05.04. We aim to\nmodel absorption components using hot collisionally ionized absorber models\nalong with interstellar absorption (of gas and dust origin separately). We find\nblackbody temperatures in a range 61-91 eV for the continuum yielding a white\ndwarf mass of 1.15-1.3 M_sun. We derive two different hot absorber components\nwith blueshifts yielding 2900-3800 km/s for the first (day 40) and 2600-3600\nkm/s for the second observation 50 days after outburst consistent with\nejecta/wind speeds. The two collisionally ionized hot absorption components\nhave temperatures kT_1 =1.0-3.6 keV and kT_2 =0.4-0.87 keV with rms velocities\n(sigma_v) 872 km/s and 56 km/s. These are consistent with shock temperatures in\nthe X-ray wavelengths. V2491 Cyg shows signature of H-burning with\nunderabundant carbon C/C_sun=0.3-0.5, and enhanced nitrogen N/N_sun=5-7 and\noxygen O/O_sun=16-43. We find the equivalent hydrogen column density of the hot\ncollisionally ionized absorbers in a range (0.6-18.0)x10^{23} cm^{-2} and\n(2.0-5.3)x10^{23} cm^{-2} on days 40 and 50 after outburst, respectively. Our\nfits yield the most adequate redchisq (range 1.8-2.9) up-to-date obtained for\nthe modeling of high resolution X-ray data of V2491 Cyg. An additional\nphotoionized absorber (third intrinsic absorber component) originating in the\nshell/ejecta improves the model fits with redchisq in a range 1.7-2.5, but\nshows only (1-0.1)% of the absorption by the collisionaly-ionized hot gas. Our\nanalysis reveals a second blackbody component on day 50 with effective\ntemperature 120-131 eV and effective radius about 10% of the WD which may\nindicate the onset of magnetic accretion.\n", "  We study several aspects of higher-order gravities constructed from general\ncontractions of the Riemann tensor and the metric in arbitrary dimensions.\nFirst, we use the fast-linearization procedure presented in arXiv:1607.06463 to\nobtain the equations satisfied by the metric perturbation modes on a maximally\nsymmetric background in the presence of matter and to classify\n$\\mathcal{L}($Riemann$)$ theories according to their spectrum. Then, we\nlinearize all theories up to quartic order in curvature and use this result to\nconstruct quartic versions of Einsteinian cubic gravity (ECG). In addition, we\nshow that the most general cubic gravity constructed in a dimension-independent\nway and which does not propagate the ghost-like spin-2 mode (but can propagate\nthe scalar) is a linear combination of $f($Lovelock$)$ invariants, plus the ECG\nterm, plus a New ghost-free gravity term. Next, we construct the generalized\nNewton potential and the Post-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma$ for general\n$\\mathcal{L}($Riemann$)$ gravities in arbitrary dimensions, unveiling some\ninteresting differences with respect to the four-dimensional case. We also\nstudy the emission and propagation of gravitational radiation from sources for\nthese theories in four dimensions, providing a generalized formula for the\npower emitted. Finally, we review Wald's formalism for general\n$\\mathcal{L}($Riemann$)$ theories and construct new explicit expressions for\nthe relevant quantities involved. Many examples illustrate our calculations.\n", "  The equation of state of a baryon-symmetric hadronic matter with hard-sphere\ninteractions is studied. It is assumed that mesons are point-like, but baryons\nand antibaryons have the same hard-core radius rB. Three possibilities are\nconsidered: 1) the baryon-baryon and antibaryon-baryon interactions are the\nsame; 2) baryons do not interact with antibaryons; 3) the baryon-antibaryon and\nmeson-(anti)baryon interactions are negligible. By choosing the parameter\nrB=0.3-0.6 fm, we calculate the nucleon to pion ratio as a function of\ntemperature and perform the fit of hadron yields measured in central Pb+Pb\ncollisions at the bombarding energy Ecm=2.76 TeV per nucleon pair. New\nnontrivial effects in the interacting hadron resonance gas at temperatures\n150-200 MeV are found.\n", "  We propose and construct a two-parameter perturbative expansion around a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker geometry that can be used to model\nhigh-order gravitational effects in the presence of non-linear structure. This\nframework reduces to the weak-field and slow-motion post-Newtonian treatment of\ngravity in the appropriate limits, but also includes the low-amplitude\nlarge-scale fluctuations that are important for cosmological modelling. We\nderive a set of field equations that can be applied to the late Universe, where\nnon-linear structure exists on supercluster scales, and perform a detailed\ninvestigation of the associated gauge problem. This allows us to identify a\nconsistent set of perturbed quantities in both the gravitational and matter\nsectors, and to construct a set of gauge-invariant quantities that correspond\nto each of them. The field equations, written in terms of these quantities,\ntake on a relatively simple form, and allow the effects of small-scale\nstructure on the large-scale properties of the Universe to be clearly\nidentified. We find that inhomogeneous structures source the global expansion,\nthat there exist new field equations at new orders, and that there is vector\ngravitational potential that is a hundred times larger than one might naively\nexpect from cosmological perturbation theory. Finally, we expect our formalism\nto be of use for calculating relativistic effects in upcoming ultra-large-scale\nsurveys, as the form of the gravitational coupling between small and large\nscales depends on the non-linearity of Einstein's equations, and occurs at what\nis normally thought of as first order in cosmological perturbations.\n", "  We show that a class of solutions of minimal supergravity in five dimensions\nis given by lifts of three--dimensional Einstein--Weyl structures of hyper-CR\ntype. We characterise this class as most general near--horizon limits of\nsupersymmetric solutions to the five--dimensional theory. In particular, we\ndeduce that a compact spatial section of a horizon can only be a Berger sphere,\na product metric on $S^1\\times S^2$ or a flat three-torus. We then consider the\nproblem of reconstructing all supersymmetric solutions from a given\nnear--horizon geometry. By exploiting the ellipticity of the linearised field\nequations we demonstrate that the moduli space of transverse infinitesimal\ndeformations of a near--horizon geometry is finite--dimensional.\n", "  The effective spin exchange coupling between impurities (adatoms) on graphene\nmediated by conduction electrons is studied as a function of the strength of\nthe potential part of the on-site energy $U$ of the electron-adatom\ninteraction. With increasing $U$, the exchange coupling becomes long-range,\ndetermined largely by the impurity levels with energies close to the Dirac\npoints. When adatoms reside on opposite sublattices, their exchange coupling,\nnormally antiferromagnetic, becomes ferromagnetic and resonantly enhanced at a\nspecific distance where an impurity level crosses the Dirac point.\n", "  Intensity mapping is now becoming a useful tool to study the large-scale\nstructure of the universe through spatial variations in the integrated emission\nfrom galaxies and the intergalactic medium. We study intensity mapping of the\nH-alpha 6563AA, [OIII]5007AA, [OII]3727AA and H-beta 4861AA lines at 0.8<z<5.2.\nThe mean intensities of these four emission lines are estimated using the\nobserved luminosity functions (LFs), cosmological simulations, and the star\nformation rate density (SFRD) derived from observations at z<5. We calculate\nthe intensity power spectra and consider the foreground contamination of other\nlines at lower redshifts. We use the proposed NASA small explorer SPHEREx (the\nSpectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and\nIces Explorer) as a case study for the detectability of the intensity power\nspectra of the four emission lines. We also investigate the cross correlation\nwith the 21-cm line probed by CHIME (the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping\nExperiment), Tianlai experiment and SKA (the Square Kilometer Array) at\n0.8<z<2.4. We find both the auto and cross power spectra can be well measured\nfor the H-alpha, [OIII] and [OII] lines at z<3, while it is more challenging\nfor the H-beta line. Finally, we estimate the constraint on the SFRD from\nintensity mapping, and find we can reach accuracy higher than 7% at z<4, which\nis better than usual measurements using the LFs of galaxies.\n", "  In the line-of-sight toward the DO-type white dwarf RX J0503.9-2854, the\ndensity of the interstellar medium (ISM) is very low, and thus the\ncontamination of the stellar spectrum almost negligible. This allows us to\nidentify many metal lines in a wide wavelength range from the extreme\nultraviolet to the near infrared. In previous spectral analyses, many metal\nlines in the ultraviolet spectrum of RX J0503.9-2854 have been identified. A\ncomplete line list of observed and identified lines is presented here. We\ncompared synthetic spectra that had been calculated from model atmospheres in\nnon-local thermodynamical equilibrium, with observations. In total, we\nidentified 1272 lines (279 of them were newly assigned) in the wavelength range\nfrom the extreme ultraviolet to the near infrared. 287 lines remain\nunidentified. A close inspection of the EUV shows that still no good fit to the\nobserved shape of the stellar continuum flux can be achieved although He, C, N,\nO, Al, Si, P, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cr, Ni Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Kr, Zr, Mo,\nSn, Xe, and Ba are included in the stellar atmosphere models. There are two\npossible reasons for the deviation between observed and synthetic flux in the\nEUV. Opacities from hitherto unconsidered elements in the model-atmosphere\ncalculation may be missing and/or the effective temperature is slightly lower\nthan previously determined.\n", "  The aim of the present paper is to consider the hyperbolic limit of an\nelliptic hypergeometric sum/integral identity, and associated lattice model of\nstatistical mechanics previously obtained by the second author. The hyperbolic\nsum/integral identity obtained from this limit, has two important physical\napplications in the context of the so-called gauge/YBE correspondence. For\nstatistical mechanics, this identity is equivalent to a new solution of the\nstar-triangle relation form of the Yang-Baxter equation, that directly\ngeneralises the Faddeev-Volkov models to the case of discrete and continuous\nspin variables. On the gauge theory side, this identity represents the duality\nof lens ($S_b^3/\\mathbb{Z}_r$) partition functions, for certain\nthree-dimensional $\\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric gauge theories.\n", "  Scalar fields, $\\phi_i$ can be coupled non-minimally to curvature and satisfy\nthe general criteria: (i) the theory has no mass input parameters, including\nthe Planck mass; (ii) the $\\phi_i$ have arbitrary values and gradients, but\nundergo a general expansion and relaxation to constant values that satisfy a\nnontrivial constraint, $K(\\phi_i) =$ constant; (iii) this constraint breaks\nscale symmetry spontaneously, and the Planck mass is dynamically generated;\n(iv) there can be adequate inflation associated with slow roll in a scale\ninvariant potential subject to the constraint; (v) the final vacuum can have a\nsmall to vanishing cosmological constant (vi) large hierarchies in vacuum\nexpectation values can naturally form; (vii) there is a harmless dilaton which\nnaturally eludes the usual constraints on massless scalars. These models are\ngoverned by a global Weyl scale symmetry and its conserved current, $K_\\mu$ .\nAt the quantum level the Weyl scale symmetry can be maintained by an invariant\nspecification of renormalized quantities.\n", "  The electronic transport properties of monolayer graphene have been studied\nbefore and after the deposition of a dilute coating of tungsten adatoms on the\nsurface. For coverages up to 2.5\\% of a monolayer, we find tungsten adatoms\nsimultaneously donate electrons to graphene and reduce the carrier mobility,\nimpacting the zero- and finite-field transport properties. Two independent\ntransport analyses suggest the adatoms lie nearly 1 nm above the surface. The\npresence of adatoms is also seen to impact the low field magnetoresistance,\naltering the signatures of weak localization.\n", "  Undoped iron superconductors accommodate $n=6$ electrons in five d-orbitals.\nExperimental and theoretical evidence shows that the strength of correlations\nincreases with hole-doping, as the electronic filling approaches half-filling\nwith $n=5$ electrons. This evidence delineates a scenario in which the parent\ncompound of iron superconductors is the half-filled system, in analogy to\ncuprate superconductors. In cuprates the superconductivity can be induced upon\nelectron or hole doping. In this work we propose to search for high-Tc\nsuperconductivity and strong correlations in chromium pnictides and\nchalcogenides with $n<5$ electrons. By means of ab-initio, slave spin and\nmulti-orbital RPA calculations we analyse the strength of the correlations and\nthe superconducting and magnetic instabilities in these systems with main focus\non LaCrAsO. We find that electron-doped LaCrAsO is a strongly correlated system\nwith competing magnetic interactions, being $(\\pi,\\pi)$ antiferromagnetism and\nnodal d-wave pairing the most plausible magnetic and superconducting\ninstabilities, respectively.\n", "  The solution of today's complex problems requires the grouping of task forces\nwhose members are usually connected remotely over long physical distances and\ndifferent time zones. Hence, understanding the effects of imposed communication\npatterns (i.e., who can communicate with whom) on group performance is\nimportant. Here, we use an agent-based model to explore the influence of the\nbetweenness centrality of the nodes on the time the group requires to find the\nglobal maxima of NK-fitness landscapes. The agents cooperate by broadcasting\nmessages, informing on their fitness to their neighbors, and use this\ninformation to copy the more successful agents in their neighborhood. We find\nthat for easy tasks (smooth landscapes), the topology of the communication\nnetwork has no effect on the performance of the group, and that the more\ncentral nodes are the most likely to find the global maximum first. For\ndifficult tasks (rugged landscapes), however, we find a positive correlation\nbetween the variance of the betweenness among the network nodes and the group\nperformance. For these tasks, the performances of individual nodes are strongly\ninfluenced by the agents dispositions to cooperate and by the particular\nrealizations of the rugged landscapes.\n", "  We show that measurements of the fluctuations in the near-infrared background\n(NIRB) from the AKARI satellite can be explained by faint galaxy populations at\nlow redshifts. We demonstrate this using reconstructed images from deep galaxy\ncatalogs (HUGS/S-CANDELS) and two independent galaxy population models. In all\ncases, we find that the NIRB fluctuations measured by AKARI are consistent with\nfaint galaxies and there is no need for a contribution from unknown\npopulations. We find no evidence for a steep Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum for the\nunderlying sources as previously reported. The apparent Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum\nat large angular scales is likely a consequence of galaxies being removed\nsystematically to deeper levels in the longer wavelength channels.\n", "  The Sagnac interferometry has been widely used to measure rotation frequency.\nBeyond the conventional single-particle Sagnac interferometry, we propose an\natomic Sagnac interferometry via multi-particle entangled states. In our\nscheme, an ensemble of entangled two-state Bose atoms are moved in a ring by a\nstate-dependent rotating potential and then are recombined for interference via\nRamsey pulses after a specific time determined by the state-dependent rotating\npotential. The ultimate rotation sensitivity can be improved to the Heisenberg\nlimit if the initial internal degrees of freedom are entangled. By implementing\nparity measurement, the ultimate measurement precision can be saturated and the\nachieved measurement precisions approach to the Heisenberg limit. Our results\nprovide a promising way to exploit many-body quantum entanglement in precision\nmetrology of rotation sensing.\n", "  In the solar wind, power spectral density (PSD) of the magnetic field\nfluctuations generally follow the so-called Kolmogorov spectrum f^-5/3 in the\ninertial range, where the dynamics is thought to be dominated by nonlinear\ninteractions between counter-propagating incompressible Alfv\\'en wave parquets.\nThese features are thought to be ubiquitous in space plasmas. The present study\ngives a new and more complex picture of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence\nas observed in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The study uses three years of\nin-situ data from the Cluster mission to explore the nature of the magnetic\nfluctuations at MHD scales in different locations within the magnetosheath,\nincluding flanks and subsolar regions. It is found that the magnetic field\nfluctuations at MHD scales generally have a PSD close to f^-1 (shallower than\nthe Kolmogorov one f^-5/3) down to the ion characteristic scale, which recalls\nthe energy containing scales of solar wind turbulence. The Kolmogorov spectrum\nis observed only away from the bow shock toward the flank and the magnetopause\nregions in 17% of the analyzed time intervals. Measuring the magnetic\ncompressibility, it is shown that only a fraction (35%) of the observed\nKolmogorov spectra were populated by shear Alfv\\'enic fluctuations, whereas the\nmajority of the events (65%) was found to be dominated by compressible\nmagnetosonic-like fluctuations, which contrasts with well-known turbulence\nproperties in the solar wind. This study gives a first comprehensive view of\nthe origin of the f^-1 and the transition to the Kolmogorov inertial range;\nboth questions remain controversial in solar wind turbulence.\n", "  We present a study of the spreading of liquid droplets on a solid substrate\nat very small scales. We focus on the regime where effective wetting energy\n(binding potential) and surface tension effects significantly influence steady\nand spreading droplets. In particular, we focus on strong packing and layering\neffects in the liquid near the substrate due to underlying density oscillations\nin the fluid caused by attractive substrate-liquid interactions. We show that\nsuch phenomena can be described by a thin-film (or long-wave or lubrication)\nmodel including an oscillatory Derjaguin (or disjoining/conjoining) pressure,\nand explore the effects it has on steady droplet shapes and the spreading\ndynamics of droplets on both, an adsorption (or precursor) layer and completely\ndry substrates. At the molecular scale, commonly used two-term binding\npotentials with a single preferred minimum controlling the adsorption layer\nheight are inadequate to capture the rich behaviour caused by the near-wall\nlayered molecular packing. The adsorption layer is often sub-monolayer in\nthickness, i.e., the dynamics along the layer consists of single-particle\nhopping, leading to a diffusive dynamics, rather than the collective\nhydrodynamic motion implicit in standard thin-film models. We therefore modify\nthe model in such a way that for thicker films the standard hydrodynamic theory\nis realised, but for very thin layers a diffusion equation is recovered.\n", "  Context. Material processed by the CNO cycle in stellar interiors is enriched\nin 17O. When mixing processes from the stellar surface reach these layers, as\noccurs when stars become red giants and undergo the first dredge up, the\nabundance of 17O increases. Such an occurrence explains the drop of the 16O/17O\nobserved in RGB stars with mass larger than 1.5 M_\\solar. As a consequence, the\ninterstellar medium is continuously polluted by the wind of evolved stars\nenriched in 17O . Aims. Recently, the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear\nAstrophysics (LUNA) collaboration released an improved rate of the\n17O(p,alpha)14N reaction. In this paper we discuss the impact that the revised\nrate has on the 16O/17O ratio at the stellar surface and on 17O stellar yields.\nMethods. We computed stellar models of initial mass between 1 and 20 M_\\solar\nand compared the results obtained by adopting the revised rate of the\n17O(p,alpha)14N to those obtained using previous rates. Results. The post-first\ndredge up 16O/17O ratios are about 20% larger than previously obtained.\nNegligible variations are found in the case of the second and the third dredge\nup. In spite of the larger 17O(p,alpha)14N rate, we confirm previous claims\nthat an extra-mixing process on the red giant branch, commonly invoked to\nexplain the low carbon isotopic ratio observed in bright low-mass giant stars,\nmarginally affects the 16O/17O ratio. Possible effects on AGB extra-mixing\nepisodes are also discussed. As a whole, a substantial reduction of 17O stellar\nyields is found. In particular, the net yield of stars with mass ranging\nbetween 2 and 20 M_\\solar is 15 to 40% smaller than previously estimated.\nConclusions. The revision of the 17O(p,alpha)14N rate has a major impact on the\ninterpretation of the 16O/17O observed in evolved giants, in stardust grains\nand on the 17O stellar yields.\n", "  Energy level spectrum of protactinium atom (Pa, Z=91) is simulated with a CI\ncalculation. Levels belonging to the separate manifolds of a given total\nangular momentum and parity $J^\\pi$ exhibit distinct properties of many-body\nquantum chaos. Moreover, an extremely strong enhancement of small perturbations\ntakes place. As an example, effective three-electron interaction is\ninvestigated and found to play a significant role in the system. Chaotic\nproperties of the eigenstates allow one to develop a statistical theory and\npredict probabilities of different processes in chaotic systems.\n", "  As the global magnetic field of the Sun has an activity cycle, one expects to\nobserve some variation of the dynamical properties of the flows visible in the\nphotosphere. We investigate the flow field during the solar cycle by analysing\nSDO/HMI observations of continuum intensity, Doppler velocity and longitudinal\nmagnetic field. We first picked data at disk center during 6 years along the\nsolar cycle with a 48-hour time step in order to study the overall evolution of\nthe continuum intensity and magnetic field. Then we focused on thirty 6-hour\nsequences of quiet regions without any remnant of magnetic activity separated\nby 6 months, in summer and winter, when disk center latitude B0 is close to\nzero. The horizontal velocity was derived from the local correlation tracking\ntechnique over a field of view of 216.4Mm x 216.4Mm located at disk center. Our\nmeasurements at disk center show the stability of the flow properties between\nmeso- and supergranular scales along the solar cycle. The network magnetic\nfield, produced locally at disk center independently from large scale dynamo,\ntogether with continuum contrast, vertical and horizontal flows, seem to remain\nconstant during the solar cycle.\n", "  We study jamming in model freely rotating polymers as a function of chain\nlength $N$ and bond angle $\\theta_0$. The volume fraction at jamming,\n$\\phi_J(\\theta_0)$, is minimal for rigid-rod-like chains ($\\theta_0 = 0$), and\nincreases monotonically with increasing $\\theta_0 \\leq \\pi/2$. In contrast to\nflexible polymers, marginally jammed states of freely rotating polymers are\nhighly hypostatic, even when bond and angle constraints are accounted for.\nLarge aspect ratio (small $\\theta_0$) chains behave comparably to stiff fibers:\nresistance to large-scale bending plays a major role in their jamming\nphenomenology. Low aspect ratio (large $\\theta_0$) chains behave more like\nflexible polymers, but still jam at much lower densities due to the presence of\nfrozen-in 3-body correlations corresponding to the fixed bond angles.\nLong-chain systems jam at lower $\\phi$ and are more hypostatic at jamming than\nshort-chain systems. Implications of these findings for polymer solidification\nare discussed.\n", "  Analytic solutions of the mean-field induction equation predict a\nnonoscillatory dynamo for homogeneous helical turbulence or constant alpha\neffect in unbounded or periodic domains. Oscillatory dynamos are generally\nthought impossible for constant alpha. We present an analytic solution for a\none-dimensional bounded domain resulting in oscillatory solutions for constant\nalpha, but different (Dirichlet and von Neumann or perfect conductor and\nvacuum) boundary conditions on the two boundaries. We solve a second order\ncomplex equation and superimpose two independent solutions to obey both\nboundary conditions. The solution has time-independent energy density. On one\nend where the function value vanishes, the second derivative is finite, which\nwould not be correctly reproduced with sine-like expansion functions where a\nnode coincides with an inflection point. The field always migrates away from\nthe perfect conductor boundary toward the vacuum boundary, independently of the\nsign of alpha. The obtained solution may serve as a benchmark for numerical\ndynamo experiments and as a pedagogical illustration that oscillatory migratory\ndynamos are possible with constant alpha.\n", "  The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is a deep 120-168 MHz imaging survey\nthat will eventually cover the entire Northern sky. Each of the 3170 pointings\nwill be observed for 8 hrs, which, at most declinations, is sufficient to\nproduce ~5arcsec resolution images with a sensitivity of ~0.1mJy/beam and\naccomplish the main scientific aims of the survey which are to explore the\nformation and evolution of massive black holes, galaxies, clusters of galaxies\nand large-scale structure. Due to the compact core and long baselines of LOFAR,\nthe images provide excellent sensitivity to both highly extended and compact\nemission. For legacy value, the data are archived at high spectral and time\nresolution to facilitate subarcsecond imaging and spectral line studies. In\nthis paper we provide an overview of the LoTSS. We outline the survey strategy,\nthe observational status, the current calibration techniques, a preliminary\ndata release, and the anticipated scientific impact. The preliminary images\nthat we have released were created using a fully-automated but\ndirection-independent calibration strategy and are significantly more sensitive\nthan those produced by any existing large-area low-frequency survey. In excess\nof 44,000 sources are detected in the images that have a resolution of\n25arcsec, typical noise levels of less than 0.5 mJy/beam, and cover an area of\nover 350 square degrees in the region of the HETDEX Spring Field (right\nascension 10h45m00s to 15h30m00s and declination 45d00m00s to 57d00m00s).\n", "  We analyze, in general terms, the evolution of energy levels in quantum\nmechanics, as a function of a coupling parameter, and demonstrate the\npossibility of level crossings in systems described by irreducible matrices. In\nlong-range interactions, the coupling parameter is the interatomic distance. We\ndemonstrate the utility of adjacency matrices and adjacency graphs in the\nanalysis of \"hidden\" symmetries of a problem; these allow us to break reducible\nmatrices into irreducible subcomponents. A possible breakdown of the\nno-crossing theorem for higher-dimensional irreducible matrices is indicated,\nand an application to the 2S-2S interaction in hydrogen is briefly described.\nThe analysis of interatomic interactions in this system is important for\nfurther progress on optical measurements of the 2S hyperfine splitting.\n", "  Quantum optical states are fragile and can become corrupted when passed\nthrough a lossy communication channel. Unlike for classical signals, optical\namplifiers cannot be used to recover quantum signals. Quantum repeaters have\nbeen proposed as a way of reducing errors and hence increasing the range of\nquantum communications. Current protocols target specific discrete encodings,\nfor example quantum bits encoded on the polarization of single photons. We\nintroduce a more general approach that can reduce the effect of loss on any\nquantum optical encoding, including those based on continuous variables such as\nthe field amplitudes. We show that in principle the protocol incurs a resource\ncost that scales polynomially with distance. We analyse the simplest\nimplementation and find that whilst its range is limited it can still achieve\nuseful improvements in the distance over which quantum entanglement of field\namplitudes can be distributed.\n", "  We suggest a new family of Co/Ni-based materials that may host unconventional\nhigh temperature superconductivity (high-T$_c$). These materials carry layered\nsquare lattices with each layer being formed by vertex-shared transition metal\ntetrahedra cation-anion complexes. The electronic physics in these materials is\ndetermined by the two dimensional layer and is fully attributed to the three\nnear degenerated $t_{2g}$ d-orbitals close to a $d^7$ filling configuration in\nthe d-shell of Co/Ni atoms . The electronic structure meets the necessary\ncriteria for unconventional high T$_c$ materials proposed recently by us to\nunify the two known high-T$_c$ families, cuprates and iron-based\nsuperconductors. We predict that they host superconducting states with a d-wave\npairing symmetry with T$_c$ potentially higher than those of iron-based\nsuperconductors. These materials, if realized, can be a fertile new ground to\nstudy strongly correlated electronic physics and provide decisive evidence for\nsuperconducting pairing mechanism.\n", "  We define two classes of colorings that have odd or even chirality on\nhexagonal lattices. This parity is an invariant in the dynamics of all loops,\nand explains why standard Monte-Carlo algorithms are nonergodic. We argue that\nadding the motion of \"stranded\" loops allows for parity changes. By\nimplementing this algorithm, we show that the even and odd classes have the\nsame entropy. In general, they do not have the same number of states, except\nfor the special geometry of long strips, where a Z$_2$ symmetry between even\nand odd states occurs in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  We show how generalized Gibbs-Shannon entropies can provide new insights on\nthe statistical properties of texts. The universal distribution of word\nfrequencies (Zipf's law) implies that the generalized entropies, computed at\nthe word level, are dominated by words in a specific range of frequencies. Here\nwe show that this is the case not only for the generalized entropies but also\nfor the generalized (Jensen-Shannon) divergences, used to compute the\nsimilarity between different texts. This finding allows us to identify the\ncontribution of specific words (and word frequencies) for the different\ngeneralized entropies and also to estimate the size of the databases needed to\nobtain a reliable estimation of the divergences. We test our results in large\ndatabases of books (from the Google n-gram database) and scientific papers\n(indexed by Web of Science).\n", "  Amorphous materials lack long-range order but short-range order can still\npersist through the recurrence of similar local packing motifs. While the\nshort-range order in bulk amorphous phases has been well studied and identified\nas an intrinsic factor determining the material properties, these features have\nnot been studied in disordered intergranular complexions. In this work, the\nshort-range order in two types of amorphous complexions is studied with a\nVoronoi tessellation method. Amorphous complexions can have three distinct\nregions: amorphous-crystalline interfaces, regions deep inside the films that\nhave short-range order identical to a bulk amorphous phase, and transition\nregions that connect the first two regions. However, thin amorphous films\ncontain only the amorphous-crystalline interface and the transition region,\nproviding further evidence of the constraints imposed by the abutting crystals.\nThe thickness of the transition region depends on film thickness at low\ntemperatures but becomes thickness-independent at high temperatures. Similarly,\nthe complexion short-range order is dependent on the interfacing crystal plane\nat low temperatures, but this effect is lost at high temperatures. Our findings\nshow that amorphous complexions contain spatial gradients in short-range order,\nmeaning they are both structurally and chemically different from bulk metallic\nglasses.\n", "  We report the results of a parquet renormalization group (RG) study of\ncompeting instabilities in the full 2D four pocket, three orbital low-energy\nmodel for iron-based superconductors. We derive and analyze the RG flow of the\ncouplings, which describe all symmetry-allowed interactions between low-energy\nfermions. Despite that the number of the couplings is large, we argue that\nthere are only two stable fixed trajectories of the RG flow and one weakly\nunstable fixed trajectory with a single unstable direction. Each fixed\ntrajectory has a finite basin of attraction in the space of initial system\nparameters. On the stable trajectories, either interactions involving only\n$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ or only $d_{xy}$ orbital components on the electron\npockets dominate, while on the weakly unstable trajectory interactions\ninvolving $d_{xz}$ ($d_{yz}$) and $d_{xy}$ orbital states on the electron\npockets remain comparable. The behavior along the two stable fixed trajectories\nhas been analyzed earlier [A.V. Chubukov, M. Khodas, and R.M. Fernandes,\narXiv:1602.05503]. Here we focus on the system behavior along the weakly\nunstable trajectory and apply the results to FeSe. We find, based on the\nanalysis of susceptibilities along this trajectory, that the leading\ninstability upon lowering the temperature is towards a {\\it three-component}\nd-wave orbital nematic order. Two components are the differences between\nfermionic densities on $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals on hole pockets and on\nelectron pockets, and the third one is the difference between the densities of\n$d_{xy}$ orbitals on the two electron pockets. We argue that this order is\nconsistent with the splitting of band degeneracies, observed in recent\nphotoemission data on FeSe by A. Fedorov et al [arXiv:1606.03022].\n", "  Prompted by plans to conduct a new neutron oscillation experiment at the\nEuropean Spallation Source (ESS), we consider issues associated with the\nmagnetic field that must be present, some of which are potentially exacerbated\nby the significantly larger length $l$ contemplated for the neutron propagation\nregion. To this end, we introduce a stochastic model of the residual magnetic\nfield within the propagation region which draws on features of magnetic\nprofiles measured during the last free neutron oscillation experiment\n[conducted at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in the 1990's]. We average over\nboth fluctuations in the magnetic field sampled by neutrons, and representative\nspectra of neutron speeds. We find that deviations from the quasi-free result\nfor the antineutron probability do not depend quadratically on $l$ (as a naive\nperturbative estimate would suggest) but increase only linearly with $l$. As\nregards the large spikes in the magnetic field which can be expected at, for\nexample, joints in the magnetic shielding of the propagation region (despite\ncompensating currents and magnetic idealization of the shield), we demonstrate\nthat their effect scales as $l/D^{3/2}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the\ncylindrical magnetic shielding. Our arguments suggest that, provided the\ndimensions of the propagation region are such that the ratio $l/D^{3/2}$ does\nnot exceed the value pertinent to the ILL experiment, and these spikes occur\nclose to either end of the propagation region, they can be neglected. We also\nestablish that any large magnetic field encountered after the propagation\nregion is exited will not diminish the probability for antineutron detection.\nFor the range of values of $l$ of most interest to the ESS experiment, it\nshould suffice to improve on the level of magnetic suppression achieved at the\nILL by a factor of two.\n", "  We systematically study the possibilities for asymmetric dark matter in the\ncontext of non-supersymmetric SO(10) models of grand unification. Dark matter\nstability in SO(10) is guaranteed by a remnant $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry which is\npreserved when the intermediate scale gauge subgroup of SO(10) is broken by a\n${\\bf 126}$ dimensional representation. The asymmetry in the dark matter states\nis directly generated through the out-of-equilibrium decay of particles around\nthe intermediate scale, or transferred from the baryon/lepton asymmetry\ngenerated in the Standard Model sector by leptogenesis. We systematically\nclassify possible asymmetric dark matter candidates in terms of their quantum\nnumbers, and derive the conditions for each case that the observed dark matter\ndensity is (mostly) explained by the asymmetry of dark matter particles.\n", "  We show that all the singlet even-frequency, singlet odd-frequency, triplet\neven-frequency and triplet odd-frequency pairings, and together with the\ncorresponding order parameters (gaps) can be realized in InSb (110)\nspin-orbit-coupled quantum well in proximity to s-wave superconductor in\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase or with a supercurrent. It is revealed\nthat with the singlet even-frequency order parameter induced by the proximity\neffect, triplet even-frequency pairing is induced due to the broken\nspin-rotational symmetry by the spin-orbit coupling. Since the translational\nsymmetry is broken by the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pair in the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase or with a supercurrent, the singlet\nodd-frequency pairing can be induced. With the translational and\nspin-rotational asymmetries, the triplet odd-frequency pairing is also\nrealized. Then, we show that the corresponding order parameters can be obtained\nfrom the self-energy of the electron-electron Coulomb interaction with the\ndynamic screening. The singlet and the induced triplet even-frequency order\nparameters are found to exhibit the conventional s-wave and p-wave characters\nin the momentum space, respectively. Whereas for the induced odd-frequency\norder parameters in quantum well, the singlet and triplet ones show the p-wave\nand d-wave characters, respectively. Moreover, the p-wave character of the\nsinglet odd-frequency order parameter exhibits anisotropy with respect to the\ndirection of the center-of-mass momentum. While for the triplet one, we find\nthat $d_{x^2}$-wave and $d_{xy}$-wave characters can be obtained with respect\nto the direction of the center-of-mass momentum. ......\n", "  GRB 160625B is an extremely-bright outburst with well-monitored afterglow\nemission. The geometry-corrected energy is high up to $\\sim 5.2\\times10^{52}$\nerg or even $\\sim 8\\times 10^{52}$ erg, rendering it the most energetic GRB\nprompt emission recorded so far. We analyzed the time-resolved spectra of the\nprompt emission and found that in some intervals there were likely\nthermal-radiation components and the high energy emission were characterized by\nsignificant cutoff. The bulk Lorentz factors of the outflow material are\nestimated accordingly. We found out that the Lorentz factors derived in the\nthermal-radiation model are consistent with the luminosity-Lorentz factor\ncorrelation found in other bursts as well as in GRB 090902B for the\ntime-resolved thermal-radiation components. While the spectral cutoff model\nyields much lower Lorentz factors that are in tension with the constraints set\nby the electron pair Compoton scattering process. We then suggest that these\nspectral cutoffs are more likely related to the particle acceleration process\nand that one should be careful in estimating the Lorentz factors if the\nspectrum cuts at a rather low energy (e.g., $\\sim$ tens MeV). The nature of the\ncentral engine has also been discussed and a stellar-mass black hole is likely\nfavored.\n", "  We consider inflation within a model framework where the Higgs boson arises\nas a pseudo-Goldstone boson associated with the breaking of a global symmetry\nat a scale significantly larger than the electroweak one. We show that in such\na model the scalar self-couplings can be parametrically suppressed and,\nconsequently, the non-minimal couplings to gravity can be of order one or less,\nwhile the inflationary predictions of the model remain compatible with the\nprecision cosmological observations. Furthermore, in the model we study, the\nexistence of the electroweak scale is entirely due to the inflaton field. Our\nmodel therefore suggests that inflation and low energy particle phenomenology\nmay be more entwined than assumed so far.\n", "  Context. The details of the C/O core structure in white dwarf stars has\nmostly remained inaccessible to the technique of asteroseismology, despite\nseveral attempts carried out in the past.\n  Aims. We re-assess the potential of asteroseismology for probing the chemical\nstratification in white dwarf cores, in light of new highly efficient tools\nrecently developed for that purpose.\n  Methods. Using the forward modeling approach and a new parameterization for\nthe core chemical stratification in ZZ Ceti stars, we test several situations\ntypical of the usually limited constraints available, such as small numbers of\nobserved independent modes, to carry out asteroseismology of these stars.\n  Results. We find that, even with a limited number of modes, the core chemical\nstratification (in particular, the location of the steep chemical transitions\nexpected in the oxygen profile) can be determined quite precisely due to the\nsignificant sensitivity of some confined modes to partial reflexion (trapping)\neffects. These effects are similar to the well known trapping induced by the\nshallower chemical transitions at the edge of the core and at the bottom of the\nH-rich envelope. We also find that success to unravel the core structure\ndepends on the information content of the available seismic data. In some\ncases, it may not be possible to isolate a unique, well-defined seismic\nsolution and the problem remains degenerate.\n  Conclusions. Our results establish that constraining the core chemical\nstratification in white dwarf stars based solely on asteroseismology is\npossible, an opportunity that we have started to exploit.\n", "  We report static and dynamic first-principles calculations that provide\natomistic pictures of the initial stage of the oxidation processes occurring at\nthe ($11\\bar20$) surface of 4H-SiC. Our results unveil reaction pathways and\ntheir associated free-energy barriers for the adsorption of oxygen and the\ndesorption of carbon atoms. We find that oxygen adsorption shows structural\nmulti-stability and that the surface-bridge sites are the most stable and\ncrucial sites for subsequent oxidation. We find that an approaching O$_2$\nmolecule is adsorbed, then dissociated and finally migrates toward these\nsurface-bridge sites with a free-energy barrier of 0.7 eV at the ($11\\bar20$)\nsurface. We also find that a CO molecule is desorbed from the metastable\noxidized structure upon the overcoming of a free-energy barrier of 2.4$\\sim$2.6\neV, thus constituting one of the annihilation process of C during the\noxidation. The results of the CO molecule desorption on the ($11\\bar20$)\nsurface are compared with the ($000\\bar1$) surface. A catalytic effect of\ndangling bonds at the surface, causing a drastic reduction of the CO desorption\nenergy, is found on the ($000\\bar1$) surface and the microscopic picture of the\neffect is ascribed to an electron transfer from the Si to C dangling bonds. The\nintrinsic ($11\\bar20$) surface does not show this catalytic effect, and this is\nbecause the surface consists of an equal amount of Si and C dangling bonds and\nthe electron transfer occurs before the desorption.\n", "  We formulate and solve the perhaps simplest two-body bound state problem for\ninteracting Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions. A two-body bound state is\npredicted for gapped graphene monolayers in the presence of weakly repulsive\nelectron-electron interactions and a Coulomb impurity with charge $Ze>0$, where\nthe most interesting case corresponds to $Z=1$. We introduce a variational\nChandrasekhar-Dirac spinor wave function and show the existence of at least one\nbound state. This state leaves clear signatures accessible by scanning\ntunneling microscopy. One may thereby obtain direct information about the\nstrength of electron-electron interactions in graphene.\n", "  We model the infall of a 2e5 Msun satellite galaxy on to the inner 200 parsec\nof our Galaxy, to test whether the satellite could perturb the gas previously\non stable orbits in the central molecular zone (CMZ), as proposed by Lang et\nal. (2013). This process would have driven a large gas inflow around 10 Myr\nago, necessary to explain the past high accretion rate onto the super-massive\nblack hole, and the presence of young stars in the inner parsecs of the Galaxy.\nOur hydrodynamical simulations show a much smaller inflow of gas, not\nsufficient to produce the aforementioned effects.\n", "  We consider a modified Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model in which drivers do not\ndecelerate if their speed is smaller than the headway (number of empty sites to\nthe car ahead). (In the original NS model, such a reduction in speed occurs\nwith probability $p$, independent of the headway, as long as the current speed\nis greater than zero.) In the modified model the free-flow state (with all\nvehicles traveling at the maximum speed, $v_{max}$) is {\\it absorbing} for\ndensities $\\rho$ smaller than a critical value $\\rho_c = 1/(v_{max} + 2)$. The\nphase diagram in the $\\rho - p$ plane is reentrant: for densities in the range\n$\\rho_{c,<} < \\rho < \\rho_c$, both small and large values of $p$ favor free\nflow, while for intermediate values, a nonzero fraction of vehicles have speeds\n$< v_{max}$. In addition to representing a more realistic description of\ndriving behavior, this change leads to a better understanding of the phase\ntransition in the original model. Our results suggest an unexpected connection\nbetween traffic models and stochastic sandpiles.\n", "  The electronic structure of vanadium measured by Angular Correlation of\nelectron-positron Annihilation Radiation (ACAR) is compared with the\npredictions of the combined Density Functional and Dynamical Mean-Field Theory\n(DMFT). Reconstructing the momentum density from five 2D projections we were\nable to determine the full Fermi surface and found excellent agreement with the\nDMFT calculations. In particular, we show that the local, dynamic self-energy\ncorrections contribute to the anisotropy of the momentum density and need to be\nincluded to explain the experimental results.\n", "  Multi-band images of the very isolated spiral galaxy NGC 5523 show a number\nof unusual features consistent with NGC 5523 having experienced a significant\nmerger: (1) Near-infrared (NIR) images from the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)\nand the WIYN 3.5-m telescope reveal a nucleated bulge-like structure embedded\nin a spiral disk. (2) The bulge is offset by ~1.8 kpc from a brightness minimum\nat the center of the optically bright inner disk. (3) A tidal stream, possibly\nassociated with an ongoing satellite interaction, extends from the nucleated\nbulge along the disk. We interpret these properties as the results of one or\nmore non-disruptive mergers between NGC 5523 and companion galaxies or\nsatellites, raising the possibility that some galaxies become isolated because\nthey have merged with former companions.\n", "  Field patterns occur in space-time microstructures such that a disturbance\npropagating along a characteristic line does not evolve into a cascade of\ndisturbances, but rather concentrates on a pattern of characteristic lines.\nThis pattern is the field pattern. In one spatial direction plus time, the\nfield patterns occur when the slope of the characteristics is, in a sense,\ncommensurate with the space-time microstructure. Field patterns with different\nspatial shifts do not generally interact, but rather evolve as if they live in\nseparate dimensions, as many dimensions as the number of field patterns.\nAlternatively one can view a collection as a multicomponent potential, with as\nmany components as the number of field patterns. Presumably if one added a tiny\nnonlinear term to the wave equation one would then see interactions between\nthese field patterns in the multidimensional space that one can consider them\nto live, or between the different field components of the multicomponent\npotential if one views them that way. As a result of PT-symmetry many of the\ncomplex eigenvalues of an appropriately defined transfer matrix have unit norm\nand hence the corresponding eigenvectors correspond to propagating modes. There\nare also modes that blow up exponentially with time.\n", "  Besides their stunning physical properties which are unmatched in a classical\nworld, squeezed states of electromagnetic radiation bear advanced application\npotentials in quantum information systems and precision metrology, including\ngravitational wave detectors with unprecedented sensitivity. Since the first\nexperiments on such nonclassical light, quantum analysis has been based on\nhomodyning techniques and photon correlation measurements. These methods\nrequire a well-defined carrier frequency and photons contained in a quantum\nstate need to be absorbed or amplified. They currently function in the visible\nto near-infrared and microwave spectral ranges. Quantum nondemolition\nexperiments may be performed at the expense of excess fluctuations in another\nquadrature. Here we generate mid-infrared time-locked patterns of squeezed\nvacuum noise. After propagation through free space, the quantum fluctuations of\nthe electric field are studied in the time domain by electro-optic sampling\nwith few-femtosecond laser pulses. We directly compare the local noise\namplitude to the level of bare vacuum fluctuations. This nonlinear approach\noperates off resonance without absorption or amplification of the field that is\ninvestigated. Subcycle intervals with noise level significantly below the pure\nquantum vacuum are found. Enhanced fluctuations in adjacent time segments\nmanifest generation of highly correlated quantum radiation as a consequence of\nthe uncertainty principle. Together with efforts in the far infrared, this work\nopens a window to the elementary quantum dynamics of light and matter in an\nenergy range at the boundary between vacuum and thermal background conditions.\n", "  Previous studies have discovered a population of small granules with\ndiameters less than 800 km showing differing physical properties. High\nresolution simulations and observations of the solar granulation, in\ncombination with automated segmentation and tracking algorithms, allow us to\nstudy the evolution of the structural and physical properties of these granules\nand surrounding vortex motions with high temporal and spatial accuracy. We\nfocus on the dynamics of granules (lifetime, fragmentation, size, position,\nintensity, vertical velocity) over time and the influence of strong vortex\nmotions. Of special interest are the dynamics of small granules compared to\nregular-sized granules. We developed a temporal tracking algorithm based on our\ndeveloped segmentation algorithm for solar granulation. This was applied to\nradiation hydrodynamics simulations and high resolution observations of the\nquiet Sun by SUNRISE/IMaX. The dynamics of small granules differ in regard to\ntheir diameter, intensity and depth evolution compared to regular granules. The\ntracked granules in the simulation and observations reveal similar dynamics\n(lifetime, evolution of size, vertical velocity and intensity). The\nfragmentation analysis shows that the majority of granules in simulations do\nnot fragment, while the opposite was found in observations. Strong vortex\nmotions were detected at the location of small granules. Regions of strong\nvertical vorticity show high intensities and downflow velocities, and live up\nto several minutes. The analysis of granules separated according to their\ndiameter in different groups reveals strongly differing behaviors. The largest\ndiscrepancies can be found within the groups of small, medium-sized and large\ngranules and have to be analyzed independently. The predominant location of\nvortex motions on and close to small granules indicates a strong influence on\nthe dynamics of granules.\n", "  MoEDAL is designed to identify new physics in the form of long-lived\nhighly-ionising particles produced in high-energy LHC collisions. Its arrays of\nplastic nuclear-track detectors and aluminium trapping volumes provide two\nindependent passive detection techniques. We present here the results of a\nfirst search for magnetic monopole production in 13 TeV proton-proton\ncollisions using the trapping technique, extending a previous publication with\n8 TeV data during LHC run-1. A total of 222 kg of MoEDAL trapping detector\nsamples was exposed in the forward region and analysed by searching for induced\npersistent currents after passage through a superconducting magnetometer.\nMagnetic charges exceeding half the Dirac charge are excluded in all samples\nand limits are placed for the first time on the production of magnetic\nmonopoles in 13 TeV $pp$ collisions. The search probes mass ranges previously\ninaccessible to collider experiments for up to five times the Dirac charge.\n", "  We demonstrate that an all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junction with current\nperpendicular to the plane geometry can be used as an efficient spintronics\ndevice with potential high frequency operation. By using state-of-the-art\ndensity functional theory combined with quantum transport, we show that the\nN\\'eel vector of the electrodes can be manipulated by spin-transfer torque.\nThis is staggered over the two different magnetic sublattices and can generate\ndynamics and switching. At the same time the different magnetization states of\nthe junction can be read by standard tunnelling magnetoresistance. Calculations\nare performed for CuMnAs$|$GaP$|$CuMnAs junctions with different surface\nterminations between the anti-ferromagnetic CuMnAs electrodes and the\ninsulating GaP spacer. In particular we find that the torque remains staggered\nregardless of the termination, while the magnetoresistance depends on the\nmicroscopic details of the interface.\n", "  Three Mo-based transition metal dichalcogenides MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$ and\nMoTe$_2$ share at ambient conditions the same structure 2H$_c$, consisting of\nlayers where Mo atoms are surrounded by six chalcogen atoms in trigonal prism\ncoordination. The knowledge of their high-pressure behaviour is, however,\nlimited, particularly in case of MoSe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$. The latter materials do\nnot undergo a layer-sliding transition 2H$_c$ $\\rightarrow$ 2H$_a$ known in\nMoS$_2$ and currently no other stable phase besides 2H$_c$ is known in these\nsystems at room temperature. Employing evolutionary crystal structure\nprediction in combination with \\textit{ab initio} calculations we study the\nzero-temperature phase diagram of both materials up to Mbar pressures. We find\na tetragonal phase with space group \\textit{P4/mmm}, previously predicted in\nMoS$_2$, to become stable in MoSe$_2$ at 118 GPa. In MoTe$_2$ we predict at 50\nGPa a transition to a new layered tetragonal structure with space group\n\\textit{I4/mmm}, similar to CaC$_2$, where Mo atoms are surrounded by eight Te\natoms. The phase is metallic already at the transition pressure and becomes a\ngood metal beyond 1 Mbar. We discuss chemical trends in the family of Mo-based\ntransition metal dichalcogenides and suggest that MoTe$_2$ likely offers the\neasiest route towards the post-2H phases.\n", "  In this series of papers we have presented the results of a spectroscopic\nsurvey of luminous and variable stars in the nearby spirals M31 and M33. In\nthis paper, we present spectroscopy of 132 additional luminous stars,\nvariables, and emission line objects. Most of the stars have emission line\nspectra, including LBVs and candidate LBVs, Fe II emission line stars and the\nB[e] supergiants, and the warm hypergiants. Many of these objects are\nspectroscopically similar and are often confused with each other. With this\nlarge spectroscopic data set including various types of emission line stars, we\nexamine their similarities and differences and propose the following criteria\nthat can be used to help distinguish these stars in future work: 1. The B[e]\nsupergiants have emission lines of [O I] and [Fe II] in their spectra. Most of\nthe spectroscopically confirmed sgB[e] stars also have warm circumstellar dust\nin their SEDs. 2. Confirmed LBVs do not have the [O I] emission lines in their\nspectra. Some LBVs have [Fe II] emission lines, but not all. Their SEDS shows\nfree-free emission in the near-infrared but no evidence for warm dust. Their\nmost important and defining characteristic is the S Dor-type variability. 3.\nThe warm hypergiants spectroscopically resemble both the LBVs in their eruption\nor dense wind state and the B[e] supergiants. However, they are very dusty.\nSome have [Fe II] and [O I] emission in their spectra like the sgB[e] stars,\nbut can be distinguished by their absorption line spectra characteristic of A\nand F-type supergiants. In contrast, the B[e] supergiant spectra have strong\ncontinua and few if any apparent absorption lines.\n", "  We study the sensitivities of the directed flow in Au+Au collisions on the\nequation of state (EoS), employing the transport theoretical model JAM. The EoS\nis modified by introducing a new collision term in order to control the\npressure of a system by appropriately selecting an azimuthal angle in two-body\ncollisions according to a given EoS. It is shown that this approach is an\nefficient method to modify the EoS in a transport model. The beam energy\ndependence of the directed flow of protons is examined with two different EoS,\na first-order phase transition and crossover. It is found that our approach\nyields quite similar results as hydrodynamical predictions on the beam energy\ndependence of the directed flow; Transport theory predicts a minimum in the\nexcitation function of the slope of proton directed flow and does indeed yield\nnegative directed flow, if the EoS with a first-order phase transition is\nemployed. Our result strongly suggests that the highest sensitivity for the\ncritical point can be seen in the beam energy range of $4.7\\leq\\srtNN\\leq11.5$\nGeV.\n", "  The supersymmetric (SUSY) minimal SO(10) model is a well-motivated grand\nunified theory, where the Standard Model (SM) fermions have Yukawa couplings\nwith only one ${\\bf 10}$-plet and one $\\overline{\\bf 126}$-plet Higgs fields\nand it is highly non-trivial if the realistic quark and lepton mass matrices\ncan be reproduced in this context. It has been known that the best fit for all\nthe SM fermion mass matrices is achieved by a vacuum expectation value of the\n$\\overline{\\bf 126}$-plet Higgs field being at the intermediate scale of around\n${\\cal O}(10^{13})$ GeV. Under the presence of the SO(10) symmetry breaking at\nthe intermediate scale, the successful SM gauge coupling unification is at risk\nand likely to be spoiled. Recently, it has been shown that the low-energy\nfermion mass matrices, except for the down-quark mass predicted to be too low,\nare very well-fitted without the intermediate scale. In order to resolve the\ntoo-low down quark mass while keeping the other fittings intact, we consider\nSUSY threshold corrections to reproduce the right down quark mass. It turns out\nthat this requires flavor-dependent soft parameters. Motivated by this fact, we\ncalculate particle mass spectra at low energies with flavor-dependent sfermion\nmasses at the grand unification scale. We present a benchmark particle mass\nspectrum which satisfies a variety of phenomenological constraints, in\nparticular, the observed SM-like Higgs boson mass of around 125 GeV and the\nrelic abundance of the neutralino dark matter as well as the experimental\nresult of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. In the resultant mass spectrum,\nsleptons in the first and second generations, bino and winos are all light, and\nthis scenario can be tested at the LHC Run-2 in the near future.\n", "  It is well known that in $b$ hadron decays with a single unreconstructible\nfinal state particle, the decay kinematics can be solved up to a quadratic\nambiguity, without any knowledge of the $b$ hadron momentum. We present a\nmethod to infer the momenta of $b$ hadrons produced in hadron collider\nexperiments using information from their reconstructed flight vectors. Our\nmethod is strictly agnostic to the decay itself, which implies that it can be\nvalidated with control samples of topologically similar decays to fully\nreconstructible final states. A multivariate regression algorithm based on the\nflight information provides a $b$ hadron momentum estimate with a resolution of\naround 60% which is sufficient to select the correct solution to the quadratic\nequation in around 70% of cases. This will improve the ability of hadron\ncollider experiments to make differential decay rate measurements with\nsemileptonic $b$ hadron decays.\n", "  We study the fermionic boundary modes (Andreev bound states) in a\ntime-reversal invariant one-dimensional superconductor. In the presence of a\nsubstrate, spatial inversion symmetry is broken and the electronic properties\nare strongly affected by an antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling. We assume an\narbitrary even number of nondegenerate bands crossing the Fermi level. We show\nthat there is only one possible pairing symmetry in one dimension, an analog of\ns-wave pairing. The zero-energy Andreev bound states are present if the sign of\nthe gap function in an odd number of bands is different from all other bands.\n", "  We have monitored the Cassiopeia dwarf galaxy (IC 10) in a series of 10\nChandra ACIS-S observations to capture its variable and transient X-ray source\npopulation, which is expected to be dominated by High Mass X-ray Binaries\n(HMXBs). We present a sample of 21 X-ray sources that are variable between\nobservations at the 3 sigma level, from a catalog of 110 unique point sources.\nWe find 4 transients (flux variability ratio greater than 10) and a further 8\nobjects with ratio > 5. The observations span years 2003 - 2010 and reach a\nlimiting luminosity of >10$^{35}$ erg/s, providing sensitivity to X-ray\nbinaries in IC 10 as well as flare stars in the foreground Milky Way. The\nnature of the variable sources is investigated from light-curves, X-ray\nspectra, energy quantiles, and optical counterparts. The purpose of this study\nis to discover the composition of the X-ray binary population in a young\nstarburst environment. IC 10 provides a sharp contrast in stellar population\nage (<10 My) when compared to the Magellanic Clouds (40-200 My) where most of\nthe known HMXBs reside. We find 10 strong HMXB candidates, 2 probable\nbackground Active Galactic Nuclei, 4 foreground flare-stars or active binaries,\nand 5 not yet classifiable sources. Complete classification of the sample\nrequires optical spectroscopy for radial velocity analysis and deeper X-ray\nobservations to obtain higher S/N spectra and search for pulsations. A catalog\nand supporting dataset are provided.\n", "  The TaO$^+$ molecular ion is proposed as a candidate system for detecting\nsignatures of charge parity (${\\cal{CP}}$) violating physics beyond the\nstandard model of elementary particles. The electron electric dipole moment\n(EDM) effective electric field $E_{\\text{eff}} = 20.2 \\left[\\frac{\\rm GV}{\\rm\ncm}\\right]$, the nucleon-electron scalar-pseudoscalar (ne-SPS) interaction\nconstant $W_{S} = 17.7$ [kHz] and the nuclear magnetic quadrupole interaction\nconstant $W_M = 0.45$ [$\\frac{10^{33} {\\text{Hz}}}{e\\, {\\text{cm}}^2}$] are\nfound to be sizeable ${\\cal{P,T}}$-odd enhancements. The ratio of the leptonic\nand semi-leptonic enhancements differs strongly from the one for the ThO system\nwhich may provide improved limits on the electron EDM, $d_e$, and the SPS\ncoupling constant, $C_S$. TaO$^+$ is found to have a ${^3\\Delta_1}$ electronic\nground state like the previously proposed ThF$^+$ molecular ion, but an order\nof magnitude smaller parallel G-tensor component which makes it less vulnerable\nto systematic errors in experiment.\n", "  We study vacua and BPS spectra of canonical surface defects of class\n$\\mathcal{S}$ theories in different decoupling limits using ADE spectral\nnetworks. In some regions of the IR moduli spaces of these 2d-4d systems, the\nmixing between 2d and 4d BPS states is suppressed, and the spectrum of 2d-4d\nBPS states becomes that of a 2d $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theory. For some decoupling\nlimits, we identify the 2d theories describing the surface defects with\nnonlinear sigma models and coset models that have been previously studied. We\nalso study certain cases where the decoupling limit of a surface defect\nexhibits a set of vacua and a BPS spectrum that appear to be entirely new. A\ndetailed analysis of these spectra and their wall-crossing behavior is\nperformed.\n", "  The faintest ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), those with 0.3-10 keV\nluminosities 1 < L_X/10^39 < 3 erg s^-1, tend to have X-ray spectra that are\ndisk-like but broader than expected for thin accretion disks. These `broadened\ndisk' spectra are thought to indicate near- or mildly super-Eddington accretion\nonto stellar remnant black holes. Here we report that a sample of bright\nthermal-dominant black hole binaries, which have Eddington ratios constrained\nto moderate values, also show broadened disk spectra in the 0.3-10 keV band at\nan order of magnitude lower luminosities. This broadening would be missed in\nstudies that only look above ~2 keV. While this may suggest that broadened disk\nULXs could be powered by accretion onto massive stellar remnant black holes\nwith close to maximal spin, we argue in favor of a scenario where they are at\nclose to the Eddington luminosity, such that radiation pressure would be\nexpected to result in geometrically slim, advective accretion disks. However,\nthis implies that an additional physical mechanism is required to produce the\nobserved broad spectra at low Eddington ratios.\n", "  Collimated outflows (jets) appear to be a ubiquitous phenomenon associated\nwith the accretion of material onto a compact object. Despite this ubiquity,\nmany fundamental physics aspects of jets are still poorly understood and\nconstrained. These include the mechanism of launching and accelerating jets,\nthe connection between these processes and the nature of the accretion flow,\nand the role of magnetic fields; the physics responsible for the collimation of\njets over tens of thousands to even millions of gravitational radii of the\ncentral accreting object; the matter content of jets; the location of the\nregion(s) accelerating particles to TeV (possibly even PeV and EeV) energies\n(as evidenced by gamma-ray emission observed from many jet sources) and the\nphysical processes responsible for this particle acceleration; the radiative\nprocesses giving rise to the observed multi-wavelength emission; and the\ntopology of magnetic fields and their role in the jet collimation and particle\nacceleration processes. This chapter reviews the main knowns and unknowns in\nour current understanding of relativistic jets, in the context of the main\nmodel ingredients for Galactic and extragalactic jet sources. It discusses\naspects specific to active Galactic nuclei (especially blazars) and\nmicroquasars, and then presents a comparative discussion of similarities and\ndifferences between them.\n", "  We study possible smooth deformations of Generalized Free Conformal Field\nTheories in arbitrary dimensions by exploiting the singularity structure of the\nconformal blocks dictated by the null states. We derive in this way, at the\nfirst non trivial order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion, the anomalous dimensions\nof an infinite class of scalar local operators, without using the equations of\nmotion. In the cases where other computational methods apply, the results\nagree.\n", "  It is conceivable that the construction of the energy--momentum tensor (EMT)\nin lattice field theory enlarges our ability in lattice field theory and also\ndeepens our understanding on EMT at the non-pertubative level. In this talk, I\nwill review recent developments in this enterprise.\n", "  A detailed multi-epoch study of the broadband spectral behaviour of the very\nhigh energy (VHE) source, 1ES\\,1011+496, provides us with valuable information\nregarding the underlying particle distribution. Simultaneous observations of\nthe source at optical/ UV/ X-ray/ $\\gamma$-ray during three different epochs,\nas obtained from Swift-UVOT/ Swift-XRT/ Fermi-LAT, are supplemented with the\ninformation available from the VHE telescope array, HAGAR. The longterm flux\nvariability at the Fermi-LAT energies is clearly found to be lognormal. It is\nseen that the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of 1ES\\,1011+496 can\nbe successfully reproduced by synchrotron and synchrotron self Compton emission\nmodels. Notably, the observed curvature in the photon spectrum at X-ray\nenergies demands a smooth transition of the underlying particle distribution\nfrom a simple power law to a power law with an exponential cutoff or a smooth\nbroken power law distribution, which may possibly arise when the escape of the\nparticles from the main emission region is energy dependent. Specifically, if\nthe particle escape rate is related to its energy as $E^{0.5}$ then the\nobserved photon spectrum is consistent with the ones observed during the\nvarious epochs.\n", "  A semiclassical theory is provided for the metastability regime-diagram of\natomtronic superfluid circuits. Such circuits typically exhibit\nhigh-dimensional chaos; and non-linear resonances that couple the Bogoliubov\nexcitations manifest themselves. Contrary to the expectation these resonances\ndo not originate from the familiar Beliaev and Landau damping terms. Rather,\nthey are described by a variant of the Cherry Hamiltonian of celestial\nmechanics. Consequently we study the induced decay process, and its dependence\non the number of sites and of condensed particles.\n", "  We observed thirteen Planck cold clumps with the James Clerk Maxwell\nTelescope/SCUBA-2 and with the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. The N$_2$H$^+$\ndistribution obtained with the Nobeyama telescope is quite similar to SCUBA-2\ndust distribution. The 82 GHz HC$_3$N, 82 GHz CCS, and 94 GHz CCS emission are\noften distributed differently with respect to the N$_2$H$^+$ emission. The CCS\nemission, which is known to be abundant in starless molecular cloud cores, is\noften very clumpy in the observed targets. We made deep single-pointing\nobservations in DNC, HN$^{13}$C, N$_2$D$^+$, cyclic-C$_3$H$_2$ toward nine\nclumps. The detection rate of N$_2$D$^+$ is 50\\%. Furthermore, we observed the\nNH$_3$ emission toward 15 Planck cold clumps to estimate the kinetic\ntemperature, and confirmed that most of targets are cold ($\\lesssim$ 20 K). In\ntwo of the starless clumps observe, the CCS emission is distributed as it\nsurrounds the N$_2$H$^+$ core (chemically evolved gas), which resembles the\ncase of L1544, a prestellar core showing collapse. In addition, we detected\nboth DNC and N$_2$D$^+$. These two clumps are most likely on the verge of star\nformation. We introduce the Chemical Evolution Factor (CEF) for starless cores\nto describe the chemical evolutionary stage, and analyze the observed Planck\ncold clumps.\n", "  Resonance plays critical roles in the formation of many physical phenomena,\nand many techniques have been developed for the exploration of resonance. In a\nrecent letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 062502 (2016)], we proposed a new method\nfor probing single-particle resonances by solving the Dirac equation in complex\nmomentum representation for spherical nuclei. Here, we extend this method to\ndeformed nuclei with theoretical formalism presented. We elaborate numerical\ndetails, and calculate the bound and resonant states in $^{37}$Mg. The results\nare compared with those from the coordinate representation calculations with a\nsatisfactory agreement. In particular, the present method can expose clearly\nthe resonant states in complex momentum plane and determine precisely the\nresonance parameters for not only narrow resonances but also broad resonances\nthat were difficult to obtain before.\n", "  We intent to use stellar models with and without alpha-enhancement, as well\nas asteroseismic analysis, to study two alpha-enhanced stars, KIC 7976303 and\nKIC 8694723. For the alpha-enhanced models, we adopt [alpha/Fe] = 0.2, and 0.4.\nFor the evolved sub-giant KIC 7976303 with mixed-modes, alpha-enhanced models\nfit the observations better than the models without alpha-enhancement, and\npoint to a star with M = 1.20 $\\pm$ 0.02 M_odot, t = 4.88 $\\pm$ 0.08 Gyr, R =\n2.04 $\\pm$ 0.01 R_odot, and L = 5.07 $\\pm$ 0.05 L_odot. For the post turnoff\nstar KIC 8694723, we find that the models fit the observations well in all\nthree cases ([alpha/Fe] = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4). According to the observed metal\nabundances, only alpha- enhanced models are used to estimate the stellar\nparameters, which are M = 1.13 $\\pm$ 0.06 M_odot, t = 5.47 $\\pm$ 0.43 Gyr, R =\n1.55 $\\pm$ 0.13 R_odot, and L = 3.18 $\\pm$ 0.26 L_odot. Our alpha-enhanced\nmodels indicate KIC 7976303 has a larger mass and younger age than in previous\nworks based on standard models. Furthermore, the differences of estimated mass\nand age between the three cases are $\\sim$ 0.1 M_odot and $\\sim$ 0.5 - 1.3 Gyr.\nThese results suggest that we include alpha-enhancement in the modeling of\nalpha-enhanced stars, such as members of GCs (Globular Clusters), metal-poor\nstars in the disc and in the halo.\n", "  We propose a method to test the effects of quantum fluctuations on black\nholes by analyzing the effects of thermal fluctuations on dumb holes, the\nanalogues for black holes. The proposal is based on the Jacobson formalism,\nwhere the Einstein field equations are viewed as thermodynamical relations, and\nso the quantum fluctuations are generated from the thermal fluctuations. It is\nwell known that all approaches to quantum gravity generate logarithmic\ncorrections to the entropy of a black hole and the coefficient of this term\nvaries according to the different approaches to the quantum gravity. It is\npossible to demonstrate that such logarithmic terms are also generated from\nthermal fluctuations in dumb holes. In this paper, we claim that it is possible\nto experimentally test such corrections for dumb holes, and also obtain the\ncorrect coefficient for them. This fact can then be used to predict the effects\nof quantum fluctuations on realistic black holes, and so it can also be used,\nin principle, to experimentally test the different approaches to quantum\ngravity.\n", "  Observations of solar wind turbulence indicate the existence of multi-scale\npressure-balanced structures (PBSs) in the solar wind. In this work, we conduct\na numerical simulation to investigate multi-scale PBSs and in particular their\nformation in compressive MHD turbulence. By the use of a higher order Godunov\ncode Athena,a driven compressible turbulence with an imposed uniform guide\nfield is simulated. The simulation results show that both the magnetic pressure\nand the thermal pressure exhibit a turbulent spectrum with a Kolmogorov-like\npower law, and that in many regions of the simulation domain they are\nanti-correlated. The computed wavelet cross-coherence spectrum of the magnetic\npressure and the thermal pressure, as well as their space series, indicate the\nexistence of multi-scale PBSs, with the small PBSs being embedded in the large\nones. These multi-scale PBSs are likely to be related with the highly\noblique-propagating slow-mode waves, as the traced multi-scale PBS is found to\nbe traveling in a certain direction at a speed consistent with that predicted\ntheoretically for a slow-mode wave propagating in the same direction.\n", "  Quantum entanglement is the characteristic quantum correlation. Here we use\nthis concept to analyze the quantum entanglement generated by Schwinger\nproduction of particle-antiparticle pairs in an electric field, as well as the\nchange of mode entanglement as a consequence of the electric field effect on an\nentangled pair of particles. The system is partitioned by using momentum modes.\nVarious kinds of pairwise mode entanglement are calculated as functions of the\nelectric field. Both constant and pulsed electric fields are considered. The\nuse of entanglement exposes information beyond that in particle number\ndistributions.\n", "  We present RCSED, the value-added Reference Catalog of Spectral Energy\nDistributions of galaxies, which contains homogenized spectrophotometric data\nfor 800,299 low and intermediate redshift galaxies (0.007<z<0.6) selected from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic sample. Accessible from the Virtual\nObservatory (VO) and complemented with detailed information on galaxy\nproperties obtained with the state-of-the-art data analysis, RCSED enables\ndirect studies of galaxy formation and evolution during the last 5Gyr. We\nprovide tabulated color transformations for galaxies of different morphologies\nand luminosities and analytic expressions for the red sequence shape in\ndifferent colors. RCSED comprises integrated k-corrected photometry in up-to 11\nultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared bands published by the GALEX, SDSS, and\nUKIDSS wide-field imaging surveys; results of the stellar population fitting of\nSDSS spectra including best-fitting templates, velocity dispersions,\nparameterized star formation histories, and stellar metallicities computed for\ninstantaneous starburst and exponentially declining star formation models;\nparametric and non-parametric emission line fluxes and profiles; and gas phase\nmetallicities. We link RCSED to the Galaxy Zoo morphological classification and\ngalaxy bulge+disk decomposition results by Simard et al. We construct the\ncolor-magnitude, Faber-Jackson, mass-metallicity relations, compare them with\nthe literature and discuss systematic errors of galaxy properties presented in\nour catalog. RCSED is accessible from the project web-site and via VO simple\nspectrum access and table access services using VO compliant applications. We\ndescribe several SQL query examples against the database. Finally, we briefly\ndiscuss existing and future scientific applications of RCSED and prospectives\nfor the catalog extension to higher redshifts and different wavelengths.\n", "  We examine conditions under which an open quantum system composed of a driven\ndegenerated parametric oscillator cavity and a driven two-level atom coupled to\na waveguide could decay to a pure dark state rather than the expected mixed\nstate. The calculations are carried out analytically in a low dimensional\nHilbert space truncated at the double-excitation states of the combined system.\nThe validity of the truncation is confirmed by the exact numerical analysis. It\nis found that one way to produce the pure state is to chirally couple the\ncavity and the atom to the waveguide. Another way to produce the pure state is\nto drive the cavity and the atom with unequal detunings. In both cases, if the\ndriving fields are weak, the produced state is a coherent superposition of only\nthe single-excitation and ground states of the combined system. In addition, we\nhave found a direct correspondence between the generation of the dark state and\nthe photon blockade effect. In other words, the generation of the dark state\nacts as a blockade to the number of photons so that only a single photon can be\npresent in the cavity. We investigate the normalized second-order correlation\nfunction of the cavity field and find that the conditions under which the\ncorrelation function vanishes coincide with the conditions for the creation of\nthe pure dark state. This system is, therefore, suggested as an alternative\nscheme for the generation of single-photon states.\n", "  The effect of turbulence on a pair of photons propagating together through\nthe same medium is analyzed. The behavior is compared to the case where these\nphotons propagate separately through different turbulent media. The analysis is\ndone with a multiple phase screen approach, by deriving and solving an\ninfinitesimal propagation equation. We apply these results to the case where\nthe initial photons are entangled in their spatial degrees of freedom with the\naid of spontaneous parametric down-conversion. It is found that for this input\nstate, the decay of entanglement in correlated media under the weak\nscintillation approximation is quicker than in uncorrelated media. Beyond the\nweak scintillation approximation, the entanglement in correlated media decays\nslower when it is close to zero --- approaching zero asymptotically as a\nfunction of scintillation strength. This is contrary to the case in\nuncorrelated media where entanglement becomes zero at a finite scintillation\nstrength.\n", "  The arrival of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will revitalise all aspects\nof Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astronomy at the lower frequencies.\nIn the last decade there have been huge strides towards routinely achieving\nhigh precision VLBI astrometry at frequencies dominated by the tropospheric\ncontributions, most notably at 22GHz, using advanced phase referencing\ntechniques. Nevertheless to increase the capability for high precision\nastrometric measurements at low radio frequencies (<8GHz) an effective\ncalibration strategy of the systematic ionospheric propagation effects that is\nwidely applicable is required. Observations at low frequencies are dominated by\ndistinct direction dependent ionospheric propagation errors, which place a very\ntight limit on the angular separation of a suitable phase referencing\ncalibrator.\n  The MultiView technique holds the key to the compensation of atmospheric\nspatial-structure errors, by using observations of multiple calibrators and 2-D\ninterpolation. In this paper we present the first demonstration of the power of\nMultiView using three calibrators, several degrees from the target, along with\na comparative study of the astrometric accuracy between MultiView and\nphase-referencing techniques.\n  MultiView calibration provides an order of magnitude improvement in\nastrometry with respect to conventional phase referencing, achieving ca. 100\nmicro-arcseconds astrometry errors in a single epoch of observations,\neffectively reaching the thermal noise limit.\n  MultiView will achieve its full potential with the enhanced sensitivity and\nmultibeam capabilities of SKA and the pathfinders, which will enable\nsimultaneous observations of the target and calibrators. Our demonstration\nindicates that the 10 micro-arcseconds goal of astrometry at ~1.6GHz using VLBI\nwith SKA is feasible using the MultiView technique.\n", "  It has been pointed out by various astronomers that very interesting\nrelationship exists between interstellar alcohols and the corresponding thiols\n(sulfur analogue of alcohols) as far as the spectroscopic properties and\nchemical abundances are concerned. Monohydric alcohols such as methanol and\nethanol are widely observed and 1-propanol is recently claimed to have been\nseen in Orion KL. Among the monohydric thiols, methanethiol (chemical analogue\nof methanol), has been firmly detected in Orion KL and Sgr B2(N2) and\nethanethiol (chemical analogue of ethanol) has been claimed to be observed in\nSgr B2(N2) though the confirmation of this detection is yet to come. It is very\nlikely that higher order thiols could be observed in these regions. In this\npaper, we study the formation of monohydric alcohols and their thiol analogues.\nBased on our quantum chemical calculation and chemical modeling, we find that\n`Tg' conformer of 1-propanethiol is a good candidate of astronomical interest.\nWe present various spectroscopically relevant parameters of this molecule to\nassist its future detection in the Interstellar medium (ISM).\n", "  We investigate spin effects in four-quark systems consisting of two heavy\nanti-bottom quarks and two light up/down quarks. To this end we use the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation. We utilize potentials of two static antiquarks\nin the presence of two quarks of finite mass computed via lattice QCD and solve\na coupled-channel Schr\\\"odinger equation for the anti-bottom-anti-bottom\nseparation. Without taking heavy quark spins into account this approach\npredicted a $u d \\bar b \\bar b$ tetraquark bound state with quantum numbers\n$I(J^P) = 0(1^+)$. We now extend this Born-Oppenheimer approach with coupled\nchannel Schr\\\"odinger equations allowing us to incorporate effects due to the\nheavy $\\bar b$ spins. We confirm the existence of the $u d \\bar b \\bar b$\ntetraquark.\n", "  A determination of the initial mass function (IMF) of the current, incomplete\ncensus of the 10 Myr-old TW Hya association (TWA) is presented. This census is\nbuilt from a literature compilation supplemented with new spectra and 17 new\nradial velocities, as well as a re-analysis of Hipparcos data that confirmed HR\n4334 (A2Vn) as a member. Though the dominant uncertainty in the IMF remains\ncensus incompleteness, a detailed statistical treatment is carried out to make\nthe IMF determination independent of binning, while accounting for small number\nstatistics. The currently known high-likelihood members are fitted by a\nlog-normal distribution with a central mass of $0.21^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$\n$M_{\\odot}$ and a characteristic width of $0.8^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ dex in the 12\n$M_{\\rm Jup}$-2 $M_{\\odot}$ range, whereas a Salpeter power law with $\\alpha =\n2.2^{+1.1}_{-0.5}$ best describes the IMF slope in the $0.1-2$ $M_{\\odot}$\nrange. This characteristic width is higher than other young associations, which\nmay be due to incompleteness in the current census of low-mass TWA stars. A\ntentative overpopulation of isolated planetary-mass members similar to 2MASS\nJ11472421-2040204 and 2MASS J11193254-1137466 is identified: this indicates\nthat there might be as many as $10^{+13}_{-5}$ similar members of TWA with\nhot-start model-dependent masses estimated at $\\sim$ 5-7 $M_{\\rm Jup}$, most of\nwhich would be too faint to be detected in 2MASS. Our new radial velocity\nmeasurements corroborate the membership of 2MASS J11472421-2040204, and secure\nTWA 28 (M8.5$\\gamma$), TWA 29 (M9.5$\\gamma$) and TWA 33 (M4.5e) as members. The\ndiscovery of 2MASS J09553336-0208403, a young L7-type interloper unrelated to\nTWA, is also presented.\n", "  We apply differential equations technique to the calculation of the one-loop\nmassless diagram with one offshell legs. Using reduction to $\\epsilon$-form, we\nmanaged to obtain a simple one-fold integral representation exact in space-time\ndimensionality. Expansion of the obtained result in $\\epsilon$ and analytical\ncontinuation to physical region are discussed.\n", "  Models and observations suggest that both power and effects of AGN feedback\nshould be maximised in hyper-luminous (L_Bol>10^47 erg/s) quasars, i.e. objects\nat the brightest end of the AGN luminosity function. We present the first\nresults of a multi-wavelength observing program, focusing on a sample of\nWISE/SDSS selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) broad-line quasars at z~1.5-5. The\nWISSH quasars project has been designed to reveal the most energetic AGN-driven\noutflows, estimate their occurrence at the peak of quasar activity and extend\nthe study of correlations between outflows and nuclear properties up to\npoorly-investigated extreme AGN luminosities (L_Bol~10^47 -10^48 erg/s). We\npresent NIR, long-slit LBT/LUCI1 spectroscopy of five WISSH quasars at\nz~2.3-3.5 showing prominent [OIII] emission lines with broad (FWHM~1200-2200\nkm/s) and skewed profiles. The luminosities of the broad [OIII] wings are the\nhighest measured so far (L_[OIII]^broad >~5x10^44 erg/s) and reveal the\npresence of powerful ionised outflows with mass outflow rates Mdot >~1700\nM_Sun/yr and kinetic powers Edot >~10^45 erg/s. Although these estimates are\naffected by large uncertainties, due to the use of [OIII] as tracer of ionized\noutflows and the very basic outflow model we assume, these results suggest that\nthe AGN is highly efficient in pushing outwards large amounts of ionised gas in\nour targets. The mechanical outflow luminosities for WISSH quasars correspond\nto higher fractions (~1-3%) of L_Bol than those derived for lower L_Bol AGN.\nOur targets host very massive (M_BH>~2x10^9 M_Sun) black holes which are still\naccreting at a high rate (i.e. a factor of ~0.4-3 of the Eddington limit).\nThese findings demonstrate that WISSH quasars offer the opportunity of probing\nthe extreme end of both luminosity and SMBH mass functions and revealing\npowerful ionised outflows able to affect the evolution of their host galaxies.\n", "  The global evolution of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) has recently been shown\nto be largely controlled by the amount of poloidal magnetic flux threading the\ndisk, which is further controlled by the poorly understood process of magnetic\nflux transport. In weakly ionized gas as in PPDs, magnetic flux is largely\nfrozen in the electron fluid, except when resistivity is large. When the disk\nis largely laminar, we show that the relative drift between the electrons and\nions (the Hall-drift), and the ions and neutral fluids (ambipolar-drift) can\nplay a dominant role on the transport of magnetic flux. Using two-dimensional\nsimulations that incorporate the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD) with\nprescribed diffusivities, we show that when large-scale poloidal field is\naligned with disk rotation, the Hall effect rapidly drags magnetic flux inward\nat the midplane region, while it slowly pushes flux outward above/below the\nmidplane. This leads to a highly radially elongated field configuration as a\nglobal manifestation of the Hall-shear instability. This field configuration\nfurther promotes rapid outward flux transport by AD at the midplane, leading to\ninstability saturation. In quasi-steady state, magnetic flux is transported\noutward at approximately the same rate at all heights, and the rate is\ncomparable to the Hall-free case. For anti-aligned field polarity, the Hall\neffect consistently transports magnetic flux outward, leading to a largely\nvertical field configuration in the midplane region. The field lines in the\nupper layer first bend radially inward and then outward to launch a disk wind.\nOverall, the net rate of outward flux transport is about twice faster than the\naligned case. In addition, the rate of flux transport increases with increasing\ndisk magnetization. The absolute rate of transport is sensitive to disk\nmicrophysics which remains to be explored in future studies.\n", "  We employ optical photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy to study a\nfield toward the open cluster Tombaugh 1, where we identify a complex\npopulation mixture, that we describe in terms of young and old Galactic thin\ndisk. Of particular interest is the spatial distribution of the young\npopulation, which consists of dwarfs with spectral type as early as B6, and\ndistribute in a {\\it blue plume} feature in the colour-magnitude diagram. For\nthe first time we confirm spectroscopically that most of these stars are early\ntype stars, and not blue stragglers nor halo/thick disk sub-dwarfs. Moreover,\nthey are not evenly distributed along the line of sight, but crowd at\nheliocentric distances between 6.6 and 8.2 kpc. We compare these results with\npresent-day understanding of the spiral structure of the Galaxy and suggest\nthat they traces the outer arm. This range in distances challenges current\nGalactic models adopting a disk cut-off at 14 kpc from the Galactic center. The\nyoung dwarfs overlap in space with an older component which identifies the old\nGalactic thin disk. Both young and old populations are confined in space since\nthe disk is warped at the latitude and longitude of Tombaugh~1. The main\neffects of the warp are that the line of sight intersects the disk and entirely\ncrosses it at the outer arm distance, and that there are no traces of the\ncloser Perseus arm, which would then be either un-important in this sector, or\nlocated much closer to the formal Galactic plane. We finally analysed a group\nof giant stars, which turn out to be located at very different distances, and\nto possess very different chemical properties, with no obvious relation with\nthe other populations.\n", "  We show that the linearized higher derivative gravitational field equations\nare equivalent to an equilibrium condition on the entanglement entropy of small\nspherical regions in vacuum. This extends Jacobson's recent derivation of the\nEinstein equation using entanglement to include general higher derivative\ncorrections. The corrections are naturally associated with the subleading\ndivergences in the entanglement entropy, which take the form of a Wald entropy\nevaluated on the entangling surface. Variations of this Wald entropy are\nrelated to the field equations through an identity for causal diamonds in\nmaximally symmetric spacetimes, which we derive for arbitrary higher derivative\ntheories. If the variations are taken holding fixed a geometric functional that\nwe call the generalized volume, the identity becomes an equivalence between the\nlinearized constraints and the entanglement equilibrium condition. We note that\nthe fully nonlinear higher curvature equations cannot be derived from the\nlinearized equations applied to small balls, in contrast to the situation\nencountered in Einstein gravity. The generalized volume is a novel result of\nthis work, and we speculate on its thermodynamic role in the first law of\ncausal diamond mechanics, as well as its possible application to holographic\ncomplexity.\n", "  In curved space time inside the shell of TeV black holes, many gluons and\nquarks produce due to Unruh effect, interact with each other and create Higgs\nboson. Studying the Unruh effect, we show that the inside state of the black\nhole for gluons and quarks can be represented by a maximally entangled two mode\nsqueezed state of inside and matter Hilbert spaces of black hole. Comparing the\nHiggs boson production outside and inside the shell, we observe that at lower\nmass, MBH<4 TeV, and at higher mass, MBH>9 TeV, the Higgs boson will not be\nproduced outside the shell of black hole. However this particle can be produced\ninside the shell for 2.5 TeV<MBH<12.5 TeV. We find that the outside the shell\nof black hole is able to produce a quark for 3 TeV<MBH<10 TeV and eventually\nfor MBH<3 TeV and MBH> 12.5 TeV the black hole can only emit massless gluons.\nHowever, inside the shell of black hole is able to produce a quark for 2.5\nTeV<MBH<14 TeV. We also find that the micro black hole can be a source for\nHiggs production at LHC. Finally we calculate the effects of Higgs boson\nradiation due to inside the shell and outside the shell of mini black holes on\nhadronic cross section at LHC. We observe that as the order of perturbation\ntheory increases, this effect becomes systematically more effective because at\nhigher orders there exists more channels for Higgs production and their decay\nof Higgs into massive quark-anti quarks in our calculation. At smaller mass,\nMBH<2 TeV, the NNLO contribution is large while the cross sections at NLO and\nat LO are rising and respectively exhibit a turn-over at moderate values of\nblack hole's mass.The peak moves from about 5 TeV to 2.5 TeV. It is concluded\nthat the processes of hadronization inside the event horizon of mini black\nholes are affected the hadronic cross section outside the event horizon and can\nbe observed at LHC.\n", "  We consider charge transport properties in realistic, fabricable,\nFerromagnet/Superconductor spin valves having a layered structure\n$F_1/N/F_2/S$, where $F_1$ and $F_2$ denote the ferromagnets, $S$ the\nsuperconductor, and $N$ the normal metal spacer usually inserted in actual\ndevices. Our calculation is fully self-consistent, as required to ensure that\nconservation laws are satisfied. We include the effects of scattering at all\nthe interfaces. We obtain results for the device conductance $G$, as a function\nof bias voltage, for all values of the angle $\\phi$ between the magnetizations\nof the $F_1$ and $F_2$ layers and a range of realistic values for the material\nand geometrical parameters in the sample. We discuss, in the context of our\nresults for $G$, the relative influence of all parameters on the spin valve\nproperties. We study also the spin current and the corresponding spin transfer\ntorque in $F_1/F_2/S$ structures.\n", "  Using our formalism of parton virtuality distribution functions (VDFs) we\nestablish a connection between the transverse momentum dependent distributions\n(TMDs) ${\\cal F} (x, k_\\perp^2)$ and quasi-distributions $Q(y,P_z)$ introduced\nrecently by X. Ji for lattice QCD extraction of parton distributions $f(x)$. We\nbuild models for PQDs from the VDF-based models for soft TMDs, and analyze the\n$P_z$ dependence of the resulting PQDs. We observe a strong nonperturbative\nevolution of PQDs for small and moderately large values of $P_z$ reflecting the\ntransverse momentum dependence of TMDs. Thus, the study of PQDs on the lattice\nin the domain of strong nonperturbative effects opens a new perspective for\ninvestigation of the 3-dimensional hadron structure.\n", "  The precise determination of astrophysical S-factors is essential for a\ndetailed understanding of the nucleosynthesis in its various facets. It is\ndiscussed how the Lorentz integral transform (LIT) method can be applied for\nsuch a determination. The astrophysical S-factor for the proton-deuteron\nradiative capture is considered as test case. The importance of a specific\nmany-body basis used for the LIT equation solution is pointed out. The\nexcellent results of the test are discussed.\n", "  We report an alternative mechanism for the physical origin of the\ntemperature-dependent ferromagnetic relaxation of Permalloy (NiFe) thin films.\nThrough spin-pumping experiments, we demonstrate that the peak in the\ntemperature-dependence of NiFe damping can be understood in terms of enhanced\nspin angular momentum absorption at the magnetic phase transition in\nantiferromagnetic surface-oxidized layers. These results suggest new avenues\nfor the investigation of an incompletely-understood phenomenon in physics.\n", "  We present 29 likely members of the young $\\rho$ Oph or Upper Sco regions of\nrecent star formation that exhibit \"accretion burst\" type light curves in $K2$\ntime series photometry. The bursters were identified by visual examination of\ntheir ~80 day light curves, though all satisfy the $M < -0.25$ flux asymmetry\ncriterion for burst behavior defined by Cody et al. (2014). The burst sources\nrepresent $\\approx$9% of cluster members with strong infrared excess indicative\nof circumstellar material. Higher amplitude burster behavior is correlated with\nlarger inner disk infrared excesses, as inferred from $WISE$ $W1-W2$ color. The\nburst sources are also outliers in their large H$\\alpha$ emission equivalent\nwidths. No distinction between bursters and non-bursters is seen in stellar\nproperties such as multiplicity or spectral type. The frequency of bursters is\nsimilar between the younger, more compact $\\rho$ Oph region, and the older,\nmore dispersed Upper Sco region. The bursts exhibit a range of shapes,\namplitudes (~10-700%), durations (~1-10 days), repeat time scales (~3-80 days),\nand duty cycles (~10-100%). Our results provide important input to models of\nmagnetospheric accretion, in particular by elucidating the properties of\naccretion-related variability in the low state between major longer duration\nevents such as EX Lup and FU Ori type accretion outbursts. We demonstrate the\nbroad continuum of accretion burst behavior in young stars -- extending the\nphenomenon to lower amplitudes and shorter timescales than traditionally\nconsidered in the theory of pre-main sequence accretion history.\n", "  We use N-body chemo-dynamic simulations to study the coupling between\nmorphology, kinematics and metallicity of the bar/bulge region of our Galaxy.\nWe make qualitative comparisons of our results with available observations and\nfind very good agreement. We conclude that this region is complex, since it\ncomprises several stellar components with different properties -- i.e. a\nboxy/peanut bulge, thin and thick disc components, and, to lesser extents, a\ndisky pseudobulge, a stellar halo and a small classical bulge -- all cohabiting\nin dynamical equilibrium. Our models show strong links between kinematics and\nmetallicity, or morphology and metallicity, as already suggested by a number of\nrecent observations. We discuss and explain these links.\n", "  The solar photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun, where many bright\ngranules, surrounded by narrow dark intergranular lanes, are observed\neverywhere. The granular pattern is a manifestation of convective motion at the\nphotospheric level, but its velocity structure in the height direction is\npoorly understood observationally. Applying bisector analysis to a photospheric\nspectral line recorded by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope, we derived the\nvelocity structure of the convective motion in granular regions and\nintergranular lanes separately. The amplitude of motion of the convective\nmaterial decreases from 0.65 to 0.40 km/s as the material rises in granules,\nwhereas the amplitude of motion increases from 0.30 to 0.50 km/s as it descends\nin intergranular lanes. These values are significantly larger than those\nobtained in previous studies using bisector analysis. The acceleration of\ndescending materials with depth is not predicted from the convectively stable\ncondition in a stratified atmosphere. Such convective instability can be\ndeveloped more efficiently by radiative cooling and/or a gas pressure gradient,\nwhich can control the dynamical behavior of convective material in\nintergranular lanes. Our analysis demonstrated that bisector analysis is a\nuseful method for investigating the long-term dynamic behavior of convective\nmaterial when a large number of pixels is available. In addition, one example\nis the temporal evolution of granular fragmentation, in which downflowing\nmaterial develops gradually from a higher layer downward.\n", "  Several high-resolution spectroscopic studies have provided compelling\nobservational evidence that open clusters display a decreasing trend of their\nbarium abundances as a function of the cluster's age. Young clusters (ages~200\nMyr) exhibit significant enhancement in the [Ba/Fe] ratios, at variance with\nsolar-age clusters where the Ba content has been found to be [Ba/Fe]~0 dex.\nDifferent viable solutions have been suggested in the literature, nevertheless,\na conclusive interpretation of such a peculiar trend has not been found.\nInterestingly, it is debated whether the other species produced with Ba via\ns-process reactions do follow the same trend with age. Pre-main sequence\nclusters (~10-50 Myr) show the most extreme behaviour in this respect: their\n[Ba/Fe] ratios can reach 0.65 dex, which higher than the solar value by a\nfactor of four. Crucially, there are no investigations of the other s-process\nspecies for these young stellar populations. In this paper we present, the\nfirst determination of Y, Zr, La, and Ce in clusters IC 2391, IC 2602 and the\nArgus association. The main objective of our work is to ascertain whether these\nelements reveal the same enhancement as Ba. Our results indicate that, at\nvariance with Ba, all the other s-process species exhibit a solar scaled\npattern: these clusters confirm a similar trend discovered in the slightly\nolder local associations (e.g., AB Doradus, Carina Near), where only Ba exhibit\nenhanced value with all other s process species being solar. We have discussed\nseveral possible explanations such as e.g., chromospheric effects, departures\nfrom the LTE approximation, or the activation of a different nucleosynthesis\nchain. We cannot currently provide the definite answer to this question and\nfuture investigations from theoretical and observational perspectives are\nsorely needed.\n", "  Rare leptonic kaon and pion decays $K^+(\\pi^+) \\to \\mu^+\\, \\nu_{\\mu}\\, e^+\ne^-$ can be used to probe a dark photon of mass ${\\cal O}(10)$~MeV, with the\nbackground coming from the mediation of a virtual photon. This is most relevant\nfor the 16.7-MeV dark photon proposed to explain a 6.8$\\sigma$ anomaly recently\nobserved in $^8$Be transitions by the Atomki Collaboration. We evaluate the\nreach of future experiments for different scenarios of how the dark photon\ncouples with the standard model particles, and show that a great portion of the\npreferred 16.7-MeV dark photon parameter space can be decisively probed. We\nalso show the use of angular distributions to further distinguish the signal\nfrom the background.\n", "  Considering about seven years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, we\npresent a systematic search for variability possibly related to transitions\nbetween states in redbacks and black widow systems. Transitions are\ncharacterized by sudden and significant changes in the gamma-ray flux that\npersist on a timescale much larger than the orbital period. This phenomenology\nwas already detected in the case of two redback systems, PSR J1023+0038 and PSR\nJ1227-4853, for which we present here a dedicated study. We show the existence\nof only one transition for each of these systems over the past seven years. We\ndetermine their spectra, establishing high-energy cutoffs at a few GeV for the\nhigh gamma-ray state of PSR J1023+0038 and for both states of PSR J1227-4853.\nThe surveying capability of the Fermi-LAT allows studying whether similar\nphenomenology has occurred in other sources. Although we have not found any\nhint for a state transition for most of the studied pulsars, we note two\nblack-widow systems, PSR J2234+0944 and PSR J1446-4701, whose apparent\nvariability is reminiscent of the transitions in PSR J1023+0038 and PSR\nJ1227-4853. For the other systems we set limits on potential transitions in\ntheir measured gamma-ray light curves.\n", "  We present NLO electroweak corrections to Higgs production in association\nwith off-shell top-antitop quark pairs. The full process\n$\\text{p}\\text{p}\\to\\text{e}^+\\nu_{\\text{e}}\n\\mu^-\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu\\text{b}\\bar{\\text{b}} \\text{H}$ is considered, and hence all\ninterference, off-shell, and non-resonant contributions are taken into account.\nThe electroweak corrections turn out to be below one per cent for the\nintegrated cross section but can exceed $10\\%$ in certain phase-space regions.\nIn addition to its phenomenological relevance, the computation constitutes a\nmajor technical achievement as the full NLO virtual corrections involving up to\n9-point functions have been computed exactly. The results of the full\ncomputation are supported by two calculations in the double-pole approximation.\nThese also allow to infer the effect of off-shell contributions and emphasise\ntheir importance especially for the run II of the LHC. Finally, we present\ncombined predictions featuring both NLO electroweak and QCD corrections in a\ncommon set-up that will help the experimental collaborations in their quest of\nprecisely measuring the aforementioned process.\n", "  Near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 1566 Icarus ($a=1.08$ au, $e=0.83$,\n$i=22.8^{\\circ}$) made a close approach to Earth in June 2015 at 22 lunar\ndistances (LD). Its detection during the 1968 approach (16 LD) was the first in\nthe history of asteroid radar astronomy. A subsequent approach in 1996 (40 LD)\ndid not yield radar images. We describe analyses of our 2015 radar observations\nof Icarus obtained at the Arecibo Observatory and the DSS-14 antenna at\nGoldstone. These data show that the asteroid is a moderately flattened spheroid\nwith an equivalent diameter of 1.44 km with 18% uncertainties, resolving\nlong-standing questions about the asteroid size. We also solve for Icarus' spin\naxis orientation ($\\lambda=270^{\\circ}\\pm10^{\\circ},\n\\beta=-81^{\\circ}\\pm10^{\\circ}$), which is not consistent with the estimates\nbased on the 1968 lightcurve observations. Icarus has a strongly specular\nscattering behavior, among the highest ever measured in asteroid radar\nobservations, and a radar albedo of $\\sim$2\\%, among the lowest ever measured\nin asteroid radar observations. The low cross-section suggests a high-porosity\nsurface, presumably related to Icarus' cratering, spin, and thermal histories.\nFinally, we present the first use of our orbit determination software for the\ngeneration of observational ephemerides, and we demonstrate its ability to\ndetermine subtle perturbations on NEA orbits by measuring Icarus'\norbit-averaged drift in semi-major axis ($(-4.62\\pm0.48) \\times 10^{-4}$ au/My,\nor $\\sim$60 m per revolution). Our Yarkovsky rate measurement resolves a\ndiscrepancy between two published rates that did not include the 2015 radar\nastrometry.\n", "  Bright small-scale magnetic elements found mainly in intergranular lanes at\nthe solar surface are named bright points (BPs). They show high contrasts in\nFraunhofer G-band observations and are described by nearly vertical slender\nflux tubes or sheets. A recent comparison between BP observations in the\nultraviolet (UV) and visible spectral range recorded with the balloon-borne\nobservatory SUNRISE and state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)\nsimulations revealed a kiloGauss magnetic field for 98% of the synthetic BPs.\nHere we address the opposite question, namely which fraction of pixels hosting\nkiloGauss fields coincides with an enhanced G-band brightness. We carried out\n3D radiation MHD simulations for three magnetic activity levels (corresponding\nto the quiet Sun, weak and strong plage) and performed a full spectral line\nsynthesis in the G-band. Only 7% of the kiloGauss pixels in our quiet-Sun\nsimulation coincide with a brightness lower than the mean quiet-Sun intensity,\nwhile 23% of the pixels in the weak-plage simulation and even 49% in the\nstrong-plage simulation are associated with a local darkening. Dark\nstrong-field regions are preferentially found in the cores of larger flux\npatches that are rare in the quiet Sun, but more common in plage regions, often\nin the vertices of granulation cells. The significant brightness shortfall in\nthe core of larger flux patches coincide with a slight magnetic field\nweakening. KiloGauss elements in the quiet Sun are on average brighter than\nsimilar features in plage regions. Almost all strong-field pixels display a\nmore or less vertical magnetic field orientation. Hence in the quiet Sun,\nG-band BPs correspond almost one-to-one with kiloGauss elements. In weak plage\nthe correspondence is still very good, but not perfect.\n", "  The inference of correlated signal fields with unknown correlation structures\nis of high scientific and technological relevance, but poses significant\nconceptual and numerical challenges. To address these, we develop the\ncorrelated signal inference (CSI) algorithm within information field theory\n(IFT) and discuss its numerical implementation. To this end, we introduce the\nfree energy exploration (FrEE) strategy for numerical information field theory\n(NIFTy) applications. The FrEE strategy is to let the mathematical structure of\nthe inference problem determine the dynamics of the numerical solver. FrEE uses\nthe Gibbs free energy formalism for all involved unknown fields and correlation\nstructures without marginalization of nuisance quantities. It thereby avoids\nthe complexity marginalization often impose to IFT equations. FrEE\nsimultaneously solves for the mean and the uncertainties of signal, nuisance,\nand auxiliary fields, while exploiting any analytically calculable quantity.\nFinally, FrEE uses a problem specific and self-tuning exploration strategy to\nswiftly identify the optimal field estimates as well as their uncertainty maps.\nFor all estimated fields, properly weighted posterior samples drawn from their\nexact, fully non-Gaussian distributions can be generated. Here, we develop the\nFrEE strategies for the CSI of a normal, a log-normal, and a Poisson log-normal\nIFT signal inference problem and demonstrate their performances via their NIFTy\nimplementations.\n", "  Several new families of exact solution to the Einstein-Maxwell system of\ndifferential equations are found for anisotropic charged matter. The spacetime\ngeometry is that of Finch and Skea which satisfies all criteria for physical\nacceptability. The exact solutions can be expressed in terms of elementary\nfunctions, Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions. When a parameter is\nrestricted to be an integer then the special functions reduce to simple\nelementary functions. The uncharged model of Finch and Skea (Class. Quantum\nGrav. 6, 467 (1989)) and the charged model of Hansraj and Maharaj (Int. J. Mod.\nPhys. D 8, 1311 (2006)) are regained as special cases. The solutions found\nadmit a barotropic equation of state. A graphical analysis indicates that the\nmatter and electric quantities are well behaved.\n", "  The impact cratering record of the Moon and the terrestrial planets provides\nimportant clues about the formation and evolution of the Solar System.\nEspecially intriguing is the epoch 3.8-3.9 Gyr ago (Ga), known as the Late\nHeavy Bombardment (LHB), when the youngest lunar basins such as Imbrium and\nOrientale formed. The LHB was suggested to originate from a slowly declining\nimpactor flux or from a late dynamical instability. Here we develop a model for\nthe historical flux of large asteroid impacts and discuss how it depends on\nvarious parameters, including the time and nature of the planetary\nmigration/instability. We find that the asteroid impact flux dropped by 1 to 2\norders of magnitude during the first 1 Gyr and remained relatively unchanged\nover the last 3 Gyr. The early impacts were produced by asteroids whose orbits\nbecame excited during the planetary migration/instability, and by those\noriginating from the inner extension of the main belt (E-belt; semimajor axis\n1.6<a<2.1 au). The profiles obtained for the early and late versions of the\nplanetary instability initially differ, but end up being similar after ~3 Ga.\nThus, the time of the instability can only be determined by considering the\ncratering and other constraints during the first ~1.5 Gyr of the Solar System\nhistory. Our absolute calibration of the impact flux indicates that asteroids\nwere probably not responsible for the LHB, independently of whether the\ninstability happened early or late, because the calibrated flux is not large\nenough to explain Imbrium/Orientale and a significant share of large lunar\ncraters. Comets and leftovers of the terrestrial planet formation provided\nadditional, and probably dominant source of impacts during early epochs.\n", "  A cancellation of conformal anomalies in d=4 for the $C^2+\\bar C^2$ and of\nchiral anomalies for the $C^2-\\bar C^2$ is known in N-extended supergravities\nwith $N \\geq 5$. We propose an explanation of these cancellations using\nsupersymmetry and dimension of linearized chiral superfields. We contrast these\nmodels with the ones with $N < 5$, where both types of anomalies are known to\nbe present.\n", "  A number of X-ray binaries exhibit clear evidence for the presence of disk\nwinds in the high/soft state. A promising driving mechanism for these outflows\nis mass loss driven by the thermal expansion of X-ray heated material in the\nouter disk atmosphere. Higginbottom \\& Proga recently demonstrated that the\nproperties of thermally-driven winds depend critically on the shape of the\nthermal equilibrium curve, since this determines the thermal stability of the\nirradiated material. For a given spectral energy distribution, the thermal\nequilibrium curve depends on exact balance between the various heating and\ncooling mechanisms at work. Most previous work on thermally-driven disk winds\nrelied an analytical approximation to these rates. Here, we use the\nphotoionization code \\textsc{cloudy} to generate realistic heating and cooling\nrates which we then use in a 2.5D hydrodynamic model computed in ZEUS to\nsimulate thermal winds in a typical black-hole X-ray binary. We find that these\nheating and cooling rates produce a significantly more complex thermal\nequilibrium curve, with dramatically different stability properties. The\nresulting flow, calculated in the optically thin limit, is qualitatively\ndifferent from flows calculated using approximate analytical rates.\nSpecifically, our thermal disk wind is much denser and slower, with a mass-loss\nrate that is a factor of two higher and characteristic velocities that are a\nfactor of three lower. The low velocity of the flow -- $v_{max} \\simeq\n200$~km~s$^{-1}$ -- may be difficult to reconcile with observations. However,\nthe high mass-loss rate -- 15$\\times$ the accretion rate -- is promising, since\nit has the potential to destabilize the disk. Thermally-driven disk winds may\ntherefore provide a mechanism for state changes.\n", "  The behavior of the axial group speeds of trapped sausage modes plays an\nimportant role in determining impulsively generated wave trains, which have\noften been invoked to account for quasi-periodic signals with quasi-periods of\norder seconds in a considerable number of coronal structures. We conduct a\ncomprehensive eigenmode analysis, both analytically and numerically, on the\ndispersive properties of sausage modes in pressureless tubes with three\nfamilies of continuous radial density profiles. We find a rich variety of the\ndependence on the axial wavenumber $k$ of the axial group speed $v_{\\rm gr}$.\nDepending on the density contrast and profile steepness as well as on the\ndetailed profile description, the $v_{\\rm gr}-k$ curves either possess or do\nnot possess cutoff wavenumbers, and they can behave in either a monotonical or\nnon-monotonical manner. With time-dependent simulations, we further show that\nthis rich variety of the group speed characteristics heavily influences the\ntemporal evolution and Morlet spectra of impulsively generated wave trains. In\nparticular, the Morlet spectra can look substantially different from \"crazy\ntadpoles\" found for the much-studied discontinuous density profiles. We\nconclude that it is necessary to re-examine available high-cadence data to look\nfor the rich set of temporal and spectral features, which can be employed to\ndiscriminate between the unknown forms of the density distributions transverse\nto coronal structures.\n", "  MassSpec, a method for determining the mass of a transiting exoplanet from\nits transmission spectrum alone, was proposed by \\citet{dew13}. The premise of\nthis method relies on the planet's surface gravity being extracted from the\ntransmission spectrum via its effect on the atmospheric scale height, which in\nturn determines the strength of absorption features. Here, we further explore\nthe applicability of \\textit{MassSpec} to low-mass exoplanets -- specifically\nthose in the super-Earth size range for which radial velocity determinations of\nthe planetary mass can be extremely challenging and resource intensive.\nDetermining the masses of these planets is of the utmost importance because\ntheir nature is otherwise highly unconstrained. Without knowledge of the mass,\nthese planets could be rocky, icy, or gas-dominated. To investigate the effects\nof planetary mass on transmission spectra, we present simulated observations of\nsuper-Earths with atmospheres made up of mixtures of H$_2$O and H$_2$, both\nwith and without clouds. We model their transmission spectra and run\nsimulations of each planet as it would be observed with \\textit{JWST} using the\nNIRISS, NIRSpec, and MIRI instruments. We find that significant degeneracies\nexist between transmission spectra of planets with different masses and\ncompositions, making it impossible to unambiguously determine the planet's mass\nin many cases.\n", "  A quantum-feedback-based scheme is proposed for generating multipartite\nentanglements of Rydberg atoms in a dissipative optical cavity. The Rydberg\nblockade mechanism efficiently prevents double excitations of the system, which\nis further exploited to speed up the stabilization of an entangled state with a\nsingle Rydberg state excitation. The corresponding feedback operations are\ngreatly simplified, since only one regular atom needs to be controlled during\nthe whole process, irrespective of the number of particles. The form of\nentangled state is also adjustable via regulating the Rabi frequencies of\ndriving fields. Moreover, a relatively long-life time of the high-lying Rydberg\nlevel guarantees a high fidelity in a realistic situation.\n", "  Coronal disturbances associated with solar flares, such as H$\\alpha$ Moreton\nwaves, X-ray waves, and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) coronal waves are discussed\nherein in relation to magnetohydrodynamics fast-mode waves or shocks in the\ncorona. To understand the mechanism of coronal disturbances, full-disk solar\nobservations with high spatial and temporal resolution over multiple\nwavelengths are of crucial importance. We observed a filament eruption, whose\nshape is like a \"dandelion\", associated with the M1.6 flare that occurred on\n2011 February 16 in the H$\\alpha$ images taken by the Flare Monitoring\nTelescope at Ica University, Peru. We derive the three-dimensional velocity\nfield of the erupting filament. We also identify winking filaments that are\nlocated far from the flare site in the H$\\alpha$ images, whereas no Moreton\nwave is observed. By comparing the temporal evolution of the winking filaments\nwith those of the coronal wave seen in the extreme ultraviolet images data\ntaken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the {\\it Solar Dynamics\nObservatory} and by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the {\\it Solar\nTerrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead}, we confirm that the winking filaments\nwere activated by the EUV coronal wave.\n", "  We present an observational study of the effect of bars on the gas component\nand on the star formation properties of their host galaxies in a statistically\nsignificant sample of resolved objects, the $Herschel$ Reference Sample. The\nanalysis of optical and far--infrared images allows us to identify a clear\nspatial correlation between stellar bars and the cold-gas distribution mapped\nby the warm dust emission. We find that the infrared counterparts of optically\nidentified bars are either bar--like structures or dead central regions in\nwhich star formation is strongly suppressed. Similar morphologies are found in\nthe distribution of star formation directly traced by H$\\alpha$ maps. The sizes\nof such optical and infrared structures correlate remarkably well, hinting at a\ncausal connection. In the light of previous observations and of theoretical\ninvestigations in the literature, we interpret our findings as further evidence\nof the scenario in which bars drive strong inflows toward their host nuclei:\nyoung bars are still in the process of perturbing the gas and star formation\nclearly delineates the shape of the bars; old bars on the contrary already\nremoved any gas within their extents, carving a dead region of negligible star\nformation.\n", "  AST3-1 is the second-generation wide-field optical photometric telescope\ndedicated to time domain astronomy at Dome A, Antarctica. Here we present the\nresults of $i$ band images survey from AST3-1 towards one Galactic disk field.\nBased on time-series photometry of 92,583 stars, 560 variable stars were\ndetected with $i$ magnitude $\\leq$ 16.5 mag during eight days of observations;\n339 of these are previously unknown variables. We tentatively classify the 560\nvariables as 285 eclipsing binaries (EW, EB, EA), 27 pulsating variable stars\n($\\delta$~Scuti, $\\gamma$~Doradus, $\\delta$~Cephei variable and RR Lyrae stars)\nand 248 other types of variables (unclassified periodic, multi-periodic and\naperiodic variable stars). Among the eclipsing binaries, 34 show O'Connell\neffects. One of the aperiodic variables shows a plateau light curve and another\none shows a secondary maximum after peak brightness. We also detected a complex\nbinary system with RS CVn-like light curve morphology; this object is being\nfollowed-up spectroscopically using the Gemini South telescope.\n", "  Classification of stars, by comparing their optical spectra to a few dozen\nspectral standards, has been a workhorse of observational astronomy for more\nthan a century. Here, we extend this technique by compiling a library of\noptical spectra of 404 touchstone stars observed with Keck/HIRES by the\nCalifornia Planet Search. The spectra are high-resolution (R~60000), high\nsignal-to-noise (SNR~150/pixel), and registered onto a common wavelength scale.\nThe library stars have properties derived from interferometry,\nasteroseismology, LTE spectral synthesis, and spectrophotometry. To address a\nlack of well-characterized late K-dwarfs in the literature, we measure stellar\nradii and temperatures for 23 nearby K-dwarfs, using SED modeling and Gaia\nparallaxes. This library represents a uniform dataset spanning the spectral\ntypes ~M5--F1 (Teff ~ 3000-7000K, Rstar ~ 0.1-1.6 Rsun). We also present\n\"Empirical SpecMatch\" (SpecMatch-Emp), a tool for parameterizing unknown\nspectra by comparing them against our spectral library. For FGKM stars,\nSpecMatch-Emp achieves accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature (Teff), 15%\nin stellar radius (Rstar), and 0.09 dex in metallicity [Fe/H]. Because the code\nrelies on empirical spectra it performs particularly well for stars ~K4 and\nlater which are challenging to model with existing spectral synthesizers,\nreaching accuracies of 70 K in Teff, 10% in Rstar, and 0.12 dex in [Fe/H]. We\nalso validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp, finding it to be robust at\nlower spectral resolution and SNR, enabling the characterization of faint\nlate-type stars. Both the library and stellar characterization code are\npublicly available.\n", "  The self-enrichment of massive star clusters by p-processed elements is shown\nto increase significantly with increasing gas density as a result of enhanced\nstar formation rates and stellar scatterings compared to the lifetime of a\nmassive star. Considering the type of cloud core where a globular cluster might\nhave formed, we follow the evolution and enrichment of the gas and the time\ndependence of stellar mass. A key assumption is that interactions between\nmassive stars are important at high density, including interactions between\nmassive stars and massive star binaries that can shred stellar envelopes.\nMassive-star interactions should also scatter low-mass stars out of the\ncluster. Reasonable agreement with the observations is obtained for a cloud\ncore mass of ~4x10^6 M_sun and a density of ~2x10^6 cm^{-3}. The results depend\nprimarily on a few dimensionless parameters, including, most importantly, the\nratio of the gas consumption time to the lifetime of a massive star, which has\nto be low, ~10%, and the efficiency of scattering low-mass stars per unit\ndynamical time, which has to be relatively large, such as a few percent. Also\nfor these conditions, the velocity dispersions of embedded globular clusters\nshould be comparable to the high gas dispersions of galaxies at that time, so\nthat stellar ejection by multi-star interactions could cause low-mass stars to\nleave a dwarf galaxy host altogether. This could solve the problem of missing\nfirst-generation stars in the halos of Fornax and WLM.\n", "  We show that the measured abundance of ultra-faint lensed galaxies at\n$z\\approx 6$ in the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) provides stringent constraints\non the parameter space of i) Dark Matter models based on keV sterile neutrinos;\nii) the \"fuzzy\" wavelike Dark Matter models, based on Bose-Einstein condensate\nof ultra-light particles. For the case of the sterile neutrinos, we consider\ntwo production mechanisms: resonant production through the mixing with active\nneutrinos and the decay of scalar particles. For the former model, we derive\nconstraints for the combination of sterile neutrino mass $m_{\\nu}$ and mixing\nparameter $\\sin^2(2\\theta)$ which provide the tightest lower bounds on the\nmixing angle (and hence on the lepton asymmetry) derived so far by methods\nindependent of baryonic physics. For the latter we compute the allowed\ncombinations of the scalar mass, its coupling to the Higgs field, and the\nYukawa coupling of the scalar to the sterile neutrinos. We compare our results\nto independent, existing astrophysical bounds on sterile neutrinos in the same\nmass range. For the case of \"fuzzy\" Dark Matter, we show that the observed\nnumber density $\\approx 1/{\\rm Mpc}^3$ of high-redshift galaxies in the HFF\nsets a lower limit $m_\\psi\\geq 8\\cdot 10^{-22}$ eV (at 3-$\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel) on the particle mass, a result that strongly disfavors wavelike bosonic\nDark Matter as a viable model for structure formation. We discuss the impact on\nour results of uncertainties due to systematics in the selection of highly\nmagnified, faint galaxies at high redshifts.\n", "  Emerging flux regions (EFRs) are known to exhibit various sporadic local\nheating events in the lower atmosphere. To investigate the characteristics of\nthese events, especially to link the photospheric magnetic fields and\natmospheric dynamics, we analyze Hinode, IRIS, and SDO data of a new EFR in\nNOAA AR 12401. Out of 151 bright points (BPs) identified in Hinode/SOT Ca\nimages, 29 are overlapped by an SOT/SP scan. Seven BPs in the EFR center\npossess mixed-polarity magnetic backgrounds in the photosphere. Their IRIS UV\nspectra (e.g., Si IV 1402.8 A) are strongly enhanced and red- or blue-shifted\nwith tails reaching +/- 150 km/s, which is highly suggestive of bi-directional\njets, and each brightening lasts for 10 - 15 minutes leaving flare-like light\ncurves. Most of this group show bald patches, the U-shaped photospheric\nmagnetic loops. Another 10 BPs are found in unipolar regions at the EFR edges.\nThey are generally weaker in UV intensities and exhibit systematic redshifts\nwith Doppler speeds up to 40 km/s, which could exceed the local sound speed in\nthe transition region. Both types of BPs show signs of strong temperature\nincrease in the low chromosphere. These observational results support the\nphysical picture that heating events in the EFR center are due to magnetic\nreconnection within cancelling undular fields like Ellerman bombs, while the\nperipheral heating events are due to shocks or strong compressions caused by\nfast downflows along the overlying arch filament system.\n", "  We characterize the first 40 Myr of evolution of circumstellar disks through\na unified study of the infrared properties of members of young clusters and\nassociations with ages from 2 Myr up to ~ 40 Myr: NGC 1333, NGC 1960, NGC 2232,\nNGC 2244, NGC 2362, NGC 2547, IC 348, IC 2395, IC 4665, Chamaeleon I, Orion\nOB1a and OB1b, Taurus, the \\b{eta} Pictoris Moving Group, \\r{ho} Ophiuchi, and\nthe associations of Argus, Carina, Columba, Scorpius-Centaurus, and\nTucana-Horologium. Our work features: 1.) a filtering technique to flag noisy\nbackgrounds, 2.) a method based on the probability distribution of deflections,\nP(D), to obtain statistically valid photometry for faint sources, and 3.) use\nof the evolutionary trend of transitional disks to constrain the overall\nbehavior of bright disks. We find that the fraction of disks three or more\ntimes brighter than the stellar photospheres at 24 {\\mu}m decays relatively\nslowly initially and then much more rapidly by ~ 10 Myr. However, there is a\ncontinuing component until ~ 35 Myr, probably due primarily to massive clouds\nof debris generated in giant impacts during the oligarchic/chaotic growth\nphases of terrestrial planets. If the contribution from primordial disks is\nexcluded, the evolution of the incidence of these oligarchic/chaotic debris\ndisks can be described empirically by a log-normal function with the peak at 12\n- 20 Myr, including ~ 13 % of the original population, and with a post-peak\nmean duration of 10 - 20 Myr.\n", "  The process that leads to the formation of the bright star forming sites\nobserved along prominent spiral arms remains elusive. We present results of a\nmulti-wavelength study of a spiral arm segment in the nearby grand-design\nspiral galaxy M51 that belongs to a spiral density wave and exhibits nine gas\nspurs. The combined observations of the(ionized, atomic, molecular, dusty)\ninterstellar medium (ISM) with star formation tracers (HII regions, young\n<10Myr stellar clusters) suggest (1) no variation in giant molecular cloud\n(GMC) properties between arm and gas spurs, (2) gas spurs and extinction\nfeathers arising from the same structure with a close spatial relation between\ngas spurs and ongoing/recent star formation (despite higher gas surface\ndensities in the spiral arm), (3) no trend in star formation age either along\nthe arm or along a spur, (4) evidence for strong star formation feedback in gas\nspurs: (5) tentative evidence for star formation triggered by stellar feedback\nfor one spur, and (6) GMC associations (GMAs) being no special entities but the\nresult of blending of gas arm/spur cross-sections in lower resolution\nobservations. We conclude that there is no evidence for a coherent star\nformation onset mechanism that can be solely associated to the presence of the\nspiral density wave. This suggests that other (more localized) mechanisms are\nimportant to delay star formation such that it occurs in spurs. The evidence of\nstar formation proceeding over several million years within individual spurs\nimplies that the mechanism that leads to star formation acts or is sustained\nover a longer time-scale.\n", "  In a solar flare, a large fraction of the magnetic energy released is\nconverted rapidly to the kinetic energy of non-thermal particles and bulk\nplasma motion. This will likely result in non-equilibrium particle\ndistributions and turbulent plasma conditions. We investigate this by analysing\nthe profiles of high-temperature extreme ultraviolet emission lines from a\nmajor flare (SOL2014-03-29T17:44) observed by the EUV Imaging Spectrometer\n(EIS) on Hinode. We find that in many locations the line profiles are\nnon-Gaussian, consistent with a kappa-distribution of emitting ions with\nproperties that vary in space and time. At the flare footpoints, close to sites\nof hard X-ray emission from non-thermal electrons, the kappa-index for the Fe\nXVI 262.976 angstrom line at 3 MK takes values of 3-5. In the corona, close to\na low-energy HXR source, the Fe XXIII 263.760 angstrom line at 15 MK shows\nkappa values of typically 4-7. The observed trends in the kappa parameter show\nthat we are most likely detecting the properties of the ion population rather\nthan any instrumental effects. We calculate that a non-thermal ion population\ncould exist if locally accelerated on timescales < 0.1 s. However, observations\nof net redshifts in the lines also imply the presence of plasma downflows which\ncould lead to bulk turbulence, with increased non-Gaussianity in cooler\nregions. Both interpretations have important implications for theories of solar\nflare particle acceleration.\n", "  MCG-5-23-16 was targeted in early 2015 with a half mega-seconds observing\ncampaign using NuSTAR. Here we present the spectral analysis of these datasets\nalong with an earlier observation and study the relativistic reflection and the\nprimary coronal source. The data show strong reflection features in the form of\nboth narrow and broad iron lines plus a Compton reflection hump. A cutoff\nenergy is significantly detected in all exposures. The shape of the reflection\nspectrum does not change in the two years spanned by the observations,\nsuggesting a stable geometry. A strong positive correlation is found between\nthe cutoff energy and both the hard X-ray flux and spectral index. The\nmeasurements imply that the coronal plasma is not at the runaway\nelectron-positron pair limit, and instead contains mostly electrons. The\nobserved variability in the coronal properties is driven by a variable optical\ndepth. A constant heating to cooling ratio is measured implying that there is a\nfeedback mechanism in which a significant fraction of the photons cooling the\ncorona are due to reprocessed hard X-rays.\n", "  We study the effect of strong magnetic field on competing chiral and diquark\norder parameters in a regime of moderately dense quark matter. The\ninter-dependence of the chiral and diquark condensates through nonperturbative\nquark mass and strong coupling effects is analyzed in a two-flavor\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. In the weak magnetic field limit, our results\nagree qualitatively with earlier zero-field studies in the literature that find\na critical coupling ratio $G_D/G_S\\sim 1.1$ below which chiral or\nsuperconducting order parameters appear almost exclusively. Above the critical\nratio, there exists a significant mixed broken phase region where both gaps are\nnon-zero. However, a strong magnetic field $B\\gtrsim 10^{18}$ G disrupts this\nmixed broken phase region and changes a smooth crossover found in the\nweak-field case to a first-order transition for both gaps at almost the same\ncritical density. Our results suggest that in the two-flavor approximation to\nmoderately dense quark matter, strong magnetic field enhances the possibility\nof a mixed phase at high density, with implications for the structure,\nenergetics and vibrational spectrum of neutron stars.\n", "  Long-lived rotational and meridional flows are important ingredients of the\nsolar cycle. Magnetic field images have typically been used to measure these\nflows on the solar surface by cross-correlating thin longitudinal strips or\nsquare patches across sufficiently long time gaps. Here, I use one month of\nSDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetic field observations, combined with the SWAMIS\nmagnetic feature tracking algorithm to measure the motion of individual\nfeatures in these magnetograms. By controlling for perturbations due to\nshort-lived flows and due to false motions from feature interactions, I\neffectively isolate the long-lived flows traced by the magnetic features. This\nallows me to produce high-fidelity differential rotation measurements with\nwell-characterized variances and covariances of the fit parameters.I find a\nsidereal rotational profile of\n$(14.296\\pm0.006)+(-1.847\\pm0.056)\\sin^{2}b+(-2.615\\pm0.093)\\sin^{4}b$, with\nunits of $\\textrm{ deg d}^{-1}$, and a large covariance\n$\\sigma_{BC}^{2}=-4.87\\times10^{-3}(\\textrm{ deg d}^{-1})^{2}$. I also produce\nmedium-fidelity measurements of the much weaker meridional flow that is broadly\nconsistent with previous results. This measurement shows a peak flow of\n$16.7\\pm0.6\\text{ m s}^{-1}$ at latitude $b=45^\\circ$ but is insufficiently\ncharacterized at higher latitudes to ascertain whether the chosen functional\nform $2\\cos b\\sin b$ is appropriate. This work shows that measuring the motions\nof individual features in photospheric magnetograms can produce high precision\nresults in relatively short time spans, and suggests that high resolution\nnon-longitudinally averaged photospheric velocity residual measurements could\nbe produced to compare with coronal results, and to provide other diagnostics\nof the solar dynamo.\n", "  We discuss the influence of rotation on the combined synthesis of Ti44 and\nNi56 in massive stars. While Ni56 is significantly produced by both the\ncomplete and incomplete explosive Si burning, Ti44 is mainly produced by the\ncomplete explosive Si burning, with a minor contribution (in standard non\nrotating models) from the incomplete explosive Si burning and the O burning\n(both explosive and hydrostatic). We find that, in most cases, the thickness of\nthe region exposed to the incomplete explosive Si burning increases in rotating\nmodels (v_ini=300 km/s) and since Ni56 is significantly produced in this zone,\nthe fraction of mass coming from the complete explosive Si burning zone,\nnecessary to get the required amount of Ni56, reduces. Therefore the amount of\nTi44 ejected for a given fixed amount of Ni56 decreases in rotating models.\nHowever, some rotating models at [Fe/H]=-1 develop a very extended O convective\nshell in which a consistent amount of Ti44 is formed, preserved and ejected in\nthe interstellar medium. Hence a better modeling of the thermal instabilities\n(convection) in the advanced burning phases together with a critical analysis\nof the cross sections of the nuclear reactions operating in O burning are\nrelevant for the understanding of the synthesis of Ti44.\n", "  This paper presents the first detailed investigation of the characteristics\nof mm/submm phase fluctuation and phase correction methods obtained using ALMA\nwith baseline lengths up to ~15 km. Most of the spatial structure functions\n(SSFs) show that the phase fluctuation increases as a function of baseline\nlength, with a power-law slope of ~0.6. In many cases, we find that the slope\nbecomes shallower (average of ~0.2-0.3) at baseline lengths longer than ~1 km,\nnamely showing a turn-over in SSF. The phase correction method using water\nvapor radiometers (WVRs) works well, especially for the cases where PWV >1 mm,\nwhich reduces the degree of phase fluctuations by a factor of two in many\ncases. However, phase fluctuations still remain after the WVR phase correction,\nsuggesting the existence of other turbulent constituent that cause the phase\nfluctuation. This is supported by occasional SSFs that do not exhibit any\nturn-over; these are only seen when the PWV is low or after WVR phase\ncorrection. This means that the phase fluctuation caused by this turbulent\nconstituent is inherently smaller than that caused by water vapor. Since there\nis no turn-over in the SSF up to the maximum baseline length of ~15 km, this\nturbulent constituent must have scale height of 10 km or more, and thus cannot\nbe water vapor, whose scale height is around 1 km. This large scale height\nturbulent constituent is likely to be water ice or a dry component. Excess path\nlength fluctuation after the WVR phase correction at a baseline length of 10 km\nis large (>200 micron), which is significant for high frequency (>450 GHz or\n<700 micron) observations. These results suggest the need for an additional\nphase correction method, such as fast switching, in addition to the WVR phase\ncorrection. We simulated the fast switching, and the result suggests that it\nworks well, with shorter cycle times linearly improving the coherence.\n", "  The XY pyrochlore antiferromagnet Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a rare case of\n$Z_6$ discrete symmetry breaking in its $\\psi_2$ magnetic ground state. Despite\nbeing well-studied theoretically, systems with high discrete symmetry breakings\nare uncommon in nature and, thus, Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ provides an experimental\nplayground for the study of broken $Z_n$ symmetry, for $n>2$. A recent\ntheoretical work examined the effect of a magnetic field on a pyrochlore\nlattice with broken $Z_6$ symmetry and applied it to Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$. This\nstudy predicted multiple domain transitions depending on the crystallographic\norientation of the magnetic field, inducing rich and controllable\nmagnetothermodynamic behavior. In this work, we present neutron scattering\nmeasurements on Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ with a magnetic field applied along the [001]\nand [111] directions, and provide the first experimental observation of these\nexotic domain transitions. In a [001] field, we observe a $\\psi_2$ to $\\psi_3$\ntransition at a critical field of 0.18$\\pm$0.05T. We are thus able to extend\nthe concept of the spin-flop transition, which has long been observed in Ising\nsystems, to higher discrete $Z_n$ symmetries. In a [111] field, we observe a\nseries of domain-based phase transitions for fields of 0.15$\\pm$0.03T and\n0.40$\\pm$0.03T. We show that these field-induced transitions are consistent\nwith the emergence of two-fold, three-fold and possibly six-fold Zeeman terms.\nConsidering all the possible $\\psi_2$ and $\\psi_3$ domains, these Zeeman terms\ncan be mapped onto an analog clock - exemplifying a literal clock anisotropy.\nLastly, our quantitative analysis of the [001] domain transition in\nEr$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is consistent with order-by-disorder as the dominant ground\nstate selection mechanism.\n", "  We map for the first time the two-dimensional H_2 excitation of warm\nintergalactic gas in Stephan's Quintet on group-wide (50 x 35 kpc^2) scales to\nquantify the temperature, mass and warm-H_2 mass fraction as a function of\nposition using Spitzer. Molecular gas temperatures are seen to rise (to T >\n700K) and the slope of the power--law density-temperature relation flattens\nalong the main ridge of the filament, defining the region of maximum heating.\nWe also performed MHD modeling of the excitation properties of the warm gas, to\nmap the velocity structure and energy deposition rate of slow and fast\nmolecular shocks. Slow magnetic shocks were required to explain the power\nradiated from the lowest--lying rotational states of H_2, and strongly support\nthe idea that energy cascades down to small scales and low velocities from the\nfast collision of NGC 7318b with group-wide gas. The highest levels of heating\nof the warm H_2 is strongly correlated with the large-scale stirring of the\nmedium as measured by [CII] spectroscopy with Herschel. H_2 is also seen\nassociated with a separate bridge which extends towards the Seyfert nucleus in\nNGC 7319, both from Spitzer and CARMA CO observations. This opens up the\npossibility that both galaxy collisions and AGN outflows can turbulently heat\ngas on large-scales in compact groups. The observations provide a laboratory\nfor studying the effects of turbulent energy dissipation on group-wide scales\nthat may provide clues about the heating and cooling of gas at high-z in early\ngalaxy and protogalaxy formation.\n", "  Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a gravitational framework designed to\nexplain the astronomical observations in the Universe without the inclusion of\nparticle dark matter. Modified Newtonian Dynamics, in its current form, cannot\nexplain the missing mass in galaxy clusters without the inclusion of some extra\nmass, be it in the form of neutrinos or non-luminous baryonic matter. We\ninvestigate whether the MOND framework can be generalized to account for the\nmissing mass in galaxy clusters by boosting gravity in high gravitational\npotential regions. We examine and review Extended MOND (EMOND), which was\ndesigned to increase the MOND scale acceleration in high potential regions,\nthereby boosting the gravity in clusters. We seek to investigate galaxy cluster\nmass profiles in the context of MOND with the primary aim at explaining the\nmissing mass problem fully without the need for dark matter. Using the\nassumption that the clusters are in hydrostatic equilibrium, we can compute the\ndynamical mass of each cluster and compare the result to the predicted mass of\nthe EMOND formalism. We find that EMOND has some success in fitting some\nclusters, but overall has issues when trying to explain the mass deficit fully.\nWe also investigate an empirical relation to solve the cluster problem, which\nis found by analysing the cluster data and is based on the MOND paradigm. We\ndiscuss the limitations in the text.\n", "  We perform a detailed analysis of the thermal structure of the region above\nthe post-eruption arcade for a flare that occurred on 2011 October 22. During\nthis event, a sheet of hot plasma is visible above the flare loops in the 131\n\\AA\\ bandpass of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the {\\it Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO)}. Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are observed\ntraveling sunward through the post-eruption plasma sheet. We calculate\ndifferential emission measures using the AIA data and derive an emission\nmeasure weighted average temperature in the supra-arcade region. In areas where\nmany SADs occur, the temperature of the supra-arcade plasma tends to increase,\nwhile in areas where no SADs are observed, the temperature tends to decrease.\nWe calculate the plane-of-sky velocities in the supra-arcade plasma and use\nthem to calculate the potential heating due to adiabatic compression and\nviscous heating. Ten of the 13 SADs studied have noticeable signatures in both\nthe adiabatic and the viscous terms. The adiabatic heating due to compression\nof plasma in front of the SADs is on the order of 0.1 - 0.2 MK/s, which is\nsimilar in magnitude to the estimated conductive cooling rate. This result\nsupports the notion that SADs contribute locally to the heating of plasma in\nthe supra-arcade region. We also find that in the region without SADs, the\nplasma cools at a rate slower than the estimated conductive cooling, indicating\nadditional heating mechanisms may act globally to keep the plasma temperature\nhigh.\n", "  We study the properties of polarized radiation in turbulent magnetic fields\nfrom X-ray binary jets. These turbulent magnetic fields are composed of large-\nand small-scale configurations, which result in the polarized jitter radiation\nwhen the characteristic length of turbulence is less than the non-relativistic\nLarmor radius. On the contrary, the polarized synchrotron emission occurs,\ncorresponding to a large-scale turbulent environment. We calculate the spectral\nenergy distributions and the degree of polarization for a general microquasar.\nNumerical results show that turbulent magnetic field configurations can indeed\nprovide a high degree of polarization, which does not mean that a uniform,\nlarge-scale magnetic field structure exists. The model is applied to\ninvestigate the properties of polarized radiation of black hole X-ray binary\nCygnus X--1. Under the constraint of multiband observations of this source, our\nstudies demonstrate that the model can explain the high polarization degree at\nMeV tail and predict the highly polarized properties at high-energy\n$\\gamma$-ray region, and that the dominant small-scale turbulent magnetic field\nplays an important role for explaining the highly polarized observation at hard\nX-ray/soft $\\gamma$-ray bands. This model can be tested by polarization\nobservations of upcoming polarimeters at high-energy $\\gamma$-ray bands.\n", "  Many astronomical sources produce transient phenomena at radio frequencies,\nbut the transient sky at low frequencies (<300 MHz) remains relatively\nunexplored. Blind surveys with new widefield radio instruments are setting\nincreasingly stringent limits on the transient surface density on various\ntimescales. Although many of these instruments are limited by classical\nconfusion noise from an ensemble of faint, unresolved sources, one can in\nprinciple detect transients below the classical confusion limit to the extent\nthat the classical confusion noise is independent of time. We develop a\ntechnique for detecting radio transients that is based on temporal matched\nfilters applied directly to time series of images rather than relying on\nsource-finding algorithms applied to individual images. This technique has\nwell-defined statistical properties and is applicable to variable and transient\nsearches for both confusion-limited and non-confusion-limited instruments.\nUsing the Murchison Widefield Array as an example, we demonstrate that the\ntechnique works well on real data despite the presence of classical confusion\nnoise, sidelobe confusion noise, and other systematic errors. We searched for\ntransients lasting between 2 minutes and 3 months. We found no transients and\nset improved upper limits on the transient surface density at 182 MHz for flux\ndensities between ~20--200 mJy, providing the best limits to date for hour- and\nmonth-long transients.\n", "  Using two-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulations we study the\ncompetition between the continuously driven parallel proton temperature\nanisotropy and fire hose instabilities in collisionless homogeneous plasmas.\nFor quasi radial ambient magnetic field the expansion drives\n$T_{\\mathrm{p}\\|}>T_{\\mathrm{p}\\perp}$ and the system becomes eventually\nunstable with respect to the dominant parallel fire hose instability. This\ninstability is generally unable to counteract the induced anisotropization and\nthe system typically becomes unstable with respect to the oblique fire hose\ninstability later on. The oblique instability efficiently reduces the\nanisotropy and the system rapidly stabilizes while a significant part of the\ngenerated electromagnetic fluctuations is damped to protons. As long as the\nmagnetic field is in the quasi radial direction, this evolution repeats itself\nand the electromagnetic fluctuations accumulate. For sufficiently oblique\nmagnetic field the expansion drives $T_{\\mathrm{p}\\perp}>T_{\\mathrm{p}\\|}$ and\nbrings the system to the stable region with respect to the fire hose\ninstabilities.\n", "  We present the second Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) afterglow catalog, greatly expanding on the first Swift UVOT GRB\nafterglow catalog. The second catalog is constructed from a database containing\nover 120,000 independent UVOT observations of 538 GRBs first detected by Swift,\nthe High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE2), the INTErnational Gamma-Ray\nAstrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), the Interplanetary Network (IPN), Fermi,\nand Astro-rivelatore Gamma a Immagini Leggero (AGILE). The catalog covers GRBs\ndiscovered from 2005 Jan 17 to 2010 Dec 25. Using photometric information in\nthree UV bands, three optical bands, and a `white' or open filter, the data are\noptimally co-added to maximize the number of detections and normalized to one\nband to provide a detailed light curve. The catalog provides positional,\ntemporal, and photometric information for each burst, as well as Swift Burst\nAlert Telescope (BAT) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) GRB parameters. Temporal slopes\nare provided for each UVOT filter. The temporal slope per filter of almost half\nthe GRBs are fit with a single power-law, but one to three breaks are required\nin the remaining bursts. Morphological comparisons with the X-ray reveal that\napproximately 75% of the UVOT light curves are similar to one of the four\nmorphologies identified by Evans et al. (2009). The remaining approximately 25%\nhave a newly identified morphology. For many bursts, redshift and extinction\ncorrected UV/optical spectral slopes are also provided at 2000, 20,000, and\n200,000 seconds.\n", "  In young starburst galaxies, the X-ray population is expected to be dominated\nby the relics of the most massive and short-lived stars, black-hole and\nneutron-star high mass X-ray binaries (XRBs). In the closest such galaxy, IC\n10, we have made a multi-wavelength census of these objects. Employing a novel\nstatistical correlation technique, we have matched our list of 110 X-ray point\nsources, derived from a decade of Chandra observations, against published\nphotometric data. We report an 8 sigma correlation between the celestial\ncoordinates of the two catalogs, with 42 X-ray sources having an optical\ncounterpart. Applying an optical color-magnitude selection to isolate blue\nsupergiant (SG) stars in IC 10, we find 16 matches. Both cases show a\nstatistically significant overabundance versus the expectation value for chance\nalignments. The blue objects also exhibit systematically higher fx/fv ratios\nthan other stars in the same magnitude range. Blue SG-XRBs include a major\nclass of progenitors of double-degenerate binaries, hence their numbers are an\nimportant factor in modeling the rate of gravitational wave sources. We suggest\nthat the anomalous features of the IC 10 stellar population are explained if\nthe age of the IC 10 starburst is close to the time of the peak of interaction\nfor massive binaries.\n", "  We analyse new optical observations of the gravitational lens system SDSS\nJ1515+1511. These include a 2.6-year photometric monitoring with the Liverpool\nTelescope (LT) in the $r$ band, as well as a spectroscopic follow-up with the\nLT and the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). Our $r$-band LT light curves cover a\nquiescent microlensing period of the doubly imaged quasar at $z_{\\rm s}$ =\n2.049, which permits us to robustly estimate the time delay between the two\nimages A and B: 211 $\\pm$ 5 days (1$\\sigma$ confidence interval; A is leading).\nUnfortunately, the main lensing galaxy (G1) is so faint and close to the bright\nquasar that it is not feasible to accurately extract its spectrum through the\nGTC data. However, assuming the putative redshift $z_{\\rm G1}$ = 0.742, the GTC\nand LT spectra of the distant quasar are used to discuss the macrolens\nmagnification, and the extinction and microlensing effects in G1. The new\nconstraints on the time delay and macrolens magnification ratio essentially do\nnot change previous findings on the mass scale of G1 and external shear, while\nthe redshift of the lensing mass is found to be consistent with the assumed\nvalue of $z_{\\rm G1}$. This is a clear evidence that G1 is indeed located at\n$z_{\\rm G1}$ = 0.742. From the GTC data we also obtain the redshift of two\nadditional objects (the secondary galaxy G2 and a new absorption system) and\ndiscuss their possible role in the lens scenario.\n", "  We present an analysis of the pairwise velocity statistics from a suite of\ncosmological N-body simulations describing the \"Running\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker\" (R-FLRW) cosmological model. This model\nis based on quantum field theory in a curved space-time and extends\n{\\Lambda}CDM with a time-evolving vacuum energy density. To enforce local\nconservation of matter a time-evolving gravitational coupling is also included.\nOur results constitute the first study of velocities in the R-FLRW cosmology,\nand we also compare with other dark energy simulations suites, repeating the\nsame analysis. We find a strong degeneracy between the pairwise velocity and\n{\\sigma}_8 at z=0 for almost all scenarios considered, which remains even when\nwe look back to epochs as early as z=2. We also investigate various Coupled\nDark Energy models, some of which show minimal degeneracy, and reveal\ninteresting deviations from {\\Lambda}CDM which could be readily exploited by\nfuture cosmological observations to test and further constrain our\nunderstanding of dark energy.\n", "  The total mass M_GCS in the globular cluster (GC) system of a galaxy is\nempirically a near-constant fraction of the total mass M_h = M_bary + M_dark of\nthe galaxy, across a range of 10^5 in galaxy mass. This trend is radically\nunlike the strongly nonlinear behavior of total stellar mass M_star versus M_h.\nWe discuss extensions of this trend to two more extreme situations: (a) entire\nclusters of galaxies, and (b) the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) recently\ndiscovered in Coma and elsewhere. Our calibration of the ratio \\eta_M = M_GCS /\nM_h from normal galaxies, accounting for new revisions in the adopted\nmass-to-light ratio for GCs, now gives \\eta_M = 2.9 \\times 10^{-5} as the mean\nabsolute mass fraction. We find that the same ratio appears valid for galaxy\nclusters and UDGs. Estimates of \\eta_M in the four clusters we examine tend to\nbe slightly higher than for individual galaxies, butmore data and better\nconstraints on the mean GC mass in such systems are needed to determine if this\ndifference is significant. We use the constancy of \\eta_M to estimate total\nmasses for several individual cases; for example, the total mass of the Milky\nWay is calculated to be M_h = 1.1 \\times 10^{12} M_sun. Physical explanations\nfor the uniformity of \\eta_M are still descriptive, but point to a picture in\nwhich massive, dense star clusters in their formation stages were relatively\nimmune to the feedback that more strongly influenced lower-density regions\nwhere most stars form.\n", "  Observational evidence exists for the formation of gas giant planets on wide\norbits around young stars by disk gravitational instability, but the roles of\ndisk instability and core accretion for forming gas giants on shorter period\norbits are less clear. The controversy extends to population synthesis models\nof exoplanet demographics and to hydrodynamical models of the fragmentation\nprocess. The latter refers largely to the handling of radiative transfer in\nthree dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical models, which controls heating and\ncooling processes in gravitationally unstable disks, and hence dense clump\nformation. A suite of models using the $\\beta$ cooling approximation is\npresented here. The initial disks have masses of 0.091 $M_\\odot$ and extend\nfrom 4 to 20 AU around a 1 $M_\\odot$ protostar. The initial minimum Toomre\n$Q_i$ values range from 1.3 to 2.7, while $\\beta$ ranges from 1 to 100. We show\nthat the choice of $Q_i$ is equal in importance to the $\\beta$ value assumed:\nhigh $Q_i$ disks can be stable for small $\\beta$, when the initial disk\ntemperature is taken as a lower bound, while low $Q_i$ disks can fragment for\nhigh $\\beta$. These results imply that the evolution of disks toward low $Q_i$\nmust be taken into account in assessing disk fragmentation possibilities, at\nleast in the inner disk, i.e., inside about 20 AU. The models suggest that if\nlow $Q_i$ disks can form, there should be an as yet largely undetected\npopulation of gas giants orbiting G dwarfs between about 6 AU and 16 AU.\n", "  Light field reconstruction from images captured by focal plane sweeping can\nachieve high lateral resolution comparable to the modern camera sensor. This is\nimpossible for the conventional micro-lenslet based light field capture\nsystems. However, the severe defocus noise and the low depth resolution limit\nits applications. In this paper, we analyze the defocus noise and the depth\nresolution in the focal plane sweeping based light field reconstruction\ntechnique, and propose a method to reduce the defocus noise and improve the\ndepth resolution. Both numerical and experimental results verify the proposed\nmethod.\n", "  The change in electrical resistance associated with the application of an\nexternal magnetic field is known as the magnetoresistance (MR). The measured MR\nis quite complex in the class of connected networks of single-domain\nferromagnetic nanowires, known as \"artificial spin ice\", due to the\ngeometrically-induced collective behavior of the nanowire moments. We have\nconducted a thorough experimental study of the MR of a connected honeycomb\nartificial spin ice, and we present a simulation methodology for understanding\nthe detailed behavior of this complex correlated magnetic system. Our results\ndemonstrate that the behavior, even at low magnetic fields, can be\nwell-described only by including significant contributions from the vertices at\nwhich the legs meet, opening the door to new geometrically-induced MR\nphenomena.\n", "  We observed 15 of the solar-type binaries within 67 pc of the Sun previously\nobserved by the Robo-AO system in the visible, with the PHARO near-IR camera\nand the PALM-3000 adaptive optics system on the 5 m Hale telescope. The\nphysical status of the binaries is confirmed through common proper motion and\ndetection of orbital motion. In the process we detected a new candidate\ncompanion to HIP 95309. We also resolved the primary of HIP 110626 into a close\nbinary making that system a triple. These detections increase the completeness\nof the multiplicity survey of the solar-type stars within 67 pc of the Sun.\nCombining our observations of HIP 103455 with archival astrometric measurements\nand RV measurements, we are able to compute the first orbit of HIP 103455\nshowing that the binary has a 68 yr period. We place the components on a\ncolor-magnitude diagram and discuss each multiple system individually.\n", "  NaSbS2 is a semiconductor that was recently shown to have remarkable efficacy\nas a solar absorber indicating efficient charge collection even in defected\nmaterial. We report first principles calculations of properties that show (1)\nan indirect gap only slightly smaller than the direct gap, which may impede\nrecombination of photoexcited carriers, (2) highly anisotropic electronic and\noptical properties reflecting a layered crystal structure, (3) a pushed up\nvalence band maximum due to repulsion from the Sb 5s states and (4) cross-gap\nhybridization between the S p derived valence bands and the Sb 5p states. This\nlatter feature leads to enhanced Born effective charges that can provide local\nscreening and therefore defect tolerance. These features are discussed in\nrelation to the performance of the compound as a semiconductor with efficient\ncharge collection.\n", "  The ultimate understanding of Type Ia Supernovae diversity is one of the most\nurgent issues to exploit thermonuclear explosions of accreted White Dwarfs\n(WDs) as cosmological yardsticks. In particular, we investigate the impact of\nthe progenitor system metallicity on the physical and chemical properties of\nthe WD at the explosion epoch. We analyze the evolution of CO WDs through the\naccretion and simmering phases by using evolutionary models based on\ntime-dependent convective mixing and an extended nuclear network including the\nmost important electron captures, beta decays and URCA processes. We find that,\ndue to URCA processes and electron-captures, the neutron excess and density at\nwhich the thermal runaway occurs are substantially larger than previously\nclaimed. Moreover, we find that the higher the progenitor metallicity, the\nlarger the neutron excess variation during the accretion and simmering phases\nand the higher the central density and the convective velocity at the\nexplosion. Hence, the simmering phase acts as an amplifier of the differences\nexisting in SNe Ia progenitors. When applying our results to the neutron excess\nestimated for the Tycho and Kepler young Supernova remnants, we derive that the\nmetallicity of the progenitors should be in the range Z=0.030-0.032, close to\nthe average metallicity value of the thin disk of the Milky Way. As the amount\nof ${^{56}}$Ni produced in the explosion depends on the neutron excess and\ncentral density at the thermal runaway, our results suggest that the light\ncurve properties depend on the progenitor metallicity.\n", "  Nitrogen fractionation is commonly used to assess the thermal history of\nSolar System volatiles. With ALMA it is for the first time possible to directly\nmeasure 14N/15N ratios in common molecules during the assembly of planetary\nsystems. We present ALMA observations of the H13CN and HC15N J=3-2 lines at\n0\".5 angular resolution, toward a sample of six protoplanetary disks, selected\nto span a range of stellar and disk structure properties. Adopting a typical\n12C/13C ratio of 70, we find comet-like 14N/15N ratios of 80-160 in 5/6 of the\ndisks (3 T Tauri and 2 Herbig Ae disks) and lack constraints for one of the T\nTauri disks (IM Lup). There are no systematic differences between T Tauri and\nHerbig Ae disks, or between full and transition disks within the sample. In\naddition, no correlation is observed between disk-averaged D/H and 14N/15N\nratios in the sample. One of the disks, V4046 Sgr, presents unusually bright\nHCN isotopologue emission, enabling us to model the radial profiles of H13CN\nand HC15N. We find tentative evidence of an increasing 14N/15N ratio with\nradius, indicating that selective photodissociation in the inner disk is\nimportant in setting the 14N/15N ratio during planet formation.\n", "  Angular momentum, or spin, is a fundamental property of black holes (BHs),\nyet it is much more difficult to estimate than mass or accretion rate (for\nactively accreting systems). In recent years, high-quality X-ray observations\nhave allowed for detailed measurements of the Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line, where\nrelativistic line broadening allows constraints on the spin parameter (the\nX-ray reflection method). Another technique uses accretion disk models to fit\nthe AGN continuum emission (the continuum-fitting, or CF, method). Although\neach technique has model-dependent uncertainties, these are the best empirical\ntools currently available and should be vetted in systems where both techniques\ncan be applied. A detailed comparison of the two methods is also useful because\nneither method can be applied to all AGN. The X-ray reflection technique\ntargets mostly local (z $\\lesssim$ 0.1) systems, while the CF method can be\napplied at higher redshift, up to and beyond the peak of AGN activity and\ngrowth. Here, we apply the CF method to two AGN with X-ray reflection\nmeasurements. For both the high-mass AGN, H1821+643, and the Seyfert 1, NGC\n3783, we find a range in spin parameter consistent with the X-ray reflection\nmeasurements. However, the near-maximal spin favored by the reflection method\nfor NGC 3783 is more probable if we add a disk wind to the model. Refinement of\nthese techniques, together with improved X-ray measurements and tighter BH mass\nconstraints, will permit this comparison in a larger sample of AGN and increase\nour confidence in these spin estimation techniques.\n", "  By using a new method of forced-field extrapolation, we study the emerging\nflux region AR 11850 observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph\n(IRIS) and Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO). Our results suggest that the\nbright points (BPs) in this emerging region have responses in lines formed from\nthe upper photosphere to the transition region, with a relatively similar\nmorphology. They have an oscillation of several minutes according to the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) data at 1600 and 1700 A . The ratio between\nthe BP intensities measured in 1600 A and 1700 A filtergrams reveals that these\nBPs are heated differently. Our analysis of the Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager (HMI) vector magnetic field and the corresponding topology in AR11850\nindicates that the BPs are located at the polarity inversion line (PIL) and\nmost of them related with magnetic reconnection or cancelation. The heating of\nthe BPs might be different due to different magnetic topology. We find that the\nheating due to the magnetic cancelation would be stronger than the case of bald\npatch reconnection. The plasma density rather than the magnetic field strength\ncould play a dominant role in this process. Based on physical conditions in the\nlower atmosphere, our forced-field extrapolation shows consistent results\nbetween the bright arcades visible in slit-jaw image (SJI) 1400 A and the\nextrapolated field lines that pass through the bald patches. It provides a\nreliable observational evidence for testing the mechanism of magnetic\nreconnection for the BPs and arcades in emerging flux region, as proposed in\nsimulation works.\n", "  Combination of a construction of unambiguous quantum conditions out of the\nconventional one and a simultaneous quantization of the positions, momenta,\nangular momenta and Hamiltonian leads to the geometric potential given by the\nso-called thin-lay quantization.\n", "  We report on the detection of linear polarization of the forbidden [O i]\n630.03 nm spectral line. The observations were carried out in the broader\ncontext of the determination of the solar oxygen abundance, an important\nproblem in astrophysics that still remains unresolved. We obtained\nspectro-polarimetric data of the forbidden [O i] line at 630.03 nm as well as\nother neighboring permitted lines with the Solar Optical Telescope of the\nHinode satellite. A novel averaging technique was used, yielding very high\nsignal-to-noise ratios in excess of $10^5$. We confirm that the linear\npolarization is sign-reversed compared to permitted lines as a result of the\nline being dominated by a magnetic dipole transition. Our observations open a\nnew window for solar oxygen abundance studies, offering an alternative method\nto disentangle the Ni i blend from the [O i] line at 630.03 nm that has the\nadvantage of simple LTE formation physics.\n", "  The theory of the long-range interaction of metastable excited atomic states\nwith ground-state atoms is analyzed. We show that the long-range interaction is\nessentially modified when quasi-degenerate states are available for virtual\ntransitions. A discrepancy in the literature regarding the van der Waals\ncoefficient C_6(2S;1S) describing the interaction of metastable atomic hydrogen\n(2S state) with a ground-state hydrogen atom is resolved. In the the van der\nWaals range a_0 << R << a_0/alpha, where a_0= hbar/(alpha m c) is the Bohr\nradius and alpha is the fine structure constant, one finds the\nsymmetry-dependent result E_{2S;1S}(R) ~ (-176.75 +/- 27.98) E_h (a_0/R)^6 (E_h\ndenotes the Hartree energy). In the Casimir-Polder range a_0/alpha << R << hbar\nc/L, where L = E(2S_{1/2})-E(2P_{1/2}) is the Lamb shift energy, one finds\nE_{2S;1S}(R) ~ (-121.50 +/- 46.61) E_h (a_0/R)^6. In the the Lamb shift range R\n>> hbar c/L, we find an oscillatory tail with a negligible interaction energy\nbelow 10^(-36) Hz. Dirac-delta perturbations to the interaction are also\nevaluated and results are given for all asymptotic distance ranges; these\neffects describe the hyperfine modification of the interaction, or, expressed\ndifferently, the shift of the hydrogen 2S hyperfine frequency due to\ninteractions with neighboring 1S atoms. The 2S hyperfine frequency has recently\nbeen measured very accurately in atomic beam experiments.\n", "  The interaction of two excited hydrogen atoms in metastable states\nconstitutes a theoretically interesting problem because of the quasi-degenerate\n2P_{1/2} levels which are removed from the 2S states only by the Lamb shift.\nThe total Hamiltonian of the system is composed of the van der Waals\nHamiltonian, the Lamb shift and the hyperfine effects. The van der Waals shift\nbecomes commensurate with the 2S-2P_{3/2} fine-structure splitting only for\nclose approach (R < 100 a_0, where a_0 is the Bohr radius) and one may thus\nrestrict the discussion to the levels with n=2 and J=1/2 to good approximation.\nBecause each S or P state splits into an F=1 triplet and an F=0 hyperfine\nsinglet (eight states for each atom), the Hamiltonian matrix {\\em a priori} is\nof dimension 64. A careful analysis of symmetries the problem allows one to\nreduce the dimensionality of the most involved irreducible submatrix to 12. We\ndetermine the Hamiltonian matrices and the leading-order van der Waals shifts\nfor states which are degenerate under the action of the unperturbed Hamiltonian\n(Lamb shift plus hyperfine structure). The leading first- and second-order van\nder Waals shifts lead to interaction energies proportional to 1/R^3 and 1/R^6\nand are evaluated within the hyperfine manifolds. When both atoms are\nmetastable 2S states, we find an interaction energy of order E_h chi (a_0/R)^6,\nwhere E_h and L are the Hartree and Lamb shift energies, respectively, and chi\n= E_h/L ~ 6.22 \\times 10^6 is their ratio.\n", "  We use the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain WFC3/F390W imaging of the\nsupergroup SG1120-1202 at z=0.37, mapping the UV emission of 138\nspectroscopically confirmed members. We measure total (F390W-F814W) colors and\nvisually classify the UV morphology of individual galaxies as \"clumpy\" or\n\"smooth.\" Approximately 30% of the members have pockets of UV emission (clumpy)\nand we identify for the first time in the group environment galaxies with UV\nmorphologies similar to the jellyfish galaxies observed in massive clusters. We\nstack the clumpy UV members and measure a shallow internal color gradient,\nwhich indicates unobscured star formation is occurring throughout these\ngalaxies. We also stack the four galaxy groups and measure a strong trend of\ndecreasing UV emission with decreasing projected group distance ($R_{proj}$).\nWe find that the strong correlation between decreasing UV emission and\nincreasing stellar mass can fully account for the observed trend in\n(F390W-F814W) - $R_{proj}$, i.e., mass-quenching is the dominant mechanism for\nextinguishing UV emission in group galaxies. Our extensive multi-wavelength\nanalysis of SG1120-1202 indicates that stellar mass is the primary predictor of\nUV emission, but that the increasing fraction of massive (red/smooth) galaxies\nat $R_{proj}$ < 2$R_{200}$ and existence of jellyfish candidates is due to the\ngroup environment.\n", "  The quasiparticle (QP) energies, which are minus of the energies required by\nremoving or produced by adding one electron from/to the system, corresponding\nto the photoemission or inverse photoemission (PE/IPE) spectra, are determined\ntogether with the QP wave functions, which are not orthonormal and even not\nlinearly independent but somewhat similar to the normal spin orbitals in the\ntheory of the configuration interaction, by self-consistently solving the QP\nequation coupled with the equation for the self-energy. The electron density,\nkinetic and all interaction energies can be calculated using the QP wave\nfunctions. We prove in a simple way that the PE/IPE spectroscopy and therefore\nthis QP theory can be applied to an arbitrary initial excited eigenstate. In\nthis proof, we show that the energy-dependence of the self-energy is not an\nessential difficulty, and the QP picture holds exactly if there is no\nrelaxation mechanism in the system. The validity of the present theory for some\ninitial excited eigenstates is tested using the one-shot GW approximation for\nseveral atoms and molecules.\n", "  We perform a Hamiltonian analysis and prove that a large class of\nscalar-tensor theories whose Lagrangian is given by a generic function\n$F\\left(K_{ab},N,R_{ab},h^{ab},\\nabla_a,t\\right)$ is free from the Ostrogradsky\nghost, and thus these theories contain at most 3 degrees of freedom at\nclassical level.\n", "  The double polarization observable $E$ and the helicity dependent cross\nsections $\\sigma_{1/2}$ and $\\sigma_{3/2}$ were measured for $\\eta$\nphotoproduction from quasi-free protons and neutrons. The circularly polarized\ntagged photon beam of the A2 experiment at the Mainz MAMI accelerator was used\nin combination with a longitudinally polarized deuterated butanol target. The\nalmost $4\\pi$ detector setup of the Crystal Ball and TAPS is ideally suited to\ndetect the recoil nucleons and the decay photons from $\\eta\\rightarrow 2\\gamma$\nand $\\eta\\rightarrow 3\\pi^0$. The results show that the narrow structure\npreviously observed in $\\eta$ photoproduction from the neutron is only apparent\nin $\\sigma_{1/2}$ and hence, most likely related to a spin-1/2 amplitude.\nNucleon resonances that contribute to this partial wave in $\\eta$ production\nare only $N1/2^-$ ($S_{11}$) and $N1/2^+$ ($P_{11}$). Furthermore, the\nextracted Legendre coefficients of the angular distributions for $\\sigma_{1/2}$\nare in good agreement with recent reaction model predictions assuming a narrow\nresonance in the $P_{11}$ wave as the origin of this structure.\n", "  The precise determination of the CKM matrix element $\\left| V_{cb}\\right|$ is\nimportant for carrying out tests of the flavour sector of the Standard Model.\nIn this article we present a preliminary analysis of the $\\bar B^0 \\to D^{*\\,+}\n\\, \\ell^- \\, \\bar \\nu_\\ell$ decay mode and its charge conjugate, selected in\nevents that contain a fully reconstructed $B$-meson, using 772 million $e^+ \\,\ne^- \\to \\Upsilon(4S) \\to B \\bar B$ events recorded by the Belle detector at\nKEKB. Unfolded differential decay rates of four kinematic variables fully\ndescribing the $\\bar B^0 \\to D^{*\\,+} \\, \\ell^- \\, \\bar \\nu_\\ell$ decay in the\n$B$-meson rest frame are presented. We measure the total branching fraction\n$\\mathcal{B}( \\bar B^0 \\to D^{*\\,+} \\, \\ell^- \\, \\bar \\nu_\\ell ) = \\left(4.95\n\\pm 0.11 \\pm 0.22 \\right) \\times 10^{-2}$, where the errors are statistical and\nsystematic respectively. The value of $\\left|V_{cb} \\right|$ is determined to\nbe $\\left( 37.4 \\pm 1.3 \\right) \\times 10^{-3}$. Both results are in good\nagreement with current world averages.\n", "  We have used Spitzer images of a sample of 68 barred spiral galaxies in the\nlocal universe to make systematic measurements of bar length and bar strength.\nWe combine these with precise determinations of the corotation radii associated\nwith the bars, taken from our previous study which used the phase change from\nradial inflow to radial outflow of gas at corotation, based on high resolution\ntwo-dimensional velocity fields in H{\\alpha} taken with a Fabry-P\\'erot\nspectrometer. After presenting the histograms of the derived bar parameters, we\nstudy their dependence on the galaxy morphological type and on the total\nstellar mass of the host galaxy, and then produce a set of parametric plots.\nThese include the bar pattern speed versus bar length, the pattern speed\nnormalized with the characteristic pattern speed of the outer disk versus the\nbar strength, and the normalized pattern speed versus R, the ratio of\ncorotation radius to bar length. To provide guide-lines for our interpretation\nwe used a recently published simulations, including disk and dark matter halo\ncomponents. Our most striking conclusion is that bars with values of R < 1.4,\npreviously considered dynamically fast rotators, can be among the slowest\nrotators both in absolute terms and when their pattern speeds are normalized.\nThe simulations confirm that this is because as the bars are braked they can\ngrow longer more quickly than the outward drift of the corotation radius. We\nconclude that dark matter halos have indeed slowed down the rotation of bars on\nGyr timescales.\n", "  In this article we review the present status of alpha clustering in nuclear\nsystems. First of all, an important aspect is condensation in nuclear matter.\nSecond, the alpha container model, recently been proposed by\nTohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-Roepke (THSR), will be outlined and the ensuing\ncondensate aspect of the Hoyle state at 7.65 MeV in 12C will be investigated in\nsome detail. After 15 years since the proposal of the alpha condensation\nconcept a critical assessment of this idea will be given. Alpha gas states in\nother nuclei like 16O and 13C will be considered. The THSR wave function can\nalso describe configurations of one alpha particle on top of a doubly magic\ncore. The cases of 20Ne and 212Po will be investigated.\n", "  We demonstrate wide-angle, broadband and efficient reflection holography by\nutilizing coupled dipole-patch nano-antenna cells to impose an arbitrary phase\nprofile on of the reflected light. High fidelity images were projected at\nangles of 450 and 200 with respect to the impinging light with efficiencies\nranging between 40%-50% over an optical bandwidth exceeding 180nm. Excellent\nagreement with the theoretical predictions was found at a wide spectral range.\nThe demonstration of such reflectarrays opens new avenues towards expanding the\nlimits of large angle holography.\n", "  We use ultradeep 20 cm data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and 850\nmicron data from SCUBA-2 and the Submillimeter Array of an 124 arcmin^2 region\nof the Chandra Deep Field-north to analyze the high radio power (P_20cm>10^31\nerg s^-1 Hz^-1) population. We find that 20 (42+/-9%) of the spectroscopically\nidentified z>0.8 sources have consistent star formation rates (SFRs) inferred\nfrom both submillimeter and radio observations, while the remaining sources\nhave lower (mostly undetected) submillimeter fluxes, suggesting that active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN) activity dominates the radio power in these sources. We\ndevelop a classification scheme based on the ratio of submillimeter flux to\nradio power versus radio power and find that it agrees with AGN and\nstar-forming galaxy classifications from Very Long Baseline Interferometry. Our\nresults provide support for an extremely rapid drop in the number of high SFR\ngalaxies above about a thousand solar masses per year (Kroupa initial mass\nfunction) and for the locally determined relation between X-ray luminosity and\nradio power for star-forming galaxies applying at high redshifts and high radio\npowers. We measure far-infrared (FIR) luminosities and find that some AGNs lie\non the FIR-radio correlation, while others scatter below. The AGNs that lie on\nthe correlation appear to do so based on their emission from the AGN torus. We\nmeasure a median radio size of 1.0+/-0.3 arcsecond for the star-forming\ngalaxies. The radio sizes of the star-forming galaxies are generally larger\nthan those of the AGNs.\n", "  We present results from a near/mid IR search for submillimetre galaxies over\na region of 6230 sq deg. of the southern sky. We used a cross-correlation of\nthe VISTA Hemispheric Survey (VHS) and the WISE database to identify bright\ngalaxies (K_s <= 18.2) with near/mid IR colours similar to those of the high\nredshift lensed sub-mm galaxy SMM J2135-0102. We find 7 galaxies which fulfill\nall five adopted near/mid IR colour (NMIRQC) criteria and resemble the SED of\nthe reference galaxy at these wavelengths. For these galaxies, which are\nbroadly distributed in the sky, we determined photometric redshifts in the\nrange z=1.6-3.2. We searched the VHS for clusters of galaxies, which may be\nacting as gravitational lenses, and found that 6 out of the 7 galaxies are\nlocated within 3.5 arcmin of a cluster/group of galaxies. Using the J-K_s vs J\nsequences we determine photometric redshifts for these clusters/groups in the\nrange z=0.2-0.9. We propose the newly identified sources are ultra-bright high\nredshift lensed SMG candidates. Follow-up observations in the sub-mm and mm are\nkey to determine the ultimate nature of these objects.\n", "  We present a 30h integration Very Large Telescope X-shooter spectrum of the\nLyman series forest towards the $z = 7.084$ quasar ULAS J1120+0641. The only\ndetected transmission at ${\\rm S/N}>5$ is confined to seven narrow spikes in\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ forest, over the redshift range $5.858<z<6.122$, just longward\nof the wavelength of the onset of the Ly$\\beta$ forest. There is also a\npossible detection of one further unresolved spike in the Ly$\\beta$ forest at\n$z=6.854$, with ${\\rm S/N}=4.5$. We also present revised Hubble Space Telescope\nF814W photometry of the source. The summed flux from the transmission spikes is\nin agreement with the F814W photometry, so all the transmission in the Lyman\nseries forest may have been detected. There is a Gunn-Peterson (GP) trough in\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ forest from $z=6.122$ all the way to the quasar near zone at\n$z=7.04$. The trough, of comoving length $240\\,h^{-1}$Mpc, is over twice as\nlong as the next longest known GP trough. We combine the spectroscopic and\nphotometric results to constrain the evolution of the Ly$\\alpha$ effective\noptical depth with redshift, $\\tau_{\\rm GP}^{\\rm eff}$ extending a similar\nanalysis by Simpson et al. We find $\\tau_{\\rm GP}^{\\rm eff} \\propto\n(1+z)^{\\xi}$ where $\\xi = 11.2^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$, for $z > 5.5$. The data\nnevertheless provide only a weak limit on the volume-weighted hydrogen\nintergalactic (IGM) neutral fraction at $z\\sim 6.5$, $x_{{\\rm HI}} > 10^{-4}$,\nsimilar to limits at redshift $z\\sim6$ from less distant quasars. The new\nobservations cannot extend measurements of the neutral fraction of the IGM to\nhigher values because absorption in the Ly$\\alpha$ forest is already saturated\nnear $z\\sim6$. For higher neutral fractions, other methods such as measuring\nthe red damping wing of the IGM will be required.\n", "  We consider a five dimensional AdS spacetime with two 3-brane scenario where\nthe hidden brane contains a certain amount of positive constant energy density.\nIn this model, we examine the possibility of modulus stabilization. Our result\nreveals that the non-zero value of \"hidden brane energy density\" is sufficient\nto stabilize the two brane system. Moreover we scan the parametric space for\nwhich the modulus (or radion) is going to be stabilized without sacrificing the\nconditions necessary to solve the gauge hierarchy problem. Finally we obtain\nthe mass and coupling parameters of radion field in this higher dimensional\nbraneworld scenario.\n", "  In this work, we used a tool of conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method to\ndetermine bound state solution of Schrodinger equation with quantum interaction\npotential called Hulthen-Yukawa inversely quadratic potential (HYIQP). We\nobtained the energy eigen values and the total wave function . We employed\nHellmann-Feynmann Theorem (HFT) to compute expectation values for four\ndifferent diatomic molecules: Hydrogen molecule (H2), Lithium hydride molecule\n(LiH), Hydrogen Chloride molecule (HCl) and Carbon(II)Oxide molecule. The\nresulting energy equation reduces to three well known potentials which are:\nHulthen potential, Yukawa potential and inversely quadratic potential. We\nobtained the numerical bound state energies of the expectation values by\nimplementing Matlab algorithm using experimentally determined spectroscopic\nconstant for the different diatomic molecules. We developed a mathematica\nprogramming to obtain wave function and probability density plots for different\norbital angular quantum number.\n", "  This study is concerned with the dynamical behaviors of epidemic spreading\nover a two-layered interconnected network. Three models in different levels are\nproposed to describe cooperative spreading processes over the interconnected\nnetwork, wherein the disease in one network can spread to the other.\nTheoretical analysis is provided for each model to reveal that the global\nepidemic threshold in the interconnected network is not larger than the\nepidemic thresholds for the two isolated layered networks. In particular, in an\ninterconnected homogenous network, detailed theoretical analysis is presented,\nwhich allows quick and accurate calculations of the global epidemic threshold.\nMoreover, in an interconnected heterogeneous network with inter-layer\ncorrelation between node degrees, it is found that the inter-layer correlation\ncoefficient has little impact on the epidemic threshold, but has significant\nimpact on the total prevalence. Simulations further verify the analytical\nresults, showing that cooperative epidemic processes promote the spreading of\ndiseases.\n", "  We study the multi-particle Anderson model in the continuum and show that\nunder some mild assumptions on the random external potential and the\ninter-particle interaction, for any finite number of particles, the\nmulti-particle lower edges of the spectrum are almost surely constant in\nabsence of ergodicity. We stress that this result is not quite obvious and has\nto be handled carefully. In addition, we prove the spectral exponential and the\nstrong dynamical localization of the continuous multi-particle Anderson model\nat low energy. The proof based on the multi-particle multi-scale analysis\nbounds, needs the values of the external random potential to be independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) whose common probability distribution is at\nleast Log-H\\\"older continuous.\n", "  Robust control design for quantum systems has been recognized as a key task\nin quantum information technology, molecular chemistry and atomic physics. In\nthis paper, an improved differential evolution algorithm of msMS_DE is proposed\nto search robust fields for various quantum control problems. In msMS_DE,\nmultiple samples are used for fitness evaluation and a mixed strategy is\nemployed for mutation operation. In particular, the msMS_DE algorithm is\napplied to the control problem of open inhomogeneous quantum ensembles and the\nconsensus problem of a quantum network with uncertainties. Numerical results\nare presented to demonstrate the excellent performance of the improved DE\nalgorithm for these two classes of quantum robust control problems.\nFurthermore, msMS_DE is experimentally implemented on femtosecond laser control\nsystems to generate good signals of two photon absorption and control\nfragmentation of halomethane molecules CH2BrI. Experimental results demonstrate\nexcellent performance of msMS_DE in searching effective femtosecond laser\npulses for various tasks.\n", "  We study the processes in a quantum dot and its surrounds under resonant\nexcitation with the addition of weak non-resonant light. We observe a decrease\nin inhomogeneous emission linewidth, as well as previously observed enhancement\nof resonant fluorescence (RF). Scanning excitation and detection frequencies,\nwe distinguish between homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. Monte Carlo\nsimulations model the enhanced RF only if we include charge-carrier loss from\nthe quantum dot induced by the resonant laser. The cause of the linewidth\nnarrowing is predominantly independent of the enhanced RF.\n", "  We present bipartiteSUSY, a Mathematica package designed to perform\ncalculations for physical theories based on bipartite graphs. In particular,\nthe package can employ the recently developed arsenal of techniques surrounding\non-shell diagrams in N=4 SYM scattering amplitudes, including those for\nnon-planar diagrams, with particular attention to computational speed. It also\ncontains a host of tools for computations in N=1 Bipartite Field Theories,\nwhich utilize the same bipartite graphs. Through the use of an interactive\ngraphical tool, it is possible to draw the desired diagrams on the screen and\ncompute commonly sought-after features. The package should be easily accessible\nto users with little or no previous experience in dealing with bipartite graphs\nand their combinatorial descriptions.\n", "  We present analytical solutions to a quantum-mechanical three-body problem in\nthree dimensions, which describes a helium-like two-electron atom. Similarly to\nHooke's atom, the Coulombic electron-nucleus interaction potentials are\nreplaced by harmonic potentials. The electron-electron interaction potential is\ntaken to be both screened (decaying faster than the inverse of the\ninterparticle separation) and regularized (in the limit of zero separation). We\nreveal the exactly solvable few-electron ground state, which explicitly\nincludes electron correlation, for certain values of the harmonic containment.\n", "  We consider the chemotaxis problem for a one-dimensional system. To analyze\nthe interaction of bacteria and attractant we use a modified Keller-Segel model\nwhich accounts attractant absorption. To describe the system we use the\nchemotaxis sensitivity function, which characterizes nonuniformity of bacteria\ndistribution. In particular, we investigate how the chemotaxis sensitivity\nfunction depends on the concentration of attractant at the boundary of the\nsystem. It is known that in the system without absorption the chemotaxis\nsensitivity function has a bell shape maximum. Here we show that attractant\nabsorption and special boundary conditions for bacteria can cause the\nappearance of an additional maximum in the chemotaxis sensitivity function. The\nvalue of this maximum is determined by the intensity of absorption.\n", "  Superbolides, i.e. extremely bright meteors produced by entries of\nmeter-sized bodies into terrestrial atmosphere, are rare events. We present\nhere detailed analysis of a superbolide, which occurred over Romania on January\n7, 2015. The trajectory, velocity, and orbit were determined using two all-sky\nphotographs from a station of the European Fireball Network (EN) in Slovakia\nand five casual video records from Romania, which were carefully calibrated.\nBolide light curve was measured by EN radiometers. We found that the entry\nspeed was 27.76 $\\pm$ 0.19 km/s, significantly lower than reported by US\nGovernment sensors. The orbit was asteroidal with low inclination and aphelion\ninside Jupiter's orbit. The atmospheric behavior was, however, not typical for\nan asteroidal body. The peak brightness of absolute magnitude of -21 was\nreached at a quite large height of 42.8 km and the brightness then decreased\nquickly. The bolide almost disappeared at a height of 38.7 km, leaving just a\nstationary luminous trail visible for several seconds. Only one small fragment\ncontinued until the height of 36 km. Brief meteorite searches were\nunsuccessful. The modeling of the light curve revealed that the body of initial\nmass of about 4500 kg remained almost intact until the dynamic pressure reached\n0.9 MPa but it was then quickly disintegrated into many tiny fragments and dust\nunder 1-3 MPa. A comparison was made with three other superbolides for which we\nhave radiometric light curves: ordinary chondrite fall Ko\\v{s}ice, carbonaceous\nchondrite fall Maribo, and cometary Taurid bolide of October 31, 2015. The\nRomanian superbolide was not similar to any of these and represents probably a\nnew type of material with intrinsic strength of about 1 MPa.\n", "  In the animal world, the competition between individuals belonging to\ndifferent species for a resource often requires the cooperation of several\nindividuals in groups. This paper proposes a generalization of the Hawk-Dove\nGame for an arbitrary number of agents: the N-person Hawk-Dove Game. In this\nmodel, doves exemplify the cooperative behavior without intraspecies conflict,\nwhile hawks represent the aggressive behavior. In the absence of hawks, doves\nshare the resource equally and avoid conflict, but having hawks around lead to\ndoves escaping without fighting. Conversely, hawks fight for the resource at\nthe cost of getting injured. Nevertheless, if doves are present in sufficient\nnumber to expel the hawks, they can aggregate to protect the resource, and thus\navoid being plundered by hawks. We derive and numerically solve an exact\nequation for the evolution of the system in both finite and infinite well-mixed\npopulations, finding the conditions for stable coexistence between both\nspecies. Furthermore, by varying the different parameters, we found a scenario\nof bifurcations that leads the system from dominating hawks and coexistence to\nbi-stability, multiple interior equilibria and dominating doves.\n", "  Since the majority of massive stars are members of binary systems, an\nunderstanding of the intricacies of binary interactions is essential for\nunderstanding the large variety of supernova types and sub-types. I therefore\nbriefly review the basic elements of binary evolution theory and discuss how\nbinary interactions affect the presupernova structure of massive stars and the\nresulting supernovae.\n  SN 1987A was a highly anomalous supernova, almost certainly because of a\nprevious binary interaction. The most likely scenario at present is that the\nprogenitor was a member of a massive close binary that experienced dynamical\nmass transfer during its second red-supergiant phase and merged completely with\nits companion as a consequence. This can naturally explain the three main\nanomalies of SN 1987A: the blue color of the progenitor, the chemical anomalies\nand the complex triple-ring nebula.\n", "  We study the quantum speed limit time for a two-qubit system interacts with\nindepen- dent and common reservoir. The system is initially prepared in a class\nof X-structure density matrix, namely the extended Werner-like states (EWL). We\ndemonstrate that when reservoir enters to the non-Markovian regime, the quantum\nspeed limit time de- crease more sharply in a common reservoir than independent\nreservoirs.\n", "  Waves can be used to probe and image an unknown medium. Passive imaging uses\nambient noise sources to illuminate the medium. This paper considers passive\nimaging with moving sensors. The motivation is to generate large synthetic\napertures, which should result in enhanced resolution. However Doppler effects\nand lack of reciprocity significantly affect the imaging process. This paper\ndiscusses the consequences in terms of resolution and it shows how to design\nappropriate imaging functions depending on the sensor trajectory and velocity.\n", "  Metal-support interactions are frequently invoked to explain the enhanced\ncatalytic activity of metal nanoparticles dispersed over reducible metal-oxide\nsupports, yet the atomic scale mechanisms are rarely known. Here, we use\nscanning tunneling microscopy to study a Pt1-6/Fe3O4 model catalyst exposed to\nCO, H2, O2, and mixtures thereof, at 550 K. CO extracts lattice oxygen at the\ncluster perimeter to form CO2, creating large holes in the metal-oxide surface.\nH2 and O2 dissociate on the metal clusters and spill over onto the support. The\nformer creates create surface hydroxyl groups, which react with the support to\ndesorb water, while atomic oxygen reacts with Fe from the bulk to create new\nFe3O4(001) islands. The presence of the Pt is crucial because it catalyses\nreactions that already occur on the bare iron-oxide surface, but at higher\ntemperatures.\n", "  We demonstrate three-dimensional (3-D) nanoimprint lithography using master\nsamples initially structured by two-photon lithography. Complex geometries like\nmicro prisms, micro parabolic concentrators, micro lenses and other micrometer\nsized objects with nanoscale features are three-dimensionally fabricated using\ntwo-photon lithography. Stamps made out of polydimethylsiloxane are then cast\nusing the two-photon lithographically structured samples as master samples.\nHereby, expensive serial nano 3-D printing is transformed into scalable\nparallel 3-D nanoimprint lithography. Furthermore, the transition from\ntwo-photon lithography to imprint lithography increases the freedom in\nsubstrate and ink choice significantly. We demonstrate printing on textured\nsurfaces as well as residue-free printing with silver ink using capillary\naction.\n", "  Several examples suggest the conjecture that the central aspect determining a\nmonotonic evolution for perturbed highly symmetric thin-shells is the\napproximation adopted for their equations of state.\n", "  Optomagnonics and optomechanics have various applications ranging from\ntunable light sources to optical manipulation for quantum information science.\nHere, we propose a hybrid system with the interaction between phonon and magnon\nwhich could be tuned by the electromagnetic field based on the radiation\npressure and magneto-optical effect. The self energy of the magnon and phonon\ninduced by the electromagnetic field and the influence of the thermal noise are\nstudied. Moreover, the topological features of the hybrid system is illustrated\nwith resort to the dynamical encircling with the exceptional points, and the\nchiral characteristics under these encirclements are found.\n", "  Multi-principle element alloys have enormous potential, but their exploration\nsuffers from the tremendously large range of configurations. In the last decade\nsuch alloys have been designed with a focus on random solid solutions. Here we\napply an experimentally verified, combined thermodynamic and first-principles\ndesign strategy to reverse the traditional approach and to generate a new type\nof hcp Al-Hf-Sc-Ti-Zr high entropy alloy with a hitherto unique structure. A\nphase diagram analysis narrows down the large compositional space to a\nwell-defined set of candidates. First-principles calculations demonstrate the\nenergetic preference of an ordered superstructure over the competing disordered\nsolid solutions. The chief ingredient is the Al concentration, which can be\ntuned to achieve a D019 ordering of the hexagonal lattice. The computationally\ndesigned D019 superstructure is experimentally confirmed by transmission\nelectron microscopy and X-ray studies. Our scheme enables the exploration of a\nnew class of high entropy alloys.\n", "  We demonstrate how students' use of modeling can be examined and assessed\nusing student notebooks collected from an upper-division electronics lab\ncourse. The use of models is a ubiquitous practice in undergraduate physics\neducation, but the process of constructing, testing, and refining these models\nis much less common. We focus our attention on a lab course that has been\ntransformed to engage students in this modeling process during lab activities.\nThe design of the lab activities was guided by a framework that captures the\ndifferent components of model-based reasoning, called the Modeling Framework\nfor Experimental Physics. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to\nassess students' written work and to identify how students' model-based\nreasoning differed from activity to activity. Broadly speaking, we were able to\nidentify the different steps of students' model-based reasoning and assess the\ncompleteness of their reasoning. Varying degrees of scaffolding present across\nthe activities had an impact on how thoroughly students would engage in the\nfull modeling process, with more scaffolded activities resulting in more\nthorough engagement with the process. Finally, we identified that the step in\nthe process with which students had the most difficulty was the comparison\nbetween their interpreted data and their model prediction. Students did not use\nsufficiently sophisticated criteria in evaluating such comparisons, which had\nthe effect of halting the modeling process. This may indicate that in order to\nengage students further in using model-based reasoning during lab activities,\nthe instructor needs to provide further scaffolding for how students make these\ntypes of experimental comparisons. This is an important design consideration\nfor other such courses attempting to incorporate modeling as a learning goal.\n", "  Several growth models have been proposed in the literature for scale-free\ncomplex networks, with a range of fitness-based attachment models gaining\nprominence recently. However, the processes by which such fitness-based\nattachment behaviour can arise are less well understood, making it difficult to\ncompare the relative merits of such models. This paper analyses an evolutionary\nmechanism that would give rise to a fitness-based attachment process. In\nparticular, it is proven by analytical and numerical methods that in\nhomogeneous networks, the minimisation of maximum exposure to node unfitness\nleads to attachment probabilities that are proportional to node fitness. This\nresult is then extended to heterogeneous networks, with supply chain networks\nbeing used as an example.\n", "  A general methodology is proposed to differentiate the likelihood of\nenergetic-particle-driven instabilities to produce frequency chirping or\nfixed-frequency oscillations. The method employs numerically calculated\neigenstructures and multiple resonance surfaces of a given mode in the presence\nof energetic ion drag and stochasticity (due to collisions and\nmicro-turbulence). Toroidicity-induced, reversed-shear and beta-induced\nAlfven-acoustic eigenmodes are used as examples. Waves measured in experiments\nare characterized and compatibility is found between the proposed criterion\npredictions and the experimental observation or lack of observation of chirping\nbehavior of Alfvenic modes in different tokamaks. It is found that the\nstochastic diffusion due to micro-turbulence can be the dominant energetic\nparticle detuning mechanism near the resonances in many plasma experiments, and\nits strength is the key as to whether chirping solutions are likely to arise.\nThe proposed criterion constitutes a useful predictive tool in assessing\nwhether the nature of the transport for fast ion losses in fusion devices will\nbe dominated by convective or diffusive processes.\n", "  The Lorenz attractor was introduced in 1963 by E. N. Lorenz as one of the\nfirst examples of \\emph{strange attractors}. However Lorenz' research was\nmainly based on (non-rigourous) numerical simulations and, until recently, the\nproof of the existence of the Lorenz attractor remained elusive. To address\nthat problem some authors introduced geometric Lorenz models and proved that\ngeometric Lorenz models have a strange attractor. In 2002 it was shown that the\noriginal Lorenz model behaves like a geometric Lorenz model and thus has a\nstrange attractor. In this paper we show that geometric Lorenz attractors are\ncomputable, as well as their physical measures.\n", "  The Subarcsecond Telescope And BaLloon Experiment, STABLE, is the fine stage\nof a guidance system for a high-altitude ballooning platform designed to\ndemonstrate subarcsecond pointing stability, over one minute using relatively\ndim guide stars in the visible spectrum. The STABLE system uses an attitude\nrate sensor and the motion of the guide star on a detector to control a Fast\nSteering Mirror in order to stabilize the image. The characteristics of the\nthermal-optical-mechanical elements in the system directly affect the quality\nof the point spread function of the guide star on the detector, and so, a\nseries of thermal, structural, and optical models were built to simulate system\nperformance and ultimately inform the final pointing stability predictions.\nThis paper describes the modeling techniques employed in each of these\nsubsystems. The results from those models are discussed in detail, highlighting\nthe development of the worst-case cold and hot cases, the optical metrics\ngenerated from the finite element model, and the expected STABLE residual\nwavefront error and decenter. Finally, the paper concludes with the predicted\nsensitivities in the STABLE system, which show that thermal deadbanding,\nstructural preloading and self-deflection under different loading conditions,\nand the speed of individual optical elements were particularly important to the\nresulting STABLE optical performance.\n", "  The mechanisms of phase change of argon during picosecond laser internal\nablation are studied using molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that\npropagation of stress wave and fluctuation of temperature are periodical. The\nphase change process from solid to liquid to supercritical fluid then back to\nsolid occurs as combined results of heating and the propagation of tensile\nstress wave induced by the laser pulse and the limited internal space.\n", "  Here is the first part of the summary of my work on random Ising model using\nreal-space renormalization group (RSRG), also known as a Migdal-Kadanoff one.\nThis approximate renormalization scheme was applied to the analysis\nthermodynamic properties of the model, and of probabilistic properties of a\npair correlator, which is a fluctuating object in disordered systems.\n  PACS numbers: 02.50.-r, 05.20.-y, 05.70.Fh, 64.60.ae, 75.10.-b, 75.10.Hk,\n87.10.+e\n  Keywords: statistical physics, magnetism, spin glass, neural networks\n", "  In a recent paper by Lasseux, Vald\\'{e}s-Parada and Porter (J.~Fluid~Mech.\n\\textbf{805} (2016) 118-146), it is found that the apparent gas permeability of\nthe porous media is a nonlinear function of the Knudsen number. However, this\nresult is highly questionable, because the adopted Navier-Stokes equations and\nthe first-order velocity-slip boundary condition are first-order (in terms of\nthe Knudsen number) approximations of the Boltzmann equation and the kinetic\nboundary condition for rarefied gas flows. Our numerical simulations based on\nthe Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook kinetic equation and regularized 20-moment equations\nprove that the Navier-Stokes equations with the first-order velocity-slip\nboundary condition are only accurate at a very small Knudsen number limit,\nwhere the apparent gas permeability is a linear function of the Knudsen number.\n", "  We present a two-species laser cooling apparatus capable of simultaneously\ncollecting Rb and Hg atomic gases into a magneto-optical trap (MOT). The atomic\nsources, laser system, and vacuum set-up are described. While there is a loss\nof Rb atoms in the MOT due to photoionization by the Hg cooling laser, we show\nthat it does not prevent simultaneous trapping of Rb and Hg. We also\ndemonstrate interspecies collision-induced losses in the\n${}^{87}$Rb-${}^{202}$Hg system.\n", "  High-quality entangled photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion have made great contributions to the modern quantum information\nscience and the fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. However, the quality of\nthe entangled states decreases sharply when moving from biphoton to multiphoton\nexperiments, mainly due to the lack of interactions between photons. Here, for\nthe first time, we generate a four-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state\nwith a fidelity of $98\\%$, which is even comparable to the best fidelity of\nbiphoton entangled states. Thus, it enables us to demonstrate an\nultrahigh-fidelity entanglement swapping---the key ingredient in various\nquantum information tasks. Our results push the fidelity of multiphoton\nentanglement generation to a new level and would be useful in some demanding\ntasks, e.g., we successfully demonstrate the genuine multipartite nonlocality\nof the observed state in the nonsignaling scenario by violating a novel\nHardy-like inequality, which requires very high state-fidelity.\n", "  A spectral technique is applied to evaluate the resonance frequencies of the\nfull retarded scattering from spherical nanoparticles. This approach allows one\nto unambiguously identify the modes that are responsible of both the peaks and\nthe asymmetric lineshapes of the scattered power spectra. The fundamental\ndifferences between the electromagnetic scattering properties of dielectric and\nmetal spheres are discussed. These results are used to investigate the\nscattering from isolated silicon and silver nanospheres.\n", "  We consider the possibility that the reactor antineutrino anomaly is due to a\nmiscalculation of one or more of the $^{235}\\text{U}$, $^{238}\\text{U}$,\n$^{239}\\text{Pu}$, and $^{241}\\text{Pu}$ reactor antineutrino fluxes. From the\nfit of the data we obtain the precise determination $\\sigma_{f,235} = ( 6.33\n\\pm 0.08 ) \\times 10^{-43} \\, \\text{cm}^2 / \\text{fission}$ of the\n$^{235}\\text{U}$ cross section per fission, which is more precise than the\ncalculated value and differs from it by $2.2\\sigma$. The cross sections per\nfission of the other fluxes have large uncertainties and in practice their\nvalues are undetermined by the fit. We conclude that it is very likely that at\nleast the calculation of the $^{235}\\text{U}$ flux must be revised.\n", "  Cholanaikkans are a diminishing tribe of India. With a population of less\nthan 200 members, this tribe living in the reserved forests about 80 km from\nKozhikode, it is one of the most isolated tribes. A programme of the Government\nof Kerala brings some of them to Kozhikode once a year. We studied various\naspects of the tribe during such a visit in 2016. We report their science and\ntechnology.\n", "  Gamma-ray emitting blazars have been the targets of many recent or ongoing\nmonitoring programmes. The resulting multi-wavelength data archives are ideal\nfor studying the quiescent and variable behaviour of the blazar PKS 2155-304.\nHere, observations of the optical polarization of the source between 2009 and\n2014 (> 5 years) are presented, together with overlapping radio, photometric\nand gamma-ray measurements. During this time the source displayed significant\nvariability at all wavelengths, with several prominent flares seen for the\noptical and gamma-ray intensity. These flares are typically associated with\nlarge rotations (>80{\\deg}) in the polarization angle, during which the\npolarization angle appears to be oriented parallel to the position angle of the\nspatially resolved radio jet. Our aim is to determine if these large\npolarization angle rotations are correlated to the multi-wavelength outbursts\nseen in PKS 2155-304 in order to examine how changes in the polarization angle\n(and its orientation relative to the jet) relate to changes in the spectral\nenergy distribution of the source.\n", "  The development of semilocal models for the kinetic energy density (KED) is\nan important topic in density functional theory (DFT). This is especially true\nfor subsystem DFT, where these models are necessary to construct the required\nnon-additive embedding contributions. In particular, these models can also be\nefficiently employed to replace the exact KED in meta-Generalized Gradient\nApproximation (meta-GGA) exchange-correlation functionals allowing to extend\nthe subsystem DFT applicability to the meta-GGA level of theory. Here, we\npresent a two-dimensional scan of semilocal KED models as linear functionals of\nthe reduced gradient and of the reduced Laplacian, for atoms and weakly-bound\nmolecular systems. We find that several models can perform well but in any case\nthe Laplacian contribution is extremely important to model the local features\nof the KED. Indeed a simple model constructed as the sum of Thomas-Fermi KED\nand 1/6 of the Laplacian of the density yields the best accuracy for atoms and\nweakly-bound molecular systems. These KED models are tested within subsystem\nDFT with various meta-GGA exchange-correlation functionals for non-bonded\nsystems, showing a good accuracy of the method.\n", "  We introduce a different perspective describing electron-phonon interactions\nin graphene based on curved space hydrodynamics. Interactions of phonons with\ncharge carriers increase the electrical resistivity of the material. Our\napproach captures the lattice vibrations as curvature changes in the space\nthrough which electrons move following hydrodynamic equations. In this picture,\ninertial corrections to the electronic flow arise naturally effectively\nproducing electron-phonon interactions. The strength of the interaction is\ncontrolled by a coupling constant, which is temperature independent. We apply\nthis model to graphene and recover satisfactorily the linear scaling law for\nthe resistivity that is expected at high temperatures. Our findings open up a\nnew perspective of treating electron-phonon interactions in graphene, and also\nin other materials where electrons can be described by the Fermi liquid theory.\n", "  Tens of millions of new variable objects are expected to be identified in\nover a billion time series from the Gaia mission. Crossmatching known variable\nsources with those from Gaia is crucial to incorporate current knowledge,\nunderstand how these objects appear in the Gaia data, train supervised\nclassifiers to recognise known classes, and validate the results of the\nVariability Processing and Analysis Coordination Unit (CU7) within the Gaia\nData Analysis and Processing Consortium (DPAC). The method employed by CU7 to\ncrossmatch variables for the first Gaia data release includes a binary\nclassifier to take into account positional uncertainties, proper motion,\ntargeted variability signals, and artefacts present in the early calibration of\nthe Gaia data. Crossmatching with a classifier makes it possible to automate\nall those decisions which are typically made during visual inspection. The\nclassifier can be trained with objects characterized by a variety of attributes\nto ensure similarity in multiple dimensions (astrometry, photometry,\ntime-series features), with no need for a-priori transformations to compare\ndifferent photometric bands, or of predictive models of the motion of objects\nto compare positions. Other advantages as well as some disadvantages of the\nmethod are discussed. Implementation steps from the training to the assessment\nof the crossmatch classifier and selection of results are described.\n", "  A variety of solitary waves, such as solitons, vortex rings, solitonic\nvortices, and more complex entities, have recently been predicted to exist.\nThey can move in superfluid ultracold gases along elongated traps. The\ntheoretical description of this motion requires knowledge of the inertial\nsoliton mass and the effective number of particles in it as functions of the\nsoliton energy. While these functions can be calculated by a microscopic\ntheory, it is also possible to express them directly in terms of observable\nquantities, such as the order parameter phase jump and the particle number\ndepletion in the soliton. In this article, the corresponding equations are\nderived in a simple and physically clear way and applied to the recently\npredicted `magnetic soliton' in mixtures of Bose gases in various spin states.\n", "  We review the THDM model in which one of the Higgs doublets does not develop\na vacuum expectation value. In this case, the Higgs fields with zero VEV does\nnot contribute to the physical masses of the SM particles, and hence, its\ninteractions with the SM particles can have more freedom than in the case of\nusual considerations on the THDM models. We show that the stability of the\nHiggs potential minima can be maintained. All the Higgs boson masses are found\nlighter than about 300 GeV in the low scale spectrum when v_1=0. Such light\nmass scales are in the detectable regime, and hence, the SM predictions and the\nexperimental results are essential to be applied in the analyses. Especially\nthe decay channels; h-->W^+ W^- and h-->bb exclude most of the solutions, while\nit is still possible to realize a small region, which coincides with the SM\npredictions. We highlight that it is also possible to realize an excess in h-->\ngamma gamma decay channel, even one applies the constraints from the Higgs\nboson decays into W^+ W^- and bb. In addition, if one assumes H is the SM-like\nHiggs boson of mass about 125 GeV, the solutions with m_h <~ 125 GeV can be\nacceptable. In this case, the solutions can still be realized consistent with\nthe SM predictions; however, an excess in H --> gamma gamma cannot be observed,\nwhile the implications for this channel in THDM can stay in the SM prediction\nrates at most. Even though the light masses of the Higgs bosons can be favored\nin resolution to discrepancy between the Standard Model and the experiment in\nthe muon anomalous magnetic moment measurements, we find that it is not\npossible to accommodate such a resolution with BR(b --> s gamma) results\nsimultaneously.\n", "  One of two postulates that are base for special relativity is that the laws\nof physics are invariant in all inertial systems, which has as a consequence\nthat it is impossible for an observer to detect his motion through space. It\nwill be shown that this is in a contradiction with the results of the\nHafele-Keating experiment, which established that time is going faster in an\nairplane going westward than in that going eastward, if compared with clocks\nlocated on Earth. The result of the experiment allows not only to conclude that\nEarth is rotating toward east, but also to calculate the speed of Earth motion.\nPerforming similar experiments it is also possible to measure Earth speed\naround the Sun, its speed in our galaxy, and actually its absolute speed. To\ngeneralize this for any inertial frame and to explain why an absolute speed can\nbe assigned to any inertial frame we introduced the triplets paradox.\n", "  We report on the performance of a vector apodizing phase plate coronagraph\nthat operates over a wavelength range of $2-5 \\mu$m and is installed in\nMagAO/Clio2 at the 6.5 m Magellan Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory,\nChile. The coronagraph manipulates the phase in the pupil to produce three\nbeams yielding two coronagraphic point-spread functions (PSFs) and one faint\nleakage PSF. The phase pattern is imposed through the inherently achromatic\ngeometric phase, enabled by liquid crystal technology and polarization\ntechniques. The coronagraphic optic is manufactured using a direct-write\ntechnique for precise control of the liquid crystal pattern, and multitwist\nretarders for achromatization. By integrating a linear phase ramp to the\ncoronagraphic phase pattern, two separated coronagraphic PSFs are created with\na single pupil-plane optic, which makes it robust and easy to install in\nexisting telescopes. The two coronagraphic PSFs contain a 180$^\\circ$ dark hole\non each side of a star, and these complementary copies of the star are used to\ncorrect the seeing halo close to the star. To characterize the coronagraph, we\ncollected a dataset of a bright ($m_L=0-1$) nearby star with $\\sim$1.5 hr of\nobserving time. By rotating and optimally scaling one PSF and subtracting it\nfrom the other PSF, we see a contrast improvement by 1.46 magnitudes at $3.5\n\\lambda/D$. With regular angular differential imaging at 3.9 $\\mu$m, the MagAO\nvector apodizing phase plate coronagraph delivers a $5\\sigma\\ \\Delta$ mag\ncontrast of 8.3 ($=10^{-3.3}$) at 2 $\\lambda/D$ and 12.2 ($=10^{-4.8}$) at $3.5\n\\lambda/D$.\n", "  We consider spinor representations of the conformal group. The spacetime is\nconstructed by the 15-dimensional vectors in the adjoint representation of\n$SO(2,4)$. On the spacetime, we construct a gravitational model that is\ninvariant under local transformation.\n", "  A three-dimensional semiclassical model is used to study double ionization of\nAr when driven by a near-infrared and near-single-cycle laser pulse for\nintensities ranging from 0.85$\\times$10$^{14}$ W/cm$^{2}$ to 5$\\times$10$^{14}$\nW/cm$^{2}$. Asymmetry parameters, distributions of the sum of the two electron\nmomentum components along the direction of the polarization of the laser field\nand correlated momenta are computed as a function of intensity and of the\ncarrier envelope phase. A very good agreement is found with recently obtained\nresults in kinematically complete experiments employing near-single-cycle laser\npulses. Moreover, the contribution of the direct and delayed pathways of double\nionization is investigated for the above observables. Finally, an\nexperimentally obtained anti-correlation momentum pattern at higher intensities\nis reproduced with the three-dimensional semiclassical model and shown to be\ndue to a transition from strong to soft recollisions with increasing intensity.\n", "  A recent paper of Dias and Silvera (DS) reports on production of metallic\nhydrogen in a diamond anvil cell at 495 GPa at 5.5 and 83 K. The results are\nimplied to have a great impact on energy and rocketry. Here we argue that the\npresented (very scarce) results are contradictory with the presented\nexperimental description making their claims unsupported experimentally.\nMoreover, the proposed implications are highly speculative making this paper\nvery confusing for a broad audience. Elucidating the claims and the related\nimplications is important for building a coherent picture that is currently\nemerging as the results of theoretical calculations at various levels and\nexperimental investigations employing static and dynamic compression\ntechniques. There is no doubt that hydrogen metallizes at high pressures. But\nthis does not make all claims about reaching this state immediately valid.\nScientific community would like to learn at what conditions hydrogen\nmetallizes, what is the nature of the conducting state and its properties (e.g.\nsuperconductivity). Here we argue that the presented data do not provide any\nreliable information on this.\n", "  In this work a design is proposed for an active, permanent magnet based,\nself-propelled magnetic bearing i.e. levitating motor having the following\nfeatures : (a) simple winding structure, (b) high load supporting capacity, (c)\nno eccentricity sensors, (d) stable confinement in all translational\ndimensions, (e) stable confinement in all rotational dimensions and (f) high\nefficiency. This design uses an architecture consisting of a helically wound\nthree-phase stator, and a rotor with the magnets also arranged in a helical\nmanner. Active control is used to excite the rotor at a torque angle lying in\nthe second quadrant. This torque angle is independent of the rotor's position\ninside the stator cavity hence the control algorithm is similar to that of a\nconventional permanent magnet synchronous motor. It is motivated through a\nphysical argument that the bearing rotor develops a lift force proportional to\nthe output torque and that it remains stably confined in space. These\nassertions are then proved rigorously through a calculation of the magnetic\nfields, forces and torques. The stiffness matrix of the system is presented and\na discussion of stable and unstable operating regions is given.\n", "  We introduce a general model for a network of quantum sensors, and we use\nthis model to consider the question: when do correlations (quantum or\nclassical) between quantum sensors enhance the precision with which the network\ncan measure an unknown set of parameters? We rigorously answer this question\nfor a range of practically important problems. When each sensor in the network\nmeasures a single parameter, we show that correlations between sensors cannot\nincrease the estimation precision beyond what can be achieved with an\nuncorrelated scheme, regardless of the particular details of the estimation\nproblem in question. We also consider the more general setting whereby each\nsensor may be used to measure multiple parameters, e.g., the three spatial\ncomponents of a magnetic field. In this case, we show that correlations between\nsensors can only provide, at best, a small constant precision enhancement, over\nuncorrelated estimation techniques. Finally, we consider optimizing the network\nfor measuring a single linear function of the unknown parameters, e.g., the\naverage of all of the parameters. Here quantum correlations between the sensors\ncan provide a significant precision enhancement over uncorrelated techniques,\nand this enhancement factor scales with the number of sensors. To illustrate\nthe broad implications of this work, we apply our results to a wide range of\nestimation problems of practical interest, including multi-mode optical\ninterferometry, networks of atomic sensors, and networks of clocks. Our\nfindings shed light on a number of results in the literature, provide a\nrigorous general framework for future research on networked quantum sensors,\nand have implications for both quantum multi-parameter estimation theory, and\nquantum sensing technologies.\n", "  Analysis of transient deformation events in time series data observed via\nnetworks of continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) ground stations provide\ninsight into the magmatic and tectonic processes that drive volcanic activity.\nTypical analyses of spatial positions originating from each station require\ncareful tuning of algorithmic parameters and selection of time and spatial\nregions of interest to observe possible transient events. This iterative,\nmanual process is tedious when attempting to make new discoveries and does not\neasily scale with the number of stations. Addressing this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel approach based on a computer-aided discovery system that\nfacilitates the discovery of such potential transient events. The advantages of\nthis approach are demonstrated by actual detections of transient deformation\nevents at volcanoes selected from the Alaska Volcano Observatory database using\ndata recorded by GPS stations from the Plate Boundary Observatory network. Our\ntechnique successfully reproduces the analysis of a transient signal detected\nin the first half of 2008 at Akutan volcano and is also directly applicable to\n3 additional volcanoes in Alaska, with the new detection of 2 previously\nunnoticed inflation events: in early 2011 at Westdahl and in early 2013 at\nShishaldin. This study also discusses the benefits of our computer-aided\ndiscovery approach for volcanology in general. Advantages include the rapid\nanalysis on multi-scale resolutions of transient deformation events at a large\nnumber of sites of interest and the capability to enhance reusability and\nreproducibility in volcano studies.\n", "  We formulate and solve the equations governing the dynamics of a microscopic\nartificial swimmer composed of a head and of a tail made of a thin film of\npermanent magnetic material. This is a variant of the model swimmer proposed by\nDreyfus et al. in 2005, whose tail is a filament obtained from the assembly of\nsuper-paramagnetic beads. The swimmer is actuated by an oscillating magnetic\nfield, and its geometry is inspired by that of sperm cells. Using values for\nthe geometric and material parameters that are realistic for a magnetic\nmultilayer, we show that the model swimmer can reach swimming speeds exceeding\none body length per second, under reasonable values of the driving magnetic\nfield. This provides a proof of principle for the viability of the concept. In\naddition, we discuss the possibility to steer the system along curved paths.\nFinally, we compare the propulsion mechanism (swimming `gait') of our swimmer\nwith that of sperm cells. The main difference between the two is that, contrary\nto its biological template, our artificial system does not rely on the\npropagation of bending waves along the tail, at least for the range of material\nand geometric parameters explored in this article.\n", "  This paper studies scenarios of cyclic dominance in a coevolutionary spatial\nmodel in which game strategies and links between agents adaptively evolve over\ntime. The Optional Prisoner's Dilemma (OPD) game is employed. The OPD is an\nextended version of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma where players have a\nthird option to abstain from playing the game. We adopt an agent-based\nsimulation approach and use Monte Carlo methods to perform the OPD with\ncoevolutionary rules. The necessary conditions to break the scenarios of cyclic\ndominance are also investigated. This work highlights that cyclic dominance is\nessential in the sustenance of biodiversity. Moreover, we also discuss the\nimportance of a spatial coevolutionary model in maintaining cyclic dominance in\nadverse conditions.\n", "  Our experiment shows that the thermal emission of phonon can be controlled by\nmagnetic resonance (MR) mode in a metasurface (MTS). Through changing the\nstructural parameter of metasurface, the MR wavelength can be tuned to the\nphonon resonance wavelength. This introduces a strong coupling between phonon\nand MR, which results in an anticrossing phonon-plasmons mode. In the process,\nwe can manipulate the polarization and angular radiation of thermal emission of\nphonon. Such metasurface provides a new kind of thermal emission structures for\nvarious thermal management applications.\n", "  We report a giant, ~22%, electroresistance modulation for a metallic alloy\nabove room temperature. It is achieved by a small electric field of 2 kV/cm via\npiezoelectric strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling and the resulting\nmagnetic phase transition in epitaxial FeRh/BaTiO3 heterostructures. This work\npresents detailed experimental evidence for an isothermal magnetic phase\ntransition driven by tetragonality modulation in FeRh thin films, which is in\ncontrast to the large volume expansion in the conventional temperature-driven\nmagnetic phase transition in FeRh. Moreover, all the experimental results in\nthis work illustrate FeRh as a mixed-phase model system well similar to\nphase-separated colossal magnetoresistance systems with phase instability\ntherein.\n", "  The mathematical foundation of the so-called extended coupled-cluster method\nfor the solution of the many-fermion Schr\\\"odinger equation is here developed.\nWe prove an existence and uniqueness result, both in the full\ninfinite-dimensional amplitude space as well as for discretized versions of it.\nThe extended coupled-cluster method is formulated as a critical point of an\nenergy function using a generalization of the Rayleigh-Ritz principle: the\nbivariational principle. This gives a quadratic bound for the energy error in\nthe discretized case. The existence and uniqueness results are proved using a\ntype of monotonicity property for the flipped gradient of the energy function.\nComparisons to the analysis of the standard coupled-cluster method is made, and\nit is argued that the bivariational principle is a useful tool, both for\nstudying coupled-cluster type methods, and for developing new computational\nschemes in general.\n", "  Two rings with currents ia and ib become magnets that can either attract or\nrepel each other. If mechanical work is extracted from this ring system, either\nby bringing closer the rings during an attraction or by separating them as the\nresult of a repulsion, the energy of the rings, the only existing source of\nenergy in the system, decreases: $\\frac{1}{2}LI_{a}^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}LI_{b}^{2}$\nIf an energy either of attraction or repulsion is communicated to the system,\n(working against the forces) its energy increases, i.e. the currents in the\nrings increase. This happens because the currents existing in the rings are\nfree, i.e. not linked to any device which imposes a current (power supply,\nconstant current). Similarly, the effect of electromagnetic induction can\nincrease or decrease the currents with the corresponding mechanical work linked\nto these developments. Not only does the current in the rings decrease as they\nget closer during the attraction, but it also can be cancelled and, if the\neffect continues, it may even change its direction. An application that already\nexists is the levitation train. It is attracted by the rail and held on it, but\nif it is very close to this due to the weight of the goods a strong repulsion\n(levitation) occurs. Another application would be the accumulation of energy in\nthese rings, where they can spend large amounts of current, not only because of\nits high critical currents but also by the fact that the magnetic flux remains\nconstant, cannot increase. Another advantage in this storage system is its\nreversibility in the exchange of electromagnetic energy and mechanical work. In\nthe energy storage system, the greater the current flowing through the ring,\nthe greater its energy is. In order to attain this, there has been made a study\nof the ideal conditions to store as much energy as possible.\n", "  We construct the analog of the Biot-Savart integral for bounded domains.\nSpecifically, we show that the velocity field of an incompressible fluid with\ntangency boundary conditions on a bounded domain can be written in terms of its\nvorticity using an integral kernel $K_\\Omega(x,y)$ that has an inverse-square\nsingularity on the diagonal.\n", "  We present an adaptive reduced-order model for the efficient time-resolved\nsimulation of fluid-structure interaction problems with complex and non-linear\ndeformations. The model is based on repeated linearizations of the structural\nbalance equations. Upon each linearization step, the number of unknowns is\nstrongly decreased by using modal reduction, which leads to a substantial gain\nin computational efficiency. Through adaptive re-calibration and truncation\naugmentation whenever a non-dimensional deformation threshold value is\nexceeded, we ensure that the reduced modal basis maintains arbitrary accuracy\nfor small and large deformations. Our novel model is embedded into a\npartitioned, loosely coupled finite volume - finite element framework, in which\nthe structural interface motion within the Eulerian fluid solver is accounted\nfor by a conservative cut-element immersed-boundary method. Applications to the\naeroelastic instability of a flat plate at supersonic speeds, to an elastic\npanel placed within a shock tube, and to the shock induced buckling of an\ninflated thin semi-sphere demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the\nmethod.\n", "  We derive the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the X-ray source population\ndetected in the Chandra observation of NGC4038/39 (the Antennae).\n  We explicitly include photon counting and spectral parameter uncertainties in\nour calculations. The cumulative XLF is well represented by a flat power law\n($\\alpha=-0.47$), similar to those describing the XLFs of other star-forming\nsystems (e.g. M82, the disk of M81), but different from those of early type\ngalaxies. This result associates the X-ray source population in the Antennae\nwith young High Mass X-ray Binaries. In comparison with less actively\nstar-forming galaxies, the XLF of the Antennae has a highly significant excess\nof sources with luminosities above 10^{39} erg\\s (Ultra Luminous Sources;\nULXs). We discuss the nature of these sources, based on the XLF and on their\ngeneral spectral properties, as well as their optical counterparts discussed in\nPaper III. We conclude that the majority of the ULXs cannot be intermediate\nmass black-holes (M > 10-1000 \\msun) binaries, unless they are linked to the\nremnants of massive Population III stars (the Madau & Rees model). Instead,\ntheir spatial and multiwavelength properties can be well explained by beamed\nemission as a consequence of supercritical accretion.\n  Binaries with a neutron star or moderate mass black-hole (up to 20\\msun), and\nB2 to A type star companions would be consistent with our data. In the beaming\nscenario, the XLF should exibit caracteristic breaks that will be visible in\nfuture deeper observations of the Antennae.\n"]}
