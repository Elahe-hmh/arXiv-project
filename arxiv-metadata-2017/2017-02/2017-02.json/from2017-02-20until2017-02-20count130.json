An incident gamma energy\nrange of O(1 keV) to O(1 MeV) and electric fields between 0 and O(10 kV/cm) are\nincorporated into this heuristic model. We show results from a Geant4\nimplementation, but because the model has a few free parameters, implementation\nin any simulation package should be simple. We use a quasi-empirical approach,\nwith an objective of improving detector calibrations and performance\nverification. The model will aid in the design and optimization of future\ndetectors. This model is also easy to extend to other noble elements. In this\npaper we lay the foundation for an exhaustive simulation code which we call\nNEST (Noble Element Simulation Technique).\n", "  Interference patterns associated with soliton-soliton interaction are\ninvestigated in detail. We find that the temporal and spatial interference\npatterns exhibit quite different characteristics. The period of the spatial\ninterference pattern is determined by the relative velocity of the solitons,\nand the temporal pattern behavior is determined by the peak amplitudes and the\nkinetic energy of the solitons. Analytical expressions for the periods of the\ninterference patterns are obtained. A method for classifying the nonlinearity\nof many nonlinear systems is proposed. As an example, we discuss possibilities\nto observe these properties of solitons in a nonlinear planar waveguide.\n", "  We study the feasibility of nearly-degenerate two-photon rovibrational\nspectroscopy in ensembles of trapped, sympathetically cooled hydrogen molecular\nions using a resonance-enhanced multiphoton dissociation (REMPD) scheme. Taking\nadvantage of quasi-coincidences in the rovibrational spectrum, the excitation\nlasers are tuned close to an intermediate level to resonantly enhance\ntwo-photon absorption. Realistic simulations of the REMPD signal are obtained\nusing a four-level model that takes into account saturation effects, ion\ntrajectories, laser frequency noise and redistribution of population by\nblackbody radiation. We show that the use of counterpropagating laser beams\nenables optical excitation in an effective Lamb-Dicke regime. Sub-Doppler lines\nhaving widths in the 100 Hz range can be observed with good signal-to-noise\nratio for an optimal choice of laser detunings. Our results indicate the\nfeasibility of molecular spectroscopy at the $10^{-14}$ accuracy level for\nimproved tests of molecular QED, a new determination of the proton-to-electron\nmass ratio, and studies of the time (in)dependence of the latter.\n", "  We present improved theoretical calculations of transition frequencies for\nthe fundamental transitions $(L\\!=\\!0,v\\!=\\!1)\\to(L'\\!=\\!0,v'\\!=\\!0)$ in the\nhydrogen molecular ions H$_2^+$ and HD$^+$ with a relative uncertainty\n$4\\cdot10^{-11}$ and for the two-photon transitions in the antiprotonic helium\natom with a relative uncertainty $10^{-10}$. To do that, the one-loop\nself-energy correction of order $\\alpha(Z\\alpha)^6$ is derived in the two\nCoulomb center approximation, and numerically evaluated in the case of the\naforementioned transitions. The final results also include a complete set of\nother spin-independent corrections of order $m\\alpha^7$. The leading order\ncorrections of $\\alpha^2\\ln^3(Z\\alpha)^{-2}(Z\\alpha)^6$ are also considered\nthat allows to estimate a magnitude of yet uncalculated contributions.\n", "  Physical chaos is a fascinating prospect for high-speed data security by\nserving as a masking carrier or a key source, but suffers from a colored\nspectrum that divulges system's intrinsic oscillations and degrades randomness.\nHere, we demonstrate that physical chaos with a white spectrum can be achieved\nby the optical heterodyning of two delayed-feedback lasers. A white chaotic\nspectrum with 1-dB fluctuation in a band of 11 GHz is experimentally obtained.\nThe white chaos also has a perfect delta-like autocorrelation function and a\nhigh dimensionality of greater than 10, which makes chaos reconstruction\nextremely difficult and thus improves security.\n", "  We discuss an experimental approach allowing to prepare antihydrogen atoms\nfor the GBAR experiment. We study the feasibility of all necessary experimental\nsteps: The capture of incoming $\\bar{\\rm H}^+$ ions at keV energies in a deep\nlinear RF trap, sympathetic cooling by laser cooled Be$^+$ ions, transfer to a\nminiaturized trap and Raman sideband cooling of an ion pair to the motional\nground state, and further reducing the momentum of the wavepacket by adiabatic\nopening of the trap. For each step, we point out the experimental challenges\nand discuss the efficiency and characteristic times, showing that capture and\ncooling are possible within a few seconds.\n", "  We investigate the leading systematic effects in ro-vibrational spectroscopy\nof the molecular hydrogen ions H2+ and HD+, in order to assess their potential\nfor the realization of optical clocks that would be sensitive to possible\nvariations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Both two-photon (2E1) and\nquadrupole (E2) transitions are considered. In view of the weakness of these\ntransitions, most attention is devoted to the light shift induced by the probe\nlaser, which we express as a function of the transition amplitude, differential\ndynamic polarizability and clock interrogation times. Transition amplitudes and\ndynamic polarizabilites including the effect of hyperfine structure are then\ncalculated in a full three-body approach to get a precise evaluation of the\nlight shift. Together with the quadrupole and Zeeman shifts that are obtained\nfrom previous works, these results provide a realistic estimate of the\nachievable accuracy. We show that the lightshift is the main limiting factor in\nthe case of two-photon transitions, both in H2+ and HD+, leading to expected\naccuracy levels close to 5 10-16 in the best cases. Quadrupole transitions have\neven more promising properties and may allow reaching or going beyond 10-16.\n", "  We present a rigorous and fully consistent $K$-theoretic framework for\nstudying gapped topological phases of free fermions such as topological\ninsulators. It utilises and profits from powerful techniques in operator\n$K$-theory. From the point of view of symmetries, especially those of time\nreversal, charge conjugation, and magnetic translations, operator $K$-theory is\nmore general and natural than the commutative topological theory. Our approach\nis model-independent, and only the symmetry data of the dynamics, which may\ninclude information about disorder, is required. This data is completely\nencoded in a suitable $C^*$-superalgebra. From a representation-theoretic point\nof view, symmetry-compatible gapped phases are classified by the\nsuper-representation group of this symmetry algebra. Contrary to existing\nliterature, we do not use $K$-theory to classify phases in an absolute sense,\nbut only relative to some arbitrary reference. $K$-theory groups are better\nthought of as groups of obstructions between homotopy classes of gapped phases.\nBesides rectifying various inconsistencies in the existing literature on\n$K$-theory classification schemes, our treatment has conceptual simplicity in\nits treatment of all symmetries equally. The Periodic Table of Kitaev is\nexhibited as a special case within our framework, and we prove that the\nphenomena of periodicity and dimension shifts are robust against disorder and\nmagnetic fields.\n", "  We present calculations of the one-loop vacuum polarization contribution\n(Uehling potential) for the two-center problem in the NRQED formalism. The\ncases of hydrogen molecular ions ($Z_1=Z_2=1$) as well as antiprotonic helium\n($Z_1=2$, $Z_2=-1$) are considered. Numerical results of the vacuum\npolarization contribution at $m\\alpha^7$ order for the fundamental transitions\n$(v=0,L=0)\\to(v'=1,L'=0)$ in H$_2^+$ and HD$^+$ are presented.\n", "  Human understanding of randomness and variation is shaped by a number of\ncognitive biases. Here we relate a lesser-known cognitive bias, the \"outcome\norientation\", to medical questions and describe the harm that the outcome\norientation can do to medical research and practice. People who reason\naccording to an outcome orientation interpret probability as a subjective\ndegree of belief that is constrained to consider events one at a time, in a way\nthat is incompatible with Bayesian reasoning. Instead of accepting that\nuncertainty is inevitable, and generalizing from the frequency of similar\nevents, the outcome orientation prefers one-off causal narratives. In medicine,\nthe outcome orientation therefore erodes support for randomized controlled\ntrials in favor of reductionist approaches. The rhetoric of personalized\nmedicine resonates with, and can promote, the outcome orientation, by\nemphasizing how the measurable attributes of individual patients, rather than\nchance or unknowable factors, causally produce each particular patient's\noutcome.\n", "  In this paper we present a Markovian representation approach to constructing\nquantum filters for a class of non-Markovian quantum systems disturbed by\nLorenztian noise. An ancillary system is introduced to convert white noise into\nLorentzian noise which is injected into a principal system via a direct\ninteraction. The resulting dynamics of the principal system are non-Markovian,\nwhich are driven by the Lorentzian noise. By probing the principal system, a\nquantum filter for the augmented system can be derived from standard theory,\nwhere the conditional state of the principal system can be obtained by tracing\nout the ancillary system. An example is provided to illustrate the\nnon-Markovian dynamics of the principal system.\n", "  We introduce a general method of gluing multi-partite states and show that\nentanglement swapping is a special class of a wider range of gluing operations.\nThe gluing operation of two m and n qudit states consists of an entangling\noperation on two given qudits of the the two states followed by operations of\nmeasurements of the two qudits in the computational basis. Depending on how\nmany qudits (two, one or zero) we measure, we have three classes of gluing\noperation, resulting respectively in m+n-2, m+n-1 or m+n qudit states.\nEntanglement swapping belongs to the first class and has been widely studied,\nwhile the other two classes are presented and studied here. In particular we\nstudy how larger GHZ and W states can be constructed when we glue the smaller\nGHZ and W states by the second method. Finally we prove that when we glue two\nstates by the third method, the k-uniformity of the states is preserved. That\nis when a k-uniform state of m qudits is glued to a k'-uniform state of n\nqudits, the resulting state will be a min(k,k')-uniform of m+n qudits.\n", "  In this paper, a quantum filter for estimating the states of a non-Markovian\nqubit system is presented in an augmented Markovian system framework including\nboth the qubit system of interest and multi-ancillary systems for representing\nthe internal modes of the non-Markovian environment. The colored noise\ngenerated by the multi-ancillary systems disturbs the qubit system via a direct\ninteraction. The resulting non-Markovian dynamics of the qubit is determined by\na memory kernel function arising from the dynamics of the ancillary system. In\nprinciple, colored noise with arbitrary power spectrum can be generated by a\ncombination of Lorentzian noises. Hence, the quantum filter can be constructed\nfor the qubit disturbed by arbitrary colored noise and the conditional state of\nthe qubit system can be obtained by tracing out the multi-ancillary systems. An\nillustrative example is given to show the non-Markovian dynamics of the qubit\nsystem with Lorentzian noise.\n", "  The remarkable optoelectronic, and especially photovoltaic performance of\nhybrid-organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) materials drives efforts to connect\nmaterials properties to this performance. From nano-indentation experiments on\nsolution-grown single crystals we obtain elastic modulus and nano-hardness\nvalues of APbX3 (A = Cs, CH3NH3 and X = I, Br). The Youngs moduli are about 14,\n19.5 and 16 GPa, for CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbBr3 and CsPbBr3, respectively, lending\ncredence to theoretically calculated values. We discuss possible relevance of\nour results to suggested self-healing, ion diffusion and ease of manufacturing.\nUsing our results, together with literature data on elastic moduli, we\nclassified HOIPs amongst relevant materials groups, based on their\nelasto-mechanical properties.\n", "  In this paper we present a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) feedback control\nstrategy for a class of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. The feedback\ncontrol law is designed based on the estimated states of a whitening quantum\nfilter for an augmented Markovian model of the non-Markovian open quantum\nsystems. In this augmented Markovian model, an ancillary system plays the role\nof internal modes of the environment converting white noise into Lorentzian\nnoise and a principal system obeys non-Markovian dynamics due to the direct\ninteraction with the ancillary system. The simulation results show the LQG\ncontroller with the whitening filter obtains a better control performance than\nthat with a Markovian filter in the problem of minimizing the photon numbers of\nthe principal system when the ancillary system is disturbed by thermal noise.\n", "  We report measurements of the upper critical field $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ as\nfunctions of temperature $T$, polar angle $\\theta$ (of the field direction with\nrespect to the crystallographic $c$ axis), and azimuthal angle $\\phi$ (of the\nfield direction relative to the $a$ axis within the $ab$ plane) for the\nCr-based superconductor K$_{2}$Cr$_{3}$As$_{3}$ with a quasi-one-dimensional\nand non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. We confirm that the anisotropy in\n$H_{\\mathrm{c2}}(T)$ becomes inverse with decreasing temperature. At low\ntemperatures, $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}(\\theta)$ data are featured by two maxima at\n$\\theta$ = 0 ($\\mathbf{H}\\parallel c$) and $\\pi/2$ ($\\mathbf{H}\\bot c$), which\ncan be quantitatively understood only if uniaxial effective-mass anisotropy and\nabsence of Pauli paramagnetic effect for $\\mathbf{H}\\bot c$ are taken\nsimultaneously into consideration. The in-plane $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}(\\phi)$ profile\nshows a unique threefold modulation especially at low temperatures. Overall,\nthe characteristic of the $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}(\\theta, \\phi, T)$ data mostly\nresemble those of the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt$_3$, and we argue in\nfavor of a dominant spin-triplet superconductivity with odd parity in\nK$_{2}$Cr$_{3}$As$_{3}$.\n", "  A dispersion relation for gravity waves in water covered by disk-like\nimpurities embedded in a viscous matrix is derived. The macroscopic equations\nare obtained by ensemble-averaging the fluid equations at the disk scale in the\nasymptotic limit of long waves and low disk surface fraction. Various regimes\nare identified depending on the disk radii and the thickness and viscosity of\nthe top layer. Semi-quantitative analysis in the close-packing regime suggests\ndramatic modification of the dynamics, with orders of magnitude increase in\nwave damping and wave dispersion. A simplified model working in this regime is\nproposed. Possible applications to wave propagation in ice-covered ocean is\ndiscussed and comparison with field data is provided.\n", "  Boron (B) sheet has been intently studied and various candidates with\nvacancies have been proposed by theoretical investigations, including the\npossible growth on metal surface. However, a recent experiment (Science 350,\n1513, 2015) reported that the sheet formed on the Ag(111) surface was a buckled\ntriangular lattice without vacancy. Our calculations combined with\nHigh-Throughput screening and the first-principles method demonstrate a novel\ngrowth mechanism of boron sheet from clusters, ribbons, to monolayers, where\nthe B-Ag interaction is dominant in the nucleation of boron nanostructures. We\nhave found that the simulated STM image of the sheet with 1/6 vacancies in a\nstripe pattern is in better agreement with the experimental observation, which\nis energetically favored during the nucleation and growth.\n", "  Starting with the generic Ginzburg-Landau expansion from a microscopic\n$N$-band model, we focus on the case of a 3-band model which was suggested to\nbe relevant to describe some iron-based superconductors. This can lead to the\nso-called $s+is$ superconducting state that breaks time-reversal symmetry due\nto the competition between different pairing channels. Of particular interest\nin that context, is the case of an interband dominated pairing with repulsion\nbetween different bands. For that case we consider in detail the relevant\nreduced two-component Ginzburg-Landau theory. We provide detailed analysis of\nthe ground state, length scales and topological properties of that model.\n", "  Based on the second-order quantum interference between frequency entangled\nphotons that are generated by parametric down conversion, a quantum strategic\nalgorithm for synchronizing two spatially separated clocks has been recently\npresented. In the reference frame of a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer,\nphoton correlations are used to define simultaneous events. Once the HOM\ninterferometer is balanced by use of an adjustable optical delay in one arm,\narrival times of simultaneously generated photons are recorded by each clock.\nThe clock offset is determined by correlation measurement of the recorded\narrival times. Utilizing this algorithm, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle\nexperiment for synchronizing two clocks separated by 4km fiber link. A minimum\ntiming stability of 0.4 ps at averaging time of 16000 s is achieved with an\nabsolute time accuracy of 59.4 ps. The timing stability is verified to be\nlimited by the correlation measurement device and ideally can be better than 10\nfs. Such results shine a light to the application of quantum clock\nsynchronization in the real high-accuracy timing system.\n", "  The quantum phase transition between two clean, non interacting topologically\ndistinct gapped states in three dimensions is governed by a massless Dirac\nfermion fixed point, irrespective of the underlying symmetry class, and this\nconstitutes a remarkably simple example of superuniversality. For a\nsufficiently weak disorder strength, we show that the massless Dirac fixed\npoint is at the heart of the robustness of superuniversality. We establish this\nby considering both perturbative and nonperturbative effects of disorder. The\nsuperuniversality breaks down at a critical strength of disorder, beyond which\nthe topologically distinct localized phases become separated by a delocalized\ndiffusive phase. In the global phase diagram, the disorder controlled fixed\npoint where superuniversality is lost, serves as a multicritical point, where\nthe delocalized diffusive and two topologically distinct localized phases meet\nand the nature of the localization-delocalization transition depends on the\nunderlying symmetry class. Based on these features we construct the global\nphase diagrams of noninteracting, dirty topological systems in three\ndimensions. We also establish a similar structure of the phase diagram and the\nsuperuniversality for weak disorder in higher spatial dimensions. By noting\nthat $1/r^2$ power-law correlated disorder acts as a marginal perturbation for\nmassless Dirac fermion in any spatial dimension $d$, we have established a\ngeneral renormalization group framework for addressing disorder driven critical\nphenomena for fixed spatial dimension $d > 2$.\n", "  We analyse properties of contact networks formed in packings of soft\nfrictionless disks near the unjamming transition. We construct polygonal\ntilings and triangulations of the contact network that partitions space into\nconvex regions which are either covered or uncovered. This allows us to\ncharacterize the local spatial structure of the packing near the transition\nusing well-defined geometric objects. We construct bounds on the number of\npolygons and triangulation vectors that appear in such packings. We study these\nnetworks using simulations of bidispersed disks interacting via a one-sided\nlinear spring potential. We find that several underlying geometric\ndistributions are reproducible and display self averaging properties. We find\nthat the total covered area is a reliable real space parameter that can serve\nas a substitute for the packing fraction. We find that the unjamming transition\noccurs at a fraction of covered area $A_G^{*} = 0.446(1)$. We determine scaling\nexponents of the excess covered area as the energy of the system approaches\nzero $E_G \\to 0^+$, and the coordination number $\\langle z_g \\rangle$\napproaches its isostatic value $\\Delta Z = \\langle z_g \\rangle - \\langle z_g\n\\rangle_{\\rm iso} \\to 0^{+}$. We find $\\Delta A_G \\sim \\Delta {E_G}^{0.28(1)}$\nand $\\Delta A_G \\sim \\Delta Z^{1.00(1)}$, representing new structural critical\nexponents. We use the distribution functions of local areas to study the\nunderlying geometric disorder in the packings. We find that a finite fraction\nof order $\\Psi_O^* = 0.369(1)$ persists as the transition is approached.\n", "  We review a variety of theoretical and experimental results concerning\nelectronic band structure of superconducting materials based on FeSe\nmonolayers. Three type of systems are analyzed: intercalated FeSe systems\nA_xFe_2Se_{2-x}S_x and [Li_{1-x}Fe_xOH]FeSe as well as the single FeSe layer\nfilms on SrTiO_3 substrate. We present the results of detailed first principle\nelectronic band structure calculations for these systems together with\ncomparison with some experimental ARPES data. The electronic structure of these\nsystems is rather different from that of typical FeAs superconductors, which is\nquite significant for possible microscopic mechanism of superconductivity. This\nis reflected in the absence of hole pockets of the Fermi surface at\n\\Gamma-point in Brillouin zone, so that there are no \"nesting\" properties of\ndifferent Fermi surface pockets. LDA+DMFT calculations show that correlation\neffects on Fe-3d states in the single FeSe layer are not that strong as in most\nof FeAs systems. As a result, at present there is no theoretical understanding\nof the formation of rather \"shallow\" electronic bands at M points. LDA\ncalculations show that the main difference in electronic structure of FeSe\nmonolayer on SrTiO_3 substrate from isolated FeSe layer is the presence of the\nband of O-2p surface states of TiO_2 layer on the Fermi level together with\nFe-3d states, which may be important for understanding the enhanced T_c values\nin this system. We briefly discuss the implications of our results for\nmicroscopic models of superconductivity.\n", "  The hint for a possible resonance in the diphoton channel with mass of\n750~GeV disappeared in the data presented at ICHEP'16 by ATLAS and CMS.\nHowever, the diphoton final state remains as one of the golden channels for new\nphysics discoveries at the TeV scale in the LHC experiments. This motivates us\nto analyze model-independently the implications of an O(TeV) bump in the\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ final state. By means of forward sum-rules for $\\gamma\\gamma$\nscattering, we show that a spin-0 resonance with mass of the order of the TeV\nand a sizable $\\gamma\\gamma$ partial width -of the order of a few GeV- must be\naccompanied by higher spin resonances with $J_R\\geq 2$ with similar properties,\nas expected in strongly coupled extensions of the Standard Model or,\nalternatively, in higher dimensional deconstructed duals. Furthermore,\nindependently of whether the putative O(TeV) candidate is a scalar or a tensor,\nthe large contribution to the forward sum-rules in the referred scenario\nimplies the presence of states in the spectrum with $J_R\\geq 2$, these high\nspin particles being a manifestation of new extra-dimensions or composite\nstates of a new strong sector.\n", "  The possible use of high-resolution rovibrational spectroscopy of the\nhydrogen molecular ions H + 2 and HD + for an independent determination of\nseveral fundamental constants is analyzed. While these molecules had been\nproposed for metrology of nuclear-to-electron mass ratios, we show that they\nare also sensitive to the radii of the proton and deuteron and to the Rydberg\nconstant at the level of the current discrepancies colloquially known as the\nproton size puzzle. The required level of accuracy, in the 10 --12 range, can\nbe reached both by experiments, using Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy\nschemes, and by theoretical predictions. It is shown how the measurement of\nseveral well-chosen rovibrational transitions may shed new light on the\nproton-radius puzzle, provide an alternative accurate determination of the\nRydberg constant, and yield new values of the proton-to-electron and\ndeuteron-to-proton mass ratios with one order of magnitude higher precision.\n", "  We investigate the gravitational quasi-normal modes (QNMs) for a type of\nregular black hole (BH) known as phantom BH, which is a static self-gravitating\nsolution of a minimally coupled phantom scalar field with a potential. The\nstudies are carried out for three different spacetimes: asymptotically flat, de\nSitter (dS), and anti de Sitter (AdS). In order to consider the standard odd\nparity and even parity of gravitational perturbations, the corresponding master\nequations are derived. The QNMs are discussed by evaluating the temporal\nevolution of the perturbation field which, in turn, provides direct information\non the stability of BH spacetime. It is found that in asymptotically flat, dS\nand AdS spacetimes, the gravitational perturbations have similar\ncharacteristics for both odd and even parities. The decay rate of perturbation\nis strongly dependent on the scale parameter $b$, which measures the coupling\nstrength between phantom scalar field and the gravity. Furthermore, through the\nanalysis of Hawking radiation, it is shown that the thermodynamics of such\nregular phantom BH is also influenced by $b$. The obtained results might shed\nsome light on the quantum interpretation of QNM perturbation.\n", "  We study the possible breakdown of quantum thermalization in a model of\nitinerant electrons on a one-dimensional chain without disorder, with both spin\nand charge degrees of freedom. The eigenstates of this model exhibit peculiar\nproperties in the entanglement entropy, the apparent scaling of which is\nmodified from a \"volume law\" to an \"area law\" after performing a partial,\nsite-wise measurement on the system. These properties and others suggest that\nthis model realizes a new, non-thermal phase of matter, known as a quantum\ndisentangled liquid (QDL). The putative existence of this phase has striking\nimplications for the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics.\n", "  We revisit the Coulomb blockade of the tunnel junction with conductance much\nsmaller than $e^2/\\hbar$. We study the junction with capacitance $C$, embedded\nin an Ohmic electromagnetic environment modelled by a series resistance $R$\nwhich produces the Nyquist noise. In the semiclassical limit the Nyquist noise\ncharges the junction by a random charge with a Gaussian distribution. Assuming\nthe Gaussian distribution, we derive analytically the temperature-dependent\njunction conductance $G(T)$ valid for temperatures $k_BT \\gtrsim (R_K/2\\pi\nR)E_c$ and resistances $R \\gtrsim R_K$, where $R_K = h/e^2$ and $E_c=e^2/2C \\\n\\text{is}$ the single-electron charging energy. Our analytical result shows the\nleading dependence $G(T) \\propto e^{-E_c/4k_BT}$, so far believed to exist only\nif $(R_K/\\pi R)E_c \\ll k_BT \\ll E_c$ and $R \\gg R_K$. The validity of our\nresult for $k_BT \\gtrsim (R_K/2\\pi R)E_c$ and $R \\gtrsim R_K$ is confirmed by a\ngood agreement with the numerical studies which do not assume the semiclassical\nlimit, and by a reasonable agreement with experimental data for $R$ as low as\n$R_K$. Our result also reproduces various asymptotic formulae derived in the\npast. The factor of $1/4$ in the activation energy $E_c/4$ is due to the\nsemiclassical Nyquist noise.\n", "  The natural periodic stacking of symmetry-inequivalent planes in layered\ncompounds can lead to the formation of natural superlattices; albeit close in\ntotal energy, (thus in their thermodynamic stability), such polytype\nsuperlattices can exhibit different structural symmetries, thus have markedly\ndifferent electronic properties which can in turn be used as \"structural\nmarkers\". We illustrate this general principle on the layered LaOBiS2 compound\nwhere density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on the (BiS2)/(LaO)/(BiS2)\npolytype superlattices reveal both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct\nelectronic structure markers associated with the Rashba physics, yet the total\nenergies are only ~ 0.1 meV apart. This opens the exciting possibility of\nidentifying subtle structural features via electronic markers. We show that the\npattern of removal of band degeneracies in different polytypes by the different\nforms of symmetry breaking leads to new Rashba \"mini gaps\" with characteristic\nRashba parameters that can be determined from spectroscopy, thereby narrowing\ndown the physically possible polytypes. By identifying these distinct\nDFT-predicted fingerprints via ARPES measurements on LaBiOS2 we found the\ndominant polytype with small amounts of mixtures of other polytypes. This\nconclusion, consistent with neutron scattering results, establishes ARPES\ndetection of theoretically established electronic markers as a powerful tool to\ndelineate energetically quasidegenerate polytypes.\n", "  At high energies, the cross section of a hard exclusive process at finite\nscattering angle falls off as a negative power of the center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s}$. If all involved quark-gluon compositions undergo hard momentum\ntransfers, the scaling of the fall-off is determined by the underlying valence\nstructures of the initial and final states, known as the constituent counting\nrules. It was argued in the literature that the counting rules are a powerful\ntool to determine the valence degrees of freedom inside multiquark states when\napplied to exclusive production processes. However, we demonstrate that for\nhadrons with hidden flavors the naive application of the constituent counting\nrules is problematic, since it is not mandatory for all components to\nparticipate the hard scattering at the scale $\\sqrt{s}$. The correct scaling\nrules can be obtained easily by using effective field theory. A few examples\ninvolving the $Z_c(3900)^\\pm$ and $X(3872)$ are discussed.\n", "  Entanglement of light and matter is an essential resource for effective\nquantum engineering. In particular, collective states of atomic ensembles are\nrobust against decoherence while preserving the possibility of strong\ninteraction with quantum states of light. While previous approaches to\ncontinous-variable quantum interfaces relied on quadratures of light, here we\npresent an approach based on spatial structure of light-atom entanglement. We\ncreate and characterize a 12-dimensional entangled state exhibiting quantum\ncorrelations between a photon and an atomic ensemble in position and momentum\nbases. This state allows us to demonstrate the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\n(EPR) paradox with two different entities, with an unprecedented delay time of\n6 $\\mu$s between generation of entanglement and detection of the atomic state.\n", "  This short note is devoted to deriving scaling but hyperscaling violating\nsolutions in a generalised Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory with an arbitrary\nnumber of scalars and vectors. We obtain analytic solutions in some special\ncase and discuss the physical constraints on the allowed parameter range in\norder to have a well-defined holographic ground-state solution.\n", "  We introduce an abstract machine architecture for classical/quantum\ncomputations---including compilation---along with a quantum instruction\nlanguage called Quil for explicitly writing these computations. With this\nformalism, we discuss concrete implementations of the machine and non-trivial\nalgorithms targeting them. The introduction of this machine dovetails with\nongoing development of quantum computing technology, and makes possible\nportable descriptions of recent classical/quantum algorithms.\n", "  We report on Raman sideband cooling of ${^{25}\\text{Mg}^+}$ to\nsympathetically cool the secular modes of motion in a\n$^{25}\\text{Mg}^+$-$^{27}\\!\\text{Al}^+$ two-ion pair to near the\nthree-dimensional (3D) ground state. The evolution of the Fock-state\ndistribution during the cooling process is studied using a rate-equation\nsimulation, and various heating sources that limit the efficiency of 3D\nsideband cooling in our system are discussed. We characterize the residual\nenergy and heating rates of all of the secular modes of motion and estimate a\nsecular motion time-dilation shift of ${-(1.9 \\pm 0.1)\\times 10^{-18}}$ for an\n${^{27}\\text{Al}^+}$ clock at a typical clock probe duration of $150$ ms. This\nis a 50-fold reduction in the secular motion time-dilation shift uncertainty in\ncomparison with previous ${^{27}\\text{Al}^+}$ clocks.\n", "  Recently we reported a high precision optical frequency measurement of the\n(v,L):(0,2)->(8,3) vibrational overtone transition in trapped deuterated\nmolecular hydrogen (HD+) ions at 10 mK temperature. Achieving a resolution of\n0.85 parts-per-billion (p.p.b.) we found the experimental value ($\\nu_0=\n383,407,177.38(41)$ MHz) to be in agreement with the value from molecular\ntheory ($\\nu_\\text{th}=383,407,177.150(15)$ MHz) within 0.6(1.1) p.p.b.\n[Biesheuvel et al., Nat.

This enabled an improved\ntest of molecular theory (including QED), new constraints on the size of\npossible effects due to 'new physics', and the first determination of the\nproton-electron mass ratio from a molecule. Here, we provide the details of the\nexperimental procedure, spectral analysis, and the assessment of systematic\nfrequency shifts. Our analysis focuses in particular on deviations of the HD+\nvelocity distribution from thermal (Gaussian) distributions under the influence\nof collisions with fast ions produced during (laser-induced) chemical\nreactions, as such deviations turn out to significantly shift the\nhyperfine-less vibrational frequency as inferred from the saturated and\nDoppler-broadened spectrum, which contains partly unresolved hyperfine\nstructure.\n", "  The silicon-strip tracker of the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite\n(CSES) consists of two double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSDs) which\nprovide incident particle tracking information. The low-noise analog ASIC VA140\nwas used in this study for DSSD signal readout. A beam test on the DSSD module\nwas performed at the Beijing Test Beam Facility of the Beijing Electron\nPositron Collider (BEPC) using a 400~800 MeV/c proton beam. The pedestal\nanalysis results, RMSE noise, gain correction, and particle incident position\nreconstruction of the DSSD module are presented.\n", "  We investigate the wave propagation on a compact 3-manifold of constant\npositive curvature with a non trivial topology, the Poincar\\'e dodecahedral\nspace, when the scale factor is exponentially increasing. We prove the\nexistence of a limit state as t tends to infinity and we get its analytic\nexpression. The deep sky is described by this asymptotic profile thanks to the\nSachs-Wolfe formula. We transform the Cauchy problem into a mixed problem posed\non a fundamental domain determined by the quaternionic calculus. We perform an\naccurate scheme of computation: we employ a variational method using a space of\nsecond order finite elements that is invariant under the action of the binary\nicosahedral group.\n", "  We construct models of exactly solvable two-particle quantum graphs with\ncertain non-local two-particle interactions, establishing appropriate boundary\nconditions via suitable self-adjoint realisations of the two-particle\nLaplacian. Showing compatibility with the Bethe ansatz method, we calculate\nquantisation conditions in the form of secular equations from which the spectra\ncan be deduced. We compare spectral statistics of some examples to well known\nresults in random matrix theory, analysing the chaotic properties of their\nclassical counterparts.\n", "  As discovered by P. W. Anderson, excitations do not propagate freely in a\ndisordered lattice, but, due to destructive interference, they localise. As a\nconsequence when an atom interacts with a disordered lattice one indeed\nobserves, a non-trivial excitation exchange between atom and lattice. Such\nnon-trivial atomic dynamics will in general be characterised also by a\nnon-trivial quantum information backflow, a clear signature of non-Markovian\ndynamics. To investigate the above scenario we consider a quantum emitter, or\natom, weakly coupled to a uniform coupled-cavity array (CCA). If initially\nexcited, in the absence of disorder, the emitter undergoes a Markovian\nspontaneous emission by releasing all its excitation into the CCA (initially in\nits vacuum state). By introducing static disorder in the CCA the field normal\nmodes become Anderson-localized, giving rise to a non-Markovian atomic\ndynamics. We show the existence of a functional relationship between a rigorous\nmeasure of quantum non-Markovianity and the CCA localization. We furthermore\nshow that the average non-Markovianity of the atomic dynamics is well-described\nby a phenomenological model in which the atom is coupled, at the same time, to\na single mode and to a standard - Markovian - dissipative bath.\n", "  Plasma waves with frequencies close to the particular gyrofrequencies of the\ncharged particles in the plasma lose energy due to cyclotron damping. We\nbriefly discuss the gyro-resonance of low frequency plasma waves and ions\nparticularly with regard to particle-in-cell (PiC) simulations. A setup is\noutlined which uses artificially excited waves in the damped regime of the wave\nmode's dispersion relation to track the damping of the wave's electromagnetic\nfields. Extracting the damping rate directly from the field data in real or\nFourier space is an intricate and non-trivial task. We therefore present a\nsimple method of obtaining the damping rate {\\Gamma} from the simulation data.\nThis method is described in detail, focusing on a step-by-step explanation of\nthe course of actions. In a first application to a test simulation we find that\nthe damping rates obtained from this simulation generally are in good agreement\nwith theoretical predictions. We then compare the results of one-, two- and\nthree-dimensional simulation setups and simulations with different physical\nparameter sets.\n", "  It is demonstrated that the reason of SERS on dielectric and semiconductor\nsubstrates is the enhancement of the electric field in the regions of the tops\nof the surface roughness with very small radius, or a very large curvature. The\nenhancement depends on the dielectric constant of the substrate and is stronger\nfor a larger dielectric constant. It is indicated that the enhancement on\ndielectrics and semiconductors is weaker than on metals with the same modulus\nof the dielectric constant. The result obtained is confirmed by experimental\ndata on the enhancement coefficients obtained for various semiconductor and\ndielectric substrates.\n", "  There are well-observed differences between cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core\n(NCC) clusters, but the origin of this distinction is still largely unknown.\nCompeting theories can be divided into internal (inside-out), in which internal\nphysical processes transform or maintain the NCC phase, and external\n(outside-in), in which the cluster type is determined by its initial\nconditions, which in turn lead to different formation histories (i.e., assembly\nbias). We propose a new method that uses the relative assembly bias of CC to\nNCC clusters, as determined via the two-point cluster-galaxy cross-correlation\nfunction (CCF), to test whether formation history plays a role in determining\ntheir nature. We apply our method to 48 ACCEPT clusters, which have well\nresolved central entropies, and cross-correlate with the SDSS-III/BOSS LOWZ\ngalaxy catalog. We find that the relative bias of NCC over CC clusters is $b =\n1.42 \\pm 0.35$ ($1.6\\sigma$ different from unity). Our measurement is limited\nby the small number of clusters with core entropy information within the BOSS\nfootprint, 14 CC and 34 NCC. Future compilations of X-ray cluster samples,\ncombined with deep all-sky redshift surveys, will be able to better constrain\nthe relative assembly bias of CC and NCC clusters and determine the origin of\nthe bimodality.\n", "  Astrophysical searches for gamma rays are one of the main strategies to probe\nthe annihilation or decay of dark matter particles. We present a new class of\ndistinct sub-GeV spectral features that generically appear in kinematical\nsituations where the available center-of-mass energy in such processes is just\nabove threshold to produce excited meson states. Using a Fisher forecast with\nrealistic astrophysical backgrounds, we demonstrate that for upcoming\nexperiments like e-ASTROGAM and ComPair these signals can turn out to be the\nsmoking gun in the search for particle dark matter.\n", "  Deformation heterogeneities within microstructures of polycrystalline shape\nmemory alloys (SMAs) during superelastic stressing are studied using both\nexperiments and simulations. In situ X-ray diffraction, specifically the\nfar-field high energy diffraction microscopy (ff-HEDM) technique was used to\nnon-destructively measure the grain-averaged statistics of position, crystal\norientation, elastic strain tensor and volume for hundreds of austenite grains\nin a superelastically loaded nickel-titanium (NiTi) SMA. This experimental data\nwere also used to create a synthetic microstructure within a finite element\nmodel. The development of intragranular stresses were then simulated during\ntensile loading of the model using anisotropic elasticity. Driving forces for\nphase transformation and slip were calculated from these stresses. The\ngrain-average responses of individual austenite crystals examined before and\nafter multiple stress-induced transformation events showed that grains at the\nspecimen interior carry more stress and plastically deform less than the\nsurface grains as the superelastic response shakes down. Examination of the\nheterogeneity within individual grains showed that regions near grain\nboundaries exhibit larger stress variation compared to the grain interiors.\nThis intragranular heterogeneity is more strongly driven by the constraints of\nneighboring grains than the initial stress state and orientation of the\nindividual grains.\n", "  A sufficiently strong long-range Coulomb interaction can induce excitonic\npairing in gapless Dirac semimetals, which generates a finite gap and drives\nsemimetal-insulator quantum phase transition. This phenomenon is in close\nanalogy to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in high energy physics. In most\nrealistic Dirac semimetals, including suspended graphene, Coulomb interaction\nis too weak to open an excitonic gap. The Coulomb interaction plays a more\nimportant role at low energies in a two-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal, in\nwhich the fermion spectrum is linear in one component of momenta and quadratic\nin the other, than a Dirac semimetal, and indeed leads to breakdown of Fermi\nliquid theory. We study dynamical excitonic gap generation in a two-dimensional\nsemi-Dirac semimetal by solving the Dyson-Schwinger equation, and show that a\nmoderately strong Coulomb interaction suffices to induce excitonic pairing.\nAdditional short-range four-fermion coupling tends to promote excitonic\npairing. Among the available semi-Dirac semimetals, we find that\nTiO$_{2}$/VO$_{2}$ nanostructure provides a promising candidate for the\nrealization of excitonic insulator. We also apply the renormalziation group\nmethod to analyze the strong coupling between the massless semi-Dirac fermions\nand the quantum critical fluctuation of excitonic order parameter at the\nsemimetal-insulator quantum critical point, and reveal non-Fermi liquid\nbehaviors of semi-Dirac fermions.\n", "  Resonant scattering of fast particles off low frequency plasma waves is a\nmajor process determining transport characteristics of energetic particles in\nthe heliosphere and contributing to their acceleration. Usually, only Alfv\\'en\nwaves are considered for this process, although dispersive waves are also\npresent throughout the heliosphere. We investigate resonant interaction of\nenergetic electrons with dispersive, right-handed waves. For the interaction of\nparticles and a single wave a variable transformation into the rest frame of\nthe wave can be performed. Here, wellestablished analytic models derived in the\nframework of magnetostatic quasi-linear theory (QLT) can be used as a reference\nto validate simulation results. However, this approach fails as soon as several\ndispersive waves are involved. Based on analytic solutions modeling the\nscattering amplitude in the magnetostatic limit, we present an approach to\nmodify these equations for the use in the plasma frame. Thereby we aim at a\ndescription of particle scattering in the presence of several waves. A\nParticle-in-Cell (PiC) code is employed to study wave-particle scattering on a\nmicro-physically correct level and to test the modified model equations. We\ninvestigate the interactions of electrons at different energies (from 1 keV to\n1 MeV) and right-handed waves with various amplitudes. Differences between\nmodel and simulation arise in the case of high amplitudes or several waves.\nAnalyzing the trajectories of single particles we find no microscopic diffusion\nin the case of a single plasma wave, although a broadening of the particle\ndistribution can be observed.\n", "  Precision measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs resonance recently discovered at\nthe LHC have determined that its properties are similar to the ones of the\nStandard Model (SM) Higgs boson. However, the current uncertainties in the\ndetermination of the Higgs boson couplings leave room for significant\ndeviations from the SM expectations. In fact, if one assumes no correlation\nbetween the top-quark and gluon couplings to the Higgs, the current global fit\nto the Higgs data lead to central values of the Higgs couplings to the\nbottom-quark and the top-quark that are about 2 $\\sigma$ away from the SM\npredictions. In a previous work, we showed that such a scenario could be\nrealized in the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (NMSSM), for\nheavy singlets and light MSSM-like Higgs bosons and scalar top quarks, but for\ncouplings that ruined the perturbative consistency of the theory up to the GUT\nscale. In this work we show that a perturbative consistent scenario, for\nsomewhat heavier stops, may be obtained in the presence of light singlets. An\ninteresting bonus of this scenario is the possibility of explaining an excess\nof events observed in CP-even Higgs searches at LEP2.\n", "  Using Wannier functions to represent the density functional results we\ncalculate the hybridization corrections to the orbital momentum operator in the\nOs 5d shell of Mott insulators Ba2NaOsO6 and Ba2YOsO6. The g-factors are\nobtained by evaluating the spin and orbital momentum operators in the atomic\nground states of the Os ion. While the hybridization corrections play minor\nrole in d3 ion of Ba2YOsO6 with dominant spin moment, they are instrumental for\nobservation of non- zero g-factor of the d1 ions of Ba2NaOsO6. In addition we\nanalyze the exchange interactions in Ba2YOsO6 and find them consistent with the\nreported magnetic structure.\n", "  To illustrate a simple mean-field-like approach for examining quantum phase\ntransitions we consider the $J-J^\\prime$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet on\na square lattice. The exchange couplings $J$ and $J^\\prime$ are competing with\neach other. The ratio $J^\\prime/J$ is the control parameter and its change\ndrives the transition. We adopt a variational ansatz, calculate the\nground-state energy as well as the order parameter and describe the quantum\nphase transition inherent in the model. This description corresponds completely\nto the standard Landau theory of phase transitions. We also discuss how to\ngeneralize such an approach for more complicated quantum spin models.\n", "  We study the magnetic and lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity\nof electrically insulating strongly spin-orbit coupled magnetically ordered\nphases on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice using the Kitaev-Heisenberg\nmodel. Depending on model parameters, such as the relative strength of the\nspin-orbit induced anisotropic coupling, a number of magnetically ordered\nphases are possible. In this work, we study two distinct regimes of thermal\ntransport depending on whether the characteristic energy of the phonons or the\nmagnons dominates, and focus on two different relaxation mechanisms, boundary\nscattering and magnon-phonon scattering. For spatially anisotropic magnetic\nphases, the thermal conductivity tensor can be highly anisotropic when the\nmagnetic energy scale dominates, since the magnetic degrees of freedom dominate\nthe thermal transport for temperatures well below the magnetic transition\ntemperature. In the opposite limit in which the phonon energy scale dominates,\nthe thermal conductivity will be nearly isotropic, reflecting the isotropic (at\nlow temperatures) phonon dispersion assumed for the honeycomb lattice. We\nfurther discuss the extent to which thermal transport properties are influenced\nby strong spin-orbit induced anisotropic coupling in the local moment regime of\ninsulating magnetic phases. The developed methodology can be applied to any 2D\nmagnon-phonon system, and more importantly to systems where an analytical\nBogoliubov transformation cannot be found and magnon bands are not necessarily\nisotropic.\n", "  We give an elementary proof that Abelian Chern-Simons theory, described as a\nfunctor from oriented surfaces to C*-algebras, does not admit a natural state.\nNon-existence of natural states is thus not only a phenomenon of quantum field\ntheories on Lorentzian manifolds, but also of topological quantum field\ntheories formulated in the algebraic approach.\n", "  Linear polarization have been observed in both the prompt phase and afterglow\nof some bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Polarization in the prompt phase spans\na wide range, and may be as high as $\\gtrsim 50\\%$. In the afterglow phase,\nhowever, it is usually below $10\\%$. According to the standard fireball model,\nGRBs are produced by synchrotron radiation and Compton scattering process in a\nhighly relativistic jet ejected from the central engine. It is widely accepted\nthat prompt emissions occur in the internal shock when shells with different\nvelocities collide with each other, and the magnetic field advected by the jet\nfrom the central engine can be ordered in large scale. On the other hand,\nafterglows are often assumed to occur in the external shock when the jet\ncollides with interstellar medium, and the magnetic field produced by the shock\nthrough, e.g. Weibel instability, is possibly random. In this paper, we\ncalculate the polarization properties of the synchrotron self-Compton process\nfrom a highly relativistic jet, in which the magnetic field is randomly\ndistributed in the shock plane. We also consider the generalized situation\nwhere a uniform magnetic component perpendicular to the shock plane is\nsuperposed on the random magnetic component. We show that, the polarization is\nhardly to be larger than $10\\%$ if the seed electrons are isotropic in the jet\nframe. This may account for the observed upper limit of polarization in the\nafterglow phase of GRBs. In addition, if the random and uniform magnetic\ncomponents decay with time in different speeds, then the polarization angle may\nchange $90^{\\circ}$ duration the temporal evolution.\n", "  Primordial black hole (PBH) mergers have been proposed as an explanation for\nthe gravitational wave events detected by the LIGO collaboration. Such PBHs may\nbe formed in the early Universe as a result of the collapse of extremely rare\nhigh-sigma peaks of primordial fluctuations on small scales, as long as the\namplitude of primordial perturbations on small scales is enhanced significantly\nrelative to the amplitude of perturbations observed on large scales. One\nconsequence of these small-scale perturbations is generation of stochastic\ngravitational waves that arise at second order in scalar perturbations, mostly\nbefore the formation of the PBHs. These induced gravitational waves have been\nshown, assuming gaussian initial conditions, to be comparable to the current\nlimits from the European Pulsar Timing Array, severely restricting this\nscenario. We show, however, that models with enhanced fluctuation amplitudes\ntypically involve non-gaussian initial conditions. With such initial\nconditions, the current limits from pulsar timing can be evaded. The amplitude\nof the induced gravitational-wave background can be larger or smaller than the\nstochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binaries.\n", "  The second law of thermodynamics states that for a thermally isolated system\nentropy never decreases. Most physical processes we observe in nature involve\nvariations of macroscopic quantities over spatial and temporal scales much\nlarger than microscopic molecular collision scales and thus can be considered\nas in local equilibrium. For a many-body system in local equilibrium a stronger\nversion of the second law applies which says that the entropy production at\neach spacetime point should be non-negative. In this paper we provide a proof\nof the second law for such systems and a first derivation of the local second\nlaw. For this purpose we develop a general non-equilibrium effective field\ntheory of slow degrees of freedom from integrating out fast degrees of freedom\nin a quantum many-body system and consider its classical limit. The key\nelements of the proof are the presence of a $Z_2$ symmetry, which can be\nconsidered as a proxy for local equilibrium and micro-time-reversibility, and a\nclassical remnant of quantum unitarity. The $Z_2$ symmetry leads to a local\ncurrent from a procedure analogous to that used in the Noether theorem.\nUnitarity leads to a definite sign of the divergence of the current. We also\ndiscuss the origin of an arrow of time, as well as the coincidence of causal\nand thermodynamical arrows of time. Applied to hydrodynamics, the proof gives a\nfirst-principle derivation of the phenomenological entropy current condition\nand provides a constructive procedure for obtaining the entropy current.\n", "  Bulk rutile RuO$_2$ has long been considered a Pauli paramagnet. Here we\nreport that RuO$_2$ exhibits a hitherto undetected lattice distortion below\napproximately 900 K. The distortion is accompanied by antiferromagnetic order\nup to at least 300 K with a small room temperature magnetic moment of\napproximately 0.05 $\\mu_B$ as evidenced by polarized neutron diffraction.\nDensity functional theory plus $U$ (DFT+$U$) calculations indicate that\nantiferromagnetism is favored even for small values of the Hubbard $U$ of the\norder of 1 eV. The antiferromagnetism may be traced to a Fermi surface\ninstability, lifting the band degeneracy imposed by the rutile crystal field.\nThe combination of high N\\'eel temperature and small itinerant moments make\nRuO$_2$ unique among ruthenate compounds and among oxide materials in general.\n", "  We propose the idea that not all energy is a source of gravity. We discuss\nthe role of energy in the theory of gravitation and provide a formulation of\ngravity which takes into account the quantum nature of the source. We show that\ngravity depends dramatically on the entanglement present between the\nconstituents of the Universe. Applications of the theory and open questions are\nalso discussed.\n", "  We employ Random Matrix Theory in order to investigate coherent perfect\nabsorption (CPA) in lossy systems with complex internal dynamics. The loss\nstrength $\\gamma_{\\rm CPA}$ and energy $E_{\\rm CPA}$, for which a CPA occurs\nare expressed in terms of the eigenmodes of the isolated cavity -- thus\ncarrying over the information about the chaotic nature of the target -- and\ntheir coupling to a finite number of scattering channels. Our results are\ntested against numerical calculations using complex networks of resonators and\nchaotic graphs as CPA cavities.\n", "  In this work, we study the effects of torsion due to a uniform distribution\nof topological defects (screw dislocations) on free spin/carrier dynamics in\nelastic solids. When a particle moves in such a medium, the effect of the\ntorsion associated to the defect distribution is analogous to that of an\napplied magnetic field but with subtle differences. Analogue Landau levels are\npresent in this system but they cannot be confined to two dimensions. In the\ncase of spinless carriers, zero modes, which do not appear in the magnetic\nLandau levels, show up for quantized values of the linear momentum projected on\nthe defects axis. Particles with spin are subjected to a Zeeman-like coupling\nbetween spin and torsion, which is insensitive to charge. This suggests the\npossibility of spin resonance experiments without a magnetic field for charged\ncarriers or quasiparticles without electrical charge, like triplet excitons,\nfor instance.\n", "  Electronic and topological properties of MoS2 monolayers endowed with 3d\ntransition metal (TM) adatoms (V-Fe) are explored by using ab initio methods\nand k.p models. Without the consideration of the Hubbard U interaction, the V,\nCr, and Fe adatoms tend to locate on the top of the Mo atoms, while the most\nstable site for the Mn atom is at the hollow position of the Mo-S hexagon.\nAfter the Hubbard U is applied, the most stable sites of all the systems become\nthe top of the Mo atoms. Chern insulators without band inversion are achieved\nin these systems. The V and Fe adsorption systems are the best candidates to\nproduce the topological states. The k.p model calculations indicate that these\ntopological states are determined by the TM magnetism, the C3v crystal field\nfrom the MoS2 substrate, and the TM atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The\nspecial two-meron pseudospin texture is found to contribute to the topology.\nThe apparent difference between the Berry curvatures for the V and Fe\nadsorption systems are also explored. Our results widen the understanding to\nthe Chern insulators and are helpful for the applications of the MoS2\nmonolayers in the future electronics and spintronics.\n", "  Doubly-heavy baryons, with two heavy and one light quarks, are expected to\nexist in QCD and their masses have been predicted in the quark model. However\ntheir existence is not well established so far in experiment. In this work, we\nexplore the possibility of searching for $\\Xi_{bc}$ and $\\Xi_{cc}^{+}$ in the\n$W$-exchange processes, $\\Xi_{bc}^{0}\\to pK^{-}$ and $\\Xi_{cc}^{+}\\to\n\\Sigma_{c}^{++}(2520)K^{-}$. On the basis of perturbative calculations, we\nestimate the branching ratio of the first decay as ${\\cal BR}(\\Xi_{bc}^0\\to p^+\nK^-)\\approx3.21\\times {\\cal R}^2_f \\times {\\cal R}_{\\tau}\\times 10^{-7}$, where\n${\\cal R}_f$ (${\\cal R}_{\\tau}$) are the ratios of the decay constants\n(lifetimes) of $\\Xi_{bc}^{0}$ and $\\Lambda_b^{0}$. The branching ratio of\n$\\Xi_{cc}^{+}\\to \\Sigma_{c}^{++}(2520)K^{-}$ is related to that of\n$\\Lambda_c^+\\to \\Delta^{++} K^-$, and thereby a conjectured topology analysis\nleads to the range for the branching ratio as: ${\\cal BR}(\\Xi_{cc}^+\\to\n\\Sigma_{c}^{++}(2520) K^-)\\in \\left[0.36\\%,1.80\\%\\right]$. The decay\n$\\Xi_{cc}^+\\to \\Sigma_{c}^{++}(2520) K^-$ would be reconstructed in the $\n\\Lambda_{c}^{+}K^{-}\\pi^{+}$ final state which is easy to access even at a\nhadron collider. Based on the two facts that abundant heavy quarks can be\nproduced at a hadron collider like LHC, and the branching ratios of\n$\\Xi_{bc}^{0}\\to pK^{-}$ and $\\Xi_{cc}^{+}\\to \\Sigma_{c}^{++}(2520)K^{-}$ are\nsizable, we urge our experimental colleagues to perform a search at LHCb. This\nwill presumably lead to the discovery of the $\\Xi_{bc}$ and $\\Xi_{cc}^{+}$ ,\nand precision measurements of the branching ratios in the future are helpful to\ninvestigate their decay mechanism.\n", "  We report on a temporal evolution of photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of\nCuInS$_{2}$/ZnS colloidal quantum dots (QDs) by drop-casting on SiO$_{2}$/Si\nsubstrates and high quality factor microdisks (MDs) under different atmospheric\nconditions. Fast PL decay, peak blueshift and linewidth broadening due to\nphotooxidation have been observed at low excitation power. With further\nincreasing of the excitation power, the PL peak position shows a redshift and\nlinewidth becomes narrow, which is ascribed to the enhanced F$\\ddot{o}$rster\nresonant energy transfer between different QDs by photoinduced agglomeration.\nThe oxygen plays an important role in optically induced PL decay which is\nverified by reduced photobleaching effect in vacuum. When the QDs drop-casted\non MDs, photooxidation and photobleaching are accelerated because the\nexcitation efficiency is greatly enhanced with coupling the pumping laser with\nthe cavity modes. However, when the emitted photons couple with cavity modes, a\nPL enhancement by more than 20 times is achieved because of the increased\nextraction efficiency and Purcell effects of MDs at room temperature (RT), and\n35 times at 20 K. The photobleaching can be avoided with a small excitation\npower but with a strong PL intensity by taking advantages of high quality\nfactor cavities. The high efficient PL emission without photodegradation is\nvery promising for using CuInS$_{2}$ QDs as high efficient photon emitters at\nRT, where the photodegradation has always been limiting the practical\napplications of colloidal quantum dots.\n", "  Here we present exact, stationary, parametric solutions to the\nSchr\\\"odinger--Poisson system. We confront two images: on one hand, we draw on\nthe homotopy analysis method which leads us to a nonlinear integral scheme.\nIndeed, this approach might be simplified by looking for sufficiently smooth\nsolutions vanishing asymptotically. However, since our system possesses\nstiffness an additional analysis has to be considered. On the other hand, we\nseek for exact solutions over the inverse scattering method by introducing a\npseudo spectral transform. In fact, this pseudo spectral method generalises\nKorteweg--de Vries family's kernel and let us to circumvent some technical\ndifficulties originally arisen in our first approach although, again, we come\nto an integral representation, which we test for convergence.\n", "  For convex optimization problems Bregman divergences appear as regret\nfunctions. Such regret functions can be defined on any convex set but if a\nsufficiency condition is added the regret function must be proportional to\ninformation divergence and the convex set must be spectral. Spectral set are\nsets where different orthogonal decompositions of a state into pure states have\nunique mixing coefficients. Only on such spectral sets it is possible to define\nwell behaved information theoretic quantities like entropy and divergence. It\nis only possible to perform measurements in a reversible way if the state space\nis spectral. The most important spectral sets can be represented as positive\nelements of Jordan algebras with trace 1. This means that Jordan algebras\nprovide a natural framework for studying quantum information. We compare\ninformation theory on Hilbert spaces with information theory in more general\nJordan algebras, and conclude that much of the formalism is unchanged but also\nidentify some important differences.\n", "  We discuss the effect of an external electric field on the wetting of a solid\nsurface by liquid. To this end, we use a model of the two-level-atom fluid for\nwhich the changes in interatomic interactions due to the presence of the field\ncan be found using quantum-mechanical perturbation theory. Constructing the\ngrand potential functional, we perform the standard calculations of Young's\nequilibrium contact angle. The switching on of the electric field $|{\\bf {E}}|\n> 0$ may increase noticeably the contact angle $\\theta$.\n", "  We study the role of environment in the evolution of central and satellite\ngalaxies with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We begin by studying the size-mass\nrelation, replicating previous studies, which showed no difference between the\nsizes of centrals and satellites at fixed stellar mass, before turning our\nattention to the size-core velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_0$) and mass-$\\sigma_0$\nrelations. By comparing the median size and mass of the galaxies at fixed\nvelocity dispersion we find that the central galaxies are consistently larger\nand more massive than their satellite counterparts in the quiescent population.\nIn the star forming population we find there is no difference in size and only\na small difference in mass. To analyse why these difference may be present we\ninvestigate the radial mass profiles and stellar metallicity of the galaxies.\nWe find that in the cores of the galaxies there is no difference in mass\nsurface density between centrals and satellites, but there is a large\ndifference at larger radii. We also find almost no difference between the\nstellar metallicity of centrals and satellites when they are separated into\nstar forming and quiescent groups. Under the assumption that $\\sigma_0$ is\ninvariant to environmental processes, our results imply that central galaxies\nare likely being increased in mass and size by processes such as minor mergers,\nparticularly at high $\\sigma_0$, while satellites are being slightly reduced in\nmass and size by tidal stripping and harassment, particularly at low\n$\\sigma_0$, all of which predominantly affect the outer regions of the\ngalaxies.\n", "  We report observations of CO(J=2-1) and CO(J=3-2) line emission towards the\nquadruply-lensed quasar RXS J1131-1231 at z = 0.654 obtained using the Plateau\nde Bure Interferometer (PdBI) and the Combined Array for Research in\nMillimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). Our lens modeling shows that the asymmetry\nin the double-horned CO(J = 2-1) line profile is mainly a result of\ndifferential lensing, where the magnification factor varies from ~3 to ~9\nacross different kinematic components. The intrinsically symmetric line profile\nand a smooth source-plane velocity gradient suggest that the host galaxy is an\nextended rotating disk, with a CO size of R_CO~6 kpc and a dynamical mass of\nM_dyn~8x10^10 Msun. We also find a secondary CO-emitting source near RXS\nJ1131-1231 whose location is consistent with the optically-faint companion\nreported in previous studies. The lensing-corrected molecular gas masses are\nM_gas = (1.4+/-0.3)x10^10 Msun and (2.0+/-0.1)x10^9 Msun for RXS J1131-1231 and\nthe companion, respectively. We find a lensing-corrected stellar mass of M_* =\n(3+/-1)x10^10 Msun and a star formation rate of SFR_FIR = (120+/-63) Msun yr^-1\n, corresponding to a specific SFR and star formation efficiency comparable to\nz~1 disk galaxies not hosting quasars. The implied gas mass fraction of\n~18+/-4% is consistent with the previously-observed cosmic decline since z~2.\nWe thus find no evidence for quenching of star formation in RXS J1131-1231.\nThis agrees with our finding of an elevated MBH/Mbulge ratio of >0.27+0.11%\n-0.08 compared to the local value, suggesting that the bulk of its black hole\nmass is largely in place while its stellar bulge is still assembling.\n", "  An electron cloud instability might limit the intensity in the Fermilab\nRecycler after the PIP-II upgrade. A multibunch instability typically develops\nin the horizontal plane within a hundred turns and, in certain conditions,\nleads to beam loss. Recent studies have indicated that the instability is\ncaused by an electron cloud, trapped in the Recycler index dipole magnets. We\ndeveloped an analytical model of an electron cloud driven instability with the\nelectrons trapped in combined function dipoles. The resulting instability\ngrowth rate of about 30 revolutions is consistent with experimental\nobservations and qualitatively agrees with the simulation in the PEI code. The\nmodel allows an estimation of the instability rate for the future intensity\nupgrades.\n", "  Electron cloud can lead to a fast instability in intense proton and positron\nbeams in circular accelerators. In the Fermilab Recycler the electron cloud is\nconfined within its combined function magnets. We show that the field of\ncombined function magnets traps the electron cloud, present the results of\nanalytical estimates of trapping, and compare them to numerical simulations of\nelectron cloud formation. The electron cloud is located at the beam center and\nup to 1% of the particles can be trapped by the magnetic field. Since the\nprocess of electron cloud build-up is exponential, once trapped this amount of\nelectrons significantly increases the density of the cloud on the next\nrevolution. In a Recycler combined function dipole this multi-turn accumulation\nallows the electron cloud reaching final intensities orders of magnitude\ngreater than in a pure dipole. The multi-turn build-up can be stopped by\ninjection of a clearing bunch of $10^{10}$ p at any position in the ring.\n", "  We have studied elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of $\\phi$-mesons in the framework of\na multi phase transport (AMPT) model at LHC energy. In the realms of AMPT model\nwe observe $\\phi$-mesons at intermediate transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) deviate\nfrom the previously observed (at RHIC) particle type grouping of $v_{2}$\naccording to the number of quark content i.e, baryons and mesons. Recent\nresults from the ALICE Collaboration have shown that $\\phi$-meson and proton\n$v_{2}$ has a similar trend, possibly indicating that particle type grouping\nmight be due to the mass of the particles and not the quark content. A stronger\nradial boost at LHC compared to RHIC seems to offer a consistent explanation to\nsuch observation. However, recalling that $\\phi$-mesons decouple from the\nhadronic medium before additional radial flow is build-up in the hadronic\nphase, similar pattern in $\\phi$-meson and proton $v_{2}$ may not be due to\nradial flow alone.\n  Our study reveals that models incorporating $\\phi$-meson production from\n$K\\bar{K}$ fusion in the hadronic rescattering phase also predict a comparable\nmagnitude of $\\phi$-meson and proton $v_{2}$ particularly in the intermediate\nregion of $p_{T}$. Whereas, $v_{2}$ of $\\phi$-mesons created in the partonic\nphase is in agreement with quark-coalescence motivated baryon-meson grouping of\nhadron $v_{2}$. This observation seems to provide a plausible alternative\ninterpretation for the apparent mass-like behaviour of $\\phi$-meson $v_{2}$. We\nhave also observed a violation of hydrodynamical mass ordering between proton\nand $\\phi$-meson $v_{2}$ further supporting that $\\phi$-mesons are negligibly\naffected by the collective radial flow in the hadronic phase due to the small\nin-medium hadronic interaction cross sections.\n", "  High quality optical thin film materials form a basis for on-chip photonic\nmicro- and nano-devices, where several photonic elements form an optical\ncircuit. Their realization generally requires the thin film to have a higher\nrefractive index than the substrate material. Here, we demonstrate a method of\ndepositing amorphous 25% Si doped TiO2 films on various substrates, a way of\nshaping these films into photonic elements, such as optical waveguides and\nresonators, and finally, the performance of these elements. The quality of the\nfilm is estimated by measuring thin film cavity Q-factors in excess of 10^5 at\na wavelength of 790 nm, corresponding to low propagation losses of 5.1 db/cm.\nThe fabricated photonic structures were used to optically address chromium ions\nembedded in the substrate by evanescent coupling, therefore enabling it through\nfilm-substrate interaction. Additional functionalization of the films by doping\nwith optically active rare-earth ions such as erbium is also demonstrated.\nThus, Si:TiO2 films allow for creation of high quality photonic elements, both\npassive and active and also provide access to a broad range of substrates and\nemitters embedded therein.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of protecting the state of a quantum system that\ngoes through noise, by measurements/operations before and after the noise\nprocess. The aim is to seek for the optimal protocol that makes the input and\noutput states as close as possible and clarify the role of the measurements\ntherein. We consider two cases, one can perform quantum measurements/operations\n(i) only after the noise process and (ii) both before and after that. We prove\nin the two-dimensional Hilbert space that, in the case (i), the noise\nsuppression is essentially impossible for all types of noise and, in the case\n(ii), the optimal protocol for the depolarizing noise is either the \"do\nnothing\" protocol or the \"discriminate & reprepare\" protocol. These protocols\nare not \"truly quantum\" and can be considered as classical. They involve no\nmeasurement or only use the measurement outcomes. These results describe the\nfundamental limitations in quantum mechanics from the viewpoint of control\ntheory. Finally, we conjecture that a statement similar to the case (ii) holds\nfor higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces and present some numerical evidence.\n", "  In this piece of work, the nonstandard Higgs boson masses have been\nconstrained by restrictions arising from Higgs diphoton decay width, stability,\nperturbativity, unitarity and electroweak T-parameter in the framework of the\nHiggs triplet model. As a matter of fact the loop induced Higgs decays will now\nobtain additional contributions from singly and doubly charged Higgs bosons. In\nsimulations of pair production of $H^{++}$ it is assumed that the production\nchannel $q\\overline{q}\\rightarrow \\gamma^{*},Z^{*}\\rightarrow H^{++}H^{--}$ is\nthe only mechanism. Whereas there may be other channels of production of doubly\ncharged Higgs bosons as for instance from the decay of singly charged Higgs\nbosons. The effect of this additional sources of production of the contributing\nnon-standard charged particles to the loop induced Higgs decays has been\nstudied in this paper.\n", "  When aiming at the percent precision in hadronic quantities calculated by\nmeans of lattice simulations, isospin breaking effects become relevant. These\nare of two kinds: up/down mass splitting and electromagnetic corrections. In\norder to account properly for the latter, a consistent formulation of\nelectrically-charged states in finite volume is needed. In fact on a periodic\ntorus Gauss law and large gauge transformations forbid the propagation of\nelectrically-charged states. In this talk I will review methods that have been\nused or proposed so far in order to circumvent this problem, while highlighting\npractical as well as conceptual pros and cons. I will also review and discuss\nvarious methods to calculate electromagnetic corrections to hadron masses and\ndecay rates in numerical simulations.\n", "  An analytical solution to the time evolution of decay of one and two\nidentical noninteracting particles is presented using the formalism of resonant\nstates. It is shown that the time-dependent wave function and hence the\nsurvival and nonescape probabilities for the initial state of a single particle\nand entangled symmetric and antisymmetric initial states of two identical\nparticles evolve in a distinctive form along the exponential and long-time\nnonexponential decaying regimes. In particular, for the last regime, they\nexhibit different inverse power of time behaviors.\n", "  Solar and heliospheric cosmic rays provide a unique perspective in cosmic ray\nresearch: we can observe not only the particles, but also the properties of the\nplasmas in which the they are accelerated and propagate, using in situ and\nhigh-resolution remote sensing instruments. The heliospheric cosmic ray\nobservations typically require space missions, which face stern competition\nagainst planetary and astrophysics missions, and it can take up to decades from\nthe initial concept proposal until the actual observing of the cosmic rays can\ncommence. Therefore it is important to have continuity in the cosmic ray\nmission timeline. In this overview, we review the current status and the future\noutlook in the experimental solar and heliospheric research. We find that the\ncurrent status of the available cosmic ray observations is good, but that many\nof the spacecraft are near the end of their feasible mission life. We describe\nthe three missions currently being prepared for launch, and discuss the future\noutlook of the solar and heliospheric cosmic ray missions.\n", "  The exact Green function is constructed for a quantum system, with known\nGreen function, which is decorated by two delta function impurities.It is shown\nthat when two such impurities coincide they behave as a single singular\npotential with combined amplitude. The results are extended to N impurities.\n", "  Sand fences are widely applied to prevent soil erosion by wind in areas\naffected by desertification. Sand fences also provide a way to reduce the\nemission rate of dust particles, which is triggered mainly by the impacts of\nwind-blown sand grains onto the soil and affects the Earth's climate. Many\ndifferent types of fence have been designed and their effects on the sediment\ntransport dynamics studied since many years. However, the search for the\noptimal array of fences has remained largely an empirical task. In order to\nachieve maximal soil protection using the minimal amount of fence material, a\nquantitative understanding of the flow profile over the relief encompassing the\narea to be protected including all employed fences is required. Here we use\nComputational Fluid Dynamics to calculate the average turbulent airflow through\nan array of fences as a function of the porosity, spacing and height of the\nfences. Specifically, we investigate the factors controlling the fraction of\nsoil area over which the basal average wind shear velocity drops below the\nthreshold for sand transport when the fences are applied. We introduce a cost\nfunction, given by the amount of material necessary to construct the fences. We\nfind that, for typical sand-moving wind velocities, the optimal fence height\n(which minimizes this cost function) is around $50\\,$cm, while using fences of\nheight around $1.25\\,$m leads to maximal cost.\n", "  Molecular beam epitaxy technique has been used to deposit a single layer and\na bilayer of MoSe 2 on sapphire. Extensive characterizations including in-situ\nand ex-situ measurements show that the layered MoSe 2 grows in a scalable\nmanner on the substrate and reveals characteristics of a stoichiometric\n2H-phase. The layered MoSe 2 exhibits polycrystalline features with domains\nseparated by defects and boundaries. Temperature and magnetic field dependent\nresistivity measurements unveil a carrier hopping character described within\ntwo-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism. Moreover, a negative\nmagnetoresistance was observed, stressing a fascinating feature of the charge\ntransport under the application of a magnetic field in the layered MoSe 2\nsystem. This negative magnetoresistance observed at millimeter-scale is similar\nto that observed recently at room temperature inWS2 flakes at a micrometer\nscale [Zhang et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 108, 153114 (2016)]. This scalability\nhighlights the fact that the underlying physical mechanism is intrinsic to\nthese two-dimensional materials and occurs at very short scale.\n", "  In their recent work Dias and Silvera (Science 2017) claim to have observed\nthe Wigner-Huntington transition of hydrogen to a metallic state (MH) at a\npressure of 495 GPa at low temperatures. The evidence for this transition is\nbased on a high electron carrier density deduced from a Drude free electron\nmodel fitted to the reflectivity of the sample. Based on our analysis of the\nreflectivity data we find no convincing evidence for metallic hydrogen in their\npublished data. The pressure determination is also ambiguous - it should be\n~630 GPa according to the presented Raman spectrum. For comparison, we present\nour own data on the observation of highly reflecting hydrogen at pressures of\n350-400 GPa. The appearance of metallic reflectivity is accompanied with a\nfinite electrical conductivity of the sample. We argue that the actual pressure\nin the experiment of Dias and Silvera is likely below 400 GPa. In this case the\nobserved enhanced reflectivity would be related to the phase transformation to\nconductive state published in arXiv:1601.04479.\n", "  A numerical analysis of heat conduction through the cover plate of a heat\npipe is carried out to determine the temperature of the working substance,\naverage temperature of heating and cooling surfaces, heat spread in the\ntransmitter, and the heat bypass through the cover plate. Analysis has been\nextended for the estimation of heat transfer requirements at the outer surface\nof the con- denser under different heat load conditions using Genetic\nAlgorithm. This paper also presents the estimation of an average heat transfer\ncoefficient for the boiling and condensation of the working substance inside\nthe microgrooves corresponding to a known temperature of the heat source. The\nequation of motion of the working fluid in the meniscus of an equilateral\ntriangular groove has been presented from which a new term called the minimum\nsurface tension required for avoiding the dry out condition is defined.\nQuantitative results showing the effect of thickness of cover plate, heat load,\nangle of inclination and viscosity of the working fluid on the different\naspects of the heat transfer, minimum surface tension required to avoid dry\nout, velocity distribution of the liquid, and radius of liquid meniscus inside\nthe micro-grooves have been presented and discussed.\n", "  We investigate spin-dependent thermoelectric transport through a system of\ntwo coupled quantum dots attached to reservoirs of spin-polarized electrons.\nGenerally, we focus on the strongly correlated regime of transport. To this\nend, a slave-boson method for finite $U$ is employed. Our main goal is to show\nthat, apart from complex low-temperature physics, such a basic multilevel\nsystem provides a possibility to examine various quantum interference effects,\nwith particular emphasis put on the influence of such phenomena on\nthermoelectric transport. Apart from the influence of interference effects on\nspin-degenerate charge transport, we show how spin-dependent transport, induced\nby ferromagnetic leads, can be modified as well. Finally, we also consider the\ncase where the spin-relaxation time in the ferromagnetic leads is relatively\nlong, which leads to the so-called spin thermoelectric effects.\n", "  We report the mechanical properties of the `giant' negative compressibility\nmaterial zinc(II) dicyanoaurate, as determined using a combination of\nsingle-crystal nanoindentation measurements and \\emph{ab initio} density\nfunctional theory calculations. While the elastic response of zinc\ndicyanoaurate is found to be intermediate to the behaviour of dense and open\nframework structures, we discover the material to exhibit a particularly strong\nelastic recovery, which is advantageous for a range of practical applications.\nWe attribute this response to the existence of supramolecular helices that\nfunction as atomic-scale springs, storing mechanical energy during compressive\nstress and hence inhibiting plastic deformation. Our results are consistent\nwith the relationship noted in [Cheng \\& Cheng, \\textit{Appl. Phys. Lett.},\n1998, {\\textbf{73}}, 614] between the magnitude of elastic recovery, on the one\nhand, and the ratio of material hardness to Young's modulus, on the other hand.\nDrawing on comparisons with other metal--organic frameworks containing helical\nstructure motifs, we suggest helices as an attractive supramolecular motif for\nimparting resistance to plastic deformation in the design of functional\nmaterials.\n", "  Data from a three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation of a turbulent\npremixed Bunsen flame at a low global Lewis number are analyzed to address the\neffects of the curvature on the local flame front. For this purpose, the\nchemical kinetics is modeled according to a reduced scheme, involving 5\nreactions and 7 species, to mimic a H$_{2}$/Air flame at equivalence ratio\n$\\phi=0.5$. An increase of the local temperature and reaction rate is found for\nfronts elongated into the fresh gases (concave), while local quenching is\nobserved for fronts elongated in the opposite direction (convex), i.e. towards\nthe burnt mixture. Data show that the occurrence in the reaction region of\nthese super-reactive (concave fronts) and quenched zones (convex fronts) is\npredominant compared to a behavior compatible with the corresponding\nunstretched laminar flame. In particular, well inside the reaction region, the\nprobability density function of the OH radical concentration shows a bi-modal\nshape with peaks corresponding to negative (concave) and positive (convex)\ncurvatures, while a locally flat front is less frequently detected. The two\nstates are associated with a higher and lower chemical activity with respect\nthe laminar case. Additional statistics conditioned to the local hydrogen\nconcentration provide further information on this dual-state dynamics and on\nthe differences with respect to the corresponding laminar unstretched flame\nwhen moving from the fresh to the burnt gas regions. Finally we discuss the\neffects of the turbulence on the thermo-diffusive instability showing that the\nturbulent fluctuations, increasing the flame front corrugations, are\nessentially responsible of the local flame quenching.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate an ultrasonic communication link using spatial\ndegrees of freedom to increase data rates for deeply implantable medical\ndevices. Low attenuation and millimeter wavelengths make ultrasound an ideal\ncommunication medium for miniaturized low-power implants. While small spectral\nbandwidth has drastically limited achievable data rates in conventional\nultrasonic implants, large spatial bandwidth can be exploited by using multiple\ntransducers in a multiple-input/multiple-output system to provide spatial\nmultiplexing gain without additional power, larger bandwidth, or complicated\npackaging. We experimentally verify the communication link in mineral oil with\na transmitter and receiver 5 cm apart, each housing two custom-designed\nmm-sized piezoelectric transducers operating at the same frequency. Two streams\nof data modulated with quadrature phase-shift keying at 125 kbps are\nsimultaneously transmitted and received on both channels, effectively doubling\nthe data rate to 250 kbps with a measured bit error rate below 1e-4. We also\nevaluate the performance and robustness of the channel separation network by\ntesting the communication link after introducing position offsets. These\nresults demonstrate the potential of spatial multiplexing to enable more\ncomplex implant applications requiring higher data rates.\n", "  We experimentally realize a measurement-device-independent quantum key\ndistribution (MDI-QKD) system based on cost-effective and commercially\navailable hardware such as distributed feedback (DFB) lasers and\nfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) that enable time-bin qubit preparation\nand time-tagging, and active feedback systems that allow for compensation of\ntime-varying properties of photons after transmission through deployed fibre.\nWe examine the performance of our system, and conclude that its design does not\ncompromise performance. Our demonstration paves the way for MDI-QKD-based\nquantum networks in star-type topology that extend over more than 100 km\ndistance.\n", "  The transfer line for beam extraction from the Recycler ring to P1 line\nprovides a way to deliver 8 GeV kinetic energy protons from the Booster to the\nDelivery ring, via the Recycler, using existing beam transport lines, and\nwithout the need for new civil construction. It was designed in 2012. The\nkicker magnets at RR520 and the lambertson magnet at RR522 in the RR were\ninstalled in 2014 Summer Shutdown, the elements of RR to P1 Stub (permanent\nquads, trim quads, correctors, BPMs, the toroid at 703 and vertical bending\ndipole at V703 (ADCW) were installed in 2015 Summer Shutdown. On Tuesday, June\n21, 2016, beam line from the Recycler Ring to P1 line was commissioned. The\ndetailed results will be presented in this report.\n", "  The small correction volume for conventional wavefront shaping methods limits\ntheir applications in biological imaging through scattering media. We\ndemonstrate large volume wavefront shaping through a scattering layer with a\nsingle correction by conjugate adaptive optics and remote focusing (CAORF). The\nremote focusing module can keep the conjugation between the AO and scattering\nlayer during three-dimensional scanning. This new configuration provides a\nwider correction volume by the best utilization of the memory effect in a fast\nthree-dimensional laser scanning microscope. Our results show that the proposed\nsystem can provide 10 times wider axial field of view compared with a\nconventional conjugate AO system when 16,384 segments are used on a spatial\nlight modulator. We also demonstrated three-dimensional fluorescence imaging\nand multi-spot patterning through a scattering layer.\n", "  The Hierarchical Schur Complement method (HSC), and the HSC-extension, have\nsignificantly accelerated the evaluation of the retarded Green's function,\nparticularly the lesser Green's function, for two-dimensional nanoscale\ndevices. In this work, the HSC-extension is applied to determine the solution\nof non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) on three-dimensional nanoscale\ndevices. The operation count for the HSC-extension is analyzed for a cuboid\ndevice. When a cubic device is discretized with $N \\times N \\times N$ grid\npoints, the state-of-the-art Recursive Green Function (RGF) algorithm takes\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^7)$ operations, whereas the HSC-extension only requires\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ operations. %Realistic operation counts also depend on the\nsystem dimensions in $xyz$-directions and the form of contact self-energy\nmatrix. Operation counts and runtimes are also studied for three-dimensional\nnanoscale devices of practical interest: a graphene-boron\\- nitride-graphene\nmultilayer system, a silicon nanowire, and a DNA molecule. The numerical\nexperiments indicate that the cost for the HSC-extension is proportional to the\nsolution of one linear system (or one LU-factorization) and that the runtime\nspeed-ups over RGF exceed three orders of magnitude when simulating realistic\ndevices, such as a graphene-boron nitride-graphene multilayer system with\n40,000 atoms.\n", "  In static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we solve the Einstein Maxwell\nequations. The effective gravitational potential and the electric field for\ncharged anisotropic fluid are defined in terms of two free parameters. For such\nconfiguration, the mass of the star as a function of stellar radius is found in\nterms of two aforementioned parameters, subjected to certain stability\ncriteria. For various values of these two parameters one finds that such mass\nradius relationship can model stellar objects located at various regions of\nHertzsprung-Russel diagram.\n", "  In this article, a few problems related to multiscale modelling of magnetic\nmaterials at finite temperatures and possible ways of solving these problems\nare discussed. The discussion is mainly centred around two established\nmultiscale concepts: the partitioned domain and the upscaling-based\nmethodologies. The major challenge for both multiscale methods is to capture\nthe correct value of magnetisation length accurately, which is affected by a\nrandom temperature-dependent force. Moreover, general limitations of these\nmultiscale techniques in application to spin systems are discussed.\n", "  We summarise the achievements of the AstroGrid-PL project, which aims to\nprovide an infrastructure grid computing, distributed storage and Virtual\nObservatory services to the Polish astronomical community. It was developed\nfrom 2011-2015 as a domain grid component within the larger PLGrid Plus project\nfor scientific computing in Poland.\n", "  Random numbers are an important resource for applications such as numerical\nsimulation and secure communication. However, it is difficult to certify\nwhether a physical random number generator is truly unpredictable. Here, we\nexploit the phenomenon of quantum nonlocality in a loophole-free photonic Bell\ntest experiment for the generation of randomness that cannot be predicted\nwithin any physical theory that allows one to make independent measurement\nchoices and prohibits superluminal signaling. To certify and quantify the\nrandomness, we describe a new protocol that performs well in an experimental\nregime characterized by low violation of Bell inequalities. Applying an\nextractor function to our data, we obtained 256 new random bits, uniform to\nwithin 0.001.\n", "  This paper describes the performance of a prototype timing detector, based on\n50 micrometer thick Ultra Fast Silicon Detector, as measured in a beam test\nusing a 180 GeV/c momentum pion beam. The dependence of the time precision on\nthe pixel capacitance and the bias voltage is investigated here. A timing\nprecision from 30 ps to 100 ps, depending on the pixel capacitance, has been\nmeasured at a bias voltage of 180 V. Timing precision has also been measured as\na function of the bias voltage.\n", "  We use molecular simulation to study the structural and dynamic properties of\nglassy nanoclusters formed both through the direct condensation of the vapor\nbelow the glass transition temperature, without the presence of a substrate,\nand \\textit{via} the slow supercooling of unsupported liquid nanodroplets. An\nanalysis of local structure using Voronoi polyhedra shows that the energetic\nstability of the clusters is characterized by a large, increasing fraction of\nbicapped square antiprism motifs. We also show that nanoclusters with similar\ninherent structure energies are structurally similar, independent of their\nhistory, which suggests the supercooled clusters access the same low energy\nregions of the potential energy landscape as the vapor condensed clusters\ndespite their different methods of formation. By measuring the intermediate\nscattering function at different radii from the cluster center, we find that\nthe relaxation dynamics of the clusters are inhomogeneous, with the core\nbecoming glassy above the glass transition temperature while the surface\nremains mobile at low temperatures. This helps the clusters sample the highly\nstable, low energy structures on the potential energy surface. Our work\nsuggests the nanocluster systems are structurally more stable than the\nultra-stable glassy thin films, formed through vapor deposition onto a cold\nsubstrate, but the nanoclusters do not exhibit the superheating effects\ncharacteristic of the ultra-stable glass states.\n", "  In 1626, the Venetian physician Santorio Santorio published the details of\nhis pulsilogium, a stop clock that could accurately measure one's pulse rate.\nHe applied Galileo Galilei's insights that the frequency of a pendulum's\noscillation is inversely proportional to the square root of its length.\nSantorio's inventions emerged at a time when the natural world and our solar\nsystem were beginning to be mapped in remarkable detail. Santorio was a true\nrepresentative of his era, a period in which scientific developments came in\nrapid succession and measurements to support hypotheses became the norm.\n", "  A range of unique capabilities in optical and microwave signal processing\nhave been demonstrated using stimulated Brillouin scattering. The desire to\nharness Brillouin scattering in mass manufacturable integrated circuits has led\nto a focus on silicon-based material platforms. Remarkable progress in\nsilicon-based Brillouin waveguides has been made, but results have been\nhindered by nonlinear losses present at telecommunications wavelengths. Here,\nwe report a new approach to surpass this issue through the integration of a\nhigh Brillouin gain material, As2S3, onto a silicon chip. We fabricated a\ncompact spiral device, within a silicon circuit, achieving an order of\nmagnitude improvement in Brillouin amplification. To establish the flexibility\nof this approach, we fabricated a ring resonator with free spectral range\nprecisely matched to the Brillouin shift, enabling the first demonstration of\nBrillouin lasing in a silicon integrated circuit. Combining active photonic\ncomponents with the SBS devices shown here will enable the creation of compact,\nmass manufacturable optical circuits with enhanced functionality.\n", "  The light curves and spectral properties of more than 200 $\\gamma$-ray\npulsars have been measured in unsurpassed detail in the eight years since the\nlaunch of the hugely successful Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) $\\gamma$-ray\nmission. We performed geometric pulsar light curve modelling using static,\nretarded vacuum, and offset polar cap (PC) dipole $B$-fields (the latter is\ncharacterized by a parameter $\\epsilon$), in conjunction with standard two-pole\ncaustic (TPC) and outer gap (OG) emission geometries. In addition to\nconstant-emissivity geometric models, we also considered a slot gap (SG)\n$E$-field associated with the offset-PC dipole $B$-field and found that its\ninclusion leads to qualitatively different light curves. We therefore find that\nthe assumed $B$-field and especially the $E$-field structure, as well as the\nemission geometry (magnetic inclination and observer angles), have a great\nimpact on the pulsar's visibility and its high-energy pulse shape. We compared\nour model light curves to the superior-quality $\\gamma$-ray light curve of the\nVela pulsar (for energies $>100$ MeV). Our overall optimal light curve fit\n(with the lowest $\\chi^2$ value) is for the retarded vacuum dipole field and OG\nmodel. We found that smaller values of $\\epsilon$ are favoured for the\noffset-PC dipole field when assuming constant emissivity, and larger $\\epsilon$\nvalues are favoured for variable emissivity, but not significantly so. When we\nincreased the relatively low SG $E$-fields we found improved light curve fits,\nwith the inferred pulsar geometry being closer to best fits from independent\nstudies in this case. In particular, we found that such a larger SG $E$-field\n(leading to variable emissivity) gives a second overall best fit. This and\nother indications point to the fact that the actual $E$-field may be larger\nthan predicted by the SG model.\n", "  In 2013, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory located at the geographic South\nPole detected evidence for a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux above ~60 TeV.\nTo this day, IceCube has operated with full detector configuration for more\nthan 6 years. The observed astrophysical neutrino flux has been confirmed with\n> 6$\\sigma$ significance with both events starting within the detector (all\nflavor) and events traversing through the Earth ($\\nu_{\\mu}$ charged-current).\nSomewhat equal flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos is expected at Earth\nassuming standard thorough oscillation. A search for tau neutrinos has been\ncarried out but yielded null result. No neutrino sources have been found to\ncontribute significantly to the diffuse flux at this point. In this paper, we\nwill review the current status of the astrophysical neutrino flux, discuss the\nquest for neutrino point sources and overview the proposed design and physics\npotentials of the future IceCube-Gen2.\n", "  We consider methods for constructing explicit solutions of the non-stationary\nLam\\'e equation, which is a generalization of the classical Lam\\'e equation,\nthat has appeared in works on integrable models, conformal field theory, high\nenergy physics and representation theory. We also present a general method for\nconstructing integral representations of solutions to the non-stationary Lam\\'e\nequation by a recursive scheme. Explicit integral representations, for special\nvalues of the model parameters, are also presented. Our approach is based on\nkernel function methods which can be naturally generalized to the\nnon-stationary Heun equation.\n", "  We report here the results of Molecular Dynamics simulations of the drift\nmobility of negative oxygen ions in very dense neon gas in the supercritical\nphase. The simulations relatively well reproduce the trend of the experimental\ndata. The rationalization of the mobility behavior as a function of the gas\ndensity is given in terms of the number of atoms correlated in the first\nsolvation shell around the ion.\n", "  The Donnan model describes the electric double layer structure inside carbon\nmicropores and is an essential element of larger-scale models for capacitive\nand Faradaic porous carbon electrodes for energy storage and water\ndesalination. The Donnan model was not yet developed to describe the expansion\nof carbon electrodes upon charging. Here we provide a simple theory which\npredicts that the one-dimensional expansion of a carbon particle scales with\nelectrode charge density according to a 4/3$^\\text{rd}$ power.\n", "  This paper addresses the question of whether the International Linear\nCollider has the capability of discovering new particles that have not already\nbeen discovered at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We summarize the various\npaths to discovery offered by the ILC, and discuss them in the context of three\ndifferent scenarios: 1. LHC does not discover any new particles, 2. LHC\ndiscovers some new low mass states and 3. LHC discovers new heavy particles. We\nwill show that in each case, ILC plays a critical role in discovery of new\nphenomena and in pushing forward the frontiers of high-energy physics as well\nas our understanding of the universe in a manner which is highly complementary\nto that of LHC.\n  For the busy reader, a two-page executive summary is provided at the\nbeginning of the document.\n", "  We review recent progress in the calculation of the decay constants $f_{D}$\nand $f_{D_s}$ from lattice QCD. We focus particularly on simulations with\n$N_f=2+1$ and $N_f=2+1+1$ and simulations with close to physical light quark\nmasses.\n", "  The contribution of $O^{2-}$ ions to antiferromagnetism in\n$La_{2-x}Ae_xCuO_4$ ($Ae = Sr, Ba)$ is highly sensitive to doped holes. In\ncontrast, the contribution of $Cu^{2+}$ ions to antiferromagnetism in\n$Nd_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_{4+y}$ is much less sensitive to doped electrons. The\ndifference causes the precarious and, respectively, robust antiferromagnetic\nphase of these cuprates. The same sensitivities affect the doping dependence of\nthe incommensurability of density waves, $\\delta (x)$. In the hole-doped\ncompounds this gives rise to a doping offset for magnetic and charge density\nwaves, $\\delta_{m,c}^p(x) \\propto \\sqrt{x-x_{0p}^N}$. Here $x_{0p}^N$ is the\ndoping concentration where the N\\'{e}el temperature vanishes, $T_N(x_{0p}^N) =\n0$. No such doping offset occurs for density waves in the electron-doped\ncompound. Instead, excess oxygen (necessary for stability in crystal growth) of\nconcentration $y$ causes a different doping offset in the latter case,\n$\\delta_{m,c}^n(x) \\propto \\sqrt{x- 2y}$. The square-root formulas result from\nthe assumption of superlattice formation through partitioning of the $CuO_2$\nplane by pairs of itinerant charge carriers. Agreement of observed\nincommensurability $\\delta(x)$ with the formulas is very good for the\nhole-doped compounds and reasonable for the electron-doped compound. The\ndeviation in the latter case may be caused by residual excess oxygen.\n", "  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs, $\\chi$) are candidates for Dark\nMatter. WIMP searches at lepton colliders are complementary to searches at\nhadron colliders and direct and indirect detection, since they directly probe\nthe coupling to electrons which a priori is independent of the coupling to\nhadrons. Like at hadron colliders, WIMP pair production can be observed via an\nadditional tag particle, in particular a photon from initial state radiation\n($e^+e^-\\rightarrow\\chi\\chi\\gamma$). With this technique WIMP masses to nearly\nhalf the centre-of-mass energy can be probed. Polarised beams are essential to\nreduce Standard Model backgrounds and to characterize the properties of the new\nparticles in case a signal is discovered. Prospects for a mono-photon WIMP\nstudy at the International Linear Collider will be discussed in the context of\nEFT. In addition, detector requirements will be presented.\n", "  Active control over the shape, composition and crystalline habit of\nnanocrystals is a long sought-after goal. Various methods have been shown to\nenable post-synthesis modification of nanoparticles, including the use of the\nKirkendall effect, galvanic replacement and cation or anion exchange, all\ntaking advantage of enhanced solid-state diffusion on the nanoscale. In all\nthese processes, however, alteration of the nanoparticles requires introduction\nof new precursor materials. Here we show that for cesium lead halide perovskite\nnanoparticles, a reversible structural and compositional change can be induced\nat room temperature solely by modification of the ligand composition in\nsolution. Reversible transformation of cubic CsPbX3 nanocrystals to\nrhombohedral Cs4PbX6 nanocrystals is achieved by controlling the ratio of\noleylamine to oleic acid capping molecules. This scheme does not only enable\nfabrication of high purity monodisperse Cs4PbX6 nanoparticles with controlled\nsizes. Rather, dependent on the Cs4PbX6 nanoparticles final size afforded by\nreaction time, the back reaction yields CsPbX3 nanoplatelets with controlled\nthickness. These results shed some light on the unique properties of this\nfamily of materials, provide hints to the origin of their superb photovoltaic\nperformance and point at possible routes for their controlled fabrication and\nstabilization.\n", "  We describe in general terms the practical use in astronomy of a higher-order\nstatistical quantity called Spectral Kurtosis (SK), and describe the first\nimplementation of SK-enabled firmware in the F-engine (Fourier\ntransform-engine) of a digital FX correlator for Expanded Owens Valley Solar\nArray (EOVSA). The development of the theory for SK is summarized, leading to\nan expression for generalized SK that is applicable to both SK spectrometers\nand those not specifically designed for SK. We also give the means for\ncomputing both the SK estimator and thresholds for its application as a\ndiscriminator of RFI contamination. Tests of the performance of EOVSA as an SK\nspectrometer are shown to agree precisely with theoretical expectations, and\nthe methods for configuring the correlator for correct SK operation are\ndescribed.\n", "  Porous silicon layers (PS) have been prepared in this work via\nPhotoelectrochemical etching process (PEC) of n type silicon wafer of 0.8\n\u007fohm.cm resistivity in hydrofluoric (HF) acid of 24.5 precent concentration at\ndifferent etching times (5 to 25 min.). The irradiation has been achieved using\nTungsten lamp with different wavelengths (450 nm, 535 nm and 700 nm). The\nmorphological properties of these layers such as surface morphology, Porosity,\nlayer thickness, and also the etching rate have been investigated using optical\nmicroscopy and the gravimetric method.\n", "  As power grids incorporate increased renewable generation such as wind and\nsolar, their variability creates growing challenges for grid stability and\nefficiency. We study two facets: power the grid is unable to accept\n(curtailment), and power that is assigned zero economic value by the grid\n(negative or zero price). Collectively we term these \"stranded power\" or SP.\n  We study stranded power in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator\n(MISO), characterizing quantity and temporal structure. First, stranded power\nis available in the MISO grid 99% of the time, and often in intervals >100\nhours, with characteristic seasonal and time-of-day patterns. Average stranded\npower often exceeds 1 GW, with duty factors as high as 30%. About 30% of all\nwind generation in MISO is stranded. Examination of the top 10 individual sites\nshows stranded power can be as high as 70% duty factor and 250MW. Trends over\nthe past 3.5 years suggest stranded power is a persistent phenomenon. The study\ncharacterizes opportunities to exploit stranded power.\n  We consider using energy storage to increase the utility of stranded power.\nFor a range of power levels and uniformly-distributed storage, adding 5 hours\nof storage doubles duty factor to 30% at 4MW, but another 95 hours is required\nfor the next 15% increase. At 4MW with 50 hours of storage, only 3 of 200 sites\nreach 100% duty factor, and with 100 hours required for the next 10 sites.\nHigher power levels require 100's of hours. Storage at the top 10 sites is more\nproductive, 5 hours increases duty factor to 70% at 4MW, but further storage\nhas diminishing benefits. Studies of the amount of power served by storage show\nthat distribution to the best sites provides 2 to 3.7-fold advantages over\nuniform distribution.\n", "  Emerging technologies based on liquid crystal (LC) materials increasingly\nleverage the presence of nanoscale defects, unlike the canonical application of\nLCs -- LC displays. The inherent nanoscale characteristics of LC defects\npresent both significant opportunities and barriers for the application of this\nfascinating class of materials. Simulation-based approaches to the study of the\neffects of confinement and interface anchoring conditions on LC domains has\nresulted in significant progress over the past decade, where simulations are\nnow able to access experimentally-relevant micron-scales while simultaneously\ncapturing nanoscale defect structures. In this work, continuum simulations were\nperformed in order to study the dynamics of micron-scale nematic LC droplets of\nvarying spheroidal geometry. Nematic droplets are one of the simplest\ninherently defect-containing LC structures and are also relevant to\npolymer-dispersed LC-based \"smart\" window technology. Simulation results\ninclude nematic phase formation and external field-switching dynamics of\ndroplets ranging in shape from oblate to prolate. Results include both\nqualitative and quantitative insight into the complex coupling of nanoscale\ndefect dynamics and structure transitions to micron-scale reorientation.\nDynamic mechanisms are presented and related to structural transitions in LC\ndefects present in the droplet. Droplet-scale metrics including order\nparameters and response times are determined for a range of\nexperimentally-accessible electric field strengths. These results have both\nfundamental and technological relevance, in that increased understanding of LC\ndynamics in the presence of defects is a key barrier to continued advancement\nin the field.\n", "  The critical infrastructures of the nation such as the power grid and the\ncommunication network are highly interdependent. Also, it has been observed\nthat there exists complex interdependent relationships between individual\nentities of the power grid and the communication network that further\nobfuscates the analysis, and mitigation of faults in such multi-layered\nnetworks. In recent years, the research community has made significant efforts\ntowards gaining insight and understanding of the interdependency relations in\nsuch multi-layered networks, and accordingly, a number of models have been\nproposed and analyzed towards realizing this goal. In this chapter we study\nexisting interdependency models proposed in the recent literature and discuss\ntheir approach, and inherent features, towards modeling interdependent\nmulti-layer networks. We also provide a brief discussion into the drawbacks of\neach of these models and propose an alternate model that addresses these\ndrawbacks by capturing the interdependency relationships using a combination of\nconjunctive and disjunctive relations.\n", "  A model is developed describing the energy distribution of quasi-particles in\na quasi-one dimensional, normal metal wire, where the transport is diffusive,\nconnected between equilibrium reservoirs. When an ac bias is applied to the\nwire by means of the reservoirs, the statistics of the charge carriers is\ninfluence by the formed non-equilibrium. The proposed model is derived from\nGreen function formalism. The quasi-particle energy distribution is calculated\nwith a quantum diffusion equation including a collision term accounting for\ninelastic scattering. The ac bias, due to high frequency irradiation, drives\nthe wire out of equilibrium. For coherent transport the photon absorption\nprocesses create multiple photon steps in the energy distribution, where the\nnumber of steps is dependent on the relation between the amplitude of the field\neV and the photon energy \\omega. Furthermore we observe that for the slow field\nregime, \\omega \\tau_D < 1, the photon absorption is highly time-dependent. In\nthe fast field regime \\omega \\tau_D > 1 this time-dependency disappears and the\nphoton steps in the distribution have a fixed value. When the wire is extended,\nthe transport becomes incoherent due to interaction processes, like\nelectron-electron interaction and electron-phonon interaction. These\ninteractions give rise to a redistribution of the quasi-particles with respect\nto the energy. We focused on the fast field regime and concluded that the\nstrong interaction limit for both mechanisms gives the expected result. Strong\nelectron-phonon interaction forces the distribution function on every position\nin the wire to become a Fermi function with the bath temperature, while strong\nelectron-electron interaction causes an effective temperature profile across\nthe wire and the distribution function on every position in the wire is a Fermi\nfunction with an effective temperature.\n", "  Several UV complete models of physics beyond the Standard Model are currently\nunder scrutiny, their low-energy dynamics being compared with the experimental\ndata from the LHC. Lattice simulations can play a role in these studies by\nproviding a first principles computations of the low-energy constants that\ndescribe this low-energy dynamics. In this work, we study in detail a specific\nmodel recently proposed by Ferretti, and discuss the potential impact of\nlattice calculations.\n", "  Sampling from large networks represents a fundamental challenge for social\nnetwork research. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of different\nsampling techniques (node sampling, edge sampling, random walk sampling, and\nsnowball sampling) on social networks with attributes. We consider the special\ncase of networks (i) where we have one attribute with two values (e.g., male\nand female in the case of gender), (ii) where the size of the two groups is\nunequal (e.g., a male majority and a female minority), and (iii) where nodes\nwith the same or different attribute value attract or repel each other (i.e.,\nhomophilic or heterophilic behavior). We evaluate the different sampling\ntechniques with respect to conserving the position of nodes and the visibility\nof groups in such networks. Experiments are conducted both on synthetic and\nempirical social networks. Our results provide evidence that different network\nsampling techniques are highly sensitive with regard to capturing the expected\ncentrality of nodes, and that their accuracy depends on relative group size\ndifferences and on the level of homophily that can be observed in the network.\nWe conclude that uninformed sampling from social networks with attributes thus\ncan significantly impair the ability of researchers to draw valid conclusions\nabout the centrality of nodes and the visibility or invisibility of groups in\nsocial networks.\n", "  The magnetic field noise in superconducting quantum interference devices\n(SQUIDs) used for biomagnetic research such as magnetoencephalography or\nultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance is usually limited by instrumental\ndewar noise. We constructed a wideband, ultra-low noise system with a 45 mm\ndiameter superconducting pick-up coil inductively coupled to a current sensor\nSQUID. Thermal noise in the liquid helium dewar is minimized by using\naluminized polyester fabric as superinsulation and aluminum oxide strips as\nheat shields, respectively. With a magnetometer pick-up coil in the center of\nthe Berlin magneti- cally shielded room 2 (BMSR2) a noise level of around 150\naT Hz$^{-1/2}$ is achieved in the white noise regime between about 20 kHz and\nthe system bandwidth of about 2.5 MHz. At lower frequencies, the resolution is\nlimited by magnetic field noise arising from the walls of the shielded room.\nModeling the BMSR2 as a closed cube with continuous \\mu-metal walls we can\nquantitatively reproduce its measured field noise.\n", "  Hadronic tau decays belong to the processes that show a resonance-like\nstructure in the axial vector current in the $1-2$ GeV range. This structure,\noften denoted as the $a_1$ meson, seems to show different properties in\ndifferent processes. The process $\\tau\\rightarrow 3\\pi\\nu_{\\tau}$ allows for a\nclean separation of weak and strong effects and a clear production mechanism.\nWe examine how this structure can be related to interactions between the three\npions that emerge in the final state. In particular we start from the\ninteractions between all two body combinations.\n", "  These lecture notes review the theoretical background to the Higgs boson,\nprovide an introduction to its phenomenology, and describe the experimental\ntests that lead us to think that \"beyond any reasonable doubt, it is a Higgs\nboson\". Motivations for expecting new physics beyond the Standard Model are\nrecalled, and the Standard Model effective field theory is advocated as a tool\nto help search for it. The phenomenology of $N = 1$ and $N = 2$ supersymmetric\nHiggs bosons is reviewed, and the prospects for possible future Higgs factories\nare previewed.\n", "  We present the Swift optical to X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of\n44 quasars at redshifts z~2 observed by Swift, part of a larger program to\nestablish and characterize the optical through X-ray SEDs of moderate-redshift\nquasars. Here we outline our analysis approach and present preliminary analysis\nand results for the first third of the full quasar sample. Not all quasars in\nthe sample are detected in X-rays; all of the X-ray detected objects so far are\nradio loud. As expected for radio loud objects, they are X-ray bright relative\nto radio-quiet quasars of comparable optical luminosities, with an average\nalpha_ox = 1.39 +/- 0.03 (where alpha_ox is the power-law slope connecting the\nmonochromatic flux at 2500 Ang and at 2 keV), and display hard X-ray spectra.\nWe find integrated 3000 Ang - 25 keV accretion luminosities of between\n0.7*10^(46) erg s^(-1) and 5.2*10^(47) erg s^(-1). Based on single-epoch\nspectroscopic virial black hole mass estimates, we find that these quasars are\naccreting at substantial Eddington fractions, 0.1 \\le L/LEdd \\le 1.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of resonant Raman\nspectroscopy in single- and triple-layer MoTe$_2$. Raman intensities are\ncomputed entirely from first principles by calculating finite differences of\nthe dielectric susceptibility. In our analysis, we investigate the role of\nquantum interference effects and the electron-phonon coupling. With this\nmethod, we explain the experimentally observed intensity inversion of the\n$A^\\prime_1$ vibrational modes in triple-layer MoTe2 with increasing laser\nphoton energy. Finally, we show that a quantitative comparison with\nexperimental data requires the proper inclusion of excitonic effects.\n", "  We report squeezed polariton generation using parametric polariton four-wave\nmixing in semiconductor microcavities in the strong coupling regime. The\ngeometry of the experiment corresponds to degenerate four-wave mixing, which\ngives rise to a bistability threshold. Spatial effects in the nonlinear regime\nare evidenced, and spatial filtering is required in order to optimize the\nmeasured squeezing. By measuring the noise of the outgoing light, we infer a 9\npercent squeezing on the polariton field close to the bistability turning\npoint.\n", "  The quantum correlations between the beams generated by polariton pair\nscattering in a semiconductor microcavity above the parametric oscillation\nthreshold are computed analytically. The influence of various parameters like\nthe cavity-exciton detuning, the intensity mismatch between the signal and\nidler beams and the amount of spurious noise is analyzed. We show that very\nstrong quantum correlations between the signal and idler polaritons can be\nachieved. The quantum effects on the outgoing light fields are strongly reduced\ndue to the large mismatch in the coupling of the signal and idler polaritons to\nthe external photons.\n", "  We report the observation of polaritonic bistability in semiconductor\nmicrocavities in the strong coupling regime. The origin of bistability is the\npolariton-polariton interaction, which gives rise to a Kerr-like nonlinearity.\nThe experimental results are in good agreement with a simple model taking\ntransverse effects into account.\n", "  We demonstrate a novel kind of polariton four wave mixing oscillation. Two\npump polaritons scatter towards final states that emit two beams of equal\nintensity, separated both spatially and in polarization with respect to the\npumps. The measurement of the intensity fluctuations of the emitted light\ndemonstrates that the final states are strongly correlated.\n", "  We investigate the short-time critical dynamics of the Baxter-Wu (BW) and\n$n=3$ Turban (3TU) models to estimate their global persistence exponent $\\theta\n_{g}$. We conclude that this new dynamical exponent can be useful in detecting\ndifferences between the critical behavior of these models which are very\ndifficult to obtain in usual simulations. In addition, we estimate again the\ndynamical exponents of the four-state Potts (FSP) model in order to compare\nthem with results previously obtained for the BW and 3TU models and to decide\nbetween two sets of estimates presented in the current literature. We also\nrevisit the short-time dynamics of the 3TU model in order to check if, as\nalready found for the FSP model, the anomalous dimension of the initial\nmagnetization $x_{0}$ could be equal to zero.\n", "  We present novel experimental results demonstrating the coherence properties\nof the nonlinear emission from semiconductor microcavities in the strong\ncoupling regime, recently interpreted by parametric polariton four-wave mixing.\nWe use a geometry corresponding to degenerate four-wave mixing. In addition to\nthe predicted threshold dependence of the emission on the pump power and\nspectral blue shift, we observe a phase dependence of the amplification which\nis a signature of a coherent polariton wave mixing process.\n", "  We describe the current status of high-precision ab initio calculations of\nthe spectra of molecular hydrogen ions (H_2^+ and HD^+) and of two experiments\nfor vibrational spectroscopy. The perspectives for a comparison between theory\nand experiment at a level of 1 ppb are considered.\n", "  We report on the operation of a 50 mW continuous wave quantum cascade laser\n(QCL) in the 9.2 micrometer range, phase locked to a single mode CO2 laser with\na tunable frequency offset. The wide free running emission spectrum of the QCL\n(3-5 MHz) is strongly narrowed down to the kHz range making it suitable for\nhigh resolution molecular spectroscopy.\n", "  We present a nonrelativistic calculation of the rotation-vibration levels of\nthe molecular ions H2+, D2+ and HD+, relying on the diagonalization of the\nexact three-body Hamiltonian. The J=2 levels are obtained with a very high\naccuracy of 10^{-14} a.u. (for most levels) representing an improvement by five\norders of magnitude over previous calculations. The accuracy is also improved\nfor the J=1 levels of H2+ and D2+ with respect to earlier works. Moreover, we\nhave computed the sensitivities of the energy levels with respect to the mass\nratios, allowing these levels to be used for metrological purposes.\n", "  A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal\ncomputing device; that is, it is believed able to simulate any physical\ncomputing device with an increase in computation time of at most a polynomial\nfactor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into\nconsideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete\nlogarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical\ncomputer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems.\nEfficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a\nhypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps\npolynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be\nfactored.\n"]}
