At the early phase we get\nEinstien-deSitter type of solution generalised to inhomogeneous spacetime. But\nat late stage of the evolution our solutions admit the accelerating nature of\nthe universe. For a large scale factor our model behaves like a ?CDM model. We\ncalculate the deceleration parameter for this anisotropic model, which, unlike\nits homogeneous counterpart, shows that the flip is not syn- chronous occurring\nearly at the outer shells. This is in line with other physical processes in any\ninhomogeneous models. Depending upon initial conditions our solution also gives\nbouncing universe. In the absence of inhomogeneity our solution reduces to\nwellknown solutions in homogeneous case. We have also calculated the effective\ndeceleration parameter in terms of Hubble parameter. The whole situation is\nlater discussed with the help of wellknown Raychaudhury equation and the\nresults are compared with the previous case. This work is an extension of our\nrecent communication where an attempt was made to see if the presence of extra\ndimensions and/or inhomogeneity can trigger an inflation in a matter dominated\nLemaitre Tolman Bondi model.\n", "  Astrophysical black hole candidates are thought to be the Kerr black holes\npredicted by General Relativity, but the actual nature of these objects has\nstill to be proven. The Kerr black hole hypothesis can be tested by observing\nstrong gravity features and check if they are in agreement with the predictions\nof General Relativity. In particular, the study of the properties of the\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas of the accretion disk can provide\ninformation on the geometry of the space-time around these objects and\nconstrain possible deviations from the Kerr background.\n", "  Magnetic excitations in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ distorted kagome lattice\nantiferromagnet Cs$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$, which has an ordered ground state owing\nto the strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, were studied using inelastic\nneutron scattering. Although the spin-wave dispersion can be qualitatively\nunderstood in terms of linear spin-wave theory (LSWT), the excitation energies\nare renormalized by a factor of approximately 0.6 from those calculated by\nLSWT, almost irrespective of the momentum transfer. This inadequacy of LSWT,\nwhich is attributed to quantum fluctuations, provides evidence of negative\nquantum renormalization in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ kagome lattice\nantiferromagnet.\n", "  We review the BCS-BEC crossover in relativistic Fermi systems, including the\nQCD matter at finite density. In the first part we study the BCS-BEC crossover\nin a relativistic four-fermion interaction model and show how the relativistic\neffect affects the BCS-BEC crossover. In the second part, we investigate both\ntwo-color QCD at finite baryon density and pion superfluid at finite isospin\ndensity, by using an effective Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We will show how the\nmodel describes the weakly interacting diquark and pion condensates at low\ndensity and the BEC-BCS crossover at high density.\n", "  It is usually assumed that a quantum computation is performed by applying\ngates in a specific order. One can relax this assumption by allowing a control\nquantum system to switch the order in which the gates are applied. This\nprovides a more general kind of quantum computing, that allows transformations\non blackbox quantum gates that are impossible in a circuit with fixed order.\nHere we show that this model of quantum computing is physically realizable, by\nproposing an interferometric setup that can implement such a quantum control of\nthe order between the gates. We show that this new resource provides a\nreduction in computational complexity: we propose a problem that can be solved\nusing $O(n)$ blackbox queries, whereas the best known quantum algorithm with\nfixed order between the gates requires $O(n^2)$ queries. Furthermore, we\nconjecture that solving this problem in a classical computer takes exponential\ntime, which may be of independent interest.\n", "  We report the results of a survey of the region within 40 arcmin of NGC 891,\na nearby nearly perfectly edge-on spiral galaxy. Candidate \"non-stars\" with\ndiameters greater than 15 arcsec were selected from the GSC 2.3.2 catalog and\ncross-comparison of observations in several bands using archived \\galex, DSS2,\nWISE, and 2MASS images identified contaminating stars, artifacts and background\ngalaxies, all of which were excluded. The resulting 71 galaxies, many of which\nwere previously uncataloged, comprise a size limited survey of the region. A\nmajority of the galaxies are in the background of NGC 891 and are for the most\npart members of the Abell 347 cluster at a distance of about 75 \\Mpc. The new\nfinds approximately double the known membership of Abell 347, previously\nthought to be relatively sparse. We identify a total of 7 dwarf galaxies, most\nof which are new discoveries. The newly discovered dwarf galaxies are dim and\ngas-poor and may be associated with the previously observed arcs of RGB halo\nstars in the halo and the prominent HI filament and the lopsided features in\nthe disk of NGC 891. Several of the dwarfs show signs of disruption, consistent\nwith being remnants of an ancient collision.\n", "  We provide here a roadmap for modeling silicon nano-devices with one or two\ngroup V donors (D). We discuss systems containing one or two electrons, that\nis, D^0, D^-, D_2^+ and D_2^0 centers. The impact of different levels of\napproximation is discussed. The most accurate instances -- for which we provide\nquantitative results -- are within multivalley effective mass including the\ncentral cell correction and a configuration interaction account of the\nelectron-electron correlations. We also derive insightful, yet less accurate,\nanalytical approximations and discuss their validity and limitations -- in\nparticular, for a donor pair, we discuss the single orbital LCAO method, the\nHuckel approximation and the Hubbard model. Finally we discuss the connection\nbetween these results and recent experiments on few dopant devices.\n", "  A method is presented to precisely reconstruct charge spectra with pixel\ndetectors using binary hit information of individual pixels. The method is\nindependent of the charge information provided by the readout circuitry and has\na resolution mainly limited by the electronic noise. It relies on the ability\nto change the detection threshold in small steps while counting hits from a\nparticle source. The errors are addressed and the performance of the method is\nshown based on measurements with the ATLAS pixel chip FE-I4 bump bonded to a\n230 {\\mu}m 3D-silicon sensor. Charge spectra from radioactive sources and from\nelectron beams are presented serving as examples. It is demonstrated that a\ncharge resolution ({\\sigma}<200 e) close to the electronic noise of the ATLAS\nFE-I4 pixel chip can be achieved.\n", "  The ADM mass, viewed as a functional on the space of asymptotically flat\nRiemannian metrics of nonnegative scalar curvature, fails to be continuous for\nmany natural topologies. In this paper we prove that lower semicontinuity holds\nin natural settings: first, for pointed Cheeger--Gromov convergence (without\nany symmetry assumptions) for $n=3$, and second, assuming rotational symmetry,\nfor weak convergence of the associated canonical embeddings into Euclidean\nspace, for $n \\geq 3$. We also apply recent results of LeFloch and Sormani to\ndeal with the rotationally symmetric case, with respect to a pointed type of\nintrinsic flat convergence. We provide several examples, one of which\ndemonstrates that the positive mass theorem is implied by a statement of the\nlower semicontinuity of the ADM mass.\n", "  We extend the concept of graph isomorphisms to multilayer networks with any\nnumber of \"aspects\" (i.e., types of layering). In developing this\ngeneralization, we identify multiple types of isomorphisms. For example, in\nmultilayer networks with a single aspect, permuting vertex labels, layer\nlabels, and both vertex labels and layer labels each yield different\nisomorphism relations between multilayer networks. Multilayer network\nisomorphisms lead naturally to defining isomorphisms in any of the numerous\ntypes of networks that can be represented as a multilayer network, and we\nthereby obtain isomorphisms for multiplex networks, temporal networks, networks\nwith both of these features, and more. We reduce each of the multilayer network\nisomorphism problems to a graph isomorphism problem, where the size of the\ngraph isomorphism problem grows linearly with the size of the multilayer\nnetwork isomorphism problem. One can thus use software that has been developed\nto solve graph isomorphism problems as a practical means for solving multilayer\nnetwork isomorphism problems. Our theory lays a foundation for extending many\nnetwork analysis methods --- including motifs, graphlets, structural roles, and\nnetwork alignment --- to any multilayer network.\n", "  We discuss a possibility that the so-called reactor antineutrino anomaly can\nbe, at least in part, explained by applying a quantum field-theoretical\napproach to neutrino oscillations, which in particular predicts a small\ndeviation from the classical inverse-square law at short but macroscopic\ndistances between the neutrino source and detector. An extensive statistical\nanalysis of the reactor data is performed to examine this speculation.\n", "  The deconfinement phase transition with external magnetic field is\ninvestigated in the Friedberg-Lee model. In the frame of functional\nrenormalization group, we extend the often used potential expansion method for\ncontinuous phase transitions to the first-order phase transition in the model.\nBy solving the flow equations we find that, the magnetic field displays a\ncatalysis effect and it becomes more difficult to break through the confinement\nin hot and dense medium.\n", "  This thesis contains contributions to the theory of quantum computation.\n  We first define a new method to efficiently approximate special unitary\noperators. Specifically, given a special unitary U and a precision {\\epsilon} >\n0, we show how to efficiently find a sequence of Clifford+V or Clifford+T\noperators whose product approximates U up to {\\epsilon} in the operator norm.\nIn the general case, the length of the approximating sequence is asymptotically\noptimal. If the unitary to approximate is diagonal then our method is optimal:\nit yields the shortest sequence approximating U up to {\\epsilon}.\n  Next, we introduce a mathematical formalization of a fragment of the Quipper\nquantum programming language. We define a typed lambda calculus called\nProto-Quipper which formalizes a restricted but expressive fragment of Quipper.\nThe type system of Proto-Quipper is based on intuitionistic linear logic and\nprohibits the duplication of quantum data, in accordance with the no-cloning\nproperty of quantum computation. We prove that Proto-Quipper is type-safe in\nthe sense that it enjoys the subject reduction and progress properties.\n", "  We assess the ODE/IM correspondence for the quantum $\\mathfrak{g}$-KdV model,\nfor a non-simply laced Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. This is done by studying a\nmeromorphic connection with values in the Langlands dual algebra of the affine\nLie algebra ${\\mathfrak{g}}^{(1)}$, and constructing the relevant $\\Psi$-system\namong subdominant solutions. We then use the $\\Psi$-system to prove that the\ngeneralized spectral determinants satisfy the Bethe Ansatz equations of the\nquantum $\\mathfrak{g}$-KdV model. We also consider generalized Airy functions\nfor twisted Kac--Moody algebras and we construct new explicit solutions to the\nBethe Ansatz equations. The paper is a continuation of our previous work on the\nODE/IM correspondence for simply-laced Lie algebras.\n", "  Shape coexistence has been a subject of great interest in nuclear physics for\nmany decades. In the context of the nuclear shell model, intruder excitations\nmay give rise to remarkably low-lying excited $0^+$ states associated with\ndifferent intrinsic shapes. In heavy open-shell nuclei, the dimension of the\nshell-model configuration space that includes such intruder excitations becomes\nexceedingly large, thus requiring a drastic truncation scheme. Such a framework\nhas been provided by the interacting boson model (IBM). In this article we\naddress the phenomenon of shape coexistence and its relevant spectroscopy from\nthe point of view of the IBM. A special focus is placed on the method developed\nrecently which makes use of the link between the IBM and the self-consistent\nmean-field approach based on the nuclear energy density functional. The method\nis extended to deal with various intruder configurations associated with\ndifferent equilibrium shapes. We assess the predictive power of the method and\nsuggest possible improvements and extensions, by considering illustrative\nexamples in the neutron-deficient Pb region, where shape coexistence has been\nexperimentally studied.\n", "  Recent exact $n\\to\\infty$ results for critical Casimir forces of the $O(n)$\n$\\phi^4$ model on a three-dimensional strip bounded by two planar free surfaces\nat a distance $L$ are surveyed. This model has long-range order below the bulk\ncritical temperature $T_c$ if $L=\\infty$, but remains disordered for all $T>0$\nwhen $L<\\infty$. A proper analysis of its scaling behavior near $T_c$ is quite\nchallenging: Besides with bulk, boundary, and finite-size critical behaviors,\none must deal with a nontrivial dimensional crossover. The model can be solved\nexactly in the limit $n\\to\\infty$ in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenenergies\nof a selfconsistent Schr\\\"odinger equation involving a potential $v(z)$ with\nthe near-boundary singular behavior $v(z\\to 0+)\\approx\n-1/(4z^2)+4m/(\\pi^{2}z)$, where $m=1/\\xi_+(|t|)$ is the inverse bulk\ncorrelation length and $t\\sim (T-T_c)/T_c$, and a corresponding singularity at\nthe second boundary plane. The potential $v(z)$, the excess free energy, and\nthe Casimir force have been determined numerically with high precision. Exact\nanalytical results for a variety of properties such as series expansion\ncoefficients of $v(z)$, the scattering data of $v(z)$ in the semi-infinite case\n$L=\\infty$ for all $m\\gtreqless 0$, and the low-temperature asymptotic behavior\nof the residual free energy and the Casimir force can be obtained by a\ncombination of boundary-operator and short-distance expansions, proper\nextensions of inverse scattering theory, new trace formulae, and semiclassical\nexpansions.\n", "  We consider a two-component ideal Fermi gas in an isotropic harmonic\npotential. Some eigenstates have a wavefunction that vanishes when two\ndistinguishable fermions are at the same location, and would be unaffected by\ns-wave contact interactions between the two components. We determine the other,\ninteraction-sensitive eigenstates, using a Faddeev ansatz. This problem is\nnontrivial, due to degeneracies and to the existence of unphysical Faddeev\nsolutions. As an application we present a new conjecture for the fourth-order\ncluster or virial coefficient of the unitary Fermi gas, in good agreement with\nthe numerical results of Blume and coworkers.\n", "  We study asymptotically and numerically the fundamental gaps (i.e. the\ndifference between the first excited state and the ground state) in energy and\nchemical potential of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) -- nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation with cubic nonlinearity -- with repulsive interaction\nunder different trapping potentials including box potential and harmonic\npotential. Based on our asymptotic and numerical results, we formulate a gap\nconjecture on the fundamental gaps in energy and chemical potential of the GPE\non bounded domains with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, and in\nthe whole space with a convex trapping potential growing at least quadratically\nin the far field. We then extend these results to the GPE on bounded domains\nwith either the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition or periodic boundary\ncondition.\n", "  Dipole-dipole interactions which govern phenomena like cooperative Lamb\nshifts, superradiant decay rates, Van der Waals forces, as well as resonance\nenergy transfer rates are conventionally limited to the Coulombic near-field.\nHere, we reveal a class of real-photon and virtual-photon long-range quantum\nelectrodynamic (QED) interactions that have a singularity in media with\nhyperbolic dispersion. The singularity in the dipole-dipole coupling, referred\nto as a Super-Coulombic interaction, is a result of an effective interaction\ndistance that goes to zero in the ideal limit irrespective of the physical\ndistance. We investigate the entire landscape of atom-atom interactions in\nhyperbolic media and propose practical implementations with phonon-polaritonic\nhexagonal boron nitride in the infrared spectral range and plasmonic\nsuper-lattice structures in the visible range. Our work paves the way for the\ncontrol of cold atoms in hyperbolic media and the study of many-body atomic\nstates where optical phonons mediate quantum interactions.\n", "  We discuss the possible usage of the compressive sampling for the early\ndetection of rogue waves. One of the promising techniques for the early\ndetection of the oceanic rogue waves is to measure the triangular Fourier\nspectra which begin to appear at the early stages of their development. For the\nearly detection of the rogue waves it is possible to treat such a spectrum as a\nsparse signal since we would mainly be interested in the high amplitude\ntriangular region located at the central wavenumber. Therefore compressive\nsampling can be a very efficient tool for the rogue wave early warning systems.\nCompressed measurements can be acquired by remote sensing techniques such as\ncoherent SAR which measure the ocean surface envelope or by insitu techniques\nsuch as spectra measuring tools mounted on a ship hull or bottom mounted\npressure gauges. By employing a numerical approach we show that triangular\nFourier spectra can be sensed by compressive measurements at the early stages\nof the development of rogue waves such as those in the form of Peregrine and\nAkhmediev-Peregrine solitons. Our results may lead to development of the early\nwarning hardware systems which use the compressive sampling thus the memory\nrequirements for those systems can be greatly reduced.\n", "  Despite the fact that a rigid $\\Lambda$-term is a fundamental building block\nof the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model, we show that a large class of\ncosmological scenarios with dynamical vacuum energy density $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$\nand/or gravitational coupling $G$, together with a possible non-conservation of\nmatter, are capable of seriously challenging the traditional phenomenological\nsuccess of the $\\Lambda$CDM. In this paper, we discuss these \"running vacuum\nmodels\" (RVM's), in which $\\rho_{\\Lambda}=\\rho_{\\Lambda}(H)$ consists of a\nnonvanishing constant term and a series of powers of the Hubble rate. Such\ngeneric structure is potentially linked to the quantum field theoretical\ndescription of the expanding Universe. By performing an overall fit to the\ncosmological observables $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+BBN+CMB$ (in which the WMAP9,\nPlanck 2013 and Planck 2015 data are taken into account), we find that the\nclass of RVM's appears significantly more favored than the $\\Lambda$CDM, namely\nat an unprecedented level of $\\gtrsim4.2\\sigma$. Furthermore, the Akaike and\nBayesian information criteria confirm that the dynamical RVM's are strongly\npreferred as compared to the conventional rigid $\\Lambda$-picture of the cosmic\nevolution.\n", "  By means of first principles calculations, we have systematically\ninvestigated how the magnetodynamic properties Gilbert damping, magnetization\nand exchange stiffness are affected when permalloy (Py)\n(Fe$_{0.19}$Ni$_{0.81}$) is doped with 4d or 5d transition metal impurities. We\nfind that the trends in the Gilbert damping can be understood from relatively\nfew basic parameters such as the density of states at the Fermi level, the\nspin-orbit coupling and the impurity concentration. % The temperature\ndependence of the Gilbert damping is found to be very weak which we relate to\nthe lack of intraband transitions in alloys. % Doping with $4d$ elements has no\nmajor impact on the studied Gilbert damping, apart from diluting the host.\nHowever, the $5d$ elements have a profound effect on the damping and allows it\nto be tuned over a large interval while maintaining the magnetization and\nexchange stiffness. % As regards spin stiffness, doping with early transition\nmetals results in considerable softening, whereas late transition metals have a\nminor impact. % Our result agree well with earlier calculations where\navailable. In comparison to experiments, the computed Gilbert damping appears\nslightly underestimated while the spin stiffness show good general agreement.\n", "  The layered honeycomb magnet $\\alpha$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ has been theoretically\nproposed as a candidate to display novel magnetic behaviour associated with\nKitaev interactions between spin-orbit entangled $j_{\\rm eff}=1/2$ magnetic\nmoments on a honeycomb lattice. Here we report single crystal magnetic resonant\nx-ray diffraction combined with powder magnetic neutron diffraction to reveal\nan incommensurate magnetic order in the honeycomb layers with Ir magnetic\nmoments counter-rotating on nearest-neighbour sites. This type of magnetic\nstructure has not been reported experimentally before in honeycomb magnets and\ncannot be explained by a spin Hamiltonian with dominant isotropic (Heisenberg)\ncouplings. The magnetic structure shares many key features with the magnetic\norder in the structural polytypes $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$,\nunderstood theoretically to be stabilized by dominant Kitaev interactions\nbetween Ir moments located on the vertices of three-dimensional hyperhoneycomb\nand stripyhoneycomb lattices, respectively. Based on this analogy and a\ntheoretical soft-spin analysis of magnetic ground states for candidate spin\nHamiltonians, we propose that Kitaev interactions also dominate in\n$\\alpha$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, indicative of universal Kitaev physics across all three\nmembers of the harmonic honeycomb family of Li$_2$IrO$_3$ polytypes.\n", "  Bulk rhombohedral Bismuth (Bi) at ambient pressure is a semimetal and it\nremains in the normal state down to 10~mK. The superconductivity (SC) in bulk\nBi is thought to be very unlikely due to extremely low carrier density. The\nquestion of SC in Bi has remained unsolved both theoretically and\nexperimentally. Here, we report first ever observation of bulk SC in highly\npure Bi single crystals (99.9999\\%) below 0.53~mK under ambient pressure with\nan estimated critical magnetic field of 5.2~$\\mu$T at 0~K. The conventional\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory cannot explain the observed SC in Bi,\nsince the adiabatic approximation of the BCS theory, $\\omega_D/E_F<< 1$, does\nnot hold true for Bi. Bi has a multi-valley type electronic band structure and\nSC in Bi could be brought about by the inter-valley electron-phonon coupling.\nSuch a scenario calls for new theoretical ideas to understand SC in such low\ncarrier systems with unusual band structure in the non-adiabatic limit,\n$\\omega_D/E_F \\gtrsim 1$. The observation of SC in Bi makes it the lowest\ncarrier density superconductor surpassing the record held by doped SrTiO$_3$\nfor nearly 50 years.\n", "  Memristors are resistive elements retaining information of their past\ndynamics. They have garnered substantial interest due to their potential for\nrepresenting a paradigm change in electronics, information processing and\nunconventional computing. Given the advent of quantum technologies, a design\nfor a quantum memristor with superconducting circuits may be envisaged. Along\nthese lines, we introduce such a quantum device whose memristive behavior\narises from quasiparticle-induced tunneling when supercurrents are cancelled.\nFor realistic parameters, we find that the relevant hysteretic behavior may be\nobserved using current state-of-the-art measurements of the phase-driven\ntunneling current. Finally, we develop suitable methods to quantify memory\nretention in the system.\n", "  In two-dimensional Dirac semimetals, Cooper pairing instability occurs only\nwhen the attractive interaction strength $|u|$ is larger than some critical\nvalue $|u_{c}|$ because the density of states vanishes at Dirac points.\nDisorders enhance the low-energy density of states but meanwhile shorten the\nlifetime of fermions, which tend to promote and suppress superconductivity,\nrespectively. To determine which of the two competing effects wins, we study\nthe interplay of Cooper pairing interaction and disorder scattering by means of\nrenormalization group method. We consider three types of disorders, including\nrandom mass, random gauge potential, and random chemical potential, and show\nthat the first two suppress superconductivity. In particular, the critical BCS\ncoupling $|u_{c}|$ is increased to certain larger value if the system contains\nonly random mass or random gauge potential, which makes the onset of\nsuperconductivity more difficult. In the case of random chemical potential, the\neffective disorder parameter flows to the strong coupling regime, where the\nperturbation expansion breaks down and cannot provide a clear answer concerning\nthe fate of superconductivity. When different types of disorder coexist in one\nsystem, their strength parameters all flow to strong couplings. In the strong\ncoupling regime, the perturbative renormalization group method becomes invalid,\nand one needs to employ other methods to treat the disorder effects. We perform\na simple gap equation analysis of the impact of random chemical potential on\nsuperconductivity by using the Abrikosov-Gorkov diagrammatic approach, and also\nbriefly discuss the possible generalization of this approach.\n", "  Despite impressive phenomenological successes, cosmological models are\nincomplete without an understanding of what happened at the big bang\nsingularity. Maxwell electrodynamics, considered as a source of the classical\nEinstein field equations, leads to the singular isotropic Friedmann solutions.\nIn the context of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime, we show that\nsingular behavior does not occur for a class of nonlinear generalizations of\nthe electromagnetic theory for strong fields. A new mathematical model is\nproposed for which the analytical nonsingular extension of FRW solutions is\nobtained by using the nonlinear magnetic monopole fields.\n", "  Here we present neutrino oscillation in the frame-work of quantum walks.\nStarting from a one spatial dimensional discrete-time quantum walk we present a\nscheme of evolutions that will simulate neutrino oscillation. The set of\nquantum walk parameters which is required to reproduce the oscillation\nprobability profile obtained in both, long range and short range neutrino\nexperiment is explicitly presented. Our scheme to simulate three-generation\nneutrino oscillation from quantum walk evolution operators can be physically\nrealized in any low energy experimental set-up with access to control a single\nsix-level system, a multiparticle three-qubit or a qubit-qutrit system. We also\npresent the entanglement between spins and position space, during neutrino\npropagation that will quantify the wave function delocalization around\ninstantaneous average position of the neutrino. This work will contribute\ntowards understanding neutrino oscillation in the framework of the quantum\ninformation perspective.\n", "  An uncertainty relation is introduced for a symmetric arrangement of three\nmutually unbiased bases in continuous variable phase space, and then used to\nderive a bipartite entanglement criterion based on the variance of global\noperators composed of these three phase space variables. We test this criterion\nusing spatial variables of photon pairs, and show that the entangled photons\nare correlated in three pairs of bases.\n", "  In a previous paper, we proposed a heterotic dark energy model, called\n$\\Lambda$HDE, in which dark energy is composed of two components: cosmological\nconstant (CC) and holographic dark energy (HDE). The aim of this work is to\ngive a more comprehensive and systematic investigation on the cosmological\nimplications of the $\\Lambda$HDE model. Firstly, we make use of the current\nobservations to constrain the $\\Lambda$HDE model, and compare its cosmology-fit\nresults with the results of the $\\Lambda$CDM and the HDE model. Then, by\ncombining a qualitative theoretical analysis with a quantitative numerical\nstudy, we discuss the impact of considering curvature on the cosmic evolutions\nof fractional HDE density $\\Omega_{hde}$ and fractional CC density\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$, as well as on the ultimate cosmic fate. Finally, we explore\nthe effects of adopting different types of observational data. We find that:\n(1) the current observational data cannot distinguish the $\\Lambda$HDE model\nfrom the $\\Lambda$CDM and the HDE model; this indicates that DE may contain\nmultiple components. (2) the asymptotic solution of $\\Omega_{hde}$ and the\ncorresponding cosmic fate in a flat universe can be extended to the case of a\nnon-flat universe; moreover, compared with the case of a flat universe,\nconsidering curvature will make HDE closer to a phantom dark energy. (3)\ncompared with JLA dataset, SNLS3 data more favor a phantom type HDE; in\ncontrast, using other types of observational data have no significant impact on\nthe cosmic evolutions of the $\\Lambda$HDE model.\n", "  Two photons in free space pass each other undisturbed. This is ideal for the\nfaithful transmission of information, but prohibits an interaction between the\nphotons as required for a plethora of applications in optical quantum\ninformation processing. The long-standing challenge here is to realise a\ndeterministic photon-photon gate. This requires an interaction so strong that\nthe two photons can shift each others phase by pi. For polarisation qubits,\nthis amounts to the conditional flipping of one photon's polarisation to an\northogonal state. So far, only probabilistic gates based on linear optics and\nphoton detectors could be realised, as \"no known or foreseen material has an\noptical nonlinearity strong enough to implement this conditional phase\nshift...\" [Science 318, 1567]. Meanwhile, tremendous progress in the\ndevelopment of quantum-nonlinear systems has opened up new possibilities for\nsingle-photon experiments. Platforms range from Rydberg blockade in atomic\nensembles to single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics. Applications like\nsingle-photon switches and transistors, two-photon gateways, nondestructive\nphoton detectors, photon routers and nonlinear phase shifters have been\ndemonstrated, but none of them with the ultimate information carriers, optical\nqubits. Here we employ the strong light-matter coupling provided by a single\natom in a high-finesse optical resonator to realise the Duan-Kimble protocol of\na universal controlled phase flip (CPF, pi phase shift) photon-photon quantum\ngate. We achieve an average gate fidelity of F=(76.2+/-3.6)% and specifically\ndemonstrate the capability of conditional polarisation flipping as well as\nentanglement generation between independent input photons. Our gate could\nreadily perform most of the hitherto existing two-photon operations. It also\ndiscloses avenues towards new quantum information processing applications where\nphotons are essential.\n", "  Analytical models of chemical evolution, including inflow and outflow of gas,\nare important tools to study how the metal content in galaxies evolves as a\nfunction of time. In this work, we present new analytical solutions for the\nevolution of the gas mass, total mass and metallicity of a galactic system,\nwhen a decaying exponential infall rate of gas and galactic winds are assumed.\nWe apply our model to characterize a sample of local star-forming and passive\ngalaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, with the aim of reproducing\ntheir observed mass-metallicity relation; in this way, we can derive how the\ntwo populations of star-forming and passive galaxies differ in their particular\ndistribution of ages, formation time scales, infall masses and mass loading\nfactors. We find that the local passive galaxies are on average older and\nassembled on shorter typical time-scales than the local star-forming ones; on\nthe other hand, the larger mass star-forming galaxies show generally older ages\nand longer typical formation time-scales compared with the smaller mass\nstar-forming galaxies. Finally, we conclude that the local star-forming\ngalaxies experience stronger galactic winds than the passive galaxy population.\nWe explore the effect of assuming different initial mass functions in our\nmodel, showing that to reproduce the observed mass-metallicity relation\nstronger winds are requested if the initial mass function is top-heavy.\nFinally, our analytical models predict the assumed sample of local galaxies to\nlie on a tight surface in the 3D space defined by stellar metallicity, star\nformation rate and stellar mass, thus mimicking the well-known \"fundamental\nrelation\".\n", "  In a recent paper (J.R. Morris, Quant. Stud. Math. Found. 2 (2015) 359), an\ninhomogeneous compactification of the extra dimension of a five-dimensional\nKaluza-Klein metric has been shown to generate a position-dependent mass (PDM)\nin the corresponding four-dimensional system. As an application of this\ndimensional reduction mechanism, a specific static dilatonic scalar field has\nbeen connected with a PDM Lagrangian describing a well-known nonlinear PDM\noscillator. Here we present more instances of this construction that lead to\nPDM systems with radial symmetry, and the properties of their corresponding\ninhomogeneous extra dimensions are compared with the ones in the nonlinear\noscillator model. Moreover, it is also shown how the compactification\nintroduced in this type of models can alternatively be interpreted as a novel\nmechanism for the dynamical generation of curvature.\n", "  We show that engineering of tunnel barriers forming at the interfaces of a\none-dimensional spin valve provides a viable path to a strong gate-voltage\ntunability of the magnetoresistance effect. In particular, we investigate\ntheoretically a carbon nanotube (CNT) spin valve in terms of the influence of\nthe CNT-contact interface on the performance of the device. The focus is on the\nstrength and the spin selectivity of the tunnel barriers that are modelled as\nDirac-delta potentials. The scattering matrix approach is used to derive the\ntransmission coefficient that yields the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR). We\nfind a strong non-trivial gate-voltage response of the TMR in the absence of\nspin-orbit coupling when the energy of the incident electrons matches the\npotential energy of the barrier. Analytic expressions for the TMR in various\nlimiting cases are derived. These are used to explain previous experimental\nresults, but also to predict parameters for device optimization with respect to\nsize and tunability of the TMR effect in the ballistic transport regime.\n", "  In this work we give specific examples of competition models, with six and\neight species, whose three-dimensional dynamics naturally leads to the\nformation of string networks with junctions, associated with regions that have\na high concentration of enemy species. We study the two- and three-dimensional\nevolution of such networks, both using stochastic network and mean field theory\nsimulations. If the predation, reproduction and mobility probabilities do not\nvary in space and time, we find that the networks attain scaling regimes with a\ncharacteristic length roughly proportional to $t^{1/2}$, where $t$ is the\nphysical time, thus showing that the presence of junctions, on its own, does\nnot have a significant impact on their scaling properties.\n", "  Many naturally occurring networks have a power-law degree distribution as\nwell as a non-zero degree correlation. Despite this, most studies analyzing the\nrobustness to random node-deletion and vulnerability to targeted node-deletion\nhave concentrated only on power-law degree distribution and ignored degree\ncorrelation. This study looks specifically at the effect degree-correlation has\non robustness and vulnerability in scale-free networks. Our results confirm\nNewman's finding that positive degree-correlation increases robustness and\ndecreases vulnerability. However, we found that networks with positive\ndegree-correlation are more vulnerable to random node-deletion than to targeted\ndeletion methods that utilize knowledge of initial node-degree only. Targeted\ndeletion sufficiently alters the topology of the network to render this method\nless effective than uniform random methods unless changes in topology are\naccounted for. This result indicates the importance of degree correlation in\ncertain network applications.\n", "  We consider a population dynamics model coupling cell growth to a diffusion\nin the space of metabolic phenotypes as it can be obtained from realistic\nconstraints-based modelling. In the asymptotic regime of slow diffusion, that\ncoincides with the relevant experimental range, the resulting non-linear\nFokker-Planck equation is solved for the steady state in the WKB approximation\nthat maps it into the ground state of a quantum particle in an Airy potential\nplus a centrifugal term. We retrieve scaling laws for growth rate fluctuations\nand time response with respect to the distance from the maximum growth rate\nsuggesting that suboptimal populations can have a faster response to\nperturbations.\n", "  The spinel FeSc$_2$S$_4$ has been proposed to realize a near-critical\nspin-orbital singlet (SOS) state, where entangled spin and orbital moments\nfluctuate in a global singlet state on the verge of spin and orbital order.\nHere we report powder inelastic neutron scattering measurements that observe\nthe full bandwidth of magnetic excitations and we find that spin-orbital\ntriplon excitations of an SOS state can capture well key aspects of the\nspectrum in both zero and applied magnetic fields up to 8.5 T. The observed\nshift of low-energy spectral weight to higher energies upon increasing applied\nfield is naturally explained by the entangled spin-orbital character of the\nmagnetic states, a behavior that is in strong contrast to spin-only singlet\nground state systems, where the spin gap decreases upon increasing applied\nfield.\n", "  We investigate one-dimensional harmonically trapped two-component systems for\nrepulsive interaction strengths ranging from the non-interacting to the\nstrongly interacting regime for Fermi-Fermi mixtures. A new and powerful\nmapping between the interaction strength parameters from a continuous\nHamiltonian and a discrete lattice Hamiltonian is derived. As an example, we\nshow that this mapping does not depend neither on the state of the system nor\non the number of particles. Energies, density profiles and correlation\nfunctions are obtained both numerically (DMRG and Exact diagonalization) and\nanalytically. Since DMRG results do not converge as the interaction strength is\nincreased, analytical solutions are used as a benchmark to identify the point\nwhere these calculations become unstable. We use the proposed mapping to set a\nquantitative limit on the interaction parameter of a discrete lattice\nHamiltonian above which DMRG gives unrealistic results.\n", "  Different models based on the extended $SU(3)_{C}\\times SU(3)_{L}\\times\nU(1)_{X}$ (331) gauge group have been proposed over the past four decades. Yet,\ndespite being an active research topic, the status of lepton number in 331\nmodels has not been fully addressed in the literature, and furthermore many of\nthe original proposals can not explain the observed neutrino masses. In this\npaper we review the basic features of various 331 models, focusing on potential\nsources of lepton number violation. We then describe different modifications\nwhich can be made to the original models in order to accommodate neutrino (and\ncharged lepton) masses.\n", "  Classical and quantum physics provide fundamentally different predictions\nabout experiments with separate observers that do not communicate, a phenomenon\nknown as quantum nonlocality. This insight is a key element of our present\nunderstanding of quantum physics, and also enables a number of information\nprocessing protocols with security beyond what is classically attainable.\nRelaxing the pivotal assumption of no communication leads to new insights into\nthe nature quantum correlations, and may enable new applications where security\ncan be established under less strict assumptions. Here, we study such\nrelaxations where different forms of communication are allowed. We consider\ncommunication of inputs, outputs, and of a message between the parties. Using\nseveral measures, we study how much communication is required for classical\nmodels to reproduce quantum or general no-signalling correlations, as well as\nhow quantum models can be augmented with classical communication to reproduce\nno-signalling correlations.\n", "  We describe the connection between inversion symmetry breaking and\ncriticality in free fermionic lattice models. It is shown that for\ntranslation-invariant spinless fermions, the breaking of this symmetry in the\nground state implies criticality, i.e., the existence of long-range\ncorrelations and the vanishing of the spectral gap; while for models with spin,\nonly the asymmetry of the spin-averaged covariance matrix implies a similar\nconclusion. Our results are proved by introducing invariants under global\ntranslation-invariant free fermion quenches. Using this result, we identify a\nset of models where the generalized Hartree-Fock approximation must break down.\n", "  The viability of the variable generalised Chaplygin gas (VGCG) model is\nanalysed from the standpoint of its thermodynamical stability criteria with the\nhelp of an equation of state, $P = - \\frac{B}{\\rho^{\\alpha}}$, where $B =\nB_{0}V^{-\\frac{n}{3}}$. Here $B_{0}$ is assumed to be a positive universal\nconstant, $n$ is a constant parameter and $V$ is the volume of the cosmic\nfluid. We get the interesting result that if the well-known stability\nconditions of a fluid is adhered to, the values of $n$ are constrained to be\nnegative definite to make $ \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_{S} <0$\n\\& $ \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_{T} <0$ throughout the\nevolution. Moreover the positivity of thermal capacity at constant volume\n$c_{V}$ as also the validity of the third law of thermodynamics are ensured in\nthis case. For the particular case $n = 0$ the effective equation of state\nreduces to $\\Lambda$CDM model in the late stage of the universe while for $n\n<0$ it mimics a phantom-like cosmology which is in broad agreement with the\npresent SNe Ia constraints like VGCG model. The thermal equation of state is\ndiscussed and the EoS parameter is found to be an explicit function of\ntemperature only. Further for large volume the thermal equation of state\nparameter is identical with the caloric equation of state parameter when $ T\n\\rightarrow 0$. It may also be mentioned that like Santos et al our model does\nnot admit of any critical points. We also observe that although the earlier\nmodel of Lu explains many of the current observational findings of different\nprobes it fails to explain the crucial tests of thermodynamical stability.\n", "  The ATLAS Collaboration has measured for the first time the fourth cumulant\nof quadrangular flow, $v_4\\{4\\}^4$. Unlike the fourth cumulants of elliptic and\ntriangular flows, it presents a change of sign above 30\\% centrality. We show\nthat this change of sign is predicted by event-by-event hydrodynamics. We argue\nthat it results from the combined effects of a nonlinear hydrodynamic response,\nwhich couples quadrangular flow to elliptic flow, and elliptic flow\nfluctuations.\n", "  We extend our previous study of surface tension of ionic solutions and apply\nit to the case of acids (and salts) with strong ion-surface interactions. These\nion-surface interactions yield a non-linear boundary condition with an\neffective surface charge due to adsorption of ions from the bulk onto the\ninterface. The calculation is done using the loop-expansion technique, where\nthe zero-loop (mean field) corresponds of the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation. The surface tension is obtained analytically to one-loop order, where\nthe mean-field contribution is a modification of the Poisson-Boltzmann surface\ntension, and the one-loop contribution gives a generalization of the\nOnsager-Samaras result. Our theory fits well a wide range of different acids\nand salts, and is in accord with the reverse Hofmeister series for acids.\n", "  The Hamilton operator of an open quantum system is non-Hermitian. Its\neigenvalues are, generally, complex and provide not only the energies but also\nthe lifetimes of the states of the system. The states may couple via the common\nenvironment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded. This\ncauses an {\\it external mixing} (EM) of the states. Mathematically, EM is\nrelated to the existence of singular (the so-called exceptional) points (EPs).\nThe eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian operator are biorthogonal, in contrast to\nthe orthogonal eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator. A quantitative measure\nfor the ratio between biorthogonality and orthogonality is the phase rigidity\nof the wavefunctions. At and near an EP, the phase rigidity takes its minimum\nvalue. The lifetimes of two nearby eigenstates of a quantum system bifurcate\nunder the influence of an EP. At the parameter value of maximum width\nbifurcation, the phase rigidity approaches the value one, meaning that the two\neigenfunctions become orthogonal. However, the eigenfunctions are externally\nmixed at this parameter value. The S-matrix and therewith the cross section do\ncontain, in the one-channel case, almost no information on the EM of the\nstates. The situation is completely different in the case with two (or more)\nchannels where the resonance structure is strongly influenced by the EM of the\nstates and interesting features of non-Hermitian quantum physics are revealed.\nWe provide numerical results for two and three nearby eigenstates of a\nnon-Hermitian Hamilton operator which are embedded in one common continuum and\ninfluenced by two adjoining EPs. The results are discussed. They are of\ninterest for an experimental test of the non-Hermitian quantum physics as well\nas for applications.\n", "  We study the density-density correlation function in a large-N scheme of the\nt-t'-J-V model. When the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction V is zero, our\nmodel exhibits phase separation in a wide doping region and we obtain large\nspectral weight near momentum q=(0,0) at low energy, which originates from the\nproximity to phase separation. These features are much stronger for electron\ndoping than for hole doping. However, once phase separation is suppressed by\nincluding a finite V, the low-energy spectral weight around q=(0,0) is\nsubstantially suppressed. Instead a sharp zero-sound mode is stabilized above\nthe particle-hole continuum. We discuss that the presence of a moderate value\nof V, which is frequently neglected in the t-J model, is important to\nunderstand low-energy charge excitations especially close to q=(0,0) for\nelectron doping. This insight should be taken into account in a future study of\nx-ray scattering measurements.\n", "  The origin of quantum fluctuations responsible for the spin liquid state in\nTb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ has remained a long standing problem. By synchrotron-based\nterahertz measurements, we show evidence of strong coupling between the\nmagnetic and lattice degrees of freedom that provides a path to the quantum\nmelting process. As revealed by hybrid crystal electric field-phonon\nexcitations that appear at 0.67 THz below 200 K, and around 0.42 THz below 50\nK, the double vibronic process is unique for Tb$^{3+}$ in the titanate family\ndue to adequate energy matching and strong quadrupolar moments. The results\nsuggest that lattice motion can indeed be the driving force behind spin flips\nwithin the hybridized ground and first excited states, promoting quantum terms\nin the effective Hamiltonian that describes Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.\n", "  We study the spherical collapse model (SCM) in the framework of spatially\nflat power law $f(T) \\propto (-T)^{b}$ gravity model. We find that the linear\nand non-linear growth of spherical overdensities of this particular $f(T)$\nmodel are affected by the power-law parameter $b$. Finally, we compute the\npredicted number counts of virialized haloes in order to distinguish the\ncurrent $f(T)$ model from the expectations of the concordance $\\Lambda$\ncosmology. Specifically, the present analysis suggests that the $f(T)$ gravity\nmodel with positive (negative) $b$ predicts more (less) virialized objects with\nrespect to those of $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  In the present paper we study the Hawking radiation as a quantum tunneling\neffect of spin-$1$ particles from a five-dimensional, spherically symmetric,\nEinstein-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet (5D EYMGB) black hole. We solve the Proca\nequation (PE) by applying the WKB approximation and separation of variables via\nHamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation which results in a set of five differential\nequations, and reproduces in this way, the Hawking temperature. In the second\npart of this paper, we extend our results beyond the semiclassical\napproximation. In particular, we derive the logarithmic correction to the\nentropy of the 5D EYMGB black hole and show that the quantum corrected specific\nheat indicates the possible existence of a remnant.\n", "  Two-neutrino double electron capture is a rare nuclear decay where two\nelectrons are simultaneously captured from the atomic shell. For $^{124}$Xe\nthis process has not yet been observed and its detection would provide a new\nreference for nuclear matrix element calculations. We have conducted a search\nfor two-neutrino double electron capture from the K-shell of $^{124}$Xe using\n7636 kg$\\cdot$d of data from the XENON100 dark matter detector. Using a\nBayesian analysis we observed no significant excess above background, leading\nto a lower 90 % credibility limit on the half-life $T_{1/2}>6.5\\times10^{20}$\nyr. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the XENON1T experiment, which is\ncurrently being commissioned, and find a sensitivity of\n$T_{1/2}>6.1\\times10^{22}$ yr after an exposure of 2 t$\\cdot$yr.\n", "  A quantum scalar field in a patch of a fixed, topology-changing, $1+1$\ndimensional \"trousers\" spacetime is studied using the Sorkin-Johnston\nformalism. The isometry group of the patch is the dihedral group, the symmetry\ngroup of the square. The theory is shown to be pathological in a way that can\nbe interpreted as the topology change giving rise to a divergent energy, in\nagreement with previous results. In contrast to previous results, it is shown\nthat the infinite energy is localised not only on the future light cone of the\ntopology changing singularity, but also on the past cone, due to the time\nreversal symmetry of the Sorkin-Johnston state.\n", "  Cosmological perturbation theory is a powerful tool to predict the statistics\nof large-scale structure in the weakly non-linear regime, but even at 1-loop\norder it results in computationally expensive mode-coupling integrals. Here we\npresent a fast algorithm for computing 1-loop power spectra of quantities that\ndepend on the observer's orientation, thereby generalizing the FAST-PT\nframework (McEwen et al., 2016) that was originally developed for scalars such\nas the matter density. This algorithm works for an arbitrary input power\nspectrum and substantially reduces the time required for numerical evaluation.\nWe apply the algorithm to four examples: intrinsic alignments of galaxies in\nthe tidal torque model; the Ostriker-Vishniac effect; the secondary CMB\npolarization due to baryon flows; and the 1-loop matter power spectrum in\nredshift space. Code implementing this algorithm and these applications is\npublicly available at https://github.com/JoeMcEwen/FAST-PT .\n", "  The 2014 March 29 X1 solar flare (SOL20140329T17:48) produced bright\ncontinuum emission in the far- and near-ultraviolet (NUV) and highly asymmetric\nchromospheric emission lines, providing long-sought constraints on the heating\nmechanisms of the lower atmosphere in solar flares. We analyze the continuum\nand emission line data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) of\nthe brightest flaring magnetic footpoints in this flare. We compare the NUV\nspectra of the brightest pixels to new radiative-hydrodynamic predictions\ncalculated with the RADYN code using constraints on a nonthermal electron beam\ninferred from the collisional thick-target modeling of hard X-ray data from\nRHESSI. We show that the atmospheric response to a high beam flux density\nsatisfactorily achieves the observed continuum brightness in the NUV. The NUV\ncontinuum emission in this flare is consistent with hydrogen (Balmer)\nrecombination radiation that originates from low optical depth in a dense\nchromospheric condensation and from the stationary beam-heated layers just\nbelow the condensation. A model producing two flaring regions (a condensation\nand stationary layers) in the lower atmosphere is also consistent with the\nasymmetric Fe II chromospheric emission line profiles observed in the impulsive\nphase.\n", "  Photons that are entangled or correlated in orbital angular momentum have\nbeen extensively used for remote sensing, object identification and imaging. It\nhas recently been demonstrated that intensity fluctuations give rise to the\nformation of correlations in the orbital angular momentum components and\nangular positions of random light. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial\nsignatures and phase information of an object, with rotational symmetries, can\nbe identified using classical orbital angular momentum correlations in random\nlight. The Fourier components imprinted in the digital spiral spectrum of the\nobject, measured through intensity correlations, unveil its spatial and phase\ninformation. Sharing similarities with conventional compressive sensing\nprotocols that exploit sparsity to reduce the number of measurements required\nto reconstruct a signal, our technique allows sensing of an object with fewer\nmeasurements than other schemes that use pixel-by-pixel imaging. One remarkable\nadvantage of our technique is the fact that it does not require the preparation\nof fragile quantum states of light and works at both low- and high-light\nlevels. In addition, our technique is robust against environmental noise, a\nfundamental feature of any realistic scheme for remote sensing.\n", "  Quantum phase transitions between competing ground-state shapes of atomic\nnuclei with an odd number of protons or neutrons are investigated in a\nmicroscopic framework based on nuclear energy density functional theory and the\nparticle-plus-boson-core coupling scheme. The boson-core Hamiltonian, as well\nas the single-particle energies and occupation probabilities of the unpaired\nnucleon, are completely determined by constrained self-consistent mean-field\ncalculations for a specific choice of the energy density functional and paring\ninteraction, and only the strength parameters of the particle-core coupling are\nadjusted to reproduce selected spectroscopic properties of the odd-mass system.\nWe apply this method to odd-A Eu and Sm isotopes with neutron number $N \\approx\n90$, and explore the influence of the single unpaired fermion on the occurrence\nof a shape phase transition. Collective wave functions of low-energy states are\nused to compute quantities that can be related to quantum order parameters:\ndeformations, excitation energies, E2 transition rates and separation energies,\nand their evolution with the control parameter (neutron number) is analysed.\n", "  The plasmonic character of monolayer silicene is investigated by\ntime-dependent density functional theory in the random phase approximation. The\nenergy-loss function of the system is analyzed, with particular reference to\nits induced charge-density fluctuations, i.e., plasmon resonances and\ncorresponding dispersions, occurring in the investigated energy-momentum\nregion. At energies larger than 1.5eV, two intrinsic interband modes are\ndetected and characterized. The first one is a hybridized pi-like plasmon,\nwhich is assisted by competing one-electron processes involving sp2 and sp3\nstates. The second one is a more conventional pi-sigma plasmon, which is more\nintense than the pi-like plasmon and more affected by one-electron processes\ninvolving the sigma bands, with respect to the analogous collective oscillation\nin monolayer graphene. At energies below 1eV, two extrinsic intraband modes are\npredicted to occur, which are generated by distinct types of Dirac electrons\n(associated with different Fermi velocities at the so-called Dirac points). The\nmost intense of them is a two-dimensional plasmon, having an energy-momentum\ndispersion that resembles that of a two-dimensional electron gas. The other is\nan acoustic plasmon that occurs for specific momentum directions and competes\nwith the two-dimensional plasmon at mid infrared energies. The strong\nanisotropic character of this mode cannot be explained in terms of the widely\nused Dirac-cone approximation. As in mono-, bi-, and few-layer graphene, the\nextrinsic oscillations of silicene are highly sensitive to the concentration of\ninjected or ejected charge carriers. More importantly, the two-dimensional and\nacoustic plasmons appear to be a signature of the honeycomb lattice,\nindependently of the chemistry of the group-IV elements and the details of the\nunit-cell geometry.\n", "  We numerically analyze the impact of a single Rydberg electron onto a\nBose-Einstein condensate. Both $S-$ and $D-$ Rydberg states are studied. The\nradial size of $S-$ and $D-$states are comparable, hence the only difference is\ndue to the angular dependence of the wavefunctions. We find the atom losses in\nthe condensate after the excitation of a sequence of Rydberg atoms.\nAdditionally, we investigate the mechanical effect in which the Rydberg atoms\nforce the condensate to oscillate. Our numerical analysis is based on the\nclassical fields approximation. Finally, we compare numerical results to\nexperimental data.\n", "  Building on recent NMR experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 067203], we\ntheoretically investigate the high magnetic field regime of the disordered\nquasi-one-dimensional $S=1$ antiferromagnetic material\nNi(Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$. The interplay between disorder,\nchemically controlled by Br-doping, interactions, and the external magnetic\nfield, leads to a very rich phase diagram. Beyond the well-known\nantiferromagnetically ordered regime, analog of a Bose condensate of magnons,\nwhich disappears when $H\\ge 12.3$ T, we unveil a resurgence of phase coherence\nat higher field $H\\sim 13.6$ T, induced by the doping. Interchain couplings\nstabilize finite temperature long-range order whose extension in the field -\ntemperature space is governed by the concentration of impurities $x$. Such a\n\"mini-condensation\" contrasts with previously reported Bose-glass physics in\nthe same regime, and should be accessible to experiments.\n", "  We have demonstrated a remote magnetometer based on sodium atoms in the\nEarth's mesosphere, at a 106-kilometer distance from our instrument. A\n1.33-watt laser illuminated the atoms, and the magnetic field was inferred from\nback-scattered light collected by a telescope with a 1.55-meter-diameter\naperture. The measurement sensitivity was 162 nT/$\\sqrt{Hz}$. The value of\nmagnetic field inferred from our measurement is consistent with an estimate\nbased on the Earth's known field shape to within a fraction of a percent.\nProjected improvements in optics could lead to sensitivity of 20\nnT/$\\sqrt{Hz}$, and the use of advanced lasers or a large telescope could\napproach 1-nT/$\\sqrt{Hz}$ sensitivity. All experimental and theoretical\nsensitivity values are based on a 60$^\\circ$ angle between the laser beam axis\nand the magnetic field vector; at the optimal 90$^\\circ$ angle sensitivity\nwould be improved by about a factor of two.\n", "  We compute the vacuum energy of three-dimensional asymptotically flat space\nbased on a Chern-Simons formulation for the Poincare group. The equivalent\naction is nothing but the Einstein-Hilbert term in the bulk plus half of the\nGibbons-Hawking term at the boundary. The derivation is based on the evaluation\nof the Noether charges in the vacuum. We obtain that the vacuum energy of this\nspace has the same value as the one of the asymptotically flat limit of\nthree-dimensional anti-de Sitter space.\n", "  We study speeds of fronts in bistable, spatially inhomogeneous media at\nparameter regimes where speeds approach zero. We provide a set of conceptual\nassumptions under which we can prove power-law asymptotics for the speed, with\nexponent depending a local dimension of the ergodic measure near extremal\nvalues. We also show that our conceptual assumptions are satisfied in a context\nof weak inhomogeneity of the medium and almost balanced kinetics, and compare\nasymptotics with numerical simulations.\n", "  We propose a technique to compute the deformation parameter of the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle by using the leading quantum corrections to\nthe Newtonian potential. We just assume General Relativity as theory of\nGravitation, and the thermal nature of the GUP corrections to the Hawking\nspectrum. With these minimal assumptions our calculation gives, to first order,\na specific numerical result. The physical meaning of this value is discussed,\nand compared with the previously obtained bounds on the generalized uncertainty\nprinciple deformation parameter.\n", "  We develop a method to construct a microscopic optical potential from chiral\ninteractions for nucleon-nucleus scattering. The optical potential is\nconstructed by combining the Green's function approach with the coupled-cluster\nmethod. To deal with the poles of the Green's function along the real energy\naxis we employ a Berggren basis in the complex energy plane combined with the\nLanczos method. Using this approach, we perform a proof-of-principle\ncalculation of the optical potential for the elastic neutron scattering on\n$^{16}{\\rm O}$. For the computation of the ground-state of $^{16}{\\rm O}$, we\nuse the coupled-cluster method in the singles-and-doubles approximation, while\nfor the $A=\\pm 1$ nuclei we use particle-attached/removed equation-of-motion\nmethod truncated at two-particle-one-hole and one-particle-two-hole\nexcitations, respectively. We verify the convergence of the optical potential\nand scattering phase shifts with respect to the model-space size and the number\nof discretized complex continuum states. We also investigate the absorptive\ncomponent of the optical potential (which reflects the opening of inelastic\nchannels) by computing its imaginary volume integral and find an almost\nnegligible absorptive component at low-energies. To shed light on this result,\nwe computed excited states of $^{16}{\\rm O}$ using equation-of-motion\ncoupled-cluster method with singles-and-doubles excitations and we found no\nlow-lying excited states below 10~MeV. Furthermore, most excited states have a\ndominant two-particle-two-hole component, making higher-order particle-hole\nexcitations necessary to achieve a precise description of these core-excited\nstates. We conclude that the reduced absorption at low-energies can be\nattributed to the lack of correlations coming from the low-order cluster\ntruncation in the employed coupled-cluster method.\n", "  In this paper we revisit a discrete spectral problem which was proposed by\nRagnisco and Tu in 1989, as a second discretization of the ZS-AKNS spectral\nproblem. We show that the spectral problem corresponds to a bidirectional\ndiscretization of the derivative of two wave functions $\\phi_{1,x}$ and\n$\\phi_{2,x}$. As a connection with higher dimensional systems, the spectral\nproblem and a related hierarchy can be derived from Lax triads of the\ndifferential-difference KP hierarchy via a symmetry constraint. Isospectral and\nnonisospectral flows derived from the spectral problem compose a Lie algebra.\nBy considering its infinite dimensional subalgebras and continuum limit of\nrecursion operator, three semi-discrete AKNS hierarchies are constructed.\n", "  After a brief review of the quark-based model for nuclear matter, and some\npion properties in medium presented in our previous works, we report new\nresults for the pion valence wave function as well as the valence distribution\namplitude in medium, which are presented in our recent article. We find that\nboth the in-medium pion valence distribution and the in-medium pion valence\nwave function, are substantially modified at normal nuclear matter density, due\nto the reduction in the pion decay constant.\n", "  We consider the computation of the Loschmidt echo after quantum quenches in\nthe interacting $XXZ$ Heisenberg spin chain both for real and imaginary times.\nWe study two-site product initial states, focusing in particular on the N\\'eel\nand tilted N\\'eel states. We apply the Quantum Transfer Matrix (QTM) approach\nto derive generalized TBA equations, which follow from the fusion hierarchy of\nthe appropriate QTM's. Our formulas are valid for arbitrary imaginary time and\nfor real times at least up to a time $t_0$, after which the integral equations\nhave to be modified. In some regimes, $t_0$ is seen to be either very large or\ninfinite, allowing to explore in detail the post-quench dynamics of the system.\nAs an important part of our work, we show that for the N\\'eel state our\nimaginary time results can be recovered by means of the quench action approach,\nunveiling a direct connection with the quantum transfer matrix formalism. In\nparticular, we show that in the zero-time limit, the study of our TBA equations\nallows for a simple alternative derivation of the recently obtained Bethe\nansatz distribution functions for the N\\'eel, tilted N\\'eel and tilted\nferromagnet states.\n", "  We use a compatibility between the conformal symmetry and the equations of\nmotion to solve the one-point function in the critical $\\phi^3$-theory (a.k.a\nthe critical Lee-Yang model) on the $d = 6 - \\epsilon$ dimensional real\nprojective space to the first non-trivial order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion. It\nreproduces the conventional perturbation theory and agrees with the numerical\nconformal bootstrap result.\n", "  Community detection, the decomposition of a graph into essential building\nblocks, has been a core research topic in network science over the past years.\nSince a precise notion of what constitutes a community has remained evasive,\ncommunity detection algorithms have often been compared on benchmark graphs\nwith a particular form of assortative community structure and classified based\non the mathematical techniques they employ. However, this comparison can be\nmisleading because apparent similarities in their mathematical machinery can\ndisguise different goals and reasons for why we want to employ community\ndetection in the first place. Here we provide a focused review of these\ndifferent motivations that underpin community detection. This problem-driven\nclassification is useful in applied network science, where it is important to\nselect an appropriate algorithm for the given purpose. Moreover, highlighting\nthe different facets of community detection also delineates the many lines of\nresearch and points out open directions and avenues for future research.\n", "  The mechanism for interconversion between the nuclear spin isomers (NSI) of\nH$_2$O remains shrouded in uncertainties. The temperature dependence displayed\nby NSI interconversion rates for H$_2$O isolated in an Argon matrix provides\nevidence that confinement effects are responsible for the dramatic increase in\ntheir kinetics with respect to the gas phase, providing new pathways for\no-H$_2$O $\\leftrightarrow$ p-H$_2$O conversion in endohedral compounds. This\nreveals intramolecular aspects of the interconversion mechanism which may\nimprove methodologies for the separation and storage of NSI en route to\napplications in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. It may\nalso improve astronomers' ability to use their relative abundance in the\ninterstellar medium as proxies, thereby providing a valuable \"astronomical\nclock\".\n", "  We explore the non-equilibrium dissipative dynamics of a system of identical\ncharged particles trapped on a closed helix. The particles are subject to an\nexternal force accelerating them along the underlying structure. The effective\ninteractions between the charges induce a coupling of the center-of-mass to the\nrelative motion which in turn gives rise to a pinned-to-sliding transition with\nincreasing magnitude of the external force. In the sliding regime we observe an\nOhmic behaviour signified by a constant mobility. Within the same regime a\nstructural transition of the helical particle chain takes place with increasing\nthe helix radius leading to a global change of the crystalline arrangement. The\nresulting crystal is characterized by the existence of multiple defects whose\nnumber increases with the helix radius.\n", "  Fr atom can be successively used to search for the atomic permanent electric\ndipole moment (EDM) [Hyperfine Interactions 236, 53 (2015); Journal of Physics:\nConference Series 691, 012017 (2016)]. It can be induced by the permanent\nelectron EDM predicted by modern extensions of the standard model to be nonzero\nat the level accessible by the new generation of EDM experiments. We consider\nanother mechanism of the atomic EDM generation in Fr. This is caused by the\nscalar-pseudoscalar nucleus-electron neutral current interaction with the\ndimensionless strength constant, $k_{T,P}$. Similar to the electron EDM this\ninteraction violates both spatial parity and time-reversal symmetries and can\nalso induce permanent atomic EDM. It was shown in [Phys. Rev. D 89, 056006\n(2014)] that the scalar-pseudoscalar contribution to the atomic EDM can\ndominate over the direct contribution from the electron EDM within the standard\nmodel. We report high-accuracy combined all-electron and two-step relativistic\ncoupled cluster treatment of the effect from the scalar-pseudoscalar\ninteraction in the Fr atom. Up to the quadruple cluster amplitudes within the\nCCSDT(Q) method were included in correlation treatment. This calculation is\nrequired for the interpretation of the experimental data in terms of $k_{T,P}$.\nThe resulted EDM of the Fr atom expressed in terms of $k_{T,P}$ is $d_{\\rm Fr}=\nk_{T,P} \\cdot 4.50\\cdot10^{-18} e\\cdot {\\rm cm}$, where $e$ is the charge of\nthe electron. The value of the ionization potential of the $^2S_{1/2}$ ground\nstate of Fr calculated within the same methods is in a very good agreement with\nthe experiment.\n", "  Ultralight degrees of freedom coupled to matter lead to resonances, which can\nbe excited when the Compton wavelength of the field equals a dynamical scale in\nthe problem. For binaries composed of a star orbiting a supermassive black\nhole, these resonances lead to a smoking-gun effect: a periastron distance\nwhich {\\it stalls}, even in the presence of gravitational-wave dissipation.\nThis effect, also called a {\\it floating orbit}, occurs for generic equatorial\nbut eccentric orbits and we argue that finite-size effects are not enough to\nsuppress it.\n", "  In this paper we model a canonical acoustic thin shell wormhole (CATSW) in\nthe framework of analogue gravity systems. In this model we apply cut and paste\ntechnique to join together two spherically symmetric, analogue canonical\nacoustic solutions, and compute the analogue surface density/surface pressure\nof the fluid using the Darmois- Israel formalism. We study the stability\nanalyses by using a linear barotropic fluid (LBF), chaplygin fluid (CF),\nlogarithmic fluid (LogF), polytropic fluid (PF), and finally Van der Waals\nQuintessence (VDWQ). We show that a kind of analog acoustic fluid with negative\nenergy is required at the throat to keep the wormhole stable. It is argued\nthat, CATSW can be a stabile thin-shell wormhole if we choose a suitable\nparameter values.\n", "  Since last few years, research based on topological insulators (TI) is in\ngreat interests due to intrinsic exotic fundamental properties and future\npotential applications such as quantum computers or spintronics. The\nfabrication of TI nanodevices and study on their transport properties mostly\nfocused on high quality crystalline nanowires or nanoribbons. Here we report\nrobust approach of Bi2Se3 nanowire formation from deposited flakes using ion\nbeam milling method. The fabricated Bi2Se3 nanowire devices have been employed\nto investigate the robustness of topological surface state (TSS) to gallium ion\ndoping and any deformation in the material due to fabrication tools. We report\nthe quantum oscillations in magnetoresistance curves under the parallel\nmagnetic field. The resistance versus magnetic field curves have been studied\nand compared with Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference effects which further\ndemonstrate the transport through TSS. The fabrication route and observed\nelectronic transport properties indicate clear quantum oscillations and can be\nexploited further in studying the exotic electronic properties associated with\nTI based nanodevices.\n", "  The order parameter of a critical system defined in a layered parallel plate\ngeometry subject to Neumann boundary conditions at the limiting surfaces is\nstudied. We utilize a one-particle irreducible vertex parts framework in order\nto study the critical behavior of such a system. The renormalized vertex parts\nare defined at zero external quasi-momenta, which makes the analysis\nparticularly simple. The distance between the boundary plates $L$\ncharacterizing the finite size system direction perpendicular to the\nhyperplanes plays a similar role here in comparison with our recent unified\ntreatment for Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Critical exponents are\ncomputed using diagrammatic expansion at least up to two-loop order and are\nshown to be identical to those from the bulk theory (limit $L \\rightarrow\n\\infty$).\n", "  With the advent of new wide-field, high-cadence optical transient surveys,\nour understanding of the diversity of core-collapse supernovae has grown\ntremendously in the last decade. However, the pre-supernova evolution of\nmassive stars, that sets the physical backdrop to these violent events, is\ntheoretically not well understood and difficult to probe observationally. Here\nwe report the discovery of the supernova iPTF13dqy = SN 2013fs, a mere ~3 hr\nafter explosion. Our rapid follow-up observations, which include\nmultiwavelength photometry and extremely early (beginning at ~6 hr\npost-explosion) spectra, map the distribution of material in the immediate\nenvironment (<~ 10^15 cm) of the exploding star and establish that it was\nsurrounded by circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected during the final ~1\nyr prior to explosion at a high rate, around 10^-3 solar masses per year. The\ncomplete disappearance of flash-ionised emission lines within the first several\ndays requires that the dense CSM be confined to within <~ 10^15 cm, consistent\nwith radio non-detections at 70--100 days. The observations indicate that\niPTF13dqy was a regular Type II SN; thus, the finding that the probable red\nsupergiant (RSG) progenitor of this common explosion ejected material at a\nhighly elevated rate just prior to its demise suggests that pre-supernova\ninstabilities may be common among exploding massive stars.\n", "  Multidimensional poverty measurement has captured the attention of\npolicy-makers and researchers during recent years. Mexico is one of the most\nadvanced countries in the measurement of poverty beyond income indicators.\nHowever, both in Mexico and other countries which have attempted at measuring\npoverty from a multidimensional perspective, the environmental dimension, has\nbeen well under-represented. Based on international evidence and, using the\nwelfare-rights based methodological framework used in Mexico to measure\nmulti-dimensional poverty officially, the paper proposes an indicator and six\nsub-indicators for measuring the lack of a minimum welfare to fulfil the right\nto a healthy environment through 6 sub-indicators measuring effective access,\nquality and continuity with regards to water, energy, biodiversity, air,\nspatial health, waste management and the vulnerability to poverty from climate\nchange impacts.\n", "  The most massive black holes observed in the Universe weigh up to $\\sim\n10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, nearly independent of redshift. Reaching these\nfinal masses likely required copious accretion and several major mergers.\nEmploying a dynamical approach, that rests on the role played by a new,\nrelevant physical scale - the transition radius - we provide a theoretical\ncalculation of the maximum mass achievable by a black hole seed that forms in\nan isolated halo, one that scarcely merged. Incorporating effects at the\ntransition radius and their impact on the evolution of accretion in isolated\nhaloes we are able to obtain new limits for permitted growth. We find that\nlarge black hole seeds ($M_{\\bullet} \\gtrsim 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$)\nhosted in small isolated halos ($M_h \\lesssim 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$)\naccreting with relatively small radiative efficiencies ($\\epsilon \\lesssim\n0.1$) grow optimally in these circumstances. Moreover, we show that the\nstandard $M_{\\bullet}-\\sigma$ relation observed at $z \\sim 0$ cannot be\nestablished in isolated halos at high-$z$, but requires the occurrence of\nmergers. Since the average limiting mass of black holes formed at $z \\gtrsim\n10$ is in the range $10^{4-6} \\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, we expect to observe them\nin local galaxies as intermediate-mass black holes, when hosted in the rare\nhaloes that experienced only minor or no merging events. Such ancient black\nholes, formed in isolation with subsequent scant growth, could survive, almost\nunchanged, until present.\n", "  We reconstruct the field potentials in case of (non)phantom fields for\ndifferent models resulting from parametrization of q(t), a(t) or H(t). In\naddition we carry out similar procedure for tachyonic field. We also discuss\nspecific form of parametrization for reconstruction of scalar field potential.\n", "  We review results about the development and asymptotic nature of\nsingularities in `brane-bulk' systems. These arise for warped metrics obeying\nthe 5-dimensional Einstein equations with fluid-like sources, and including a\nbrane 4-metric that is either Minkowski or de Sitter or Anti-de Sitter. We\ncharacterize all singular Minkowski brane solutions, and look for regular\nsolutions with nonzero curvature. We briefly comment on matching solutions,\nenergy conditions and finite Planck mass criteria for admissibility, and we\nbriefly discuss the connection of these results to ambient theory.\n", "  The interaction between thin structures and incompressible Newtonian fluids\nis ubiquitous both in nature and in industrial applications. In this paper we\npresent an isogeometric formulation of such problems which exploits a boundary\nintegral formulation of Stokes equations to model the surrounding flow, and a\nnon linear Kirchhoff-Love shell theory to model the elastic behaviour of the\nstructure. We propose three different coupling strategies: a monolithic, fully\nimplicit coupling, a staggered, elasticity driven coupling, and a novel\nsemi-implicit coupling, where the effect of the surrounding flow is\nincorporated in the non-linear terms of the solid solver through its damping\ncharacteristics. The novel semi-implicit approach is then used to demonstrate\nthe power and robustness of our method, which fits ideally in the isogeometric\nparadigm, by exploiting only the boundary representation (B-Rep) of the thin\nstructure middle surface.\n", "  Strong lensing by intervening galaxies can produce multiple images of\ngravitational waves from sources at cosmological distances. These images\nacquire additional phase-shifts as the over-focused wavefront passes through\nitself along the line of sight. Time domain waveforms of Type-II images\n(associated with saddle points of the time delay) exhibit a non-trivial\ndistortion from the unlensed waveforms. This phenomenon is in addition to the\nusual frequency-independent magnification, and happens even in the geometric\nlimit where the wavelength is much shorter than the deflector's gravitational\nlength scale. Similarly, Type-III images preserve the original waveform's shape\nbut exhibit a sign flip. We show that for non-precessing binaries undergoing\ncircular inspiral and merger, these distortions are equivalent to rotating the\nline of sight about the normal to the orbital plane by $45^\\circ$ (Type II) and\n$90^\\circ$ (Type III). This effect will enable us to distinguish between the\ndifferent topological types among a set of multiple images, and give us\nvaluable insight into the lens model. Furthermore, we show that for eccentric\nbinaries, the waveform of a Type-II image is distorted in a manner that is\ninequivalent to a change of the source's orbital parameters.\n", "  We have developed FFT beamforming techniques for the CHIME radio telescope,\nto search for and localize the astrophysical signals from Fast Radio Bursts\n(FRBs) over a large instantaneous field-of-view (FOV) while maintaining the\nfull angular resolution of CHIME. We implement a hybrid beamforming pipeline in\na GPU correlator, synthesizing 256 FFT-formed beams in the North-South\ndirection by four formed beams along East-West via exact phasing, tiling a sky\narea of ~250 square degrees. A zero-padding approximation is employed to\nimprove chromatic beam alignment across the wide bandwidth of 400 to 800 MHz.\nWe up-channelize the data in order to achieve fine spectral resolution of\n$\\Delta\\nu$=24 kHz and time cadence of 0.983 ms, desirable for detecting\ntransient and dispersed signals such as those from FRBs.\n", "  We present a construction of the action, in the framework of the calculus of\nvariations and Sobolev spaces, describing deformations and the oscillations of\na uniformly rotating, elastic and self-gravitating earth. We establish the\nFr\\'{e}chet differentiability of the action under minimal regularity\nassumptions, which constrain the possible composition of an earth model. Thus\nwe obtain well-defined Euler-Lagrange equations, weakly and strongly, that is,\nthe system of elastic-gravitational equations.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to introduce and analyze a new gauge symmetry that\nappears in complex holomorphic systems. This symmetry allow us to project the\nsystem, using different gauge conditions, to several real systems which are\nconnect by gauge transformations in the complex space. We prove that the space\nof solutions of one system is related to the other by the gauge transformation.\nThe gauge transformations are in some cases canonical transformations. However,\nin other cases are more general transformations that change the symplectic\nstructure, but there is still a map between the systems. In this way our\nconstruction extend the group of canonical transformations in classical\nmechanics. Also, we show how to extend the analysis to the quantum case using\npath integrals by means of the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky theorem and within\nthe canonical formalism, where we show explicitly that solutions of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation are gauge related.\n", "  We introduce a generalized worldline model where the partition function is a\nsum over configurations of a conserved flux on a d-dimensional lattice. The\nweights for the configurations of the corresponding worldlines have factors\nliving on the links of the lattice, as well as terms which live on the sites x\nand depend on all fluxes attached to x. The model represents a general class of\nworldline systems, among them the dual representation of the relativistic Bose\ngas at finite density. We construct a suitable worm algorithm and show how to\ncorrectly distribute the site weights in the various Metropolis probabilities\nthat determine the worm. We analyze the algorithm in detail and give a proof of\ndetailed balance. Our algorithm admits the introduction of an amplitude\nparameter A that can be chosen freely. Using a numerical simulation of the\nrelativistic Bose gas we demonstrate that A allows one to influence the\nstarting and terminating probabilities and thus the average length and the\nefficiency of the worm.\n", "  Electron emission from liquid into gaseous xenon is a cornerstone of dark\nmatter search detectors such as ZEPLIN, XENON, LUX and LZ. The probability of\nemission is a function of the applied electric field E, and electrons which\nfail to pass from the liquid into the gas have been previously hypothesized to\nbecome thermalized and trapped. This article shows, for the first time,\nquantitative agreement between an electron emission model and existing data.\nThe model predicts that electrons in the liquid must surmount a typical\npotential barrier phi_b=0.34+-0.01 eV in order to escape into the gas. This\nvalue is a factor of about x2 smaller than has previously been calculated or\ninferred. Knowledge of phi_b allows calculation of the lifetime of thermalized,\ntrapped electrons. The value is O(10) ms, which appears to be compatible with\nXENON10 observations of electron train backgrounds. As these backgrounds limit\nthe sensitivity of dark sector dark matter searches, possible mitigations are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The fractal scaling properties of turbulent premixed flame fronts have been\ninvestigated and considered for modelling sub-grid scales in the\nLarge-Eddy-Simulation framework. Since the width of such thin reaction fronts\ncannot be resolved into the coarse mesh of LES, the extent of wrinkled flame\nsurface contained in a volume is taken into account. The amount of unresolved\nflame front is estimated via the \"wrinkling facto\" that depends on the\ndefinition of a suitable fractal dimension and the scale at which the fractal\nscaling is lost, the inner cut-off length {\\epsilon}i. In this context, the\npresent study considers laboratory experiments and one-step reaction DNS of\nturbulent premixed jet flames in different regimes of turbulent premixed\nflames. Fractal dimension is found to be substantially constant and well below\nthat typical of passive scalar fronts. The inner cut-off length shows a clear\nscaling with the dissipative scale of Kolmogorov for the regimes here\nconsidered. These features have been exploited performing Large Eddy\nSimulations. Good model performance has been found comparing the LES against a\ncorresponding DNS at moderate Reynolds number and experimental data at higher\nReynolds numbers.\n", "  We consider a mechanical system which is controlled by means of moving\nconstraints. Namely, we assume that some of the coordinates can be directly\nassigned as functions of time by means of frictionless constraints. This leads\nto a system of ODE's whose right hand side depends quadratically on the time\nderivative of the control. In this paper we introduce a simplified dynamics,\ndescribed by a differential inclusion. We prove that every trajectory of the\ndifferential inclusion can be uniformly approximated by a trajectory of the\noriginal system, on a sufficiently large time interval, starting at rest. Under\na somewhat stronger assumption, we show this second trajectory reaches exactly\nthe same terminal point.\n", "  Lasing and steady state superradiance are two phenomena that may appear at\nfirst glance to be distinct. In a laser, phase information is maintained by a\nmacroscopic intracavity light field, and the robustness of this phase is what\nleads to the coherence of the output light. In contrast, the coherence of\nsteady-state superradiant systems derives from the macroscopic collective\ndipole of a many-atom ensemble. In this paper, we develop a quantum theory that\nconnects smoothly between these two extreme limits. We show that lasing and\nsteady-state superradiance should be thought of as the two extreme limits of a\ncontinuous crossover. The properties of systems that lie in the superradiance,\nlasing, and crossover parameter regions are compared. We find that for a given\noutput intensity a narrower linewidth can be obtained by operating closer to\nthe superradiance side of the crossover. We also find that the collective phase\nis robust against cavity frequency fluctuations in the superradiant regime and\nagainst atomic level fluctuations in the lasing regime.\n", "  The ability to tailor a coherent surface plasmon polariton (SPP) field is an\nimportant step towards a number of new opportunities for a broad range of\nnanophotonic applications such as sensing [1,2], nano-circuitry [3,4], optical\ndata storage [5,6], super-resolution imaging [7,8], plasmonic tweezers [9,10]\nand in-plane communications [11]. Scanning a converging SPP spot or designing\nSPP profiles using an ensemble of spots have both been demonstrated previously\n[12-14]. SPPs, however, are normally excited by intense, coherent light\nsources-lasers. Hence, interference between adjacent spots is inevitable and\nwill affect the overall SPP field distributions. Here we report a\nreconfigurable and wavelength-independent platform for generating a tailored 2D\nSPP field distribution by considering the coherent field as a whole rather than\nindividual spots. The new perspective also enables us to reveal the inherent\nconstraints implied in a 2D coherent field distribution. Our generic design\nmethodology works not only for SPP waves but also for other two-dimensional\nwave systems like surface acoustic waves [15].\n", "  Contemporary debates on \"open science\" mostly focus on the pub- lic\naccessibility of the products of scientific and academic work. In contrast,\nthis paper presents arguments for \"opening\" the ongoing work of science. That\nis, this paper is an invitation to rethink the university with an eye toward\nengaging the public in the dynamic, conceptual and representational work\ninvolved in creating scientific knowledge. To this end, we posit that public\ncomputing spaces, a genre of open- ended, public learning environment where\nvisitors interact with open source computing platforms to directly access,\nmodify and create complex and authentic scientific work, can serve as a\npossible model of \"open science\" in the university.\n", "  We demonstrate that 4-body real space Jastrow factors are, with the right\ntype of Jastrow basis function, capable of performing successful wave function\nstenciling to remove unwanted ionic terms from an overabundant fermionic\nreference without unduly modifying the remaining components. In addition to\ngreatly improving size consistency (restoring it exactly in the case of a\ngeminal power), real-space wave function stenciling is, unlike its Hilbert\nspace predecessors, immediately compatible with diffusion Monte Carlo, allowing\nit to be used in the pursuit of compact, strongly correlated trial functions\nwith reliable nodal surfaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in\nthe context of a double bond dissociation by using it to extract a\nqualitatively correct nodal surface despite being paired with a restricted\nSlater determinant, that, due to ionic term errors, produces a ground state\nwith a qualitatively incorrect nodal surface when used in the absence of the\nJastrow.\n", "  We report on results of nonequilibrium transport measurements made on thin\nfilms of germanium-telluride (Ge_xTe) at cryogenic temperatures. Owing to a\nrather large deviation from stoichiometry (app. 10% of Ge vacancies), these\nfilms exhibit p-type conductivity with carrier-concentration N>10^20cm^(-3) and\ncan be made either in the diffusive or strongly-localized regime by a judicious\nchoice of preparation and post-treatment conditions. In both regimes the system\nshows persistent photoconductivity following excitation by a brief exposure to\ninfrared radiation. Persistent photoconductivity is also observed in GexTe\nsamples alloyed with Mn. However, in both Ge_xTe and GeMn_xTe_y the effect is\nmuch weaker than that observable in GeSb_xTe_y alloys suggesting that antimony\nplays an important role in the phenomenon. Structural studies of these films\nreveal an unusual degree of texture that is rarely realized in\nstrongly-disordered systems with high carrier-concentrations.\nAnderson-localized samples of Ge_xTe exhibit non-ergodic transport which are\ncharacteristic of intrinsic electron-glasses, including a well developed\nmemory-dip and slow relaxation of the excess conductance created in the excited\nstate. These results support the conjecture that electron-glass effects with\ninherently long relaxation times is a generic property of all\nAnderson-localized systems with large carrier-concentration.\n", "  Rayleigh-Benard convection is not only a classical problem in fluid dynamics\nbut plays also an important role in many metallurgical and crystal growth\napplications. The measurement of the flow field and of the dynamics of the\nemerging large-scale circulation in liquid metals is a challenging task due to\nthe opaqueness and the high temperature of the melts. Contactless inductive\nflow tomography is a technique to visualize the mean three-dimensional flow\nstructure in liquid metals by measuring the flow induced magnetic field\nperturbations under the influence of one or several applied magnetic fields. In\nthis paper, we present first measurements of the flow induced magnetic field in\na Rayleigh-Benard setup, which are also used to investigate the dynamics of the\nlarge-scale circulation. Additionally, we investigate numerically the quality\nof the reconstruction of the three-dimensional flow field for different sensor\nconfigurations.\n", "  We propose an effective method to decrease the Ramsey linewidth of microwave\natomic clock by tracking the coherent atomic phase through nondestructive\nmeasurement. The free evolution time T between two Ramsey pulses is divided\ninto N subsections. In each subsection, the coherent phase of the atomic\nensemble is probed by an additional large-detuning laser. The probed phase in\nthe previous subsection is used to change the phase of the microwave pulse in\nthe following subsection. After tracking the coherent atomic phase for N-1\ntimes, the final linewidth of Ramsey fringe decreases quickly as N/(2N-1). We\nthen demonstrate this proposal in a vapor cell atomic clock. The linewidth of\nthe Ramsey fringe is decreased down to 27 Hz after 5 successive\nsub-interrogations, which is much narrower than the linewidth of 142 Hz\nobtained by normal Ramsey spectroscopy.\n", "  We investigate the long-time stability of the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus\nsystem by considering a planar secular model, that can be regarded as a major\nrefinement of the approach first introduced by Lagrange. Indeed, concerning the\nplanetary orbital revolutions, we improve the classical circular approximation\nby replacing it with a solution that is invariant up to order two in the\nmasses; therefore, we investigate the stability of the secular system for\nrather small values of the eccentricities. First, we explicitly construct a\nKolmogorov normal form, so as to find an invariant KAM torus which approximates\nvery well the secular orbits. Finally, we adapt the approach that is at basis\nof the analytic part of the Nekhoroshev's theorem, so as to show that there is\na neighborhood of that torus for which the estimated stability time is larger\nthan the lifetime of the Solar System. The size of such a neighborhood,\ncompared with the uncertainties of the astronomical observations, is about ten\ntimes smaller.\n", "  Superbursts were discovered at the beginning of this millennium. Just like\ntype-I X-ray bursts, they are thought to be due to thermonuclear shell flashes\non neutron stars, only igniting much deeper. With respect to type-I bursts,\nthey last 10$^3$ times longer, are 10$^3$ as rare, ignite 10$^3$ times deeper\n(in column depth) and are thought to be fueled by carbon instead of hydrogen\nand helium. Observationally, they are sometimes hard to distinguish from\nintermediate duration bursts which are due to pure helium flashes on cold\nneutron stars. So far, 26 superbursts have been detected from 15 neutron stars\nin low-mass X-ray binaries that also exhibit type-I bursts. They are very\ndifficult to catch and only 2 have been measured with highly sensitive\ninstrumentation. Superbursts are sensitive probes of the neutron star crust and\nthe accretion disk. The superburst phenomenon is not fully understood.\nQuestions remain about the nature of the fuel, the collection of that fuel and\nthe ignition conditions. The current state of affairs is reviewed and possible\nresolutions that lay ahead in the future discussed.\n", "  High energy cosmic rays, with energies thousands of times higher than those\nencountered in particle accelerators, offer scientists the means of\ninvestigating the elementary properties of matter. In order to detect high\nenergy cosmic rays, new detection hardware and experimental methods are being\ndeveloped. In this work, we describe the network of HELYCON (HEllenic LYceum\nCosmic Observatories Network) autonomous stations for the detection and\ndirectional reconstruction of Extended Atmospheric Showers (EAS)\nparticle-fronts. HELYCON stations are hybrid stations consisting of three large\nplastic scintillators plus a CODALEMA antenna for the RF detection of EAS\nparticle-fronts. We present the installation, operation and calibration of\nthree HELYCON stations and the electronic components for the remote control,\nmonitor and Data Acquisition. We report on the software package developed for\nthe detailed simulation of the detectors' response and for the stations'\noperation. The simulation parameters have been fine tuned in order to\naccurately describe each individual detector's characteristics and the\noperation of each HELYCON station. Finally, the evaluation of the stations'\nperformance in reconstructing the direction of the EAS particle-front is being\npresented.\n", "  We present new method for studying the equilibrium properties of interacting\nfluids in an arbitrary external filed. The method is valid in any dimension and\nit yields an exact results in one dimension. Using this approach, we derive a\nrecurrence relation for the pair distribution function of a three dimensional\nin-homogeneous fluids, constitute of spherical molecules with arbitrary nearest\nneighbour interaction that extends to two molecules diameter. By integrating\nthis recurrence relation, we get an explicit expressions for the entropy and\nfree energy functionals as a functionals of the density and the pair\ndistribution function. We show that for one dimensional systems, our results\ncoincide exactly with previously derived one using a completely different\napproach.\n", "  We investigate the basic thermal, mechanical and structural properties of\nbody centred cubic iron ($\\alpha$-Fe) at several temperatures and positive\nloading by means of Molecular Dynamics simulations in conjunction with the\nembedded-atom method potential and its modified counterpart one. Computations\nof its thermal properties like average energy and density of atoms, transport\nsound velocities at finite temperatures and pressures are detailed studied as\nwell. Moreover, there are suggestions to obtain hexagonal close- packed\nstructure ($\\varepsilon$-phase) of this metal under positive loading. To\ndemonstrate that, one can increase sufficiently the pressure of simulated\nsystem at several temperature's ranges; these structural changes depend only on\npotential type used. The ensuring structures are studied via the pair radial\ndistribution functions (PRDF) and precise common- neighbour analysis method\n(CNA) as well.\n", "  The reaction ensemble and the constant pH method are well-known chemical\nequilibrium approaches to simulate protonation and deprotonation reactions in\nclassical molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. In this article, we\nshow similarity between both methods {under certain conditions}. We perform\nmolecular dynamics simulations of a weak polyelectrolyte in order to compare\nthe titration curves obtained by both approaches. Our findings reveal a good\nagreement between the methods when the reaction ensemble is used to sweep the\nreaction constant. Pronounced differences between the reaction ensemble and the\nconstant pH method can be observed for stronger acids and bases in terms of\nadaptive pH values. These deviations are due to the presence of explicit\nprotons in the reaction ensemble method which induce a screening of\nelectrostatic interactions between the charged titrable groups of the\npolyelectrolyte. The outcomes of our simulation hint to a better applicability\nof the reaction ensemble method for systems in confined geometries and titrable\ngroups in polyelectrolytes with different pK$_\\text{a}$ values.\n", "  We theoretically study electrical responses of magnetization in Weyl\nsemimetals. The Weyl semimetal is a new class of topological semimetals,\npossessing hedgehog type spin textures in momentum space. Because of this\npeculiar spin texture, an interplay of electron transport and spin dynamics\nmight provide new method to electrical control of magnetization. In this paper,\nwe consider the magnetically doped Weyl semimetals, and systematically study\ncurrent- and charge-induced spin torque exerted on the local magnetization in\nthree-dimensional Dirac-Weyl metals. We determine all current-induced spin\ntorques including spin-orbit torque, spin-transfer torque, and the so-called\n$\\beta$-term, up to first order with respect to spatial and temporal derivation\nand electrical currents. We find that spin-transfer torque and $\\beta$-term are\nabsent while spin-orbit torque is proportional to the axial current density. We\nalso calculate the charge-induced spin torque microscopically. We find the\ncharge-induced spin torque originates from the chiral anomaly due to the\ncorrespondence between spin operators and axial current operators in our model.\n", "  We show that the higher order curvature corrections to general relativity in\nthe strong gravity regime of near horizon scales produce a rapidly oscillating\nand infalling Ricci scalar fireball just outside the horizon. This can generate\nthe ringdown modes of gravitational waves having the same natural frequency as\nthose which are generated by the black hole mergers. Our analysis provides a\nviable explanation to the echoes in the ringdown modes recently detected from\nthe LIGO data, without invoking the existence of any exotic structures at the\nhorizon.\n", "  Theoretically and experimentally we have proved the existence of optimal\nthickness of the porous layer used as an anti-reflection coating in solar\ncells. We have taken into account the joint mechanisms of generation and\nrecombination of electrons and holes stimulated by photons. The porous silicon\nsurface has been obtained by electrochemical etching. Results of scanning\nelectron microscopy, measuring short-circuit current, open circuit voltage, and\netching time have shown that in case thickness of the porous layer is\napproximately 2/3 of electron diffusion length the solar cell efficiency\nincreases by 30% in comparison with the corresponding value in the absence of\ntexturing.\n", "  Previous research on unstable footwear has suggested that it may induce\nplantar mechanical noise during walking. The purpose of this study was to\nexplore whether unstable footwear could be considered as a noise-based training\ngear to exercise body center of mass (CoM) motion during walking or not. Ground\nreaction forces were collected among 24 healthy young women walking at speeds\nbetween 3 and 6 km h-1 with control running shoes and unstable rocker-bottom\nshoes. The external mechanical work, the recovery of mechanical energy of the\nCoM during and within the step cycles, and the phase shift between potential\nand kinetic energy curves of the CoM were computed. Our findings support the\nidea that unstable rocker-bottom footwear could serve as a speed-dependent\nnoise- based training gear to exercise CoM motion during walking. At slow\nspeed, it acts as a stochastic resonance or facilitator, whereas at brisk speed\nit acts as a constraint.\n", "  In this article we investigate the stability of quantized yrast (QY) states\nin a mixture of two distinguishable equal mass bosonic atoms, $A$ and $B$,\nconfined in a ring. We focus our investigation in the study of the energetic\nstability since the Bloch analysis and the Bogoliubov theory establish that\nonly energetically stable QY states are capable of sustain a persistent\ncurrent. Based on physical considerations the stability is studied in two\ndifferent two-dimensional planes. One is when we are studying the stability of\na single QY state which is realized in the $U_{AB}\\times U$ plane spanned by\nthe inter and intraspecies interaction strengths with fixed values of angular\nmomentum per particle $l$ and population imbalance $f$ equal to the labels of\nthe QY state. We found that the energetic phase boundary is the positive branch\nof a hyperbola and the energetically stable domain the internal region of this\npositive branch. The other is when we are studying the stability at a fixed\ndynamics which is realized in the $l\\times f$ plane spanned by $l$ and $f$ with\nfixed values of the interaction strengths. The QY states are introduced when we\npostulate a correspondence between points in sector of the $l\\times f$ plane of\nphysical significance (SPS), defined by $-\\infty< l<\\infty$ and $-1\\leq f\\leq\n1$, and QY states. The stability diagram in the SPS is determined by the\noverlap of the stability diagram in all $l\\times f$ plane and the SPS. We found\nthat there are critical values of $f$ and $l$. $f_\\mathrm{crit}(l)$ gives the\nsize of the window of energetic stability in the sense that for a given $l$\nonly QY states with $0\\leq f<f_\\mathrm{crit}(l)$ are energetically stable. On\nthe other hand, $l_\\mathrm{crit}$ states that there is none energetically\nstable QY state with $l>l_\\mathrm{crit}$.\n", "  Predicting the ground state of alloy systems is challenging due to the large\nnumber of possible configurations. We identify an easily computed descriptor\nfor the stability of binary surface alloys, the effective coordination number\n$\\mathscr{E}$. We show that $\\mathscr{E}(M)$ correlates well with the enthalpy\nof mixing, from density functional theory (DFT) calculations on\n$M_x$Au$_{1-x}$/Ru [$M$ = Mn or Fe]. At each $x$, the most favored structure\nhas the highest [lowest] value of $\\mathscr{E}(M)$ if the system is\nnon-magnetic [ferromagnetic]. Importantly, little accuracy is lost upon\nreplacing $\\mathscr{E}(M)$ by $\\mathscr{E}^*(M)$, which can be quickly computed\nwithout performing a DFT calculation, possibly offering a simple alternative to\nthe frequently used cluster expansion method.\n", "  There is mounting evidence of a link between the properties of\nelectroencephalograms (EEGs) of depressive patients and the outcome of\npharmacotherapy. The goal of this study was to develop an EEG biomarker of\nantidepressant treatment response which would require only a single EEG\nmeasurement. We recorded resting, 21-channel EEG in 17 inpatients suffering\nfrom bipolar depression in eyes closed and eyes open conditions. The EEG\nmeasurement was performed at the end of the short washout period which followed\npreviously unsuccessful pharmacotherapy. We calculated the normalized wavelet\npower of alpha rhythm using two referential montages and an average reference\nmontage. In particular, in the occipital (O1, O2, Oz) channels the wavelet\npower of responders was up to 84% higher than that of nonresponders. Using a\nnovel classification algorithm we were able to correctly predict the outcome of\ntreatment with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The proposed biomarker\nrequires only a single EEG measurement and consequently is intrinsically\ndifferent from biomarkers which exploit the changes in prefrontal EEG induced\nby pharmacotherapy over a given time.\n", "  We investigate an extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM) containing a $SU(2)$ Higgs triplet of zero hypercharge and a gauge\nsinglet. We focus on a scenario of this model which allows a light pseudoscalar\nand/or a scalar below $100$ GeV in the spectrum, consistent with the most\nrecent data from the LHC and the earlier data from the LEP experiments. The\ntriplet extension gives rise to two additional charged Higgs bosons which do\nnot couple to fermions but can decay into $Z W^\\pm$. The presence of a very\nlight pseudoscalar opens $a_1 W^\\pm$ decay mode for the light charged Higgs\nboson just like $Z_3$ symmetric singlet-extension (NMSSM). A triplet type\ncharged Higgs can be produced via vector boson fusion at the tree-level which\nis absent in 2HDM and MSSM and NMSSM. If such charged Higgs boson is pair\nproduced both $Z W^\\pm$ and $a_1 W^\\pm$ decay modes can be probed which can\nprove the existence of triplet and singlet both.\n", "  The anomalous dimension for the gauge-invariant-canonical decomposition of\nthe energy-momentum tensor for quarks and gluons is studied by the background\nfield method. In particular, the consistency between the background field\nmethod and the renormalization in the gluonic sectors is investigated. The\nanalysis shows that the naive gauge-invariant-decomposition has an\ninconsistency between its definition and the renormalization in the background\nfield method. Although we try to consider a trick to overcome this\ninconsistency in computing the anomalous dimension, the gauge-parameter\ndependence remains in the final result. This result should be extended to the\nproblems on the gauge-invariant-canonical-spin decomposition.\n", "  The most general linear and local set of boundary conditions, involving\nrelations between the normal components of the D and B vectors and tangential\ncomponents of the E and H vectors at each point of the boundary, are considered\nin this paper. Reflection of a plane wave from a boundary defined by general\nconditions in an isotropic half space is analyzed and an analytic expression\nfor the reflection dyadic is derived. It is shown that any plane wave can be\ndecomposed in two components which do not interact in reflection. Properties of\nplane waves matched to the general boundary are given. Certain special cases of\nboundary conditions, arising naturally from the general theory and labeled as\nE-boundary, H-boundary and EH-boundary conditions, are introduced as\ninteresting novelties and some of their properties are studied. Previously\nknown special cases are considered in verifying the theory. A possible\nrealization of the general boundary in terms of an interface of a general\nbi-anisotropic medium is discussed in an Appendix.\n", "  The lightest electroweak baryon as a topological object is investigated by\nusing a general effective Lagrangian of composite electroweak symmetry breaking\nand the spin-independent electroweak baryon-nucleon scattering cross section is\ncalculated. We explicitly show the masses of the electroweak baryons and the\ncross section as functions of the Peskin-Takeuchi $S$ parameter and the ratio\nof the masses of axial-vector and vector composite bosons. We find that it is\nacceptable to regard the electroweak baryon as a dark matter candidate and the\neven number of technicolor is favored.\n", "  An organism's ability to move freely is a fundamental behaviour in the animal\nkingdom. To understand animal locomotion requires a characterisation of the\nmaterial properties, as well as the biomechanics and physiology. We present a\nbiomechanical model of C. elegans locomotion together with a novel finite\nelement method. We formulate our model as a nonlinear initial-boundary value\nproblem which allows the study of the dynamics of arbitrary body shapes,\nundulation gaits and the link between the animal's material properties and its\nperformance across a range of environments. Our model replicates behaviours\nacross a wide range of environments. It makes strong predictions on the viable\nrange of the worm's Young's modulus and suggests that animals can control speed\nvia the known mechanism of gait modulation that is observed across different\nmedia.\n", "  -In the Alvarez-Macovski method [R.E. Alvarez and A. Macovski, Phys. Med.\nBiol., 1976, 733-744], the attenuation coefficient is approximated as a linear\ncombination of functions of energy multiplied by coefficients that depend on\nthe material composition at points within the object. The method then computes\nthe line integrals of the basis set coefficient from measurements with\ndifferent x-ray spectra. This paper shows that the transformation from photon\ncounting detector data with pileup to the line integrals can become\nill-conditioned under some circumstances leading to highly increased noise.\nMethods: An idealized model that includes pileup and quantum noise is used. The\nnoise variance of the line integral estimates is computed using the\nCram{\\`e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). The CRLB is computed as a function of object\nthickness for photon counting detector data with three and four bin pulse\nheight analysis (PHA) and low and high pileup. Results: With four bin PHA data\nthe transformation is well conditioned with either high or low pileup. With\nthree bin PHA and high pileup, the transformation becomes ill-conditioned for\nspecific values of object attenuation. At these values the CRLB variance\nincreases by approximately 10 5 compared with the four bin PHA or low pileup\nresults. The condition number of the forward transformation matrix also shows a\nspike at those attenuation values. Conclusion: Designers of systems using\ncounting detectors should study the stability of the line integral estimator\noutput with their data.\n", "  Understanding human migration is of great interest to demographers and social\nscientists. User generated digital data has made it easier to study such\npatterns at a global scale. Geo coded Twitter data, in particular, has been\nshown to be a promising source to analyse large scale human migration. But\ngiven the scale of these datasets, a lot of manual effort has to be put into\nprocessing and getting actionable insights from this data.\n  In this paper, we explore feasibility of using a new tool, tensor\ndecomposition, to understand trends in global human migration. We model human\nmigration as a three mode tensor, consisting of (origin country, destination\ncountry, time of migration) and apply CP decomposition to get meaningful low\ndimensional factors. Our experiments on a large Twitter dataset spanning 5\nyears and over 100M tweets show that we can extract meaningful migration\npatterns.\n", "  This paper analyses an SIRS-type model for infectious diseases with account\nfor behavioural changes associated with the simultaneous spread of awareness in\nthe population. Two types of awareness are included into the model: private\nawareness associated with direct contacts between unaware and aware\npopulations, and public information campaign. Stability analysis of different\nsteady states in the model provides information about potential spread of\ndisease in a population, and well as about how the disease dynamics is affected\nby the two types of awareness. Numerical simulations are performed to\nillustrate the behaviour of the system in different dynamical regimes.\n", "  The ancient phrase, \"All roads lead to Rome\" applies to Chemistry and\nPhysics. Both are highly evolved sciences, with their own history, traditions,\nlanguage, and approaches to problems. Despite all these differences, these two\nroads generally lead to the same place. For high temperature cuprate\nsuperconductors however, the Chemistry and Physics roads do not meet or even\ncome close to each other. In this paper, we analyze the physics and chemistry\napproaches to the doped electronic structure of cuprates and find the chemistry\ndoped hole (out-of-the-CuO$\\mathrm{_2}$-planes) leads to explanations of a vast\narray of normal state cuprate phenomenology using simple counting arguments.\nThe chemistry picture suggests that phonons are responsible for\nsuperconductivity in cuprates. We identify the important phonon modes, and show\nthat the observed T$\\mathrm{_c} \\sim 100$ K, the T$\\mathrm{_c}$-dome as a\nfunction of hole doping, the change in T$\\mathrm{_c}$ as a function of the\nnumber of CuO$\\mathrm{_2}$ layers per unit cell, the lack of an isotope effect\nat optimal T$\\mathrm{_c}$ doping, and the D-wave symmetry of the\nsuperconducting Cooper pair wavefunction are all explained by the chemistry\npicture. Finally, we show that \"crowding\" the dopants in cuprates leads to a\npair wavefunction with S-wave symmetry and T$\\mathrm{_c}\\approx280-390$ K.\nHence, we believe there is enormous \"latent\" T$\\mathrm{_c}$ remaining in the\ncuprate class of superconductors.\n", "  The strong-interaction limit of the Hohenberg-Kohn functional defines a\nmultimarginal optimal transport problem with Coulomb cost. From physical\narguments, the solution of this limit is expected to yield strictly-correlated\nparticle positions, related to each other by co-motion functions (or optimal\nmaps), but the existence of such a deterministic solution in the general\nthree-dimensional case is still an open question. A conjecture for the\nco-motion functions for radially symmetric densities was presented in\nPhys.~Rev.~A {\\bf 75}, 042511 (2007), and later used to build approximate\nexchange-correlation functionals for electrons confined in low-density quantum\ndots. Colombo and Stra [Math.~Models Methods Appl.~Sci., {\\bf 26} 1025 (2016)]\nhave recently shown that these conjectured maps are not always optimal. Here we\nrevisit the whole issue both from the formal and numerical point of view,\nfinding that even if the conjectured maps are not always optimal, they still\nyield an interaction energy (cost) that is numerically very close to the true\nminimum. We also prove that the functional built from the conjectured maps has\nthe expected functional derivative also when they are not optimal.\n", "  I study the impact of recent measurements performed at the Relativistic Heavy\nIon Collider on the determination of helicity-dependent parton distribution\nfunctions of the proton. Specifically, I consider: preliminary data on\nlongitudinally single-spin asymmetries for $W$-boson production recorded by the\nSTAR experiment during the 2013 run at a center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=510$\nGeV; data on longitudinally double-spin asymmetries for di-jet production\nrecorded by the STAR experiment during the 2009 run at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV; and\ndata on longitudinally double-spin asymmetries for neutral pion production\nrecorded by the PHENIX experiment during a series of runs between 2006 and 2013\nat $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV and $\\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV. The impact of the new data is\nstudied by applying Bayesian reweighting to NNPDFpol1.1, the most recent global\nanalysis of helicity-dependent parton distribution functions based on the NNDPF\nmethodology. In comparsion to NNDPFpol1.1, a slightly more positive polarized\ngluon PDF, extended to somewhat smaller values of momentum fractions with\nnarrower uncertainties, as well as a slightly more marked and more precise\nasymmetry between polarized up and down sea quarks are found in this study.\n", "  We present the general introduction to the Parton Reggeization Approach and\ndiscuss some new results on large-p_T production for heavy quarks at the LHC.\nWe concentrate here on study of different correlation spectra for b\\barb-jet\npairs, D\\barD-meson pairs and DD-meson pairs.\n"]}
